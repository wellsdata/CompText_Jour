Hoover's 'New Deal'
Allister Sparks is correct - he doesn't know enough about economics (Ideological fixation holds SA back, despite clear policies, February 29). Herbert Hoover was not a defender of & austerity& and & budget cutting& in the name of laissez faire. His administration increased government spending in successive budgets from 1930 (his first) to 1933, raising nominal spending to 48% over that of the last administration's budget (doubling, if adjusted for the considerable deflation during the period).
Add to this picture the Hoover administration's own & New Deal& and the largest peacetime tax increase in US history. Roosevelt administration policy wonks Rexford Tugwell and Raymond Moley later admitted & the New Deal owed much to what he had begun& and & we found every essential idea (of the New Deal) enacted in the 100-day Congress in the Hoover administration itself& Later, Tugwell would write to Moley that & they were too hard on a man who really invented most of the devices we used& I am afraid Mr Sparks is another victim of political doublespeak and partisan political myth. The historical economic evidence is not as clear as the dominant political narrative.
