FURTHER REVIEW
"I pledge to you - I pledge to myself - to a new deal for the American people."
That's how Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in his address accepting his nomination for
president in Chicago on July 2, 1932, had sold the country on what he'd do for
them once he was in the White House.
After he took office on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt and his cabinet embarked on what
historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called "a presidential barrage of ideas and programs
unlike anything known to American history."
15 PIECES OF LEGISLATION OVER FDR'S FIRST 'HUNDRED DAYS'
Industrial output was half of what it had been just three years before. A
quarter of the nation's working population was unemployed. Farm prices
were so low that farmers were unable to pay their mortgages and losing
their farms. Banks were failing and taking depositors' life savings with them.
Despite the seemingly hopeless situation, New York
Gov. Franklin Delano Roosevelt took office on March 4,
1933 prepared to push through a friendly, Democraticallycontrolled
Congress, an ambitious slate of legislation.
It came to be called FDR's "Hundred Days" -
although it was, in fact, more like 104 days.
DAY 5
MARCH 9
EMERGENCY BANKING ACT
Empowered the nation's 12 Federal Reserve
Banks to issue currency to private banks -
based on good assets - so those banks
would be able to meet every legitimate call
for cash. This ended an ongoing rash of
bank closures that had triggered a rush by
depositors to withdraw their savings.
DAY12
MARCH 16
CULLEN-HARRISON ACT
Thirteen years of Prohibition had resulted in
bootlegging and an increase in organized
crime. Roosevelt fulfilled a campaign
promise by legalizing and taxing beverages
containing no more than 3.2% alcohol. A
constitutional amendment repealing
Prohibition went to states for ratification.
DAY 16
MARCH 20
GOVERNMENT ECONOMY ACT
Roosevelt fulfilled another campaign
promise by cutting $500 million from the
federal budget by eliminating government
agencies, reducing the pay of civilian and
military workers - including Congress itself.
Particularly hard hit were veterans, who saw
their benefits slashed in half.
DAY 27
MARCH 31
CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS
The CCC was an attempt to put young
unemployed males aged 17-24 - many from
urban areas - to work on conservation
projects in rural areas. Within three months,
more than 250,000 males had enlisted. More
than 3 million males would work in the CCC
over its nine years of existence.
DAY 69
MAY 12
FEDERAL EMERGENCY RELIEF ACT
The Federal Emergency Relief Administration
created government-funded jobs for millions
of unemployed workers by providing states
and cities with billions of dollars to finance
local work projects. Between 1933 and 1935,
FERA completed more than 235,000 projects
and at its peak, employed 2.5 million people.
DAY 69
MAY 12
AGRICULTURAL ADJUSTMENT ACT
This program sought to raise farmers' incomes
by increasing crop prices. It did this by paying
farmers to cut production, reduce livestock
herds and leave some fields unplanted. By the
end of 1933, farm prices had nearly doubled
and by the next year, more than 3 million
farmers were participating.
DAY 69
MAY 12
EMERGENCY FARM MORTGAGE ACT
During the double-whammy that was the
Dust Bowl and the Great Depression, many
farms were lost to foreclosure. This legislation
refinanced farm loans at below-market
interest rates and over longer periods, making
for easier terms. Agricultural credit firms were
given more federal supervision.
DAY 75
MAY 18
TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY
The TVA put thousands of people to work
building dams and public power plants in
the Tennessee River Valley which included
land in seven Southern states. The aim was
to stimulate farming in the area, to prevent
flooding and deforestation as well as to
generate hydroelectricity.
DAY 84
MAY 27
SECURITIES ACT
This legislation was aimed at curtailing
investor fraud, risky credit deals and other
abuses that had led to the 1929 stock market
crash and to restore public confidence in the
nation's financial markets. The Federal Trade
Commission was given broad powers to
police falsified stock offerings.
DAY93
JUNE 5
ABROGATION OF GOLD CLAUSES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CONTRACTS
Many contracts at the time gave creditors
the option of demanding payment in gold as
opposed to cash as a hedge against inflation
or other economic uncertainties. A joint
resolution of Congress threw out the use of
gold clauses.
DAY 101
JUNE 13
HOMEOWNERS REFINANCING ACT
The act created the Homeowners Loan Corp.,
which made nearly a million loans over the
next three years. By 1936, the HOLC had
financed 20% of the mortgaged urban homes
in the U.S. It also issued cash advances to
help pay property taxes and for home repairs
and redeem properties lost to foreclosure.
DAY 103
JUNE 15
GLASS-STEAGALL BANKING ACT
Bank reform continued with this legislation
which created the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. to insure and guarantee individual
bank accounts from failing institutions,
giving the Federal Reserve more control
over bank credit and separating commercial
and investment banking.
DAY 103
JUNE 15
FARM CREDIT ACT
The Farm Credit Administration was
established to provide loans for agricultural
purposes and would regulate the banks and
other units of the Farm Credit System. The
independent FCA would be folded into the
Department of Agriculture in 1939 but would
be peeled back out again in 1953.
DAY 103
JUNE 15
EMERGENCY RAILROAD TRANSPORTATION ACT
This measure promoted reorganization of the
railroads and aimed to rebuild traffic that had
fallen off during the Depression by allowing
them to coordinate efforts to prevent waste and
duplication of service and by granting them a
temporary exemption from antitrust laws.
DAY 104
JUNE 16
NATIONAL INDUSTRIAL RECOVERY ACT
The act aimed to end cutthroat competition that
was reducing wages and prices to dangerous
levels. It set maximum hours, minimum wages,
prohibited child labor, guaranteed union rights
and offered exemption from antitrust laws to
companies that complied.
ROOSEVELT'S TEAM OF NEW DEALERS
Roosevelt took office with the intent of responding to the nation's crisis with
what he called "bold, persistent experimentation."
He brought in the brightest, boldest experts he could find and, by all
accounts, entered into discussions with an open mind.
Key members of Roosevelt's inner circle included:
Raymond Moley, a former Columbia University professor who FDR had
hired as a speechwriter. Moley was put to work right away on the banking
crisis and evolved into one of Roosevelt's closest advisers.
Lewis Douglas, a politically-conservative son of the owner of an Arizona
copper mine who played a key role in Roosevelt's cutting
of the federal budget.
Frances Perkins, the product of a conservative New
England family who became an advocate for
workers rights and a crusader for workplace safety
after witnessing the deadly Triangle Shirtwaist factory fire in New York in
1911. FDR made her secretary of labor - the nation's first woman Cabinet
member.
Henry Wallace of Iowa, the third generation of his
family to edit the family's farming newspaper. Roosevelt
made him secretary of agriculture.
And Harry Hopkins, also of Iowa, who had moved to New York,
became a social worker and then was hired by FDR to run
one of his statewide relief programs. Roosevelt put him in charge of the Federal
Emergency Relief Administration, then the Works Progress Administration and then
named him commerce secretary in 1938.
AND, YES, THERE WERE OPPONENTS
There wasn't much Republicans in congress could do to halt Roosevelt's
New Deal: Democrats had swept to enormous majorities in
both houses in 1932.
Most Republicans - including Roosevelt's predecessor, Herbert
Hoover - believed in "laissez-fare" government, wanting less government
intervention or relief efforts and expecting business to pull the
nation out of the Depression.
Roosevelt's New Deal - especially some of the parts that would come
along later, such as Social Security - would lead political rivals to call
him a "socialist" or a "communist."
