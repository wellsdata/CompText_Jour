With his first inaugural address, which was fewer than 2000 words, Franklin Roosevelt won the confidence of the American public - something his predecessor, Herbert Hoover, failed to do in four years as president. In this worthy inaugural volume in a new series about presidential rhetoric, Houck (Rhetoric as Currency: Hoover, Roosevelt, and the Great Depression) investigates the crafting of Roosevelt's speech and the inspiration it gave to a Depression-demoralized nation. The story is mostly that of Raymond Moley, a member of Roosevelt's "brain trust,who struggled with jealous aides and Roosevelt himself as he drafted what is arguably the most memorable presidential speech of the 20th century. Other important themes discussed here are the bitter relationship between Roosevelt and Hoover and the loneliness of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, made worse following her husband's election. Ultimately, the speech proclaiming that we had "nothing to fear but fear itself(a phrase coined by neither Roosevelt nor Moley but by presidential aide Louis Howe) projected the goals of a self-assured leader who through four terms became the most enduring presidential communicator. Recommended for public and academic libraries. - Karl Helicher, Upper Merion Twp. Lib., PA
