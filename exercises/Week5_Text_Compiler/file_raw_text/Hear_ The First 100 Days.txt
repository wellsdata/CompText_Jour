                            (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)                
BARACK OBAMA:                 The way I see it, the first job of my administration is to put people back to work and get our economy moving again.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DO YOU FEEL ME")                
ANTHONY HAMILTON:                 (Singing) Do you feel me? Do you read me? Tell me, am I getting through to you? I wanna know, are you with me? Are you listening? Baby, is my message getting through? Do you feel me, baby?             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Hi, and welcome to a special edition of NPR's PLANET MONEY. I'm David Kestenbaum in Washington, D.C.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 And in New York, I'm Laura Conaway. We are posting this podcast on Monday, January 19, but we're recording it ahead of time because of the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 In this show, we want to consider the situation for Barack Obama, of course, because the inauguration is Tuesday, January 20. And we'll get to that in a second. But first, our indicator for today is $41 billion. That is part of the $825 billion stimulus package being drawn up by House Democrats. And it's the amount they say should be given to school districts serving poor and disabled students.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 And it's also for school construction. And we just have to say we have no idea what that number means. I don't know if it works out to two teachers per school and new windows, basketballs, new air for the basketballs. I really have no idea.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Right. So we are going to be taking an in-depth look at some parts of the stimulus package. And we want your guidance. What parts do you want us to dig in to?             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Check it out. We'll post the stimulus package documents on our blog, npr.org/money. And we'll start by sketching out some of the areas that are being proposed in the House right now.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 There's $54 billion for a smarter electrical grid and for renewable energy.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Six billion dollars to bring the internet to rural areas.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Anyway, take a look and let us know. You can also email us at              
LAURA CONAWAY:                 And we're going to do our best.             
                In all of this, we keep hearing that President-elect Obama has been studying Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who famously took office right in the middle of the Great Depression.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 So as President Obama begins his first hundred days, we thought it would make sense to look back at FDR's his first hundred days.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 And who better to talk to about that than Eric Rauchway? He's an economic historian. He's the author of "The Great Depression And The New Deal: A Very Short Introduction."             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Rauchway gave our colleagues Adam Davidson and Alex Blumberg a very short introduction to the opening measures of Roosevelt's presidency.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 So Roosevelt comes in. The first thing is, let's save the banks because the banks are in deep, dire straits - 5,000 bank failures of the past, you know, four years. And they've begun to accelerate recently. So the first thing they do is to shut down the banks and to audit all of them and then to reopen those that are determined to be sound.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 And this is pretty amazing. It was a week that they shut the...             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Well, it was roughly a week. Moley would later say - Raymond Moley, Roosevelt's principal advisor in this crisis, would later say, capitalism was saved in eight days. So let's say eight days, OK?             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 OK. So no banks are open. Whatever money you've got in your pocket is all the money you're going to have. You're...             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Yeah. And people barter, and people - you know, the Dow company famously mints its own money out of magnesium for a little bit so its employees can have a trading medium and things like that. So there are various resources. People near the borders use either Canadian or Mexican currencies, things like that. But basically, yeah, you can't go get your money.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Wow. OK. And then...             
ALEX BLUMBERG:                 Bank holiday?             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Bank holiday.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 This is the bank holiday.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Good? Bad? Did it work?             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Bank holiday - generally, everybody thinks the bank holiday gets high marks - right? - because now you have the federal government's seal of approval on these banks. When they are reopened, people come, and they put their money back in them, which was the big problem - is that people were taking their money out of the banks, and there were runs on the banks. This is also the beginning that lays the basis for the federal government standing behind your deposits. So it's the basis for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Which doesn't exist yet in the first hundred days.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Doesn't exist yet as this becomes a temporary measure and then is made permanent later in the New Deal. Yeah.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 OK.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 So that's sort of the first thing. The first thing we do is, let's save the banks, right? So that's No. 1. The second thing that's sort of the next highest priority for the Roosevelt administration is to balance the budget, which is not what we would think of now and I don't think anyone's really talking about now as a priority. But in those days, especially with Roosevelt at the helm, this was regarded as a priority, as a measure of responsibility, that you were going to get your house in order. And so they passed the Economy Act with Roosevelt's blessing to try to make sure the federal government remained in the black.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 And that...             
ALEX BLUMBERG:                 Is this day two, day three, day 10?             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Actual days I don't know...             
ALEX BLUMBERG:                 Putting you on the spot, OK.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 ...I can't do yet. But this is the next - this probably would've been...             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Three in the afternoon, 4 in the afternoon?             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Yeah, exactly. This probably would've been the first bill had it not been for the banking crisis - right? - would have been the budget balancing bill.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 OK, which - not a success, I mean, not seen as a helpful...             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Not seen as a helpful thing.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Not something that we hope Obama - President-elect Obama will be doing.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 I don't think anybody's recommending it, to my knowledge anyway. Nobody very prominent is recommending it. And indeed, you know, Roosevelt himself almost immediately fudges on this because they have the balanced budget, but then they also have the emergency budget, which is off the books of the balanced budget, where they do all of the sort of the New Deal-y things that begin to provide people relief and things like that.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 What's No. 3?             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 No. 3, you know, is the Agricultural Adjustment Act - I think you would have to point to as No. 3. This is important to remember that this is a period where a very large number of Americans are still employed in farming. The crisis in farming actually begins well before what we think of as the Great Depression proper and really has been going on since World War I, more or less. Now, in a way, this is partly due to growing pains. People are simply moving to cities and off the land, and farming is as a sector becoming less important to the American economy. It's also becoming much more mechanized. And so people are becoming what they call tractored out because the tractor comes in. There's fewer jobs, therefore for hands, also for mules, as it happens, in the American economy.             
                But partly, it's a result of, you know, sort of, to some extent, environmental despoliation because you're going to get your Dust Bowl here. And so you need to do something to prop up farm prices and to make farmers whole. And the Agricultural Adjustment Act picks up a bunch of ideas that have been floating around, really, since the 1890s to try to help farmers. And they want to give farmers the equivalent of the protective tariff, which has been long the way that America subsidized manufacturers, for the farm sector. And the way they do this is they levy a tax on production of commodities, and then they pay it back to farmers to not produce crops.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Oh, this is where we get that idea.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 You get the beginning of the - yeah. It goes through several permutations before you get the system we have now, but this is, broadly speaking, the beginning of that idea. And so you're going to limit production. That's going to push up prices, and farmers will be happier.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Now, I do know that, I would say, the vast majority of economists think that after World War II, this should have been eliminated. And farming subsidies are a - you know, I think most economists would use something like national disgrace and absurdity.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 In fairness, we're not alone. Other countries have their own disgraceful agricultural policies. But yes.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Right, right. But in the context of the Great Depression, was it a national disgrace then? Or was it helpful? Oh, and by the way, you can send those angry letters to...             
                            (LAUGHTER)                
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 ...planetmoney@npr.org.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 The - you know, national disgrace is probably a bit strong, but it's not a real success, obviously, either. I mean, in the midst of people actually going hungry, you're destroying the means to feed them. Infamously, there is the slaughter of the little piglets - right? - because they're getting rid of the shoats, I think they are - right? - the pigs that have just been born - so to make sure that there's a scarcity of pigs later. And the pig farmers will be doing better.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 So in a country where more than half of people are not working in agriculture, you're doing a policy that helps that minority that works in agriculture and hurting that majority that works out of agriculture.             
ALEX BLUMBERG:                 And needs to eat what the agricultural people are making.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Right.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 So the farmers love it - everybody else not quite so much. Yeah.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 So the big things I think of in the Great Depression - Works Progress Administration, Tennessee Valley Authority, the massive, massive increase in the size and scope of the government. Is that first hundred days, or is that all later?             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 The TVA, the Tennessee Valley Authority, is the first hundred days. The Works Progress Administration is '35. That's later. You can claim that the roots of it are planted in the first hundred days. So let me quickly talk about those things. The TVA is really vital in many ways to understanding the New Deal. It's a - broadly speaking, a regional authority that's supposed to do flood control and provide electricity through one of the most chronically impoverished parts of the south.             
                But it also has mandates to basically economically develop that chronically impoverished part of it any way that they possibly can. And so this not only means electricity. This means watershed management. This means reforestation. This means trying to prevent soil erosion, means developing new kinds of fertilizers that can be used for more efficient use of the soils. It means doing work through the agricultural colleges of the region and employing people directly to do all of these things. So it's a massive mobilization of scientists, of engineers and of the people of the Tennessee Valley area. And it is broadly successful.             
                The Tennessee Valley area is much more prosperous after the TVA gets through with it than it ever was, you know, leading up to the TVA. The big relief programs that will become so essential in the New Deal, particularly the Works Progress Administration, won't come till 1935, but the basis of it comes in the first hundred days. There's the Public Works Administration, which is the really giant public works program - comes in. And the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, which is to try to employ unemployed people for short periods just to tide them over, comes in. And out of those, you can see growing the big public works programs like the WPA. Also, to some extent, things like - that will be made permanent in the Social Security Act are kind of foreshadowed in the FERA, the Emergency Relief Administration.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 In that first hundred days.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Yeah. So you're using the federal government to give money to the states to give to the unemployed, which is roughly the structure that you're going to see erected in Social Security.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 All right. So we're running out of time, but it sounds to me like between March 4, 1933 and - what is it? - June 15 or whatever...             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 Your hundred days.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 ...Hundred days are, we live in a fundamentally different country. The government's role in the economy is is forever changed.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 You've seen the government's role in the economy dramatically increased. Now, it's important to note that it won't be very long before it's actually reeled back, right? Some of the things that are done in the first hundred days are very quickly regarded as practical failures and, slightly after that, regarded as unconstitutional. Congress is so eager to solve the problems of the Great Depression that they cede Roosevelt more power than the Supreme Court will say is consistent with the Constitution. So the Agricultural Adjustment Act will be struck down. The National Recovery Act will be struck down. And it will require the New Dealers to come up with different ways...             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Of doing the exact same thing.             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 ...Of doing similar things. Yeah.             
ADAM DAVIDSON:                 Yeah. And then just one last question. Any lessons? Should Obama do the exact same things in his first hundred days? Should he do none of those things?             
ERIC RAUCHWAY:                 I don't think you will see the balanced budget idea coming forward. I do think you will see more of the public works kinds of things and probably more enthusiastic devotion to public works than you actually saw in the first bit of the Roosevelt administration.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Laura, it'll be interesting to see if Eric Rauchway's predictions come true.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Yeah. Let's actually switch gears here for a second.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 OK.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Listeners have been asking to hear from people who are doing well.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Because there are a lot of people who are not - we have 7.2% unemployment, but that means most people still have jobs.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Last week, I talked to one of the most employable people on the planet. His name is Nathan Fiala. He's 25. He's a mechanical engineer. He does environmental and energy work in North Dakota.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Where, amazingly, the unemployment rate is just 3.3%.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Nathan's lab at the University of North Dakota - he says jobs there go begging. Engineers there have to compete for grants. Nobody's guaranteed a salary. There's no automatic state funding. And still, the money keeps coming in. He says they get two new contracts a week.             
NATHAN FIALA:                 I just got one today. Project manager won a $100,000 award for some mercury sampling. And, you know, I get some of those - you know, I get about two or three a week. So we have a lot of money coming in here. And I think it's just mostly because of the attitude of the people that work here. They go out after the contract. So I don't get the sense that anybody here is worried about keeping a job at all.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 We read a lot back here on the East Coast, where I work, about North Dakota having trouble actually finding enough workers to fill all the jobs the state has right now.             
NATHAN FIALA:                 I think that's spot on, exactly true. We have - where I work, I just walked by the bulletin board downstairs, and they've got, I think, two positions open, one for a research engineer starting out at 50,000. And I see, you know, help wanted signs pretty much every day. We've got a lot of work and not enough people to do it. So exactly right.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 Are you meeting new people moving into North Dakota yet for the work?             
NATHAN FIALA:                 Not really. You know, the only downside of working here is I think it was -24 degrees air temperature, like, the last three days in a row. So that's - you know, keeps the riffraff out, I guess.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 David, that's the view from Grand Forks, N.D., land of great hope, and Nathan Fiala.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Folks, we're going to try and bring you more voices from people and jobs that are doing well in this economy. So keep those stories coming. For now, that's a wrap. We'll be back podcasting on Wednesday.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 And on Tuesday, we'll be observing the presidential inauguration, of course, on the blog by taking apart the stimulus plan. Come help us at npr.org/money.             
DAVID KESTENBAUM:                 Because you know we need the help. I'm David Kestenbaum.             
LAURA CONAWAY:                 And I'm Laura Conaway. Thanks for listening.             
                            (SOUNDBITE OF SONG, "DO YOU FEEL ME")                
ANTHONY HAMILTON:                 (Singing) See deep into you and know what you're thinking now. And if I'm what you're needing, I need some kind of sign. Let me know 'cause I can't read your mind. Are you in? Or am I in this on my own? I need some clue from you. Let me know, babe.
