Apr 14, 2021( Cato@Liberty: http://www.cato .org/blog Delivered by Newstex) ;; George Selgin[1]"This great Nation
will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. [T]he only thing we have to fear is fear itself." —FDR, in
his first inaugural address. "There is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain."—Thomas Hobbes,
on the state of nature, in Leviathan.Not the Sum of its PartsSo far, I've tended to look at the New Deal as a set or
sequence of distinct government policies and programs, remarking on how each either contributed to or hampered
economic recovery.

I've also dealt only with those New Deal policies generally understood to have had promoting recovery as their aim.
But the New Deal was more than just a bunch of policies. As its very name indicates, it purported to be, and in
important respects it was, a novel policy regime, that is, a different overall approach to combating the depression,
and to economic policy more generally. The advent of a new policy regime, and expectations or apprehensions it
inspires, can have economic consequences beyond those of any particular policies that march under its banner.
Uncertainty regarding possible regime changes can also have important economic consequences. In this and the
next installment to my New Deal series, I discuss the bearing of regime change, and regime uncertainty, on the
course of the recovery. As we'll see, although the arrival of the New Deal regime had some beneficial effects
beyond those attributable to any particular policies, the opposite was also true: in its later manifestations especially,
the new regime proved unsettling to businessmen in ways that, according to many, prolonged the depression.Great
ExpectationsThat the New Deal regime change initially had positive consequences has been cogently argued by
Peter Temin and Barry Wigmore[2]. According to them, FDR established a new macroeconomic policy regime
shortly after his inauguration in March 1933. The Hoover administration had been financially conservative, adhering
to the rules of the gold standard and fiscal orthodoxy. Its policy stance in the troubles of the early 1930s therefore,
was decidedly deflationary. Roosevelt broke with this ideology, devaluing the dollar within 6 weeks of his
inauguration, promoting fiscal expansion, and championing the virtues of inflation—reflation as he termed
it.Roosevelt's actions, Temin and Wigmore go on to say, "marked a change in direction for government policies and
for prices in general." Unlike "isolated expansionary actions" that might be understood as "departures from what
was perceived as a long-term government policy," this change only had to be recognized by the public for that
public to alter its expectations rapidly. In his 2008 elaboration on the Temin and Wigmore thesis[3], Gauti
Eggertsson speaks of "an endogenous shift" in the public's expectations brought about by the new administration's
willingness to set aside "policy dogmas." Whether the original New Deal really marked as complete a rejection of
established "policy dogmas" as these authors suggest may well be doubted. For one thing, as I noted previously[4],
FDR campaigned on a commitment to balance the budget, while assailing Hoover for not doing so. He also chose
the extremely orthodox Lewis Douglas[5] as his first budget director. Still the point remains: the benefits of the New
Deal, taken as a whole, could exceed those of the sum of its parts.Regime UncertaintyBut the opposite was also

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 6

true. Even if one fully accepts the "great expectations" hypothesis, it doesn't follow that the game-changing done by
the New Deal had no dark side. The new regime's arrival and metamorphosis over the course of the depression
could also hinder recovery. In particular, Bob Higgs argues[6], it bred "pervasive uncertainty among investors about
the security of their property rights in their capital and its prospective returns," and this uncertainty, Higgs says, was
one reason why the depression dragged on. Although "regime uncertainty" is Higgs's term for it, he recognizes that
his hypothesis isn't new. It had more than a few proponents during the depression years themselves, when people
instead spoke of a lack of "business confidence"; and numerous economists and historians have taken it up since.
One of the idea's early proponents was none other than John Maynard Keynes. Upon returning to England after his
desultory, May 1934 visit with FDR[7], Keynes published an "Agenda for the President" in the New York Times and
the London Times. He said in it that he saw "no likelihood that business of its own initiative will invest in durable
goods of sufficient scale for many months to come." Keynes offered several reasons for this pessimism, chief
among which was the fact that "the important but intangible state of mind, which we call business confidence, is
signally lacking." And the reason for that, he said, is to be found in the perplexity and discomfort which the business
world feels from being driven so far from its accustomed moorings into unknown and uncharted waters. The
business man, who may be adaptable and quick on his feet in his own particular field, is usually conservative and
conventional in the larger aspects of social and economic policy. At the start he was carried away, like other people,
by the prevailing enthusiasm. [But now] he is sulky and bothered; andeven begins to look back with longing to the
good old days of 1932.Keynes went on to observe that FDR could help to dispel "this atmosphere of
disappointment, disillusion, and perplexity" by convincing businessmen that "they know the worst." As we'll see,
FDR didn't follow this advice; and some year later, in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (pp. 64-5), Joseph
Schumpeter did not hesitate to blame both "the subnormal recovery" up to 1937 and the slump that followed on the
"general change in the attitude of government to private enterprise" that came with the New Deal. "So extensive
and rapid a change in the social scene," Schumpeter wrote, "naturally affects productive performance for a time,
and so much the most ardent New Dealer must and also can admit. One ex-New Dealer who admitted it publicly
was Raymond Moley[8]. "Confidence," he says in his 1939 memoir, After Seven Years[9], is the existence of that
mutual faith and good will which encourages enterprises to expand and take risks And in an age of increased
governmental interposition in industrial operationsthe maintenance of confidence presupposes both a general
understanding of the direction in which legislative and administrative changes tend and a general belief in
government's sympathetic desire to encourage the development of those investment opportunities whose
successful exploitation is a sine qua non for a rising standard of living. This, Roosevelt refused to recognize (p.
373)."Refused to recognize" is probably not giving FDR his due. He more likely understood that a lack of business
confidence discouraged investment and recovery, but chose to shake that confidence anyway to achieve reforms
he considered essential either for narrowly political reasons, or because he thought they'd yield long-run social
benefits exceeding their short-run costs.Laid LowPractically everyone agrees that inadequate investment held back
the recovery. A glance at the chart below, showing percentage changes in net and gross private investment and
consumption spending since the start of 1929, should suffice to drive home just how little investment there was.
The first thing that's obvious from the chart is that, at just shy of ninety percent, the percentage decline in gross
investment was much greater than the percentage decline in consumption. As a share of GDP, gross domestic
private investment dropped from 16 percent to less than 2 percent. The decline in net investment was even more
severe—so much so that it turned negative and stayed that way until 1935. Although it then turned positive again,
on the eve of the '37 downturn, which saw it go below zero again, it was still 40 percent below its 1929 level. Not
until 1940 would it and the other measures shown in the chart return to their original levels. For the full 1930-1940
period, net private investment added up to minus $3.1 billion. The economy's private job-creating capacity suffered
accordingly. Yet this picture, dire as it is, doesn't tell the full story. That's so because the "investment" shown in it
includes unplanned additions to business inventories, which tend to accompany downturns, and other short-term
investments that aren't so sensitive to perceived regime changes. For a sense of what happened to planned,
longer-term investment during the depression, here's a chart showing the course of gross private investment in all
kinds of residential and business structures: Here the inadequacy of the post-1933 recovery is still more evident
than in the previous chart. Investment in structures, like overall gross private investment, first falls to a tenth of its
level at the start of 1929. But at the end of the decade, after a period of slow recovery that was interrupted by the
'37 crash, it is still less than half its 1929 level. So long as investment failed to recover, recovery writ large could
only go so far, and last so long. "The depletion of capital," Kenneth Roose observes (1954, p. 12), "limited the
number of workers that could be profitably employed." That in turn meant that such gains in consumption spending

                                                                                                             Page 3 of 6
                                   The New Deal and Recovery, Part 12: Fear Itself

as had been achieved lacked what W. L. Crum, R. A. Gordon, and Dorothy Wescott called "sustaining momentum."
"As recovery progressed," they wrote in assessing the 1937 collapse[10], the substitution for stimulated revival of a
more normally balanced expansion, predicated upon long-run undertakings by business leadership in an
environment sufficiently secure from interference to justify assumption of risk, was not facilitated.If the regime
uncertainty hypothesis is right, the trouble wasn't just that the New Deal failed to "facilitate" investment. It was that it
actually discouraged it.Guinea PigsThe New Deal is said to have given businessmen and investors the willies in at
least two ways. First, as its policy innovations multiplied, with no apparent end in sight, and no telling what might
come next, they no longer felt able to plan for the future: a long-run investment that seemed worthwhile so far
might, for all they knew, cease to be so with the next new reform effort. Second, administration officials became
increasingly ill-disposed toward businessmen, and big businessmen especially, to the point where those
businessmen feared deliberate attempts to deprive them of their capital or already thin profits. That the New Deal,
instead of consisting of a coordinated set of previously-conceived policies, would involve trial and error, was
something Roosevelt foresaw and plumped for during his 1932 presidential campaign. "The country needs and,
unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation," he said in his famous
Oglethorpe speech[11] that May. "It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try
another. But above all, try something. The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things
to satisfy their needs are within easy reach." By the fall of 1932, few could have doubted that some experimentation
was called for; and that only became more obvious after the banking system collapsed on the eve of FDR's
inauguration. Nor could anyone expect every policy that was tried to succeed. But while FDR's willingness to
innovate wasn't itself objectionable, instead of following through by assessing his administration's experiments and
discarding ones that failed, he tended, like certain WWI generals, to treat each successful offensive as a gain to be
preserved at all costs, as if it were indeed part of one grand strategy. Consequently, as the depression wore on,
businessmen found themselves overwhelmed by new legislation, much of which involved considerable, if not
sweeping, changes to the rules for doing business, and to their property rights. The following table, reproduced from
Higgs (1997), lists only those "substantially attenuating or threatening" those rights. The year 1935, in particular,
saw such a decisive shift of the Roosevelt administration's emphasis from recovery to reform that it amounted to an
entirely new regime change—the so-called Second New Deal[12]. By means of the "gorge of indigestible
measures" enacted during it, Moley writes, the original New Deal "was completely transformed." "The impact of
these multitudinous measures," Chase National Bank economist Benjamin Anderson wrote[13] a decade later,
"upon a bewildered industrial and financial community was extraordinarily heavy."And Villains1935 also witnessed a
change in the Roosevelt administration's attitude toward businessmen. During his 1932 campaign, Roosevelt spoke
of the need for "cooperation" between the government and business; and his administration's willingness to seek
such cooperation was evident in its early conduct and policies. Even the NIRA, before the introduction of the
blanket code, reflected the administration's desire to rely upon what Moley calls "cooperative business-government
planning," and to reject the alternative of dealing with "private economic power by smashing it to bits." Roosevelt
understood, furthermore, that a lasting recovery depended on the revival of private enterprise. In short, "he had no
quarrel with business, as such. Certainly he did not regard it as an enemy."[1][14] But by the summer of 1935,
FDR's disposition had changed dramatically. Riled by business organizations' increasingly vituperative criticism of
him and the New Deal; angered by the Supreme Court's striking down of the NRA; egged-on by his Progressive
advisors; and determined to win-over supporters of populist presidential candidate Huey Long by stealing a march
on Long's "Share Our Wealth" plan[15], Roosevelt unveiled his own plan for reining-in plutocrats—the notorious
"soak-the-rich" tax proposal.[2][16] FDR made the proposal in a June 19th message to Congress[17], "Our revenue
laws," he announced, "have operated in many ways to the unfair advantage of the few, and they have done little to
prevent an unjust concentration of wealth and economic power." His first target was inherited wealth. Calling such
wealth "inconsistent with the ideals of this generation," he recommended that, besides estate taxes, "an inheritance,
succession, and legacy tax" for "all very large amounts," as well as gift taxes to frustrate attempts to evade it. Next
came high incomes. Because "social unrest and a deepening sense of unfairness are dangers to our national life,"
the Government, he said, had a duty "to restrict such incomes by very high taxes." The final target was big
business. "Vast concentrations of capital," FDR said, "should be ready to carry burdens commensurate with their
powers and their advantages." He therefore recommended "a corporation income tax graduated according to the
size of corporation income," to be supplemented (again as a check against evasion) by a tax on intercorporate
dividends. As if this then-unprecedented proposal might not upset businessmen enough, FDR explained that he
saw it as a half measure only. "Ultimately," he said—foreshadowing legislation to come—he looked forward to both

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 6

"the simplification of our corporate structures through the elimination of unnecessary holding companies" and
policies that would "discourage unwieldy and unnecessary corporate surpluses." Roosevelt's recommendations
came as a complete surprise to Congress: in his January 3rd budget message[18], he'd advised against any new or
additional taxes for the coming fiscal year; and deficits since then had been lower than expected. But if his new
suggestions surprised Congress, they—and his corporate tax proposals in particular—threw the business
community into what Ray Moley called "paroxysms of fright," unnerving it almost as much as the Supreme Court's
striking down of the NRA had cheered it in May. Taxes were, for the first time, being proposed for the avowed
purpose of redistributing wealth rather than raising revenue. The graduated corporate tax, in particular, was
understood to have no purpose save the dubious one of taxing bigness[19]. No good purpose, that is: the
Philadelphia Enquirer considered it "an effective method of hampering re-employment, preventing wage increases
and delaying recovery." Right or wrong, the Enquirer was far from alone. In its report on the Revenue Bill[20], the
Senate Finance Committee recorded the minority opinion that the bill would be better entitled, A bill to confiscate
property; to discourage business and prevent its expansion; to destroy incentive and discriminate against ability,
brain, and ambition, and enterprise; to create inequalities and to obstruct recovery; to jeopardize the financial
position of the government; and for other improper purposes.Despite such protests, the revenue bill sailed through
Congress that August with unseemly haste, aided by Democratic super-majorities in both houses and congressional
leaders' desire to carry out rather than question FDR's wishes. Although higher estate taxes took the place of FDR's
proposed inheritance and gift taxes, most of his other suggestions, including the graduated corporate tax, were
enacted, if only after some watering-down. "It seems," an article in the staid AER opined[21], "that such a measure
is important enough to justify more deliberate and careful consideration than was given." Instead, "all serious
opposition appears to have been bought off with promises or bowled over by the huge Administration majority."
"There can be no denying," the AER article continued, that the President's message was an attack on wealth. Nor
can it be denied that the diverting of taxation from the primary purpose of raising revenue to other major purposes
involves great hazards. That there are tremendous abuses that should be remedied can admit of no question. But
how best eliminate the abuses and yet do a minimum of harm; how best promote ingenuity, enterprise, economy,
social security and all the other desiderata becomes even more difficult with the growing complexities of modern
industrial society.It also becomes more difficult, the authors might have added, in the middle of a depression. ***
FDR's "war" with business didn't end with the August 20th passage of the Revenue Act. Several days later he
signed another law that many businessmen found even more disconcerting. And in 1936 his rhetoric, if not his
administration's legislation, would become still more ferocious. I'll take up the rest of the story of New Deal regime
uncertainty in the next installment to this series. Continue Reading The New Deal and Recovery:Intro[22] Part 1:

Years, pp. 184 and 300. This isn't to say that every Roosevelt administration official showed compassion, whether
real or simulated, toward businessmen. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, for example, spoke contemptuously
of formerly "great and powerful" businessmen, those "boastful, aggressive supermen" who now "came fearfully to
Washington to beg the President to help them save some little from the disaster that by their arrogance and
pridethey had themselves precipitated." (Harold Ickes, The New Democracy, 1934, pp. 26-7). [2][36] In his "secret"
diary entry for November 4th, 1934, Harold Ickes notes that Roosevelt had already convinced by then, presumably
by Felix Frankfurter, that "big business is bent on a deliberate policy of sabotaging the Administration." Frankfurter
had urged FDR to "recognize that there was a war on an act on that assumption," though he added that the
president needn't "declare war verbally." See Michael Parrish, Felix Frankfurter and His Times (1982, p. 244).
Concerning Huey Long: in April 1935, the Democratic National Committee conducted a secret poll (the
questionnaire it sent around purported to have come from the National Inquirer of Washington, DC, though there
was no such paper). The results suggested that, whether he ran himself or merely endorsed the Republican
candidate, Long might divert enough votes from FDR to cost him the presidency, much as Theodore Roosevelt had
cost Taft the presidency in 1912. See Robert Snyder, "Huey Long and the Presidential Election of 1936"
