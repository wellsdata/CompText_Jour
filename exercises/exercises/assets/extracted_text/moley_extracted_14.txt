They had worked together for years in remote areas of the bureaucracy, sorting out the esoterica of American trade
policy.

When they saw each other again last week, drawn by the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the signing of
the Reciprocal Trade Act of 1934, they couldn't stop talking about the old days.

They were the assistant secretaries and ranking officials of the State, Commerce and Agriculture departments who,
as a group, conceived and formulated American trade policy in the 1930's and 1940's.

They met at a black-tie dinner sponsored by Consumers for World Trade, a lobbying organization; at a luncheon at
the Arts Club given by Walter Hollis, formerly of the State Department and one of its top legal minds on trade; and
in the Dirksen Senate Office Building at hearings called by Senator William F. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, to
discuss world trade half a century after the seminal legislation.
A 'Feisty' Hull, a 'Piqued' Peek

Familiar names fell from the tongue - Cordell Hull, Raymond Moley, Clair Wilcox, George Peek, Henry A. Wallace,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Out came the anecdotes: ''Cordell was a feisty man.'' ''George Peek resigned in pique.''

Prof. Richard N. Gardner of Columbia University, who has served in Democratic administrations, recalled the two
opposing versions of a speech on trade that Roosevelt was to give in the fall of 1932.

One came from the free-trader Mr. Moley, the other from the protectionist Mr. Peek. Both later became members of
the Roosevelt brains trust.

''Weave the two together,'' Roosevelt ordered his advisers, and out came a predictable, oratorical pushmi-pullyu.

But by 1934, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Moley and Secretary of State Hull, a former Senator from Tennessee, the
Administration had embarked on a course of opening up world trade after the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of
1930.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3

Seeds of Postwar Prosperity

Until 1934, Congress set the tariff schedules. The results were an almost steady rise to the historic high of 60
percent after the 1930 measure.

Many say the Smoot-Hawley act was the major factor in the global depression of those years.

Under the Reciprocal Trade Act, signed by Roosevelt June 12, 1934, Congress delegated negotiating authority to
the President to seek reductions with other countries.

That began a long process of trade expansion that was to become the engine of postwar prosperity.

Willis C. Armstrong, who worked for many years in the State Department, recalled an episode at a luncheon at the
Arts Club that illustrated much of the trade thinking of the day. President Hoover was campaigning for his second
term. The campaign train pulled into Chester, Pa., home of the Scott Paper Company.

As he had at previous stops, Hoover asked an adviser what the principal product of Chester was. The reply: toilet
paper.

In his speech from the rear platform of the campaign train, Hoover, with great oratorical flourish, said that what this
country needed more than anything else was a big increase in the tariff on - toilet paper.


Time and Party Switches

The United States Trade Representative, Bill Brock, repeated the story at a dinner at the International Club,
sponsored by Consumers for World Trade.

He said it was the reason his grandfather, a Senator from Tennessee who strongly opposed Smoot-Hawley, was a
Democrat.

But Mr. Brock noted that the positions of the parties had changed dramatically, with Republicans espousing free
trade and Democrats espousing protection. Walter F. Mondale has strongly supported protection for the automobile
and steel industries.

''That's why I'm a Republican today,'' said Mr. Brock, who confides that more than anything else, he would like to
debate Mr. Mondale on trade policy.


A Truman Era 'Disaster'

J. M. Colton Hand, who used to write letters for Cordell Hull, reminisced about battles in 1947 to try to sell Congress
on an International Trade Organization that could enforce fair trade practices.

Major trading nations had already negotiated creation of the institution. Congress opposed American participation.
It feared the United States would be giving up too much sovereignty.

Yet, according to Mr. Hand's account, the Administration of Harry S. Truman made a major tactical error.

''We went through the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees instead of Ways and
Means and Finance,'' he said.

''The Foreign Affairs guys didn't have the vaguest notion of what foreign trade was all about. We couldn't educate
them to come to a meaningful decision. It was a disaster.''
