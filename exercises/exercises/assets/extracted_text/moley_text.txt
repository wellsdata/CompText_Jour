 July 14 -- · Lately I've been dipping into the great memoirs of Raymond Moley again. Moley was FDR's closest
confidante early from the governor's mansion in Albany and into the White House in 1933. In fact, Moley wrote
most of FDR's very problematic First Inaugural Address (but not the much more problematic Commonwealth Club
Address).

Moley broke with FDR after 1936, appalled by where he thought the New Deal had gone badly wrong, and FDR's
increasing monomania. Afterwards Moley moved to the right and eventually became a Republican. He wrote this in
one of his memoirs, and see if it doesn't apply to today:
"Progressivism has always thrived upon the attacks of its enemies. It remains to be seen whether it can survive the
mistakes of its friends."
· Over at the American Thinker, Gamaliel Isaac writes:
"Critical Race Theory is liable to end for reasons very similar to the reasons the Salem witch trials ended."
Let us hope this is true. I am doubtful. The biggest question for the fall is what is going to happen on college
campuses that were shut down for the last academic year, and hence missed the chance for campus protests about
George Floyd, BLM, Defund the Police, etc. Will the "great reset" entail things calming down, with students and
faculty alike saying they've had enough wokery, or will there be pent up demand to push even further to the left? I
can see either outcome happening.
· Finally-what's wrong with the humanities on college campuses in 10 seconds:

In this week's column, I'd like to raise two questions suggested by David Beito's excellent book The New Deal's War
on the Bill of Rights, which I reviewed last week. First, how can it be that Franklin Roosevelt has acquired a
reputation among leftist historians as a champion of liberty, with his internment of Japanese Americans during
World War II regarded as an aberration, in the face of the manifold violations of civil liberties that occurred during
his administration? Second, given Roosevelt's authoritarian proclivities, why wasn't he successful in imposing the
complete regime of censorship he wanted?

The answer to the first question is that Roosevelt preferred in most cases to work behind the scenes, aiding and
abetting others to do his work. We see this in the activities of Hugo Black and Sherman Minton, both senators and
later Supreme Court justices, whom Roosevelt assiduously encouraged and promoted.
Black, who from 1935 chaired the US Senate Special Subcommittee to Investigate Lobbying Activities, subpoenaed
a vast number of telegrams from opponents of the New Deal, putting their activities under surveillance in an effort to
intimidate them. As Beito explains,
The committee monitored private communications on a scale previously unrivaled in US history, at least in
peacetime. Working in tandem with the Federal Communications Commission and the Roosevelt administration, it
examined literally millions of private telegrams with virtually no supervision or constraint. Those singled out for this
surveillance were anti-New Deal critics, including activists, journalists, and lawyers.
In acting in this fashion, Black was doing what Roosevelt wanted.

The committee's most powerful champion was Roosevelt himself, though he carefully avoided tipping his hand in
public. . . . Roosevelt responded to [Raymond] Moley with "a long discourse of how Black's invasion of privacy had
ample precedent." The inference drawn by Moley was that for Roosevelt "the end justified the means." The
conversation left Moley "with the harrowing intimation that Roosevelt was looking forward to nothing more than
having the opposition of his 'enemies'-the newspapers, the bankers, the businessmen-reelect him." . . . The Black
Committee was first and foremost a creature of Roosevelt's wish to establish a congressional committee to discredit
opponents. After the president had made that decision, he sought out Black, a loyal political foot soldier, to take
charge.
Roosevelt appointed Black to a vacancy on the Supreme Court in 1936, knowing that he could count on that
stalwart New Dealer to uphold all his unconstitutional programs. When it became public knowledge the next year
that Black had, in the words of Charles Tansill, "hidden his face beneath the hooded robes of a Klansman," there
was a clamor for Black to resign, but Roosevelt did not join it, even though Black admitted having been a KKK
member. Many years later, Black ironically earned a reputation as a "free speech" absolutist, although he still
defended his vote in Korematsu v. United States upholding Roosevelt's order to intern Japanese Americans in

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 3
                                             FDR against the Bill of Rights

concentration camps. According to Beito, "Black . . . was unrepentant. In 1971, he asserted that '[p]eople were
rightfully fearful of the Japanese in Los Angeles. . . . They all look alike to a person not a Jap. Had [Japan] attacked
our shores, you'd have had a large number fighting with the Japanese troops.'"
After his victory in the election of 1936, Roosevelt was determined to destroy those who had lobbied against his
plan to pack the Supreme Court and against other New Deal measures. Probably the most important such group
was the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government (NCUCG). Much of the day-to-day administration
of this committee was conducted by Edward Rumely, who proved able and efficient in his job. Minton's chief tactic
in disabling the group was to subpoena the tax records of its principal contributors, hoping that bringing their names
before the public would make them reluctant to give more money. When Rumely and others challenged this gross
invasion of privacy, Minton responded by releasing some of the tax records of the organization to the public.
Roosevelt fully backed Minton and asked J. Edgar Hoover to conduct an FBI investigation of Rumely. Beito
describes this sad chain of events:
New Dealers seemed to have found an ideal champion in Sherman Minton. As a biographer put it, his loyalty to the
president and his agenda "uncommon even among fellow true-believers," included a "strong streak of populism,
and belief that government must be powerful". . . . In December 1937, Roosevelt affirmed his confidence in the
Minton Committee by inviting all three Democratic members to an eight-man "council of war" to plot strategy for
1938 . . . Minton articulated the group's consensus by recommending a fighting stance. "The opposition isn't
satisfied with a conciliatory attitude," he declared. "The only thing they understand is a swift kick where it hurts." He
urged a "crack down" on the taxes of the rich. . . . Roosevelt was more than receptive, chiming in, "We have just
begun to fight."
It is clear that Roosevelt wanted the total suppression of his critics, and this leads to our second question: Why did
he fail to achieve his goal? He won some victories: for example, the NCUCG suffered a major loss in funding due to
Minton's efforts. But Roosevelt did not succeed in imposing totalitarian control. One reason for this, and it is a
reason that is instructive for our own troubled times, is that his efforts at suppression met resolute opposition, and
not only from those directly targeted. Many among those with impeccably pro-Roosevelt credentials, as well as
libertarians such as Albert Jay Nock and H.L. Mencken, who could not be dismissed as lobbyists for big business,
avowed their support for civil liberties, and the public pressure forced Roosevelt and his senatorial entourage to
back down.
The ever-persistent Norman Thomas [a frequent Socialist Party candidate for president] charged that Roosevelt
represented "the party of Frank Hague [a corrupt and tyrannical New Jersey political boss,]" while Albert Jay Nock,
an individualist and civil libertarian, blamed what he regarded as Roosevelt's disdain for the Constitution on New
Deal policies of centralization. Roosevelt, according to Nock, "advises Congressmen not to be too particular about
the constitutionality of a measure which interests him. . . . Given a Roosevelt who manipulates or disregards the law
as he sees fit, and you immediately spawn a tribe of Murphys, Hagues, Ickeses, Wallaces, Blacks, Mintons, who
may freely manipulate or disregard the law as they see fit" (emphasis Nock's)
Faced with today's government schemes to deprive us of our liberties, such as "gun control" and the restriction of
"hate speech," it is imperative that we fight back.

Before moving down from New York to launch his first term in the White House, Franklin D. Roosevelt sent an
advance team headed by Raymond Moley - a 46-year-old Columbia University professor and leader of Roosevelt's
Brain Trust - who was more or less making his debut in public life. Within weeks, as Roosevelt's closest and most
influential adviser, Ray Moley became known as "the second strongest man in Washington." As ti developed,
Moley's turn in the Washington spotlight was brief, but he went on to a distinguished career in political commentary.
At 88, and despite a recent heart attack, Moley was still busy with his memoirs and other writings when he died last
week in Phoenix, Ariz.

The term New Deal was credited to Moley. He set up shop for the Roosevelt Administration, hiring aides, making
and screening Cabinet selections, twisting Congressional arms and swinging so much weight before and during the
famous hundred days that one of FDR's old-friends was said to have approached the President-elect shortly before
the inauguration and begged: "Franklin, can you do me one favor? Can you get me an appointment with Moley?"

Soon, however, in his nominal title of Assistant Secretary of State, Moley butted heads with Cordell Hull, the proud
and touchy Secretary of State. In addition, Moley was a fundamental conservative who began to find Roosevelt's
policies alarmingly radical. Moley resigned in September 1933; despite a widening rift, he continued to serve the
President as a consultant until 1936, but them Morley boted the Democratic Party and he and FDR never met
again.

Moley taught school in his native Ohio and remained on the Columbia faculty in his Brain Trust days and for many
years afterward, but journalism took up more and more of his time. In 1934, he became editor and columnist at
Today, a current-events weekly. Three years later, when Today and Newsweek merged, Moley began a long
association with Newsweek, briefly as editor and for 30 years as a columnist until his retirement from the
newsweekly gind at 81 - though he went on writing books, chiefly on politics and political history. Moley's prose
was direct and often critical but devoid of nasty twists. "We can hurt beyond repair by unfairness," he once said.
"We should first be fair. Then, if there is something to spare, we may be clever." He also believed in getting to the
point: "If I were th umpire, I would call a balk on some of our writers for delaying the game."

In 1970, Moley returned to the White House to receive the Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian honor that the
U.S. awards. "A man of thought and a man of action," said the accompanying citation, "he has not only studied and

The First Church of Christ, Congregational in New London, Conn., was the setting yesterday for the marriage of
Kelle Kay Harbert and Dr. Jeffrey Fletcher Moley. The Rev. Robert C. Hamm performed the ceremony.

Jennifer Ruth Harbert was maid of honor for her sister. Roger Walton Moley was his brother's best man.

Mrs. Moley is a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Charles Armon Harbert of Waterford, Conn. Her father, a chemist, is
executive director of medicinal chemistry for Pfizer Inc. in Groton, Conn. The bridegroom is a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Malcolm Moley of New York and Quogue, L.I. His father is a surgeon at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

The bride, who expects to receive an M.D. degree from the Yale University School of Medicine next June,
graduated magna cum laude from Wellesley College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Her husband, who is chief resident in general surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital, graduated from the Hill School
and magna cum laude from Harvard College, and received an M.D. degree in 1980 from the Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons. The bridegroom is a grandson of the late Raymond Moley, who, as an
adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, coined the term ''New Deal'' and was a leader of the original brain trust.
He later served as an assistant Secretary of State.

The following information was released by the Cato Institute:

By George Selgin

"It is difficult to think of an important aspect of the New Deal to which Roosevelt had not plainly pledged himself
before taking office. ...Roosevelt had campaigned on a clear and specific New Deal Program." (Eric Rauchway,
Winter War, pp. 15-17.)

To understand the New Deal's shortcomings as a grand scheme for achieving economic recovery, it helps to realize
that the New Deal wasn't a grand scheme at all, but an assemblage of steps and programs, many of which were
decided upon or concocted only after Roosevelt took office.

But if I'm to expect you to see the New Deal that way, I must first convince you that Eric Rauchway's opposite claim
isn't true. Hence this post, which (unlike most others to come) is about history, but not so much about economics. If
you're only here for the econ., you might skip it without fear of not being able to follow others in this series.

Rauchway's Revisionism

According to Rauchway, most of the New Deal's important components had been planned and pledged to well
before FDR took office. Rauchway's view goes hand-in-hand with his portrayal of the New Deal as a well-oiled,
supercharged recovery machine. In contrast my own view of the New Deal, as a set of make-shift remedies, makes
it seem more likely to have had the U.S. economy bucking and stalling like an ill-tuned jalopy.

Of the two views, mine is (for once) the more orthodox. Although journalist Robert Wright took poetic license when
he wrote, back in 2001, that "FDR threw a bunch of policies against the wall, and the ones that stuck became the
New Deal," his opinion isn't all that far removed from what most New Deal historians believe. Roger Daniels, in his
2015 book Road to the New Deal, even goes so far as to say that "The notion that when Franklin Roosevelt
became president he had a plan in his head called the New Deal is a myth no serious scholar has ever believed."

Rauchway is certainly a serious scholar. So, how has he come to his unorthodox view? In brief, he argues (1) that
the New Deal must have been a coherent and well-advertised program, as well as a radical one, for otherwise
Hoover couldn't have made opposition to it the cornerstone of his own presidential campaign; (2) that the memories
and motives of FDR's own colleagues and advisors who insist there was no plan can't be trusted; (3) that other
historians haven't examined the right documents; and (4) that the orthodox view can't possibly be right because it

                                                                                                            Page 2 of 6
                     THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 2: INVENTING THE NEW DEAL

implies that Roosevelt misled voters, depriving his program of "democratic legitimacy," whereas it's clear that
democratic legitimacy "was the New Deal's ultimate goal."

Most of these arguments seem easily answered. Concerning "democratic legitimacy": that Roosevelt didn't tell
voters just "what he was going to do" needn't mean that he hoodwinked them. It could (and did in fact) mean that he
himself had no precise idea what he would do once in office. Concerning Hoover: although he did say things like
"they [i.e., the Democrats] are proposing changes and so-called new deals which would destroy the very
foundations of our American system," it is of course common for candidates to accuse their opponents of harboring
sinister plans. If Hoover's frightening portrayal of FDR's plans was unusual, it was not because it accurately
represented the avowed designs of FDR or his party, but because Hoover appears to have sincerely believed it.
Concerning other historians missing key sources: if so, then Rauchway ought to supply direct proof of his own
thesis from these. But he never does.

What Rauchway does do is either ignore or dismiss key documents informing the orthodox view, including the
testimonies of Raymond Moley and Frances Perkins, two of FDR's closest associates. According to Moley, the
first member of FDR's "brain trust," believing that New Deal policies were "the result of a unified plan" is like
believing "that the accumulation of stuffed snakes, baseball pictures, school flags, old tennis shoes, carpenter's
tools, and chemistry sets in a boys bedroom could have been put there by an interior decorator." Although he cites
Moley extensively, Rauchway doesn't mention this statement.

Dissing Frances Perkins

Moley eventually parted company with FDR, so perhaps his testimony is jaundiced. The same certainly can't be
said of the testimony of Frances Perkins, who first served with FDR in Albany and was secretary of labor for all four
of his terms in Washington. In The Roosevelt I knew, her 1946 memoir, Perkins writes:

The notion that the New Deal had a preconceived theoretical position is ridiculous. The pattern it was to assume
was not clear or specific in Roosevelt's mind, in the mind of the Democratic party, or in the mind of anyone else
taking part in the 1932 campaign.

"Not clear or specific." Although Rauchway does refer to this passage, he avoids quoting these words flatly
contradicting his own. Instead he opines, condescendingly, that while "Perkins may have been a great secretary of
labor... she was a poor historian: not a word of her remarks is true."

Why would Perkins not tell the truth? "In reminiscing," Rauchway says, "she may merely have forgotten how things
stood thirteen years before." But thirteen years isn't so long, after all; and "ridiculous" isn't the sort of adjective one
uses to describe something one isn't certain about. Nor, for that matter, is it likely that Perkins' foggy memory
inspired not only the passage in question, but several others to the very same effect that Rauchway doesn't quote.
Passages like

When Franklin Roosevelt and his administration began their work in Washington in March 1933, the New Deal was
not a plan with form and content. It was a happy phrase he had coined during the campaign, and its value was
psychological. It made people feel better, and in that terrible period of depression they needed to feel better,

and

It is important to repeat, the New Deal was not a plan, not even an agreement, and it was certainly not a plot, as
was later charged.

This last statement reads almost as if Perkins wanted to make sure no one would attribute her other statements to
mere heedlessness.

There are also other passages referring to specific New Deal programs. For example, Perkins observes that as late
as April 1933 FDR's "mind was as innocent as a child's of any such program as the NRA." In fact, far from being
confined to scattered obiter dicta, Perkins' claim that the New Deal wasn't planned in advance forms one of her
memoir's central themes.

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 6
                    THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 2: INVENTING THE NEW DEAL

But Rauchway has an answer to this as well. "In reminiscing," he says, "Perkins may have wanted to minimize
Roosevelt's own role in the New Deal so she could maximize her own." To call this charge against Perkins, who has
been described as "a modest woman" who "didn't care if other people took credit," and who by all accounts was
fiercely loyal to FDR, "far-fetched," is being charitable. "Shabby" is more like it.

The New Deal and the FDR's Campaign

Let's now consider the facts of the case. They are, in brief, that while a few elements of what the "New Deal" came
to mean in practice were spelled-out clearly enough beforehand, many others, including most of the New Deal's
"recovery" components, weren't. Nor is it likely they could have been anticipated, or that Roosevelt would have
divulged them if they had been.

As for what Roosevelt did make explicit, until his nomination his most revealing remarks came during his May 22,
1932 speech at Oglethorpe University. Here he spoke of "the vital necessity of planning for definite objectives." But
if Roosevelt already had a plan in mind he revealed nothing of its content. Instead he declared that "the country
demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly
and try another. But above all, try something." This was indeed an accurate indication of what was to come. But
what it described was more like a plan to throw policies against a wall to see which ones stuck than a "clear and
specific New Deal program." The closest Roosevelt came in his speech to announcing even part of such a program
was in declaring it "self-evident that we must... restore commodities to a level approximating their dollar value of
several years ago or else see more defaults or loan write-downs." Even so, he didn't say how he planned to get
"commodities" up again.

From the opening of the Democratic National Convention on June 27th, 1932, the Democratic platform became the
official statement of FDR's intentions, to which he solemnly agreed to adhere. "We believe," it declared,

that a party platform is a covenant with the people to have [sic] faithfully kept by the party when entrusted with
power, and that the people are entitled to know in plain words the terms of the contract to which they are asked to
subscribe.

If there was ever an opportunity for the Democrats to reveal a "clear and specific" New Deal program, this was
surely it. But while the platform listed some measures that would indeed be part of the actual New Deal, as far as
the New Deal's recovery initiatives are concerned, it was more misleading than prescient. The platform promised:

"an immediate and drastic reduction of governmental expenditures...to accomplish a saving of not less than twenty-
five per cent in the cost of the Federal Government";

"a federal budget annually balanced on the basis of accurate executive estimates within revenues, raised by a
system of taxation levied on the principle of ability to pay";

"a sound currency to be preserved at all hazards and an international monetary conference called on the invitation
of our government";

"strengthening and impartial enforcement of the anti-trust laws, to prevent monopoly and unfair trade practices, and
revision thereof for the better protection of labor and the small producer and distributor."

The platform also "condemn[ed] the extravagance of the [Hoover administration's] Farm Board," including its
"unsound policy of restricting agricultural products to the demands of domestic markets."

As we'll see, Roosevelt did in fact try to cut spending and balance the federal budget. But he was unsuccessful on
both scores; and today it is the growth in spending, and especially in deficit spending, during the New Deal that is
said to have contributed to the recovery as an early application of supposedly "Keynesian" thinking. (I'll address
Keynes's actual influence on Roosevelt's policies in a later post.) As for "strengthening and impartial enforcement of
the anti-trust laws," the National Recovery Administration, one of the actual New Deal's centerpieces, would do just
the opposite. A second New Deal centerpiece, the Agricultural Adjustment Association, would, through its "domestic

                                                                                                           Page 4 of 6
                    THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 2: INVENTING THE NEW DEAL

allotment" plan, implement the very "policy of restricting agricultural products to the demands of domestic markets"
that the platform expressly condemned.{1]

Turning to monetary policy, that the "bank holiday" and Emergency Banking Act were adventitious measures rather
than ones FDR had been planning all along should go without saying. The promised "international monetary
conference" was actually scuttled by Roosevelt. As for the other monetary measures that were to be chiefly
responsible for aggregate demand growth during the New Deal erasuspending gold payments, and devaluing the
dollarthe platform never so much as hints at them. On the contrary: it assures voters that a "sound currency is to be
preserved at all hazards."

Some commentators claim that the phrase "sound currency" was vague enough to avoid committing Roosevelt to
maintaining the gold standard; and in his 1936 book Half Way with Roosevelt Ernest Lindley explains that the word
"gold" wasn't mentioned because "the silverites and other advocates of price-lifting by monetary action were strong
enough to keep it out." The fact remains, however, that "sound currency" is just a variant of "sound money," which
itself comes from the French "monnaie sonnante et trebuchante." This literally means "money that rings and
stumbles"; but it stands for full-weight or standard, as opposed to debased, precious metal coins, which actually
sound different than their debased counterparts when tossed onto and allowed to "stumble" on a hard surface. In
other words, to practically everyone who heard it in 1932, including banker James Warburg, who was to be one of
Roosevelt's more savvy financial advisors, and who felt bitterly betrayed by his decision to go off gold, the
Democrats' promise to preserve "sound currency" could mean nothing other than that FDR did not plan to toy with
the gold standard.

Once again: none of this is meant to deny that the platform did point clearly enough to some actual New Deal
measures, including its extensive public works program, the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of investment from
commercial banking, the TVA, unemployment insurance, and social security. But the anticipated bits almost all had
to do with relief and reform, rather than recovery. So far as the voting public was concerned, the New Deal's
recovery plan, to the extent that it was a plan at all, was a black box.

Nor is it the case that Roosevelt clarified matters by explicitly departing from any part of the platform. Instead, in his
nomination acceptance speech FDR said, "I have many things on which I want to make my position clear at the
earliest possible moment in this campaign. That admirable document, the platform which you have adopted, is
clear. I accept it 100 percent. ...And you can accept my pledge that I will leave no doubt or ambiguity on where I
stand on any question of moment in this campaign." While it certainly can't be said that FDR led a campaign free of
"doubt and ambiguity," he gave the public no reason to doubt that he meant to keep his word.

A Secret New Deal?

Nor, to judge from press reports, did the public doubt him. That is, they believed that the New Deal would be just as
the Democratic platform described it, and not a far more ambitious program that would radically depart from that
platform in many respects. Reporting just after the election, The Economist expressed a common opinion in saying
that it didn't

anticipate that any very radical experiments will be made. We doubt whether Mr Roosevelt, in any attempt which he
may make to lift America from the depression "by her own boot-jacks," will succeed in evolving measures very
different from those formulated and applied during the past two years by Mr Hoover. ("The New President,"
November 12, 1932).

Although it might have been expected to help the public to form a more accurate picture of the coming New Deal,
the interregnumthat is, the weeks separating FDR's election from his inaugurationwas marked by increasing rather
than diminishing doubts as to just what the president-elect had in mind. With just three weeks to go before FDR
took the oath of office, The Economist (February 11, 1933) observed that "The market has tacitly suspended action
and judgment until the new Roosevelt administration has assumed office and declared its policy on major
questions" (my emphasis). It would, of course, have been perfectly unnecessary for the incoming administration to
"declare its policy on major questions" had FDR "campaigned on a clear and specific New Deal Program" all along.

                                                                                                         Page 5 of 6
                     THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 2: INVENTING THE NEW DEAL

That he didn't, and that the specifics of the actual New Deal would often run counter to FDR's less-vague campaign
pledges, raises two possibilities. One is that there really was no well-worked-out New Deal plan, as Raymond
Moley and Frances Perkins insisted. The other, which we must also consider, is that there was such a plan,
blueprinting more-or-less what took place, but that FDR kept it under his hat. This last possibility appears especially
plausible with respect to FDR's plans for the dollar. After all, if FDR did in fact intend all along to suspend the gold
standard and eventually devalue the dollar, he could hardly have revealed these parts of his plan in advance!
During the campaign Hoover repeatedly accused FDR of harboring plans to abandon the gold standard in favor of
"fiat money"; and by the closing weeks of Hoover's presidency many had begun to suspect that Hoover might be
right. Were they just falling for Hoover's FDR-bogeyman, or had Hoover been onto something after all?

The answer is a little of both. FDR wanted to keep his options open. ''I do not want to commit to the gold standard,"
he told Brains Trust member Adolf Berle a few days before the election. "I haven't the faintest idea whether we will
be on the gold standard on March 4th or not; nobody can foresee where we shall be.' "This was an astute position;
but it spoke not of a definite plan for gold but of the folly of trying to formulate any such plan.

And that seems to have been FDR's position all along. Having carefully looked into the matter, Sebastian Edwards
concludes

that during the primary and presidential campaigns, neither Roosevelt nor his inner circle had a strong view on gold
or the dollar. ...Tinkering with the value of the currency was a possible area for experimentation; but it was an option
with a relatively low priority. ...Until inauguration day FDR's views on the gold standard were ambivalent and
noncommittal; he was neither a diehard fan of the system, nor was he a severe critic.

Nor, Edwards adds, had the Roosevelt team undertaken or commissioned any "studies that examined in detail what
would be the possible consequences of abandoning the gold standard." In short, while FDR may have
contemplated abandoning the gold standard, he certainly hadn't planned on it. What's more, nothing changed
during the interregnum: "To put it simply," Edwards says, "on March 4th, the day Franklin Delano Roosevelt was to
take over as President, there was no concrete or definitive plan for taking the U.S. off gold and devaluing the
dollar."

What was true of FDR's secret plans for the dollar was almost certainly true of his other secret New Deal plans,
namely, that he didn't have any. That is, there is no reason to disbelieve what Francis Perkins, Raymond Moley,
and most historians have had to say on the subject.

***

To conclude: "New Deal" rhetoric and revisionist histories notwithstanding, FDR didn't come to Washington
equipped with any well worked-out plan for ending the Great Depression. Instead, his recovery plan was mostly
rushed together during his famous first 100 days in office. That some components of this hastily-assembled
program should have failed to contribute to the recovery, and that some may even have hindered it, should not
seem all that surprising. But this is merely speaking of probabilities. I still have to prove that certain New Deal
programs did in fact impede recovery, and did so enough to justify the claim that, taken as a whole, the New Deal,
considered as a program for economic recovery, was a flop.

domestic allotment was itself the one agricultural production-control policy expressly ruled-out by the Democratic
platform, the fact that Roosevelt may also have ruled out others can hardly be reckoned an instance of his having
offered voters a "clear and specific" indication of what he would do once in office. What happened in fact is that
Henry Wallace, upon becoming Roosevelt's first secretary of agriculture, disregarded the Democratic platform's
condemnation of the domestic allotment ideawhich had been put in it by then Tennessee Senator (and future
secretary of state) Cordell Hulland instead based the AAA on the Republican platform, which among other things
had called for "control of [agricultural] production to such volume as will balance supply with demand," where
"demand" was understood to mean domestic demand alone. (See former Iowa Senator Smith Brookhart's May 22,
1938 letter to Cordell Hull, here at pp. 292ff.) The story is complicated by the fact that while many Republican
Senators and Congressmen, as well as some Farm Board officials, favored a domestic allotment plan, Hoover
himself vehemently opposed it while favoring a voluntary alternative. The Republican platform left room for either
option.

ONE BIG GIFT that South Africa can give itself is doing things out of the conventional to create a new economy,
even if it means upsetting the highly favoured international investors.

The reality is that for many years now, all efforts aimed at growing the economy haven't worked and unemployment
remains stubbornly high.

The International Labour Organisation's ILO-Stat database in 2019 puts South Africa's unemployment rate in the
same category as that of the troubled West Bank and Gaza (29.9percent). Now at 29.1percent as per the latest
indicators, this means that the number of unemployed people in South Africa is higher than that of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (4.3percent), Libya (17.3percent, Syria (8.2percent), Zimbabwe (4.9percent) and Afghanistan
(1.5percent). Of course, these figures are nonsensical to say the least.

Admittedly, South Africa has its own challenges, but over the past 25 years the government has increased the
number of people with access to social security and other basic services, like water, electricity and housing.

In addition, the National Development Plan sets ambitious targets for various socio-economic indicators, including
the economy and employment, that must be achieved in less than ten years from now. Yet, when one zooms at
unemployment alone it appears all the effort has gone to waste.

Nonetheless, it is important to emphasise that both the economy and unemployment are not moving in the desired
direction. It looks like the down spiral will not stop any time soon. At the rate things are going, unemployment will
exceed 60percent percent and the economy will not exist.

There comes a time when estimates for both these indicators will not be of any interest to anyone. The biggest
concern though is that there appears to be no serious thought invested in turning around the present situation.
Market-driven effort has been a huge disappointment.

Obsession with right-wing economic interventions such as cutting government spending, labour reform and
privatisation could be a bigger problem than the problems the country faces at the moment.

                                                                                                Page 2 of 5

                                    jobs is more like a raw deal for citizens

Structurally, South Africa appears not to be doing itself justice with its "two economies" structural make-up. The
reality is that the gross domestic product (GDP) figures, for example, are mostly based on the economic activity in
the formal economy.

A large part of the economy in townships and rural areas is not included in the basket of goods. Reluctance to
incorporate the "informal economy" and rural areas to the broader economy is not helping at all. That could be the
first problem.

Another problem is that unlike the GDP, which tends to focus on the formal economy, unemployment appears to
include both Sandton and rural South Africa.

The assumption of statisticians and economists is that there is no economy in rural areas. So, not so much effort is
put into understanding what exactly is driving the country's expansive rural settlement besides remittances and
social grants.

Nonetheless, indices for economic activity - in the form the GDP and employment - tend to focus on the previously
whites-only areas and their contribution to a section of the economy. Perhaps these figures would look slightly
different than how they are presented had they been more inclusive and less politicised.

With all said, the unemployment problem exists in South Africa and therefore requires undivided attention from
everyone.

Besides the private sector's reluctance to invest in the South African economy, an argument is thus put forward that
the government has generally been lost at sea in terms of seeking genuine solutions to the problem of joblessness.

It has also shown reluctance in using all the tools at its disposal, be they economic or otherwise, to bring down
unemployment. These include monetary and fiscal policies, public procurement and large-scale public works
programmes (PWPs). PWPs at present form could be a waste of time for everybody; another approach is,
therefore, more than necessary.

One of the arguments that is often disregarded in the ongoing debate on the nationalisation of the SA Reserve
Bank concerns what the US Federal Reserve Bank has done well in the past: using central banking instruments to
stimulate the economy. The US has faced two serious economic meltdowns in the past: the Great Depression in the
1930s and the Great Recession in 2008. In both instances, the state jumped in and rescued the economy by using
its institutions, legal frameworks and instruments.

The same approach appears lacking in South Africa, whose unemployment and low growth will persist well into the
future.

What the government announced in 2018 as an economic stimulus is a pittance when contrasted with the US
interventions, both in terms of resources and effort.

The present situation therefore presents a lifetime opportunity not only to reinvigorate the economy but also to
introduce overall, drastic structural changes of the economy.

But this requires a change in mindset by dumping neo-liberal thinking and adopting an intensely statist approach. If
the US and other economies could successfully intervene in the economy, what stops South Africa from doing the
same? This is not just about money but all the capabilities the country has, from policy framework to the state
machinery.

In the past two years there has been talk about a "new deal" plan to revive the ailing South African economy, but
this was more like water vapour. A case is therefore made for South Africa to learn from the US experiences in the
1930s and late 2000s.

                                                                                                Page 3 of 5

                                    jobs is more like a raw deal for citizens

When the US economy collapsed around 1930, President Franklin D Roosevelt introduced the "New Deal", which
dramatically expanded the federal government's role in the economy in response to the Great Depression. These
actions were designed "to bring about immediate economic relief as well as reforms in industry, agriculture, finance,
water power, labour, and housing, vastly increasing the scope of the federal government's activities".

To this day, the New Deal remains one of the biggest economic plans by a government, not even the Marshall Plan
in Europe after WWII comes close. In fact, without a revived US economy the Marshall Plan wouldn't have existed.

Nevertheless, the New Deal basically promoted "the concept of a government-regulated economy aimed at
achieving a balance between conflicting economic interests." From March to June 1933, the US government
enacted legislation that aimed at addressing the banking crisis, unemployment and weak industrial performance,
among other problems.

In what was called an "alphabet soup", many laws and institutions were born, including the Agricultural Adjustment
Act (subsidies to farmers), Federal Emergency Relief Act (relief to state employees), Securities and Exchange
Commission (oversight and regulation to the stock market), and National Recovery Act (wage-setting and collective
bargaining).

The US-based Khan Academy argues that the New Deal was based on the Keynesian economic school of thought.
Keynesianism states that "government spending that put money in consumers' hands would allow them to buy
products made in the private sector."

Even more so, this approach allows the government direct involvement in the economy to shape many outcomes,
including employment, social security and housing, among others. It was not until the 1980s under Ronald Reagan
that many of the gains from the New Deal were reversed.

As a result of "Reagonomics", the US has poor regulation of wages, working hours, collective bargaining rights and
social security system.

When the economic crisis struck once more in the late 2000s, the US Federal Reserve was available to again
provide relief to the American economy. In February 2009, the US Congress signed the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act of 2009, which was a stimulus package to respond to the financial crisis.

According to the estimates of the Congressional Budget Office , the government spent about $831billion
(R12.56trillion) between 2009 and 2019.

What is regrettable though is that the developed nations and global financial institutions tend to treat South Africa
different in as far as it tries to resolve its present economic problems. When the likes of the European Central Bank
and the Bank of Japan bought stock in large struggling corporations, this move was applauded.

In the case of South Africa, state owned enterprises (SOEs) have a broader role in society, so it makes sense to do
all that is possible to save them. As recent as January 2019, the International Monetary Fund said South Africa's
economic growth was being weakened by bailouts without offering alternatives.

Again, the rationale behind the recent stimulus package in the US was based on the Keynesian economic theory
which states that at times of recessions the government "should offset the decrease in private spending with an
increase in public spending in order to save jobs and stop further economic deterioration".

Audaciously, what Finance Minister Tito Mboweni calls the "new economic recovery strategic plan" seeks to
achieve the opposite: retrench state workers, reduce government spending overall, privatise SOEs and raise taxes.

As the saying goes: "Holy Moley!"

Raymond Moley was one of US President Franklin Roosevelt's most heeded advisers, who coined the term "New
Deal".

                                                                                                Page 4 of 5
   Jobs, economic growth dream fading? The present approach of assuming markets will grow the economy and
                                    jobs is more like a raw deal for citizens

The New York Times explains that Moley later turned his back on the progressive policies due to "a too-radical"
trend the New Deal was taking. Left-leaning politicians like Mboweni and scholars are simply too afraid to lead the
way and now, like Moley, they are conservative and timid.

In all fairness, no plan will ever turn around the economy within the present institutional and legislative frameworks.
South Africa suffers from bureaucratic collectivism - it is administration to no end and is without fresh ideas.

The stale ideas and sight of conservative economists close to the National Treasury can only spell disaster of
highest proportions. A developmental paradigm is needed to support a developmental state, not just in words but in
deeds.

The present laissez-faire approach which assumes that markets will grow the economy and create jobs is more like
a raw deal for citizens who expect change in the structure of the economy.

Government intervention in the economy can be a mix of simple solutions and complex ones.

'Recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment
of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride and
place and personal profit. And there must be an end to conduct in banking and in business which too often has
given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing."

Strong words, indeed. Do they come from the lips of President Bush? Or congressional reformers? Or district
attorneys prosecuting executives from Enron, WorldCom and their ilk?

No. The words are from Franklin D. Roosevelt's first inaugural address, delivered March 4, 1933, when the nation
faced an economic crisis even worse than the one in which it is mired today.

That was the speech that included the now-famous and oft-quoted aphorism, "The only thing we have to fear is fear
itself."

It was an inaugural address offering hope to the hopeless, rivaled only by Lincoln's inaugural and the first delivered
by George Washington. Author Davis Houck, professor of communications at Florida State University, says it was
even more important judging from the thousands of responses FDR received, which Houck read researching this
concise new book.

"FDR and Fear Itself" is a vivid and readable recounting of the circumstances that led to the inaugural address, as
well as a study of how and why the speech was put together.

The unsung hero was Raymond Moley, a professor who had become close to Roosevelt before the 1932
presidential election and who joined his staff as speechwriter and aide, part of the administration's first "brain trust."
Houck writes that Moley was the chief architect of the address, with contributions from FDR and the president's
close confidant, Louis Howe.

Moley's contributions were substantial and, in many quarters, still unrecognized. FDR "definitely wanted to take
credit" for the inaugural, and some historians (notably James McGregor Burns) have virtually written Moley out of
his part in the preparation. This book offers the restorative to that view. (It was, however, Howe who came up with
the familiar line about "fear.")

                                                                                         Page 2 of 3
         SPEAK SOFTLY AND CARRY A BIG SPEECH; FDR's inaugural address offered hope to a nation

The drafts that preceded the address are discussed fully, and to flesh out the arrival of Roosevelt in Washington to
begin his term, Houck adds sketches of FDR and wife Eleanor and their lives before the election. These will help
some readers better understand their complex relationship, though the account occasionally veers toward the
melodramatic.

Houck's style is lively and his focus dramatic in narrative; this is no turgid history, as the subject might suggest. It
relies heavily on Moley's voluminous papers and letters -- he apparently was something of a pack rat -- though the
author said he does a "bit of surmising based on historical materials at various places in the manuscripts."

The address, only 1,929 words, is worthy enough to be included twice in the 166 pages of the book. Its passages
again seem to reflect directly on our own times, as when Roosevelt called a restoration of civilization to "ancient
truths," adding, "The measure of that restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than
mere monetary profit."

To which Houck appends this note: "Somewhere in the bold and determined delivery, the carefully worded policies,
the assertive and clear statements, the ringing indictments and the promise of immediate action, the American
people found reason again to believe, to hope, and to see beyond the landscapes of their own immediate future."

Franklin D. Roosevelt's first inaugural address and John F. Kennedy's inaugural are rightly remembered as among
the best speeches presidents have given to commence their terms. FDR's admonition that "the only thing we have
to fear is fear itself" and his confident, calming tone soothed the jangled national psyche at a critical moment.
Kennedy's singing imagery of a new generation of Americans coming to power with a spirit of self-sacrifice ("Ask
not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country") inspired the nation and set the tone for
his administration.

But the two speeches have something more in common: a secret history, or perhaps a history of secrets.

It starts with two men sitting in the library of a mansion in Hyde Park, N.Y., one evening in February 1933. A bright
fire roared in the fireplace, and they sipped whiskeys. Franklin D. Roosevelt, the president-elect of the United
States, sat at a folding card table, poring over two manuscripts. The first was a typed speech draft. The second was
a handwritten copy that Roosevelt was laboriously writing out on a yellow legal pad. A third document, a letter from
Thomas Lamont of the JPMorgan & Co. giving a dire warning of the condition of the nation's banks, also lay on the
table.

"How do you spell foreclose?" FDR asked his companion, Raymond Moley. A Columbia University professor of
public law, Moley had piercing eyes and would sometimes smoke a heavy, dark pipe. He had known Roosevelt
since the 1928 gubernatorial campaign and in those years had become a close aide and his principal speechwriter.
The two men had been talking since the previous September about what Roosevelt might tell the country when
elected president. And now, with less than a week before FDR would be sworn in (the 25th Amendment, moving the
inaugural from March 4 to January 20, would not take effect until the 1936 presidential elections), Moley had
brought a draft of the speech to Roosevelt.

FDR had read it over carefully and then noted that he had better copy it out by hand: His aide, Louis Howe, was
due to arrive at Hyde Park the following day and would "have a fit" if he suspected that anyone else beside FDR
had worked on the speech. Howe, 5 foot 4 and weighing less than 100 pounds with a hollow, pitted face, was
nicknamed "the Medieval Gnome." He had been a political mentor to FDR and devoted aide who was territorially
jealous of other assistants getting too close.

So, FDR had started copying out the speech, editing as he went. The two men talked through every sentence,
occasionally mulling each word, as Roosevelt moved through the speech. There were interruptions--incoming
Treasury Secretary Will Woodin telephoned, as did incoming Secretary of State Cordell Hull. Sometimes, the

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4
                   JFK, FDR, and the Secret History of How a Great Inaugural Address Is Written

Roosevelt-Moley conversation wandered. Gripped by the notion of witnessing history, Moley pulled out his
notebook at one point and scribbled some notes: "A week--yes, five days--this man will be Pres. of the U.S."

Sometime past midnight, they finished. Moley rose from the long couch on which he had been sitting, took his
typed draft from the table and tossed it onto the still-glowing embers in the fireplace. "This is your speech now," he
told his boss.

FDR had that sort of ownership in mind more than Moley knew. The handwritten draft is on file at the FDR
Presidential Library at Hyde Park, with a typed note from the president attached to it explaining that it is "the
Inaugural Address as written at Hyde Park on Monday, February 27, 1933. I started in about 9.00 P.M. and end at
1.30 A.M. A number of minor changes were made in subsequent drafts but the final draft is substantially the same
as this original."

Moley is pointedly omitted from this account, conjuring an image of FDR writing his great speech alone. And it is an
image that held for more than three decades until Moley, incensed, published a White House memoir (his second)
setting the historical record straight.

FDR's ploy also met its immediate goal as well. Howe arrived the next day and gave the speech an edit of his own,
dictating a version with a new first paragraph, which included the exhortation that "the only thing we have to fear is
fear itself."

Flash ahead nearly three decades. On Jan. 17, 1961, a Convair 240 twin-engine plane named the Caroline after its
owner's daughter, flew north from Florida to Washington. The owner, President-elect John F. Kennedy, sat with
Time magazine reporter Hugh Sidey in the private section of the plane's cabin, a yellow legal pad in front of him, a
few paragraphs scratched out in his impenetrable handwriting. "It's tough," JFK told Sidey, referring to the process
of drafting an inaugural address. His farewell address to the Massachusetts legislature had gone so well, Kennedy
told Sidey, that it created a tough standard to meet.

Sidey watched the president-elect, stunned. How was it possible that with only three days before the transfer of
power, Kennedy was still working on the first draft of his speech?

In fact, a near-finished version of the speech was elsewhere on the plane, typed up.

JFK had first met his speechwriter, Ted Sorensen, in 1953 when Kennedy was putting together his Senate staff. At
first glance, they appeared an unlikely pairing. Sorensen hailed from Nebraska and came from a GOP family. He
was, home-state friend William Lee Miller later wrote, "not a Harvard man or an Easterner or a Catholic or an
Irishman or a hereditary Democrat, or a political middler or culturally sophisticated or rich or an aristocrat or an
urbanite or an intellectual dilettante or widely traveled or weak on the civil-liberties side or primarily interested in
Why England Slepttype of foreign affairs or a master of the Ivy League casual style or anything at all of a playboy.
He was instead, insofar as these things have opposites, somewhere near the opposite of all of them."

Nevertheless, by the 1960 presidential election, the pair had become a remarkable collaborative speechwriting
team. Sorensen later credited the years leading up to that election, when he and Kennedy traveled the country
together laying the groundwork for the race, as having helped give him such a clear sense of JFK. "Those three and
a half years of traveling the country together made an enormous difference," Sorensen said. "There were all kinds
of press stories--some of them exaggerations--about how I was inside his mind, could finish his sentences, knew
what he was thinking before he said it. Well, I think maybe there is something to that. That's a tremendous
advantage for a speechwriter to know his boss's mind as well as I did."

Kennedy and Sorensen first discussed the inaugural address in the weeks after the 1960 presidential election.
Kennedy told Sorensen to read all the previous inaugurals ("undistinguished," Sorensen thought) and the
Gettysburg Address, whose genius Sorensen was tasked with figuring out. (Sorensen concluded that in the speech
Lincoln "never used a two- or three-syllable word where a one-syllable word would do, and never used three words
where one word would do.") He read other great speeches like Pericles's Funeral Oration. He solicited suggestions
from the likes of Adlai Stevenson and John Kenneth Galbraith.

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 4
                   JFK, FDR, and the Secret History of How a Great Inaugural Address Is Written

By the time JFK flew from Washington to Palm Beach on Jan. 10, 1961, Sorensen had prepared a six-page typed
draft of the speech that roughly followed the final address's outline and had early versions of several of the
memorable sections. "So let the word go forth to all the world--and suit the action to the word--that this generation
of Americans has no intention of becoming soft instead of resolute, smug instead of resourceful, or citizens of a
second-rate power," the draft read. In the final speech that section would become: "Let the word go forth from this
time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in
this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to
witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to
which we are committed today at home and around the world."

"So, ask not what your country is going to do for you," the draft read. "Ask what you can for your country."

Using the Sorensen draft, Kennedy dictated a new version to his secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, adding key concepts
like a generation "born in this century--tempered by war" and a willingness to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet
any hardships, support any friend, oppose any foe."

JFK passed the next several days at La Guerida, his father's Spanish Revival mansion in Palm Beach. He worked
back and forth with Sorensen, who was in Washington, on the speech while wrapping up other preparations for his
administration, mixing in rounds of golf and a generous amount of tanning. Jacqueline Kennedy later recalled
hearing the address in "bits and pieces" over the course of the week. Sorensen flew down to Florida on January 16
and joined Kennedy, Sidey, and others for the flight back to Washington.

When he played at writing a first draft for Sidey, JFK could not have known he was echoing FDR: Ray Moley's
account of his involvement with Roosevelt's first inaugural address would not be published for another five years.

In both cases, the presidents-elect had an eye toward history, toward ensuring that they alone received full credit
for their inaugural addresses. JFK in particular had already been stung by allegations that someone else
(presumably Sorensen) had authored Profiles in Courage. At moments of less immediate historic import, both men
took a more generous attitude regarding acknowledging their speech collaborators.

But in a larger sense, both men missed the point regarding authorial credit. Moley and Sorensen were not writing in
vacuums or for themselves. They were reflecting the men who would give the speeches. And regardless of who first
committed what word to paper, it is the president who delivers the speech who owns it and deserves full credit for it,
for better or worse: The president puts himself and his credibility behind a speech, imbues it with his authority and
office.

And while sentiments like having only to fear fear or placing country before self have appeared in different ways
over the centuries, we recall these specific moments not only because of phrasing but because the words matched
the men and both suited the broader historical moment.

MELISSA BLOCK, host:

This is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED from NPR News. I'm Melissa Block.

ROBERT SIEGEL, host:

And I'm Robert Siegel.

Tonight, the Museum of Broadcast Communications in Chicago honors a famous political phrase that was first
coined on this date in 1932. Seventy-five years ago, the Democratic National Convention was meeting in that city. It
nominated the then-governor of New York, Franklin Delano Roosevelt. In his acceptance speech, Roosevelt
promised America a new deal.

And as independent producer John McDonough tells us, that phrase was never intended to be quite so memorable.

JOHN McDONOUGH: It was not an original or stately phrase. It had appeared without notice in the works of Henry
James and Mark Twain. And just before the 1932 Democratic convention, the new republic began a series of
articles called "A New Deal for America." In those days, it was considered unseemly to want to be president. So
navigating the intrigues of the process was something the wise candidate left for others to do on his behalf.

For Roosevelt, this was the job of two men: Louie Howe and Jim Farley, the gregarious point man who did the
legwork, the handshaking and the bargaining on the convention floor. Roosevelt listened at a polite distance from
Albany over the radio. This is what he heard after his name was placed in nomination.

Unidentified Man #1: Franklin Delano Roosevelt (Unintelligible) as the candidate of the presidency of the United
States.

McDONOUGH: But he was not the only Democrat who wanted to be president. As the nominations drowned on,
Howe listened, worked the phones, and one by one picked off Roosevelt's opponents with promises of position for
some, exile for others.

Unidentified Man #2: The honorable Harry Flood Byrd.

McDONOUGH: The price of Byrd's support was a seat in the U.S. Senate. The fact that Virginia already had two
Democratic senators was not a problem for Howe. Senator Claude Swanson would simply become secretary of the
Navy.

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3
                                                The Birth of 'New Deal'

Mr. CLAUDE SWANSON (Former Democratic Senator, Virginia): For the needs of humanity, I give to this
convention the name of Alfred E. Smith.

McDONOUGH: Smith would bet his entire political future against Roosevelts, make no deals with Howe, and walk
away with nothing.

Unidentified Man#3: The democracy of Texas presents her more distinguished son, John F. Garner.

(Soundbite of cheering)

MCDONOUGH: Garner came to Chicago with the support of William Randolph Hearst and enough Texas and
California delegates to put Roosevelt over the top. When Howe offered Garner the vice presidency, history struck
Roosevelt on the fourth ballot. William McAdoo of California sprang the switch.

Mr. WILLIAM McADOO (Former Democratic Senator, California): I would like to see Democrats fight Republicans
and not Democrats. California, cast 44 votes for Franklin D. Roosevelt.

McDONOUGH: With that, Texas flipped and the deed was done. According to tradition, the candidate was now
obliged to wait several weeks in silence for formal notification of his nomination. It was a pretense as leisurely as it
was obsolete. Roosevelt had quietly told his inner circle that if he were nominated, things would be different. A
month before Chicago, he had asked Raymond Moley to have an acceptance speech ready by the convention.
Moley's first draft was finished by the third week in June.

Meanwhile, Louie Howe was quietly working on an acceptance draft of his own, one he refused to share with
anyone including Roosevelt. As the convention rumbled on in Chicago, Roosevelt and his speechwriter, Sam
Rosenman, polished the Moley draft in Albany. On Friday, July 1st, Rosenman scribbled out a concluding
paragraph. He may have had the current new republic story in mind when he jotted the phrase down for the first
time.

I pledge myself, he wrote, to a new deal for the American people. He saw nothing remarkable in it and penned it in
lower case. That night, Roosevelt was nominated.

Unidentified Man#4: Franklin D. Roosevelt, having received four of the two- thirds of all the delegates voting
(unintelligible) the nominee of this convention for president of the United States.

McDONOUGH: The next morning, in an extraordinary gesture, Roosevelt boarded an airplane in Albany, flew
through a barricade of thunderstorms and set down on a gravel runway in Chicago. During the nine-hour flight, his
Garner was being nominated for the vice presidency at the convention. He and Rosenman edited the Moley draft
and a secretary typed the finished copy.

But when the plane landed, Roosevelt found an awkward surprise waiting for him - Louie Howe and that 12-page
acceptance speech he had never laid eyes on. Howe was Roosevelt's oldest and most intimate advisor. He could
not disregard his advice or his feelings. During the motorcade at the convention hall, Roosevelt quietly weighed the
two drafts against his debt to Howe. By the time he reached the Chicago Stadium, he had tactfully slid the first page
of Howe's speech on top of the Moley-Rosenman draft.

President FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT: I regret that I am late, but I had no control over the winds of heaven.

McDONOUGH: Reading Howe's words, he told the convention why he had come to Chicago and made it symbolic
of what to expect.

Pres. ROOSEVELT: The appearance before a national convention of its nominee for president is unprecedented
and unusual. But these are unprecedented and unusual times. Let it also be symbolic that in so doing, I broke
traditions. Let it be, from now on, the task of our party to break foolish traditions.

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 3
                                               The Birth of 'New Deal'

McDONOUGH: The message was clear. Roosevelt's campaign was off and running while the Republican nominee
was still waiting to be told he had been nominated. Roosevelt paid tribute to Woodrow Wilson, then moved into his
planned text. Moley and Rosenman breathed more easily as they heard the familiar rhythms of their words emerge,
words that would mark the Democratic Party for decades to come.

Pres. ROOSEVELT: Ours must be a party of liberal thought, of planned action, of enlightened international outlook,
and of the greatest good to the greatest number of our citizens.

McDONOUGH: After 45 minutes, Roosevelt came to the final paragraph, the one Rosenman had written in Albany
the morning before. He gave it only modest emphasis, preferring to save his rhetorical thrust for the final call to
arms.

Pres. ROOSEVELT: I pledge myself to a new deal for the American people.

MCDONOUGH: He used the phrase new deal only once. But if Roosevelt missed its symbolic potential, reporters
did not. In a text of nearly forty-four hundred words, they spotted it immediately and tabbed it for stardom. The next
morning, the Chicago Tribune singled out the phrase in a headline. Other papers flagged it in their leads.
Cartoonists turned it into a label. Soon, it became shorthand for everything the party stood for. Within 10 months,
reporters started writing it in upper case. And by the end of the first 100 days a year later, the words new deal had
become the most powerful political brand of the 20th century.

For NPR News, this is John McDonough.

Body


In 1939 Raymond Moley, a onetime member of Franklin Roosevelt's "brain trust," published a memoir charging
that his ex-boss had been ruinously captured by leftists. When Republicans used Moley's tract to attack FDR, the
president privately muttered that Moley had "kissed a-- and told."

Ronald Reagan's former budget director David Stockman took on his old boss by writing in a 1986 memoir that
Reagan, then serving his second term, had been "misled" into letting deficits explode: "What do you do when your
president ignores all the palpable relevant facts and wanders in circles?" Democrats said that Stockman's book
proved that they had been right all along: the emperor had no clothes.

Richard Clarke's new book, "Against All Enemies," is the latest entry in the category of hostile memoir by a
presidential appointee. Over the years, these books have tended to be written out of a desire to avenge, expose or
lament--or some combination of all three.

Some memoirists have been handpicked presidential aides who feel betrayed by their chiefs (like John Dean,
author of "Blind Ambition"); others are cabinet members with reputations of their own to protect. Forty years ago,
the aggrieved usually waited for their presidents to leave office before opening fire; in recent years, they're more
likely to strike while the game's still in progress. But few have enjoyed the kind of notoriety commanded by Clarke,
who's gone overnight from anonymous bureaucrat to best-selling author.

Anger is a motive as old as time. Fired Bush Treasury secretary Paul O'Neill vented his in "The Price of Loyalty,"
the memoir-by-proxy written by Ron Suskind. Reagan's ousted secretary of State, Alexander Haig, published
"Caveat" in 1984, while Reagan was running for re-election. Haig's screed made it clear that he felt he should have
been president rather than Reagan, whose White House, Haig said, was a "ghost ship" with no one at the helm.
When Reagan canned his chief of staff Donald Regan during the Iran-contra affair in 1987, Regan stormed out of
the White House and signed his own book contract. ("It couldn't end this way. I won't be a scapegoat.") It was too
late to inflict serious political damage on the president (Reagan was about to leave office) but in his 1988 volume--
imaginatively titled "For the Record"--he huffed and puffed hard to embarrass the old man. The book's chief
contribution to history was to expose Mrs. Reagan's astrologer.

Other memoirists have written out of genuine sadness. Some diehard Clintonites portrayed George
Stephanopoulos's "All Too Human" (1999) as an act of betrayal, but the book was actually a judicious lament that

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 2
                                         The Books: The Kiss-and-Tell Club

Bill Clinton had not become the president he might have been. In 1962 Emmet John Hughes's "The Ordeal of
Power" offered a similar lament about ex-President Eisenhower, for whom Hughes had written speeches. In those
more genteel times, Eisenhower was outraged that a staff member would dare to write such a book only a year
after his presidency had ended.

Most recent presidents have worried about the danger of a book-writing defector in their entourage. At the start of
his presidency, John Kennedy made his household employees sign pledges that they would not write about what
they saw. Jackie Kennedy feared White House aides who "hit the White House with their Dictaphones running." As
his adviser Arthur Schlesinger Jr. recalled, JFK told his staff he didn't want them "recording the daily discussions of
the White House." (Kennedy later recanted when he realized that the CIA and Joint Chiefs would be keeping their
own such records, which might not be flattering to him.) JFK told one friend he wondered who might turn out to be
his own Emmet John Hughes. The Paul O'Neill and Richard Clarke episodes may lead future presidents to be even
more inhibited than they already are in asking aides for unvarnished advice.

As furious as presidents and their loyalists may be about such books when they appear, they may take comfort
from one thing: years later, when historians write biographies and histories, the angry memoir will be only one voice
in the mix.

The following information was released by the Cato Institute:

George Selgin

In The Money Makers, his 2015 book on the New Deal and its aftermath, Eric Rauchway says that FDR "conducted
an active monetary and fiscal program of recovery...working along lines suggested by Keynes." His book's subtitle
in turn declares that between them, "Roosevelt and Keynes ended the Depression." Other popular accounts
likewise declare that "[t]he beliefs of Keynes and FDR proved successful at alleviating the Great Depression" and
even that "Without John Maynard Keynes, FDR's New Deal may never have happened."

In this series, in contrast, I've argued that, instead of ending the Great Depression, the New Deal did relatively little
to counter it, and, in some ways prolonged it. Readers who share the popular understanding of Keynes's influence
upon New Deal policies will therefore conclude that I also consider Keynesian economics a failure. But they'd be
wrong, for a very simple reason: despite what one reads everywhere, the New Deal was not particularly
"Keynesian," and was in some ways quite un-Keynesian.

According to Rexford Tugwell (1957, p. 290), the Columbia economics professor who was a member of FDR's
original Brain Trust, "the Keynesian myth" (as he styles it) first became fashionable in the later 1930s, as the
General Theory began to sweep the board of macroeconomic thought. It was later reinforced by Roy Harrod's Life
of Keynes (1951)though Harrod admitted, in a 1950 letter to Dennis Robertson, that he'd deliberately exaggerated
Keynes's influence on Roosevelt's policies because "in the mind of the general public you have to have One Man.
There isn't room for more." Rauchway's more recent effort appears to reflect a similar awareness of popular
psychology.

Tugwell dismisses the claim that Keynes influenced FDR's thinking, or that Keynes otherwise played an important
part in shaping New Deal policies. Another New Dealer, Leon Keyserling, who served as an attorney for the AAA,
and helped draft some other major New Deal legislation, does as well, though in starker terms: "With all due respect
to Keynes," he wrote in 1972, "I have been unable to discover much reasonable evidence that the New Deal would
have been greatly different if he had never lived, and if a so-called school of economics had not taken on his
name."

That Keynes the man played hardly any part shaping those New Deal policies that came retrospectively to be
described as "Keynesian" is only part of the truth. It's also true that, had Keynes's advice, or that of many American

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 7
                      THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 15: THE KEYNESIAN MYTH

economists who independently favored those policies, actually been taken, the Great Depression would have taken
a far different, and less destructive, course.

Brains and Keynes

Any account of Keynes's role in shaping New Deal policies should begin with an appreciation of two facts. The first
is that, despite his stature in Great Britain, Keynes was not well known in the United States until after he published
the General Theory in 1936. The second is that, far from feeling any need to seek advice from a British economist,
FDR came to office accompanied by a corps of advisors unmatched by any other in the history of the U.S.
presidency.

Historians of the New Deal have found it convenient, if perhaps never entirely accurate, to divide FDR's many
advisors into various factions. All agree that the most important of these were the "planners," led by Tugwell, and
the "trust-busters," led by Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter. As the name suggests, the trust-busters' ideal
was something like economists' notion of "perfect competition," which they hoped to more closely approximate by
breaking-up large corporations and banks. The planners, in contrast, had nothing against large-scale enterprises: to
their way of thinking, competition was more dangerous than desirable, and the trust-busters were hopelessly out of
touch. Rather than try to do away with big business, the planners merely wanted to transfer control of it from
businessmen to bureaucrats like themselves, who would manage it rationally, in the public interest, instead of just
trying to make a buck.

As diametrically opposed as their ideals were in many respects, these factions had at least one important belief in
common: both treated the Great Depression "less as a problem to be solved than as an opportunity to be exploited
for radical surgery on U.S. business and finance" (Best 1991, p. 11). Nor was it obvious how either of their
programs, which predated the depression, would help end it. The generally-held verdict, that these reforms "never
contributed much to economic recovery" (Hawley 1966, p. 15), should therefore not come as a surprise. Nor should
it be necessary to add that such reforms bore only an incidental relation to policies aimed at enhancing aggregate
spending that later came to be identified with "Keynesian" economics. The simple truth is that, when it came to
fiscal and monetary policy, most of FDR's closest advisors, including members of the original Brain Trust, simply
weren't "Keynesians," even in a loose sense.

This isn't to say that FDR received no "Keynesian" advice. Besides the trust-busters and planners, a third group of
advice-giversthe "inflationists"also influenced his thinking. This groups most influential members, neither of whom
was a genuine New Dealer, were Irving Fisher and Cornell agricultural economist George Warren, the latter of
whom gained an important ally in Henry Morgenthau, FDR's second Treasury Secretary. Though they were fiscal
conservatives, Fisher, Warren and Morgenthau favored suspending the gold standard and otherwise trying to raise
prices by means of what may loosely be called "monetary" policy. Expansionary fiscal policy, and particularly large-
scale spending on public works, had their own New Deal proponents in Frances Perkins, Harold Ickes, Harry
Hopkins, and Marriner Eccles. But calling the policies these New Dealers favored "Keynesian" is one thing; claiming
that their advocates were actually influenced by Keynes is quite another. In fact, there's no evidence that any of
them came to think as they did because of Keynes.

Until The General Theory made its big splash in 1936, Keynes's own arguments appear to have impressed only
one of FDR's close advisors: trust-buster Felix Frankfurter. In the fall of 1933, Frankfurter on sabbatical to England
where, in early December, after visiting Keynes at Cambridge, he encouraged him to write the open letter published
in the New York Times later that year. Keynes gave Frankfurter an advance copy, which Frankfurter sent to
Roosevelt on the 12th (Edwards 2018, pp. 1-2). If Tugwell (1957, p. 404) is right in saying that FDR "never...read
anything Keynes wrote, except perhaps some newspaper pieces commenting on his [Roosevelt's] own actions,"
that letter would have been one of Roosevelt's first helpings of Keynes's own advice. But the letter didn't impress
him. "You can tell the Professor," Roosevelt told Frankfurter in reply, "that in regard to public works we shall spend
in the next fiscal year nearly twice the amount we are spending in this fiscal year, but there is a practical limit to
what the Government can borrow." From that terse reply and other evidence, William Barber (1996, p. 83)
concludes that Keynes's pleas "had little impact on Roosevelt's thinking."

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 7
                     THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 15: THE KEYNESIAN MYTH

Nor were the two men's minds ever to really meet. Their disharmony was especially evident when, in May 1934, the
men themselves met for the first and only time. To judge by the impressions each shared with Frances Perkins after
their one-hour meeting, that event, which Frankfurter hoped would establish a rapport between them, was
unsuccessful. "I saw your friend Keynes," Roosevelt said. "He left a whole rigmarole of figures. He must be a
mathematician rather than a political economist." Keynes, for his part, told Perkins that, though he admired the
President very much, he expected him to be "more literate, economically speaking." According to Arthur
Schlesinger (1960, p. 406), Keynes later told Alvin Johnson, the New School's director who was himself an
economist, "I don't think your President Roosevelt knows anything about economics." However much the men may
have respected one another, so far as economic policy was concerned, each might have spoken a foreign language
that the other couldn't understand.

The Wrong R's

As Tugwell (1970, p. 103) points out, FDR's "less than enthusiastic" response to Keynes's advice was due, not to
his being unpersuaded by it, but to his belief that Keynes was merely telling him "to do what he had already been
doing for some time'." But was he?

Keynes himself certainly didn't think so. One purpose of his open letter was to encourage FDR to spend moremuch
moreon public works, and to finance that spending by borrowing more instead of raising taxes. As we'll see, Keynes
was quite right to think that FDR needed such encouragement. But that wasn't all: Keynes also disapproved of
much that FDR had "already been doing." Among other things, Keynes questioned FDR's priorities, wondered
whether he was quite sure what he was doing, and called some of the advice he was taking "crack-brained and
queer."

Regarding priorities, Keynes believed that of Roosevelt's had two of his "three R's"Reform, Relief, and Recoveryout
of order. Instead of making Recovery his administration's first priority, Keynes told the president, he was "engaged
on a double task, Recovery and Reform," whereas he ought to defer reform until recovery was achieved. Keynes
was especially critical of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), a brainchild of the "planners," describing it,
accurately, as a reform that masqueraded as part of a plan for recovery while actually impeding it. He called some
of the advice FDR was taking "foolish," while comparing the gyrations in gold's price that those policies were
abetting to "a gold standard on the booze." In short, while Keynes applauded FDR's willingness to reject orthodox
policies in favor of "bold experimentation," he believed he'd chosen the wrong experiments, while clinging to some
of the most obstructive orthodoxies.[1]

Nor was Keynes less critical when, not long after meeting FDR in 1934, he once again shared his thoughts with The
New York Times, this time in the shape of some brief "notes" on the New Deal. Here Keynes again took aim at the
NRA, objecting to its "excessive complexity and regimentation," and especially to its "impractical and unnecessary"
attempts to regulate prices. He noted as well the lack of business confidence, "for some of which the administration
may be to blame." (And how!) And he complained that, despite a temporary boost, the government was still not
spending, or not deficit-spending, enough. Keynes repeated many of these complaints, more trenchantly, in a
February 1, 1938 letter to the President.

Even such a cursory review of Keynes's public and private remarks on the New Deal should suffice to call into
question Eric Rauchway's claim that he "staunchly defended the New Deal through 1933, and continued to do so
into 1934." Keynes admired Roosevelt's boldness. He particularly applauded his decision to abandon the gold
standard. He also approved of some of the reforms his administration was pursuing as long-term reforms. But in
1933 and 1934, Keynes's verdict on the New Deal as a program for recovery was, on the whole, negative. And he
made no bones about it.

Anchors Aweigh

Of all the steps Roosevelt took during his first year in office, none pleased Keynes more than his decision to
abandon the gold standard. But much as Keynes, who had famously condemned the gold standard as a "barbarous
relic" in his 1923 Tract on Monetary Reform, welcomed that decision, he had nothing to do with it.

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 7
                      THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 15: THE KEYNESIAN MYTH

That the gold standard might eventually have to go was a possibility FDR recognized as early as October 1932,
when he wisely chose not to mention the topic in his campaign speeches. "I do not want to be committed to the gold
standard," he privately explained to his aides at the time. "I haven't the faintest idea whether we will be on the gold
standard on March 4th or not; nobody can foresee where we shall be."

On the eve of the inauguration, FDR and his advisors still hadn't given up on the gold standard. According to
Sebastian Edwards (2017, p. 3), although they considered "tinkering with the currency," they viewed doing so as
"an option with a rather low priority." Events, more than economic doctrine, were to ultimately seal the gold
standard's fate: the banking crisis, which had been triggered by a run on the dollar, compelled Roosevelt to restrict
both gold exports and domestic ownership of gold, while gold's subsequent appreciation, which FDR would
eventually encourage through his gold purchase program, put paid to any prospect of a restoration of the dollar's
former gold value.

Had FDR wished to permanently devalue the dollar all along, he didn't need to turn to any British economist to gain
an expert's approval of that decision. Days before the inauguration, Irving Fisher, who was then, according to
Joseph Schumpeter, the United States' "greatest scientific economist," urged FDR to begin his presidency by
announcing that the United States was abandoning the gold standard in favor of a "managed currency." That step,
Fisher maintained, "would reverse the present deflation overnight and would set us on a path toward new peaks of
prosperity" (Barber 1996, p. 25). But FDR wasn't yet prepared to go that far. Instead, he settled for his March 6th
Bank Holiday proclamation suspending both gold exports and internal gold paymentssteps that could hardly be
avoided since gold withdrawals were about to exhaust the New York Fed's reserves. Subsequent Executive Orders
extended and reinforced these prohibitions until, on April 20th, FDR issued a proclamation formally suspending the
gold standard.

FDR's next, major step away from the gold standard consisted of his "bombshell" cable of July 3rd, 1933, effectively
withdrawing his support for the currency stabilization goals of the World Economic Conference then being held in
London. The other participating nations hoped the United States would cooperate with them to restore the
international gold standard, with the system of fixed exchange rates that went hand-in-hand with it, by agreeing to
stabilize the then free-floating gold value of the dollar. Though it was understood by then that the dollar would be
devalued, the thought was that, by working together, the assembled delegates could avoid "competitive"
devaluations that might delay the gold standard's revival, if not prevent it altogether. The United States' withdrawal
left FDR free to devalue the dollar as much as he liked, or to let it keep floating forever.

Keynes's role in FDR's decision to not support the conference's currency stabilization agenda has been
exaggerated. He approved of the bold steps Roosevelt took during the Bank Holiday, and his decision to officially
let the dollar float that April. He also understood that Roosevelt was prepared to permanently devalue the dollar if
that would help to raise the U.S. price level. Keynes believed that FDR's willingness to devalue the dollar made his
cooperation crucial to any successful, international stabilization plan. "[T]here is one man in the world," Keynes
wrote in the Daily Mail that June, who seems to take seriously the business in hand to which others do not more
than pay lip service, namely, President Roosevelt, [yet] we are all talking as though that man is defeating the
alleged objects of the conference" (Rauchway 2015, p. 70). But it doesn't follow that it was Keynes who convinced
FDR to torpedo the conference.

As far as I'm aware, the only evidence for that claim consists of Raymond Moley's (1939, p. 236) statement that
FDR's thinking had been "greatly influenced" by Keynes's 1930 Treatise on Money. But that statement, which
Rauchway (2015, p. 51) takes at face value, simply isn't credible. For one thing, Moley contradicts himself, saying
elsewhere (1939, p. 225n20; my emphasis) that FDR's views "seemed to approximate those" found in the Treatise,
which means something altogether different. It's also highly unlikely that FDR, who had little patience for abstract
thought, and who Tugwell says hardly read anything by Keynes, either had or took the time to read Keynes's
longest and most abstruse work!

But the most important reason for doubting Moley's claim is simply that there's nothing in the Treatise that could
possibly have inspired FDR's July 1933 decision. Although it's true that, in his Tract on Monetary Reform, Keynes's

                                                                                                          Page 5 of 7
                      THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 15: THE KEYNESIAN MYTH

disparaged attempts to restore the then dismantled gold standard, by 1930 "the facts had changed," and so had
Keynes's thinking. "Today," Keynes wrote in the Treatise''s second volume (1930, p. 338),

the reasons seem stronger...to accept, substantially, the fait accompli of an international standard... . For to seek
the ultimate good via an autonomous national system would mean not only a frontal attack on the forces of
conservatism, ...but it would [sic] divide the forces of intelligence and goodwill and separate the interests of nations.

Such words could hardly have inspired FDR to "torpedo" the London conference! Nor are there any other passages
in the Treatise that might have done so.

Instead, the experts whose views almost certainly informed FDR's decisions were Fisher and, above all, Warren.
Although Fisher, like Keynes, was never one of FDR's official advisors, unlike Keynes he corresponded with FDR
often, and met with him on numerous occasions, throughout the New Deal. Between late February and early June
1933 alone Fisher sent Roosevelt no fewer than seven letters, all addressing the currency question. In a March 2
letter, he wrote that "The present situation in currency cries to heaven for reflation (up to a reasonable price level
about half way back) and, after such reflation, for stabilization" (my emphasis).[2] According to Barber (1996, p. 33),
just before the London conference began, Fisher wrote again, advising FDR that the U.S. "should not wait for action
by other countries, nor make our action dependent on theirs, nor tie up our standard to theirs irrevocably." The
cable's endorsement of "efforts to plan national currencies with the objective of giving those currencies a continuing
purchasing power which does not vary in terms of commodities" might have been written by Fisher himself, who
long favored the idea.

Warren also urged Roosevelt not to commit to any definite plan to stabilize the dollar. Ever since Roosevelt took
office, Warren had been trying to win him over his theory that, as the price of gold rose, so would other commodity
prices. After Roosevelt let the dollar float, commodity prices started to rise rapidly, while gold depreciated, in
apparent confirmation of the theory. Then, when it seemed that the United States was going to please Britain by
stabilizing the dollar, gold depreciated, and prices fell. Between them, these events and Warren's advice played an
important role in convincing FDR to resist getting "trapped" (Warren's term) by any proposal to stabilize the dollar's
gold value while commodity prices were still well below their pre-depression levels. The Committee for the Nation, a
lobbying group (a sympathetic source, on which this paragraph draws, describes it as a group of bankrupt farmers,
businessmen, bankers, and cooperative leaders) to which both Fisher and Warren belonged, joined them in
advising Roosevelt against tying the United State's hands.

In short, U.S. experts appear to have done all the persuading necessary to get Roosevelt to fire off his July 3rd
cable. Keynes's welcome but minor contribution consisted solely of the support he gave to FDR after the fact, by
publishing an article in the Daily Mail declaring him, by its title, "Magnificently Right."

Sober Advice

While Roosevelt's withdrawal from the London conference left little doubt that the old gold dollar was history, it
offered no clue as to where its gold value would settle, or even whether it would settle anywhere, rather than
continuing to float. Nor does Roosevelt himself seem to have known yet. Instead, he sought further advice. But
once again he turned for it to U.S. experts, not to Keynes. Some advice came from Fisher and from one of Fisher's
many students, Yale economist James Harvey Rogers. But it was George Warren's thinking that ultimately
prevailedand Warren was certainly the least Keynesian of the bunch.

Warren's theory, which he and Frank Pearson developed on the basis of mere extrapolation from the past, posited
a more-or-less mechanical link connecting the dollar price of gold to the price of agricultural and other commodities.
According to it, a sufficient devaluation of the dollar, however achieved, was sure to deliver on FDR's promise to
restore the prices of farm products to their 1926 level. Warren's theory thus inspired FDR's ill-fated gold buying
spree.

But apart from convincing FDR himself, Warren's theory won few converts either in or outside of the Roosevelt
administration. Henry Morgenthau bought it. "Foolish" and "nonsense" were the brusque opinions of James
Warburg and Rex Tugwell, respectively; and their view seems to have been closer to the general consensus among

                                                                                                        Page 6 of 7
                       THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 15: THE KEYNESIAN MYTH

economists. (Even Fisher, whose views superficially resembled Warren's, insisted that raising gold's price alone
wouldn't raise other prices: monetary expansion was needed to get people to spend more.) By February 1934,
when FDR and Morgenthau quit buying gold, and fixed the dollar's official gold content at 59 percent of its former
level, these critics had every reason to feel vindicated, if not to gloat: the wholesale price index was only three
percent higher than it had been at the start of the gold buying program in October 1933.[3]

Whether he gloated or not, Keynes was among Warren's most unsparing critics. In his December 1933 open letter,
it was Warren's theory that he considered "crack brained," observing that it rested on a "set of fallacies." Instead of
supposing that gold's appreciation would cause higher prices, Keynes told FDR, he ought to have gotten both gold's
price and those of other commodities up by other means, and then devalued the dollar accordingly. Because the
gold purchase program put the gold depreciation cart before the price-raising horses of expansionary monetary and
fiscal policy, its main result consisted, not of higher equilibrium prices, but of those disturbing "gyrations of the
dollar" that seemed to Keynes "more like a gold standard on the booze than the ideal managed currency of my
dreams."

In view of Keynes's harsh remarks, it seems a real stretch to suggest, as Eric Rauchway (2014, p. 58) does, that
"[i]n the general outline of his beliefs, Warren had support from John Maynard Keynes." In truth, it was Warren's
opinions rather than Keynes's that Roosevelt heeded. But as Roy Harrod understood, once one discerns that, in the
mind of the general public, "you have to have One Man," a little truth-stretching is hard to resist.

                      THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 15: THE KEYNESIAN MYTH

__________________________

[1] Keynes's rejection of much of the thinking behind the NRA and AAA predated the New Deal. In "The Raising of
Prices," one of several letters he published in the London Times and The New Statesman in March 1933
(republished in the U.S. as The Means to Prosperity), Keynes called "the idea of raising prices of commodities by
restricting their supply," with which Neville Chamberlain, then England's Chancellor of the Exchequer, had then
been flirting, "worse than useless." Instead of serving to diminish employment, he said, "it is, rather, a method of
distributing more evenly what employment there is, at the cost of somewhat increasing it." According to Elliot Rosen
(2005, p. 80), FDR's longtime friend Viscount Astor sent advance copies of Keynes's letters to the White House. Of
FDR's reaction to these, assuming he read them, there's no record. In any event, one doubts that Keynes would
have been impressed by Raymond Moley's claim that in criticizing the NRA he "missed" the fact that it was not
primarily concerned with increasing production, but with spreading work."

[2] In his discussion of the failure of the London conference in Stable Money: A History of the Movement (1934, pp.
351-2), Fisher attributes it to the irreconcilable difference between the desire of delegates from several countries,
including France and England, to see their currencies' exchange rates with the U.S. dollar stabilized before taking
steps to raise their national price levels, and Roosevelt's desire to reflate the U.S. price level before entering into
any agreements to stabilize the exchanges. Roosevelt's preference was, of course, the position Fisher had himself
urged him to take prior to the conference.

[3] Despite its apparent failure in the 30s, and the many economists who disparaged it then and since, Warren's
theory still has its adherents, including Scott Sumner, who (besides defending Warren) offers a nice summary of the
difference between his and Fisher's thinking. Sumner himself draws on Sebastian Edward's fine account of FDR's
gold policy, and the economists who influenced it, in American Default.

They had worked together for years in remote areas of the bureaucracy, sorting out the esoterica of American trade
policy.

When they saw each other again last week, drawn by the commemorations of the 50th anniversary of the signing of
the Reciprocal Trade Act of 1934, they couldn't stop talking about the old days.

They were the assistant secretaries and ranking officials of the State, Commerce and Agriculture departments who,
as a group, conceived and formulated American trade policy in the 1930's and 1940's.

They met at a black-tie dinner sponsored by Consumers for World Trade, a lobbying organization; at a luncheon at
the Arts Club given by Walter Hollis, formerly of the State Department and one of its top legal minds on trade; and
in the Dirksen Senate Office Building at hearings called by Senator William F. Roth Jr., Republican of Delaware, to
discuss world trade half a century after the seminal legislation.
A 'Feisty' Hull, a 'Piqued' Peek

Familiar names fell from the tongue - Cordell Hull, Raymond Moley, Clair Wilcox, George Peek, Henry A. Wallace,
Franklin D. Roosevelt.

Out came the anecdotes: ''Cordell was a feisty man.'' ''George Peek resigned in pique.''

Prof. Richard N. Gardner of Columbia University, who has served in Democratic administrations, recalled the two
opposing versions of a speech on trade that Roosevelt was to give in the fall of 1932.

One came from the free-trader Mr. Moley, the other from the protectionist Mr. Peek. Both later became members of
the Roosevelt brains trust.

''Weave the two together,'' Roosevelt ordered his advisers, and out came a predictable, oratorical pushmi-pullyu.

But by 1934, thanks to the efforts of Mr. Moley and Secretary of State Hull, a former Senator from Tennessee, the
Administration had embarked on a course of opening up world trade after the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of
1930.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3
                          THE BUREAUCRACY; EXERTS ON TRADE RELIVE THE 1930's

Seeds of Postwar Prosperity

Until 1934, Congress set the tariff schedules. The results were an almost steady rise to the historic high of 60
percent after the 1930 measure.

Many say the Smoot-Hawley act was the major factor in the global depression of those years.

Under the Reciprocal Trade Act, signed by Roosevelt June 12, 1934, Congress delegated negotiating authority to
the President to seek reductions with other countries.

That began a long process of trade expansion that was to become the engine of postwar prosperity.

Willis C. Armstrong, who worked for many years in the State Department, recalled an episode at a luncheon at the
Arts Club that illustrated much of the trade thinking of the day. President Hoover was campaigning for his second
term. The campaign train pulled into Chester, Pa., home of the Scott Paper Company.

As he had at previous stops, Hoover asked an adviser what the principal product of Chester was. The reply: toilet
paper.

In his speech from the rear platform of the campaign train, Hoover, with great oratorical flourish, said that what this
country needed more than anything else was a big increase in the tariff on - toilet paper.


Time and Party Switches

The United States Trade Representative, Bill Brock, repeated the story at a dinner at the International Club,
sponsored by Consumers for World Trade.

He said it was the reason his grandfather, a Senator from Tennessee who strongly opposed Smoot-Hawley, was a
Democrat.

But Mr. Brock noted that the positions of the parties had changed dramatically, with Republicans espousing free
trade and Democrats espousing protection. Walter F. Mondale has strongly supported protection for the automobile
and steel industries.

''That's why I'm a Republican today,'' said Mr. Brock, who confides that more than anything else, he would like to
debate Mr. Mondale on trade policy.


A Truman Era 'Disaster'

J. M. Colton Hand, who used to write letters for Cordell Hull, reminisced about battles in 1947 to try to sell Congress
on an International Trade Organization that could enforce fair trade practices.

Major trading nations had already negotiated creation of the institution. Congress opposed American participation.
It feared the United States would be giving up too much sovereignty.

Yet, according to Mr. Hand's account, the Administration of Harry S. Truman made a major tactical error.

''We went through the House Foreign Affairs and Senate Foreign Relations Committees instead of Ways and
Means and Finance,'' he said.

''The Foreign Affairs guys didn't have the vaguest notion of what foreign trade was all about. We couldn't educate
them to come to a meaningful decision. It was a disaster.''

TOTAL OVERHAUL NEEDED TO FIX ILLINOIS TAX SYSTEM

Crain's April 26 editorial, Tinker with a broken tax system? No, let's fix it'' was right on the mark.

Illinois' tax system has been broken for some time. We just didn't notice. During the past couple of years, the reality
of the inadequacy of the Illinois tax system has become painfully evident. Unfortunately, several politicians and
editorial pages have proclaimed that the only cure is to cut spending. Others would lead us to believe that we can
borrow our way out of the hole. (My Dad used to tell me that when I found myself in a hole, the first thing I should do
is stop digging!)

While we can all point to some state spending we believe of dubious value, by and large, Illinois lawmakers have
not been spendthrifts.

Are local school districts in financial distress because the Legislature has showered money on them? Is the reason
that part of our child welfare system is under court order to reduce caseloads because the Department of Children
and Family Services has too much money? Is the reason some nursing home operators have either closed or face
bankruptcy because of the state's timely and excessive Medicaid reimbursements? Is Illinois the biggest pension
deadbeat'' in the nation because of the extravagant, on-time state payments into the system?

The U.S. Census Bureau reports that in 2001, Illinois had the fewest state employees per total population of any of
the 50 states. Reportedly, state payroll has dropped another 10,000 persons in the past two years. Do we just have
too many freeloaders on the state payroll?

I think I see a pattern in these facts. Our tax system just isn't up to the task of meeting our real needs. Hopefully,
influential editorial pages such as Crain's will help our lawmakers find the courage to stop wrangling over fees'' and
caps'' and fix the total system for all of us.

Power's potential

U.S. Rep. William O. Lipin-ski's proposal to consolidate Metra and Pace, revamp the Regional Transportation
Authority (RTA) board and make the RTA chairman a true CEO has received mixed reviews in the local media,
including Crain's ( Lipinski is right on RTA but wrong on streetcar,'' April 14).

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 3

Essentially, the critics fear potential abuse of power by a larger, more centralized transit agency, while endorsing
the idea of a simplified agency able to sell a single pass good for trips on all buses and trains.

A simplified fare card should not be seen as the sole reason for agency consolidation. Ticketing is not the real
problem. The real problem is that urgently needed projects are not getting built. A single mass transit organization
with a single empowered chief executive officer will enable the Chicago region to accomplish with mass transit what
the legendary Robert Moses accomplished in New York with highways, parks and bridges: Get things done.''

Anyone who has read Robert Caro's critical 1974 biography of Mr. Moses, The Power Broker,'' will note the
potential for abuse in a powerful position.

But Mr. Caro points out that potential abuse of power must be weighed against the civic and economic
impoverishment that follows the failure to apply power where it is needed. He quotes FDR brain-truster Raymond
Moley's observation that from the pyramids of Egypt, the rebuilding of Rome after Nero's fire, to the creation of the
great medieval cathedrals . . . all great public works have been somehow associated with autocratic power.''

Mr. Moley went so far to claim that pure democracy has neither the imagination, nor the energy, nor the disciplined
mentality to create major improvements.''

I hope Mr. Moley was wrong about democracy. I hope our system of government will rally itself to resume building
large public works while managing the perils of excessive power.

There is no better place to make this attempt than Chicago, where a booming, 21st-century economy is trying to
force unprecedented volumes of people and goods through a 1950s highway system, a 1970s airport system and a
19th-century railroad network and transit infrastructure. If a transportation czar'' gets us to a solution faster than the
current fragmented decision-making structure, more power to him.

By George Selgin

SHARE

"This great Nation will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. ...[T]he only thing we have to fear is
fear itself." FDR, in his first inaugural address.

"There is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain."Thomas Hobbes, on the state of nature, in
Leviathan.

Not the Sum of its Parts

So far, I've tended to look at the New Deal as a set or sequence of distinct government policies and programs,
remarking on how each either contributed to or hampered economic recovery. I've also dealt only with those New
Deal policies generally understood to have had promoting recovery as their aim.

But the New Deal was more than just a bunch of policies. As its very name indicates, it purported to be, and in
important respects it was, a novel policy regime, that is, a different overall approach to combating the depression,
and to economic policy more generally.

The advent of a new policy regime, and expectations or apprehensions it inspires, can have economic
consequences beyond those of any particular policies that march under its banner. Uncertainty regarding possible
regime changes can also have important economic consequences.

In this and the next installment to my New Deal series, I discuss the bearing of regime change, and regime
uncertainty, on the course of the recovery. As we'll see, although the arrival of the New Deal regime had some
beneficial effects beyond those attributable to any particular policies, the opposite was also true: in its later
manifestations especially, the new regime proved unsettling to businessmen in ways that, according to many,
prolonged the depression.

Great Expectations

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 6
                           THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 12: FEAR ITSELF

That the New Deal regime change initially had positive consequences has been cogently argued by Peter Temin
and Barry Wigmore. According to them, FDR

established a new macroeconomic policy regime shortly after his inauguration in March 1933. The Hoover
administration had been financially conservative, adhering to the rules of the gold standard and fiscal orthodoxy. Its
policy stance in the troubles of the early 1930s therefore, was decidedly deflationary. Roosevelt broke with this
ideology, devaluing the dollar within 6 weeks of his inauguration, promoting fiscal expansion, and championing the
virtues of inflationreflation as he termed it.

Roosevelt's actions, Temin and Wigmore go on to say, "marked a change in direction for government policies and
for prices in general." Unlike "isolated expansionary actions" that might be understood as "departures from what
was perceived as a long-term government policy," this change only had to be recognized by the public for that
public to alter its expectations rapidly. In his 2008 elaboration on the Temin and Wigmore thesis, Gauti Eggertsson
speaks of "an endogenous shift" in the public's expectations brought about by the new administration's willingness
to set aside "policy dogmas."

Whether the original New Deal really marked as complete a rejection of established "policy dogmas" as these
authors suggest may well be doubted. For one thing, as I noted previously, FDR campaigned on a commitment to
balance the budget, while assailing Hoover for not doing so. He also chose the extremely orthodox Lewis Douglas
as his first budget director. Still the point remains: the benefits of the New Deal, taken as a whole, could exceed
those of the sum of its parts.

Regime Uncertainty

But the opposite was also true. Even if one fully accepts the "great expectations" hypothesis, it doesn't follow that
the game-changing done by the New Deal had no dark side. The new regime's arrival and metamorphosis over the
course of the depression could also hinder recovery. In particular, Bob Higgs argues, it bred "pervasive uncertainty
among investors about the security of their property rights in their capital and its prospective returns," and this
uncertainty, Higgs says, was one reason why the depression dragged on.

Although "regime uncertainty" is Higgs's term for it, he recognizes that his hypothesis isn't new. It had more than a
few proponents during the depression years themselves, when people instead spoke of a lack of "business
confidence"; and numerous economists and historians have taken it up since.

One of the idea's early proponents was none other than John Maynard Keynes. Upon returning to England after his
desultory, May 1934 visit with FDR, Keynes published an "Agenda for the President" in the New York Times and
the London Times. He said in it that he saw "no likelihood that business of its own initiative will invest in durable
goods of sufficient scale for many months to come." Keynes offered several reasons for this pessimism, chief
among which was the fact that "the important but intangible state of mind, which we call business confidence, is
signally lacking." And the reason for that, he said,

is to be found in the perplexity and discomfort which the business world feels from being driven so far from its
accustomed moorings into unknown and uncharted waters. The business man, who may be adaptable and quick on
his feet in his own particular field, is usually conservative and conventional in the larger aspects of social and
economic policy. At the start he was carried away, like other people, by the prevailing enthusiasm. [But now] he is
sulky and bothered; and...even begins to look back with longing to the good old days of 1932.

Keynes went on to observe that FDR could help to dispel "this atmosphere of disappointment, disillusion, and
perplexity" by convincing businessmen that "they know the worst."

As we'll see, FDR didn't follow this advice; and some year later, in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (pp. 64-
5), Joseph Schumpeter did not hesitate to blame both "the subnormal recovery" up to 1937 and the slump that
followed on the "general change in the attitude of government to private enterprise" that came with the New Deal.
"So extensive and rapid a change in the social scene," Schumpeter wrote, "naturally affects productive performance
for a time, and so much the most ardent New Dealer must and also can admit.

                                                                                                               Page 3 of 6
                             THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 12: FEAR ITSELF

One ex-New Dealer who admitted it publicly was Raymond Moley. "Confidence," he says in his 1939 memoir, After
Seven Years,

is the existence of that mutual faith and good will which encourages enterprises to expand and take risks... And in
an age of increased governmental interposition in industrial operations...the maintenance of confidence
presupposes both a general understanding of the direction in which legislative and administrative changes tend and
a general belief in government's sympathetic desire to encourage the development of those investment
opportunities whose successful exploitation is a sine qua non for a rising standard of living.

This, Roosevelt refused to recognize (p. 373).

"Refused to recognize" is probably not giving FDR his due. He more likely understood that a lack of business
confidence discouraged investment and recovery, but chose to shake that confidence anyway to achieve reforms
he considered essential either for narrowly political reasons, or because he thought they'd yield long-run social
benefits exceeding their short-run costs.

Laid Low

Practically everyone agrees that inadequate investment held back the recovery. A glance at the chart below,
showing percentage changes in net and gross private investment and consumption spending since the start of
1929, should suffice to drive home just how little investment there was.

The first thing that's obvious from the chart is that, at just shy of ninety percent, the percentage decline in gross
investment was much greater than the percentage decline in consumption. As a share of GDP, gross domestic
private investment dropped from 16 percent to less than 2 percent.

The decline in net investment was even more severeso much so that it turned negative and stayed that way until
1935. Although it then turned positive again, on the eve of the '37 downturn, which saw it go below zero again, it
was still 40 percent below its 1929 level. Not until 1940 would it and the other measures shown in the chart return to
their original levels. For the full 1930-1940 period, net private investment added up to minus $3.1 billion. The
economy's private job-creating capacity suffered accordingly.

Yet this picture, dire as it is, doesn't tell the full story. That's so because the "investment" shown in it includes
unplanned additions to business inventories, which tend to accompany downturns, and other short-term
investments that aren't so sensitive to perceived regime changes. For a sense of what happened to planned,
longer-term investment during the depression, here's a chart showing the course of gross private investment in all
kinds of residential and business structures:

Here the inadequacy of the post-1933 recovery is still more evident than in the previous chart. Investment in
structures, like overall gross private investment, first falls to a tenth of its level at the start of 1929. But at the end of
the decade, after a period of slow recovery that was interrupted by the '37 crash, it is still less than half its 1929
level.

So long as investment failed to recover, recovery writ large could only go so far, and last so long. "The depletion of
capital," Kenneth Roose observes (1954, p. 12), "limited the number of workers that could be profitably employed."
That in turn meant that such gains in consumption spending as had been achieved lacked what W. L. Crum, R. A.
Gordon, and Dorothy Wescott called "sustaining momentum." "As recovery progressed," they wrote in assessing
the 1937 collapse,

the substitution for stimulated revival of a more normally balanced expansion, predicated upon long-run
undertakings by business leadership in an environment sufficiently secure from interference to justify assumption of
risk, was not facilitated.

If the regime uncertainty hypothesis is right, the trouble wasn't just that the New Deal failed to "facilitate"
investment. It was that it actually discouraged it.

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 6
                           THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 12: FEAR ITSELF

Guinea Pigs

The New Deal is said to have given businessmen and investors the willies in at least two ways. First, as its policy
innovations multiplied, with no apparent end in sight, and no telling what might come next, they no longer felt able to
plan for the future: a long-run investment that seemed worthwhile so far might, for all they knew, cease to be so with
the next new reform effort. Second, administration officials became increasingly ill-disposed toward businessmen,
and big businessmen especially, to the point where those businessmen feared deliberate attempts to deprive them
of their capital or already thin profits.

That the New Deal, instead of consisting of a coordinated set of previously-conceived policies, would involve trial
and error, was something Roosevelt foresaw and plumped for during his 1932 presidential campaign. "The country
needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation," he said in his
famous Oglethorpe speech that May. "It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and
try another. But above all, try something. The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the
things to satisfy their needs are within easy reach."

By the fall of 1932, few could have doubted that some experimentation was called for; and that only became more
obvious after the banking system collapsed on the eve of FDR's inauguration. Nor could anyone expect every policy
that was tried to succeed. But while FDR's willingness to innovate wasn't itself objectionable, instead of following
through by assessing his administration's experiments and discarding ones that failed, he tended, like certain WWI
generals, to treat each successful offensive as a gain to be preserved at all costs, as if it were indeed part of one
grand strategy.

Consequently, as the depression wore on, businessmen found themselves overwhelmed by new legislation, much
of which involved considerable, if not sweeping, changes to the rules for doing business, and to their property
rights. The following table, reproduced from Higgs (1997), lists only those "substantially attenuating or threatening"
those rights.

The year 1935, in particular, saw such a decisive shift of the Roosevelt administration's emphasis from recovery to
reform that it amounted to an entirely new regime changethe so-called Second New Deal. By means of the "gorge
of indigestible measures" enacted during it, Moley writes, the original New Deal "was completely transformed."
"The impact of these multitudinous measures," Chase National Bank economist Benjamin Anderson wrote a
decade later, "upon a bewildered industrial and financial community was extraordinarily heavy."

And Villains

1935 also witnessed a change in the Roosevelt administration's attitude toward businessmen.

During his 1932 campaign, Roosevelt spoke of the need for "cooperation" between the government and business;
and his administration's willingness to seek such cooperation was evident in its early conduct and policies. Even the
NIRA, before the introduction of the blanket code, reflected the administration's desire to rely upon what Moley calls
"cooperative business-government planning," and to reject the alternative of dealing with "private economic power
by smashing it to bits." Roosevelt understood, furthermore, that a lasting recovery depended on the revival of
private enterprise. In short, "he had no quarrel with business, as such. Certainly he did not regard it as an
enemy."[1]

But by the summer of 1935, FDR's disposition had changed dramatically. Riled by business organizations'
increasingly vituperative criticism of him and the New Deal; angered by the Supreme Court's striking down of the
NRA; egged-on by his Progressive advisors; and determined to win-over supporters of populist presidential
candidate Huey Long by stealing a march on Long's "Share Our Wealth" plan, Roosevelt unveiled his own plan for
reining-in plutocratsthe notorious "soak-the-rich" tax proposal.[2]

FDR made the proposal in a June 19th message to Congress, "Our revenue laws," he announced, "have operated
in many ways to the unfair advantage of the few, and they have done little to prevent an unjust concentration of
wealth and economic power." His first target was inherited wealth. Calling such wealth "inconsistent with the ideals

                                                                                                         Page 5 of 6
                            THE NEW DEAL AND RECOVERY, PART 12: FEAR ITSELF

of this generation," he recommended that, besides estate taxes, "an inheritance, succession, and legacy tax" for "all
very large amounts," as well as gift taxes to frustrate attempts to evade it.

Next came high incomes. Because "social unrest and a deepening sense of unfairness are dangers to our national
life," the Government, he said, had a duty "to restrict such incomes by very high taxes."

The final target was big business. "Vast concentrations of capital," FDR said, "should be ready to carry burdens
commensurate with their powers and their advantages." He therefore recommended "a corporation income tax
graduated according to the size of corporation income," to be supplemented (again as a check against evasion) by
a tax on intercorporate dividends. As if this then-unprecedented proposal might not upset businessmen enough,
FDR explained that he saw it as a half measure only. "Ultimately," he saidforeshadowing legislation to comehe
looked forward to both "the simplification of our corporate structures through the elimination of unnecessary holding
companies" and policies that would "discourage unwieldy and unnecessary corporate surpluses."

Roosevelt's recommendations came as a complete surprise to Congress: in his January 3rd budget message, he'd
advised against any new or additional taxes for the coming fiscal year; and deficits since then had been lower than
expected. But if his new suggestions surprised Congress, theyand his corporate tax proposals in particularthrew the
business community into what Ray Moley called "paroxysms of fright," unnerving it almost as much as the Supreme
Court's striking down of the NRA had cheered it in May. Taxes were, for the first time, being proposed for the
avowed purpose of redistributing wealth rather than raising revenue. The graduated corporate tax, in particular, was
understood to have no purpose save the dubious one of taxing bigness.

No good purpose, that is: the Philadelphia Enquirer considered it "an effective method of hampering re-
employment, preventing wage increases and delaying recovery." Right or wrong, the Enquirer was far from alone.
In its report on the Revenue Bill, the Senate Finance Committee recorded the minority opinion that the bill would be
better entitled,

A bill to confiscate property; to discourage business and prevent its expansion; to destroy incentive and discriminate
against ability, brain, and ambition, and enterprise; to create inequalities and to obstruct recovery; to jeopardize the
financial position of the government; and for other improper purposes.

Despite such protests, the revenue bill sailed through Congress that August with unseemly haste, aided by
Democratic super-majorities in both houses and congressional leaders' desire to carry out rather than question
FDR's wishes. Although higher estate taxes took the place of FDR's proposed inheritance and gift taxes, most of his
other suggestions, including the graduated corporate tax, were enacted, if only after some watering-down. "It
seems," an article in the staid AER opined, "that such a measure is important enough to justify more deliberate and
careful consideration than was given." Instead, "all serious opposition appears to have been bought off with
promises or bowled over by the huge Administration majority."

"There can be no denying," the AER article continued,

that the President's message was an attack on wealth. ...Nor can it be denied that the diverting of taxation from the
primary purpose of raising revenue to other major purposes involves great hazards. That there are tremendous
abuses that should be remedied can admit of no question. But how best eliminate the abuses and yet do a
minimum of harm; how best promote ingenuity, enterprise, economy, social security and all the other desiderata
becomes even more difficult with the growing complexities of modern industrial society.

It also becomes more difficult, the authors might have added, in the middle of a depression.

***

FDR's "war" with business didn't end with the August 20th passage of the Revenue Act. Several days later he
signed another law that many businessmen found even more disconcerting. And in 1936 his rhetoric, if not his
administration's legislation, would become still more ferocious. I'll take up the rest of the story of New Deal regime
uncertainty in the next installment to this series.

Although secrecy and loyalty have been bywords of the Bush White House, its officials have been improbably
loose-lipped upon leaving office, particularly in the memoirs they have written. So far, there have been exposes
from Paul O'Neill (Bush's former Treasury secretary), Richard Clarke (his onetime counterterrorism czar), David
Kuo (deputy director of the White House's faith-based initiative), L. Paul Bremer III (the former top civilian in Iraq)
and the foreign-policy hands John Bolton and Douglas J. Feith. Each of these books has been a record, to some
extent, of disillusionment, and all have excited a good deal of attention. But perhaps none have had the force of
''What Happened,'' the new memoir by Bush's former press secretary, Scott McClellan, which has zoomed to the
top of the best-seller lists (including the Book Review's) and brought fresh scrutiny to an administration that had
been all but invisible during this election season.

 The book's impact is all the more remarkable given how familiar its revelations are, whether it's McClellan's
crushingly obvious remarks about the administration's selling of the Iraq war, Bush's contempt for the press or Vice
President Dick Cheney's penchant for secrecy. As Joshua Green wrote in The New York Observer, ''For all the
hype on cable news shows and blogs, 'What Happened' adds almost nothing of value to the historical record.''

  What may, in fact, be most revealing about McClellan's book is not what it discloses about the head of state, but
what it says about the continuing devaluation of the political memoir as a literary form. Paradoxical though it may
seem, even as these books have become more accusatory, they have also become less illuminating. While they
were once useful and sometimes absorbing accounts of the inner workings of government at its highest levels,
these books now tend to be exercises in apostasy, and their primary purpose seems to be to confer intellectual and
moral independence, if not heroism, on their authors. ''Forty years ago, publishers had a pretty high standard for
who should write books,'' the historian Michael Beschloss, who is based in Washington, said in a telephone
interview. ''There were fewer books published. You had better possess some literary ability.''

  He has a point. The eulogistic memoirs of an earlier time were consequential, partly because their authors drew on
their own notes and diaries, which very few officials dare to keep in the scandal- and subpoena-driven Washington
of our time. Raw material of this kind enabled officials to wait before telling stories that still arrived with a sense of
immediacy. Henry L. Stimson's 1948 doorstop, ''On Active Service in Peace and War,'' published several years after
he ended his tenure as secretary of war, drew copiously on Stimson's personal papers. ''A Thousand Days,'' Arthur

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 3
                                                     'Not My Fault'

Schlesinger Jr.'s retrospective account of the Kennedy White House, relied heavily on Schlesinger's diaries. Dean
Acheson's masterly ''Present at the Creation'' was published in 1969, almost two decades after he left office. And
the first volume of Henry Kissinger's invaluable memoirs, ''The White House Years,'' did not appear until 1979,
when he was well out of government.

 How did we go from these cigar-and-brandy tomes -- often intended to burnish the reputations of their authors and
also those of the presidents they served -- to sensationalistic trifles like ''What Happened''?

  One answer lies in a less well-known but equally important countertradition, the dyslogistic school of memoir
written by former officials who present themselves as disillusioned innocents. A classic instance is Raymond
Moley's ''After Seven Years,'' published in 1939. Moley had been a charter member of Franklin D. Roosevelt's
brain trust but grew disenchanted with what he saw as the president's sharp turn to the left. Presaging Scott
McClellan, Moley brooded histrionically about his employer's failings: ''To say that I was sick at heart over what was
happening would be the epitome of understatement. I was also completely baffled. Was Roosevelt really ignorant of
the implications of what he was doing?''

  A later memoir of this kind is ''The Ordeal of Power,'' an insider account of the Eisenhower administration written
by Emmet John Hughes, a presidential aide and top speechwriter. Hughes depicted his boss as a passive leader
who had left the Republican Party in shambles. Like Moley's memoir, Hughes's was elegiac in tone and dealt solely
in high politics, with no hint of personal innuendo. But Eisenhower was incensed, and the specter of the memoirist
as turncoat worried his successor. John F. Kennedy ''wondered who in his entourage was going to become the
Emmet John Hughes,'' Beschloss said.

  The Reagan era brought something new, a flurry of score-settling memoirs published while the president was still
in office. Alexander M. Haig Jr., forced out as secretary of state in 1982, led the way with ''Caveat,'' which blamed a
clique led by the White House chief of staff, James Baker, for his downfall; labeled the White House as a ''ghost
ship''; and lamented that Reagan hadn't hewed more closely to -- what else? -- Haig's own advice. A more
inflammatory memoir was ''For the Record.'' Its author, Donald Regan, the chief of staff in Reagan's second term,
described Nancy Reagan's concern with her husband's image and reported that she was in thrall to a San
Francisco astrologer.

  Most revealing of all was the budget director David Stockman's book, ''The Triumph of Politics,'' with its complaint
that Reagan ''had no concrete plan to dislocate and traumatize the here-and-now of American society.'' Bill Clinton's
presidency also yielded memoirs that cataloged their authors' disappointments, most notably George
Stephanopoulos's ''All Too Human.'' Like Stockman, Stephanopoulos suggested that his boss was the flawed
instrument of grand ideals: ''I came to see how Clinton's shamelessness is a key to his political success, how his
capacity for denial is tied to the optimism that is his greatest political strength.''

  With the Bush administration, however, the memoir of aggrievement has emerged as a crowded genre. Why?
Perhaps because, as Walter Isaacson, the author of a biography of Kissinger and the president of the Aspen
Institute, told me, the Bush team took office ''trying to create complete control of the message as opposed to
serving the truth. In the end, that message discipline exploded on them. Now everyone's expressing their pent-up
desire to go off message.''

 Enter Scott McClellan, who was a small player, after all. He issued no orders, formulated no policy. He wasn't
even in the room when the big shots assembled, though he does report that after winning re-election in 2004, Bush
declared at a staff celebration: ''I especially want to thank Scott. I want to thank you for saying -- nothing.''

  In other words, McClellan wasn't supposed to function as a press secretary, but to impersonate one. Still smarting,
he has avenged himself by exercising the power of the powerless. He has gained the spotlight, if only for a few
days, and at the same time has distanced himself from his former brethren. ''What Happened'' is the latest product
of what Isaacson calls the ''it-wasn't-my-fault industry.'' And that industry is unlikely to halt operations anytime soon:
the former defense secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld is currently working on his memoirs.

                                                                                              Page 3 of 3

Highlight: How ghostwriting went from scandal-in-waiting to acceptable political reality

Body


In October 2007--the same month that Random House emerged from a four-day auction with a $9 million deal for
Tony Blair's memoirs--Robert Harris published his sixth novel, The Ghost. It centers on a cynical, self-aware
ghostwriter who must finish the memoirs of a former British prime minister. The PM, thanks to war crimes,
waterboarding, and other timely plot points, is laying low in America, but Harris spends more time skewering
publishers than politicians. He did his homework, interviewing real ghostwriters and pulling epigraphs from a
handbook by "Britain's foremost ghostwriter," and his novel makes for some biting (if predictable) satire. No wonder
Harris told National Public Radio, on the last day of his rather busy October, that he "just really was interested in
this phenomenon of the ghostwriter."

The main thing that interested NPR, and the novel's reviewers, though, was playing connect-the-characters with the
Blair administration. The Ghost certainly allows for this reading, and Harris handled the attention with the skill of
someone who'd been expecting it, smirking and demurring his way through round after round of sales-boosting
interviews.

Now it's happening again--this time to the recently released film version of Harris' novel, adapted by Harris and
director Roman Polanski and retitled The Ghost Writer. Polanski doesn't ease up on the publishing industry--that he
casts Jim Belushi as the publisher's CEO should tell you everything you need to know--but, yet again, context has
overpowered conceit. Last year, after decades on the lam, Polanski was arrested on charges of having "unlawful
sexual intercourse" with a young girl in 1977. He managed to finish The Ghost Writer under house arrest, but the
contours of its reception were set. (How many reviews start with something like: "A horrible crime, a scandalized
public figure, the specter of extradition--no, it's not Roman Polanski's life, it's his latest movie"? I'll take the over.)

In both book and film, it seems, Harris' inquiry into the ontology of ghostwriting never stood a chance. But that's just
as well since, on both sides of the Atlantic, people stopped worrying about ghostwriting a long time ago.

GEORGE WASHINGTON'S most famous speech, the Farewell Address (1796), wasn't actually a speech--it
appeared, over the course of a few weeks, in almost every American newspaper. The address wasn't
Washington's, either. Alexander Hamilton, with assists from Washington and James Madison, did most of the
writing.

                                                                                                         Page 2 of 4
                                                    Ghost Stories

In the years after Washington's death, readers continued to assume that the first president alone had written the
Farewell Address. By 1810, though, Hamilton's authorship was being noted in private letters and public gossip--a
legitimate piece of Antebellum undernews. Hamilton's wife, Eliza, desperately wanted to reveal her husband's role
in writing the address and, in doing so, to rehabilitate his reputation, but Hamilton's executor refused to give her the
draft that proved his authorship. So she sued him, at which point newspapers began speculating about the author of
the address. Jefferson, Madison, even the Historical Society of Pennsylvania weighed in, and the debate persisted
for decades. The prominent Philadelphia lawyer Horace Binney admitted in 1859 that the public, with its "deep and
undivided reverence" for Washington, "was unwilling to learn, that, even on an occasion of ceremony, he had worn
any vesture but his own."

Madison worried the Farewell Address would "lose the charm of the name subscribed to it," but he also knew that
Washington made "no secret to some that he occasionally availed himself of the friendship of others"--others, that
is, who could write. The affair didn't stop American politicians from turning to ghostwriters. Early examples remain
fairly infrequent and often anonymous, but this had less to do with the fear of scandal than with the fact that the
political world simply produced less prose.

This had all started to change by the election of Warren Harding, the first president to employ a full-time ghostwriter.
Judson Welliver wrote Harding's speeches, which H. L. Mencken famously compared to "a string of wet sponges,"
undetected. (Elsewhere, Mencken called Welliver "a journalist of the highest skill.") Yet within a few years, Time
magazine could clearly detail Welliver's duties as a ghostwriter to Harding and, later, to Calvin Coolidge. The Time
article focuses mostly on Welliver's successors, including F. Stuart Crawford, who "went under a cloud when it was
found that the Coolidge addresses, when dealing with geography and other indisputable facts, followed with a
striking literalness the text of the International Encyclopaedia."

While Coolidge decided to proceed without a full-time ghostwriter, he would be the last president to do so. This is
not to say that future presidents were ready to relinquish their shot at projecting a Washington-like image of solitary
genius. Franklin D. Roosevelt pioneered the ghostwriting-by-committee approach--historians still argue about which
aide coined the "new deal" phrase--but, for his first inaugural, he looked to one man: Raymond Moley. Moley
typed up a draft and, the next night, revised it with Roosevelt, watching as the president-elect copied it onto a legal
pad. When they finished, Moley threw his initial text into the fireplace and said, "This is your speech now." But FDR
took him too literally, adding, a month later, this note to his handwritten draft: "The Inaugural Address as written at
Hyde Park on Monday, February 27, 1933. I started in about 9.00 P.M. and ended at 1.30 A.M." The note makes no
mention of Moley, and historians continued recounting FDR's lonely night until Moley cleared things up in his own
memoir.

Moley wrote several memoirs, in fact--and, among FDR's ghostwriters, he was not alone in this. As books like
Charles Michelson's The Ghost Talks (1944) became best-sellers, they indicated that ghostwriting had moved
solidly into the mainstream. There were a few surly outliers like Walter Lippman, who argued that "no one can write
an authentic speech for another man; it is as impossible as writing his love letters for him or saying his prayers for
him." But most politicians, media types, and, above all, voters found themselves with more or less modern attitudes
toward ghostwriting. In 1952, American University started offering a course in ghostwriting, and it wasn't too long
before The Washington Post was subjecting the "boyish" James Fallows, Jimmy Carter's chief speechwriter, to the
same puff profiles it now does to Obama's top scribe, Jon Favreau.

SPEECHES ARE ONE THING, but audiences tend to hold books--even political books--to higher standards. The
division between these categories, however, has never been precise. Before today's clearly defined campaign
biographies and manifestos, the most popular way to kick off a campaign was with a collection of speeches,
previously ghostwritten, now compiled by anonymous aides. The rise of ghostwritten books also parallels the rise of
ghostwritten speeches. James Buchanan, a terrible president but a titan in the untold history of presidential
autobiography, had an assistant write his memoirs from dictation in 1867. (Buchanan died before they could finish.)
By 1927, when the Authors' League held a meeting on ghostwritten celebrity books, the consensus was that "the
public was at one time completely credulous on the point. Now it seems unlikely that it believes in any of the noted
athletes, singers or politicians who break out in print."

                                                                                                         Page 3 of 4
                                                    Ghost Stories

For readers, in other words, a political book's impact matters more than its authorship--and nowhere was this
clearer than during the postwar period, which saw a series of popular political books, all bestsellers, all instrumental
in shaping their authors' careers. Dwight Eisenhower's Crusade in Europe (1948), Barry Goldwater's Conscience of
a Conservative (1960), and Richard Nixon's Six Crises (1962) relied on ghostwriters to varying degrees; no one
cared. Jimmy Carter wrote Why Not the Best? (1975) without any help; no one cared about that, either.

In the midst of all this, of course, came John F. Kennedy's Profiles in Courage (1956). And while Kennedy's
authorship--or, more accurately, Ted Sorensen's authorship--became controversial, it was the book's Pulitzer Prize
that catalyzed the backlash. The problem wasn't ghostwriting; it was award-winning ghostwriting. Profiles in
Courage was, from the beginning, both a political boon and a popular success, with a serialization in The New York
Times Magazine and, a mere two weeks after its release, a television-adaptation deal. But the sniping at Kennedy's
authorship didn't start, in print, at least, until after--a mere eight days after--he won the Pulitzer on May 7, 1957.
Even Drew Pearson, the political columnist who dragged the issue onto the national stage, framed his accusation in
terms of the award: "Jack Kennedy," Pearson said on ABC's The Mike Wallace Interview, "is the only man in history
that I know who won a Pulitzer Prize on a book which was ghostwritten for him."

While Pearson couldn't recall his name on air, Sorensen used ghostwriting to acquire his own degree of celebrity.
(Sorensen also used it to get revenge: He wrote the retraction Pearson had to read on the next week's show.) It
makes sense that many successful writers have ghostwritten political books and speeches--and that even more
have used ghostwriting as a step toward broader success. Let's put an end to the absurdly resilient rumor that Mark
Twain ghostwrote Ulysses S. Grant's Memoirs, then note that the ghostwriting ranks have included George Bancroft
(he wrote speeches for James Polk and Andrew Johnson), Archibald MacLeish and Robert Sherwood (FDR), Doris
Kearns Goodwin and John Steinbeck (Lyndon Johnson), William Safire and Pat Buchanan (Nixon), Hendrik
Hertzberg and Chris Matthews (Carter), Thomas Mallon (Dan Quayle)--and Walter Lippmann, who prayed and
loved on behalf of both Woodrow Wilson and JFK.

IN OUR OWN AGE, ghostwriting has matured into a decorous, rule-bound discipline--lawyers and polite society
both recognize the difference between a book's "writer" and its "author," and one can draw similar (though less
precise) distinctions between byline language choices like "and," "as told to," or "with." If specific ghostwriters get
noticed, it is only as an extension of their client. Indeed, most recent attempts to scandalize ghostwriting reflect
partisan motives or divisive personalities more than any underlying anxieties about ghostwriting. When Hillary
Clinton opted not to thank her ghostwriter in the acknowledgments of It Takes a Village (1996), it became a mini
crisis; when Howard Dean repeated her mistake in Winning Back America (2003), only Newsweek noticed.

This selective outrage helps to explain the bizarrely detailed accusations, launched by right-wing bloggers late in
the 2008 election, that Barack Obama's Dreams from My Father (1995) was ghostwritten by Bill Ayers. In fact, the
Obama-Ayers example perfectly illustrates the state of ghostwriting today: Only the most partisan readers can
muster (or manufacture) any anger about it. If the bloggers were truly concerned about the demise of political
discourse, they might have compared Dreams to the muzzled style of The Audacity of Hope (2006)--and to the
latter's acknowledgments page, which nods to a whole focus group's worth of political allies, including Favreau.

The bloggers were never concerned about this--nobody is. It's too late to save Harris and Polanski from the
collective shrug that greets ghostwriting. But what about Blair? His autobiography, The Journey, arrives this
September, and he and Random House insist he's writing it without any help. Someone should get him a
subscription to The London Review of Books, in which a recent review laid into the new historical book written by
Blair's successor, Gordon Brown, for making mistakes "a competent ghostwriter might have avoided." At least, the
reviewer snarked, "our new prime minister should be able to fend off any doubts about authorship."

Citing the lowering of the ''misery index'' - that addition of the unemployment rate to the inflation rate - Leonard Silk,
economics columnist of The New York Times, wrote: ''Mr. Reagan could have some reason to regard himself as a
shoe-in.''

Judy Westerman of New York assumes that shoe-in is a typographical error for shoo-in, and wonders if writers will
not turn to other up-to-date phrases of finality like carved in stone or made in the shade. But when queried, Mr. Silk
does not take refuge in the old typo excuse (which has grown difficult since word-processing terminals have made
us our own typesetters).

''I used shoo-in to mean 'a walkaway, an easy win,' '' says my colleague, who is known to lexicographers as the
coiner of double digit. ''I don't know why I spelled it shoe-in. I just bought some shoes.'' It could be that this
misspelling, a frequent one, is influenced by shoehorn, a verb meaning ''to insert into a difficult space'' or ''to fit in
with difficulty.''
William Safire article on use of slang metaphors, mispronounciation of Halloween and misuse of word schism;
drawing (M)

Slang metaphors change their meanings as they are applied in different fields. Mr. Silk's political meaning, ''easy
win,'' is accurate; in racing, however, where the term originated, the term retains a more sinister meaning. To shoo
is a centuries-old colloquialism for ''to urge a person or animal to move in a desired direction.'' Back in the bad old
days, corrupt jockeys would form a ''ring'' and bet on a single horse, holding back their own mounts while they
''shooed in'' the winner. In a horseracing shoo-in, the winner is the only horse trying to win; that corrupt connotation
does not apply in politics.

In a related development from the world of in-and-out, this letter from Judge Theodore Trautwein of the Superior
Court of New Jersey: ''The other day my law clerk told me that she had really lucked out on the purchase of her new
car. I asked her if she was happy with the deal. She was indeed!''

The appellate jurist poses the slanguistic issue: ''When things go bad, one is 'out of luck' and vice versa. Hence, I
would have employed the expression lucked in under her circumstance.'' He requests my ruling.

The judge is going by the book: in the Dictionary of American Slang, lucked out is defined as ''to have met with ill
fortune.'' But that was back in the 1940's, and lots of things have been turned on their heads since then. In 1954,
American Speech magazine was citing campus usages of to luck out, meaning ''to achieve success by good luck,''

                                                                                                             Page 2 of 3
                                               ON LANGUAGE; SHOO-IN

with the example of not being assigned Saturday classes. Today, ba-a-ad means ''good,'' reports of economic
growth can prompt stock-market downturns, and to luck out is to luck in.

I'm speculating because the lack of research on this point has been unfortunate, but I think this has to do with the
way out is used to form new verbs. In standard English, we have such compounds as break out, sit out and fall out,
so the device is not new; but in slang, we have witnessed an Out Explosion, as coinages have ranged from drop
out, cop out and sack out to the more recent veg out, pig out and spazz out.

Out is in and in is out. Along the way, luck ran out - that is, to luck in, or fall into luck, became to luck out. The other
form still exists, but the in is almost always into: one may luck into something, but the usage is not nearly as
common as to luck out.

That's the breaks, judge. Appeal denied. Listen to your clerk, get with it, and you will have it made in the shade.

Hallow

Rings Hollow

Here is this month's red- flag pronunciation alert: ''I am waiting for Oct. 31 to roll around,'' writes Eleanor Blau of
New York, ''wondering whether that holiday will be mispronounced again this year. Is it sloppiness or ignorance
which (sic) accounts for the mispronunciation of Halloween as Holloween?''

Neither; it's a newer way to pronounce it. Halloween, or Hallowe'en, is All Hallows Evening, with hallow meaning
''sacred,'' or as a noun, a synonym for ''saint.'' The first syllable is pronounced hol by some, but hal is still preferred
in the United States. Although we pronounce swallow as if the first syllable had an o, we prefer not to do that with
hallow, as everyone familiar with ''hallow'd be Thy name'' will attest.

In Merriam-Webster's Ninth Collegiate, this nice distinction is made: Halloween is pronounced hal-uh- ween, and a
second pronunciation is listed with the a in the first syllable having two dots over it. That means the a is pronounced
like the o in ''cottage.''

I suspect that the pronunciation in this country is shifting, and the hallow is ringing hollow. When the kids come
trick-or-treating at the end of the month, I'll ask them which holiday it is. Those that say Halloween will get an extra
handful of candy corn, because I like to encourage traditionalism.

Respectfully Disagree

When you disagree with your superior, or your friend, or someone you respect, how do you put him in his place?
Answer: by putting him in a figurative place or state.

The Rev. Paul A. Wickens, a priest in the Archdiocese of Newark, is in a feud with his Archbishop, at least in part
because of the prelate's support for a nuclear freeze. After Father Wickens suggested that churchgoers withhold
their Sunday contributions, the Archbishop decided to suspend him and to evict him from the rectory.

The rambunctious priest announced coolly: ''I believe my Archbishop is in schism.''

Where is schism, anyway? That word - originally pronounced ''sizzem'' but now more often pronounced ''skizem'' -
is a noun meaning ''split.'' In theological circles, however, Splitsville is a most specific state of being. I consulted
Father William Hill of the Catholic University's School of Theology for a definition.

''In schism refers to a division in canonical terms,'' he replied. ''That division may be disciplinary as opposed to
doctrinal. Doctrinal issues would involve ideas like the belief in the divinity of Jesus, while disciplinary matters have
to do with the exercise of authority - for example, one bishop intruding upon another bishop's area. It is possible to
be in schism in disciplinary issues without being divided in doctrinal areas.''

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 3
                                           ON LANGUAGE; SHOO-IN

I ran across a similar state a generation ago, researching the origin of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's use of ''new
deal.'' Judge Samuel I. Rosenman told me that he had drafted the peroration to Mr. Roosevelt's acceptance speech
to the 1932 Democratic National Convention: ''I pledge you, I pledge myself, to a new deal for the American
people.''

Raymond Moley, another Brain Truster and later a columnist for Newsweek, took sharp exception to this when I
called about it. He pointed to evidence in a book of his, ''After Seven Years,'' that showed the phrase was
suggested by him. How did Professor Moley react when it was pointed out that his old colleague remembered
history somewhat differently?

He did not direct his ire at the man personally; Raymond the Mole did not say that Sammy the Rose had a lousy
memory or was mistaken or wrong. Instead, he chose a delicate but unbudging usage: ''When Rosenman says that
he wrote it,'' Moley said, ''he is in error.''

Disputants who use civil phrases like that are in a graceful state. Where do you hear an argument these days that
goes ''You're in schism'' or ''You're in error''? I'm in awe.

The following information was released by the Philanthropy Roundtable:

By William Schambra

Frederick Gofffather of the first community foundation, the Cleveland Foundation, whose centenary we observe in
2014railed so fervently and frequently against the evils of the dead hand that his daughter came to fear the dark
staircase in her home, certain that the dead hand would reach out and grab her, reports historian Nathaniel
Howard.

Goff's fear was that, left to their own devices, wealthy individuals tended to bind their accumulated fortunes in
unbreakable trusts to institutions or causes that were self-serving, narrow, transitory, and peripheral to the public
interest. Better to bequeath their fortunes to a publicly governed trust broadly committed to the interests of the
entire community, he concluded. Its trustees would construe shortsighted donors' intentions as generously as
possible, and would even disregard the originally expressed preference regarding the purposes to which income
might be devoted, if in the course of years those purposes become obsolete or harmful.

Although community foundations now offer donor-advised funds that adhere to their creators' wishes, it's clear that
their original purpose was to substitute for donor intent a flexible, forward-looking view of the community interest,
which could be discerned only by enlightened civic elites. Goff was the first to expound the idea that the wealth of a
community belonged to all of its people, not just to a chosen few, former Cleveland Foundation staffer Bruce
Newman once observed. Frederick Goff might have seemed an unlikely champion of this rather collectivist view of
wealth. He was, after all, an attorney at the Cleveland firm that handled the interests of John Rockefeller (whose
career as oil magnate also began in Cleveland), and later a banker.

Saving the world

At the turn of the twentieth century, Goff's hometown was booming with steel manufacturing, oil refining, shipping,
and other heavy industries. It faced all the challenges of the era's industrial citiesinadequate housing, a swollen
population, pollution, and a corrupt political system. But Cleveland was a hotbed of progressive ideas for facing
these challenges.

Theodore Roosevelt was then promoting a new nationalism that envisioned a blend of public-private problem-
solving. Roosevelt believed that concentrated corporate interests, properly harnessed by a powerful central

                                                                               Page 2 of 5

government, could transcend narrow profit motives and pursue a broader public interest. Historian Peter Dobkin
Hall suggests that businessmen in the Midwest at that time tended to be willing to work with or through private-
sector entities such as the Chamber of Commerce to define the public interest, and through municipal government
to implement their goals.

Goff's community foundation idea constituted a nearly perfect expression of this ethos, Hall says. The Cleveland
Foundation was created to receive charitable trusts, either designated by donors for a particular purpose or left to
the discretion of the foundation. The funds would be left in private banks. Disbursement would be managed by a
distribution committee with both private and public representatives.

Goff was the first to expound the idea that the wealth of a community belonged to all of its people, not just to a
chosen few.

Goff shared with the larger progressive movement the desire to stop merely treating the symptoms of public
problems and get to their root causes. This could be accomplished by professional experts systematically applying
the newly developing social sciences to festering urban problems. Well before his foundation had even begun to
produce income, Goff proposed a great social and economic survey of Cleveland, to uncover the causes of poverty
and crime and point out the cure, modeled on the social surveys the Russell Sage Foundation had sponsored in
Pittsburgh.

Although that grand survey was never undertaken, Goff's foundation tackled major issues during its first decade,
including reforms of Cleveland's justice system, systems of charity, public education, recreation, local universities,
and use of the Lake Erie waterfront. With what Hall describes as the curious tendency of [the] Cleveland elite to
look beyond itself for expertise to advise its social experiments, a parade of prominent national progressive scholars
and activists were brought in to study these problems.

Raymond Moley, later a key New Deal adviser, was recruited to be the first full-time director of the Cleveland
Foundation; Leonard Ayres from Russell Sage worked on the education survey; and progressive legal giants
Roscoe Pound and Felix Frankfurter conducted the work on the criminal justice system, along with future
Rockefeller Foundation president Raymond Fosdick.

The surveys invariably condemned the confusion, redundancy, corruption, waste, and inefficiency of existing
systems, which could only be remedied by centralization, rationalization, professionalization, and the replacement
of self-interested partisan administration by experts. While some of these reports were well received, others
provoked a hostile reaction from the allegedly mistaken, wasteful, and corrupt. The survey of the courts notably led
a local judge to condemn it as a criminal waste of money, and to threaten to jail the foundation's distribution
committee for contempt. But Goff, according to Moley, was so flushed by the results of the crime survey that he
wanted to commit the Foundation to a completely crusading future.

Nonetheless, the foundation's zeal began to wane after the legal survey, notes journalist Diana Tittle. When
Frederick Goff died in 1923, the foundation entered a period of relative invisibility and reticence. Only in the 1960s
would it resume the practice of critically examining the performance of civic institutions.

Unwilling to preside over a trust that would simply dole out money to worthy and qualified charities, Moley left the
foundation en route to bigger powers inside the New Deal. Imbued with the progressive's preference for large
abstractions over smaller human interests, Moley could not bear the thought that my days would be occupied with
interviews with hopeful donees, hour after hour, day after day, interminably. This surely was not the way I intended
to spend the prime years of my life.

The '60s: politics and remedial reading

When the '60s arrived, the Cleveland Foundation returned to pot-stirring with a vengeance. As part of its national
plan to stimulate low-income community action against poverty, the Ford Foundation provided $1.25 million for a
new, quasi-independent account, the Greater Cleveland Associated Foundation (GCAF). Ford's legendary poverty
fighter Paul Ylvisaker saw to it that his former Harvard classmate, James Adolphus Norton, would be its director.

                                                                               Page 3 of 5
        100 YEARS OF EXPERTS ARMED WITH MONEY ...SURE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR CLEVELAND

Ford hoped such substantial block grants would galvanize quiescent foundations like Cleveland's into working for
social change, as Ylvisaker put it.

With generous funding from other Cleveland foundations in addition to this Ford money, along with the first gush of
dollars from the federal anti-poverty programs, GCAF was designed to be a massive, comprehensive attack on the
city's problems, thereby returning to Goff's original vision of the community foundation as a city's pre-eminent civic
innovator.

GCAF's education component produced efforts like Community Action for Youth, which would expand social
services around a middle school in Cleveland's troubled Hough neighborhood. Fannie Lewis, later a member of the
city council, was deeply involved in the effort, and ultimately deeply disappointed. When my son entered college, I
had to spend $5,000 on remedial reading courses. This mobilization disintegrated into a squabble over turf and a
scramble for federal dollars, according to Tittle. As anyone familiar with Cleveland knows, it did not succeed at
making our schools second to none in the country by 1970, as promised.

Although community foundations now offer donor-advised funds, it's clear their original purpose was to substitute a
flexible, forward-looking view of the community interest.

By the time GCAF merged with the Cleveland Foundation in 1967, the program had largely fizzled. But Norton
assumed the presidency of the larger foundation, and continued to work with Ford to gin up progressive
philanthropy in the city. At Norton's suggestion, Ford provided funding for a major voter registration effort in several
Cleveland neighborhoods that helped elect Carl Stokes as the first African-American mayor of a major American
city.

Convinced that we cannot afford to have this mayor fail, the Cleveland Foundation quietly funded a private media
adviser for Stokes. He helped the new mayor design the program Cleveland: NOW! This $1.5 billion spending
initiative was yet another comprehensive program to end poverty.

Echoing Chicago's problem with poverty funding going to inner-city gangs like the East Side Disciples and the
Blackstone Rangers, some of Stokes's dollars found their way to an astrological cult, the Black Nationalists of New
Libya, which used them to purchase guns. A police shoot-out with the group in 1968 resulted in seven deaths
(including three officers) and five days of riots. Tittle writes that this event also fatally wounded Cleveland: NOW!
and tainted the work of the community foundation.

The Ford Foundation was ultimately summoned before the House Committee on Ways and Means by
Representative Wright Patman (DTX) to explain, among other controversial acts, its involvement in Cleveland
mayoral politics. Patman also took a look at the Cleveland Foundation's political activities, prompting Norton and
representatives of ten other community foundations to hire attorneys.

Although community foundations emerged from the Tax Reform Act of 1969 without the strictures applied to private
foundations, and although Norton refused to fall back into an old-fashioned kind of philanthropy in which we aren't
able to explore the causes of urban problems, Tittle notes that Patman's investigations clearly slowed the activist
inclinations of the foundation's board.

Looking back and looking forward

As the Cleveland Foundation celebrates its centenary, it can be proud of many things. Throughout a century it
distributed $1.7 billion of donated money across the

community. It helped create the city's system of parks known as the Emerald Necklaces; prompted the merger that
produced Case Western Reserve University; launched Cuyahoga Community College; preserved one of the largest
performing arts centers in the country; sustained the Cleveland Orchestra, the Cleveland Museum of Art, the Rock
and Roll Hall of Fame, and other arts and cultural institutions; supported the city's growing network of charter
schools; and developed the idea of Cleveland as a center for medical technology.

                                                                               Page 4 of 5
        100 YEARS OF EXPERTS ARMED WITH MONEY ...SURE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR CLEVELAND

And yet, Cleveland was named America's most miserable city by Forbes in 2010. Visiting in 2012, education expert
Diane Ravitch observed that what struck me was that it is a sad, sad city. Except for sports stadiums, it feels
abandoned. The downtown is small and has many empty commercial buildings. Neighborhoods have boarded up
buildings and empty lots where buildings used to be. I was struck by how impoverished the city is, how
disheartened the teachers are, and how inadequate is the response of state and city leaders to the collapse of this
once-proud city.

Perhaps there is no grand, monolithic, systemic, root-cause solution to the city's problems, but rather a countless
number of smaller, partial answers.

Ravitch had come to town to critique mayor Frank Jackson's Plan for Transforming Schoolsthe latest in a century-
long string of sweeping reform efforts driven by public-private alliances. The Cleveland Foundation is fully behind
this effort, with current president Ronald Richard proclaiming it had made $22.3 million in grants for the reinvention
of our public schools, which must allow for a total culture change in our anachronistic school system. Tittle's book
Rebuilding Cleveland, written more than 20 years ago, opens with an eerily similar episode: the Cleveland
Foundation announcing at its 1987 annual meeting the most intensive, comprehensive campaign ever undertaken
by a major American city to improve the quality of public education. It included, among other things, a scholarship-
in-escrow program, filling bank accounts for inner-city kids earning good grades.

By the 1990s, the foundation had quietly abandoned the scholarship program. It had demonstrated minimal effects
on grades, even as its downstream costs accumulated. In pursuit of education and poverty revolutions, the
Cleveland Foundation has designed, coordinated, and funded wave after wave of intensive, comprehensive
campaigns throughout many decades. And yet the city seems only to lose ground.

Is there an alternative to the foundation's faltering collectivism? In 2010, comedian and proud Clevelander Drew
Carey asked the libertarian Reason Foundation to help him come up with fresh ideas to regenerate his hometown.
A six-part video production, Reason Saves Cleveland, urged thoroughgoing decentralization and deregulationthe
reverse of the Cleveland Foundation's century-long approach. Open up education with full school choice, sell off
municipal assets like the public market and two golf courses, remove red tape from permitting and zoning, lower
taxes to attract small businesses, forget about big-ticket silver bullets like stadiums and convention centers, permit
bottom-up economic development to revive the neighborhoods.

In other words, no more cumbersome, expensive, intrusive plansjust get out of the way of ambitious individuals and
neighborhoods eager to create their own solutions to community needs. Urban expert Joel Kotkin agreed this
decentralized approach was preferable to the bureaucratic concentrated decision-making process that has
characterized Cleveland in the past. The results would be uneven, disorderly, unplanned, and idiosyncratic, but they
would have an energy and vibrancy and economic sustainability missing from the planned city.

This alternative approach to thinking about Cleveland's challenges fundamentally questions Frederick Goff's
premise that there is an enlightened elite that knows better than everyday citizens what's best for a city. In modern
urban America, Goff's dead hand is far more likely to be attached to a long bureaucratic arm than a businessperson
or donor with personal passions. The Cleveland Foundation's donor-advised funds, with their uncoordinated
purposes and many small disbursements, may be more likely to incubate tomorrow's social and economic solutions
than the foundation's staff-directed funding.

The inspiration for this fresh vision is much likelier to come from community groups, small businesses, and
neighborhood interests than from a self-appointed convener, coordinator, and consolidator at the center of civic
action. In the Internet era of dispersed authority and organic growth, civic renewal is best characterized by the
precept to let a thousand flowers bloom.

The notion that the community foundation's days might be occupied with interviews with hopeful donees, hour after
hour, day after day ought not appall. That might actually be the best way to glean the full array of thoughtful ideas
embedded in the everyday citizens and civic groups of Cleveland. Perhaps there is no grand, monolithic, systemic,
root-cause solution to the city's problems, but rather a countless number of smaller, partial answers.

                                                                               Page 5 of 5
        100 YEARS OF EXPERTS ARMED WITH MONEY ...SURE DIDN'T DO MUCH FOR CLEVELAND

These are today's new insights on urban progress, and they deserve the attention and support of all concerned with
reviving our struggling communities.

NOTHING TO FEAR: FDR'S INNER CIRCLE AND THE HUNDRED DAYS THAT CREATED MODERN AMERICA
BY ADAM COHEN, Penguin Press, 372 pages, $29.95

THE WOMAN BEHIND THE NEW DEAL: THE LIFE OF FRANCES PERKINS, FDR'S SECRETARY OF LABOR
AND HIS MORAL CONSCIENCE BY KIRSTIN DOWNEY

Doubleday, 458 pages, $35.00

OBAMA-WATCHING HAS BE-come a new national--even international--sport. First, all eyes were glued to his
miraculous triumph over seven opponents in the primaries, followed by a remarkable victory over John McCain.
Next came "picking a Cabinet" as Americans witnessed a selection process touted for careful vetting descend into
allegations of financial misconduct, tax evasion, and conflicts of interest. Now attention has turned to Obama's
behind-the-scenes work with his inner circle as he tackles the biggest challenge of all--a deepening depression.

For months, commentators have likened Obama's situation to Franklin Delano Roosevelt's when he took office in
1933. Both inherited a failing economy from a Republican predecessor who clung to free-market nostrums when
greater federal intervention was needed. Then each new president acted boldly upon inauguration and harnessed a
new technology--radio in 1933, the Internet today--to bolster confidence as troubles mounted. In both eras, liberals
pinned hopes for fundamental reform on a man of centrist tendencies.

As David Axelrod, Rahm Emanuel, Timothy Geithner, Christina Romer, Eric Holder, and the rest of the gang are
becoming household names--Hillary Clinton and Larry Summers already were before they signed up--interest is
growing in how they are jockeying for turf and adapting to the pressures the administration now faces. Roosevelt
watchers no doubt wondered the same about the people he brought together at the top of his administration.

Two recent books that take as their subject five key figures in FDR's inner circle during his first hundred days as
president provide fascinating answers to that question. The press--and possibly President Obama himself--has
fixed on comparing his Cabinet to Abraham Lincoln's "team of rivals" as recently conceptualized in Doris Kearns
Goodwin's bestseller by that name. But, as Adam Cohen demonstrates in his new book, the parallel to FDR may be
more compelling. What Cohen (no relation) calls "the most diverse Cabinet in history" consisted of three

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 4
                                              TEAM OF RIVALS REDUX

Republicans as well as the expected Democrats, representatives from the South and West as well as the Northeast
and Midwest, two Catholics, the first woman ever, and by 1934 a Jew. Roosevelt deliberately surrounded himself
with advisers expressing conflicting points of view in order to weigh the alternatives before him. Cohen shows us a
president, much like Obama, who valued wide-ranging advice but then trusted his own judgment.

Five members of Roosevelt's "team of rivals" emerge from these two books. The most developed figure is Secretary
of Labor Frances Perkins, the first woman to serve in any Cabinet, who is one of Cohen's protagonists and the
subject of a fine biography by Kirstin Downey. Like Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, Perkins served the full 12
years of FDR's presidency. She set, and mostly accomplished, the New Deal's progressive agenda of
unemployment relief, large-scale public works, minimum-wage and maximum-hour laws, a ban on child labor, and a
permanent system of social security. Only health insurance eluded her. With special access to FDR's ear--having
had it already in New York state when he was governor and she served as his industrial commissioner--Perkins
managed to overcome his conservative fiscal tendencies and instinctive wariness of "the dole." "He wanted his
conscience kept for him by somebody," she later explained, and she prided herself on being the one to keep it.

The other two liberals in FDR's early Cabinet were Harry Hopkins and Henry Wallace. Hopkins had also known
Roosevelt in New York state, where he was a prominent social worker and headed the governor's relief agency. In
Washington, he invented and directed the $500 million joint federal-state relief program and went on to pioneer
extensive public-works projects through the Civil Works Administration and the Works Progress Administration.
Wallace, FDR's long-serving secretary of agriculture and a third-generation champion of the struggling American
farmer, drafted the Agricultural Adjustment Act, best known for its plan to rescue the farm belt by paying farmers to
grow less and thereby propping up farm prices.

The centrist adviser in the hundred days was Raymond Moley. A Columbia University government professor who
founded the Brain Trust during FDR's presidential campaign, Moley masterminded the rescue of the banks and the
revival of public confidence in the financial system through the declaration of a bank holiday and passage of the
Emergency Banking Act. Cohen also introduces us to the most conservative member of FDR's inner circle, budget
director Lewis Douglas. So close to Roosevelt that he and Moley made up the "bedside Cabinet" that met with the
president every morning to brief him on his day, Douglas appealed to FDR's fiscally cautious side. For a time, his
budget slashing and opposition to public works held sway, but as Roosevelt himself became more convinced of the
need for government spending, Douglas lost clout and eventually resigned.

As we watch Roosevelt's team maneuver for power, criticize one another to their boss, and fight it out in Cabinet
meetings as well as behind the scenes, we come to realize something to be alert to in the Obama administration.
An effective captain of a team of rivals, like FDR, prods his fiercely competitive players to argue with one another to
strengthen his own ability to make well-informed decisions. Current Cabinet members beware!

Perkins' experience demonstrates how complex the relationship between a loyal adviser and the president can be.
She had a close connection with Roosevelt, often irking her Cabinet colleagues by managing to get a private word
with FDR right after Cabinet meetings recessed. But that access did not always enable her to prevail. She
sometimes lost control over programs she felt rightfully belonged to the Labor Department, most notably over
immigration, naturalization, and deportation as Nazism spread in Europe and later as fears of communist infiltration
raged at home. She was personally hurt that the president failed to come to her defense in 1939 when a committee
in the House of Representatives red-baited her for refusing to deport the radical longshoreman Harry Bridges.

Perkins' life, too, reveals the personal cost people in public life may pay for their service, which often takes them
physically and emotionally away from needy family members and friends. Downey and Cohen both explore with
sensitivity the personal pain Perkins bore silently while she devoted herself to government service. Although she
deeply loved her husband, progressive economist Paul Wilson, when they married in 1913, she struggled with how
to preserve her own public identity and even harder, how to cope with his lifelong battle with bipolar disease and the
frequent hospitalizations it required. Tragically, their one child suffered from the same crippling illness and dealt with
it by lashing out at her mother, intensifying Perkins' sorrow and guilt. Both authors reveal the sacrifices that Perkins
made to spend her life in the public eye but also convey that for some public figures, service to the nation gives
solace and purpose to an otherwise demoralizing private life.

                                                                                                         Page 3 of 4
                                             TEAM OF RIVALS REDUX

Perkins' career as secretary of labor also offers useful lessons in advancing the interests of labor despite the
enormous economic pressures of a depression. When Perkins arrived in her new post, the labor movement was in
crisis, as union rivalries sapped labor's ability to organize and membership fell. By the time she left her office at
Roosevelt's death in April 1945, she had overseen the passage and implementation of landmark laws to
institutionalize collective bargaining and to establish minimum wages and maximum hours for millions of workers.
Obama's secretary of labor, Hilda Solis, might take note of Perkins' strategy, as Solis takes over with a similar crisis
facing the union movement that threatens to eviscerate what remains of labor's achievements during the nation's
post-World War II prosperity. Perkins understood the importance of federal legislation that protects workers and
establishes mechanisms for leveling the playing field between workers and employers. She likely would have
thrown her weight behind the Employee Free Choice Act currently under discussion, which would enable unions to
gain recognition when a majority of workers sign cards rather than requiring a vote that gives employers ample
opportunity to intimidate union supporters.

Strikingly, both of these books were written by accomplished journalists, not academic historians. Downey spent 20
years as a staff writer reporting on business and economics for The Washington Post. Cohen is currently an
assistant editorial page editor of The New York Times. Their talents as writers make these readable books strong
on narrative and character development. Not surprisingly, they engage little in scholarly debates about how to
interpret the era. Nor do they submit their sources--often memoirs and oral histories--to vigorous interrogation for
bias and distortions of memory. Likewise, their dependence on first-person accounts sometimes makes it hard for
readers to see their historical subjects as others saw them. When such insights occasionally emerge--such as when
Downey quotes a friend of Perkins' as saying the labor secretary "was particularly easy to pick on, being easily
agitated and not too tactful" or reveals that Perkins' fellow Cabinet members were put off by her long-windedness at
meetings--they come as a surprise.

Yet Downey's and Cohen's impressive ability to bring these five New Deal figures to life reminds us that
administrations are made by more than the great man--someday it will be a great woman--elected by the voters.
Lately, reading popular American history has often meant reading about the founding fathers. More than a taste for
hagiography is involved here. In the story of the nation's birth, history enthusiasts have readily found compelling
personalities animating American political history. In contrast, histories of the more recent past often focus on broad
social movements and impersonal constructs such as the Cold War or deindustrialization. Cohen and Downey have
made an important contribution by introducing readers to four men and one woman who, with dedication and rivalry,
brilliance and pettiness, made a New Deal that continues to set the standard for overcoming a national economic
crisis.

The following information was released by the Council on Foreign Relations:

The upcoming G-20 meeting is not the first conference held in London several months into a new U.S.
administration in the midst of an international economic crisis. International powers also met there in the summer of
1933, not long after Franklin Roosevelt's inauguration. To review that London meeting reminds us just how badly an
international conference can flop.

But to the story: The planning for that London conference was in motion well before Roosevelt was inaugurated,
just as the current London Conference antedates the Obama presidency. In those days, presidents took office in
March, and even in January interregnum days, diplomats were already laying out agendas.

Then as now, repairing a broken world was the overall goal. There was a sense that the economic troubles of
industrial nations could only be resolved by building new architecture--and that, too, only by delicate, self-sacrificing
cooperation. In Britain, after all, the depression had started earlier; Ramsay MacDonald was presiding over a
national government of the two big parties. The German central banker, Hjalmar Schacht, was to come to London
representing another new leader--Adolf Hitler--who had seized power at the end of January.

The proximate American goal was for intelligent, subtle, precise minds to reestablish a new monetary arrangement
between Britain, France and the U.S. Britain's decision to go off the gold standard had deepened the recession at
home: Depositors figured the U.S. would be the next to do so and pulled gold out of American banks. Trade was
also on the agenda. In those days, Democrats were the free traders, and the new administration wanted to end a
cycle of retaliation that had taken over since Hoover had signed the punitive Smoot-Hawley Tariff. The urgency
dominated: "Get fast action and cut the speeches short," the president told his team on the eve of their departure.

The trouble started with the very makeup of that team: Each representative seemed to have a slightly different
mission. For Secretary of State Cordell Hull, the delegation head, this was a trade pilgrimage. Smoot-Hawley was
taking an especial toll on the U.K.-U.S. relationship. Hull believed that the best chance of avoiding a repeat of the
carnage of World War I was to win back Britain and to soothe allies and potential allies with international
agreements that would cut tariffs and yield comity. With freer trade, he believed, "one country would not be deadly
jealous of another, and the living standards of all countries might rise, thereby eliminating the economic
dissatisfaction that breeds war." Hull boarded his ocean liner safe in the conviction that the president was
shepherding free-trade legislation through Congress even as he sailed.

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 4
                                     G-20: GHOSTS OF CONFERENCES PAST

James Couzens, a Republican senator from Michigan, often disagreed with Hull. Nevada Senator Key Pittman was
traveling to London on behalf of silver, in the hope that a new international silver agreement would push up the
price of the metal mined in his state.

In addition, there was Raymond Moley, an expert in criminal justice from Roosevelt's New York crowd--he was, or
believed himself to be, the new president's point man. James Warburg, the son of Wall Street's Paul Warburg, was
there to work on the financial side of things and get the U.S. back on something like the gold standard, which the
U.S. had left in spring. The representatives were all a bit perplexed at their own variety--Warburg wondered why
Rep. Sam McReynolds of Tennessee was there, and wrote that the latter "took no interest in the conference and
rarely attended meetings of the delegation. His chief concern was to get his daughter presented at court." The
Anglophiles in the group betrayed their narrowness by mocking Pittman as a hick. Warburg noted that it rained on
the day of a garden party with King George and Queen Mary, but an equerry advised the Americans that it was
etiquette to greet royalty without raincoats. Pittman refused, saying, "I ain't going to get soaked for no king and
queen."

Still, as another official, Herbert Feis of the State Department, noted, it could have been worse. Upon pressure from
lawmakers, Roosevelt had considered sending Father Coughlin, the bigoted radio show host, as well. This would
have been something like inviting Ann Coulter or Mike Moore to join Secretary Geithner in his London work.

What ensued was a comedy of errors so outstanding as to be chronicled by various authors from Feis to The New
Yorker's John Brooks to, most recently, Liaquat Ahamed in Lords of Finance. The best of them is Feis' tell-all, 1933:
Characters in Crisis. The short version is that the emissaries began to recognize their challenges were serious
while they were still aboard the S.S. Roosevelt. Hull received news that Roosevelt had not pushed his free-trade
legislation through Congress, and knew, therefore, that he now lacked the means to convince Britain to agree to
strong free-trade provisions. "I left for London with the highest hopes but arrived with empty hands." Once in
London, Warburg labored assiduously for an agreement on finance only to find himself sabotaged by other
delegates. The leader of the French delegation, Georges Bonnet, was, as Feis put it, "as cooperative as a
rattlesnake."

The Europeans, overall, seemed driven by vanity to an appalling extent--"I cannot offend Havas [the French news
agency]," Bonnet said, "because if I do they will not print my speeches." Schacht of Germany seemed the most
addled of all, for he was nursing the illusion that he could steer Hitler, and not the other way around. The United
States sensed, perhaps accurately, that the Europeans might not accept any compromise.

It all led to deep quarrels within the U.S. delegation. Hull showed the parvenu Moley his place by squelching his
efforts to take the lead on policy. Roosevelt kept his distance, yachting about the Atlantic and firing off, from time to
time, contradictory messages. Moley frantically wired the president: "Success or even continuance of the
conference depends on U.S. agreement." But Roosevelt responded instead with what became known as his
"bombshell," a message that seemed to contradict what Hull had been saying and doing, as well as the old original
plan for order. The Roosevelt message dissed what it called the "old fetishes of international bankers"--read, the
crowd in London--with the argument that it was time for individual nations to "plan national currencies." The U.S.
was going to manage its money alone, hour by hour--at least for the moment--to suit its own economy.

As the appalled editors of Le Temps wrote: "One has the feeling that the threat of distress has caused the people of
the United States to lose self-control." What the bombshell can have meant to German citizens, who that spring had
watched their new government burn books and construct a camp at Dachau, is hard to know. Warburg, whose
philosophic compass was the gold standard, handed in his resignation to Hull, writing, "We are entering upon
waters for which I have no charts and in which I therefore feel myself an utterly incompetent pilot." In any case,
Roosevelt's bombshell meant that, in terms of content at least, the conference was over.

As has sometimes been the case with certain Doha sessions, the actual death took much longer. The humiliation
was total. At a garden party, the king told one diplomat that "Ramsay MacDonald had been made a fool of." Though
it wasn't the end of MacDonald's national government, he warned that it was. Before they headed home at the end
of July, the once lofty participants were driven by the sheer pressure of it all to alcohol, bad jokes and scatology.

                                                                                                           Page 3 of 4
                                     G-20: GHOSTS OF CONFERENCES PAST

The representative of the Argentine Republic told Warburg: "Ze conference is a failure, but I have learned English. I
now know ze difference between a piss of paper and a shit of paper." (This is in Warburg's book.) Yet worse,
however, at least in terms of literary product, was a quatrain about the gold standard produced by the Times of
London.

The dollar swan has sat upon her gold

When death approached unlocked her hoard and gold

Raising her price to meet her need full sore

But sank the exchange 'til it could sink no more.

Even at the time, there were some international observers who saw some method in Roosevelt's madness. The
Keynesian of the day was John Maynard Keynes himself, who deemed FDR's work "Magnificently Right." The
equivalent to today's housing lobby was farming. Today, the sight of Americans losing their homes shifts the plans
of presidents; then, it was the reality of citizens losing both homes and farms. Confronted with the choice of
angering marching farmers or angering histrionic diplomats, Roosevelt was opting for the latter. With his traditional
advisers out of sight--Hull in London and William Woodin, the Treasury secretary, deeply ill--the president had
begun paying more attention in any case to inflationists, especially George Warren, a Cornell professor who
Roosevelt's friend Henry Morgenthau Jr. had come to know through his work on farm prices.

Warren had a plan for reflating that suited the political moment: The U.S. might drive up the prices of agricultural
commodities by buying gold. This was right in theory, but only in theory--something like saying you can raise the
sea level by pouring liquid into the ocean by the thimble. Roosevelt's own entourage recognized the challenges of
FDR's plan. "How different life would have been had Franklin and Henry not met those arboreal experts," Mrs.
Morgenthau would later comment.

There are those who argue that Roosevelt's bombshell did little destruction at all--the Princeton scholar Harold
James has posited that London 1933 was a series of catch-22s, rigged to fail from the beginning. By 1934
Roosevelt was in any case abandoning Warren and discretionary gold purchases, going back on the gold standard
and even signing Hull's historic trade agreement into law. I would argue that the real loss of the conference didn't
come, in the end, in the monetary or trade areas. The damage was in the area of diplomacy and democracy. "The
only beneficiaries were Germany and Japan," wrote Feis, later, of London 1933. Today, Latin America watches as
the U.S. turns inward and draws the consequences. That is what happened in Europe after London. The message
for dictators on the continent was that the U.S. would, in the future, be absent from the scene and was leaving them
alone to pursue their agendas. The next time Schacht stood before so many international cameras would be at
Nuremberg during his trial as a war criminal.

Our own G-20 conference, with its agenda of banking, stimuli and monetary policy, is not the same. But there is a
parallel tension between budgetary responsibility--Angela Merkel's mutterings about a "solid, sustainable fiscal
policy"--and the perceived need to dump out yet further trillions in stimuli into the U.S. economy. And, more
importantly, there is the same problem of war lurking on the horizon of what currently looks to be an all economic
landscape. The Germany of 2009 is Russia. What 1933 says about 2009 is that diplomacy may actually matter
more than any specific monetary or banking agreement. Counterintuitive, but that's the London takeaway.

Highlight: Most inaugurals are forgotten, but Jefferson, Lincoln, FDR, and JFK gave speeches for the ages

Body


Prepare to be underwhelmed. If history is any guide, when President Barack Obama delivers his second inaugural
address at midday on Monday his words won't long linger in the public's memory.

Inaugural addresses as a group are largely forgettable. When he was helping John F. Kennedy prepare his
address, aide Ted Sorensen read all the past such speeches and concluded, he later wrote, that they were "a
largely undistinguished lot, with some of the best eloquence emanating from some of the worst presidents." The
dozen which have been delivered since Kennedy's 1961 address have done little to alter that judgment.

This is due in part to the men delivering the speeches. "So many of these presidents are so forgettable," says
historian Robert Dallek. "They don't make much of a mark on the country's memory. So I think their inaugurals
reflect the quality of the men, and the historical reputation they leave us."

[Check out editorial cartoons about President Obama.]

And Obama faces the challenge which dogs any second inaugural address: how to bring drama or freshness to a
continuity event. "There's no novelty to it," explains Jeff Shesol, who was a speechwriter for President Clinton. "A
first inaugural address is America at a pivot point. ... A second inaugural is a presidency at midstream."

For the most part the speeches generally recalled as ranking among the greats were delivered at critical moments
in the nation's history. But they also managed to balance the moment with posterity. "They manage to speak very
directly to their moment but they also say something to our own," Shesol says. "They manage to be timeless
without being lost in the ether somewhere and unmoored from events."

Presidents have delivered 56 inaugural addresses. Here are the five best.

Thomas Jefferson's 1st, 1801:The presidential contest of 1800 was negative in a way that makes modern
campaigns seem gentle. John Adams, the Federalist incumbent, favored monarchy and had schemed to marry his
son to one of King George III's daughters, his enemies charged. Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican
nominee, was an atheist vivisectionist whose election would ignite a French Revolution-style reign of terror,
according to his rivals. Matters were not helped when, after the Democratic-Republicans seemed to win handily, the
Electoral College deadlocked with both Jefferson and his running mate, Aaron Burr, getting the same number of
votes (electors did not yet cast separate votes for president and vice president). This threw the matter to the
Federalist-dominated, lame duck House of Representatives which, after 36 ballots, elected Jefferson.

                                                                                                              Page 2 of 5
                                             The 5 Best Inaugural Addresses

[Check out U.S. News Weekly, an insider's guide to politics and policy.]

He would become the third president, but his swearing in marked the first time the presidency had shifted from one
political party to the other. His political enemies still feared his radicalism, and there was even some talk of civil war.
"He was trying to emphasize that there should be a constitutional transfer of power, and it shouldn't be seen as a
reason for rebellion and bloodshed," says Dallek.

On the morning of Wednesday, March 4 (the date set for the transfer of power until the 20th Amendment moved it
to January 20), Jefferson emerged from the Conrad and McMunn boarding house, a short distance from the
Capitol, and walked to the Senate chamber for his swearing in. More than 1,000 people crammed into the chamber-
-"not another creature could enter," one witness reported--to listen to the new president deliver his address.

"Friends and fellow-citizens," he began in an almost inaudible tone, declaring his "sincere consciousness that the
task is above my talents." He quickly turned to the main job at hand, reassuring his audience that the peaceful
transfer of power was not a prelude to revolution. While affirming the "sacred principle" of majority rule, he
cautioned that the will of the majority "must be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which equal
law must protect, and to violate would be oppression."

In a passage with which some contemporary politicians might want to reacquaint themselves, he said that, "every
difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same
principle. We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists."

Abraham Lincoln's 2nd, 1865:When Lincoln had taken office four years earlier, he had used his brilliant first
inaugural to make a lawyerly but eloquent case for preserving the union. In a closing suggested by one-time rival
William Seward and polished by the president-elect, he had appealed to the "mystic chords of memory" which
would "yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our
nature."

[See a collection of political cartoons on the Republican Party.]

Four years later, with the end of the nation's bloodiest war in sight, Lincoln could easily be expected to mark his
second term with triumphalism and a celebration of his side's righteousness. Even providence seemed to favor him:
As he emerged onto the inaugural platform, the sun made its first appearance after spending the morning hidden by
clouds and being obscured earlier in the week by rain. Light flooded down and bathed the Capitol dome, which had
not been completed when Lincoln first took the oath of office.

But the president knew that he and the country still faced huge challenges. "There was bound to be bitterness and
animosity, and how were you going to make this nation whole again," says Dallek. "It was one of the great
challenges of American history." So instead of a victory speech, Lincoln delivered a brief--fewer than 700 words--
address with a different tone. "In keeping with this lifelong tendency to consider all sides of a troubled situation,
Lincoln urged a more sympathetic understanding of the nation's alienated citizens in the South," Doris Kearns
Goodwin wrote in her landmark Lincoln history, Team of Rivals.

While each side had "read the same bible and pray[ed] to the same God, and each invokes his aid against the
other," Lincoln said, "the prayers of both could not be answered. That of neither has been answered fully. The
Almighty has his own purposes." God had given "to both the North and South this terrible war as the woe" that was
their due for the country's original sin, slavery. And, he said, "if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled up
by the bondsmen's 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall
be paid by another drawn with the sword ... 'the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.'"

His peroration is carved into history: "With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God
gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him
who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just

                                          The 5 Best Inaugural Addresses

"It's such a tragedy to think about the kind of course that he was charting on reconstruction, and it didn't come to
pass," says speech expert Michael Cohen, author of Live From the Campaign Trail, about great presidential
campaign speeches.

Days after the address, Lincoln wrote a political ally saying that he thought the speech would "wear as well--
perhaps better than--any thing I have produced." He was right: Most historians see Lincoln's second as the greatest
inaugural address ever.

Franklin Roosevelt's 1st, 1933:The weather welcoming Franklin Roosevelt to the presidency reflected the state of
the union he was taking charge of. One later account recalled "the great mass before the Capitol, huddling in the
mist and wind under the sullen March sky." One-fourth of the nation's workers were jobless; nearly half of the
nation's banks--more than 11,000 of 24,000 in the country--had failed; the stock market had lost 75 percent of its
value since 1929.

Supported by his son James, Roosevelt approached the rostrum to take the oath of office for the first time. While
tradition dictated that Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes would read the presidential oath, and Roosevelt should
affirm it with a simple, "I do," FDR set a new tradition by repeating each phrase of the oath.

Wearing nothing more than his formal morning coat against the biting wind, Roosevelt told his fellow countrymen
that, "This is a day of national consecration." This was a last minute addition to the speech, which he had jotted
onto his reading text shortly before delivering the speech.

[See Photos Behind the Scenes: Preparing for Obama's Second Inauguration.]

Roosevelt had first started discussing an inaugural address with aide Raymond Moley the previous September.
But while Moley would collaborate with Roosevelt to write the bulk of the speech, the most famous line was
proffered by another aide, Louis Howe. Editing a near final draft, Howe had inserted the assertion that "the only
thing we have to fear is fear itself." Moley later suggested that Howe had gotten the phrase from a department
store ad, but if true the advertisement has been lost to history.

The portions of the speech that drew the most crowd reaction were FDR's calls for "action, and action now." (The
single biggest applause of the day, disturbingly, came when Roosevelt promised that if Congress would not act, he
would request wartime executive powers to deal with the crisis on his own.)

The address was aimed at reviving a nation which was not only reeling, but had been reeling for years. He "sought
to be honest and optimistic at the same time, a challenging combination he had developed when counseling polio
patients at Warm Springs," Jonathan Alter wrote in The Defining Moment, his book on Roosevelt's first 100 days.

In a moment of Lincoln-like symbolism, the sun finally poked through the gray clouds just after Roosevelt ended his
address. The national reaction to the speech was instantaneous. Nearly half a million people wrote to the new
president. "This fellow talked as if he were 300 percent sure," Tommy Corcoran, a lawyer who would go on to
become a close Roosevelt aide, recalled. "That blast of the horn was worth 1,000 men."

Franklin Roosevelt's 2nd, 1937:The state of the country had improved during FDR's first four years, but the
weather for his second inaugural had not. The first January inauguration was greeted by rain and sleet, driven
through the city by high winds. The crowd of thousands that gathered to watch the president renew his oath of office
found themselves in mud to their ankles. "If they can take it, I can take it," Roosevelt said. Twice he would have to
pause to wipe the rain from his eyes as he read.

He had marked up the speech more than any other in his time in the White House, aide Samuel Rosenman later
recalled. Rosenman and Tom Corcoran--who four years earlier had been struck by the "blast" of Roosevelt's "horn"-
-were FDR's principle collaborators on the address.

Four years into the great experiment of the New Deal, Roosevelt's second inaugural was both a spur to further
progress and a bold philosophical statement of activist government.

"Old truths have been relearned; untruths have been unlearned," he said. "We have always known that heedless
self-interest was bad morals; we know now that it is bad economics." The nation had "come far from the days of
stagnation and despair," FDR told his audience, but warned that "our present gains were won under the pressure of
more than ordinary circumstance." But the hard-won advances could lead to complacence, he warned: "Prosperity
already tests the persistence of our progressive purpose."

And there was still work to be done. He described a country still struggling to recover from economic disaster. "I see
millions of families trying to live on incomes so meager that the pall of family disaster hangs over them day by day."
He, repeated the "I see" formulation three more times before uttering his famous encapsulation: "I see one-third of a
nation ill-housed, ill-clad, ill-nourished." Roosevelt had penciled that summation himself. He continued: "It is not in
despair that I paint you that picture," he said. "I paint it for you in hope--because the nation, seeing and
understanding the injustice in it, proposes to paint it out. ... The test of our progress is not whether we add more to
the abundance of those who have much; it is whether we provide enough for those who have too little."

[See 2012: The Year in Cartoons.]

It was a "uniquely radical speech," says Cohen. "It's an amazingly self-confident speech, but also one that
represents a real shift in governing philosophy."

The speech, adds Shesol, whose book Supreme Powerrecounts Roosevelt's second-term, court-packing fight, is "in
many ways the equal of the first [inaugural] in the clarity of the argument and the beauty of the language. ... It's not
just a series of lines, but it says so much about who he was and what he did."

John F. Kennedy's, 1961:Shortly after his hair's-breadth victory over Vice President Richard Nixon, President-elect
Kennedy huddled with Sorensen, his top aide and chief speechwriter, to discuss the inaugural address. "Make it
shortest since T.R. (except for FDR's abbreviated wartime ceremony in 1945)," Sorensen jotted in a note to himself.

Brevity (it was less than 1,400 words) was one of the virtues of Kennedy's ringing inaugural. It was also what the
historian David Greenberg has called "the last expression of a now-eclipsed strain of Churchillian oratory"--recall,
for example, "Now the trumpet summons us again..." Kennedy ordinarily shunned such flourishes. Simplicity and
clarity were the goals in his speeches, though he valued pungency of expression as well. "The inaugural was a
special occasion, and there was a special tone in that speech," Sorensen later recalled.

[See Photos: Obama Behind the Scenes.]

That tone and that language--"ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country"--
have made it the benchmark against which subsequent addresses have been measured. Uniquely on this list,
Kennedy's speech did not occur at a time the country was facing imminent crisis (despite his declaration that he
spoke during the "hour of maximum danger" for freedom), though the circumstances of the speech have helped it
endure: He was the youngest elected president, speaking of "the torch [having] been passed to a new generation of
Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace...." And the speech came
at a cultural tipping moment. "I don't think you would have felt in a Nixon inaugural in January, 1961 some kind of
momentous shift of the generations," says Shesol. And, adds Dallek, author of the JFK biography An Unfinished
Life, the speech gave the country "some new, fresh hope and optimism."

Like FDR's second inaugural, Kennedy's speech was also an eloquent expression of political philosophy, this one
focused on foreign affairs. The declaration that "we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship,
support any friend, oppose any foe" takes on a grim tone after the tragedy of the Vietnam War. But that rhetoric is

                                                                                                   Page 5 of 5
                                           The 5 Best Inaugural Addresses

also balanced by the language of internationalism, a desire for peace, and a hope for a "new endeavor, not a new
balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved."
The economist John Kenneth Galbraith contributed a notion which would become one of the speech's best known
passages: "Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear to negotiate."

There are two abiding mysteries about Bill Clinton: Why do some people hate him so passionately? And why do
some people adore him so loyally? The recent memoirs by his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and by his intense
outrider Sidney Blumenthal focus on the former issue while providing textbook studies of the latter.

Both authors were famous for propounding the theory that the Clinton scandals were the result of what Hillary
Clinton called "a vast right-wing conspiracy," dedicated to destroying the progressive agenda. In "Living History"
(Simon & Schuster; $28), she repeats the charge, conceding only that the coordinated crusade was so brazen that
it might not have qualified as a conspiracy. In "The Clinton Wars" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux; $30), Blumenthal, whose
ornate conspiracy theories earned him the nickname Grassy Knoll, launches into a game of Trivial Pursuit that is
filled with half-forgotten bit players (remember David Bossie and George Conway III?) linked to a web of rabid
Clinton-haters stretching back to Arkansas's hardscrabble racists. Together, the authors amply prove the old maxim
that even paranoids have enemies.

Although the books are scored in different keys-Clinton's generally attempts to be gauzy and warm, Blumenthal's is
edgy and cold-their underlying refrain is the same. Both repeatedly delve into what Hillary Clinton calls "the
mechanics of what was essentially a sting operation to entrap the President" and what Blumenthal declares was the
work of "fiercely partisan Republicans who had embarked on a sexual fishing expedition." Like any fishing
expedition, which indeed it was, it could be sustained only if there were a lot of fishy things below the surface, which
indeed there were. But where most memoirists adopt an air of mellowed self-examination, these authors are not in
the mood to make concessions. Instead, they go on the attack. Their aggressiveness marks an evolution, befitting
our times, in the tone and style of memoirs by people who have worked in the White House.

The venerable tradition of the White House memoir goes back to President James Madison's extraordinary young
slave Paul Jennings. Jennings's memoir, which he wrote after Daniel Webster bought his freedom, contained most
of what we have come to expect from such books, including thumbnail sketches of important players: "Mr. Robert
Smith was then Secretary of State, but as he and Mr. Madison could not agree, he was removed, and Colonel
Monroe appointed to his place. Dr. Eustis was Secretary of War-rather a rough, blustering man; Mr. Gallatin, a tip-

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 6

top man, was Secretary of the Treasury; and Mr. Hamilton of South Carolina, a pleasant gentleman, who thought
Mr. Madison could do nothing wrong, and who always concurred in every thing he said, was Secretary of the Navy."

Jennings also provided accounts of the policy battles over the War of 1812 ("Colonel Monroe was always fierce for
it") and tried to debunk a few myths. "It has often been stated in print that when Mrs. Madison escaped from the
White House, she cut out from the frame the large portrait of Washington . . . and carried it off," Jennings wrote.
"This is totally false. She had no time for doing it. It would have required a ladder to get it down." (The Gilbert Stuart
painting was actually saved by a doorkeeper and a gardener, he said.) Most important, Jennings's memoir set the
genre's standard for Presidential praise. "Mr. Madison, I think, was one of the best men that ever lived," he wrote. "I
never saw him in a passion, and never knew him to strike a slave."

The modern era of such memoirs began with a gusher from the Administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose
insistence that his aides display a "passion for anonymity" had only a temporary restraining effect. The first of the
Roosevelt books, "After Seven Years," by the brain-truster Raymond Moley, established the tone: praise for the
patron that subtly shades into self-praise, inside accounts of policy struggles in which the author turns out to have
been right, a dollop of historical commentary, some gossip that gently settles old scores, and a good index for
colleagues who may not want to read the whole thing. Moley was sometimes deft enough to work many of these
themes into a single sentence: "I was able to achieve almost the impossible-the maintenance of friendly relations
with both Louis Howe and Sam Rosenman-and the rivalry of these two men was the single factor that might have
disrupted the logical course of events."

Although most such memoirs ended up in the ash bin, a few helped elevate the genre. Roosevelt's best
speechwriter, Robert E. Sherwood, who had won three Pulitzer Prizes as a playwright, won another for a memoir
cast as a character study, "Roosevelt and Hopkins." In 1965, two of John Kennedy's speechwriters produced
similarly stately tomes. Theodore Sorensen's "Kennedy" is notable for being unflinching, at least in parts. Its
assessment of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion, for instance, begins by saying of Kennedy, "His own mistakes were
many and serious," and then proceeds to catalogue them. The eminent historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., has
sometimes been labelled a hagiographer for the Camelot chords he struck, but "A Thousand Days" is an intricate
and serious narrative biography with sweeping historical themes and incisive drypoint character sketches. His
depiction of Secretary of State Dean Rusk is typical: "As he would talk on and on in his even, low voice, a Georgia
drawl sounding distantly under the professional tones of a foundation executive, the world itself seemed to lose
reality and dissolve into a montage of platitudes."

The Watergate scandal posed a new challenge to White House memoirists: how to deal with the character flaws
that unravelled a Presidency. William Safire, a Nixon speechwriter, set out to produce a book that would be
"sympathetic but not sycophantic," and the result, "Before the Fall," succeeds by peeling back the multiple layers of
Nixon's tortured personality and offering up candid (and amusing) portraits of Henry Kissinger and other members
of the court. Safire defended much of Nixon's record, but recognized that Nixon might be "the only genuinely tragic
hero in our history, his ruination caused by the flaws in his own character." In "White House Years," Kissinger, too,
was willing to explore the loneliness, paranoia, insecurity, and lack of generosity that infected Nixon and unsettled
his tenure. He notices the little things about Nixon-"his pant legs as always a trifle short," his look of defiance mixed
with uncertainty-and concludes by ruminating about "what extraordinary vehicles destiny selects to accomplish its
design."

It subsequently became part of the tradition for aides to try to establish their credibility and integrity, and make some
headlines, by including a few denigrating revelations about their former patrons. James Fallows, a Carter
speechwriter, wrote a magazine memoir before Carter even had a chance to run for reelection, in which he
described Carter as "passionless" and revealed that the President micromanaged the sign-up schedule for the
White House tennis court. Even more damaging was Donald T. Regan's revelation about "the most closely guarded
domestic secret" of Ronald and Nancy Reagan: "Virtually every major move and decision the Reagans made during
my time as White House Chief of Staff was cleared in advance with a woman in San Francisco who drew up
horoscopes to make certain that the planets were in a favorable alignment." The current Administration has already
produced such a memoir, by a former speechwriter, David Frum, in "The Right Man," which is generally as flattering
as the title implies but contains a few discomforting little revelations about the tenor of the White House-Frum, who

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 6

is Jewish, opens the book with the line "Missed you at Bible study" spoken by one aide to another-and about Bush's
own shortcomings: "He is impatient and quick to anger; sometimes glib, even dogmatic; often uncurious and as a
result ill-informed; more conventional in his thinking than a leader probably should be."

Minor score-settling aside, though, previous White House memoirs tried to appear reflective, above the fray, and
candid about mistakes that were made. This was true, certainly, of the only other best-selling memoir so far from a
Clinton aide, George Stephanopoulos's "All Too Human." Stephanopoulos dealt with the scandals in an admirably
honest manner, and revealed his own conflicting emotions in an anguished portrayal of the period. "I didn't think I
was a hypocrite, because my defense of Clinton against past bimbo eruptions had been predicated on my belief
that he wouldn't create new ones, but maybe I was complicit because when I worked for Clinton I had been willing
to suspend my disbelief about some of his more suspect denials," he writes. "For several years, I had served as his
character witness. Now I felt like a dupe."

Sidney Blumenthal-who spent years covering Washington politics for The New Republic and then for The New
Yorker, before becoming an assistant to President Clinton-has no time for such self-examination. He unabashedly
rises to the President's defense in each and every (and every and every) particular, embedding a controlled,
seemingly dispassionate, and at times persuasive pro-Clinton polemic within the pages of a high-minded history. In
doing so, he has helped to create something like a new genre-the attack memoir.

The result reads like two very different books shuffled together, jostling one another uncomfortably as they alternate
turns over nearly eight hundred pages. The first book consists of Blumenthal aspiring to emulate Schlesinger. From
the opening scene, in which the new President visits the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library, in Hyde Park, the author
unblushingly places himself at the center of momentous historical forces. "I could hear my own footsteps as I
walked past black-and-white photographs of FDR grandly gesturing to roaring crowds," he writes. When Bill Clinton
arrives, "the dust started to be shaken; the pinned exhibits almost seemed to want to move; the past was no longer
at rest." And then, in a metaphorical gesture, the President beckons Blumenthal over: "He wanted me to
accompany him as he toured FDR's library."

Blumenthal's assessment of Clinton occasionally transcends hagiography and approaches deification. His black
students in Arkansas, we are informed, "called him Wonder Boy for his utter absence of racial distinction," and a
member of the National Symphony "told me he was the only guest conductor they'd ever had who knew what he
was doing." By the end of the book, Clinton has been carved into the progressive pantheon with both Roosevelts.
"Just as the presidents of the late twentieth century operated in the shadow of FDR," Blumenthal declares, "those of
the first part of the twenty-first century will stand in the shadow of Clinton."

But it would be unfair, albeit easy, to make fun of Blumenthal as a human incarnation of Buddy the dog, tirelessly
chasing errant balls and panting with pure affection. When stripped of some of the excesses, his character sketches
and his digressions into the roots of great historical themes can be fascinating. He is especially enlightening about
the Third Way movement, through which Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair shed the paralyzing dogmas
of the old left in order to take up policies of forceful engagement abroad along with fiscal responsibility at home. By
this approach, Blumenthal argues, Clinton showed how strong executive leadership could be brought to the cause
of progressive social policies. The result was "the greatest prosperity" in America's history, "the greatest reduction
in poverty" since Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, "the greatest public health insurance coverage of children, and
the greatest budget surplus ever." Despite Blumenthal's efforts, few will be convinced that the Clinton
Administration's haphazard policymaking was responsible for all these successes, but he does make the best
possible case that it deserves a lot of the credit.

Time and again, unfortunately, Blumenthal's revealing anecdotes and sweeping policy analysis get elbowed aside
by his parallel book, the one in which he dives into the murky depth of each successive scandal. Suddenly the tone
turns conspiratorial. A legion of enemies small and large, from Arkansas lowlifes to the independent counsel
Kenneth Starr, are woven into a tangled web of buffoons who share the same sinister motives and tactics. And
many in the press are portrayed either as willing dupes or as craven co-conspirators. (At one point, Blumenthal
accuses Time of purposefully positioning a photograph of Hillary Clinton on the cover so that the "M" in the logo
would look like devil horns. As the managing editor of the magazine then, I can attest that the "M" was in the same

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 6

place it had been for eighty years, ever since Henry Luce decided against calling his magazine The Synthetic
Review, and that we had no diabolical designs.) Blumenthal's valid points about the tactics of the probers are thus
lost to his lack of subtlety and his unwillingness to reflect on the Clintonian behavior that created the morass in the
first place. Once again, it's necessary to strip away Blumenthal's excesses in order to uncover his insights.

The most compelling of these insights flow from his recounting of how he secretly befriended David Brock, an
apostate conservative journalist who first published the sex allegations made against Clinton by Arkansas state
troopers. On the day that the Monica Lewinsky story broke, Blumenthal called Brock, who had already been
expiating his guilt by leaking to Blumenthal the maneuvers of the most ardent Clinton-haters. Brock proceeded to
detail the collusion among Kenneth Starr's office, journalists at Newsweek, Lewinsky's turncoat confessor Linda
Tripp, the merry mischief-maker Lucianne Goldberg, the Internet gossip Matt Drudge, and a motley if not vast right-
wing conspiracy that included a collection of freelance investigators and legal "elves" funded by the conservative
millionaire Richard Mellon Scaife.

The machinations of members of this anti-Clinton cabal are interesting enough and, indeed (as many of them will
proudly admit), true enough, but Blumenthal and Hillary Clinton were notably unsuccessful at focussing press
attention on them rather than on the President's own misdeeds. One reason is that there was an even more
interesting personal question, both then and now: could these two aggressive defenders truly have believed the
President's slippery denials? Blumenthal's answer is that, on the day the story appeared, he discussed the situation
with the President and reached a tacit willingness to suspend disbelief. Both the President and his wife "wanted me
to believe the story as he told it," Blumenthal writes, "because he wanted her to believe it and she wanted to believe
him."

In Hillary's version, she did believe her husband, right up to the day, seven months later, when he was forced to
confess in his deposition. Their lawyer, Bob Barnett, tried to warn her the night before that maybe "there's more to
this than you know," but even then, she writes, she stuck with her credulity. " 'Look, Bob,' I said. 'My husband may
have his faults, but he has never lied to me.' " When she learns the following morning that he had indeed lied, she
writes, "I was dumbfounded, heartbroken and outraged that I'd believed him at all."

Like Blumenthal's, Clinton's book melds together disparate forms. One is a traditionally treacly First Lady memoir,
similar to the ghosted efforts that were produced for most of her predecessors, which dutifully describes the
pleasures of meeting so many fascinating people in so many far-flung places, all with touching tales and meaningful
lessons. In other sections, she has produced a typical campaign biography, the sort designed to lay the ground for
a future candidacy, which chronicles the formative events in her life, her evolving philosophy, and the ideals that
motivate her.

Not all of it is formulaic. There are passages that read as if she grabbed the keyboard away from her ghostwriters in
order to shake free from the perception of phoniness that dogs her. She is particularly affecting when she describes
her protective feelings toward her daughter, Chelsea, and even somewhat wry about the empty-nest syndrome that
descended when Chelsea left for Stanford. "Sometimes I'd catch Bill just sitting in Chelsea's bedroom, looking
around wistfully," she writes. "I had to admit that my husband and I were caught up in a generational cliche, a
milestone in life that only members of our self-conscious age group would define as a syndrome."

On policy issues as well, she is often revealing. She provides, for example, a detailed description of her role in the
debates over the President's welfare-reform proposals, and says, "I told him and his top staff that I would speak out
against any bill" if it did not contain certain liberal safeguards. Unlike previous First Ladies, she is not shy about
crediting herself as a full policy partner: "By the time Bill and I left the White House, welfare rolls had dropped 60
percent." She tells how she pushed her husband to barrel ahead with her doomed plan for national health-care
coverage, and in a small deviation from the account by Blumenthal, who is not even mentioned until page 422 of
her book, she takes a good deal of the credit for organizing the Third Way discussions with Prime Minister Blair.

What's most striking, however, is the way she has interspersed her campaign biography and First Lady memoir with
sections in which, like Blumenthal, she wages a Manichaean struggle against the Vast Conspiracy. Despite the
drama of the four pages describing her fury at her husband's betrayal, most of her anger in the five hundred and

                                                                                                           Page 5 of 6
                             FIGHTING WORDS; The White House memoir grows claws.

thirty other pages is directed at the enemies she claims sought to destroy his Presidency. This is what motivated
her, she says, to reconcile with her husband. "If men like Starr and his allies could ignore the Constitution and
abuse power for ideological and malicious ends to topple a President, I feared for my country," she explains. "Bill's
Presidency, the institutional Presidency and the integrity of the Constitution hung in the balance. I knew what I did
and said in the next days and weeks would influence not just Bill's future and mine, but also America's."

She is no less assertive than Blumenthal in her depiction of the enemies they were battling:

I do believe there was, and still is, an interlocking network of groups and individuals who want to turn the clock back
on many of the advances our country has made, from civil rights and women's rights to consumer and
environmental regulation, and they use all the tools at their disposal-money, power, influence, media and politics-to
achieve their ends. In recent years, they have also mastered the politics of personal destruction. Fueled by
extremists who have been fighting progressive politicians and ideas for decades, they are funded by corporations,
foundations and individuals like Richard Mellon Scaife.

Although she does not descend to the "politics of personal destruction"- there are no dark intimations of murder or
sex scandals-she is not averse to firing a bit of buckshot. When Newt Gingrich's mother let slip that her son, the
new House Speaker, often referred to Hillary as a "bitch," she invited them both, along with his "then wife," to the
White House. What ensues is a scene in which Gingrich's wife belittles him for babbling about things he does not
understand, and his mother retorts, "Newty always knows what he's talking about." Similarly, she ridicules Chief
Justice William Rehnquist for presiding over her husband's Senate trial wearing a robe he had designed with
chevrons of gold braid. "He said he got the idea from the costumes in a production of Gilbert & Sullivan's comic
opera Iolanthe," she writes. "How fitting that he should wear a theatrical costume to preside over a political farce."

Both Blumenthal and Clinton, with their wrenching lurches from policy discourses to scandal dissections, are able to
re-create the vertigo of the era, during which missile attacks on Al Qaeda came in the wake of squirmy testimony
about inappropriate behavior, and stories about Moscow summits vied with those about distinguishing genital
characteristics. They also present a largely persuasive case that prosecutors and the press (though not the
American public) became overly, even weirdly, obsessed with the Whitewater story. Combined with their excesses
of loyalty and their unwillingness to reflect on the President's pathological indiscipline, the result is yet another type
of vertigo: that which comes from rolling your eyes and nodding your head at the same time.

These books, of course, will not for a moment sway any of the Clintons' ardent adversaries, nor does that seem to
be their intention. Like much of the discourse from the period, they appear to be meant to stoke old partisan
arguments rather than to quell them. In this they exemplify the very trend-the shrilling of political discourse-that they
decry.

Raucous, partisan debate can be healthy, up to a point, and liberals will point out that conservatives have
heretofore dominated the best-seller lists, as well as cable television, and have been notably more aggressive in
tearing down their opponents. Partly that is because liberals are less cohesive and angry, more timid and easily
cowed. Even when liberals have strong beliefs, they act as if they were not quite sure they actually agree with them.
They are congenitally more comfortable humming the theme of "All Things Considered" than the theme of
"Crossfire."

Until now, the most successful authors on the provocative left have been those who cloaked their jabs with humor,
such as Michael Moore, Molly Ivins and Al Franken. This may be changing. All three will be publishing more
pugnacious books this year, and so will the liberal columnists Paul Krugman and Joe Conason. Eventually, they
may even be joined by Bill Clinton, if he decides to emulate his wife and his old Knight Templar by producing a
memoir that ravages as well as ruminates.

All this best-selling bellicosity is likely to continue the trend away from the old recollected-in-tranquillity manner of
White House memoirs. At the very least, it will make for more interesting reading. And we are unlikely to miss, at
least for a while, the quaint platitudes of a Raymond Moley, who concluded his memoir by calling for a future
politics based on "fine thinking and generous impulse."

                                                                                   Page 6 of 6

ECONOMISTS ARE ADMITTING TO CONFUSION, ALWAYS A bad sign. The American economy has entered "a
baffling twilight zone," writes Robert J. Samuelson. "People yearn for clarity and confidence, while the new
stagnation provides mainly uncertainty and contradiction."

The Federal Reserve seems particularly vexed. Profits and productivity are up, but growth is negligible and
employment is down. The Fed's governors have been cutting interest rates since January 2001 -- 12 separate cuts,
taking interest rates on overnight bank loans from 6.5 percent down to 1.25 percent, the lowest level in 40 years --
yet the layoffs keep coming. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting recovery, but recovery hasn't
appeared. Testifying before Congress in late April, Greenspan prophesied a better second half of 2003. "I think it
includes jobs," he said.

Companies, the Fed complains, aren't expanding as they should. "An undercurrent of pessimism has persisted
among business leaders for some time now," Fed governor Ben Bernanke recently grumped, "more so than can be
accounted for by what seem to be the generally good fundamentals of the U.S. economy."

Official unemployment now stands at 6 percent; 8.8 million Americans are unemployed, an increase of 3 million
since October 2000. The specter stalking the Fed is that of deflation, something that our central bank has not
concerned itself with since the Great Depression. The Fed's most recent report warns, in ever-cloudy Fedspeak, of
an "unwelcome substantial fall in inflation." No one is anticipating a 1930s-style collapse of prices, wages and
employment, but the threat of prolonged stagnation, with all its quiet human disasters, is very real.

Several decades ago, French social commentator Alain Minc wrote evocatively of a "slow 1929," in which the
economy, bolstered by the safety nets put in place in response to the real 1929, does not crash; it sags. We seem
to be in a slow 1929 right now: Wages decline slightly (by 1.5 percent over the past year for workers at the median
income level), work-weeks grow shorter (to 34 hours, the lowest level since the government started measuring
workweeks in 1964), health-insurance premiums and co-payments grow more costly, and factories don't run at full
speed. (In fact, they're running at the lowest level of capacity since 1983.) Growth creeps along (rising at a 1.6
percent annual rate in the first three months of 2003) but productivity grows faster (at nearly 2.5 percent). America
can increase its output by 2.5 percent, therefore, without hiring more workers. To hire more workers, growth has to
outpace productivity. It's not.

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 5
      Squandering Prosperity; George W. Bush has the worst economic record of any president since Herbert
                               Hoover. But can the Democrats exploit that at all?

Disasters occur, but discretely and discreetly: Medicaid is cut, and seniors can no longer afford their medication;
college tuitions are raised, and students have to leave school.

And jobs are lost: The private sector has shrunk by more than 2.6 million jobs since George W. Bush became
president. That is, by any standard, quite a record: No American president has presided over a net loss of jobs
during his term in office since Herbert Hoover grappled so disastrously with the real 1929. When Bill Clinton was in
the White House, America gained an average of 239,000 jobs per month. Since Bush took office, the number of
jobs has declined at a monthly clip of 69,000.

On the basis of no credible evidence whatsoever, the White House boasts that Bush's proposed tax cut would
create 1.4 million jobs by the end of 2004. Even if it did, Bush would still have presided over a net loss of 1.3 million
jobs during the 2001 -- 2005 presidential term.

PRESIDENTS DO NOT REALLY PAY A PENALTY FOR HOLDING office when the economy first implodes.
Americans did not turn against Hoover because the market crashed; they turned against him because his recovery
program, such as it was, failed to produce a recovery, because the economy cascaded downward for three and a
half years while he rejected one plausible remedy after another. Likewise, no one holds Bush accountable for the
dot-com bust or the shock of September 11. His problems are that he's enacted and proposed nothing that would
arrest the current slide, and that his policies have actually worsened it.

More precisely, his policy has actually worsened it. For it is the distinctive feature of the Bush presidency that there
is but one economic policy come boom or bust, fire or flood. That, of course, is tax cuts, preponderantly for the rich.
As a candidate in 2000, Bush argued for tax cuts because the government was actually running a surplus, and it
was a more productive use of funds to return that money to taxpayers. Then the bubble burst, the surplus turned to
deficit and those same tax cuts were repackaged as an economic stimulus. The $ 1.6 trillion tax cut of 2001 was so
advertised, though it didn't really kick in for the better part of the decade, and most of it was targeted to the wealthy
-- the class of Americans least likely to spend it. Since it was enacted, it has stimulated the economy to the tune of
1.7 million jobs lost.

Undeterred, the administration is back at it again with its proposed $ 726 billion tax cut, more than half of which
takes the form of eliminating the taxes on dividends -- which, again, will go overwhelmingly to the rich. It's difficult
to find anyone not working for the administration who believes this cut will really stimulate the economy. Though
virtually no one noticed (there was a war on), in mid-March the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued its study
of the Bush tax cut. "Taken together," the report concluded, "the proposals would provide a relatively small impetus
in an economy the size of the United States." The study had been supervised by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who came to
the CBO after serving as chief economist for Bush's Council of Economic Advisers.

The hallmark of the Bush approach to the economy is its absolute rigidity. On matters economic, Bush is a
monomaniac with a bad idea, a doctor who prescribes the same all-purpose snake oil no matter what the ailment.
And while Bush is not responsible for the post-boom bust in which America finds itself, his refusal to contemplate
any remedy save his own for the economy is directly responsible for the increasing longevity and severity of the
bust.

Rigidity should be the last thing you want in a president forced to navigate a treacherous economy. "If we can't get
a president with a fluid mind," noted Raymond Moley in the spring of 1932, "we shall have some bad times ahead."
Moley at that time was just beginning his stint as head of Franklin Roosevelt's brain trust, the academic advisers on
whom Roosevelt relied to help formulate fixes for the Depression. Moley needn't have worried about Roosevelt,
who mixed and matched, embraced and abandoned a range of economic strategies during his '32 campaign -- and
then his first three years in the White House -- before settling upon the policies we now think of as the core of the
New Deal. Surrounding himself with advisers who favored a centralized, planned economy, others who
recommended stronger antitrust enforcement and more regulation, and still others who argued for bolstering
working-class purchasing power, FDR's credo for a nation in trouble was, "Above all, try something."

                                                                                                  Page 3 of 5
      Squandering Prosperity; George W. Bush has the worst economic record of any president since Herbert
                               Hoover. But can the Democrats exploit that at all?

"This country is big enough to experiment with several diverse systems and follow several different lines,"
Roosevelt once told adviser Adolph Berle. "Why must we put our economic policy in a single systemic straitjacket?"
A sentiment more alien to Bush is hard to imagine.


WITH THE ECONOMY GOING NOWHERE BUT SOUTH, THE administration has been obliged to come up with an
explanation for the downturn that directs responsibility away from the White House. Until 9-11, the recession was
Bill Clinton's fault; thereafter, it was Osama bin Laden's and, more recently, Saddam Hussein's. Here, from a
recent stump speech, is the president's explanation of the economy: "We've got a deficit because we went through
a recession. We've got a recession because we went to war, and I said to our troops, 'If we're going to commit you
into harm's way, you deserve the best equipment, the best training, the best possible pay.'"

If the president's account is accurate, we've just gone through the first defense buildup in modern history that
depressed rather than boosted the economy. A more plausible calculation, from Larry Mishel of the Economic
Policy Institute, is that new defense spending will add 0.4 percent to the gross domestic product this year alone.
The somewhat more sophisticated version of Bush's self-exculpatory account is that business refused to invest
more due to the uncertainty attending the coming war. But that gainsays almost everything business leaders
themselves are telling us.

"There's a wide gap between economists and business executives," Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist (though
one who's business executive -- friendly) of Wells Fargo, remarked recently. "Businesses are basically shell-
shocked. They want to see demand rising first."

In fact, what the economy is going through is a classic case of excessive productive capacity built up in a boom
time in anticipation of a demand that never came. In 1998 productive capacity was increasing at an annual 8
percent rate in manufacturing, with huge investments in telecommunications and high-tech that were helping drive
the boom. Not surprisingly, it's here that the bust is concentrated today. Since July of 2000, America has lost 2.2
million jobs in manufacturing; indeed, manufacturing jobs have now declined for 33 consecutive months, which is
the longest period of job loss in the post -- World War II era. And because manufacturing jobs pay significantly
better than retail and service-sector jobs, the impact on the economy is magnified.

The other engine driving the boom was the market itself, in which investors placed bets on the future value of
companies that proved to be largely, if not entirely, illusory. Thanks to the deregulation of financial endeavor --
bringing with it the decline of accounting standards, the systemic overvaluation of stocks by analysts, the fictitious
bookkeeping of Enron and the like -- $ 7 trillion invested in U.S. stock markets has been lost since the bubbled burst
in 2000. This has not worked wonders for consumer confidence.

Alongside the problems of vanishing capital and manufacturing decline is that of inadequate purchasing power.
Median earnings grew consistently during the near-full employment years of 1998 -- 2001, but they've been falling
now for the past four quarters. With wages drifting downward, American consumers -- even if they saved some
money by refinancing their homes -- are not going to shop their way out of the current downturn.

In sum, the current economy is one in which any number of classical Keynesian remedies to boost purchasing
power could be applied, particularly with the Fed warning of deflation, not inflation. The administration not only
shuns contact with Keynesians, however, it shuns contact with any economists -- save supply-siders -- who've
endorsed its tax cuts, as a number of deficit-conscious business economists have been heard to complain.

By insisting on tax cuts for the rich, moreover, the administration blocks any efforts at real stimulus. In the White
House's legislation, no federal funds will flow to the states, which are experiencing the same revenue decline the
federal government is. Unlike the federal government, however, they have to balance their budgets. The estimated
$ 68 billion in deficits that the states are running this year (a total that is expected to rise to $ 140 billion over three
years) is coming out of health-care coverage for children and the poor, out of K-12 classrooms, out of the pockets of
students who can't afford the tuition increases at public colleges and universities. It is coming out of the jobs of
state, city, public-health and school-district employees. By his obsession with cutting taxes on the rich, George W.

                                                                                                  Page 4 of 5
      Squandering Prosperity; George W. Bush has the worst economic record of any president since Herbert
                               Hoover. But can the Democrats exploit that at all?

Bush is not only failing to provide an urgently needed stimulus, he's actually deepening a downturn he could
alleviate.

He could, if he chose, boost purchasing power or halt layoffs by directing his tax cuts to low- and middle-income
families, or by providing relief to state governments, or by funding a massive renovation and construction of
schools. He could ease the rising burden of costs experienced by nearly every American family by creating a
system of universal health coverage. But as Bush sees it, he is in office precisely not to do these things. On
matters economic, he is there to shrink the role of the public sphere and magnify the market. Recovery is all well
and good, but it is not his primary purpose as president.


CAN BUSH GET AWAY WITH IT? CAN HE TURN IN THE MOST dismal economic performance of any president
in decades and still win re-election?

Perhaps. The economy will have to loom larger in voters' minds than the amorphous war on terrorism, in which, we
can be certain, the administration will find new threats and exploit old ones. The Democrats need a candidate who
stands for homeland and defense security, and -- in contrast to Bush -- economic security as well. And their
candidate needs an economic agenda that plausibly addresses Americans' anxieties about their health care, their
jobs and their children's educations. A program that merely contains economic insecurity rather than attacking it
will only guarantee a second term for Bush.

But even if the economy doesn't improve, and even if the Democrats put forth a credible economic program, that's
still no guarantee of a Democratic victory. To begin with, the politics of a slow 1929 don't resemble those of the
original article. Slow 1929s don't wipe out tens of millions of families. According to some recent polling, the most
ubiquitous way in which families are experiencing the downturn right now is having to cope with increased medical
expenses. In some households, that will mean more illness; in a relative few, death; in many, increased anxiety
and cutting back on other necessities. In aggregate, though, these do not portend a political groundswell to sweep
Bush from the White House.

"Six percent unemployment won't turn Bush out of office," says a consultant to one of the Democratic presidential
candidates. "It will have to go to 8 or 9 percent, just for starters. Besides, the public has less and less confidence
that the government can manage the economy. Their understanding of the economy comes largely from the
business and right-wing press; if there's anyone they hold responsible, it's Greenspan. I'm not sure the Democrats
have anything programmatic to say that will convince people the economy will perk up."

Whatever short-term fixes the Democrats may offer, then, they also need to find a way to talk about the larger
economic health of the nation. Above all, they need to draw a clear line between Bush's preference for tax cuts and
their own preference for a major national investment in health care, education and transportation. On this question,
in poll after poll, the public unambiguously favors the Democrats' investments over Bush's cuts. Among the
presidential candidates, Missouri Congressman Dick Gephardt has already begun this discussion; his fellow
candidates would do well to snipe at him less and develop their own alternatives more.

As for Bush, the responsibility for dealing with the economy is now entirely his. With interest rates hovering at 1
percent, Greenspan is running out of tools to fix this mess. With the election year now taking shape, Bush's one-
note obsession with tax cuts presents the Democrats with their best opportunity. And the economy with its gravest
threat.

 In this week's column, I'd like to raise two questions suggested by David Beito's excellent book The New Deal's
War on the Bill of Rights, which I reviewed last week. First, how can it be that Franklin Roosevelt has acquired a
reputation among leftist historians as a champion of liberty, with his internment of Japanese Americans during
World War II regarded as an aberration, in the face of the manifold violations of civil liberties that occurred during
his administration? Second, given Roosevelt's authoritarian proclivities, why wasn't he successful in imposing the
complete regime of censorship he wanted?

 The answer to the first question is that Roosevelt preferred in most cases to work behind the scenes, aiding and
abetting others to do his work. We see this in the activities of Hugo Black and Sherman Minton, both senators and
later Supreme Court justices, whom Roosevelt assiduously encouraged and promoted.
 Black, who from 1935 chaired the US Senate Special Subcommittee to Investigate Lobbying Activities,
subpoenaed a vast number of telegrams from opponents of the New Deal, putting their activities under surveillance
in an effort to intimidate them. As Beito explains,
 The committee monitored private communications on a scale previously unrivaled in US history, at least in
peacetime. Working in tandem with the Federal Communications Commission and the Roosevelt administration, it
examined literally millions of private telegrams with virtually no supervision or constraint. Those singled out for this
surveillance were anti-New Deal critics, including activists, journalists, and lawyers.
 In acting in this fashion, Black was doing what Roosevelt wanted.

 The committee's most powerful champion was Roosevelt himself, though he carefully avoided tipping his hand in
public. ... Roosevelt responded to [Raymond] Moley with 'a long discourse of how Black's invasion of privacy had
ample precedent.' The inference drawn by Moley was that for Roosevelt 'the end justified the means.' The
conversation left Moley 'with the harrowing intimation that Roosevelt was looking forward to nothing more than
having the opposition of his 'enemies'-the newspapers, the bankers, the businessmen-reelect him.' ... The Black
Committee was first and foremost a creature of Roosevelt's wish to establish a congressional committee to discredit
opponents. After the president had made that decision, he sought out Black, a loyal political foot soldier, to take
charge.
 Roosevelt appointed Black to a vacancy on the Supreme Court in 1936, knowing that he could count on that
stalwart New Dealer to uphold all his unconstitutional programs. When it became public knowledge the next year
that Black had, in the words of Charles Tansill, 'hidden his face beneath the hooded robes of a Klansman,' there
was a clamor for Black to resign, but Roosevelt did not join it, even though Black admitted having been a KKK

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3

member. Many years later, Black ironically earned a reputation as a 'free speech' absolutist, although he still
defended his vote in Korematsu v. United States upholding Roosevelt's order to intern Japanese Americans in
concentration camps. According to Beito, 'Black ... was unrepentant. In 1971, he asserted that '[p]eople were
rightfully fearful of the Japanese in Los Angeles. ... They all look alike to a person not a Jap. Had [Japan] attacked
our shores, you'd have had a large number fighting with the Japanese troops.''
 After his victory in the election of 1936, Roosevelt was determined to destroy those who had lobbied against his
plan to pack the Supreme Court and against other New Deal measures. Probably the most important such group
was the National Committee to Uphold Constitutional Government (NCUCG). Much of the day-to-day administration
of this committee was conducted by Edward Rumely, who proved able and efficient in his job. Minton's chief tactic
in disabling the group was to subpoena the tax records of its principal contributors, hoping that bringing their names
before the public would make them reluctant to give more money. When Rumely and others challenged this gross
invasion of privacy, Minton responded by releasing some of the tax records of the organization to the public.
Roosevelt fully backed Minton and asked J. Edgar Hoover to conduct an FBI investigation of Rumely. Beito
describes this sad chain of events:
 New Dealers seemed to have found an ideal champion in Sherman Minton. As a biographer put it, his loyalty to the
president and his agenda 'uncommon even among fellow true-believers,' included a 'strong streak of populism, and
belief that government must be powerful'. ... In December 1937, Roosevelt affirmed his confidence in the Minton
Committee by inviting all three Democratic members to an eight-man 'council of war' to plot strategy for 1938 ...
Minton articulated the group's consensus by recommending a fighting stance. 'The opposition isn't satisfied with a
conciliatory attitude,' he declared. 'The only thing they understand is a swift kick where it hurts.' He urged a 'crack
down' on the taxes of the rich. ... Roosevelt was more than receptive, chiming in, 'We have just begun to fight.'
 It is clear that Roosevelt wanted the total suppression of his critics, and this leads to our second question: Why did
he fail to achieve his goal? He won some victories: for example, the NCUCG suffered a major loss in funding due to
Minton's efforts. But Roosevelt did not succeed in imposing totalitarian control. One reason for this, and it is a
reason that is instructive for our own troubled times, is that his efforts at suppression met resolute opposition, and
not only from those directly targeted. Many among those with impeccably pro-Roosevelt credentials, as well as
libertarians such as Albert Jay Nock and H.L. Mencken, who could not be dismissed as lobbyists for big business,
avowed their support for civil liberties, and the public pressure forced Roosevelt and his senatorial entourage to
back down.
 The ever-persistent Norman Thomas [a frequent Socialist Party candidate for president] charged that Roosevelt
represented 'the party of Frank Hague [a corrupt and tyrannical New Jersey political boss,]' while Albert Jay Nock,
an individualist and civil libertarian, blamed what he regarded as Roosevelt's disdain for the Constitution on New
Deal policies of centralization. Roosevelt, according to Nock, 'advises Congressmen not to be too particular about
the constitutionality of a measure which interests him. ... Given a Roosevelt who manipulates or disregards the law
as he sees fit, and you immediately spawn a tribe of Murphys, Hagues, Ickeses, Wallaces, Blacks, Mintons, who
may freely manipulate or disregard the law as they see fit' (emphasis Nock's)
 Faced with today's government schemes to deprive us of our liberties, such as 'gun control' and the restriction of
'hate speech,' it is imperative that we fight back.

Jun 22, 2020( Cato@Liberty: http://www.cato .org/blog Delivered by Newstex) ;; George Selgin[1]"It is difficult to
think of an important aspect of the New Deal to which Roosevelt had not plainly pledged himself before taking
office. Roosevelt had campaigned on a clear and specific New Deal Program." (Eric Rauchway, Winter War, pp. 15-
17.)To understand the New Deal's shortcomings as a grand scheme for achieving economic recovery, it helps to
realize that the New Deal wasn't a grand scheme at all, but an assemblage of steps and programs, many of which
were decided upon or concocted only after Roosevelt took office.But if I'm to expect you to see the New Deal that
way, I must first convince you that Eric Rauchway's opposite claim isn't true.

Hence this post, which (unlike most others to come) is about history, but not so much about economics. If you're
only here for the econ., you might skip it without fear of not being able to follow others in this series. Rauchway's
RevisionismAccording to Rauchway, most of the New Deal's important components had been planned and pledged
to well before FDR took office. Rauchway's view goes hand-in-hand with his portrayal of the New Deal as a well-
oiled, supercharged recovery machine. In contrast my own view of the New Deal, as a set of make-shift remedies,
makes it seem more likely to have had the U.S. economy bucking and stalling like an ill-tuned jalopy.Of the two
views, mine is (for once) the more orthodox. Although journalist Robert Wright took poetic license when he wrote,
back in 2001[2], that "FDR threw a bunch of policies against the wall, and the ones that stuck became the New
Deal," his opinion isn't all that far removed from what most New Deal historians believe. Roger Daniels, in his 2015
book Road to the New Deal[3], even goes so far as to say that "The notion that when Franklin Roosevelt became
president he had a plan in his head called the New Deal is a myth no serious scholar has ever believed."Rauchway
is certainly a serious scholar. So, how has he come to his unorthodox view? In brief, he argues (1) that the New
Deal must have been a coherent and well-advertised program, as well as a radical one, for otherwise Hoover
couldn't have made opposition to it the cornerstone of his own presidential campaign; (2) that the memories and
motives of FDR's own colleagues and advisors who insist there was no plan can't be trusted; (3) that other
historians haven't examined the right documents; and (4) that the orthodox view can't possibly be right because it
implies that Roosevelt misled voters, depriving his program of "democratic legitimacy," whereas it's clear that
democratic legitimacy "was the New Deal's ultimate goal."Most of these arguments seem easily answered.
Concerning "democratic legitimacy": that Roosevelt didn't tell voters just "what he was going to do" needn't mean
that he hoodwinked them. It could (and did in fact) mean that he himself had no precise idea what he would do once
in office. Concerning Hoover: although he did say things[4] like "they [i.e., the Democrats] are proposing changes
and so-called new deals which would destroy the very foundations of our American system," it is of course common
for candidates to accuse their opponents of harboring sinister plans. If Hoover's frightening portrayal of FDR's plans
was unusual, it was not because it accurately represented the avowed designs of FDR or his party, but because
Hoover appears to have sincerely believed it. Concerning other historians missing key sources: if so, then

                                                                                                            Page 2 of 5
                             The New Deal and Recovery, Part 2: Inventing the New Deal

Rauchway ought to supply direct proof of his own thesis from these. But he never does.What Rauchway does do is
either ignore or dismiss key documents informing the orthodox view, including the testimonies of Raymond
Moley[5] and Frances Perkins[6], two of FDR's closest associates. According to Moley, the first member of FDR's
"brain trust," believing that New Deal policies were "the result of a unified plan" is like believing "that the
accumulation of stuffed snakes, baseball pictures, school flags, old tennis shoes, carpenter's tools, and chemistry
sets in a boys bedroom could have been put there by an interior decorator." Although he cites Moley extensively,
Rauchway doesn't mention this statement. Dissing Frances PerkinsMoley eventually parted company with FDR, so
perhaps his testimony is jaundiced. The same certainly can't be said of the testimony of Frances Perkins, who first
served with FDR in Albany and was secretary of labor for all four of his terms in Washington. In The Roosevelt I
knew, her 1946 memoir, Perkins writes:The notion that the New Deal had a preconceived theoretical position is
ridiculous. The pattern it was to assume was not clear or specific in Roosevelt's mind, in the mind of the Democratic
party, or in the mind of anyone else taking part in the 1932 campaign. "Not clear or specific." Although Rauchway
does refer to this passage, he avoids quoting these words flatly contradicting his own. Instead he opines,
condescendingly, that while "Perkins may have been a great secretary of labor she was a poor historian: not a word
of her remarks is true."Why would Perkins not tell the truth? "In reminiscing," Rauchway says, "she may merely
have forgotten how things stood thirteen years before." But thirteen years isn't so long, after all; and "ridiculous" isn't
the sort of adjective one uses to describe something one isn't certain about. Nor, for that matter, is it likely that
Perkins' foggy memory inspired not only the passage in question, but several others to the very same effect that
Rauchway doesn't quote. Passages likeWhen Franklin Roosevelt and his administration began their work in
Washington in March 1933, the New Deal was not a plan with form and content. It was a happy phrase he had
coined during the campaign, and its value was psychological. It made people feel better, and in that terrible period
of depression they needed to feel better, andIt is important to repeat, the New Deal was not a plan, not even an
agreement, and it was certainly not a plot, as was later charged. This last statement reads almost as if Perkins
wanted to make sure no one would attribute her other statements to mere heedlessness.There are also other
passages referring to specific New Deal programs. For example, Perkins observes that as late as April 1933 FDR's
"mind was as innocent as a child's of any such program as the NRA." In fact, far from being confined to scattered
obiter dicta, Perkins' claim that the New Deal wasn't planned in advance forms one of her memoir's central
themes.But Rauchway has an answer to this as well. "In reminiscing," he says, "Perkins may have wanted to
minimize Roosevelt's own role in the New Deal so she could maximize her own." To call this charge against
Perkins, who has been described[7] as "a modest woman" who "didn't care if other people took credit," and who by
all accounts was fiercely loyal to FDR, "far-fetched," is being charitable. "Shabby" is more like it. The New Deal and
the FDR's CampaignLet's now consider the facts of the case. They are, in brief, that while a few elements of what
the "New Deal" came to mean in practice were spelled-out clearly enough beforehand, many others, including most
of the New Deal's "recovery" components, weren't. Nor is it likely they could have been anticipated, or that
Roosevelt would have divulged them if they had been.As for what Roosevelt did make explicit, until his nomination
his most revealing remarks came during his May 22, 1932 speech at Oglethorpe University[8]. Here he spoke of
"the vital necessity of planning for definite objectives." But if Roosevelt already had a plan in mind he revealed
nothing of its content. Instead he declared that "the country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is common
sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try another. But above all, try something." This was
indeed an accurate indication of what was to come. But what it described was more like a plan to throw policies
against a wall to see which ones stuck than a "clear and specific New Deal program." The closest Roosevelt came
in his speech to announcing even part of such a program was in declaring it "self-evident that we must restore
commodities to a level approximating their dollar value of several years ago or else see more defaults or loan write-
downs." Even so, he didn't say how he planned to get "commodities" up again.From the opening of the Democratic
National Convention on June 27th, 1932, the Democratic platform[9] became the official statement of FDR's
intentions, to which he solemnly agreed to adhere. "We believe," it declared,that a party platform is a covenant with
the people to have [sic] faithfully kept by the party when entrusted with power, and that the people are entitled to
know in plain words the terms of the contract to which they are asked to subscribe. If there was ever an opportunity
for the Democrats to reveal a "clear and specific" New Deal program, this was surely it. But while the platform listed
some measures that would indeed be part of the actual New Deal, as far as the New Deal's recovery initiatives are
concerned, it was more misleading than prescient. The platform promised:"an immediate and drastic reduction of
governmental expendituresto accomplish a saving of not less than twenty-five per cent in the cost of the Federal
Government"; "a federal budget annually balanced on the basis of accurate executive estimates within revenues,

                                                                                                           Page 3 of 5

raised by a system of taxation levied on the principle of ability to pay"; "a sound currency to be preserved at all
hazards and an international monetary conference called on the invitation of our government"; "strengthening and
impartial enforcement of the anti-trust laws, to prevent monopoly and unfair trade practices, and revision thereof for
the better protection of labor and the small producer and distributor." The platform also "condemn[ed] the
extravagance of the [Hoover administration's] Farm Board," including its "unsound policy of restricting agricultural
products to the demands of domestic markets."As we'll see, Roosevelt did in fact try to cut spending and balance
the federal budget. But he was unsuccessful on both scores; and today it is the growth in spending, and especially
in deficit spending, during the New Deal that is said to have contributed to the recovery as an early application of
supposedly "Keynesian" thinking. (I'll address Keynes's actual influence on Roosevelt's policies in a later post.) As
for "strengthening and impartial enforcement of the anti-trust laws," the National Recovery Administration, one of
the actual New Deal's centerpieces, would do just the opposite. A second New Deal centerpiece, the Agricultural
Adjustment Association, would, through its "domestic allotment" plan, implement the very "policy of restricting
agricultural products to the demands of domestic markets" that the platform expressly condemned.{1][10]Turning to
monetary policy, that the "bank holiday" and Emergency Banking Act were adventitious measures rather than ones
FDR had been planning all along should go without saying. The promised "international monetary conference" was
actually scuttled by Roosevelt. As for the other monetary measures that were to be chiefly responsible for
aggregate demand growth during the New Deal era—suspending gold payments, and devaluing the dollar—the
platform never so much as hints at them. On the contrary: it assures voters that a "sound currency is to be
preserved at all hazards."Some commentators claim that the phrase "sound currency" was vague enough to avoid
committing Roosevelt to maintaining the gold standard; and in his 1936 book Half Way with Roosevelt Ernest
Lindley explains that the word "gold" wasn't mentioned because "the silverites and other advocates of price-lifting
by monetary action were strong enough to keep it out." The fact remains, however, that "sound currency" is just a
variant of "sound money," which itself comes from the French "monnaie sonnante et trbuchante." This literally
means "money that rings and stumbles"; but it stands for full-weight or standard, as opposed to debased, precious
metal coins, which actually sound different than their debased counterparts when tossed onto and allowed to
"stumble" on a hard surface. In other words, to practically everyone who heard it in 1932, including banker James
Warburg[11], who was to be one of Roosevelt's more savvy financial advisors, and who felt bitterly betrayed by his
decision to go off gold, the Democrats' promise to preserve "sound currency" could mean nothing other than that
FDR did not plan to toy with the gold standard.Once again: none of this is meant to deny that the platform did point
clearly enough to some actual New Deal measures, including its extensive public works program, the Glass-
Steagall Act's separation of investment from commercial banking, the TVA, unemployment insurance, and social
security. But the anticipated bits almost all had to do with relief and reform, rather than recovery. So far as the
voting public was concerned, the New Deal's recovery plan, to the extent that it was a plan at all, was a black
box.Nor is it the case that Roosevelt clarified matters by explicitly departing from any part of the platform. Instead, in
his nomination acceptance speech[12] FDR said, "I have many things on which I want to make my position clear at
the earliest possible moment in this campaign. That admirable document, the platform which you have adopted, is
clear. I accept it 100 percent. And you can accept my pledge that I will leave no doubt or ambiguity on where I stand
on any question of moment in this campaign." While it certainly can't be said that FDR led a campaign free of
"doubt and ambiguity," he gave the public no reason to doubt that he meant to keep his word. A Secret New
Deal?Nor, to judge from press reports, did the public doubt him. That is, they believed that the New Deal would be
just as the Democratic platform described it, and not a far more ambitious program that would radically depart from
that platform in many respects. Reporting just after the election, The Economist expressed a common opinion in
saying that it didn'tanticipate that any very radical experiments will be made. We doubt whether Mr Roosevelt, in
any attempt which he may make to lift America from the depression "by her own boot-jacks," will succeed in
evolving measures very different from those formulated and applied during the past two years by Mr Hoover. ("The
New President," November 12, 1932). Although it might have been expected to help the public to form a more
accurate picture of the coming New Deal, the interregnum—that is, the weeks separating FDR's election from his
inauguration—was marked by increasing rather than diminishing doubts as to just what the president-elect had in
mind. With just three weeks to go before FDR took the oath of office, The Economist (February 11, 1933) observed
that "The market has tacitly suspended action and judgment until the new Roosevelt administration has assumed
office and declared its policy on major questions" (my emphasis). It would, of course, have been perfectly
unnecessary for the incoming administration to "declare its policy on major questions" had FDR "campaigned on a
clear and specific New Deal Program" all along.That he didn't, and that the specifics of the actual New Deal would

                                                                                                             Page 4 of 5
                             The New Deal and Recovery, Part 2: Inventing the New Deal

often run counter to FDR's less-vague campaign pledges, raises two possibilities. One is that there really was no
well-worked-out New Deal plan, as Raymond Moley and Frances Perkins insisted. The other, which we must also
consider, is that there was such a plan, blueprinting more-or-less what took place, but that FDR kept it under his
hat. This last possibility appears especially plausible with respect to FDR's plans for the dollar. After all, if FDR did
in fact intend all along to suspend the gold standard and eventually devalue the dollar, he could hardly have
revealed these parts of his plan in advance! During the campaign Hoover repeatedly accused FDR of harboring
plans to abandon the gold standard in favor of "fiat money"; and by the closing weeks of Hoover's presidency many
had begun to suspect that Hoover might be right. Were they just falling for Hoover's FDR-bogeyman, or had Hoover
been onto something after all?The answer is a little of both. FDR wanted to keep his options open. ''I do not want to
commit to the gold standard," he told Brains Trust member Adolf Berle a few days before the election. "I haven't the
faintest idea whether we will be on the gold standard on March 4th or not; nobody can foresee where we shall be.'
"This was an astute position; but it spoke not of a definite plan for gold but of the folly of trying to formulate any such
plan.And that seems to have been FDR's position all along. Having carefully looked into the matter, Sebastian
Edwards concludes[13]that during the primary and presidential campaigns, neither Roosevelt nor his inner circle
had a strong view on gold or the dollar. Tinkering with the value of the currency was a possible area for
experimentation; but it was an option with a relatively low priority. Until inauguration day FDR's views on the gold
standard were ambivalent and noncommittal; he was neither a diehard fan of the system, nor was he a severe critic.
Nor, Edwards adds, had the Roosevelt team undertaken or commissioned any "studies that examined in detail what
would be the possible consequences of abandoning the gold standard." In short, while FDR may have
contemplated abandoning the gold standard, he certainly hadn't planned on it. What's more, nothing changed
during the interregnum: "To put it simply," Edwards says, "on March 4th, the day Franklin Delano Roosevelt was to
take over as President, there was no concrete or definitive plan for taking the U.S. off gold and devaluing the
dollar."What was true of FDR's secret plans for the dollar was almost certainly true of his other secret New Deal
plans, namely, that he didn't have any. That is, there is no reason to disbelieve what Francis Perkins, Raymond
Moley, and most historians have had to say on the subject. ***To conclude: "New Deal" rhetoric and revisionist
histories notwithstanding, FDR didn't come to Washington equipped with any well worked-out plan for ending the
Great Depression. Instead, his recovery plan was mostly rushed together during his famous first 100 days in office.
That some components of this hastily-assembled program should have failed to contribute to the recovery, and that
some may even have hindered it, should not seem all that surprising. But this is merely speaking of probabilities. I
still have to prove that certain New Deal programs did in fact impede recovery, and did so enough to justify the
claim that, taken as a whole, the New Deal, considered as a program for economic recovery, was a flop.Continue

___________________[1][16] Rauchway (Winter War, p. 97) ignores Roosevelt's pledge when he writes that "he
indicated his support for a "domestic allotment or something similar to it" by "ruling out other production-controlling
policies." Because the domestic allotment was itself the one agricultural production-control policy expressly ruled-
out by the Democratic platform, the fact that Roosevelt may also have ruled out others can hardly be reckoned an
instance of his having offered voters a "clear and specific" indication of what he would do once in office. What
happened in fact is that Henry Wallace[17], upon becoming Roosevelt's first secretary of agriculture, disregarded
the Democratic platform's condemnation of the domestic allotment idea—which had been put in it by then
Tennessee Senator (and future secretary of state) Cordell Hull[18]—and instead based the AAA on the Republican
platform,[19] which among other things had called for "control of [agricultural] production to such volume as will
balance supply with demand," where "demand" was understood to mean domestic demand alone. (See former
Iowa Senator Smith Brookhart's May 22, 1938 letter to Cordell Hull, here[20] at pp. 292ff.) The story is complicated
by the fact that while many Republican Senators and Congressmen, as well as some Farm Board officials, favored
a domestic allotment plan, Hoover himself vehemently opposed it while favoring a voluntary alternative. The
Republican      platform     left    room    for   either   option.     [Cross-posted     from      Alt-M.org[21]]   [   1]:

        By Alan Caruba


Historically, the Federal Reserve has had a poor record when it comes to correcting an economic slide into
Depression.

 In his book, œNew Deal or Raw Deal? historian Burton Folsom, Jr, asked and answered the question œWhat
caused the Great Depression? Among the factors he cited was the huge debt left over from World War One. In the
United States, the national debt had ballooned from $1.3 billion to $24 billion in three short years, half of which
consisted of loans made to the allies.


 Today the U.S. is feeling the impact of the aftermath of 9/11 when military action was taken first in 2001 and then in
2003. We are still in Afghanistan and Iraq without much to show for it. As opposed to short, preemptive, lightning
strikes, we have become involved in œnation building. Forgotten is the fact that it was the Russian intervention in
Afghanistan that ultimately brought down the former Soviet Union.

 In the 1930s, in addition to tariffs on imported goods, œThe third cause of the Great Depression was the poor
performance of the Federal Reserve, concluded Folsom. œThe Federal Reserve was created in 1913 to control the
money system by regulating interest rates and lending money to banks.


 In an eerie way, Raymond Moley, a member of Franklin D. Roosevelts œbrain trust of advisors and an initial
advocate of the New Deal, reflects the widespread perception of Barack Obama today. In 1933 Moley broke with
FDR and became a conservative. Following a meeting with FDR, Moley recorded his observations.

 œI was impressed as never before by the utter lack of logic of the man, the scantiness of his precise knowledge of
things that he was talking about, the gross inaccuracies in his statements, by the almost pathological lack of
sequence in his statements, by the complete rectitude that he felt as to his own conduct, by the immense and
growing egotism that come from his office, by his willingness to continue the excoriation of the press and business

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 4

in order to get votes for himself, by his indifference to what effort the long continued pursuit of these ends would
have upon the civilization in which he was playing a part.

This description of FDR is, in astonishing ways, a mirror image of Barack Hussein Obama.


 The dissatisfaction that Moley expressed has been manifested in the immergence of the Tea Party movement and
the rejection of many in Congress who supported Obamas agenda, including Obamacare, his failed efforts to jump-
start the economy with large, temporary stimulus bills, temporary housing rebates and business tax credits, and the
one-time cash-for-clunkers program that followed the federal takeover of General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Chrysler.

 There are harsh facts being ignored about the present economic crisis. More than 42 million Americans were on
food stamps in August, an all-time record and a number that is 17% higher than a year ago. The U.S. is
experiencing massive unemployment and the American Bankruptcy Institute predicts there will be an estimated 1.6
million consumer bankruptcies this year.

The U.S. government is completely and totally broke. A Boston University economics professor, Laurence J.
Kotlikoff, has concluded that the U.S. government is facing a œfiscal gap of $202 trillion dollars.


 John Allison, who for two decades served as chairman and CEO of BB&T (NYSE:BBT) , the nation's 10th largest
bank, told CNSNews.com that it is a œmathematical certaintythe United States government œwill go bankrupt
unless it dramatically changes its fiscal direction immediately.

 Having tried œquantitative easing once already the Federal Reserve is undertaking a second effort. It consists of
printing magical money and using it to purchase U.S. treasury securities. QE-1 cost $1.7 trillion and did not work.
QE-2 will fail as well to the tune of $0.9 trillion.

 The U.S. dollar has lost 50% of its purchasing power since 1986 and it has dropped 11% in value since June of this
year.

 Writing in the November 8 edition of The Wall Street Journal, Kevin M. Warsh, a member of the Federal Reserves
Board of Governors, went public to warn against QE-2. œFiscal authorities should resist the temptation to increase
government expenditures to compensate for shortfalls of private consumption and investment, said Warsh who
urged œa strict economic diet of fiscal austerity.

 Whether it is Congress or the Federal Reserve, the failures of the present reflect the failures of the past. Major
surgery is needed to pare the entitlement programs of Social Security and Medicare. Instead, Obamacare added
millions to the Medicare rolls.

 The government sponsored entities, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, need to be privatized to avoid using billions
more in public funds to save them and the too-big-to-fail banks that engaged in œliars loans; mortgage loans that
ignored prudent lending practices resulting in the housing market collapse.

 TARP did work as an emergency measure, but the government has got to stop being the lender of last resort. Its
our money.

 The Federal Reserve is contemplating the creation of œmagical money at a time when the U.S. economy is in
deep trouble. It is a trouble that can only be cured by retaining the Bush tax cuts and by simplifying the current
insane tax code. Why is there such slow growth? American corporations pay the second highest tax rate in the
world.

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 4
                                        The Federal Reserves Magic Money

 The burden of federal regulation must be reduced. Economists W. Mark and Nicole Crain, noted in a September
Wall Street Journal that œThe annual cost of federal regulations increased to more than $1.75 trillion in 2008, a 3%
real increase over five years, to about 14% of U.S. national income.


 The Presidents original economic advisors have departed. They, like Raymond Moley in the 1930s, know that he
is either clueless and/or resistant to any pragmatic solutions.

 The midterm elections gave power to the Republicans in the House, the branch from which all financial bills must
originate. Failing to do the same in the Senate, it may take two years to repeal Obamacare, but efforts must be
taken to defund it, to render it inoperable. The courts may offer relief with a decision that it is unconstitutional.

When the new Congress meets in January 2011, every pressure possible must be brought to bear on the Federal
Reserve to stop short-term failed œsolutions before the U.S. dollar is utterly debased.

Apr 14, 2021( Cato@Liberty: http://www.cato .org/blog Delivered by Newstex) ;; George Selgin[1]"This great Nation
will endure as it has endured, will revive and will prosper. [T]he only thing we have to fear is fear itself." —FDR, in
his first inaugural address. "There is no place for industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain."—Thomas Hobbes,
on the state of nature, in Leviathan.Not the Sum of its PartsSo far, I've tended to look at the New Deal as a set or
sequence of distinct government policies and programs, remarking on how each either contributed to or hampered
economic recovery.

I've also dealt only with those New Deal policies generally understood to have had promoting recovery as their aim.
But the New Deal was more than just a bunch of policies. As its very name indicates, it purported to be, and in
important respects it was, a novel policy regime, that is, a different overall approach to combating the depression,
and to economic policy more generally. The advent of a new policy regime, and expectations or apprehensions it
inspires, can have economic consequences beyond those of any particular policies that march under its banner.
Uncertainty regarding possible regime changes can also have important economic consequences. In this and the
next installment to my New Deal series, I discuss the bearing of regime change, and regime uncertainty, on the
course of the recovery. As we'll see, although the arrival of the New Deal regime had some beneficial effects
beyond those attributable to any particular policies, the opposite was also true: in its later manifestations especially,
the new regime proved unsettling to businessmen in ways that, according to many, prolonged the depression.Great
ExpectationsThat the New Deal regime change initially had positive consequences has been cogently argued by
Peter Temin and Barry Wigmore[2]. According to them, FDR established a new macroeconomic policy regime
shortly after his inauguration in March 1933. The Hoover administration had been financially conservative, adhering
to the rules of the gold standard and fiscal orthodoxy. Its policy stance in the troubles of the early 1930s therefore,
was decidedly deflationary. Roosevelt broke with this ideology, devaluing the dollar within 6 weeks of his
inauguration, promoting fiscal expansion, and championing the virtues of inflation—reflation as he termed
it.Roosevelt's actions, Temin and Wigmore go on to say, "marked a change in direction for government policies and
for prices in general." Unlike "isolated expansionary actions" that might be understood as "departures from what
was perceived as a long-term government policy," this change only had to be recognized by the public for that
public to alter its expectations rapidly. In his 2008 elaboration on the Temin and Wigmore thesis[3], Gauti
Eggertsson speaks of "an endogenous shift" in the public's expectations brought about by the new administration's
willingness to set aside "policy dogmas." Whether the original New Deal really marked as complete a rejection of
established "policy dogmas" as these authors suggest may well be doubted. For one thing, as I noted previously[4],
FDR campaigned on a commitment to balance the budget, while assailing Hoover for not doing so. He also chose
the extremely orthodox Lewis Douglas[5] as his first budget director. Still the point remains: the benefits of the New
Deal, taken as a whole, could exceed those of the sum of its parts.Regime UncertaintyBut the opposite was also

                                                                                                           Page 2 of 6
                                   The New Deal and Recovery, Part 12: Fear Itself

true. Even if one fully accepts the "great expectations" hypothesis, it doesn't follow that the game-changing done by
the New Deal had no dark side. The new regime's arrival and metamorphosis over the course of the depression
could also hinder recovery. In particular, Bob Higgs argues[6], it bred "pervasive uncertainty among investors about
the security of their property rights in their capital and its prospective returns," and this uncertainty, Higgs says, was
one reason why the depression dragged on. Although "regime uncertainty" is Higgs's term for it, he recognizes that
his hypothesis isn't new. It had more than a few proponents during the depression years themselves, when people
instead spoke of a lack of "business confidence"; and numerous economists and historians have taken it up since.
One of the idea's early proponents was none other than John Maynard Keynes. Upon returning to England after his
desultory, May 1934 visit with FDR[7], Keynes published an "Agenda for the President" in the New York Times and
the London Times. He said in it that he saw "no likelihood that business of its own initiative will invest in durable
goods of sufficient scale for many months to come." Keynes offered several reasons for this pessimism, chief
among which was the fact that "the important but intangible state of mind, which we call business confidence, is
signally lacking." And the reason for that, he said, is to be found in the perplexity and discomfort which the business
world feels from being driven so far from its accustomed moorings into unknown and uncharted waters. The
business man, who may be adaptable and quick on his feet in his own particular field, is usually conservative and
conventional in the larger aspects of social and economic policy. At the start he was carried away, like other people,
by the prevailing enthusiasm. [But now] he is sulky and bothered; andeven begins to look back with longing to the
good old days of 1932.Keynes went on to observe that FDR could help to dispel "this atmosphere of
disappointment, disillusion, and perplexity" by convincing businessmen that "they know the worst." As we'll see,
FDR didn't follow this advice; and some year later, in Capitalism, Socialism, and Democracy (pp. 64-5), Joseph
Schumpeter did not hesitate to blame both "the subnormal recovery" up to 1937 and the slump that followed on the
"general change in the attitude of government to private enterprise" that came with the New Deal. "So extensive
and rapid a change in the social scene," Schumpeter wrote, "naturally affects productive performance for a time,
and so much the most ardent New Dealer must and also can admit. One ex-New Dealer who admitted it publicly
was Raymond Moley[8]. "Confidence," he says in his 1939 memoir, After Seven Years[9], is the existence of that
mutual faith and good will which encourages enterprises to expand and take risks And in an age of increased
governmental interposition in industrial operationsthe maintenance of confidence presupposes both a general
understanding of the direction in which legislative and administrative changes tend and a general belief in
government's sympathetic desire to encourage the development of those investment opportunities whose
successful exploitation is a sine qua non for a rising standard of living. This, Roosevelt refused to recognize (p.
373)."Refused to recognize" is probably not giving FDR his due. He more likely understood that a lack of business
confidence discouraged investment and recovery, but chose to shake that confidence anyway to achieve reforms
he considered essential either for narrowly political reasons, or because he thought they'd yield long-run social
benefits exceeding their short-run costs.Laid LowPractically everyone agrees that inadequate investment held back
the recovery. A glance at the chart below, showing percentage changes in net and gross private investment and
consumption spending since the start of 1929, should suffice to drive home just how little investment there was.
The first thing that's obvious from the chart is that, at just shy of ninety percent, the percentage decline in gross
investment was much greater than the percentage decline in consumption. As a share of GDP, gross domestic
private investment dropped from 16 percent to less than 2 percent. The decline in net investment was even more
severe—so much so that it turned negative and stayed that way until 1935. Although it then turned positive again,
on the eve of the '37 downturn, which saw it go below zero again, it was still 40 percent below its 1929 level. Not
until 1940 would it and the other measures shown in the chart return to their original levels. For the full 1930-1940
period, net private investment added up to minus $3.1 billion. The economy's private job-creating capacity suffered
accordingly. Yet this picture, dire as it is, doesn't tell the full story. That's so because the "investment" shown in it
includes unplanned additions to business inventories, which tend to accompany downturns, and other short-term
investments that aren't so sensitive to perceived regime changes. For a sense of what happened to planned,
longer-term investment during the depression, here's a chart showing the course of gross private investment in all
kinds of residential and business structures: Here the inadequacy of the post-1933 recovery is still more evident
than in the previous chart. Investment in structures, like overall gross private investment, first falls to a tenth of its
level at the start of 1929. But at the end of the decade, after a period of slow recovery that was interrupted by the
'37 crash, it is still less than half its 1929 level. So long as investment failed to recover, recovery writ large could
only go so far, and last so long. "The depletion of capital," Kenneth Roose observes (1954, p. 12), "limited the
number of workers that could be profitably employed." That in turn meant that such gains in consumption spending

                                                                                                             Page 3 of 6
                                   The New Deal and Recovery, Part 12: Fear Itself

as had been achieved lacked what W. L. Crum, R. A. Gordon, and Dorothy Wescott called "sustaining momentum."
"As recovery progressed," they wrote in assessing the 1937 collapse[10], the substitution for stimulated revival of a
more normally balanced expansion, predicated upon long-run undertakings by business leadership in an
environment sufficiently secure from interference to justify assumption of risk, was not facilitated.If the regime
uncertainty hypothesis is right, the trouble wasn't just that the New Deal failed to "facilitate" investment. It was that it
actually discouraged it.Guinea PigsThe New Deal is said to have given businessmen and investors the willies in at
least two ways. First, as its policy innovations multiplied, with no apparent end in sight, and no telling what might
come next, they no longer felt able to plan for the future: a long-run investment that seemed worthwhile so far
might, for all they knew, cease to be so with the next new reform effort. Second, administration officials became
increasingly ill-disposed toward businessmen, and big businessmen especially, to the point where those
businessmen feared deliberate attempts to deprive them of their capital or already thin profits. That the New Deal,
instead of consisting of a coordinated set of previously-conceived policies, would involve trial and error, was
something Roosevelt foresaw and plumped for during his 1932 presidential campaign. "The country needs and,
unless I mistake its temper, the country demands bold, persistent experimentation," he said in his famous
Oglethorpe speech[11] that May. "It is common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit it frankly and try
another. But above all, try something. The millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever while the things
to satisfy their needs are within easy reach." By the fall of 1932, few could have doubted that some experimentation
was called for; and that only became more obvious after the banking system collapsed on the eve of FDR's
inauguration. Nor could anyone expect every policy that was tried to succeed. But while FDR's willingness to
innovate wasn't itself objectionable, instead of following through by assessing his administration's experiments and
discarding ones that failed, he tended, like certain WWI generals, to treat each successful offensive as a gain to be
preserved at all costs, as if it were indeed part of one grand strategy. Consequently, as the depression wore on,
businessmen found themselves overwhelmed by new legislation, much of which involved considerable, if not
sweeping, changes to the rules for doing business, and to their property rights. The following table, reproduced from
Higgs (1997), lists only those "substantially attenuating or threatening" those rights. The year 1935, in particular,
saw such a decisive shift of the Roosevelt administration's emphasis from recovery to reform that it amounted to an
entirely new regime change—the so-called Second New Deal[12]. By means of the "gorge of indigestible
measures" enacted during it, Moley writes, the original New Deal "was completely transformed." "The impact of
these multitudinous measures," Chase National Bank economist Benjamin Anderson wrote[13] a decade later,
"upon a bewildered industrial and financial community was extraordinarily heavy."And Villains1935 also witnessed a
change in the Roosevelt administration's attitude toward businessmen. During his 1932 campaign, Roosevelt spoke
of the need for "cooperation" between the government and business; and his administration's willingness to seek
such cooperation was evident in its early conduct and policies. Even the NIRA, before the introduction of the
blanket code, reflected the administration's desire to rely upon what Moley calls "cooperative business-government
planning," and to reject the alternative of dealing with "private economic power by smashing it to bits." Roosevelt
understood, furthermore, that a lasting recovery depended on the revival of private enterprise. In short, "he had no
quarrel with business, as such. Certainly he did not regard it as an enemy."[1][14] But by the summer of 1935,
FDR's disposition had changed dramatically. Riled by business organizations' increasingly vituperative criticism of
him and the New Deal; angered by the Supreme Court's striking down of the NRA; egged-on by his Progressive
advisors; and determined to win-over supporters of populist presidential candidate Huey Long by stealing a march
on Long's "Share Our Wealth" plan[15], Roosevelt unveiled his own plan for reining-in plutocrats—the notorious
"soak-the-rich" tax proposal.[2][16] FDR made the proposal in a June 19th message to Congress[17], "Our revenue
laws," he announced, "have operated in many ways to the unfair advantage of the few, and they have done little to
prevent an unjust concentration of wealth and economic power." His first target was inherited wealth. Calling such
wealth "inconsistent with the ideals of this generation," he recommended that, besides estate taxes, "an inheritance,
succession, and legacy tax" for "all very large amounts," as well as gift taxes to frustrate attempts to evade it. Next
came high incomes. Because "social unrest and a deepening sense of unfairness are dangers to our national life,"
the Government, he said, had a duty "to restrict such incomes by very high taxes." The final target was big
business. "Vast concentrations of capital," FDR said, "should be ready to carry burdens commensurate with their
powers and their advantages." He therefore recommended "a corporation income tax graduated according to the
size of corporation income," to be supplemented (again as a check against evasion) by a tax on intercorporate
dividends. As if this then-unprecedented proposal might not upset businessmen enough, FDR explained that he
saw it as a half measure only. "Ultimately," he said—foreshadowing legislation to come—he looked forward to both

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 6

"the simplification of our corporate structures through the elimination of unnecessary holding companies" and
policies that would "discourage unwieldy and unnecessary corporate surpluses." Roosevelt's recommendations
came as a complete surprise to Congress: in his January 3rd budget message[18], he'd advised against any new or
additional taxes for the coming fiscal year; and deficits since then had been lower than expected. But if his new
suggestions surprised Congress, they—and his corporate tax proposals in particular—threw the business
community into what Ray Moley called "paroxysms of fright," unnerving it almost as much as the Supreme Court's
striking down of the NRA had cheered it in May. Taxes were, for the first time, being proposed for the avowed
purpose of redistributing wealth rather than raising revenue. The graduated corporate tax, in particular, was
understood to have no purpose save the dubious one of taxing bigness[19]. No good purpose, that is: the
Philadelphia Enquirer considered it "an effective method of hampering re-employment, preventing wage increases
and delaying recovery." Right or wrong, the Enquirer was far from alone. In its report on the Revenue Bill[20], the
Senate Finance Committee recorded the minority opinion that the bill would be better entitled, A bill to confiscate
property; to discourage business and prevent its expansion; to destroy incentive and discriminate against ability,
brain, and ambition, and enterprise; to create inequalities and to obstruct recovery; to jeopardize the financial
position of the government; and for other improper purposes.Despite such protests, the revenue bill sailed through
Congress that August with unseemly haste, aided by Democratic super-majorities in both houses and congressional
leaders' desire to carry out rather than question FDR's wishes. Although higher estate taxes took the place of FDR's
proposed inheritance and gift taxes, most of his other suggestions, including the graduated corporate tax, were
enacted, if only after some watering-down. "It seems," an article in the staid AER opined[21], "that such a measure
is important enough to justify more deliberate and careful consideration than was given." Instead, "all serious
opposition appears to have been bought off with promises or bowled over by the huge Administration majority."
"There can be no denying," the AER article continued, that the President's message was an attack on wealth. Nor
can it be denied that the diverting of taxation from the primary purpose of raising revenue to other major purposes
involves great hazards. That there are tremendous abuses that should be remedied can admit of no question. But
how best eliminate the abuses and yet do a minimum of harm; how best promote ingenuity, enterprise, economy,
social security and all the other desiderata becomes even more difficult with the growing complexities of modern
industrial society.It also becomes more difficult, the authors might have added, in the middle of a depression. ***
FDR's "war" with business didn't end with the August 20th passage of the Revenue Act. Several days later he
signed another law that many businessmen found even more disconcerting. And in 1936 his rhetoric, if not his
administration's legislation, would become still more ferocious. I'll take up the rest of the story of New Deal regime
uncertainty in the next installment to this series. Continue Reading The New Deal and Recovery:Intro[22] Part 1:

The Roosevelt Recession, Continued[34] Part 12: Fear Itself___________________ [1][35] Moley, After Seven
Years, pp. 184 and 300. This isn't to say that every Roosevelt administration official showed compassion, whether
real or simulated, toward businessmen. Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes, for example, spoke contemptuously
of formerly "great and powerful" businessmen, those "boastful, aggressive supermen" who now "came fearfully to
Washington to beg the President to help them save some little from the disaster that by their arrogance and
pridethey had themselves precipitated." (Harold Ickes, The New Democracy, 1934, pp. 26-7). [2][36] In his "secret"
diary entry for November 4th, 1934, Harold Ickes notes that Roosevelt had already convinced by then, presumably
by Felix Frankfurter, that "big business is bent on a deliberate policy of sabotaging the Administration." Frankfurter
had urged FDR to "recognize that there was a war on an act on that assumption," though he added that the
president needn't "declare war verbally." See Michael Parrish, Felix Frankfurter and His Times (1982, p. 244).
Concerning Huey Long: in April 1935, the Democratic National Committee conducted a secret poll (the
questionnaire it sent around purported to have come from the National Inquirer of Washington, DC, though there
was no such paper). The results suggested that, whether he ran himself or merely endorsed the Republican
candidate, Long might divert enough votes from FDR to cost him the presidency, much as Theodore Roosevelt had
cost Taft the presidency in 1912. See Robert Snyder, "Huey Long and the Presidential Election of 1936"

Highlight: President Obama's speech should reassure his fans that when he reaches back to throw the high hard
ones, he's got plenty left.

Body

Last night the President Obama who'd mocked Mitt Romney for not caring about the 47 percent was the same one
who praised his opponent for caring so strongly about the country's future. He thanked not just his own voters but
every voter "whether you held an Obama sign or a Romney sign." He also talked about how eager he was to sit
down with Mr. Romney to talk about how to move the country forward.

This was exactly right. A great victory speech celebrates the end of a successful campaign. But speechwriters know
that it also sets the stage for the beginning of what's next: in this case, the lame duck session and the next
Congress. That means it has the outsize duty of trying to bring together an entire electorate, a large portion of
whom just voted for the other candidate.

Last night's speech didn't live up to Obama's stunning 2008 victory speech, with that long closing story about Ann
Nixon Cooper, the 106-year-old woman whose life encapsulated the history of the 20th century ("a man touched
down on the moon ... she touched her finger to a screen and cast her vote..."). When I teach that speech, students
stop texting and start crying. Part of the effect in '08 was this historical moment, and in part, it was the originality of
that closing story.

But the 2012 modelshowed all the strengths that Obama and his speechwriters consistently exhibit, producing the
best drafts of any president. He used concrete details and repetition ("You'll hear the determination in the voice of a
young field organizer who's working his way through college ... You'll hear the pride in the voice of a volunteer
who's going door to door..."); antithesis and echoes of John F. Kennedy ("America's never been about what can be
done for us; it's about what can be done by us together") and stories that have the ring of truth ("And I saw it just
the other day in Mentor, Ohio, where a father told the story of his 8-year-old daughter..."). You also see flashes of
wit ("one dog's probably enough"), and the skillful use of pause, emphasis and variety of tone that makes public
speaking teachers like me use him as a model for students.

The speech also should help disprove the ridiculous criticism that Obama's speeches fail to provide a narrative.
Obama has had a consistent and obvious narrative since 2004. In fact, you can boil it down just like a screenwriter
would pitch, say, the movie "Splash" ("A man searching for true love finally finds it when a mermaid finds him!").

In other words, "A country rises from despair by abandoning what hasn't worked for what does: finding common
ground!"

                                                                                                            Page 2 of 3
                                                    Victory Speeches

Or, even better, as Obama put it for the umpteenth time last night:

... the spirit that has lifted this country from the depths of despair to the great heights of hope, the belief that while
each of us will pursue our own individual dreams, we are an American family, and we rise or fall together as one
nation and as one people.

Naturally, whether President Obama can bring people together will be determined by more than a speech. Like
tennis, it depends on players across the net. For the last four years, Republicans thought they could win with
another game. Will Republicans, chastened by defeat, now change? It's possible, and Obama's call to find common
ground may just offer moderate Republicans the key to winning the 2016 election.

In the last two years especially, many people have attacked Obama's speeches, wondering why they didn't have
the same effect as the ones four years ago when he was campaigning. Was he too cerebral? Did he lose his
magic?

There are simpler answers. People get tired of songs they loved after the first 50 times they hear them. And there's
a difference between running for president and being one; we hear only the candidates' biggest hits. With YouTube
we can see every one of the president's roughly 500 speeches a year, including the strikeouts.

It's the actions - the health care and immigration reform, Supreme Court appointments and the protection of rights -
that will determine whether Obama succeeds or fails. But his victory speech should reassure his fans. When
Obama reaches back to throw the high hard ones, he's got plenty left.

In my last piece, "The Political Speechwriter's Life," several people posted          comments similar to jr:

I just can't buy into this idea that its ok to write speeches for someone else, so they can take credit for your writing.

To me, letting someone else take credit for your work is participating in a lie. It is facilitating and enabling a fraud on
the public. It is inherently deceptive.

I have heard this complaint many times before. Kate, another commenter,offers some thoughts.

A good speechwriter is a partner, not a puppet master. The speechwriter listens, carefully and often, and then
expands and shapes all the pieces that are, for the most part, already there. The speechwriter is influencing how
the ideas are presented and perceived, but cannot be credited with their conception. Don't underestimate the role of
the speaker in crafting his own message, whether he puts the pen to paper or not.

I absolutely agree with Kate. There are plenty of ways writers explore their bosses' views beyond face-to-face
meetings. Lots of speechwriters write drafts without ever talking to their bosses. That doesn't mean we make things
up. We talk to staffers who know the issues best. We have position papers and old speeches, and we remember
past conferences. And we know our bosses, and are constantly scribbling notes when we are in meetings.

When I worked in the White House for Al Gore, there were plenty of times I would finish something at midnight, put
it in his briefing book and see him looking at it for the first time as he got into the motorcade. However, no one was
confused about whose policy was in the draft. It was his.

There was a time, however, when politicians didn't acknowledge their speechwriters. In 1933, Franklin Delano
Roosevelt reviewed his first inaugural speech with Raymond Moley, who wrote the draft. When they were done,
Roosevelt said that he would just copy the draft by hand so nobody would know Mr. Moley wrote it.

Moley threw his copy into the fireplace and said, "This is your speech now."

In fairness to Roosevelt, our source for this story is Mr. Moley, who years later saw the handwritten draft in the
Roosevelt museum. The display contained a typed note from the president explaining that he had written the
speech. Mr. Moley was so incensed he spilled the beans in his memoir.

                                                                                                       Page 3 of 3
                                                 Victory Speeches

Politicians today certainly acknowledge their speechwriters; Jon Favreau, Obama's writer, gets a lot of publicity.
And Obama values him because he is so good at conveying the president's positions: Obama has even called Mr.
Favreauhis mind reader.

Besides, Obama gives hundreds of speeches each year, and writing them is a full-time job. Do you really want
politicians spending all day frantically trying to write?

I'd rather they had some time to think.

Robert Lehrman, who was the chief speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore, is the author of four novels and "The
Political Speechwriter's Companion" and teaches speechwriting at American University.

George Selgin[1]
(The first of an essay in 3 installments.)
In The Money Makers[2], his 2015 book on the New Deal and its aftermath, Eric Rauchway says that FDR
"conducted an active monetary and fiscal program of recoveryworking along lines suggested by Keynes." His
book's subtitle in turn declares that between them, "Roosevelt and Keynes ended the Depression." Other popular
accounts likewise declare that "[t]he beliefs of Keynes and FDR proved successful at alleviating the Great
Depression[3]" and even that[4] "Without John Maynard Keynes, FDR's New Deal may never have happened."

In this series, in contrast, I've argued that, instead of ending the Great Depression, the New Deal did relatively little
to counter it, and, in some ways prolonged it. Readers who share the popular understanding of Keynes's influence
upon New Deal policies will therefore conclude that I also consider Keynesian economics a failure. But they'd be
wrong, for a very simple reason: despite what one reads everywhere, the New Deal was not particularly
"Keynesian," and was in some ways quite un-Keynesian.
According to Rexford Tugwell[5] (1957, p. 290), the Columbia economics professor who was a member of FDR's
original Brain Trust, "the Keynesian myth" (as he styles it) first became fashionable in the later 1930s, as the
General Theory began to sweep the board of macroeconomic thought. It was later reinforced by Roy Harrod's Life
of Keynes[6] (1951)—though Harrod admitted, in a 1950 letter to Dennis Robertson, that he'd deliberately
exaggerated Keynes's influence on Roosevelt's policies because 'in the mind of the general public you have to have
One Man. There isn't room for more.' Rauchway's more recent effort appears to reflect a similar awareness of
popular psychology.
Tugwell dismisses the claim that Keynes influenced FDR's thinking, or that Keynes otherwise played an important
part in shaping New Deal policies. Another New Dealer, Leon Keyserling[7], who served as an attorney for the AAA,
and helped draft some other major New Deal legislation, does as well, though in starker terms: "With all due respect
to Keynes," he wrote in 1972[8], "I have been unable to discover much reasonable evidence that the New Deal
would have been greatly different if he had never lived, and if a so-called school of economics had not taken on his
name."
That Keynes the man played hardly any part shaping those New Deal policies that came retrospectively to be
described as "Keynesian" is only part of the truth. It's also true that, had Keynes's advice, or that of many American
economists who independently favored those policies, actually been taken, the Great Depression would have taken
a far different, and less destructive, course.
Brains and Keynes

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 8
                             The New Deal and Recovery, Part 15: The Keynesian Myth

Any account of Keynes's role in shaping New Deal policies should begin with an appreciation of two facts. The first
is that, despite his stature in Great Britain, Keynes was not well known in the United States until after he published
the General Theory in 1936. The second is that, far from feeling any need to seek advice from a British economist,
FDR came to office accompanied by a corps of advisors unmatched by any other in the history of the U.S.
presidency.
Historians of the New Deal have found it convenient, if perhaps never entirely accurate, to divide FDR's many
advisors into various factions. All agree that the most important of these were the "planners," led by Tugwell, and
the "trust-busters," led by Harvard law professor Felix Frankfurter[9]. As the name suggests, the trust-busters' ideal
was something like economists' notion of "perfect competition," which they hoped to more closely approximate by
breaking-up large corporations and banks. The planners, in contrast, had nothing against large-scale enterprises: to
their way of thinking, competition was more dangerous than desirable, and the trust-busters were hopelessly out of
touch. Rather than try to do away with big business, the planners merely wanted to transfer control of it from
businessmen to bureaucrats like themselves, who would manage it rationally, in the public interest, instead of just
trying to make a buck.
As diametrically opposed as their ideals were in many respects, these factions had at least one important belief in
common: both treated the Great Depression "less as a problem to be solved than as an opportunity to be exploited
for radical surgery on U.S. business and finance" (Best 1991, p. 11[10]). Nor was it obvious how either of their
programs, which predated the depression, would help end it. The generally-held verdict, that these reforms "never
contributed much to economic recovery" (Hawley 1966, p. 15[11]), should therefore not come as a surprise. Nor
should it be necessary to add that such reforms bore only an incidental relation to policies aimed at enhancing
aggregate spending that later came to be identified with "Keynesian" economics. The simple truth is that, when it
came to fiscal and monetary policy, most of FDR's closest advisors, including members of the original Brain Trust,
simply weren't "Keynesians," even in a loose sense.
This isn't to say that FDR received no "Keynesian" advice. Besides the trust-busters and planners, a third group of
advice-givers—the "inflationists"—also influenced his thinking. This group's most influential members, neither of
whom was a genuine New Dealer, were Irving Fisher[12] and Cornell agricultural economist George Warren[13],
the latter of whom gained an important ally in Henry Morgenthau, FDR's second Treasury Secretary. Though they
were fiscal conservatives, Fisher, Warren and Morgenthau favored suspending the gold standard and otherwise
trying to raise prices by means of what may loosely be called "monetary" policy. Expansionary fiscal policy, and
particularly large-scale spending on public works, had their own New Deal proponents in Frances Perkins, Harold
Ickes, Harry Hopkins, and Marriner Eccles. But calling the policies these New Dealers favored "Keynesian" is one
thing; claiming that their advocates were actually influenced by Keynes is quite another. In fact, there's no evidence
that any of them came to think as they did because of Keynes.
Until The General Theory made its big splash in 1936, Keynes's own arguments appear to have impressed only
one of FDR's close advisors: trust-buster Felix Kaufman. In the fall of 1933, Kaufmann went on sabbatical to
England where, in early December, after visiting Keynes at Cambridge, he encouraged him to write the open letter
published in the New York Times later that year. Keynes gave Kaufmann an advance copy, which Kaufman sent to
Roosevelt on the 12th (Edwards 2018, pp. 1-2[14]). If Tugwell[15] (1957, p. 404) is right in saying that FDR
"neverread anything Keynes wrote, except perhaps some newspaper pieces commenting on his [Roosevelt's] own
actions," that letter would have been one of Roosevelt's first helpings of Keynes's own advice. But the letter didn't
impress him. "You can tell the Professor," Roosevelt told Frankfurter in reply, "that in regard to public works we
shall spend in the next fiscal year nearly twice the amount we are spending in this fiscal year, but there is a practical
limit to what the Government can borrow." From that terse reply and other evidence, William Barber (1996, p.
83)[16] concludes that Keynes's pleas "had little impact on Roosevelt's thinking."
Nor were the two men's minds ever to really meet. Their disharmony was especially evident when, in May 1934, the
men themselves met for the first and only time. To judge by the impressions each shared with Frances Perkins after
their one-hour meeting, that event, which Kaufman hoped would establish a rapport between them, was
unsuccessful. 'I saw your friend Keynes,' Roosevelt said. 'He left a whole rigmarole of figures. He must be a
mathematician rather than a political economist.' Keynes, for his part, told Perkins that, though he admired the
President very much, he expected him to be 'more literate, economically speaking.' According to Arthur
Schlesinger[17] (1960, p. 406), Keynes later told Alvin Johnson, the New School's director who was himself an
economist, "I don't think your President Roosevelt knows anything about economics." However much the men may

                                                                                                        Page 3 of 8

have respected one another, so far as economic policy was concerned, each might have spoken a foreign language
that the other couldn't understand.
The Wrong R's
As Tugwell (1970, p. 103[18]) points out, FDR's "less than enthusiastic" response to Keynes's advice was due, not
to his being unpersuaded by it, but to his belief that Keynes was merely telling him "to do what he had already been
doing for some time.' But was he?
Keynes himself certainly didn't think so. One purpose of his open letter[19] was to encourage FDR to spend more—
much more—on public works, and to finance that spending by borrowing more instead of raising taxes. As we'll see,
Keynes was quite right to think that FDR needed such encouragement. But that wasn't all: Keynes also disapproved
of much that FDR had "already been doing." Among other things, Keynes questioned FDR's priorities, wondered
whether he was quite sure what he was doing, and called some of the advice he was taking "crack-brained and
queer."
Regarding priorities, Keynes believed that of Roosevelt's had two of his "three R's"—Reform, Relief, and
Recovery—out of order. Instead of making Recovery his administration's first priority, Keynes told the president, he
was "engaged on a double task, Recovery and Reform," whereas he ought to defer reform until recovery was
achieved. Keynes was especially critical of the National Recovery Administration (NRA), a brainchild of the
"planners," describing it, accurately[20], as a reform that masqueraded as part of a plan for recovery while actually
impeding it. He called some of the advice FDR was taking "foolish," while comparing the gyrations in gold's price
that those policies were abetting to 'a gold standard on the booze.' In short, while Keynes applauded FDR's
willingness to reject orthodox policies in favor of "bold experimentation," he believed he'd chosen the wrong
experiments, while clinging to some of the most obstructive orthodoxies.[1][21]
Nor was Keynes less critical when, not long after meeting FDR in 1934, he once again shared his thoughts with The
New York Times, this time in the shape of some brief "notes" on the New Deal[22]. Here Keynes again took aim at
the NRA, objecting to its "excessive complexity and regimentation," and especially to its "impractical and
unnecessary" attempts to regulate prices. He noted as well the lack of business confidence, "for some of which the
administration may be to blame." (And how![23]) And he complained that, despite a temporary boost, the
government was still not spending, or not deficit-spending, enough. Keynes repeated many of these complaints,
more trenchantly, in a February 1, 1938 letter to the President[24].
Even such a cursory review of Keynes's public and private remarks on the New Deal should suffice to call into
question Eric Rauchway's claim[25] that he 'staunchly defended the New Deal through 1933, and continued to do
so into 1934.' Keynes admired Roosevelt's boldness. He particularly applauded his decision to abandon the gold
standard. He also approved of some of the reforms his administration was pursuing as long-term reforms. But in
1933 and 1934, Keynes's verdict on the New Deal as a program for recovery was, on the whole, negative. And he
made no bones about it.
Anchors Aweigh
Of all the steps Roosevelt took during his first year in office, none pleased Keynes more than his decision to
abandon the gold standard. But much as Keynes, who had famously condemned the gold standard as a "barbarous
relic" in his 1923 Tract on Monetary Reform[26], welcomed that decision, he had nothing to do with it.
That the gold standard might eventually have to go was a possibility FDR recognized as early as October 1932,
when he wisely chose not to mention the topic in his campaign speeches. "I do not want to be committed to the gold
standard," he privately explained to his aides at the time. "I haven't the faintest idea whether we will be on the gold
standard on March 4th or not; nobody can foresee where we shall be."
On the eve of the inauguration, FDR and his advisors still hadn't given up on the gold standard. According to
Sebastian Edwards (2017, p. 3)[27], although they considered "tinkering with the currency," they viewed doing so
as "an option with a rather low priority." Events, more than economic doctrine, were to ultimately seal the gold
standard's fate: the banking crisis[28], which had been triggered by a run on the dollar[29], compelled Roosevelt to
restrict both gold exports and domestic ownership of gold, while gold's subsequent appreciation, which FDR would
eventually encourage through his gold purchase program, put paid to any prospect of a restoration of the dollar's
former gold value.
Had FDR wished to permanently devalue the dollar all along, he didn't need to turn to any British economist to gain
an expert's approval of that decision. Days before the inauguration, Irving Fisher, who was then, according to
Joseph Schumpeter, the United States' "greatest scientific economist," urged FDR to begin his presidency by
announcing that the United States was abandoning the gold standard in favor of a "managed currency." That step,

                                                                                                         Page 4 of 8
                             The New Deal and Recovery, Part 15: The Keynesian Myth

Fisher maintained, "would reverse the present deflation overnight and would set us on a path toward new peaks of
prosperity" (Barber[30] 1996, p. 25). But FDR wasn't yet prepared to go that far. Instead, he settled for his March
6th Bank Holiday proclamation[31] suspending both gold exports and internal gold payments—steps that could
hardly be avoided since gold withdrawals were about to exhaust the New York Fed's reserves. Subsequent
Executive Orders extended and reinforced these prohibitions[32] until, on April 20th, FDR issued a proclamation
formally suspending the gold standard.
FDR's next, major step away from the gold standard consisted of his "bombshell" cable of July 3rd, 1933, effectively
withdrawing his support for the currency stabilization goals of the World Economic Conference[33] then being held
in London. The other participating nations hoped the United States would cooperate with them to restore the
international gold standard, with the system of fixed exchange rates that went hand-in-hand with it, by agreeing to
stabilize the then free-floating gold value of the dollar. Though it was understood by then that the dollar would be
devalued, the thought was that, by working together, the assembled delegates could avoid "competitive"
devaluations that might delay the gold standard's revival, if not prevent it altogether. The United States' withdrawal
left FDR free to devalue the dollar as much as he liked, or to let it keep floating forever.
Keynes's role in FDR's decision to not support the conference's currency stabilization agenda has been
exaggerated. He approved of the bold steps Roosevelt took during the Bank Holiday, and his decision to officially
let the dollar float that April. He also understood that Roosevelt was prepared to permanently devalue the dollar if
that would help to raise the U.S. price level. Keynes believed that FDR's willingness to devalue the dollar made his
cooperation crucial to any successful, international stabilization plan. '[T]here is one man in the world," Keynes
wrote in the Daily Mail that June, who seems to take seriously the business in hand to which others do not more
than pay lip service, namely, President Roosevelt, [yet] we are all talking as though that man is defeating the
alleged objects of the conference" (Rauchway[34] 2015, p. 70). But it doesn't follow that it was Keynes who
convinced FDR to torpedo the conference.

As far as I'm aware, the only evidence for that claim consists of Raymond Moley's[35] (1939, p. 236) statement
that FDR's thinking had been "greatly influenced" by Keynes's 1930 Treatise on Money. But that statement, which
Rauchway (2015, p. 51) takes at face value, simply isn't credible. For one thing, Moley contradicts himself, saying
elsewhere (1939, p. 225n20; my emphasis) that FDR's views "seemed to approximate those" found in the Treatise,
which means something altogether different. It's also highly unlikely that FDR, who had little patience for abstract
thought, and who Tugwell says hardly read anything by Keynes, either had or took the time to read Keynes's
longest and most abstruse work!

But the most important reason for doubting Moley's claim is simply that there's nothing in the Treatise that could
possibly have inspired FDR's July 1933 decision. Although it's true that, in his Tract on Monetary Reform, Keynes's
disparaged attempts to restore the then dismantled gold standard, by 1930 "the facts had changed,"[36] and so had
Keynes's thinking. "Today," Keynes wrote in the Treatise''s second volume[37] (1930, p. 338),
the reasons seem strongerto accept, substantially, the fait accompli of an international standard . For to seek the
ultimate good via an autonomous national system would mean not only a frontal attack on the forces of
conservatism, but it would [sic] divide the forces of intelligence and goodwill and separate the interests of nations.
Such words could hardly have inspired FDR to "torpedo" the London conference! Nor are there any other passages
in the Treatise that might have done so.
Instead, the experts whose views almost certainly informed FDR's decisions were Fisher and, above all, Warren.
Although Fisher, like Keynes, was never one of FDR's official advisors, unlike Keynes he corresponded with FDR
often[38], and met with him on numerous occasions, throughout the New Deal. Between late February and early
June 1933 alone Fisher sent Roosevelt no fewer than seven letters, all addressing the currency question. In a
March 2 letter, he wrote that 'The present situation in currency cries to heaven for reflation (up to a reasonable price
level about half way back) and, after such reflation, for stabilization' (my emphasis).[2][39] According to Barber
(1996, p. 33), just before the London conference began, Fisher wrote again, advising FDR that the U.S. "should not
wait for action by other countries, nor make our action dependent on theirs, nor tie up our standard to theirs
irrevocably." The cable's endorsement of "efforts to plan national currencies with the objective of giving those
currencies a continuing purchasing power which does not vary in terms of commodities" might have been written by
Fisher himself, who long favored the idea.

                                                                                                        Page 5 of 8
                             The New Deal and Recovery, Part 15: The Keynesian Myth

Warren also urged Roosevelt not to commit to any definite plan to stabilize the dollar. Ever since Roosevelt took
office, Warren had been trying to win him over his theory that, as the price of gold rose, so would other commodity
prices. After Roosevelt let the dollar float, commodity prices started to rise rapidly, while gold depreciated, in
apparent confirmation of the theory. Then, when it seemed that the United States was going to please Britain by
stabilizing the dollar, gold depreciated, and prices fell. Between them, these events and Warren's advice played an
important role in convincing FDR to resist getting "trapped" (Warren's term) by any proposal to stabilize the dollar's
gold value while commodity prices were still well below their pre-depression levels. The Committee for the Nation, a
lobbying group (a sympathetic source[40], on which this paragraph draws, describes it as a group of bankrupt
farmers, businessmen, bankers, and cooperative leaders) to which both Fisher and Warren belonged, joined them
in advising Roosevelt against tying the United State's hands.
In short, U.S. experts appear to have done all the persuading necessary to get Roosevelt to fire off his July 3rd
cable. Keynes's welcome but minor contribution consisted solely of the support he gave to FDR after the fact, by
publishing an article in the Daily Mail declaring him, by its title, "Magnificently Right."
Sober Advice
While Roosevelt's withdrawal from the London conference left little doubt that the old gold dollar was history, it
offered no clue as to where its gold value would settle, or even whether it would settle anywhere, rather than
continuing to float. Nor does Roosevelt himself seem to have known yet. Instead, he sought further advice. But
once again he turned for it to U.S. experts, not to Keynes. Some advice came from Fisher and from one of Fisher's
many students, Yale economist James Harvey Rogers[41]. But it was George Warren's thinking that ultimately
prevailed—and Warren was certainly the least Keynesian of the bunch.
Warren's theory, which he and Frank Pearson[42] developed on the basis of mere extrapolation from the past,
posited a more-or-less mechanical link connecting the dollar price of gold to the price of agricultural and other
commodities. According to it, a sufficient devaluation of the dollar, however achieved, was sure to deliver on FDR's
promise to restore the prices of farm products to their 1926 level. Warren's theory thus inspired FDR's ill-fated gold
buying spree.
But apart from convincing FDR himself, Warren's theory won few converts either in or outside of the Roosevelt
administration. Henry Morgenthau bought it. "Foolish" and "nonsense" were the brusque opinions of James
Warburg and Rex Tugwell, respectively; and their view seems to have been closer to the general consensus among
economists. (Even Fisher, whose views superficially resembled Warren's, insisted that raising gold's price alone
wouldn't raise other prices: monetary expansion was needed to get people to spend more.) By February 1934,
when FDR and Morgenthau quit buying gold, and fixed the dollar's official gold content at 59 percent of its former
level, these critics had every reason to feel vindicated, if not to gloat: the wholesale price index was only three
percent higher than it had been at the start of the gold buying program in October 1933.[3][43]
Whether he gloated or not, Keynes was among Warren's most unsparing critics. In his December 1933 open letter,
it was Warren's theory that he considered 'crack brained," observing that it rested on a "set of fallacies." Instead of
supposing that gold's appreciation would cause higher prices, Keynes told FDR, he ought to have gotten both gold's
price and those of other commodities up by other means, and then devalued the dollar accordingly. Because the
gold purchase program put the gold depreciation cart before the price-raising horses of expansionary monetary and
fiscal policy, its main result consisted, not of higher equilibrium prices, but of those disturbing "gyrations of the
dollar" that seemed to Keynes "more like a gold standard on the booze than the ideal managed currency of my
dreams."
In view of Keynes's harsh remarks, it seems a real stretch to suggest, as Eric Rauchway (2014, p. 58[44]) does,
that "[i]n the general outline of his beliefs, Warren had support from John Maynard Keynes." In truth, it was
Warren's opinions rather than Keynes's that Roosevelt heeded. But as Roy Harrod understood, once one discerns
that, in the mind of the general public, "you have to have One Man," a little truth-stretching is hard to resist.

                              The New Deal and Recovery, Part 15: The Keynesian Myth

__________________________ [1][61] Keynes's rejection of much of the thinking behind the NRA and AAA
predated the New Deal. In "The Raising of Prices," one of several letters he published in the London Times and The
New Statesman in March 1933 (republished in the U.S. as The Means to Prosperity[62]), Keynes called "the idea of
raising prices of commodities by restricting their supply," with which Neville Chamberlain, then England's Chancellor
of the Exchequer, had then been flirting, "worse than useless." Instead of serving to diminish employment, he said,
"it is, rather, a method of distributing more evenly what employment there is, at the cost of somewhat increasing it."
According to Elliot Rosen[63] (2005, p. 80), FDR's longtime friend Viscount Astor[64] sent advance copies of
Keynes's letters to the White House. Of FDR's reaction to these, assuming he read them, there's no record. In any
event, one doubts that Keynes would have been impressed by Raymond Moley's claim that in criticizing the NRA
he "missed" the fact that it was not primarily concerned with increasing production, but with spreading work."
[2][65] In his discussion of the failure of the London conference in Stable Money: A History of the Movement (1934,
pp. 351-2)[66], Fisher attributes it to the irreconcilable difference between the desire of delegates from several
countries, including France and England, to see their currencies' exchange rates with the U.S. dollar stabilized
before taking steps to raise their national price levels, and Roosevelt's desire to reflate the U.S. price level before
entering into any agreements to stabilize the exchanges. Roosevelt's preference was, of course, the position Fisher
had himself urged him to take prior to the conference.
[3][67] Despite its apparent failure in the 30s, and the many economists who disparaged it then and since, Warren's
theory still has its adherents, including Scott Sumner[68], who (besides defending Warren) offers a nice summary of
the difference between his and Fisher's thinking. Sumner himself draws on Sebastian Edward's fine account of
FDR's gold policy, and the economists who influenced it, in American Default[69].
