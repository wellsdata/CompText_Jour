Before moving down from New York to launch his first term in the White House, Franklin D. Roosevelt sent an
advance team headed by Raymond Moley - a 46-year-old Columbia University professor and leader of Roosevelt's
Brain Trust - who was more or less making his debut in public life. Within weeks, as Roosevelt's closest and most
influential adviser, Ray Moley became known as "the second strongest man in Washington." As ti developed,
Moley's turn in the Washington spotlight was brief, but he went on to a distinguished career in political commentary.
At 88, and despite a recent heart attack, Moley was still busy with his memoirs and other writings when he died last
week in Phoenix, Ariz.

The term New Deal was credited to Moley. He set up shop for the Roosevelt Administration, hiring aides, making
and screening Cabinet selections, twisting Congressional arms and swinging so much weight before and during the
famous hundred days that one of FDR's old-friends was said to have approached the President-elect shortly before
the inauguration and begged: "Franklin, can you do me one favor? Can you get me an appointment with Moley?"

Soon, however, in his nominal title of Assistant Secretary of State, Moley butted heads with Cordell Hull, the proud
and touchy Secretary of State. In addition, Moley was a fundamental conservative who began to find Roosevelt's
policies alarmingly radical. Moley resigned in September 1933; despite a widening rift, he continued to serve the
President as a consultant until 1936, but them Morley boted the Democratic Party and he and FDR never met
again.

Moley taught school in his native Ohio and remained on the Columbia faculty in his Brain Trust days and for many
years afterward, but journalism took up more and more of his time. In 1934, he became editor and columnist at
Today, a current-events weekly. Three years later, when Today and Newsweek merged, Moley began a long
association with Newsweek, briefly as editor and for 30 years as a columnist until his retirement from the
newsweekly gind at 81 - though he went on writing books, chiefly on politics and political history. Moley's prose
was direct and often critical but devoid of nasty twists. "We can hurt beyond repair by unfairness," he once said.
"We should first be fair. Then, if there is something to spare, we may be clever." He also believed in getting to the
point: "If I were th umpire, I would call a balk on some of our writers for delaying the game."

In 1970, Moley returned to the White House to receive the Medal of Freedom - the highest civilian honor that the
U.S. awards. "A man of thought and a man of action," said the accompanying citation, "he has not only studied and
analyzed the history of our times, but also helped to make it."
