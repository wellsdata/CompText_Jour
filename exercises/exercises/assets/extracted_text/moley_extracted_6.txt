The First Church of Christ, Congregational in New London, Conn., was the setting yesterday for the marriage of
Kelle Kay Harbert and Dr. Jeffrey Fletcher Moley. The Rev. Robert C. Hamm performed the ceremony.

Jennifer Ruth Harbert was maid of honor for her sister. Roger Walton Moley was his brother's best man.

Mrs. Moley is a daughter of Dr. and Mrs. Charles Armon Harbert of Waterford, Conn. Her father, a chemist, is
executive director of medicinal chemistry for Pfizer Inc. in Groton, Conn. The bridegroom is a son of Dr. and Mrs.
Malcolm Moley of New York and Quogue, L.I. His father is a surgeon at the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.

The bride, who expects to receive an M.D. degree from the Yale University School of Medicine next June,
graduated magna cum laude from Wellesley College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.

Her husband, who is chief resident in general surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital, graduated from the Hill School
and magna cum laude from Harvard College, and received an M.D. degree in 1980 from the Columbia University
College of Physicians and Surgeons. The bridegroom is a grandson of the late Raymond Moley, who, as an
adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, coined the term ''New Deal'' and was a leader of the original brain trust.
He later served as an assistant Secretary of State.
