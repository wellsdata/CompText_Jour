Texas A&M researchers are using AI to improve the management of disasters like hurricanes before, during and
after the events.

***

By Justin Agan

Hurricane season is here, with Hurricane Beryl already leaving a trail of damage after hitting Texas' shorelines. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting a record number of named storms in the
Atlantic this year. As these events continue to increase, it's imperative to find solutions to help manage the
inevitable hazards.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, associate professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Texas
A&M University, and his research team have been utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to address disaster
management through each phase of a hazard event. They want to bring cutting-edge AI to the forefront of
community resilience and disaster management efforts.

AI has become a very popular evolving technology, especially in research. When given large amounts of data,
images or text, it can identify and analyze key features much quicker than a whole team of people.

Mitigation and Preparedness

A crucial step of the mitigation phase of disaster management is assessing risk to communities. Hurricanes bring
significant flooding risks, but current flood risk assessments can be time-intensive and costly.

Mostafavi's team developed a machine-learning model called Flood Genome that determines flood risk in different
communities based on factors like hydrological, topographic and built environment features. Just like genetic

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3
                                    AI For All Phases of Disaster Management

features can indicate health risks for people, Flood Genome analyzes different features of communities to assign
flood risk levels.

"We used historical flood damages from the National Flood Insurance Program to test this model to determine how
well it can predict high-risk areas, and the model performed beautifully," Mostafavi said. "It can inform flood
mitigation and community resilience efforts by understanding the flood risk level of different areas."

Another AI tool developed by the Mostafavi lab, called Elev-vision, determines the lowest floor elevation of
structures using Google Street View images.

For a city like Houston, with hundreds of thousands of properties, surveying each property with traditional methods
is not feasible. This new tool significantly cuts labor and expenses and provides updated vital information on flood
risk to properties.

Response and Recovery

Response efforts would ideally start before an event develops, but the fast-paced nature of a hurricane makes
evacuations and supply distribution difficult to manage. The research team has developed solutions to this problem
as well.

"We leverage location-based data and graph analytic methods to determine the preparedness and evacuation
patterns of communities before a hurricane or storm arrives and provide that in near-real-time to decision-makers to
understand what areas have or have not evacuated," Mostafavi said.

He added that not only can this new technology tell which areas have evacuated, but it also monitors which routes
and destinations are being used the most. Getting accurate and timely evacuation information to decision-makers
would greatly improve public safety before and during disasters.

This tool can also determine a community's preparedness before a storm arrives. By analyzing patterns of human
mobility and visitations to grocery stores, it can gauge how prepared a community is to weather the storm.

Quick response efforts can also impact recovery after events.

Rapid damage assessments in the wake of disasters are vital to making more resilient communities. This can lead
to faster local and federal aid. The team's AI research tackles this issue by using satellite images and computer
vision techniques to classify properties based on the extent of damage.

Many of the models and tools Mostafavi's team developed were tested during or after previous events like
hurricanes in Florida and Louisiana, and all performed very well.

"AI technologies can improve resilience capabilities of communities at different stages," Mostafavi said. "We see AI
as the next defense barrier against disasters because it improves risk mapping, situational awareness and impact
assessment."

There may not be a long wait for these improvements since the team has already begun a start-up company and
developed prototypes to commercialize these technologies for public use.

Mostafavi and his team have been working extensively on AI disaster management for many years, resulting in
numerous publications and innovations.

Texas AandM researchers are using AI to improve the management of disasters like hurricanes before, during and
after the events.

By Justin Agan, Texas AandM University Engineering July 19, 2024

Hurricane season is here, with Hurricane Beryl already leaving a trail of damage after hitting Texas' shorelines. The
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting a record number of named storms in the
Atlantic this year. As these events continue to increase, it's imperative to find solutions to help manage the
inevitable hazards.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, associate professor in the Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Texas
AandM University, and his research team have been utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) to address disaster
management through each phase of a hazard event. They want to bring cutting-edge AI to the forefront of
community resilience and disaster management efforts.

AI has become a very popular evolving technology, especially in research. When given large amounts of data,
images or text, it can identify and analyze key features much quicker than a whole team of people.

Mitigation and Preparedness

A crucial step of the mitigation phase of disaster management is assessing risk to communities. Hurricanes bring
significant flooding risks, but current flood risk assessments can be time-intensive and costly.

Mostafavi's team developed a machine-learning model called Flood Genome that determines flood risk in different
communities based on factors like hydrological, topographic and built environment features. Just like genetic
features can indicate health risks for people, Flood Genome analyzes different features of communities to assign
flood risk levels.

"We used historical flood damages from the National Flood Insurance Program to test this model to determine how
well it can predict high-risk areas, and the model performed beautifully," Mostafavi said. "It can inform flood
mitigation and community resilience efforts by understanding the flood risk level of different areas."

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3
                              AI FOR ALL PHASES OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT

Another AI tool developed by the Mostafavi lab, called Elev-vision, determines the lowest floor elevation of
structures using Google Street View images.

For a city like Houston, with hundreds of thousands of properties, surveying each property with traditional methods
is not feasible. This new tool significantly cuts labor and expenses and provides updated vital information on flood
risk to properties.

Response and Recovery

Response efforts would ideally start before an event develops, but the fast-paced nature of a hurricane makes
evacuations and supply distribution difficult to manage. The research team has developed solutions to this problem
as well.

"We leverage location-based data and graph analytic methods to determine the preparedness and evacuation
patterns of communities before a hurricane or storm arrives and provide that in near-real-time to decision-makers to
understand what areas have or have not evacuated," Mostafavi said.

He added that not only can this new technology tell which areas have evacuated, but it also monitors which routes
and destinations are being used the most. Getting accurate and timely evacuation information to decision-makers
would greatly improve public safety before and during disasters.

This tool can also determine a community's preparedness before a storm arrives. By analyzing patterns of human
mobility and visitations to grocery stores, it can gauge how prepared a community is to weather the storm.

Quick response efforts can also impact recovery after events.

Rapid damage assessments in the wake of disasters are vital to making more resilient communities. This can lead
to faster local and federal aid. The team's AI research tackles this issue by using satellite images and computer
vision techniques to classify properties based on the extent of damage.

Many of the models and tools Mostafavi's team developed were tested during or after previous events like
hurricanes in Florida and Louisiana, and all performed very well.

"AI technologies can improve resilience capabilities of communities at different stages," Mostafavi said. "We see AI
as the next defense barrier against disasters because it improves risk mapping, situational awareness and impact
assessment."

There may not be a long wait for these improvements since the team has already begun a start-up company and
developed prototypes to commercialize these technologies for public use.

Mostafavi and his team have been working extensively on AI disaster management for many years, resulting in
numerous publications and innovations.

The following information was released by the U.S. Army-Asia Pacific:

By Master Sgt. Erich Smith, National Guard BureauApril 8, 2024

ARLINGTON, Va. Inside the bustling confines of an operations center, National Guard members quickly assemble
information from multiple sources, piecing together the "big picture" from ground and air personnel as they fight a
devastating wildfire threatening lives and property.

As the day progresses, their report meant to be a timely representation of the situation makes its way up the ladder,
subjected to revisions and interpretations at every level.

By the time the information reaches key decision makers, however, the realities on the ground have long since
evolved: homes destroyed, wildlife scattered, vegetation wasted, and most importantly, lives lost a devastating
situation exacerbated by delays in communication.

For Michael Wisniewski, chief data officer with the Army National Guard's communications and computers
directorate, such a scenario should never become a reality in the fast-paced world of natural disaster response.

"Back in the day, we'd fly over a fire or disaster site, then come back, look at a map, make some marks on it, and
then go out again and come back," said Wisniewski. "I jokingly say it's also like using World War II-level
communications: Somebody delivers a sheet to somebody else, and then they read it to the commander."

However, those holdover processes are becoming a thing of the past as the National Guard begins to embrace
artificial intelligence to help it see and understand situations quickly and employ resources faster to help save
lives and property.

And significantly reducing that lag in communication via AI is the aim of Project Theia an example of how the Guard
is committed to modernization, said Army Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau.

"It is widely known the National Guard has been at the forefront of domestic response efforts especially during the
past few decades," he said. "And this technology, simply put, is going to take us to the next level in not only how we
coordinate with local agencies, but the speed in which we can help save lives."

                                                                              Page 2 of 3
         NATIONAL GUARD EMPLOYS AI TO BATTLE WILDFIRES, IMPROVE DISASTER RESPONSE

Named after the Greek goddess of sight, Theia centralizes video data and then applies AI solutions to increase
situational awareness among those responding to natural or human-caused disasters.

"We are trying to get all the imagery that exists in the Guard and other military assets, dump it into one platform and
distribute it accordingly," said Wisniewski.

The technical aspects of the project begin with taking in video streams from military air assets along with imagery
and other information from ground assets.

"But whether it's a [UH-72A] Lakota military helicopter, MQ-9 Reaper [unmanned aerial system] or a civilian
partner's assets, the process of getting that footage is entirely different for each platform," said Wisniewski.

This presented the challenge, he said, of rapidly creating a common operating picture for response forces.

"So we built a system that said, 'Look, we'll handle the integration of all the systems, and then standardize the
metadata behind the full-motion imagery coming in to the point where I can run AI algorithms on it,'" Wisniewski
said.

The result is a web-based tool that provides clearer depictions of disaster areas, said Air Force Capt. Douglas
Witherspoon, with the California Air National Guard's 163rd Attack Wing.

"Now, artificial intelligence can take data from a video and create an overlay and then allow the aircraft's video
program to connect to it," he said. An overlay involves using Theia's software to render markings on top of a digital
map of the disaster site.

Because the overlay is constantly updating the imagery, Witherspoon added, analysts can better track fires.
Whereas before, he said, those same analysts manually created overlays on a printed map or applied them to a
digital one both time-consuming tasks.

"The technology we have now is more advanced and fully automated," Witherspoon said. "Using artificial
intelligence to visually augment live video feeds with highly accurate overlays of roads, key landmarks, and other
mission-critical data allows analysts to make time-sensitive decisions."

But first-line responders and ground operators benefit too, said Army Col. Daniel Bowles, vice director for the
National Guard Bureau's communications and computers directorate.

"You still have radio and satellite communications," he said. But one of Theia's key features is "getting real-time
information to the very person that's on the ground, as fast as we can make it and [enhancing] decision-making
capabilities."

The project also was an exercise in collaborating with academia. Through Hacking For Defense, a Defense
Department-sponsored university course, students work with defense and intelligence communities to rapidly
address the nation's emerging threats and security challenges.

"In the National Guard, we have a warrior's mindset when it comes to fixing a problem, which is not a bad thing,"
said Bowles. "But then we also have the mindset of a Citizen-Soldier or Airman meaning that we come from
industry, we come from the workforce, we come from academia, and we can provide multiple viewpoints."

Tapping into the talent of young minds in academia, he added, is a natural fit for the Guard.

"There are so many different solutions that are out there and when we look outside the box, we can leverage those
different things," Bowles said.

Yet with the technological wonders of AI, Wisniewski said the project highlighted another accomplishment.

"The real takeaway is the transformative approach to standardizing all these different formats of videos that are
coming in so we can apply AI solutions," he said.

                                                                              Page 3 of 3

With nearly 400 domestic response operations under its belt last year, Bowles said the Guard will continue to
strategize how it can integrate AI to better support federal and local officials during disasters.

"We're not just using new technology just to use it," said Bowles. "There's got to be a reason an understanding on
how it makes a process better."

Project officials expect to support the California National Guard during the upcoming wildfire season. They think the
system will be fully operational by the end of the year.

PR NewswireThe pioneering organization was awarded a $500,000 grant from Open AI to explore how artificial
intelligence can increase its impactATLANTA, July 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --Operation HOPEhas become the first
financial literacy nonprofit organization to embed artificial intelligence into its model. Open AI awarded its first-
ever grant to a community-based organization with $500,000 to help build out Operation HOPE's financial coaching
and support services. The grant was announced in December 2023 during theHOPE Global Forums | Annual
Meeting in Atlanta. Operation HOPE CEO John Hope Bryant and Open AI CEO Sam Altman also announced the
formation of a first-of-its-kind AI Ethics Council, which held its inaugural meeting on June 28th.

 The pioneering organization was awarded a $500,000 grant to explore how artificial intelligence can increase its
impact.To date, Operation HOPE has deployed artificial intelligence to:Optimize coaching effectiveness and
improve Operation HOPE's client experiences.Apply machine learning to identify specific actions and activities
HOPE Financial Coaches can do to improve coach-client interactions.Upgrading the client management system to
formulate AI-driven pathways to guide them toward improved outcomes.The partnership evolved when Mr. Altman
and Mr. Bryant joined together for a listening tour at Clark Atlanta University in the spring of 2024. They determined
that they share concerns about bias and discrimination in AI, yet also believe that AI can overwhelmingly positively
impact lives and create new economic opportunities for people of color. By working with HBCUs and civil rights
leaders, who have a rich history as shapers and guardians of civil liberties—along with deep experience in
understanding and guiding ethical decision-making during historical-critical junctures— the AI Ethics Council is
designed to help ensure the inclusivity of marginalized populations and people of color during this economic
revolution.At the inaugural meeting, James Hairston, Open AI's Head of International Policy and Partnerships,
briefed members on the current state of AI, including its challenges and opportunities. Mr. Bryant shared that he will
be convening a meeting of tech leaders to advance issues important to the council, and announced the Council
website will go live July 1, 2024. "I see this website as our first stake in the ground. Its substance will grow, expand,
and deepen over time. Transparency will be a hallmark. I encourage all citizens, here and abroad, to get informed
and educated around what AI really is and isn't," said Mr. Bryant. "As a council, we aim to focus our attention on the
needle we can help move: expanding inclusive opportunity around our shared future, for everyone, as it relates to
AI."A full replay of the conversation between Mr. Bryant and Mr. Altman at the Hope Global Forums can be

(TNSres) -- The National Science Foundation issued the following news release:

The U.S. National Science Foundation announced an inaugural investment of more than $18 million to 44
multidisciplinary, multi-sector teams across the U.S. through the NSF Responsible Design, Development and
Deployment of Technologies (NSF ReDDDoT) program. NSF ReDDDoT invests in the creation of technologies that
promote the public's well-being and mitigate potential harms by seeking to ensure that ethical, legal, community and
societal considerations are embedded in the lifecycle of technology's creation and use. NSF launched this program
in collaboration with leading philanthropic partners including the Ford Foundation, the Patrick J. McGovern
Foundation and Siegel Family Endowment.

"NSF is committed to creating mutually beneficial research collaborations among diverse partners who contribute
their expertise and resources to accelerating technology innovation that positively addresses pressing national,
societal and geostrategic challenges," said Erwin Gianchandani, assistant director for Technology, Innovation and
Partnerships. "Through a robust public-private partnership with philanthropies, NSF's investment in ReDDDoT aims
to ensure that TIP advances the design, development and deployment of new technologies responsibly. This
investment is consistent with the 'CHIPS and Science Act of 2022,' in which Congress called upon TIP to invest in
exactly this approach when pursuing the key technology areas listed in that law."

NSF awarded 30 teams Phase 1 funding: 21 teams will receive planning grants of up to $300,000 each for up to
two years to facilitate collaborative transdisciplinary and multi-sector activities to plan for submission of larger
proposals, while an additional nine teams will receive Phase 1 funding of up to $75,000 each to plan and host
workshops designed to raise awareness and identify relevant approaches and needs in the key technology areas
identified in the "CHIPS and Science Act of 2022."

Additionally, NSF awarded Phase 2 funding to 14 teams that demonstrated maturity in artificial intelligence,
biotechnology, or natural and anthropogenic disaster prevention or mitigation, key technology areas in the statute
that TIP emphasized for ReDDDoT funding. Each Phase 2 team will receive up to $1.5 million over three years to
expand upon their identified experience in use-inspired and translational activities in responsible design,
development and deployment of innovative technology.

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 5
   NSF and philanthropic partners invest more than $18M to prioritize ethical and societal considerations in the
                                       creation of emerging technologies

The ReDDDoT program invited proposals from teams that examined and demonstrated the principles,
methodologies and impacts associated with ethical, legal, community and societal considerations of technology's
creation and use, especially those specified in the "CHIPS and Science Act of 2022."NSF anticipates issuing a
second ReDDDoT funding opportunity in the future that will build on this round of funding to ensure ethical, legal,
community, and societal considerations are embedded in the lifecycle of technology's creation.

The following information was released by the National Science Foundation (NSF):

Awardees will contribute to the responsible advancement of emerging technologies to promote the public's well-
being and mitigate potential harms

September 23, 2024

The U.S. National Science Foundation announced an inaugural investment of more than $18 million to 44
multidisciplinary, multi-sector teams across the U.S. through the NSF Responsible Design, Development and
Deployment of Technologies (NSF ReDDDoT) program. NSF ReDDDoT invests in the creation of technologies that
promote the public's well-being and mitigate potential harms by seeking to ensure that ethical, legal, community and
societal considerations are embedded in the lifecycle of technology's creation and use. NSF launched this program
in collaboration with leading philanthropic partners including the Ford Foundation, the Patrick J. McGovern
Foundation and Siegel Family Endowment.

"NSF is committed to creating mutually beneficial research collaborations among diverse partners who contribute
their expertise and resources to accelerating technology innovation that positively addresses pressing national,
societal and geostrategic challenges," said Erwin Gianchandani, assistant director for Technology, Innovation and
Partnerships. "Through a robust public-private partnership with philanthropies, NSF's investment in ReDDDoT aims
to ensure that TIP advances the design, development and deployment of new technologies responsibly. This
investment is consistent with the 'CHIPS and Science Act of 2022,' in which Congress called upon TIP to invest in
exactly this approach when pursuing the key technology areas listed in that law."

NSF awarded 30 teams Phase 1 funding: 21 teams will receive planning grants of up to $300,000 each for up to
two years to facilitate collaborative transdisciplinary and multi-sector activities to plan for submission of larger
proposals, while an additional nine teams will receive Phase 1 funding of up to $75,000 each to plan and host
workshops designed to raise awareness and identify relevant approaches and needs in the key technology areas
identified in the "CHIPS and Science Act of 2022."

Additionally, NSF awarded Phase 2 funding to 14 teams that demonstrated maturity in artificial intelligence,
biotechnology, or natural and anthropogenic disaster prevention or mitigation, key technology areas in the statute

                                                                             Page 2 of 5

           SOCIETAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE CREATION OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

that TIP emphasized for ReDDDoT funding. Each Phase 2 team will receive up to $1.5 million over three years to
expand upon their identified experience in use-inspired and translational activities in responsible design,
development and deployment of innovative technology.

The ReDDDoT program invited proposals from teams that examined and demonstrated the principles,
methodologies and impacts associated with ethical, legal, community and societal considerations of technology's
creation and use, especially those specified in the "CHIPS and Science Act of 2022."NSF anticipates issuing a
second ReDDDoT funding opportunity in the future that will build on this round of funding to ensure ethical, legal,
community, and societal considerations are embedded in the lifecycle of technology's creation.

Gowtham Raj Veeraswamy Premkumar, M.S. '24 and CEC assistant professor Bryan Van Scoy's research
optimally places cellular connectivity where it is most needed.

By Katie Rottner, University Communications and Marketing

On a typical day, finding yourself without cell reception is an inconvenience. But in a disaster scenario requiring on-
the-ground rescue response, a lack of connectivity can mean life or death. Assistant Professor of Electrical and
Computer Engineering Bryan Van Scoy and recent Master of Science graduate Gowtham Raj Veeraswamy
Premkumar have collaborated on research that can be applied to disaster scenarios to reinstate cellular
connectivity when base towers are down by using swarms of autonomous drones optimized with machine learning.

"What we are trying to do is provide a swarm of UAVs [Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, often referred to as drones]
which would provide network connectivity without base stations," said Gowtham Raj, who graduated from the
College of Engineering and Computing in May 2024 with a Master of Science in Electrical and Computer
Engineering. "They get connectivity directly from the satellite, and each drone can provide a network for 20 users."
Gowtham Raj explained that with this functionality, the drone swarm (a group of interconnected drones) could act
as a remote base station which can move to where it is most needed. "My part in this research is to make these
drones fly autonomously, without any human intervention," he said.

UAVs, or drones, are currently used in a number of ways in society. They're used for deliveries, for surveillance,
and for fun. But in most applications, UAVs are operated through a remote control system, with a person physically
controlling the operation of the drone. However, in Gowtham Raj and Van Scoy's use case, manual operation of an
entire swarm of drones is too complicated for one remote control. Because of this, artificial intelligence is

                                                                                               Page 2 of 3
      CEC Research Optimizes Autonomous Drone Swarms With AI for Potential Disaster Response Applications

incorporated into the operation of the interconnected drone swarms, so that they can optimally position themselves
where they are most needed.

In a continuation of research first conducted by Ran Zhang, Ph.D., former assistant professor of Electrical and
Computer Engineering at Miami University, Gowtham Raj and Van Scoy's research incorporates neural networks
and deep reinforcement learning to provide a central control action for all the drones. In the first iteration of this
research with former assistant professor Zhang, each individual drone had "its own 'brain' to position itself where
the ground users are," said Gowtham Raj. However, he said, in this subsequent phase of the research, "a
centralized algorithm positions these drones as a swarm." In other words, one central control action controls all the
drones and optimally positions itself where the users are, autonomously. This allows more drones to work together
to provide more connectivity for an optimal number of ground users.

The deep reinforcement learning used by Gowtham Raj and Van Scoy in this project is an advanced machine
learning technique currently at work in technologies like ChatGPT. Using this advanced machine learning, the
research duo has focused on reducing the time complexity of drone swarm positioning. "The central algorithm had
some time issues: it took more time to position where the ground users are," Gowtham Raj said. To solve this, "we
did mathematical optimization on how to position the drones where there are a maximum number of users." Using
industrial optimization solvers and mathematical modeling around the constraints of drone bandwidth and
operational boundaries, Gowtham Raj and Van Scoy worked on how to ensure the drone swarm flew autonomously
to areas where there were a large number of users in need of connection.

Gowtham Raj and Van Scoy's research centered on a simulation environment with disaster response as just one
possible application for their work. Their research focused on drone swarm operations in which the swarms
autonomously traveled to "places where there are dense clusters of users, rather than going to a place where there
are no users and when the resources are spent unnecessarily," Gowtham Raj said.

Originally from South India, Gowtham Raj's time at Miami University has included more than just exceptional
research opportunities. He said his time as a graduate student in Oxford has been "the best two years of my life,
because I have a great friend circle" with other graduate and Ph.D. students from across the university. His
relationship with Van Scoy has also been extremely positive. "(Van Scoy) supported me a lot," Gowtham Raj said.
"He motivated me until the end. He showed me the path, and I traveled towards that, and that's how this ended
successfully."

For his part, Van Scoy is just as appreciative of Gowtham Raj's efforts and talents. ""Gowtham Raj has been
exceptionally motivated to succeed," said the Electrical and Computer Engineering faculty member, a department
which celebrates its 20th anniversary this academic year. "This helped him persevere ... to successfully complete
his master's degree at Miami University."

The following information was released by the University of Colorado - Boulder:

By Susan Glairon

In disaster and emergency management, rescue teams rely on simple tools, like drones and mobile devices
connected to the internet, to take photos of damaged buildings and document the resulting destruction. First
responders use this information to prioritize where help is needed immediately and in the long-term.

At the same time, many emergency response agencies have been slow to embrace advanced tools like artificial
intelligence (AI) due to concerns of complexity, training needs, initial costs and the potential impact on their work,
said Professor Amir H. Behzadan, of CU Boulder's Department of Civil, Environmental and Architectural
Engineering and a faculty research fellow of the Natural Hazards Center at the Institute of Behavioral Science.

"This hesitation, along with a historical lack of diversity in the workforce, has contributed to delayed and unfair
treatment of communities hit hardest by disasters," Behzadan said. "Lower-income disaster survivor homeowners
are not only less likely to receive assistance compared to wealthier counterparts, but also tend to receive
substantially less aid."

On April 19, Behzadan hosted a workshop titled "AI4DM - Harnessing Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Disaster
Management: Bridging Research, Practice, and Community Engagement," with participants from academia,
disaster management practitioners and disaster nonprofits. Attendees included representatives from CU Boulder,
Texas AandM University, University of Florida, University of North Texas, University of Texas at Arlington, and
University of Albany along with the Colorado Office of Emergency Management.

The workshop was supported by Behzadan's NSF grant from the Future of Work: Human-Technology Frontier
program, which aims to raise awareness of AI and related technologies in disaster management. Participants were
introduced to human-centered AI applications in disaster management and encouraged to work toward ways to
adopt AI-informed solutions.

"AI can be applied in disaster management for various purposes, such as generating instant disaster data
visualizations; providing interview training and reskilling/upskilling for employees; assessing and mapping disaster
damage; and enhancing disaster risk messaging and communication strategies," Behzaden said.

                                                                               Page 2 of 3
             CU BOULDER PIONEERS CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AI SOLUTIONS FOR DISASTERS

Human-centered AI focuses on designing AI systems that prioritize human needs, values, expectations and
experiences, aiming for beneficial, equitable, safe and ethical outcomes. In disaster and emergency management,
this includes increased representation of data from marginalized groups, using inclusive communication strategies
that resonate with at-risk communities, considering linguistic and cultural sensitivities and removing personal biases
when assessing community needs during disasters.

"Human-centered AI leads to more effective disaster response and recovery practices by promoting collaboration,
understanding and inclusivity among team members, survivors and stakeholders," Behzadan said. "It helps create
equitable solutions that address the needs of all affected communities, regardless of their socioeconomic and
cultural backgrounds."

Behzaden and his team plan to pursue additional funding to sustain these efforts. While leveraging their existing
partnerships in Texas and Florida, they are also forging new relationships with local communities as well as
disaster and emergency management organizations in Colorado who will ultimately be the beneficiaries of these
technologies.

"The success of any technology hinges on its adoption by the intended end users," Behzadan said. "Understanding
user needs and preferences, especially when working with vulnerable groups, is crucial for meaningful adoption and
realizing the full potential of technological advancements."

The following information was released by Iowa Senator Joni Ernst:

SBA has publicly touted its "artificial intelligence tools" yet continues to report that it has not used AI.

WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, is
exposing Biden's Small Business Administration (SBA) for pursuing costly Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology
while many SBA offices and programs lack even basic internet technology (IT) security, putting Americans' personal
information at risk.

The SBA has mainly used its $22 million IT Working Capital Fund (IT WCF) to prioritize pet projects that support
questionable policy changes and AI, while the agency as a whole continues to fail federal IT standards and has
significant security risks in its systems. Additionally, the SBA has not complied with an executive order that directs
federal agencies to list where and how they use AI.

To get answers and accountability, Ernst is calling on SBA Administrator Guzman to provide a full accounting of
how SBA is making investments from their IT Working Capital Fund budget.

She wrote, "It is vital the SBA use its IT WCF for authorized purposes only and make appropriate investments to
modernize IT infrastructure throughout the agency. The SBA has not done so, reportedly spending significant funds
on IT projects within some divisions, such as the Office of Capital Access, even as other offices appear to lack the
capacity to perform basic IT functions, like importing data from Excel spreadsheets.

"Specifically, SBA was cited as having ineffective management when it came to risk, supply chain risk, IT

Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, issued the following news release:

SBA has publicly touted its "artificial intelligence tools" yet continues to report that it has not used AI.

Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, is exposing Biden's Small
Business Administration (SBA) for pursuing costly Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology while many SBA offices
and programs lack even basic internet technology (IT) security, putting Americans' personal information at risk.

The SBA has mainly used its $22 million IT Working Capital Fund (IT WCF) to prioritize pet projects that support
questionable policy changes and AI, while the agency as a whole continues to fail federal IT standards and has
significant security risks in its systems. Additionally, the SBA has not complied with an executive order that directs
federal agencies to list where and how they use AI.

To get answers and accountability, Ernst is calling on SBA Administrator Guzman to provide a full accounting of
how SBA is making investments from their IT Working Capital Fund budget.

She wrote, "It is vital the SBA use its IT WCF for authorized purposes only and make appropriate investments to
modernize IT infrastructure throughout the agency. The SBA has not done so, reportedly spending significant funds
on IT projects within some divisions, such as the Office of Capital Access, even as other offices appear to lack the
capacity to perform basic IT functions, like importing data from Excel spreadsheets.

"Specifically, SBA was cited as having ineffective management when it came to risk, supply chain risk, IT
configurations, and identity and access policies. It also had ineffective data protection and privacy, security training
for personnel, information security continuous monitoring capabilities, and contingency planning.

"The SBA needs to do better, especially given the fact that thousands of Social Security Numbers were used to
commit fraud and identity theft in the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster
Loan (COVID-19 EIDL) programs.

"Additionally, the SBA has not complied with Executive Order (EO) 13960, Promoting the Use of Trustworthy
Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government, which directs federal agencies to list where and how they use AI.

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 3
                  Ernst Exposes SBA's Lack of IT Security as the Agency Pursues AI Technology

The SBA has touted its 'artificial intelligence tools for fraud review on all loans in the 7(a) and 504 Loan
Programs,' 'sophisticated automated reviews,' 'advanced data analytics,' 'machine learning functionality,' and
'artificial intelligence and machine learning solutions.' The SBA also launched an updated Lender Match tool that

LOGAN, Utah, Aug. 14 -- Utah State University issued the following news release:

Beneath almost every aspect of modern life streams a colossal river of data. From tracking weather to collecting
satellite images to monitoring air quality, traffic patterns, environmental changes and urban development, a
staggering amount of information is recorded about the world . over 147 million zettabytes per year by some
estimates. Artificial intelligence may be the only way to usefully manage this vast and growing asset. Deciding
how that happens is a question that will define this generation.

Two new certificates available through the Quinney College of Natural Resources offer a way for USU students to
be part of the answer. The Remote Sensing and Geospatial Artificial Intelligence Foundations certificate is for
undergraduates, while the Applied Remote Sensing Geospatial Artificial Intelligence certificate is for professionals
and graduate students. These certificates have been newly designed to teach deep-technology skills increasingly in
demand across the nation, according to Shannon Belmont from the Department of Environment and Society.

The proliferation of technology like drones and satellite images from Google Earth Engine makes access to high-
resolution imagery and data easier than ever, said Belmont, who directs the Utah Geospatial Consortium on
campus. With high-quality and large quantities of data so easily accessible, there is a growing market for
professionals with specialized skills in gathering, analyzing and delivering map information through Geospatial
Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), she said.

"GeoAI has the potential to address some of the earth's and society's most pressing challenges," said Elise Laugier,
certificate program director and assistant professor of geospatial science in Environment and Society. "It is
transforming the speed that we can extract meaning from complex datasets."

For instance, the speed that AI can process data, combined with real-time information about things like wildfires,
floods and hurricanes, allows for more accurate predictions of damage and change as the disaster unfolds. GeoAI
can make data-based predictions about what's likely to happen next in impacted environments. The information can
assist decision-making during the event, help to direct management during recovery, and can help researchers
monitor changing landscapes for potential risk factors in the future.

AI can also help harness vast amounts of data to draw insights from longer-term changes happening at the
interface of the environment and society, like monitoring agriculture and land use, urban green spaces, renewable
energy and water management, Laugier said.

                                                                             Page 2 of 3
      CHANGING THE MAP: NEW AI TECHNOLOGY, GEOSPATIAL MAPPING CERTIFICATES OFFERED

The two new certificates, offered through a grant from the Deep Technology Talent Initiative from the Utah System
of Higher Education, are designed to be stackable with existing degree programs at USU. For undergraduates,
students can pair the certificate with any major and can pursue both the Applied GIS and the Remote Sensing &
GeoAI certificates for broad and deep skill sets. At the graduate level, the new certificate can be standalone or
applied towards a professional Masters in Natural Resources. There also may be a future opportunity to combine
the certificate with the existing graduate certificate in GIS towards a professional master's degree in geospatial
applications.

Both programs will be available fully online, or with an option to mix online and in-person courses for students at the
Logan campus. In this first year, the certificate for undergraduates will be transitioning to fully online but is
immediately available to students both in Logan and across USU's statewide system.

The combination of these high-tech fields is a chance for game-changing innovation in many fields, including
environmental monitoring, urban planning, agriculture, disaster planning and response, and natural resource
management, said Claudia Radel, department head in Environment and Society.

As automation through machine learning increases efficiency, the role humans play is transforming, moving from
lower-level data management to higher-level tasks of problem definition, inquiry and innovation, according to the
coordinating team for the new certificates. The emerging role for humans is to engage with, guide and troubleshoot
GeoAI efforts with critical thinking, creative problem-solving, complex reasoning, emotional intelligence and other
distinctively human capabilities. For any query with respect to this article or any other content requirement, please

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued the following news release:

DHS's New "AI Corps" Will Advance President Biden's Executive Order on AI and Ensure Responsible Use of this
Powerful Technology

Secretary Mayorkas to Host Recruitment Event in Mountain View, CA

WASHINGTON -- Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Chief Information Officer
(CIO) and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) Eric Hysen announced the Department's first-ever hiring
sprint to recruit 50 Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology experts in 2024. The new DHS "AI Corps" is modeled
after the U.S. Digital Service, building teams that will help better leverage this new technology responsibly across
strategic areas of the homeland security enterprise including efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual
exploitation and abuse, deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our
cybersecurity.

The AI Corps will bolster the DHS workforce with experts in AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, models,
and applications who will support policy initiatives to ensure the safe and secure use of AI, while protecting privacy
and civil rights and civil liberties.

Using the Office of Personnel Management's new flexible hiring authorities for AI-related jobs, DHS has worked to
streamline and expedite the federal hiring process to ensure qualified candidates receive offers as quickly as
possible.

"As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful and more accessible than ever before, government needs the
support and expertise of our country's foremost AI experts to help ensure our continued ability to harness this
technology responsibly, safeguard against its malicious use, and advance our critical homeland security mission,"
said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas. "Our new AI Corps initiative will make it easier to
bring these talented, experienced, creative men and women into public service quickly. The DHS AI Corps will
enable the Department of Homeland Security to keep up with the pace of innovation as we enhance our work

                                                                                                             Page 2 of 4
              DHS Launches First-of-its-Kind Initiative to Hire 50 Artificial Intelligence Experts in 2024

combating fentanyl traffickers, rescuing victims of child sexual exploitation, countering cyberattacks, assessing
disaster damage, and much more."

The DHS AI Corps AI Technology experts will be part of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer and will
work on a variety of projects across the Department advancing AI innovation and use. They will provide expertise in
AI/ML, data science, data engineering, program management, product management, software engineering,
cybersecurity, and safe, secure, and responsible use of these technologies.

Secretary Mayorkas and CIO Hysen will launch the hiring effort at an event in Mountain View, CA. The event is
designed to generate interest in AI career opportunities within the Department. Leaders from the Department and
DHS agencies and offices will demonstrate to technologists from industry their use of AI to support their missions.
Leaders from the DHS Office of Customer Experience, launched in 2022, will discuss their approach to using AI to
improve service deliver; representatives of Homeland Security Investigations will showcase the role machine
learning plays in countering online child sexual exploitation and abuse; Immigration and Customs Enforcement
officials will present on ways AI can enhance immigration and citizenship services; and FEMA officials will present
on ways new technology can more quickly deliver disaster and humanitarian relief.

"Now is the time for tech experts to make a real difference for our country and join the federal government," said
Chief Information Officer and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen. "Modeled after the U.S. Digital
Service, the AI Corps will deploy teams of AI technology experts across DHS to solve problems and modernize the
delivery of services to the public. We are recruiting faster than ever because the need is urgent. More Americans
interact with DHS every day than any other federal agency, so the better and faster we can deploy responsible AI,
the more it can positively impact the American people. We are prioritizing recruiting talent who are technologically
proficient and eager to leverage recent innovations in AI to transform the way people interact with the government."

AI is already delivering significant value across DHS missions. For example:

Fentanyl Interdiction: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses a ML model to identify potentially suspicious
patterns in vehicle-crossing history. CBP recently used the model to flag a car for secondary review at a port of
entry, which yielded the discovery of over 75 kilograms of drugs hidden in the automobile. Last year alone, machine
learning models that help CBP Officers determine which suspicious vehicles and passengers to refer to secondary
screening have led to 240 seizures, which included thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine,
and fentanyl.

Combatting Online Child Sex Abuse: Last year, Homeland Security Investigation completed Operation Renewed
Hope, which focused on protecting children from sexual abuse online. Through new AI technology, DHS identified
more than 300 previously unknown victims of sexual exploitation and identified perpetrators thanks in part to a ML
model that enhanced older images to provide investigators with new leads.

Assessing Disaster Damage: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses AI to assess damage to
homes, buildings, and other property after a disaster more efficiently. Using ML, FEMA's analysts are able to
process images in days, as opposed to weeks, and provide disaster assistance to survivors that much faster.

Last year, DHS established the Department's first AI Task Force and named CIO Hysen its first Chief AI Officer.
The Task Force is working across the DHS mission to identify areas where AI can improve its work. For instance, it
is working to enhance the integrity of our supply chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to
improve cargo screening, the identification of imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management.
The Task Force is also charged with using AI to better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of
precursor chemicals around the world, and disrupt key nodes in criminal networks.

DHS's work on AI is part of a whole-of-government effort to address this emerging technology. In October,
President Biden issued an Executive Order, "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial
Intelligence," which directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks
and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-
related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions.

                                                                                                             Page 3 of 4

Amsterdam and Almaty, 6 February 2024: VEON Ltd. (NASDAQ: VEON, Euronext Amsterdam: VEON), a global
digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services, today announced that its subsidiary
Beeline Kazakhstan has deployed Orman-AI - an artificial intelligence-based monitoring system to detect forest
fires.

Both naturally and due to climate change, Kazakhstan is prone to devastating blazes, that spread fast across vast
areas, are impossible to stop once started and take the lives of both humans and animals every year. Orman-AI
reports the outbreak of fires by automatically detecting the first signs of smoke and enables rapid action to stop the
proliferation of forest fires. It combines Beeline’s towers as monitoring platforms, video surveillance systems with
360 degree computer vision, and Beeline’s mobile connectivity, uploading data real time into an AI analytics engine
capable of detecting smoke appearances.

The system works in weather from -50 to +50 degrees Celsius, which is especially important in the extreme
continental climate of the country.

In an era of rapid climate change, forest fires are an increasingly common problem and caused damage to 103
thousand hectares of land in Kazakhstan in 2022 alone, nearly 40% the land area of Luxembourg. If detected too
late, they are hard to extinguish and pose a serious threat to rural communities.

“Detection of fires through augmented intelligence is a pragmatic approach, and this could be extended to
agricultural and other community applications,” comments Evgeniy Nastradin, the CEO of Beeline Kazakhstan.
“This initiative shows Beeline and VEON's commitment to the country, using cutting edge technology to create
solutions to real problems, including safeguarding the population against natural disasters,” he adds.

Orman-AI has been launched through a partnership between Beeline Kazakhstan and the Department of Natural
Resources and Environmental Management of the Akimat of the Kostanay Region. During the first test period,
some 34 cameras managed to generate alerts for 50 fires in the region. In the future, the system could also be

deployed to assist farmers and improve agricultural yields by using AI to determine when crops require watering or
fertilizer, and to keep track of livestock.

This is yet another major AI-based solution from Beeline Kazakhstan. Last year, Beeline’s information technologies
subsidiary QazCode launched BeeBert AI module, training AI in Kazakh language for customer experience
applications.

Washington, D.C. - Today, the House Science, Space and Technology Committee passed four bills on a bipartisan
basis to advance research and technology development, ensuring that the United States remains a global leader in
artificial intelligence, energy, and natural disaster resilience:

* H.R. 9671, the Department of Energy (DOE) Artificial Intelligence Act, provides updated guidance for DOE's
activities in developing advanced artificial intelligence systems to carry out its national security, energy, and
scientific discovery missions.

* H.R. 9710, the Small Modular Reactor Demonstration Act, gives direction and guidance to DOE to create
demonstration projects and empower research on small modular reactors and micro-reactors.

* H.R. 9720, the AI Incident Reporting and Security Enhancement Act, directs National Institute Standards and
Technologies (NIST) to use existing vulnerability management processes to account for AI vulnerabilities.

* H.R. 9723, the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program Reauthorization Act, reauthorizes and revamps
NIST's program to improve collaboration and research on the effects of climate change on windstorm behavior.

Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (VA-04), a member of the House Science Committee, successfully offered an
amendment to H.R. 9723 based on her recently introduced H.R. 9771, the Building and Upgrading Infrastructure for
the Long Term (BUILT) Act. McClellan's amendment will support interdisciplinary coordination to address the risks
to infrastructure integrity resulting from changing climate and environmental conditions. Watch her testimony in
committee here.

"As the climate crisis continues to worsen, we must take immediate action to mitigate the most devastating impacts
and protect our communities and critical infrastructure systems from harm," said Congresswoman McClellan.
"Devastating extreme weather events remind us of the urgency of the moment and the need to continue improving
our resiliency efforts. I offered provisions from my BUILT Act as an amendment to the National Windstorm Impact
Reduction Program Reauthorization Act of 2024 to invest in our future by promoting forward-looking research into
climate resiliency."

                                                                                            Page 2 of 3
    House Science Committee Passes Bills to Advance Research and Technology Development on AI, Nuclear
                     Energy, and Natural Disasters Committee-Passed Legislation In....

The BUILT Act directs the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to facilitate research on how
climate conditions can affect subsurface properties and how technology can be used to assess infrastructure
integrity risks, as well as to convene a workshop of representatives across the public and private sector.

The BUILT Act is endorsed by the American Geophysical Union and the National Institute of Building Sciences.
Both are concerned with the advancement of solutions to solve local and community-based problems with the built
environment.

"The nation's deficient infrastructure must be improved to protect American lives," said Dr. George Guszcza,
President and CEO of the National Institute of Building Sciences. "NIST recognizes the role lifeline infrastructure
plays to support community resilience and recovery after disasters. Together, we can build a framework to design
resilient buildings and infrastructure."

DHS's New "AI Corps" Will Advance President Biden's Executive Order on AI and Ensure Responsible Use of this
Powerful Technology

Secretary Mayorkas to Host Recruitment Event in Mountain View, CA

WASHINGTON Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Chief Information Officer (CIO)
and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer (CAIO) Eric Hysen announced the Department's first-ever hiring sprint to
recruit 50 Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology experts in 2024. The new DHS "AI Corps" is modeled after the
U.S. Digital Service, building teams that will help better leverage this new technology responsibly across strategic
areas of the homeland security enterprise including efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and
abuse, deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity.

The AI Corps will bolster the DHS workforce with experts in AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, models,
and applications who will support policy initiatives to ensure the safe and secure use of AI, while protecting privacy
and civil rights and civil liberties.

Using the Office of Personnel Management's new flexible hiring authorities for AI-related jobs, DHS has worked to

                                             2024

The DHS AI Corps AI Technology experts will be part of the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer and will
work on a variety of projects across the Department advancing AI innovation and use. They will provide expertise in
AI/ML, data science, data engineering, program management, product management, software engineering,
cybersecurity, and safe, secure, and responsible use of these technologies.

Secretary Mayorkas and CIO Hysen will launch the hiring effort at an event in Mountain View, CA. The event is
designed to generate interest in AI career opportunities within the Department. Leaders from the Department and
DHS agencies and offices will demonstrate to technologists from industry their use of AI to support their missions.
Leaders from the DHS Office of Customer Experience, launched in 2022, will discuss their approach to using AI to
improve service deliver; representatives of Homeland Security Investigations will showcase the role machine
learning plays in countering online child sexual exploitation and abuse; Immigration and Customs Enforcement
officials will present on ways AI can enhance immigration and citizenship services; and FEMA officials will present
on ways new technology can more quickly deliver disaster and humanitarian relief.

"Now is the time for tech experts to make a real difference for our country and join the federal government," said
Chief Information Officer and Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen. "Modeled after the U.S. Digital
Service, the AI Corps will deploy teams of AI technology experts across DHS to solve problems and modernize the
delivery of services to the public. We are recruiting faster than ever because the need is urgent. More Americans
interact with DHS every day than any other federal agency, so the better and faster we can deploy responsible AI,
the more it can positively impact the American people. We are prioritizing recruiting talent who are technologically
proficient and eager to leverage recent innovations in AI to transform the way people interact with the government."

AI is already delivering significant value across DHS missions. For example:

Fentanyl Interdiction: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) uses a ML model to identify potentially suspicious
patterns in vehicle-crossing history. CBP recently used the model to flag a car for secondary review at a port of
entry, which yielded the discovery of over 75 kilograms of drugs hidden in the automobile. Last year alone, machine
learning models that help CBP Officers determine which suspicious vehicles and passengers to refer to secondary
screening have led to 240 seizures, which included thousands of pounds of cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine,
and fentanyl.

Combatting Online Child Sex Abuse: Last year, Homeland Security Investigation completed Operation Renewed
Hope, which focused on protecting children from sexual abuse online. Through new AI technology, DHS identified
more than 300 previously unknown victims of sexual exploitation and identified perpetrators thanks in part to a ML
model that enhanced older images to provide investigators with new leads.

Assessing Disaster Damage: The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) uses AI to assess damage to
homes, buildings, and other property after a disaster more efficiently. Using ML, FEMA's analysts are able to
process images in days, as opposed to weeks, and provide disaster assistance to survivors that much faster.

Last year, DHS established the Department's first AI Task Force and named CIO Hysen its first Chief AI Officer.
The Task Force is working across the DHS mission to identify areas where AI can improve its work. For instance, it
is working to enhance the integrity of our supply chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to
improve cargo screening, the identification of imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management.
The Task Force is also charged with using AI to better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of
precursor chemicals around the world, and disrupt key nodes in criminal networks.

DHS's work on AI is part of a whole-of-government effort to address this emerging technology. In October,
President Biden issued an Executive Order, "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial
Intelligence," which directed DHS to promote the adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks
and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-
related intellectual property theft, and help the United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions.

 Bayanat AI (ADX:BAYANAT) and Al Yah Satellite Communications (ADX:YAHSAT) placed the United Arab
Emirate's first synthetic aperture radar, or SAR, satellite into orbit, marking an inaugural step in their earth
observation space program, according to an Aug. 17 announcement.

Under the in-country space program created in 2023, the duo aims to build a constellation of at least five SAR Low
Earth orbit, or LEO, satellites, which provide high-resolution geospatial images promptly for applications in disaster
management, maritime surveillance and smart mobility. The insights can be provided day and night, regardless of
weather conditions or solar illumination.

Finnish satellite imaging company ICEYE, which operates the world's largest constellation of SAR satellites,
manufactured and launched the debutant satellite for Bayanat and Al Yah on Aug. 16 from the Vandenberg Space
Force Base in California, US. Bayanat, a geospatial artificial intelligence company, owns the satellite conducting
early routine operations after establishing communication.

Bayanat and the UAE's flagship satellite telecommunication company Al Yah are advancing the UAE's space sector
ahead of the completion of their planned merger to become an artificial intelligence-powered space technology
major in the Middle East and North Africa region. Subject to obtaining regulatory and other relevant approvals, the
merger is expected to close in the second half of 2024.

"The successful launch of our SAR satellite is a testament to the synergies between Bayanat and Yahsat as we
press ahead with the anticipated merger to form Space42. The SAR satellite constellation to be launched over the
next 3 years will enable us to expand as a multi-orbit satellite operator, encompassing Geostationary Orbit and Low
Earth Orbit satellites while also developing satellite manufacturing capabilities in the UAE," said Al Yah Satellite
Chief Executive Officer Ali Al Hashemi.

The following information was released by Ohio State University - Columbus:

The challenges and opportunities raised by the growing use of artificial intelligence systems are at the forefront of
operational and ethical considerations for government and higher education leaders. While the use of artificial
intelligence has become more common thanks to programs like ChatGPT or DALL-E, machine learning is not a
new phenomenon.

Walter "Ted" Carter Jr., president of The Ohio State University, remembers one of the early machine-learning
programs that helped U.S. Navy fighter planes navigate the precarious task of landing on an aircraft carrier sailing
in the deep ocean.

"We had created, through a lot of science, a mechanism that could actually manage the stick and throttle against
that three-dimensional moving [aircraft carrier], learn and land the airplane safely," he said. "I have over 2,000
carrier landings and I have more than a handful using that technology."

Carter said one time the technology didn't work correctly and it almost ended in a plane crash for him and his
colleague.

"So it's an early lesson, going back 41 years, about how the early development of machine-learning can be an
asset but also can end up in disaster," he said.

Fast forward to 2024, and Carter is leading a university that conducts more than $230 million in AI research
involving more than 600 faculty members. Ohio State is also home to the Artificially Intelligent Manufacturing
Systems (AIMS) Lab, which brings together industry professionals and academia to deploy AI in manufacturing,
and the AI-EDGE Institute, which is working at the intersection of AI and networking to lay the groundwork for more
intelligent transportation systems, remote health care and smart aerospace.

Carter was part of a day-long series of discussions for the inaugural Artificial Intelligence Symposium at the
Statehouse this week. The Inter-University Council hosted the event, bringing together AI experts from the state's
14 public universities, industry leaders and government agencies.

                                                                                Page 2 of 3
             OHIO STATE PRESIDENT DISCUSSES AI IN HIGHER ED AT STATEHOUSE SUMMIT

The goal of the symposium was to discuss how Ohio can leverage its artificial intelligence assets to advance the
state's interests. From deep fakes and disinformation to preparing students to use AI in the workforce to driving AI
innovation through university and industry partnerships, several topics were explored in depth.

Colleges and universities in Ohio already partner with industry leaders such as Microsoft, IBM and Qualcomm in the
use of AI for research and development. Beena Sukumaran, dean of the College of Engineering and Computing at
Miami University, described the development of a smart factory with Mitsubishi to simulate a factory floor.

"What we envision using the smart factory for is not only to give our students hands-on experience but also to
integrate AI technology into manufacturing processes to make it more efficient," she said.

Beyond industry, the panelists agreed that students need to be prepared to incorporate AI into their academic
careers. RJ Sargent, executive director of learning services at the University of Cincinnati's 1819 Innovation Hub,
said equity and digital literacy is critical.

"We want to make sure that it's not just our engineers, our computer scientists, our data folks in the college of
business that are using this, but that this digital and AI literacy is foundational to all UC students," he said.

Carter said the next evolution of AI will need to include understanding ethical decision-making,

"To me, that's the next stage ... as we get to the next level of supercomputer [research]. And that may take a lot
longer to do than we think. I think that if I could have a magic wand, we would apply resources to do that
collaboratively because we do have so much talent in all of our 14 public universities."

LOS ANGELES, July 09, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- At the start of the 2024 Fire Season, AX’s FireScout AI
SaaS technology emerges as a leading technology on a global basis, in combating these devastating events. The
fire season has barely begun, yet communities around the globe are already experiencing unprecedented
challenges. Early reports indicate a severe season ahead, with increasing numbers of wildfires and acres burned.

AX is a global leader in advanced technology solutions, with a presence spanning the United States, Korea,
Australia, and Europe. “Our mission is to provide cutting-edge, AI-driven solutions to address some of the world’s
most pressing issues, including wildfire management,” said Michael Plaksin, the President and CEO of AX. He
adds, “FireScout, our state-of-the-art AI SaaS technology, has already demonstrated significant success in early
detection and rapid response to wildfires, helping to save lives, property, and natural resources.”

FireScout’s innovative approach utilizes advanced algorithms and real-time data to identify fire threats faster and
more accurately than traditional methods. This proactive system enables firefighting teams to respond swiftly,
minimizing the impact of wildfires. Our technology has been implemented across various regions, yielding
remarkable results in reducing the devastation caused by these natural disasters.

Despite our global successes, the situation in California highlights the urgent need for enhanced fire management
solutions.

The latest statistics from California are alarming:
    •     Over 312,403 total emergency responses have been recorded year-to-date.
    •     More than 3,499 wildfires have occurred, almost double the five-year average.
    •     Over 197,288 acres have burned, nearly 12x the five-year average.
    •     128 structures have been damaged or destroyed.
    •     Average Impact of Wildfires in California: $5B per year, and growing.

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 3

                                                    the Crisis

These numbers do not even account for the upcoming peak months of July through September, indicating a
worsening trend that requires immediate action.

FireScout is not presently being utilized on as many of California cameras, leaving the state without the
internationally proven benefits and accuracy of AX’s advanced AI technology, being able to detect fires in less than
1 minute, and providing notifications to first responders anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours prior to a 911 call. It
appears, the present alternatives have proven to be insufficient in addressing the scale and intensity of the current
and growing fire threats.

The State of California urgently needs a more advanced artificial intelligence fire detection software program to
support and combat the escalating wildfire crisis. FireScout’s proven effectiveness in early detection and rapid
response would be a game-changer for California, as it already has in the recent past, providing the much-needed
edge to protect lives, properties, and the environment.

The following information was released by the World Bank:

In late 1981, the legendary urban design expert Allan B. Jacobs was walking along a road in Tangshan, China,
visiting a new housing development when he noticed improvised, hand-made grates covering many windows and
porches. He commented to his Chinese colleague that in the United States, such grates would indicate to visitors
that the residents considered the neighborhood unsafe. When his colleague confirmed the same was true in China,
Jacobs realized that most professions use these types of simple visual clues as a way to understand a
neighborhood and wondered why urban planners did not follow suit.

This is how Jacobs opens his seminal book, Looking at Cities, dedicated to the art of urban observation and
detection of urban clues.1 Four decades later, Jacobs' framework remains relevant, even as the tools we use to
study and visualize cities have transformed.We no longer require a notebook and comfortable shoes to understand
an urban environment. Today, from a continent away, we can see not just whether a neighborhood has grates on its
windows, but also whether building foundations are cracking, roads are paved, and sidewalks navigable for
wheelchairs. Quite simply, with a computer and internet connection, we can bring Jacobs' approach to almost any
neighborhood anywhere in the world.

Recent technological advancements enable us to efficiently review images, identify urban clues, and reveal spatial
patterns across an entire neighborhood or city. By applying machine learning algorithms to high-resolution imagery
taken above the city (aerial imagery) and at ground level (street view imagery), we can make comprehensive, multi-
view urban observations from the sky and street. The resulting georeferenced datasets and accompanying
visualizations hold enormous potential to help create resilient, healthy communities. That includes unprecedented
opportunities for spatial planning, disaster and climate risk management and reduction.

Using this data, planners and engineers can analyze built components to gather clues about blocks,
neighborhoods, and cities through access to a wide-ranging overview of specific urban characteristics, such as
each unit's:

Size (area, height, and volume of building)

Use (residential, commercial, critical infrastructure, or mixed)

                                                                             Page 2 of 3
   JACOBS' DREAM: IMPROVING DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT USING VISUAL CLUES IN THE AGE OF
                                AI AND MACHINE LEARNING

Masonry (unreinforced, reinforced, or unknown)

Vintage (for example, pre-1940, 1941-1974, 1975-1999, and 2000-present. These are locally determined based on
field surveys conducted by structural engineers.)

Roof condition (good, fair, poor, under construction or vacant)

Roof material (concrete, metal, mixed, tile, other)

Wall condition (good, fair, poor)

Wall material (typically: brick or concrete block, plaster, mix/unclear/other; can include: wood polished, wood -
crude/plank, adobe, corrugated metal, stone with mud/ashlar with lime or cement, container/trailer, plant material)

Total condition (composite estimation based on roof and wall conditions)

Taken together, these unprecedented rapid, high-resolution screenings across multiple square kilometers enable
cheaper, more efficient, and more targeted pre- and post-disaster planning. While collecting a house-by-house
census can take months or require thousands of workers, high-resolution images can now be captured by a team of
four within a week, often using a single car, a drone, and a few cameras.

As outlined in a newlypublished papersupported by Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery's
(GFDRR's) Global Program for Resilient Housing,this approach enables planners to identify specific buildings at
scale that need improvements or strengthening.It holds promise for use as a proxy forsocial vulnerability,a crucial
aspect of disaster risk management. Related work can inform region-widetraffic and infrastructure management
decisionsand scan for buildings'structural vulnerabilities in earthquake-prone areas.Future developments might
pinpoint roofs that could generate solar power or identify emergency routes and shelters.

Where and how might this be applied?

This approach is suitable for almost any environment. Local officials can prioritize neighborhoods and cities with
limited, recent data describing their built environment, especially locations with natural hazards or other risks. Areas
of interest typically span 15 to 25 square kilometers, though this approach has been implemented in locations up to
80 square kilometers, making itsuitable for small island states.

An important step is to gather the street view imagery. While this is easiest to capture from a car mounted with
many cameras (e.g., Google Street View), in informal areas or places with narrow pathways, capturing these
images can require attaching a 360 camera (e.g., GoPro Fusion) to a backpack mounted on a motorcycle or carried
on foot.

Once the street view data has been collected, it can be uploaded to Mapillary, a crowdsourced platform, which blurs
faces and license plates before the imagery is publicly available. As street view coverage is not yet ubiquitous, this
provides open-source access to recent street view imagery and circumvents licensing requirements while still
protecting personal privacy.

Next, as many contemporary solutions leverage artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), or deep
learning (DL), it is crucial tofollow ethical guidelines and mitigate potential biases in training datafor a successful
project. And, of course, local experts and other users can then review the datasets and ensure that the predictions
and classifications made by the algorithms are accurate.This approach has been effective in various
countries,including Colombia, Guatemala, Indonesia, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Saint Lucia, and Sint Maarten.

Quite notably, in these projects, the urban imagery and machine learning results are navigable in a browser
interface. This approach makes detailed information accessible to local planners and officials with an internet
connection and login credentials to the open-source geospatial portal.2This means that users of diverse expertise
can verify the machine learning predictions with the imagery and conduct simple analyses to visualize patterns in

                                                                             Page 3 of 3

the built environment. The portal can export machine learning predictions and, given their granularity, can be
combined with other data for further hazard and risk analysis.

Altogether, using classic observational principles and machine learning algorithms to evaluate buildings,
neighborhoods, and urban areas, we can now make educated and efficient inferences about vast, complex built
environments. Specific, granular information and visualizations are available to save and improve lives, protect
assets, and shield economies from increasing disaster risks.

In short, in 2024, using machine learning and imagery collected from the sky and street, we can finally make
Jacobs' vision from 1981 a reality: widespread, simple visual analysis that helps inform urban development and,
ultimately, improves people's lives.

Virginia Tech issued the following news:

Thousands of well-meaning social media users have been sharing photos supposedly depicting the aftermath of
Hurricane Helene's destruction that have turned out to be fake images generated by artificial intelligence (AI).
These fake images can erode trust in legitimate sources of news during a crisis or even function as a vector for
cyberattacks.

Communication media expert Cayce Myers explained the problems these fake images pose, while digital literary
expert Julia Feerrar shared steps for determining whether a compelling image is AI-generated or taken out of
context from another source.

Cayce Myers on challenges of AI-generated fakes

"The Hurricane Helene photos demonstrate the current challenges with disinformation and social media. AI
technology is providing greater ability to create realistic images that are deceptive," Myers said. "The hurricane
images have certainly had an impact on the public, and their spread and believability demonstrate how we now live
in a new technological and communication reality in the age of artificial intelligence.

"The problem is these fake images influence peoples' perception of reality, and social media fuels the spread of this
disinformation. The net effect can be harmful to society, especially when dealing with important issues like
democracy and public health," Myers said.

Julia Feerrar on detecting fake or out-of-context images

"Here are some steps for vetting the images you see in your social media feeds," Feerrar said.

"Take a moment to pause when you see an image or other media that sparks a big response for you. The
emotional aspect of information-sharing during and after a disaster like Hurricane Helene is so challenging, and
with AI-generated content in the mix it can be especially hard to sift through information to help us understand the
situation and take action to help."

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 3
            Fake Hurricane Helene images go viral, experts discuss the problem and how to counteract

"Open up your search engine of choice to find more context. Describing the image and adding the phrase 'fact
check' to your search is often the fastest way to get more information and debunk misleading content."

"Use reverse image search tools like TinEye or Google Lens to see where else a certain image has been shared
online. This strategy can help you catch AI-generated images, as well as older images from other events that may
have been reshared out of context."

"Look out for images with strange lighting, hyper-real or overly smooth surfaces, or other details that feel 'off.'
Inconsistencies in hands and feet, in particular, are a red flag for AI-generated content, though we can't count on
these cues as AI tools are continuing to improve."

"Vet social media posts that ask you to take action, such as donating through a link. It can often be safer to go
directly to a given organization's donation page. Multiple national and local organizations, as well as universities,
have curated lists of places to donate and help further."

Microsoft issued the following news release on Sept. 17, 2024:

ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates -- As Microsoft Corp. and G42 continue to advance our collaboration, we are
sharing two significant initiatives to help ensure that AI is used responsibly and serves the world. This work builds
on the partnership we jointly announced earlier this year and marks the beginning of several additional steps we will
announce in the weeks and months ahead.

Today, we're announcing the establishment in Abu Dhabi of two new centers that together will advance our
collective Responsible AI goals. The first, co-founded and co-funded by G42 and Microsoft, with the endorsement
of Abu Dhabi's Artificial Intelligence and Advanced Technology Council (AIATC), will identify, develop and
advance best practices and industry standards for the responsible use of AI in the Middle East and the Global
South. The second is the expansion of Microsoft's AI for Good Research Lab into Abu Dhabi, which will support AI
projects that address key societal goals.

The first center will convene academic researchers and AI practitioners from across the private sector to develop,
document and share emerging Responsible AI best practices. G42 and Microsoft are both committed to working
closely with the Center to bring together individuals and organizations from across the Middle East, the Global
South, and more broadly to learn from each other and develop ongoing advances in this emerging field.

Simultaneously, Microsoft's AI for Good Lab will open a center in Abu Dhabi, its first in the Middle East. This new
lab will harness the power of AI to collaborate with nonprofit organizations and partners, addressing key economic
and societal challenges across the Middle East and Africa. In close collaboration with the Lab's existing team in
Nairobi, this initiative will prioritize the development of large language models for underrepresented languages,
helping bridge the global language divide. It will also focus on advancing food security and strengthening climate
resilience by applying AI to high-resolution geospatial data, enhancing disaster preparedness and response
capabilities.

The partnership will work alongside the AIATC, which was created in January to develop plans and research
programs in collaboration with local and global partners to enhance Abu Dhabi's status in the fields of artificial
intelligence and advanced technology.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 4
                  Microsoft: Another Important Step in Advancing Responsible AI to Serve The World

The two centers build on the work that Microsoft and G42 are taking together to implement Responsible AI
standards and practices. This includes working to ensure that the two companies' generative AI models and
applications are developed, deployed and used safely -- a commitment that is at the heart of the Responsible AI
policies that Microsoft has developed and implemented, and that G42 is now adopting in connection with our
partnership and the commitments made to the U.S. and UAE governments.

Among other things, these policies govern the design and use of AI applications, incorporate digital safety and
cybersecurity plans for model training and deployment, and establish "red teaming" processes to harden AI
systems against probing, testing and attacks. G42's adoption of these policies will solidify the UAE's position as a
trusted global AI hub and ensure that Microsoft and G42 AI technologies running on Azure are responsibly shared
with our growing joint customer base, globally.

"Today's steps will add to the important progress Microsoft and G42 are making to broaden access to the
responsible, safe, and secure use of artificial intelligence," said Brad Smith, Vice Chair and President of
Microsoft. "We are committed to additional steps with G42 that advance responsible AI use for customers and that
strengthen the relationship not only between our two companies, but between our two countries."

Peng Xiao, Group CEO of G42, said, "By advancing Responsible AI together with Microsoft, we are creating a
framework for AI to serve all of humanity. These new centers reflect our shared vision for leveraging technology to
solve real-world challenges, positioning Abu Dhabi as a global hub for AI innovation that prioritizes safety, trust and
collaboration, especially across the global south."

Since Microsoft and G42 launched their partnership in April, the two companies have been executing under the
commitments of the Intergovernmental Assurance Agreement, with support and oversight by both the U.S. and UAE
governments.

As a matter of corporate policy instituted earlier this year, G42 and its affiliates do not conduct business with any
entity listed on the U.S. Government Consolidated Screening List. The Microsoft and G42 compliance committee
meets quarterly, and the two teams maintain a weekly cadence for progress reviews. G42's compliance program is
designed to be "best in class," ensuring the highest standards of business practices and security principles.

This partnership presents a strategic opportunity to bring world-class technology to underserved regions such as
the global south. G42's efforts in creating a regulated and monitored environment for deploying U.S.-developed
advanced technology systems are essential for meeting international AI demands. Our collaboration aims to bridge
the digital divide, address pressing social challenges, and promote democratic norms in cyberspace. We have
already announced a $1 billion investment in Kenya leveraging geothermal energy, and are actively exploring other
strategic markets.

In addition, the migration of G42's legacy public cloud infrastructure to Microsoft Azure began in November 2023
and is continuing as planned. This migration is critical for ensuring secure and efficient operations.

Microsoft and G42 believe in the transformative power of AI and cloud technologies, and our partnership is built on
a foundation of trust, security, shared values, and a commitment to the highest standards of regulatory compliance.
Microsoft and G42 are dedicated to ensuring that our collaboration contributes positively to global technological
advancement.

        New York (CNN) &#8212; Three Mile Island, the site of worst nuclear disaster in the United States, is
reopening and will exclusively sell the power to Microsoft as the company searches for energy sources to fuel its AI
ambitions.

Constellation Energy announced Friday that its Unit 1 reactor, which closed five years ago, is expected to be
revived in 2028, dependent on Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval. Microsoft will purchase the carbon-free
energy produced from it to power its data centers to support artificial intelligence.

Financial terms of the 20-year agreement, which Constellation called its largest ever, weren't disclosed.

 "Powering industries critical to our nation's global economic and technological competitiveness, including data
centers, requires an abundance of energy that is carbon-free and reliable every hour of every day, and nuclear
plants are the only energy sources that can consistently deliver on that promise," said Constellation CEO Joe
Dominguez in a press release.

Clean energy advocates and businesses alike are looking towards nuclear energy as a source of zero-carbon
power that is a reliable baseload source. A big pro is that nuclear is able to stay on at all times of the day and night,
unlike wind and solar.

However, nuclear has drawn criticism for environmental groups for decades for its waste. The US still has no
permanent repository for that waste, instead storing it at over 70 operating and shuttered plants around the nation.

Reopening of the Unit 1 reactor will add 3,400 direct and indirect jobs and add more than 800 megawatts of
electricity to the grid, according to Constellation. It's also expected to add $16 billion to Pennsylvania's GDP, where
the plant is located.

Shares of Constellation (CEG) soared more than 16% in midday trading.

Three Mile Island, located near Harrisburg, is best known for being the most serious accident at a commercial
nuclear power plant in US history when it experienced the partial meltdown of one of its two reactors. Unit 2 reactor,
which is adjacent to Unit 1, has remained closed since 1979 following the disaster.

The deal is enabled by President Joe Biden's climate bill, which contains billions in tax credits to incentivize clean
energy from nuclear in addition to wind, solar and clean hydrogen. The Biden administration and Congress have
also poured billions into funding to stop old plants slated for closure from shutting down.

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3
                           Three Mile Island is reopening and selling its power to Microsoft

In the US "there's not a lot of historical precedent on regulatory approval" to restart a shuttered plant, said Alan
Ahn, deputy director for nuclear at think tank Third Way's climate and energy program.

Regulators and companies are working to re-power the Palisades nuclear plant in Michigan, which was destined for
closure until the federal government stepped in with over $1 billion to save it. Three Mile Island has been
mothballed for several years longer, Ahn added.

But as tech giants search for more sources of power to fuel their AI needs, Ahn said companies are increasingly
taking a hard look at nuclear energy, which is carbon-free and helps them maintain their lofty climate goals.

"When you're talking about expanded power needs from artificial intelligence, data centers needing to run
basically at full capacity for 24 hours a day.There's not a lot of alternatives outside of nuclear," Ahn said. "It's
becoming a fairly clear that the tech companies are really intently looking at nuclear."

"This agreement is a major milestone in Microsoft's efforts to help decarbonize the grid in support of our
commitment to become carbon negative," Bobby Hollis, vice president of energy for Microsoft, said in the release.

The following information was released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO):

The science is clear. We are far off track from achieving vital climate goals. The impacts of climate change and
hazardous weather are reversing development gains and threatening the well-being of people and the planet,
according to a new multi-agency report coordinated by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO).

Key messages

Multi-agency report highlights challenges and opportunities

Summit of the Future decisions: a choice between breakthrough or breakdown

Increasing climate change impacts reverse development gains

Gap between aspiration and reality widens

New technologies and innovation are potential game-changers

Natural and social sciences are part of wider transdisciplinary approach

Greenhouse gas concentrations are at record levels, fuelling temperature increase into the future. The emissions
gap between aspiration and reality remains high. Under current policies, there is a two thirds likelihood of global
warming of 3 C this century, says the United in Science report.

United in Science offers much-needed grounds for hope. It explores how advances in natural and social sciences,
new technologies and innovation enhance our understanding of the Earth system and could be game changers for
climate change adaptation, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development.

"We need urgent and ambitious action now to support sustainable development, climate action and disaster risk
reduction. The decisions we make today could be the difference between a future breakdown or a breakthrough to
a better world," said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.

"Artificial Intelligence and machine learning have emerged as potentially transformative technologies that are
revolutionizing weather forecasting and can make it faster, cheaper and more accessible. Cutting-edge satellite

                                                                                                       Page 2 of 5
                                UNITED IN SCIENCE: REBOOT CLIMATE ACTION

technologies and virtual realities that bridge the physical and digital worlds are opening new frontiers in, for
instance, land and water management," said Celeste Saulo.

"However, science and technology alone are not enough to address global challenges such as climate change and
sustainable development alone. In an increasingly complex world, we must embrace diverse knowledge,
experiences and perspectives to co-create solutions together," she said.

The United Nations Summit of the Future provides a once-in-a-generation opportunity to revitalize and reboot our
collective commitment to the global goals, says the report, which was compiled by a consortium of United Nations
agencies, meteorological organizations and scientific and research bodies. It also embraces input from young
people and early career scientists who are agents of change for the future.

State of climate science: the need for urgent and ambitious climate action

Human-caused climate change has resulted in widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean,
cryosphere and biosphere. The year 2023 was the warmest on record by a large margin, with widespread extreme
weather. This trend continued in the first half of 2024.

Global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions rose by 1.2% from 2021 to 2022, reaching 57.4 billion tons of carbon
dioxide (CO2) equivalent. Globally averaged surface concentrations of CO2, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide
(N2O) also reached new highs.

When the Paris Agreement was adopted, greenhouse gas emissions were projected to increase by 16% by 2030
relative to 2015. Now, that projected increase is 3%, indicating progress has been made. Yet the emissions gap for
2030 remains high. To limit global warming to below 2 C and 1.5 C (above the pre-industrial era), global GHG
emissions in 2030 must be reduced by 28% and 42%, respectively, from the levels projected from current policies.

With existing policies and Nationally Determined Contributions (which present national efforts to limit global
warming to well below 2 C), it is estimated that global warming will be kept to a maximum of 3 C throughout the
century. Only in the most optimistic scenario where all conditional NDCs and net-zero pledges are fully achieved, s
global warming projected to be limited to 2 C, with just a 14% chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 C.

There is an 80% chance that the global mean near-surface temperature in at least one of the next five calendar
years will exceed 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, and a 47% chance that the 2024-2028 five-year mean will
exceed this threshold. The Paris Agreement threshold of 1.5 C refers to long-term warming averaged over 20 years.

Urgent mitigation action is needed, as is climate adaptation.

However, one out of six countries still lack a national adaptation planning instrument, and a significant finance gap
remains, with the flow of international public adaptation finance declining since 2020.

Artificial intelligence and Machine Learning: revolutionizing weather forecasting

Thanks to rapid progress, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can make skillful weather
modelling faster, cheaper and more accessible to lower-income countries with limited computational capacities.

Traditionally, weather forecasting relies on physics-based models through a process known as numerical weather
prediction. AI/ML models are trained on reanalysis and observational datasets, making weather forecasting faster
and cheaper. Some evaluations have shown the potential of AI/ML for forecasting hazardous events such as
tropical cyclones and longer-term predictions of El Nio and La Nia.

There are tremendous opportunities but also many challenges, particularly limited data quality and availability.
Current AI/ML models do not include harder-to-predict variables related to the ocean, land, cryosphere and carbon
cycle.

                                                                                                         Page 3 of 5
                                UNITED IN SCIENCE: REBOOT CLIMATE ACTION

Strong global governance is needed to ensure AI/ML serves the global good. Enhanced transparency will be
important for building trust and developing standards for responsible use.

Space-based Earth observations

Incredible advancements in recent decades in space-based Earth observations offer vast opportunities for the
future.

High-resolution and high-frequency observations of the Earth system are crucial for effective weather forecasting,
climate prediction and environmental monitoring.

By leveraging publicprivate partnerships, innovations in space-based Earth observations can be used to enhance
weather, climate, water and related environmental applications.

However, big challenges limit the realization of the full potential of space-based Earth observations in support of
global goals. Gaps remain in accurately measuring critical ocean, climate, aerosol and hydrological variables and in
covering sparsely observed areas such as the cryosphere.

Additionally, data accessibility and standardization are a problem, particularly for developing countries.

International collaboration, comprehensive governance frameworks for integrated observing systems and innovative
financing models are needed to support space-based Earth observation for weather, climate, water and related
environmental applications.

Bridging virtual and physical realms: leveraging immersive technologies for water and land management

Socioeconomic impacts and climate change are straining water and land resources, threatening food and water
security. Immersive technologies such as digital twins, virtual reality and the metaverse can revolutionize integrated
land and water management by offering interactive and data-driven solutions that bridge the physical and digital
worlds. From simulating flood and drought events to predicting water flow and accumulation, as well as land
degradation, they enhance decision-making and the engagement of diverse actors.

Digital twins are defined as a virtual representation designed to accurately reflect a physical object or system. The
metaverse is an integrative ecosystem of virtual worlds that provides immersive experiences.

Challenges include limitations in data availability and quality. There is insufficient access to sustainable funding
mechanisms, effective governance frameworks, and lack of public trust and understanding.

International cooperation, knowledge sharing and robust multilateral frameworks are crucial for adopting these
innovative solutions.

Towards pathways to sustainable futures: the role of transdisciplinary approaches

Global challenges such as climate change, disaster risk reduction and sustainable development cannot be
addressed by one form of knowledge alone they require a transdisciplinary approach that unites actors across
environmental, social and cultural contexts to co-create and implement solutions.

Conventional approaches often focus on understanding the dimensions of natural and social sciences, policy and
society separately.

A transdisciplinary approach brings together diverse actors, such as scientists, policymakers, practitioners and civil
society, including local and Indigenous communities, to co-create knowledge and develop solutions that are
relevant to local contexts. It differs from a multidisciplinary approach, where experts from different disciplines work
on the same issue separately.

For instance, engaging scientists, policymakers, practitioners and local and Indigenous communities from the outset
enriches understanding of climate change impacts on the ground and offers a more complete perspective.

                                                                                                        Page 4 of 5
                                UNITED IN SCIENCE: REBOOT CLIMATE ACTION

It also strengthens trust in institutions such as National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs).

A future where everyone is protected by life-saving early warning systems

Multi-hazard early warning systems (MHEWS) are critical for protecting lives, livelihoods and the environment.
Evidence shows that disaster-related mortality in countries with limited to moderate MHEWS coverage is nearly six
times higher than those with substantial to comprehensive coverage.

Progress has been made and more than half of the world's countries now report having MHEWS. But significant
gaps remain.

The Early Warnings for All (EW4All) initiative aims to ensure everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous
weather, water, and climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. The initiative
underscored the importance of embracing natural and social sciences, technological advances and transdisciplinary
approaches.

To scale up action on EW4All across stakeholders, innovation in science, technology and tools such as artificial
intelligence (AI), multi-channel and digital communication platforms and citizen science will be pivotal. By
harnessing these advancements and ensuring they are backed by adequate resources, we can make game-
changing advancements to ensure that Early Warnings for All becomes a reality for communities all over the world.

Planet Labs PBC (NYSE: PL), a leading provider of daily data and insights about Earth, showcased major
customers and partners from across Central and South America yesterday at their " Planet On The Road "
conference series, hosted in Bogotá, Colombia. Speakers at the in-person event included data and artificial
intelligence experts and government leaders from Brazil, Colombia, and Bolivia, who focused on how satellite data
was being used across Latin America for sustainable development, law enforcement, disaster response, and
Amazon forest protection.

Planet provides their customers and partners with satellite datasets and analysis feeds, helping to conduct broad
area management and quantify changing conditions on the surface of the Earth. At the Bogotá event, Planet
President and CFO, Ashley Johnson expanded on these capabilities, highlighting the company's newly launched
Planet Insights Platform and shared, "Our daily global scan can help authorities improve situational awareness,
allocate resources during complex incidents that occur over large areas, understand flood risks in burned areas,
and plan long-term recovery operations."

Planet has experienced business momentum in Latin America over the last year and by working with partners in the
region, valuable insights and novel workflows have emerged for governments and businesses in the region. "Our
community is uniquely equipped to harness the power of space data and AI technologies to see the signal in the
noise, to modernize and digitize our workflows, use transparency to promote peace and security and to accelerate
the transition toward a sustainable economy," said Robbie Schingler, Planet Co-founder and CSO in his keynote
address at the event.

Planet customers and partners took to the stage for the day to share how this satellite data provides solutions to
challenges specific to the region. Representatives from INRA , Bolivia's land management agency, discussed how
they worked in collaboration with Planet and Planet partner CIVIS to modernize their approach to land
management. Aiming to balance sustainability, food sovereignty, and national development, INRA leveraged the
Planet Insights Platform to gain near real-time insights and streamline management for monitoring for carbon
emissions compliance and land use and titling, establishing ambitious sustainable targets across the nation.

In a keynote, alongside INRA, Planet customer Instituto Geográfico Agustín Codazzi (IGAC), a Colombian
government entity responsible for managing cartographic data, shared how they provide access to users
PlanetScope and Planet Basemaps covering the entire Colombian territory. Through their platform, Observatorio de
la Tierra y el Territorio (OTT), organizations are able to conduct efficient land-use planning and territorial
management. With data analysis and AI, the platform aims to offer capabilities for monitoring infrastructure change
and detect anthropogenic changes to the environment.

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 4

                                          Civil Government Initiatives

In a fireside chat hosted by Robbie Schingler, Planet's co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer, and Guillermo
Ocampo, Microsoft's National Digital Transformation Officer, the industry leaders discussed how artificial
intelligence and satellite imagery have been transforming biodiversity protection in South America, helping to
inform scientists and raise public awareness. Microsoft's Project Guacamaya , for instance, runs AI-enabled
analyses on top of Planet satellite imagery of biodiverse regions to swiftly detect ecosystem changes, potentially
caused by deforestation or mining.

Planet partner Procalculo spoke about their collaborative work with organizations across Colombia to provide
geospatial insights derived from Planet satellite data in areas, such as risk management and disaster response. At
the event, Procalculo shared how they used deep learning models on top of Planet data to evaluate yearly drought
impacts and risks, wildfire threat zones, and mapping roads for disaster management. They also spoke with the
Head of Space Production Area for the Airforce of Colombia about how Planet data offers the capabilities of broad
area management for the Amazon, enabling authorities to combat illegal deforestation.

Representatives across the Brazil MAIS program shared how Planet data has enabled the success and expansion
of the program, working to protect the Brazilian Amazon in collaboration with the Federal Police of Brazil, the
Ministry of Justice and Public Security of Brazil, and Planet partner SCCON Geospatial . Leveraging Planet satellite
data, SCCON supports a change detection alert system on their platform, making near real-time information
regarding illicit activities, such as deforestation and illegal mining accessible to Brazilian government agencies. The
Federal Police of Brazil have been able to implement justice across the country, protecting the Amazon rainforest
and enhancing their law enforcement operations. With Planet satellite data and SCCON's automated change
detection, the project collected over $3 billion from fines, seized goods, and the freezing of assets since 2020.

The Planet On the Road Bogotá event also hosted a myriad of leaders leveraging Planet satellite data across the
Latin American agricultural industry and disaster response. In the digital farming arena, customers and partners
speaking included Disargo, a leading supplier of fertilizers originating from Guatemala, Auravant, an Argentina-
based digital agricultural monitoring system, and Oryzatvia, which integrates Planet data into their digital platform to
support rice farming in Uruguay. Focusing on how AI and machine learning can transform proactive disaster
response, Planet customers and partners EPM and Procaculo from Colombia, and Chile-based Raster4 shared
how satellite data and emerging technologies are supporting all stages of disaster life cycle management, including
prevention, response, and recovery.

ITU's first standardization governing conference in Asia will set the course for innovation and cooperation

Key Events

Geneva, 10 September 2024

ITU-GS-MR-MainContent

Policy-makers and industry leaders will consider priorities for international standards to support industry growth,
innovation, and trust in new technologies at ITU's World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA),
taking place from 15 to 24 October at New Delhi's Pragati Maidan conference and exhibition centre.

Standards from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) support cost-effective, interoperable
advancements in technology at a global scale. By capturing and creating a basis for continuous innovation,
standards provide the foundation for new industries to grow and established industries to evolve.

Organized every four years, WTSA is the governing conference for the standardization work of ITU, the United
Nations Agency for Digital Technologies.

"Standards are taking centre stage in global governance discussions," said Doreen Bogdan-Martin, ITU Secretary-
General. "When countries gather in New Delhi for WTSA-24, they will have an opportunity to foster digital inclusion
and trust values that are more important than ever to ensure that innovation in fields like artificial intelligence, the
metaverse, and quantum information technologies helps us create the future we want."

ITU's standardization work is driven by the contributions and consensus decisions of ITU's membership, including
193 Member States and over 1000 member companies, universities, and international and regional organizations.

WTSA directs the agency's activities on standards and reviews the strategy, structure, and working methods of
ITU's standardization arm (ITU-T). The conference also approves the mandates and appoints the leadership teams
of ITU-T expert groups for international standardization.

                                                                            Page 2 of 4

Director of ITU's Telecommunication Standardization Bureau. "With every breakthrough in science and technology
comes wider transformation, and we must keep coming together to develop the standards required for people and
economies to thrive while pushing new frontiers. That's what our standardization processes are built for."

WTSA-24 will be the first meeting of ITU's governing conference on standards to take place in Asia. In parallel, the
exhibition centre will host a digital innovation festival showcasing the latest tech developments from India and the
world.

"Our philosophy of Atithi Devo Bhava(Guest is akin to God)drives us to welcome the world's telecomleaderstoour
national capital,New Delhi, for WTSA-24," said Neeraj Mittal, Secretary of the Department of Telecommunications,
Ministry of Communications, Government of India. "We are confidentthisassembly will set new benchmarks in
standardization to drive sustainable growth in information and communication technologies."

The proceedings will begin on World Standards Day, 14 October, with the ITU Global Standards Symposium (GSS)
exploring innovations in areas from artificial intelligence (AI) and the metaverse to secure digital finance and
smart cities.

GSS-24, also taking place at New Delhi's Pragati Maidan, will include a high-level segment welcoming ministers
and industry executives to discuss digital transformation ambitions and associated standardization demands.

The symposium will submit recommended actions for ITU's membership at WTSA-24.

GSS will also feature the inaugural session of ITU's newInternational AI Standards Summit, aimed at ensuring
comprehensive standards for the fast-evolving AI landscape and intended to become a staple of ITU's annual AI for
Good Global Summit series.

"I lookforwardtocollaborative, constructive and collective effortsasthe world'sinformation and communication
technology leaderscome together in New Delhifor WTSA-24," said Ritu Ranjan Mittar, Chair Designate for WTSA-
24.

What else is happening during WTSA-24?

The Network of Women in ITU standardization will hold special sessions during WTSA-24 on women's leadership in
the digital tech industry and supporting technical standardization processes.

Tech innovation in India will be on show at AI for Good Impact India, the first regional event under the umbrella of
ITU's new AI for Good Impact Initiative, which aims to expand the scope and impact of AI applications for
sustainable development.

A Robotics for Good Youth Challenge, held as part of AI for Good Impact India, will welcome teams of young Indian
innovators to compete for prizes and global recognition for robotics solutions supporting disaster response.

Industry solutions and academic research on display

Alongside ITU's global conference, the WTSA Expo will demonstrate the latest industry solutions built to ITU
standards. Companies from developing countries, particularly small and medium-sized sized enterprises (SMEs),

The following information was released by the California Hospital Association (CHA):

Heading into the second half of 2024, there are several exciting educational opportunities from CHA that you and
your teams depending on their area of responsibility and interest would benefit from attending.

Disaster Planning On Sept. 10 and Sept. 11, CHA will host its annual disaster planning conference in Pasadena.
This year's agenda highlights health care case studies from various disasters, including lessons learned on
vulnerability assessments and business continuity planning from those who have lived through the worst of it all.
Breakout sessions enable attendees to drill down on specific topics, such as cybersecurity, after-action reporting,
surge planning, and more.

Volunteers On Sept. 16 and Sept. 17, the California Hospital Volunteer Leadership Conference, in its 61st year, will
be held in San Diego. With so many hospitals relying on volunteers for ancillary services, patient support, and more,
gatherings like these are key to reinvigorate volunteer programs and learn from peers about strategies to retain and
recruit the next generation of these essential members of hospital teams.

Quality and Safety On Oct. 20 and Oct. 21, the Hospital Quality Institute's annual conference in Lake Tahoe will
focus on how new technology is driving change in the patient safety movement. Artificial intelligence (AI) could
help health care workers diagnose conditions earlier, bridge language barriers, revolutionize telehealth and
discharge experiences, and more. It also raises equity and ethics questions. Keynote speakers include Gurpreet
Dhaliwal, MD, UCSF clinician/national expert on AI in health care; Diana Nyad, international long-distance
swimming champion/hall of famer; and Stephen Shedletzky, Author of Speak-Up Culture: When Leaders Truly
Listen, People Step Up.

Behavioral Health On Dec. 4 and Dec. 5, CHA's annual behavioral health care symposium will be held in Long
Beach with significant attention on behavioral health care and California's youth population. The agenda is still
being developed, but registration is open now.

Along with the amazing content being offered at each of these opportunities, there is really no way to quantify the
value of being among peers and having the chance to share, learn, and laugh with each other. Hope we will see
many of you soon.

                                                                            Page 2 of 2

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued the following news release:

DHS Will Launch Three Pilot Projects to Test AI Technology to Enhance Immigration Officer Training, Help
Communities Build Resilience and Reduce Burden for Applying for Disaster Relief Grants, and Improve Efficiency
of Law Enforcement Investigations

Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Chief Information Officer and Chief Artificial
Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen announced the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) first "Artificial
Intelligence Roadmap." The roadmap details DHS's 2024 plans, including to test uses of the technologies that
deliver meaningful benefits to the American public and advance homeland security, while ensuring that individuals'
privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected.

As part of the roadmap, DHS announced three innovative pilot projects that will deploy AI in specific mission areas.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will test AI to enhance investigative processes focused on detecting
fentanyl and increasing efficiency of investigations related to combatting child sexual exploitation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will deploy AI to help communities plan for and develop hazard mitigation
plans to build resilience and minimize risks. And, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will
use AI to improve immigration officer training.

"The unprecedented speed and potential of AI's development and adoption presents both enormous opportunities
to advance our mission and risks we must mitigate," said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.
"The DHS AI roadmap and pilots will guide our efforts this year to strengthen our national security, improve our
operations, and provide more efficient services to the American people, while upholding our commitment to protect
civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. What we learn from the pilot projects will be beneficial in shaping how the
Department can effectively and responsibly use AI across the homeland security enterprise moving forward."

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4
       Department of Homeland Security Unveils Artificial Intelligence Roadmap, Announces Pilot Projects to
                       Maximize Benefits of Technology, Advance Homeland Security ....

The roadmap lays out DHS's initiatives in AI, describes the potential of AI technologies across the Department, and
offers clearer visibility into the Department's approach to AI, while underscoring the Department's commitment to
responsible utilization.

The AI roadmap outlines three lines of effort DHS is using to guide its work:

Responsibly leverage AI to advance Homeland Security missions while protecting individuals' privacy, civil rights,
and civil liberties - DHS is committed to ensuring that its use of AI fully respects privacy, civil liberties, and civil
rights, is rigorously tested to avoid bias, disparate impact, privacy harms, and other risks, and that it is
understandable to the people we serve.

Promote Nationwide AI Safety and Security - Advances in AI will revolutionize the delivery of essential goods and
services upon which Americans rely. AI can create tremendous efficiencies and benefits for citizens, but it can also
present new and novel risks. To protect U.S. cyber networks and critical infrastructure, DHS will help govern the
safe and responsible development and use of AI.

Continue to lead in AI through strong cohesive partnerships - DHS will foster strong relationships with private
sector, academia, State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal governments, international partners, non-government
organizations, research institutions, and thought leaders to accelerate the development and deployment of AI
solutions tailored to the unique challenges faced by the DHS. In line with the DHS's commitment to transparency
and visibility into the Department's vision for AI and to ensuring responsible use, DHS will continue to share
information and engage with communities, advocates, and partners to demonstrate responsible AI use.

DHS's three new pilot programs will allow the Department to assess the efficacy of AI in improving its mission
capabilities. Each pilot team is partnering with privacy, cybersecurity, and civil rights and civil liberties experts
throughout their development and evaluation process. This work will inform Department-wide policies on AI
governance. DHS offices and agencies submitted dozens of proposals for consideration to the Chief AI Officer, who
selected three pilots that would best support evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLM) and
Generative AI technology at DHS.

The new pilot programs announced today will:

Transform Security Investigative Processes, Unlock Data-Driven Insights, and Improve Mission Outcomes - HSI's
pilot project will strengthen their investigative processes by introducing a LLM-based system designed to enhance
the efficiency and accuracy of summaries investigators rely upon. The LLM-based system will leverage open-
source technologies to allow investigators to more quickly summarize and search for contextually relevant
information within investigative reports. The pilot could lead to increases in detection of fentanyl-related networks,
aid in identification of perpetrators and victims of child exploitation crimes, and surface key patterns and trends that
could further HSI's vital work.

Bolster Planning Assistance for Resilient Communities - FEMA will launch a GenAI pilot to create efficiencies for the
hazard mitigation planning process for local governments, including underserved communities. Hazard mitigation
plans are not only a foundational step that communities can take to build their resilience but can be lengthy to
produce and challenging for communities that lack resources to do so. The pilot will specifically support State,
Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments' understanding of how to craft a plan that identifies risks and mitigation
strategies as well as generate draft plan elements--from publicly-available, well-researched sources -- that
governments could customize to meet their needs. This pilot could lead to more communities having the ability to
submit grant applications for funding to become more resilient and reduce disaster risks.

Enhance Immigration Officer Training through Generative AI - United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
is developing an interactive application that uses GenAI to improve the way the agency trains immigration officer
personnel. USCIS will generate dynamic, personalized training materials that adapt to officers' specific needs and
ensure the best possible knowledge and training on a wide range of current policies and laws relevant to their jobs.

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 4
      Department of Homeland Security Unveils Artificial Intelligence Roadmap, Announces Pilot Projects to
                      Maximize Benefits of Technology, Advance Homeland Security ....

The goal is to help enhance trainees' understanding and retention of crucial information, increase the accuracy of
their decisionmaking process, and limit the need for retraining over time.

The roadmap and announcement of pilot programs are the latest in the Department's ongoing AI initiatives.

In February, Secretary Mayorkas and CIO Hysen announced the Department's first-ever hiring sprint to recruit 50
AI technology experts to help build teams that will help better leverage AI responsibly across strategic areas of the
homeland security enterprise. These include efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and abuse,
deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity. DHS
has received a strong response to date and is in the process of reviewing. interviewing, and hiring AI technologists
to support mission-enhancing initiatives. The Department continues to accept applications on dhs.gov/AI.

Last year, DHS established the Department's first AI Task Force and named CIO Hysen its first Chief AI Officer.
Informed by the Task Force's work over the past 11 months, DHS has identified areas where AI can enhance the
effectiveness of the Department's efforts -- helping pave the way for this roadmap and these new projects. The
Task Force's focus is on DHS's entire mission space. For instance, it is working to enhance the integrity of our
supply chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to improve cargo screening, the identification
of imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management. The Task Force is also charged with using AI
to better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of precursor chemicals around the world, and
disrupt key nodes in criminal networks.

The Department's latest efforts follow President Biden's Executive Order (EO) "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence," signed in October2023. The EO directed DHS to promote the
adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI
can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the
United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions. The President has directed DHS to establish
an AI Safety and Security Advisory Board to support the responsible development of AI. This Board will bring
together preeminent industry experts from AI hardware and software companies, leading research labs, critical
infrastructure entities, and the U.S. government. This Board will issue recommendations and best practices for an
array of AI use cases to ensure AI deployments are secure and resilient.

The Joint Economic Committee released the following testimony by Adam Thierer, a senior fellow at the R Street
Institute, from a hearing dated June 4, 2024, entitled "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
Growth and Improve Governance":

***

Chairman Heinrich, Vice Chairman Schweikert, and members of the Committee:

Thank you for the invitation to participate in this important hearing on "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to
Fuel Economic Growth and Improve Governance." My name is Adam Thierer, and I am a senior fellow at the R
Street Institute, where I focus on emerging technology issues. I also recently served as a commissioner on the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce's Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competitiveness, Inclusion, and Innovation.1

Today I will discuss three points relevant to this hearing:

1. First, AI and advanced computational technologies can help fuel broad-based economic growth and sectoral
productivity while also improving consumer health and welfare in important ways.

2. Second, to unlock these benefits, the United States needs to pursue a pro-innovation AI policy vision that can
also help bolster our global competitive advantage and geopolitical security.

3. Third, we can advance these goals through an AI Opportunity Agenda that includes a learning period moratorium
on burdensome new AI regulations.

I will address each point briefly, but I have included three appendices to my testimony offering more details.

AI Could Drive Economic Growth, Increase Sectoral Productivity, and Improve Human Well-Being

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 19
      Joint Economic Committee Issues Testimony From R Street Institute Senior Fellow Thierer (Part 1 of 2)

AI is set to become the "most important general-purpose technology of our era," and AI could revolutionize every
segment of the economy in some fashion.2 The potential exists for AI to drive explosive economic growth and
productivity enhancements.3 While predictions vary, analysts forecast that AI could deliver trillions in additional
global economic activity and significantly boost annual GDP growth.4

This would be over and above the $4 trillion of gross output that the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says the
U.S. digital economy already accounted for in 2022.5 [See Appendix I] But what really matters is what AI means for
every American personally. AI is poised to revolutionize health outcomes, in particular. AI is already helping with
early detection and treatment of cancers, strokes, heart disease, brain disease, sepsis, and other ailments. AI is
also helping address organ failure, paralysis, vision impairments, and much more. The age of personalized
medicine will be driven by AI advancement. [See Appendix 2] AI can help make government more efficient, too.6
Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted recently used an AI tool to help sift through the state's code of regulations and eliminate
2.2 million words' worth of unnecessary and outdated regulations.7 California Gov. Gavin Newsom just announced
an effort to use generative AI tools to improve public services and cut 8 percent from the state's government
operations budget.8 And regulators are using AI to facilitate compliance with existing policies, such as post-market
medical device surveillance.9 AI also holds the potential to achieve administrative savings for federal health
insurance programs or, better yet, reduce the number of people dependent on them by identifying and treating
ailments earlier.10

Computational Freedom Is Important for America's Geopolitical Competitiveness and Security

There is an important connection between AI and broader national objectives. A strong technology base is a key
source of strength and prosperity, so it is essential that we do not undermine innovation and investment as the next
great technological race gets underway with China and the rest of the world.11 Luckily, U.S. AI innovators are still
in the lead. Had a Chinese operator launched a major generative AI model first, it would have been a "Sputnik
moment" for America. Still, China has made its imperial ambitions clear with a goal to become the global leader in
advanced computation by 2030, and it has considerable talent, data, and resources to power those ambitions.12
Experts argue that "China's whole-of-society approach is challenging America's traditional advantages" in advanced
technology.13 We need a pro-innovation national AI policy that will not only strengthen our economy and provide
better products and jobs, but also bolster national security and allow our values of pluralism, personal liberty,
individual rights, and free speech to shape global information platforms and markets.14 If fear-based policies
impede America's AI development and diffusion, then China wins.15

Protect the Freedom to Innovate with an "AI Opportunity Agenda"

                                                                                                 Page 4 of 19
      Joint Economic Committee Issues Testimony From R Street Institute Senior Fellow Thierer (Part 1 of 2)

To achieve the benefits AI offers and meet the rising global competition, America needs an AI Opportunity Agenda.

An AI Opportunity Agenda begins by reiterating that the freedom to innovate is the cornerstone of American
technology policy and the key to unlocking the enormous potential of our nation's entrepreneurs and workers.16 As
part of this Agenda, Congress should craft a learning period moratorium on new proposals, such as new AI-specific
bureaucracies, licensing systems, or liability schemes, all of which would be counterproductive and undermine our
nation's computational capabilities. [See Enclosure I] In addition, this moratorium should preempt burdensome state
and local regulatory enactments that conflict with our national AI policy framework.17

Next, Congress should require our government's existing 439 federal departments to evaluate their current policies
toward AI systems with two purposes in mind. First, to ensure that they are not over-burdening algorithmic systems
with outdated policies, and second, to determine how existing rules and regulations are capable of addressing the
concerns that some have raised about AI. Taking inventory of existing rules and regulations can then allow
policymakers to identify any gaps that Congress ought to address using targeted remedies.

Finally, an AI Opportunity Agenda requires an openness to new talent and competition.18 With experts finding that
a "talent war is brewing between the US and China," and that China is moving ahead in some important ways, we
must take steps to attract and retain the world's best and brightest data scientists and computer engineers.19

Conclusion

In sum, America's AI policy should be rooted in patience and humility instead of a rush to over-regulate based on
hypotheticals and worst-case thinking.20 We are still very early in the AI lifecycle, and there is still no consensus on
how to define the term, let alone legislate beyond establishing definitions.21 To ensure America leads this next
great technological revolution, Congress must once again uphold the freedom to innovate and craft a flexible, risk-
based AI policy vision to ensure we can meet global competition, advance economic opportunity, and improve the
well-being of every citizen.

Appendix 1: How AI Could Drive Economic Growth and Sectoral Productivity

Over the past half century, there have been waves of both great excitement and disillusionment about the prospects
for AI advancement.22 AI historians often speak of the many AI "springs" and "winters"--what one might think of as
AI booms and busts--that have come and gone.23 It did not help that some of AI's early pioneers over-exuberantly
predicted that powerful "superintelligence" would be with us in short order. In the late 1960s, for example, noted AI
researchers confidentially predicted that "machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man
can do," (Herbert A. Simon), and that "[i]n from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general
intelligence of an average human being" (Marvin Minsky).24 Such exuberance was replaced by pessimism in the
1970s, resulting in a "winter" period for AI research and investment.

Today, however, AI is generally thought to be in the midst of another spring as enthusiasm grows around specific
capabilities and applications. Economists predict that AI is set to become the "most important general-purpose
technology of our era."25 General-purpose technologies will become intertwined with almost every other economic
sector and used ubiquitously throughout society.26 These developments are coming about because we live in an
era of rapid-fire combinatorial innovation in which new technologies are building on top of one another in a
symbiotic fashion, further accelerating their development and sophistication.27 Improving Many Sectors, Including
Government

The power of algorithmic technologies is all around us in products and services such as speech and image
recognition tools on our smartphones and the recommender systems many media providers and other companies
use to tailor goods, services, and content to our interests. AI will be used by almost all organizations to help
improve analytics and marketing, enhance customer service, and boost sales or performance in various new ways.
And it will completely upend the way production and work is done in countless fields and professions.

AI and ML capabilities are operating behind the scenes to help with fraud and spam detection, computer virus
filtering, content management/moderation,28 mapping/navigation,29 travel planning,30 weather forecasting and
natural disaster prediction,31 warehouse automation/inventory management,32 supply chain management,33 and
various other logistics.34 For example, in 2021, McKinsey & Company estimated that "[s]uccessfully implementing
AI-enabled supply-chain management has enabled early adopters to improve logistics costs by 15 percent,
inventory levels by 35 percent, and service levels by 65 percent, compared with slower- moving competitors."35
These productivity enhancements will likely accelerate as algorithmic techniques are further refined.

AI and ML capabilities also power most of the devices that make up the so-called Internet of Things and various
connected "smart" devices, including many wearable technologies and other devices with embedded sensors.36
Another related term here is ambient computing37 or ubiquitous computing, which essentially means "using
computers without knowing that you are using one," or using smart systems without explicitly calling them
computers.38 These technologies have powerful health and medical applications, among other things.

Meanwhile, various AI-powered robotic technologies are already at work in many industrial sectors.39 AI, ML, and
advanced robotics technologies promise to revolutionize many fields including advertising and marketing,40
agriculture,41 archeology,42 auto safety,43 aviation,44 education,45 endangered species protection,46 energy and
climate solutions,47 entertainment,48 financial services,49 legal services,50 retail,51 transportation,52 and

AI will affect government processes, too.54 In April 2024, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted used an AI tool to help sift
through the state's code of regulations and eliminate 2.2 million words' worth of unnecessary and outdated
regulations.55 In May 2024, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an effort to use generative AI tools to
improve public services and cut 8 percent from the state's government operations budget.56 AI is also being used
by regulators to facilitate compliance with existing policies. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has been using AI for post-market medical device surveillance.57

The potential exists for AI to drive explosive economic growth and productivity enhancements.58 While predictions
vary, most analysts believe that "AI will have a significant economic impact."59

* According to Grand View Research, a market research and consulting company based in India and the United
States, the global AI market was valued at $93.5 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual
growth rate of 38.1 percent from 2022 to 2030./60

* A 2018 McKinsey study estimated that "AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic activity of around
$13 trillion by 2030, or about 16 percent higher cumulative GDP compared with today. This amounts to 1.2 percent
additional GDP growth per year."61 In the summer of 2023, McKinsey released another study estimating that
generative AI alone could add up to $4.4 trillion of value to the global economy annually.62

* An earlier PwC report forecast a $15.7 trillion potential contribution to the global economy by 2030./63

* A 2023 Goldman Sachs report predicted AI could help boost U.S. labor productivity by 1.5 percentage points each
year, while Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates AI will add an additional 1.0 percentage points
to productivity growth over the 2025-2028 timeframe.64 Goldman also says generative AI could drive a 7 percent
(or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP over a 10-year period.65

* Another leading economist with a specialization in technology argues that AI will double productivity in the coming
decade.66

Even if AI's economic impact falls far short of those estimates, it would still generate enormous growth opportunities
across many segments of the economy. AI is also invigorating new types of tech competition, especially from open-
source players and platforms.67 It also promises to benefit small businesses by creating new products and jobs. A

U.S. Chamber of Commerce report finds that 87 percent of small businesses reported increased efficiency due to
new technology platforms and that one in four small businesses are already using AI.68 The Past Can Be Prologue

If this potential for explosive growth still sounds outlandish, consider that, in 1998, Nobel Prize-winning economist
Paul Krugman infamously predicted that the internet's impact on the global economy would be "no greater than the
fax machine's."69 President Bill Clinton thought differently, predicting that the internet's potential was "nothing short
of revolutionary" and that "[i]n just a few years, it will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and
services."70

Clinton's optimism was vindicated. Electronic commerce exploded, and digital innovation became the foundation of
significant economic growth, new jobs, and boundless speech opportunities. According to the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis, in 2022, the U.S. digital economy accounted for over $4 trillion of gross output, $2.6 trillion of
value added (translating to 10 percent of U.S. GDP), $1.3 trillion of compensation, and 8.9 million jobs.71 These
astonishing results came about thanks to wise bipartisan public policies formulated by the Clinton administration
and a Republican-led Congress.72 Freedom to innovate was America's policy default for digital services, and
burdensome state regulations (and even taxes) were preempted to a degree.73 Federal policymakers made a firm
break with the old regulatory models of the analog era, which had constrained competition. The results speak for
themselves. In addition to generating remarkable economic output and opportunity, this approach resulted in global

                                                                                                Page 11 of 19

dominance of digital technology markets. Today, 18 of the 25 largest digital companies in the world are U.S.-based,
and it is difficult to name any from Europe.74 In essence, as a recent Wall Street Journal headline observed, the
European Union now "regulates its way to last place" on digital technology.75

This should serve as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers. America got policy right for the internet, but the sort of
approach adopted for AI remains to be seen. If we want U.S. firms to once again lead the world--and help counter
China's looming influence on AI markets in particular--it is essential for policymakers to strike the right policy
balance once again.76

Appendix 2: AI's Potential for Improving Medicine and Health Outcomes

AI is already revolutionizing the field of healthcare and the practice of medicine.77 Increasingly powerful algorithmic
systems--often combined with new wearable technologies--are already helping many people better monitor their
health and fitness.78 Generative AI tools will also supplement remote medicine with virtual health care
assistants.79 More sophisticated AI tools are allowing doctors and scientists to create highly personalized care
options and develop new medical treatments tailored to the unique needs of each patient.80 As two medical experts
and authors of The Age of Scientific Wellness have noted, "those who fold these systems into their practices will be
doing their patients (and themselves) a great service" because "they are akin to having not one expert but
thousands upon thousands, all working together at top speed. Because AI is generally inexpensive to run once it
has been developed, the potential for optimizing care and making it radically cheaper is striking."81 AI and ML-
enabled technologies are already having a profound impact on public health. Machine learning refers to the
processes by which a computer can train and improve an algorithm or computer model without step-by-step human
involvement.82 In 2022, for example, an AI technology from Google DeepMind called AlphaFold was able to model
the structure of nearly all known proteins, representing "a significant advance in biology that will accelerate drug
discovery and help address problems such as sustainability and food insecurity."83 Researchers from the
Fundamental AI Research Team at Meta have a competing ML-created database of 617 million predicted protein
structures.84 These advances are leading to what some researchers call a "protein design revolution" driving "the
next quantum leap in the biotech industry," which could completely transform medicine.85 This competition
continues, as DeepMind announced the latest and more powerful iteration of AlphaFold in April 2024./86

A Broad Range of Health Benefits

AI, ML, and robotics are driving many other major medical advances today, becoming a crucial part of early
detection of various ailments and diseases.87 "Artificial-intelligence algorithms are processing vast troves of data
in electronic medical records, searching for patterns to predict future outcomes and recommend treatments," notes
a Wall Street Journal medical reporter.88 "They are creating early-warning systems to help hospital staff spot subtle
but serious changes in a patient's condition that aren't always visible or noticed in a busy unit, and predicting which
patients about to be discharged from the hospital are at highest risk of being readmitted."89 Here are some other
specific examples of how AI, ML, and robotics technologies are already advancing medical science and helping
improve health outcomes.

* Organ donation: In the field of organ donations, "[p]aired kidney donation is one of the great success stories of
artificial intelligence," helping doctors and patients by taking "an incredibly complex problem and solves it faster
and with fewer errors than humans can, and saving more lives as a result."90

* Heart attack detection and treatment: AI and ML tools are helping detect and treat heart disease and heart
attacks, a leading cause of death globally.91 Scientists at Cedars-Sinai developed an algorithmic tool in 2022 that
can quantify coronary plaque buildup in five to six seconds compared to at least 25 to 30 minutes before.92 This will
greatly improve the ability to predict who will have a heart attack. Other researchers have developed AI tools to help
improve personalized treatment for women who have had heart attacks.93 Women who suffer a heart attack have a
higher mortality rate than men, often because their symptoms are not properly understood or diagnosed.
Meanwhile, the British National Health Service recently started using a new AI tool that can detect heart disease in
just 20 seconds while patients are in an MRI scanner, compared with the 13 minutes or more it usually takes
doctors to analyze images manually after performing a scan.94

* Cancers: President Richard Nixon declared a national "war on cancer" over 50 years ago.95 More recently, the
Obama and Biden administrations pushed for a "cancer moonshot."96 Unfortunately, cancers remain the second
leading causes of death in the United States,97 claiming 602,350 lives in 2020 alone.98 AI and ML-enabled
technologies are poised to help reduce that staggering death toll. Mayo Clinic researchers have shown how ML
models can help diagnose and treat pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage.99 Pancreatic cancer is the third leading
cause of cancer deaths, claiming 46,774 lives in 2020./100 British scientists have recently reported on new AI
software that can spot signs of pre-cancer during endoscopies in 92 percent of patients, which could significantly
lower deaths from esophageal cancer.101 AI/ML techniques are also helping with early fast, accurate way of
diagnosing heart attack," detection and treatment of lung cancer,102 breast cancer,103 brain cancer,104 cervical
cancer,105 and many other types of cancer106 (including undiagnosable cancers107), aided by increasingly
personalized screening techniques.108 The FDA has started approving more AI-powered medical devices that can
help facilitate early detection of the most prevalent cancers.109 AI-enabled cancer detection tools can help alleviate
some of the workload that human radiologists and other cancer doctors face.110

* Paralysis: The Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation has estimated that nearly 1 in 50 people in the United
States are living with paralysis.115 The combination of AI and robotic technologies holds promise for helping
paralyzed individuals regain certain motor functions.116 In May 2023, a Dutch man paralyzed from the waist down
for more than a decade regained his ability to walk thanks to brain and spine implants and an AI-enabled thought
decoder that helped him translate electrical brain signals into muscle movement.117 He is now able to walk around
his own home and get in and out of a car on his own. A paralyzed American man regained his sense of touch and
mobility thanks to similar AI-enabled brain implants.118 AI and ML capabilities are powering other brain-machine
implants that are helping address disabilities in other ways, including regaining the ability to speak after a
stroke.119 And The New York Times recently documented how a woman who lost her arm in an accident is now
able to control her new prosthetic robotic arm thanks to advances in AI and sensors embedded in her body.120

* Mental health and drug addiction: AI can help identify and address mental health problems through textual
analysis, which can supplement human-based analysis at a time when there is a nationwide shortage of health care
workers in this area.121 AI tools are also being tapped to help find novel drugs that can help counter opioid
addiction, which has become a chronic problem in recent years.122 There are many other current or potential
health-related applications for algorithmic technologies, including abnormal chest X-ray detection,123 AI-powered
ultrasounds,124 new drug and vaccine discovery,125and detecting and addressing eye disease and blindness.126
In April 2024, the National Institutes of Health announced a new breakthrough in AI retinal imaging that produces
high-resolution images of cells in the eye 100 times faster and with a 3.5-fold improvement in image contrast.127 AI
and ML will power other advanced learning capabilities that will help doctors and scientific researchers access and
understand massive amounts of patient and health data and put it to even better use. These same capabilities will
help innovators create new personalized health monitoring and tracking systems for the public.128

AI Will Help Doctors, Nurses, and Scientists Advance Treatments

In 2022, I served as a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's "AI Commission on Competition, Inclusion, and
Innovation," a group formed to study AI governance. At a spring 2022 field hearing, our Commission heard remarks
from Cleveland Clinic CEO and President Tom Mihaljevic, MD and several of his colleagues.129 These doctors and
scientists highlighted how they were already using AI/ML to improve patient care and save lives. They noted how
teams of doctors and researchers are now able to share information from tissue samples with much larger teams of
medical experts, who can--with the help of algorithmic systems--work together at a distance to better understand
and use all the information at their fingertips. Additionally, along with other medical centers, the Clinic has
developed better AI-driven methods to detect irregular heartbeats and strokes and to diagnose degenerative brain
diseases like Alzheimer's, dementia, and Parkinson's.130 This only scratches the surface of what AI/ML will mean
for patient care.131 Dr. Mihaljevic noted that, when he started practicing medicine in the 1980s, the overall volume
of medical information doubled roughly every seven years; today, it doubles every 73 days.132 Meanwhile, 7,000
medical papers are published every day.133 A recent study in Science shows that, in the closely related field of
medical robotics, the number of scientific papers has grown exponentially from less than 10 published in 1990 to
more than 5,200 in 2020.134 These numbers align with broader trends in technical and scientific literature. "Since
the scientific literature doubles roughly every 12 years, this means that of all scientific work ever produced, half of it
has been produced in the last 12 years," note the authors of The Science of Science.135

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10 -- The U.S. Department of Energy's Pacific Northwest National Laboratory issued the
following press release:

Just as fast as technology is changing, so is the threat landscape. More frequent and intense disasters put
pressures on emergency operations centers (EOCs) to rapidly share and analyze data that informs decision-
making. At the GovAI Summit 2023, a panel with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and
Technology (S&T) Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and other emergency management
practitioners discussed how science and technology-specifically artificial intelligence (AI)-can help.

"Technology is a changing opportunity space for emergency preparedness and response, and we see that more
than ever with the current emergence of AI. This panel was a great chance to focus on both the challenges and
opportunities AI presents for emergency managers and first responders who help keep us safe," said Ryan Eddy,
PNNL director of homeland security programs.

The panel, "The EOC of the Future: How AI Will Transform Emergency Ops," explored how AI can help emergency
management advance from data overload to prediction and adjustment.

"With today's tools, there is a lot of data that can inform decision-making, but emergency managers need to be able
to access it and use it-and fast. At PNNL, we are enabling secure, trustworthy, science-based AI and machine
learning programs to advance capabilities, particularly in image analysis and cyber defense," Eddy said.

Eddy's presentation, "Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology for Emergency Management," highlighted
PNNL AI tools and analysis capabilities, such as Rapid Analytics for Disaster Response, which combines image-
capturing technology, AI and cloud computing to assess damage and predict risks during extreme events, and
Sharkzor tool, which is an AI-driven, scalable web application that makes it possible to quickly characterize and sort
electron microscopy images used to analyze radioactive materials.

NEW ORLEANS, March 18 -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued the following news release:

DHS Will Launch Three Pilot Projects to Test AI Technology to Enhance Immigration Officer Training, Help
Communities Build Resilience and Reduce Burden for Applying for Disaster Relief Grants, and Improve Efficiency
of Law Enforcement Investigations

WASHINGTON - Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Chief Information Officer and
Chief Artificial Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen announced the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) first
"Artificial Intelligence Roadmap." The roadmap details DHS's 2024 plans, including to test uses of the
technologies that deliver meaningful benefits to the American public and advance homeland security, while
ensuring that individuals' privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected.

As part of the roadmap, DHS announced three innovative pilot projects that will deploy AI in specific mission areas.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will test AI to enhance investigative processes focused on detecting
fentanyl and increasing efficiency of investigations related to combatting child sexual exploitation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will deploy AI to help communities plan for and develop hazard mitigation
plans to build resilience and minimize risks. And, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will
use AI to improve immigration officer training.

"The unprecedented speed and potential of AI's development and adoption presents both enormous opportunities
to advance our mission and risks we must mitigate," said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.
"The DHS AI roadmap and pilots will guide our efforts this year to strengthen our national security, improve our
operations, and provide more efficient services to the American people, while upholding our commitment to protect
civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. What we learn from the pilot projects will be beneficial in shaping how the
Department can effectively and responsibly use AI across the homeland security enterprise moving forward."

The roadmap lays out DHS's initiatives in AI, describes the potential of AI technologies across the Department, and
offers clearer visibility into the Department's approach to AI, while underscoring the Department's commitment to
responsible utilization.

                                                                           Page 2 of 4
       DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY UNVEILS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ROADMAP,
    ANNOUNCES PILOT PROJECTS TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCE HOMELAND
                                     SECURITY ....

The AI roadmap outlines three lines of effort DHS is using to guide its work:

* Responsibly leverage AI to advance Homeland Security missions while protecting individuals' privacy, civil rights,
and civil liberties - DHS is committed to ensuring that its use of AI fully respects privacy, civil liberties, and civil
rights, is rigorously tested to avoid bias, disparate impact, privacy harms, and other risks, and that it is
understandable to the people we serve.

* Promote Nationwide AI Safety and Security - Advances in AI will revolutionize the delivery of essential goods and
services upon which Americans rely. AI can create tremendous efficiencies and benefits for citizens, but it can also
present new and novel risks. To protect U.S. cyber networks and critical infrastructure, DHS will help govern the
safe and responsible development and use of AI.

* Continue to lead in AI through strong cohesive partnerships - DHS will foster strong relationships with private
sector, academia, State, Local, Territorial, and Tribalgovernments, international partners, non-government
organizations, research institutions, and thought leaders to accelerate the development and deployment of AI
solutions tailored to the unique challenges faced by the DHS. In line with the DHS's commitment to transparency
and visibility into the Department's vision for AI and to ensuring responsible use, DHS will continue to share
information and engage with communities, advocates, and partners to demonstrate responsible AI use.

DHS's three new pilot programs will allow the Department to assess the efficacy of AI in improving its mission
capabilities. Each pilot team is partnering with privacy, cybersecurity, and civil rights and civil liberties experts
throughout their development and evaluation process. This work will inform Department-wide policies on AI
governance. DHS offices and agencies submitted dozens of proposals for consideration to the Chief AI Officer, who
selected three pilots that would best support evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLM) and
Generative AI technology at DHS.

The new pilot programs announced today will:

* Transform Security Investigative Processes, Unlock Data-Driven Insights, and Improve Mission Outcomes - HSI's
pilot project will strengthen their investigative processes by introducing a LLM-based system designed to enhance
the efficiency and accuracy of summaries investigators rely upon. The LLM-based system will leverage open-
source technologies to allow investigators to more quickly summarize and search for contextually relevant
information within investigative reports. The pilot could lead to increases in detection of fentanyl-related networks,
aid in identification of perpetrators and victims of child exploitation crimes, and surface key patterns and trends that
could further HSI's vital work.

* Bolster Planning Assistance for Resilient Communities - FEMA will launch a GenAI pilot to create efficiencies for
the hazard mitigation planning process for local governments, including underserved communities. Hazard
mitigation plans are not only a foundational step that communities can take to build their resilience but can be
lengthy to produce and challenging for communities that lack resources to do so. The pilot will specifically support
State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments' understanding of how to craft a plan that identifies risks and
mitigation strategies as well as generate draft plan elements-from publicly-available, well-researched sources - that
governments could customize to meet their needs. This pilot could lead to more communities having the ability to
submit grant applications for funding to become more resilient and reduce disaster risks.

* Enhance Immigration Officer Training through Generative AI - United States Citizenship and Immigration Services
is developing an interactive application that uses GenAI to improve the way the agency trains immigration officer
personnel. USCIS will generate dynamic, personalized training materials that adapt to officers' specific needs and
ensure the best possible knowledge and training on a wide range of current policies and laws relevant to their jobs.
The goal is to help enhance trainees' understanding and retention of crucial information, increase the accuracy of
their decisionmaking process, and limit the need for retraining over time.

The roadmap and announcement of pilot programs are the latest in the Department's ongoing AI initiatives.

In February, Secretary Mayorkas and CIO Hysen announced the Department's first-ever hiring sprint to recruit 50
AI technology experts to help build teams that will help better leverage AI responsibly across strategic areas of the
homeland security enterprise. These include efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and abuse,
deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity. DHS
has received a strong response to date and is in the process of reviewing. interviewing, and hiring AI technologists
to support mission-enhancing initiatives. The Department continues to accept applications on dhs.gov/AI.

Last year, DHS established the Department's first AI Task Force and named CIO Hysen its first Chief AI Officer.
Informed by the Task Force's work over the past 11 months, DHS has identified areas where AI can enhance the
effectiveness of the Department's efforts - helping pave the way for this roadmap and these new projects. The Task
Force's focus is on DHS's entire mission space. For instance, it is working to enhance the integrity of our supply
chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to improve cargo screening, the identification of
imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management. The Task Force is also charged with using AI to
better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of precursor chemicals around the world, and disrupt
key nodes in criminal networks.

The Department's latest efforts follow President Biden's Executive Order (EO) "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence," signed in October2023. The EO directed DHS to promote the
adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI
can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the
United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions.&#8239;The President has directed DHS to
establish an AI Safety and Security Advisory Board to support the responsible development of AI. This Board will
bring together preeminent industry experts from AI hardware and software companies, leading research labs,
critical infrastructure entities, and the U.S. government. This Board will issue recommendations and best practices
for an array of AI use cases to ensure AI deployments are secure and resilient.

Virginia Tech issued the following news:

On the morning of Aug. 5, Category 1 Hurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, then moved up
the East Coast. The storm flooded nearly 2,200 square kilometers, or 850 square miles, between Florida and New
York, according to new findings from Virginia Tech's Earth Observation and Innovation Lab.

By Aug. 9, more than 35 million people from South Carolina to Vermont were under flood alerts. Berkeley County,
South Carolina, saw as much as 14 inches of rain with Charleston reaching 15 inches. Cities and counties along the
U.S. Atlantic Coast are already vulnerable to flooding caused by land subsidence and sea level rise, a recent
Virginia Tech study found.

Associate Professor Manoochehr Shirzaei and his team tracked Debby's impact by leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and big radar satellite data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites operated by European Space Agency.

Radar microwave signals penetrate clouds and capture detailed images of the Earth's surface, allowing for accurate
detection of floodwaters. Radar can measure changes in water levels, track flood progression, and provide critical
data for emergency response and disaster management.

Shrizaei's team found that nearly 2,200 square kilometers were flooded during and after Debby's landfall between
Florida and New York with 1.5 percent of the land area in nine counties inundated. Seven counties experienced
more than 35 square kilometers of inundation.

Debby is the fourth hurricane since 2000 to hit Florida in early August. Its heavy rain and strong winds may be
linked to a warming atmosphere and oceans, which can hold more moisture.

"As extreme weather events like Debby become more common, it's crucial to rethink how we develop flood-prone
areas along the U.S. East Coast," Shirzaei said. "Investing in resilient infrastructure and promoting public
awareness are essential steps in preparing for and adapting to future floodings."

(TNSres) -- The International Rescue Committee issued the following news release:

Ahead of the AI for Good Summit, the International Rescue Committee (IRC) is announcing a new humanitarian
partnership with OpenAI leveraging cutting-edge AI technology to improve learning outcomes and reduce
disruptions in learning for children in crisis-affected communities.

A total of 224 million school-aged and pre-school aged children are affected by crises globally, and 199 million of
those children are either out of school or in school but not learning. Growing inequality, poverty, and instability
remain among the main barriers to education worldwide. Even when children can attend school, the growing
teacher shortage makes learning nearly impossible.

To help address this critical need, the IRC is developing aprendIA, an AI-driven educational chatbot platform that
delivers personalized learning experiences that crisis-affected communities can access--in particular, teachers and
parents. aprendIA will deploy educational interventions quickly in diverse humanitarian contexts and at scale via
messaging platforms commonly used by clients.

With OpenAI's $250,000 award, the IRC hopes to reach at least 10,000 teachers and caregivers in protracted and
acute crises in areas such as Northeast Nigeria, Colombia, and Bangladesh through this project, thus indirectly
impacting at least half a million students. By integrating with OpenAI's ChatGPT, the IRC will be able to rapidly
create content, support overstretched teachers and personalize digital education experiences for improved learning
outcomes and teacher empowerment, while researching the effectiveness of AI in education in safe and ethical
ways.

Teachers and learning facilitators are at the heart of every education system. But in conflict and crisis settings,
teachers lack resources to support children who face unique challenges, which can include trauma, missed years of
education, or unfamiliar languages and curriculum. Now more than ever, the humanitarian sector needs an injection
of innovation to unlock progress without burdening already overstretched and under-resourced services and
systems.

                                                                                                Page 2 of 3

                                         in Crisis Affected Settings

"With more people displaced than ever, the evolving and growing nature of the global refugee crisis requires not
just more aid, but new thinking too," said David Miliband, President and CEO of the IRC. "As the IRC leans into
further leveraging artificial intelligence, we are thrilled to work with OpenAI, who are supporting our work in
developing innovative solutions to solve one the biggest challenges faced in crisis-affected communities around the
world - effectively delivering education at the last mile."

"Generative AI can give teachers and caregivers in crisis zones new ways of reaching vulnerable students who
need the kind of personalized instruction and educational support that would otherwise be out of reach," said Anna
Makanju, OpenAI's vice president of Global Affairs. "OpenAI is proud to support the IRC's innovative efforts to use
artificial intelligence to provide vital assistance to refugees and other displaced people around the world."

(TNSres) -- NetApp, a provider of software, systems and services to manage and store data, issued the following
news release:

NetApp(R) (NASDAQ: NTAP), the intelligent data infrastructure company, today announced cyber-resiliency
capabilities that will equip customers to better protect and recover their data in the face of ransomware threats.
NetApp is one of the first to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) directly into enterprise
primary storage to fight ransomware in real-time. The NetApp cyber-resiliency capabilities protect both primary and
secondary data for organizations whether it is stored on-premises or in the cloud.

Cybercriminals are increasingly aiming ransomware attacks at critical infrastructure and supply chains where
operational disruptions can cost millions of dollars, according to Forrester. As a result, 87 percent of C-suite and
board-level executives ranked ransomware as a high, or the top, priority for their organization, according to the
NetApp 2023 Data Complexity report. When cybercriminals breach perimeters, networks, and identities storage
becomes the last line of defense for organizations' most critical data. With the threat of ransomware looming,
organizations need solutions that not only protect their data but also quickly recover lost data and return to normal
operations. NetApp is updating its cyber-resiliency solutions and leveraging the power of AI to give customers
confidence that their data will be safe and accessible when they need it.

"NetApp is taking an aggressive and proactive approach to protecting our customers' data against cyber threats
using artificial intelligence. We are the first storage vendor to explicitly and financially guarantee our data storage
offerings against ransomware," said Mignona Cote, CSO at NetApp. "Today, we are furthering that leadership with
updates that make defending data comprehensive, continuous, and simple for our customers."

NetApp is focused on designing data storage and management systems that maximize data protection and security
while meeting data governance and compliance standards, with new updates that include:

* ONTAP Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) will spearhead the next
generation of real-time enterprise storage ransomware protection, giving increased accuracy and performance
required to detect and mitigate new, more sophisticated cyber threats. NetApp pioneered autonomous real-time

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 4
       NetApp Fights Ransomware in Real-Time With Built-In Artificial Intelligence on Enterprise Storage and
                                    Enhanced Cyber-Resiliency Solutions

detection of ransomware directly in primary enterprise storage three years ago. Now, NetApp will be leading the
charge to use adaptive AI/ML models built directly into enterprise primary storage to look at file-level signals in real-
time to detect even the newest ransomware attacks with planned 99%+ precision and recall. NetApp will be offering
the first technology preview of ARP/AI within the next quarter.

* NetApp BlueXP Ransomware Protection, now in public preview, provides a single control plane to intelligently
coordinate and execute an end-to-end, workload-centric ransomware defense. Customers can now identify and
protect critical workload data with a single click, accurately and automatically detect and respond to a potential
attack, and recover workloads within minutes, safeguarding their valuable data and minimizing costly disruption.

* Application-Aware Ransomware Protection via NetApp SnapCenter 5.0 offers immutable ransomware protection
for applications. SnapCenter will now apply NetApp's leading ransomware protection technologies, previously used
with unstructured data, to application-consistent backup. SnapCenter 5.0 includes support for key ONTAP features
like tamperproof Snapshot copy locking, SnapLock protected volumes, and SnapMirror Business Continuity to
enable more robust data protection for applications and virtual machines. SnapCenter 5.0 supports protection of
applications on-premises with NetApp AFF, ASA, and FAS, as well as in the cloud.

* NetApp BlueXP Disaster Recovery, now generally available, offers seamless integration with VMware
infrastructure and provides storage options for both on-premises and major public cloud environments. This
comprehensive solution eliminates the need for separate standby disaster recovery (DR) infrastructure, reducing
costs. With NetApp BlueXP disaster recovery, failover and failback processes are simplified, allowing smooth
transitions from on-premises VMware infrastructure to the public cloud or to an on-premises data center.

* NetApp Keystone Ransomware Recovery Guarantee extends NetApp's current Ransomware Recovery
Guarantee to our leading storage-as-a-service offering, NetApp Keystone. With this guarantee, NetApp will warrant
snapshot data recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. If snapshot data copies can't be recovered through
NetApp, we will offer compensation*.

"Today's cybersecurity teams face the monumental task of protecting their companies' data from ever-evolving
threats, especially ransomware," said Archana Venkatraman, Research Director, Cloud Data Management, IDC.
"NetApp's approach of delivering a secure, unified storage infrastructure makes storage foundational for
ransomware protection and reduces the burden on cybersecurity teams. Companies looking to fortify their cyber
resiliency and shifting protection left will increasingly look to vendors that take a secure-by-design approach and
develop unified storage and data services."

"Using NetApp in our Advanced Technology Center, we significantly simplified our replication process for VMware
virtual machines and their underlying datastores to meet or exceed recovery benchmarks," said Derek Elbert,
Solutions Architect at WWT. "With NetApp's solutions, we successfully established the recovery policies for cloud
volumes workloads or virtual machines with no existing DR strategy, managing everything through NetApp BlueXP.
This transforms how we operate disaster recovery for VMware."

"To store sensitive genomics and health data, we have to use the right technology with layers of security built in,"
said Mark Cowley, Deputy Director at Children's Cancer Institute. "With NetApp, we can be very confident that we
are sharing the right data only to authorized researchers. The last line of defense is your weakest web-based
system, so we've implemented role-based access and added resilience to all of our tools."

The latest cyber resiliency updates from NetApp empower organizations to proactively address cybersecurity
threats in complex hybrid and multicloud environments, leveraging AI to identify threats and prevent disruptions to
their operations.

Body

NetApp® (NASDAQ: NTAP), the intelligent data infrastructure company, today announced cyber-resiliency
capabilities that will equip customers to better protect and recover their data in the face of ransomware threats.
NetApp is one of the first to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) directly into enterprise
primary storage to fight ransomware in real-time. The NetApp cyber-resiliency capabilities protect both primary and
secondary data for organizations whether it is stored on-premises or in the cloud.

Cybercriminals are increasingly aiming ransomware attacks at critical infrastructure and supply chains where
operational disruptions can cost millions of dollars, according to Forrester . As a result, 87 percent of C-suite and
board-level executives ranked ransomware as a high, or the top, priority for their organization, according to the
NetApp 2023 Data Complexity report . When cybercriminals breach perimeters, networks, and identities storage
becomes the last line of defense for organizations' most critical data. With the threat of ransomware looming,
organizations need solutions that not only protect their data but also quickly recover lost data and return to normal
operations. NetApp is updating its cyber-resiliency solutions and leveraging the power of AI to give customers
confidence that their data will be safe and accessible when they need it.

"NetApp is taking an aggressive and proactive approach to protecting our customers' data against cyber threats
using artificial intelligence. We are the first storage vendor to explicitly and financially guarantee our data storage
offerings against ransomware," said Mignona Cote, CSO at NetApp. "Today, we are furthering that leadership with
updates that make defending data comprehensive, continuous, and simple for our customers."

NetApp is focused on designing data storage and management systems that maximize data protection and security
while meeting data governance and compliance standards, with new updates that include:
    •     ONTAP Autonomous Ransomware Protection with Artificial Intelligence (ARP/AI) will spearhead the next
          generation of real-time enterprise storage ransomware protection, giving increased accuracy and
          performance required to detect and mitigate new, more sophisticated cyber threats. NetApp pioneered
          autonomous real-time detection of ransomware directly in primary enterprise storage three years ago.
          Now, NetApp will be leading the charge to use adaptive AI/ML models built directly into enterprise primary
          storage to look at file-level signals in real-time to detect even the newest ransomware attacks with planned
          99%+ precision and recall. NetApp will be offering the first technology preview of ARP/AI within the next
          quarter.

                                                                                                       Page 2 of 4
        NetApp Fights Ransomware in Real-Time with Built-In Artificial Intelligence on Enterprise Storage and
                        Enhanced Cyber-Resiliency Solutions Amid increasing ransom....

    •    NetApp BlueXP Ransomware Protection, now in public preview, provides a single control plane to
         intelligently coordinate and execute an end-to-end, workload-centric ransomware defense. Customers can
         now identify and protect critical workload data with a single click, accurately and automatically detect and
         respond to a potential attack, and recover workloads within minutes, safeguarding their valuable data and
         minimizing costly disruption.
    •    Application-Aware Ransomware Protection via NetApp SnapCenter 5.0 offers immutable ransomware
         protection for applications. SnapCenter will now apply NetApp's leading ransomware protection
         technologies, previously used with unstructured data, to application-consistent backup. SnapCenter 5.0
         includes support for key ONTAP features like tamperproof Snapshot copy locking, SnapLock protected
         volumes, and SnapMirror Business Continuity to enable more robust data protection for applications and
         virtual machines. SnapCenter 5.0 supports protection of applications on-premises with NetApp AFF, ASA,
         and FAS, as well as in the cloud.
    •    NetApp BlueXP Disaster Recovery, now generally available, offers seamless integration with VMware
         infrastructure and provides storage options for both on-premises and major public cloud environments.
         This comprehensive solution eliminates the need for separate standby disaster recovery (DR)
         infrastructure, reducing costs. With NetApp BlueXP disaster recovery, failover and failback processes are
         simplified, allowing smooth transitions from on-premises VMware infrastructure to the public cloud or to an
         on-premises data center.
    •    NetApp Keystone Ransomware Recovery Guarantee extends NetApp's current Ransomware Recovery
         Guarantee to our leading storage-as-a-service offering, NetApp Keystone. With this guarantee, NetApp will
         warrant snapshot data recovery in the event of a ransomware attack. If snapshot data copies can't be
         recovered through NetApp, we will offer compensation*.

"Today's cybersecurity teams face the monumental task of protecting their companies' data from ever-evolving
threats, especially ransomware," said Archana Venkatraman, Research Director, Cloud Data Management, IDC.
"NetApp's approach of delivering a secure, unified storage infrastructure makes storage foundational for
ransomware protection and reduces the burden on cybersecurity teams. Companies looking to fortify their cyber
resiliency and shifting protection left will increasingly look to vendors that take a secure-by-design approach and
develop unified storage and data services."

"Using NetApp in our Advanced Technology Center, we significantly simplified our replication process for VMware
virtual machines and their underlying datastores to meet or exceed recovery benchmarks," said Derek Elbert,
Solutions Architect at WWT. "With NetApp's solutions, we successfully established the recovery policies for cloud
volumes workloads or virtual machines with no existing DR strategy, managing everything through NetApp BlueXP.
This transforms how we operate disaster recovery for VMware."

"To store sensitive genomics and health data, we have to use the right technology with layers of security built in,"
said Mark Cowley, Deputy Director at Children's Cancer Institute. "With NetApp, we can be very confident that we
are sharing the right data only to authorized researchers. The last line of defense is your weakest web-based
system, so we've implemented role-based access and added resilience to all of our tools."

The latest cyber resiliency updates from NetApp empower organizations to proactively address cybersecurity
threats in complex hybrid and multicloud environments, leveraging AI to identify threats and prevent disruptions to
their operations.

Body


Chairman Heinrich, Vice Chairman Schweikert, and members of the Committee:

Thank you for the invitation to participate in this important hearing on "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to
Fuel Economic Growth and Improve Governance." My name is Adam Thierer, and I am a senior fellow at the R
Street Institute, where I focus on emerging technology issues. I also recently served as a commissioner on the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce's Commission on Artificial Intelligence Competitiveness, Inclusion, and Innovation. n1

Today I will discuss three points relevant to this hearing:

1. First, AI and advanced computational technologies can help fuel broad-based economic growth and sectoral
productivity while also improving consumer health and welfare in important ways.

2. Second, to unlock these benefits, the United States needs to pursue a pro-innovation AI policy vision that can
also help bolster our global competitive advantage and geopolitical security.

3. Third, we can advance these goals through an AI Opportunity Agenda that includes a learning period moratorium
on burdensome new AI regulations.

I will address each point briefly, but I have included three appendices to my testimony offering more details.

AI Could Drive Economic Growth, Increase Sectoral Productivity, and Improve Human Well-Being

AI is set to become the "most important general-purpose technology of our era," and AI could revolutionize every
segment of the economy in some fashion. n2 The potential exists for AI to drive explosive economic growth and
productivity enhancements. n3 While predictions vary, analysts forecast that AI could deliver trillions in additional
global economic activity and significantly boost annual GDP growth. n4 This would be over and above the $4 trillion
of gross output that the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis says the U.S. digital economy already accounted for in
2022. n5 [See Appendix I]

But what really matters is what AI means for every American personally. AI is poised to revolutionize health
outcomes, in particular. AI is already helping with early detection and treatment of cancers, strokes, heart disease,

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

brain disease, sepsis, and other ailments. AI is also helping address organ failure, paralysis, vision impairments,
and much more. The age of personalized medicine will be driven by AI advancement. [See Appendix 2]

AI can help make government more efficient, too. n6 Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted recently used an AI tool to help sift
through the state's code of regulations and eliminate 2.2 million words' worth of unnecessary and outdated
regulations. n7 California Gov. Gavin Newsom just announced an effort to use generative AI tools to improve public
services and cut n8 percent from the state's government operations budget.8 And regulators are using AI to
facilitate compliance with existing policies, such as post-market medical device surveillance. n9

AI also holds the potential to achieve administrative savings for federal health insurance programs or, better yet,
reduce the number of people dependent on them by identifying and treating ailments earlier. n10

Computational Freedom Is Important for America's Geopolitical Competitiveness and Security

There is an important connection between AI and broader national objectives. A strong technology base is a key
source of strength and prosperity, so it is essential that we do not undermine innovation and investment as the next
great technological race gets underway with China and the rest of the world. n11

Luckily, U.S. AI innovators are still in the lead. Had a Chinese operator launched a major generative AI model first,
it would have been a "Sputnik moment" for America. Still, China has made its imperial ambitions clear with a goal to
become the global leader in advanced computation by 2030, and it has considerable talent, data, and resources to
power those ambitions. n12 Experts argue that "China's whole-of-society approach is challenging America's
traditional advantages" in advanced technology. n13

We need a pro-innovation national AI policy that will not only strengthen our economy and provide better products
and jobs, but also bolster national security and allow our values of pluralism, personal liberty, individual rights, and
free speech to shape global information platforms and markets. n14

If fear-based policies impede America's AI development and diffusion, then China wins. n15

Protect the Freedom to Innovate with an "AI Opportunity Agenda"

To achieve the benefits AI offers and meet the rising global competition, America needs an AI Opportunity Agenda.

An AI Opportunity Agenda begins by reiterating that the freedom to innovate is the cornerstone of American
technology policy and the key to unlocking the enormous potential of our nation's entrepreneurs and workers. n16

As part of this Agenda, Congress should craft a learning period moratorium on new proposals, such as new AI-
specific bureaucracies, licensing systems, or liability schemes, all of which would be counterproductive and
undermine our nation's computational capabilities. [See Enclosure I]

In addition, this moratorium should preempt burdensome state and local regulatory enactments that conflict with our
national AI policy framework. n17

Next, Congress should require our government's existing 439 federal departments to evaluate their current policies
toward AI systems with two purposes in mind. First, to ensure that they are not over-burdening algorithmic systems
with outdated policies, and second, to determine how existing rules and regulations are capable of addressing the
concerns that some have raised about AI. Taking inventory of existing rules and regulations can then allow
policymakers to identify any gaps that Congress ought to address using targeted remedies.

Finally, an AI Opportunity Agenda requires an openness to new talent and competition. n18 With experts finding
that a "talent war is brewing between the US and China," and that China is moving ahead in some important ways,
we must take steps to attract and retain the world's best and brightest data scientists and computer engineers. n19

Conclusion

                                                                                                    Page 3 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

In sum, America's AI policy should be rooted in patience and humility instead of a rush to over-regulate based on
hypotheticals and worst-case thinking. n20 We are still very early in the AI lifecycle, and there is still no consensus
on how to define the term, let alone legislate beyond establishing definitions. n21

To ensure America leads this next great technological revolution, Congress must once again uphold the freedom to
innovate and craft a flexible, risk-based AI policy vision to ensure we can meet global competition, advance
economic opportunity, and improve the well-being of every citizen.

Thank you for holding this hearing and for your consideration of my views. I look forward to any questions you may
have.

moratorium.

Appendix 1: How AI Could Drive Economic Growth and Sectoral Productivity

Over the past half century, there have been waves of both great excitement and disillusionment about the prospects
for AI advancement. n22 AI historians often speak of the many AI "springs" and "winters"--what one might think of
as AI booms and busts--that have come and gone. n23

It did not help that some of AI's early pioneers over-exuberantly predicted that powerful "superintelligence" would
be with us in short order. In the late 1960s, for example, noted AI researchers confidentially predicted that
"machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do," (Herbert A. Simon), and that "[i]n
from three to eight years we will have a machine with the general intelligence of an average human being" (Marvin
Minsky). n24 Such exuberance was replaced by pessimism in the 1970s, resulting in a "winter" period for AI
research and investment.

Today, however, AI is generally thought to be in the midst of another spring as enthusiasm grows around specific
capabilities and applications. Economists predict that AI is set to become the "most important general-purpose
technology of our era." n25 General-purpose technologies will become intertwined with almost every other
economic sector and used ubiquitously throughout society. n26 These developments are coming about because we
live in an era of rapid-fire combinatorial innovation in which new technologies are building on top of one another in a
symbiotic fashion, further accelerating their development and sophistication. n27

Improving Many Sectors, Including Government

The power of algorithmic technologies is all around us in products and services such as speech and image
recognition tools on our smartphones and the recommender systems many media providers and other companies
use to tailor goods, services, and content to our interests. AI will be used by almost all organizations to help
improve analytics and marketing, enhance customer service, and boost sales or performance in various new ways.
And it will completely upend the way production and work is done in countless fields and professions.

AI and ML capabilities are operating behind the scenes to help with fraud and spam detection, computer virus
filtering, content management/moderation, n28 mapping/navigation, n29 travel planning, n30 weather forecasting
and natural disaster prediction, n31 warehouse automation/inventory management, n32 supply chain
management, n33 and various other logistics. n34 For example, in 2021, McKinsey and Company estimated that
"[s]uccessfully implementing AI-enabled supply-chain management has enabled early adopters to improve logistics
costs by 15 percent, inventory levels by 35 percent, and service levels by 65 percent, compared with slower-

                                                                                                    Page 4 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

moving competitors." n35 These productivity enhancements will likely accelerate as algorithmic techniques are
further refined.

AI and ML capabilities also power most of the devices that make up the so-called Internet of Things and various
connected "smart" devices, including many wearable technologies and other devices with embedded sensors. n36
Another related term here is ambient computing n37 or ubiquitous computing, which essentially means "using
computers without knowing that you are using one," or using smart systems without explicitly calling them
computers. n38 These technologies have powerful health and medical applications, among other things.

Meanwhile, various AI-powered robotic technologies are already at work in many industrial sectors. n39 AI, ML, and
advanced robotics technologies promise to revolutionize many fields including advertising and marketing, n40
agriculture, n41 archeology, n42 auto safety, n43 aviation, n44 education, n45 endangered species protection, n46
energy and climate solutions, n47 entertainment, n48 financial services, n49 legal services, n50 retail, n51
transportation, n52 and others. n53 Going forward, every segment of the economy will be touched by AI and
robotics in some fashion; therefore, it should be equally clear that public policy will be transformed in the process.

AI will affect government processes, too. n54 In April 2024, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted used an AI tool to help sift
through the state's code of regulations and eliminate 2.2 million words' worth of unnecessary and outdated
regulations. n55 In May 2024, California Gov. Gavin Newsom announced an effort to use generative AI tools to
improve public services and cut 8 percent from the state's government operations budget. n56 AI is also being used
by regulators to facilitate compliance with existing policies. For example, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) has been using AI for post-market medical device surveillance. n57

AI, Economic Growth, and Productivity Gains

The potential exists for AI to drive explosive economic growth and productivity enhancements. n58 While
predictions vary, most analysts believe that "AI will have a significant economic impact." n59

. According to Grand View Research, a market research and consulting company based in India and the United
States, the global AI market was valued at $93.5 billion in 2021 and is projected to expand at a compound annual
growth rate of 38.1 percent from 2022 to 2030. n60

. A 2018 McKinsey study estimated that "AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic activity of around
$13 trillion by 2030, or about 16 percent higher cumulative GDP compared with today. This amounts to 1.2 percent
additional GDP growth per year." n61 In the summer of 2023, McKinsey released another study estimating that
generative AI alone could add up to $4.4 trillion of value to the global economy annually. n62

. An earlier PwC report forecast a $15.7 trillion potential contribution to the global economy by 2030. n63

. A 2023 Goldman Sachs report predicted AI could help boost U.S. labor productivity by 1.5 percentage points each
year, while Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates AI will add an additional 1.0 percentage points
to productivity growth over the 2025-2028 timeframe. n64 Goldman also says generative AI could drive a 7 percent
(or almost $7 trillion) increase in global GDP over a 10-year period. n65

. Another leading economist with a specialization in technology argues that AI will double productivity in the coming
decade. n66

Even if AI's economic impact falls far short of those estimates, it would still generate enormous growth opportunities
across many segments of the economy. AI is also invigorating new types of tech competition, especially from open-
source players and platforms. n67 It also promises to benefit small businesses by creating new products and jobs.
A U.S. Chamber of Commerce report finds that 87 percent of small businesses reported increased efficiency due to
new technology platforms and that one in four small businesses are already using AI. n68

The Past Can Be Prologue

                                                                                                    Page 5 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

If this potential for explosive growth still sounds outlandish, consider that, in 1998, Nobel Prize-winning economist
Paul Krugman infamously predicted that the internet's impact on the global economy would be "no greater than the
fax machine's." n69 President Bill Clinton thought differently, predicting that the internet's potential was "nothing
short of revolutionary" and that "[i]n just a few years, it will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in goods and
services." n70

Clinton's optimism was vindicated. Electronic commerce exploded, and digital innovation became the foundation of
significant economic growth, new jobs, and boundless speech opportunities. According to the U.S. Bureau of
Economic Analysis, in 2022, the U.S. digital economy accounted for over $4 trillion of gross output, $2.6 trillion of
value added (translating to 10 percent of U.S. GDP), $1.3 trillion of compensation, and 8.9 million jobs. n71

These astonishing results came about thanks to wise bipartisan public policies formulated by the Clinton
administration and a Republican-led Congress. n72 Freedom to innovate was America's policy default for digital
services, and burdensome state regulations (and even taxes) were preempted to a degree. n73 Federal
policymakers made a firm break with the old regulatory models of the analog era, which had constrained
competition. The results speak for themselves. In addition to generating remarkable economic output and
opportunity, this approach resulted in global dominance of digital technology markets. Today, 18 of the 25 largest
digital companies in the world are U.S.-based, and it is difficult to name any from Europe. n74 In essence, as a
recent

Wall Street Journal headline observed, the European Union now "regulates its way to last place" on digital
technology. n75

This should serve as a cautionary tale for U.S. policymakers. America got policy right for the internet, but the sort of
approach adopted for AI remains to be seen. If we want U.S. firms to once again lead the world--and help counter
China's looming influence on AI markets in particular--it is essential for policymakers to strike the right policy
balance once again. n76

Appendix 2: AI's Potential for Improving Medicine and Health Outcomes

AI is already revolutionizing the field of healthcare and the practice of medicine. n77 Increasingly powerful
algorithmic systems--often combined with new wearable technologies--are already helping many people better
monitor their health and fitness. n78 Generative AI tools will also supplement remote medicine with virtual health
care assistants. n79 More sophisticated AI tools are allowing doctors and scientists to create highly personalized
care options and develop new medical treatments tailored to the unique needs of each patient. n80 As two medical
experts and authors of The Age of Scientific Wellness have noted, "those who fold these systems into their
practices will be doing their patients (and themselves) a great service" because "they are akin to having not one
expert but thousands upon thousands, all working together at top speed. Because AI is generally inexpensive to run
once it has been developed, the potential for optimizing care and making it radically cheaper is striking." n81

AI and ML-enabled technologies are already having a profound impact on public health. Machine learning refers to
the processes by which a computer can train and improve an algorithm or computer model without step-by-step
human involvement. n82

In 2022, for example, an AI technology from Google DeepMind called AlphaFold was able to model the structure of
nearly all known proteins, representing "a significant advance in biology that will accelerate drug discovery and help
address problems such as sustainability and food insecurity." n83 Researchers from the Fundamental AI Research
Team at Meta have a competing ML-created database of 617 million predicted protein structures. n84 These
advances are leading to what some researchers call a "protein design revolution" driving "the next quantum leap in
the biotech industry," which could completely transform medicine. n85 This competition continues, as DeepMind
announced the latest and more powerful iteration of AlphaFold in April 2024. n86

A Broad Range of Health Benefits

                                                                                                    Page 6 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

AI, ML, and robotics are driving many other major medical advances today, becoming a crucial part of early
detection of various ailments and diseases. n87 "Artificial-intelligence algorithms are processing vast troves of
data in electronic medical records, searching for patterns to predict future outcomes and recommend treatments,"
notes a Wall Street Journal medical reporter. n88 "They are creating early-warning systems to help hospital staff
spot subtle but serious changes in a patient's condition that aren't always visible or noticed in a busy unit, and
predicting which patients about to be discharged from the hospital are at highest risk of being readmitted." n89

Here are some other specific examples of how AI, ML, and robotics technologies are already advancing medical
science and helping improve health outcomes.

. Organ donation: In the field of organ donations, "[p]aired kidney donation is one of the great success stories of
artificial intelligence," helping doctors and patients by taking "an incredibly complex problem and solves it faster
and with fewer errors than humans can, and saving more lives as a result." n90

. Heart attack detection and treatment: AI and ML tools are helping detect and treat heart disease and heart
attacks, a leading cause of death globally. n91 Scientists at Cedars-Sinai developed an algorithmic tool in 2022 that
can quantify coronary plaque buildup in five to six seconds compared to at least 25 to 30 minutes before. n92 This
will greatly improve the ability to predict who will have a heart attack. Other researchers have developed AI tools to
help improve personalized treatment for women who have had heart attacks. n93 Women who suffer a heart attack
have a higher mortality rate than men, often because their symptoms are not properly understood or diagnosed.
Meanwhile, the British National Health Service recently started using a new AI tool that can detect heart disease in
just 20 seconds while patients are in an MRI scanner, compared with the 13 minutes or more it usually takes
doctors to analyze images manually after performing a scan. n94

. Cancers: President Richard Nixon declared a national "war on cancer" over 50 years ago. n95 More recently, the
Obama and Biden administrations pushed for a "cancer moonshot." n96 Unfortunately, cancers remain the second
leading causes of death in the United States, n97 claiming 602,350 lives in 2020 alone. n98 AI and ML-enabled
technologies are poised to help reduce that staggering death toll. Mayo Clinic researchers have shown how ML
models can help diagnose and treat pancreatic cancer at an earlier stage. n99 Pancreatic cancer is the third leading
cause of cancer deaths, claiming 46,774 lives in 2020. n100 British scientists have recently reported on new AI
software that can spot signs of pre-cancer during endoscopies in 92 percent of patients, which could significantly
lower deaths from esophageal cancer. n101 AI/ML techniques are also helping with early detection and treatment
of lung cancer, n102 breast cancer, n103 brain cancer, n104 cervical cancer, n105 and many other types of cancer
n106 (including undiagnosable cancers n107), aided by increasingly personalized screening techniques. n108 The
FDA has started approving more AI-powered medical devices that can help facilitate early detection of the most
prevalent cancers. n109 AI-enabled cancer detection tools can help alleviate some of the workload that human
radiologists and other cancer doctors face. n110

. Sepsis and superbugs: Recent medical studies have also documented how AI-powered monitoring systems are
helping detect antibiotic-resistant "superbugs" n111 and sepsis, n112 saving thousands of lives each year as a
result. Roughly 1.7 million adults develop sepsis each year in the United States, and more than 250,000 of them
die. m113 Researchers find that the use of AI "dramatically cuts the time it takes to sort through thousands of
promising compounds" to fight drug-resistant pathogens. n114

. Paralysis: The Christopher and Dana Reeve Foundation has estimated that nearly 1 in 50 people in the United
States are living with paralysis. n115 The combination of AI and robotic technologies holds promise for helping
paralyzed individuals regain certain motor functions. n116 In May 2023, a Dutch man paralyzed from the waist
down for more than a decade regained his ability to walk thanks to brain and spine implants and an AI-enabled
thought decoder that helped him translate electrical brain signals into muscle movement. n117 He is now able to
walk around his own home and get in and out of a car on his own. A paralyzed American man regained his sense of
touch and mobility thanks to similar AI-enabled brain implants. n118 AI and ML capabilities are powering other
brain-machine implants that are helping address disabilities in other ways, including regaining the ability to speak
after a stroke. n119 And The New York Times recently documented how a woman who lost her arm in an accident

                                                                                                    Page 7 of 22

is now able to control her new prosthetic robotic arm thanks to advances in AI and sensors embedded in her body.
n120

. Mental health and drug addiction: AI can help identify and address mental health problems through textual
analysis, which can supplement human-based analysis at a time when there is a nationwide shortage of health care
workers in this area. n121 AI tools are also being tapped to help find novel drugs that can help counter opioid
addiction, which has become a chronic problem in recent years. n122

There are many other current or potential health-related applications for algorithmic technologies, including
abnormal chest X-ray detection, n123 AI-powered ultrasounds, n124 new drug and vaccine discovery, n125and
detecting and addressing eye disease and blindness. n126 In April 2024, the National Institutes of Health
announced a new breakthrough in AI retinal imaging that produces high-resolution images of cells in the eye 100
times faster and with a 3.5-fold improvement in image contrast. n127 AI and ML will power other advanced learning
capabilities that will help doctors and scientific researchers access and understand massive amounts of patient and
health data and put it to even better use. These same capabilities will help innovators create new personalized
health monitoring and tracking systems for the public. n128

AI Will Help Doctors, Nurses, and Scientists Advance Treatments

In 2022, I served as a member of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's "AI Commission on Competition, Inclusion, and
Innovation," a group formed to study AI governance. At a spring 2022 field hearing, our Commission heard remarks
from Cleveland Clinic CEO and President Tom Mihaljevic, MD and several of his colleagues.n129 These doctors
and scientists highlighted how they were already using AI/ML to improve patient care and save lives. They noted
how teams of doctors and researchers are now able to share information from tissue samples with much larger
teams of medical experts, who can--with the help of algorithmic systems--work together at a distance to better
understand and use all the information at their fingertips. Additionally, along with other medical centers, the Clinic
has developed better AI-driven methods to detect irregular heartbeats and strokes and to diagnose degenerative
brain diseases like Alzheimer's, dementia, and Parkinson's. n130

This only scratches the surface of what AI/ML will mean for patient care. n131 Dr. Mihaljevic noted that, when he
started practicing medicine in the 1980s, the overall volume of medical information doubled roughly every seven
years; today, it doubles every 73 days. n132 Meanwhile, 7,000 medical papers are published every day. n133 A
recent study in Science shows that, in the closely related field of medical robotics, the number of scientific papers
has grown exponentially from less than 10 published in 1990 to more than 5,200 in 2020. n134 These numbers
align with broader trends in technical and scientific literature. "Since the scientific literature doubles roughly every
12 years, this means that of all scientific work ever produced, half of it has been produced in the last 12 years," note
the authors of The Science of Science. n135

The only way to take full advantage of this explosion of knowledge is with the power of machine-reading and -
learning technologies. As the National Cancer Institute summarizes, "what scientists are most excited about is the
potential for AI to go beyond what humans can currently do themselves. AI can 'see' things that we humans can't,
and can find complex patterns and relationships between very different kinds of data." n136 The authors of The Age
of Scientific Wellness speak of the rise of 'centaur doctors' who, combining the best parts of human intelligence and
AI assistance, will be empowered to make bold medical decisions with far fewer unintended consequences." n137
Further, AI assistants can help address the significant paperwork and filing burdens today's doctors and nurses
face, freeing up time for patient care and research. n138

In the process, AI/ML will also help share medical knowledge across far more institutions and reach more patients
as a result. Dr. Mihaljevic estimated that the Cleveland Clinic--one of the most important medical research facilities
in the nation--is only able to reach an estimated 1.5 percent of Americans using traditional means of care. ML and
AI can change that equation by greatly expanding opportunities for Americans to access the benefits of scientific
knowledge and medical care from the Cleveland Clinic and America's many other world-class medical facilities,
labs, and universities. Dr. Mihaljevic specifically highlighted AI's key role in improving home-based medical care,

                                                                                                    Page 8 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

which will become an essential way to help a rapidly aging population in the future, regardless of where they live.
n139 AI will also become crucial for various surgeries, improving outcomes when operations are necessary (often
through robotic-assisted surgery) n140 or, better yet, avoiding the need for invasive procedures altogether. n141
Robotic surgery at a distance is also becoming possible thanks to recent advances. n142

Conclusion

Policymakers should not underestimate the importance of AI/ML technology and must work diligently to ensure
America remains a leader in this field. While some experts predict another AI winter could be coming following
some notable narrow AI disappointments, they oftentimes fail to identify how public policy influences that outcome.
n143 The overall amount of innovation we can expect to flow from this space is fundamentally tied up in the
question of whether or not America creates the right innovation culture for AI. n144 To achieve its full potential and
bring about the "AI revolution in medicine" that some predict, America will need to set its policy defaults in such a
way that encourages innovation while addressing the many legitimate concerns about various AI capabilities. n145

While some artificial intelligence (AI) critics want to pause AI development, the pause most needed today is on
overzealous regulatory proposals that could kneecap America's lead in computational science and algorithmic
technologies. With over 700 federal and state AI legislative proposals threatening to drown AI innovators in a
tsunami of red tape, Congress should consider adopting a "learning period" moratorium that would limit
burdensome new federal AI mandates as well as the looming patchwork of inconsistent state and local laws.

The time to do so is now, with the race for AI supremacy against China intensifying and other nations investing
heavily to counter the United States. Handcuffing our AI innovators with layers of red tape would diminish domestic
entrepreneurialism and investment, deny citizens many life-enriching innovations, and limit economic growth.
Equally worrisome is how overregulation could undermine our technology base and potentially even our national
security.

Mountains of Red Tape

Unfortunately, many lawmakers seem oblivious to these dangers, floating extreme AI proposals premised on far-
fetched hypotheticals and dystopian sci-fi plots. Such fear-based thinking has led states to propose far-reaching
controls on algorithmic technologies. Colorado just became the first state to advance a comprehensive AI
regulatory measure, which Gov. Jared Polis (D) signed even though he worried state regulations like his could
create "a complex compliance regime for all developers and deployers of AI" and a patchwork of mandates that will
"tamper innovation and deter competition." California is also rapidly advancing a major bill that would impose
onerous restrictions on "frontier" AI models and create a new bureaucracy to administer the rules.

Overregulation also looms at the federal level, with more than 100 AI-related measures pending in Congress. The
Biden administration is simultaneously pursuing unilateral regulation on AI through its "Blueprint for an AI Bill of
Rights," a massive 110+ page executive order, and a litany of new agency directives premised on vague notions of
"algorithmic fairness."

Most of these efforts are premised on the notion that government can preemptively legislate "responsible AI" by
forcing innovators to run new ideas through a maze of bureaucrats to get a permission slip before innovating.
Earlier this year, a top Biden administration tech official called for "a system of AI auditing from the government,"
and suggested the need for "an army of auditors" to ensure "algorithmic accountability." The resulting layers of
technocratic meddling could lead to a death-by-a-thousand-cuts scenario for AI developers.

Undermining a Winning Formula

This is the exact opposite of the more flexible, market-driven approach the Clinton administration and Congress
wisely crafted in the 1990s for the internet, digital commerce, and online speech. Rooted in policy restraint, that
framework protected the freedom to innovate without first needing some bureaucrat's blessing to launch the next
great application or speech platform.

                                                                                                    Page 9 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

If American innovators and values are to shape today's most important technology, we must not shoot ourselves in
the foot as the global AI race heats up. Congress should pause overzealous micromanagement before it is too late.
In the past, lawmakers have used forbearance requirements and moratoriums to protect innovation and
competition, albeit to varying effect.

The Telecommunications Act of 1996 specified that "[n]o State or local statute or regulation, or other State or local
legal requirement, may prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the ability of any entity to provide any interstate or
intrastate telecommunications service." The law included other specific preemptions of state and local regulation, as
well as a provision requiring the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and state regulators to forbear from
regulating in certain instances to enhance competition.

Another portion of the Communications Act meant to "encourage the provision of new technologies and services to
the public" specifies that any party who opposes innovations "shall have the burden to demonstrate that such
proposal is inconsistent with the public interest" and forces the FCC to make a decision within a year. Sadly, the
FCC mostly ignores both this provision and the Telecom Act's forbearance requirements, continuing to overregulate
communications and media markets instead.

Federal moratoria have been more effective in protecting new technologies from bureaucratic meddling and
excessive taxes. Congress passed the Internet Tax Freedom Act of 1998 (made permanent in 2016) to contain the
spread of "multiple and discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce" and internet access. Similarly, the
Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004 made sure federal regulators did not undermine the nascent
market for commercial human spaceflight.

How to Structure an AI Moratorium and Preemption

These and other laws could provide a template for how to craft a moratorium or preemption for AI regulation. An AI
learning period moratorium should block the establishment of any new general-purpose AI regulatory bureaucracy,
disallow new licensing schemes, block open-ended algorithmic liability, and preempt confusing state and local
regulatory enactments that interfere with the establishment of a competitive national marketplace in advanced
algorithmic services.

An AI learning period moratorium would have many benefits. First, it would create breathing space for new types of
algorithmic innovation to grow. This is especially important for smaller AI firms and the open-source AI marketplace,
both of which could be decimated by premature overregulation of a still-developing sector.

Second, an AI regulatory moratorium would give policymakers and technology experts the chance to determine
what problems deserve greater scrutiny and potential regulation. This pragmatic policy approach would limit
damage from rash decisions and help us gain knowledge by testing predictions and policies before advancing new
rules.

A learning period moratorium on new AI regulations does not mean zero regulation, however. Many existing laws
and regulations already cover any AI-enabled practices that violate civil rights, consumer protections, the
environment, intellectual property, and national security. Policymakers can still enforce those policies where harms
exist and fill gaps as necessary, or they can use less restrictive approaches like transparency and education-based
measures.

A federal AI preemption standard will need to include carve-outs for some areas of traditional state authority
including education, insurance, and law enforcement. But regulatory preemption will be challenging because, as the
"most important general-purpose technology of our era," AI touches almost every field. For better or worse, some
sectors and issues must be left to the province of state and local governments.

Where a national framework proves untenable, state and local governments should craft harmonized light-touch
frameworks--perhaps in the form of multistate compacts--to avoid burdening the development of a robustly
competitive and innovative national marketplace in AI firms and technologies.

                                                                                                   Page 10 of 22
  Senate Joint Economic Committee Committee Hearing "Artificial Intelligence and Its Potential to Fuel Economic
                          Growth and Improve Governance." Testimony by Adam ....

Review Existing Regulatory Capacity

When formulating an AI moratorium, Congress should simultaneously demand that our government's 439 federal
departments be required to do two other things. First, agencies should study and review existing policies that might
already address algorithmic innovation in their field and consider how AI systems might already be overregulated
under current law. Second, agencies should identify additional ways in which AI technologies might help improve
government services. (It would be wise for state and local governments to engage in a similar review, although it
need not be mandated by federal law).

The Trump administration's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recommended some of these ideas to
agency heads in a November 2020 guidance memo. "Federal agencies must avoid regulatory or non-regulatory
actions that needlessly hamper AI innovation and growth," the OMB memo ordered. "Fostering AI innovation and
growth through forbearing from new regulation may be appropriate," and "agencies must avoid a precautionary
approach that holds AI systems to an impossibly high standard such that society cannot enjoy their benefits and
that could undermine America's position as the global leader in AI innovation."

Unfortunately, in the wake of recent Biden administration orders and statements, agencies have instead been
encouraged to consider how to expand their regulatory ambitions toward AI, even though Congress has not
authorized such actions.

Conclusion

For the United States to remain the global leader in algorithmic technologies and computational capabilities, AI
policy must be rooted in patience and humility rather than a rush to overregulate. Policymakers must avoid locking
down America's innovative potential and instead pause the panic-based AI regulatory policies under consideration
today.

It is essential that our nation get the policy prerequisites of growth and prosperity right by once again embracing an
innovation culture that positions us as the global leader in advanced computation as the next great technological
race with China and the rest of the world heats up.

(TNSres) -- The University of Washington's School of Medicine issued the following news release:

***

In a paper, academic ethicists criticize tech leaders and others who emphasize calamity thinking with artificial
intelligence.

***

Tech-industry leaders and spotlight-seeking luminaries are monopolizing global discourse about artificial
intelligence (AI), and often conveying that its adoption carries catastrophic risks beyond humans' comprehension.
Doomsayers claim that AI carries "an adverse outcome so bad (that) it would either annihilate Earth-originating
intelligent life or permanently or drastically curtail its potential."

These projections of distant-future disasters -- and the media reporters who invite them -- do a disservice to the
public by taking the focus away from societal problems that AI is causing today, and from consideration of AI's
benefits.

A group of ethicists argue these points in an open-access article published this month in the Journal of Medical
Ethics. Lead author Nancy Jecker is a professor of bioethics at the University of Washington School of Medicine.

"Existential risk, which we call 'X-Risk,' refers to activities that threaten grave dangers to humanity, like nuclear
weapons, climate change and emerging infectious diseases," she said. "These have tremendous capacity to wipe
out large numbers of people and undermine human well-being. We approach them with a balanced risk assessment
that includes risks occurring today."

With AI, here-and-now concerns involve algorithmic bias leading to gender and racial discrimination, AI-generated
child sexual abuse, labor exploitation, especially in poorer countries, and displacement of human creative work.
Misinformation during this election year is another major concern, Jecker said.

Media outlets looking for headline clicks are tempted to instead emphasize AI debates that raise the specter of
distant disaster, she suggested. Likewise, technology leaders who have financial stakes in AI's development know
that ratcheting up public fears about far-off calamities can eclipse consideration of AI's present harms.

"What I'm most concerned about is what's not being said and where the spotlight isn't," Jecker offered. "Most
people in the tech industry don't need to personally worry about being declined for a job or a bank loan because of
a sexist or ableist algorithm, or not being considered for parole because of a racist algorithm."

Technology workers, especially leaders, are overwhelmingly white men without disabilities, and this standpoint
informs their ethics assessments, she suggested.

The authors wrote the paper with the hope of broadening AI ethics conversation to include not only technologically
aware voices but also those who are historically marginalized and whose opportunities are at risk.

The paper cited a Stanford University 2023 analysis of scholarly AI ethics literature that saw a shift away from
academic authors and toward authors with tech-industry affiliations; tech authors produced 71% more publications
than academics between 2014 and 2022.

"Tech workers lack formal training in ethics," Jecker said. "They can tell us about choices to be made within AI, but
they shouldn't lead ethics debates in the public square. Not only are tech leaders not trained to do so, but they also
have a conflict of interest, given their work in that industry."

One example of positive direction for AI discourse, Jecker said, is the public-private partnership just announced by
the University of Washington and the University of Tsukuba in Japan, with private sector investment by Amazon,
Nvidia and other companies. The project aims to further research, entrepreneurship, workforce development and
social implementation of artificial intelligence

"We need to engage in cross-border efforts that involve diverse groups from different sectors of society to come
together to work through complex issues," Jecker said.

Catastrophe-fixated comments can also divert attention from AI benefits in areas like medicine, the authors wrote.
They referenced AI's ability to help radiologists identify high-risk patient cases, to advance precision medicine
based on genomic analysis, and to scour large datasets to better predict patient outcomes.

"A balanced approach to AI must weigh benefits as well as risks," Jecker said.

(TNSres) -- The University of Alabama issued the following news:

A doctoral candidate at The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) is lead author of a new study in the
International Journal of Production Research investigating the ways social media platforms can be leveraged with
artificial intelligence (AI) to provide vital communication connecting victims of disaster to outside aid and support.
Vishwa Vijay Kumar, a PhD student of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at UAH, a
part of the University of Alabama System, teamed with fellow UAH co-researchers Dr. Avimanyu Sahoo and Dr.
Sampson Gholston, as well as Kumar's mentor, Dr. Siva K. Balasubramanian of the Illinois Institute of Technology,
to support the initiative.

For the project, the team used data from X, formerly known as Twitter, from two six-week time periods and two
countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: March-April 2020 in the United States when the pandemic broke out, and
in India during the surge of the delta variant in May-June 2021. Disruptions in health care supply chains during
these periods were causing severe shortages of essential equipment ranging from face masks and medicines to
ventilators for patients in intensive care.

"I was born and raised in the countryside of India, in Sitamarhi, Bihar, near the Nepal border, where natural
disasters such as floods from the Himalayan rivers are frequent," Kumar says to explain the initial spark driving his
vision to help. "These floods can spread over miles, trapping thousands of people in their homes who need urgent
help for healthcare and food, as well as rescue operations. From a young age, I was driven to develop a framework
that would enable people in need to communicate their requirements to the world and relevant authorities so they
coordinate to assist disaster victims on time."

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 presented a disaster of a different kind, affecting billions of people worldwide and
exposing significant vulnerabilities in global healthcare supply chains. Critical shortages of essential supplies like
testing kits, oxygen cylinders and hospital beds highlighted the urgent need for efficient resource allocation and
real-time information.

                                                                                                Page 2 of 3
      UAH Researcher Publishes Study Tapping Social Media and AI to Speed Supply Chain Assistance During
                                                 Disasters

"This situation reignited my early motivation to explore how social media and AI could be harnessed for faster
disaster response and to mitigate health and supply challenges during crises," Kumar says. "I discussed this idea
with Dr. Sahoo, my PhD academic advisor."

The research that followed presented a four-step process and developed algorithms to parse information from 3.9
million tweets to identify imperative information using AI and machine learning. Keywords within Twitter posts were
identified to indicate which tweets included information relevant to pandemic supply chain disruptions and
processed them for content analysis and modeling. Tweets were categorized as "imperative," or actionable pleas
for help, and "non-imperative," providing non-actionable information. The data analyzed also estimated the
geographic location of imperative tweets lacking geo-tag information to facilitate coordination of aid operations.

Additionally, the researchers identified a number of healthcare supply chain challenges during disaster conditions
that are the focus for future research. Topics included geo-location of people in need who posted their concerns on
social media without identifying their location; forecasting COVID-19 vaccine supplies; forecasting the availability of
health and food supplies; use of other social media (for example, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and finding where
these improvements would be applicable to other disaster events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes.

"We also plan to develop a platform/tool that will scan the social media posts from the disaster events and
generate real-time reports of demand and supply issues and people with their geo-locations requesting help,"
Kumar concludes.

(TNSres) -- The Technical University of Munich issued the following news:

The Technical University of Munich (TUM) and the provider of business information Creditreform have launched a
comprehensive cooperation to research various aspects of environmental, social, and management responsibility in
companies (Environmental Social Governance). A central concern of the collaboration is the quality of data and
information in order to effectively combat so-called greenwashing, i.e., the deliberate pretense of sustainable
business practices.

To this end, advanced methods are to be developed to assess the relevant company data. Artificial intelligence
(AI) plays an important role here to be able to accurately assess compliance with the often elusive sustainability
criteria using simulations.

TUM is also expanding its Integrative Research Institute Munich Data Science Institute (MDSI) and contributing its
academic expertise and leading researchers in the field of AI and data science under the leadership of Prof. Gjergji
Kasneci to the collaboration. Following the acquisition of a Konrad Zuse School, this new project demonstrates
once again that projects launched with funding from the Excellence Initiative can develop powerfully and be scaled
up with third-party financing.

President Thomas F. Hofmann emphasized the importance of this partnership with Creditreform: "For us, it is a
prototype of the synergies between university research and entrepreneurial application. In this collaboration, we are
creating new insights from the combination of scientific AI expertise and data from the business world."

Creditreform CEO Bernd Butow adds: "The cooperation is a milestone in the development of an AI-supported
methodology for evaluating and processing data to assess ESG risks. The combination of academic research and
our expertise as a credit agency in the context of sustainability information and reporting, among other things, is a
real driver of innovation in the field of data analysis."

(HTA). It is located in GALILEO on the Garching research campus but works across all locations.

The following initiatives and facilities are assigned to the MDSI:

* One example of a domain-specific MDSI activity is the TUM Georg Nemetschek Institute - Artificial Intelligence
for the Built World. It was founded under the umbrella of the MDSI with the support of a 50 million euro donation
from the Nemetschek Innovation Foundation in 2020. Here, research on AI and machine learning applications is
bundled along the entire life cycle of buildings - from planning to construction and sustainable management.

* The MDSI is also home to the AI Future Lab AI for Earth Observation (AI4EO), funded by the Federal Ministry of
Education and Research and headed by Xiaoxiang Zhu, one of the five MDSI directors. AI4EO combines TUM's
strengths in geodesy & earth observation, satellite technology, mathematics, AI, and ethics to develop reliable
models of global urbanization, food supply, and natural disaster management.

* The Center for Digital Medicine and Health is being built under the umbrella of the MDSI as a new federally/state-
funded research building to bring the core competencies of computer science to the medical campus of the TUM
University Hospital "rechts der Isar". Under the leadership of MDSI Director Daniel Ruckert, the focus is on the
development of data-driven approaches and AI methods in medicine - from the early detection and diagnosis of
diseases to the identification of biomarkers for individualized and personalized treatments, to ethics, security, and
data protection in the use of patient data.

* The Munich Center for Machine Learning (MCML) - under the joint leadership of TUM and LMU - is funded by the
BMBF and the HighTech Agenda Bayern as one of the National AI Competence Centers. The TUM branch of the
MCML is integrated into the MDSI infrastructure and is led by Daniel Cremers, one of the MDSI directors. He also
heads the TUM part of the ELLIS Unit Munich, which is managed jointly with Helmholtz Munich within the European
Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS).

* Since 2022, the DAAD has funded the Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI - jointly coordinated by
TUM and LMU. The MDSI hosts the office of the Konrad Zuse School and is headed by MDSI Executive Director
Stephan Gunnemann. MSc and PhD candidates are trained in developing reliable AI technologies - including
scientific knowledge, business expertise, and industrial experience. They conduct cutting-edge research to make AI
ready for use in areas of public interest, with all its implications for reliability, security, and privacy.

HUNTSVILLE, Ala., July 3 -- The University of Alabama in Huntsville issued the following news release:

A doctoral candidate at The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) is lead author of a new study in the
International Journal of Production Research investigating the ways social media platforms can be leveraged with
artificial intelligence (AI) to provide vital communication connecting victims of disaster to outside aid and support.
Vishwa Vijay Kumar, a PhD student of Industrial & Systems Engineering and Engineering Management at UAH, a
part of the University of Alabama System, teamed with fellow UAH co-researchers Dr. Avimanyu Sahoo and Dr.
Sampson Gholston, as well as Kumar's mentor, Dr. Siva K. Balasubramanian of the Illinois Institute of Technology,
to support the initiative.

For the project, the team used data from X, formerly known as Twitter, from two six-week time periods and two
countries during the COVID-19 pandemic: March-April 2020 in the United States when the pandemic broke out, and
in India during the surge of the delta variant in May-June 2021. Disruptions in health care supply chains during
these periods were causing severe shortages of essential equipment ranging from face masks and medicines to
ventilators for patients in intensive care.

"I was born and raised in the countryside of India, in Sitamarhi, Bihar, near the Nepal border, where natural
disasters such as floods from the Himalayan rivers are frequent," Kumar says to explain the initial spark driving his
vision to help. "These floods can spread over miles, trapping thousands of people in their homes who need urgent
help for healthcare and food, as well as rescue operations. From a young age, I was driven to develop a framework
that would enable people in need to communicate their requirements to the world and relevant authorities so they
coordinate to assist disaster victims on time."

The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 presented a disaster of a different kind, affecting billions of people worldwide and
exposing significant vulnerabilities in global healthcare supply chains. Critical shortages of essential supplies like
testing kits, oxygen cylinders and hospital beds highlighted the urgent need for efficient resource allocation and
real-time information.

"This situation reignited my early motivation to explore how social media and AI could be harnessed for faster
disaster response and to mitigate health and supply challenges during crises," Kumar says. "I discussed this idea
with Dr. Sahoo, my PhD academic advisor."

                                                                             Page 2 of 3
    UAH RESEARCHER PUBLISHES STUDY TAPPING SOCIAL MEDIA AND AI TO SPEED SUPPLY CHAIN
                             ASSISTANCE DURING DISASTERS

The research that followed presented a four-step process and developed algorithms to parse information from 3.9
million tweets to identify imperative information using AI and machine learning. Keywords within Twitter posts were
identified to indicate which tweets included information relevant to pandemic supply chain disruptions and
processed them for content analysis and modeling. Tweets were categorized as "imperative," or actionable pleas
for help, and "non-imperative," providing non-actionable information. The data analyzed also estimated the
geographic location of imperative tweets lacking geo-tag information to facilitate coordination of aid operations.

Additionally, the researchers identified a number of healthcare supply chain challenges during disaster conditions
that are the focus for future research. Topics included geo-location of people in need who posted their concerns on
social media without identifying their location; forecasting COVID-19 vaccine supplies; forecasting the availability of
health and food supplies; use of other social media (for example, Facebook, Instagram, etc.) and finding where
these improvements would be applicable to other disaster events, such as hurricanes and earthquakes.

"We also plan to develop a platform/tool that will scan the social media posts from the disaster events and
generate real-time reports of demand and supply issues and people with their geo-locations requesting help,"
Kumar concludes.

BLACKSBURG, Va., Aug. 19 -- Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University issued the following news
release:

On the morning of Aug. 5, Category 1 Hurricane Debby made landfall near Steinhatchee, Florida, then moved up
the East Coast. The storm flooded nearly 2,200 square kilometers, or 850 square miles, between Florida and New
York, according to new findings from Virginia Tech's Earth Observation and Innovation Lab.

By Aug. 9, more than 35 million people from South Carolina to Vermont were under flood alerts. Berkeley County,
South Carolina, saw as much as 14 inches of rain with Charleston reaching 15 inches. Cities and counties along the
U.S. Atlantic Coast are already vulnerable to flooding caused by land subsidence and sea level rise, a recent
Virginia Tech study found.

Associate Professor Manoochehr Shirzaei and his team tracked Debby's impact by leveraging artificial
intelligence (AI) and big radar satellite data acquired by Sentinel-1 satellites operated by European Space Agency.

Radar microwave signals penetrate clouds and capture detailed images of the Earth's surface, allowing for accurate
detection of floodwaters. Radar can measure changes in water levels, track flood progression, and provide critical
data for emergency response and disaster management.

Shrizaei's team found that nearly 2,200 square kilometers were flooded during and after Debby's landfall between
Florida and New York with 1.5 percent of the land area in nine counties inundated. Seven counties experienced
more than 35 square kilometers of inundation.

Debby is the fourth hurricane since 2000 to hit Florida in early August. Its heavy rain and strong winds may be
linked to a warming atmosphere and oceans, which can hold more moisture.

"As extreme weather events like Debby become more common, it's crucial to rethink how we develop flood-prone
areas along the U.S. East Coast," Shirzaei said. "Investing in resilient infrastructure and promoting public
awareness are essential steps in preparing for and adapting to future floodings." For any query with respect to this

Rep. Don Beyer, D-Virginia, issued the following news release:

Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean
Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), founder and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus
and a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Representative Anna Eshoo (CA-16), co-
chair of the House AI Caucus, and Representative Don Beyer (VA-08), vice-chair of the House AI Caucus, today
introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024. The legislation would direct the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards to measure and report the full range of artificial
intelligence's (AI) environmental impacts, as well as create a voluntary framework for AI developers to report
environmental impacts.

The legislation also requires an interagency study to investigate and measure both the positive and negative
environmental impacts of AI. While researchers increasingly highlight that AI can help tackle environmental
challenges, such as by accelerating clean energy innovation, providing better weather forecasts, and improving
cooling efficiency, the rapid growth of AI also comes with environmental harms. For example, increasing AI use
could contribute to data center electricity demand doubling by 2026, leading to more carbon emissions. Demand for
water to cool data centers is already creating concerns about water supplies, and the chips needed to run AI
software are contributing to a growing mountain of electronic waste.

"There is a Dickensian quality to the use of AI when it comes to our environment: It can make our planet better, and
it can make our planet worse," said Senator Markey. "Our AI Environmental Impacts Act would set clear standards
and voluntary reporting guidelines to measure AI's impact on our environment. The development of the next
generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet. I thank Senator Heinrich,
Representative Eshoo, and Representative Beyer, for their partnership in making sure that AI contributes to a more
livable future for generations to come."

"AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but that comes with high environmental costs," said Representative
Eshoo. "The resources necessary to research and develop AI are intensive, and as AI systems grow in scale and
become more widely used across various sectors of society, it's critical to understand the environmental impacts of

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 5
      Markey, Heinrich, Eshoo, Beyer Introduce Legislation to Investigate, Measure Environmental Impacts of
                                              Artificial Intelligence

AI development and use. I'm proud to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act to conduct a
comprehensive study on AI's environmental impacts, identify standards needed to measure those impacts, and
create a system for AI developers to report the full range of their environmental impacts."

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Representative Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease
emissions in other sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible
with the adverse impacts it may have on our environment now."

A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Specifically, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act would:

The legislation is endorsed by Hugging Face, Data and Society, Climate Change AI, Public Citizen, Sierra Club,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Greenpeace USA, Center for AI and Digital Policy, Friends of the Earth
Action, Kairos Action, Eko, Accountable Tech, Encode Justice, Union of Concerned Scientists, Fidutam, Green
Web Foundation, Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance, and Access Now.

"Recent advances in AI have great potential to help us tackle big societal challenges," said Emma Strubell,
Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "However, there is increasing evidence that the development
and use of AI can have a negative impact on the environment due to unprecedented computational requirements.
Our understanding of the true scale and scope of these impacts is still nascent, limited by access to the necessary
data and standards for reporting. Senator Markey's AI Environmental Impacts Act provides a roadmap for
elucidating the complex relationship between AI and the environment, which will be critical to ensuring that AI
technology is developed and deployed so as to have a net positive impact on our environment and society."

"The environmental impacts of AI technologies are undeniable - from the energy to power model training, and
deployment, to the water needed to cool data centers and the rare earth metals to manufacture the hardware," said
Dr. Sasha Luccioni, Climate Lead at Hugging Face. "This bill will help shed some much-needed light on the extent
of these impacts and how they're evolving over time."

"Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's legislation will address a critical, yet underexplored aspect of AI - its
environmental footprint," said Dr. Roy Schwartz, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "The bill
will promote transparency regarding the environmental aspects of AI tools, allowing organizations to both report
and, as a result, mitigate their negative environmental effects. This act could not have come at a better time, as
these tools are becoming ubiquitous, requiring larger amounts of energy to build and deploy them, water for cooling
their servers, and land to build data centers for them."

"This legislation provides a crucial step towards aligning society's use of AI with climate change goals, by helping
us measure the impacts of AI's inputs and applications, and therefore take more targeted action to shape those
impacts," said Dr. Priya Donti, Co-founder and Chair of Climate Change AI.

"As the use of AI rapidly increases, society needs to understand how this new technology impacts the
environment," said Erik Kojola, Senior Climate Research Specialist at Greenpeace USA. "This means we need a
rigorous system for tracking energy use and carbon emissions. The Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts
Act of 2024 is a vital step in creating that system and studying how AI contributes to the climate crisis. This will
bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the emerging AI industry."

"The Center for AI and Digital Policy strongly supports the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act," said
Merve Hickok, President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's bold
initiative addresses one of the greatest challenges in the AI sector - the possible acceleration of climate change.

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 5

                                              Artificial Intelligence

We need research and analysis to assess the environmental impact of AI systems. The AI Environments Impacts
Act should be a top priority for Senate consideration."

"Artificial Intelligence has become the latest tool in the Silicon Valley corporate race, with every company trying to
put out AI-driven products in order to stay competitive," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action. "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us -- we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"By creating transparency around AI's impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental
Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop
their products in line with our collective health and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator
Markey and Senator Heinrich for introducing this Bill that will provide a roadmap toward positive outcomes."

"One of the many unknowns about AI is its impact on the environment," said Kaili Lambe, Policy and Advocacy
Director at Accountable Tech. "As rapid advances have led to increasingly widespread use of LLMs and other data-
intensive AI systems, it's imperative that we understand and take steps to mitigate unintended harm, including the
potential for environmental degradation. Too often transparency takes a backseat when it comes to Big Tech
innovation. Senators Markey and Heinrich's legislation offers an opportunity to gain critical insight into the
environmental impact of AI, and we are eager to see it pass."

"AI technologies are spreading rapidly, with the potential for major impacts on society," said Jennifer Jones,
Director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We must fully understand
both the benefits and the risks, of these technologies--including intensive energy consumption and creation of
environmental waste that harms people and nature. We have a responsibility to track the environmental impacts of
AI, to ensure this information is publicly available and to help us plan to mitigate those harms. Importantly, the bill
will allow stakeholders, including civil society, to examine and report on the full life cycle of artificial intelligence
models, systems, and hardware--bringing the voices of the most impacted communities to the table."

"Right now, we have only a limited understanding of the depth and scale of AI's environmental impacts--but what
we do know is alarming," said Brian J. Chen, Policy Director at Data & Society. "AI's massive energy consumption
and pollution effects are likely to exacerbate global warming and climate disaster. The AI Environmental Impacts
Act lays an important research foundation for a better-grounded understanding of the technology's harms to people,
communities, and habitats."

                                                                                                   Page 4 of 5

                                              Artificial Intelligence

"What gets measured gets managed," said Michelle Thorne, Director of Strategy and Partnerships at the Green
Web Foundation. "We at the Green Web Foundation welcome this bill as an important step towards transparency of
the environmental impacts of AI. To date, the lack of consistent and comparable data has been a blocker for
technologists, researchers, policymakers and civil society. This bill will help enable more data-informed discussions
about how resources are allocated to computing."

PR NewswirePITTSBURGH, May 1, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Expedient, a leading provider of cloud infrastructure and
managed services, has unveiled its latest innovation: the Secure AI Gateway. This corporate-ready offering is
designed to simplify access and maximize the value of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) for enterprises and
organizations of all sizes.

 "The productivity boost that AI delivers is undeniable and increasingly well documented. But as more and more
users embrace it in their everyday work, the risk of leaking sensitive or confidential information goes up
exponentially, which represents a material risk for an organization,"says Bryan Smith, CEO at Expedient. "Secure
AI Gateway gives organizations a foundation for using AI in a safe, transparent, and scalable way." According to a
451 Research's recent Voice of the Enterprise: AI & Machine Learning, Infrastructure study1, security is the top
concern of organizations when considering their AI/ML implementation. Additionally, the report revealed widespread
concerns about reliability and ease of use.Expedient's newSecure AI Gatewayaddresses these concerns head-on.
To prevent the sharing of proprietary data externally, the gateway can be configured to block the release of
sensitive data or personally identifiable information to public AI models. Users securely access approved AI models
through single-sign-on (SSO) authentication connected to an organization's user directory, allowing administrators
to monitor usage. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) provides organizations with the ability to control what data
and AI models users have access to based on their role, and integrated observability tools deliver a comprehensive
view of usage and identify security vulnerabilities.Expedient's Secure AI Gateway supports multiple AI models
simultaneously and delivers out-of-the-box access to leading models like OpenAI's GPT-4, Meta's LLAMA,
Anthropic's Claude, Mistral's Mixtral, and Cohere's Command, along with others.With a full suite of text and image-

Bill Text (PDF)

Washington (February 1, 2024) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), founder and co-
chair of the Senate AI Caucus and a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
Representative Anna Eshoo (CA-16), co-chair of the House AI Caucus, and Representative Don Beyer (VA-08),
vice-chair of the House AI Caucus, today introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024.
The legislation would direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards to
measure and report the full range of artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental impacts, as well as create a
voluntary framework for AI developers to report environmental impacts.

The legislation also requires an interagency study to investigate and measure both the positive and negative
environmental impacts of AI. While researchers increasingly highlight that AI can help tackle environmental
challenges, such as by accelerating clean energy innovation, providing better weather forecasts, and improving
cooling efficiency, the rapid growth of AI also comes with environmental harms. For example, increasing AI use
could contribute to data center electricity demand doubling by 2026, leading to more carbon emissions. Demand for
water to cool data centers is already creating concerns about water supplies, and the chips needed to run AI
software are contributing to a growing mountain of electronic waste.

"There is a Dickensian quality to the use of AI when it comes to our environment: It can make our planet better, and
it can make our planet worse," said Senator Markey. "Our AI Environmental Impacts Act would set clear standards
and voluntary reporting guidelines to measure AI's impact on our environment. The development of the next
generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet. I thank Senator Heinrich,
Representative Eshoo, and Representative Beyer, for their partnership in making sure that AI contributes to a more
livable future for generations to come."

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 5

                                              Artificial Intelligence

"AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but that comes with high environmental costs," said Representative
Eshoo. "The resources necessary to research and develop AI are intensive, and as AI systems grow in scale and
become more widely used across various sectors of society, it's critical to understand the environmental impacts of
AI development and use. I'm proud to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act to conduct a
comprehensive study on AI's environmental impacts, identify standards needed to measure those impacts, and
create a system for AI developers to report the full range of their environmental impacts."

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Representative Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease
emissions in other sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible
with the adverse impacts it may have on our environment now."

A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Specifically, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act would:

Require a Study on the Environmental Impacts of AI: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would conduct a
comprehensive study on the environmental impact of AI within two years. The study would examine AI models and
hardware's lifecycle, including energy consumption, pollution, and e-waste, as well as assess the positive and
negative environmental impacts of AI's applications.

Convene an AI Environmental Impacts Consortium: NIST would convene a consortium of stakeholders to identify
measurement needs and standards for AI's environmental impacts.

Create a Voluntary Reporting System: NIST would develop a system for entities developing or operating AI to
voluntarily report the full range of AI's environmental impacts.

Direct a Report to Congress: Within four years, the EPA, the Department of Energy, and NIST would submit a joint
report to Congress, detailing the consortium's findings and describing the voluntary reporting system, as well as
providing recommendations for further legislative and executive action.

The legislation is endorsed by Hugging Face, Data and Society, Climate Change AI, Public Citizen, Sierra Club,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Greenpeace USA, Center for AI and Digital Policy, Friends of the Earth
Action, Kairos Action, Eko, Accountable Tech, Encode Justice, Union of Concerned Scientists, Fidutam, Green
Web Foundation, Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance, and Access Now.

"Recent advances in AI have great potential to help us tackle big societal challenges," said Emma Strubell,
Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "However, there is increasing evidence that the development
and use of AI can have a negative impact on the environment due to unprecedented computational requirements.
Our understanding of the true scale and scope of these impacts is still nascent, limited by access to the necessary
data and standards for reporting. Senator Markey's AI Environmental Impacts Act provides a roadmap for
elucidating the complex relationship between AI and the environment, which will be critical to ensuring that AI
technology is developed and deployed so as to have a net positive impact on our environment and society."

"The environmental impacts of AI technologies are undeniable - from the energy to power model training, and
deployment, to the water needed to cool data centers and the rare earth metals to manufacture the hardware," said
Dr. Sasha Luccioni, Climate Lead at Hugging Face. "This bill will help shed some much-needed light on the extent
of these impacts and how they're evolving over time."

"Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's legislation will address a critical, yet underexplored aspect of AI - its
environmental footprint," said Dr. Roy Schwartz, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "The bill
will promote transparency regarding the environmental aspects of AI tools, allowing organizations to both report

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 5
      Markey, Heinrich, Eshoo, Beyer Introduce Legislation to Investigate, Measure Environmental Impacts of

and, as a result, mitigate their negative environmental effects. This act could not have come at a better time, as
these tools are becoming ubiquitous, requiring larger amounts of energy to build and deploy them, water for cooling
their servers, and land to build data centers for them."

"This legislation provides a crucial step towards aligning society's use of AI with climate change goals, by helping
us measure the impacts of AI's inputs and applications, and therefore take more targeted action to shape those
impacts," said Dr. Priya Donti, Co-founder and Chair of Climate Change AI.

"As the use of AI rapidly increases, society needs to understand how this new technology impacts the
environment," said Erik Kojola, Senior Climate Research Specialist at Greenpeace USA. "This means we need a
rigorous system for tracking energy use and carbon emissions. The Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts
Act of 2024 is a vital step in creating that system and studying how AI contributes to the climate crisis. This will
bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the emerging AI industry."

"The Center for AI and Digital Policy strongly supports the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act," said
Merve Hickok, President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's bold
initiative addresses one of the greatest challenges in the AI sector - the possible acceleration of climate change.
We need research and analysis to assess the environmental impact of AI systems. The AI Environments Impacts
Act should be a top priority for Senate consideration."

"Artificial Intelligence has become the latest tool in the Silicon Valley corporate race, with every company trying to
put out AI-driven products in order to stay competitive," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action. "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us -- we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"By creating transparency around AI's impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental
Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop
their products in line with our collective health and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator
Markey and Senator Heinrich for introducing this Bill that will provide a roadmap toward positive outcomes."

"One of the many unknowns about AI is its impact on the environment," said Kaili Lambe, Policy and Advocacy
Director at Accountable Tech. "As rapid advances have led to increasingly widespread use of LLMs and other data-
intensive AI systems, it's imperative that we understand and take steps to mitigate unintended harm, including the
potential for environmental degradation. Too often transparency takes a backseat when it comes to Big Tech

                                                                                                   Page 4 of 5

innovation. Senators Markey and Heinrich's legislation offers an opportunity to gain critical insight into the
environmental impact of AI, and we are eager to see it pass."

"AI technologies are spreading rapidly, with the potential for major impacts on society," said Jennifer Jones,
Director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We must fully understand
both the benefits and the risks, of these technologies--including intensive energy consumption and creation of
environmental waste that harms people and nature. We have a responsibility to track the environmental impacts of
AI, to ensure this information is publicly available and to help us plan to mitigate those harms. Importantly, the bill
will allow stakeholders, including civil society, to examine and report on the full life cycle of artificial intelligence
models, systems, and hardware--bringing the voices of the most impacted communities to the table."

"Right now, we have only a limited understanding of the depth and scale of AI's environmental impacts--but what
we do know is alarming," said Brian J. Chen, Policy Director at Data & Society. "AI's massive energy consumption
and pollution effects are likely to exacerbate global warming and climate disaster. The AI Environmental Impacts
Act lays an important research foundation for a better-grounded understanding of the technology's harms to people,
communities, and habitats."

"What gets measured gets managed," said Michelle Thorne, Director of Strategy and Partnerships at the Green
Web Foundation. "We at the Green Web Foundation welcome this bill as an important step towards transparency of
the environmental impacts of AI. To date, the lack of consistent and comparable data has been a blocker for
technologists, researchers, policymakers and civil society. This bill will help enable more data-informed discussions
about how resources are allocated to computing."

"Friends of the Earth Action is proud to endorse the bill to address the climate concerns of artificial intelligence,"
said Michael Khoo, Climate Disinformation Program Director at Friends of the Earth Action. "In addition to
generating even more disinformation around the climate crisis, AI comes at an enormous energy cost that must be
made transparent. Congress should not make the same mistake of simply trusting AI companies to do good, the
way they did with social media over the last two decades. We call on lawmakers to support this bill for the sake of
our planet."

put out AI-driven products in order to stay competitive," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action. "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us -- we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"By creating transparency around AI's impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental
Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop
their products in line with our collective health and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator
Markey and Senator Heinrich for introducing this Bill that will provide a roadmap toward positive outcomes."

"One of the many unknowns about AI is its impact on the environment," said Kaili Lambe, Policy and Advocacy
Director at Accountable Tech. "As rapid advances have led to increasingly widespread use of LLMs and other data-
intensive AI systems, it's imperative that we understand and take steps to mitigate unintended harm, including the
potential for environmental degradation. Too often transparency takes a backseat when it comes to Big Tech
innovation. Senators Markey and Heinrich's legislation offers an opportunity to gain critical insight into the
environmental impact of AI, and we are eager to see it pass."

"AI technologies are spreading rapidly, with the potential for major impacts on society," said Jennifer Jones,
Director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We must fully understand
both the benefits and the risks, of these technologies--including intensive energy consumption and creation of
environmental waste that harms people and nature. We have a responsibility to track the environmental impacts of
AI, to ensure this information is publicly available and to help us plan to mitigate those harms. Importantly, the bill

will allow stakeholders, including civil society, to examine and report on the full life cycle of artificial intelligence
models, systems, and hardware--bringing the voices of the most impacted communities to the table."

"Right now, we have only a limited understanding of the depth and scale of AI's environmental impacts--but what
we do know is alarming," said Brian J. Chen, Policy Director at Data and Society. "AI's massive energy
consumption and pollution effects are likely to exacerbate global warming and climate disaster. The AI
Environmental Impacts Act lays an important research foundation for a better-grounded understanding of the
technology's harms to people, communities, and habitats."

"What gets measured gets managed," said Michelle Thorne, Director of Strategy and Partnerships at the Green
Web Foundation. "We at the Green Web Foundation welcome this bill as an important step towards transparency of
the environmental impacts of AI. To date, the lack of consistent and comparable data has been a blocker for
technologists, researchers, policymakers and civil society. This bill will help enable more data-informed discussions
about how resources are allocated to computing."

"Friends of the Earth Action is proud to endorse the bill to address the climate concerns of artificial intelligence,"
said Michael Khoo, Climate Disinformation Program Director at Friends of the Earth Action. "In addition to
generating even more disinformation around the climate crisis, AI comes at an enormous energy cost that must be
made transparent. Congress should not make the same mistake of simply trusting AI companies to do good, the
way they did with social media over the last two decades. We call on lawmakers to support this bill for the sake of
our planet."

Kelsey Doerksen

8 Mar 2024

Kelsey Doerksen is a PhD student in Autonomous Intelligent Machines and Systems at the Department of
Computer Science, and the President of the Oxford Womxn in Computer Science Society. She is also a Giga Data
Science Fellow at UNICEF and a Visiting Researcher at European Space Agency.

There is enormous potential for artificial intelligence (AI) tools to benefit society; from early detection of diseases,
to natural disaster response, to helping us write succinct emails. But these technologies need to be viewed under a
critical lens to ensure that we are building tools to help, and not harm society.

When we are thinking about reducing bias in AI models, we need to start with the datasets we are using to teach
them. AI models are being trained on datasets which we know have systematically left minorities out of the picture;
resulting in data that lacks diverse representation of gender identities, sexual orientations, and race, among others.
AI can be a powerful tool to mitigate human-induced bias because it is a data-driven approach to decision making,
but if the data it is using has biases, this becomes an issue. For example, we have seen generative AI adopting
stereotypes and biases when generating images of certain professions that we typically associated with men or
women in the past.

In addition to bias mitigation from a data perspective, it is critical that the diversity of users of an AI product are
represented at the development stage. Improving gender representation in AI and Computer Science (CS) is
something I am very passionate about, and being a part of the Oxford Womxn in Computer Science Society
(OxWoCS) for the past three years has been transformative to my experience as a woman in the field.

The success of the society speaks for itself, we have grown to 250+ members with over 750 people on our mailing
list, providing academic, career and social opportunities to the CS community at Oxford University across all levels
of study and research. My experience leading OxWoCS as the 2023-24 President has been one of the highlights of
my DPhil. It has been incredibly rewarding to connect with so many women in the field who are equally as
passionate about their research as they are about building a welcoming and safe community for gender minorities
in the space.

                                                                                                     Page 2 of 2
                                    CAN AI BE A FORCE FOR INCLUSION?

My hopes for the future of women in the fields of AI and CS is that we continue to champion and advocate for one
another to build stronger communities that celebrate the diversity of experiences that we bring to the table.

* 'Artificial intelligence and gender equality: how can we make AI a force for inclusion?' was the topic of a panel
discussion co-hosted by the Vice-Chancellor Professor Irene Tracey CBE, FRS, FMedSci and Professor Tim
Soutphommasane, Chief Diversity Officer on 6 March 2024 ahead of International Women's Day.

The following information was released by the Department of Homeland Security:

DHS Will Launch Three Pilot Projects to Test AI Technology to Enhance Immigration Officer Training, Help
Communities Build Resilience and Reduce Burden for Applying for Disaster Relief Grants, and Improve Efficiency
of Law Enforcement Investigations

Today, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Chief Information Officer and Chief Artificial
Intelligence Officer Eric Hysen announced the Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) first "Artificial
Intelligence Roadmap." The roadmap details DHS's 2024 plans, including to test uses of the technologies that
deliver meaningful benefits to the American public and advance homeland security, while ensuring that individuals'
privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected.

As part of the roadmap, DHS announced three innovative pilot projects that will deploy AI in specific mission areas.
Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) will test AI to enhance investigative processes focused on detecting
fentanyl and increasing efficiency of investigations related to combatting child sexual exploitation. The Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will deploy AI to help communities plan for and develop hazard mitigation
plans to build resilience and minimize risks. And, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) will
use AI to improve immigration officer training.

"The unprecedented speed and potential of AI's development and adoption presents both enormous opportunities
to advance our mission and risks we must mitigate," said Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro N. Mayorkas.
"The DHS AI roadmap and pilots will guide our efforts this year to strengthen our national security, improve our
operations, and provide more efficient services to the American people, while upholding our commitment to protect
civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy. What we learn from the pilot projects will be beneficial in shaping how the
Department can effectively and responsibly use AI across the homeland security enterprise moving forward."

The roadmap lays out DHS's initiatives in AI, describes the potential of AI technologies across the Department, and
offers clearer visibility into the Department's approach to AI, while underscoring the Department's commitment to
responsible utilization.

                                                                           Page 2 of 4

    ANNOUNCES PILOT PROJECTS TO MAXIMIZE BENEFITS OF TECHNOLOGY, ADVANCE HOMELAND
                                     SECURITY ....

The AI roadmap outlines three lines of effort DHS is using to guide its work:

Responsibly leverage AI to advance Homeland Security missions while protecting individuals' privacy, civil rights,
and civil liberties DHS is committed to ensuring that its use of AI fully respects privacy, civil liberties, and civil rights,
is rigorously tested to avoid bias, disparate impact, privacy harms, and other risks, and that it is understandable to
the people we serve.

Promote Nationwide AI Safety and Security Advances in AI will revolutionize the delivery of essential goods and
services upon which Americans rely. AI can create tremendous efficiencies and benefits for citizens, but it can also
present new and novel risks. To protect U.S. cyber networks and critical infrastructure, DHS will help govern the
safe and responsible development and use of AI.

Continue to lead in AI through strong cohesive partnerships DHS will foster strong relationships with private sector,
academia, State, Local, Territorial, and Tribal governments, international partners, non-government organizations,
research institutions, and thought leaders to accelerate the development and deployment of AI solutions tailored to
the unique challenges faced by the DHS. In line with the DHS's commitment to transparency and visibility into the
Department's vision for AI and to ensuring responsible use, DHS will continue to share information and engage with
communities, advocates, and partners to demonstrate responsible AI use.

DHS's three new pilot programs will allow the Department to assess the efficacy of AI in improving its mission
capabilities. Each pilot team is partnering with privacy, cybersecurity, and civil rights and civil liberties experts
throughout their development and evaluation process. This work will inform Department-wide policies on AI
governance. DHS offices and agencies submitted dozens of proposals for consideration to the Chief AI Officer, who
selected three pilots that would best support evaluating the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLM) and
Generative AI technology at DHS.

The new pilot programs announced today will:

Transform Security Investigative Processes, Unlock Data-Driven Insights, and Improve Mission Outcomes HSI's
pilot project will strengthen their investigative processes by introducing a LLM-based system designed to enhance
the efficiency and accuracy of summaries investigators rely upon. The LLM-based system will leverage open-
source technologies to allow investigators to more quickly summarize and search for contextually relevant
information within investigative reports. The pilot could lead to increases in detection of fentanyl-related networks,
aid in identification of perpetrators and victims of child exploitation crimes, and surface key patterns and trends that
could further HSI's vital work.

Bolster Planning Assistance for Resilient Communities FEMA will launch a GenAI pilot to create efficiencies for the
hazard mitigation planning process for local governments, including underserved communities. Hazard mitigation
plans are not only a foundational step that communities can take to build their resilience but can be lengthy to
produce and challenging for communities that lack resources to do so. The pilot will specifically support State,
Local, Tribal, and Territorial governments' understanding of how to craft a plan that identifies risks and mitigation
strategies as well as generate draft plan elementsfrom publicly-available, well-researched sources that
governments could customize to meet their needs. This pilot could lead to more communities having the ability to
submit grant applications for funding to become more resilient and reduce disaster risks.

Enhance Immigration Officer Training through Generative AI United States Citizenship and Immigration Services is
developing an interactive application that uses GenAI to improve the way the agency trains immigration officer
personnel. USCIS will generate dynamic, personalized training materials that adapt to officers' specific needs and
ensure the best possible knowledge and training on a wide range of current policies and laws relevant to their jobs.
The goal is to help enhance trainees' understanding and retention of crucial information, increase the accuracy of
their decisionmaking process, and limit the need for retraining over time.

The roadmap and announcement of pilot programs are the latest in the Department's ongoing AI initiatives.

                                                                           Page 3 of 4

                                     SECURITY ....

In February, Secretary Mayorkas and CIO Hysen announced the Department's first-ever hiring sprint to recruit 50
AI technology experts to help build teams that will help better leverage AI responsibly across strategic areas of the
homeland security enterprise. These include efforts to counter fentanyl, combat child sexual exploitation and abuse,
deliver immigration services, secure travel, fortify our critical infrastructure, and enhance our cybersecurity. DHS
has received a strong response to date and is in the process of reviewing. interviewing, and hiring AI technologists
to support mission-enhancing initiatives. The Department continues to accept applications on dhs.gov/AI.

Last year, DHS established the Department's first AI Task Force and named CIO Hysen its first Chief AI Officer.
Informed by the Task Force's work over the past 11 months, DHS has identified areas where AI can enhance the
effectiveness of the Department's efforts helping pave the way for this roadmap and these new projects. The Task
Force's focus is on DHS's entire mission space. For instance, it is working to enhance the integrity of our supply
chains and the broader trade environment by helping deploy AI to improve cargo screening, the identification of
imported goods produced with forced labor, and risk management. The Task Force is also charged with using AI to
better detect fentanyl shipments, identify and interdict the flow of precursor chemicals around the world, and disrupt
key nodes in criminal networks.

The Department's latest efforts follow President Biden's Executive Order (EO) "Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy
Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence," signed in October2023. The EO directed DHS to promote the
adoption of AI safety standards globally, protect U.S. networks and critical infrastructure, reduce the risks that AI
can be used to create weapons of mass destruction, combat AI-related intellectual property theft, and help the
United States attract and retain skilled talent, among other missions. The President has directed DHS to establish
an AI Safety and Security Advisory Board to support the responsible development of AI. This Board will bring
together preeminent industry experts from AI hardware and software companies, leading research labs, critical
infrastructure entities, and the U.S. government. This Board will issue recommendations and best practices for an
array of AI use cases to ensure AI deployments are secure and resilient.

The International Telecommunication Union, the United Nations specialized agency for information and
communication technologies, issued the following news release on Sept. 10, 2024:

***

ITU's first standardization governing conference in Asia will set the course for innovation and cooperation

***

     Policy-makers and industry leaders will consider priorities for international standards to support industry growth,
innovation, and trust in new technologies at ITU's World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA)
(https://www.itu.int/wtsa/2024/), taking place from 15 to 24 October at New Delhi's Pragati Maidan conference and
exhibition centre.

Standards from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) support cost-effective, interoperable
advancements in technology at a global scale. By capturing and creating a basis for continuous innovation,
standards provide the foundation for new industries to grow and established industries to evolve.

Organized every four years, WTSA is the governing conference for the standardization work of ITU, the United
Nations Agency for Digital Technologies.

"Standards are taking centre stage in global governance discussions," said Doreen Bogdan-Martin, ITU Secretary-
General. "When countries gather in New Delhi for WTSA-24, they will have an opportunity to foster digital inclusion
and trust - values that are more important than ever to ensure that innovation in fields like artificial intelligence,
the metaverse, and quantum information technologies helps us create the future we want."

ITU's standardization work is driven by the contributions and consensus decisions of ITU's membership
(https://www.itu.int/hub/membership/), including 193 Member States and over 1000 member companies,
universities, and international and regional organizations.

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4
  International Telecommunication Union: India to Host World Conference on Priorities for Technology Standards

WTSA directs the agency's activities on standards and reviews the strategy, structure, and working methods of
ITU's standardization arm (ITU-T). The conference also approves the mandates and appoints the leadership teams
of ITU-T expert groups (https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/studygroups/Pages/default.aspx) for international
standardization.

"Standards agreed by consensus create the confidence to continue innovating and investing," said Seizo Onoe,
Director of ITU's Telecommunication Standardization Bureau. "With every breakthrough in science and technology
comes wider transformation, and we must keep coming together to develop the standards required for people and
economies to thrive while pushing new frontiers. That's what our standardization processes are built for."

WTSA-24 will be the first meeting of ITU's governing conference on standards to take place in Asia. In parallel, the
exhibition centre will host a digital innovation festival showcasing the latest tech developments from India and the
world.

"Our philosophy of Atithi Devo Bhava (Guest is akin to God) drives us to welcome the world's telecom leaders to
our national capital, New Delhi, for WTSA-24," said Neeraj Mittal, Secretary of the Department of
Telecommunications, Ministry of Communications, Government of India. "We are confident this assembly will set
new benchmarks in standardization to drive sustainable growth in information and communication technologies."

The proceedings will begin on World Standards Day (https://www.worldstandardsday.org/home.html), 14 October,
with the ITU Global Standards Symposium (https://gss.itu.int/) (GSS) exploring innovations in areas from artificial
intelligence (AI) and the metaverse to secure digital finance and smart cities.

GSS-24, also taking place at New Delhi's Pragati Maidan, will include a high-level segment welcoming ministers
and industry executives to discuss digital transformation ambitions and associated standardization demands.

The symposium will submit recommended actions for ITU's membership at WTSA-24.

GSS will also feature the inaugural session of ITU's new International AI Standards Summit
(https://aiforgood.itu.int/ai-standards/), aimed at ensuring comprehensive standards for the fast-evolving AI
landscape and intended to become a staple of ITU's annual AI for Good Global Summit series.

"I look forward to collaborative, constructive and collective efforts as the world's information and communication
technology leaders come together in New Delhi for WTSA-24," said Ritu Ranjan Mittar, Chair Designate for WTSA-
24.

What else is happening during WTSA-24?

The Network of Women in ITU standardization (https://www.itu.int/wtsa/2024/now/) will hold special sessions during
WTSA-24 on women's leadership in the digital tech industry and supporting technical standardization processes.

Tech innovation in India will be on show at AI for Good Impact India (https://aiforgood.itu.int/event/ai-for-good-
impact-india/), the first regional event under the umbrella of ITU's new AI for Good Impact Initiative
(https://aiforgood.itu.int/impact-initiative/), which aims to expand the scope and impact of AI applications for
sustainable development.

A Robotics for Good Youth Challenge (https://aiforgood.itu.int/event/robotics-for-good-youth-challenge-india/), held
as part of AI for Good Impact India, will welcome teams of young Indian innovators to compete for prizes and global
recognition for robotics solutions supporting disaster response.

Body


The following information was released by the office of Virginia Rep. Don Beyer:

Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean
Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), founder and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus
and a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Representative Anna Eshoo (CA-16), co-
chair of the House AI Caucus, and Representative Don Beyer (VA-08), vice-chair of the House AI Caucus, today
introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024. The legislation would direct the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards to measure and report the full range of artificial
intelligence's (AI) environmental impacts, as well as create a voluntary framework for AI developers to report
environmental impacts.

The legislation also requires an interagency study to investigate and measure both the positive and negative
environmental impacts of AI. While researchers increasingly highlight that AI can help tackle environmental
challenges, such as by accelerating clean energy innovation, providing better weather forecasts, and improving
cooling efficiency, the rapid growth of AI also comes with environmental harms. For example, increasing AI use
could contribute to data center electricity demand doubling by 2026, leading to more carbon emissions. Demand for
water to cool data centers is already creating concerns about water supplies, and the chips needed to run AI
software are contributing to a growing mountain of electronic waste.

"There is a Dickensian quality to the use of AI when it comes to our environment: It can make our planet better, and
it can make our planet worse," said Senator Markey. "Our AI Environmental Impacts Act would set clear standards
and voluntary reporting guidelines to measure AI's impact on our environment. The development of the next
generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet. I thank Senator Heinrich,
Representative Eshoo, and Representative Beyer, for their partnership in making sure that AI contributes to a more
livable future for generations to come."

"AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but that comes with high environmental costs," said Representative
Eshoo. "The resources necessary to research and develop AI are intensive, and as AI systems grow in scale and
become more widely used across various sectors of society, it's critical to understand the environmental impacts of
AI development and use. I'm proud to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act to conduct a

                                                                               Page 2 of 5

comprehensive study on AI's environmental impacts, identify standards needed to measure those impacts, and
create a system for AI developers to report the full range of their environmental impacts."

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Representative Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease
emissions in other sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible
with the adverse impacts it may have on our environment now."

A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Specifically, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act would:

Require a Study on the Environmental Impacts of AI: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would conduct a
comprehensive study on the environmental impact of AI within two years. The study would examine AI models and
hardware's lifecycle, including energy consumption, pollution, and e-waste, as well as assess the positive and
negative environmental impacts of AI's applications.

Convene an AI Environmental Impacts Consortium: NIST would convene a consortium of stakeholders to identify
measurement needs and standards for AI's environmental impacts.

Create a Voluntary Reporting System: NIST would develop a system for entities developing or operating AI to
voluntarily report the full range of AI's environmental impacts.

Direct a Report to Congress: Within four years, the EPA, the Department of Energy, and NIST would submit a joint
report to Congress, detailing the consortium's findings and describing the voluntary reporting system, as well as
providing recommendations for further legislative and executive action.

The legislation is endorsed by Hugging Face, Data and Society, Climate Change AI, Public Citizen, Sierra Club,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Greenpeace USA, Center for AI and Digital Policy, Friends of the Earth
Action, Kairos Action, EkÅ, Accountable Tech, Encode Justice, Union of Concerned Scientists, Fidutam, Green
Web Foundation, Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance, and Access Now.

"Recent advances in AI have great potential to help us tackle big societal challenges," said Emma Strubell,
Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "However, there is increasing evidence that the development
and use of AI can have a negative impact on the environment due to unprecedented computational requirements.
Our understanding of the true scale and scope of these impacts is still nascent, limited by access to the necessary
data and standards for reporting. Senator Markey's AI Environmental Impacts Act provides a roadmap for
elucidating the complex relationship between AI and the environment, which will be critical to ensuring that AI
technology is developed and deployed so as to have a net positive impact on our environment and society."

"The environmental impacts of AI technologies are undeniable - from the energy to power model training, and
deployment, to the water needed to cool data centers and the rare earth metals to manufacture the hardware," said
Dr. Sasha Luccioni, Climate Lead at Hugging Face. "This bill will help shed some much-needed light on the extent
of these impacts and how they're evolving over time."

"Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's legislation will address a critical, yet underexplored aspect of AI its
environmental footprint," said Dr. Roy Schwartz, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "The bill
will promote transparency regarding the environmental aspects of AI tools, allowing organizations to both report
and, as a result, mitigate their negative environmental effects. This act could not have come at a better time, as
these tools are becoming ubiquitous, requiring larger amounts of energy to build and deploy them, water for cooling
their servers, and land to build data centers for them."

                                                                               Page 3 of 5

"This legislation provides a crucial step towards aligning society's use of AI with climate change goals, by helping
us measure the impacts of AI's inputs and applications, and therefore take more targeted action to shape those
impacts," said Dr. Priya Donti, Co-founder and Chair of Climate Change AI.

"As the use of AI rapidly increases, society needs to understand how this new technology impacts the
environment," said Erik Kojola, Senior Climate Research Specialist at Greenpeace USA . "This means we need a
rigorous system for tracking energy use and carbon emissions. The Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts
Act of 2024 is a vital step in creating that system and studying how AI contributes to the climate crisis. This will
bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the emerging AI industry."

"The Center for AI and Digital Policy strongly supports the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act," said
Merve Hickok, President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's bold
initiative addresses one of the greatest challenges in the AI sector - the possible acceleration of climate change.
We need research and analysis to assess the environmental impact of AI systems. The AI Environments Impacts
Act should be a top priority for Senate consideration."

"Artificial Intelligence has become the latest tool in the Silicon Valley corporate race, with every company trying to
put out AI-driven products in order to stay competitive," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action. "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"By creating transparency around AI's impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental
Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop
their products in line with our collective health and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator

Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, D-California, issued the following news release:

U.S. Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (CA-16), co-chair of the House AI Caucus, U.S. Congressman Don Beyer, vice-
chair of the House AI Caucus, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, and Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), founder
and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus and a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
today introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024. Thelegislation would direct the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards to measure and report the full range of
artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental impacts, as well as create a voluntary framework for AI developers to
report environmental impacts.Â

The legislation also requires an interagency study to investigate and measure both the positive and negative
environmental impacts of AI. While researchers increasingly highlight that AI can help tackle environmental
challenges, such as accelerating clean energy innovation, providing better weather forecasts, and improving cooling
efficiency, the rapid growth of AI also comes with environmental harms. For example, increasing AI use could
contribute to data center electricity demand doubling by 2026, leading to more carbon emissions. Demand for water
to cool data centers is already creating concerns about water supplies, and the chips needed to run AI software are
contributing to a growing mountain of electronic waste.

"AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but that comes with high environmental costs," said Rep. Eshoo.
"The resources necessary to research and develop AI are intensive, and as AI systems grow in scale and become
more widely used across various sectors of society, it's critical to understand the environmental impacts of AI
development and use. I'm proud to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act to conduct a
comprehensive study on AI's environmental impacts, identify standards needed to measure those impacts, and
create a system for AI developers to report the full range of their environmental impacts."

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Rep. Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease emissions in other

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 5

sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible with the adverse
impacts it may have on our environment now."

"There is a Dickensian quality to the use of AI when it comes to our environment: It can make our planet better, and
it can make our planet worse," said Senator Markey. "Our AI Environmental Impacts Act would set clear standards
and voluntary reporting guidelines to measure AI's impact on our environment. The development of the next
generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet. I thank Senator Heinrich,
Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman Beyer for their partnership in making sure that AI contributes to a more
livable future for generations to come."

A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Specifically, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act would:

Require a Study on the Environmental Impacts of AI: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will conduct a
comprehensive study on the environmental impact of AI within two years. The study will examine AI models and
hardware's lifecycle, including energy consumption, pollution, and e-waste, as well as assess the positive and
negative environmental impacts of AI's applications. Convene an AI Environmental Impacts Consortium: NIST will
convene a consortium of stakeholders to identify measurement needs and standards for AI's environmental
impacts. Create a Voluntary Reporting System: NIST will develop a system for entities developing or operating AI to
voluntarily report the full range of AI's environmental impacts. Direct a Report to Congress: Within four years, the
EPA, the Department of Energy, and NIST must submit a joint report to Congress, detailing the consortium's
findings and describing the voluntary reporting system, as well as providing recommendations for further legislative
and executive action.

The legislation is endorsed by Hugging Face, Data and Society, Climate Change AI, Public Citizen, Sierra Club,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Greenpeace USA, Center for AI and Digital Policy, Friends of the Earth
Action, Kairos Action, Eko, Accountable Tech, Encode Justice, Union of Concerned Scientists, Fidutam, Green
Web Foundation, and Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance.

"Recent advances in AI have great potential to help us tackle big societal challenges," said Emma Strubell,
Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "However, there is increasing evidence that the development
and use of AI can have a negative impact on the environment due to unprecedented computational requirements.
Our understanding of the true scale and scope of these impacts is still nascent, limited by access to the necessary
data and standards for reporting. Senator Markey's AI Environmental Impacts Act provides a roadmap for
elucidating the complex relationship between AI and the environment, which will be critical to ensuring that AI
technology is developed and deployed so as to have a net positive impact on our environment and society."

"The environmental impacts of AI technologies are undeniable - from the energy to power model training and
deployment, to the water needed to cool data centers and the rare earth metals to manufacture the hardware," said
Dr. Sasha Luccioni, Climate Lead at Hugging Face. "This bill will help shed some much-needed light on the extent
of these impacts and how they're evolving over time"."

"Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's legislation will address a critical, yet underexplored aspect of AI - its
environmental footprint," said Dr. Roy Schwartz, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "The bill
will promote transparency regarding the environmental aspects of AI tools, allowing organizations to both report
and, as a result, mitigate their negative environmental effects. This act could not have come at a better time, as
these tools are becoming ubiquitous, requiring larger amounts of energy to build and deploy them, water for cooling
their servers, and land to build data centers for them."

                                                                                                  Page 3 of 5

                                Environmental Impacts of Artificial Intelligence

"As the use of AI rapidly increases, society needs to understand how this new technology impacts the
environment," said Erik Kojola, Senior Climate Research Specialist at Greenpeace USA. "This means we need a
rigorous system for tracking energy use and carbon emissions. The Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts
Act of 2024 is a vital step in creating that system and studying how AI contributes to the climate crisis. This will
bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the emerging AI industry."

"The Center for AI and Digital Policy strongly supports the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act," said
Merve Hickok, President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's bold
initiative addresses one of the greatest challenges in the AI sector - the possible acceleration of climate change.
We need research and analysis to assess the environmental impact of AI systems. The AI Environments Impacts
Act should be a top priority for Senate consideration,"

"Artificial Intelligence has become the latest tool in the Silicon Valley corporate race, with every company trying to
put out AI-driven products in order to stay "competitive"," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us -- we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "By creating transparency around AI's
impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and
policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop their products in line with our collective health
and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator
Markey and Senator Heinrich for introducing this Bill that will provide a roadmap toward positive outcomes."

"One of the many unknowns about AI is its impact on the environment," said Kaili Lambe, Policy and Advocacy
Director at Accountable Tech. "As rapid advances have led to increasingly widespread use of LLMs and other data-
intensive AI systems, it's imperative that we understand and take steps to mitigate unintended harm, including the

The following information was released by the University of Massachusetts - Amherst:

DISCount, created at UMass Amherst, derived from two very different needs: Counts of damaged buildings in crisis
zones and bird flock sizes

A team of computer scientists at the University of Massachusetts Amherst working on two different problemshow to
quickly detect damaged buildings in crisis zones and how to accurately estimate the size of bird flocksrecently
announced an AI framework that can do both. The framework, called DISCount, blends the speed and massive
data-crunching power of artificial intelligence with the reliability of human analysis to quickly deliver reliable
estimates that can quickly pinpoint and count specific features from very large collections of images. The research,
published by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, has been recognized by that
association with an award for the best paper on AI for social impact.

"DISCount came together as two very different applications," says Subhransu Maji, associate professor of
information and computer sciences at UMass Amherst and one of the paper's authors. "Through UMass Amherst's
Center for Data Science, we have been working with the Red Cross for years in helping them to build a computer
vision tool that could accurately count buildings damaged during events like earthquakes or wars. At the same time,
we were helping ornithologists at Colorado State University and the University of Oklahoma interested in using
weather radar data to get accurate estimates of the size of bird flocks."

The Palu Tsunami, which struck Indonesia in 2018. The data consisted of 113 high-resolution satellite images.
Counts of the buildings and their damage levels were collected per tile using before- and after-disaster satellite
images. Colors indicate different levels of damage (red = destroyed), and DISCount gave an estimate of damaged
buildings per sub-region.

Maji and his co-authors, lead author Gustavo Perez, who completed this research as part of his doctoral training at
UMass Amherst, and Dan Sheldon, associate professor of information and computer sciences at UMass Amherst,
thought they could solve the damaged-buildings-and-bird-flock problems with computer vision, a type of AI that can
scan enormous archives of images in search of something particulara bird, a rubble pileand count it.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3
                      NEW COMPUTER VISION TOOL WINS PRIZE FOR SOCIAL IMPACT

But the team was running into the same roadblocks on each project: "the standard computer visions models were
not accurate enough," says Perez. "We wanted to build automated tools that could be used by non-AI experts, but
which could provide a higher degree of reliability."

The answer, says Sheldon, was to fundamentally rethink the typical approaches to solving counting problems.

"Typically, you either have humans do time-intensive and accurate hand-counts of a very small data set, or you
have computer vision run less-accurate automated counts of enormous data sets," Sheldon says. "We thought: why
not do both?"

DISCount is a framework that can work with any already existing AI computer vision model. It works by using the AI
to analyze the very large data setssay, all the images taken of a particular region in a decadeto determine which
particular smaller set of data a human researcher should look at. This smaller set could, for example, be all the
images from a few critical days that the computer vision model has determined best show the extent of building
damage in that region. The human researcher could then hand-count the damaged buildings from the much smaller
set of images and the algorithm will use them to extrapolate the number of buildings affected across the entire
region. Finally, DISCount will estimate how accurate the human-derived estimate is.

"DISCount works significantly better than random sampling for the tasks we considered," says Perez. "And part of
the beauty of our framework is that it is compatible with any computer-vision model, which lets the researcher select
the best AI approach for their needs. Because it also gives a confidence interval, it gives researchers the ability to
make informed judgments about how good their estimates are."

"In retrospect, we had a relatively simple idea," says Sheldon. "But that small mental shiftthat we didn't have to
choose between human and artificial intelligence, has let us build a tool that is faster, more comprehensive, and
more reliable than either approach alone."

                          Artificial Intelligence Rep. Don Beyer (D- VA ) News Relea....

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Representative Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease
emissions in other sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible
with the adverse impacts it may have on our environment now."

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Specifically, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act would:

* Require a Study on the Environmental Impacts of AI: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would conduct
a comprehensive study on the environmental impact of AI within two years. The study would examine AI models
and hardware's lifecycle, including energy consumption, pollution, and e-waste, as well as assess the positive and
negative environmental impacts of AI's applications.

* Convene an AI Environmental Impacts Consortium: NIST would convene a consortium of stakeholders to identify
measurement needs and standards for AI's environmental impacts.

* Create a Voluntary Reporting System: NIST would develop a system for entities developing or operating AI to
voluntarily report the full range of AI's environmental impacts.

* Direct a Report to Congress: Within four years, the EPA, the Department of Energy, and NIST would submit a joint
report to Congress, detailing the consortium's findings and describing the voluntary reporting system, as well as
providing recommendations for further legislative and executive action.

The legislation is endorsed by Hugging Face, Data and Society, Climate Change AI, Public Citizen, Sierra Club,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Greenpeace USA, Center for AI and Digital Policy, Friends of the Earth
Action, Kairos Action, Eko, Accountable Tech, Encode Justice, Union of Concerned Scientists, Fidutam, Green
Web Foundation, Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance, and Access Now.

"Recent advances in AI have great potential to help us tackle big societal challenges," said Emma Strubell,
Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "However, there is increasing evidence that the development
and use of AI can have a negative impact on the environment due to unprecedented computational requirements.
Our understanding of the true scale and scope of these impacts is still nascent, limited by access to the necessary
data and standards for reporting. Senator Markey's AI Environmental Impacts Act provides a roadmap for
elucidating the complex relationship between AI and the environment, which will be critical to ensuring that AI
technology is developed and deployed so as to have a net positive impact on our environment and society."

"The environmental impacts of AI technologies are undeniable - from the energy to power model training, and
deployment, to the water needed to cool data centers and the rare earth metals to manufacture the hardware," said
Dr. Sasha Luccioni, Climate Lead at Hugging Face. "This bill will help shed some much-needed light on the extent
of these impacts and how they're evolving over time."

"Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's legislation will address a critical, yet underexplored aspect of AI - its
environmental footprint," said Dr. Roy Schwartz, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "The bill
will promote transparency regarding the environmental aspects of AI tools, allowing organizations to both report
and, as a result, mitigate their negative environmental effects. This act could not have come at a better time, as
these tools are becoming ubiquitous, requiring larger amounts of energy to build and deploy them, water for cooling
their servers, and land to build data centers for them."

"This legislation provides a crucial step towards aligning society's use of AI with climate change goals, by helping
us measure the impacts of AI's inputs and applications, and therefore take more targeted action to shape those
impacts," said Dr. Priya Donti, Co-founder and Chair of Climate Change AI.

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 5

"As the use of AI rapidly increases, society needs to understand how this new technology impacts the
environment," said Erik Kojola, Senior Climate Research Specialist at Greenpeace USA. "This means we need a
rigorous system for tracking energy use and carbon emissions. The Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts
Act of 2024 is a vital step in creating that system and studying how AI contributes to the climate crisis. This will
bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the emerging AI industry."

"The Center for AI and Digital Policy strongly supports the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act," said
Merve Hickok, President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's bold
initiative addresses one of the greatest challenges in the AI sector - the possible acceleration of climate change.
We need research and analysis to assess the environmental impact of AI systems. The AI Environments Impacts
Act should be a top priority for Senate consideration."

"Artificial Intelligence has become the latest tool in the Silicon Valley corporate race, with every company trying to
put out AI-driven products in order to stay competitive," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action. "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us -- we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"By creating transparency around AI's impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental
Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop
their products in line with our collective health and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator
Markey and Senator Heinrich for introducing this Bill that will provide a roadmap toward positive outcomes."

"One of the many unknowns about AI is its impact on the environment," said Kaili Lambe, Policy and Advocacy
Director at Accountable Tech. "As rapid advances have led to increasingly widespread use of LLMs and other data-
intensive AI systems, it's imperative that we understand and take steps to mitigate unintended harm, including the
potential for environmental degradation. Too often transparency takes a backseat when it comes to Big Tech
innovation. Senators Markey and Heinrich's legislation offers an opportunity to gain critical insight into the
environmental impact of AI, and we are eager to see it pass."

"AI technologies are spreading rapidly, with the potential for major impacts on society," said Jennifer Jones,
Director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We must fully understand
both the benefits and the risks, of these technologies--including intensive energy consumption and creation of
environmental waste that harms people and nature. We have a responsibility to track the environmental impacts of
AI, to ensure this information is publicly available and to help us plan to mitigate those harms. Importantly, the bill

"Right now, we have only a limited understanding of the depth and scale of AI's environmental impacts--but what
we do know is alarming," said Brian J. Chen, Policy Director at Data and Society. "AI's massive energy
consumption and pollution effects are likely to exacerbate global warming and climate disaster. The AI
Environmental Impacts Act lays an important research foundation for a better-grounded understanding of the
technology's harms to people, communities, and habitats."

"What gets measured gets managed," said Michelle Thorne, Director of Strategy and Partnerships at the Green
Web Foundation. "We at the Green Web Foundation welcome this bill as an important step towards transparency of
the environmental impacts of AI. To date, the lack of consistent and comparable data has been a blocker for
technologists, researchers, policymakers and civil society. This bill will help enable more data-informed discussions
about how resources are allocated to computing."

Body


The following information was released by the office of California Rep. Anna G. Eshoo:

U.S. Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (CA-16), co-chair of the House AI Caucus, U.S. Congressman Don Beyer, vice-
chair of the House AI Caucus, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the Senate Environment and Public
Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, and Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), founder
and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus and a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee,
today introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024. Thelegislation would direct the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards to measure and report the full range of
artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental impacts, as well as create a voluntary framework for AI developers to
report environmental impacts.

The legislation also requires an interagency study to investigate and measure both the positive and negative
environmental impacts of AI. While researchers increasingly highlight that AI can help tackle environmental
challenges, such as accelerating clean energy innovation, providing better weather forecasts, and improving cooling
efficiency, the rapid growth of AI also comes with environmental harms. For example, increasing AI use could
contribute to data center electricity demand doubling by 2026, leading to more carbon emissions. Demand for water
to cool data centers is already creating concerns about water supplies, and the chips needed to run AI software are
contributing to a growing mountain of electronic waste.

"AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but that comes with high environmental costs," said Rep. Eshoo.
"The resources necessary to research and develop AI are intensive, and as AI systems grow in scale and become
more widely used across various sectors of society, it's critical to understand the environmental impacts of AI
development and use. I'm proud to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act to conduct a
comprehensive study on AI's environmental impacts, identify standards needed to measure those impacts, and
create a system for AI developers to report the full range of their environmental impacts."

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Rep. Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease emissions in other
sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible with the adverse
impacts it may have on our environment now."

                                                                              Page 2 of 5
      REPS. ESHOO AND BEYER, SENATORS MARKEY AND HEINRICH INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO
          INVESTIGATE, MEASURE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

"There is a Dickensian quality to the use of AI when it comes to our environment: It can make our planet better, and
it can make our planet worse," said Senator Markey. "Our AI Environmental Impacts Act would set clear standards
and voluntary reporting guidelines to measure AI's impact on our environment. The development of the next
generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet. I thank Senator Heinrich,
Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman Beyer for their partnership in making sure that AI contributes to a more
livable future for generations to come."

A copy of the legislation can be found HERE.

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Washington, D.C. - U.S. Congresswoman Anna Eshoo (CA-16), co-chair of the House AI Caucus, U.S.
Congressman Don Beyer, vice-chair of the House AI Caucus, Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chair of the
Senate Environment and Public Works Subcommittee on Clean Air, Climate, and Nuclear Safety, and Senator
Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), founder and co-chair of the Senate AI Caucus and a member of the Senate Energy and
Natural Resources Committee, today introduced the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024.
Thelegislation would direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop standards to
measure and report the full range of artificial intelligence's (AI) environmental impacts, as well as create a
voluntary framework for AI developers to report environmental impacts.

The legislation also requires an interagency study to investigate and measure both the positive and negative
environmental impacts of AI. While researchers increasingly highlight that AI can help tackle environmental
challenges, such as accelerating clean energy innovation, providing better weather forecasts, and improving cooling
efficiency, the rapid growth of AI also comes with environmental harms. For example, increasing AI use could
contribute to data center electricity demand doubling by 2026, leading to more carbon emissions. Demand for water
to cool data centers is already creating concerns about water supplies, and the chips needed to run AI software are
contributing to a growing mountain of electronic waste.

"AI offers incredible possibilities for our country, but that comes with high environmental costs," said Rep. Eshoo.
"The resources necessary to research and develop AI are intensive, and as AI systems grow in scale and become
more widely used across various sectors of society, it's critical to understand the environmental impacts of AI
development and use. I'm proud to introduce the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act to conduct a
comprehensive study on AI's environmental impacts, identify standards needed to measure those impacts, and
create a system for AI developers to report the full range of their environmental impacts."

"Understanding the environmental impacts of this quickly growing technology is critical so that we can begin to
address those impacts," said Rep. Beyer. "While recognizing the ways AI can help us decrease emissions in other
sectors and develop innovative climate solutions, we need to ensure we are being responsible with the adverse
impacts it may have on our environment now."

"There is a Dickensian quality to the use of AI when it comes to our environment: It can make our planet better, and
it can make our planet worse," said Senator Markey. "Our AI Environmental Impacts Act would set clear standards
and voluntary reporting guidelines to measure AI's impact on our environment. The development of the next

                                                                                                  Page 2 of 5

generation of AI tools cannot come at the expense of the health of our planet. I thank Senator Heinrich,
Congresswoman Eshoo and Congressman Beyer for their partnership in making sure that AI contributes to a more
livable future for generations to come."

Cosponsors in the Senate include Senators Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and
Cory Booker (D-N.J.).

Specifically, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act would:

* Require a Study on the Environmental Impacts of AI: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will conduct a
comprehensive study on the environmental impact of AI within two years. The study will examine AI models and
hardware's lifecycle, including energy consumption, pollution, and e-waste, as well as assess the positive and
negative environmental impacts of AI's applications.

* Convene an AI Environmental Impacts Consortium: NIST will convene a consortium of stakeholders to identify
measurement needs and standards for AI's environmental impacts.

* Create a Voluntary Reporting System: NIST will develop a system for entities developing or operating AI to
voluntarily report the full range of AI's environmental impacts.

* Direct a Report to Congress: Within four years, the EPA, the Department of Energy, and NIST must submit a joint
report to Congress, detailing the consortium's findings and describing the voluntary reporting system, as well as
providing recommendations for further legislative and executive action.

The legislation is endorsed by Hugging Face, Data and Society, Climate Change AI, Public Citizen, Sierra Club,
Electronic Privacy Information Center, Greenpeace USA, Center for AI and Digital Policy, Friends of the Earth
Action, Kairos Action, Eko, Accountable Tech, Encode Justice, Union of Concerned Scientists, Fidutam, Green
Web Foundation, and Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance.

"Recent advances in AI have great potential to help us tackle big societal challenges," said Emma Strubell,
Assistant Professor at Carnegie Mellon University. "However, there is increasing evidence that the development
and use of AI can have a negative impact on the environment due to unprecedented computational requirements.
Our understanding of the true scale and scope of these impacts is still nascent, limited by access to the necessary
data and standards for reporting. Senator Markey's AI Environmental Impacts Act provides a roadmap for
elucidating the complex relationship between AI and the environment, which will be critical to ensuring that AI
technology is developed and deployed so as to have a net positive impact on our environment and society."

"The environmental impacts of AI technologies are undeniable - from the energy to power model training and
deployment, to the water needed to cool data centers and the rare earth metals to manufacture the hardware," said
Dr. Sasha Luccioni, Climate Lead at Hugging Face. "This bill will help shed some much-needed light on the extent
of these impacts and how they're evolving over time"."

"Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's legislation will address a critical, yet underexplored aspect of AI - its
environmental footprint," said Dr. Roy Schwartz, Senior Lecturer at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "The bill
will promote transparency regarding the environmental aspects of AI tools, allowing organizations to both report
and, as a result, mitigate their negative environmental effects. This act could not have come at a better time, as
these tools are becoming ubiquitous, requiring larger amounts of energy to build and deploy them, water for cooling
their servers, and land to build data centers for them."

"As the use of AI rapidly increases, society needs to understand how this new technology impacts the
environment," said Erik Kojola, Senior Climate Research Specialist at Greenpeace USA. "This means we need a
rigorous system for tracking energy use and carbon emissions. The Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts
Act of 2024 is a vital step in creating that system and studying how AI contributes to the climate crisis. This will
bring much-needed transparency and accountability to the emerging AI industry."

                                                                                                  Page 3 of 5

"The Center for AI and Digital Policy strongly supports the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act," said
Merve Hickok, President of the Center for AI and Digital Policy. "Senator Markey and Senator Heinrich's bold
initiative addresses one of the greatest challenges in the AI sector - the possible acceleration of climate change.
We need research and analysis to assess the environmental impact of AI systems. The AI Environments Impacts
Act should be a top priority for Senate consideration,"

"Artificial Intelligence has become the latest tool in the Silicon Valley corporate race, with every company trying to
put out AI-driven products in order to stay "competitive"," said Dom Leon-Davis, Deputy Director of Program and
Strategy for Kairos Action "If left unchecked, this rapid development pushed by tech executives can and will harm
the planet we live on, particularly affecting poor, Black and Brown communities who already struggle to breathe
clean air and drink clean water. From increased energy use to e-waste, and impacts that are unknown to us -- we
need regulation like this now. We're glad to see this act take steps in the right direction of creating a world where
tech works for all of us."

"The public deserves to know the very basics about how AI tools affect our material world," said Caitriona
Fitzgerald, Deputy Director at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. "By creating transparency around AI's
impact on our environment, the Artificial Intelligence Environmental Impacts Act of 2024 will give the public and
policymakers a tool for pressuring technology companies to develop their products in line with our collective health
and safety."

"As Lord Kelvin wisely stated, 'To measure is to know.' We enthusiastically welcome and are eager to collaborate
on Senators Markey and Heinrich's initiative, as the United States takes a leading role in driving transparency and
setting global standards," said Max Schulze, Director of the Sustainable Digital Infrastructure Alliance. "This
initiative crucially creates visibility for the environmental costs of artificial intelligence, encompassing not just the
models but their usage as well. We particularly endorse the holistic approach taken, going beyond mere energy
consumption to consider all environmental impacts across the AI supply chain. This is vital for developing
sustainable and responsible AI practices globally."

"Right now, there is significant uncertainty about the impact of AI on the environment," said Peter Henderson,
Assistant Professor at Princeton University. "On one hand, it could be used to improve infrastructure and systems
for better efficiency, on the other hand it could harm the environment through increased demand for materials,
manufacturing, and energy usage. The government has a large role to play in ensuring that AI is a net positive for
the environment, by promoting transparency and innovation around AI's environmental impacts. I applaud Senator
Markey and Senator Heinrich for introducing this Bill that will provide a roadmap toward positive outcomes."

"One of the many unknowns about AI is its impact on the environment," said Kaili Lambe, Policy and Advocacy
Director at Accountable Tech. "As rapid advances have led to increasingly widespread use of LLMs and other data-
intensive AI systems, it's imperative that we understand and take steps to mitigate unintended harm, including the
potential for environmental degradation. Too often transparency takes a backseat when it comes to Big Tech
innovation. Sen. Markey and Sen. Heinrich's legislation offers an opportunity to gain critical insight into the
environmental impact of AI, and we are eager to see it pass."

"AI technologies are spreading rapidly, with the potential for major impacts on society," said Jennifer Jones,
Director of the Center for Science and Democracy at the Union of Concerned Scientists. "We must fully understand
both the benefits and the risks, of these technologies--including intensive energy consumption and creation of
environmental waste that harms people and nature. We have a responsibility to track the environmental impacts of
AI, to ensure this information is publicly available and to help us plan to mitigate those harms. Importantly, the bill
will allow stakeholders, including civil society, to examine and report on the full life cycle of artificial intelligence
models, systems, and hardware--bringing the voices of the most impacted communities to the table."

"Right now, we have only a limited understanding of the depth and scale of AI's environmental impacts--but what
we do know is alarming," said Brian J. Chen, Policy Director at Data and Society. "AI's massive energy
consumption and pollution effects are likely to exacerbate global warming and climate disaster. The AI

                                                                                                  Page 4 of 5

Environmental Impacts Act lays an important research foundation for a better-grounded understanding of the
technology's harms to people, communities, and habitats."

"What gets measured gets managed," said Michelle Thorne, Senior Advisor at the Green Web Foundation. "We at
the Green Web Foundation welcome this bill as an important step towards transparency of the environmental
impacts of AI. To date, the lack of consistent and comparable data has been a blocker for technologists,
researchers, policymakers and civil society. This bill will help enable more data-informed discussions about how
resources are allocated to computing."

The following information was released by the Department of Energy, the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory:

Just as fast as technology is changing, so is the threat landscape. More frequent and intense disasters put
pressures on emergency operations centers (EOCs) to rapidly share and analyze data that informs decision-
making. At the GovAI Summit 2023, a panel with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and
Technology (SandT) Directorate, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), and other emergency
management practitioners discussed how science and technologyspecifically artificial intelligence (AI)can help.

"Technology is a changing opportunity space for emergency preparedness and response, and we see that more
than ever with the current emergence of AI. This panel was a great chance to focus on both the challenges and
opportunities AI presents for emergency managers and first responders who help keep us safe," said Ryan Eddy,
PNNL director of homeland security programs.

The panel, "The EOC of the Future: How AI Will Transform Emergency Ops," explored how AI can help emergency
management advance from data overload to prediction and adjustment.

"With today's tools, there is a lot of data that can inform decision-making, but emergency managers need to be able
to access it and use itand fast. At PNNL, we are enabling secure, trustworthy, science-based AI and machine
learning programs to advance capabilities, particularly in image analysis and cyber defense," Eddy said.

Eddy's presentation, "Artificial Intelligence Science and Technology for Emergency Management," highlighted
PNNL AI tools and analysis capabilities, such as Rapid Analytics for Disaster Response, which combines image-
capturing technology, AI and cloud computing to assess damage and predict risks during extreme events, and
Sharkzor tool, which is an AI-driven, scalable web application that makes it possible to quickly characterize and sort
electron microscopy images used to analyze radioactive materials.

Eddy was joined on the panel by Executive Director for the DHS SandT Office of Science and Engineering Daniel
Cotter, Director for Enterprise Analytics and Chief Data Officer for the Federal Emergency Management Agency
Christa Montani, Bob Greenberg from GandH International Services, 311 Operations Director for the Town of Cary,
NC Ryan Hargreaves, and Assistant Town Manager of the Town of Cary, NC Dan Ault.

During the panel, Eddy and Cotter also highlighted the Emergency Management of Tomorrow Research Program in
which PNNL is collaborating DHS SandT to better understand first responder technology requirements to inform
future technology planning and development for EOC operations.

                                                                                                   Page 2 of 2
                      EDDY HIGHLIGHTS AI, ANALYTICS, EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT

"The best way to understand how AI is impacting, or could impact, EOCs is to talk to the people who use them and
crosswalk that with the latest research and technology trends," Eddy said. "We are actively connecting with first
responders and emergency managers to understand their concerns, barriers, and potential opportunities with AI,
and then translating that into useful information to inform future research."

BLACKSBURG, Va., Oct. 1 -- Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University issued the following news release:

The Virginia Tech media relations office has the following experts available for interviews this week surrounding
issues in the news. To schedule an interview, please contactmediarelations@vt.edu

Virginia Tech experts available to discuss headlines in the news

Hurricane Helene response and recovery efforts

As residents of the southeast coordinate widespread response and recovery efforts from Helene, it could be days
before we know the extent of the damage and months or even years before critical infrastructure is restored. Liesel
Ritchie, an expert in disaster events, can speak to the social impacts of hazards and disasters, particularly how
communities respond to, react to, and recover from them. And Dan Goerlich leads the Virginia Cooperative
Extension's emergency preparedness and response efforts, offering valuable, research-based information to
support communities preparing for and recovering from disasters.

Climate change, aging infrastructure, human decisions exacerbated Hurricane Helene flooding

Helene's historic and unexpected flooding was the result of a combination of stronger storms driven by climate
change, old dams and levees, and human expansion onto flood plains, says Manoochehr Shirzaei, an expert in
coastal flooding. These factors conspired to amplify the destructive effects of Hurricane Helene and heighten the
associated disaster risks. "Legacy systems, including levees, dams, bridges, roads, and electrical grids, were not
originally designed to endure the growing severity of hurricanes exacerbated by climate change. As these
structures deteriorate with time, their vulnerability to failure during extreme weather events increases," he said.

Candidates ready themselves for unique vice presidential debate

The vice presidential debate Tuesday evening is the final scheduled political showdown between the tickets before
the election. With polls inconclusive amid an unprecedented leadup to November, the event may take on more
significance than usual, says political expert Karen Hult. As for messaging, Cayce Myers expects both running

                                                                            Page 2 of 4

mates to continue to hammer away at their opponents, while Megan Duncan believes there may be more interest in
and viewership for the VP debate this cycle. More here.

California governor vetoes sweeping AI regulations

California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Sunday that would have imposed strict new regulations on the
development of artificial intelligence (AI), holding companies liable if the technology was used for harm - for
example, assistance in plotting a terrorist attack. Tech companies strongly opposed the legislation. "Newsome's
veto illustrates the tension between regulating artificial intelligence and encouraging innovation," says media and
communications expert Cayce Myers. "California has been a leader in AI regulation, but the question is to what
extent are platforms liable for users' misconduct, particularly disinformation. Proponents of AI regulation say that
the most impactful guardrails against misuse are regulation of the platforms."

Fall foliage to reach peak in late October

Autumn has arrived, and folks looking forward to the best time to view the spectacular fall leaf colors won't have
long to wait, says John Seiler, Virginia Tech forestry professor and expert in tree physiology. Those colors should
reach their peak from Oct. 19-27, about a week earlier than last year because of recent spans of dry weather. Read
more of Seiler's insights into what makes autumn leaves special here.

From tricks to treats: Virginia Tech experts share pumpkin care tips

As autumn sets in, orange and gold leaves paint the landscape and pumpkins arrive on front doorsteps. As a
quintessential symbol for the season, pumpkins not only add charm but also require proper care to last. Virginia
Cooperative Extension agriculture extension agents Ashley Edwards and Sarah Sharpe share their expert advice
on choosing, preserving, and repurposing your pumpkins this fall.

Podcast: Alcohol use and intimate partner violence

Meagan Brem joined Virginia Tech's "Curious Conversations" podcast to discuss the intersection of alcohol use and
intimate partner violence, highlighting the importance of understanding the causal relationship between the two.
She debunked common myths, identified current knowledge gaps, and shared insights from ongoing studies. She
also described the unique challenge of understanding these topics as they relate to LGBTQ+ populations and
shared possible interventions on both societal and individual levels.

About Brem

Brem is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and the director of the Research for Alcohol and
Couples Health Lab at Virginia Tech. Her research examines targetable factors that moderate the risk of alcohol
use leading to intimate partner/sexual violence, particularly among those who are at high risk of problematic
drinking and violence.

New data from the 2024 GAP Report offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with
the widespread adoption of productivity-enhancing tools, and how "bundling" these tools with other interventions will
accelerate sustainable agricultural productivity growth.

Bridging the "valley of death" - the gap between developing innovative solutions and getting them to producers
through commercialization or public delivery - must be a top priority in the coming decade. The report raises the
need to rethink the ways we bundle production tools with distribution mechanisms, socio-economic tools, and policy
levers to open new pathways to scale access and adoption, especially among smallholder producers.

An embargoed copy of the report and press kit materials are available upon request.

Researchers publish real-time data to understand what happens when people lose their balance

Researchers at Virginia Tech are using wrist-worn voice recorders to capture real-world data to better understand
what happens when people lose their balance. The study, led by Michael Madigan in the College of Engineering,
builds on years of his own foundational work and prior research conducted by the University of Michigan Medical
School. The findings were recently published in the Journal of American Geriatrics Society and highlight how voice-
recorders captured the moment when participants, who averaged 72 years of age, lost their balance. The study
concludes that among older adults, voice recorders are effective at capturing the circumstances and context in
which they lost their balance and potentially fell, without relying on recall later. More here. For any query with

The Virginia Tech media relations office has the following experts available for interviews this week surrounding
issues in the news. To schedule an interview, please contact mediarelations@vt.edu

Virginia Tech experts available to discuss headlines in the news

Hurricane Helene response and recovery efforts

As residents of the southeast coordinate widespread response and recovery efforts from Helene, it could be days
before we know the extent of the damage and months or even years before critical infrastructure is restored. Liesel
Ritchie, an expert in disaster events, can speak to the social impacts of hazards and disasters, particularly how
communities respond to, react to, and recover from them. And Dan Goerlich leads the Virginia Cooperative
Extension's emergency preparedness and response efforts, offering valuable, research-based information to
support communities preparing for and recovering from disasters.

Climate change, aging infrastructure, human decisions exacerbated Hurricane Helene flooding

Helene's historic and unexpected flooding was the result of a combination of stronger storms driven by climate
change, old dams and levees, and human expansion onto flood plains, says Manoochehr Shirzaei, an expert in
coastal flooding. These factors conspired to amplify the destructive effects of Hurricane Helene and heighten the
associated disaster risks. "Legacy systems, including levees, dams, bridges, roads, and electrical grids, were not
originally designed to endure the growing severity of hurricanes exacerbated by climate change. As these
structures deteriorate with time, their vulnerability to failure during extreme weather events increases," he said.

Candidates ready themselves for unique vice presidential debate

The vice presidential debate Tuesday evening is the final scheduled political showdown between the tickets before
the election. With polls inconclusive amid an unprecedented leadup to November, the event may take on more

                                                                                                    Page 2 of 4

significance than usual, says political expert Karen Hult. As for messaging, Cayce Myers expects both running
mates to continue to hammer away at their opponents, while Megan Duncan believes there may be more interest in
and viewership for the VP debate this cycle. More here.

California governor vetoes sweeping AI regulations

California Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill Sunday that would have imposed strict new regulations on the
development of artificial intelligence (AI), holding companies liable if the technology was used for harm for
example, assistance in plotting a terrorist attack. Tech companies strongly opposed the legislation. "Newsome's
veto illustrates the tension between regulating artificial intelligence and encouraging innovation," says media and
communications expert Cayce Myers. "California has been a leader in AI regulation, but the question is to what
extent are platforms liable for users' misconduct, particularly disinformation. Proponents of AI regulation say that
the most impactful guardrails against misuse are regulation of the platforms."

Fall foliage to reach peak in late October

Autumn has arrived, and folks looking forward to the best time to view the spectacular fall leaf colors won't have
long to wait, says John Seiler, Virginia Tech forestry professor and expert in tree physiology. Those colors should
reach their peak from Oct. 19-27, about a week earlier than last year because of recent spans of dry weather. Read
more of Seiler's insights into what makes autumn leaves special here.

From tricks to treats: Virginia Tech experts share pumpkin care tips

As autumn sets in, orange and gold leaves paint the landscape and pumpkins arrive on front doorsteps. As a
quintessential symbol for the season, pumpkins not only add charm but also require proper care to last. Virginia
Cooperative Extension agriculture extension agents Ashley Edwards and Sarah Sharpe share their expert advice
on choosing, preserving, and repurposing your pumpkins this fall.

Podcast: Alcohol use and intimate partner violence

Meagan Brem joined Virginia Tech's "Curious Conversations" podcast to discuss the intersection of alcohol use and
intimate partner violence, highlighting the importance of understanding the causal relationship between the two.
She debunked common myths, identified current knowledge gaps, and shared insights from ongoing studies. She
also described the unique challenge of understanding these topics as they relate to LGBTQ+ populations and
shared possible interventions on both societal and individual levels.

About Brem

Brem is an assistant professor in the Department of Psychology and the director of the Research for Alcohol and
Couples Health Lab at Virginia Tech. Her research examines targetable factors that moderate the risk of alcohol
use leading to intimate partner/sexual violence, particularly among those who are at high risk of problematic
drinking and violence.

Research highlights

New report: Southeast Asia leads in agricultural productivity growth can the world replicate its success?

Oct. 3, 2024, from 8-11 a.m.

National Press Club (529 14th St. NW, D.C.) and online

Registration is required for both attendance options

The Global Agricultural Productivity Initiative at Virginia Tech releases and discusses the 2024 Global Agricultural
Productivity (GAP) Report. Media are invited to attend and cover the event, which will feature a multisectoral panel
exploring successful bundling approaches and an all-farmer panel to provide insights from the field.

                                                                                                   Page 3 of 4
         Experts available: Hurricane Helene response and recovery, Vice Presidential debate, and more

New data from the 2024 GAP Report offers valuable insights into the challenges and opportunities associated with
the widespread adoption of productivity-enhancing tools, and how "bundling" these tools with other interventions will
accelerate sustainable agricultural productivity growth.

Bridging the "valley of death" the gap between developing innovative solutions and getting them to producers
through commercialization or public delivery must be a top priority in the coming decade. The report raises the need
to rethink the ways we bundle production tools with distribution mechanisms, socio-economic tools, and policy
levers to open new pathways to scale access and adoption, especially among smallholder producers.

An embargoed copy of the report and press kit materials are available upon request.

Researchers publish real-time data to understand what happens when people lose their balance

Researchers at Virginia Tech are using wrist-worn voice recorders to capture real-world data to better understand
what happens when people lose their balance. The study, led by Michael Madigan in the College of Engineering,
builds on years of his own foundational work and prior research conducted by the University of Michigan Medical
School. The findings were recently published in the Journal of American Geriatrics Society and highlight how voice-
recorders captured the moment when participants, who averaged 72 years of age, lost their balance. The study
concludes that among older adults, voice recorders are effective at capturing the circumstances and context in
which they lost their balance and potentially fell, without relying on recall later. More here.

(TNSres) -- The General Services Administration issued the following news release on Aug. 13, 2024:

Today, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) welcomed 70 new fellows to the U.S. Digital Corps
(USDC), a fellowship that provides a pathway for early-career technologists to apply their skills and expertise in the
federal workplace.

More than 2,000 applications were submitted during the recruitment cycle, the largest number the program has
received. The 2024 Fellows are USDC's third cohort, which includes individuals who will focus on AI and AI-related
projects in response to the National AI Talent Surge.

"Growing the U.S. Digital Corps is crucial to driving innovation across the federal government, especially as
emerging technologies like AI evolve," said GSA Administrator Robin Carnahan. "GSA is focused on delivering
great value to our customer agencies and the American people, so we are proud to help lead the Biden-Harris
Administration's efforts to bring tech talent into government to deliver those results."

USDC is a two year paid fellowship that offers five tracks: cybersecurity, data science and analytics, design, product
management, and software engineering. Fellows will support projects at 19 federal agencies - six of which will be
new agency partners to USDC, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Fellows will support and advance a variety of
high-priority technology initiatives for example:

* Improving cybersecurity, border security, airport security, disaster recovery areas, drug capture, and security at
sea by leveraging artificial intelligence systems to advance the Department of Homeland Security mission.

* Applying qualitative and quantitative research and analytics to improve consular service design at the Department
of State, including passport and visa services, to deliver for the tens of millions of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals
who depend on them.

* Helping the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) support disaster survivors by making the process
to apply and receive disaster support more streamlined, accessible, and equitable.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3
                             GSA Announces New Cohort of U.S. Digital Corps Fellows

"I believe strongly in the contract between the American people and our government; that the federal government
has a duty to provide adequate services, support, and aid to all, especially our most vulnerable," said Zach Palmer,
a 2024 USDC Data Science and Analytics Fellow. "With these beliefs in mind, I felt that the U.S. Digital Corps was
the perfect place for me to leverage my technical skills to help the federal government effectively serve its
constituents, while also giving me the opportunity to mentor under incredibly talented and knowledgeable public
servants."

Since its inception in 2021, USDC has recruited more than 150 early-career technologists and has supported
projects of national significance at 25 agencies. Of the graduates in USDC's inaugural 2022 cohort, ninety-five
percent chose to remain with the federal government post-fellowship and continue their service to the American
people.

The Association of the U.S. Army issued the following news:

After an early bout of severe weather, the National Guard is anticipating a busy disaster response season ahead,
leaders from the component said.

"The operational tempo for the National Guard is pretty [high]," Col. Larry Doane, chief of the National Guard
Bureau's current operations division, said during a May 28 discussion with reporters. "With most of the country
experiencing severe weather even early in the season, it doesn't look like that's going to change anytime soon."

Last year, National Guard members distributed approximately 706,000 meals and cleared 1,500 miles of road as
they responded to severe weather across 23 states, according to a National Guard Bureau fact sheet. The Guard
also used 2.7 million gallons of retardant in response to wildfires and detected about 14,000 wildfires using the
FireGuard program.

California has been investing in proactive response to wildfires for several years, including through Joint Task Force
Rattlesnake, said Brig. Gen. Robert Paoletti, the California National Guard's Joint Staff director.

"We have been very busy since about 2017 with wildfires," he said. "Over 300 National Guardsmen are on
emergency state active duty, which is our Task Force Rattlesnake. In the off-season, that task force ... [does] debris
clearing under the direction of CalFire, and ... it augments CalFire ... during the fire season."

The Florida National Guard conducts an annual drill to ensure that it is ready for hurricane response, said Lt. Col.
Blake Heidelberg, director of military support for the Florida National Guard.

"We devote a drill every year ... to our hurricane response and our domestic operations training," he said. "So, we
look at it, and we plan, and we assign specific tasks to units because we know that hurricanes are not only our most
likely [disaster to mitigate] but they're also our most dangerous."

Looking to the future of disaster response, soldiers on the ground may use artificial intelligence to speed up the
aid process, Doane said.

                                                                                                 Page 2 of 2
            Association of the U.S. Army: National Guard Readies for Busy Disaster Response Season

During disaster response efforts, soldiers must parse through a large amount of data to decide where and how to
best allocate resources, he said. "AI is going to become a useful tool for us to speed [up]," Doane said.

The Guard will continue to offer the nation "deeply tailored" disaster response solutions, Doane said. "These 54
states, territories and the District ... provide local expertise while the National Guard Bureau, and its relationship
across the federal interagency, ... [provides] resources to better support deeply tailored solutions so that ... [the]
response is formed by those people who are experiencing that disaster," he said.

(TNSres) -- The University of Exeter issued the following news:

AI can help humanitarians gain crucial insights to better monitor and anticipate risks, such as a conflict outbreak or
escalation. But deploying systems in this context is not without risks for those affected, a new study warns.

Humanitarian organisations have been increasingly using digital technologies and the Covid-19 pandemic has
accelerated this trend.

AI-supported disaster mapping was used in Mozambique to speed up emergency response, and AI systems were
used to predict food crisis and rolled out by the World Bank across twenty-one countries.

But the study warns some uses of AI may expose people to additional harms and present significant risks for the
protection of their rights.

The study, published in the Handbook on Warfare and Artificial Intelligence, is by Professor Ana Beduschi, from
the University of Exeter Law School.

Professor Beduschi said: "AI technologies have the potential to further expand the toolkit of humanitarian missions
in their preparedness, response, and recovery.

"But safeguards must be put in place to ensure that AI systems used to support the work of humanitarians are not
transformed into tools of exclusion of populations in need of assistance. Safeguards concerning the respect and
protection of data privacy should also be put in place.

"The humanitarian imperative of 'do no harm' should be paramount to all deployment of AI systems in situations of
conflict and crisis."

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3

The study says humanitarian organisations designing AI systems should ensure data protection by design and by
default to minimise risks of harm - whether they are legally obliged to do so or not. They should also use Data
protection impact assessments (DPIAs) to understand the potential negative impacts of these technologies.

Grievance mechanisms should also be established so people can challenge decisions that were either automated
or made by humans with the support of AI systems if these adversely impacted them.

Professor Beduschi said: "AI systems can analyse large amounts of multidimensional data at increasingly fast
speeds, identify patterns in the data, and predict future behaviour. That can help organisations gain crucial insights
to better monitor and anticipate risks, such as a conflict outbreak or escalation.

"Yet, deploying AI systems in the humanitarian context is not without risks for the affected populations. Issues
include the poor quality of the data used to train AI algorithms, the existence of algorithmic bias, the lack of
transparency about AI decision-making, and the pervading concerns about the respect and protection of data
privacy.

"It is crucial that humanitarians abide by the humanitarian imperative of 'do not harm' when deciding whether to
deploy AI to support their action. In many cases, the sensible solution would be not to rely on AI technologies as
these may cause additional harm to civilian populations."

PR NewswireHONG KONG, April 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) is an
interdisciplinary field that combines geospatial science and artificial intelligence (AI). The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University (PolyU) is harnessing innovative GeoAI technologies to provide ground-breaking solutions for some of
the environmental and social challenges facing the world today, in various fields including transportation, urban and
public safely, planning, climate change and natural disasters.

Prof. Qihao WENG, Chair Professor of Geomatics and Artificial Intelligence of the Department of Land
Surveying and Geo-Informatics, and Global STEM Professor,established the PolyU Research Centre for
Artificial Intelligence in Geomatics (RCAIG), to focus on the development of original and innovative AI
methodologies and technologies for geomatics and their applications in urban areas, with the goal of it becoming a
global R&D hub in GeoAI. Prof. Weng has recently been honoured with the 2024 American Association of
Geographers (AAG) Wilbanks Prize for Transformational Research in Geography and the 2024 AAG Remote
Sensing Specialty Group Lifetime Achievement Honor Award for his ground-breaking contributions in
geography.One direction for the Research Centre is investigation into human-environment interactions in
urbanisation by utilising geospatial analytics, GeoAI and big data methods. Another direction is to create various
data products of global urban areas using Earth Observations (EO) and to provide EO-based urban data
services.As RCAIG Principal Investigator and Director,Prof. Wengsaid, "Earth observation is important as a guiding
compass for understanding changes in the environment and society. Our research focuses on diverse fields
including geospatial big data and AI, remote sensing, ground-based sensors, navigation and positioning, surveying
and geodesy, laser scanning, and photogrammetry. These technologies play a crucial role in addressing and
resolving key environmental and social challenges."In particular, GeoAI has revolutionised building monitoring by
utilising thousands of learnable parameters. An illustration of this is its ability to automatically learn and identify
general patterns of buildings such as colour and shape. This technology is crucially applied to detect disaster-
damaged buildings, retrieve building height, identify structural changes and estimate building energy consumption.
As a result, GeoAI has emerged as a mainstream solution for more efficient and insightful building
monitoring.Environmental monitoringIn the field of urbanisation monitoring, an RCAIG research team has
developed an impervious surface area based urban cellular automata (CA) model that can simulate the fractional
change of urban areas within each grid by utilising annual urban extent time series data obtained from satellite
observations. By categorising the historical pathways of urban area growth into different levels of urbanisation, the
model offers more detailed insights compared to traditional, binary, CA models. This demonstrates its great
potential in supporting sustainable development.Research conducted by Ms Wanru HE, an RCAIG doctoral
research assistant, and her team was reported in the paper "Modeling gridded urban fractional change using the
temporal context information in the urban cellular automata model", and has been published inCities. Their model

                                                                                                      Page 2 of 3
                  PolyU harnesses GeoAI technologies to enable sustainable urban development

effectively captures the dynamics of urban sprawl with significantly improved computational efficiency and
performance, and will help enable the modelling of urban growth at regional and even global level, under diverse
future urbanisation scenarios.GeoAI for traffic managementIn the area of smart traffic management, to enhance
the efficiency of ride-hailing platforms and achieve intelligent management of their services, the RCAIG research
team has developed a multi-agent order matching and vehicle repositioning approach. This innovative technology
focuses on coordinating the supply and demand of ride-hailing services, ultimately aiming to improve their overall
efficiency.Their approach provides a ground-breaking solution to tackle two critical aspects necessary for efficient
ride-hailing services. Firstly, it addresses order matching by efficiently assigning orders to available vehicles.
Secondly, it incorporates proactive vehicle repositioning, strategically deploying idle vehicles to regions with
potentially high demand.Based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, this innovation solves the complex
planning issues in transportation and offers a new perspective on a long-term spatio-temporal planning problem.
The research conducted by Ms Mingyue XU, another RCAIG researcher, and her team, was reported in the paper
"Multi-agent reinforcement learning to unify order-matching and vehicle-repositioning in ride-hailing services", and
has been published in theInternational Journal of Geographical Information Science. The study achieved
outstanding results, including reduced passenger rejection rates and driver idle time.About RCAIG With a focus on
GeoAI, RCAIG is dedicated to conducting research in diverse fields, including urban building and energy, urban
safety and security, environmental monitoring and conservation, urban resilience and public health. This aligns with
the 11th United Nations Sustainable Development Goal, which aims to create inclusive, safe, resilient and
sustainable cities and human settlements. Website:https://rcaig.com/Learn more about Prof. Qihao Weng's

(TNSres) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic University issued the following news release:

Geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) is an interdisciplinary field that combines geospatial science and artificial
intelligence (AI). The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU) is harnessing innovative GeoAI technologies to
provide ground-breaking solutions for some of the environmental and social challenges facing the world today, in
various fields including transportation, urban and public safely, planning, climate change and natural disasters.

Prof. Qihao WENG, Chair Professor of Geomatics and Artificial Intelligence of the Department of Land Surveying
and Geo-Informatics, and Global STEM Professor, established the PolyU Research Centre for Artificial
Intelligence in Geomatics (RCAIG), to focus on the development of original and innovative AI methodologies and
technologies for geomatics and their applications in urban areas, with the goal of it becoming a global R&D hub in
GeoAI. Prof. Weng has recently been honoured with the 2024 American Association of Geographers (AAG)
Wilbanks Prize for Transformational Research in Geography and the 2024 AAG Remote Sensing Specialty Group
Lifetime Achievement Honor Award for his ground-breaking contributions in geography.

One direction for the Research Centre is investigation into human-environment interactions in urbanisation by
utilising geospatial analytics, GeoAI and big data methods. Another direction is to create various data products of
global urban areas using Earth Observations (EO) and to provide EO-based urban data services.

As RCAIG Principal Investigator and Director, Prof. Weng said, "Earth observation is important as a guiding
compass for understanding changes in the environment and society. Our research focuses on diverse fields
including geospatial big data and AI, remote sensing, ground-based sensors, navigation and positioning, surveying
and geodesy, laser scanning, and photogrammetry. These technologies play a crucial role in addressing and
resolving key environmental and social challenges."

In particular, GeoAI has revolutionised building monitoring by utilising thousands of learnable parameters. An
illustration of this is its ability to automatically learn and identify general patterns of buildings such as colour and
shape. This technology is crucially applied to detect disaster-damaged buildings, retrieve building height, identify
structural changes and estimate building energy consumption. As a result, GeoAI has emerged as a mainstream
solution for more efficient and insightful building monitoring.

                                                                                                        Page 2 of 3

Environmental monitoring

In the field of urbanisation monitoring, an RCAIG research team has developed an impervious surface area based
urban cellular automata (CA) model that can simulate the fractional change of urban areas within each grid by
utilising annual urban extent time series data obtained from satellite observations. By categorising the historical
pathways of urban area growth into different levels of urbanisation, the model offers more detailed insights
compared to traditional, binary, CA models. This demonstrates its great potential in supporting sustainable
development.

Research conducted by Ms Wanru HE, an RCAIG doctoral research assistant, and her team was reported in the
paper "Modeling gridded urban fractional change using the temporal context information in the urban cellular
automata model", and has been published in Cities. Their model effectively captures the dynamics of urban sprawl
with significantly improved computational efficiency and performance, and will help enable the modelling of urban
growth at regional and even global level, under diverse future urbanisation scenarios.

GeoAI for traffic management

In the area of smart traffic management, to enhance the efficiency of ride-hailing platforms and achieve intelligent
management of their services, the RCAIG research team has developed a multi-agent order matching and vehicle
repositioning approach. This innovative technology focuses on coordinating the supply and demand of ride-hailing
services, ultimately aiming to improve their overall efficiency.

Their approach provides a ground-breaking solution to tackle two critical aspects necessary for efficient ride-hailing
services. Firstly, it addresses order matching by efficiently assigning orders to available vehicles. Secondly, it
incorporates proactive vehicle repositioning, strategically deploying idle vehicles to regions with potentially high
demand.

Based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, this innovation solves the complex planning issues in
transportation and offers a new perspective on a long-term spatio-temporal planning problem. The research
conducted by Ms Mingyue XU, another RCAIG researcher, and her team, was reported in the paper "Multi-agent
reinforcement learning to unify order-matching and vehicle-repositioning in ride-hailing services", and has been
published in the International Journal of Geographical Information Science. The study achieved outstanding results,
including reduced passenger rejection rates and driver idle time.

The following information was released by the University of Oxford:

The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), Oxford University Physics Department, IGAD Climate
Prediction and Applications Centre (ICPAC), and various national forecasting and meteorology agencies across
east Africa are joining forces to pioneer a transformative initiative that is revolutionising extreme weather forecasting
and early warning systems in the region.

In east Africa, where deadly floods have succeeded the worst drought in decades, climate change is accelerating
the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, and the need for precise and timely forecasts has never
been more critical. In an era marked by escalating weather variability, accurate weather predictions are essential to
safeguard lives and livelihoods.

Traditional weather forecasting models often fall short in accurately predicting extreme weather events, leaving
vulnerable communities at risk. However, by harnessing the power of Artificial Intelligence (AI), climate scientists
at Oxford University Physicshave developed a ground-breaking AI-based approach to weather forecasting, building
more local and accurate models offering high-resolution predictions of extreme weather such as floods. This can be
used to improve the accuracy of forecasts in lower-income countries where there is less observational weather
data, and without the need for additional costly supercomputers.

Dr Shruti Nath, a climate scientist at Oxford University Physics, said: 'Through collaboration with ECMWF, the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, on our common understanding of physical atmospheric
processes and the latest in AI and machine learning, we can supply state-of-the-art weather models to give more
accurate and local predictions enabling particular countries and regions to better anticipate and prepare for extreme
weather.'

Accurate early warnings are a game-changer in disaster risk management. By providing more timely and reliable
forecasts, governments and communities can take anticipatory actions that protect lives and livelihoods and
mitigate the impacts of extreme weather events before they occur. This proactive approach is transforming
humanitarian responses, shifting from reactive to preventative measures, ultimately saving more lives and reducing
costs associated with disaster relief.

                                                                                 Page 2 of 3

                                          EAST AFRICA

With its deep understanding of the challenges faced by those most affected by climate extremes, WFP is
instrumental in ensuring that technological advancements reach and benefit those in need, so they can plan,
prepare, and act proactively.

'I think we have the potential to change the world,' said Jesse Mason, Global Head of the Anticipatory Action
Programme at WFP. 'The World Food Programme has realised that we need to start protecting lives before they
need saving. We need to make sure we are acting ahead of extreme events, making sure that governments and
communities have the tools to prepare and mitigate the impacts these are having on livelihoods and lives.'

Collaboration with regional and local actors is at the heart of this project. As the regional climate centre for Eastern
Africa, ICPAC spearheads the capacity of its 11 member states in the region and offers the opportunity to scale the
cutting-edge technology in producing forecasts. Meanwhile, national meteorological agencies, including the Kenya
Meteorological Department and the Ethiopia Meteorological Institute, both partners for the new initiative, will ensure
that the technology is tailored to the specific needs of their communities.

The success of this initiative in east Africa sets a precedent for broader application. The vision extends beyond this
region, aiming to replicate this model in other parts of the world facing similar challenges. By continuing to refine AI-
based models and expanding our partnerships, the goal is to build a more resilient global community capable of
withstanding the worsening impacts of climate change.

This initiative was made possible with the support of Google.org to World Food Program USA, in support of WFP's
efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

(TNSres) -- Friends of the Earth issued the following news release:

***

Tech accountability and environmental groups sound the alarm on the potential harms of AI to the planet and
information ecosystems

***

Today, partners in the Climate Action Against Disinformation coalition released a report that maps the risks that
artificial intelligence poses to the climate crisis.

Topline points:

* AI systems require an enormous amount of energy and water, and consumption is expanding quickly. Estimates
suggest a doubling in 5-10 years.

* Generative AI has the potential to turbocharge climate disinformation, including climate change-related deepfakes,
ahead of a historic election year where climate policy will be central to the debate.

* The current AI policy landscape reveals a concerning lack of regulation on the federal level, with minor progress
made at the state level, relying on voluntary, opaque and unenforceable pledges to pause development, or provide
safety with its products.

"AI companies spread hype that they might save the planet, but currently they are doing just the opposite," said
Michael Khoo, Climate Disinformation Program Director at Friends of the Earth. "AI companies risk turbocharging
climate disinformation, and their energy use is causing a dangerous increase to overall US consumption, with a
corresponding increase of carbon emissions."

"We are already seeing how generative AI is being weaponized to spin up climate disinformation or copy legitimate
news sites to siphon off advertising revenue", said Sarah Kay Wiley, Director of Policy at Check My Ads, "Adtech

                                                                                                       Page 2 of 3
                 Artificial Intelligence A Threat to Climate Change, Energy Usage and Disinformation

companies are woefully unprepared to deal with Generative AI and the opaque nature of the digital advertising
industry means advertisers are not in control of where their ad dollars are going. Regulation is needed to help build
transparency and accountability to ensure advertisers are able to decide whether to support AI generated content."

"The evidence is clear: the production of AI is having a negative impact on the climate. The responsibility to
address those impacts lie with the companies producing and releasing AI at a breakneck speed," said Nicole
Sugerman, Campaign Manager at Kairos Fellowship. "We must not allow another 'move fast and break things' era
in tech; we've already seen how the rapid, unregulated growth of social media platforms led to previously
unimaginable levels of online and offline harm and violence. We can get it right this time, with regulation of AI
companies that can protect our futures and the future of the planet."

"The climate emergency cannot be confronted while online public & political discourse is polluted by fear, hate,
confusion and conspiracy," said Oliver Hayes, Head of Policy & Campaigns at Global Action Plan. "AI is
supercharging these problems, making misinformation cheaper and easier to produce and share than ever before.
In a year when 2 billion people are heading to the polls, this represents an existential threat to climate action. We
should stop looking at AI through the "benefit-only" analysis and recognise that, in order to secure robust
democracies and equitable climate policy, we must rein in big tech and regulate AI."

"The skyrocketing use of electricity and water, combined with its ability to rapidly spread disinformation, makes AI
one of the greatest emerging climate threat-multipliers, said Charlie Cray, Senior Strategist at Greenpeace USA,
"Governments and companies must stop pretending that increasing equipment efficiencies and directing AI tools
towards weather disaster responses are enough to mitigate AI's contribution to the climate emergency."

Previously, the coalition submitted letters to President Biden and Senator Chuck Schumer that call on them to
implement climate concerns into proposed AI legislation. The letters echo recommendations made in the report,
including:

* Transparency: Companies must publicly report on energy usage and emissions produced, assess any
environmental justice concerns related to developing AI technology and disclose how their AI models produce
information in a way that prioritizes climate science.

* Safety: Companies must be able to publicly demonstrate their products are safe for users and the environment. In
addition, governments should develop standards on AI safety reporting and invest in research that maps the risks
AI poses to the spread of climate disinformation.

* Accountability: Governments should enforce rules on investigating and mitigating the climate impacts of AI with
clear, strong penalties for noncompliance. Companies and their executives must be held accountable for any harms
that occur as a result of their products.

PR NewswireCOSMIC-T System Analyzes Canine Behavior to Locate Victims Faster During Live Search and
Rescue Training MissionsWOBURN, Mass., Sept. 24, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- In a training exercise conducted for
the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) utilizing federal canine search and rescue teams,
Scientific Systems demonstrated groundbreaking artificial intelligence software that enables robotic teammates to
understand the animal's search response behaviors and accurately predict the location of a lost victim.

This first-of-its-kind demonstration represents a breakthrough in teaming capabilities pairing autonomous systems
with living teammates.Utilizing an uncrewed aerial vehicle, the company's COSMIC-T (Collaborative Intelligence for
Olfactory Search Missions Integrating Canines and Technology) behavior analysis algorithms fused data from each
canine's GPS collar with the environment's topographical and meteorological information to generate and refine
real-time victim location predictions. Those predictions can be conveyed to other members of the search team or
used to direct the searches of autonomous UAV teammates to locate victims faster."We are extremely encouraged
by the results of COSMIC-T's collaboration with the federal search and rescue dogs during these live training
exercises," said Ssu-Hsin Yu, Vice President of Technology Innovation at Scientific Systems. "By teaming
autonomous systems with humans and non-authoritative teammates like dogs, we greatly improved the
effectiveness of search and rescue operations. This breakthrough demonstration of AI and real-time data-fusion
demonstrates COSMIC-T's ability to improve outcomes with collaboration between living partners and
technology."COSMIC-T's canine training data was captured during training missions conducted by the Boone
County Missouri Fire District, the sponsoring agency of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
Missouri Task Force One (MO-TF1)."It's been a privilege to assist Scientific Systems in its COSMIC-T program,"
said Scott Olsen, Fire Chief, Boone County Fire Protection District. "Canine Search Teams are one of the most
important components of our disaster response capabilities, and we're proud to have contributed data and
expertise towards technologies that can help advance the Search and Rescue mission."COSMIC-T builds upon the
success ofScientific Systems' DARPA I2O Teammate Aware Autonomy (TAA) program, which in 2020
demonstrated the world's first successful execution of a search and rescue exercise using a trained search and
rescue canine and Scientific Systems' autonomousRAPTOR UAVwithout any instruction or intervention by a human
handler.About Scientific Systems Company, Inc.

The following information was released by Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC):

The APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC) concluded its meeting in Tokyo this week, calling for decisive action
to boost trade, digitalization and climate response.

"Tackling trade and investment barriers, promoting digitalization and accelerating the climate response is urgent.
We can't wait any longer" said Julia Torreblanca, the 2024 Chair of ABAC.

In that regard, Torreblanca announced that ABAC has finalized its recommendations for APEC Leaders addressing
these challenges, under its' theme for this year, 'People, Business, and Prosperity,' to be formally presented during
the APEC Economic Leaders' Week taking place November in Lima, Peru. ABAC also prepared detailed
recommendations to Ministers of Finance, Health, Energy, Food Security, and Small and Medium Enterprises.

"Achieving our goals requires a seamless commercial environment built on strong foundations. APEC needs to
make the Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific a reality, and ensure that the World Trade Organization (WTO)
remains relevant and effective", said Torreblanca.

"All APEC economies should join the new WTO E-commerce Agreement, which prevents the use of tariffs on digital
trade and lays a critical foundation."

Torreblanca also highlighted the need for a renewed APEC Investment Facilitation Agenda and enhanced supply
chain cooperation.

"Another key focus of ABAC is on boosting interoperable digitalization in our region and enabling small businesses
to access digital tools like interoperable paperless trade and artificial intelligence (AI). All this, within an AI
framework that maximizes benefits while mitigating the risks, particularly for workers," she added.

"We have also identified concrete actions to enable micro, small and medium enterprises, especially those led by
women and Indigenous entrepreneurs, as well as those in the informal economy, to succeed," Torreblanca noted.

Lastly, addressing the climate crisis, Torreblanca called for urgent collective action to ensure sustainable and
resilient growth.

                                                                            Page 2 of 3
     APEC BUSINESSES CALL FOR GREATER ACTION AMID INSUFFICIENT ECONOMIC GROWTH AND
                                INCREASING CLIMATE RISK

"The world has now experienced over 12 consecutive months of temperatures exceeding 1.5 degrees above pre-
industrial levels. Public-private sector collaboration will be essential to unlock and scale up financing for the energy
transition, innovation and disaster resiliency," she emphasized.

"We are also advocating for a new Greener Trade Framework to support emissions reduction throughout supply
chains and the transition to a low-carbon economy."

ABAC delegates had the opportunity to engage in different events with local business community and senior
government officials, including Japan's Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Minister for Foreign Affairs Yoko Kamikawa,
Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry Saito Ken, Minister for Digital Transformation Taro Kono, and Mayor of
Tokyo Yuriko Koike. Torreblanca expressed gratitude to the government for their continued support of the APEC
process, and ABAC Japan for their excellent hosting of the meeting.

The following information was released by the Federation of American Scientists (FAS):

Text by Aleksandra Srdanovic

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) faces several obstacles to advancing its mission on
artificial intelligence (AI) at a time when the field is rapidly advancing and consequences for falling short are wide-
reaching. To enable NIST to quickly and effectively respond, Congress should authorize the establishment of a
NIST Foundation to unlock additional resources, expertise, flexible funding mechanisms, and innovation, while
ensuring the foundation is stood up with strong ethics and oversight mechanisms.

Challenge

The rapid advancement of AI presents unprecedented opportunities and complex challenges as it is increasingly
integrated into the way that we work and live. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an
agency within the Department of Commerce, plays an important role in advancing AI-related research,
measurement, evaluation, and technical standard setting. NIST has recently been given responsibilities under
President Biden's October 30, 2023, Executive Order (EO) on Safe, Security, and Trustworthy Artificial
Intelligence. To support the implementation of the EO, NIST launched an AI Safety Institute (AISI), created an AI
Safety Institute Consortium (AISIC), and released a strategic vision for AISI focused on safe and responsible AI
innovation, among other actions.

While work is underway to implement Biden's AI EO and deliver on NIST's broader AI mandate, NIST faces
persistent obstacles in its ability to quickly and effectively respond. For example, recent legislation like the Fiscal
Responsibility Act of 2023 has set discretionary spending limits for FY26 through FY29, which means less funding
is available to support NIST's programs. Even before this, NIST's funding has remained at a fractional level (around
$11.3 billion each year) of the industries it is supposed to set standards for. Since FY22, NIST has received lower
appropriations than it has requested.

In addition, NIST is struggling to attract the specialized science and technology (SandT) talent that it needs due to
competition for technical talent, a lack of competitive pay compared to the private sector, a gender-imbalanced
culture, and issues with transferring institutional knowledge when individuals transition out of the agency, according
to a February 2023 Government Accountability Office report. Alongside this, NIST has limitations on how it can
work with the private sector and is subject to procurement processes that can be a barrier to innovation, an issue
the agency has struggled with in years past, according to a September 2005 Inspector General report.

                                                                                                          Page 2 of 5
                       A NIST FOUNDATION TO SUPPORT THE AGENCY'S AI MANDATE

The consequences of NIST not fulfilling its mandate on AI due to these challenges and limitations are wide-
reaching: a lack of uniform AI standards across platforms and countries; reduced AI trust and security; limitations
on AI innovation and commercialization; and the United States losing its place as a leading international voice on AI
standards and governance, giving the Chinese government and companies a competitive edge as they seek to
become a world leader in artificial intelligence.

Opportunity

An agency-related foundation could play a crucial role in addressing these challenges and strengthening NIST's AI
mission. Agency-related nonprofit research foundations and corporations have long been used to support the
research and development (RandD) mandates of federal agencies by enabling them to quickly respond to
challenges and leverage additional resources, expertise, flexible funding mechanisms, and innovation from the
private sector to support service delivery and the achievement of agency programmatic goals more efficiently and
effectively.

One example is the CDC Foundation. In 1992, Congress passed legislation authorizing the creation of the CDC
Foundation, an independent, 501(c)(3) public charity that supports the mandate of the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) by facilitating strategic partnerships between the CDC and the philanthropic community and
leveraging private-sector funds from individuals, philanthropies, and corporations. The CDC is legally able to
capitalize on these private sector funds through two mechanisms: (1) Section 231 of the Public Health Service Act,
which authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services "to accept on behalf of the United States gifts made
unconditionally by will or otherwise for the benefit of the Service or for the carrying out of any of its functions," and
(2) the legislation that authorized the creation of the CDC Foundation, which establishes its governance structure
and provides the CDC director the authority to accept funds and voluntary services from the foundation to aid and
facilitate the CDC's work.

Since 1995, the CDC Foundation has raised $2.2 billion to support 1,400 public health programs in the United
States and worldwide. The importance of this model was evident at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic when the
CDC Foundation supported the Centers by quickly raising to deploy various resources supporting communities. In
the same way that the CDC Foundation bolstered the CDC's work during the greatest public health challenge in 100
years, a foundation model could be critical in helping an agency like NIST deploy private, philanthropic funds from
an independent source to quickly respond to the challenge and opportunity of AI's advancement.

Another example of an agency-related entity is the newly established Foundation for Energy Security and
Innovation (FESI), authorized by Congress via the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act following years of community
advocacy to support the mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) in advancing energy technologies and
promoting energy security. FESI released a Request for Information in February 2023 to seek input on DOE
engagement opportunities with FESI and appointed its inaugural board of directors in May 2024.

NIST itself has demonstrated interest in the potential for expanded partnership mechanisms such as an agency-
related foundation. In its 2019 report, the agency notes that "foundations have the potential to advance the
accomplishment of agency missions by attracting private sector investment to accelerate technology maturation,
transfer, and commercialization of an agency's RandD outcomes." NIST is uniquely suited to benefit from an
agency-related foundation and its partnership flexibilities, given that it works on behalf of, and in collaboration with,
industry on RandD and to develop standards, measurements, regulations, and guidance.

But how could NIST actually leverage a foundation model? A June 2024 paper from the Institute for Progress
presents ideas for how a foundation model could support NIST's work on AI and emerging tech. These include
setting up a technical fellowship program that can compete with formidable companies in the AI space for top talent;
quickly raising money and deploying resources to conduct "rapid capability evaluations for the risks and benefits of
new AI systems"; and hosting large-scale prize competitions to develop "complex capabilities benchmarks for
artificial intelligence" that would not be subject to usual monetary limitations and procedural burdens.

A NIST Foundation, of course, would have implications for the agency's work beyond AI and other emerging
technologies. Interviews with experts at the Federation of American Scientists working across various SandT

domains have revealed additional use cases for a NIST Foundation that map to the agency's topical areas,
including but not limited to:

Set standards for industrial biomanufacturing to improve standardization and enable the U.S. bioeconomy to be
competitive.

Support the creation and adoption of building codes and standards for construction and development in wildfire-
prone regions.

Enable standardization across the transportation system (for example, through electric vehicle charging
standardization) to ensure safety and efficiency.

Enable more energy-efficient building and lower impacts of power demand on the grid by improving the
interoperability of building systems and components through standardizing the communication between these
systems.

Improve disaster resilience mechanisms by creating common standards to regularly collect, validate, share, and
report on disaster data in consistent and interoperable formats.

Critical to the success of a foundation model is for it to have the funding needed to support NIST's mission and
programs. While it is difficult to estimate exactly how much funding a NIST Foundation could draw in from external
sources, there is clearly significant appetite from philanthropy to invest in AI research and initiatives. Reporting from
Inside Philanthropy uncovered that some of the biggest philanthropic institutions and individual donorssuch as Eric
and Wendy Schmidt and Open Philanthropyhave donated approximately $1.5 billion to date to AI work. And in
November 2023, 10 major philanthropies announced they were committing $200 million to fund "public interest
efforts to mitigate AI harms and promote responsible use and innovation."

Plan of Action

In order to enable NIST to more effectively and efficiently deliver on its mission, especially as it relates to rapid
advancement in AI, Congress should authorize the establishment of a NIST Foundation. While the structure of
agency-related foundations may vary depending on the agency they support, they all have several high-level
elements in common, including but not limited to:

Legal status: Established as 501(c)(3) entities, which enables them to receive tax-deductible donations and grants.

Governance: Operate independently and are governed by a board of directors representative of industry, academia,
the agency, advocacy groups, and other constituencies.

Fundraising and financial management: Authorized to accept funds from external sources, with the flexibility to
allocate them to initiatives in support of the agency's mission.

Transparency and accountability: Subject to regular financial reporting requirements and audits to ensure proper
management of external funds.

The activities of existing agency-related foundations have left them subject to criticism over potential conflicts of
interest. A 2019 Congressional Research Service report highlights several case studies demonstrating concerning
industry influence over foundation activities, including allegations that the National Football League (NFL) attempted
to influence the selection of research applicants for a National Institutes of Health (NIH) study on chronic traumatic
encephalopathy, funded by the NFL through the FNIH, and the implications of the Coca-Cola Company making
donations to the CDC Foundation for obesity and diet research.

In order to mitigate conflict of interest, transparency, and oversight issues, a NIST Foundation should consider
rigorous policies that ensure a clear separation between external donations and decisions related to projects.
Foundation policies and communications with donors should make explicit that donations will not result in specific
project focus, and that donors will have no decision-making authority as it relates to project management. Donors

would have to disclose any potential interests in foundation projects they would like to fund and would not be
allowed to be listed as "anonymous" in the foundation's regular financial reporting and auditing processes.

Additionally, instituting mechanisms for engaging with a diverse range of stakeholders is key to ensure the
Foundation's activities align with NIST's mission and programs. One option is to mandate the establishment of a
foundation advisory board composed of topical committees that map to those at NIST (such as AI) and staffed with
experts across industry, academia, government, and advocacy groups who can provide guidance on strategic
priorities and proposed initiatives. Many initiatives that the foundation might engage in on behalf of NIST, such as
AI safety, would also benefit from strong public engagement (through required public forums and diverse
stakeholder focus groups preceding program stand-up) to ensure that partnerships and programs address a broad
range of potential ethical considerations and serve a public benefit.

Alongside specific structural components for a NIST Foundation, metrics will help measure its effectiveness. While
quantitative measures only tell half the story, they are a starting point for evaluating whether a foundation is
delivering its intended impact. Examples of potential metrics include:

The total amount of funding raised from external sources such as philanthropic institutions, individual donors, and
corporate entities

The number of strategic partnerships engaged in between the foundation and entities across government,
academia, advocacy groups, and industry

Alignment of programs and initiatives to NIST's mission, which can be determined through reviewing rubrics used to
evaluate projects and programs before they are stood up and implemented

Speed of response, which can be measured from the number of days between the formal identification of an
opportunity to be addressed and the execution of a foundation initiative

Conclusion

Given financial and structural constraints, NIST risks being unable to quickly and efficiently fulfill its mandate related
to AI, at a time when innovative technologies, systems, and governance structures are sorely needed to keep pace
with a rapidly advancing field. Establishing a NIST Foundation to support the agency's AI work and other priorities
would bolster NIST's capacity to innovate and set technical standards, thus encouraging the safe, reliable, and
ethical deployment of AI technologies. It would also increase trust in AI technologies and lead to greater uptake of
AI across various sectors where it could drive economic growth, improve public services, and bolster U.S. global
competitiveness. And it would help make the case for leveraging public-private partnership models to tackle other
critical SandT priorities.
