**quanteda** has three basic types of objects:

1.  [Corpus](/basic-operations/corpus)
    
    * Saves character strings and variables in a data frame
    * Combines texts with document-level variables

2.  [Tokens](/basic-operations/tokens)
    
    * Stores tokens in a list of vectors
    * More efficient than character strings, but preserves positions of words 
    * Positional (string-of-words) analysis is performed using `textstat_collocations()`, `tokens_ngrams()` and `tokens_select()` or `fcm()` with `window` option

3.  [Document-feature matrix (DFM)](/basic-operations/dfm)

    * Represents frequencies of features in documents in a matrix
    * The most efficient structure, but it does not have information on positions of words 
    * Non-positional (bag-of-words) analysis are profrmed using many of the `textstat_*` and `textmodel_*` functions 

Text analysis with **quanteda** goes through all those three types of objects either explicitly or implicitly.

For example, if character vectors are given to `dfm()`, it internally constructs corpus and tokens objects before creating a DFM.
