This website contains a step-by-step introduction to quantitative text analysis using **quanteda**. The chapters cover a brief introduction to the statistical programming language R, how to import text data, basic operations of **quanteda**, how to construct a corpus, tokens objects, a document-feature matrix, and how to conduct advanced operations. The final chapter deals with text scaling (e.g., Wordscores, Wordfish, correspondence analysis) and document classification using Naive Bayes and topic models.

This website consist of over 30 sections. If you click on the name of a chapter on the left-hand side of this page, the sections will pop up. You can also use the "Search" field in the top-left corner to look up the occurrence of specific terms or R functions covered in the tutorials. 

This website is created for workshops held by the **quanteda** team and for users who look for a comprehensible step-by-step introduction to text analysis using R. We have also created several additional useful [resources](https://quanteda.io), such as vignettes, replications, a cheatsheet and a comparison to functions in **quanteda** and other packages for quantitative text analysis.

Examples in this tutorial are written for **quanteda** version `r packageVersion("quanteda")`. Please check if you have the same version installed by a command `packageVersion("quanteda")`.
