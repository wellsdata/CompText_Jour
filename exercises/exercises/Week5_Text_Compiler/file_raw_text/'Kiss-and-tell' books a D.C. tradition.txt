Author: Ron Suskind, with the cooperation of Paul O'Neill
Relationship to president: O'Neill was Bush's Treasury secretary
Published: 2004

Published: 2000
Description: Chronicles the scandals and internal conflicts Stephanopoulos dealt with in the White House. "I'm still mystified by the Clinton paradox," he wrote. "How could a president so intelligent, so compassionate, so public-spirited and so conscious of his place in history act in such a stupid, selfish, and self-destructive manner?"
Title: Speaking Out
Author: Larry Speakes
Relationship to president: President Reagan's press secretary
Published: 1988
Description: An embarrassing account of Reagan, his wife, Nancy, and other members of the president's staff and family. Speakes described Reagan as an "inexperienced and sometimes downright disinterested president," and he said he concocted quotes that were attributed to Reagan.
Title: Triumph of Politics

Published: 1939
Description: First critical writing of the New Deal, which Moley originally had promoted. He wrote of Roosevelt as overly receptive to ideas. "So far as I know he makes no effort to check up on anything I or anyone else has told him. I wonder what would happen if we should selfishly try to put things over on him."
