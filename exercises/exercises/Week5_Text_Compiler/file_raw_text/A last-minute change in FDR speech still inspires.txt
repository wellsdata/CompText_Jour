President Franklin D. Roosevelt's famous line about the only fear is fear itself was inserted in his first inaugural speech at the last minute by an aide who may have gotten it from a newspaper advertisement.
Today, Roosevelt's words still comfort and embolden as people use gloves to try to avoid handling possibly anthrax-tainted mail.
He knew about fear from personal experience. Roosevelt woke one morning in 1921 at age 39, paralyzed from the neck down by polio.
But he re-entered politics 6 years later and won the presidential election in 1932.
On Inauguration Day in 1933, a third of the country was jobless.
Thousands of farmers had lost their land. In the cities, people stood in soup lines and lived in shanties and dreamed of revolution. "We are at the end of our string," defeated President Hoover said that morning.
In Washington, where 100,000 gathered for the ceremony, troops set up machine guns in case of a riot.
Roosevelt struggled to the podium and began to read the speech he had written with his aide, Raymond Moley.
But the best line was contributed by another aide, Louis Howe. Moley said he wasn't sure what inspired Howe but thought he might have gotten the idea from a line in a newspaper ad.
Historian William Manchester tells what happened after the speech: "Hoover slumped and stared at his feet, but in the three-decker tenements with radios, the hungry children looked up; in the county courthouses, the embattled farmers looked up; housewives patching threadbare clothes looked up; there was a kind of magic in the air."
