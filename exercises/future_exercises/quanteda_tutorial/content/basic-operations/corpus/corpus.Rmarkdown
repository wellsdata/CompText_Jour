```{r, message=FALSE}
require(quanteda)
require(readtext)
```

You can create a corpus from various available sources:

1. A character vector consisting of one document per element

2. A data frame consisting of a character vector for documents, and additional vectors for document-level variables

3. A VCorpus or SimpleCorpus class object created by the **tm** package 


## Character vector

`data_char_ukimmig2010` is a named character vector and consists of sections of British election manifestos on immigration and asylum.

```{r}
corp_immig <- corpus(data_char_ukimmig2010, 
                     docvars = data.frame(party = names(data_char_ukimmig2010)))
print(corp_immig)
summary(corp_immig)
```


## Data frame

Using `read.csv()`, load an example file from `path_data` as a data frame called `dat_inaug`. Note that your file does not to be formatted as `.csv`. You can build a **quanteda** corpus from any file format that R can import as a data frame (see, for instance, the [**rio**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rio/index.html) package for importing various files as data frames into R).

```{r}
# set path
path_data <- system.file("extdata/", package = "readtext")

# import csv file
dat_inaug <- read.csv(paste0(path_data, "/csv/inaugCorpus.csv"))
names(dat_inaug)
```

Construct a corpus from the "texts" column in `dat_inaug`.

```{r}
corp_inaug <- corpus(dat_inaug, text_field = "texts")
print(corp_inaug)
summary(corp_inaug, 5)
```

You can edit the `docnames` for a corpus to change them from `text1`, `text2` etc., to a meaningful identifier. 

```{r}
docid <- paste(dat_inaug$Year, 
               dat_inaug$FirstName, 
               dat_inaug$President, sep = " ")
docnames(corp_inaug) <- docid
print(corp_inaug)
```

## Vcorpus

**quanteda** also allows you to import a **tm** `VCorpus` object.

```{r}
corp_tm <- tm::VCorpus(tm::VectorSource(data_char_ukimmig2010))
corp_quanteda <- corpus(corp_tm)
```
