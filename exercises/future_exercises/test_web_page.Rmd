## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#### Scale Dollars and Percentages

#### Dual Axis Format

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
income_vacancy %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = community)) +
  geom_point(aes(y=income_2020), color = "#64D197", stroke=5) +
  geom_point(aes(y=vacant_2020*1000), stroke=5, color = "#FB8AE3") +
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "2020 Income (Green)", limits=c(0, 62000), labels=scales::dollar_format(),
    sec.axis = sec_axis(~./60000, name="2020 Percent Vacancies (Red)", labels = scales::percent))+
  #scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(
    title = "Income and Vacancies of Baltimore Neighborhoods 2020",
    x = "Community",
    caption = "source: BNIA Data - By: Parker Leipzig and Rob Wells"
  )
```
