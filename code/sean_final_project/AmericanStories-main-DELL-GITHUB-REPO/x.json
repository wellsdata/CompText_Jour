The mill is regarded as one or\nthe finest ever sent to these Islands.\n1t contains a number of labor saving\nand automatic devices which it is be-\nlieved will enable IL TO run with fewer\nmen than any other mill now in the\nIslands.\n\n\nThe contract price for the mill be-\ntween the American Sugar Company\nana oliver O.

The reason why the McBryde\ncompany does not pay cash, is that in\nthe plans for the development of the\nplantation it was not expected to put\nup new mill just at this time, the\ncompany having milling facilities that\nwould enable it to take care of the\npresent crop.
