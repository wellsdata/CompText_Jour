 East Tennessee is greatly interSected, es- 1 DeciaIly in the northern part of it, with mOun- iainouseridges, ofgreater or less elevation, and having intervening vallies of varying widths. This region has been very properly termed the Switzerland of the United States""

 ' The yallies in East Tennessee are fertile. The productions are corn, wheat, rye, oats, potatoes, &c. in great abundance, especially corn, which grows remarkably well, and much better than wheat. Cotton is also much cultivated in the Hiwasses district.- Fruits, such as apples, peaches, &c. are very abundant. never saw orchards more heavi- .ly loaded than those of East Tennessee. This region also abOunds in honey. Almost every family along the roads on which I passed possessed several, and some large number of hives of bees, which yield plentiful sup ply or one of the greatest luxuries of life as well as the most wholesome articles of diet. Gold mines exist in the Unaka Mountains, and aise in the Hiwassee district.

 The greatest obstacle to the more rapid in- crease Of this country in wealth and popula- ton. is the great difficulty of exporting its productions to, a market, and of importing such foreign articles as are needed. To boat them down the waters Of the Tennessee with all lts difficulties, to New Orleans, is a long

 and tedious business, and even subjects the

 trader to jneonveniencies to which the trader from Ohio, and indeed from any other nor tion of the Valley of the Mississippi, is a stranger. And to wagon them across to Bal finsore or Lynchburg. as is most frequently done, and to bring merchandise by the same mode of conveyance from those places, which IS the only way now pursued uf obtaining it, isattended with enormous expense. At pres. ent the inhabitants are greatly stirred up on Q fsNfh hAy vuSA Knoxville to Lynchburg in Virginia.

 There are many interesting towns and viIl- ages in East Tennessee, such as Rlountsville. Aogersviile, Jonesboro, Greenyille, Knoxville, Maryville, Athens. Sc. Of all these Knox. vile IS by far the most important. 1t is on the south western bank of the Holstou. on hily site, and Eear the centre of this section of the state. 1t has population of about 5000. There are two Presbyterian and one Methodist churches here. The college stands on an elevated hill to the south of the town. and has most commanding view of the whole country around. There are thirty two students here at present in all the class es who are instructed by president and two professors.

 There are two other colleges in East Ten nessee. It is obvious that one college .n an enlarged scale would be enough. Three coI- leges in line of less than one hundred miles IS certainly too many for this new and com parativeDy thinIy settled country.

 At MaryviIe, a village eighteen miles southwest of Knoxville, is a literary and the Iological ipstitution, established by the Rev. pr. Anderson. A farm is connected with this seminary, which affords much support, as well as suitable exercise to the students.

 Mytour through this region has been very interesting journey tO me. The scenery is heabtiful, often sublime always pleasing.-l The mountains, valleys, caverns, the villages and rivers of this region. will always occasion much interest in an attentive traveller. The and kindness which enjoyed. will give me many endearing recollections of East Tennessee.

 This is region upon which the Spirit of f4he Lord has often been poured cut. There is muchs very much, good religion in East Ten nessee. noticed in several places perma- nent camps for Presbyterian comp meetings, several of which are held annually, and have been so for many years.

 Ersensive Peach Orchards.-Tt is stated in the Springfield Republican, that MT. Jones ol Shrewsbury, N. J., about 25 miles from Newsiork, has the largest peach orchards in America: One of them is mile and half long,, and contains no acres the other con- tains 40 acres, in both there are about twen- ty-two thousand trees. They were com menced about nine years since, and the prof Its are fast raising the enterprising owner rom poverty to wealth. It is said he last year refused seven thousand dollars for the peaches on the trees. The crop this year is not 50 abundant, but the price in market is sufficiently increased to afford him n hand some income. A few weeks since. MT. Jones sent cargo of four hundred basketa fo thc New-York market, which readily sold at tw a dollars a basket. A basket contains a little less than bushel. Some of his better peaches have since sold quick at five dollars a

 hashel. The soil of these orchards is worth

 very little for any other purpose, and is poor

 CT than most of our pine plains.

 DTeadJM Accident.-On the 9th inst. in the

 forenoon, MT. Isaac Belknap, principal me- chanlst in the Georgia Factory, Smithtield. was engaged in adjusting some machinery nean the regulator, unknowa tts, a lad, who nj the same time entered the dark passage be. tween the two water wheels, in order to oil tho gudgeons. For this purpose the lad had raised trap door. over the iron geerinp. and was just about shutting it, when Mr. Relknan Eh having hnished what he was doing. st.nDcd rom an elevated platform, directly upon fine spot. where he had before passed over the geeriDg on the. trap door.

 1Ir Clay OPT The United States Bank.-All admirers of splendid eloquence and happy il- lustration, must be pie ased with the annexed extract from MT Clay's speech against re- chartcrng the United States Bank MT Clay was then a strict constructionist, and went for the Constitution and nothing but the Constitu- tion. For this he was hated by every federal ist and latitudinarian in the land. Now, these men are his warmest supporters, and whilst the Constitution is construed to mean any thing and every thing, the most patriotic hor- TOT is expressed by his followers, at the bare mention of estate rights

 The Iasuqrection.-N informed as ma nv ofour readers as we could, through the medium of handbiil, last Thursday even- ing, of the breaking out of servile in- surrection in the lower country. The following re the latest accounts from the scene of action, which show that the first rumors were much exaggerated. Never thefess, there has been much blood shed; and the account from the Petersburg h. telligencer will harrow up the feelings of the people. Every thing IS quiet here, and no uneasinessis IS felt, as indeed there IS no occasion for any.

 From the Richmond Enquirer of .4ug. 20

 .NeaoS ofthe Day.-A letter was received on Tuesday morning from Col. Trezvant, who lives at Jerusalem, in the county of Southampton, stating that an instruction had broken out among the blacks-that several white families had been destroyed; that arms and ammunition were wanting in Southampton, and that a considerable military force might be required to subdue the disturbers. Jerusalem is about seven ty miles from Richmond. Col. T's letter was written on the 2lst-evidently in great haste-without giving numbers, names, &c. It was sent by express to the authorities of the town of Petersburg, and

 

 city. It was received on Tuesday morn ing and laid before the Governor. The Council being convened, (there being no other member in the city than the Lieut.. Governor,) advice was given to take the earliest and most efficient measures. Ar engagements were immediately taken by the Chief Magistrate for the purpose.- Arms and ammunition were despatched in wagons to the county of Southampton.- The four volunteer companies of Peters burg, the dragoon and Lafayette artillery company of Richmond, one volunteer com pany from Norfolk, and one from Ports mouth, and the regiments of Southampton and Sussex, were at once ord dered out The dragoons of this city, commanded by Capt. Randolph Harrison, took up the line of march on Tuesday evening. The La fayette artillery commanded by Capt John B. Richardson, embarked at 8 o'clock the same evening, in the steamboat Norfolk, to land at Smithfeld. We presume that Brigadier General Eppes will command the detaehments.

 Another express on the same evening from the Mayor of Petersburg, requested the governor to send over arms which were accordingly despatched.

 No authentic accounts have been recei- ved of the character of this unexpected the number of blacks col lected, of their designs. of the mischief they have done; whether they are the mere runaways who have broken out from the swamps, or how many slaves of the neghborng plantations have joined whether they have got together for mere rapine and robbery, or for what. But that these wretches will rue the day on which they broke loose upon the neighholing | fof, .c forr far 1o retribution will fall upon their heads Dearly will they pay for their madness and their n.isdeed

 Rumors are, of course, as ""thick as blackberres.e There is, of course, much eXaggeration in all our verbal and written accounts. The short letters which have been received, are themselves the mere statements of rumors, none of them having been written by actual observers of the scene. We give such as have been recei- ved--the reader will know how to make allowance for the exaggerations in all such matters.

 PETERSBURG, Aug. g, lS31s I sThe only information received since last night, IS from gentleman who came passenger in the stage from Halifax, N. C.. He was informed in Hicks Ford, that about thirty persons had been murdered. ""A company or between UVe anu SIX nun dred had been formed, and gone in pursuit of the negroes, who had retreated into the swamps.

 The driver, who came about twenty miles from here, says a Mr. Harris of Southampton as robbed of E ,0C0 dollars and his son and son-in-law murdered. cannot say positively that this information can be relied on.

 Ertract of letter iron, one of the Rich-

 moad Dragoons, dated Petersburg, Tncs-

 dag 4iighi, Il o'clock:

 sI have been diligent in my inquiries to obtain information that can be relied on.- The result is, about 250 negroes from a l lCamp-meeting about the Dismal Swamp, set out on a marauding excursion, and have, for the sake of plunder, murdered about 60 persons. We shall start on the morning at day-break for Southampton, and will, suppose, be back in two or three days.'

 The Kentucky Resolutions of 1799.-The Nulli- flyers of South Carolina mainly rely upon the reso- lutons presented to the Legislature of Kentucky in 1799, to sustain the doctrine of Notification; and by falsely imputing to Mir Jefferson the authorship of those resolutions, they lay claim to that veneraed Patriot as al advocate of that tratorous doctrine. The following is the sentence upon which the Null lies rely:

 "" That the several states who formed that instru- ment, being sovereign and independent, have the unquestionabe right to judge of it's nfracton, and that Notification by those soveregntes of all un- authorized acts done under the colour of that nstru ment, is the iightfnl remedy""

 Every man who can ""tell hawk from handsaw"" will perceive that the only analogy between the doc Urine affirmed by the foregoing extract and that asserted by portion of the South Carolina politi- cians, is, that they both the soord Notifications"" for, as to its application they entirely differ No one doubts that the seUera States ,cho formed the constitution, ""haue the unquestonable right to judge of it's infractions, and that Notification by those soUeretgntieS"" of all unconstitutional acts lis the nghtfu remedy"" But is it therefore true, as Messrs Calhoun, Hayne, &c. contend, that each State ,rho IS party to the constitution has this right? The Nullies are very fond of comparing the union to mercantile copartnership, and the States to indivi- duas composing the firm: Let us test this principle by their favor i,e mode of comparison. A. B. c. and D. enter into articles of agreement, as merchants and partners, and execute written copra~. dcG ing their respective rights and duties, and confdng the transaction of their joint business to an agent from which compact 1t results that they may at any time annu the acts of the agent whom they have emplOyed-does it thence follow that any of them may do this? Assuredy not; for if it did, then would any one member of the firm necessarily hold in his hands power greater than du the others So with the States. ""Ih0se s0UerCignes"" in the terms of the Kentucky Resolutions, hare the power to null an unconstitutional law of Congress-; but one of those sovereignes has no such power; else, that is invested with more potential rights, not only than either of their sister States, but than au cf them comb,ned; proposition, the startling absurdity of which must strike every man at single gance-a proposition, the admission of which would be tanta- mount to dissolution of the Union; for if il is to form the basis of national legislation. it is clear any mathematical demonstration can be, that the Union cannot last one year. But the subjoined ex- tract from the resolution, will show that the Legislature of Kentucky, in sanctionng the forego ing sentiment, did not attempt to assert the claim which is now ostentatiously set up by South Carol- na. On the contrary, in the very same breath in which they denounce the Alien and Sedition Laws unconstitutional they declare their determination to bow to them, although ""hey would never to oppose them in c constitutional manner"" And what did they regard a constitutional opposition7 Was it by setting up their decision as apthoritatve?- Was it by defying the laws and those who had sworn faithfully to execute them? Was it by declaring that they ""had counted the cost of the Union"" and found it's expressions overbaanced it's blessings2- Was it by avowing that ""having exhausted the ar- gunnent, they would stand by their arms?""-NO, mo- thing of this reasonable character proceeded from that patriotic State; and it is equally foul islander, unnaturally so when it proceeds from any of her own offspring to assert that Virginia ever gave it the sanction of her unspotted name-a islander which the pen of Madison has effectually wiped from her escutcheon, and from which his venerable friend of Monticello, would be no less eager to vndicate her name, did he not sleep with the unforgotten dead- The Legislature of Kentucky declared

 ""That also this Commonwealth, a. party to the federal compact, ,oM boao to the ta'os c the CnOn, yet it does at the same time declare, that 1t will not now nor never hereafter cease to oppose, m e Com stuiionaI ,xanner, every attempt from what quarter soever offered, to violate that compact-and fnay, in order that pretext or arguments may be drawn from supposed acquiescence on the part ol the Commonw in the econstitutionaty of those laws, and be thereby used as similar future violations of the federal compact this Commonwealth does now enter against them its SOLEMN PROTEST""

 But even if these resolutions did sanction the doc urine of Ratification, as defined by the South Caro- lima dsunionsts, still it would not enttle them to claim Mir Jefferson one of their fraternity-for hc soas not their autori In letter to Wilson Cary Nicholas, dated in September 1799 in reference to preparing something the subject to be laid before the then ensuing session of the Kentucky Legisla- ture, he expressly declined tt. They were, it is be- iieyed, prepared by John Breckenridge. Mir jeifer- prepared the resolutions adopted by the Legisla- lure of that State in 1798, and ""they (says the En- quircr) do not contain the passage about notification, nor use the soord at au."" The truth is, Mir Jeffer- sons character combine two qualities which render it morally certain, independent of the example fur nished by his whole life, that he never could have favored such monstrous doctrine-we mean pro- found wisdom and unsuspected patriotism. Such a man could have nothing to do with Modification. - The head or heart of him who advocates it must of necessity be wrong in relation to that subject-as soma men whom we occasionally meet wb are tona on most themes, but quite deranged on some particular subject. ..

 The Virginia Resolutions are just as far from countenancing the odious doctrine as are those of Kentucky. Indeed they were both the offspring of the same party and their sentiments were intended to be- as they are reflections of each other.

 Orders respectfully solicited. have so repeatedly reminded my friends and the public, of the necessity of their lend ing liberal support to the establishment, that were to continue the call-without an a. pology,-- would seem to carry tone of com plaint with it. This is far from my intention it would be treating generous and liberal public with !great injustice and ingratitude. The support has been beyond my expecta- tions; but at most it necessarily must be in considerable in a town of the age and limited population of Tuscaloosa.

 l believe all will admit that a Book and Sta tionary establishment is an important acqui- sitlon to cur town, and permanent benefit to the country-and such will permit me again to remark, that it's present success, until cur public institutions are further advanced, re- quires all the support that the liberal and well wishing can bestow.

To this condescending in- terrogaticn, Taylor replied, s'Had not your highness better shut it?"" Upon which, his highness, with that energy and decision which characterize his minutest actions, immediate ly shut his mouth, and no more rain found ad- mittance during the remainder of the walk. :""
