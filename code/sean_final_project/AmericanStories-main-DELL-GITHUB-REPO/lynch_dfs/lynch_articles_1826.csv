cd in Upper Peru--it was hoped that rup-
ture bet wecn the two Governments might
have been averted, and their differences am
icably adjusted, by the late mission to Rio
de Janeiro in the person of Mr.. Yrigoyen,
who was sent to negotiate with the Empe-
ror on the question Of the Banda Oriental,
firmly insisting on the claims to that Prov
ince BY this Government, and to accept, on
it's part fproposed--the mediation of Sir
Charles Stewart, the British Ambassador to
the Court of Lisbon and Rio de Janero,
who has recently arrived at the latter place.
--Unfortunately it failed. Mr.. Yrigoyen
left this for Monte Video, on his way to Rio;
and, after making three unsuccessful at
tempts to put to sea from that place, driven
back each time by stress of weather, re-
tarned to this city and declined altogether
the mission. That any events should have
arisen to occasion the least delay was to be
regretted 1t was then undertaken by Mr.


Lynch, Cd Captain Of the Port, who chart
cred brig for his conveyance, and was on


the point of embarking to proceed direct to


Rio with his charge. At this interesting


juncture, on 2lst ultimo, Mr.. Rivadavia ar


rived from Europe. The departure OF Mr.


Lynch was deferred from day to day and


the mission at length was totally abandoned


1t was on the c5th that Congress, after the


most tedious and prolonged deliberations, in
secret session, declared the Oriental Prov


ince re-incorporated with the Republic OF
La Plata, and its Deputy admitted, and


changed the Executive Power with its de-
fence and security. These are proceedings
which are looked upon as tantamount to a
declaration of war with Imperial Brazil.
