 A meeting of the Shockoe Hill Democratic Association of the city of Richmond, held on ""Wednesday evening, the Sd instant, Major Charles II. Hyde in the chair, the following resolutions, offered by Thos Ritchie, were adopted and ordered to be published:

 ReSofrcd, as he sense Of his meeting, That the remuneration of Texas 10 the Uui- ted ates is a measure required by the best interests of the Union.

 Resoleed That such measure, at this time, is consistent with the soundest princi- peseof international law, and is not yiolative of the faith of the United States 10 Mexico.

 ReSofred, That the efforts of Great Britain to acquire political feolhold, and a com merria control over 1FeSas, and her indirect interference with the municipal institutions of Texas, i'll relation to slavery, furnish strong and additional inducements to the United States to obtain the re-possesson of terri tory which once constituted part of our Union, which was most unwisely and un- warrantably transferred to spain (not Mexico) by the Florida treaty af lS19 and which ac- cording to the then avowed doctrines of Henry Clay, could not be ceded away by treaty to any foreign power.

 ReSolUed That we protest against the pro- ceedings of the anti-annexatlon meeting which took place in the city of New ' ork, on the 2Ith Of April-that we deeply regret some of the sentiments which were expressed on that occasion by it's president, Albert Galatin, esq. and that we solmnIy protest against the 10th resolution, which would cut off the Southern people from an equal participation of the be- neiits of any annexatlcn. That resolu- ton is calculated to place the Southern and Southwestern States under the ban ofthe re- pubic-by peremtorily requiring in any event @proper guards (to be erected) against slayerv,n and by unqualifedy forbidding the admission of any slaveholdihg State that may be established within the Territory ol Texas, and the more especially, as that Immense re oion which extends from Missouri to Oregon. is north of about the Beth degree of latitude marked out by the Missouri compromise act of Henry Clay, and destined to the special uses and behests of the non-slaveholding States, who may carve out not only sfour States.n but ns many others as their own in- terests or their love of power may prompt them to establish within that extensive terri tory; thus overhrowng the whole balance of the constitution, and subjectmg the South ern States to the tender mercies of the abol- llonists of the North

 l Ieesolped, That the remuneration of Texas will not extend the mass of slavery, nor null 1 tply the number Of slaves, inasmutch as the | laws of the United States would be more efli- cient in limiting the slave trade dnd prohibit ing the introduction of slaves from the coast of Africa, than those of Texas could possibly be.

 Resolced, Flat some of the positions in MT. Clay's letter of the l7th April are calcu- lated to countenance the same idea which IS incalculated in the resolution of the maeting of New York--to abridge the capacity of Texas for being in any respect d siavchoid- inc region-to counteract the spirit O. the compromise of the Constitution. And we not only protest against any such partial doctrine, but will resist it's establishment and l that 1t fills us with astouishmeut that any sanction to such doctrine should have been afforded dy a man who IS candidate for the Presidency, and himself resident of Ken lucky and slaveholder

 Resolced, That the Democratic Central Committee be requested forthwith to issue an Address 10 the Democratic party of Virginia. urging the serious and prompt expression of their opinion on the subject of a re annexation of Texas to the Union-the propriety of re- lieving their delegates to the Baltimore Con- vention from the instructions which now bind them, leaving them to the exercise of sound 1 discretion, or even to instruct them, If they deem it expedient to do so, to cast the vote of Virginia in favor of men known and pledged to be in favor of annexation, and Of other action which they deem proper and efficient, in uniting the Democracy of the State m the great and vital object of defeating the election of Henry Clay.

 CHARLES II. HYDE, President.

MURDER AND Lynch Law IN MIssIssIrpl.-
The Natchez Courier of the 18th inst. contains
the particulars OF an atrociOus murder in Jeiicr-
son county, Miss. with the summary execution
Of two of the murdcrers. 1t seems that Il MIR.
VIM Boyd, planter living near Torry's store,
was about to correct one of his negroes for some
offence, when the fellow turned upon his mas.
ter and was about TO overpower him. The
latter called upon two negro women, who were
at work IN the same field, for assistance but IN
stead of helping they fell upon him with their
hoes and soon put him to death. The three ne
groes sccrcted the body of Alr. b., in a brush
heap bat in two days time 1t beginning 10
smell they removed it to log pile, sci every
thing on fire, and burnt the body TO ashes
The negroes, suspecting that the absence Of
their master would soon be known, assumed
boldness enough to tell some of the neighbors
that Mr.. b., had been absent for some days
that his horse had come up saddled, bridled
&c. and that they suspected foul play. a
search was Immediately instituted by the neigh
bors, and after some time they came upon the
spot in the field where the combat had takel
place between MIR. Boyd and the negroes. One
thing led to another until the negroes were al
arrested, when they acknowledged their crime
as stated above. The excitement among tn,
people assembled was very great. About ONT
hundred persons were collected on Friday last
3lst ut. one week from the DAY of the murder
They appointed jury OF eighteen men to decide
what should be Zone with the negroes. -Four
teen of the jury were for hanging the negroes
and four against II. Two OF the negroes, thc
man and one of the women, were hung in
stantly. The other woman, being pregnan,
was spared."

The morning session was occupied in the Discus
sion by various gentlemen OF the Preamble, which
was adopted, when at / o'clock, the Convention ad-
iourncd TO meet again at :, p. NJ, at which hour it
re-assembIed and the Resolutions were taken up
and considered.


These called up various speakers and the discuss

convictions, and conducted in the utmost harmony
and good feeling


The resolutions were finally adopted, and the
Convention adjourned TO meet again tins morning at
10 o'clock ut the same piece. The proceedings TO-
dav will no doubt be highly interesting, and this
evening an Address TO the People OF the United
States will be read and discussed. Ihe evening
session will commence at half past o'clock, and
ladies and gentlemen are invited to attend.


IL Mr.. GRAHAMs Second Lecture, delivered
last evening at the Society Library, was devoted
almost exclusively to a criticism of the prevailing
methods of treating Disease. The main propo-
stion which he labored 10 establish was that laid
down and so strenuously insisted upon IN his first
Lecture, viz: that the Theory and Practice Of
Medicine are not at present based upon Sclcntlhc
principles, but rest upon conjecture ana emPyr-
cism Some of the theories Of different men.
eminent in the medical profession, were reviewed
and shown to be preposterous. The Lecturer
was as usual earnest in manner and convincing IN
argument; but we cannot withhold the express
sion of our regret that he should deem 1t neccs-
sary TO devote two of his five Lectures to matters
of a preliminary nature. If it were ever so I'M
portant to show up the empyrlclsm OF the medi-
cal profession, the time given to that topic IN the
first Lecture might IS well have sutiiced; and
since we have venturcd upon the work OF crltl
cism, We will not withhold the expression of our
deep conviction that Mr.. G.. might greatly I'm
prove his method as Lecturer, by avoiding the
too frequent repetition of ideas and principles
which, if not as familiar to his audience as to
himself. are at least clearly understood when
once fairly presented before them. Our judy
ment NAV be at fault in these matters, but 1t IS
given in the most friendly spirit, and will pass Tor
what it is worth.

hold Convention in Baltimore on Saturday next.
The original intention OF the Convention, as we
are given to understand by the public notice, was
10 nominate their late leader, Joe Smith, as n


candidate Tor the Presidency, but his death will
render 1t necessary to make other arrangements
The ST. Louis Era Of the lst inst. has the fol-
lowing


The murder of Joe Smith when in Jail, after he
had peaceabiy surrendered himself, and alter the
solemn promise OF the Governor that he should be


protected and have tar trial, seems to meet with


very general condemnation. N 1t is another tdgrant


instance OF the triumph OF a mob spirit in the coun-


try. To murder prisoners in cold blood when they
are In custody and when there is nothing to pre-


vent their being punished to the full extent OF
their crimes according to law, Is utterly inexcu.
sable. But when mob raised and
excited il knows no bounds, no moderation, but
reason and law are both disregarded. We have
often expressed the belief that mobs and Lynch
law are improper under all circumstances, and
should not be justified, excused or tolerated under
any circumstances, and every outbreak confirms
the correctness of this opinion. Joe Smith was,


was under arrest, with public sentiment strongly


setting against him, thereswas the most ample oppor,
| tunity to convict and punish him Legally ana
severely.


And in the st. Louis Democrat we nno the I0l-
lowing =


From all the facts now before us,we regard these


homicides as nothing less than murder IN cold
bood-murder against the pghted faith OF the


chief magistrate Of Ilinois-mnrder Of charac-


ter so a,roclous and so unjustfiable, as to leave


the blacklist stain all Its perpetrators-their
aiders, abettors, and defenders


Here was Joe Smith in the custody of the laws


TO which he had surrendered himself, in the conf-
dence that those laws would not be broken TO his
injury He had the promise Of preservation and
protection against the very mob violence to which
he has fallen victim Ought not such faith 10


have been kept? Need we ask, indeed, whether,


if there hal been special promise, the law


does not always hold out implied safety to its pr-


soners from all punishments, save what itself impo-


ses. Indeed the sight of such solemn pledges, SO
| shamefuly broken, is truly slckening.. Why, an


Arab if you accept his hospitality, and eat Of his


salt-an American Indian. if you once pass his
| threshold in peace, will give up his existence


before he will suffer his pledges to be broken. il


such acts are to be taken as a true expression of


the spirit which pervades the public mind ol our
communities, it needs seer TO tell US that our
course as a people is downward. 1t is spirit,


which seeks its qualification only in the indulgence


of the most Ignorant prejudces and the vlest pas
sons Nothing can stand against II, except the


bayonets OF despot and It's the very spirit which,


after series Of anarches naturally produces dss-
| pots and their bayonets.


We think Smith despicable mposter and
| that the dupes Of deceit gross his is must
necessarily be most ignorant and debased. Hence
| we have always thought that the laws OF the land
were strong enough TO control both him and them."

TERRIBLE NEWS!


Slaughter Of Joe Smith, Hgram Smith
and OHcrS--Tho steamer st. CroX,
which arrived early yesterday morning,
enabled US, by means Of an Extra, to con
yey TO our citizens the first news of the
violent death ofSmjth, the Mormon Proph-
ct, and some Of his fellow prisoners.
Promising that, upto the last moment Of
gong to press, the accounts continued to
be contradictory aud unsatisfactory, we
proceed to give our readers all we yet
know upon the subject, reserving com
menl for our next, when the real facts
will be known. Our Extra Of yesterday
morning, containing the story as told by
the Quincy Wing, and which we forward,
ed to our exchanges, we will say, though,
does no sort Of justice in the case. Joe
Smith has been /"" Lynched,"" while under
the protection Of Gov Ford and the iacS :
According to the Quincy account


""The Carthage Greys,' a volunteer
company, were placed as guard around
the Carthage Jail. About 6 o'clock last
evening (tho 27th) an attempt was made
by the Mormons on the outside to rescue
the Mormon prisoners from the custody of
the guard. A youth about niaeteen years
of age ""a Mormon) began the fray, by
shooting the sentinel at the door, and
wounding him severely y in the shoulder.
! simultaneously, with this attempt, the
Mormons on the inside Of the jail, inclu.
ding the Smiths, presented pistols through
the windows and doors Of the Jail, and
fired upon the guard without, wounding
morally, it is supposed, four Of the old
citizens Of Hancock! 1t is unnecessary
to say that this blood-lhirsty attempt on
the part of the Mormons was the signal
for certain and sure vengeance. The
lives of the two Smiths and Richards were
quickly taken, and we believe no othGrs.n


The Warsaw correspondent Of the Re-
publican, in this city, sends the follow ing
extract from his letter:


""This afternoon, (the 27th) between
the hours OF 5 and 6 o'clock, an armed
multitude visited the Jail at Carthage.
bore off the guard, and killed Joseph and
Hrum Smith, Report says that two Of
Joe's associates in confinement were like
wise destroyed. The Governor had left
Carthage in the morning for Nauyoo with
80 dragons, for the purpose Of securing
the balance Of the State arms remaining
at Nauvoo, and during his absence this
scene occurred.n


The following letter, telling its story
reached US about three hours alter the re-
ceiPt of the Quincy Extra:


Joe Smith and his brother Hpum Killed! |


STEAMER DOVE, June 28, 1914.


Editors Rereitie-Passengers from Bry-
ants Landing report the deaths of Joe
Smith and his brother Ilyrum, last eve
ming, by mob Of 200 men, dressed in
disguise, with their faces backened, who |
took them from the Jail in Carthage, |
where the had been confined, and shot
them.


1t is feared that the exasperated follow
ers OF the ""Prophet"" will make an attack
upon the town Of Carthage, and make a
general massacre of the citizens, unless
a sufficient force can be raised to defend
the place.


The excitement is great and the whole
country is rising, while at the same time
the Mormons will muster their entire
strength.

above has been corroborated by messen-

 These rabid charges of 'sdsunion'' come With bad grace from a set of men who would hug to their bosoms, and place at the highest seats of honor, at their public fcsti- vals, the vile fanatic aboltionist, John Quincy Adams, who, with twelve other members of Congress, on the ,3d March, 1913. i'll an ad- dress ssto the free States of the Union,n de- clared that ''the annexation of Texas would be identical with dissolution l. would be all attempt to eternize an institution, and q power of nature so unjust in themselves, so injurious to the interests, and abhorrent to the feelings of the people of the free States, as Tn our ltheir) opinion, not only inevitably to result III DISSOLUTION OF THE UNION, BUT FULLY TO JUSTIFY IT; and we (they) not only assert, that the people of the free States ought mol to submit to 1t, but we (they) ) say, with confidence, they oooaa not SUBMIT TO FTP Why do we not hear these zealous s.iriends of the Union,7 in the Clay club, de- nounee, in their fiercest tones, the fanatics of the North, who first threatened ssdIsunionn if Texas be annexed : Oh. no s'Fhe case is altered Adams, and his mad crew, are warm friends of Henry Clay's election, and though he was the first to raise the flag of disunion, we cannot afford to lose his useful services.

The following translation from the French WI
show the great moral adv ,!ages derived l;om a
cultivation ofsinging:


""In the South. West c. s.witzer,as.6. musical
revolution is lsridly taxing eits'. It's watch

in singing the songs OF :he'r pourr1f ,nd the
praises of their God.


Long was it thought that Frensh Switzer-
land could not march with the Geraan cantons
in vocal music. Long has the Lake of Geneva
heard little along its shores but coarse, vulgar
and obscene ballads. Lately the students Of
Geneva and Lausanne have iabored to counter.
act this evil, by composing patriotic songs, and
endeavoring to give them popular circulatlon.-
The effect has been happily successful, but
within small circle. The religious awakening,
which is making daily progress in Switzerland,
has had great effect in improving the national
singing. New methods have been adopted IN
many schools to train the children to the execu-
ton of hymns with fine and simple harmony,
and the effects have been go far pleasing-but
something was wanted to reach the mass OF the
peOplC, anu LLdl ldS pcSh ouPPASa'


""a few years ago NJ. Kaupert, Saxon gen.
tleman, who has long resided at Morges, proposed
to teach gratuitously the whole population OF
Young and willing parsons in any village or small
town to sing together. The rumor attracted
considerable after ion, and drew forth a variety
of opinions. Blu. soon his promises were real
lied. and all skepticsm was silenced.N AT
Morges and in the neighboring villages, concerts
of the voice alone were heard, producing such a
noble effect as no person in the whole country
had before the least idea of. He was induced to
extend his benevolent labors He electrified as
i, were the whele side OF the Lake of Geneva
Everywhere the magician of song was followed
by crowds. The moral effect of this is beyond
calculation already the result exeites astonish
ment.


IN. Kaupert commonly began in schools ano
other large rooms; parsons of all ages and o
every rank in society focked to these meetings.
1t was soon necessary to ask for Inc use OF chur
ches; and sometimes large assemblies have been
held in the open air. In The former places hymns
are sung-and in the lauer songs, patrlouc and
descriptive, bu. all free from any Immoral tainr.


""These large assemblsges followed his instruc.
tion ana caught his method of execution with an
enthusissm perfectly astonishing. NJ. Kaupert's
kind manner and untlrlng patience had great
share in producing the effects which SO surprised
them.


1.-The city of Geneva invited the musical phi
lanthropisr 10 visit and charm its population -
Some oil the higher classes became alarmed, but
in the result, they are too willingly carried down
the stream. Pastors, professors, magistrates,
ladies of the FIRST rank, peis ms The most disun-
gulshed for learning and science, were seen side
by side with children and poor people, listening
aud learning. When the grand melting took
place, no church could receive the multitude, and
they repaired to ths Place du Palais, in number
1000 sing ers-the effect was sublime. Nj. K,u.
pert was loaded with expressions of admiration
aud III ,nks and medal was struck in honor OF
him, mark of respect which in Switzerland ie
never conferred but upon those who possess the
highest order of merit.


""At Lausanne his instructions were sought
with universal avidity. Many who had been ac-
customed to spend their evenings in dissipation,
began to employ them entirely in learning the
new method. Children and their parents, all the
schools, the professors and students of the col
lege, servants and mistresses, workmen and mas.
ters, persons who had been the most opposed TO
each other in religion and politics-the inhabit-
ants of different villages distinguished by ban-
ners-all were attracted, all seemed of one heart
and soul. When the previous training was CON-
plete, day was fixed for the grand concert.
More than 1900 singers were arranged in the
great church, the noblest Gothic building in
Switzerland: the flags of villages and societies
wera tastefulIy disposed on an ivy-clad tower
the vast multitude who came to hear were crowd
ed within and without; and then was sung a
hymn, to an air of Luther's composing, simple,
grave, noble, but oh the effsct!-no words can
utter it; the impression will never be forgotten
Other hymns were sung, and most touching
patriotic song, the words of which we owe to NJ

0- Under the head Of ""Lynching in
PanoIa,"" the Memphis Enquirer of the
11th inst doubtless through mlsinfor-
nation, makes a misstatement OF facts.
We allude 10 the case Of ""Ferguson,'
lately arrested for kidnapping the two
little girls, and stealing negro from a
gentleman in Holmes county. The fol-
lowing paragraph embodies the mis-
statement alluded TO:


""After the two liends were taken they
were handcufed and brought back to
Pamela. The citizens hearing the cir
cumstances, and fearing that they might
in some way escape the punishment due
their crimes, organized themselves into
an extra judicial tribunal, and appointed
a jury of twelve men, who sentenced
them TO be severely cowhided, the SEN
tence 10 be executed the one upon the
Other. This was accordingly done, the
negro receiving thirty-fve and the
white man twenty-five lashes we'll LAID
on with 4 cowhide. The sentence was
for each to receive fifty Iashes, butthey
were so gashed with the number above
stated that the popular mercy RENTED
the balance They were then handed
over to their guard, to be taken back to
Holmes. Our informant heard in Pa
nola that the white man had been whip
ped to death by the citizens ofthat coun-
ty, but is not certain that his informa-
ton is correct.


The informant of the Enquirer can
not be certain that any of his ''iniorma-
tion is correct"" :"" The true statement,
as we derive it from those who were
present, is this. Ferguson and the ne
gro were brought to this place without
handouts. Previous to their arrival,
they had cvinced refractory disposi-
tion, on account Of which they were
handcuffed together when they arrived
here. During the process Of handcuff-
ing Ferguson manifested refractory
disposition, and among other things
made threat, saying gentlemen | will
see you some other time"" &c, This
produced an irritable state of feeling
among the gentlemen who had captured
and had him in charge, and, III order to
a safe and convenient conveyance of
the prisoner to Holmes county, they
thought it advisable that his and the ne
gro's refractory spirit should be first
subdued by fiagellation According
ly they submitted to the citizens TO say,
not whether the prisoners should be
whipped, for that they had already re-
solved on; but hoac much and how they
should be whipped. Such citizens as
happened to be present (calI it jury or
what you willy decided that the prison
ers should whip each other, fifty lashes
each; provided the effect Of such whip
ping should not be in any manner TO
disable them from travelling. This
sentence was only in part executed, the
negro whipping so hard that it was
thought prudent to stop him. The
enormity of the crime perpetrated joint





ly by the white man aud negro was
such doubtless as to produce strong
feeling, but il did not manifest tselr ON
the part of the citizens Of this place in
the irrational excitement whic h usually
attends lynching operations. If it be
regarded as q case of lynching, the
gentlemen who guarded the prisoners,"

who makes this wanton insnuation against an
upright and honorable man, has himself been

balance OF the company was, but they did not
up. lsuggested that they had gone on to town, and
urged them to follow on with me. So on we went,
but on arriving at Peck's store, we were sur
rounded by about fifteen men, whom Richardson's
friends had aroused, and who were armed with
guns and bayonets. They soon took off the lad
from behind Inc, and Richardson pointed to me
and said to one Of the gang, ""Unce John, this is
would shoot, if did not drop my shovel"" With
this the old fellow, who very stout, seized the
birdie OF my horse, and ordered me 10 turn around
and 60 back to Carpenters Tavern, saying that
Lynch Law was good enough for me, and that I
should have until sunrise to say my prayers. This
made me feel rather curious, but determined on
bold push to extricate myself drew my pistol, and
pointing it directly at the old fellows head said

your skull"" THIS contounded him so cmpetely,
that he loosed his hold and jumped back. With
this, gave loud yell, struck my horse with the
pistol, and bounded through the men, who stood
with fixed bayonets Immediately IN front of me-
My horse received three bayonet wounds, but es-

Stout, in the meantime, escaped in the confusion,

and rowed for our lives over to Nauvoo. On ar
irving there, we found Joe partially dressed,
wrapped in his mantle. He had heard the report Of
guns on the other side, and had got up at this early
hour, which was for him very unusual to see what
had happened. On landing, we told him our
story. damned the men pack OF towards,
for having left myself, Stout and Karnes On
learning that Karnes was still in Montrose, the
Prophet raised an alarm, called out the Legion, and
gave orders to pass over the river and release
by the Missourians. The whole city was thus
thrown into confusion, and hundreds rushed to the
river, and crossed over in all manner of crafts
While this was going on, Karnes was discovered
All hands went to meet him, and az he landed they
cried out. "" Hallelu)ah Glory to God well done
Brother Karnes!'' &c. Karnes was utterly con-
founded at these demonstrations; but kept still

Joe manage this affair, that to this dav the people
OF Nauvoo generally believe that Karnes was in
reality kidnapped by the MIssourians; and of
course, the story told by the people of Monlrose,
was set down by Joes honest dupes to the credit
Of persecution. Thus ended this nefarious plot,
which, had far succeeded to have got Richardson
to Nauvoo the order of Joe to tie bar his
shoulders and throw him into the Mississippi for cat fish

They all received an. equal share of kindness, and portion of them are now enjoying hls phl- lanthropy.

 We will repeat, that we shall ever remem- Der, with gratitude, the kindness extended by Mir. Richardson. It was all done in an un- pretending and still manner, We all felt as if we wem in the house of an old friend and acquaintance.

 The undersigned are aware that our opin- ion will not add to the high reputation now enjoyed by MT. Richardson, as manager of large estate. At the same time, we were so struck with the order, content, neatness, and comfort exhibited by the slaves on the estate, that we cannot withhold the expres- sion that it exhibits in a clear light, the bene- fit to all concerned of the advantages of good management.

 We will also express our acknowledgements to Judge Roane, whose mansion is some dis tance from the scene. He, too, hastened to the spot, and offered all the assistance in his power, and had portion of the passengers removed to his house.

 It is also due to many persons in the neigh borhood, to say that they offered all the as- sistance in their power to the unfortunate sufferers on board the boat.

",,"Navy DEPARTMENT, Nov. 25, 1874.


SiR;-i have the honor TO present 10 you the an
nual report OF the condition and operations oi this
Department vi the public service.


The Navy OF the United States consists Of six
ships o The lne one razee, fourteen frgates, twen-
ty-oGe sloops of war, sixteen bries and schooneIs
three store-shlps, and eight steamers afoat.


There are on the stocks in an unfinished state,
four ships OF the llne three rgates one soreshlp,
an iron steamer at Pittsburgh, and one at the Navy
Yard al Washington to be used as a water tank
Since the last Annual Report. after careful survey
and inspection, it was fornd most conducive 10 the
public interests TO sell the fTgate Hudson, and the
store-shps Consort and .ChiPola, and orders have
been recently givenfor the sale OF the Pioneer. In
each case the Navy Agent conducting the sale was
limited as TO price, and the sales are satisfactory
The Hudson was originally built by contract for q
foreign government, was found to be unworthy OF
repair, and il was believed TO be more advantage
Gus to sell than 10 break her up.


The vessels In commission have been employed
as follows-


In the Home Squadron, the frigate Potomac, the
sloops Vincennss, Vandalia and Falmouth, the
hbrigs Somers and Lawrence, and the steamer
Union, under the command Of Gem. Conner. In
ne month of August the Vncennes returned north
rom the Cult OF Mexico, was put IN ordinary, and
her crew discharged


In the Mediterranean sea the squadron wasunder
command Of Commodore Morris, until he left that
station in the Delaware ""a in February, when the
command dev0lved on Com Jos. Spith. Our Ma
val forces In that sea consist OF the frigates Cum
6eiland aud Columbia, sloors Plymouth and Fair
held, and store ship Lexington. The new sloop ST.
Mary's IS under orders, and will proceed, as soon
as she is ready Tor sea, to relieve the Fairfield.


On the coast OF Brazil, the squadron has consist
ed OF the Columbus ""A, frigates Raritan and Con-
sress, sloops John Adams and Boston, brig Balm
bridge, and schooner Enterprize.


Ihe Columbus, john Adams and Enterprlze
nave returned home, been put Ia ordinary, and
their crews dlschaiged. The squadron Is under the
command oi Com. Daniel Turner.


In the Pacific Ocean there have been employed
me inga,es United States and Savannah, soops
Cyane, Leyant and Warren, schooner Shark, and
store ship Relief. The United States and Cyane
have returned home, been put in ordinary. and
their crews discharged. The new sloop Ports
mouth has been fied tor sea, and is under orders
relieved from the command by Com. Alexander ].
Dallas, by whose lamented death in the month OF
June last, the command devolved on Capt James
Armstrong. the second IN command: CON- John
D. Sloat has been ordered 10 the Pacihc 10 assume
command on that station.


No change has been made in the vessels COM
posing the East India Squadron since the last an
nual report The fIigale Brandywine arrived at
Macao, with the Hon. Caleb Cushing on board, in
February last. The siCop 81. Louis and the brig
Perry have since arrived at the same port. Both
passage by The illness of Comr. Cooke, OF the ST.
Louis, and OF Comr. Dupont, Of the Perry. To
the modification Of both these officers, and TO the
regret of the Department, each was compelled, by
the state OF his health, TO renquish his command
and return to the United States Captain Mckeever
and Comr. John Stone Paine Were sent out TO sup
ply their places. The squadron is commanded by
Commodore Foxhall A. Parker. The frigate Con
stellaton, bearing the pendant of Commodore
Kearney, returned home in April last, after crute
Of nearly four years. She has been laid up and
her crew discharged.


The squadron on the coast Of Africa, under CON-
mand OF Com M. 9. Perry, consists OF the rlgatcc
Macedonian, sloops Saratoga and Decatur, and
brig P0rpoise, mounting nlnety-three guns. The
sloops Preble and Yorktown, and brig TruxtoR,
have been sent out 10 relieve the Saratoga, Deca-
tur and Porpoise The new sloop Jamestown has
been launched and is in active preparations TO 90
70 sea to relieve the Macedonian. Com. Charles
w. Skinner has been ordered to proceed in her to
the station and relieve Com. Perry Another sloop
will be ordered to the station with all practicable
Dispatch The squadron, as thus constituted, VIII
mount eighly-Ihree guns. 1t is found that single
decked vessels best suited 10 this service, and
thatn them the health Of the ofhcersand crew will
be more secure than IN those OF larger class ana
more difficult of ventilation. Ii affords me pleasure
20 state that the apprehensions which were enter


tanned for the health OF the squadron have not been
realized. While al sea il is found that their health
| is only felt BY those on shore The operations Of
the squadron have. 1t Is believed, exercised ia
yorabie influence In preventing the slave trade
With the provision OF our law denounclng II as pl
| racy, and the presence Of our own naval forces,
with authority to visit ali vessels under the Amerl
can flag, Is not probable that our citizens will en-
rage In this disgraceu and perious traffic, or our
| flag be used by others TO any great extent.
Ii other Christian nations would nfict the same
punishment on the offenders, 1t is not improbable
that the trade would cease.


The store ship Erie is about to sail from New
York with stores for this squadron. The unhealthi
oess OF a residence on shore, the influence OF the
climate In deterlorating provisions when In sore
desirable 10 have large and well found store ship
permanently attached to the station. .
| No alteration has been made in the cruising
grounds Of the several squadrons since the last an-
aual report.


Tae following vessels have been employed on
special service: The irigaie Constitution, Capt.
| Percval, sailed from New York on the 29lh May


last, q cruise to the Indian Ocean. The Hon


Hesry A Wise took passage in this ship, and was
| landed AT Rio de Janeiro on the 9th August, when
she proceeded on her cruise.


The steamer Princeton, Capt. Stockton, has
| been employed in gun practice and experiments.
She ls under orders TO be prepared Tor cruise Ia
test her qualities, as well under her sails as her
| steam, and to determine the advantages OF her
mode OF propulsion.


The steamer Poinsett, Lieut. Semmes, has been
employed In making surveys between Apalachicoa
bay and the Ballze. The work ls finished, and she


will be laid up for the winter.
Consantlnople in January last, with the remain
OF Com. David Porter, and in June, sailed to join
| The squadron on the coast OF Africa, under cem
mand OF Com. Bruce.


The steamers Col. Harney and Gen. Taylor were
transferred from the War Department for the use
Cf the Navy. The former has been employed il


the transportation OF recruits and supplies tor the


Navy, and Is now under orders TO sail without de.
lay under command OF Lieut.. Lynch, TO prevent
uespasses the live oak and other timber on the
public ands between Cape Sable and the Ballze


with Instructions TO give aid TO merchant vessels II


distress during the coming winter. The Gen
4 Taylor, Lieut. Fauand, has been employed tor llks
purposes during the past season.


The schooner PhGnix, and brig Oregon, have


been succcssvely employed under the command o


Lieut.. Arthur Sinclair, as a packet between thin


country and the lsthmus Of Darlen The mails 10


the squadron and for such Of our citizens as choose


to adopt this mode Of conveyance, ale regularly


forwarded by this route. The schooner Fhrt, 1t


Davis, will be employed on the same duly. II il


believed that great advantage to the service and e
the public will result from this mode OF communi
cation with the Pacific Ocean.


The Pennsylvania, al Norfolk the North Caro-
lima, at New York the Ohio, al Boston; the Ex


pertinent, at Philadelphia; the Ouka-hy.e, a


Charleston; and the Ontario, at Baltimore, arr


employed as receiving vessels.

In my last letter stated that 1922 hdds. Of
tobacco was inspected in Lvnchbu'g in the year
'43, have every reason to believe that not more

present growing crop will fall short of that of
'43 some two thousand hhds. owing 10 the droyth,
that we have had fr the last two months, which

quite different, and | venture the assertion that
IN ten years it will be greater Tariff State than

To see that under the present Tariff the country
has been gradually rising from rs embarrass

dustry begins to make itself heard all over the

Market is building up Ill our midst, and most
articles Of produce meet with a ready sale and

mnistra,iop OF Mr.. Van Buren,; nearly every

the balance Of trade, for a number Of years

nearly T~enty Millions Of specie have been
brought into the country through its benign in

The Wings had glorious meeting last Mon

of the Wings III Kentucky and Tennessee. He
has Travelled through the latter State, and he says
Clay will beat Polk 5000. He left Yesterday
morning and will visit Delaware, Pennsylvania,

We transmit you sketch Of the rich and intel

The day was hot as Egypt, and the Avenue as
dusty, when escaping The pestilence in retreat to
the capto grounds, we encountered in one of the
iron chairs under the fine sycamores of the west.S

to whom Mr.. Bracket, the sculptor, is, Of all 9th

""Delightful grounds, Mr.. Thomas

The people have learned from experience, that with federal whggery ill power, their intersts have been prostrated their rights trampied upon, and their country dishonored. Whether t De matter of hon. or or rcproach, il is at least singular cir cumstancc, that whoever maintains the doc Urine of equal rght-of universal suffrage whoever raises his voice in defence of the Constitution, is immediately set down by the wings as an enemy to his country. Such language would lead us to think that the or der of things was inverted, and that conspira- cy had changed its nature. The democrats are charged with the design,-not of destroy ing, but of preserving the Constitution and country.

 We have not the least doubt that the coons, through iheir presses, will make use of every means to discourage enterprlse-to paralize business and create pancs. Indeed, before the contestis hardly decided, they have com meneed their eroaking giving gloomy pie ture of the prospect ot business and the com mereial affairs of the country. This mean- choly view things, taken by our opponents, IS perfectly natural, and to be expected from those who, through their nfdelity. have been thrust from every post of honor and place of trust. But we are perfectly satisfied that 1t is without foundation, and that in the course ofa few months, the industrial movements of the age, will advance more vigorously than ever.

 The recent elections have settled forever a National Bank-an institution from which the people had every thing to ear-it has settled the Distribution scheme, and various other financial questions of the wings, which have heretofore caused the sudden revulsions, dis asters and bankruptcies from which the coun- try has suffered so severely This leaves HIS untrammeled. Our prospects do not depend upon the successful or unsuccessful working of some new scheme. We are left to make the most of our position and we believe that trade and industry never had better pros poet before them than now.--Our banking institutons-thanks to democratic principles -never stood upon a firmer foundation. Our population and powers of production are increasing-our values are improving, and with the settlement of the great ques- tions which have been agitated in the contest, confidence will be restored, and healthful prosperity be the result Not only the dem ocrats, butthe business men among the whigs, will have every reason to be highly gratllied at the present termination of the contest.

 Our prospects, therefore, we gladly again assert, are good, and we desire all men of business to rely upon it, that during the next five, six, or seven years, they may make for tunes with ease and comfort, if they only know how to avail themselves of the elements around them. The despondency only exists among disappointed otlice-seekers and those who are too ignorant to understand their po- sition, and too lazy to go to work and earn an honest living.-S. .4ibaas Repuelicn.

 GLORIOUS GATHERING OF THE nEMoCRA- oY.-On Tuesday evening last, the democrats of Allegheny county assembled in mass meet. ing to respond to the nominations of tine Balti- more convention. After the season of doubt. uncertainty and occasional despondency through which we have passed, it was most cheerful and refreshing to see the crowds of republicans who were at the place of meet ing, eager to give Ill their adhesion to, and record their hearty confirmation of the de- clslon ol the great council at Baltimore It was no empty, formal, matter-of-conrse piece of business they wished to perform--it was not mere party machinery which brought them together; but every man seemed ani- mated with a generous, glowing zeal, and n- trepld but cool, temperate, but mdomitablal determination to sustain the glorious princiz pies of democracy. The old pillars of the party, the men who for forty years have sus- talned with unflnching energy it's nomiHa- lions and its measures, and those who have but recently cut loose from the debasing in- l fluenee of federalism, were alike ferYent and enthusiastic.

 We shall not go into any details of the proeeedlngs-they are given at length in an other column-but merely note that Mir. Skunk presided, assisted by the usual num- Der of vice-presidents and secretaries, and that the meeting was addressed by various speakers whose remarks, like every thing else about the whole affair, were all emphat- ically-good!

 The whigs of this city stand perfectly aghast at this PiHs6ug Morning Post.

 A better selection of candidates could noi have been made. Not | democrat will be found who will not pronounce it u judicious choice, and respond heartily to the nomina- tion We shall, before we issue another paper, know whether or not they accept Il they do, up will go to our masthead the names of James K. Polk, Of Tennessee, for President, and George NJ. Dallas, of Penn. sylvania, for Vice President. Fighting, then under the banner of Polk and Dallas, no forgetting the great principles of the demo- cracy, we shall achieve glorious victory over the coons, and add the .Texian star to the star-spangled banner

 "". c. Repu5licaa.

 The opinions of the press are pouring il upon Us, and we are happy to inform ou democratic friends i'll this region, that tht nomination of Polk and Dallas is received with great cordiaity, by the friends of Gal. houn, Cass, Van Buren, Johnson, Buchanan Sc. The work goes bravely on. On the glorious result of the Baltimore convention we congratulate all our friends. Let the battle cry be Polk, Dallas, and democracy.

 Lynch1urg Republican.

 The crisis is past-the country is saved The democratic party, which, when firmly ant zealously united, never has been, and neve can be, defeated-is, indeed, united ono, more to man. The nomination of thii convention has already acted like charm Such union exists already in the party. a has not existed since 1t was led by that glo rous old hero, Andrew Jackson. The de mocralic party presents one solid unbrokel front, and victory is certain.

property put up for sale bv the collector and who
did, in fact, assault and beat young man. whose
only offence was, that he bid for the property so

that the resistance was only begun and they
spoke the truth. collector had advertised 10 sell
the property Of Shadrach Street, Ga man who
lives in MarshaIrs District, which, for the honor
IS disgraced by these ruAians,) for state taxes :
The collector thought it best sell the property in
BelAir. On Saturday last, (the day Of sale, ) the
mob collected, using threats OF violence against
any one who would bid for the properly. They
were about one hundred strong. The propert,
