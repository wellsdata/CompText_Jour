 Origin of Lynch's La,u.-As ""Lynchs law"" has recently become almost as general as it is proverbial, and as the question Is ask de hundred times day, ""What is Lynch's law"" 1t may be we'll to relate the following anecdote, which may serve as an answer:

 In Washington county, Pa., many years ago there lived poachng vagabond, who, 1t was believed maintained himself and family by pilfering from the farmers around him. Though universally suspected, yet he man aged SC adroitly as always to avoid detec- ton. At length Mfr. Yan Swearingen laid the following trap for him in which he was caught. Having a newborn calf, he concealed it from his neighbors for several days--he then rode over to the poacher's, and told him that a young calf had recently strayed to his farm, which he had penned, and was anxious to find the owner. The poacher asked him how long he had had it, its size and color, and being told said 1t was his, and that it had gone off just at the time spoken of Being thus detected in a lie with design to defraud, Van Swearin- gen reproached him with it, and told him he would give him twentv-four hours to leave the neighborhood, adding that if he remained longer he would prosecute him. The poacher only laughed at his threats while the latter went to consult with his neghbors as to what was to be done. At the expiration of the twenty-fonr hours, five or six of them repaired to the poacher's, whom they found perfectly uninumidated. The party, however proceeded to try him in due form, choosing one of their number a farmer named Lynch, to be judge. Van Swearengen related the offence, which the poacher of course denied. The case was submitted to the judge, who decided that the poacher should be tied up and receive three hundred lashes, ''well laid on,'' and then be given tweniy-four hours to leave the place, under penalty of receiving three hundred more if found after that time. The first part of the sentence was inflicted on the spot, with such good intent, as to render it's repetition unnecessary. The eulprit made off as fast as his lacerated limbs would permit him."

 Lynch LGw.--A little ragged rascal or fellow, about ten years old. went yesterday, into shop in Hester street, when the owner owner was Ont after pail of water, and stoie small, box containing pennies, with which he nov. ed off. The owner seeing him g"" out, md missing his box, gave chase alter the poy' who, throwing the empty bOx over fence. fled with the utmost celerily, but was Oyer-l hauled, and twenty-one ppDnies found in his pocket, and he taken io the police office, cry

 ing as loud as he could bawl. The oWner not wishing to imprson.him. wished to have

 him frightened into honesty; and one 0f the. officers, in shis mischievous way, getting a raw hide. asked the boy if he would rather go to jail or he fogged. He decided at once in favor of the fugging. and he was asked how many ldshes he would have, and: whether he would stand forty. As.the upiiit- ed whip was brandished over his head, he said he wOuld not stand SO many, and finally set tied down to six, which he was willing tO re- ceive, well laid on, and screwed up his cour- age to receive them, crying and trembling all theFtime. After sufficiently frightening the little rascal, he was permitted to go home on his promise to steal no more under the pen aIty of Imprisonment and the house of re- fuge. He soon scampered off as fast as. he could, happy to escape the terrific fagela- ton of the raw hide, and the fancied horrors of Lynch's Iaw.-N. Y. pager.

 Singular Death of q Horse. On Wednes-. day last, an indyiduai having occasfunsto syis- it neighbor, on alighting made his horse fast to the fence in the neighhorhood of bee hive. A few moments after, Mle attention of the person was attracted by tho uneasiness of his horse, who was discovered to be totally covered.with bees. he made an attempt to Ilberate the poor animal, but met with such a warm reception from the bees that he was obliged to desist after having been most se- eerely stung.s Another individual then pros cured blanket. in which enyeloping himself he succeeded in liberating the, horse. which by this. time was so stang as to be scarcely able to move. and died within few rods of the spot, within two bOnrs.

 ces and daring oafages have long poison. cd the springs oE morality, and interrupted the relations of society. For years past, Professional Gamblers, destitute ofall sense ofmoral obligations -unconnected with SO ciety by any Of is ordinary ties, and intent. oBly on the qualification of their avariee. have made Yieksbnrg their place Of rendes- vous -and in the very bosom of our socie-. ty, boldly plotted their vile and lawless machinations. Here, as every where else. the laws of the country were found wholly intellectual for the punishment of these in- diylduais. and emboldened by inpunity, their numbers and their crimes, have daily continued to multiply. Every species of transpression followed in tlseir train. They supported a large number ofHppling houses to which they would decoy tho youthful and unsuspecting, and after stripping them of their possessions, send them forth into the world the ready and desperate Instruments of vice. Our streets were ever resounding mith the echoes of their drunken and ob- scene mirth, and no citizen was secure from thelr villany. Frequently, in armed bodies, they have disturbed the good order of public assemblages, in5nlted our citizens. and defied our civil authorities. Thus had they continued to grow boder in their wick edness, and more formidable in their num- Der, until the saturday, 4lh of July, Gnst.1 when our citizens had assembled toge- ,her with the corps of Nicksburg Folun- teers, at barbecue, 10 celebrate the day by the usual festivities. After dinner. and dn- ring the delivery of the toasts, one of the officers attempted to enforce order and si- lence at the table, when one of these gam- biers whose name Is Cahler, who had mpu- dently thrust himself into the company, in suited the officer and struck one of the citi- 1 zens. Indignation immediately rose high, and 1t was only by the interference of the commandant that he was saved frominstan- taneous punishment. He was, however, permitted to retire. and the company disper sed.

Dapad Iypsa presiding, on the trial of J. B. & Wm. Smith for the murder of W. Massey, has decided that the counties of Du Buque and Des bipipes are noi within the jurisdiction of f that court. The consequence of this de- clsion was, that the two Smiths were set at liberty, and number of civil suits on the docket dismissed. The decision was based on the ground that the act of Congress of 1884 attaching the country west of the Mis- sissippi to Michigan Territory did not ex- tend the jurisdiction of the United States circuit court to that territory.

 This decision IS important in this, that 1t establishes the fact that the lives and pro- perty of the citizens of Du Buque and Des Nolnes are without the protection of the law. It is an over sight upon the part of the na- tional council which demands an early and immediate attention, and which no doubt will be corrected upon the assembling of that body. In the mean time 1t will be ne- cessary for those residing there to protect their lives and property by the only law which can operate in such case-that IS Lynch's law. Every we'll wisher of that section of the country will regret this event.

 September l, 1885.

 Within my memory ofpublic settlements -and l have been ten years an editor-I know of nothing to equal the fever of the present moment. It wants little, to fan the spark into flame. The English are phlegmatic until they reach certain point, and thcn they speak in voice of thunder. Nothing can exceed the popular rage against the Lords, for the destruction of the Corporation Bill. 1He funds haue fallen materially, and fuctuate to a lower extent than the closing quotations can give an idea of. Public meetings have been held throughout all parts of the Kingdoms and, at most of them, formal resolutions have been adopted to the effect that the people will not degrade themselves by pettioning the Peers. ""Curses, not louS, but deep"" are general throughout the Kingdom, on the aristocrats who have now committed political suicide.

 Without doubt, much as we English cling to title aud honors, .he day of doom has arrived for the aristocracy. The question is, ""What use are the Lords p and cle- yer pamphlet, thus named, (attributed to Lord Brougham) has gone through eight or fen editions, and has added much to shew the utter inutility of the aristocracy-as body of irresponsible and hereditary law makers.

 The Morning Chronicle, how the organ of the Goverement, has preached republican doctrines, and the tone has been adopted by many of the London and country pa- pers. The people are also forming opin- ions fatally at variance with the further continuance of the power of the Lords. You will see, ere long, that an attempt will be made, in Parliament, either wholly to abolish the upper Chamber, or assimllate it's constitution to that of the Senate of the American Congress.

 The affray at YickAburg, where five persons were summarily hanged under ""Lynch's Law"" has caused great discus sion in the English papers. The friends of America condemn the act, but protest against an isolated incident being brought forward as an argument against the whole nation."

 i You must be aware that the influence of the press IS diminishing as 1t is liable 10 abuse. There are many papefs--too many papers, published in the United States, each giving light within the visible horizon of a few neighboring counties, and but few of the corps of Editors are rated as big guns. The press has made itself impotent. It has become the organ of political parties; and since no legislation can ever restrain is license or punish the grosaest violations of law, where the responsibility is divided until 1t becomes fraction, society has united in self defence, as it would to disarln q drunken giant.

 LYNCH'S LAW.",,"man calling himself R. w. Carroll, but whose real name, we understand, Is Wood, and who has carried on the business oi hair dresser for some years in this city, but who has rendered himself for long De- rlod obnoxious to the citizens from his con nexlon with slaves, as receiver of stolen goods, particularly the artlcle of cotton, was this morning compelled to undergo the ope- ration of Lynch's Law. Carroll had full warning 10 depart the city, as this commu- nity was determined no longer 10 submit to his presence. H disregarded this warning and appeared to brave his fate. He was accordingly taken from his residence this morning between s and 9 o'clock, and about twenty lashes inflicted on him. lie was then stripped from his waist upwards, tof7'ed, and coat of COTTON, not FEA- THEIRS, bestowed on him, from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, so that he presented rather ludIcrous aspect, as nothing but the face was visible, peering out from mass of white, and thus render ing his mode of punishment emblematic of the nature of his offence, as an extensive contraband dealer in the principal staple of the South. He was then marched in pro- cession through few of our principal streets and lodged iii the jail, whence he will of course have to depart the city.

 The whole proceeding was conducted with the utmost quietness and order, seve- ral respectable citizens lending the counte- nance of their presence 10 the measure, while no other individual was in any way molested. The impunity with which this man, for length of time, carried on his operations, depredating through his con cealed agents extensively on the property of the citizens, and the cunning with which he laid his plans of plunder and eluded the prooi ot his villainy, rendered it absolutely necessary that some measure should be adopted to rid the community of his pre- sence. Such was the feeling of abhorrence which the conduct of Carroll had inspired. that not sympatbizine voice was raised in his favor.

 To form some idea of Carroll's depreda- tions it is said, on good authority, that he has shipped as many as TO bales of cotton in a season, by the line ships going 10 New York, made up of spells which were ob- ,ained by corruption of our servants, which it would be impossible any longer to permit.

 Our course with regard to the Gamblers who haunt this town, has called down upon ,,s the anraadversions of both the Times and the Gazette. Our readers, therefore, will haze patience while We reply to both as brief ly as possible.

 When we first published the account of the cxcesses in yicksburg, we uttered senti- ments which we shall ever entertain. We then declared that we could not look without horror and disapprobation on such scenes enacted in the eyeo of the law. To that opin- ion we still holland the reasons for 1t are, to us, strong and conclusive.

 Every man who urges, as the Times and Gazette have done, that the people should take vengeance, in defiance ofiaw, whenever they may think 1t necessary, is urging the people to throw down all law, and to establish anarchy, revolutionary fury, and popular im- pulse, in place of 1t. It is confessing that q republican people cannot pass laaes by s0hich to defend themseEues--that our Government and laws are weak-and that sse are not CO., pa5le of seycgouernmem. They INSULT the people by telling them that they cannot make laws strong enough to defend themselves. It is lamentable condition of things, when VIC gre told by those who are the watchmen of the people, that tho only way for us to defend ourselves, is by trampling on all law, and re- enacting the scenes of revolutionary France. Our convictions on this subject are briefly told, We detest the Gamblers, as class of beings, as much as any man who has signed the proceedings of that Associaton--but it Is our firm belief that where the sanctity of the law Is at stake, tbe end does not ;ustyy the make new ones. We are the people-and con make them. While we belong to free and intelligent people, we will ever spurn from us and expose the man or men who shall dare to tell the people that they are not sem sible enough to make laws to defend them selves--that they should have either anarchy, mob law, Lynch's law, or DEsPoTIsM. As we are living man, NC would sooner choose to confide our destinies to Napoleon, than to the will ofa people only governed by their changefnl impulses. We shall speak of that part of our subject again before we. conclude.

 We were called upon by William Copp, professedly gambler, on ""Wednesday eve ming, last week, to publish the article which appeared in the last Advocate. He offered us our price for advertising, which was ssoiee the common price. He paid us for 1t, we published 1t, and marked 1t paid. This course has been the subject of censHre from both the Times and the Gazette. 4 few words to each of them will put them out of cur way, and leave us to deal with the public, to whom alone we arc answerable, and to whom we are always ready to account. AS the Times comes first, we will dispose of 1t first. The Editor of that paper accuses us of being i'll favor of the gamblers, and of being brought to favor them by the paltry sum of fifteen dollars. We are not in favor of them, and will explain, in the course of a few sen- tences, the reasons why we published that ad vertisement. At present we would only say, that fifteen dollars may be an unimportant sum to the rich old gentleman who edits the Gazette, or the very liberal, careless, and profuse publishers of the Times. No man ever suspected either of the three of loving money, or caring more about it than their neighbors. To us, however, being rather poor, and penurious withal, which neither of them is, fifteen dollars Is no inconsiderable matter.

 We are sorry that we have lost the friend- ship and good feeling of the Times. Ne as- sure that paper, however, that we cannot be forced into a quarrel with 1t. We are not it's political eaemies--so far as any body knows any thing about its politics-and we have mo- thing to induce us to injure it's Editor per sonally. He has been rather protase of hard words against us, but as he seldom seems to know what his words mean, CT to have any ideas scattered about among them, we do not suppose that he meant any thing very bad about Us.

 The Gazette also rcprobates us--on both pages of the paper--for publishing an adver tisement for which we were paid And now a word or two on this subject. When an ad-"

Then there are success sion of small stalactities, on which if you strike with a small cane (do not strike too hard, or you will break them, for they are

 Loss OF FRIENDs.-Our very hearts die within us when sickness and death 'as- sail our beloved friends. When the heart on which our image was engraven, and which beat with generous affection for us, is insensible and cold-vhen in that dark I and narrow bed, from which they cannot rise, sleeps father, wife, child, a friend, we feel sorrow which refuses to be comforted. We dwell upon their ex- cellencies with mournful pleasure. We think of the happy hours we have spent in their socicty-hours never to return-with a feeling which nearly approaches to des- pair. IhGf they are no nOre-that they have ceased to think, to feel, to act, at least for us-that the eye which used b gladden. a. our approach is dark, and can no more beam upon us with the cnunsels of Gisdorn, or sOoth our souls with the accents of hal- lowed and virtuous affection, is silent for- Z ever-no more to solace us in sorrow, no more to excite or heighten our pleasures. while these thoughts press upon the mind, 7 (and on the loss of our dear and vrtuous friends they do necessarily press upon it, sinking it to the dusf) the universe is a

 blank to us. No longer do we discover z any traces of that supreme and unchanging goodness which we had been accustomed to contemplate with delight. But even in these moments of sadness, we must be un- o just to ourselves, and 10 the A Author of our ? mercies, if we are not soon revived by the 7 consciousness of benevolencc, to which the severity of anguish may, for while leave US insensible. The privation ofour friends, affective as it is, is never without benefit to US. It is then that we feel that we are

 born for immortality that the world is not z our home; that we are travelling to fair CT cline. It is then that we. enter into , religion, and feel its genuine spirit. The

 same happy effects are often produced by

 sickness and to natural and moral disor-

 ders which prevail, we owe tlie production !. and growth of the excellencies of our na- t1rs. In word, an attentive considera-

 lion of what are termed the evils of life, enable us to discover so much of the truest

 benevolence in many of them, as may we'll

 Extract from q letter, dated Cdnton, (Miss.) July 8, 1885. have to inform you the disagreeable news | that the negroes are about tO rise upon the whites. It came out about two weeks ago {; the whole country is, in alarm. There have heen meetings throughout the whole State, to 1 adopt measures to find out the ring leaders 1 and to appoint patrOllers. We are out patrol l ling every night. Last night was in a com. ] pany to ride about the country to the planta- tions. 10 see if every, negro was at his home. l There was white man taken up at Vicksburg, concerned with the negroes; they called a court together, and brought him in guilty, ] and hung him right off. There have been three more white men taken up. but they have not had their trials yet. In Livingston, a town 12 miles from here. they gave a negro l 800 Dashes, before he would discover any thing; then he informed them that the blacks were to rise on the 4th of July. The iail here is full, and they are bringing more in every day. We have meeting here to-day to form volunteer company, tO be ready at minutes notice, and we are prepared with guns and ammunition.

 Whilst l am writing this, there is large meeting here to adopt resolutions to protect the citizens. also to send on to the Secretary of War to send company of soldiers to pro tecs the citizens of the county. They hang cd two negroes yesterday at Livingston, and they have about fifteen more that they are going to hang. We had four brought in here this morning to examine, and expect they will hang one of them.

 The Court has just adjourned. They tried three blacks and fogged them all. To one of them they gave 200 lashes. There were three white men at the head of the ins,lrrcc- tion, that have run away. They have one in jail. They took him out yesterday, and gave him Lynch's law. that is 39 lashes in this country. They expect to hang him.
