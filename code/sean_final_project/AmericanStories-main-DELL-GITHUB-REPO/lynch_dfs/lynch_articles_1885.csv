 Daniel Malloy of 42 Canal street, the un- fortunate victim of the stabbing afray on Webster street during which Bernard Lynch stabbed Malloy with large knife inaicting injuries which may prove fatal, was taken with bad spasm yesterday morning. Nal Joy while delirious overpowered his attend ants and rushed out into the street and be- gan breaking the windows in the house. He soon became exhausted, however, and was taken back to bed and Dr. Russell, thinking he was much worse, sent for Coroner Mix, who took his ante-mortem statement, but refused to say what statement Malloy made. Malloy. however, told Detective Reilly in conversation yesterday that he went upstairs to Lynch's rooms Wednesday afternoon to stop the TOW, as he has done before, and find ing Lynch abusing his wife, used some pret- ty strong language to him and otherwise chastised him. He then went out and had got nearly to the bottom of the stairs when Lynch came to his door and called him a very vile and insulting name. Malloy turned about and ran up the stairs to resent the insult and probably struck Lynch several blows; so thinks Detective Reilly. Malloy then turned to go down stairs and had no sooner done so than Lynch showed the knife into his back. Lynch undoubtedly armed himself while Malloy was descending the stairs and applied the most insulting cpl thets he could think of to bring Malloy back within reach of his blade. Malloy also told the detective that the reason he had refused to say anything about the case was because he did not want his father to know that he was interfering with his ten ants Four witnesses have been found who claim to be eye witnesses of the occurrence. They are Edward Cassidy, James Cashuan, Mrs. Ellen Reilly, who lives on the same floor with the Lynches, and Miss Mary Nal loy, who corroborated the story told Detect i've Reilly by Malloy. Late yesterday after noon Malloy was taken to the hospital in the police ambulance accompanied by Dr. Rus sell, and at midnight he was somewhat de- lirious but doing as we'll as could be expected."

Subsequent developments have proved beyond a
doubt that young Terry was madman, and
proof has been adduced that his family were
advised over and over again to put him under
restraint. Gov. Cameron offered reward of
$1,000 for the apprehension of any of the lynch
ers. The Offer, coupled with the fact that Terry
was the son OF prominent Confederate Gen
eral, and had numerous friends, has had the
effect of starting good many determined par
ties on the tral of the lynchers, who are be-
lieved to include many of the leading farmers
of Bedford. The lynchers have resorted to
every effort to cover their track. but Gen. Buck
Terry, who was Stonewall Jacksou's favorite
commander, is a man of indomitable will and
courage, and there is little doubt but that he
viii sooner or later get upon the track of the
sayers of his son. Both editors and lawyers
in Bedford have received anonymous notes
commanding them to cease all efforts in regard
to capturing the lynchers, and threats are in
dulged in against all who have shown any

in public or private life who stands
higher than Hon. Allen G.. Thurman.
The Democrats revere him and the
Republicans admire his splendid char
acter His appearance during the
campaign created geruine enthusiasm.
He worked increasingly for the success
of the Democracy at 4 time when the
party was divided In its councils, a
prey to the avariclous self constituted
leaders, who playing into the hands Of
the opposition were ready with palm
open behind them to accept whatever
was dropped into it. The taunts and
sneers of the purchasable did not affect
his course. He kept straight on in
his fight for the party, and whatever Of
honor or endeavor the Democracy Of
Ohio displayed during the October
campaign, Judge Thurman is entitled
to the fullest praise and recognition as
a leader, whose purity, ability and
manllness strengthened the principle
he contended for. He is about seven
ty years old, over six feet in height,

he made no pleasant contrast that
wasn't iiaSned back from the thous-

swarmed beneath him.


Hannibal Hamlrn, of Maine, was an
amusing and conspicuous figure IN the

the pathway made for him in the

five years old Hannibal Hamlin is in
good health and spirits. In an inter-

mittees will fairly get down to their work.
Tomorrow afternoon hearing will bs given

sioners of pharmacy on their bill which pro-
vides that it shall not be lawful for any person
in the State to conduct the business of an
apothecary without receiving a certificate of

aud retailing of all medicines, simple or COM
pound, which are prescribed in any pharma-
COZ @ia; the manufacturing of all chemical and
medicinal preparations therein directed; pre-
pairing or compounding the prescriptions of

of the commissioners to prosecuts all cases as
may be brought to their notice accompanied
by testimony. The bill docs not apply in its
provisions to physicians who prepare and dis
pense their own medicines, nor to the sale of

ANACONDA. MONT, April 17.-This
city was shaken yesterday by terrible
explosion. Hardly had the sound died
away ere another explosion, much louder
than the first, brought the inhabitants to
their doors, trembling with fear. They
thought at first that an explosion had oc-
CURED in the smelter, but soon learned
that a Chinese wash-house Immediately
adjoining the California restaurant, on
Front street, had been blown up and the
inmates horribly mangled.


Four of the six Chinese who were in
the building are dead, one other will die,
and one escaped unhurt. Giant powder
was the explosive used. The house is
complete wreck. Windows in the
vicinity were shattered, and stones were
found on the roofs of buildings two blocks
away. Some time ago two wood chop
pers broke open the house, hurled two
beer kegs through the windows, beat the
Cinnamon and stole some clothes. They
were arrested, and two of their number
sent to the Penitentiary. They escaped,
and it is supposed the fiendish deed was
done by them. The police are in pursuit,
and if captured they will probably be
lynched."

Whether the result was caused by the compression of the cloud by two opposite winds, or by being forced into the gorges of the mountains, dashed against their lofty, precipitous walls, or by the agency of electricity, those who know must tell. We can only relate the fact.

 The velocity with which the water moves down the grade, from the source of it's june ton with the Platte, is worthy of note. A ranchman named Eyser, living about twelve miles up the creek above Denver, hearing the ominous roaring of the flood coming from the highlands, and knowing the danger to which Denver was exposed if taken una wares, mounted his horse and with all possi- ble speed made his way to the city. It was race between ""Jupiter Pluvius"" and horse flesh, in which the latter was barely success full, for scarcely had the Mayor and other au- thorities received the forewarning and made nasty. provision for protection, when ""the floods came' and the torrents swept through the midst of the city.

 Immediately the danger signal was given and thousands of people hastened to witness the mad rage of the pillows It was aston ishing to see with what speed the turbid and turbulent flood, eight feet deep, swept over what but an hour before was only dry bed of sand AltAough no lives were lost, con siderable damage was done to property, the Mayor thiDEG Tnt fiftann thorSand 6n1- lars. The abutments of iron bridges over the creek were severely washed and were saved only by throwing into the washed out chasm hundreds of gunny sacks filled with sand. Two inch blanks spiked to heavy posts set as breakwater to protect the banks of the creek were swept away as if they had been made of pasteboard. The beautiful City Hall, built, as many think very unwise- ly, on the east bank of the creek on a sandy foundation, is in imminent danger of being undermined by recurring floods. A heavy stone wall is proposed to protect it, but since that will cost some thirty-five thousand dol lars at least, it is probable that some other

 method of protection will be adopted. The most radical and popular proposition now is to turn the channel of the creek at some point several miles above the city, so that it shall flow into the Platte far above or below the city.

 Colorado is subject to cloud-bursts in the !uOuuGdluS, OuG IS 1ISo lEOLu Guo D0IllS LII GOT- nadoes and cyclones which prevail at the East. In no part of the country does cleo tricity pervade the atmosphere more general ly or abundantly than in the region of the Rocky Mountains. Here it seems to remain in state of more complete diffusion, owing in large degree to the dryness of the air. While ordinary thunder storms are abundant in summer in this region, and wind storms sometimes blow with considerable violence, taking up dust and sand creating what are known as ''sand storms,"" electricity is sell dom developed as an element of the storm to unusual degree.

 Tomatoes seldom occur until the noun tain winds have passed several hundred miles out on the prairies eastward. far into Kansas an Nebraska, where they meet the moisty warm air of lower altitude, in which, if not the chief cause, it acts as very potent fac tor in the destructive cyclones which are so common in all the States east of the hun dredth meridian.

 Denver has been considerably agitated of late by an outburst of different kind. In previous communication I alluded to the strike of the Knights of Labor,"" employees on the Rio Grande and Denver railroad.

 The strike proved failure and many of the strikers returned to their work. A few were convicted of violent conduct in their attempt to force the Brotherhood of Engi- neers to join them in the strike, and are now serving out their term of confinement in prison. A bitter hostility has grown up be- tween the two organizations because the en- gineers did not think the Knights were justi- fled in striking and refused to join them. Condemned by the United States court, hay ing lost the sympathy of the community, which at first was largely in their favor, some of the more reckless and vindictive ones have resorted to the use of dynamite in order to wreak their vengeance on the Denver and Rio Grande railroad company. Three explosions have been made with the design of terrorizing the railroad company and pun ishing the engineers for refusing to comply with their demand to join in the strike. The locomotive of one engineer has been twice blown from the track, but in the several at tempts no one has been killed, nor has the engineer yet been persuaded that the Knights were right in striking, or wise in their meth cd of seeking dynamite justice.

 By the last explosion last Friday evening the engineer was severely injured and his To- comotive badly disabled. The track was torn up and the rails were broken or twisted and excavations were made into the ground two or three feet deep. The city authorities, the police force and citizens generally are thoroughly aroused to ferret out and bring to justice the miscreants engaged ln this ne- farious work The Knights themselves are becoming divided. Many condemn the cow ardly, secret deeds of violence and some have abandoned the organization, and very many would do it if they did not fear the vindic- tive punishment to which they would be ex- posed.

 Yesterday Suspect was arrested and the chief of police claims that there is abun- dant evidence of his guilt, but it remains to be seen whether those who are cognizant of facts in the case will dare to testify so as to secure conviction. Strong intimations of lynching are freely thrown out in private conversation and by the press. Vigorous condemnation has been expressed of three or four leaders of the Knights, and especially of the editor and proprietor of their paper. This is the language used by a city paper this morning: s'Public sentiment will favor the sitting of Smiths case to the bottom, and the strong arm of the law, backed by every decent, law-abiding citizen in the communi ty, will protect every witness in telling the truth. If the Knights of Labor or anyone else attempts to rescue any dynamiter o1 suspect or to bulldoze witnesses into keep ing still or speaking falsely, there are ropes and trees ready""

 The lines are drawn, and healthy as this climate is reputed to be, it will soon become very unhealthy for prolonged residence oi any individual who talks or in any way acti approvingly of the dynamiters' destructive conduct.

The cattle were in splendid condition notwithstanding their long drive. The foreman informed us that the feed in the South Park was the best they had struck since leaving Arizona.

 Record Epitaph: The cattlemen of the lower San Pedro have given public notice that that section is already stocked to its full capacity and that the turning loose of large herds upon ranges already occu- pied will no longer be tolerated. They should be countenced in this movement by the united public sentiment of the county. They arc nearly all owners of small herds, and it is upon such the pros perity of the country depends. We have no particular use for ''cat- tie barons"" or ""bull-ionaires ;"" but if all the springs and water holes in the territory were occupied by settlers with small bands of cattle, our ultimate prosperity would be assured.

 San Antonio (Texas) Exchange Justice BIendorff, of this city, is engaged in taking testimony in a very important case, wherein the Lynch Brothers, of Dona Ana county, New Mexico have sued Grayson & Co.,, cattlemen of the same territory, for $22, 2,000 damages alleged GO have been caused to plaintiff by introducing the Texas fever among their cattle. The tes- timony thus far elicited, solely from southern Texas men, goes to show that the Texas cattle never had any disease of any character, contagious or otherwise, and medi- cal experts testified that cattle can not transmit disease with which they were not effected themselves. If the plaintiffs are successful in the suit, it will be the first case on which other cases involving mill lions of dollars will be predicated.

 Kansas City Live Stock Record: After mature consideration, the President and Cabinet have reach ed the conclusion that the leases of lands in the Indian Territory held by cattlemen are invalid, and 1t has been determined to take steps to have them set aside. Gen. Sheridan has reported that no per manent settlement of the Indian trouble can be effected while the cattlemen are in possession of the best lands,a ,and it is the intention of the President to remove the disturbing element, and reserve the Indian Territory for the exclusive occupation of the Indians. The method of procedure has not yet been determined. A Presidential proclamation may issue, but it is regarded by we'll informed persons as more probable that actions will be begun in the United States Courts of the western districts of Kansas having jurisdiction over the Territory looking to declara- tion of the invalidity of the leases

 San Juan Prospector: The ques- tion of new stock ranges is bother ing the stockmen of Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and Wyoming, overstocking upon the old ranges rendering it necessary for owners of large or even medium-sized herds to push on-but where? In Colorado the ranges of the White river, the Naturita, the Uncompah- gre and other streams west of the range have been the goal of the stockmen, but now that these ranges are fast being occupied, about the only place left is Arizona, where the water supply must be procured through a system of wells -the natural water holes, for the most part being already located i and guarded.

Anne Court House, having determined to
take the law in their own hands and wrcak
vengeance on the murderer. They reached
the vicinity Of the Court House about 10
O'Clock at night, and halted on the North
Landing road. The crowd by this time
numbered about two hundred persons. A
leader was selected and fifteen men To do
the principal work Of capturing the mur-
derer and performing the execution. When
the Jail was reached it was II o'clock.


The jailer, Mr.. Murden, and his wife oc-

were asleep, but were soon awakened by
loud knocking and opened the door. AS
soon as the door was opened the crowd
rushed in and took possession. The keys
OF Noah Cherry's cell were demanded, but
the jailer refused to give them up. The re-
tusal was OF no moment; the crowd was
supplied with sledge hammers and crow
bars, and had no difficulty in finding the
cell in which the prisoner was confined, he

place selected for his execution.


On the way Cherry made dash to escape
from his captors, but a pistolshot in the arm
brought him TO halt. He was piled with
questions as TO his motive for the murder,
and denied everything, but on being told
That his wet Clothes had been found with

AusTrs, Texas, December 26.--Two
terrible crimes were committed in this
city after midnight which will undoubt-
edly result in three deaths and there is
no telling how many lynchings. During
the past year Austin has heen horriiied
every few weeks by some dastardly at
tack on women, botn white and colored.
About midnight last night w. ii. Han
cock, well.to-do carpenter. residing at
203 Water street, was awakened by
proans. and on entering his wife's cham
ber adjoining. he fonnd a vacant bed
covered with bloodspots. He followed
the trail ont of the front door, around
the house into the backyard, where he
found his wife weltsring in a pool OF
blood She had been struck twice
across the head and face with blunt ak
and her skull fractured. Although still
alive the physicians say that the lady
will surely die from her wounds. In
the midst Of the great excitement pro-
duced by this outrage the citizens
were appalled, at learning OF
still greater crime perpetrated about
the same time, several squares
distant. At O'Clock Mrs Phillips. re-
sining at DOS Hickory street, was awak-
ened by the cries OF her grandson, and
entering her son, james Phillips room,
she found the infant on the bed covered
with blood and Phillips lying senseless
from terrible blow across the head.
Mrs. Phillips, his wife, was missing.
Frightened neighbors followed the
bloody trail and found her body lying in
the back yard OF the adjoining premi-
ses. Death had resulted from blow on
the forehead with an axe. There is no
clue to the perpetrators OF either crime.
The excitement on the streets during
the day has been very great, and Christ
mas was forgotten. The Mayor called II
meeting Of citizens at the State house.
Nearly 1000 attended, and committee
Of public safety was organized. The
feeling over these last outrages is in
tense and house to house search for

MORE CRIME AT AUSTIN.


No clue has yet been unearthed to the
mysterious tragedies Of Christmas eve.
Mrs. Phillips, one of the victims, was
buried to-day. Mrs. Hancock is slowly
diving. James Phillips is also dying.
His wounds are worse than at first sup
posed.


The community was Mortified again
to-day by the discovery OF series Of
crimes more inhuman than the others.
~ e L..
eight-year- white child. were found
in the back yard OF her mothers prem
ises at Clarkesvlle. about two miles
from Austin. Swine were devouring the
body when it was discovered and had
eaten all OF the flesh from the bones, but
the features were recognizable. Last
August Hugh Eaves, the father. myste-
riously died, and a Coroner's jury de-
clared that he had been poisoned by
some person or persons unknown to
them. About the time of Eaves' death
Charles Courtney became a boarier in
the family, which comprised Mrs. Eaves
and her two children, Dollie and
Claude. The unnatural mother tried
to give the children away, pleading pow.
erty. A couple of weeks ago she told
her neighbors that she had given Dollie
to school teacher down the river. Ga
Monday night Mrs. Eayes visited a
neighboring family and asked the privi-
lege OF spending the night. She said
she had also given Claude away to
family in Lampasas. and that Courtney
being absent she was afraid to sleep in
the house alone. The next morning the
woman departed for Austin, saying that
she had received telegram from Him
ois, asking her to the funeral OF rela-
tive who had just died there leaving her
legacy Courtney returned to-day and
found the house deserted and discovered
the body of Claude which had been
buried foot deep and uprooted by the
swine. Intense excitement prevailed
when the news of the murder reached
Austin. Courtney was arrested on sus-
pcion. A search is being made for
Dollie who, it is certain. has also been
murdered. No one saw her leave the
village. The husbands death is also
attributed to the fendish wife. The
police tonight traced the woman to San
Antonio and are looking for her."

PAR0LED IN \ DEAD CoMR RADE's NAME.
TO THE EDITOR: We have Il fine Post of the 6.
a. .R. here, named T. J. Stanley, and Relief Corps
consisting of - members Of which am one. Am
taking Tue NATIONAL TRiBUNE and think a great
deal of it. especially medium OF exchange be-
tween the veterans and jheir families. With this
send a brief account of Chas n Scholield as re-
lated me by himself, which may nc the means of
letting the friends of Louis German, OF
Indiana regiment know what became
of him SchojieId enlisted in the 18th Ohio,
and was in Gen. Crook : Division of the Army OF
West Virginia. At the time of his capture he was
Sergeant, doing detached duty one of Blazers
Scouts-an organization TO rid the country of bush
whackcrs, and which well armed. equipped
ami mounted. On the raid TO Lynchburg they
were captured the second day out and sent to
Stauu;oii where SchofeId yr1s mt in iaiI tn he
held ~ q hostage. The rebels being compelled to
retreat, took the prisoners along, and during the
march changed clothing the hostages were not
recognized again. They Were held q few days in
Iynchburg, then sent to Anderscnville, arriving
there June -, nearly starved rain pouring down
in torrents. With 5000 men there. scarcely room
to sit down the ground, they never got anything
to eat till next day at noon. and never had good


drink OF water until Providence spring burst in
August. In September Schoiicid's health failed
go that when he down ne could not get up
without help. He sent from there to Macon,
from Macon with 30 Others to- Savannah, where he
stayed 81 month""; then back to Miilen, where sick
ones were to be- exchanged. He was examined and
sent back being informed there Others scker
than he was. lie told them OF one Louis German,
Of an Indiana regiment, who very sick, and
whom they accepted. The boys carried him over
and laid him down by the gate but he died before
morning. SSchoteld answered 20 his dead COM
rade's name when called and with several others
was paroled This, after several months of untold
|


those terrible prison pens in Georgia. 1t Is proba
BILE the body of Louis German lies in an unknown
grave, while bis name IS recorded In the list of
those paroed, and no record at all OF Scho-
fields escape. He often wonders if Cor
mans friends ever knew what became of him.
Hoping this may meet the eyes of some of them,
have written this SchoieId never entirely recov-


cred his health but is at present an attendant in
Athens Asylum, Athens Co, Ohio.

last December, and never until then did realize
how sad thing it is for oyir friends 10 lie in

WORK DID NOT CEASE WITH THE WAR.
The Chicago C0mratIe well says:


We often meet women who ignOTantly claim that
there is necessity existing for spec charitable


work III behalf OF soldiers or their families but in
vestgGtiOn would soon convince them that the


suieringS and pTyations caused by the rebellion did


not cease on the battlefield. In times OF peace as
well in times of war comes 70 the adInoni-
ton: "" Withhold not good from them TO whom il
is due, when it is in the power of thine hand and
heart TO do it."" The earnestne5S which character
ICES the work OF the Woman's Relief Corps indi-


that this is the spirit that pervadcs the entire


membership of the Order. Sincerity iii the work
harmony i'll its management, and loyalty to every
will of the Grand Army OF the Republic, nave won
for the Corps everywhere the hearty Endorsements
of the Posts to which they are auxiliary without
whose approval the pcFmanCnce OF the Order could
never be established. May their dealings with


each other ever be tempered by love and equity,


and the efforts the members accomplish be such,


that when the final record is written, it shall be


sealed with the golden zeal of victory.

 Hoof and Horn: The question of title to the disputed part of tine Zuni Indian Reservation, which was located upon by Paymaster Tucker, son-in-law of General Logan, with view of stocking it with cattle, has been under consideration for some time on appeal of Maj. Tuck CT, made through General Logan, on the ground that at the time this location was made the disputed tract lay outside of the reservation, and he was, therefore, not only jus tified in making the location, but is entitled to the land. The deci- sion is adverse to Logan and Tuck CT, and the lands will be confirmed to the Indians.

 Colorado Live Stock Record: The Chicago and Kansas City cat tie markets have been glutted for the past fifteen days with animals from Texas and the western range country. We see in few instances that punches of fair Texas steers at Chicago went as low as three cents, while good export cattle were firm at six and half. From present indications it is fair to pre- sume that good cattle will hold 8 good price through the fall. The men who have them should not be in hurry to crowd them forward, but wait until they are fully ma tured, and put on their last pound of flesh ere the first blasts of winter strike them. While upon this sub- iect we will say it is only astonish- ing that some of the cattle that go from the southwest are sold at all.

 Las Animas (Col. Leader: It is at Santa Fe that 100000 head of stock from Indian Terri tory are headed for New Mexico, and the report has created sensa- tion among the resident cattlemen, many of whom declare that the cattle will not be allowed to enter the Territory. It is not claimed that New Mexico is fully stocked, but the resident cattlemen say there are now in the Territory sufficient cattle to fully stock it in few years, hence their endeavor to keep out new herds. Governor Ross diff fers with them, however, and says there is room in the Territory for five times the present number of cattle, and all stock healthy enough to pass quarantine will be admitted and protected.

in the work Of the W.R.C. all over the State.


Three new Corps were organized in one week.
viz, Shelburne Falls Greenfield and East


hampton, and three applications received at
Department Headquarters in one day. We
greatly rejoice in the organization of Corps at
Shelburne Falls, as there has been an independ-
ent Ladies' Aid Society with the Post in that


town for many years. In 1879, at the conven-


tion held at Fitchburg. this society was repro
sented by the lady who has now been installed

then an earnest advocate of State organiza-


tiOn, but could not favor the admission of any

years they have come into line, and we gladly


welcome them to our ranks.


HEADQUARTERS NOTES.


The National officers at Headquarters were


recently invited to st. JOhnsbury, VT, to be


present at a social entertainment given Cham


berlin Relief Corps, by Mrs Horace r. Ide


The cards of invitation were very neatly gotten


up, and when we remembered that lovely home,


and the genial soldier and wife, always ready


to entertain with such good cheer, it was in


deed with regrets that we were obliged to de-


cline the invitation. But while we are too


busy for much pleasure-seeking this year, we


are glad to be remembered.


The work of our Committee on Pensions for


Army Nurses is taking shape, and we can but


hope that their efforts, aided by such men as


Gen. Logan, Senator Blair, and many others,


will secure the passage of bill that will place
every deserving army nurse above the pOssi-


blity of want during life.


Comrade John Carlin, Senior Vice Com
mander, Department of West Virginia, reports
the successful organization of Relief Corps at
Wheeling, VIVA, in connection with J.W. Holl-
day Post, No. II. The officers were installed
by the Post Commander, Thomas Chambers.


Among the many sad hearts to-day is that of
our dear Past National President, Mrs. f.
Florence Barker, whose aged mother died on
Friday, Nov. 90, and they laid her away in the
gloom and darkness of the storm of Monday,
Nov. 23d. We feel sure the tender, loving SYM

Monday morning. where was met by Mrs. Nichols
the Department President, and Mrs. Denison, De-

pleasure of attending meeting of Root Corps, No.
90 and as it was the occasion of the inspection of
the Corps had an excellent opportunity to the
Corps exemplify the entire work of our Ritual and
it was evident that they have given most careful
attention to all their work and are in a most pros
porous conditions; have a membership of l4S and
on the best possible terms with Root Post.
Many of the ladies and comrades also called on me
at the Globe Hotel in the evening Tuesday MORN
ing left for Chicago, arriving at o'clock Wednes-
day morning. AT the Grand Pacific Hotel was
honored by call from j. l.. Bennett A. A. G., De-
partment of Illinois; Gen. j. W. Burst, Past De-
partment Commander; Col Sandes, Commander
of Muigan Post, No 3O6 also a committee Of
three comrades of Post No 81. On Thursday had
a meeting with the Department President, Mrs.
Julia G. Sine, and eight of the staff Officers regard
ing matters pertaining to the interest of the R.C.


in Illinois and can but hope that the result will
be of practical benefit to Order in that Depart
ment. In this connection would state have
ceive6 since my return home a letter from Col. w.
w. Berry, Department Commander of Illinois, ex-
pressing regrets that he unable to meet me in
Chicago and assuring me of his earnest and hearty
cooperation in the extension of Order in Ili-
nois, and l turned my face homeward with an
earnest prayer in my heart that my sisters in that
grand soldier State might soon take front rank in
point of numbers and usefulness. Friday morning

of the National Counsellor, Mrs Emma Sibley
Pease, who with her husband gave me most cor
meeting at delightful lunch party, given by Mrs.

The Sabbath was a res.fu happy day The De-
partment Commander. Col. r. b. Brown, was also
n guest, and gathered fresh inspiration from his
strong, earnest words OF commentator and sup
port of the W.R.C. Surely the Department of Ohio,

strength.

The recent case of the execution by q
mob of young Terry in West Virginia, for
the killing of Jeter, and the fact that the
insanity of the offender mas been pre- ty
we'll established, have served to direct
public attention again to what is known
as lynch law.


When the people f a community un-
dertake 70 administer the law themselves,
thereby assuming the functions which ci-
vii society and municipal law have invest
ed in solemn courts of justice distinguish
ed for learning and impartial Judgment,
whether such administration be by fren-
zled mob, or quiet band of cool, deter
mined citizens, the fundamental princi-
pies of law and order have been perverted
| and the public peace has been put in ieo-
pardy. Such extraordinary action in a
law abiding community presents grave
question for the consideration of calm
judging people who properly appreciate
the Importance of the preservation of the
public peace and legal forms of justice.


So grave departure from the ordinary
forms of justice indicates some deep seat
ed cause or causes. When the masses OF
the people deliberately act in so grave a
matter, the motive Of their action is not
apt to be found in a hasty freak or sud
denly conceived impulse. Lynch law,
which is becoming in recent years more
and more general, must be understood TO
the public mind with the manner and cir
cumstances of the legal administration oi
justice in the ordinary forms Hence it is
impoTtant that order loving people should
form a correct conclusion regarding lynch
law and its apologies.


The apo ogy which has generally been
made for the execution of he DEGREES OF
Judge Lynch against the ""utragcrs OF
female chastity, which has become, in the
IA1CuNbNAh 'idtSs Ut ICiSN. N'IC CuS 'tiidl '
mode of dealing with such malefactors,
has been the shame which the law en-
tailed upon the victim in givi ~ publicly
and with such indecent parti. ularity the
evidence necessary for conviction. and the
many vexatlous delays which the law per-
mited between the verdict OF the jury
and the execution of the sentence Of he
Court. The Legislatures have recognized
to some extent this apo ogy but he aw
long and vexations delays seem to have
increased, rather than diminished. The
many delays and dill'ory procee iiags
which are permitted in the admins ration
of criminal law at the present d "" operate
directly to increase the popular discon-
tent which sus aims lynch law. Ifcriminal
lawyers were, as class. properly imbued
with spirit of the important relation
their professional conduct bears to the
public welfare, so much trouble wou d not
result from this source: bat that, uufortu-
nately, is not the case. There are so many
shysters hat practice in that branch OF
the law, who, actuated by q desire for no.
tority, or other unworthy motive are ac-
Gus omcd to avail of these dilatory mo-
tions 10 an extent that Is suby .rsIve OF
the spirit OF justice and rying to the pub
lie patience. Criminal punishment, 20 be
effective, should be prompt and speedy
ana If the legislature wouia restrain The
people IRON taking The law into their Own
hands. they shou 4 so revise the criminal
code as to give the courts ample power TO
restrain these prowliug wolves of the legal
profession, who bring public justice into
contempt and dsrcputc.


Another cause Of popular discontent,
which leads to summary justice, is the
great latitude which courts and juries have
in late years given to insanity as a defense
in criminal prosecutions. While it is pro-
per, no doubt, that the insane violator of
the law, who is really incapable of dis.in-
gushing right from wrong, should be
shielded from the punishment which is
meted out to wilful aud deliberate crimi-
2als: yet there should he no reasonable
doubt of the complete insanity of the per
petrator OF crime TO enti lie him 70 such
immunity. This was the original policy
and practice of the law with reference to
INSANITY as a criminal defense, but in re-
cent years in this country, through the in
genuity of criminal lawyers, the laxness of
the courts and the ignorance of iuries, this
defense has been carried to most extrava-
CANT lengths; so that it now frequently
happens that men who have always been
able to manage their own affairs, and at.
tend to the ordinary concerns Of life with
out suspicion of insanity, having slain a
fellow being or committed other gross
crimes, are acquitted on the ground OF
''momenrary insanity"" 1t is such perver-
sions of justice as this that gives rise to
serious popular distrust of the legal ad-
ministration of justice AMI it has come to
oC Soibhioh iSuhhih dihouS tue uidssts
that any criminal who has money enough
to fee shrewd lawyers. can have himself
declared temporarily insane ard thus
escape the punishment of his crime.


Lynch law is certainly a great evil,
which threatens the very existence Of law
full government and social order; but, il
our lawmakers would restrain it. they
must lop off some of the morbid excresen-
ces which now deform and obstruct the
administration of public justice."

How the Convicts Are Worked and Treated


A Field for tho Criminal


Laws Made Only for Negroes.


s'The Shooting of Penitentiary Con-
victs,"" was the heading of dispatch
in a newspaper which read on last
Friday, and which gave the details Of
the shooting of three hired convicts,
who were at work in the Coal creek
mines in East Tennessee, writes an
Indianapolis correspondent of The Gin
cin1ati Enquirer. To-day I read an
other paragraph which stated that the
convicts in Arkansas are hired out to
farmers at So per month. Within the
past ten years, and often during that
time, I have had opportunities to see
every phrase Of the system of leasing
convict labor in various states, but
have given special attention to those
states which allow the convicts to be
worked out OF doors. What shall
write on this subject will be unvar-
nished facts, and l will try to make
them so distinct that no one can dis
pute one statement which I will make.
The states which | know lease their
convict labor to be worked outside of
the penitentiaries are Arkansas, Tex
as, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, and
Kentucky. Most of the states lease
their prison labor, but in the north the
convicts are worked within the prison
walls; the tasks are regulated by the
state, through its own officers; the
state feeds the convicts, treats them
when sick, attend to their sanitary
condition, has them bathed and their
clothing properly washed and mended.
I shall not make comparisons, they
are unnecessary, for the intelligent
reader can do that when he has the
facts. I only want to call atten-
tion at the outset to the fact that the
constitutions of all the states, follow
ing the eighth amendment to the
national constitution, provide that
""excessive bail shall not be required.
nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel
and unusual punishmcnts inflicted.
Itmay be that / do not know what
constitutes ''cruel and unusual pun
ishments,"" so that those who read the
facts will have to be their own judges.
During the years 1875, 1876, and
1877 the convicts of the state of Ar
kansas were leased to Mr.. Zeb Ward,
of Kentucky, MIR. Ward had been a
prison-labor contractor in Tennessee
when first knew him. His lease of
the penitentiary of Arkansas and of
the. convicts was for the term of ten
years. One of the conditions of the
lease was that Mr.. Ward should not be
hampered with the presence Of ward


en- or any state officer who could stand
between the cupidity or passionate
cruelty of the lessee. During the term
for which the persons were sentenced
the state had no control whatever over
the criminals. The contractor fed,
clothed, and cared for them as he saw
fit. About 1875, perhaps 1876, Mr..
Ward found that he could not work
all the convicts in and about the peni-
tentiary, so he opened a large cotton
plantation and penal farm up the Ar
Kansas river, and in what is known as
the river bottoms. There the soil is
very rich, but the malaria is general,
and if not fatal, produced the result
which was fatal in the end. visited
this prison farm twice during the sum-
mer of 1877, once at the invitation of
Mr.. Ward, and once at the request of
citizens of the little town on the Little
Rock and Fort Smith railroad. Dur
ing my first visit I saw that the con-
victs were fed on corn-bread and fat
meat; that they were huddeled to-
gether in the vilcst, tilthjest dens of


cabins within q stockade; that they


were not half clothed, and no regard


was paid to their sanitary condition;
and, worse, that there were no bathing
facilities within the blockade. There


was not white prisoner among the


three hundred then on this prison


farm, and l do not think there was
white man in the pen;tentiary at Lit


tie Rock who was subject to the con-
tractor. Several white men, who in


gentlemanly bouts had killed other
white men, and who feared lynching
or assassination if kept in the jails Of
the counties where the crimes were
committed, were confined on their own
request in the penitentiary until the
courts could go through the form of
releasing them. They, of course, were
not convicts, and when they felt like it
came down town and had good time


with the special guards who looked
after them. It seemed to me that the
criminal laws applied only to negroes
except where the crime was horse
stealing. This observation applied to
all the states, in general way, where
convicts were leased OCT to c trac-
lars, and it appeared to me ~...t the
arrest of negro for any offence
seemed accepted as proof positive
that he WAS guilty. I gave especial
attention to this subject, and no.
ticed that conviction almost al
ways followed arrest. I do not
know that the negro is always a thief;
perhaps he is, which would account
for his almost universal conviction
when charged with crime. The
treatment of leased convicts has been
discussed through the newspapers,
and in Kentucky and in Georgia have
heard of legislative Investigations, but
| am not aware that any legislation
has ever followed which was intended
to mitigate OF change the methods of
treatment to which the victims were


subject. once talked to Mr. Ward OH
this subject, and he told me some Of
the methods by which be controlled
refractory convicts. IN one case
man refused to leave bis cell to work
in brickyard. Mr.. Ward went to
the blacksmith shop and had two long
iron hooks made, which were heated
red-hot, and then taking two guards,
who covered the man with shot-guns.
he told the man to come out in one
minute or he would have him dragget"

 The honor of an office is largely dependent on the character of the incumbent. Let an upright man take charge of the humblest work and it becomes respectable. Put a bad man in an exalted position and he degrades it.

 On the 1st of January, 1885, the several counties in this Territory were indebted as follows: Pima, $S32, ,475; Yavapai, $2O4, ,OOO; Co., chise, ,$1S5, 900; Yuma, ,S11O, ,OOO; Ma Ticopa, $1OO, 900; Apache, s6O,OOO; Mojave, s39, 75O, Graham, $25, ,OOO; Pinal, S20, 400; GiIa. 1000.

 The United States troops after restoring peace and good order in Panama. withdrew, and the Gov ernment of that country now has control. Our Government deserves credit for its promptness in pro. teeting the rights of American citizens.

 It will cost the United States Government $1OO,OO to transport to New York the gold and silver coin now in the sub-treasury al San Francisco. And it is under. stood an appropriations for that effect and to that amount was made at the last session of Con. gress.

Express Robbery Traced Home to the


Apparently Guilty Party.
BLOOMINGTON, IND, May 11.-Au the
work of the detectives has resulted in
apparently fixing the guilt of the
recent robbery of the express safe, aud
the murderous assault on the messenger
and baggage-master, on VIM. Wright,
but short distance from the scene Of the
robbery. Wright was a short time ago
in the regular army, and was also cow
boy in Texas. He left his home in this
county on the day Of the robbery, and
answers the description of the robber
in every particular. A photograph of
Wright taken two yer rs ago was sent to
New Albany, and Peter Weber, the bag
gagemaster, feels confident that he is the
man. A dispatch has been received from
Terre Haute, announcing the arrest of
Wright at that place. The City Marshal
of Bloomington started after him imme-
diately. He will arrive here to-day, and
Weber will be here on the noon train to
see If he can identify him. If he is pro-
nounced guilty, the proba are he
will be lynched.


BLOOMINGTON, IND, May 12.-W m.
Wright was arrested in Terre Haute
Monday and brought here yesterday,
charged with the train robbery commit
ted near here two weeks ago. He says:


''It looks kind of hard to be here under
these circumstances, but feel confident
that Weber will set me free. | want to
see him as quick as possible. | left Tues
dav, the day before the crime was co m
mitted, for Terre Haute, to go to my
uncle's for work. He had none, and
| then bought some notions and
went out on tramp to sell them
for living. The night the crime was CON-
mitted, / was four miles west of Terre
Haute, as l can prove by man whom |
stayed all night with. | forget his name
l did not hear of their hunting me until
Thursday last. On Sunday L went and
gave myself up. I told the police !
wanted the matter Strengthened up at
once. had word from my wife several
times and wrote her a letter the day
the crime was committed. | am sure
they will set me at liberty""


The story is we'll connected, but does
not agree with that of his wife or father.
The general impression is that he bought
a ticket to prove that he was out of the
neighborhood, and that the letter from
Terre Haute was mailed by an accom-
plice, for it is not in his handwriting.
His manner is careless and he wants to
talk to everybody.


His doctors refused to let Weber come
up to-day, but it is thought he will be
here tomorrow to say whether Wrigh t
is the man."

The mur- derer was a young colored man named Ar thur Jackson, aged about eighteen years, and his victim John Perry, well knewn and re- spected citizen. Perry was proceeding along a road near Princeton when Jackson, who had concealed himself among some bushes, fired upon him wilh rifle.

Tuesday morning preliminary exanl- ination was held at which Jackson confessed his guilt. The cool demeanor of the prisoner created intense excitement and he was with difficulty remove to the jail. The excite ment continued to increase and about o'clock a furious mob made rush for the jail, forced an entrance, took Jackson to a neighboring woods and hanged him to tree."

mons. The buildings were severely
shaken aud sustained heavy damage
The reports of the explosion were heard In
Downing-st. The entire city was thrown ln'o
n state of frenzed excitement, and immense
crowds assembled in the vicinity OF the farhaheh'
buildings. The force of the explosion was ire
mendous, shaking the houses for many pocks
around.


THE EXPLOSION AT THE TOWER.


The third explosion was in the Tower. AT the
moment the famous old building was crowded with
visitors, but their number was greatly exagger-
ated by rumor, causing an intense excitement
In to O'Clock sixteen people were
officially reported to have been III
jured None of these is said to have sustained NOR
tai injuries. The attack was made on that portion
of the building known as the white Tower""
The visitors were moving about in all direc.
tious. The structure was badly wrecked py
the conoussion. All the injured persons were VS.
itors. They were promptly removed and cared
for. The rest of the people in the building later
scattered through the city and circulated
reports of the occurrence which increased public
anxiety, and the excitement grew ten-fod.


As soon as the nature of the explosion was real
izsd the police efectually barred all egress froa
the Tower and grounds Every person was
detained and subjected to searching and rlgid
examination, upon the theory that the attack was
made by some person or persons inside the
structure This belief increased In the MINDS OF
the authorities as the investigation proceeded


The ruins show that the explosive was operated
from point somewhere on the inner bastion or on
the esplanade, fact which rendered the action OF
the police in placing their embargo upon
all egress from the Tower grounds
excellently well-judged. Fortunately only
few persons had left the grounds before these
measures were carried out. Then extra guards
were posted about the walls The Tower explosion





The fact that portion of the White Tower was
used as an arsenal, and frequently contaiped
large quantities of ammunition, made public ndig-
nation the more terrible A large number
of children were among the visitors at
the time of the explosion, and many of these little
ones had their faces and hands acerated by the |
broken glass and flying splnters The most piteous
sight In the large crowd of innocent prisoners de-
tanned in the building by police orders was afforded
by those weeping little people with their pale faces
and bleeding heads aid hands.


SCENES IN AND AROUND THE TOWER.


The stories of the injuries to children reused the
immense crowds of frenzied people to a condition
past restraint In tremendous volumes Of sound the
crowd yelled frantically, @Lynch the villains?
aRoast the fendsw Colonel Majendie, Chief
Inspector of Explosives, said in an interview this
afternoon that the ingredients used were niroglyc-
crime compounds precisely similar to those used in
the previous outrages In this city.
The explosion in the Tower was on
the second floor Three floors were entirely
wrecked and the explosion damaged many hun
dred stands of arms that were in the part Of the
building employed as arsenal Lord Chelms-
ford and General Miman took charge Of
the inspection of the damaged structure.


TROOPS AND POLICE on DUTY.
The entire police force Of the city was
put on duty as soon as the out
RACES occurred. and bodies of troops
in and about London were placed
under arms Patrols were sent out
and stationed everywhere in close
proximity to each other and cordons of
officers were drawn up around every public build
ing Chief Superintendent Williamson, of Scotland
Yard, personally inspected the scene of the ex-
plosiOns and Inspectors Livingstone and Kelly
were also put to work upon them.
The damage done to Westminster Hall is
much greater than was at first suspected 1t has
been shown that large quantity of explosive
matter was placed inside the. great orna-
mental gates leading into the crypt, and
they were blown clear off their hinges and thrown
to the ground. All the windows on the north and
south sides of the immense building were blown to
atoms. The conclusion shook down from tho oak
roof Of the Hall the accumulated SCOT of centu-
ries.
Immediately before the report was heard, o
lady visitor who was alone and was about
TO enter tho buildings beckoned to Police
man Cole, and when he went to her she called his
attention to package lying upon tho steps
outside the crypt The policeman picked it
mp carelessly, not suspecting anything and went
with it out into Westminster Hall. Hs had no
sooner reached the hall that the package exploded"

Theirs Driven Out Of Paris by
Force Of Contempt Rather

Formed No Part of their Duty

! Workingmen For the First Time Ac.


complished q Revolution of Labor
E By and For Labsr.


The anniversary of the Paris COM
mune can never be passed in silence by
Socialists, whatever their nationality.
It was on March Is, 1871, that the gov
ernment of M. Thiers was driven out of
Paris by the force of public contempt,
rather than by any act of violence. Two
generals, it is true, had been lynched by
an irresponsible mob, consisting, in great
measure, of provincial soldiers and not
of Parisians; but this was the only
blood split on that memorable day, For
once soldiers showed to the world that
it formed no part of their duties 10 fire
upon unarmed women and children.
Some hours after this act of popular JUS
tice, the central committee of the Ma
tional Guard was prevailed upon to
assume temporarily the government of
the capital. Four days later the Com
mune was elected. Never had 80 many
electors pressed round the urns; and
yet our capitalist press was taken en-
tirely by surprise, and ""our own Paris
correspondents"" had no knowledge what
soever of the men who were carried at
the head of the poll with from $4,000
to 10000 votes each. As Cluseret de-
clared in one of his official proclama-
tions; Workers, you have for the first
time accomplished revolution of labor
by and for labor. Do not let US deny or
be ashamed of our origin. .Workmen
We were, workmen we are. and workmen
we will remain. 1t is in the name of
virtue against vice, of duty against abuse
of authority, of honesty against corrup-
ton that we have triumphed""


But working class leaders are not to
be met on the steps of the Grand Hotel
or at the embassy balls, 30 ""our own
correspondents"" knew nothing about
them, and were dumbfounded when
they saw that simple bronze.chaser
like Theisy obtained 14,661 votes, the
iron worker Asst, $3.50 votes; Avrial,
of the International, 1894 and the
hero and martyr, fresh from the penal
colony of Cayenne, Delescluze, 2O,264
votes. These votes were of course only
district votes, and there are twenty-five
districts or ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN Paris. On
the following twenty-frst day of May, by
an act of treachery, the Versailles troops
succeeded in securing one of the gates of
Paris, and then followed the seven days
street fighting, and the execution in cold
blood, without trial, without investlga-
ton, of thousands of helpless prisoners,
including large number of women.
The bourgeoise weltered in the blood
of the proletariat. Yet in England the
principal thing that we heard of was, the
massacre of the hostages by the Com
mune. False accusations of this descrip-
ton have done so much to injure the
workmans cause throughout the world,
that we cannot more usefully commemo-
rate the anniversary of the Commune
than by reminding our readers that the
Lecomte and Thomas were shot, and
that the Commune had ceased to exist
when the Archbishop of Paris and his
fellow priests were butchered in the
prison of La Roquette. The laws on
hostages as promulgated by the Com
mune, is the most humane law that has
ever been issued by any authority in
time of war; and no order was ever
given by the Commune to shoot the
priests The treachery and revolving
barbarity of the Versailles government
fully justified such retaliation but as
matter of fact, it was not attempted by
the Commune. The hostages were
lynched bv mob after the Commune
had been formally dissolved, and this
mob is stated, on very good circumstan-
tial evidence to have been egged on by
ex-Imperlal policemen in disguise. Here
in England, it is essential to bear these
facts in mind 80 as to efface the false i'm
pressions deliberately fostered by the
capitalist press.


Never had there been so much order,
80 much freedom, 80 complete an ab-
sence of crime, as when the working
classes of Paris held the reins of govern
Eent This was acknowledged even by
English Conservatives who were in the
city during the Commune. The mere
fact that the government of that vast
city with its two million inhabitants
was managed, under the most trying
circumstances by common workmen""
was a revolution which shook the whole
world to its foundation. In spite of the
reaction which followed on the Com
mune's suppression, labor movement
and labor party was forthwith formed


in every country and has developed into

 A meeting of the Board of Public Works was held last evening. Present, His Honor the Mayor (presiding), Gilbert, Fuller, Feld- man, Reilly and Stackpole. F. w. Corbitt appeared and asked permission to connect the new house of Mrs. D. Merrill Sperry street, near Whalley avenue, with the sewer connection to the house on the corner of ed by Mrs Merrill. The matter was tabled temporarily. It was afterwards voted to give permission to connect with Whalley avenue sewer through 8 separate pipe. Thomas Lynch appeared before the Board to ask that something be done to remedy the trouble that proceeds from the East street sewer He said the smell proceeding from the rubber factory through the sewer was in tolerable.

 He was informed that the matter was being inveftigated and a report by Sewer Inspector Dillon would be made later in the evening. When MT. Dillon came in he said that he went into the East street sewer last Sunday night and the steam was so dense and hot that he could not stay there but 8 short time. He said that there were but few men that could go down into the manholee it was so hot. By crawling on his hands and knees he went about twenty feet and could not go any farther. He said the thermometer registered 160 degrees in the sewer when he was in there. He had no doubt but that the hot steam was great injury to the masonry of the sewer and would eventually cause it to crumble in pieces. He said the stench in the sewer from the rubber factory was almost unbearable.

 The matter was referred to His Honor the Mayor to see the president of the rubber company and inform him that the trouble must be remedied.

 Meadow street. the same to be granite trap rock as the Board might decide upon. In opening the bids the names of the bidders were not given, but they were read by letters A, B, c, D and E, so that the Board did not know who the bidders were. It was found that the difference between the lowest bid for granite and the lowest bid for trap rock was S, ,406. The Board then voted to adopt trap rock and award the contract to the low est bidder, which proved to be W. J. Mont gomery.

 The bids which were per square yard, were as follows: P. Bowling, granite, $2. 75 per square vard; c. w. Blakeslee & Son, granite, $2. 65 per square yard; G. Pohlman, granite, $2.7 per square yard; R. Cannon, granite, $278 per square yard; W. J. Mont gomery, trap rock, $1.9915 per square yard.

 After it had been decided to give the con- tract to MT. Montgomery the question arose as to whether he would be able to get the trap rock blocks made in time to complete the job this fall

 c. W. Blakeslee, jr., said that if the trap rock blocks could have been obtained in time this fall his firm would have bid on trap as well as granite, but they were aware that they could not and so bid on granite alone

 After considering the matter further it was decided to send for MT. Montgomery and a messenger was despatched to his residence.

 President Gilbert brought up the matter of relaying the sidewalk on the south side of Broadway, which has been ordered. He said that Christ church society would like an ex- tension of time until spring as they did not feel financially able to do the work this fall. On motion the time was extended to May 1st.

 MT. Crawford said there was a place on Maltby street where the walk needed fixing, it being lower than in other places. The matter was referred to the superintendent of streets with power to act.

 At this point w. J. Montgomery appeared before the Board and was questioned as to his ability to complete the Meadow street pave- msnt by the 10th of November. He said he thought he could do it and was also aware the penalty was five dollars per day for every

 

 after the time specified. He mentioned Tim othy Fowler and MT. Mcdonald of Rose street as his bondsmen, who were consid- cred satisfactory.

 Engineer Hill thought it waste of time to consider MT. Montgomery's bid. He said he could not get out the stone and do the work within the time named and he could not do it for the price he had given.

 The Board thought that if he furnished sufficient bonds it made no difference to the city, as they were secured against any fail ure on the part of the contractor.

 It was again voted to award the contract to MT. Montgomery.

 T. M. Cox applied for the position of in- spector of the Meadow street pavement. Mir. Reilly suggested the name of Felix Bradley as inspector and MT. Feldman named Henry S. Andrus. G. Pohlman was also named A ballot was taken for inspector and Felix Bradley received four votes out of six, and was declared elected.

 The matter of repairing rebuilding the bridge at the Munson street extension, over the ditch at Beaver ponds, was referred to the Committee on Streets with power to act

 Parties owning property on Meadow street were ordered to make connections with sewer and water mains where needed. Adjourned."

 Luke Shields was before the court on charge of non-support of his wife. Attorney Willett stated that Shields was willing and anxious to support his children and had en- deayored to carry out the instructions of the court, and had told his wife that if she would sign the pledge and come home he would support the family. The wife refused to do this, and so he got his children together and had engaged housekeeper to take care of them when Rev. Father Lynch came and took the children away. Judge Deming dis charged Shields and advised him to do the best he could for his children in the future.

 An Interesting Case.

 Yesterday the Supreme court sent in a de- cision in the case of William M Pemberton vs. s. Cohen ordering new trial. Pember- I ton ordered of Cohen certain number of caps, specifying the size of each. The caps were delivered, marked with the size ordered, but some of them were not, in fact, of the sizes ordered, being wrongly marked. Pemberton kept and paid for the caps which corresponded to his order and returned the rest. Cohen did not accept them and brought suit. Wooster and Gager, counsel for Cohen, claimed that Pemberton should have kept or returned the entire order, that he could not keep part and return a part, and Judge Studley so charged the jury E. P. Arvine, counsel for Pemberton, claimed that though the rule where goods delivered did not correspond in quality to the order was such as the plaintiff named, yet where the vendor sent the vendee part of the goods he ordered and with them certain goods of a kind he did not order, the vendee might keep the goods of the kind ordered and re- turn those of the kind not ordered, and that hats of different sizes were things not differing in quality but in kind. The jury rendered verdict for the plaintiff and the defendant appealed. The Supreme court appears to have sustained the defendants claim,"

den delivered a brief and happily -worded address
of welcome on behalf of the adult members of
the Sunday school, and Charles w. Smith con-
cluded with an address cordially welcoming tn Q
Doctor and his family, in the name of the con

Dr.. Gilbert, in an exceedingly happy and
graceful manner, replied to all the speeches.
warmly thanking the speakers for their express
sions of good will. He said he was not wholly
stranger in Indianapolis, as thirteen years ago.
while attending a Sunday-school convention n
here, he had stood in that same pulpit and de-

Mrs Ridenour, and Mr.. Ridenour then told

DR.. 5. t. Gillett then pronounced the benedic
Sion, and the audience repairing to the Sunday
school room below where refreshments were
served, spent an hour in pleasant intercourse and
in makiag acquaintance with the pastor and his
family.


Dr. Gilbert is native of western New York.
In early life he hestated somewhat in choosing
his vocation. Having completed thorough lit
erary course of study he entered the law Office
of Henry Day. prominent attorney of Buffalo,
with the legal profession in view. year later
he became the city editor of the
Buffalo Courier, acquiring a taste for edi-
torial work which has never forsaken him.
subsequently he engaged in teaching in which
calling he remained for several years At last
yielding to convictions that had followed him
for long time. he entered the ministry of
the NJ E. Church, uniting with the Cincin-
natl Conference in 1871. His appoint
ments have been Asbury Church, Cincinnati;
Centenary Church, Lexington, KY; First
Church, Topeka, Kan; Summerfeld Chnrch,
Milwaukee, Wis; Divsion-street Church, Grand
Rapids Mich. The Doctor has never served two
churches in any Que State, and has never closed





congregation. The degree of doctor of
divinity was conferred upon him in 1884
by Cornell College, upon the petition of
about fifty ministers, representing four
different denominations. DR.. Gilbert has been
very widely known as a Sunday school worker
and author. His writings have been mostly upon
educational topics, among them may be named
these works: ""The Sundsy-school Normal
Guide"" THE Teacher Preparing"" ""The Teacher
Teaching"" 1.-THE Earnest Christian"" Dur
ing his ministerial career he has been
several times rendered college presidency, but
has declined. believing that his proper place is in
the pulpit He comes to this city in the full
vigor of his powers, and his new congregation
entertain high hopes of his usefulness.


Among those to press forward and take the
hand of the new pastor was Rev. DR.. w. L.
Hypes of Cincinnati, an old friend of Dr. Gil
bert, who happens to be here for the purpose of
uniting In marriage to day Edward F. Cost and
father of the bride also being an old friend of

of provost guards were distributed
throughout the central portion Of the
city, and, beginning with the government
depots and ending with the restaurants,
they proceeded to drag out to the side

On Main street. the principal business

down the cutters in torrents, and men and

their followed hands. others their hats to

o'clock, Jefferson Davis, his cabinet, and

Gen. Lee had ordered to be filed with
provisions to be transported to Amelia

earlier disintegration of his army than

 meeting of the Committee on Claims was held last evening, at which the following petitions were considered:

 Dr. Max Mailhouse asked for $500 damages for land taken by the city from his lot on Whiting street. The committee voted to re- fer the matter to the Board of Compensation to assess damages and benefits.

 James P. Pigott appeared for Andrew E. Butler and asked for damages to MT. Buffers property, occasioned by the extension of James and Lombard streets, which, he said, necessitated bad cut and left Mir. Buffers house, which was formerly at grade, now on small hill. The matter was tabled.

 J. D. Plunkett appeared for William Pow CTS, who fell on an icy sidewalk in front of No. 82 Whalley avenue and broke his arm. He said that Powers was an old soldier, a poor man, and if not compensated the town would have to support him. The Common Council, he said, had considered that Powers had some rights, and they had therefore recommitted the petition. The committee told MT. Plunkett that no claim for damages was made until after the time specified in the by laws had expired, and they therefore had no right to consider the matter. The compensation could not be granted without setting aside the bylaw. The matter was tabled.

 The petition of the Home for the Friendless for the abatement of assessment for side walk was tabled

 R. M. Lynch's petition for compensation for injury to person was tabled and the same action taken in regard to Henry G. Lewis petition for compensation for legal expenses in contesting in the courts his seat for Mayor.

Disastrous Explosions in the Houses oil far'
Iimcnt and Tower of London-A
Large Number of Persons


Injured, Some Fatally",,"nast two this afternoon terrific eNplo-
sion occurred in the crypt at Westniih-
ster hall. which forms the yestibule to the |
houses OF Parliament. The spot al which /
the explosion occurred is close to the
House of Lords. An immense amount OF
damage has been done to the bulidihS'
One policeman was seriously lh-
;ured. Thus far but one arrest has
been made. The report was
heard some distance. Thousands OF peo-
ple rushed to the scene. A Gordon OF
| police had been placed around the paiace'
| Ii is Impossible at this hour to learn the
full extent of the damage. The excite
ment in the vicinity is indescrbablc.
| Parliament and other streets leading to-
ward the houses of Parliament are SO
throngcd with people as to be impass-
able.


oTHRR TERRIBLE EXPLOSIONS.
! Fearful explosions also occurred In the
| library OF the House of Commons and
within the walls of the tower OF London,
which was full of visitors at the time.
Sixteen visitors were seriously injured.
| All explosions occurred at the same mo-
| ment, 2:O9 p. m. AT the Tower the scene
was one Of chaotic terror, guards and Wis.,
itors tumbling over each other in the eff
| fort to escape. AS soon as the cause of
! the detonation was realized the gates were
closed, and visitors permitted to pass
the sentries one by one, after being
searched.


WILD EXCITEMENT.


The widest excitement exists through
out the city. 1t is feared that the police
""A tn Ia. 1 h..
| crowds who have focked to Westminster
and vicinity of the tower, who, as each
new development of the flendsh plot is
passed, express themselves determined
on quick revenge OH somebody, no matter
who.


As the particulars of the explosion are
| learned, they develop an organized at
tempt at the destruction of life and prop
erty beyond anything hitherto dreamed
| of, even by Scotland yard authorities
The places selected by the dynamiters for
their operations are apparently those
where the greatest fatality would be likely
| TO occur because of the number OF people
who frequent them each day.


The explosion in Westminster Hall was
| more serious than at first reported.
-Four people were seriously injured. Two
/ policemen who were In the immediate vi
| cinity of the explosive when ii went of,
| are said to be dying. The Internal ma
/ chine was at first seen by lady, who be-
/ ing curious to know the contents of the
strange package pointed it out to po-
| liceman named Cole, at the same time
asking him what IL was. Cole seized the
| box when the explosion followed, dealing
destruction on all sides and completely
wrecking the hall.


Three minutes after the above occur
renee, and before the people in the vi
cinity realized the full extent of the dis
aster, deafening report was heard, and
the second outrage of the day had been
consummated.


The explosion in the House of Com
mons took place under the strangers gal
lcry, close to Bradlaugh's usual seat. The
lobby was completely wrecked and the
gallery thrown down. The Speakers
chair was destroyed, and the stone work
surrounding it cracked aud displaced.


The explosion at the Tower Of London
took place in the famous white tower.
The quantity OF dynamite used here WAS
greater than at the other places, as the
roof of the white tower was blown off
and the structure itself shattered almost
beyond recognition. Among the injured
/ mere were several CUllurtu Oh lcDueT
years, whose pale faces, bleeding wounds
and broken limbs were pitiful to behold.
When they were carried from the quak-
ing building the crowd which had run TO
the open space for safety became thor
oughly infuriated, and frenzed yells of
""Lynch the villains"" ""Roast the fends,""
were heard on all sides.


All the visitors who were in the Tower
at the moment Of the explosion are still
prisoners there. The gates are closed,
aud will not be opened until the antece-
dents Of each individual shall be thor
oughly sifted. The report that the
prisoners were being searched as they
passed out was erroneous. A corre-
spondent Of the United Press was ac-
corded an interview this afternoon
with Major Majendie, Inspector of Ex-
plosives, on the subject of the outrages.
He states that the explosives were COM
pound of nitro-glycerinc, precisely SINH
lar to those which caused the explosion
Of the London Bridge and elsewhere.
Majendie said that from the information
which he had received from the police
authorities, he was satisfied woman had
been the chief conspirator in placing the
dynamite in the lobby OF the House.
Suspicion also rests upon women in the
other cases.


Loud threats against the Irish are heard
on all sides, and II the excitement contin-
ues, bloodshed will probably follow.

The writer will not deny the existence of
wild locusts adjacent to the apple orchard,
but will ask any candid comrade the simple
question, Do You think any man would ride
under tree with dropping branches full of
long, sharp thOrnS, when nice apple tree, full
of blossoms, stands close by, inviting, with its
fragrance and cool shade-even ON the 9th day
of April, him to stop and rest; especially as he
was sorey perpleXed. and was waiting further
negotiations to stop the effusion of blood"" and
the arrival Of his formidable foe? Certainly,
Gen. Lee was not that kind of man"" Being
highly educated, he naturally loved the beauti-
full, and an apple tree in full bloom would
naturally invite him.


So far as the historic stand is concerned, upon
which Gems. Grant aud Lee wrote and signed
their final agreement, it does not alter the fact
of their first meeting under an apple tree. The
writer has in his possession piece of the first
chip which COmrade Mcfarland took from the
tree. The next morning the roots were dug up,
and nearly all of the adjacent apple trees were
gone. He also noticed that some Of the late
curiosity seekers were at work on the locust
trees.


The controversy between the comrades
DOES NOT CHANGE THE FACTS
which are narrated above and which can be
substantiated by comrades Of the Fifth Corps,
who were on our right in line of battle on the
cminence close to the historic spot.


After the surrender Of Gen. Lee, and his army
paroled according to the terms of agreement,
our division was sent to Lynchburg to collect
and take care of the army stores, which mis-
sion we failod in one year before while under


command Of Gen. Hunter. We then retraced
our steps to Burkesville Junction to be ready if
| needed to necessitate the surrender of Gen.
| Johnston, rs the agreement made aud signed by
him and Gen. Sherman had not been Endorsed
| by the Commander in Chief and the Washing
| ton officials. Not being needed, we then took
up our line Of march and reached Richmond, as
quoted from Richmond paper in this article.

CULPErER, VA, July %, 1SS5.-The Gull
perer jail last nfsht and this morning presented
the unusual spectacle OF a military guard sur
rounding it. The occasion was the apprehen-
sion that Tucker Harris, imprisoned here yes
terday charge of rape, would be taken from
jail and lynched. The company which com.
poses the guard is the ""Cuipeper Minute Men,""


The facts of the case are these: Yesterday
morning the ffteen-year-old daughter of Mr..
Frank Berry, residing one mile west of Mitch
ell s station, went TO the cOwpel, in company
with another young girl, TO milk the cows.
Reaching the place. they were set upon by Har-
apparent. Miss Rerry's companions escaped,
and ran screaming towards the house. Harris
seized Miss Berry and checked her until
the blood ran FROM her mouth and
nose. But before he could fully accom-
plish his purpose the alarm had been given,
and help approaching he became fright
ened and made of. Miss Ferry was badly hurt
about the neck aud head.


Harris, the asSailant. is about thirty years of
ago and IA brutish-lookiLs fellow, aud does not
seem to be possessed of mucn intellect He has
for years been leading q trampish sort of life.
Two years ago he was in Pennsylvania, and got
into prison there. He claims that he was uuder

girl.

mile from the station, he met Harris.
Hume had no arms except an old empty re-
volver, SO he engaged Harris in conversation,
and proposed that they should go to the station
and get drink, to which The latter acceded.
After going a short distance they met another
man v no was looking for Harris, and attempted
to find out privately from Hume whether he
had captured the right man. Harris be-

were posted as guard at the jail, as above In


But for Hume's shrewdness the prisoner
would certainly have been lynched at Mitch
ellis. There is yet a great desire to lynch him
and fears OF trouble are still entertained.


HARRIS TAKEN TO ALEXANDRIA.


LATER.-Since the above was written an ef.

prisoner to Alexandra for safe-keeping. He
was accordingly taken to the depot guarded by

events of the season will be the three-mile
race between H. G. Stone and DR.. A. +.
Schilfmann in front of the Lafayette this
evening. They both came out here di-
rectIv after their race at Lake Calhoun
Wednesday and have done considerable
hard work preparatory TO their great strug-
gle tonight. The race will be started
about O'clock. Opinion has been freely
expressed in the last day or two. by those
that have seen Stone and Schitfmann out in
their shells. that Norm Wright could
best either one of them. He certainly pulls
r prettier and cleaner oar, and in some of
his two-mile spins has made remarkably
good time. III twO-mile race with Hal
Watson of the Lurline club last night, his
time was 1874: WatS0n'S time was 1890.
They lost about a minute on account of a
steamer crossing the course i'll front of
them. There will undoubtedly be a very
large crowd from st. Paul and Minneapolis
30 witness the race. and considerable money
will change hands whoever may win.

dense:


u LULU HURST.


Ever since the above young la
dy gave her first exhibition at
Central Music Hall, we have been
trying to get time to write her up,
or rather down. Why SO many
have been puzzled at her wonder
less deception is to us mystery.
True, this is out of our line of
business, and only take it up on
account of the miserable failure
made by the daily press and the
scientists. We shall address our
talk to those who have seen the
marvellous Georgia Wonder, her
innocent rural father, and the big
end of the show, Mr.. -, Who
acts as ring master. Suppose we
ought to handle the subject in a
more scientific way, but it is too
absurd. We know that there are
thousands who believe, as the
Tribune says, that Miss Lulu
Hurst succeeded in proving to
her audience that the number of
things the world cannot under
stand is increasing quite as rapid
ly as the area Of its scientific
knowledge. We have had nocon-
versation with any one who ever
tried Miss Lulu's odic force, but
have proved the whole proceed
ings by reasoning and experiment,
just as we are going to prove it to
you.


If, as we asked before, you did
see Miss Hurst on the above date,
please step this way to this part
of the room where the green car
pet is drawn tightly, as the foot
hold is not so good for the man
from the audience; then he will
be somewhat nervous anyhow, as
the performance is a novel one
to even an old stager. Now let
your assistant hold the chair just
as you saw it done; mind, he is to
hold the chair and himself still.
Have you got on your lubbers so
you won't slip on the carpet?
Now put your left hand on the
seat of the chair and your right
hand on the flat middle round of
the back. Let the ball Of your
thumb press hard on top Of this
round. Don't take any stock in
the 'laying on lightly business. =""
Bosh! now push, don't pull, as
you an'tpull without grasping, but
push with both hands in a strong
spasmodic way as Zulu did, and
when you get your man started
you can defy a giant to hold the
chair still. He is using his
strength on the slippery carpet to
hold the chair firm; you are using
yours with the leverage and sure
footing. Hold your arm and hand
still in any way you can fix it so
a child can't move tit is I'M
possible; it is the same princi-
pie. -~t


Now take your billiard cue,
grasp it in the middle, fingers up
and hands about eight inches
apart. Hold your elbows down
and press hard against your sides
Stand on one foot, as Lulu did.
Let whoever is assisting you take
hold of the cue as he likes, but
see that he spreads his hands out
at least twelve inches from yours.
Do YOU remember what the young
man said to the audience? ""If
you get Miss Hurst's hands above
I her head she loses her power


Now if you have the cue just as we
have described, let your assistant
push with all his might, and If
Won find he is too much for you
let your hands go above your
head. But without he is a very
strong man it will be impossible
to push you off the one legged
centre of gravity. You may say
that Lulu did not appear to lean
Lu+ che did. though."

Murder of a woman.",,"NEW YORK. MAY 2O.-At 3 o'clock this
morning Frenchman, who proved to be
Iouis Francis of 3O7 Tenth avenue, was
arrested while on his way to North river,
hearing on his body the mutilated corpse OF
a woman who had been murdered. The
officer was attracted by the mysterious
movements of Francis, as he was weighted
down by his ghastly burden, and he was
stopped to see what the bag contained. Inc
Frenchman refused to give any information
and ATTEMPTED to move on, but the police
man insisted on being informed OF the con-
tents of the sack and took Francis i'll Gus
tody. The policeman seized Francis by
the arm. whereupon he dropped the bag
and its contents upon the sidewalk. 1t fell
with a swaShing sound to the sidewalk, and
the officer on opening the sack, TO his sur
prise and horror, found that it contained the
mutilated body of woman. The body
was doubled up and almost nude. The
policeman. on closer examination, found
unmistakable evidence of the fact that the
woman


HAD BEEN MURDERED.


There were CHASTITY wounds upon the
face and the trunk from which the blood
had flowed and coagulated. In reply to
the officers questions, Francis declared that
the corpse was that of his wife, and that
She had died a natural death. Being With
out means necessary for funeral, he had
resolved to carry the corpse to the river and
throw it in The officer refused to accept
the explanation. Francis again shouldered
the bag and bore the mutilated corpse to
the police station. tie was placed unoer
arrest and steps taken to investigate the
supposed mysterious crime. Francis is
a.; ne
no attempt at an explanation when closely
questioned. other than to reply that his
wife had died at their home on Tenth
avenue. and that he was about to throw the
CORPSE into the river on account OF his IN
ability to give it


CHRISTIAN BURIAL.


Iouis Francis tells the following story:
ssYesterday found valuable dog, which
nv wife afterwards lost. [ reproached my
wife for losing him, and she swore at me.
At 7:3O O'Clock last night she sent
me out for beer, and when [ came back
found a man named William Welsh in the
room with her. Welsh worked in the same
shop with me- She sat on my lap and
kissed me. and then she threw a glass at
me and then can. She then went out.
Then Welsh and | walked out half a block,
and then | left him to come home. When
/ came back she was lying on the Hoor
dead. l waited an hour, thinking she
would revive. but she did not. l don't
know what caused her death. She told me
before she died that she did not care for me,
but she liked the man who put up the vine
for her. He is Leopold SaconVllle, and he
lives with Mrs. Lynch, on Broadway.
After / found my wife dead took 10 cents,
and went out and got drink. In half an
hour came back and put her IN the Dag TO
throw her into the river""


The woman is not Francis wife. She is
Selma Fehst. So years old, with son Is
wears old. who lives in Boston. Francis,
who is a year younger than his paramount,
has worked some time in a French polishing
yard. Three months ago the couple moved
into the apartments where the


CRIME WAS COMMITTED.


Francis lived on the ground floor in the rear
structure His three rooms were comfort
ably furnished and neatly kept. Both were
persons in appearance above the average OF
the neighborhood, but both drank freely of
beer, the man to excess. They quarreled
frequently. Two weeks ago, while in one
of his convivial moods, he beat and kicked
her. telling her to the floor. Upon picking
her up he was heard by tenants in the build
ing to say: II guess I've finished her this
time"" As the body lay in the police station
this morning it had the appearance of once
having been pretty woman, dissipation
not aiding to dispel this impression. She
was of delicate complexion, large, express
sive, blue eyes, thick, wavy, brown hair,
and petite in figure, weighing about one
hundred pounds. On the corpse were
scrupulousIy clean underwear, a black skirt
and embroidered nightdress. About the
throat were lines of discoloration and marks
of finger nails. 1t was evident that the
woman had been strangled to death by
twisting the handkerchief around her neck.


The autopsy shows that Selma Francois,
when the body was being borne to the river
by her husband, was strangled. The hus-
band is in jail."

They attended the State muster in 1874 and won the second prize in drill con- test for the championship of the State. In 1877 the Guards won first prize. In 1881 they won the championship of the State both individually and as company, which was the last contest they took part in.

 Captain McMahon was succeeded by Cap tain D. 0. c. O'Donoghue, who subsequent lv became assistant adjutant general. His successor in command of the guards was Captain John J. Lynch, who was promoted to the inspector generalship, and is now colonel of the Fifth Maine regiment. The next commander was Captain T. E. Hartnett under whose administration the com pany attained great excellence. While Captain Hartnett was in command the company entertained the Meagher Guards of Providence and paid re- turn visit to that city in 1889. Capt. Hart nett was also in command at the time tine Sarsfeld Guard paid their memorable visit to Portland.

 The present captain, John A. Gallagher, took command last June, being promoted years of age and is a member of the Board of Aldermen of the city of Portland."

Special Telegram to The BEE,


FAIRFIELD, Ia, July 15. - Considerable
commotion was occasioned here to-day by the
appearance Of Van Buren, county officials, who
were in pursuit OF Lawson Baldwin, of that
county. The story OF the crime, rs related to
BEE representative. was of most revolving
character and savored strongly of murder. It
appears that Baldwin, resident of Birming-
ham, has been in intimate connection with
woman of that place, Miss Matte Rodabsugh,
for the past eight or nine years, and during
that period she has been in delicate condi.
ton three or four times through Bald
was performed. The last instance
which duplicates Fairfield physician, proved
fatal and thence the trouble. Miss Roda.
baugh came here about three weeks ago and
was engaged,as o domestic at Mrs. Culberson's, 3,
a sister of Baldwin, where he had frequent
opportunities to visit her. During her stay
with Mrs. Culberson she was taken violently
sick and DIR. Miliigan was summoned. He
was very secret in his treatment. After q
weeks illness here the patient was renewed to
her fathers residence in Birmingham, where
she fingered until Wednesday when she died
and was buried on Friday-a week ago. Sus-
picion was aroused that all was not right and
a warrant was issued for Baldwin's arrest, but
up to Wednesday he had not been appre.
hended, although he was known to have been
concealed here until Thursday night when
he secured $500, by mortgaging his fine farm,
which is now understood to be in possession
of his father, and made his escape. The Off
GERS employed in this case have displayed no
very great talent, and have easily been duped
by Stacy Baldwin, the fugitive's father.


The families connected with this sad affair
are prosperous farmers. Baldwin is a bachelor
of 80 years, and the deceased girl was 23
gears of age. Should Baldwin be captured
and taken to Birmingham for preliminary
trial he might be lynched, as the citizens there
are considerably incensed at the course he has
been pursuing there for years, The victim
made an ante-mortem statement to hel
parents and the two attending physicians
charging Baldwin and DIR. Milligan with
being the cause of her death. Milligan can be
secured at any time. A post-mortem exam
ination was made yesterday by the coroner."

 A Young Girl in the Hands of a

 Dozen Brutes.

 HUNTINGTON, Pa., August 11.-A most fiendish outrage was committed in the sub urbs at late hour last night by twelve at taches of Coles circus, two of whom were negroes, upon Miss Bertha Morrison, 8 beau tiful and modest girl of seventeen, who with a widowed mother resides at Center Union. Becoming separated from her companions Miss Morrison was approached by one Kim berlaine, who after much persuasion induced her to go into the show with him. Instead of doing so Kimberlaine enticed her to walk around the tents. When beyond hearing of the crowd eleven other employees of the cir GUS emerged from their concealment, grasped and gagged the young lady and carried her across several fields into the woods where they repeatedly outraged her in the most brutal manner. Her clothing was torn into shreds, her arms, face and body shockingly bruised and lacerated. Her piteous walls reached the ears of John McKeown, who compelled the assailants to de- sist and carried the girl to a nsighboring house and started home. He was set upon by the two negroes and beaten

 ALBANY, Aug. 1l.-Governor Hill before leaving for Elmira this evening was asked: ""Can you give any indication to coming political events?'' sOf two things I em cer- tain,"" said the Governor, ''the Democratic State commi ttee will meet next week and sometime next month the State convention will be held. Who will be the nominees is all speculation""

 sBut you are favorably mentioned for re- nominationa'' ""Yes, according to the news papers. In public life one cannot always be held responsible for what the papers say about convention times. My posi- tion, if you still insist upon knowing, is simply this: I believe the choice of the convention should and will undoubtedly be the strongest man before the people. There are several names talked of and they are honorable and upright men, any of whom would be strong candidate. Should the convention decide upon any one of these names shall do all in my power to secure his election. Of course my ambitions are personal-and it is my belief that ambi- tions are not considered dishonorable if honest. If the convention should accept my discharge of public duties as worthy and honors me with the nomination it would be compliment gratifying to me and my well wishers and such compliment as no one could say in advance that he would not accept. But this is all the work of the convention and to that body must be entrust- ed the details and nominees for next falls campaign in the State"""

 A committee of citizens of Stafford, with some of tho selectmen of Ellington, recently passed over the road from this village to the Square Pond post office, via the south end of the lake. The Ellington officials were disposed to b. reasonable ID conceiling improvements obviously called for. Such as changes ln the ronte near the lake where the road by following the small stream may avoid the succession of sharp pitches. The road may be made easy of grade at Q not excessive cost, and there is no sense in compelling travel to the same point. The fixing of this road will shorten the distance between Stafford Springs and Rockville more than one mile over the road through Poland, also make an easy road between Ellington center and the sberough. It will further add much to the attractions of this place as n summer resdet to bring this lovely lake within a short and easy ,ids, and Il 10 benefit the Dimock's pleasure grounds at the lake. Stafford will of course be willing to im- prove it's end of the road to any reasonable extent. Considerable has already been done upon the road within the borough limits

Upon what grounds .""


First. that the appointee-Richard Holmes-is
very offensive PARTISAN He is and for number
OF years has been chairman OF the Demo-
cratic Committee OF Adams County. 1t
was nnder his management that the
OF 1854 in that county conducted The Republican
majority in that county is about 2,000 yet Chairman
Richard Holmes asserted at meeting OF his committee
that Republican majority ia the county at the elec-
tion OF 1884 must be allowed to exceed 6O0 Tho
plan agreed upon to reduce the Republican ma
jority from 1000 to GOO First, to abolish
Carthage and Brenham precincts aud assign tho
voters thereof to the Court House and Jefferson


Hotel precincts respectively second to manipulate tho
returns from Washington and Kingston precincts
furnish tho County Returning Board with protest to
reject them; third, to prevent the holding OF any cleo

gard the recommendation OF the Republican Executive
Committee the appointment OF precinct election Off
GERS for Washington and Kingston pre-
cincts and have tho persons rcpresens
the Republicans these precincts chosen by tho Demo-
cratic club OF each precinct


""chairman Holmes estimated that the Republican
majority In the remaining three precincts would be be-
tween 500 and 6o0 The number Of voters in the Court
House and Jefferson Hotel precincts after the consold
ton effected, large that would have been
physical impossibity for all the votes to be
poled within the time prescribed by law, even II
experts were appointed conduct the which OF
course was not DONE The Republican majority in those
two precincts is about 5OO To this it de-
cded the election officers should admit one Repub-
estmated that this would take in ali Of the Democratic
equal number OF Republican votes be-
legal voters who would thus deprived right

Excluding the returns from the Washington precinct
the Republican majority would have been very little In
excess OF Chairman Holiness estimate. Including the
returns from that precinct the official majority
was something over 1000. Including the
rejected returns from Kingston and Dead

 been made, and tickets sold at . high price and in large numbers. On the day of the concert the distinguished pianist arrived and, with the landlord of the ho- tel and few new acquaintances, vent over to the hail (which. by the way. was a wagon storehouse, the oaly available placr) to sec if the piano was in the right position and the proper arrangements made for the concert in the evening, when, to Gottschalk's assonishment he found that his grand piano had not arrived. It was four o'clock in tho aAeinoon, and no other train that evening. What to do they did not know, as no one in town owned piano. The seats were all sold, and the miners were not a class ot men to be tFiaed with and to make matters worse, they had lately been swindled by gift performer. A statement that the piano had not arrived would have been pronounced too thin,"" and brought down the wratl4 of the miners. They were in an awkward di. lemma. Suddenly one of the party re- membered that German had lately ar- rived and located on the outskirts of the settlement, who had brought with him something that looked like piano. This was glorious ne~s. A wagon was ob- tained, and the whole party drove to the Dutchman's house, determined to get the piano, if they had to buy it. The German was sitting outside his door, and was highly pleased at seeing such distinguished deputation calling on him, and brushing sp his best Eng- fish said

 Shentlemen, vas capituvated nit seeing you come sit dowr, and will go to the sellar and bring up some fine sour milk""

 The party were not in the mood for sour milk, so the preferred refIeshment was declined, and business proceeded with at once.

 ""Kaiser,"" said the landlord, i've under stand you have got a piano; we want to borrow 1t for tonight; can we have it?""

 ""Vell, shentlemen,"" said he ""I don't like to say no, but since my little Katrina wot used to play so nice on them died, we lock 'em up and buts de key away, und it don't bin open now init ten years, urd it would make my heart so sad to blanc und my darling not here""

 Gottschalk, $ho was very tender hearted, was almost inclined to abandon the idea of getting the piano and not wound the heart of the old man. But the landlord, who knew the set of people they would have to deal with in the even- ing, would not listen to any such thing, and after some talk obtained kaiscr's consent.

 It was now close on six o'clock, the key was mislaid, and the instrument locked. There was no time to be lost. so the piano was placed in the wagon and taken to the hall, the old man leaving word with his wife to ""hunt the key up, and send Yacup down to de hall init it as soon as she found it.""

 Arrived at their nation, they found ""Yacup"" already there with the key. The piano was opened, Gottschalk ran his fingers over the keys and ""Oh, hor- TOT"" no sound was produced; yes, there was one note sounded, and on ipvesti- ation there was found to be only one string left in the piano, the middle B fiat. Here was worse predicament than ever, and Gottschalk was nearly wild.

 Suddenly brilliant idea flashed upon him. The hammers struck sharply against the sounding board, the concus- sion producing sound not unlike that of small arms, and the one sounding note could be used as a trumpet. The people were nov coming into the concert room, and Gottschalk at once made up his mind to play GA Grand Battle Piece"" and trust to luck to get out of the difficulty.

 1 At the time advertised he appeared pn the platform, and announced his pto- gramme. He commenced his battle with the feeling that he was leading foriorp hope. The bugle sounded softly, as if from a distance calling the infantry pres ently the hammers rattled out . sharp roll of musketry, the 6ring gradually in- creasing until the battle ragged at its fercest. Then he made the firing die away amid the retreating sound of the trumpet 1; his musketry was ratsling all the time. Cottschalk was in cold pcrspir- ation, expecting every moment to receive enraged audience. Escaping that, as he fired his last gun, he looked around, ex- pecting committee of miners to advance on the stage for the purpose of lynching him.

 Tie was mistaksI vocs1SsoSS @Tr!2.5e greeted his novel performance, and they insisted on his repeating it, and that would not content them, and he had to go through it six times. His triumph was complete, and he had come out of his dilemma with flying colors.

 But did they not find out the way they had been sold the next day?."" asked him.

 ~No, indeed"" he replied; ""why, the next morning a committee of veteran miners waited upon me at the hotel, and handed me petition, signed by all the influential gold-diggers in the place, ask me to repeat the concert"" The Battle Piece had second per- fornance and Gottschalk found that the temporary detention sf his piano proved profitable accident.

But He Says It's All Wrong-The Indiana


Express Robbery Traced Home to the


Apparently Guilty Party.


BLOOMINGTON, IND, May 11,-Al the
work of the detectives has resulted IN
apparently fixing the guilt OF the
recent robbery of the express safe, and
the murderous assault on the messenger
and baggage-master, on VIM. Wrights
whose parents reside near Harrodsburg,
but a short distance from the scene of the
robbery. Wright was a short time ago
in the regular army, and was also cow
boy in Texas. He left his home in this
county on the day of the robbery, and
answers the description of the robber9
Wright taken two years ago was sent to
New Albany, and Peter Weber, the bag
gagemaster, feels confident that he is the
man. A dispatch has been received from
Terre Haute, announcing the arrest of
Wright at that place. The City Marshal
of Bloomington started after him imme-
diately. He will arrive here to-day, and
Weber will be here on the noon train to





nounced guilty, the proba bilities are he
will be lynched.


BLooMINGToN, IND, May 12.-Wm.
Wright was arrested In Terre Haute
Monday and brought here yesterday,
charged with the train robbery commit
ted near here two weeks ago. He says:


""It looks kind Of hard to be here under
A6,a1a Of, e-+o Ir,4y 7 F,o1
that Weber will set me free. l want to-
see him as quick as possible. I left Tues
day, the day before the crime was CO m
mitted, for Terre Haute, to go to my
uncle's for work. He had none, and
I then bought some notions and
went out on a tramp to sell them
for living. The night the crime was conf
mitted, was four miles west of Terre
Haute, as can prove by man whom
stayed all night with. [ forget his name.
I did not hear of their hunting me until
Thursday last. On Sunday I went and
gave myself up. I told the police I
wanted the matter Strengthened up at
once. l had word from my wife several
times and wrote her letter the day
the crime was committed. | am sure
they will set me at liberty""


The story is well connected, but does
not agree with that of his wife or father.
The general impression is that he bought
ticket to prove that he was out of the
neighborhood, and that the letter from
Terre Haute was mailed by an accom-
plfce, for it is not in his handwriting.
His manner is careless and he wants to
talk to everybody.


His doctors refused to let Weber come
up to-day, but it is thought he will be
here tomorrow to say whether Wright
is the man."

 tioned at Length--The AtttOpsy-MaI- I loy,s Dying Statement of the AMray ] in Which he Received the Death Wound-FuneraI This Morning at St. Mary's Church.

 Daniel Malloy, who was stabbed by Bernard Lynch at the latter's residence on Wednesday afternoon, died at the Hospital Saturday morning about a:15 o'clock. None \ of his friends or relatives were at his bedside | when death ensued, the hospital house sur geon and nurses being the only people pres | ent. Throughout the day, Friday, Malloy ] gradually grew worse and fears were enter ! tained by the physicians that he would not l live more than few days. During the ! evening he was delirious and at nc time did he utter coherent sentence. When Coroner | Mix was informed of the change for the worse | in Malloy's condition previous to his removal to the hospital, he went to the house and | obtained from him statement relative to ! the assault. This cannot be used in court ' for the reason that when it was given Malloy l did not expect to die.

 When it became necessary to remove the ' wounded man to the hospital Coroner Mix 1 ordered Medical Examiner White to watch

 

 way from his residence to the hospital. Dr. White reported that in his opinion Malloy would live several hours. Saturday morn ing when the coroner was informed of Nal loys death he directed Medical Examiner White to make an autopsy of the body. Dr. White was engaged in the work all Saturday afternoon, assisted by Dr. Carmalt and other physicians. During the afternoon Coroner Mix conducted an inquest in the judges room at the City court.

 Mrs. Lynch, wife of the accused, the first witness, was instructed by the coroner not to say anything that would criminate her hus- band. She said she knew nothing of the af- fair es the assault was committed in the hall where she could not see it.

 Officers Cook and Louis Waas were next summoned. They told how they had heard of the affair, made the arrest and, at the chiefs orders. looked up evidence and found the knife with which Malloy was stabbed. It was stained with blood.

 Patrick Ma11oy, Miss Mamie Malloy, his daughter, Mrs. Charles Reilly, a tenant in the Malloy house, Bridget Carr, domestic in MT. Malloy's house, and Edward Cassidy and James Cashman, clerks in Malloy's store were the remaining witnesses examined by the coroner, with the exception of Lynch himself who was last brought up from the lookup.

 Miss Mamie Malloy and Edward Cassidy are the only direct witnesses against Lynch, the former having seen the stab- ping from the landing on which it oc- cured and tke latter having stood at the bottom of the stairs and had seen Lynch in the act of stabbing Malloy. Mrs. Reilly and Bridget Carr told the coroner how young Malloy looked when he came down stairs covered with blood. MT. Malloy and MT. Cashman explained to the coroner how the young man came to go upstairs to interfere with MT. Lynch, who, he thought, was beat ing his wife.

 Bernard Lynch was next examined in the chiefs office He is stout, thick set man, well built and below the average height and does not appear to be person given to deeds of bloodshed. It was believed that he would plead ignorance of the affair as he was intoxicated when the assault was committed. He did not do so, however, but gave the coroner 8 long statement, which that gentleman refused to make public. Nor would he give anything relating to the in quest. The inquest will be resumed this af ternoon.

 Several stories are af1oat as to the cause of Lynch's assault upon Malloy. One is that the deceased was too familiar with his wife; another that Lynch was beating his wife and while Malloy was acting as peacemaker stabbed him; and that Lynch found Malloy in his apartments with his wife under suspicious circumstances. Those re- Iating to Mrs. Lynch's infdelity are absurd,

 

 and friends claim that she is a woman of ex cellent character. It is believed in police circles that Lynch was assaulting his wife, 8 frequent occurrence, and Malloy interfering, Lynch stabbed him. Mrs. Lynch previous to her marriage was servant for twenty years or more in one of New Haven's most prominent families (residing either on Wooster street or Wooster Place), where she was very highly respected. She saved up considerable property which Lynch endeavored to gain possession of, and it is believed that this was the cause of many quarrels between them. Mrs. Lynch has since her marriage done the washing for different families, thus earning a little money, which was also bone of contention, and she often bore the marks of cruel beat ings which were given her by her husband.

 City Attorney Cable said that he will make out two indictments against Lynch, one for murder, the other for manslaughter, and turn them over to State Attorney DooEttle, who could use which he deemed best

 Malloy's remains were removed from the hospital to Iris fathers residence yesterday. The funeral will be held at his late residence, 42 Webster street, at 8:30 o'clock this morning and from St. Mary's church at 9 o'clock."

The blocks used in it's construction, instead of being brick or stone, were made of layers of compressed pa per joined with silicious cement.

 Professor Preece recommends as among the essentials to be observed in attaching light ming conductors to houses that there should be no joint, unless it be well sol dered one. Chain-link rods, braided rope, tubing, etc., are to be avoided. The ground connection must be sound and good. Each conductor, if there be more than one, should have separate ground connection, but are also to be connected together, also connected with the lead roofing and all masses Of metal in their neighborhood. It is, he says, not necessary to insulate these conductors, and there should be no points or acute angles in the conductor-the straighte- and more di- rect it's course to the earth the better. Tel egraph wire, one-fourth of an inch in diameter, is claimed to be superior for this purpose, and is largely employed in Eng land.

 St. Marys church was crowded yesterday morning, the large assemblage having gath cred to attend the concluding funeral ser vices over the remains of Rev. E. J. O'Brien It was very fitting that after the services in Hartford (which, as reported yesterday, were attended by so many people and clergymen) services should be held at St. Mary's, which he helped to found, and owing to his long pastor ate of St. Mary's, covering more than quarter of century. The older Catholics of this city well remember him when pastor here and retain high respect for his talents and use fitness. The display of flowers at St. Mary's yesterday was very beautiful sight. They were displayed near the catafa1que in which reposed the remains of the deceased. The solemnities of the scene in the church will be long remembered by the people present, and many eyes were dimmed with tears and spoke of loving regard for the dead pastor and friend. The mass, which was be- gun at 10 o'clock, was celebrated by Rev. MT. Lawlor of St. Mary's celebrant, Rev. MT. Fin negan of Providence deacon, Rev. MT. Lenahan of Hartford sub-deacon, Rev. MT.

The text was, Behold 8 great priest who in his day pleased God and was found just. /"" The speaker eloquently spoke of tae changes which had elapsed in this growing city, among the flock over which the deceased had spiritual charge, since seven teen years ago when the speaker paid his last visit to St. Mary's church prior to his visit of yesterday. But to-day the people mourned for him as one, for his work was remember ed and not forgotten:

 The speaker paid further tribute to the life record and work of the deceased and spoke with deep feeling of the decay of his po""Clo SoASCdOCAiO uPOiA eiO HUI iCooo OA yoGAo and failure of his health. He closed with fine peroratien.

 After the discourse the audience were giv- en the last look at the face of the deceased. The body was clad in purple vestments. While the people were passing by the casket James Kivlan sang 'tPity, Oh Saviour"" The plate on the casket had this inscription: ""Rev. E. J. OBrien, died July 27, 1885, aged 65 years"" The several floral pieces had to be carried to one side while the parishioners were filing by the bier. One of these floral tributes cross from relatives of the deceased. The Scapular society of St. Mary's church presented an open mass book made of flowers. It was one of the finest offerings. The inscription upon the design was as follows: ""Thou art priest forever"" A handsome cross came from the parishion- CTS of St. Joseph's cathedral in Hartford

 The choir of the church had 8 number of voices from other choirs with it, and the vo- cal and instrumental music was unusually excellent. The interment was in St. Bernard's cemetery. Many priests and people accom- panied the remains to their last resting place."

How the Boys Provisioned the Army.",,"


To THE EDITOR: Your paper has for years
| afforded the veteran soldier great solace and
satisfaction in the perusal OF war anecdotes and
| ""reminiscences. The recital of the campaigns
and battles of the rebellion goes a great way
| toward strengthening our recollections of those
| trying times Gen. o. o. Howards recently
! published accounts of movements in which he
| participated are instructive, and | wish that
more like them were s0wn broadcast over the
| land as The TRIBUNE has disseminated these.
Shermans march, with its excitiDgly inter
estipg episodes, has been written and rewritten
| Of but the ""true inwardnesS of his brilliant
| march through the Carolinas has never been
| sufficiently exalted by the ""glimmering touch
of the artists pencil"" and / write this more to
| wake up the surviving "" Bummers"" of Sher-
mans army than for the purpose of chronicling
an incident that came under my observation,
and was much commented upon by officers and
men of Pap"" WilliamS's Old First (Red Starr
Division of the Tenth Corps.


| When it is remembered that Sherman's army
consisted of $4,000 men, and that they, with the
horses and mules, were almost wholly subslsted
by the efforts of ID or 30 men detailed from each


regiment, it will be seen that the life of the
| hummer during the so days journey through
! South and North Carolina was an energetic one
at least, if the much-abused fellows did occa-
sionally have to plumber. But they taught the
hot-blooded people of impetuous South Carolina





cal manner how to put down rebellion by max
| ing war terrible, which could be done in no
better way than to vigorously strike at their
! 'breadbasket'


From every regiment, upon the arrival of the
army at the Branchvile Railroad which ran
from Charleston to Augusta. Ga, were detailed
from 10 to 40 men, with orders to mount them
selves as best they could and devote themselves
to securing the country on the tlanks of the
| advancing columns for food, forage, cattle, and
| plunder generally.


The Twentieth Corps commanded by Gen.
5. s. Williams, splendid General and a native
! Of Michigan, was the first to equip its bum
mers; some had horses furnished them, and
others got them as best they could. Kilpat
| rick cavalry gathered in many horse or
| mule that had been left in an exposed condi-
| tion during the night The writer procured
his mule from Kllpatrick's wagon train on the
night of our arrival at the BranchVille Rail
road running between Augusta and Charles
| ton. At first all of the regiments were not
represented, but before many days every COM
mand in the entire army had its band of bum
mers. Each regiment acted on its own hook
and had only one regulation to observe, and
that was to take its regular turn in the advance.


Each corps consisted of three divisions, and these
had to 20 to the right in the advance on alter
nate days, beginning with JackSon's First Dl-
vision. And woe unto squad of another
division who gained the advance on day
when it was not its turn When caught in
| such a proceeding the commanding General
| who was entitled to the advance would sum-
| marily arrest tho disobedient bummers, dis
| mount them and confiscatc the plunder.
/ remember the day of our arrival at Fay
ettevillc, n. C., when ~ bummers of the First
Division, Twentieth Corps, drove the rebels
from the town and across Cape Fear River,
taking possession and securing vast quantity
of -four, meal, meat and tobacco. This day
the Second Division. bluff old Gen Geary in
command, had the right to the road"" and
when he came up and found the condition of
affairs, and realizing that the honor of captur-
ing Fayetteville, with all its glory and plumber,
had been nsidiOusly appropriated hy the in
significant AZ Red Star bummers, his wrath
knew no bounds. He sent for the commanding
officer, and was answered that there vas
commissioned d officer there-that tee men were
composed of bummers from the 9th Ind. and
18th n. j., and that Hoosier-Jerseyman
named Hi Hand. of the 18th, was running
the thing"" The staff officer hunted up the
cheeky Hand, who had heretofore considered
himself equal to almost any emergency, and
was looked upon as sort of plnmed knight by
the men of the expedition. The General sent
for him to report at headquarters, whittier the
do-as you'll please Hand went, and after some
little time was ushered into the terrible pres
once of the mighty Geary.


What is your regiment, and by whose au-
tbority do you presume to dis0bey orders in
the manner you have done in advancing upon
this place. thus laying yourself liable TO cap
ture and deaIh?""


The culprit was temporarily paralyzed by
the manner and substance of Geary's reception.
But he readily recovered and told the Gen
eral that he and his comrades had not seen their
division for II days; had been down on Lynch's
Creek, plundering the people, converting the
natives educating the negroes, and making
o 4o1I fI,nt
outside Of the stores which they had captured
on the retreat of the rebs from Fayetteville, he
had 10 men running large grist mill at Rock
Creek, six miles from there, and that he had
80 wagon-loads of bacon and meal, 40 horses,
and 1900 negroes, which he would turn over
to the proper officer in due time, and that he
really must be off, as he had letter-diary of
the trip from Savannah which he wanted to
send TO the New York Times by the first con-
veyance. According TO a staff officers account,
who was present on the occasion, "" The brave
old General was paralyzed; he was dumb
founded. What was to be done? 1t would not
do to compliment the 20 year old boy. and still
he had proven himself the most successful for
ager in the command"" Suffice to say, Gcary
released the brave and reckless 42 bummers,
and bade them report to their command Be-
fore leaving, Hand exchanged horses surrepti-
tiously with Geary's Adjutant General, and
Joined his command, a veritable hero in the
eyes OF OInccrS ana men.


The advance from Fayetteville to Godsbor-
ough was impeded by rebels and foraging was
discontinued for the reasons that it was unsafe
and the country had become so barren that
there was nothing TO plumber. But all Of this
vast army Of bummers participated in the bat
ties OF March 10 and 19 and proved themselves
as brave aud dutiful III the ranks as they were
adventurous and successful on the flanks""


What has become of poor Hand | do not
positively know, though know his account of
Sherman's march was published in the New
York Times, and that il was the rst newspaper
tidingS received in the North Of Sherman's
march from Savannah to Fayetteville. He
went West after the war, became an editor and
Mayor of city in Kansas, but his love OF
whisky and adventure led him to abandon
business, neglect his family, and finally fall in
with the grand army Of dissolute printers
which have infested the country since G
war. Brave, genial, intelligent, educated
without his "" besetting sin "" Hi Hand would
have long ere this ranked as man among men
in any community or State.


j have no doubt every regimental squad of
bummers had one like Hand. and to them,
more than any other agency, does Gen. Sher-
man to this day credit his success in pro-
visioning his army during the memorable
march through the Caroinas. Perhaps some
of the boys can recite more ""reminiscences like
this. And if So can't We have them ?-HENRY
C. HARRISON, 9th Indiana "" Bummer""

Crimina Matters.",A Uesperado's Deed.,"CHATTANOOGA Tenn, Sept. 6.-Charles
Williams, disreputable negro, shot and In
eteutly killed street car driver named
Polk Mitchell at o'clock to-day. An hour
before Williams had been elected from the car
for entering In drunken manner, and when
asked for hi, fare refusing to deposit it,
Williams swore he would have revenge, and
followed the car. While the driver was
waiting on switch, Williams walked up and
shot him three times, and then shot twice at
his body in the throes of death. A crowd Of
citizens pursued him, and he was captured a
mile from town and carried to jail. Mitchell
was recently assistant chief Of police and was
very popular. Intense excitement prevails and
the Jail is closely guarded. The sheriff has
taken every precaution to prevent lynching.
A large force of men are keeping guard at the
jail and the local military companies will be
called upon If it is necessary to preserve peace.
The murder was the most brutal and unpro-
voked TINT ever occurred in this city.


A mob of determined men, mostly COM
posed of factory laborers and railroad men,
armed with shotguns and all other kinds of
fre-arms, marched about IL o'clock to the
county jail, followed by several hundred peoo-
pf mttanae snd to at iRS' the s GSn'n'es Il seon
appeared that nothing would deter them, and
ahooting into the crowd by the posse of the
sheriff would certainly result in killing a large
number of people, so nothing was done to
prevent the entrance of the mob, and the
front door of the jail was broken
In. The sheriff would not give up
the keys, and AZ the jail is strong building,
inside of which is complete sheet of half
inch boiler iron and entrances of the latest
improved and most secure manufacture, the
mob had hard time etfecting an entrance.
For an hour they have been battering at the
iron doors.


At midnight report Of q pis-.
tol caused fusilade from o number of
shot guns and rifles, and it is reported that
white man and negro have been shot but
how seriously cannot be learned. 1t will take
sometime for the mob to get at the prisoner,
but he will be hanged before daylight.


The mob is in the bsst Of spirits and or
derly. They even stated to the mill tarv that
If they would show their authority from the
governor, which they had not, they would dis
perse.


LArRR.-At 1916 a. m. the negro was hung
to rafter in the jail in most thorough and
Systematic manner. He was taken from the
cell and carried up stairs, when his hands and
feet were securely tied. A block was tied to
his feet the lynchers lifted HIM up, and
dropped him, aud he strangled to death in
three minutes. Not shot was fired by the
military, and all is now quiet."

gagged IN a game of poker IN a freight car.
One accused another of cheating and rose

mistake. When the detective asked
Jem Davies to watch the lawn, he never
suspected that the clergyman was the
villain who had been concerned in that
explosion. But Davies, man of few
ideas and full of his own wrong, took
for granted, as such minds will, that
the policeman would not have spoken
to him if this had not been has affair; so
he and his fellows gathered about the
steps and watched the drawing-room.
They caught glimpse of Monckton,
but that only puzzled them. His ap-
pearance was inconsistent with the only
description they had got-in fact op-
posed to it. 1t was Grace CliffOrd's de-
nunciation, trumpet-tongued, that let
loose savage justice on the villain.
Never was woman's voice so fatal, or
so swift to slay. She would have un-
done her work. The fury she had
launched she could not recall. AS for
BARLEY, words can hardly describe his
abject terror. He crouched, he shiver-
ed, he moaned, he almost swooned; and
long after it was all over he was found
crouched in corner of the little room,
and his very reason appeared to be
shaken. Judge Lynch had passed him.
but too near. The freezing shadow of
RelrlDuUlOn chilled nm.


Colonel Clifford looked at him with
contemptu0us pity, and sent him home
With John Baker in close carriage.


Lucy Monckton was in the parlor of
the Dun Cow waiting for her master.
The detectives and some outdoor SER
wants of Clifford Hall brought short
ladder and paillasses, and something
nnNGrnd 70 lD
Lucy saw, but die not suspect the truth.


They had murmured consultation
with the landlady. During this Mark
Waddy came down, and there was some
more whispering, and soon the battered
body was taken up to Mark Waddy's
room and deposited ON his bed. The
detectives retired to consult, and Wad-
dy had to break the calamity to Mrs.
Monckton. He did this as well as he
could; but it little matters how such
blows are struck. Her agony was great,
and greater when she saw him, for she
resisted entirely all attempts to keep
her from him. She installed herself at
once as his nurse, and Mark Waddy re-
tired to garret.


A surgeon came by Colonel Clifford's
order and examined Monckton's bruis-
ed body, and shook his head. He re-
ported that there were no bones broken.
but there were probably grave internal
injuries. These, however, he could not
specify at present, since there was no
sensibility in the body; so pressure on
the injured parts elected no groans. He
prescribed egg and brandy in small
quantities, and showed Mrs. Monckton
how to administer it to a patient in that
desperate condition.


His last word was in private to Wad-
dy. IF he ever speaks again. or even
groans aloud, send for me. Otherwise

Some hours afterWard Colonel Cliff
ford called as magistrate to see if the
suffer had any deposition to make But
he was mute, and his eyes fixed.


AS Colonel Clifford returned, one of
the detectives accOsted him and asked
him for warrant to arrest him.


Not in his present condition."" said
Colonel Clifford, rather superciliously.
""And pray, sir, why did not you inter
fere sooner and prevent this lawless
act?""


""Well, sir, unfortunately We were on
the other side of the house.""


Exactly; you had orders to be in one
place, so you must be in another. See
the consequence. The honest men have
put themselves in the wrong, and this
fellow in the right. He will die sort
of victim, with his guilt suspected only,
not proved"""

Ten Miners Killed.",,"SILVER CLIFF, Col, Nov. 14.-The ex-
plosion of box of giant powder IN the
boiler room at Bull Domingo at o'clock
last evening. set fire to the building and in
a few minutes the entire shaft-houSe and
hOiSting works were burned to the ground.
The mine timbers were set on ire and
number of men who were at work on the
lower levels are in great peril The en-
gineer and several others in the building at
the time of the explosion were slightly in
jured, but none seriously. All debris has
been removed from around the mouth
of the shaft and the fire in the
shaft timbers near the surface eXtinguished.
Foreman Armstrong was let down to the
Northumberland d-tifty-foot level. and found
ten men, all dead. Five of them had
climbed eighteen feet from the bottom OF
the shaft to the drift, and their dead bodies
We're found III the mouth of the drift. The
other five had died at drills in the face of
the drift. At p. IN. one or the dead bod
les had been lifted to the surface. The 9th
ers will all be raised as soon as possible.
The following men were the


IMPRISONED MINERS:


Con Nourse, H. Westfall, Elmer Hester, D.
W Patton, NJ. De GroSslier, NJ. Lapont,
John La Sue, George Smith, William Strong
and NJ. BaptiSta.


Three OF the dead men leave families here.
One was engaged to be married next week.
The superintendent was not injured and
much indignation is felt toward him. There
is strong talk OF lynching by the indignant
miners, who accuse him of criminal negli-
gence in keeping giant powder in the boiler
room. 1t seems now that the lire origi-
mated in the roof of the building, and por
ton of the burning roof fell into the boiler
room on the powder, which exploded, burst
ing hole in the boiler, and diSlocating the
machinery so that everything stopped at
once, but the men could have been
drawn from the mine if the
machinery could have been kept running.
Notwithstanding the building was on lire,
no one was seriously injured by the explo-
sion, but the engineer and several others were
stunned and bruised. Engineer Chamber
lain was standing at his engine trying to
make it work when surrounded by flames
and was carried away by force by friends.
Hundreds of citizens of Silver Cliff Rosita
and Querida worked all night last night and
all day endeavorng to rescue the miners,
and hundreds are there now helping to get
the bodies out of the mine. Everything is
done by hand. The sad calamity has cast
a gloom over the whole community such as
was never known before."

The bearing of the American people in the scenes

was admirable 1t the more remarkable since
the campaign had been one of rancorous defamation



judgment and sef-pOssession of the people carried
them easily through crisis which in France would
have ended in revolution and b0odshed. The
notorious fact that Mr.. Cleveland had been elected
only by the suppression of the negro vote in tho

with Illinois tie and left in doubt, the roll will
stand Republicans, Il; Democrats. b. In the
next House tho Republicans will have 14l members
in place of 49, and the Democrats ISL in place OF

renewal of tariff agitation.


NEW COMMERCIAL POLICY.


The political canvass not only interrupted tho
natural course of business. but created general un-
easness on the subject of tine tariff and the
economic consequences of Democratic success.
This depressing influence has not passed away since
the election. The report OF the Secretary OF the
Treasury betokening free trade tel TENDENCIES os n
mercial treaties announced in the Presidents Ness-
age has added to the uncertainty The most i'm.
portant of these treaties proposes reduction ot
from y25 100000 to 3j,000.000 in revenue by the
importation of free and tobacco at lower rates
in American or. Spanish bottoms from Cuba and
Porto Rico in return for fayors supposed TO be re-
cprocal extended to exports from the United States
to Cuba. This treaty will have important effects
upon American manufactures OF tobacco ana tne
production and refining of sugar, which cannot
easily be calculated. smilari treaty has been
concluded with Santo Domingo. The commercial
treaty with Mexico ratified by the Senate last
March, still awaits tariff legislation by Congress to
be rendered effective. The Presidents Message ad-
vOcated the extension OF american trade by treaties
of this kind. the establishment OF the consular
service on a salaried footing the development of q
steam carrying marine aud uniform currency basis
for this continent. \ treaty far more starting IN
its provisions Is that concluded with Nicaragua,
whereby the United States Government contracts
to huild an interOceanlc canal ana 10 dclsDu tho
territory through which 1t passes. These treaties
have diverted public attention from Congress since
the opening OF the session. II either the canai Do
undertaken or commercial reciprocity with Mexico
Cuba aud South American countries be sanctioned
the surplus revenues of the Government VIII be abb
sorbed and Of the Democratic arguments ll
favor Of tariff tinkering will lose ITS force. Thai
surplus for the next fiscal year is estimated al
$39, 100000.

 Professor Brewer presided at the regular weekly meeting of the Board of Health held last evening. A communication was read from George W. Mal6by complaining that all the sewer gas coming from the Dwight street skating rink comes out of a conductor about as high as his front door and about three feet from the latter, and is very bad for the health of his family. The matter was referred to Inspector Jackson to see if the sewer was properly trapped as is ordered by the Board of Health and report at next meeting.

 Thomas Lynch and two other men, who reside on East street near the corner of Wooster street, appeared before the Board and complained that the people in that part of the city could hardly stand the steam and smell of burnt rubber that comes from the manhole on the corner of Wooster and East streets, and is supposed to come from the Rubber shop nearly two blocks away.

 Health Officer Lindsley reported that he had visited the place and found the smell very bad, and when he paid a visit to the Rubber shop MT. Hotchkiss did not deny that the smell came from the shop, but he said that he did not turn steam into the sewer but admitted turning hot water into it.

 The matter was referred to the Board of Public Works to see what rule they had about letting hot water into the sewer.

FINDING THE PRISONER GUILTY OF MURDER IN THE


SECOND DEGREE.


TOMS RIVER, n j., Feb. 2S.-The jury in the
Wainwright murder trial have rendered a verdict
against Rockwell Of murder in the second degree
Mrs. Wainwright, her daughter and two were
acquitted. Rockwell showed no emotion whatever
when the jury rendered the verdict. Mary Emma
Wainwright grew very nervous after her acquit-
tai The jury informed Judge Van Syckle, about
$50 a. H., that they desired to see him. Court
was opened and the prisoners were brought in with
anxious faces. Rockwell was pale and stod. The
Judge asked the foreman if the jury had agreed
upon their verdict The answer was in the aftr-
native, and the judge was informed that juror
Clarke would speak for his fellow-ju jurors and for
himself. Rockwell stood up and the clerk asked
what the verdict was. juror Clarke replied: 1--WE
find Elson X. Rockwell guilty of murder in the
second degree-if the court will receive such
verdict""


The Judge ordered the verdict entered. One by
one the Wainwright family faced tue jury and
were acquitted and discharged.


Ex-Judge Hoffman requested delay before the
judgment was entered, and the court took recess
until 9 o'clock At that time Rockwell came into
the court leaning on the arm of deputy-sheriff.
The composure and coolness which have marked
his demeanor did not forsake HIM. Like man who
was prepared for the worst he stood up and faced
the Judge, who said ""YOu have been convict ed,
after prolonged and patient trial, of murder in
the second degree. You have been defended with
an ability and elOquence which, during service Of
sixteen years upon the bench, have not seen ex.
celcd. / do not wish to say anything that Will add
to the pain of the position III which you have
placed yourself. All will say IS that the jury have
taken the most mcrcful view of your case
that they possibly could. Nothing remains to be
done but 10 pronounce upon you the Judgment OF
the law for the offence of which you have been
convicted. The sentence of the law ls and the
court adjudges. that you be committed to the
State prison at hard labor for the term of twenty
years""

verdict is a compromise the last ballot taken out

 Two years ago Governor Sheldon a man who is not an orator, but wht always has something to say worth lis tening to, made an admirable addres on the resources of the southwest ant its possibilities in the future. Tall of such kind is what is needed at congregation of representative peopl, such as that which assembled at th, Albuquerque fair.

 These fairs draw assemblages o people that come from all points o the surrounding discricls for pleasure information and profit, and they come expecting amusement, new ideas, anC possibility of improving their con ditIon by studying the products O men who have subtler brains than themselves.

 In one of these respects the Albu querque fair seems to have been sue cessful. It has given fair exposition ot the resources and industry of the southwest. For this alone the pro jectors are entitled to the thanks oi the southwestern people.

 The exhibits of the resources and handiwork of the Territory were nu. merouS and interesting. Mrs. J, 5. Alb iight's photographic exhibit ga, one of the centers of attraction.

 THE COWBOY T .URNAnENr.

 On Thursday there was gala day for the cowboys. The first cos. puncher to essay the difficult but in. teresting task of roping. tying and riding a broncho, was Francisco Mar tin. Five bronchos belonging to the exhibit of Mir. ToupSsint were turned loose inside the fair enclosure and Martin started for them. John W. Lynch held ,he watch. Martin was successful in his first throv and bid fair to make very qulck time, but un- fortunately for him his rope was not fast to the saddle horn and away dashed the broncho. Several inef, fectual attempts were made to capture the horse, The broncho easily jumped every fence, and despite the efforts oi a dozen cowboys started for the main entrance of the exhibition building. The broncho was finally secured and brought back inside the enclosure. Martin gave up the scheme.

 The second contestant was Dick Greer, of Apache county, Arizona, and, by the by, he was the winner, also getting the prize of so which had been subscribed by the stockmen. Greer caught the broncho by the hind leg, and soon threw him. The sad ding was scientifically done, and in just IaK minutes Greer was riding he bucking broncho around the eIi- closure.

 The third to try the festive bron- cho was Nat Greer, of Arizona. He got his horse in bad shape over near he fence, and after working some ime to saddle him was obliged through severe attack of asthma to give it up.

 The fourth man was Jose B. Lavar. o, who spent some four minutes in ain attempts to lasso one of the black |

For the last week Lynch and his wife have been on a drunk and yesterday afternoon they got to fighting and Daniel went upstairs to stop them, when Lynch became epraged at him and picking up large carving knife which lay on the table1 he rushed at young Malloy and before the latter could get out of the way Lynch stabbed him under the arm. Malloy i'm mediately rushed from the house and. with his hand clasped tightly over the place where he had been stabbed, walked rapidly down Webster street to Dixwel1 avenue and then to Dr. Russell's office on Elm street. Dr. Russell immediately set to work to stop the flow of blood, and having succeeded he ex- amined the wound and found that Malloy had received @ cut about three inches below the left armpit, and about an inch wide and several inches long, extending into the cavity of the chest. The doctor advised the man to go to the hospital, but after his wound had been dressed Malloy changed his mind and proceeded to his home, 82 Canal eAoos 1he Pollce wagon was sent, to WeD- ster street, having been called there by Patrick Malloy, and Lynch and his wife were taken to police headquarters, where they were both charged with drunkenness and Lynch with assault with intent to kill Dr. Russell, thinking Malloys wound might prove fatal, telephoned to Coroner Mix that he had better take Malloy's ante -mortem statement and the coroner visited Malloy at his house, but upon being assured that the latter would recover he left without taking his statement."

made Of the Inauguration OF n double daily
Pullman Buffet and Sleeping Car service be.
tween Washington city aud New Orleans by
the passenger department OF the famous Fled
mont Air Line, which embraces the Virginia
Midland railway and Richmond aud Danville
railroad.


Never before had any transportation line
yentured to offer to the public double daily
service in both directions between the Capital
of the Nation and New Orleans, us the dis
tancc is near twelve hundred miles, but the
Piedmont Air Line, believing the public would
appreciate such facilities, determined to run
two trains daily in each direction between
these cities, with magnificent Pullman Buffet
and Sleeping Cars attached.


The success of this line has been assured,
and the travelling public are rapidly learning
that the Piedmont Air Line ~ the shortest,
quickest, and most comfortable line between
tue cities mentioned.


so universal is this feeling that the cities of
Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York, ms
well as New England, are asking that they bo
allowed to enjoy these facilities, and IN order
to grant this, us well as at the same time per
fecting the facilities from Washington, the
time OF these trains Will be quickened on and
after Sunday, April D.


Trains will leave Washington over tho Vir-
ginia Midland railway at llIj a. N. and l0:i0
p, III. daily, with elegant new Pullman buffet
and sleeping cars attached, running through
to New Orleans without change viz Lynch
burg, DanYllle, CnhflOttc, Atlhulut MOntBOn-
cry, and Mobile, connecting in New Orleans
for all points In Texas aud California.


This route is eghty.iivc miles shorter than
any other, and the schedule Will be the quick.
est offered to the public Train leaving Wash
ington 1910 p. NJ, also takes Pullman sleeper
to Columbia, Aiken Junction, and Augusta
connecting with sleepers TO Savannah and
jacksonville.


These trains reach Washington upon return
trips at 7:55 a. IN. and $50 p. m, making close
T, connection for all points north of Washington.


The Postotlce Department, recognizing that
these trains are the quickest TO and from all
prominent points i'll the south, will take ad-
vantage of them 10 send the fast mails to and
from the south.


The country through which this line passes
Is grand and attractive in every respect


One OF the most active and brilliant passen-
ger men In the SOUTH who is connected with
another line, IN speaking of the Virginia Mid
land railway, says


at is the natural and proper outlet of that
huge volume of travel which the Baltimore
and Ohio and the Pennsylvania railroads pour
into Washington city. II Is the short line par
excellence of travel trGflc from north to south,
and vice versa""


The Piedmont Air Line has become one OF
the greatest passenger Lines in this country,
and will continue IN the favor of the public"

 HACKBERRY, Arizona, Nov. 12- | Thinking you would be pleased to hear | from Mojave county and its dolngs propose after a long silence to punish yOu and your readers once more. Never since IS75 has the county bad such a prosperous outlook. John Me- kenZie, our ex-recorder, has a lease on extension of the old-time and famous Blackberry mine. He has but five men at work at present, but shipped a full car load of fine rich ore to klDgman to- | day. Mckenzie also has lease extend ing until May lst on the Cupel at Stock | ton Hill. If all rumOrs are true John will yet be one of the bonanza kings of AriZOna, but he IS sure to be always the same John for all that.

 Andy Waterbury also has 8 nice thing near the old Hackbury null and makes regular shipments of ore.

 It is said that Charley Moon has made one of the greatest strikes in the country not far from Waterbury's place. There is still good body of ore ID sight at the Crescent, and Miller Nil- hams are making 1t show up In tine style.

 For specimen ore Musis mountain has been acknowledged as the boss camp. The veins are small, but have sampled as high as S3,CC0 and $5,CIO.

 Because of the shooting atfr6y which happened there oD November 2nd, most of the work m Thompson, Dauer k Hitchcock's camp, have come to close. Your readers have been told of thIs shooting, but the result of the examina- tion of Dauer and Hitchcock ou the frs, charge, that of the murder of Charles Harmon, only closed at kingmsn yester- day. Never since the days of short order hanging in the old town by Judge Lynch, have the people of this community been so much surprised and disgu>ted as at the result of this exsmipatio Hitchcock WAS pronounced guilty of murder aLd held to answer to that charge before the grand jury, but was released on Sl,5OO bail. This peaceful and law abiding community have asked themselves ID vain for any law or justles that can be shown for such proceeding, and say II the man was innocent of the charge he should have been set free, but failing to prove him anything but guilty will utNcI CEdcC to hOuuCA MAdb Aut1ACA Oi man justI se Watkins, of kinRman, must he. Prosecuting Attorney Blskeslee, from Mineral Park, Judge Rush of Pres colt; Judge Williams of Mineral Park, and Sheriff Steen have all been In town today. The prisoners, Dauer, and Hitchcock, were tried on the second charge of assault with intent to kill l.. R Thompson on the same day and st thr same place. The case came bef' re Judge Johnson, and resulted III Daurr Hitchcock being held under S2.OO0 each and tO appear before the grand jury. The bal was not forthcoming, and Sherin Steen left with them for Mineral Park, there to make the prisoners safe.

 The good people of Blackberry pro pose to fight hard for the removal of the country seat to this place. They have made the first step and a very impOr tant one, by sinking well for the pub l;c use, and already have a good supply uf water. The county seat must go from Mineral Park, and Blackberry has just the sort of energetic, go ahead peo- pie who propose to have It. This, too. k reasonable. for It is the most central pOInt, and the easiest of access for the stOckmen of the county."

 to suspend work until the difficult,

 was tided over, and instructed Col

 Andrews to suspend the workine

 force but to keep corps of engineer

 in the field to complete the location

 The telegram became known in tn, camp several hours before Col. An drews, who was away with the engi neers, heard of it, and a false con. struction was put upon the telegram, in consequence oi which, when Col. Andrews made the announcement, and with it a proposition to either board the men for work for few days until the money was sent to pay the bills of the Co.,, or continue work as before for wages. The men be. came fuiiods aid refused to listen to reason, and by force of arms and threats of personal violence aud blood. shed, took possession of camp and attempted to make Col. Andrews a prisoner and hold him as hostage un- til the money came. He promptly telegraphed to the President at St. Paul 10 forward him the mon. ey at once to pay the laborers, and showed by his efforts that he was as anxious to have the men paid as they were themselves. When his pay rolls were made out and his several tele- grams and letters were completed, Col. Andrews ordered his horse to go to the station to forward them, when to his surprise the whole body of men, armed with shot-guns and pistols barred his passage and at. tempt to leave camp before the money came, one of them going so far as to propose rope and tree. Col. Andrews then quietly sent his foreman, Mir. J. E. Anderson, to Ash Fork, where he fortunately met Sher- iif Mulycnon and they together with Deputy Sheriff Oliver, took the train for the camp, and now instead of Andrews being prisoner in camp, the deputy sheriff is holding the men in subjection with the aid of the as 'istance ot Messrs. Anderson, Colgan md Lynch. In our interview with Col. Andrews he assured us that the | ren would be paid and that Major Wilson was even now on the way to Chino with the money to pay all bills. He added that it was never his inten- ion to desert the men until their wages were paid, and that in giving he orders to suspend work, President Hamilton had no intention of leav- ng the men or bills unpaid, but in he same telegram directed Andrews Q telegraph the amonnt needed and hat Major Wilson would start at once nth the money. Had Mir. Hamil. on been aware of the stringency of UT Territorial laws in the protection { laborers' wages, which are differ nt from those in the East, Mr. An rews assures us that he would not ave ordered suspension of work ntil the money was here to pay the bor bills. And in consequence of UT existing laws the Colonel exceed l his orders by proposing to the en to continue work and then pay culd go on as usual. A large ma iity would have consented were it ot for four or five desperate ring aders, pad characters, who find eir way among good citizens, who ,t only refused to work themselves, It by threats and force of arms pre- 'nted others from working and even reatened to kill mules and horses

Crime-The Murdered Mans Remains


Sent TO Charleston.


Wednesday nights terrible tragedy was
the chief theme of gossip in the city yes
terday. Wherever there was group Of
two or three, and there were many OF
them on the streets, it was a safe wager
that they were discussing the shocking
murder OF the old night clerk OF the Mar
shall mousse.


There was hardly one in five that did
not know W. b. Dawson, either by sight
or personally. The remem rance and
mention of his clever, quiet, peaceaOle
disposition evoked nothing but curses Tor
his slayer. John Walsh.


To NEWS representative who listened
TO a hundi ed comments from as many
different persons. II seemed remarkable,
81 least noticeable, that not single one
expressed the slightest sympathy with
the murderer. II was fortunate for him
that the stout walls and iron bars o: the
jail were between him and the Incensed
citizens.


""Tnere must be another Judge IN this city,
and his name must be Lynch"" grimly OBJ
served one gentleman. The sentiment was
that of manV. Citizens OF the highest
standing spoke out unreservedly and said
that IL lynch law was ever eXcusable IT.
would have been when the excited crowd
thronged around the officers and the prs-
oner IN the front Office Of the hotel the
moment after his Identification.


SAVED FROM LYNCH LAW.


Said one Of tue officers Yesterday, Had
the mob mad brave, determined leader 10
have called out, Come on bOys.' when the
cries Of Lynch him! lynch himn were
raised, they could have taken Walsh and
hung him in spite of u.s.""


Hundreds were heard to regret that
mob law was not resorted to. The reason
undoubtedly was because the crowd was
not absolutely sure that Walsh was the
right man. The fear of lynchng an inno-
cent man was so horrible that the throng
besuated. Those who started the cry
were satisfied Of the prisoners identity
but they were a vefy small part OF the
crowd, and did not nu ,ber dozen. The
prompt removal OF the murderer before
the crowd had time to act saved Walsh's
life.


Walsh was seen by NEWS reporter
yesterday afternoon in the Jail. ""Mur-
derers' row"" is along the east corridor,
and Walsh's cell is No. IA.

LIMA, Peru, July 2O.-The attempt to settle
By arbitration tho political disputes OF this un-
happy and impovcrisbed country has fniled.
and the war will undoubtedly be prolonged.


When Chill conquered Peru Admiral Lynch.
the Irlshman who commanded the Chilian
army. set up Gen. lglesias as provisional
President until the paciGcatio OF the coun-
try"" Gen. Caceres who commanded divis-
ion OF monteros."" or mountaineers. refused to
surrender. and rejected the terms Of peace die
tated BY Chilli. He retired to the Andes. and car
ried on guerrilla warfare rs long as the Chilian
army was In Peru. When Lynch and his To-
eions retired. Cnceres turned his attention to
the Government with the aliterative title.
which the Chiians left In Lima. and for three
years has kept 1glesias busy defending the coast
and the capital from his assaults. Business is
almost entirely suspended: commerce Is stag
nant. because Poruvians are producing moth
ing and have no money to nay for imported
goods. The people are living on the pawn
shops. and tho Government. deprived OF Its
revenues. is resorting to extreme cohscrlption
and con1scation measures. Caceres hovers
around with an army OF Indian Ruerrillas. doing
little fighting but producing terror everywhere
Ielesias has no force to suppress his rival and
| can only defend the capital and CHIEF seaports
against attack.


Some weeks ago the business community.
seeing nothing but perpetual war and final
| ruin In prospect. attempted reconciliation
between the Two leaders. and eent Commis-
| sion to Caceres to SEQ what he would agree
to. The mountain General listened attentively
| TO the propositions and the advice OF the Com

of Baltimore County, Nd, has been taken
from jail at Towsontown by an ire
sponsible mob and hanged. Hts crime
in the assault upon Miss Gray was OF
= dastardly and foul character, but
he was arrested for 1t, tried for 1t, con-
victed for 1t and was under ser tence OF
death for 1t, and there is no doubt In
the world that he would have suffered
the full penalty. Under these circum-
stances there is no excuse whatever for
his lynching. Had he been taken OIL
sum m arily before the trial, for fear he
might escape through some loophole OF
the law, the case would not have looked
80 bad. But there was no justit cation
whatever for the lynchtng Of Cooper,
and the mob that took his life make
their pretended devotion to the cause
of law and order only an excuse for
perhaps only qualification OF a
spirit of possibly to CRAFTY q
morbid feeling to zee a guilty wretch
dauple at .he end of the rope Poss- bly,
| such ereusable acts of violence may
deter and prevent crime, but while
| this one act in particular has put An
| end to one law breaker, it has made
| seventy-fve other law breakers, foi
every man who participated IN the
lyn ching is . violator of the laws o


Maryland, and If the authorities o'
Baltimore County do their duty, they


will not rest until they have brought
Cooper lynchers to Justica. For the


crime that Cooper committed. his pun
ishment was not too severe, but it should


have been administered by the handi


of the States officers, and not oy th'


hands OF an irresponsible mob.


The circumstan GO, however, does no


90 without good effect, though in th'


present case it was unjusti6able. II


speaks out in accents louder thar


words that these guilty fends. wors
than beasts of prey who prowl arount

regard for Civil Service reform, and more acts
in hostility to that reform. Hero are more
empty words to dclude the people, and at the
same time more vicious deeds to dcbase the
service to the uses of disloyal party. For
what can be more dislOyal than to strive to de-
feat a law while charged with its enforcement
and pretending to enfOrccitf The latest pretence
is that Mr.. Cleveland does not want ""a clean
sweep"" and would not desire if he could to put
his partisans into the Offices, because he sees
that it would not pay. 1t would help the Re-
publicans, we are told, more than the Demo
Gratis. That is the truth, but it would be found
impossible to put that idea into Democratic
head, even by surgical operation.


So this President is wise and wants to do
well, but he has wicked partners. He is max
ing removals only where he comes across q
srascal or an offensive partisan"" That is
the pretence. What ace the factsf Take only
those mentioned in the dispatches of IA single
day or two. In Mississippi two Postmastcrs
have just been appointed. Holmes at Natchez
is rewarded for robbing l,4O0 voters in one
county of their rights, and thus defeating Mr..
Lynch for Congress. Shannon, an editor at
Meridian. is known only to the public for the
vile abuse of General Grant which is found in
his sheet. These are partisans Of the most
offensive sort, and they are rewarded for it be-
fore all the world. Decent and experienced
men are removed, and the only pretcnce is that
they were par,isans. So in Ohio, where the
daily sweeping out Of competent and worthy
Republican officials goes on. and uplifts the
hopes Of Democratic politicians, and just this
use of power to help that party was promised
weeks ago by Cleveland to Hoadly. Yet these
things, We dre told, are the work of Post
master General Villas; not of President Clcvc-
land. Villas is partisan, and he wants to put
his partisans in power. In short, he is the
wicked partner. Mr.. Cleveland, poor man,
cannot help himself.


SO Secretary Manning puts in creatures like
Pillsbury, who is rewarded for stealing the
State of Maine. and like Higgins. who is re-
warded for vote.swindllng in Maryland. lie"

ALL ABOUT KANSAS.


FRIEEDs THE CLUE: In reply to many would
ssy that Kansas, unlike most OF the Prairie States
is not a level country. The streams run through
valleys varying in width from a few rods to three
or four miles. The land from most of the valleys
gently rises to the high praries These praries
invariably rolling. though in many cases scarcely
percepiibie, and very prolific. The climate is far
more healthy than States in the same latitude east
The Winters milder. Owing to remotcness
from the sea, also the altitude, the atmosphere is
dryer. Ofwater there is an abundance in running
streams, springs and wells The most depend on
wells, which are easily got. They stand without
curbing walls. There Is Solid bed of water at
depth OF eight to sixty feet, owing to the hight OF
the land. the water is all level. Well water
Is considered preferable for stock, ii is warmer
In Winter, cooler in Summer, and not bothered with
flies and mosquitoes. There is some timber that
has been set out several years ago tree claims,
but we have timber enough for all the posts
require Any kinds OF timber do we'll here. but
the cottonwood is preferred, because ii grows from
cuttings, and grows fast. The soil is mostly of
deep, RICH sandy loan. There is not one acre in
500 but what can be brought into cultivation. In
dustries well represented. We have fine farmers
and also stockraiscrs. The majority of professions
and trsdes-infa all excepttbeiaw and medicine
can be probably followed here. Not that there is
cali for their services, but very little, Kansas
Is a healthy and law-abiding State. ANY amount
of land can be bought but there is no Government
land in this County, but in Pratt, Harper. Ford,
Finney and other Of tie Southwestern Counties.
Decided and unimproved land Is from s3 10 Si0 per
acre, according 10 location Decided and improved
land at from $ TO SO. according to location and
improvements We have plenty Of churches of all
denominations and the best of schools. Teachers
wages are from $50 up, and teachers must be edu-
Gated for we wish our young and rising generation
of this State TO be able to compete with any of
Eastern States-Addie B. Taylor, Arlington, Kan.

 San Francisco, Dec. l9.-AssociateC

 press Yokohama advices give particular

 of the arrest of Calvin Pratt, a forge

 who secured about fourteen thousand

 dollars from the Pacific bank of Sar

 Francisco, and who IS wanted in Denver

 for similar offence. He was arrested

 as soon as he placed foot ashore at Yok-

 ahama. He was readily identified from

 the description forwarded by Chief of

 Police Crowley of San Francisco. The

 day after his capture he was examined

 before Japanese public prosecutor, but

 refused to answer any questions except

 to sGy that his name was Philip Chet-

 wind. notwithstanding the fact that he

 travelled under the name of John Moran.

 In the hand valise which he carried was found a medal in which the initials .C. 1"" were inscribed. A second examinR- ton was to be held Dec. ,, when the prisoners baggage, in which money was supposed to be hidden, would be opened.

 A. DavydOn, Russian minister to Ja- pan, died in Tokio Dec. 3d from apo plexy. Among the funeral cortege were two regiments of the Japanese Imperial guard, in accordance with a special order from the Emperor.

 San Francisco, Dec. 19.-The case of Jung An Lung, on appeal from the U- ;. district court to She U. s, circuit court, was submitted to Judge Sawyer this afternoon. Lung was a former res ident of this country, but left for China after having obtained return certificate which he claimed was stolen from him in China. Subsequently he returned here, ard a writ of hRbeas corpus was sued out in his behalf in the U. $. district court. The district attorney intervened and denied the jurisdiction of the court on three grounds: first, the Chinaman was not restrained of his liberty, because be could go any where in the world ex- cept the United States; second, all such cases come under the jurisdiction of the port collector; third, secondary evidence relating to the Chinaman's prior resi- dence was inadmissIble when the law prescribes the certificate as the sole means uf identification. The plea was overruled by U. s. District Judge Hoff man, and Judge Sawyer today affirmed the judgment of the lower court. He concluded the decision by saying: ""In order to present all these points and ob- tain ruling on them l shall sustain Judge Hoffman anu let the case go to the supreme court on these points"" District Attorney Hi.born immediately gave notice of appeal. This is a case on which much congressional anti Chinese legislation will depend: hence it is con- sidered of great importance.

 Wikesbarre, Pa, Dec. 19.--It IS defi- nitely decided that the accident at slope No. l, Susquehanna Coal Co.,, at Nanti- coke, was caused by the caving in of roof and the rushing in of large body of water which had accumulated on the surface from natural drainage. This water brought with it a vast quantity of coal dirt, which blocked gangways and passages, and cut of the escape of number of men in the upper left. The cave was caused by a blast. Of the men now in the whether they are alive or dead cannot be told. If they have been able to obtain fresh air they are undoubtedly alive and there is good hope of recovering them. Measures for the relief of those still in the mine were begun as soon as the other men had been brought to the surface. Two gange of men wero set to work excavat- ing from different points to where it is believed the men are imprisoned. A party, 50 strong, commenced work from the foot of the air shafts. This is the nearest point to the place where the men are, but great difficulties are encountered. The rescuers are working with the great est possible energy tonight; the gangs are relieved every few hours and sixty men have been constantly at work since last evening at 6 o'clock. This evening it was believed they had penetrated to within 90 or 60 feet of where the i'm prisoned men are. Another party are working from the direction of the slope towards the same point. They have far ther to go but have better facilities. There is little ground for hope, but the efforts will not be abandoned until the fate of the imprisoned men is determin- ed. Officials of the company state that there are 2i men in the fatal slope, not % as IS generally understood. They say further, the disaster was precipitated by the collapse of the passage way of the tunnel to the extent of , feet, caus- ing depression which brought down into the tunnel 20 foot vein of lake quick sand. By the vacuum created by this depression, and through heavy tissure Tn the roof mass of culm esti- mated at 50,OO0 tons with contents of pond oi water over head containing over 2O,00O,000 gallons of water poured in flooding both No. and ? slopes and choking up the tunnel and carrying with 1t 52 miners who were at work there. Of these men 24 were, in all probability, caught before they could gain the chambers that fetched upward, and they are supposed to be in the quick sand and culm.

 -Dr. Wilson has embarked in shoep husbandry. The country has seldom been cleaner swept from wool than now, save few clips in large interior cities and on These latter markets virtually hold all the wool to be supplied until the next clip, and there is little to arrive from foreign ports. It is also said thatsthere will be market for over 10O,OOO,OOO pounds more than our flock masters can supply the com ing season, if times grow any better at all. ""Never can OUT old pastures be redeemed until we go to raising sheep again, nevey,"" said an old farmer in our post-office the other day. So, Wilmington farmers, go in- to the business. There were more dogs in those days when our ancestors made money raising sheep than now. Our New England hill farms are to be restored again, as sure as you live, by somebody, and why not let the old Puritan stock do it as well as foreigners :?

 Rev. Mr. Phillips left for Andover last Monday. He held the pastorate of the Baptist church nearly three years, and he and his wife and sister, Miss Esther, leave warm friends here. His successor is not yet decided upon. Rev. Frank Jones who preached here as a candidate one Sunday was much liked, but it is thought circum- stances will prevent his coming here.

The Ysqui troubles prevented an overland trip and a long time was spent in waiting for some means of transportation up the coast to Gusymas, rrln, n,nl. 1r-k of such difficulties it IS hardly to 5e wondered that Mir. Landis is in no hur- ry to start on his return trip until the Yaqui troubles are more definitely set tied.

The Diamond State Rolling Mill as
sociation, composed of employees of the
Diamond State Iron company, of Will
mington Del, had picnic last Satur-
day afternoon at the Exc elsior Park,
kept by Specht s. Sphan, at Fifth and
DUPONT streets. Among those who at
tended was Lewis L. Davis young
man barely 81 years of age"" He was
accompanied by his wife, to whom he
was married seven weeks ago in Chester,
Pa,


About 5 o'clock, Mrs. Davis, finding
that her husband who had been drinking
was disposed to become quarrelsome, in
duced him to start with her for home.
He was not drunk, but in contrary,
fault-fnding mood, and as they came
along all old road leading to Front street,
he asked her why she had not stayed
longer, and danced with him. Wheu
she replied thal she could not dance, he
called her Cd d-n liar, and ac-
cused her of dancing with other men.
At this time he was walking some little
distance ahead of her, and when she told
him that what he said was not true, he
picked up brick and threatened to kill
her.


Davis had red handkerchief around
one of his hands, and he said to the wo-
man that be had lost one of his fingers,
and she replied that it served him right,
as she had told him to leave that thing
at home"" They continued to wrangle
as they walked along, attracting the at
tention of all who saw them, and when
they reached Front street near Broome,
he suddenly pulled pistol from his
pocket aud pointed it at the woman.
She threw up her hauds and begged him
not to shoot, but he paid no attention to
her pleadings, and with the weapon aim
eu dr ectly at her breast snapped it two
OF three Zines, but from some cause it
failed % fire. He then commenced
twisting at the chambers, and the wo-
man ran out Front street


In the meantJme, some one went to
officer Petersou's house on the corner of
tr0nt and SearleS StleeiS, ABOUT nall
square distant. and told him that drunk
en- man was going to shoot woman on
Front street. The officer was just sitting
down TO his supper, but he got up, put
on his coat aud vest. aud against the
wish of his wife went out. AS he went
down Front street he met the woman,
who seized him by the arm and begged
him not to arrest the man, as he was her
husband, at the same time warning him
not to go near, o. he would shoot him.
The officer not having any fear, went up
to Davis, who was standing with the re-
volver in his hand, aud told him that un-
less he gave it up, he would arrest him.


Davis made some reply, and the officer
stepped back few feet. when he fired,
and the ball entered his left breast, pass
ing through his lung aud heart. Peter
son pat his hand to the wound and step
ped back about five yards, when he fell
20 the ground and expired in a few min
utes.


After desperate struggle during
which Davis fired at several persons, he
was arrested and locked up. Public
feeling against him is very bitter and if
it was not for the strong walls of New
Castle Jail he certainly would be lynched."

 B. Shoninger returned from ten days visit at Saratoga last week and is again dom- street. He visited Mt. McGregor last Tues day and stayed there all day. He saw the late General Grant sitting out on the veran- da of his cottage surrounded by several mem bers of his family and his doctors. He said that the general looked very much emaciated and sat in listless attitude, and every one of the visitors felt much sympathy for the old hero and his family.

 Last week was another busy week at the shore. The hotels and boarding houses were overrun with visitors. There are eighty regular boarders at the Hotel Sea View One hundred and twenty-five persons partook of supper there Saturday night. The Beach House is well filed The restaurants did very large business last week in getting up their shore dinners and suppers.

 A large party came down the Canal rail- road last Saturday, consisting of members of Catholic church in Northampton and there were Holyoke people with them. They spent the day at Howes rink and Railroad Grove,

 

 six pieces who took up their quarters at the rink and discoursed enlivening music during the day for the mer- "" throng of skaters and dancers. They left at 5 o'clock well pleased with their treatment. by Landlord Howes and his corps of assis- tants. In the evening there was another large crowd at the rink to witness the match between Dot Bishop and Willie Graham for a ten dollar medal. Graham got the lead and came in 8 lap ahead at the finish. A grand march led by Miss Lillie Emory of Summer street and Lincoln Hayward fol lowed. The interest continues unabated and the best of order is maintained. Tomorrow evening Fred A. Kronan will skate two miles against Edward Hollands running two miles. Wednesday evening there will be double race between John Dodds and a man named Houghton. The picnics booked for the shore for this week so far are: To-day the German Lutheran church, of this city; tomorrow an excursion party from Milldale, Ct.; Wednesday the Knights of St. Patrick, ot New Britain, Landlord Howes caters for them: Saturday, the Caledonians of this city will picnic, and the commercial travellers will have reunion and will dine at the Homestead.

In Plunas County there is fertile
mountain valley IN the heart OF the North
ern Slerras, where for some years Beck
woBrfh, the famous trapper, guide, Indian
chief and frontiersman, lived. The annals
OF western adventure contain no more IN
teFesting figure than swarthy jim Beck
sgourth. the disc0yerer, in 1851. Of this
mountain pass. The writer has met many
persons, army officers and civilians, who
knew BeckwOurth, and has talked with
gold hunters whom this fearless guide led
across the Sisrras in 1851.


Beckwourth was born in Fredericksburg,
Va. in 17Ss. His father had been an officer
in the Revolution. About 1906 the family
removed 20 Missouri and settled twelve
miles below St. Charles, in a region still
called Beckwourth's settlement When
only nineteen years old Jim Beckwourth be-
came the hunter for Colonel r. NJ. John
sons expedition to treat with the Sacs and
Foxes. and work lead mines in the Galena
region. Ii was not long before Beckwourth
joined General Ashley's Rocky Mountain
Fur Company. From 1917 until he started
for California in 1874, his life was a sue
cess on OF hairbreadth escapes, of fortunes
made and lost, and of Indian battles. He
served under Bent and Sublette in the
W est, and with General Jessup during the
Seminole war in Florida He even became
First Counselor of the Crow Nation, and
finally their Head Chief, leading them in
countless forays against the Sioux and
Blackteet. He always protected the per-
sons and property of the whites while he
was the ruler of the Crows. His popularity
with the tribe, whom he ruled with a rod
of iron. was due to his wonderful knowl-
edge of Indian nature and his unsurpassed
moss trooper instincts. He was never so
happy as when in the saddle, leading a war
party by night marches to assault Lipan
or Comanche encampments, or to stampede
their horses and dash away again
like whirlwind. One of the dozen or more
Indian names he had meant, in English,
"" Enemy of Horses""


One of Beckwourth's famous feats was
accomplished about 1922 when he was near
the Snake River trapping beaver. He was
pursued by over two hundred Indians, and
ran all day without food or water, cover
ing it is believed, not less than ninety five
miles before he reached Sublette's Camp.
This feat ranks in the tales of the West
with Bent's famous ride twenty years
later. In 1896, while Beckwourth was in
ST. Louis and was still Chief of the Crows,
had been killed. They at once surrounded
Fort Cass with thousands of warriors to
take immediate vengeance. After much
parley, a truce of three months was
agreed upon until word could be sent to
BeckwOurth TO come and rescue the be-
leaguered fort, which contained 100000
worth Of goods. A trapper named Pappen
was paid II 900 TO deliver the message to
BeckwOurth, and the Crows encamped TO
await results. The fur company paid
Beckwourth 5000 and all expenses to re-
turn at once, and he rode, with two COM
panions, the entire distance in fifty days,
and saved the fort from destruction.


After this he traded in New Mexico, and
In 1874 led an expedition to California,
reaching Los Angeles in January, 1874. He
was one of the most active of the revolu-
tionists of 1916, under General Castro, be-
ing leader of the thirteen American rifle
men who first joined Castro. He was Lieu
tenant of the subsequent corps of 160 which
captured the pueblos of Santa Barbara and
Monterey, defeating Suffers forces. When,
in 1S47, war was declared in Mexico, Beck
wourth and his company of trappers, num-
bering less than dozen, collected over 800
horses in the Los Angeles region, and, start.
ing eastward, reached the Arkansas in
safety. He then carried dispatches from
Fort Leavenworth to Santa Fe and other
points. On one occasion he rode 913 miles
in fifteen DAYS. In 1S4S he returned to
California.


Here he helped to bring TO justice the
perpetrators of the Reed murders near San
Miguel, where a respected English family
and their servants, eleven in all, were
killed. The ranch was twenty five miles
from the nearest house, and Beck
wourth was the person who discovered
+ the deed not an hour after it was COM
mitted. He rode seventy two miles that
/ night, and collected band of forty men,
I 20 whom twenty more were added next
I dav. They separated, and Beckwourth.

the murCerers were killed and the others

shot. After this Beckwourth became a fa-
miliar figure at the gold camps of the
Sierras. from HangtOwn TO Shasta.


Bec<wourth was rather under medium
size. but possessed of great strength and
endurance. He was famous for his vivid

chance in the face of statistics. For
years the Northern papers represented
the average Southerner as man in
slouch hat. 1t took long time to con-
vince them that the Derby and the tall
hat were not altogether unknown in
this section. Southerners were also
shown up as profane sWearers, whisky
drinkers and outlaws. Gradually, how
ever. the country has come to the con-
clusion that there is more lynch law
out West than in the South, and that
the average Southerier does not do
any more swearing than his Northern
brother. AS to whisky drinking, the
fact shows that the South is the most
temperate section in the Union, Mis-
sissippi has $50 saloons; Minnesota,
with about the same population, has
over 5000 saloons; Arkansas has ,344
saloons; California, with about the
same population, has $3.50 saloons; old
Bourbon Kentucky has 4. .461 saloons,

ment may be, in proportion to the pop
luation, the North has twice as many

CHATTANOOGA, TENN, September T.
Charles Williams, disreputable negro,
shot and instantly killed street-car
driver named Polk Mitchell at five O'Clock
yesterday afternoon. An hour before
Williams had been elected from the car
for smoking in the presence of ladies
and refusing to pay his fare. Williams
swore he would have revenge and fol-
lowed the car. While the driver was
waiting on a switch Williams walked
up, shot the driver three times and then
shot twice at the body. crowd of citi-
zens pursued him, and he was captured
mile from town and carried to jail.
Mitchell was recently Assistant Chief Of
Police and was very popular. Intense
excitement prevails, and the Jail is close
ly guarded. The Sheriff has taken every
precaution to prevent lynching and the
military will be called out if necessary.


LYNCHED.


A. M.-The mob moved on the Jail
about eleven O'Clock, and found the
Cadets and Chattanooga Guards on the
alert. The Sheriff would not give up the
keys, and the mob had a hard time ef
fecting an entrance.


They worked for about an hour with
sledges, and even after they got inside it
was not clear sailing, for some one fired
pistol shot which was


FOLLOWED BY FUSILLADE,
in which Ben Palmer, negro, was
killed, and white man wounded. The
mob was made up mostly of railroad
men, and not a 'quiet and determined
throng of people,"" as lynchers are gener-
ally described, but an infuriated mob,
mad for murder.


After they had gained possession of the
Jail, and while searching for the cell oc-
cupied by the murderer, and forcing open
the doors, crowd of negroes rallied and
made move as if to attempt to rescue
their doomed fellow. 1t was at this time
that Ben Palmer was killed.


THE NEGROES DREW OFF,
and the lynchers were complete masters
of the situation. 1t was lust nfteen min
utes before one O'Clock that the murderer
fell into the clutches of his self-appointed





sistance and struggled, but in minute
he was overwhelmed and dragged out
by as many men as could get theii
hands on him. He was taken to the third
story of the Jail and rope was produced.
A heavy stone was fastened to his feet,
and several of the men lifted him up and
dropped him over. The mob then dis.
persed.


CHATTANOOGA, TENN, September u
The excitement over the lynchlng here
Sunday night continues unabated and
rather intensified war between the
negroes and the whites seems imminent.
The militia are under arms. The Sheriff
has twenty five sworn deputies on guard
at the Jail, and extra policemen patrol
the city. Negro leaders have been urging
an attack all day, and the negroes are
said to be collecting.in great numbers on
the outskirts of the city. Rumors are
received at headquarters that an attack
will be made at midnight."

years ago, failed of election TO the legislature

sought TO represent This, following his failure
of 1877, where also Malone and Major Daniel
were defeated, and where began the trouble
that Malone has been able to give the Virginia

not appear dead now, nor did he last
when the ""old ioxes"" OF democracy
thought their combinations had pnt the
Lee name and traditions and the confederate
soldier element out OF Virginia politics. Major
Daniel voiced the same element when he
seconded Fitz Lees nomination OF Withers for
governor twelve years ago. Gen. Payne, of

BARBOUR AND DANIEL.


These gentlemen are the real contestants lor

cratic sentiment OF Virginia They suggest rec

resented upon the supreme Court Of the United
States. For generations the bar and politics Of
Virginia have had as prominent figures MEM

AS TO CLAIMS


| While the Virginia democrat will ind him
self easily content with the election of either
Barbour or Daniel as preservative OF Virginia
traditions, he is perplexed with the claims that
the friends of each assert for his favorte for the
| Senatorship. 1t is conceded that Mr.. Barbour
took charge OF an apparently losing hg ht against
| Malone In 1883, when Malone got his f1rst and
| lasting reverse. The democracy, also under
| Barbours direction, as chairman OF the state
| committee, gave the electoral vote OF Virginia
| to Cleveland a fact not lost sight OF by the ad-
ministration probably. A third success followa
| this year under Barbours management. Bu


meanwhile Major Daniel has been q large part
of all these democratic successes. He was ~


prominent at the Lynchburg convention OF
| 1885, as Mr.. Barbour, probably more SO In the
| work of relieving the democracy Of the handi-
cap Of the debt issue-an issue upon which he
had been beaten tor governor two years

gossip OF the state that he helped TO create the

The efforts to supstantiate the last mentioned report, resulted in positive proof of the ha nging week ago near Headtown, of Frank Morgan. Gill Williams, farmer living near Mud Greek, was suspected and persons de- tailed to watch him. Then it was learned tha, Williams had taken un- lawful possession of another mans horse, and thirty-two determined men visited his house and arrested him. Williams bade his family an affection ate farewell and told them if he did not return in two days they might know he was dead. Williams was then led several miles into some thick timber where they were met by anoth- CT party having in charge Frank Mor- gan and boy named Moore. By unanimous vote the men decided to hang Williams and Morgan. Some contended that by reason of the boys youth that is was best to turn him loose with moderate punishment, but it was finally decided that there were great probabilities of his becom. ing troublesome criminal, that it was better he should die. According ly the three were strung up on one limb. Some of the posse climbed up the limb and pressed their feet upon the shoulders of the criminals in or der that they might die quicker."

Mr.. STERLING, Ky, June 28.-The war in
Rowan county has broken out afresh. For
nearly year there have been constant affrays
between the two factions of Jolivers and

Joliver's friends and there have been since
frequent collisions and several others killed.
Recently Gov. Knott sent a commission to
Morehead, the county seat, who it was sup
posed had adjusted the feud amicably. But
at the town election the other day, Craig
Joliver, brother of the first man killed,
was elected Town Marshall of Morehead.
The leader of the Martins, Cook Humph-
rey, sheriff elect, who had not given his
bond and qualified, came in
Friday and resigned the Office. He then
armed himself and threatened trouble to the
Sheriff who might be appointed. Warrants
were sworn out and put into the hands of
Marshal Joliver. Joliver went to day TO ex-
ecute it. On arriving at the Martin home
stead Joliver told Miss Sue Martin. who met
him, that he wanted Humphrey. No answer
being made he went up stairs to Humphreys
room. When near the door he was fired
upon by Humphreys and dangerously
wounded. Joliver's faction hearing the
news gathered and are beseiging the house.
The Martins are gathering and more
serious fight than any previous is
feared. Troops will be called for.
Tonight Mrs. Martin came out of the house
and was begging the guards to let Hum
phreys escape when Humphreys ahd Ray
burn. another of the faction. made a rush TO
escape. Mrs. Martin siezed the gun of the
guard. but another guard fired killing Ray
burn. Humphreys Ia still at large."

 And Murder Are Common.

 MOUNT STERLING, Ky, June 28.-The war in Rowan county has broken out afresh. For nearly year there have been constant affrays between two factions, the Tollivers and the Martin s. Floyd Tolliver was killed last August by John Martin. Martin was lynched by Tolliver's friends and there have since been frequent collisions and several others killed. Recently Governor Knott sent commission to Morehead, the county seat, which it was supposed had adjusted the feud amicably. But at the town election the other day, Craig Tol1iver, brother of the first man killed, was elected town marshal of Morehead. The leader of the Martins, Cook Humphreys, sherif-elect, who had not given bonds and qualified, came in Friday and resigned the office. He then armed himself and threatened trouble to the sheriff who might be appointed. A warrant was sworn out and put in the hands of Marshal Tolliver. Tolliver went to-day to execute it. On arriving at the Martin, who met him, that he wanted Humphreys. No answer be- ing made he went up stairs to Humph- reys room. When near the door he was fired upon by Humphreys and danger ously wounded The Tollivers faction hear ing the news gathered and are besieging the house. The Martins are gathering and 8 more serious fight than any previ- ous one is feared. Troops will be called for. Tonight Mrs. Mar tin came out of the house and was begging the guards to let Humphreys escape when Humphreys and Rayburn, another oi the faction, made a rush to escape. Mrs Il-- xI.z other guard fired, killing Rayburn. Hum Dhreys is still at large."

 PALESTINE, Tex, June 28.-Sherif Davis of this (Anderson). county yesterday received word from small town called Bells in Gray son county that John Martin, one of the two escaped negroes implicated in the out- rage and murder of Mrs. Hazell at Elkhart, this county, last Saturday night, was taken out Of the calaboose of Bells Friday night and lynched. This makes six victims of Judge Lynch for the murder of Mrs. Hazell. Martin left Eikhart on the night of the mur- der and awakened suspicion by inquiring about the murder on his arrival at Bell. A description of Martin was forwarded to Elk hart and it tallied exactly with the appear ance of the man wanted. On receipt of the description the mob determined to hang him. They broke into the calaboose that night, took him short distance and hanged him."

parcels in the streets have been stopped by the
police and the parcels examined before they
were permitted TO pass on. Approaches to oil
public buildings were also rigidly guarded.
Nobody was allowed to enter without submit
ting to the close esscrutiny. The Tower aud
Parliament houses were surrounded with SEN
tries and extra policemen. Immense crowds
OF people continue to be attracted TO the vicin-
ity OF the Tower and Westminster Hail.


The TWO policemen, Cox and Cole, who were
injured by the explosion in Westminster Hall,
are making favorable progress and hopes are
entertained of their recovery.


A man was arrested yesterday on suspicion
OF being connected with the explosion at the
Tower. He is described as an Irish-American, J,
was Cunningham, with the aliases Gilbert and
Dalton. He had lodged for some months in
the vicinity of the Tower. He had seven
pounds in gold in his pockets.


The excitement and anger kindled by the ex
plosions still continue. A rumor was current
last evening and this morning that Cunning
ham would have hearing today at ths
Thames police court in Arbour street and it
caused the court and streets in the vicinity to
be crowded with excited citizens SO that extra
police had to be placed on duty to keep order.
The feeling against Cunningham is very bit ter
and if the crowd get their hands on him there
ia no doubt he would be lynched.


Shortly after noon it was learned that de-
tectives had arrested another man in connect
ion with the explosions, and he and Cunning
ham would De ARA gaed together. The people
in the vicinity of the Thames police court then
left for Bow street. court.


The suspicious circumstances surrounding
the prisoner were detailed and he was remand
ed until February 3D..


A letter received by the police officials vest
terday ia believed to be very important doc
nment. In addition to other valuable infor-
nation, it states that st. Paul's cathedral and
the office OF the Daily Telegraph are among the
buildings which the dynamiters threaten to
blow up.


The explosion wrenched off the Irish harp
which forms part of the ornamental work on
the panels, and deposited it in the seat of
Parnellite member, while Mr.. Forster's seat
was ripped up. Ofthe gold letters ''V. R.""
on the desk opposite Mr.. Gladstone's seat, the
""V"" was torn away. II now ttanspires that
three-fourths OF the glass roof of the chamber
mad fortunately been removed previous to the
explosie1s. There is much rejoicing over the
fact that the downward force Of the dynamite
failed to reach the gas meter Of the house,
which is directly below the ventilatiDg cham.
Der. The latter was badly, damaged. The
latest inspection shows the damage to have
been much greater than at first reported. Hal
the length of the front opposition bench was
torn away. The magnificent window in the
south OF st. Stephens porch can be restored,
complete copies OF the designs having been
preserved.


Official estimates made by the government
inspectors place the amount OF pecHniary dam
ages wrought by the explosions in Westmin-
ster ball, House of Commons and Tower at
$4,000.


In the council chamber of the Tower of
London whole cases made Of plate glass a
quarter of an inch thick and containing armor,
were shattered by the fierce explosion. The
wall against which the dynamite was placed is
sixteen feet thick, Notwithstanding which the
plastering on the opposite side OF the wall for
radius of several feet was SHAKEN to the floor


The electric lighting office of the House of
Commons and cables were destroyed and the
apparatus rendered unfit for use by the explo-
sion. The post office in the lobby was also de-
stroyed, and several huge blocks of stone four
teen inches in thickness and weighing half a
ton were upheaved. Meetings have been call

he arrived in England during last autumn and
came directly from New York. His pretense
that he was an Englishman was well carried
out for few hours after his arrest, his ap-
pearaDce favoring it and his draWling stam-
mer being peculiarly cockneyish. But in his
excitement under the close crose-sxamination
OF the court he forgot himself for q moment and
spoke rapidly and distinctly as an elocutionist
and clearly demonstrated that his cockneyis m
was clever piece of dissimula lation. 1t was
also shown that the prisoner had been known
in White chapel as Dalton and his statements
that he had lived in Liverpool were entirely
disproved. The court considered that q case
had been made cut against Cunninghom suffic-
1ently strong to warrant his committal and he
was remanded for week to await further ex-
animation. During the proceedings Cunning

going on within the court room. He freaueD Z

DUBLIN, Jan. 26.-The Irish newspapers de-
nouuce the outrage in vigorous terms. The
Fre6man's Journal says only one feeling pre-
walls throughout ireland regarding the fend-
ish crimes and that is deep and earnest svm-
pathy with those who were injured no less than
an earnest wish that the diab1lical authors
may be brought to justice Any man with a
touen OF human feeling must regret the escape
of the miscreants.


AT meeting of Irishmen at Clerkenwell
yesterday, the outrages were denounced as
cruel, cowardly and injurious to Irishmen who
will lose their employment in England in Con-
sequence, and hope was expressed tn at the Of.
tenders would speedily be brought to Justice

causes the heartiest satisfaction that the news
of the outrages has aroused the conscience OF
the American people. The suppression of the
scandal concerns the honor of America much
more than the interests OF England, The
action of the United States Senate is awaited
with interest. Meanwhile MIR. ParneQ vir-
tuousy refuses to contemplate, much less To

crimes. He does not refuse to profit by tteiT
success. Engishmen will not snccumb to the

which caused death.


Edward Warrick testified to seeing the
defendant and deceased. Ho and Smith
had got past when Rollins called to Smith
and asked him something. Smith stopped
at tho corner and Rollins came down to
him. After q conversation Smith started
away and Rollins followed and caught
him by the coat with both hands. Smith
broke away y second time, and Rollins
again caught him. Smith, in attempting *
to get away, threw Rollins on his hands
on tho pavement. He then started of,

money from Smith, who refused to lend
it. Rollins said, III you don't give it to
mo will kick hell out OF you,"" and
kicked at Smith, who told him IL he did
not stop IL would be worse for him. Rol
Inns began kicking, and then Smith
pulled out his knife and cut at him. He
made two or three stabs which did not
cut through the coat, but tho next tim,
went deeper.


Officer Fisher repeated an admission
made by Smith to him that he cut Roll

and Son and Shoots Another Son.


We this week have to chronicle one of
the most terrible homicides that ever oc-
Cured in Cecil county. While on
drunken debauch that had lasted for
weeks, Charles p. Barnes, living near
Battle Swamp Tavern and close to the
village of Woodlawn, in the Seventh dis
trict of this county, shot and instantly
killed his brother in law, Thomas Brown,
and his 15-year-o old son, ]. Arthur Barnes,
and wounded his younger son Earnest.
The shooting occurred about 6 o'clock
last Saturday morning. Barnes is about
40 years of age, and for years he has been
dissipated. He belongs to very respect
able family, and married - years ago
Miss Jennie Toulson, one Of the most es-
teemed young women of the county. He
have prospered but for his passion for
drink. Some months ago he began drink
ing heavily. His wife threatened to take
their five little children and leave him,
when he promised to reform. In short
time he went back to his old ways and
frequently drove his family from the
house. Finally, driven to desperation,
his wife decided, after he had beaten her,
to separate from him permanently, and,
placing some of the children in the care
of relatives, went to Wilmington. Del.


MANNER OF THE TRIPLE CRIME.


Barnes had eaten his breakfast on Sat-
urday morning and was standing in front
of his home on the Port Deposit road
with double barreled breech- loading
shotgun laying upon the rail of the fence
inside the yard when wagon approach
ed bearing his brother-in-law, Thomas
Brown, and James Toulson, his fatherin-
law. As it approached the spot where
he was standing, Barnes stepped toward
it with gun in band and said to Brown,
''Tom, I'm going to shoot you."" Brown
replied, ""Charley, give me chance"" !""
and as he spoke stepped from the wagon
to the road. He faced Barnes, and said
""Oh, Charley, you will never shoot any
body"" and as he (Brown) spoke, Barnes
stepped back two PAGES, put the gun to
his shoulder and fired. The load struck
| Brown in the breast just above the heart,
cutting clear through him. He fell to
| the ground dead


Barnes then started towards the house,
and Mr.. Toulson, the father-in-law of
both of them, left the wagon standing in
the road, and calling Barnes's two boys,
Arthur and Earnest, to follow him, hur-
ried in the direction of Abrahms's store,
two hundred yards away. Barnes, how
ever, stopped the boys and drove them
before him into the house, and as they
entered he gave Arthur, the oldest, a
shove, which-apparently by the sur
soundings, afterwards eXamined-forced
him back against the stove, and while in
this position his inhuman father shot
him, the load stricking him just above
the nose. tearing the whole top of his
head off and scattering his brains all over
the room.


Earnest, the younger, seeing what his
father had done and fearing for his own
life, asked, Papa, you are not gong to
shoot me ?"" and at the same time seeing
his father making preparations to do so,
ran through the kitchen door, Just as
he did so, and while the door was only
partly open, Barnes fired at him. but his
aim was not good, (the load entering the
woodwork of the door) only few grains
of shot striking the boy on the head,
making triliing wounds. Barnes then
cody went up stairs and laid down upon
bed, previously, no doubt, drinking
from demiJohn which was found by the
side of his bed.


Meanwhile, on the outside Mr.. Joseph
Toulinson and farm hand named Kelly,
who were near by, took up the body of
the murdered man Brown, placed it in a
wagon and drove to the residence of DR..
Brown, but the doctor not being at homo
they conveyed it to his late home, and
strange feature of the case was, they car
ried 1t into the house and laid it upon the
floor before letting his wife, who was in
the second story, know anything about
the homicide.


The boy Earnest, after escaping from
his blood thirsty father, ran up the road,
met Cornelius S. Abrams, the postmas-
ter, and cried, ""Save me, save me; papa
has shot Arthur and killed him.


When the affair became known people
collected from all directions, and threats
were made of lynching the murderer.
Word was sent to Sheriff VIM. J. Smith,"

body of the dead boy lying on the floor
They went to the stairway leading to the
upper floor and called for Barnes. Re.
ceiving no answer they went Out into tie
front yard and began firing shots into
| the windows of the second story, but
without eliciting any response. Again
| they entered the house, and going up
stairs found the door of Barnes'S room
| ajar. At first no one could be found
with nerve sufficient to enter the room,
but finally Albert jackson, followed by
E. w. Brown, George Tyson and Cecil
Scott, went in and found Barnes huddled
up on the bed, apparently to avoid the
balls being fired through the windows.
He was very much under the influence
| of liquor-a demijohn, almost emptied of
its contents, being found beside the bed
but he made no resistance, and they
called Constable Waring, who handcuffed
him, and Sheriff Smith arriving about
that time, the murderer was placed in a
carriage and driven to Elkton Jail.


The homicide is attributed to three
causes. Barnes charged his wife with
intimacy with men of the neighborhood,
a suspicion that is universally repudiated;
and another is business envy of Brown,
who some time since engaged in the nay
business in opposition to Barnes. The
other supposed cause is his hard drink
ing, which, it is thought, has unsettled
his mind.


A few weeks ago he threatened TO kill
his wife, and after abusing her he was
arrested and given a hearing before
Squire Stephen Lynch, of Principle, who
bound him over 10 court. 1t was after
this that his wife left him, and, taking
their two little sons, wen to her fathers,
Wilmington. After this he did very well
for time, until by some means or other
the bond of peace given by him before
Squire Lynch was lost or destroyed, when
he soon again fell into his old habits.
The murderer was an excellent buSi
ness man. His occupation was that Of q
machine agent and dealer in hay. Thos
Brown, his older victim, was a respacta.
BILE farmer, with wife and three young
children:


An inquest was held on the bodies Of
the victims later the same morning by
Coroner Isaac R. Taylor, Of Rising Sun
with Drs. Brown, Turner and Crothers
as physicians. The verdict was: ''That
the deceased met their deaths from a gur
in the hands of Charles P. Barnes


The murderer is now in Jail here undel

Remarkable Story Concerning an Attempted


Lynching at Winchester.",,"Remarkable Story Concerning an Attempted


Lynching at Winchester.


JACKSONVILLE, Oct. 21.-News has reached
here from Winchester that Fred Hollar confined
in the county jail at that place for an assault on
June % last upon Mrs. Mclaughlin and Mrs.
Taylor, who lived alone on a farm five miles
west of Winchester was very dangerously and
probably mortally wounded by mob which
attempted to take his life yesterday morning.
The Jail was surrounded by about fifty masked
and armed men. They compelled the deputy
sheriff to surrender the keys and conduct them
to Hollar's cell. They would have shot their
victim to death had not the jaier prevailed
upon them to do their bloody work outside the
walls. They dragged the prisoner out
and he at once made a desperate rush for
liberty. Forty men fired at him as
he ran, but only one pall hit him. 1t penetrated
his abdomen. He managed to elude his pursuers
and at last returned to the jail Here he was
again shot at by the men left there on guard,
and again he ran. This time he met the city
marshal, who concealed him and summoned sur
gical aid. The mob, after thorough search,
dispersed. Holar's recovery is despaired of. The
assault he is accused of, most brutal one.
The two women were defenseless, and were cut
and hacked without mercy narrowly escaping
death."

happily, these arrangements were not yet
completed, While the war lasted no pri-
vation-neither hunger, cold, nor bodily
pain-was TOO hard TO bear. Win fathers,
brothers, and sons at the front, the women
and girls at home, dependent wholly on
themselves, had suffered without muir
mur.


But now, the sight OF storehouses, filled
with soldiers who would no longer need to
be fed, and the thought OF their own fam
ished condition, was more than their weak
flesh and blood could endure.


lnnamed and excited by few leading
spirits, an immense throng-mostly OF wo-
men and children-had crowded into the
street, picked up such missiles as came to
their hands, and with shouting and clamor
were rushing toward the officers.
- Bread Bread we are starvingP' was
their cry, and glance at their distorted
md determined faces showed they would
stop at nothing to secure their end.


On they came, their number swelling
every moment, and their yclls and cries
filling the air. The general, knowing the
terrible results likely TO follow the capture
OF the stores by the mob-there being
and conscious that what was to be done
must be done at once, turned to one OF his
companions and said, captain, order your
company here sir, as quickly as possible,
and II that crowd does not scatter, when
give the word, fire upon them""


The young officer, his face flushing as he
saluted, replied. ""General, my men do not
light women and children, and, even were
to give such command, which cannot
do, would certainly refuse to obey It,""


Under the circumstances such q reply
would have been severely punished as a
breach OF military discipline, but distinc-
tions OF rank were almost lost how, and the
general, biting his lips, hurriedly made the
same request OF the others about him.


Each In turn answered substantially as
the first,
The general cast glance at the ever-ad-
vancing mob, and then said, In tone OF
utter despair:


'Do you realize, gentlemen, that that
crowd means drunkenness, debauchery,
pillage, and perhaps murder My God
is there no one who Will obey an order to
prevent these horrors9""
To his amazement voice seemingly at
his stirrup answered: ""Yes, general,

Looking down he saw lad, perhaps 10
years old, uniformed as cadet captain.


What did you say my boyy,


'My men will obey you, sir"" was the re-
ply.


The old soldier gazed at the little fellow
an instant, noted the earnestness and de-
termination In the young countenance, aud ,
perhaps, thinking this possible chance OF
averting the awful scenes OF a bread riot,
saluted him and said :,

all these proceedings with much interest,
and when they realized that 1t was expected
TO stop their progress, by means OF these
lew boys, renewed their derisive SHOUTS ana
emphasized them into shower OF stones.

The other was Frenchman named Launie, who had some altercation with Scott several days ago.

criminal procedure in this country is the
great reason why infuriated men so often
take the law into their own hands. The
Baltimore American is of opinion that the
feature in our jury system which seals the
lips of the criminal and will not compel
him to criminate himself is the one defect
which is mainly responsible for lynchings.


There is good deal of force in the Ameri-
cans view of it. In feudal times when the
jury system was the means of protecting
the poor man against the oppressive noble
man, the principle was all right. But now
that there are no oppressive lords the sys-
TEN is used to protect criminals against JUS
tice, and seems to be devised to hinder a
searching investigation into crime. The
detection and punishment of crime is a
great duty and safeguard to society.


For this reason every plan that
could be thought of ought to
be adopted to get at the facts.


There is no reason why an accused person
should not be compelled to testify. If he
told the truth it would be apparent, and if
he lied he would soon be SO entangled in
his lies that the facts would be known.


Innocence likes the fullest investigation


and a person who is unjustly accused of
crime would be glad of the opportunity to
reveal everything within his knowledge.

to interrogate the criminal and have ex-
plantations of suspicious facts. In nearly
all of the civilized countries of Europe the
accused is the chief witness and there is no
reason why it should not be so here. AS
long as our laws continue to give murderers
the presumption of innoc ence in their favor
and then permit hair-splitting technicalities
to rule out all the evidence against them,
just so long will there be lynchings and

prominently had this event been Kept be
fore the people that long before the houl
for the buglers % souud the charge, 3.3,
p. m, the gardens were filled by an i'm
mense throng, which, continuing TO in-
crease, soon packed all the seats, the
elevated platfocm running in front
of the cages OF wild animals, the
stairway leading thereto, and also that
leading to the camera Obscura, While the
small hOy who came early was numer-
ously represented upon The framework OF
The swings, tree limbs, fences, ana all
other uuOccupied points or vantage
from which thev could overlook the crowd
OF spectators who cOnQre gated about the
lists i'm dense array. For the purpose OF
the tournament ""A space bad been rOped IN
Ia the centre Of the amphltheatre, at
either end Of which were planted the col
Ors of America aud France. The ground
witnn the lists thus reserved had received
covering Of tan bark, 70 afford good
foothold to the charging horses, and also
TO guard against any accidents in case
either or the horsemen should be thrown
during the encounter. The men were both
on the ground in good season, and Ross,
who had been forced to take a strange
horse At the last moment, owing to the
lameness Of one OF those he had intended
riding. put in part Of the time in prac-
tisng with his steed, in order to become
familiar with him.


Upon the arrival Of the appoined hour
the crowd was pushed mack from the front
Of the lists next the stable. the ropes were
thrown down. and the calValcade, com
posed of the two duelists their respective
seconds. and the umpire, rode IN. The

rens and =. Gelberi, while Sergt. owen
Davis, Of the Second United States Cav
airy regiment, acted as umpire. Each
had a trumpeter in uniform, NJ. B. Leh-
mann acting in that capacity for Castor,
and NJ p. Lynch, Of the Second United
States Calvary, for Ross, and Castor was
also attended by an interpreter. The
duelists, who wore steel cOrslets and
heavy iron wire masks, took up their po-
sltiOns at the opposite ends OF the lists,
While the umpire and seconds drew up in
line on one side, the trumpeters standing
opposite them. All being in readiness,
Sergt. Davis gave the command, and each
bugler sounded the charge in succession.
Castor spurred forward, but Ross re-
manned at his post, having fer some rea-
son misunderstood the signal.


The umpire and seconds rode up, and
after m0mentary explanation, a second
charge was ordered. Both then spurred
forward. and after an interchange Of cuts
and parties, Ross rapier reached the
Frenchman's breastplate. The trumpets

point was declared in favor OF Ross, and
each returned to his own cOlOrs. Again
they charged, and again Ross made
point, scoring this time on G8stOn's back,
pnd on the succeeding charge made his
third point, this time delivering blow
on Gaston's breast.


ON the fourth bout CASTOR scored the
first point in the contest by getting in a
neat cut on Ross's chest CASTOR now
began to force the lighting, and came for
ward with an apparently determined air
of winning the battle when the bugles
rang out the signal for the fifth charge,
but Ross, after parrying his attack,
wheeled his horse suddenly and gave mis-
opponent two blows, fore and aft, and
secured bis fourth point. Castor, on the
sixth charge, continued the same tactics,
forcing the fighting, while Ross rode away
from him, keeping his horse moving in a
circle tor some time, and then, wheeling
and exchanging cuts, scored his fifth
point by blow on the Frenchman's
che,t


On the call for the seventh bout the
Frenchman dashed forward with his
horse on a run, and charged into Ross
corner, Ross having for some reason re-
malned at his post. After moments
fighting, Ross worked his way into the
centre OF the lists, but the Frenchman
got blow on his shoulder and scored his
second point in very neat style. The
French element, which was very largely
represented cheered their cOmpatriot
loudly as he returned to his cOlors. The
succeeding round was very well contested,
and considerable hacking Of steel was
0done before point was made; but this
time Ross was the winner by a cut on
Gastoh's back, scoring his sixth point.


AT the ninth charge both men spurred
forward, and, meeting in the centre of the
lists, exchanged cuts, when Ross again
won by blow on GastOn's breastplate.


An lntermsson was now ordered, to
allow OF change in the horses. SO far
the contest had been in favor OF Ross,
who had the advantage IN his superior
strength, which enabled him to beat
down his opponents guard and he was
also mounted on better horse, and
seemed TO enjoy a greater freedom OF
movement in the saddle, while In point OF
swordsmanship CASTOR showed TO q rath-
er better advantage. AT the end OF ten





die. Ross mounted on a large bay horse,
almost the counterpart OF the one he was
on before, while CASTOR had exchanged
the small white mustang on which be
first appeared tor a tall black, which APP
peared badly frightened by the crowd and
behaved in very ugly manner for some
time. When the bugle sounded the black
refused to charge, eyincing disposition
rather TO back through the ropes, while
Ross horse came forward IN good style.
CASTOR met his opponents advance. but
he was handicapped by his fractiOus
horse, and Ross scored his eighth point
by cut on GastOn's back


On tbs next bout CASTOR had more
trouble with his horse, but got him under
better control, and got In a cut across
Ross shoulder and chest, scoring a
third point. GastCn's horse came for
ward In better style on the eleventh
charge, and his rder was again Success.
ful, after some rather lively fencing,
scoring bis fourth point. The contest
was now growing exciting, and the sym.
pathizers Of the contestants made the air
ring with their shouts as one or the other
gained a point. On the succeeding bout
GastOn's horse WAS again ugly, and Ross
got in bis ninth point by cut across
GastOn's back, and on the next charge
scored again by cut on Gaston's side
On the fifteenth charge the men met and
exchanged blows In the middle OF The
course, and Ross won Immediately"

Williams was then led several miles into some thick timber where they were met by anoth- CT party having in charge Frank Mor- gan and boy named Moore.

 West Haven, Yesterday Afternoon.

 Nearly one thousand people stood with their hats off in the falling rain yesterday afternoon and watched the ceremony of lay ing the corner stone of the new St. Lawrence Roman Catholic church which IS being built on the corner of Union and Main streets, West Haven. The crowd consisted of men, women and children, some of whom had been waiting for the exercises to begin for nearly two hours. The small boys climbed up into the trees on the lot adjoining the, church and tried to see how much noise they could make while the ceremony was being gone through with. Nearly five hundred of those present went from this city by special cars on the West Haven road, while as many others walked, as did about two hundred members of the St. Aloysius society headed

 by the Wheeler & Wilson band of

 Bridgeport The first floor of the church was laid Saturday and

 several chairs set on it for the priests, and the people quickly crowded on to

  CT Larkin, the pastor of the West Haven church. The St. Aloysius society were then given the privilege of occupying the floor

 with the priests and the band. Shortly after

 o'clock Rev. Father Larkin, followed by

 three altar boys, Bishop McMahon of Hart

 ford, Rev. Fathers Mulcahy and Gibbons of

 Sacred Heart, Rev. Father Cooney, Murray

 and Maloney of St. Johns, Rev. Father Law

 Ter of St. Marys, Rev. Fathers Mulholland

 and Lynch of St. Francis, Rev. Fathers

 Kelly of Bridgeport and Rogers of Stamford, marched upon the platform and after bless ing the cross proceeded to the southwest cor

 ner of the building where the regular Catho-

 lie ceremony of laying the corner stone was

 performed by the Bishop, assisted

 by Rev. Fathers Russell and Kelly.

 Under the stone was placed document on

 which was inscribed the date of the laying of the stone, and the names of Pope Leo

 XIII, the Governor of the State and Rev.

 Father Larkin's name A few coins were also placed under the stone. After the stone had

 been laid the procession, consisting of the Bishop, priests and altar boys, marched around the church singing. The priests then again mounted the platform and col lection was taken up.

 An address was delivered by Rev. Father W. A. Harty of Waterbury, who said: wish to announce to all the people present that while am making few remarks the clergy present will pass around the baskets and I LruSG you VIII all respond lR a IDefal man ner. To-day we have gathered here to par ticipate in the solemn exercises of laying a corner stone of another of our beloved churches. It is eminently proper that there should be no differences between the church that is built in the humble village and the one that is erected in our large cities. Each one is entitled to our respect and to our ad- miration each one should have our best wishes or watchful care and our liberal sup port. Tradition has it that when it was or dained that man should be saved by a blessed Trinity there no distinction of persons or places that should receive the benefits of that saving power. Our Saviour was not born in city, but in lonely man ger in @ humble village. It is eminently proper then, repeat, that we should gather here to-day, even though the elements are against us, to join in these solemn services and bid God speed to the people who are so nobly doing the work of spreading our glo rious religion. This is none other than the foundation of the house of God. The con- dition of universal salvation will be inn proved by the work that will be carried for ward in this church. and your children will be lead to become Gods true children by the influences that will surround them in this church. In this church the poor will be just as welcome as the rich, and the low will occupy positions as lofty as the high. The blessed gospel will be preached alike to old and young-to the rich and to the poor Here in this church, the corner stone of which has been laid to day, that awful sacri- fee that was made in Calvary will be ex- plained and it's truths and lessons expound- ed Here will be renewed the old, old story and from here the bread of eternal life will be disseminated, and sinners will be told again and again of him who said, Behold am with you always; even unto the end of the earth"" Again say this is Gods house, and no gale of bigoted opposition can destroy | Thora iS ,0A s,, 4ho CRoRo of Connecticut that has twenty Catholics in it that has not a Catholic church. In 1886 | there will have been sixty new Catholic l churches built in this State in six years and five months. January, 1886, it will be just | six years and five months since Bishop Me | Mahon began his duties as bishop of this | diocese During that tirae has been @ single disturbance of any account in any | of our churches and not single Catholic l church in the whole State that can be found l to-day that has not been either built new or l entirely altered and improved, and it matters | not what our enemies may say against us | we shall go on improving and increasing | our churches and bringing our people to God | and to understand that our religion is the | only true and the only right one. God Almighty never intended | that his people should struggle to | comprehend and reconcile half dozen differ | ent kinds of creeds and religious beliefs. | Here in this church you can hear the true re- l ligion expounded and it's truths will be so | carefully explained that no one can fail to l understand it. My hearers, let me urge you | to do all you can to assist this little church | to increase it's usefulness and in other ways prove that you have the welfare of the Cath | ollie church at heart. I had hoped to speak | to you of many other things, but I will not | detain you in the rain. In closing I can | only urge you to keep on in the good work of | giving and doing all you can to build up our | beloved church and increase its influence.

 After the address, the ceremony being | over, there was grand rush for the horse | cars, and many were obliged to wait in the | rain for the cars to make another trip before | they could get to this city, on account of the | large number wanting to ride. The church, which is being built by MT. Andrew O. | Smith, is to be 4Ox7O feet, of wood. The steeple will be 130 feet high. It will cost about $12,00O. The silver trowel will be given to the person giving the largest contri-"

Out of the twelve or fifteen men, Off
GERS and citizens who finally secured
him, one officer is dead, shot through
the body; another probably fatally
wounded, several citizens injured, and
the lunatic himself lies in the County
Hospital mortally wounded, with three
bullets in his body. Shortly before
noon Saturday, the station policeman
at the Wabash, st. Louis and Pacific
Depot, on Polk street, Chicago, re-
ceived the following despatch:


''CHENOA, ILL.,, May 31st.-I have an
insane man on my train who has pos

sas City, Jacksonville and Peoria were

ten or twelve policemen out on No. 1

mo. g."" which left Kansas City Fri
day night, was due at Chicago at $50
p. H., Saturday. There was difficulty
in starting out mo. L."" as directed in
the despatch, and it was decided to
meet the train at the depot Officers
Chasey, Ryan, Murphy, Rowan, Walsh,
Strenning, Dohney, Barrett and Keen
an, in uniform, and Smith, Terry. Am
stein, O'Brien and Laughlin, in citi-
zens' clothes, under the command of
Lieut.. Laugh, made up the squad,
which arrived at the depot ten min
utes before the train was due. The
train being delayed, as was subsequent
ly learned, by Intellectual efforts to
capture the lunatic, the police were
forced to wait more than an hour.
After considerable anxious speculation
as to the condition of things on board
mo. g."" the officers were finally any
thing but reassured by a despatch from
a suburban station warning them that
the maniac was well armed and would
resist desperately. A little later NO
g."" appeared in sight, and the police
separating, so as to form two squads
awaited her arrival on either side of
the track. AS the train approached
the whistle sounded number of warn
ing notes in quick succession. People
hanging half way out of the car win
dows were seen to gesticulate wildly
to the crowd. Before the train had
come to stand-still a dozen passeng-
ers had jumped to the ground and fled
looking backward with blanched
faces. Officer Barrett was the first to
observe the lunatic. Barrett was
standing near the rear end of the
smoking car, the madman with leveled
revolver glared at him from the front
platform of the chair car. one car
length distant Barrett turned half
around and stopped instantly, but too
late, ball from the lunatics revolver
struck him in the side and in five min
utes he was dead One look at the
maniac was enough to satisfy anyone
that while his ammunition lasted he
would not be taken alive. Seeing this.
the officers, after removing their
wounded comrade, began to fusilade
through the windows of the smoking
car, where the madman had taken ref
uge. After a minute or two he
plunged out on to the platform, fired
couple of shots into the crowd leaped
from the train and dashed down Fourth
avenue. Officer Laughlin started in
hot pursuit, and at him the lunatic
fired the last shot in his weapon, but
without effect. The maniac stopped
there and awaited Laughlins coming
with cleaning eyes and frothing mouth.
They clinched, the officer tripped his
prisoner and they both fell, the mad
man meanwhile beating Laughln un-
mercifully on the head with his re-
volver. The officer was in citizens
clothes and was set upon and terribly
pounded by an excited colored man
who mistook the officer for the pris-
oner. The rest of the squad arrived
shortly, the maniac was secured, taken
first to cell and then to the hospital
to have his wounds dressed. When
he realized that further resistance was
useless, the prisoner grew calm, and
said, quite nationally, that his name
was Louis Reaume, that he was SO
years old, and was en- route to his
home in Detroit from Denver.


The trainmen of mo. 6"" tell a thrill
ling story of the trip from Kansas
City. When the man boarded the
train at that place he remarked that
people were after him to lynch him
and that if left alone he would molest
no one. At Ell Paso, ILL.,, he became
violent and, with revolver in hand.
ordered the trainmen to cease making
some changes in the makeup of the
train.

 This court came in yesterday morning at 10 o'clock.

 The court handed down the following de- cisions: In the case of Winchell vs. Coney for the foreclosure of a mortgage on Carll's Opera House, which was argued last week on a motion to amend the complaint. The plaintiff was allowed to amend on payment of costs.

 In the case of Winchel vs. Carll, a receiv CT case, the petition to remove the case to the United States Circuit court was denied.

 Decision was rendered for the defendant in the case of Todd vs Munson, which was dispute over deed.

 The demurrer to the answer of the defend ant in the case of Gushee vs. the Union Knife company was sustained.

 The case ot Ives, of Meriden, vs, the city of Middletown, action for $2, 900 damages claimed in consequence of injuries upon defective highway, occupied the attention of the court the most of the day.

 In the afternoon Rosie B. Olmstead, ot Olmstead, of Meriden. Cause intemperance and cruelty. The parties were married De- tober 25th, 1879. The custody of minor child was given to the petitioner

 s. E. Baldwin appeared before the court in the afternoon and asked that an inj uunc- tion against The G. M. Hotchkiss & Co.,, of West Haven, issued by Judge Deming be re- moved. It grows out of an attachment placed upon the stock of William Parmalee, who is or was a one-seventh owner of the stock in said company. Before the argu- ments were concluded MT. Baldwin, counsel for the Hotchkiss company, and MT. Clark, counsel for the Yale National bank who bring suit against Parmalee on prommlssory notes, reached an amicable arralgnment whereby the injunction was removed.

 Court adjourned until this morning at 10 o'clock.

that the extra ordinary action of the young
counsel who We're appointed to defend the
negro, Howard Cooper, in availing them


selves OF a bare technicality to take his
case to the Supreme Court Of the United
States, which led to his summary execu-
tion, was in some measure justified by a
purpose of obtaining an adjudication up
on the abstract question as 20 where the
responsibility rests for the colored popu-
lation not getting into the jury boxes in
Baltimore county. If we are not mistaken
that question has already been decided
by the Supreme Court in the cases which
came up from Virginia some years ago
We think it was then decided that, if
State. By lao, excl-de negroes from jury
service, then a criminal of that race, when
put upon trial in the courts OF such State,
shall have the right to transfer his case to
the Federal court for such State, in con-
formi'y with the provisions of the civil
rights bill ; but if there is no law in the
State warrauting such exclusion, then any
judge of court, who shall exclude them
on account of race, color, or previous con-
dition of servitude shall be liable to in
dictment under the civil service act, and
tried in Federal court and if it can be
affirmatively established that the indict-
ed judge has excluded colored jurors for
such cause alone, he will be liable 10 the
penalty provided by the act.


Several judges of the State courts of
Virginia were indicted for this course
several years ago, but when their cases
came to trial it was found impossible to
prove that the exclusion of negroes from
juries was due to prejudice against their
race, color or previous condition OF servi
tude, rather than to an impartial consid-
Grafton of their lack of intelligence, sobri-
ETY. and integrity-the essential requisites
of the good men and true who are % be
put upon juries. The prosecutions were
therefore all abandoned


AS the TIMES took occasion to remark
some years ago when co,ored jurors were
first put into the panels in this county, the
laws Of Maryland require the judges to
select their juries from the body of the
county fairly and impartialy, with spe-
cial reference to the intelligence so5riety and
integrity' of the persons selected. This
law, we took occasion to say, could not
be regarded as IL any manner in conflict
with the civil rights act or the 14th amend
ment, and We then expressed tie opinion
tha', when the relative eI'igence, sobri-
ely aid integrity of the two races in this
county were taken into consideration. w it'll
the law governing the appointment Of
ju les, that, instead of the exclusion Of
colored jurors being presumptive evidence
OF race or color prejudice, the inclusion of
them in the pane's was strongly presump
tive evidence that their selection was due
t. race and color prejudice in their favor.
We have seen nothing since to alter our
opinion in that gard and We now again
affirm it.


There cannot be any reasonable doubt
that the judges of the Balti
more county court, who are honorable,
men, in their selection Of
200 men from the body of their county
with specin reference to their intelligence,
sobriety and integrity, as required by law,
found the most intelligent, sober and hon
est men among the white population of
that county and made their selections ac
1t is fact, however, that un-
der the civil rights act and the adjudica-
tions of the Supreme Court, the U. S. Cir
cult Court for Maryland may take cogni-
zance of the matter and that the remedy
to the wrong, if any there has been, has
already been adjudicated to lie in that
direction. 1t is true that more recent |
decision of the Supreme Court has thrown
doubts upon the constitutionality of the
civil rights bill itself; but ~ any event, it is
manifest that the whole question pretend
ed to be involved in this case of Howard
Cooper has already been adjudicated by
the highest Federal tribunal. There was,
therefore, no possible justification fer the
action of his counsel in attempting to de-
lay indefinitely the just sentence of the
law in this case and, if there ever was a
sufficient apology for lynch law, it is found
in the case of Howard Cooper.

An Incident of Winter Life on the

 Sherman (Wy) Letter in Pittsburg Commer- cial.l

 On Tuesday of last week we had visitors. Six Of fthe boys from Hardman's ranch de- scended on us like wolf on the fold. They meant to stay, they said, until they had eaten Us out. From the way they handled the dinner that day it looked as if their visit

 would be mighty short. As they brought sundry fasks of western kill at -a-hundred yards, they were received with open arms. After dinner everybody was feeling good and the fun began. In our ranch there are only three rooms-kitchen dining-room and sleep ing apartment. The walls of the dining room are covered every inch with pictures from illustrated papers. Worthies of ali | races and condition lend their august pres ence to our meals, and beauties of all styles look down upon the admiring faces of the

 COW punchers.

 ''Say, Hank,' said the leader of the visi- tors to our cook, ''that old duffer in the wig is too snide Watch us bore him."" There upon, that irreverent herder pulled out his six-shooter and shot Benjamin Franklin square in the eye. That opened the ba l. Our foreman was away, and our boys and the

 

 crowd began to blaze away at the pictures on the wall

 There was @ picture of Guiteau posted above the kitchen door. 1 believe that every fellow in the room shot into him. ""That

 pretty girls nose is tootlong,"" one would say,

 and then proceed to stave off pieces with his revolver. The ballet girl received especial attention. After the shooting there was

 mighty little left of their scant clothing. When they had paid their respects to the picture gallery the crowd ripe for any l mischief The ranch we live in was built

 last fall. Up to the severely cold weather

 half of us had lived down at tue old ranch, ! set in it was deserted. The boys feared that when spring opened the old ricketty

 building might be fixed up and again made habitable. Now that the foreman was away l they determined to spoil the chances of ever having to live in it again, and at the same whole crowd mounted their mustangs and ran race down to the old building. Some

 of the boys wanted to burn it, but that was decided too tame a way of disposition of it. Hank Carson, our cook, and the mischief

 maker, proposed that it be blown up. The plan was hailed with shouts of delight. One

 of the boys was sent back for bag of pow der. When it was brought, train of pow

 der was laid along the floor against each of the walls, and carried out of the door down the path. Then the whole party, with the exception of Hank, mounted their mustangs

 and drew up off at safe distance. Hank

 touched light to the train, then vaulted in

 to his saddle and dashed out of danger.

 That building just bumped itself in the md

 dle and the roof sailed skywards, while the four walls went skipping about over the prairie. How that crowd did cheer and howl

 with delight They all agreed that it was the

 biggest picnic they had had since the lynching of horse-thief in the summer. Then the

 parties separated and rode home. The own CTS of the building now about to send a

 bill of damages to each of us. On the whole

 the winter is not perfectly uninteresting season out here"

How Coiored Men are Treated In the

City Of Salisbury.


EDIToR NATIONAL REPUBLICAN: The
feeling which obtains in the north that the
spirit Of anto-bellum times In the south has
completely died out; that a citizen from one
Of the northern states can express his
opinion without fear and trembling; that
he can critlcise the action Of those who are
in authority and condemn outrageous con
duct, whether the person be n high official
in the state or town or city, Is one which
can be easily disproved.


There Is also feeling that the negro In
the south has full right 10 express him
self in all political aud other matters;
that he is allowed to give utterance to his
sentiments touching the administration of
Justice In oil the courts OF law; that he Is
permitted, as a citizen of the United States,
to exercise the right given him by the CON
stitution in critlcising the unjust decisions
OF a judge and the unfair and inequitable
dealings OF all public officials. The Hon.
Carl schurz tells the people Of the north
that the ''old south has passed away.n


We beg leave TO say that thugs have not
undergone such great changes as the peo-
pie OF the north have been made TO think
and believe. To prove that our statement
is true we ask the American people TO allow
us to submit to them the facts. We are q
negro and citizen Of Boston, aud went to
Zion Wesley College, Salisbury, N. c., last
March to manage the farm connected with
the institution. Salisbury is governed at
the present time by the bitterest and most
interruptions Of Democrats Several weeks
ago an unprovoked assault was committed
ON Prof. W. Harvey Goler, OF Zion Wesley
College, by a bully called Shaver. We gave
the facts OF the case, and II appeared in the
New York Freeman of the 9th ultimo. We
stated nothing but Gospel truths, but they
were received In the spirit OF fiery indigna-
tlon. The city was in an uproar, and our
life was threatened. The aforementioned
article was as follows:


Prof Joseph c. Price and Prot W. Harvey
Caller attended an auction sale last Saturday.
Saturday in Salisbury is usually busy day,
and the streets and square are filed with peo-
pie. There was very largo crowd at this sale,
places there is always little jostling, aud il is
not an easy matter to determine who Is the
one that pushes you. The two professors were
standing ddeby side; Presently burly white
man, who, no doubt, had been jostlcd by one of
his own color, turned around and charged Prof
Goler as being the one who did II. Prot. Goler
politely replied that he did not. The white
trash renewed the charge The colored gen.
tleman again, In polite manner, denied 1t.
The swnggercr repeated 1t for the third or
fourth time, receiving the same answer from
H.
liar, and that IL he disputed his word
again he would knock him down--at tho same
time striking at Prof Golor. The rascal did
not hit Prof Goler, for the muscular arm of
Prof Price was raised and the blow parrled
off With this powerful arm on him the
southern bully could not strike at Prof Goler
again, an this the bystanders did not like.
efforts were made by several white Villains to
break the hold Prof Price had on the rullan,
whom they called shaver, but without avail.
Prof Price was collared by a dirty scamp, but
this despicnble thing found he had Il man to
deal with, for no sooner than he laid his hand
on Mr.. Price the latter had his strong arm in
his throat Several of the white men cried
down, and for what? Simply because Prof.
Goler had disputed his word. This disputlng
the words Of white man had always been
considered terrible oiiense, and the punish
ment in slavery days, rs many OF us we'll re-
member, was Q severe scourging. Very many
white men to-day, especially that class of white
trash and scum like Shaver and his sympnthiS
ers, whose origin is the sewer, the smell of
which place Is still on them and ever viii be
as long as they live, believe that they still have
fright TO whip the negro If he disputes what


In justice to the respectable element of Sails.
bury-the Holmes. the Klutzs, the Dearborns,
and others-we shall describe the crowd of
last satuTday-a mob made up of mon of no
character nnd standing in the place.


The leading citizens cry out against the out
rage committed against Prof Goler who is es.
teemed and highly respected by all as q pol
ished gentleman and scholar. There are n few
facts yet TO be stated which show the kind and
quality of Justice a colOred man receives in
the courts Of Salisbury; In plain English, the
mob was justice. What 1t said was done.
What 1t decreed was irreyocable. We have
only to repeat what was said by the chief ones
| when Prof. Goler was being outraged Several
remarked that the assaied ought TO have been
Knocked down. and cried out to Shaver to dc
SO. Another commanded the policeman to
'Iock up Prof Goler. Instead of his assail
ant being the one to lock up, he who simply
defended himself must be the one Mr.. GoleI
was arrested, and also the bully. They were
taken before the man Neave, who, to tho dis
| grace OF Salisbury, sits In the mayors chair
He is the man who, when in a position some
/ time ago SO to do, secured the passage of q
| charter to disfran chise large number of col
| ored citizens and white ones. He Is simply the
tool Of the worst element. We are told thai
and election, and that he was placed i'm tht
| chair by the ward heelers and low politicians
| This is the man who acts Us judge and Jury II
such cases, and has his room at the cour
house.


Shaver was called up and acknowledged
that he was the guilty one, and also his wit
nesses admitted he was. Prof Goler wa
called up, and made plain statement of facts
| Neaye, In obedience to the command of tho
rabble, made out that the language employed
by Prof. Goler was calculated TO disturb The
peace"" Prof.. Goler was fined $40; also the
| ruffian Shaver.


Because this outrage was given to the
people in plain, vigorous English, the mayor
calls his cronies together and decides Il
| indict us for libel. This took place las
| Tuesday afternoon, the 18th instant. As
| soon as 1t was known the warrant had beer
issued the mobocrats began to assemble II
the streets, and such choice words wer,
freely INDUCED in: ""We will cut his throa


at first sight"" ""We will show that ID
j. Gordon Street what 1t means to tall
about our mayor in such manner.n TIL,
excitement was intense, and our friend


expected every moment we would fall int
the hands OF Judge Lynch. All the trains
bound for Boston were closely watched, ant
our escape at one time seemed impossible
The sheriff came out to the college Il
serve the warrant, but fortunately we wer,
away on business at the time. Had W,
been there, we would have beei
taken, and matters had been so fixed tina
no bondsmen could he obtained, and there
fore must have been placed In the Jail. Th
mob planned II so as to take us out at mid
| night and hang us on tree In the cour
house front. But for the good and kin


friends in the country we must have bee
slaughtered by the mob at Salisbury.


Let not the people of the north believ
the spirit Of 1860 is dead. Let them no
think that all Is well with the colored ma


or the white man from the north in tn
south. j. GoRDoN STREET.

NASHVILLE, TKNS, January 80.


Riley Pile, desperate and moon
sinner of Pickett County, killed Deputy
United States Marshal Jas. Mcdonald,
recently and a few days ago murdered
Junk Davidson, highly esteemed farm.
cr. Deputy Marshals Phillips and Nc
Donald raded Piles still few weeks
ago, destroyed the outfit and arrested
Pile. At first Pile pretended to submit,
but, waiting his opportunity, he suddenly
drew piston and instantly killed Nc
Donald. Making his escape under a run
ming FIRE, Pile hid in the mountains, defy
INK capture. When the excitement died
out he appeared among the people, wioi
knowing him to be desperate man
made no attempt to arrest him.


He conceived the notion that farmer,
Luke Davidson, had betrayed him to the
raiders. lie went to Davidson and made
him give him note for $40, the value OF
the still destroyed by the revenue men
The note fell due the other day and Da
wilson refused to pay. Pile said he would
have blood or money, and would give
him two days to settle. At the end oi
that time, finding Davidson working in q
field, Pile, at the muzzle of rife, marched
him up the mountain side, to where a
huge ledge projects over high cliff. lie
told Davidson that he was going to plac,
the note on his forehead and collect it by
pushing him over the precipice.


A woman living near by had seen the
two men, and knowing Piles desperate
character, dispatched a boy in search OF
Dayidson's brother Junk. The latter was
found, and accompanied by a man named
Oliver, was soon on Piles trail, and ar
rived in sight just as Pile was about to
shove his victim over the precipice. Oil
yer accidentally slipped, attracting Piles
attention. The latter instantly fired with
his rife, mortally wounding Junk David
son, who died In few hours.
Luke Davidson took to his heels
and escaped, leaving Pile and Oil
yer alone. Oliver fred his pistol, severe
ly wounding Pile in the arm. A running
fire ensued for three quarters of a mile,
Oliver reloading his pistol three times
Pile jumped behind rock, and Oliver
afraid to approach, gave up the chase.
Pile was joined next day by his brother,
who is equally well known as despera-
do. The citizens have organized parties
and are searching the mountains, declar-
Ing they will lynch them."

Result of the Harlem Regatta. The Ma


tional TO be Held at Boston.",,"


The Harlem River regatta on Saturday
was the first aquatic event East. The
single-scull race, for which Smithson of
this city entered, was won by Monahan,
the stroke of the Albany four, Dick Morse,
Parker Pages old partner in the doubles,
being second Monahan was the winner
two years ago at Newark when Mckinney
ofthe Potomacs rowed. In that race Kerr
OF Newark was second, and Mckinney
and Pat Dempsey of Philadelphia had
one Of the hardest races ever seen for third
position The local oarsmen were very
much disappointed not to see Smithson
there In mile and half Smithson can
heat Monahan, sure; whether he can in
mile is not so sure q thing. The writer
thinks Smithson better in three mile
race than perhaps, in any other The
Washingtons will send Smithson to the
National regatta, probably.


The old Elizabeth Club of Portsmouth,
Va, means business this season. The
veteran Callahan is III charge of them,
and q more level-headed man, or one bet
hard to find. In 1879, at Saratoga, and
1880, at Philadelphia, the Elizabeths had
n great four, Callahan being their stroke.
Since that time the club has not sent u
crew. north of Washington. Last year
which they were here Callahan said hehad
crew oi Erechcs, DuC VliaV he was
going TO make something of them. That
he has kept his word is shown by their
win Saturday on the Harlem, defeating
the New York Athletics, Davie Roach's
club, the famous Ataantas and the Pas
saics of Newark. The District clubs do
not want to tackle the Elizabeth unless


II good trim.


IL is pretty certain that the National re-
gatta will be held mt Boston. Though u
number of the most prominent gentlemen
identified with rowing here wanted to see
the National come here. the clubs seemed
slow to act. The question will come up
at the several club meetings this week, and
il may yet be decided to ask them to come.
The Back Bay, where the races will be
rowed in Boston, cannot compare with our
own course either in beauty or as q good
rowing course, and has besides great
deal of very rough water. The course is
right down the mill-dam, finishing in
front of the Union boathousc.
Said member of the WaShingtons this
mo1ing, "",fhe report that we were to ask
the National here on our own responsibility
has no foundation in fact, while we all be-
lieve that it would be to the best interests
of rowing, and of business in general
here, to lave the National regatta rowed
on our beautiful Potomac, yet we should
only cooperate with the other clubs. We
took the initiative because we met first,
after the subject was broached and be-
cause we were asked by members of two
of the clubs to take some action upon it
at that meeting. We have no desire TO
push ourselves forward, but are willing
the older clubs should set the pace

George Hosmer says that he has been

A Suspension of Work. LabOrers FuriOus.-.- The Sheriff Called

Co.'S raising their shipping ireights about 40 per cent. they deemed it pruden, to suspend work until the difficulty was tided over, and instructed Col Andrews to suspend the working force but to keep corps of engineer: in the field to complete the location

 The telegram became known in the camp several hours before Col. An. drews, who was away with the engi neers, heard of it, and a false con. struction was put upon the telegram. in consequence of which, when Col, Andrews made the announcement, and with it proposition to either board the men for work for a few days until the money was sent to pay the bills of the Co.,, or continue work as before for wages. The men be. came furious and refused to listen to reason, and by force of arms and threats of personal violence and blood. shed, took possession of camp and attempted to make Col. Andrews 8 prisoner and hold him as hostage un- til the money came. He promptly telegraphed to the President at St. Paul 10 forward him the mon. ey at once to pay the laborers, and showed by his efforts that he was a. anxious to have the men paid as they were themselves. When his pay roll. were made out and his several tele grams and letters were completed Col. Andrews ordered his horse tc go to the station to forward them when to his surprise the whole body of men, armed with shot-guns ano pistols barred his passage and at tempt to leave camp before the money came, one of them going SC far as to propose rope and tree. Col. Andrews then quietly sent his foreman, MT. ]. E. Anderson, to Ash Fork, where he fortunately met Sher. if Mulvenon and they together with Deputy Sheriff Oliver, took the train for the camp, and now instead oi Andrews beng d prisoner in camp, the deputy sheriff is holding the men in subjection with the aid of the as sistance of Messrs. Anderson, Colgan and Lynch. In our interview with Col. Andrews he assured us that the { men would be paid and that Major Wilson was even now on the way to Chino with the money to pay all bills. He added that it was never his inten- tion to desert the men until their wages were paid, and that in giving the orders to suspend work, President Hamilton had no intention of leav- ing the men or bills unpaid, but in the same telegram directed Andrews to telegraph the amonnt needed and that Major Wilson would start at once with the money. Had MT. Hamil. ton been aware of the stringency of our Territorial laws in the protection of laborers' wages, which are differ. ent from those in the East, Mir. An drews assures us that he would not have ordered suspension of work until the money was here to pay the labor bills. And in consequence of our existing laws the Colonel exceed ed his orders by proposing to the men to continue work and then pay would go on as usual. A large ma jority would have consented were 1t not for four or five desperate ring leaders, pad characters, who find their way among good citizens, who not only refused to work themselves, but by threats and force of arms pre- vented others from working and even threatened to kill mules and horses if they were allowed 10 work.

 In consequence oi this attitude the men have forfeited what rights they had under the law in being dis charged without pay. and hence are liable to deduction from their wages for their board since the suspensson, and are further liable to an indict, ment and prose ation for the murder ous threats and resort to arms to take possession of the camp and provis- ions. We hope this matter will be peaceably settled and work resumed as soon as freight difficulties are ad iusted."

 LONDON, Jan. 25.-The activity shown by the dynamiters has set all England in a fren- | zy of alarm and anxiety, and the explosions l thet occurred yesterday afternoon right in l the very houses of Parliament and in the famous Tower of London have given startling proof of the daring and devilish malignity of the fends. It was shortly after two o'clock when the explosions occurred in the Parliament buildings. The first one occur ! red in the crypt of Westminster Hall and the second in the strangers gallery in the House of Commons. Saturday is visiting day st the Parliament buildings, and yester- day the usually large crowd Of strangers in the building was largely increased, it being especially noticed that many women were i'll the throng. One of these was about to enter the buildings shortly before the first explo- sion when she noticed package lying on the l floor from which volume of smoke was is suing and at once called policeman's atten tion to it. The officer rushed to the spot, seized the machine and attempted to extin- guish the fire, but was not quick enough. The fuse burned so rapidly and closed so quickly upon the machine that the official became alarmed and dropped it. The ex- plosion followed almost immediately after The policeman was knocked down by the force of the explosion and fatally injured. Two other policemen and lady and gentle

 man standing near were likewise knocked down and stunned. The great window over the main entrance to Westminster Hall was

 smashed to atoms and all the side windows

 were blown out. The second explosion,

 which was in the lobby of the House of

 Commons, occurred three minutes later than

 the one in Westminster Hall. It came from

 directly under the strangers gallery, and

 very close to the seat usually occupied by

 Mir Bradlaugh when visiting the Commons.

 The lobby was completely wrecked the gal

 lery was torn down, the Speakers chair de-

 stroyed and the massive stonework displaced.

 The glass roof of the House of Commons was

 completely shattered. The clock in the

 House stopped at precisely thirteen minutes

 past two p. m. A heavy beam which formed

 one of the supports to the gallery under

 which Mir Charles Bradlaugh is accustomed

 to sit when he visits the House was project

 ed into the Speakers chair, seriously injur-

 ing it. Mir. Gladstone's seat was torn to

 pieces.

 panic seized all in the vicinity and the

 whole city was soon in a frenzied state of ex-

 citement. The whole of the police force was

 on duty, and the troops in and around the

 city were under arms. Police patrols were

 stationed everywhere in close proximity to

 drawn around every public building. Chief

 Superintendent Williamson, of Scotland

 Yard personally inspected the scenes of the

 explosions, as did also Inspectors Livingstone

 and Kelly. Several men were placed under

 arrest, but were soon liberated asss their in nocence seemed assured. It was found that a large quantity of explosive matter had been

 placed inside the great ornamental gates lead ing to the crypt under WestminsterHall. These gates were blown clear off their hinges and thrown to the ground. All the windows on the north and south sides of the immense building were blown to atoms. The concus- sion shook down from the grand oak roof of the hall the accumulated soot of centuries This in it's downward movement made such a dense cloud that the officers on guard be- came alarmed and dared not enter the room In the lobby the splinters were for time as thick as flakes in binding snowsto""m. They were propelled in many cases with dangerous force. Thsy cut aud ripped the leather from the seats and tore out and scattered the horsehair stutfng all over the house. A man who happened to be upon scaffolding near the crypt | forcibly to the ground. Tho statues of King William "" and of King George "" in West l minister Hall were overturned. No theory could be formed us to the guilty parties, but | it was thought, from the large number of ladies in the buildings many of whom carried 1 bundles which they guarded with jealous | care, that some of these had perpetrated the l outrages. The locality of the explosion in the House is always in deep shadow, being | directly under the gallery, and this an l auxiliary to the perpetration of the plot.

 Soon the fact became known that ex p1osion of some nature, but more fatal ill it's l results had occurred at the tower of London. | Wild rumors were current as to the number | of people hurt by the explosion, but these | were found to be greatly exaggerated. The | attack was made on that portion of the build ing known as the ""White Tower,"" and oc cured about 3 o'clock. The noise of the | explosion was preceded by a binding flash. | There were about sixty visitors in the Tower at the time, and many of these | were more or less severely in jured. One man | had one of his legs smashed. Another's ear | was completely severed from his head. The | explosive agent was deposited in what is | known as the banquetting hall of the White | Tower. This hall is new used as an armory, 1 and in it were stored large number of Mar tini rifles which were destined to be 1 shortly issued to the volunteers It was be- | hind a rack of these that the deadly com pound was Plaeed' f..as dhe iih dynamite the rifles Many of them were twisted into | the most eccentric shapes imaginable, and | their distorted forms were scattered about | the apartment in marvel of confusion. All | the glass and other fragile articles in the | hall were smashed out of all semblanee to | ed through the floor at the spot where the | dynamite lay Directly overhead similar | hole was blown through the roof. The woodwork was set on fire by the explosion, but before any serious damage had been done by the flames they were extin- the vicinity of the Tower. Thousands of ex- cited men surged back and forth shouting for vengeance 'Lynch the fends!' ''Roast the fiends!"" were heard on every hand, and 1 the men who were arrested and aftefward released had a narrow escape Of their lives. The police acted promptly and none within the | Tower were allowed to leave until their inno- cence had been unquestionably established. | All London was aghast at the terrible mafig- 1 nity and stupendous daring of the conspira- tors

 A careful survey of the result of the ex plosion In the House of Commons reveals the | fact that it's force was exerted almost entirely | on the side of the room where the members of | the government and their liberal followers have seats. Had the Commons been in ses- sion at the time of the explosion it is be- lieyed that no less than 200 mem | bers would have been instantly killed. | This number would necessarily have | included Mir Gladstone and several of his | ministers. Even more strange, if possible, | than this is the fact that under the same | neither MT. Parnell nor any of 1 his followers would have been injured at all, | for recently thay have been sitting on the op posite side of the House among the conserv- atives, and the tory quarters escaped almost | undisturbed. The police affect to see in this singular coincidence carefully planned | warning to the government.

 The search of the visitors at the Tower after the explosion occupied four hours. The number of those injured by the explo- sions is as follows: At the Tower, six injured seriously and fourteen slightly; at the Parlia ment buildings, four seriously and ten

 ten slightly. The worst injuries"

Geary and David Freeman, living near the Hollinger placss and Henry Rossler, suitor for the sister of the Freeman boys, were subsequently arrest ed on the suspicion that they had entered Hollinger's yard to steal chickens in the night. It has just been discovered that the three men had gone to the place to kill Hol- finger at the instigation of Alice Freeman, who after having become infatuated with Hollinger and having been wronged by him was stung to hatred of him by his rejecting her and marrying another lady. She told her brothers and Rossler that Hollinger had betrayed her and this melted them to the murder. Two attempts have been made by citizens to lynch the prisoners.

The deaths in Spar make bad showing, a
total of 57,2l9. Probably the truth would make
the total 1000 or 5000 more At the present
rate of virulence and spread, it is not likely that
the total for the year will exceed 100O 900. These
figures recall the most hideous stories of me-!
diaval plaques Long ago the climax of misery,
and panic and suffering seemed to have been
reached, yet the daily reports now reveal new
depths of horror. Granada villages are filled
with unbured corpses; mobs stoning the
doctors; hordes of unmiked cattle are roaming
about the fields believing; officials commit
ting suicide. All this awful chaos at last is be-
ginning seriously in the city of Madrid. where
despairing efforts have kept the disease at bay
so long. Only eight provinces are affected now.
The plague is firmly fixed in the Pyrenean
country. Bilbao and San, Andre will be
the next victims in the NORTH and
thousands will be swept away in the
coming month. The outbreak at Gibraltar has
revived here the fear which has slum bered since
the Bristol case failed to spread the disease.
The chief comfort of England lies in the Fact
that heretofore cholera has only come through
Germany, which induces the hope that we are
safe from later infection. The Marseilles

To the Editor of the Globe:


AprOpos of a recent controversy between
a morning paper and myself in reference to
Irish barbarian ignorance"" arising from
all editorial comment in that paper upon an
alleged cruelty to a bailiff by some farmers
in Ireland, l send you leading article
taken from the Dublin Freeman's Journal
of the 18th inst, which will mitigate, to
some extent, the atrocious charge made by
my late antagonist, that an Irish bailiff
was burned at the stake"" The legitimate
inference to be drawn from perrlsal of the
article is that said bailiff was barbarously
treated, if the report of the alleged occur
renee be true, but there is no justification
for drawing the far-fetched and remote
conclusion that the man was burned at the
stake, taking even the exaggerated cable
gram for basis. Respectfully,


ROGER VAIL.


We are frequently told that the Grow
bar Brigade"" is an institution of the past,
and that Irish public men do an infnity of
harm by conjuring up horrible tales of
heartless evictions which, under a reformed
land law, are no longer possible in this
country. We refer our readers to-day to
the particulars which we publish Of two





the counties of Tipperary and Limerick.
At Killenaule. on Tuesday, seven children
were turned out of their wretched hoval
without, so far as the report indicates, any
substantial justification. Their parents
had collided in some way with the landlord,
and were committed to prison for assault.
Both the father and mother are said to have
lately exhibited signs of mental derange-
ment, and this fact, coupled with their i'm
prisonment had contributed to excite great
sympathy in the locality with their
young children. When the landlord
intimated his intention of dispOs-
sesSing them the greatest astonishment
was expressed, and on the appearance OF
the evictors on Monday the local clergy in
duced them to abandon the heartless act.
But on, Tuesday the landlord appeared with
ten policemen and two bailiffS and carried
his threat into execution, The hapless
children appeared in the town of Killenaule
in the evening, carrying some of their eff
fects and looking for shelter. The other
case is almost worse than the first. At the
New Pallas petty, sessions yesterday a
charge of ''taking forcible possession at
Carrickbeg, near Doom, was preferred
against Daniel and Eliza Ryan. A bailiff
was examined and deposed that the defend
ants were the children of Mrs. Mary
Ryan, whom he assisted in evicting on the
18th ult He swore that the mother was
but out of her holding while confined to bed;
that in compliance with the peremptory or
der of the sub-agent, who was present, the
bed with its dying occupant was put out in
the yard and the house nailed up. This evil
dence was corroborated by the sub-agent
himself, who admitted that he went down
to the place determined to get possession
under any circumstances"" The charge
was dismissed for want of evidence. We
regret to have to notice in connection with
this subject the barbarous treatment to
which bailiff is said to have been sub
jected near Ballinaule on Monday night.
The wretched calling of the bailiff makes
him an obnoxious being to the poor people,
who have most reason to dread his pres
ence, but no condemnation could be strong
enough for the inhuman conduct which is
alleged to have been practiced on
the miserable bailiff Nynch) on Monday
night. It is to be hoped that the incl
dent is explicable by the fact that Lynch
was drunk on the occasion, and in that
way sustained the injuries from which he
suffers."

LONDON, Jan. 26.-A rumor was current last
evening and this morning that Cunningham W no

hearing to-day at the Thames Police Court, in Ar

streets in the vicinity to be crowded with excited
citizens and extra police had to be placed on duty
tokeep order. The feeling against the prisoner is
very bitter and If the crowd once got their hands
on him, there is no doubt he would be lynched.
Afterward the crowd went to Bow ST., on learning
that the examination was to be held there.


The prisoner was conveyed to the Bow Street Po-
lice Court by strong guard of police. He was
then charged. on suspicion of completely in the

At the largely attended colored cit
izens' mass meeting at the U. S. Court
House last Saturday afternoon, Mr..
Reuben NJ. Lowe was called TO the
chair aud Messrs. Pierce Harris and
W. u. Allen elected Secretaries.


The Chairman briefly explained the
object OF the meeting


1st.-To deny published charges
against colored citizens, that they ia
tended to lynch w. H. Councill and
to declare such charges groundless
and wronSfully made against law
abiding people.


2nd.-To ask the Commissioners
of the State Normal School for the
removal Of the Present Principal. w.
Fl. Council, while he is under bonds
on the two charges of outraging o lit
tie girl pupil, and assault with intent
TO kill.


la response to calls, remarks
were made as follows


Mr. Francis Davis deprecated any
prejudicial action as to the guilt OF
innocence Of the accused pending the
legal trial. Meanwhile he considered
that the moral interests of society and
of the school demanded the suspen-
sion OF Principal Councill, until, at
least. he should be acquitted in the
Courts


MIR. Th1s. W. Townsend, hoped
that the accused would IN the end
clearly est stablish his innocence Of the
awful charge. Unfortunately he had
not done so yet. Therefore it was
rig ht and proper for the sake Of pub
tic morals, their protection, as we'll rs
for the immediate interests of the
State Normal School that the Princi
pal be removed until the case wa:
legally settled This course he ed
vlsed, without expressing any opin'
ion as to his guilt or innocence
which was now with the law to deter.
mine. The question was higher snd
fai beyond any personal matter. Az
such, it should be treated.


Mr.. w. P. Williams, DR.. Scruggs
and Rev. j. J. Smith followed in ad-
dresses Of like tone and expression


TIE Editor of the GAZETTE being
called upon, explained the object OF
his presence to be to get for the pub
lie an impartial and correct report Of
what transpired in the meeting. Ii
was his opinion, however, that all
good citizens, white and black, would
try to do their duty when the ublic
good demanded il, and such duty
should be performed impartially and
dispassionately.


Mr.. g. G. Clifton spoke in defense
of his old teacher. Said they should
hear both sides, that he, as stuent
of the school, was entitled to his
opinion of Prof Councill's innocence
would advise the meeting to take nc
action.


NIr. Charles r. DJnegan expressed
himself as heartily ashamed that any
young man could be found willing
as Mr.. Clifton. to arise in public IL
defense of such a cause. In lengthy
tall, he argued that in vlaw OF his
past record and of the present case
it was the duty Of the Commissioners
10 remove Principal Council.


Mr.. Henry Davis was the las
speaker. He thought that it was .
great shame that the people shoule
be called upon to do any such duty a
this. He met the rumor of the tel.
rible charge, as he was coming t,
town to place his daughter in tht
school. and Immediately turned
around and carried her home. Th'
Commissioners should have removed
the Principal without waiting to bt
asked. It was but justice. Such {
retention would not ba tolerated fol
one minute by any white school in th'
land.

pointed to walt on the A. M. E

maval Of Prof. "". H. Councill from

August Schaefer and wife were found
dead in bed at their home in Boerne, Tex,

the bed with four barrels dis charged. The

The National Conference of Charities


and Correction.",,"inc National Conference OF Charities


and Correction.


Judge Macarthur called the twelfth an
nual National Conference of Charities and
Correction to order at Willard Hall last
night Rev. S. H. Giesey of Epiphany
Church offered prayer. Addresses of well
come were delivered by Judge Macarthur
and Commissioners Edmonds. A letter
from Colonel Lamont was read expressing
President Clevelands regret at his inabil-
ity to be present and his sympathy with
the objects of the association. Ex-Gov-
ernors Anderson of Kentucky and Hoyt
of Pennsylvania responded to the ad-
dresses of welcome. MIR. Phillip G. Gar
rett of Pennsylvania, the president of the
conference, delivered the opening adj
dress. He explained the objects of The
organization and the progress which has
been made in the practical application of
its ideas. Among the most fertile causes
of crime, he said are the habit of carrying
deadly weapons and the frequent miscar-
riage of justice in criminal cases, where
false pleas, such as that of insanity. are
allowed to shield the guilty. ave must
all lament, he added, ""the increase in
the practice of lynch law, which has of
late years become alarmingly prevalent.
But so longas lynchers are allowed to go
unpunished murders of this kind will con-
tinue to increase i'm number""


The tramp was, he said, the greatest foe
of society. He spoke of the evils of intem-
perance and said: ""Unfortunately many
earnest anti-liquor men are among the
strongest opponents of efforts to diminish
drunkenness, and governed by the idea
that total prohibition is the only remedy
obstruct the attainment of the good result
desired by all good men"" After the adj
dress an adjournment to the parlors and
breakfast-room of Willard was had upon
the invitation of Mrs. Sara A. Spencer in
behalf of the local committee. a recep-
ton was held IN those rooms.


The first business session of the con-
ference was held at Willard Hall this
morning. The session was opened with
prayer by Rev. S. NJ. Newman. The
president, Philip c. Garrett, in calling the
assembly to order, announced that the
meeting had assembled late, and to save
time the credentials of the delegates
would not be read. Mr.. Pratt of the local
committee announced that application
could be made to him for the certificates
of transportation. Resolutions were then
adopted limiting the time of speeches and
reports from States to ten minutes. A
committee of five on organization and
committee composed of delegates from
each State delegation TO select place and
appoint the time for holding the next
meeting were appointed.


A letter from the authorities inviting
the conference to visit the Maryland peni-
tentiary was read. The president stated
to visit the institution in a body was i'm
possible, but individual members could
visit the penitentiary. The corresponding
secretary was authorized to acknowledge
the invitation. Mr.. Meth, chairman of
the Committee on States, read the COM
mittees report. He said that he had not
received reports from all the States, but
the reports they had received showed the
wide extent of the workings of the
society


Reports were then presented from the
following States Alabama, Arizona, Cali
fornia, Dakota, Florida, Georgia, Illinois,
Iowa, Kansas, New York, Kentucky,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michi-
gan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Ne
braska Nevada and New Hampshire
The following resolution was then

members of board of State charities, per-
sons appointed officially as delegates by
the Governors of States and Territories,
all persons accredited to from charity
organizations and all bodies and institu-
tions which have for their object either
the prevention or cure of social ills, shall
be recognized as active members of this
conference and entitled to participation""


At II o'clock the reading of the remain
der of the reports was postponed. Mrs.
Spencer announced int few witty remarks
the programme for the social visits of the
conference this afternoon, after which the
meeting adjourned until this evening.


The President received the members of
the conference this afternoon."

BRILLIANT CAPTURE.


think it was two days after the army
marched out to the Wilderness that n
company Of cavalry brought in to Orange
Court House Gen. Shaler, of New York,
Gen. Thomas Hamblin, and several other
generals and colonels who had been can.
tured at the first assault on Gen. Grants
right wing. These gentlemen were
brought TO the provost marshal's Office, |
where they were treated with every con. |
sideration which their situation permitted |
by the provost marshal Mai. d. B.
Bridgeford) and his officers. They were
treated to the best to eat and drink that
could be provided, and were allowed
perfect freedom on giving their parole.
L may state that afterward il was reported
in the newspapers that Gen. Shaler at
Charlottesville, while on the train for
Lynchburg (the railroad had been cut by
the federal cavalry between Gordonsyille
and Richmond) in requital for his hos.
pitable treatment, attempted to make n
speech from the platform of the cars, in
which he urged the confederate soldiers
assembled about the depot to revolt
against their officers, and arms in hand
to come back under the folds of the old
flag. The speech was received with boots
and jeers and derisve laughter, and it
was only by the efforts of the post com.
missioned officers that Gen. Shaler was
not subjected to personal violence at the
hands OF the men. l only relate this to
show the spirit and feeling which ami.
mated the confederate troops at that time,
and not to cast any reflection on the con.
duct Of Gen. Shaler. His enthusiastic
loyalty to the old flag, and his lack of
prudence, came near costing him his life.
After the battle of the Wilderness the
battalion was transported on cars to {
Gordonsvile. AS news had arrived that ,

man had seized upon Trevillian station, t
on the Gordonsville and Richmond road {
and had burned the stores and torn up

of the hostile cavalry. We arrived in v

 The inhabitants of Barneston were cor respondingly disappointed, and gave up ment, their village was finally selected and Shenstone left in the lurch: and they were still further amazed when they learned that it had been brought abou, by boy to whom they had never given much credit either for shrewdness or tenacity.

 His name was Fred Sedgwick, and he was not more than I4 years old. He was an observant fellow, however, and gen. crafty arrived at correct conclusions. An idea had seiz d him, in connection with the rivalry between the two towns it was a practical idea, and he determined to make the most oft.

 A gentleman stopped at the only hotel in the place, one hot summer afternoon. Hrs name was Lynch, and he was the chief engineer oi the surveying party. When Fred heard of his arrival he coacluded to call upon him, and found him seated upon one of the porc1es o the hotel.

GRIST FOR THE GALLONS.


Mr.. Bartlett, of Bibb, introduc-
ed general bill of considerable
interest. 1t provides that the
punishment for attempts at rape
should be death except where the
jury trying the case recommends
that the prisoner be punished by
Imprisonment in the pAnitentiary
Mr.. Bartlett says the bill ought tc
pass, and it has already quite q
good following.


Judge John t. Clarke prepared
the bill above referred to on Mon.
day morning of last week, and
sent it up to be introduced into
the house. We sincerely hope
that it will be promptly passed.


The crime deserves that penal.
ty. Its frequency demands in
creased rigor Of the law for its
suppression. Public sentimcn
demands the death penalty, ant
the providing of it by law will, WI
trust, have great influence in pre-
venting the terrible and wicked
resort to lynchiag, which is be
coming SO common all over tn,
country."

 Whisky and Beer and Get Very

 Drunk-In the Police Station.

 LOWELL, Mass, Oct 20.-Ths five young girls who were arrested last night for drunk enness made things warm all night by their profanity and ribald songs. They gave their names, ages and residences as follows: Min nie Grant and Maggie Grant, sisters, aged re- spectively twelve and eleven; Katie Lynch, aged twelve; Mamie White, aged thirteen, and Katie Mullen, aged twelve. It appeared that the Mullen girl received $2 yesterday morning for work done in boarding house. She hunted up the other four girls, purchas- ed two half pints of whisky at barroom and they walked to an open lot on Pawtucket street. Here they drank repeated potations and proceeded to walk to Dracutt, singing, shouting and causing general disturbance, and returning to Lowell and obtaining tin pail bought two quarts of beer and returned to the lot. This they also drank. Finally their actions became so noticeable and disa- greeable that the residents sent for the po- lice. Four of the girls accused the Mullen girl of enticing the girls away to drink, but the latter said they had accompanied her willingly and drank the liquor and beer. The girls were so drunk that they could hardly tell connected story, and they made charges and counter charges against each other. They called each other the most shocking names and their conduct was equal to that of the toughest virago that was ever brought into the station."

an editorial in the Baltimore american on
the lynching Of Cooper at Towson in Balti-

Of 'plain talk.n After showing that there
was not the shadow of an excuse for mur-
dering the wretched man, MS he was sure to
lie lawfully put to death in due time, the
american says: ""Those who participated
in the lyncbing did so in horrible sport,
and not in cool, relentless justice. No one
can read the account of the lynchipgs that
are now so distressingly frequent and fail to
see than the crowds enjoy them as savages
do the torture Of prisoner. A criminal is
hunted for a lynching just as bear or
rcnther is hunted for the love of the
Chase.n The editor adds that It was
known in Baltimore early Sunday evening
that the lynching was to take place. ""The
city papers sent out reporters to see what
would be the issue Of the attempt. II
would have been easy to summon the good
and true men Of the county to defend the
jail, and 1t should have been defended at
whatever cost of life."" This shows that
the authorities did not care to prevent the
murder. We incline to the opinion that the
sheriff or deputy at the Jail was more than
willing to he ""overpowered."" II the ring
leader Of the mob bad been shot dead when
he began to force an entrance the sport
would have terminated at that point."

 Nothing else was talked of for months in advance, and the old county was stir rcd to its centre, for naught so revolu- tionizes a country place as. wedding. The neighboring forests paid their trib- ute in holly, and the traditional mistle- toe bcpgh was suspended on high, ander which, if any victim was caught, she was compelled to pay the accustomed forfeit, which could be claimed by any cavalier in the room so inclined.

Deviiish Murders on Record--A Young
Georgian Shot Down in the Road While
His Wife Vainly Pleads On Her Knees for
His Life.",,"His Life.


COLUMBUS, GA, January 5.


Nothing in the criminal annals of
this State rivals in cold-blooded brutality
the murder of Samuel M. Baker at the
hands of gang of desperadoes led by
John W. Smith, who has for years been
recognized as terror in the neighbor-
hood. Not only was there not the slight
est shadow OF provocation or pretext for
the deed, but the peculiar circumstances
surrounding the case render it one of the
most atiocious that could possibly be
Imagined. Surrounded by the band of
ruftans, the unfortunate victim was shot
to death while his weeping bride knelt at
the feet of the murderer, imploring vainly
for the life of her young husband.


Mr.. Baker, who was only recently
married, settled a few weeks ago on a
farm in Carroll County, nearly on the
line of Heard County. The young couple
were supremely happy. The farm was
well stocked, and the planning of the
farm operations for the coming year had
been discussed and agreed upon, the
yield promising an abundant return.


On Wednesday evening last about
twilight Mr.. Baker took his brides arm,
and together they went out to look at
their stock. Just as they turned to re-
trace their steps toward their home,
three men, armed, and infiamed with
liquor, approached them. They were
John w. Smith, Andrew Smith and A. S.
King. All were known to Mr.. Baker,
who stepped aside with his wife, in the
hope of avoiding any controversy with
them. John Smith stepped across their
path, and, cooking his gun, ordered them
to halt.


""Go down on your knees"" said the
ruf1ian, cor I'll blow your brains out""
enforcing the command by poASng the
weapon at the head of Mr.. Baker, who
was unarmed. Smith then poured forth
| the most villainous abuse on the head of
| his intended victim, interlarding his
| frightful oaths with the most shocking
| obscenity. Realizing the perilous posi-
ton in which her husband was placed,
Mrs. Baker, hoping to save him from
violence, left his side, and approaching
Smith, knelt at his feet, and clinging tl
his knees, shrIcked out:


""Spare my husbands life. For Gods
sake spare him! He has never wronget
you. DO not kill him!"" and in the ex
citement sinking to the ground in hall
! fainting condition.


The pathetic appeal, instead of moving
the ruflian's pity, appeared rather to in
fame him to crime, and spurning the
PROSTATE, weeping woman aside with his
boot, the inhuman desperate took delib-
crate aim at the kneeling man and fired
The entire load of shot pierced Bakers
heart, and he fell toward, dying almost
instantly.


Smith coolly reloaded his gun, and with
his two companions walked away, all
firing their weapons in the air, cursln9
and shouting as they went. Smith, the
murderer, made his escape.


The killing of Baker has aroused the
neighborhood, and if the murderer is
found he will no doubt be lynched."

last night, and when it became eviden,
that an attempt would be made to lynch
him, Sheriff Holman resolved to protec,
his prisoner, and enforce the law at all
hazards, and surrounded himself With
q strong guard.


At 12.45 the mob organized iu the
rear OF the jail, and few minutes
later made desperate assault. Tney
we're met by Sheriff Holman and his
guard, who, after giving warriLg, fired
a volley, killing james Keely, and
wounding three or four others. The
dead and wounded were car ried away.
and the leaders OF the mob. after a
short consultation, decided to postpone
hostilities for the present. The lyEch

This morning the excitement was
intense every man, woman and child

shouting, some crying, and the more

On the opening Of the court on the day of the prisoners arrVal, the district attorney requested a venire issued for a territorial grand jury to investigate the case, which Judge Shields granted, {, returnable Saturday morning, so that the accused can be tried at this term of court In the present excited con- dition of feeling, thus is wise, as threats are freely expressed about lynching.

 On Thursday evening man ar rived from Walnut Creek, the scene of the murder, stating that the body of the man Jenkins, who his b-en miss ing for about two weeks, had been found in a guch behind Dllda's house. This shows. the brute to be double murderer, and excitement is so strong that it is feared lynching cannot be prevented."

Sunday is good day on which to read some
of the many apocryphal stories that are handed
down from the East to those whom the writers
deem credulous enough to accept their truthful
ness 1t takes great measure of charity to
read such with that liberation for which the
''rowdy West is noted and which is necessary.
unless the authors of such stories are to be
lynched. Take, for instance, the tale that comes
from Binghamton n Y, of a certain beaver
captured there after a record of hair-breadth
escapes by flood and fire extending over twenty
years. This particular beaver was first scared
up in the year 1874, on Mud creek, tributary
of the headwaters of the Chemung river, by one
Ben Patterson. This was the first colony of
beavers that had been found thereabout for
some years. Patterson set his trap and caught a
beaver every night for seven nights On the
eighth night a beaver escaped from the trab and
left one of its hind legs behind in it. And here
the romance begins He says that
it is popularity of the beaver family that if all
the members of colony but one are captured or
die the survivor will never again seek another
colony or follow the regular life of beaver, but
will become wanderer hiding wherever it can,
and displaying cunning ana sagacley that were
strange to it when it lived in a colony After
finding the beavers leg in his trap, and failing to
capture any more of the animals, Patterson
knew that he had taken all but one of the entire
colony, and that that one had become a crippled
wanderer. These solitary beavers were called
tramps by some trappers, and bachelors by 9th
ers. For five years Dir. Patterson found traces
of the bachelor beaver then his
brother Richard took the trail, but
lost trace of it in 1907 though up to that time il
had been heard of all over the valley. Two
years later he came across its trail again, and
followed it for miles down the stream. /,
finally quilted the Chemung. and was traced
in the wood for seven miles, when it was lost
track Of in another stream. 1t was identified as"

being made to brace them up that the yield

wreck was complete. Not a stick remained
standing, not timber remained
full in the entire row. Half
a hundred workmen were at work
in or about the buildings at the time. At
least thirteen of them were injured, none
fatally. 1t was said soon after the accident
occurred that twenty persons were buried in
the ruins, but up to late hour no body had
been found. The


EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE PLACE
was so great that it was difficult to obtain any
reliable information as to who might have
been lost, but the gangs of workmen en-
poyed in searching for the remains found
no clue to any object of their
search up to nightfall. The most superficial
examination Of the debris showed the
cause of the disaster to be wretched work
manship and poor material. The mortar
contained little or no sand but loan Or mud
instead, and was wholly unfit for use. This
and the fact that the building had been
erected during the cold weather, of vet and
frozen bricks, was directly the cause of the
collapse. The builder, Charles A. Budden-
sick, who was responsible, left the neighbor-
hood in a carriage Immediately after the
disaster and drove to his residence on East
Seventy street. Where he went
from there


NOBODY COULD LEARN.

 On ThcrsdAy there was a gala day for the cowboys. The first co"". puncher 10 essay the diffit ult but in- teresting task of roping. tying and riding broncho, was Francisco Mar tn. Five bronchos belonging to the exhibit of Mir. Toupsalnt were turned loose inside the fair enclosure and Martin started for them. john w. Lynch held the watch. Martin was successful Tn his first throw and bid far 10 make very quick time, but un- fortunately for him his rope was not last 10 the saddle horn and away dashed the broncho. Several inef. fectual attempts were made to capture the horse, The broncho easil, jumped every fence, ard despite the efforts ot a dozen cowboys started for the main entrance of the exhibition building The broncho was finally secured and brought back inside the enclosure. Martin gave up the scheme.

 The second contestant was Dick Greer, of Apache county, Arizona, md, by the by, he was the winner, llSo getting the prize of s4o which lad b;en subscribed by the stockmen. Greer caught the broncho by the hind eg, and soon threw him. The sad fling was scientifically done, and in us, I2H minutes Greer was riding he bucking broncho around the eIi- closure.

 The third to try the festive bron :ho was Nal Greer, of Arizona. He 'ot his horse in bad shape over near ne fence, and after working some lme to saddle him was obliged trough severe attack of asthma to i've it up.

Samuel Mallory, Charlie Mallory, Willie Hyde, Charlie Thompson and Charlie Bab- cock started for New York Saturday night on the steamer Northam. They will take in Coney Island and other noted watering places near the city and will take the Sunday night boat back for home, being ready to resume their different avocations this morn ing.

 There was nearly five hundred people at Howes' skating rink last Friday evening to greet the fairy skater, Lillie Sellew. She was received with great enthusiasm when she appeared on the rollers and her intricate and graceful movements were highly praised by all. The West Haven band never played

The restaurants, saloons and the flying horses, museums and all reaped harvest of nickels. The hotels Sea View and Beach House are comfortably filled.

 Ali and Jimmie at the Homestead never did better. They had their hands more than full getting up their celebrated shore dinners and suppers. The Herman House and Lucas House are doing remarkably well.

arrested while on his way to North river,
hearing Oh his body the mutilated corpse OF
woman who had been murdered. Inc
officer was attracted by the mysterious
movements of Francis. as he was weighted
down by his ghaStly BURDEN and he was
stopped to see what the bag contained. Inc
Frenchman refused TO give any information
and attempted to move on, but the poIlce-
man insisted on being Informed OF the con-
tents OF the sack and took Francis Ill Gus

the arm. vhereupon he dropped the bag
and its contents upon the sidewalk. 1t fell
with q smashing sound TO the sidewalk, and
the officer on opening the sack, to his sur
prise and horror. found that it contained the
mutilated body OF woman. The body
was doubled up and almost nude. The
policeman. ON closer examination, found
unmistakable evidence of the fact that the
woman


HAD BEEN MURDERED.


There were ghastly wounds upon the
face and the trunk from which the blood
had flowed and coagulated. In reply to
the officers questions Francis declared that
the cornse was that of lis wife, and that
She had died natural death. Being with
out means necessary for funeral, he had
resolved to carry the corpse 10 the river and
throw it in. The officer refused to accept
the explanation. Francis again Shouldered
the bag and bore the mutilated corpse to
the police station. He was placed under
arrest and steps taken to investigate the
supposed mysterious crime. FRANCIS IS
about thirty-seven years OF age and made
no attempt at an explanation When closely
questioned. other than TO reply that his
wife had died at their home on Tenth
avenue. and that he was about to throw the
corpse into the river on account OF his III

my wife afterwards lost. [ reprOached my
wife for losing him, and she swore at me-
At T:3O o'clock last night she sent
me out for beer. and when l came back L

shop with me- She sat on my lap and
kissed me- and then she threw a glass at
me and then a can. She then went out.
Then Welsh and l walked out half a block,
and then left him to come home. When

would revive, but she did not. | don't

before she died that she did not care for me,
but she liked the man who put up the wine
for her. He is Leopold Saconville, and he
lives with Mrs. Lynch, on Broadway.

and embroidered nightdress. About the
throat were lines of discOloration and marks

of the nall was wre cked. The explosion in
tue lobby Of the house OF commons occurred
three minutes later than the one in West
minister hall. 1t came from directly under
tue strangers gallery, and very close to the
seat usually occupied by Bradlaugh when
visiting the commons. The


LOBBY WAS COMPLETELY WRECKED,
the gallery torn down, the speakers chair
DESTROYED and the massive stone work dis
placed. The glass roof Of the house Of com

IN the house was stopped precisely at 2:13
p. m. \ heavy beam which formed one of
the supports Of the gallery, was projected
into the speakers chair, seriously injuring
Gladstone's seat, which was torn to pieces.


Another account of the explosion at the
tower gives the following details: The scenes
in and around the tower were inlescriblble.
Several children are among the injured,
their pale faces, bloody heads and broken
limbs reused the great crowd scongTegated in
the vicinity to frenzy. Yells were heard on
every side TO 'lynch the vilIians' ""roast the
iends."" All visitors confined in the tower
will be kept there until there anticedents are
inquired into.


WHAT THE POLICE SAY.


Col Magendi, chief inspector Of explosives,
in an interview this afternoon said the ex-
plosion was due to nitroglyccrine com pounds,
precisely similar 10 those used in previous
outrages in this city. He believed that
woman had charge OF the explosive APPARATUS
ut Westminster hall and the lobby Of the
house of commons.


The explosion occurred on the second floor
Of the white tower All authorities agree
that dynamite was used. The three floors
are thoroughly wrecked and the explosion
damaged many hundred stands of arms.


Lord Chelmsford and Gen. Mlman are
now engaged in the work of inspecting the
attacked structure. Some reports place the
number of persons injured by the tower ex-
plusion at four. Tue police have been or
dercd to be doubly vigilant.


6p. IN 1t has been ascertained that
large quantity Of explosive matter had been
placed inside the great ornamental gates
leading to the crypt under Westminster hall.
These gates were blown off their hinges and
thrown 10 the ground. An the windows on
the north and south sides OF the immense
building were blown 10 atoms. The con-
cussiou shook down from the grand oak roof
OF the hall tue accumulated SCOT OF
centuries. This, In its downward
movement, made dense cloud, so
That the officers on guard became alarm, 4
aud dared not enter the room in the lobby
The spiuters were four times thick as the
ilakes in a binding snow, aud were pro-
peilrd with dangerous force. They cut and
ripped the leather covering. and tore out and
scattered the horse hair from seats all over
the house. A mau who happened 90 be
standing upon the scat ldiug near the crypt
when the explosion occurred vas Knocked
forcibly to tue ground. The statues Of King
William "" and King George "". in West
minister hall, were overturned. The fact
that an unusual number of ladies' Wis ted the
parliament buildings to-day has created tue
suspicion that the miscrrauts who perpetra-
ted tue outrage were either women or men in
woman disguise. II is now remembered
by the attendants about the buildings that
parcels were carried by many women and
they seemed To bestow unusual care in
guarding them.


THE FEELING ~ THE CITY.


The city is in frenzied state Of excite
meut. The whole police force Is on duty,
aud troops in aud around the city are under
arms. Police patrols are stationed every
where IN close proximity 10 each other, and
curduus Of police are placed around all public
buildings. Chef superintendent William
son, oi Scotland Yard. personally inspected
the scenes ot the explosions, as have also
Inspectors Livingstone aud Kelly. one of
thr wounded policemen Is dying Several
men have been arrested, but they are be-
licvcd 20 BE- innocent Of any connection

case concealed under the long cloak of
woman whose appearance was thus made TO
resemble that of woman about TO become
mother. A woman in whom this appearance
was very noticeable was seen among the
visitors al the tower this afternoon shortly
before the explosion occurred. She was es-
cnrted by tall man with a military air.
Neither of them could be found after the gates
were closed alter the explosion, and when
the visitors came to be searched. 1t is sup
pos d the woman and escort escaped during
the rush that occurred just after the explosion
and before the gates were closed. the i'm
potent action of the police is generally ridi-
culed. An intense anti-Irish feeling was
caused by the outrage, and it is certain to
unfavorably effect decent Irishmen employed
or seeking employment in England. Vigil
lance committees and anti-Irish leagues of
employers are talked of. 1t is estimated, ac-
cording 10 the course and energy of the ex-
plusive employed in the house of commons,
that if the house had been in session, Glad
stone, Sir William Vernon Harcourt, Charles
Bradlaugh and 200 other members would
have been killed. The search OF the visitors
at the tower after the explosion occupied four
hours.


THE INJURED,


The number of those injured by the ex-
plosions is as follows: At the tower, six in
jured seriously, fourteen slightly. At the
parliament buildings, four seriously, ten
slightly. The worst injuries were received
by Constabes Cox and Cole and a civil en-
ori,, T., l,r;p x-is
liament buildings. Over 100 visitors were
in the house of commons when the explosion
occurred in Westminster hall. Most of them
rushed out of the building to ascertain the
cause of the report, and thus many lives
were saved.


NEWS OF SENATOR EDMUSDs' BILL.


The news of the introduction in congress
of bill by Senator Elmunds to prevent and
punish dynamite cons nspiracies in the United
States, has had a splendid effect in turning
aside the bitterness of feeling against
America which had been engendered by the
explosions.


THE CROWN JEWELS UNINJURED.


Count Won Munster. German minister to
England, aud the lord mayor of London
visited the scene of the explosion at the
tIaCi ALlS ENEulI2s II IdS Dccu dSccIldlntQ
that the crow jewels and regalia, which
have been for 4 long time deposited in the
tower, are unchanged. The noise of the ex-
plosion was preceded by a binding flash, fol-
lowed by great clouds of dust. Additional
guards were placed Tonight around the
tower, parliament houses and all public
buildings.


WHERE THE EXPLOSIVE WAS PLACED.


About sixty visitors were in the tower at
the time of the explosion. The explosive
agent was deposited in what is known as the
banqueting hall OF the white tower. This
hail is now used as an armory, and in it are
stored large numbers OF Martini rifles, which
were destined to be shortly issued to volun-
teers. 1t was behind q reck OF these that the
deadly pound was placed. The dynamite
played its maddest freaks with the rifles.
Many of them are twisted into the most &C.
centric shapes imaginable, and their distorted
forms scattered about the apartmentin a mar
vel of confusion. All glass and other fragile
articles in tue hall were smashed out Of all
embauce Of their former selves. a large
hole was crushed through the floor at the spot
where the dynamite was placed. Directly
overhead q similar hole was blown through
the roof. The wood work was set atire by the
explosion, but before any serious damage
had been done by the flames, they were ex-
tinguished.


THE POLICE PUZZLED.


The police are completely nOnplussed.
They are Incapable of even forming a theory
and appear TO be dazed at tEeir own inefii-
cheney to prevent such outrages or discover
their perpetrators when they have been COM
mitted.


DEMANDING VENGEANCE.


Popular indignation ran so high, and the
elamor OF the crowd for some one upon
whom to wreak vengeance for the awful
crimes OF the afternoon was so insatiate, that
the persons arrested on suspicion narrowly
escaped lynching when set at liberty.

THE FORCE OF THE EXPLOSION.


Remarkable force was shown by the explo-
sion in Westminster hall in its downward
direction, Holes were scooped in the ground
large enough to hold a man. Into one Of
the holes 50 formed Constable Cox was vio-
lently thrown, ami from it was tXtricated in
bruised and battered condition Two
other policemen near the scene Of the cxplo-
sion were not so seriously hurt, but they
were thoroughly stunned By the concussion

and it was impossible ior Col. Majendi,

 he had introduced us to each other my partner, Jenny, is going to quit this claim and attend to his other business, and shan want another man with me. Jemmy will still have share iu the wash ings, but not half, of course. Now, Squire Lester, have heard of you be- fore and your character is good; but if you were perfect str anger and the worst scallywag in the diggings, you saved my life last night, and you should be my friend. This is big claim; we have struck great lead, and you, Squire Les ter, are coming in as my partner""

 And this IS how became a partner in the first profitable claim"" had ever worked, and this was the commencems nt of my intimacy with Arizona Dan. But for hls great liking for me, which con- tinued unabated, and induced him to de. fer to me in most things, and to waive some of his peculiarities D my presence, we might not have remained friends for any considerable time; but seeing how thoughtful and considerate he was in his way, at last grew to like him much bet ter.

 This was by no means the case with Five Ace Jemmy, who divided his time between Big Trees Ci,y and another large camp at some distance, at each ot whi ch he had established gambling saloons, which were reputed to be of enormous profit to him. He came to see us at the Ild claim sometimes; but avoided him as much as possible, which was the easier to do, as he never cared to take any no. tice of me, whom he reg 4rded as a con. temptible, spiritless fellow, withou, enough brains or courage for either a miner or a gambler. Yet it was from him that first learned the great change that was coming, and had indeed come over Dan. Perhaps l was not so observ ant as l should be, but to me the big miner always seemed as rough, burly ana overwhelming as he had ever been. Jemmy, however, coming into our hur one day when l was there alone, asked after Dan, and ere could answer, said

 ""Oh, see him. He is talking to the boys n the Copperhead Gulch claim; reckon will go to him, for 1 want to see the boys myself l guess Arizona Dan will never see Arizona again not that he wants to he is New Jerseyman But he will join the mejority before next spring.

 {"" What do you mean P said. ""Wnat is there wrong about Dan? Heis quieter and more friendly with everybody than he has ever been.""

 No one doubts that, squire"" returned Jerhmy ""but he has got the bison in him. He's dead man. Look at him If you had seen him three years ago when he first came from"" He left of abruptly, as though he felt he was saying too much, and went out of the hut; but his brief speech had opened my eyes

 l saw then how snnken were Dan's eyes, and how hollow his cheeks, while his voice although still loud, was hollow also. My heart warmed to the man now l never had really liked him before, al- though had seen traces in him of better things than those on which his unpleas. ant reputation was built

 We were more together too; for this last-mentioned visit of Five Ace Jemmy was to arrange for his absence during a considerable time fron Big Trees. In plain language, he had so offended the miners, that they were resolved te lynch"" him if he did ne. leave or ""vamoose the the ranch"" as he phrased it. Hehad re- ceived strong hint of this, and as, in su case, even Arzona D ans courage and prestige would not help him-would, indeed, only provide two victims instead ot one-he discreetly resolved to go with out further ceremony. | Five Ace Jemmy quilted Big Trees that | very day. was glad he was gone, for l had always felt dislike of the man al- most amounting to dread. T could not help looking with increased | interest at Dan on his return to the | shanty, and as l did so wondered how the change, now so visible in him, could | have escaped my notice. He was so strange a man, although invariably friendly toward me, that scarcely knew how to speak to him on the subject.

 l 4d already made up my mind to do this. and that very night an opportunity ff.red. Dan was out late, as was often the case, and had lam down on what we called bed, aud was dozing when he came in. h lieu of throwing himself on his own buffalo robes and blankets, as was his practice, he sat for while over the fire, to which he added few sticks of wood for the nights were now cold.

Nature, however, has supplied the remedy which science has tried in vain to provide. The waters of Griffin Spring, Ark, will not only relieve, but will positively cure Bright's disease. It has been cured by the use of these waters, and so positive are we that they will cure in every in- stance, that we gHayantee a cure to all afflicted with Bright's disease or any other kidney affection, who will come and use the waters as advised. By ""guarantee !"" is meant that unless a cure is effected, the patient will be under no expense whatever while at Griffin Spring. Visit ors whose cases require it, will receive the best of medical attention from Dr. I. A. Krider, resident physician. As to the efficacy of these waters in kidney troubles, we refer te John H. Reslear, of Genoa, Nance Co.,, Neb., who, after suf- fering during several years with Bright's disease, was completely restored by three weeks visit to Griffin Spring. Wm. Allen, of Little Rock, Ark, suffered 37 years with kidney complaint. and was cured by the use of these waters. Hon. C. R. Breckenridge, M. C., Washington, D. C., Hon.

verdict last evening of murder in the second
degree. The bloody butchery was admitted

to lynch Henry when the building gave way.

In his opening to the jury the district at
torney promised to establish clear case Of
murder.


Mr.. Walker, for the defendant, promised
to establish case Of insanity and IRE
81 onsibility on the part Of his client when
the decd was committed


Lucy Williams, sister of the murdered
woman, was the first witness called, and
repeated the statements made by her before
the coroner as to the deceased, with her
children, living at the house of the witness,

the revolver on the bar with nothing in but
five shells. Lee said he was going to the
station house to give himself up, and left
the place. With the conclusion Of the ex-
animation Of the officers making the arrest
the government closed its case in chief.


The defense called Joseph Lee, brother

 Glittering generalities stand no chance Tn the face of statistics. For years the Northern papers represent ed the average Southefner as a man in slouch hat. It took . leng time to convince them that tho Derby and the tall hat were pot altogether un- known in this section. Southerners were also shown up IS profane swear CTS, whisky drinkers and outlaws. Gradually, however, the country has come to the conclusion that there IS more lynch law out West than in the South, and that the average South erner does not do any more swear

 ing than his Northern brother. As to whisky drinking, the fact shows that the South is the most temper ate section in the Union. Missis- sippi has 930 saloons, Minnesota, with about the same population, has over 5000 saloons; Arkansas has l,344 saloons; California, with about the same population, has 9,339 sa looms; old Bourbon Kentucky has 4,46I saloons. and Ohio 15.390. Startling as the statement may be, Tn proportion to the population, the North has twice as many saloons as the South. All this is very gratiiy ing. and the good work will be com plete when we establish the fact that the negro has | better showing in the South than anywhere else."

GIRARD, KAs., July TAT Baxter
Springs, Cherokee County, a girl four
teen years old was waylaid, ravished and
terribly maltreated on Saturday after
noon. John Lawrence, colored, aged
seventeen, was arrested for the crime
and brought to Columbus at night for
safe keeping. mob followed and in
some way young white man named
Wolf, one Of the party, was shot and
killed. Sunday morning the colored boy
was brought here and lodged in Jail.


When the train from Baxter Springs
reached here at noon yesterday, twenty
men got off near the station and scatter
ed through the town. Half an hour later
a number of armed men made a dash for
the Jail, broke down the iron door took

from interfering. The mob took the boy
about two blocks west of the jail and
hung him to the rafter of an unfinished
house, when one of them, said
TO be the father of the
injured girl, emptied his revolver into
the body. The participants in the mob,
after accomplishing their work, quietly
walked toward the depot and went south
on the railroad track in the direction OF
their homes. They attempted no dis
guise, and some were recognized
by citizens here. The raid was
so unexpected that people were entirely
taken by surprise, and those who did try
to interfere were kept back by drawn re-
volvers. The Coroner's jury holds ac-
countable as participants in the lynching

""reminiscences of Harry Ford.",,"6em1n1scences OF Harry Ford.


A Star reporter finding himself costly
seated in the Office at Ford's Opera
house, and Mr.. Harry Ford in a vein of
reminiscence, leo Mr.. Ford's mind back
score of years to the events attending
the assassination of President Lincoln
at the Tenth Street Theatre. ""The day
Of the assassination, said Mr. Ford,
Booth came down Tenth street to the
theatre, and stopped there to read let
ter. [ can very we'll remember seeing
him sitting on the steps outside. told
him then that President Lincoln and
General Grant We're coming to the
theatre that night I said that Presi-
dent Lincoln and General Grant would
occupy one box, and added as joke to
tease him that jeff Davis and General
Lee would be in another box. He de-
nounced General Lee very vigorously
for having surrendered the sword of
Virginia. That evening, after the per
formance began, he came to the theatre,
and as he passed the Office box, he looked
into the window, and, putting his arm
through, placed a cigar which he had
partly smoked on shelf inside, and
said, in a mock heroic bombastic furioso
style.


""'Who e'er this cigar dare displace


Must meet Wilkes Booth face to face


""Then he passed into the theatre"" +""


""Did he ever return for the cigar?n
asked the Star reporter


mo. Those were the last words /
ever heard him speak. He must have
said them to mislead Us, for his plans,
it seems, were already laid and it was
part of the plan, as heard afterward,
that Payne was to assassinate Seward,
Atzerott should kill johnson at the
Kirkwood House, and Booth shoot the
president simultaneously. So he knew.
just what he was going to do, and how
much time he had""


''Later i'll the evening"""" continued
Mr.. Ford, 1--WE heard pistol-shot in
the theatre. Joe Sessford and [ were
in the treasurer's office. We thought
at first that it was the pistol fired by
Asa Trenchard in the play-Laura
Keene was playing Our American Cous-
in; but then it struck us as little too
early in the evening. We opened
hot
theatre, and saw Booth crouching on the
stage with knife in his hand Even
then we could not tell what had hap
pened, and no one seemed to know We
thought at first that some one had in
suited Booth and he had pursued the
man across the stage. A few minutes,
which seemed an hour, passed before
the whole terrible truth was known""


You were among those who We're ar
rested, were you not 2"" asked the Star Re-
porter.


II was arrested, I think, on the Sun
day following the assassination, and
taken down to the old Carol prison,
fronting upon the capital grounds. [
was treasurer of the theatre, and my
brother, James r. Ford, better known
as Dick Ford was manager. My
brother, John Z. Ford, who owned the
theatre, was arrested at his home in
Baltimore after his return from Rich
mond. He had run down there to see
our uncle, mothers only brother, Mr..
VIM. Greaner. Nearly everybody about
the theatre was put under arrest-the
carpenter, the assistant carpenter, the
property man, and others. Nearly
every one around here professionally
related to Booth was arrested, and the
Virginia and Maryland farmers along
the river, who were supposed to have
assisted Booth in his escape in any way,
by harboring him, giving him food, or
shelter, or boats, were arrested, and
they were all semitic the prison where I
was. SO we had plenty Of company


did I enjoy it? Well I would not
have missed the experience for great
deal. It was rare mixture desert
ers, bountyjumpers. and prisoners Of
state, governors, legislators, and men of
every station. STILL it was rather
rough the first week. We were kept in
close and solitary confinement. Each
man had room by himself and was not
allowed to leave it or to see any one.
[ remember that when my brother
was brought IN [ saw him in the yard.
The guards would not let me go to him
or speak to him. After John T. was
arrested his family came over from
Baltimore. His wife applied to Secre-
tary Stanton for pass to go to the pri-
son and see him, but Stanton refused.
There we were left alone in our dun
geons in dreadful uncertainty I re-
member the day Of the funeral cere-
monies at the Capitol. I could see
nothing, but could hear the solemn
booming Of guns, the dismal beating of
muffled drums, playing dead marches,
and the steady tramp of feet. That
was not very cheering music for our
ears. We did not know but the
people in their excitement would mob
the prison and lynch US, for some of
the men arrested had been stoned in the
street. Our fare was coarse prison
food, soup and beans and dry bread.
Even this experience had its comic side,

League Says Leprosy Is Being Intro


duced Into the Departments by Them.


At a meeting of the woman's National In.
dustrlal League held pursuant to notice, the
following preamble and resolutions were unan-
imously adopted;


Whereas this league has witnessed with
alarm the increasing number of Chinese
loundries snringing up in our cities there
being moro than ility In Washington
bread is taken from widows Of workingmen
and soldiers who have heretofore found EN-.
ployment in doing the washing Of the towels
Of the government departments, thereby en-
abling them to earn scant living for them
selves and those dependent on thcm; and


whereas the laws Of Congress are very strln-
gent against the landing of the Chinese in this
country, as detrimental! TO the public good, q $
competitors for the labor which rlghtfully be-
longs to the female industrians Of the United
states, and as liable to Introduce into our
country that dread disease, lcprosy which has
bailcd the skill of the most eminent physi.
cinns OF all countres--a person afflicted with
which Is looked upon with horror by man.


Resolved, That thcact of robbing the soldiers
and workingmens widows of this city of the
washing, of the towels of the departments by
Secretaries Lamar and Manning and letting
out the same in the interest of Chinese laun.
dries merits our Just indignation and solemn
protest,


Resolved That the industrians OF this country
are entitled to the support aud countenance OF
the general government against foreign com.
petitors, such as the Chinese, and that the good
of the public and the health Of the country do.
mand that the Chinese laundries shall go and
that II becomes the duty of the administration
ana our lnw-giveTs TO recommend and pass
such laws that will protect the industrlais of
this country from the further encroachment of
these heather barbarians, and the community
from the Introduction by them of that hideous
and loathsomc disease known as loprosy, which
has been hitherto unknown in our land.


Resolved, That the encouragement given
these Chinese laundries by Secretary Lamar
Of the Interior, aud Secretary Manning, of the
Treasury, In letting out the washing of the
towels of their departments by contract-thus
benefting the Chinese aud subcoutractors-
cNcites the indignation of this league and
merits the scorn OF our whole people, irrespec.


Resolved, That copy of this preamble and
resolutions be sent by tho president OF this
members of the Cabinet, and speaker of the
House, and president OF the Senate.


The president, Mrs. Charlotte Smith, being
called upon TO address the league, responded
Chinese. In commencing her address, she
alluded to the recent eloquent remarks of
Archbishop Lynch Of Toronto, delivered on the
lepers of Tracade, n B. She described leprosy
as the most loathsome of all diseases. and drew
vivid picture of the terrors which would be
introduced In this country BY the Chinese un-
less they were driven from our land. Once
introduced here, 1t could never be eradicated.
The laundry would be the agent in spreadin &
the disease. II had already dono 30 In this


CITY, the victim being beautiful young lady,


whose friends, horror struck. hied her away to
some secret retreat, the locality her physicians
re iuse TO reveal, and also in Chicago, the phy-
sicians tracing the origin back TO n collar
coming from a Chinese laundry, the case being
that of young man.


Mrs, Smith here alluded to the false economy


Of the Secretaries In awarding the washing to
| the heathen Chinee to the exclusion of tho
| neutrality-suspicious. as being penny wise and


pound;ioolish. Independent OF the wrong in


hicted, the leprosy was liable to creep into the
| which our city would trembe. A thrilling
account was given by Mrs Smith of another
| Chicago case, In which customer of a Chinese
laundry was attacked with leprosy, and his
| friend visited the laundry aud found a hideous
| leper hid behind curtain iu the laundry


The sight was revolving. The Chinese, who
nursed and cared for the leper washed aud
ironed the clothes OF his customers until at last
| the unfortunate youth was given disease
which, under the, old law OF Moses, renders


him sight too horrible to look upon, and
acclrSed of God and man.


selfdefense, remarked Mrs. Smith, is the
| first law of nature, and If the government Will
not protect us from those people 1t is our duty
| TO protect ourselves, by submitting our solemn
| protest and appealing to tho manhood and
womanhood OF America to sustain US In ouI


demand that the Chinese shall go-carrying
| with them their diseases and forever free our


female industrians from competition which


would inevitably bring stavation to the homes
| of the labor element of tho country.


| pScolhcs tuc Imperative uuIy VI tlie inuu y
| trial element of the country, male and female,
to have some concert of action in demanding
| their rights of the administration and of Con
| gress. The time has come when we must
| work, not talk, and raise such din around


the ears of our rulers that will force them To
| grant tho industrians an equal show in all en-
| ployment meted out by the government
After alluding to the small reforms proposed


by this administration, and the injustice meted
| out to the industrial women by Messrs. Lamar
| and Manning, Mrs. Smith declared she would
| never cease to battle until the rights, privi
| leges, and immunities of women were placed
| on Il firm footing.


On concluding her address, this resolution


was submitted and unanimously adopted:
Resolved, That the thanks Of the Woman's
League are rendered the president, Mrs. Char
lotte Smith, for her admirable address, and
that the secretary report the substance thereo
for the public press"

LONDON, Jan PA favorite theory of the po-
lice is that the dynamite which coused the ex-
plosions in Westminster Hall, the House of
Commons and the Tower was carried to the
place in each case concealed under the long
cloak Of woman, whose appearance was thus
made to resemble that of woman about to be-
come a mother. A woman in whom this
appearance was very noticeable was seen
among the visitors at the Tower this afternoon,
shortly before the explosion occurred she was
escorted by tall man, with military air. Nei-
ther Of them could be found after the gates
were closed, after the explosion. and when the
visitors were searched. 1t is supposed the
woman and her escort escaped during the rnsh
that occurred just after the explosion and be-
fore the gates were closed. The impotent action
of the police is generally ridiculed.


All persons arrested during the afternoon on
suspicion of being implicated in to-day's
crimes were released this evening"" there
being no facts against them sufficient to
warrant keeping them in custody. The police
are completely non-plussed. They are incapable
of even forming'a theory and appear to be dazed
at their own ineficiency to prevent such out
RACES or discern their perpetrators when they
have been committed. Popular rage is high,
and the demand for some one on whom to wreak
vengeance for the awful crimes of the afternoon
was so insatiate that the persons arrested on
suspicion narrowly escaped lynching when set
at lihertv"
17_1885-01-25_p1_sn82015679_00414210089_1885012501_0211,The Indianapolis journal.,01,1885-01-25,p1,,,"also show that the explosives were operated from
a point somewhere on the inner bastion
or in the esplanade nearest the Thames
Tower It turns out that the police
were unusually prompt and successful
in placing their embargo upon all egress
from the Tower grounds, and but few persons
had left when the embargo was ordered. Extra
guards have been posted about the walls
Every person within was subjected to personal
examination. The report made by the explo-
sion was terrific 1t was heard for miles up and
down the Thames and at once attracted an i'm
nense crowd to the scene.


Later reports show that the first stories about
damage to the White Tower were somewhat ex-
aggerated. The White Tower building was not
destroyed and it is now said the structure was
not even seriously injured These later reports
tend somewhat to allay the public excitement.
If the explosion had really demolished the
White Tower, the result must have been inn
mensely more serious, for part of the building
was used for storage of rifles and often of large
quantities of ammunition. This fact makes the
popular indignation against the perpetrators of
the outrage indescribable


A large number of children were among the
visitors. Many of these little ones had their
faces and hands badly torn by broken glass and
flying splinters. The most piteous sight in the
large crowd Of innocent prisoners temporarily
detained within the tower walls was offered by
these little ones with their pale faces and bleed
ing heads The crowd outside the walls has
been wrought up to state of frenzy against the
perpetrators Of the outrage.


Another account of the explosion at the tower
says several children are among the injured.
Their pale faces, bloody heads and broken
limbs reused the great crowd congregated in the
vicinity to frenzy. Yells are heard on every
side to Lynch the Villians"" Roast the Fiends""
All visitors still detained in the tower, and
will be kept there until their antecedents have
been thoroughly inquired into


Colonel Majendie, chief inspector of explos-
ives, in an interview this afternoon, said the ex
plosion was due to nitro-glycerine compounds
precisely similar to those used in previous out
RACES in this city. He believed that women
charged the explosive apparatus at Westminster
Hall and in the lobby of the House of Commons.


The explosion occurred on the second floor Of
the White tower. All authorities agree that
dynamite was used. The three floors were
thoroughly wrecked, and the explosion damaged
many hundred stands of arms. The explosion
occurred exactly at 2 o'clock. Lord Chelmsford
and General Milman are now engaged in the
work of inspecting the damaged structure.
Some reports place the number of persons in
jured by the tower explosion at four No ar
rests have yet been made. The police have
been ordered to be doubly vigilant


Count Won Munster, German minister to
England, and the Lord Mayor of London, visited
the scene Of the explosion at the Tower this
evening. 1t has been ascertained that the
crown, jewels and regalia, which have been for
long time in the Tower, are undamaged. The
noise of the explosion was preceded by blind
ing fash, and followed by great clouds of dust.
Additional guards have been placed tonight
around the Tower, the Parliament houses and
other public buildings.


An Irishman giving the name Of Cunning
ham, but who is known as Dalton and Gilbert
was found among the visitors detained for
scrutiny after the explosion at the tower He
had recently from America, and, being
unable to give satisfactory explanation of his
object in visiting the tower he was taken into
custody and conveyed to police cell at White
chapel, where he will be detained until able to
give clearer account of himself


DAMAGE AT THE TOWER


About sixty visitors were in the Tower at the
time of the explosion. The explosive agent was
deposited in what is known as the banqueting
hall. This hall is now used as an armory and init
were stored a large number of Martini rifles which
were to be shortly issued to volunteers. 1t was
behind rack of these that the deadly COM
pound was placed. The dynamite played it's
maddest freaks with the rifles; many of them
were twisted into the most eccentric shapes
imaginable, and their distorted forms were
scattered about the apartment in marvel
of confusion. All glass and other
fragile articles in the hall were smashed out of
all semblance to their former selves. large hole
was crushed through the floor at the spot where
the dynamite was placed. Directly overhead a
similar hole was blown through the roof The
woodwork was set on fire by the explosion. but
before any serious damage had been done by the
flames they were extngushed

DR.. De La Matyr seemed to be the
only one present at the meeting who
really understood the situation. he
said he had made politics something Of
q study, and he had very little hope Of
any reform coming through the ballot
box.


DIR. De La Matyr is reyolutionist at
heart, and he should never compromise
with the principle by talking about
""electing good men,"" This remedy is
such negative good that no thoughtful
man can endorse it.


There is always at election times q
wide difference of opinion as to who are
the good men, and it is almost in
variably the case that the good ones be-
come bad after election. The trouble
does not lie with the individual, but
with the system. A system which makes
dishonesty profitable will make honest
men dishonest. Therefore the oppor-
tunitids for profitable dishonesty should
be removed, and where does the church,
with all its pretension stand on this !?


There must be arevolution of systems.
To accomplish this peaceably the people
must be educated in the true science.
When they fully understand the subject
then the Revolution may find express
sion in the ballot box, or otherwise; but
to prevent the impending forcible ex-
preston there must be an understands
ing of the truth. This understanding
will come when the people unlearn and
stop learning the false ideas of the past.

ger, living near Waynesboro, Franklin Co.,
Pa, was shot dead at midnight, during fight
with three men in his yard. Three young
men living near the Hollinger place were ar
rested for the crime, it being supposed that an
attempt at theft on their part brought on the
fracas 1t has since transpired that the three
persons under arrest are really the slayers Of
Hollinger, but that the motives which prompt
ed the deed are very different to what was at
first supposed. 1t appears that young Holm
ger had wronged girl named Alice Freeman,
who lived within a short distance of his home
and had driven her to desperation by marry
ing another lady. The injured girl told her
story to her brothers and Henry Ressler, who
was suitor for her hand, and thus melted the
men to commit the deed. Two attempts have
been made to lynch the prisoners"

There were all sorts of speculation as to who the successful candidates would be in the convention, but, as opinions varied SC widely. it was difficult to speculate with any degree of certainty regarding the final result The various candidates will look over the list of delegates this morning, and probably everyone will be able to figure out his nom1 nation on the first ballot-""in his mind. We submit the list of delegates for theil earnest consideration.

 FIRST WARD.

 SIXTH WARD.

 In this ward there was very lively fight, occasioned by Patsy Willis putting an oppo- sition ticket in the field with view of carry ing the ward in his own interest. As very Democrat expressed it last even ing: ""Patsy worked the ward for all it was worth and got most beautifully left, >"" and said he, 'Fit serves him right, for he helped the Republicans last fall and he ought to have been left"" There were 465 votes boiled in this ward, the winning ticket being elect ed by Al majority. Like many of the other wards it was difficult to find out who the delegates were in favor of, but one thing was plain and that was that they were not in favor of Patsy Willis.

 Following is the successful ticket:

TOmN-RMrma,",,"A very pretty wedding occurred here on Thursday the 17th inst, when Mir John Tone and Miss Katie Burns were united in the holy bonds of matrimony at St Patrick's church, by Rev Father Lynch. A large audience was present, composed of both followers of the church of Rome and many of the Pro- testant faith. The wedding party filed into the church at 1O.30 A.. M., during the playing of the wedding march on the organ, and were received at the alter by the officiating clergyman. The marriage service was then performed, after which High Mass was celebrated. The service was very impressive and the music was all that could be desired.

 After the ceremony the bride and groom were driven to the home of the brides parents, where an excellent col lation was served to the wedding party and their guests. A brother of the groom assisted as ""best man,"" and 8 sister of the bride made most charm ing bridesmaid. MT and Mrs Tone left on the evening train for short bridal tour. They will commence housekeep- ing immediately in s. w. Bradley's house on Prospect street.

 The happy couple were handsomely remembered by their many friends in the matter of presents, list of which is given below :- ...

 The red brick castle of Peletiah Petit grew was abla1e with brilliant illumina- ton when Webioot sought admittance through the welcoming porteullis. High revelry ruled within, and the spray of South Side wit and the foam of Aldine square repartee flew fast and furious over an hundred and odd of chattering youth. ful guests, the second growth timber of a certain cluster of Chicago's social forest.

 Miss lmogen Pettigrew was giving soiree. The affair was, ostensibly, gotten up for the debut of quartette of young girls who had been craning their necks forward toward this event for a year or eighteen months. scarcely had Webfoot entered the house when he vas twitched into a side room by his stately mother, who anxiously inquired if he had ordered the ice cream and confectionery. Web foot had done that very thing and was surprised to learn that it had not yet ar rived.

 ""The tables look just too lovely"" ob- served Miss Mamie Van Van de Van, advancing on the arm of Imogen, and throwing love-freighted glance a, Web foot.

 ""Then you must certainly remind one ofthe tables"" replied the youth.

 Mamie Van Van de Van and the com plimentary Webfoot had first met at Waukesha, when tbe robins nested last. The two were supposed to be deeply in love, and it was we'll known that they were engaged. The reason it was so well known is revealed by the fact that Mamie had impaited the secret to a dear and in- innate friend who had sworn never to re- veal it. It is true that Mamie had been particeps criminis in dozen or more other little affairs of the heart. One, es- pecially unfortunate and soul-snapping with boot and shoe man named Lionel Lemuel Lynch, in the course of which Mir. Lynch anticipated three months sal. ary and a large percentage of the profits of the firm.

 Lionel was given free ride to Joliet, and just as the broken up Mamie was preparing to get her to a nunnery, she again wandered deeply into love with a young man connected with the threads in a State street retail haberdashery Mamie was all ready to elope with this Chevalier de Safety-Pln, when he was ac- cidentally pulled out of a Clark street gambling joint per order of the vigilant Austin Doyle, chief of police.

 Let us enter upon the gay, the gay. the festive scene, the halls, the halls of dazzling lightr' said Webfoot, offering his arm to Mamie, who disengaged her self from Imogen, and the affianced couple moved of into the drawing-room.

 Their entrance provoked the usual indis tinct buzz of curiosity so frequently ob- served in large and ill-regulated assem- plies. A short. haired young man, with thick lips, was executing arias from Girofle- -GiroAa on the piano groups of animated fashion plates of the male variety lounged in attitudes intended to be strictly striking; the quartette of girls in whose honor the Pettigrew soiree had been given, was the center of an admir- ing, ogling throng, and for an hour afte r the entrance of Mamie Van Van de Van. and Don Webfoot Pettigrew, there was the copious flow of words and congestion of ideas peculiar to such affairs.

 Suddenly the animated, bee-like hum ming ceased. So unexpectedly fell the solemn hush that 6shy-eyed youth, the bow of whose tie was working around to the back of his neck, was heard to shout into the ear of deaf young man with red hair:

 When you knock down all the pins you make rampse.""

 But it was not this irrelevant observa- ton which renewed the now thoroughly excited buzz. It was the appearance of a strangely grotesque figure lmping down the center of the room arrayed in the very costume, the blue tights, the red doublet, the long -toed shoes and plumed hat of Prince Lore1z0 in the Mascotte."" 1"" Whoever the mystenous personape might be, he stopped and hoarsely muuered through the eye and nose-holes of his hideous mask:

 Bettina, bring me chair""

 No chair being immediately presented him, and no person seeming to be using the name of Beftiaa that evening, the figure luffed over to the port side of the room and growled 10 a consumptive young man in the fullest of full evening dress."

The other day his hebdomadal contained an atrOcious attack upon the people of Arizona and a laudation of the murderous Apaches. He abso- lutely ran riot in an insulting gloating over the bloody travail of the long suffering prospectors of the sun-kissed land, The article itself could only have been inspired by an aff1atus which arose from jug of very poor whisky. Pixley would sacrifice anything to a figure of speech, and he would surrender anything that most journalists regard as sacred for a successful entithesis. It is pity that a struggling band of the savages he loves so well cannot fall in with this extraya- gant fellow somewhere in the Chiricahua Mountains.n"

It will be remembered that the no- torious Polk boys. who have thus far escap- ed the Eallows for murdering a German Pcdler were in jail. Two unsuccessful at tcmpts had already been made by mobs to give them the benefit. of lynch law only z short time ago.

 Late Sunday right another mob visited tiic jail, armed and determined to shoot the prisoners, who were locked up in the cage. But they could not gea within range, and dc- termnod noc to be foiled this time, they in- yohod destroying element not heretofore employcd.

 Carrying to the jail pile of seasoned wood from point near by, the mob piled the wood about the iron cell CT cage, satua- ted t with oil, and then set the pile ou fire. The flames burned rapidly, md soon thc smoke penetrating the interior became stiff. ling. h few moments the iron was neat cd, and when the horrid work ended, both prisoners bad been literally roasted alive. Only the bare uasightg brick walls of the jail were left standing.

 The Polk boys had iaHlm.d tho whole community b. their brutal murder of Ger man peddlcr. And they had sacccoded in de- feating je.doo by obtaining second trial. Two previous efforts to mob them having failcl the third resulted as above stated.

 Mir. Ward, the pedler, who was murdered and his body burned in a pile oflogs, by the ""Polk boys"" was an Irishman, and a brother to Daniel Ward of this city.

 Mr. John Kelly, one of Murfrees- horo's business men was in town Wednesday and says the burning of the Polk boys in the jail at that place Sunday night was done by a mob of about l50 well armed men. The bodies of the two Folks were almost crematcd. MT.

""A Mysterious Ceremony that Fol-


lowed the commencement.


The class of 1885 Washington Normal school
graduated last night with all the eelat that
music, flowers, wit, learning, eioQnence and q
large assembly could give to such an event
The exercises took place at the Congregational
church, which was crowded with the friends Of
the graduates and friends Of the school gener-
ally. The platform, which had been enlarged,
was tastefully decorated with flowers. At the
back of it a large American flag was spread
The choir lott was occupied by an orchestra
directed by Prof Kaspar, which, during the
evening, rendered q number of selections in a
very artistic manner. At eight o'clock the
young ladies of the graduating class marched
out of the ante-room 4 at the. side of
tary precision to march played by
the orchestra. They took seats in
two rows Of chairs at the rear of the platform.
They were dressed uniformly in white. and the
group formed very attractive picture to the
young bachelors who Were sprinkled through
the audience In goodly numbers. Mr.. B. G..

MR.. LovEJOY REFERS TO MR. WILSON.


Mr. Lovejoy made a brief address, welcoming
the audience. He remarked that probably the
people OF the city had no idea a>how much the
board of school trustees depended upon them,
and leaned upon their moral support in a com.
munity which had not the right of seif-govern-
ment. The trustees had nothing to direct them
M ont the moral sentiment of the people, and it
for support. After referring to the sentiment
OF the age, in favor of the education of women,
ne SPOKE Oh the normal school as an institution
dedicated to the EDUCATION of women for the
great office for which il seemed God had pecu-
liarly fitted them. He expressed the hope that
the people of the city would always be the
Itlends ana patrons of the normal school. After
descending briefly the rise and rapid advance
ment OF the public schools here in late years, he
said: You owe all this more to one man than
70 any otner, and that man is to-day in a sick
bed In distant city. need not say that re-
Ter TO j. Ormond Wilson,"" This reference to the
Ia late s:uperlntendent was greeted with demon
stratiye applause.


Mr.. Lovejoy then introduced as the orator of
the evening


PROF. n. B. ADAMS,


OF J0hns hopkins university, who delivered
thoughtful and interesting address. His theme
was the study of history, and he gave many
valuable suggestions as to methods of making
hlstory q matter of live interest. During his
ADDRESS ne referred to women who have
acnleVed distinction in historical research and
writing, and the great bane in teaching history,
he SAID, was the excessive use of textbooks. He
condemned utterly the memorizing of what
stupid authors say about history, and not Civ
Ing the children chance to think about mis-
tory. He advised young ladies to make a study
OF the local histories their towns, to preserve
pecaliafitieS OF dialect, and make a record of
characters: Thus new life and interest could
bs infused into historical studies. After this
address the young ladies sang glee, commem-
orative of the House That Jack Built. and its
long train Of appendages.


CoNFERRING THE CERTIFICATES.


Prof. Bell was then introduced, and delivered
to the members of the class their certificates of
graduation. AS each young lady stepped for
ward to receive from Prof. Bells hand roll of
white paper, neatly fastened with a ribbon,
there was storm of applause The quarter of
the house in which the storm center was To-
cated, indicating very plainly where the young
adys particular friends We're seated. After
this ceremony, Prof. Bell spoke briefly. con-
graduating the young ladies upon the success

and bidding them God speed in their work.

HOW THEY LEFT THE STAGE


This closed the formal exercises, but an inter-
esting scene followed. The young ladies were
on the stage, and to most minds the question OF
getting them Oft again in an impressive manner,
without an awkward pause, would be a yery
serious problem. This difficulty, however. was
solved In avery graceful manner. While the
orchestra was playing the last number on the
rayed In white appeared at the foot OF the steps.
Each carried Il basket OF flowers with a card
attached, indicating for whom it was intended
THESE young ladies marched upon the stage
Each captured a graduate, presented her with
the basket of flowers, and then, taking her arm
escorted her down from the platform. The young
ladies who thus extricated the graduates from
what at hrst sight appeared to be serious di-
lemma, were the members of the class of 1854.

 Come out from your room to the gas he street. Do you mark that crowd upon the cornerf Let us go over there. There are angry words. A brutal man, flushed by po,atiOns loag and deep consumed throughout the day, strikes q woman in the face. Shame on the dasard man. hood of the beast who did the deed The woman reels, stagRers, gathers herself with supeThunlAn effort, and with bleod- shot. flashing eyes gases upon her cow asd!y assailant We pity her.

And righ, while our hearts are the fullest our sympathies the keen est, she uiters a word of reproach so vile, so disGraceiullY loa,hsome and disgust ing that we hasten on and leave her wal lowing in her degradation and her woe.

 But who made her what she is to- nigh,2 You, sleek and glossy hbeIline, flashing your wealth and the sign manual thereof in the diamond on your hand ?

 A New York Policeman Meets A

 Man Carrying The Body Of His

 Murdered Wife En A Bag To Throw

 1t Into The River.

 NEW YORK, May 20.-This morning about

 2:3O Officer Mccormick stood talking with a MT. Brown, who keeps store on Twenty eighth street, at the 1atter's door, when stealthy steps were heard leading down the opposite sidewalk, and the form of man carrying 8 heavy burden could be made out.

 The policeman and the citizen stood in the shade and were not observed by the stranger,

 who seemed to be looking neither to the right nor to the left Almost opposite the

 watchful pair he stopped and placed his bur

 den on 8 coal-box in front of a grocer's shop.

 It was canvas bag, stuffed to repletion with

 something that weighed heavily, for the man

 breathed hard as if overworked. From the

 open end of the bag on which he kept grip

 something protruded. The officer watched

 him in silence till he began

 to make ready to resume his

 walk. Just as he shouldered the

 bag once more Mccormick stepped acr6ss

 the street and laid heavy hand on his

 shoulder. ''What have you got in the bags'

 he said. The fellow turned without start

 and replied calmly: sI got my wife in the

 bag"" As he said so he swung the bag from

 his shoulder to the sidewalk with jerk, as

 one would throw bag of corn on wagon

 from No. BOT Tenth avenue to where Office,

 and thought might bury her that way. can't pay for a funeral"" The man spoke with French accent, but without excite

 ment. He was evidently neither drunk nol

 crazy. The policeman rapped for assistance Officer Derring replied, and when handear had been procured the body was placed on i and taken toward the police station in Thir ty-seventh street.

 Around the neck of the dead woman was silk handkerchief, twisted and tied in dou ble knot. There were marks on the throa which indicated that it had been used tt strangle her. An autopsy, however, was or dered to determine the actual cause of death The prisoner gave his name as Louis Fran cois, thirty sevan years old, 8 Frenchmal and by trade marble polisher. He said h. had found his wife dead on the floor wher he came in at midnight and decided t. throw her into the river rather than incu the expense and trouble of a funeral. Hi wife, he said, was a native of Pittsfeld Mass, her parents being French Canadians and her maiden name Selina Fehot. She was married in Pittsfeld to one Francois Oliver and she left Oliver and came to New York with him Francois). fI never lived happily with her."" he continued, land a few days ago found dog which I thought very val uable and brought the animal to the house expecting reward would be offered for it My wife lost the dog and I reproached he1 for it. Last night she sent me out fol beer, and when I came back I found William Walsh, shopmate, in the room with her. Soon after I had seated myself she sat on my lap and kissed me and after wards threw glass and can at me. Ther Walsh and I walked out and when I re- turned found her on the floor dead. That's all know"" From the neighbo1s of the couple it was learned that they quarreled constantly and last night at 10 o'clock Fran cois came home and made much noice by his loud and angry talk. MT. Mcbride, who lives in the rear house over the Frenchman heard it, but paid little attention to it, the thing being of common occurrence. Half al hour later Francois was heard to go out and in several times through the hall. WheI the tenements were quiet he went out. Il was midnight when Mcbride heard him re turn and heard noise as of heavy fall il his room. Then all was quiet. Two hours | later Policeman Mccormick met him carrying ! the body through the street. The rooms o1 ! the pair showed no evidence of struggle.

 BALTIMORE, Md, May 2O.-The trial of Howard Cooper (colered) for feloaiously as- saulting Miss Kate Gray in Baltimore county some time ago began to-day. Fearing an attempt to lynch him on his way to the court house Cooper was taken from jail to court early this morning. At 10 o'clock it was discovered that the court house was sur rounded by Baltimore county people await ing Cooper's arrival and when they learned that he was safely inside their indig- nation was boundless Cooper was guarded When Miss Kate Gray was placed on the stand, there was a sensation. She is very pretty girl about twenty years old. She told her story amid tears and sobs and moved the jury greatly. She described the spot where the assault was made upon her as lonely, gloomy place between her fathers home and the railway station to which place she had accompanied her sister Sallie On the way back she met Cooper, spoke to him and passed on She then told how Cooper followed and beat her with club. She was freed from the villains grasp only by the appearance of her faithful dog Blanco.

 The next witness called was the father of the young lady. His testimony was as to how he adfonnd his daughter lying on the porch with blood pouring from her wounds. Dr. H. Lewis Naylor testified that upon ex- animation he found many bruises upon Miss Gray's face and her whole body bore marks of violence. He found injuries that indispu- tably established the essential element of criminal assault, but not complete accom- plishment of the brute's purpose.

 The defense offered no evidence. The ar guments on both sides were very brief. The case was given to the jury at p. m. They rendered verdict of guilty without leaving the box. The prisoner shouted out, ''Your honor, am guilty, but only of beating"" The verdict was secured with manifestations of delight. Counsel for defense took an ap- peal, on account of which sentence was de- ferred. Rape is 8 capital crime in Maryland and Cooper will therefore be hanged.

Idaho Sherif;s and Lynchcrs Confused 6y


TIof",,"Their Nun.6er.


AMERICAN FALLS, Idaho, Feb. 1.-The
presence of six Bill Joneses in this camp
caused much trouble the other day. Old Bill
Jones had been here ever since the country
was opened to settlement. He is looked up
to everywhere. Everybody knows him, and
he knows everybody. He keeps saloon,
and sometimes de ais card or two as well as
buys dust from strap ped miners at small
shave. Old Bill Jones hasn't an enemy in
the whole territory, and if he had he would
never rest until he or the enemy mad quilted
the world or the territory.


One alter another five other bill Joneses
put in an appearance. For a long time
everything went well. They were all fine
fellows, evidently, and no great
trouble was experienced by them
or anybody else in preserving their iden-
tty. But one day last week the sheriff and
four men came in on horseback with a war
rant for the arrest OF Bill Jones. The Bill
Jones wanted had murdered family of en-
igrants over in Paradise canon, and the
court Lad sent for him. AS old Bill Jones
was the Bill Jones, so far as American Falls
and its people went, he was at once pointed
out as the man, aud tae sheriffs officers
rounded him up in good style. Old Bill pro-
tested his innocence and would have offered
resistance If he had seen any encouragement
in the faces of his friends. 1t was plain that
the majority of them had a suspicion that
The old man was caught at last, and con-
sciousness of this fact broke his heart. He
went off with his captors, protesting his in
nocence and swearing that he would get even
with somebody on his return.


The cavalcade had not much more than
vanished over the mountains when another
sheriff's posse came in from the west, also in
quest of Bill Jones. The first one that came
TO hand was the Bill Jones who tends bar in
the Star saloon, and he was accordingly
taken in charge. He protested his inno-
cence, like the old man, but the people were
pretty evenly divided on the question of his
guilt. Old Bill had been taken east, aud
this one was carried off to the west. The
next afternoon. while most of the settlers
were discussing the fate of the two men,
rattle of hoofs was heard, and a party Of
horsemen dashed madly through the town,
stopping at one of the saloons long enough
to get drink.


The crowd rushed over to see what The
trouble was, and found that the men had
Bill Jones, murderer, in charge, and were
going to lynch him up in the timber. JUS
tice of the Peace Fallon here spoke up and
said there bad been two Bill Joneses taken
out Of this camp in the preceding forty-eight
hours, and it might be that some horrible
mistake was being made. All he wanted
was to have the right man caught, and he
would pull as hard on the rope as anybody;
but until that point was settled, he thought
there should be no lynching. Others made
bold to express the same opinion, and the
lynchcrs, after comforting with one another,
agreed, the whisky was good, to wait here
few days with their prisoner and inyesti-
gate.


Last Monday old Bill rode in with brand
new rifle, two revolVers and bowie knife,
and dared the whole town to jump on him.
He was the maddcst man seen in Idaho since
Big Ed Larrabee ran off with Tom Beldcn's
bride, at Toms house warming, when Tom
whipped all the guests and shot two Of their
horses. Nobody wanted to fight old Bill, and
the whole town kept in the houses while Bill
galloped up aud down the street, yelling and
swearing. After while he began to shoot
in the windows, aud then the justice was
sent out as peace Offering. Old Bill came
very near riding him down, but at last he
sobcred off little, and listened TO what Fall
lon had 10 say. The justice explained mat
| tiers the best way he could, and told how Bill,
the bartender, had been carried of, and Bill
the cowboy, was held a captive up at tile
other end Of the town by party OF lynchers.
This molliied the old man to some extent,
and, after a moments reflection, he de-
clared that II the boys would help him rescue
the Cowboy Bill and then round up all the
Bill JUneses in the vicinity he would find no
more fault.


All decided TO do as old Bill desired. AZ
ter little preparation party OF determined
men MADE a raid on the lynehers, captured
Cowboy Bill and drove the lyncherS out OF
town. Then old Bill demanded that all the
other Joneses be brought before bin. This
took some little time, but the next day the
five other JOnescs we're in conference with
old Bill at the Ophr saloon, when the sheriff
who had arrested old Bill came in With
stranger, who said bis name was Bill Jones.
No one had ever seen him in these parts be-
fore. and he was the offender whom all the
officers and lyUChers had been after for
week previous. 1t was all that the old man
could do to keep the other Joneses from lay
ing violent hands on him. When he and bis
keepers had passed on old Bill made speech
something like this:


There's too many Bin Joneses in this
camp Tor comfort, and something's rot 10 be
did 10 keep things sgoin' right. Now Pm
here frst and I'm the oldest man IN the
camp for money, and my name is Bill Jones.
As an honorable title, to be used by you boys
or not, jest as you please, you
can call me Old Bill Jones If you
want TO, but Bill Jones plain and simple is
my name, You, now, Bill Jones (referring
10 the hartenderJ, I'm going to christen you
Bill Jones Alcohol, and that's your name
from this time forward. You, Bill Jones to
the cowboy your name is Bill Jones Puncher

Ito a prospector and whisky driuker not over
four feet tall), your name is Bill Jones Short.

names has got me TO fgnt anu want the
camp to understand It, too.n


All hands agreed that the christening
was proper; that they understood 1t all per-
fectly, and that there would be no further
trouble. The old man is now having painted
for his saloon sign bearing the Inscription
in red letters three feet high,

pointed out New York's un.American
'emnence in evil, and called it hot bed

large city in America but Chicago, to
produce such street scene as that tele.
graphed to us last night from that ex.
emplary metropolis.


Two ruffians fell into a brawl on the
sidewalk. A friend interfered, and was
fatally shot. The fight went on. A priest
arrived and conducted the rites of his
church over the dying man on that por.

lynching as the killing and wounding
and the sacrament went merrily on.
Then the fighters we're mobbed, and
finally policeman arrived on the scene
to add variety to it, and began clubbing
everybody.


If this scene had been arranged in a
Chicago melodrama for theatrical pur.
poses they would have called it tran.
script of New York life. Asa matter OF
fact it was peculiarly Chicagoese. We
are prepared to assert that there is only
one Chicago, and that it is located Mt the
lower end and on the west shore of Lake

was arrested at Council Bluffs yesterday for
arson committed Thursday on the farm of
Donald Stuart, near Walnut, Iowa. Tho
property was formerly owned by Nevile's
parents, but became involved in litigation
and was lost, one Stuart buying 1t at a
sherin's sale. Neville has telt sore about
the matter ever since, and Thuridsy after
noon he started for Stuart's place with the
intention of burning 1t.


He was followed by several farmers. He
drove them all back by firing five or six
shots fiom Winchester rifle, and then set
fire to Stuart's house, barn, Outbuildings
and hay stacks, holding tho crowd at bay
with his rifle until the buildings were de-
strOyed. Neville then escaped TO his faith
er's house. barricaded the doors and win
dows, and prepared for siege. Constable
Sankey summoned large posse and sur
rounded the house, keeping watch on it all
night.


1t was a bright moonlight night, and
whenever one of the watchers got within
range, Neville fred at him, dispensing
about forty bullets during the night, iniur-
ing no one, however. The watchers also
used their revolvers and rifles, and at mid
night Neville called out that he was
wounded and would surrender. He was
slightly wounded in the leg, He was Sc
cured and brought in under strong guard.
There was disposition to lynch him, but
cooler counsel prevailed. Neville is Be-
lieved to be crazy."

From our Special Correspondent.

 Nrn OnIEANs Ian. 22. lSS",,"all located together under one ! roof, which covers sixteen acres, and while each State has her sep arate exhibit the varied production indigenous to the United States combined, forcibly impresses one with the unlimited resources of our fair land.

 Virginia, the mother of states, has for commissioner, Hon. w. W. Kinney. The old state is up to the average in display, and with even a few of the staples common to her soil gives evidence that she inn proves by age. Her two prlnci- pal productions are peanut and vel low leaf tobacco. The peanuts had it's birth in this state and al most the entire crop is grown on her coast. Richmond the capital, Danville and Lynchburg, the rival. tobacco cities, send many credita- ble specimens.

 Montana is yet a territory with hopes of early admission to states hood. Col Harris is the comm is sioner, and he brings a splendid display of her natural product ions. Although, Montana is noted for growing cattle and sheep, her principal interests are mining, and the display of ores are superb and attracts universal attention. The arranging of this exhibit was done by John Nye, an old pioneer of the mining country, he. knows rock where he sees or handles 1t Some ornaments of Indian origin attract much attention. In this dis play there are some fine teXldermy specimens shown.

 South Carolina, fsitb A. r. But ter as commissioner, has gotten up it's exhibits in good shape. The guano manufactory of Wilcox, Gibbs & Co.,, who show a pyramid some twenty feet from the base constructed of phosphate rock, is an enterprise that has done much to enrich Charleston. The agri- cultural productions and fruits dis played, keeps tine little Carolina to the front in this line. Though it does not claim to be an extensive manufacturing state, 1t has some very creditable displays of home productions. h cotton it produc- es a fine staple notibly the Sea ls- land, which always commands q good price. Specimens arg on eX- hibition.

 Many of the relics of the Greedy relief party have been placed on exhibition in the State department. Dummies are dressed up in the clothing worn i'y the men, and the old tent they used is erected, while the entire camping outfit is on view. The small boats from the Chetis and Bear, which first reached the Greedy sufferers have been placed with these much.viewed curiosi- ties. It is hard to realize in a land where snow is unknown what suf-

 fering and death the Or eely Relic exhibit represents.

 On Sundays the Exposition is largely attended, the entrance tct' being then reduced to 9 cents. On fine day there are liable to be fifty thousand present. There is everything to see as on any week day, except the working of the ma shinery, which is always shut down on Saturday night till Mon day morning.

 The Commissioners and mem bers of the press are unanimous in urging thelr respectives leGiSla- lures to make eXtraappropriations to carry out the successful exhibit of each state and territory. The necessity for money is evident to keep the exhibit up to it's present standing as many articles are per iShab,e, consequently the pride one has iu his state or territory should encourage each and all to advO- cate the contribution,

 When you take into considera- ton the fact that the different buildings cover 92 acres, or one third more than the Centenial and that the park in which they are To- ca;cd and which is now enclosed composes about 500 acreSs. You can see how hard it is to estimate the daily attendance, and the man agement refuse 10 make public the daily receipts, for what reason your correspondent is unable to state.

 At first it was feared that the means of transportation between the grounds and Caual street. the center of the city, would not be adequate to accomodate the public"

EDITOR NATIONAL REPUBLICAN: The :
Breakfast Table letter published in TIE ,
REPUBLICAN on the 9th instant refers !
to and in a measure, discusses one of the


most important political questions which


this nation has to solve. refer TO the


negro labor of the southern states, and


the protection IL is to receive through his


exercise Of the elective franchise. All


history teaches that II ones interests are
4 TO be protected, he must be the protector.


II was in view of this truth that the Re-
| publican party, in the reconstruction OF


the rebellious states, insisted that the


right OF suffrage should be conferred upon


all citizens, to bo enjoyed equally without (
regard to color or previous condition of .
servitude.


Labor is the ordained means by which
all the necessaries, comforts, aud luxu-
ries of life are to be produced and en-


joyed. Without IL there can be neither


individual nor national prosperity. Let


1t cease for a day, and there would be


universal stagnation and death. Yet


few like to labor. Most prefer rather to


live by the sweat of other mems brows


than by that of their own. The effort to


live and accumulate by tho labors Of


others has given birth to tyranny,


slavery, monopolies, and all the oppres.


sions which one class has suffered at the


hands of another class To protect them


selves against these efforts those who


labor must have power to resist them, and


there is no such power in this country


but tho ballot and the intelli genco to use


II. The freedmen arc the principal la


borers OF tho south, and though, In theory,


possessed of this power, practically they do


not enjoy It, Through the machinery


adopted in nearly all OF the southern


states, for the holding and superinteud-


ing elections and determining the results,


the power Is placed in tho hands Of the


property, non-laboring class by force aud


fraud to thwart the will OF the laborers


as expressed by their ballots, and this 10


done unhesitatingly whenever and wher.


ever this non-laboring class deems IL for
! its interests. 1t is this machinery that
makes the south q unit in all Presi-
: dental elections. 1t is this machinery
that puts all the southern state govern
I ments under the control of the non-labor-
ing property class Notwithstanding the
, laboring class forms q large majority.
This explains why there has been so much
, legislation in those states for the benefit
/, and security Of property owners and not
! any for the laborers. This Is the reason
, why lynch law in those states runs riot,
} and that We rarely hear of colored man


there charged with high crime boing tried
. by court and jury. This Is tho reason
: why freedmen in those states do not and
dare not bring suits against white men to
: secure their rights OF person aud prop
' erty. There is among southern people a,
Kind feeling for the negro, and also n
: knowledge that it is for their interest to
o keep him as u laborer, and II Is this feel
Z ing and this interest and not the law that
y give tho negro the little protection that
u he has, but this is extended TO him SO


long only as ho occupies menial posic


tion, or, as they express 1t, Keeps hiC
place."" 1t Is still truth that all kind oi
}. labor performed generally by negroes IL
IL considered degrading, and whenever per,
g formed by white people those performing
a II are regarded socially as Oh the same
o level with tho negro. The greatest boon
g that could be conferred upon tho southern
Is people would be a gospel which they
10 would accept, and which should teach
Is that all honest labor is honorable, and


that in its performance, interest, duty,


and patriotism are all combined.


y Neither labor nor laborers can be de-
s. graded in one part of the country with
ie out the same pursuit and operators feel
u, ing the stigma more or less in other parts.
l. The laborers, therefore, of the northern
~ states have special and deep interest In
OF the elevation of tho laborers of the south.
lp orn states To effect this the freedmen
Is must be secured


1. In the practical exercise of the cleo


tive franchise.

space in your very valuable paper to re-
ply to an article that appeared in the
Tribune Republican, that great friend OF
the laboring class, entitled Labor and
Anarchism."" These poor laborers are a
very foolish setof fellows there is little
doubt, or they would select one of the
editors of that great friend of the people
as an officer to manage their organiza-
tions for them. But we presume we
know our leaders, or at any rate think
we do, and we select them not to man
age the Tribune-Republican but to rep
resent the labor movement 1t has
always been the plan of the men that
paper represents to throw dirt at our
leaders, but that plan never worked sue
cessfully J; try again gentlemen. Anarch-
ism is an outgrowth of the same perni-
cious system that has so successfully
despoiled the Iaborer of the fruit of his
toll, and to talk to poor men of redress
by the ballot is all moonshine, in fact
we have abandoned all hope of ever
righting our wrongs by that means. We
have been using the ballot now for oyer
one hundred years to elect men to look
after our rights, and to see that the
strong do not oppress the weak, and
every fresh congress has only made our
oppression greater, and plunged us
deeper in the gulf of despair. The sys-
tenn that will enable Jay Gould in a lit
tie over thirty years to accumulate $780,.
100000 without passing law to prevent
further stealing in that line is one of the
things that gives rise to Anarchism.
What is it that gives rise to lynching
that has become so common of late-be-
cause juries fail to convict for willful
murder, and the law to punish with
death is evaded, so that the people take
1t into their own hands and see that it is
is carried out. Anarchism also arises from
lawmakers failing to prevent stealing
under cover of law, and the strong from
depressing the weak. A little dynamite
now and then tends to awaken the pub
lie conscience as nothing else will. When
men are driven to desperation and de-
spoiled. of their right and in need of
bread they are not in fitting frame of
mind to discuss the merits of the eighth
commandment. / am glad to see the
Tribune-Republican/ admit that our
rights have been invaded and that they


will soon be r stored. We hold to that
doctrine ourselves, but they. will not be
restored until we are in a position to
take them by force. 1t Is true that a
timely concession on the part of our de-
spoilers may prevent dose of dynam-
tie being administered by some over
jealous friend of the cause. But we are
not dynamiters. There are a few in the
country cannot be denied, and as long as
they only practice upon John Bull our
millionaires will not complain. That
the laboring men are in dead earnest l
am sure. and If the men sent to the legis-
iature do not look after our interest bet
ter than they have done In the past we
shall feel like taking the matter up our
selves and see what we can do in that


line of business without their aid God
is moving nations, let us read the signs
of the times Alright, and not say peace,

be none until labor shall receive Its just


reward, and man be of more value than

and were received very cordially At fret.
Plaisted was spokesman, and advanced
toward the President with a huge pile Of
papers. Carefully unfolding them, and wip-
ing the perspiration from his brow, be-
gan his speech Soon be waxed eloquent,
and as if addressing a jury, roared into the
ear of the President and sawed the air with
his arms until he grew red In the face The
President kindly interrupted him, and iu-
formed him that the only question was ~ to
the qualifications and Recommendations Of
Morton. Plaisted paid no attention to him
but continued in q still louder voice, and
capped the climax by reading extracts from
Morton's paper about Cleveland's Buffalo
escapsde, to show that they were quoted. and
several other editorials from New York
papers which touched the President in q ten
der spot. His tace grew red. He turned
and turned in his chair, but Plaisted went on.
Some Of his friends tried to catch his coat
tail and stop him. But Il was no use. He
was bound to finish his speech.


The President stood it ss long a. he could,
suu uuSuy, Wuite Win anger, JuWpeu 70 uAS
feet and said: ""Gentlemen, | have given
you now more time than ought to, and you
must go now. If you will leave the papers
here, will read them if IL takes me all

With this barst Of anger he left the room.
and the Maine visitors slowly filed out in .
daEed condition. and repaired to their hotel.


This ended the interview with the Presi-
dent--an interview long TO be remembered by
the participants No one save Plaisted said
a word. They filed in and filed out like cul-
prits. The papers of the next day said that
the Maine delegation was most cordially re-
ceived by the President!


The President has already minated his
desire not to appoint Morton, but has given
no reason save one-that he docs not wish TO
appoint man who cannot be confirmed.
There seems to be but little doubt that the
Maine senator's have expressed their opinions
to Villas, and that the President respects
them. Some of the Maine democrats here
have ascertained from Col. Lamont that the
President will not appoint Morton unless
something new comes up. No one bur Plais-
ted has much hope that Morton will get 1t.
while he (Plaisted) Is all hope. He is dis
gusted that the President should once think
of yielding to what he calls senatorial dicta-

ing the past week on account of the strike of
the street-car employees, which has resulted in
an entire stoppage Of the cars. All kinds OF
Instructions bricks, paving stones, barrels, ETC.,
were laid ON the tracks and the crowds as
sembled around the car stables have prevented
the vehicles from emerging. A large number
of extra police have been sworn in and occa-
sionally the tracks would be cleared and a car
load of policemen would 60 down the line, but
no passenger travel took place. The mob was
disposed to be orderly and no actual violence
on its part occurred. There were great num-
Der of arrests, and on Saturday one man was
killed by the police and several others severely
injured. On that day determined effort was
made to start the traffic. Ten cars, denuded of
windows and loaded with policemen, started
from the stables. Meanwhile the strikers had
sent word along the line, and in few minutes
the tracks were covered with rocks, dirt and
other distractions. When the cars started
policemen rushed on the crowd and tried to
clear the tracks. Capt. Bonfield, of the Chicago
police force, rushed out, and, with an oath,
commanded everybody to fall back to the side
walk Patrick Conley, an infirm man. 65 years
old, was standing on the outskirts of the crowd.
He turned to obey the order, when Bonfeld,
without a word, dealt him a terrific blow on the
back of the head. The old man sank to the
ground senseless, when James Mcnamara, one
of the striking drivers, said it was an outrage,
when he was at once struck over the eye by
Bonfield. The two wounded men were carried
to neighboring drug store. Bonfield then
called out: ""Shoot down like dog the first
man or woman who throws a stone."" The
mob groaned and cheered, but no violence was
offered to the police, who reluctantly COM
menced to clear the track of distractions.
Meanwhile the strikers in other parts of the
city were obstructing the tracks. Later on in
the day Conley, the old man who had been as
saulted by Bonfield, died. This caused the
greatest excitement and threats of lynching
against Bonfield were made. He is under ar
rest. At the time of going to press the situa-
ton is unchanged, the strikers still having full
sway."

The Maryland Central road suffered heavi-
ly by the flood of Monday. Several of the small

foundations damaged to such an extent that it
was dangerous for the trains to cross them. There

as speedily as possible. Such unusual rain storms
always cause much trouble on new railroads.


The worse than silly rumor set ahoat in
Towsontown on Friday of last week that body
of colored men was coming here that night to
mob the town in retaliation for the lynching of
Cooper, caused some little excitement and a few
citizens held meeting to consider the matter.
They were misled, of course, and they don't like
to hear anything said about that meeting now.
This was perhaps the most utterly absurd rumor
ever set on foot here and that any one should
have attached any Importance to it is entirely
beyond our comprehension. The whole thing
was well-concocted lie but so fimsy that any
one with his wits about him should have been
able to see through ieat a glance.


Those Baltimore reporters who dashed out
to Towsontown in hacks between l and o'clock
on Saturday morning last to record the terrible
slaughter which was to take place here that night,
must have seen that somebody had played big
joke on them when they got here and found the
town as quiet as Greenmount Cemetery. Some
of them had the good sense to say nothing about
it, but the Morning Herald man, with desire to
make mountain out of a mole hill, strung to-
gether lot of the most brilliant lies we have
seen in print lately and published them in Sat-
urday mornings edition, to the infinite amuse-
ment of the people of this place. Towsontown
will vote that reporter a very fine leather medal,
he having won the distinction of being the cham
pion liar of the age."

here last week about proposed ""raid"" on Tow

Baltimore papers connecting the camp with the
absurd stories which appeared in their columns

took occasion to say that the reports not true

Rev. Mr.. Scott is highly respected colored

Hartford turnpike, at the Little Gunpowder Falls,

saved his life by climbing tree. The bridge
over the same stream at Deiter's Mill, on the
Phiadslphia turnpike, was lifted from its founda-
tion, and the piers of the new B. & o. bridge,
near by, were damaged.


Hanway's wooden factory, on Winters run, six
miles from Belair, was swept entirely away and
the loss on building, stock, &C., &C., will reach
near $4,000.


1t is said that nearly every mill dam and bridge
on Deer Creek, Winters Run and other streams
were swept away. Deer Creek is said to have
been higher than ever before known.


Mr.. Jos. r. Wetherall, whose store and dwell

""Well, replied her husband, Eff the child is any hungrier'n am, an wants this popcorn more'n do, he ought to have it"" But he kept on eating it himself and never a grain did the child get. Pretty soon the little fellow began to cry for the corn. This may have annoyed the father, be- cause he soon arose, put the popcorn up in the rack out of the child's reach and went into another car. While he was gone the child continued to cry and reach after the banquet, and the mother took the popcorn down and gave some tc the little one. While this was going or the mean man came back. Furious You never saw anything like it. Ht snatched the popcorn away from tho child and poured torrent of abuse upor his wife for daring to touch his popcorn Then he put it back into the rack and a intervals got up and ate some of it unti it was all gone.

 Now, in a case of that kind-and tht above is a truthful narrative of an actua occurrence-is not lynch law justi6able Is not that kind of man more valuabl, and useful as a fertilizer than anything else ? Isn't he curse to society as lonl as he lives? And might he not prove blessing to the medical student and bar ren land when he dies Then why no kill him and make blessing of him

 The world has no use for a mean man A drurkard, liar, a swearer, thief, tramp, a swindler, murderer may hay good traits and have some sphere o usefulness in this world, but mean man pure and simple-God wasted muc when He made him."

 Upon 8 Suspicious Character.

 MOLINE, H., June 7.-Henry Marrs is a spruce darkey about forty-fve years of age who has long been character in Moline on account of his eccentric habits. He always dresses in loud style and was prominent among the colored brethren in politics, reli- zion and society. He has made himself very objectionable to many citizens by his coarse ways and conspicuous manner, and it is said he has led life not noted for morality. He was acquitted in local court yesterday of the charge of criminal assault and indignation began to run high. Soon after midnight the fire bells were rung in different parts of the city and at this signal several hundred peo- pie were called to the street. Some fifty men and boys rushed to the quarters occupied by Marrs, made him captive and carried him to the street. Fearing lynching, he continued the widest bowling.

 The mob placed Mars in wagon and he was driven to the outskirts of the town where he was covered with tar and bag ot feathers was thrown over his head. He was treated very roughly and warned to leave the city,. Itis said the police witnessed the en- tire scenes and made no opposition. To-day Marrs is in town, but is confined to his room being badly used up. Violent threats are made of worse treatment to night unless the subject of popular wrath leaves the city. The crime with which he is charged is too revolt ing for newspaper detail."

Running Sketch of Gen. Hunters Disastrous


Expedition.",,"| a huHEiuS SketCH Vi NeH. DisastfOus
| Expedition.


To THE EDITOR: Some time ago noticed a
request in your columns for a history of the
Lynchburg raid, under the leadership of Gen.


David Hunter and happening to be one of the
survivors of that illstarred expedition, / will
| endeavOr to give as concise and detailed state
ment as possible Hoping to escape the criti-
cism which such written narratives generally
provoke, will state that in essence it is cor
rect though in minor points it may be defect
i've.


Gen. Crooks soldiers had returned as far as
Meadow Bluffs, II miles north of Lewisburg,
| w. Va, from their victorious assault on the
heights of Cloyd Mountain and the burning of
New River bridge, on the line of the Virginia
& Tennessee Railroad. The condition of his
troops at this time was distressing. Many of
them were almost barefoot, their clothing was
in tatters, and they were attenuated from hard
| marching and starvation-living at this time
on less than half -rations. The order for move
on Lynchburg was not received with the great
est eclat, but Gen. Crook rank and file was
| made up of material ""that would not murmur
| or complain"" where honor led or duty called.


The line of march led by Lewisburg and
White Sulphur Springs. and early in June,
| 1864, junction was formed at the city of
| Staunton with the troops of Gen. Hunter, who
had but a few days prior gained the battle of
Piedmont. Here the united column, number
ing about 1900 men, was granted but a very
| limited period for rest and continuing its
| march to the south, appeared before the city OF
Lexington, located on the south bank of the
north fork of James River, the home of Robert
E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson. Here it may
| be proper to state that, according to rumor,
| Gen. Hunter transcended his orders, in not
moving by Charlottesville rather than this
| point; but in justice to that officer it may be
| inferred that he had the welfare of his coun-
try and his army at heart and had he gone in
with his brave army at the back door of Lynch
! burg, as he evidently designed in this move
ment, he would undoubtedly have been the
beau-ideal of the Nation at this hour. But his
project was not crowned with success, and, as
a Generals military glory usually depends
| upon his success. a sacrifice was demanded, and
Gen. Hunter had to fall.


We found Gen. McCausland's rebel brigade
| of cavalry and body of cadets disposed to con-
| test the fOrding of the stream at Lexington
| Several heavy pieces of artillery were also in
position here, but the most of them, being used
| for target guns, could not be made available
| for execution on our column, it being impossi-
! BILE to train them except in one direction. The
bridge spanning the stream was in flames. The
rebels had sharpshooters posted advantageously
| at ell points along the bank of the river, and
what few pieces of artillery they had were
| playing on the regiments and brigades as they
! filed into the positions assigned them. The



| ceeding up the stream for a mile or more sue
| ceeded in finding q suitable ford, and before
| the rebels hardly had time to say Jack Robin
son"" their position was turned and brigade
of Yanks hung heavily on their left flank.
There was but the choice of two things left
them to do-surrender or retreat. They
cepted the latter alternative, and stood not on
the order of their going, but went at once.


At this point the residence of Gov. Letcher,
of Virginia, was burned as well as the Military
Institute and the Lexington College All other
private property was respected. Gen. Stonewall
jackson, who had been slain by mistake by his
| own men at the battle of Charlottesville, was
buried here. When Hunters army entered the
city, Confederate flag foated over his grave
from the top of tall staff. This flag was torn
down and the staff almost carried off piecemeal
by relic-seekers. A Federal soldier not very
prudently, inscribed on his headstone in pencil:
""A good man and brave soldier, but traitor
to God and his country""


1t also may be proper to relate, in connection
with other incidents, that just before the Fed
eral column reached the city rash, fo0lhardy
Virginian declared that he would kill the first
Yankee passing his door. As the vanguard
came up two men of the 36th Ohio approached
him standing at his gate and one of them asked
him for drink of water ""Oh, yes"" said he;
Il will give you drink"" and stepping back
into the hail. brought out fowling piece and





him almost instantly. His enraged comrades
perforated his body with bullets until his skin
looked more like pepperboX than that of
human being


The advance of Hunters army from Lexing-
ton was more or less contested day by day until,
on Sunday evening June II, it was halted for
dinner and rest within heavy forest of tim
Der, seven miles from the city of Lynchburg.
At o'clock p. m. the Second Brigade was
marched out on the turnpike. As each regi-
ment marched by the General, who was splen-
didly mounted on a beautiful stallion, it was
critically viewed. As our own regiment filed
by he asked the name and number of the regi-
ment


""The 91st Ohio, General"" said one of the
privates.


""Well, boys"" said he, ""you have had good
rest l hope you will do some good fghting!""


""We are the boys to do it, General"" con-
tlnued the private, who was evidently deter
mined to have the last word, and which brought
a broad grin to the Generals face.


The ominous boom of cannon in our front,
and the irregular rattle of musketry as we drew
closer, assured US that the Generals words were
not without their significance. The Second
Brigade of Crooks Division was assigned a
position to the right of the turnpike and
another brigade, following Immediately in our
rear filed to the left of the pike just mentioned,
the movement being concealed from the enemy
by wooded activity in our front held by a
regiment of cavalry and a section of artillery,
and which was hotly engaged with the enemy
just beyond. The loud neighing of horse
which had both fore legs taken off by cannon
ball, as we passed by excited the compassion of
some kind hearted officer, who put an end to its
misery by shooting it through the head


The order having been given to move for
ward, the 9lst and 18th Ohio led the advance
at rightshoulder shift, followed at the usual
supporting distance by the 9th Va and 34th
Ohio. As the column emerged from the woods
at a double-quick a rebel battery on the op-
pOsite range opened with deadly effect, at first
using shell, and then, at short range, grape and
canister. Down On the rebel left Confederate
force concealed in the timber opened at short
range, doing terrible execution, but the bri-
gade, without wavering for a moment, swept
everything from its path though it were
but chaf, carrying every gun on the nights
Everything in gray was in the widest flight
Lynchburg was ours, and fairly won. The vic
tor had but to stretch out his hand and grasp
the prize.


At this juncture, which was about sundown
Gen. Hunter came onto the field and ordered
halt and bivouac for the night The curses
that greeted this order were long and deep and
loud.


The dawn of day on Monday, June 1s, re-
vealed force in our front equal to our own
while long line of rife-pits had sprung up in
our front as II by magic; while the enemy's
force was continually being augmented by fresh
arrivals of Gen. Earlys troops from Richmond.

JACKSON, MISS, Sept. 10.-The IA


publican State executive COMMITTEES


met in this city to-day, Hon. John r.


Lynch chairman. Eighteen members


were present. 1t was resolved to put


up no State ticket this fall as the fol-


lowing resolution introduced by ]. j.
Spellam and passed unanimously
shows:


Resolved, That In view Of the fact
that an organized opposition to the
Democratic party in this State this fan
is useless, because Of the well.known
impossibility of securing at the polls an
honest election it is the sense of this
committee that no convention be call.
ed looking to the nomination Of 4
State ticket by the Republican party.


The chairman addressed the commit
tee in speech in which he said that
ne could see no necessity for State
convention under existing circum-
stances. If it were possible to secure
free, fair and honest election or the
absence Of serious division among
Republicans nomination would be
equivalent to an election. That ii was
a well-known fact that popular elec-
tions in this State were thing Of TIE
past. That officers are appointed by
Democratic committees and conven-
tions and the election so called is moth
ing more than a matter of form. He
stated that in this State there was no
longer a republican form Of govern
ment. That the present State govern
ment was brought into power ana
maintained by usurpation, violence
and fraud. His whole speech was Of
the above tenor and was extremely bit.
ter in its denunciation Of the Demo-
cratic party and what he was pleased
10 term its methods."

If that rate IS maintained, it would elect the Republican delegation except Robert Hanlan. Nothing can be deter mined iu this contingency except the official count Since the last Of the counties claimed by the republicans for representatives announced yesterday there have been two changes, one in Hancock and the other m Knox coun- ties.

One, General Seth Williams, who had
served closely with him in the old army,
attempted to revive old memories, but Lee
repelled the advance coldly. He was in
no mood to remember ancient friendships.

betrayed. He had, however, another re-
quest to make. His men were starv-
ing; they had lived, he said, ON two ears of
corn day for several days. Would Grant
supply them with food? There was a
train of cars at Lynchburg loaded with ra-
tlons wnlch had come from Danville for
his army. Would Grant allow them to be
distributed among the prisoners? Grant,
however, told them that this train had
been captured the day before by Sheridan.
Ihus, at the moment of his surrender Lee
was ABSOLUTELY dependent for supplies
upon his conqueror. Grant, of course, ac-
quiesced in the request and asked how
many rations Lee required. But the rebel
General declared that he could not answer
the question. He had no idea of his own

 FOREIGN ITEMS.

 The English governments persistent re fusal to announce the state of the peace nego tiations with Russia tends to confirm the nov universal belief that the hitch is of the utmos gravity. The guarded admission of the Secre tary for War that it is still thought advisable to concentrate the British troops now in thu Soudan for possible service elsewhere strength ems this belief.

Pierre, Oak, Special Telegram: Startling
developments were made in the Ben-sman
murder case. Bennett the accomplice of Bell,
has turned states evidence, and on infor-
nation given by him the body of Small
was found buried in piece Of newly
plowed ground about four miles from
Harold and two miles from Blunt. The sod
had bsen first removed. shallow hole dug
and carefully replaced to avoid discovery.
The body Of Small wrapped in blanket and
covered with the lood-stained overcoat Of the
murderer. 1t was in good state Of preserya-
tion. The murder was committed with a
hatchet, the skull being broken st a number Of
places and the neck gashed in q horrible man
ner. The excitement is great, and the lynch
ing of Bell is excitedly discussed by the crowds
forming ON the streets Z.


f. S. Small, the victom OF this murder, was
last fall a candidate for prosecuting. attorney
of Hughes county, Oak. Several months ago
he mysteriouslv disappeared. No light was
thrown upon the matter unit the 10Th Of last
month, when J. H. Bell was arrested by the
shelf and taken to Pierre for examination."

day young man, whose mind was prob
ably unsound, shot aud killed q respecta-
bic citizen in response to q playful query.
The crime was shocking and without
provocation, Yesterday band of men
in disguise captured the Jail in which the
murderer was confined, took him there
from, and hanged him, thus heaping
crime on crime.


Society suffers no loss in the hanging Of
criminal such as young Terry was.
Mentally irresponsible he might have
been, but his murder of Mr.. Jeter served
to show that If such was his condition IL
only made him more dangerous. But
society does suffer grieyous wrong when
presumably good citizens, acting solely
under revengoful sentiments, combine to
outrage the law in the manner the men
did who lynched Terry. For them there
is no excuse. 1t was the function Of a
court and jury to execute vengeance upon
| Terry, and there is no evidence that in
due and orderly course of time tho local
court could not have been depended upon
to do justice in the case.


Lynchingis, unfortunately, too common
in our country, and, more unfortunately,
the lynohors are never punished, though
it is hard to SEQ why they are not as
truly murdorers as is any man who, like
Terry, takes human life in cold blood
without cause. Tho worst of it is that
tho evil effects Of such an occurrence
often extend beyond the lynching into
other acts Of aggression against the law
not contemplated at tho time when the
| lynohers first organized for q single def
nite act Of vengeance upon some obnox-
ious criminal. The citizens of Liberty
may yet regret deeply that tho man
lynched was not permitted to live until,
through the power of their courts, they
could prove their community to be in all
respects law-abiding and law-enforcing."

Sharp and fami- ly, who were conducting the board ing cars at Watson station, were sur prised on observing four hostile Indians riding up the railroad track. The family immediately boarded one of the hand-cars and pulled out for Mutt station. The Indians took possession of the boarding-cars, but, to the utter astouishment of all, did no damage. It appears that the Indians were in quest of water, and after satisfying their thirst, took across the plains in a south-westerly direction. There is no question about their being Indians, as the section men at Sellers station and Mir. Lynch's cowboys were run into Rincon by the same party.

Gordon, the dashinG young officer upon whom the eyes of the Confederacy were cast as the Napoleon of the four years civil war, resides in a maglticient residence in this place.

 Your correspondent, as instruc- ted, today called Gen. Gordon's attention to a recent publication by Gen. Jubal Farly, where that officer states that:

 Gen. Lees sword was never ten. dered to Gen. Grant, and the hter therefore had no opportunity to de cline to receive it or return 1t af- ter it had been surrendered. The correspondence between Grant and Lee refutes the idea that Gen. Lee eyer contemplated making an unconditional surrender of his army, or that he was indebted to the magnsnimity of Grant for the terms of the surrender. Zen Lee sais scefore going to meet Gen. Grant he left orders with Long stre ct and Gordon to hold their commands in readiness, as he was determined to cut his way through or perish in the attempt if such terms were not granted as he thought his as,ny entitled tc de. mana. It was not, therefore, to Grants magnanimity that Gen. Lee was fN Ndebted for the privilege of retaining his sword, or for the terms gran+ed to his army, but to his own resolutc will and the anxi- ety of Grant to obtain the surrend. CT of an adversary who had thwaiAtes him so long.

 ""In reply to tbese remarkable statements"" said Gen. Gordon, I can do no better than give you a copy of letter which I had just written upon the question, and which l was just about ts send out for publfcation.'

 The letter was in the following terms:

 HARDWOOD NEAR ATLANTA, GA. April s, lSS5.-I wish to give my recollectlom. S some of the cir cnmstanccs attending the surron der of Gen. Lees army to Gen Grant at Appomattox court house Va. The fact that the struggle could not be prolonged by Gen. Lee beyond . &w days with any organized army had been evident for at least fOrty-eisht hours pre- ceding tho final engagements on the morning of the 9th of April The continued embarrassment and constant delays incident to re- tiring army, by reason of the ne cessity for keeping the wagon trains in advance Of the troops, while the pursuing army is, in large measure freed from such em. barrassment because its trains may be left in the rear; the want of ra- tions for the men and forage fol horses; the number of Confeder atcs who daily and hourly fell on the line of march from aheer e1 haustion, as well as in the con stantly recurring bottlos; exceed ingly small numbers under Gen. Lee command as compared with the army of Gen. Grant. left little ground for hope to the CoMeder' ate Generals of escaping speedy surrsSAsr. On the night of the sth of April the last council of war was held at Gen. Lees bivouac' near appomattox Court House At this council it was decided that an effort, though desperate, should be made the next morning to cut through the lines of Gen Grant ,and, if possible to pursue the re- treat toward Lynchburg. Gen Longstreet commanded ono wing of Gen. Lees army, while l com manded the other. Gen. Lees or ders were that the infantry and ar tillery under my eampand, with the cavalry, should assail the line, thrown across our front, and t&N Cen. Longstreet should check tl' heavy forces which pressed on ou1 rear, and, if possible, co-operate a the same time in aa efltrt to force our way out, while the wagor trains with the ammunition (w' l.could not be sad to have at tha t:me provisional were to.move.ifpo sibie. between Cen.

As will be observed from ttc state ment of Con. Gordon above, the tcderals were enabled to make bet

 ter time than the Confederates, who were on the retreat toward Lynchburg, travelling in parallel lines. In fact, the head of the pur- suing Federal column had pushed passed the Confederate head of col umn, and thrcwN up works across the Confederate front, which ne- ce essitated surrender or fight. In this emergency, as the shades of night began to gathor aTonpd, Lee called council .f war to decide upon plan of action. In rear, flank and front wese masses of Fed erals, while the COnferates were few in number, worn out with con stant marching, and suffering from hunger. It was an impressive mo- ment such a s&Omelr as decides the fate ot empires.

 Upon a little eminencs in the woods a brush fire was burning brightly. Reclining at full length on the ground Seside it WAS Gen

 Robsrs E. Lee, his head resting up- on his saddle, his eyes vainly seek ing flew moments of repOse, but his brain was too busy with thoughts of responsibility thrown mon his shoulders. As he lay there it could be observed that he was clothed in a we'l-worn gray blouse, with ordinary gray pantas- looms, while by his side was the black felt hat, which had grown to be part of rUncle Bob"" himself. A figure of q stalwart man ap- groached-walking slowly, as il fearful of the place. When the Eae- flight fell across it disclosed the face of Gen. Longstreet, the old bulldog of the army. His flashing eyes, his full, black beard, las oa- fitting uniform of Lieutenant Oen- eral, all presented a figure as stnr' dy as rthe giant oak against which he leaned, unwilling to disturb hiG old commander.

painful impressions caused by perusing
accounts of human suffering. Is there
a railroad accident a steamboat disas-
ter, hanging, lynching, a murder or
anything of this nature vividly written
up and glowingly pictured in reporto-
rial descriptive style, it at once becomes
the most interesting item of the paper.
Managers of our large and most success
full metropolitan dailies pander to this
corrupt and morbid taste of their pa
irons. A reporter will be dispatched a
hundred miles to gather the latest and
most minute details of some licentious
rape or revolving murder, while the
deeds of the good and the virtuous are
never known outside narrow limit.

 EloGuent sermon at St. Francis

 Chnrcfia

 At St. Francis church, Fair Haven, yes terday morning, Rev. MT. Lynch preached an eloquent discourse, in the course of which he said: As business man examines his accounts so should we examine ourselves as to what pertains to our duty to God, duties that are. of vital importance to our salvation. In this holy season of Lent we should, there fore, perform those duties that are obliga- tory to us and which God commands us to observe We see how God forgives us all our sins out of pure goodness; the mercy of God is something that we are not easily tired of contemplating. But it would be scarcely fair to have our own side of the account uneonsidered. Let us turn over the leaf and figure up what we have done for him. Well, about all that we can find is that we have been guilty, all of us, one more and another less, of mortal sin.

 Now to perform these duties which God commands us to observe, especially in the season of Lent, we should have perfect contrition for cur sins, the greatest of all things necessary to salvation. By contrition is meant hearty sorrow for our sins and detestation of them, with firm resolve to commit sin no more There are two kinds of contrition, perfect and i'm perfect. Perfect contrition is sorrow for sin when we have offended God, a sorrow for sin because we have offended Jesus Christ Imperfect contrition is sorrow for our sins and detestation of them, when we know we have offended God, and that we will be punished for it. It is the fear of the punish ment that gives us imperfect contrition, while perfect contrition comes from the heart and. is willing to be punished for having offended God. The person who has perfect contrition in his heart thanks God for the affiictions as well as the blessings he sends, for he is the same God to their contrite hearts in storm or in sunshine. In word, one of the channels of the love of God in their lives is a deep sentiment of gratitude for his having for given them. Perfect contrition, therefore, sanctifies the soul while imperfect contri- tion never benefits the soul, but harms it by committing the crime of sacrilege

 Contrition must be accompanied by firm resolve to sin no more. We must also avoid the occasion of sin as well as the motives and places in which we have sinned. Our con- triton must De supernatural, based upon supernatural motives besides supernatural it must be universal it must extend to all. If man commit six sins and have a per feet contrition for five of them it availeth him nothing.

 Supreme sorrow for our sins must be great, above sorrow for all earthly things. We should estimate God as above all things earthly. If we lose God we lose all. If we lose all things that we own on earth we do not lose place left us in heaven. Another thing necessary for our salvation is penance. u. The person who has perfect contrition for his sins and doeth penance for them God in his infinite goodness forgives. Neither eye hath seen nor ear heard, nor hath it been conceived in the mind of of the great blessings prepared for those who observe Gods commands."

ats and Other Mines.


Mr.. Appleton Of the Metropolitaus told
tho sporting editor Of THE Critic yester-
day that as long as his club was drawing as
well as it is now, it would not be dis
banded, so there is no immediate prospect
of tho Nationals getting into the American
Association. Hankinson. who sprained his
ankle in the first game the Nets played,
and Jack Lynch, who has been suffering
with rheumatism, are both nearly ft to
join the nine, which will be much
strengthened by their presence.


There was quite breeze among the Ma
tionals directors over playing the New
York nino on Tuesday. Hewitt and Ben
nett were strongly in favor Of playing,
while several of the others were against 1t,
Hewitt contended that the Nationals, by
continuing tho gamo on Monday, had con-
doned the offense the New Yorks had COM
mitted by ringing in a new ball; that If
they thought their action too dishonorable
TO admit Of their playing them Tuesday,
they should have refused to continue the
gamo Monday; that Tuesdays game would
I have drawn an immense crowd, and the
club was simply throwing away seven or
eight hundred dollars. His view was GER
tainly the common.sense business view to
take of 1t.


Some of the sporting papers hayo said
that if the Nationals were admitted to the
American Association they would fight II
out with the Louisvlles for seventh place.
Tho repeated defeats the Nationals have
Administered TO the strongest clubs in the
country seem to have failed In convincing
outsiders that we really have frst-class

sociation when the season opened, the
Nationals would not be worse than fourth
at the end Of the season. It would have
been something like this: Cincinnati, Brook
lyn, ST. Louis, National, Athletic, Pittsburg,
Baltimore and Louisville.


Tho reporter for one of the Sunday papers
| in his account of the game between the Ma
tiopals and the New Yorks very wrongly
| attacked Barr, the pitcher of the Nationals.
| He alludes to the condition of Barr's arm as
| being of slight Importance, when in reality
the muscles are 80 strained that his physi-
/ clans have advised him to discontinue
| pitching for few days or he will suffer
from cellutits. As for his being afraid TO
| face these heavy batters is ridiculous, when
one remembers that he has been play ing for
the past two years professionally and has
been compelled to face any and all comers,
and to charge him with cowardice or at
1
from one who processes to believe this man
to be Zone of the best pitchers in the land""
| In an interview with Mr.. Barr yesterday,
| he says that he cannot understand why such
an article should have been published, for
he has tried to do his duty to the National
| Club, and will continue to do so. He further
states that as far as the article In question
relates to him that there is not grain of
| truth in IL, and that his friends in this city
and elsewhere know it. He is truly grate-
full for the kind advise gratuitously given
by the alleged ""voice of the people,"" but
| when he wishes any he will seek 1t from
those whom he thinks capable of giving ad-
vice which is worthy of acceptance.


James Mutrie, manager of the New York
League Baseball Club, severely condemns
the directors Of the American Association
for their action in expelling him from
| that body at their meeting in Pittsburg on
Monday. Mr.. Mutrie also said that tho
fine which had been imposed upon the
club would be paid il the association in
sisted upon 1t, but that the local manage
ment would demand trial first, and If
they had violated any trust or agreement
would cheerfully pay several times that
amount. Another baseball man said that
| certain secretary and director of q club on
the Ohio River was the chief mover against
Manager Mutrie and that the same person
last fall offered Manager Mutrie bonus,
about So, 900, If he would bring two players
of the Metropolitan Club to that city, Civ
ing him the management. 1t is also re-
ported that Manager Barnie tried to get
two of the local players lately to go to Bal
timore The directors of tho Brooklyn and
Athletic clubs were the only ones in the
meeting friendly to the local club. Man
ager Mutrie is expelled from an association
to which he does not belong, he having
transferred his affections to the local
league club last fall. O'Rourke says he
changed the ball in the New York National
game at Washington, on Monday, over
which there has been so much talk be
cause the Washington club insisted upor
playing with a soft, dilapidated ball, which
the players could not bat outside thC
diamond. He said that in changing The
ball no unfair advantage was taken, and
that it was as fair for one side as for tht
other. This is certainly about the lanes
excuse that man possessing nnimpairet
mental faculties could offer.

the Court (P) of Judge Lynch, of capital
executions up to date, the assertion is made
that at the close of this year the record will
show about 400 hangings Throughout this
country, as compared with from 90 to 100
in the same time following capital convic-
tions by Uncle Sans judiciary


Why should there be such a very great
disparity in results A conclusion is that
the people of the United States, for these
illegal hangings have been consummated
among all the states, differ widely with
the authorities upon the question of punish
ment for capital crimes. 1t may be stated
that the mobs who thus break the law of
the land in taking upon themselves the
duties of executoner do not represent the
a concensus of the whole people could be
taken upon the final question Of the just
deserts of the majority of Judge Lynch's
victims, this coupled with the positi We
distrust that exists throughout the country
in any efficiency of justice, w.sat would the
silent verdict be?


Texas in one day alone strung up fifteen
maraudersl Every day we read of flynchings.
The New York Herald in recent issues
announced them in bunches of five and three
at time. Though lynching should be
suppressed and our condemnation for such
outrageous infraction of the law could
hardly be sufficiently emphasized, the
fact still holds that JUSTICE is lax in the
United States,"

The bridal couple did not make this house
their home, but after q wedding trip they
turned to St Louis, and lived for some
time with Mrs Grants parents out at the
farm, on the Gravois road. Young Grant
resigned his army commission in 1854, and
located with his family out on the Dent farm,
Mr.. Dent having made his daughter a present
of eighty acres and four slaves. They lived
there very nicely, but Grant did not find the life
congenial. The chief farming he did was to
haul cordwood to town and sell 1t, on which oc-
casion the very familiar costume which clad his
gaunt form was a jeans pants, gray woolen
shirt, one or two @galluses, pair OF raw-hide
boots, slouch hat, and an untrimmed beard.

Tiring completely OF farm life, he moved into

ployment was the real estate business, but no
did not prosper. and in 1857 moved to Galena,
Ill, where he went into business with his father
