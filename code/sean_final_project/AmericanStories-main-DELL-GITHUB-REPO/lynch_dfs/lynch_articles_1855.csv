quietus upon the quasi-legislature of
Kansas. That body may continue in
session and enact all the laws they
are disposed, but they win remain

lernor has made a strong case against the
legality of the Legislature, but it seems
to usthat there is another argument more
effective than the others, and one which
no legal judicature can resist. The place
to which they have adjourned is por-

WrLKEs-BARRI, Pa, 9th August, 1856.
.Messrs. Editors:


Ny prediction in a previous
letter to the Herald, concerning Gov. Rec
der's removal, has been verified; and the
people of Kansas must now experience the
relief, felt by sleeper under an incubus,
when suddenly restored to wakefulness.-
The explanations demanded by the Presi-
dent of his Excellency, touching the char
ges Of illegal land speculations, came forth
as clear as black cload In a dark night;
and have had the effect to disappoint his
friends throughout the country egregiously.
His defence embraces but two material
points. The first, in regard to the pur-
chase of Indian lands. he answers in the
following language;-""If there is any
wrong in the matter it is not ""a wrong
committed, but at most only wrong at-
tmpted, and in the face of all probability
a wrong which we expected to be sane
toned by the President"" 1t was cat
most only ""a wrong attempted -"" a wrong
which we expected to be sanctioned by
the President!!''


The second point is simply demurrer !;
1. E. the Governor does not deny his guilt
in ""other speculations in the lands of
Kansas, apparently in violation of Acts
Of @Congress &c."" but that ""the very
general manner in which the char
ges are stated, the entire absence of
any specification on which to make a
point OF raise an issue"" might cause him
to ""wander in side issues, departures.
evasions and uncertainties, without ever
reaching conclusion % Pettlfogging is
generally contemplate, which even bad
case will not justify. but this position of the
Governor is laughable.


The Abolition papers are prolonging
an agonizing wall over Reeder's removal;
and in discussing the matter, do not fail to
consult their vocabulary of literary gar
bage and choice lies.. Abolitionism and





Truth are Antipodes. witness so much
in print of Kansas affairs, that know to

prejudices against Abolitionists, are fast

lame and wicked apology for the Missou-
rians who trampled upon the rights of
the citizens of Kansas. 1t says with an
effrontery worthy of highwayman,
Massachusetts, abolitionists combined.
with their money and their influence, to
defeat the honest purpose of the Kansas
law, and by their grand conception fear
! fully menaced the very existence of sla-
very in Missouri"" So then, according
to the administration organ, the establish
ment of slavery in Kansas was the hon
est purpose of the Kansas law; and if,
| taking advantage of that law, the free
states seek to reclaim it to its original
freedom. shareholders are justified in out
raging and defeating the great principle
of squatber sovereignty itself. 1t goes
on to say:


""Itw bold and daring scheme, by
the legislation, the money, and the men
of Massachusetts, to defeat an act of Con-
gress which secured to the bona fde and
voluntary settlers in Kansas the right to
choose and establish their own institu-
tons. 1t becomes the true national men
of all politics who love the Union and
desire its preservation, to bear in mind
that the abolitionists themselves are re-
sponsible for committing the first offence
and this fact should be considered in
Judging of the conduct of the Missou-
rians, who are charged with obstructing
the right of suffrage in the late election. !""
1t is difficult to treat with any degree
of patience or courtesy language so
insulting as this.S If it means anything,
it means that the territories belong not to
the people, butto the shareholders, and
that they have the right to exclude all
settlers from the public domain who do
not sanction and sustain slavery. This
is the claim openly made by Atchison
and his gang in respect to Kansas, and
now sneakingly sustained by the admin
istration press. If this is the interpreta-
ton 10 be given to the fact of Governor
Reeder's being sent back to Kansas un-
sustained BY military force, the north
and west should understand it, and take
prompt measures to defend the sons they
have sent to people Kansas, against the
ruffianism which the administration thus
encourages by base and cowardly apollo
gies.


| Another sign of the nullifcation ten.
denotes of the administration, is found
in the fact that the only presses in Kan
sas that receive. government patronage
are the Squatter Sovereign and Kansas
Herald, both in the interest of Atchison,
and both advocating the expulsion and
murder of abolitionists, in weekly TRADES
of malignity and profanity never before
Iequaled this side the Internal regions
The Sovereign of May 8, concludes an
article offalsehood and malice by saying,
sLet US begin to purge ourselves of all

/ Atchison and his horde of secret ban
di.ti seem to have established a perfect
nquisition. and exercise reign OF ter
ror over the people of Western Missouri,
which many of them neither resist nor
demonstrate against. A former resident
of Platte county writes to the Cincinnati
Democrat:


""This association has had up before
them men of the most quiet and respect
able characters, who have been constant
ly assailed by abuse, villifcation, obscen-
ity and inselence; have been roughly
treated, and dismissed with hoots and
jeers, after every effort has failed.to i'm
plicate them, even inthe ready Judgment
of this slave tribunal. Thomas A. Mi
nard, formerly sheriff in the state of
| Iowa, was the first man arraigned before
the tribunal on July 10th, 1854. He
was tried upon his own evidence. He
was man of influence and character, and
had many strong friends among that por-
ftion of the population not ultra upon sla-
very. He was seized and bound, and
carried before the tribunal, and there, up
on being questioned, stated that he had
said repeatedly that he hoped to see Kan
sas free state that he believed itwould
be for the best interests of the country
that it should be so. He was solemnly
pronounced an abolitionist, and was sem
fenced 10 receive forty eight lashes, unless
at the end of forty-eight hours he was
found missing from the state Of Missouri.
He chose to take the other course ral-
lied his friends, armed himself, and open
Ily defed them. He lives among them
vet, and the sentence has not as yet been
carried, OUT


Such is the rufianism that seeks to
[extend its sway over Kansas, driving both
the election officers and legal voters away
from the polls, and usurping the govern
ment; and then returning to Missouri to
destroy the presses and lynch the men
who dare to condemn their crimes. And
yet, these ruffians, according to the
government organ, are only sustaining
what peaceful northern settlers are at
tempting to defeat, 3the honestpurpose o.

let it be made openly and squarely. We
think the people of the free states vii
not shrink from it. Slavery had a faiI
chance legally to take possession of Kan
tsas and establish itself by outvoting the
free state settlers. But if violence an6

It's influence, and as eastern people are

But to the Pilots article


I'VE greatly fear that those of our
friends In the western counties who inn
agine that the question of slavery or no |
slavery in,Kansas has been settled by the
result of the late election are doomed to |
sore disappointment. On subject Of
such vital interest to them, and to ihs /
counties on the western border, it is inl-
portant that they should not be deceived.
They should know the worst, and pre-
pare themselves for it. From the dis
patch which we copy from the New York |
Herald, from the resident agent in this
city, of the Emigration Societies, it is ap- |
parent that he is expecting large re-in-
forcements to those already forwarded
to Kansas. He ajvisesethe agenein New
York not to ship before the tenth of this |
month. He regrets the low stage of
water in the Missouri, which prevented
those who had been sent on this far from
being forwarded, SO that they might have
reached their place of destination in time
for the late election At the date of this |
dispatch, the day of election was known
here, and we have no doubt Governor
Reeder had informed Mr.. Slater of the |
time fixed for the election long prior to
that time. We may, therefore, look for
crowds of these people bound for Kansas
as soon as Mr.. Slater shall notify them
that he can ship them up the Missouri at
fair rates, and with good stage of wa
ter. This inference is strengthened by
what We have from othersources. From
a gentleman who processes to know all
about their movements, and who is one
among thousands in this city who have
grown rich from the business Of slave
holders and Missourians, but yet who
sympathises ineyery anti slavery scheme,
we hear that these associations have at
their command both men and money
sufficient to accomplish their Objects
He estimates the number of emigrants
that will come from New England alone
at 90, 600, and they all haze a preference

 The negro boy (aged about ID belonging to Mr. William Turner, of the vicinity of La Grange Tenn, whom we mentioned yesterday morning as having the day previous killed the overseer, MT.

he treatment of strangers, which should cause
some reflection in the present war waging
against foreigners by designing politicians:


The oldest law of which we have record ad-
usting the relations and defining the duties Of
,liens who came within the lmite of the State
vas incorporated in the statutes of the Jewish
heocracy. In the textbook of the most ad-
n; rable jurisprudence the world has seen we
ind it enjoined upon the nation that ""1f o
stranger dwelleth with thee in your land, thou
shalt not vex him. But the stranger that
lwelleth with you shall be unto you as one
born among you, and thou shalt love him as
thvself for ye were strangers in the land of
Egypt; am the Lord your God"" Such was
the beautiful enunciation and divine authenti-
cation of the principle of national hospital
ity. The reason for it. or rather the motive
that should incite to it, is given as the occa-
sional reqnisition for its exercise toward our
selves. 1t is an imperial fruit of the compre-
hensive law of true charity which in the mu-
tations of society and in the orlerings of
Providence that drive the various individuals
Of the race from one land to another, may
become of practical advantage to all.


Nor was this an isolated injunction. The
same terms of hospitality were often enjoned
upon the chosen people in language equally
emphatic and significant. Most careful pro-
vision was to he made for the interests of the
alien. and in return for such courtesy and as
the legitimate result of it it was promised
that strangers shall stand and feed your focks,
and the sons of the alien shall he yonr plow-
men and shall build the old wastes and repair
the desolations of the cities. National cour-
tesy would result in national aggrandiz' fnent
and the hospitality VIII 'ch cheered the stran-
ger should return sevenfo1d blessing upon
the land Thus in the Jewish theocracy. that
perfect model of State, because its laws
were expressive Of infinite wisdom and pre-
scriptive of the Divine will, was furnished q
safe asylum for the oppressed of all nations;
and no sooner had the foot of the stranger
fallen on Judean soil than his person was in
vested with the respect and affection conf rred
upon citizen. Over him the law spread its
protecting egis and secured to him the rights
Of one horn in the land. No matter from

who were lynched last autumn carried on
their nefarious business. Upon investigations
it appeared that on Sunday evening. July lst
about 10 O'Clock. band of men, some 25 in
number came into San Antonio on horseback,
entered the public house known as the ""Anto-
MO House,"" and forciby dragged one John
Tanning therefrom The people of the village
were generally asleep, no noise or tumult was
created, and nothing was said or heard of John
Tanning until he was discovered last evening
hanging upon tree as above stated. The de-
ceased has for long time been marked as
dissolute character. suspected of horse steal
ing, DC. 1t is evident that those who hung
him. were not actuated by any desire of gain,
for even his pockets appeared unexamined,
S25 being found upon his person when he was
cut down.


Up to this time no knowledge has been OBJ

LATER.-Since writing the above we are in
formed the mob hung the wrong mana per-
son evidently innocent of the supposed crime


We clip the above from the Erening Jour-
nal of yesterday. A gentleman residing in
Alameda county informs us that Tanning, a
young man of 81, had had difficulty with
Squire White Of that county, and had been
heard to say that Mr.. White would not long
possess his property Gncluding horse) Not
long afterwords Mr.. WIS house was set on fire.
and flaming was suspected of being the in
cendiary, and for this supposed offence it is
supposed that Tanning was hung. A man
went into Fanning's Broadway House in San
Antonio, on Sunday evening, and asked the
landlady whether she could furnish boarding
to himself and four or five companions. She
replied ''yes."" He went out, and returned in
few minutes with five Companions. The
party went up stairs to Fannings room, and
took him out with little or no opposition on
his part The landlady suspected something
wrong. Soon after leaving the house. the
party were joined by ten or fifteen other men,
and they were not again seen. flaming was
undoubtedly executed by them that night; but
it is not known whether he had trial accord
ing TO the better usages Of Judge Lynch, or
whether he was strung up without investiga-
tion or delay. According to our information
the case looks very much like murder.

brutal murders which have appeared in the
papers for few days past, we are almost led to
believe that the present thae is the advent of
season Of horritying homicides the details of
the perpetration of some of which present the
offenders more in the light of heartless brutes
than human beings. The most shocking on
the list of the recent murders is the one in
Wisconsin, where man named Debar attempt
| ed to ut an end to the existence of a whole
family. This wretch, for no other reason than,
~e iiU stated, snt~rtalning a bare suspicion that
his intended victim, a worthy farmer named
Muehr, had struck him at the election polls,
knocked him down, intending the blow should
be fatal, while Mr.. Muehr was in the act of
giving him drink to quench his thirst. He
then caught his wife, and with knife nearly
severed her head from her body. His blood
thirstiness did not stop there but encountering
young man in the employ of Muehr, he soon
despatched him with a club. He then went
back to the house, set it on fire, and threw the
body of the young man into the flames Debar
was caught and tried within four days after
committing the offence. lie was found guilty
and remanded to prison TO await his sentence,
but on his way thither the incensed populace
took him from the custody OF the sheriff. and
after treating him in the same brutal manner
that he had dealt with his victims, dragged
hun to tree and suspended him by the heels
until life was extinct. Wisconsin is becoming
noted for murders and lynch law executions


The next most horrifying affair of the kind
is the finding of the body of young woman in
Gunner's run, Philadelphia, with marks upon
her body, which showed conclusively that she
had been foully dealt with. This murder has
very much the appearance of the Green Lane
affair in the same city, and is, like that, en-
shrouded in mystery. She was the wife of a
German named Michael Albrccht, was only
eighteen years of age, and had been married
but three weeks. Her maiden name was Eliza
beth Sting.


Next comes the affair at Newark, n. j..
which took place on Tuesday last The keep
er Of lager beer saloon, named Conrad Bauer.
was stabbed to the heart by man named John
Mckinney, after u few words of alteration.
which arose in consequence of Bauer refusing
to admit a number Of riotous characters into
his house. The murderer is still at large, and
is said to be in New York. The Mayor of
Newark has offered reward of two hundred
dollars for his apprehension.


An aggravated murder occurred near Spring
field, Tenn about two weeks since. A man
named Mortimer A. Martin had separated from
his wife, in consequence of supposed intimacy
between her and young man named Francis
NJ. Walton. The two parties met, and Martin
desired Walton to keep out Of his way, as he
did not like him Martin then left and walked
away, when Walton fred and shot him in the
back. Martin fell, AID his adversary immedi-
ately got upon him, and with another pistol de-
spatched HIM. Walton has not been arrested


On the 3I inst, at u political meeting held
in jamestown, Ohio, two persons named Benia-
min Adkins, ship carpenter, and William
WoIlan, keeper of the Mexico House, few
miles above Cincinnati, on the Kentucky side
got into an alteration, which resulted in Wor-
lan's stabbmg Adkins in the region of the heart,
which caused lis death immediately.


In the town Of Whitcford, Monroe county.
Michigan, woman was found in her own
house, having been killed by blows on the back
part of the head. Suspicion rested upon man
named james E. Cromwell, her SON in-law, and
he was accordingly arrested for the crime
During his examination there was great excite
ment among the people, aud the evidence was
so strong against him, and the offence so bru-
tai, that had not the officers OF the law ia ken
most determined and formidable stand, a Wis
consiH lynch law tragedy would most certainly
have been enacted. The prisoner is now in
jail awaiting his trial.

In looking over our exchanges, a few

1t seems that this same bastard was driven


off from mis- former residence. The State


Journal adds "" His last public appearance


in Sheboygan county was as ""a FuGI-

himself to the thick shelter of innumerable


sloughs in the adjacent tall timber!' 8.


This shows the metal of the dastardly
M'Crea. When he commits crimes, he


takes flight, and by mighty leaps plunges


into rivers. When he is captured, he bites


his tongue, spits blood, and declares he has
been shot. Then come letters from his


Abolition friends, declaring he shot IN self
defence that his teeth aUere shattered! his
collar bone broken &c., sc. This has
tbeen the programme in M'Crea's. case, but


we are confident that the efforts of his
friends to exculpate him, will in no wise


thwart the ends of justice: ..sss .es-s


'sWe suspect that M'Crea was former
/ ly resident of this State. A person
bearing his name resided in Sheboygan
county several years ago, where we had
occasion to know something of him. He


was a blacksmith by trade and a loaUyer bg
profession, and rejoiced in the soubriguet

EDS. CoURIEg:-Mob law is not correct ex-
preston for law sis rule dictated by reason,
the aim of which ia the public good, and pro-
mulgated by those who have the care of So
ciety.' Mob is synonymous with anarchy,
tyranny and misrule. A mob has no power to
make law. but it sets law aside or tramples on
it; it usurps tue functions of the civil power it
is illegitmate and kas an inevitable tendency TO
destroy the whole social organization and estab-
lish the worst forms of anarchy and despotism.
Mob law is no law at all, but an audaclous out
| rage on Justice. reason aud society.


! The formidable right over Life and death is


not vested in ndigiduals. for 80 individual can
| claim this momentous power as natural prero-
| gative-no man ever born with this right as
| natural prerogative This power .amanates
from God and by him is conferred on society in
| general The community either expressly or
tacitly transfers OF delegates it to those whom it
| appoints to govern and rule over it. Thus then
these governors rulers thus invested, and they
! only are the persons who can legitlmately exer-
else that power. Moreover individuals life


is not his own he only has the of it SO Ion g
| as it shall please the Creator. Much less can he
| assume any right over his neighbours life. To


usurp such arbitrary power is transgresslon OF


both the divine and human law, and the trans


gressor is culpable and amenable before God


and MACPHERSON, justice, and society all con-


denim him. And this applies to number OF in


diyiduals equally as to one. Supposlng even the


person killed to have been wicked aud deserving


of death, the civil power only has the authority


to punish. In the extreme case OF sef-detence.
when a person slays his antagonist, he in no


manner arrogates such prerogatve. but acts in
order only to preserve himself. Again, when


an individual usurps power over another he
places himself outside and above all law and 60


vernment; and. if one may do so, why not a


number until the principle should finally pre-


vail The Consolation would then be regarded


only as so much waste paper. The law would be


despised. human passions would domlneer, and

1t such RIGHTEOUSNESS is permitted to stalk with


impunity, who can toretell IFS ultimate bounds aud


excesses. We can see some OF the eonse-
quences of this spirit now manitesting itself IN


one place under the name of Lynch law. in an


other 10y Filbnsterism; again by the extrava-


sances of Abolitionism, and again by rabid poll
I tical fanaticism.


Society cannot exist without order, nor order

the governing powers is obligatory. Every in

by Mr.. Johnson, is fair sample of several, and is
no doubt the truth about these newspaper diggings
Mr.. Johnson says:


81 started on the 5th of March from Stockton, in
company with friend, who took large amount
of goods, intending 10 trade on Kern river. His
wife was to follow in day Or two from Stockton
There were eighteen men in the party with us On
arriving at Dicksons Ferry about fifty miles from
Stockton, we met party of over one hundred men
with their wagons and mules, on their wav from
Kern river to Stockton. They were all cursing
that country most heartily. My friend met two
men with whom he was well acquainted, who were
old and skillful miners They stated that they had
been on the Kern river since the 1st of September,
and the best wages they had ever made was 81 per
day. They had to pack their DIRT three hundred
yards to make that The deepest indignation pre-
vailed at the mines in consequence of the deception
that had been practced, and there were threats of
lynchng some of the parties concerned in it. Very
few at the mines were making their board, even
where water was plenty, and hundreds were beg
ging their way to Stockton and San Francisco.
There were some four or five hundred persons fol-
lowing the party that met. My friend rode all
night to get to Stockton in season to prevent his
wife from starting The roads were very muddy
and the rivers and creeks, in many places, were
impossible. A fine mill was swept away near
Dicksons Ferry, few days since by the Hood"""

They are now meeting with as disasterous defeats as heretofore they have achieved signal victories.

 To show the strong tide of popular feeling that is sweeping them into hopeless minorities, we give few results of elections, where during the last twelve months they achieved their greatest victories:

 Cincinnati Akron Chilicothe Cuyahoga Falls, Dayton, New Richmond, Medina, Toledo. Sandusky Hamilton and Fremont all in Ohio Last fall these places gave large know ncth- ing majorities. They are now strongly anti know nothing

 A correspondent of the Cincinnati Enquirer. writing from Madison, Ia., under date of April 5, says:

 Our city election was held on Monday last. The great battle was fought. and the principles of civil and religious liberty trumphed. The know nothingS had formed their ticket in secret council, and ushered it before the public under the captivating name of the ""people's tcket'-- they were on the ground early, marshaling all thertorces, but, inspite of their desperate exer tions, the entire anta kaoa0-nothang ticket was elected by an aUerage majority of c hmadyea and taoenty.fUe. Last October our city was know nothing about two to one. The know nothing ticket was composed entirely of ultra know nothing whigs.

 In Lynchburg, Va, the local elections came off on the Sd inst, and resulted in the entire de- feat of the know nothing ticket

 The Detroit Free Press, (Michigan) in speak, ing ol the recent spring elections in that State says:

 The returns of the township election held on Monday indicate that the democracy have swept the State. Know nottingham and fu- sionism seem generally to have combined, but with very indifferent success, even in some anti. democratic strougholds. Our impression is that the result will show an old-fashioned democrat. ic victory""

 In November last the know -nothngs carried Michigan, electing their State ticket by hand some majority, and choosing great proportion of the Legislature. Now the state of affairs is entirely reversed, and the democr ats have again the ascendency. Throughout the country there is heavy reaction in public sentiment against the bigoted, proscriptive, secret society The charm ofnovelty and secrecacy which surround ed it has been dispelled and it is now being viewed in its true light, as the most odious and infamous orgaoization that was ever established in the Union, and which could never carry out its purposes without subverting our free institu tions. In city after city, and town after town, Its black flag is being struck to the glorious national standard of democracy, the only true American emblem of freedom."

He has had oppor- tunities, denied to many, sufficient to convince a gentleman of his comprehensive mind and studious habits, that ignorance alone of the history of nations and people may excuse a man for doubting that liberty is Catholic vir- tue Who does not know that the Catholic re- public of Venice endured fourteen hundred years, and of these nearly mine hundred were years of democratic liberty and domestic hap piness. The republics of Switzerland were distinguished into aris.ocratc cantons and de- mocratic. The aristocratc were Protestant, and the democratic Catholic And nearer home, Catholic South America instituted many new republics on the broad basis of popular liberty What about the judicial system? The trial by lJwy and legislataUe representation They were all the work of Catholic hands in old Catholic times.

 But to enter the land of the free and the home of the brave. What denomination of christians was it, let me ask in all seriousness and candor, that gave the first bright example of religious toleration? This is an interesting inquiry. Every man who hates falsehood and loves truth feels its importance and may repeat with impatience the all important question: What was the first christian society that efec- tually disarmed persecution of legal power and conceded to all without shadow of restriction, freedom of conscience in this country? I an- swer the question: It was the Roman Catholics in communion with the Pope. The Catholic State of Maryland had the honor, through it's hrst legislature, of enacting the first law of lber ty and of perfect freedom of conscience; and letit be told by every republican and patriotic son of Arkansas from the Missouri line to Red river, that the statute that gave civil and reli- glous liberty to all without distinction of creed or country was passed in 1649, and drawn up by the hand of a member of the learned and aI- tustraous order of the Jesuits. The history, says Baacroft of the settlers of Maryland, the on- ly one of the early British colonies that was founded by body of Catholics, is the history of benevolence gratitude, and toleratiOn. ""The Roman Catholics who were oppressed by the laws of England were sure to find a peaceful asylum in the quiet harbors of the Chesapeake, and there too, Protestants were sheltered against Protestant intolerance.'

 From Maryland, Roman Catholic (Char- les Carroll of Carrollton) is found walking into the Hall of Independence and pledging his life, his honor, and million and half of dollars in defence of his country. Another Carroll, who became the first Archbishop of Baltimore was selected by General Washington and in company with Franklin and Chase, sent on a special and confidential mission to Canada. It is not necessary to remind the grateful Ameri- can. whose doctrine is opposed to persecution, of the services rendered in the struggle against British oppression, by Rochambeau, Kosc- usko, Dekalb, Plury, Lynch, Fitzimons and John Barry, an Irish Catholic from the town of Wexford, whom the chief comman- ders appointed the first commodore of the American navy, and the confdence reposed was never tarnshed.

 When the revolutionary cause was in great danger for the want of funds to supprot the army and the proud and naughty ""invincipes"" of Europe, within sight of the American camps, Gen. Washington was compelled in 178O to appeal to individuals for pecunary aid which was promptly answered by the members of the society of the friendly sons of St. Patrick in Philadelphia with the following subscriptions:

 Robert Morris, f10,OOO; Blair NcClenehen, flOOOO; William Bingham, f2O,OOO; J. NJ.

 How could it have entered the mind of any sane man, to suppose that Catholics and for eigners who voluntarily subscribed, and paid the above sum of one hundred and seventeen thou sand pounds in Pennsy yIvania currency, toward purchasing food and rayment for brave army, were hostile to republicanism, and dangerous to civil and religious liberty; and yet such and more is the language used by Capt. Pike and his associates, last June, in that very city of brotherly love- where Catholics and foreigners were on the day that tried mems souls found faithful to the calls of patriotism.

headquarters of the Abslitionists and the
Emigrant Aid Society. The negro woman
was traced up to where she was found by
Messrs. Wade and Robinson. Messrs.
w. and R. demanded the negro, and she
was refused to be given up. The aboli-
tionists were then told if they did not give
up the negro their town would be In ashes

1t will be seen by the above, that the


scum of the population of the Eastern


States, who are endeavoring to monopolise


this Territory. have commenced their ne
farious practices; and, unless summary


punishment be dealt out to the pitiful scoun-
drels, acihout delay, few months will see
| regularly organised g underground rail-

sort to decisive steps in this matter, the la


bor and expense of the late election Will


only have achieved fraction of its ends.
! We owe it-not only tothe protection of our
| property, hut to the noble aid rendered us
| by the South in the recent triumphant strug-
| ole with the minions of Abolitionism-tha


the thieving propensities of the ""negro
| philanthropists' should be ""nipt in the


bud d''-should receive sudden and effec-


tual check. Missouri has sent her hardy


sons amongst us that she may be protected
| from innovations upon her property; and it


is our duty to see that she be not disappoin-
ted in her expectations.


If we would rid ourselves of a set of


hirelings, sent into our midst with the ex-


press view of infringing upon our rights


andS committing depredations upon our


property, we must act. promptly, and with


an energy and earnestness Of purpose that


will give Abolitionists distinctly to under
| stand that Kansas is not a field for the
successful operation Of their schemes Of
| piunder. Tisvain to procrastinate-it twill
only increase the courage of the Abolition
ist. and make the removal Of the evil a


matter Of greater difficulty.


Many means could be devised whereby
these unbearable nuisances could be re-


moved; but the most efectual method that
recurs to our mind, is to inAict instant pun
ishment upon the offender. We are not,


except in extreme cases, an aJmirer OF


Judge Lynch's code Of practice, nor of
sclf-constituted powers; but, under the cir
cumstanees, we opinc the organization Of
Vigilance Committees throughout the Ter
ritory, for the protection Of slave property,


would not only be julicious policy, bu.


one fully justifablc in the premises. IN
deed, it would be well for every pro-slave-
ry citizen to consider himself member of
Il Vigilance Committee TO see that restitu-
ton be made for any injury sustained at
the hands of Abolitionists. In every In
stance where an Abolitionist is known to
have run OF, or to have attempted to entice
away 4 slave, let an escort be afforded him
to Missouri, and there he will find ready
supply Of boots to facilitate his progress be-
yond the confines OF that State. 1t would


be well, too, not to let the culprit depart
from the Territory without an ample coat
of tar. and feathers, and the map of the


United States legibly printed on his back


with that delicate pencil, known as the


CATO -nine-tails. Laws, at present, we


are without; but were laws of the most
stringent nature enacted-which doubtless


Will be done when the Legislature meets
they are too dilatory in there action-there


are too many loop-holes for their evasion,


for them to accomplish the ends desired.


Protection and redress must come from


certain more source, and that source lies in


the action Of the people interested.


1t is with pleasure we note the decided


tone III which our cotemporaries of the
Kicapoo Pioneer, and also of the Kansas
Herald, express themselves on this subject.
Touching our own vicinity, we have no
fears of annoyance from Abolition impu-


dence; for the few, if any, who may have


settled in this region know that the spirit


Of the people will not brook the slightest
indication OF an encroachment upon their


property. Apart from this, however, we


are as sensitive regarding the actions of
Abolitionists elsewhere as though our i'm


mediate neighborhood was thickly beset by


them; and are eyer ready to second, with


such aid as we may command, any steps


taken for the protection OF the property of


pro-slarery citizens throughout the Terri


tory. As first step, the town of Law

Great Excitement at Doniphnn, X. Tan


Abolitionist KiIledi",,"We learn from Mr.. Newman, of Doniphan,
that Samuel Collins, of that place, was killed
this morning about sunrise by Pat. Laughlin.
AS far as we have been able to learn, the
circumstances are as follows:


Mr.. Laughlin recently made an exposition
of the midnight organization existing among
the Abolitionists in the Territory, called the
""Grand Encampment and Regiments of the
Kansas Legion"" Collins, it seems, is colonel Of
one of the regiments in this order, and de-
termined to force Mr. Laughlin to retraction,
or kill him. In accordance with this determine
tion he and some twelve brother Abotionists
proceeded, this morning, to seek out Mr.. Laugh.
I'm, and demanded an unqualified retraction
of his recent confession, and upon Mr.. LIS re-
iusing to make any concession whatever, Collins
Immediately snapped his gun at him, (Laugh-
lin) and then fred at him, but fortunately the
weapon was turned aside bya spectator. Mr.
Laughln then drew revolver and fred upon
his opponent, killing him instantly.


We regret to learn that Mr.. L. was DANCE.
rously hurt in the conflict by knife wound in
the side. We are also informed that his
friend, Mr.. Lynch, member of the pro.slavery
party, was wounded in the head by the dis
charge Of a gun.


Thus il is, that the fight SO long talked about
has begun, and it is to be hoped that it will not
be discontinued until Kansas Territory is rid
Of this higher law and bloodthirsty set of
negro thieves and outlaws."

A good deal of interest has been manifested says
the Boston Journal, in the proceedings in the Mu-
nicipal Court during the past fortnight before
which the appealed liquor cases of Paran Stevens,
Harvey d. Parker George Young, and others, came
up In every case but one, that of Lewis Rice, of
the American House, the jury returned verdict of
not guilty; the ground being want of evidence.
Mr.. Rce's case was not tried. Witnesses sum-
moned on behalf of the government were afflicted
with a singular want of memory, as to whether
they ever purchased any liquor Of the defendants
This result was what a majority of the people an
ticipated. Since the trials, no new complaints
have been made against these parties; though they
are daily and hourly violating the law The
working of the law is showing it to be, what many
of the warmest friends of temperance have ever
believed it to be- impractcable

the crops of wheat and rye throughout the
whole OF North Europe also are deficient. and
especially in the Baltic pro ovnces and the info
rior of Germany, where flour is at this rnornant
selling at 7Os. per sack. In fact, the imnorta-
tion of breadstuffs from these sources and ou
others, except the United States, including
Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, italy and
Egypt, will hardly be sufficient to meet tho do

than furnish the balance of thirteen or fourteen
millions, of the deficit in France. Hence giv-
ing the surplus from these sources to France
there still remains the vacuum in England.
ranging from capacity of thirty to fifty mil
lions OF bushels, to fiji. For this supply the
English importers can only look to the United
States; and if the supply--say forty million
oushels-be obtained from this country, we
shall send more grain to England than was ex.
ported in wheat and flour to all ports of the
world during the year 1855. Our expectations
for that year, according to the New York
Economist, amounted to less than twenty mine
million bushels. The quota exported to Eng.
land, according to the English Board of Trade
returns, was an average of 976,93O quarters.
Or less than eight million bushels per annum.

IT. then, as has been assumed, the whole
lvailable surplus exported last year from the
United States to every part of THE world, should
,e supplied to England, there of course will
remain deficit. And even should we be able
o export this required amount, we shall be as

in aiding and abetting the running off of

the last to justify people in taking the law

vide ample punishment for offences COM

which community are justiiable in re-
sorting to any means to protect themselves
and punish offenders they are in cases
where the law makes no provisions for such
punishment. We look upon the destruction
of the Abolition printing office in Park

the lives of the citizens in that neighbor-

the well-being ofthe ,Slave-holding popula-

us such valuable assistance in driving ne

ton to Kansas.",,"which 1t may be said with strict truth
that they print and publish, either under
the fear of Lynch law or under the in
spiration of its spirit, have stigmatized
our fellow citizens, who have nobly vol
unteered to pioneer freedom into Kansas,
as ""crime-polluted and paupers."" We
refer more particularly to the Richmond
Examiner, but the calumny has gone the
rounds of the slavery newspapers.


From what we know of our neighbors
and our acquaintance who have gone
to Kansas, and all that we have heard
and read of others, we feel confident
that a more baseless and libelous
assertion could not be made. This
emigration is as pure as that of the Pill
grims or the Huguenots, and more disin-
terested than either.


But admitting for arguments sake,
that the assertion was true, would it not
be highly commendable in these men and
women to arouse themselves, in the face
of brutal and murderous threats and
outrages; to this effort for independence
and a new life p? What better could they
do for themselves, their families, or their
country, than to start afresh on a virgin
soil, remote from painful recollections
and depressing influences? In all ages
colonization has received its greatest i'm
pulses from the necessities, sufferings
and often despair of those who have
achieved it. Even criminals of deep
dye, have been more nationally employed
in laying the foundation of new States
than in dangling idly in the air, which
Voltaire justly called the poorest use that
could be made of them. They obtain
in new settlements the consolation of q
true democratic equality, the encourage
ment of sympathy, and the purifying
and strengthening influences of con
scious independence. Hence respectable
communities and great States have grown
out of penal colonies, and men and wo-
men who cleft their country for theiI
country's good' have made a good coun-
try tor themselves.


For example, Virginia, magma mater
magma rtrun., the mother of nearly every
one of those States which propagate the
malicious libel to which we allude, ant
which would be aristocratic and inhumar
even if it were not false, was the recep
tacle of a population transported from
the mother country as commutation fol
hanging and other terrible punishment
OF felony. 1t would seem as if the mos
desperate of these felons had got th'
elixir of life, had now gathered in Mis-
souri,, and appointed the most accom-
Iplished of their gang TO be the legislator
of Kansas. A lively impression of tn
foregoing historical fact is conveyed in
passage of Defoe, author of Robinson
Crusoe, who was nearly cotemporar,
with the commencement of the system
of deportation, and was precisely cotem
porary with that state of colonial societ,
which he describes:


/ 1--WE arrived in York River, in Virgin

habitants of that colony were of tw'

by the masters of the ships, to be sold a

fported after having been found guilty 0
crimes punishable with death. Whel
they come here, says she, we make NJ
difference. The planters buy them, ant
they work together in the field, till thei
time is out. When that is expired, the,

themselves. For they have certain
number of acres of land allotted then


by the country, and they go to work +

it with tobacco and corn for their owl

Horrible Outrage.


Two CHILDREN MURDERED ny THEIR OWN
FATHER.-One Of the most revolving tragc-
dies that it has ever been our painful duty to
record in the columns Of the Rcpor-
ter, was perpetrated at an carly hour yes.
tcrday morning, some three miles distant
from Dover. 1t viii be rocolected by most
of our readers, that about four months
SINCE We gave an account of the arrest and
imprisonment Of a notorious bad character,
named George Parker, negro, for an Us.
sault on one Of our most cstimable citizens.
For this offence he was committed to the
county Jail but, before the term expired
for which he was incarccratcd, he made good
his escape, by breaking through the wall
OF the cell in which he was confined and
although diligcnt search was made for him
and liberal reward offered for his capture,
he managed to cvade second arrest.


1t seems for the past few weeks hc had
been living at home with his family, near
Walkers Mills, on tho Kcnton Road. His
family consisted of his wife, three small
children anda nurse.


At ian carly hour yesterday morning Par
kcr attempted 10 shoot through the head the
woman who lived as nurse in his family;
bnt she threw up her right arm, andMherein
received the greater portion of the charge;
her face and head received but little damage.


Soon after the commission Of this act, ho
proceeded to the house of negro, named
Charles Gibbs. Here, with the aid of al
axe, he forced an entrance, and made after
Gibbs, threatening to shoot him. Gibbs cs-
capped, and ran to the house Of Mr. Isaac
Moore, in the neighborhood, for assistance.
Mr.. Moore, with one of his farm hands,
started for Gibbs house. On the road they
overlook several others, and thus combined,
they imagined themselves sufficiently strong
to arrest Parker and prevent him from doing
any further damage. But in this they were
mistaken. Arriving at Gibbs house, thew
found Parker still in it, cutting and .lashing
away with an axe at everything within his
reach and hc at the same time threatening
| to shoot any one or more who would attempt
| to touch him.


The party finding that they could not
master the dcspcradc sent to Dover for De-
puty-Shcriif Cooper, who, in company with
! Constable Arthurs, proceeded to the scene
| Of the disturbance, which was now Parker's
own premises; he having left Gibbs after

the children into it, and soon afterwards


confronted, with his gun in hand, the party


who desired to arrest him, and who were


within gunshot distance Of the house. In


their efforts to secure Parker, they shot him


no less than three times, the ttird and last


shot taking effect in his face, cutting through


the under lip, and knocking out two or three


left eye, is quite badly shattered.


In fact, his whole face is filled with shot
and more or less injured. A man named


Cole, we believe, fired at him. and was thus


successful in his aim, when Parker rushed
furiously at him and they clinchcd The


friends Of Mr.. Cole now ran up, and after


much difficulty succeeded in getting the


wretch to the ground and tying him. Al


this juncture, the Deputy Sheriff, Cooper,
and Constable Arthurs, reached the ground,
and quickly assisted in their further securing
him in heavy irons. The fire in the hous,
was now speedily cxtinguished, and the re-

lynch Law on salmon Creek.",,"


Mr.. J. w. Evans, writing to the editors Of the
Mountain Herald from Bestville, klamath Co.,
gives the particulars of hanging affair that
took place at that locality on the 10th inst


The victim was young man by the name Of
Moran, born and raised in the city of New York,
and who, it will be recolected by our readers,
on Christmas night last, stabbed to the heart a
man by the name OF Craig, in the Ell Dorado
Bowling Saloon, on Sawyer's Bar. He then
made his escape, but was subsequently, arrested
at the head Of Scott Valley while making his
way towards Shasta, and taken to Bestyille and
delivered into the hands of the anihorities-
While the prisoner was being examined before
Justice Evans, the mob hastily organized, took
the prisoner from the hands of the officers, Sc
lected jury of twelve men, gave him counsel,
and then, under the eye of Judge Lynch gave
him trial. The jury rendered verdict Of
g Guilty of Manslaughter in the First Degree
The mob then, in violationof the verdict, hung
the prisoner in halt an hour after the rendering
of their own jury. He died almost without a
struggle.


This terrible tragedy grew out of the ycircnm-
stance of the whipping of an old man, Davis,
by scoundrel named McDivitt, who was SUBJ
sequently arrested by the mob, and, after re-
ceiving twenty-one lashes on his bare back, was
compelled to leave the river.


The Herald of the Goth says:


="" Messrs. Coleman, of Marysvie and Hearn,
of this place, have formed ""A company for the
purpose of establishing and erecting Tele-
graph line from Marysvie to this city raa Shas-
Ia; also, branch of the same from the latter

A man named George Brooks, an
Irishman or Scotchman, was murdered
in Oroyille, on Wednesday evening last
The murder was committed at the St
Charles, low groggery which has been
productive of riots and disturbances for
some time past. The deceased was
killed instantly, beng shot through the
heart. Five persons were arrested, and
placed in Jail on Thursdly evening
We have made several efforts but have
failed to obtain the names Of tie persons
implicated. Brooks, the murdered man
worked on Union Bar, last summer.
1t is said til t deceased entered the Sa-
loon, and commenced to scuffie with some
one in pleasant manner, but it soon
became serious, and resulted in instant
death The Jury Of Inquest were una
bic to ascertain which Of three persons
fired the shot; hut the investigation of
the Grpnd Jury, which we presume
took place yesterday, will, doubtless,
place the matter in It's true light.


During Wednesday night and Thurs
day evening, Oroville was the scene Of
the utmost excitement News of the
murder soon spread throughout Oroville
and Lynchburg, and ""a large crowd col
lected and raised the cry of-""IIang
them %"" Hang the murderers - The
fortunate presence of Deputy Sherids
Goodrich, French and Hobart, who
promptly arrested the prisoners, and
summoned posse to their aid, prevent
cd the crowd from accomplishing another
act of mob law. The crowd at one time
procured a rope and made rush for the
building in which the prisoners were
confined, guarded by the officers and
others, but were met with irmness and
determination, that caused them to dis
perse. One person jumped into the
crowd and hacked the rope into pieces
with his Bowie knife Another person
who commenced speech in favor OF
mob law, was promptly arrested, and
confined with the prisoners Having
time for reflection, he concladcd he wo'd
60 home, to his family, if the officers
would give him permission He was al
lowed to depart in peace. Those who
witnessed the excitement, report that
the uprising of the crowd was indeed
fearful to behold. 1t is but justice, how
ever, to say that the citizens of Orovillc
sustained the officers in the discharge Of
their duty with alAcrity and zeal They
had reason to become exasperated. The
groggery in which the deed was fruitful
in fights and disturbances, and had be-
come an eyesore to the community. W e
doubt not buo that reflection will satisfy
all thet the course pursued by the au-
thorilies was the proper one, and that all
will rejoice that OroviIle was not made
the scene of mob law and violence.


So great was the crowd, when the Off
GERS started for BidwelI with the prison
ers, that a rope was drawn across the

street, and guards stationed to keep the
crowd in check, while the prisoners We're
being placed in the wagon. As they
left, the cry of clown with the house,""
was raised by the crowd, with what eff,
feet we have not learned.


Mr.. Snyder, one of the Editors of the
North Californian, came up with the Off
GERS. His usually good-natured face,
locked as though it had not rested for
ferty-eight hours."

nected with tie lynching of james Moran, at
Sawyer's Bar, on Salmon River. The state
ment is written by j.. w. Evans, a Justice OF
the Peace at Bestyille, Klamath county. The
difficulty originated thus:


A man named McDivitt, at Sawyers Bar

named Davis. Another person, named Rob

any man who would be guilty of such an act
McDivitt Craig and Moran stripped of to

and had some, when the latter told him he
wanted to fight McDivitt, not him. Moran.-
The latter, however, followed Craig up, when
Craig with his open hand gently tapped Moran
on the face the latter told him not to do SO
any MORE remarking that it might hurt
Craig tapped him again as before, but rather
harder; whereupon Moran instantly drew o
butcher-knife, from his pocket, as is supposed,
but no one saw him draw the knife) aud stab
bed Craig to the heart, who instantly staggered
back, and, without uttering word, fell dead.


Moran made his escape, but was subsequent
ly arrested on a warrant issued by Justice
Evans, and brought to Bestvile. The popu-
lace rescued him from the authorities, took
him to Sawyer's Bar had trial by jury OF
twelve persons, who found him guilty Of man
slaughter in the first degree, gave him half an
hour to converse with the Rev. Mr.. Register,
and then hung him. He died almost without
struggle. Moran was young man, born
and raised in New Y FORK city.


The citizens afterwards took McDivitt for
the assault upon Davis, gave him q lashes on
the bare back, and compelled him to leave the

duced thousands from the north as well as
the south to select Kansas for their future
home. Having moved there with their fam
lilies from all parts OF the country, these citi-
zens were called upon by proclamation in due
form to assemble and exercise their prom
ised Sovereignty at the ballot box. They
assembled; but instead of choosing their
own legislators, bands of tens, of ffties,
and of hundreds, came with arms in their
hands from the the neighboring State Of
Missouri, and overawed and outvoted them.

P3accTviiie.",,"


From various reliable sources we have in
formation of a most dreadful tragedy at a
place about two miles from Placerville, on
last Friday morning.


A man by the name of Crane, it appears,
had been paying his addresses to a Miss
Newman. of that place. He proposed mar
riage which she declined. He persisted,
she still refused. He then drew revolver.
she caught it and threw it up so that the
first ball done no damage She then let 90
the pistol and rushed to the door. and as
she retreated he fired three more shots, each
of which took effect. There is no hopes of
her recovery. She is reported as a most am
iableyoung lady. Crane Immediately fed,
but on last Saturday was taken under the
following circumstances, which we extract
from telegraphic dispatch to the State
Tribune, dated at Diamond Springs, Aug.
llth.


This morning the inmates of the house
where the tragedy occurred were astOniSh-
ed to see Crane walking towards the house.
The father of Miss Newman rushed out. gun
in hand with the intention of adding still
more to this frightful scene but was pre-
vented by the influence OF persons already
on the ground. at the same time Crane eX-
tended both hands and said. shoot, shoot,
for we both want to 90 together""
To al l,o |,
o'clock p. NJ. a large crowd had assembled
No undue excitement was manifested until
the officers spoke Of taking the prisoner to
the comfy seat for trial, whereupon several
voices exclaimed. the prisoner shall not
leave the ground alive""


| 1t soon became evident that the civil an
thOrities could do nothing as the crowd at
once proceeded III accordance with the reg
ulatiOns of Judge Lynch. A Judge. Sher-
if and Jury were chosen from the people
assembled, also 4 persons as counsel for the
prisoner. A. this time there are no officers
on the ground. They are just removing the
prisoner to a cabin for the purpose of Civ
ing him trial. Prisoner says he would do
the same deed again under the same circum-

has broken into the cabin and escaped with
the prisoner and is on his way to the Jail.

our home interests-the political sanbedrin
of California has uniformly kept them from
the view of the people, and has cunningIv

State. In our legislative halls and in orr
cabinet councils, the interests of Califomi,
have been subordinate topics to the polt
cal issues which have convulsed the o1
States since 1898. What are these isspe,
to us? California has asked for reform, and
she has been answered by a clamor about
the annexation of Cuba. She has asked
for a railroad, and the response has been

asked for protection against Lynch law, il.

The main duty Of California at this unctur.
is to act for herself.


The questions which have caused such Sc.
rious agitations in the old States are the
ones which we wish to ignore and discard
from this State. Let us rest assured that
the Union is safe-that liberty strikes its
root too deep and strong in American soil
to be so easily and suddenly uprooted. But
even did danger impend, it is not in the
power of California to rescue the continen:
from its imminent DOOM Yet, we too, owe
a duty to the cOnfederacy in this question,
and our sectional isolation enables US to
take noble and impressive stand upon it.
Removed as we are, by position and actual
interest from its baneful influence, we should
allay instead Of participating in its agita-
tion.


Analyse this slavery question. 1t hasno
proud principle; it is the mere ebulIiton Of
sectional antipathies. Side by side, in
friendly contact, repose the historic States
of Pennsylvania anG Maryland-the one s
free and the other slave State-the Dor

come flush up to those of the young ga1:
Ohio, and the pioneer Of the Western plains
the Missourian, has only to stretch his arms
across an imaginary line to shake hands
with his friend from the granary of the west,
Illinois. Here at the very line of contact
between the free and slave States, there
comparatively little feeling on the subject
OF their different domestic institutions and
would be none at all were they let alone
but exactly in proportion as werecede from
this line, where, were the question one Of
principle, we would see deadly border
warfare, do we find the antagonism growing
stronger and stronger, and instead Of Penn

Massachusetts, and Mississippi are at log

our voices to swell the clamor? Why en-

whom we sympathise. Our true course 10

We are just in receipt of exciting news
from Walkers Expedition party in Nicara-
qua. A battle had been fought at .Riyas,
a town about II miles from San Jnan NJ
Col. Walker with his party proceeded on
the 2Sth of June from Realeio to Riyas.-t
After marching miles TO little place
called Solo, they found. a party of soldiers
of about 90 or SO, who ran for Rivas, pur-
sued by Walker, who made stand outside
the town, and the next day, began skir-
mishing, and close fighting coming on the
native force of his party bolted almost er.
masse some few however stood their
ground. Walker found himself surrounds
| ed, but fought his way through, and on the
Both he arrived S. Juan, where he,and his
party, numbering about SIS men, embark
| ed on board schooner for Realeio, as IT.
supposed. Walker reported 5 men killed
and 6 wounded of his own party, and so
| to 100 natives killed. The attacking party
is said to have been 700 strong. Among
| the list of those killed is Mr. Achilles
Kewen, gentleman of this city, who was
much admired for his honorable and
chlvalric bearing, and whose death is deep
! ly regretted by large circle OF friends and
and acquaintances.a He was shot through
the neck, as he had his rifle levelled.-|
Col. Walker is reported to have been
wounded by ball, which passed by his left
temple and took away a piece of the skull
and the eyebrow.


The news, as might be expected, has
created great excitement in our city. There
| is no doubt that Col Walker has been
grossly deceived by the Leon party, to unite
his fortunes with which in the present
revolution he undertook this expedition in
a sport of chivalric adventure. His party
| is represented to be in very destitute con-
dition, and there is strong sympathy felt
for them, especially as the opinion is that
some of the Leon party, with the charac-
teristic treachery of these natives, betrayed


Walker in regard to the Rivas affair. Col.
Walker was on his way to meet the Leon
party, when the battle occurred.


The Nicaragua S. S. Sierra .Nevada,
which arrived last night with these news
| from San Juan, also brings intelligence Of
a more frightful description. A few days
out from San Juan, the cholera broke out
among the passengers, and has made fear
full havoc. The official account by the
on the passage up; but the passengers
state a much larger number, as high as
forty. There are about twenty cases now
On board the steamer and In the Marine
hospital It is to be hoped that the salu-
brity of our climate will check the ravages
of this fearful epidemic, and that the dis
ease will not spread to any extent in the
city, although it prevailed here for short
time In the years 1850 and 1851. It is
certainly very culpable on the part of the
proper authorities, that we have no quaran-
tine law whatever in this port. But what
is far more culpable in the matter than this
IS the cold-blooded attempt on the part of
the agents of this line of steamers to sup
press and misrepresent the fearful mortali-
ty. The fact of the epidemic having bro
ken out on the voyage was suppressed at
first from the Press, no mention of it hay-
ing been made In the vessels memoranda.
1t is also charged by many of the passen-
gers that the number of deaths has been
m1srepresented in the official list, and that
the names of manv-of the unfortunate vic
TINS are not included IN tais report of the
deaths. we have heard many passengers
say that they counted As or so dead bodies
thrown overheard. The only object of any
misrepresentation of this sort on the part Of
the officers of the steamer might be to allay-l
the fears of travellers on this route; and If
so, the parties to such MISREPRESENTATION
deserve the severest penalties of Lynch
law


Ofthe events in the city and State of the |
last fortnight, l have not great deal to
say. There has been some public excite
men: In relation to the officers of Adams s
Co.'S, as charges have been made againt
Mr.. L G. Woods, who was the resident
partner here, and Mr.. A. A. Cohen. of |
having perpetrated frauds to the extent of |
$400 900 in tho sale of gold dust to Page |
Bacon & Co., at various times since 1850 |
and previous to the failure of the two houses.
The charge is that poor dust was colored
by chemical processes, and mixed up SO as
to resemble that of the finest quality, and
that it was sold in small parcels by decoys, |
who were disguised as miners. The gen. |
erat belief however seems to be that these |
extraordinary charges of fraud have no
foundation IN fact, and that it is case of
malicious prosecution. A fraud of such |
a gigantic nature does really appear in-
credible, but then it is difficult to assign any
limits to- the iniquities of San Francisco
Ill IL."

 Mr. Stephens-I have read the obligation and the whole of it. What follows in the cere- mony of initiation, 1 intend to read Wha the gentleman calls the admonitions comes afte the third degree l expect That l will come to after while, Ii the strength to speak so long will permit. This is the ceremony which fol lows initiation into the first degree. But one word as to the concluding part of this oath.

 Now who commissioned you, or any of you to denOunce any man as a traitor to his God or his counuy?"" Whence is your authority . | T NNha+ Cto, C,,,,,t ,,.o..1 Spanish Inquisiton, ever gave you such power over your fellow citizens? But what follows is in these words:

 part of this, 1t Is true, may be considered admonitory; but the most of it relates to the signs and countersigns the passwords and the ""grip' with the "" ""sig gn of cauton"" and the ""cry of distress"" all of which the new disci- pie, or neophyte, is given to understand he is bound to respond to, unless 1t be physically im- possible-and under which if some ""worthv brother' abolitionist at the North should come out here, and be taken up and be about to be lynched, as he ought to, he would confidently expect to be protected, if there were any mem- bers of the order about. For the ""cry of dis tress'' must: under the obligation, be responded to, ""unless it be physically impossible"" Is that the admonition the gentleman wanted read?

 Mr. Green again interrupted and was un- derstood by MT. S. to say, if he expected to be sustained by the people of Columbia county he had better make no points with him.

 Mr. S., continuing said: My object, sir, is not to make points with you, or any other man. It is to present to the people here the principles of party, which 1 think radically wrong, xe- ceedingly mischievous and dangerous to the Re. public This I shall do, without any reference to the effect 1t may have upon my being sus- tained either by you, or by the people of Co., lumbla county, or without any regard to the ef- feet it may have either upon your vote or your influence. have no soft phases CT honeyed words to utter, either for your vote or that of others 1 am on TO mealy mouthed expcdi- tion in addressing the people of this district. shall speak respectfully but kly--candidly, but boldly let the consequences be what they may.

We have read with some care and attention
the address put forth by the late Know Nothing
State Convention, ''to the American people Of

Francisco who replied upon being charged as

paradoxes, falsities and an unmitigated pollti
cal selfshness, unparalleled by any similar doc.
ument from any State or party


The address starts at two forty pace on
the grandlloquent track--listen:


BROTHERS :-Californa has been the best tax.
ed and the worst governed country of which
| there is any record. In vain have the onerous
| exactons of government been paid without
stint. In vain have thus far all the sources of
| peaceful reformation been exhausted. Long suf-
fering has not propiiated our rulers, nor has
| indig gnant remonstrance been able to inspire
terror Evil has followed evil-calamity has
been heaped upon calamity, until the young
State which yesterday filled the world with her
renown, to-day lies bankrupt, criine-ridden and
abject


Well, now, there is beautiful picture for
you, of one of the sovereign States of this great
Republican contederacy,-a State, too which,
yesterday filled the world with her renown!""
What perfect Neros her Governors and Legisla-
tors nave been ""Long suffering could not pro-
pitiate, nor indignant remonstrance inspire ter
ror"" in their base, cowardly, faithless, tyranni-
cal hearts! We suggest that the authors of this
horrible state of affairs, who have aided and
abetted crimes, bankruptcies, and other felon-
les in general, be brought to condign punish.
ment by this new, pure and immaculate party,
who are to lift us from the depths of our
present mseries and degradation to position
which will again 'fll the world with our re-
nown."" We tremble with fear at the thought
of the stern justice about to be meeted out to
the dying administration of this State then, too,
come the rewards to be conferred upon the vr-
| tuous, patriotic, disinterested, unspotted, un-
brIbeable, unaspiring sons of midnight patriot
ism-honors totally unexpected, and only to be
accepted at great sacrifice of personal feeling,
and through the very quintessence of unalloyed
devotedness to love of Country.


AS we read on, the magniloquent pace on the
road 10 ruin becomes tremendous Hear:


""Intemperance and corruption banquet in cor
ruption in high places in the land, and bold and
bloody crime stalks unchecked in our midst


There, Californians, you are about at the end
of your rope-nearly ""done for.'' Very little
short of the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah can
possibly atone for your wckedness! Repent
ance and faith in this new party alone can save
you: How grateful you should be to those who
are about to resurrect you from such an alarm
ing abyss of Bankruptcy, Drunkenness, Crime
and Infamy


Being slightly blown. the pace slackens to
half reasoning canter, and brings slap up the
""Nigger question: Here, probably little
weaker from the great effort on the start, the
address runs somewhat wide of the truth; it
| says:


""Here at the very line of contact between the
free and slave States, there is comparatively lit
tie feeling on the subject of their different do
mestic institutions, and would be none at all
were they let alone; but exactly in proportion
as we recede from the line, where, the
question Of principle, we wonld see dead
ly border warfare, do we End the antagonism
growing stronger and stronger, aud Instead of
Pennsy lvania finding fault with her neighbor,
Massachusetts and Mississippi at logger
heads""


Evidently the person or committee who draft
ed the address never lived on the Border or
speak theoretically. Certainly they have me-
elected to read the papers for the last twelve
months, or they might have stumbled
casiona notice of mobs, arsons lynchinss, and
murders, on the very borders Of all of the States
mentioned as lying pacific and quiet beside her
free neighbor. If the scenes lately enacted in
Kansas, on the borders of Missouri, between the
pro and anti slavery factions, show but ''com-
paratively little feeling on the subject of their
different domestic institutional we can only
add; God help the poor ""Borderers'' when their
feelings are properly warmed upon the subject
This slavery question is decidedly an amman
ageable plank in the Know Nothing platforms.
The champion Know Nothing State, Massachu-
sets. declares the anti-savery plank to be one
Of the most prominent features Of Know-noth-
insism whilst other platforms, manufactured
in States not quite so far down East have une-
guivocally given us TO understand that the ""ne-
gro question"" is to be ignored by the party in
TITO. One thing is sure, it is the mine which
will inevitably be sprung. and is certain to
prove their destruction great National par

of Tuesday last:


Yesterday afternoon the citizens about
Mission Dolores were shocked at the murder
Of one Of their most respectable citizens
Mr.. Joseph 3. West The killing was Der.
petrated by two men, named John Marion
and - Brace, persons Of suspicious repu-
tation. whom Mr.. West believed to have
been guilty Of robbing his house.


On Sunday evening Dir. West, accompaD,
led by officer Rideout and Capt. Cunning
ham, visited the house inhabited by Marion
and Brace, when in place Of finding The par
ties, they found relics of pair Of mail bags
robbed some time since and some guns. Dis
tolls, etc. Being satisfied that the parties
were offenders, officer Rideout returned to
town for assistance, and in the meantime
MesSrS. West and Cunningham stopped On
the ground to watch for the robbers From
their hiding place they soon saw Brace and
Marion come to the house, and after a strict
look around as if suspecting the premises
had been visited, both Of them commenced
looking ABOUT, TO see II the persons who had
been there could be observed.


Unfortunately Mr.. West exhibited HIM
self, and perceiving it too late to escape
rode directly up to the rascals. Brace in
CURED Of Mr.. West what he wanted. to
which the latter answered nothing, where
upon Brace leveed his revolver, and saying
""I GU shall have it, fred seven shots, three
OF which took effect in the body of Mr.
West, from which he soon expired


Mr.. West came. from New York, and was
a glass stainer by trade. He leaves wife
and three children to mourn his. sad fate
The murderers seized the horse Of MIR. West
and both fled upon him; but they left the
animal after short ride, and took it aloot
towards San jose The citizens of the
Mission are in the greatest state Of excite
ment, and it is to be feared that Lynch law
will be resorted to if the guilty parties are
found."

digsM.


The Lord Mayor Of London gave a public
banquet, November 9th. Among the notables
present were Lord Cardigan, Admiral Sir
Charles Napier, Captains Lynch, Maxsee, and
other officers, returned from the Crimea and
the Baltic. Enthusiastic cheering greeted the
appearance Of Cardigan and Napier The
Lord Mayor proposed the toast Of ""the Navy""
coupling with it the names of Admiral Napier
and Captain Lynch. We make room for the
conclusion Of Sir Charles's spicy speech:


""Now, did not expect that the admiralty
could join in that clamor. ] say, certainly
never expected that they could be so mean and
desPicable Ia laugh aud hear, hear as to join
in that clamor, in order to bring odium upon

power to bring honor and credit to his country.


Hear, hear, hear. What did do? ! sent

ralty, stating to them my opinions, and what

what those opinions were. Hear, hear, hear.
given, one of which thought was certain to
destruction. What did the admiralty do? Now,
!
that there may be no mistake whatever, because,
if the government have the least spirit about
them, they will Immediately discharge me and
turn me out of the service. Hear, hear, and
laughter.l The admiralty perverted my lam
guage. They not only did that, but they wrote


me- the most goading letters they could possibly
write; they asked me why did not take Swea-
borg, and do this, that, and the other. They
received my letter, giving an account how
Sweaborg might be taken, upon the 4th Of Oc-
tober, the very day the reports reached this
country Of the taking of Sebastopol.


""On the 9th Of October the news came that
Sebastopol was not taken; but the admiralty
had not the plain straightforward dealing or
the honesty to write and apologize to me; but
they perverted what had written and which
gave them plan for the taking Of Sweaborg
/ was not going to stand that. A laugh, and
cheers. am not the man to put up with an
insult. Renewed cheers / demonstrated
most-strongly; but, after all my remonstrances
the admiralty persisted still in saying that

was not going to be driven into all this, par
ticularly as Sir James Graham, during the
whole time was in the Baltic, had written to
me calling upon me to beware Of the stone walls
not to risk her Majesty's feet--that these
stone walls were not to be trusted, and saying,
when you were going to the Baltic, you were
generally accused Of want Of discretion; but
now you have proved yourself a consummate
ommander-in-chief.""


""After that, came the most insulting and
degrading letters ever addressed to an officer
and ! mention this particularly, and hope il
will go throughout the world, and that Sir
James Graham will be prevented from ever
sitting again in the administration as First
Lord Of the Admiralty. state it to the public,
and wish it to be known, that, had followed
the advice Of Sir James Graham, should
most inevitably have left the feet behind me in
the Baltic. ! viii prove it before the world;
and if Sir James Graham has one single bit Of
honor in him, he will never take his seat at the
admiralty until this matter is cleared up; and
have no right ever to be employed again, and
! ought to be scratched off the navy list, if
am not telling the truth. Cheers. / am
taking the first opportunity, and perhaps the
only one may have, of making this statement
publicly, as now do; and am perfectly ready
70 answer for my conduct before the House OF
Commons whenever they choose to call upon
me to do so.n


The Lord Mayor next proposed ""the army""
associating with the toast the names Of Major





camp, Captain Maxsee.


The toast was drunk in the most enthusias.
tic manner, with three times three, and with
loud and long-continued cheering.


The Earl of Cardigan replied briefly and
cautiously. He thus disposed Of his exploits
in the Crimea:


Immediately after landing in the Crimea
the person who has now the honor of address
ing you was employed with q strong BODY OF
cavalry, artillery, and infantry, in endeavorinp
to cut off some Russian cavalry supposed to be
to Simpheropol. / am sorry to say
did not succeed, for / never could find the
Russians. Laughter. A few days afterwards
came that glorious affair, the battle Of the
Alma. And here ! must say that nothing, &C.
cording to my humble Judgment could be SO
perfect as the preparations which were made
by great army for that attack. There was to
be seen the advantage of the preparation that
had been made for the attack.


""The columns Of our infantry, which had
previously march in perfect order, instantly de.
ployed into three lines and advanced down the
hill, crossing the river, and ascending the or.
posite side, marched straight into the batteries

The Times.",,"Now that the summer business is being brought
to close, and every thing shaping itself for the
coming winter, one naturally remarks the very de-
cided improvement in the times, as compared with
the corresponding season of last year. An excel
lent summers work has been done by the miners
and they have been enabled to pay their scores
with the merchants and they in turn are in good
standing with the wholesale dealers below, thus
being able to conduct a lively fall trade with good
and complete stocks at low figures. The traders
and moneyed companies in the more remote portions
of the mines, anticipating early rains and bad
roads, have already begun to fill in with their win
ter stocks. Traders here are generally doing a
lively business between the cities and the mines
and at the same time steadily accumulating their
winter supplies, though evidently in no special
haste about it-probably looking for still lower
figures below. Lumber has been abundant and
cheap throughout the summer, and has been very
readily sold, both for fuming and building. The
miners have, many of them taken fancy for
comfortable cabins, and have accordingly been to
the necessary expense Of time and money, and are
very snugly rugged for the rains The river dig
gings continue to yield richly and will probably be
worked for some weeks to come, There has no
doubt been more gold taken from the river beds
this summer, than during any previous one. The
lightness of last winters rains, and the heavy
draughts made on the rivers for the supply of new
ditches together with the unusual length and dry
ness of the summer season, have combined to give
the miners unprecedentedy good show at the
river beds Then, river fuming is better under
stood than formerly, and lumber is cheaper, and
the river beds have suffered. The mines in this
vicinity are so abundanty supplied by the bitches,
as to afford miners hereabouts certainty for
something more than wages, in the dryest times
and we know of several men who are making from
seven dollars to an ounce per day Now and then
you may hear man complain that times are hard,
but we've heard it frequently remarked, and there's
no mistaking the signs Of the times-that this has
been the best and most prosperous year since 81
The reports of steamship companies and hired
newspapers have begun to be understood in the
Atlantic States, and consequently fail to affect the
passenger lists and shipments of merchandise, and
hence in the natural course of events California
attracts to her placers and her markets what o.
labor and of wares the time requires. If these
are hard times, them in the poetic language ol

account Of an afray at Upper Calaveritas, on Sat
urday week. In the morning man named Jesse
Miller accompanied by two OR three others, parad-
ed town, declaring that some body was to be killed.
A young man named Bright, who had been a wit
ness against Brown and Owens, was shortly after
wards met by this party, who used very abusive
and insulting epithets, and pulled him table
or bench. Paul Bright, hearing of this, went to
town to protect his brother, and on coming up
heard Miller call him a son Of a. Paul told
Miller that he could not allow such language to be
used towards his brother, whereupon Miller, bow
ing to Paul. replied, that he (P.) ""was also one,""
and attempted to draw his pistol Paul also drew
his, and being little quicker than the other, shot
Miller through the body Miller then fred the
ball passing through the raised arm Of Bright and
entering the neck, causing him to turn completely
around Miller meanwhile fred a second time
and wounded him in the back part Of the head
Bright then staggered back and fell to the ground
Miller again cooked his pistol, but did not fire

 Canal",,"The war ln Indiana seems to be approaching a crisis. On the oth inst Gov. Wright issued a proclamation to the people of Indiana setting forth the outrages done on the Wabesh and Erie canal in Clay county, by a combination known as '' Black Boys"" from the fact that they black their faces when proceeding to acts of mob violence The Governor thus enume- rates the outrages:

 l. Destruction of Bicrh Creek Reservoir, June p, 1854.

 ?. Attempting to destroy wasteway of same, July $, 1854.

 3. Attempt to burn Eel River Dam, August, 1854

 4. Destruction of Birch Creek Reservoir, May 10, 1855.

 ,. Warning of men sent to repair the same, May 31, 1855.

 6. Partial destruction of Aqueduct over Birch Creek, May 3l, 1855.

 :. Mobbing, lynching and tearing down the house of citizen, May 24, 1855.

 8. Burning of shanties, destruction of pro- perty and turning the inmates out of doors near the Reservoir June 2, 1855.

 We extract from his proclamation as fol- lows:

 ""This catalogue of outrages is sufficiently aggravated to call for the most decided and en- tIEcLlC IlcdSuTcS Ol COTreCIiCu.

 ""Tho work recently destroyed is now being repaired under the protection of a force ordered by this department, and therefore call upon all good citizens of Clay county and elsewhere, and all officers holding any relation to the go- vernment, to aid in securing the public peace, the security of the public property, and in bringing to punishment the persons who have so recently set at defiance the authority of tho laws and the rights of the citizen. This de- partment, vested by the constitution with the power to see that the laws are executed, to sup press instruction, is firmly resolved to bring the whole military force of the State if neces- sary to put down these lawless proceedings and to secure the quiet reign of the law. It is far better that millions should be expended, and even lives sacrificed, than that lawless band of men or private individuals should usurp the authority of law and rule day or an hour in madness in our happy State.'

 The Indianapolis Journal gives the follow ing important information.

 ""1n private letter of instructions to his (Gov. Wright's) Aids, Gen. Dodd and Col Ness, to whom are ntrusted the duty of supporting the civil authorities in protecting the reservoir in canal, the governor says they are to em- ploy not exceeding forty men, unless 1t should be manifest that such force would be inade- quate, and then they are to increase their force as the exigency demands. He further says if they find the courts of Clay county determin- ed to aid the rioters or unwilling to act against them the fact must be reported to the execu- tive and he will declare Clay county in state cf ahsurectio'a-for the time being annihilate it's civil existence, and extend the jurisdiction of the courts of neighboring counties over it, From this it will be seen that the Governor is determined to put the rioters down, and if they are wise they will initiate Capt. Scott's coon, and come down without compulsion.""

 The Journal says that there is very serious danger that the citizens of the neighborhood injured by these canal outrages will be excited by renewal of them to such degree as to take the law into their own hands and punish mob outrages by mob vengance, as there arc enough of men interested in the preservation of the canal to crush the whole nest of Clay county outlaws at once. sr"

brick on the N. Y. Tribune, and the
presumption is that that paper win close
up as soon as the article shall be spread
before the public. We make the follow
ing pointed extracts =


We can tell the impertinent scoundrels
of the Tribune, that they may exhaust
an ocean of ink, their Emigrant Aid So
cieties spend their millions and billions,
their Representatives in Congress, spout
their heretical theories till doomsday, and
his ExcelIency Franklin Pierce appoint

And though our fair Territory may be
refused admittanee into the Union as a
slaveholdiug State, by the political DEM
agogues of the North, we care as little
for their decision, as for the continued
and futile attacks which have been made
upon our rights, by the indecisive Cabi-
net who now administer the affairs of our
nation. For we confidently hope that
the last national Congress may meet in
Washington on the first Monday in De-
cember next; and we prophecy, with
the firm conviction that time will verify
our words, that never again will the
southern States of the Republic, suffer
dictation from set of negro-slealers and
rascals, who stand pledged to war upon
their rights until liberation ceases to. be
a virtue.


We ask the slaveholding community,
what object they had in view, when as
free, independent, and sovereign States,
they consented to band themselves to-
gether under the Federal Constitution !?


Now if this Federal compact should at
any time prove insufficient for protection,
and a portion of the States should seek
for their own aggrandizement, to force
or impose measures upon the remainder,
in direct opposition to their interests and
wishes what interest have those whose
rights are trampled on, in the further OBJ
servance of compact which daily less
ems their strength, and serves to strip
them of their few remaining means of
defence?


For what are laws enacted, if not for
the protection of person and property
This same constitution recognizes our
slaves as property, and if it is to be OBJ
served by us, must protect the rights of
the STAKEHOLDER, in whatever portion of
the Union he may be. But when an in
dividual State, such as Massachusetts or
Ohio, sees fit to annul her Federal obi
CATION, and refuses to respect the rights
of our citizens, are not the States whose
rights are jeopardized thereby, freed from
their compact as clearly as if it were
mere civil contract between individuals ?


If this be true-and we scarcely think
it can be denied even by the most preju-
diced-then has the South had sufficient
cause to secede during every twelve
months, for the past ten years. Her in
alienable right to do so, Individually or
collectively, we do not intend to argue,
for we consider 1t as clear mathematical
axiom, which none but fools and fanatics
will attempt to dispute. If the southern
States have it not, what claim have they
to their proud and boasted right Of inde-
pendence and sovereignty ?


If it be not guaranteed by the Consti-
tuition, then they possess it by the right
of revolution, and let ""the right make
the might"" be their motto."

SHASTA, Jan. 81, 1855.


Mr. Brigham, of Adams & Co.'S Express, has
just shown US letter from Red Bluffs commu-
nicating the fact that man lname unknown)
was lynched in that place on yesterday (Tues-
day. 1t tappears that he had been caught with
number of mules, belonging to MIR. Cecil,
which he had stolen from the corral of Mr..
Connell
We are informed that he was tried by jury
of twelve men, who deemed the evidence of his
crime worthy of death. and accordingly SEN
fenced him to be hung. A portion of the citi-
Of Red Bluffs then hung him to the.
limb of tree until life was extinct.-Courier-
Extra.


We have since been informed that the crimi-
the State Prison from this county several years
since, and that his term Of imprisonment had
expired very recently.
Below will be found the full particulars Of this
unfortunate affair-unfortunate for the reputa-
ion of the county:


RED BLUFFS, Jan. 81, 1856


MEssRs. DosH & SKILLMAN The dull mo-
notony which has usually characterized our
town. was, yesterday, broken by the enacting
of scene which, admitting it to be just,
is fearful to think of. The mania for mob law,
which appears to prevail among the people
throughout the entire country, appears also to
have seized upon the citizens of this place
Perhaps the recent examples in other parts OF
the State have had some influence the con-
duct of our people. However. be that as it may.
yesterday about o'clock in the afternoon, some.
of fhe citizens of this place condemned and ex-
eculed man for mule stealing, "" no refused to
give his name. The circumstances connected
with the matter are as follows, so far as have
been made acquainted with them: The man
was found In possession OF mule which had
been stolen from MIR. Connell, of Colusa county,
having been followed by Mr.. Connell and Con-
stable Potter as far as Horsetown. where he was
arrested and brought back as far this place,
where they stopped for the night. On the fol-
lowing morning yesterday some OF the ciIZeus
OF this place met, and appointed committee OF
twelve to examine into the matter and report
to The meeting. The committee took the evil
dence of Mr.. Connel and some others, after



ing, the purport of which was. that the eridence
presented before the committee sufficient
to convict the prisoner of mule Stealing and
that there was circumstantial evidence which
tended TO show that he was an old offender.
The meeting then took vote to decide whether
they should deal with him according TO Lynch
Law. or permit him to be taken to Colusa county
and be tried by the authorities. The majority
being in favor of Lynch Law the prisoner was
taken TO an oak tree on the west side Of town,
where persons endeavored to get him to make a
confession, for the purpose of learning whether
he had any accomplices; bu: he refused to dis
close anything. He told them if they would
shoot him he would give his name, but If he was
to be hung he did not want his relatives to
know it. They refused his request to be shot,
when he bound the rope put around his
neck, and the cart driven from under him. The
body not taken down for two three
hours. l have since learned he was from Rome
in New York. He was about twenty-five or
twenty-six years OF age, and of genteel appear
ance.


How far men are justified in violating the
laws of their conntry. by taking the life OF fel
low man who has transgressed the same code of
laws. depends very much the peculiar cir
cumstances of each particular And how
far the men who were engaged in this affair
were justified is not for me to say, but must be
left to the judgment of the community.


party OF men from the east side of the river,
opposite this place, went in search of some In
dians few days ago who had been stealing
stock from Dyes Ranch. They found the lndi-
ans about tw enty-fve miles from the Valley, TO-
wards the head of Antelope Greek, where they
had fe eht with them, in which VIM. Ransom
was severely wounded. having received two arr
row wounds. 1t is thought he will recover
Several Indians were killed.

Jan. q, 1855. {


The news BY the Cortes is Of highly
interesting and exciting character. In
the New York Times, Of Dec. 9th, we
find letter from Kossuth to the editor
Of the London Times, defending the char
acter Of the Hungarian nation, and dis
proving the charge made against them by
the Anglo Partisan correspondent ofthat
paper 1t appears that the Hungarian
people during the Polish insurrection of
1880, did not remain quiescent spectator
Of the struggle, but rendered all the assist.
ance in their power. We do not care to
see the liberties of Europe forever extin-
guished under despotic system, composed
by an interlinking of all the European SOW
ereignties. France and England control
ing and at peace with Russia, are the
most dangerous enemies Of the United
States. Commercially speaking, the in
terests of California in all future time. de-
pend largely upon the friendship and in
terest of the Russian Emperor. Of this
interest, the Sitka Ice Company, of this
city, is at present a leading representative.
San Francisco is to be the grand depot
of the Russian Pacific trade. Ex-Col-
lector Sanders, who went from here to St.
Petersburg last year, and has since re-
turned, was treated with more favor by
the Emperor than any Russian subject
The agent of q company, he was received
like an Ambassador. A free and steady
intercourse with Russia. will insure sup
ply of cheap food, and many other neces-
saries for California. The great want of
this State is foreign commerce. At
peace with Russia, we shall soon export
largely to the Amoor river, where there
is large opening for trade and barter
We can supply the Eastern Empire of the
Gar, with the precious metals and all the
commodities of life. Russia does not fear
our policy of annexation. We need not
be intimidated on that head by the predic-
tions Of Kossuth.


The injury received at Sacramento some
days since, by Senator Mahony, kind
hearted and worthy gentleman, has occa-
stoned great deal of criticism against the
brutal custom of drawing knives and firing
pistols in a crowd. If men are so regard
less Of the lives Of others, why should we
be so very careful of theirs? Duelling is
bad enough; let man who fires pistol
in crowd, belong either to the hospital
or the gallows.


It is rumored that in case of the cleo
tion of Mr.. Broderick or of any other rep
resentative of the 'pure"" democracy, the
Alta California newspaper, now in the
hands of the Sheriff, will be bought at
auction, for the use Of the party.


Hon. w. B. Farwell, of the Assembly,
who introduced the famous ""Wagon Road
Bill"" few days since, is the lessee of the
Monterey Granite quarries. These quar-
ries are the property Of DR.. Randall, Of
this city, proprietor whose landed inter-
ests in various parts of California, cover
seventy square leagues of territory, and has
an ocean water front of more than 36
miles. Randall would be the richest pro-
prietor in the world, if the emigration to
California were promoted as it should be
by good roads across the continent and
through the State.


Lynch Law continues to prevailin every
part of California, and with excellent rea-
sons to sustain it. You will see in your
exchanges report of the hanging Of two
murderers in Los Angeles. Also in the
Sonora Herald, a full description of the
proceedings in the case Of Grifiths, who
killed Mr.. Heslep, the Treasurer of Tuol-

From what has transpired since the
StringfeIIow mobs took possession of the
polls in Kansas, all mustagree that Amer
lean freedom of speech and of the press
has been sing,llarly exemplified there,
and particularly by the Legislature of
that Territory, which has just enacted 3
law, containing, among other provisions,
the following -


sEc. 19. Ifany free persons, By speak
ing or by writing, assert or maintains that
persons have not the right to hold slaves
in the Territory, or shall introduce into
Kansas, print. publish, write. circulate,
or cause to be introduced into the Terri
tory, written, printed, published, or cir
cr.lated in this Territory, any book, pa
per, magazine, pamphlet. orcircular, con-
tainins any denial of the right of persons
to hold slaves in this Territory. such per-
son shall be deemed guilty of felony, and
punished by imprisonment at hard labor
for term not less than two years.


These Kansas sovereigns even if they
believe slavery to be right, are evidently
disbelieyers in Jeferson's maxim. that
error of opinion may safely be tolerated
where reason is left free to combat it. IL
is not SO much, however, the opinions
they aim al, as the persons who hold them,
and who will cast votes at the elections.
The above section is buta single one TAX
EN- from budget Of the most extraordi-
nary enactments ever peIpetrated in this
Republic. Il would require an army OF
ten thousand men to enforce any one of
the number in Kansas, and the members
of the Legislature were aware Of the


fact before they enacted theai. Their
purpose was to breed sH open war. in
. which nlobs from Missouri might have
an excuse for burning towns and lynch

was originated by the Committee OF Confer

Gals, calling themselves the Kansas Legis-
lature. At the same time expressing his
appreciation of the plan, and submitting
his reasons as follows:


He thinks that should the scheme pro-
posed be consumated, then, at least halt of
the so called Legislature of Kansas might
become citizens of the Territory, for which
they are now pretending to legislate. And
again-to use celebrated nicism-that
Missouri ""would gain loss,"" for, says the
Tribune, ""there does not exist this side of
Botany Bay, Territory of the same size,
which endures greater number of law
less ruffians on its SOIL""


In regard to this last declaration, we
differ widely from the editor, and venture
to assert, that the sanctum of the Tribune
contains set of Enprincipled rascals, whose
daring and barefaced villainy is unequal
ed by the inhabitants of any land, country
or nation.


But as TO the proposed annexation of
Platte county, we think it ''strange, pass
ing strange"" that measure of such vast
importance to the interests of our Terrific
ry, should be canvassed by the abolition
journals of New York, when such an
idea had never presented itself. to either
the citizens of Kansas or Platte and
consequently must consider it an effort on
the part of designing enemies abroad, to
constitute that fertile, wealthy, populous
and intelligent county, bone of contention
between Kansas and Missouri, In order
to sever the bonds of sympathy, friendship
and interest, now existing between them.


Well do they know the consequences
which would necessarily follow such re-
suit. Kansas, deprived of the aid hither-
to received from her southern allies, would
prove an easy prey to these rapacious
thieves of the North. Hhowever the North
fatter themselves that this can ever be
done, we most humbly beg leave to unde-
cieve them. We can tell the impertinent
scoundrels of the Tribune, that they may
exhaust an ocean of ink, their Emgrant
Aid Societies, spend their millions and
billions, their representatives in Congress,
spout their heretical theories till doomsday,
and his Excellency Franklin Pierce, ap-
point Abolitionist alter Freesoiler as our
Governor: yet will we continue to tar
and feather, drown lynch and hang, eve-
ry white-liyered aholitionist, who dares to
pollute our soil.


And though our fair territory may be
refused admittance into the Union as a
slave holding State by the political dema-
goues of the North, we care as little for
their decision, as for the continued and
futile attacks which have been made upon
our rights, by the indecisive cabinet who
now administer the affairs of our nation.
For we confidently hope that the last ma
tioaat Congress may meet in Washington
on the first Monday in December next
and we prophecy with the firm conviction
that time will verify our words, that nev-
er again will the southern States of the
Republic, suffer dictation from set of ne.
gro stealers and rascals, who stand pledg-
ed to war upon their rights until liberation
ceases to be virtue.


We ask the slave holding community
what object they had in view, when, as
free, Independent and soreresgn States, they
consented to band themselves together un.

another near Kanaka Peak, was admit
ted to ''straw"" bail in the sum Of Sl5-
100. His victim, James Hunt, has since
died. The -Coroner's inquest returned
the following verdict;


1--WE, the undersigned jurors, agree
that James Hunt, came to his death from
a wound inflicted by knife in the hands
of Hope Hoagland.''


Hoagland waived an examination, and
asked to be admitted to bail, course
which was accodcd to by the prosecuting
Attorney, although witnesses for the
prosecution were in Attendance
course, which, if it is sustained by law,


we should be pleased to have the Prose


cutting Attorney, Mr.. kliene, Or the
Justice, Mr. Stafford, point it out We
do not member of seeing such course
laid down in the Statute, and should
Ike to have these legal gentlemen point
out their authority, or stand arraigned
before the pullic as men who have dis
graced their o2ic:al positions outraged
justice, and ended bloody tragedy with
4 legal ia cc. Public opinion by talking
Of Lynch law, compelled these over
generous officials, to retain Hoagland in
Jail, until it was reported that the
wound d man would probably recover,
when be was released ON bail, and i'm
medintcly left. Two or three days after
II""ag and's release, Hunt died.


From the first there was observable a
studied effort on the part of many to
create an impression in the public mind,
that IIoagland was iustfa ble--belonged
to good and respectable famiIy-thai
Han; Lad SANDER d his sister. The
charge Of slender was denied by the
dying man, and it was proved before the
Coroner 5 Jury tina! he had not used the
language imputed to him. Hunt stated
that he was bas'ly murdered, and his
statement is corroborated by those who
witnessed it, and who were in attend
ance at the examination, but were not
permitted to testify They would have
testified further--that HoagIand stated
that he meant to kill Hunt All this
was publicly talked over before he was
admitted to bail, and yet an examina-
was waived, and the murderer TUNED
loo-e upon community. What induced
the Prosecuting Attorney and Justice to
pursue snch course 1t could not be
ignorance, for every Jnstice who has
opened the Statutes knows that the law
in such cases SAYS the Justice ""ShaU
proceed to examine"" Sc 1t could not
be ignorance on the part Of the Prose-
cutting Attorney, for he has been ad
mitted to practice in our courts. Our
own opinion is that this extraordinary
proceeding is one ofthe practical results
of American Hindooism-ihatit it is rank
Thuggery Hoagland was President of
a Wigwam in Mountain Spring township,
and is the person who publicly drew the
K. n. ritual on member who wished
to portion of the Democratic ticket,
and read him he oath he had taken to
prefer members of that order. The
Prosecuting Attorney and Justice were
members of the same great American
order, bound by the same extra judicial
oaths, and SO distinguished Il member OF
the order as Mr. lloagland, must not be
answerable to law, which, we suppose,
has been made for bloody foreigners and
men who have not joined the Hindoo-
American institution. If this opinion is
incorrect, and these judicial officers
were not governed by their foul political
oaths, then they are guilty of gross and
unpardonable ignorance of the law. If
their action was governed by neither of
these reasons, they are still guilty of
malfeasance, and outraged justice and
an injured community demand their
removal from positions which they have
disgraced Their acts have made JUS
.ice mockery, and has done more to


lead the community TO calmly conten-
plate the fearful code Of Judge Lynch,
than any act Of Judicial authorities in
California

R@g@ 1t is a painful fact that very many",,"B8g@ 1t is painful fact that very many
of the public prints of this State at the pres
ent time, contain accounts from day to day
Of an extraordinary number Of premature
deaths, large amount of which are out-and-
out murders. We find chronicled alone IN
the State Tribune Of Saturday last, the de-
tails of no less than twelve deaths; seven Of
which were accidental, and the remaining
five occasioned bymob law and at the hands
of the murderer-all Of which transpired
in the short space Of five days, This num-
ber-aside from those caused by the relent-
less savage8 on our northern frOntiers-does
not perhaps comprise more than the aver
age which take place every week. at least
one-half of this number are occasioned at
the hands Of our fellow-man. At this ratio
then, three hundred and twenty-four souls
in this State, are annually launched into
eternity in violation Of the laws of Divine
Providence Not less than one hundred
and fifty Of this latter number are cold
blooded murders, and the perpetrators there
of should-were they to receive their just
deserts-sufer the extreme penalty of the
law. But alas, how few do. To what an
alarming extent then is crime carried on in
this country. There is not another State in
the. Union in which half the number Of hu-
man lives are thus fendishly sacrificed
What is and has been the cause Of all this
astounding amount Of crime? We fear a
great deal of it is attributable to those to
whom the administration of our laws are
entrusted. Not more than one murderer
out of every three that has heretofore been
arranged before our District Courts has
been convicted, and a large number Of those
have either been set scOt-free by our Exec
utive or had their punishmentS commuted
to one, two or three years service in the
State Prison. In view Of these eyiden-
ces then, can we justly censure our fellow
citizens in different parts Of the State for
occasionally executing summary punishment
in aggravated cases? We do not uphold
mob law nor think it right. Far from it.
It is dangerous element and should be
suppressed if possible. But until our laws
are more ehectually carried out, we may
expect to hear from time to time of sessions
of Judge Lynch's awful court. And furth-
ermore, if our laws are not hereafter as rig
idly enforced as they should be, instead of
a diminution there will be an increase Of
crime. tits therefore highly important that
our officers, from the least to the greatest,
should faithfully discharge their respective
duties."

The Herald has never yet advocated
Lynch Law, and we defy the gimblet eye,
attle-brained editors of the Tribune to
bring forward any language of ours that
can be construed as advocacy of Lynch
Law. We deprecate Lynch Law as much
as any living man, and we cannot see upon
what justifable ground such a charge is
brought up against US. We were, and
are still, in favor of expelling Philips
from the Territory; but we do not say
that he should be treated to dose Of
Judge Lynch. Does it make US an advo-
catssof Lynch Law to approve of the ex-
pulsion of perjured svillian who is ac-

accessory to the late murder of Clark.
We only favor movement that is endorsed

are consoled with the conviction g that
there is a good time coming."

cited; curses loud and deep were uttered
against judge who had the audacity not
to be forsworn, and active preparations
were made to present him as an embodied
appeal from his own court to the supreme
tribunal of Judge Lynch. The case closed;
JOY reigned in the heart of every patriot
who had expectations; and exultation sat
on the brow OF the leaders who had achiev.
ed the great victory. The triumph of tov.
shops over cotton presses was complete.


Meanwhile Judge Robertson had arranp-
ed his documents, placed his books in q
safe place, and was preparing to 90 quietly
home, when Mr.. Hufty and several of the
Deputy sherilfs rushed in and entreated
him to remain where he was, as he would
be shot If he left the court room, even for
Q moment. A conversation took place
between the two parties, somewhat to this
effect:


Judge Robertson.-""I am conscious of
having done no wrong or rather of having
done my duty impartially and without
prejudice; why therefore, should | fear any
violence from my fellow citizens?""


sN'' AAuJey'- huI tUu Will Dc kIlIcu
the crowd is furious; do not trust yourself
amongst them; they will strike you down
without scruplc.""


Judge Robrtson.- But I cannot remain
here all night; | am weary and must 90
home. Besides will not be intimidated
hy any mob, let it howl as it will.'


Mr.. Hutly.-"" BE patient, and We will
form guard; we will escort you home""


At this stage Of the proceedings, two Of
he jury which had tried the case arrived
and confirmed the horrible tidings Of Mr..
Fluffy and the Deputy Sheriffs the mob
wanted Q victim, and had selected Judge
Robertson; he should not stir without an
escort; no law no dignity, no police, Tex
ccpt Hufty &i Co.. could protect him. :
The Judge is not easily scared; hcis an old
Monterey man, the companion and historian
Of the Bloody First Tcnnesseeans,n and
cannot be pushed from his'purpose by open
intimidation or singular friendship. He
therefore resolved to 90 his ways.


The body guard was formed. Whether
IT was necessary or not, we cannot say
Perhaps it was part of the bluffing game
for which the city has become notorious
perhaps it was literally true. Atall events
the Judge was passed olf-a cab obtained
the driver received his orders, and he ar
rived safely athomo, TO mediate on the
difference between being Judge and q
prisoner in his own court."

with the deepest concern of the events that have
transpircd, and the passions that bear sway-pre-
meditated as they have been, by a large and pow
erful secret association. am happy to know that
the citizens of Parkville and vicinity took no part
in it; and why my life and property should be
destroyed by any portion of this community, can
not tell the charge of abOltionst is false; have
never harbored thought nor medtated an action
detrimental to the honor, the interests or nstitu-
| tons of Missouri; but have labored uncea sngly
to promote her prosperity. 1t is true have not
believed the honor and interests of Missouri to be
in that course of policy marked out by some po-
liticians-duty has compelled me to cross their





| bittcrest persecution.


Our paper can be read-it will speak for itself.
1t does not claim perfeclion-the leading objects
have been to promote the principles of temper
ance, morality Il: d virtue; to take conservative
political stand, anal by moIerating the extremes,
AMI by softening sectional asperities, to promote
the general good of the country and the perpetuty
of the American Union.

dcnces OF the fact; where individual enterprise
gathered around the gallant Houston, and by in
credible hardship and almost superhuman exer-

acheved-now one of the brightest stars in the
constellation of States; and refer to my fellow
citizens to attest the fact, that, while have resi-
ded in Missouri, l have labored increasingly to
promote her interests.


love the North, too; never, while life lasts,
shall forget the green hills of Vermont, where
rests the grave of my mother, nor the deeds of the
men OF '16; nor the virtues and energies of the
men who have made those States a beacon light,
the wonder and admiration of the world; and /
shall ever look upon their glory rs the common

would rather prefer death at my own home,
amid the flowers and trees planted and consecra-
ted 10y affection, and upon the soil of the country
l have toiled to build up. Our press has been
thrown into the Missouri River-I may be buried
there too-an humble individual is in the power of

If the time has arrived when this Union must

The Lynchburgh Republican is en-
couraged by the result of the Kansas cleo

ing strain:


""There is a degree of vitality and pow
er in the institution of slavery with which
it is not credited by its ablest defenders.
The more the subject is discussed. the
stronger hold it obtains in public favor
Even within our time there has been
great change in public sentiment upon
this question of slavery. 1t was wont in
times gone by to have only apologists,.
who looked upon it as an evil, but saw me-
way to get rid of it. Now. it is looked
upon by many of the ablest and most in
fuential of our statesmen as an unmitiga-
ted blessing-as the great conservative
principle that is to preserve us, entirely
untouched by the flood of Fourierism,
Greelyism, Spirit Rappings, Bloomerism,
and the thousand and one other plaques
that are sweeping over the northern
States, bidding fair to blot out all true
religion and veneration for God""


The more the subject is discussed,
the stronger hold it obtains in public ia
vor."" That being the case, we hope
the Virginians will give over their habit
of lynchiug every traveller, through that
American Barbary, who choose to hint the
slightest objection to the ""peculiar insti-
tuition"" Surely system so full of vi
tality and strength need not be so care
fully guarded; as if the slightest breath
of the wind of heaven endangered Its
speedy dissolution. It is but poor re-
turn for the strength which free discus
sion gives to the system. to tar and feath-

what evils the passions of an impulsive
people. reused to their highest pitch in
an exciting contest, might hurl around
his devoted head. No doubt in his mid
night dreams his Excellency saw his
honor, Judge Lynch, with his grave
judicial aspect, sitting at the foot of his
bed, remarking with all the politeness of
Richelieu to Baradas, that the Court had
taken his case under consideration, and
that they did not believe ""that the air of

composure ''paradisical garden, marked

HILL's FERRY, Oct 20, 1865.


Our usually quiet neighborhood has been
the scene of considerable excitement, during
the present week, which terminated last
evening, in the summary suspension-on a
limb-of four individuals, every way merito-
rious Of that exalted position.


On last Tuesday evening information was
brought to this place by the indefatigable Bill
Lard who had that day encountered four
men, on the plains, near the Agun Salala,
who had in their possession about one hun
dred head of cattle, branded, respectively,
with the irons of Messrs. Stone, Stevenson,
Gould, Wilson and Montgomery which he
believed to have been stolen. Notice was
at once given to as many of the parties in
terested as was convenient to do at the time,
who at once pronounced the cattle stolen.
Seven resoute men promptly armed and
equipped themselves and started in pursuit
They returned to this place on Thursday
evening, with the thieves in custody, three
of whom were Mexicans, Francisco Sanchey,
Francisco Tapia, and Jesus Pine, the fourth
German, James G. Lackner. The Mexi-
cans were captured near the mouth of Corral
nj naLy of faI
some miles up the Hollow, where the whole
party had been quietly enjoying breakfast.


The prisoners were strictly cared for until
yesterday afternoon, when a complete in
vestigation of their conduct was had, and
their guilt established beyond all possibility
of doubt. Lackner, however, made a clean
breast, by confessing the part he had taken
in driving off the cattle, and pronounced his
companions equally guilty with himself. He
also gave very interesting account of a
half dozen or more birds of a like fashion
with himself, together with their names,
residences and other particulars, that will
probably lead to their arrest; but concerning
this matter will, at present, withhold fur
ther particulars. Altogether, he betrayed
such knowledge of the outlaws of the coun-
try, and familiarity with their acts, that it
placed his eligibility to the ropes end be-
yond the reach of doubt.


They were all hung in row, at sunset,
about mile above this place. Nothing
transpired uncommon to such transactions


The Mexicans were stubborn, cool and col
lected to the last, making no confession, nor
manifesting any signs of penitence, beyond
asking those around to pardon them"" and
regretting that they must die without the
absolving aid of a Padre. Lackner had
several times through the day, displayed
great fear of death; but during the few
minutes preceding the execution, seemed re-
signed to his fate, admitting that he deserved
it, hard as it was.


| hope may not be deemed an advocate
or supporter Of lynch law, if | state that the
discovery of the body of murdered man, a
few weeks since in one of the sloughs in this
vicinity, the recent barbarous and revolving
murder of Anderson Loving and the hume
rous depredations that have lately been com
mitted upon the stock in the neighborhood,
had well prepared the minds of the people
for the extremity just related, and does much
to pallate their devotion from the prescribed
laws Of the land.


The execution was attended and sanctioned
by almost the entire community, all agreeing
that the exi gencies of the times plainly indi-
Gated that their lives and property could only
be protected by ridding the country of these
banded outlaws, whenever guilt can be firmly
fixed upon them.


Lackner left wife and four children, who
reside on the Pulpas Ranch His wifa ;s

Much complaint has lately been made by ,he
Mexican population in our midst, in reference 70
the action of certain parties who claim to be
invested with authority as members of Com.
mittees of Vigilance. We confess we have given
the subject too little attention, satisfied as VA
are that wrong has been inflicted upon innocent
persons in the name of that sort Of justice which
| is appeased by violence. The undisguised FEEL
| ing which prevails to great extent among oar
mining population against all foreigners does not
stop to consider that the Mexican people held
rights and interest here long before cur laws were
| substituted for theirs; and although we boast Of
the freedom we brought to the Pacific shores the
| occupants we found here often have just cause
! TO complain Of our encroachments end our in.
| tolerance. The genuine American feeling should
| pride itself On its liberality and magnanimity,
instead of exercising disposition to override awe.
and crush the weak. The rights Of the humblest,
as well as the greatest, should be held alike Sa-
cred. That there are bad Mexicans, their own
people know, and frankly confess, yet let them
be held amenable Ia the law. Ii is not Of the
law, but of violence, the Mexicans complain
and who in any community, whose boast is tho
supremacy of civil law, does not alike deprecate
violence We are not Of those who recognize

and there are instances of fragrant outrage where
popular opinion will support it; yet the prece,

checked is dangerous to liberty, and disastrous
to the peace Of society.


In the La Cromica, of the 30th ult., we find
petition of our Mexican citizens addressed to
the Deputy Mexican Consul at San Francisco,
on this subject. Mr.. Bolton has referred the
matter to the Mexican Minister at Washington

inals should be pardoned. We do not assert that
they are not guilty of crime All we require is
law and order; and we believe We have perfect
right to demand that our citizens be delivered to
the proper authorities, that their cause may bc
publicly judged according to the laws. If in this
country we are never to have any guarantee to
life or property; if we are not to live beneath
the protection of the authorities and the laws,
it would be better that they fix Gpon some time
for our entire expulsion and the world will then
know which is the guarantee that the foreigner
has in this country, aud the manner in which trea-
ties made with friendly foreign nations are COM

I"" In the commerce, mining, agriculture and
arts are daily seen by innumerabe number Of
Mexicans assisting although perhaps on small
scale, to develope the riches of this country;
but none are free Ono matter how well known

We learn from Mr.. Newman. Of Don
iphan, that Samuel Collins OF that place.
was killed this morning about sunrise. by
Pat. Laughlin. AS far as we have been
able to learn, the circumstances are as
follows:


Mr.. Laughlin, recently made an ex-
position of the midnight organization ex-
is,ing among the Abolitionists in the Ter
ritory, called the ""Grand EncanprIellt
and Regiments OF Ike Kansas Legion. -
Collins, Il seems was Colonel of one of the
Regiments in this order. and determined
to force h1r. Laughlin to retraetion, OF
Kill him. Ia accordance with this deter
animation, he and some TWELVE brother
Abolisionists proceeded Wednesday last to
seek out Mr.. Laughl:a, and dena nded an
unqualified retraction OF his recent confes-
sion, and upon Mr.. LIS refusing to make
any concession whatever, Collins immedi-
a,ely snapped his gun at him, (Lapghlin) }
aud then fred at him, but fortunately the





weapon was turned aside by spectator
Mr.. Laughiin then drew a revolver and
fred on has opponent, killing him instant
ly.


We regret to learn that Mr.. L., mas
dangerously hurt in the conflict by a knife
wound In the side. Weare also informed
that his friend Mr.. Lynch, memh er oil
tie pro-slavery party was wounded in the
head by the discharge OF gun.


Thus ii is, that the fight SO long talked
about has begun, and it is to be hoped that
this fearful, bu, righteous result, viii quell
the rising spirit of rebellion and treason
which has been rioting in onr midst.


We learn that Mr.. Lynch, who was en-
gagged in the fight. has been tried and ac-
quilted.

The bill amendatory of the act concern
ing railroad corporations has been under
discussion several times, and is not yet
disposed Of The objections to it appear
to be the mode prescribed ofassesslng and
recovering damages in eases where water

In this respect it assumes degree OF I'M
portance which is not apparent at first
glance. A large, wealthy and powerful
corporation running a railroad through
mining region might do incalculable in
jury to individuals or small companies
who might be unable or unwilling to incur
the expense ofprotracted litigation to pro-
cure redress or damages. Several vigilant
members are watching its course and it
will have to be amended before it can
pass the Assembly. 1t has already passed
the Senate.

 ton and Arrest.",,"ton and Arrest.

 | Last evening Sergant Hogan, of the chiefs office, arrived in town, having in custody Will liam kissane, who has obtained considerable notoriety in consequence of his connection with series of crimes perpetrated during the past five or six years. Since the forgery of check of S14, 900 on the Chemical Bank in this city, the paying teller of the bank, Mir Parsons, has been unceasing in his efforts to aid the police in ferretting out the forgers. It appears there were three old offenders engaged in the forgery, viz: William Kissane, John Findlay, and Ly- man Cole, all of whom are now confined in the Tombs and will probably be tried in the court of general sessions during the present term.

 Some months ago. Findlay and Cole were ar- rested and brought to this city, charged with the forgery, and have been imprisoned. Ks- sane received nearly every dollar that was paid by the bank teller to one of the confederates. As before stated, Kissanc was arrested in Cin- cnnat and while proceeding to New York, in custody of Marshal Ruffin, of Ohio, and officer Reed, of this city, he made his escape by leap- ing from the cars on the Erie railroad. near Hornelsville, while the trains was under rapid headway. dispute subsequently, arose be- tween the western marshal and officer Reed, in relation to the culpability of parties who permitted the escape to occur. The mystery is however, explained by the prisoner himself, in the following language:

 |"" l saw the cards as published by the two officers, and Ruffin's was untrue. Officer Reed was asleep, and Marshal Rufin conducted me to the water closet of the car. Iwent in, shut the door, and the window being open, jumped out and made for the woods.'

 We give the above statement uerbatlna, as it was made to officer Hogan by Kissane in his cell, and thus far it will be seen that officer Reed was entirely blameless It appears that Kssane travelled on foot to Rochester, where he found an old friend, and was secretly conveyed ro the house of an English farmer at Clarence Hollow, Erie county, New York. Atthis point Kissane made his headquarters, worked daily at farm inc, and finally venturcd to visit Buffalo in the guise of huckster, and sold several loads of produce at the public market. Atlength he sent MT. Sparrow (he farmoD to Buffalo, with a lot of $2O bills on the International Bank to get changed for smallnot The /"" $2Os"" were Sus- pected as counterfeits, and Sparrow was forth with placed in custody to answer.

 He, however, told plain story, and upon in- formation to the authorities that he had received the bills from man who was stopping at his house in the "" Hollow"" officers were disparch- ed to the premises, and to their surprise, found the fugitive who had long been looked for It was ascertained that Kissane had passed under the assumed name of Lynch at this place, and having made ""confident'' of Mr. Sparrow's wife, he placed in her possession $65OO, Gall in . $500 issues of the Chemical Bank, that were

 paid on the false check for safe keeping, but 7 became frightened and handed over the funds"

Party?",,"The Suffolk county democratic committee
of Massachusetts, have recently uttered ""An
appeal TO Democrats and Union men against
Northern Fusion and Sectionalism.'' 1t is,
as says the Boston Post, strong, well put,
noble paper, and will rank among the ablest
OF the productions of its author, Hon. BENJA-
SnN F. HAILErT. We ecopy an extract from
this Appeal but lis so good we hardly know
where to begin or where 10 stop. 1t should
be scattered broadcast over all New England :


And to what good end can this new fu-
sion party come Even if the whole people
of the north should consent to come down to
this one idea of resisting the admission of new
slave states, it would be simply contest for
an impossibility under the constitution. Its
basis is false, because il denies to the new
state thus attempted TO be restricted in its SOW
ereignty, equality with the old states. 1t is
impracticable, because if congress of north
ern abolitionists, with like executive, should
compel territory to exclude slavery from its
constitution, as condition precedent of ad-
mission into the Union, the people of the new
state could instantly change its constitution
and establish slavery, and there is no power
in the nation to Interfere Herewith.


There is nothing new in this one idea which
the fusion party now claim TO be paramount
The Hartford convention tried it and wrecked
the federal party. We went all over this an
ti-slayery dogma in the Wilmot proviso, and
beat them on it north and south. The nation
al idea of the people of this whole country will
always repose in its conservatism, upon the
only sound solution of the slavery question,
NoN-INTERFERENcE BY CONGRESS IN STATE
AND TERRITORY.


Hence the difference between the democrat
ic party of the whole Union, and the sectional
party of anti-slavery, rests on the fundamental
principle of the right of self-government inhe-
rent in the people of every legally organized
political community under the constitution !;
and thus this anti-slavery issue is an issue
made up outside of the constitution, and out
side of the Union-and this makes the sec
tiOnal quarrel between states. and the section
al quarrel about territories.


Formerly it was attempted to be applied to
Louisiana, Missouri, Florida, Arkansas, Tex
as. Just now it happens to be about Kansas
The abolition propagandsts of Massachusetts
began the contest by the Incorporation of aid
emigration societies, not so much to settle Kan
sas as to make Kansas an abolition state
The slavery propagandists Of Missouri got up
combinations TO invade the territory and make
it slave state Both are alike disre garding
the true principle of the Nebraska bill, which
leaves the final adjustment of the slavery ques-
iion there, as purely local issue, to the actu-
al and permanent settlers. There are wrong
headed men on both sides, and personal rights
are violated, but it is a local difficulty and not
a national concernment. The States or the
United States cannot take sides and interfere
any more than they could with the Lynch law
of California or the know-nothing mob at
Louisville. These local evils work out their
own cure, without a resort to civil war. a.na


Yet the anti-slavery men rail at the Presi-
dent for not sending army to Kansas TO dis
solve the legislature and hang the Missouri
iuterlopers! They know better. They know
that the President is not despot, and has no
power to invade state or territory with stand
ing army. But they say he called but the
military to enforce the fugitive law in Boston.
So did Washington in the whisky rebellion in
Pennsylvania. ~


The President is sworn to exclude the laws
of the Union and when process under law
of the United States is resisted, his duty in.
terposes the necessary military force in aid Of
ihe civil process. But no legal process under
law of the United States is resisted in Kan
sss. No marshal or governor or legislature
has called for an armed posse TO enforce law,
or the militia to repel foreign invasion or sup"

ITAN DISTRICT.",,"


""lt is reported that the Wings and Know
nothings in this Congressional district are con
certing arrangements for the defeat Of Judge
Caskie. We dare say the rumor is reliable.
The plan OF revolution disclosed by the Lynch
burg VUginian, embraces Offices of every
grade, from the highest to the lowest; and II
is scarcely possible that SO distinguished q
champion Of the Democratic party as the Re.
preventative from this district, will escape with
out opposition. We know of more than one
Whig lawyer and Know-nothing demagogue
who covet the distinction Of Representative
from the Metropolitan district. Judge Caskie
is the son Of an adopted citizen, and it matters
not that his father illustrates in his character
every private and public virtue Of an American
freeman. He is Of foreign extraction, which is
crime enough in the proscriptive code Of
know-nothingism, to condemn him to exclu-
sion from every public trust or employment.
:"" 1t is the set purpose Of the Democracy Of
this District to send Judge Caskie back to
Congress. He is capable and faithful repre-
sentative, is never absent from the post Of
duty, and is equally respected for purity Of
character and vigor of intellect. We may
affirm, without suggesting any invidious COM
parson, that the interests of Richmond and OF
the entire District were never more efficiently
represented in the Congress of the United
States. No man of any party can accuse him
of neglect Of public duty. 1t is in the malice,
but is not in the power of Know-nothingism to
harm him. The Democracy, to whose prin.
ciples he has adhered with undertaking devo-
ton, and whose interest he has served with
equal fidelity and efficiency, will not suffer him
to be stricken down by the asassin's stab of
Know-nothingism. There will be need in the
next Congress Of just such men from the South
as John s. Caskie.""


We copy the above from the Richmond En-
quirer. 1t is a fit tribute to a gentleman who
in his political and personal career, has Illus
trated all the best attributes of Virginia
character Judge Caskie is not only gentle
man Of fine talents, but Of great cultivation
and eminent integrity. AS Democrat he has
always been firm and unyieldng. AS a repre-
sentative in Congress, he has been infexible
in his fidelity and devotion to those great politi
cal principles that constitute the only sound
school of politics--the rights and the union of
the States.


That such man should be defeated by the
old, or the new opposition, or by corrupt
coalition of the two, would be a reproach to the
distinguished Metropolitan District which he
represents. We have faith in the integrity of
the people, and the people of the Richmond Dis
trct must have faith in the fidelity, integrity and
ability OF their representative Caskie"

 Kentucky City, Sept. 8, 1855.

 Dear Sir: 1 enclose an advertisement of a sale of lots to take place at Kentucky city, on the 22d of October next; also, lithographic plat or plan of the city.

 You are aware that tn larger portion of that great north and south railroad, from the gulf of Mexico to the lakes of the north is now con- pleted, and that the cars will be running on that whole line of road from Mobile by Ken lucky city and Cairo, to Chicago and Galcna, be- fore the end of the year 1856.

 You will perceive that, that road runs from Mobile to the Mississippi river at Kentucky city, thence a ferriage or connection of fifteen miles by steam packet boat between Kentucky city, and Cairo. This road, running north and south, crossing the parellels of latitude, meets with and causes a constant exchange of pro- ductions, and forms connecting chain between people of every character, and climates of every description, and becomes channel for distri- outing their varied productions; St. Louis is the great central depot of the vast agricultural and mineral productions of thatimmense and fertile region of the upper Mississippi Missouri, and Illinois rivers, and the dangers, losses, and hinderances, resulting from the unsafe and uncertain navigation between St. Louis and Kentucky city, has induced the enterprisng capitalists of that great and growing city, and the energetic, enterprising agriculturists of the interior, to organize companies to construct railway connection from St. Louis via the Iron mountain, to a point on the Mississippi river opposite Kentucky city, portion of which is rox- hainfr TO ni11,, constructed

 The nearest and most practicable connec ton from St. Louis to the gulf and south Allan tic cities, will ever be by Kentucky city to Mobile and New Orleans, and also by Ken lucky city to Charleston and Savannah, for the mouth of the Ohio is the nearest point of the Ohio and Missippi rivers to Nashville or Char eston.

 The road from Nashville to New Orleans crosses the Mobile and Ohio road at Aberdeen, Miss, and thus direct route from St. Louis by Kentucky city and Aberdeen to New Or leans.

 An act of Congress ""approved 9th Feb, 1853,"" making grant of alternate sections of public lands for the Atlantic and Pacific road, from point on the Mississippi river opposite to the west end of Kentucky by Little Rock and Fulton to Texas, thus definitely and ire vocably fixing by Congress the eastern or Mis- sissippi terminus of the main trunk line of that great road.

 Kentucky city is the nearest point of the Mlssissippiriver to Louisville, Cincinnati, mouth of Big Sandy, Baltimore etc., etc, and as it never freezes or gets too low for navigation be- low the mouth of the Ohio, this has, therefore, been designated as the ""lo'oer end of the upper country and tic upper ed of tue o,oer conaty,' for here 1t IS that all the rivers from the Aleghany and the Rocky mountains concentrate their vast waters ofnear 10000 miles of navigation, and where railroads from the gulf and south Atlantic, will meet and connect with those from the northern lakes, and from the Pacific through Texas and Arkansas. This point is not only geographically and commercially, but polit- cay central, for 1t is here that the slave hold ing and non-slave- holding States come togeth- CT upon this mighty river, and was this it poziti- cal centrality which so shaped the bill in Con- gress, donating the public lands and fixing the beginning or terminus of the Pacific road at this point The northern members in Congress would not vote the lands and funds of the na- tion to build a NATIONAL road from point upon the Mississippi below this, and opposite to slave holding State, nor would the southern members go for an appropriation from point further north and opposite -slaveholding State.

 The line of railroad is now either under con- tract or completed the whole distance from New York by Baltimore, Washington city, across Virginia by the mout Bigh of Sandy and Lexington, to Louisville. The line of railroad from New York to the west, passing south of the Ohio river to Louisville, will soon be com pleted, and the public lands already granted will secure the road from the west across Texas and Arkansas to the west end of Kentucky, thus leaving unprovided for only the link from Louisville to Kentucky city, to secure the con- pletlon of the great Pacific road so as to PASS THROUGH KENTUCKY.

 An air line drawn across the map from Balti- more to the Pacific at San Diego will pass over the mouth of the Ohio.

 The line of railroad will soon be completed from Washington city by Lynchburg, Abingdon, and Cumberland gap to Danville Ky., and if extended thence by Bowling green and Rus sellville, it will connect at Hopkinsville with the road from Louisville to Kentucky city.

 The road is now completed from Charleston to Nashville, and is being constructed from Nashville to Hopkinsville, which will secure the travel and transportation from Charleston by Nashville, Hopknsvile and Ky. city to St. Aoulo duu Guc great west, CuOuSu Lu0 Nashville snd north western road"" will give a nearer connection from Nashville through Ten nessee to this point.

 | No railroad has been constructed from the interior to point on a navigable river, without greatly increasing the business and the value of real estate at such terminus. Look, for instance at the immense appreciation of real estate in Nashville since the completion of the Chattanooga road to Nashville.

 | This great road from the south Atlantic States to Kentucky, connects the best harbor and most central point upon the Gulf of Mexi- CO., and the most eligible and nearest point upon that gulf with the mouth of the Ohio which a late Senator from Illinois, in report made to the United States Senate says lis one of the most remarkable points on the globe. The confluence of the Ohio with the mighty Mis- sssppi, a spot to which all the great rivers of the west converge, and where most of the con- merce bound on their bosoms must pass on its way to the ocean, or from State to State- There terminate the valleys of the Tennessee and the Cumberland, which come down from the south as if to meet their kindred streams from the north; of the Ohio from the east, which throws its branches to the Alleghany mountains on the one side, and almost to the borders of the lakes on the other; of the upper Mississippi, which descends almost from the frozen sea oi the>north, and of the Missouri, with numerous branches, stretching to the Rocky mountains in ! the west"""

fancy incident occurred at the Broad
way Theatre, New York, some year or
two ago. The pit was crowded with anx-
ious spectators to see Mr.. Forest play his
favorite character of Otheilo. A loud
talking Kentuckian sat on one of the front
seats; and as he had been drinking rather
freely, he seemed determined to enjoy
the play without regard to the comfort er
convenience of his neighbors. Every now
and then Kentucky would rise in his seat
and make some criticism on the conduct
of the jealous niger with white wife =
He said it was onnataral that any right
nice white gal should take to yallar
iniggar like that. Finally his feelings be-
came so worked up that he stood upon the
bench and shouted, 81 say stranger, | 90
in for lynching that niggar, L go in for it!
whoop!"" and giving spring he landed
on the foot lights Of the stage. Two or
three policemen were on the spot in few
minutes, and Kentucky was forthwith ta-
ken to the station-house. In the morn
ing he was fined five dollars for being
drunk and dsorderly ""I don't mind the
fine,"" said he, ""but its shameful in Chris
tian country to let a big buck niggar i'm
pose on rite nice white gal in that on
natural way"" 1t was Kentuck's IS first ad-
venture in the city, and he became quite
lion among the policemen of the bloody
sixth."

was the offence for which his Office was
mobbed and his press thrown into the
river, in which he said his press had oc-
cupied conservative, national ground,
promptly opposing the men and the
measures that had brought on that crisis.
and in which the question was asked if
the President would meet it promptly !;
stating also that there was no true sense
of justice in Kansas, that the judges of
the elections had been displaced and 9TH
ers appointed, that the polls had been
oyerawed by men armed with pistols aud
bowie knives; and then asking-""Isthis
what the advocates of Kansas call squat
ter sovereignty


This was the cause of drawing togeth-
er hundreds of armed men, resolved to
abate as nuisance free, independent
press. Though Missouri is sovereign
State, with republican form of govern
ment guaranteed to her citizens, the free
dom of the press is taken away at the
instigation of rowdies and blacklegs.-
The governor, Judges and justices are
leagued together to make Kansas slave
state. Rather than submit to live in
Park county where the ipress cannot be
free, he would live in pandemonium-he
would ""rather be dog and bay the
moon, than such a Roman"" Applause
The paragraph which he read was pub
lished on the 9th of April last, and on
the 18th crowd ofarmed men surround
ed his printing Office. About I9 o'clock
NJ, fifteen armed men walked into the
Office and took the speaker prisoner
When they were asked by *hat authori-
ty, they did not pretend TO have any; he
would see by what authority if he would
wait. At their heels crowds of armed
men came in, so that / so men were prob
ably in the Office at one time, and 800
about the door. The press was taken
and put upon a wagon, and covered with
a white cap, on which was written ""Bos-
ton Aid"" and carried off and deposited,
as they said, sin the tomb of all the Cap
ulets,"" to wit: the Missouri river. Had
it not been for the devotion of his wife,
the speaker himself would probably have
been killed.


After destroying the press, they passed
certain resolutions declaring that the
paper was nuisance, which had been
endured too long; that they would come
there again in three weeks, and if they
found the editors there then, or at any
subsequent time, they would throw them
too into the Missouri river, and if they
went to Kansas, they pledged to hang
them wherever they could take them
and also, that they would suffer no person
belonging to the Northern Methodist
church to preach in Parkville, under
a penalty of tar and feathers for the first
offence, and hemp rope for the second.


The charge of abolitionism made
against the editors of the Luminary was
false, and they knew it. But they need
ed an excuse and chose that charge, be-
cause it would satisfy the public better
than the real cause. The fact was, At
Gibson wanted to control the press, but
could not, though it was covertly stated
that sycophancy would be well rewarded
1t was also stated that the press had sep
arate editions for the north and the south,
containing different sentiments on the
slavery question; and there were other
reasons, equally false, given for their re-
sort to mob violence. Sooner than sub
NIT to what they demanded, or to remain
in Platte comfy, the speaker would pre-
fer to live with the Digger Indians. As
specimen of the feeling of the people
there, he said, school commissioner
having a teacher presented to him, told
the candidate he should have acertihcate
if he could parse the sentence, ''Park d
Patterson's Press was thrown into the
Missouri river onSaturday."" He did it.
and received his certificate.


The incidentsconnected with the death
of Malcolm Clarke, the mobbing and
lynching of Mr.. Phillips, were then Civ
en-, substantially as they have been pre-.
sented to the public in the newspapers
He then enquired who was responsible
for all this violence. All right feeling
men denounce it; and even in Missouri
were the law abiding citizens to have an
opportunity to pronounce upon the con.
duet of Atchison and his allies, they
would emphatically condemn their whole
proceedings. The settlers of Kansas
must not have any of the odium, for they
have an indisputable right to go there
and to hold whateveropinions they please
Their homes are there, and if they shed
blood, it is by repelling force with force,
and in defence of their fire-sides. Gap
plause.) Atchison is the chief eulprit
and those who furnish him with money
are his guilty accessories. 1t is the de-
yout wish of every lover of his country
that they may be brought to eondigr
punishment. The papers of Missouri
are many of them nourished by govern.
ment patronage, and they are Atchison's
principal engineers. Probably the Pres
ident has been deceived by Atchison a:
Douglas was. There cannot be doub'
what the Presidents course WILDE wher
all the facts are known tohim. Mr.. Pat
terson then spoke in complimentary terms
of Gov. Reeder. The charges that have
been brought against him have been
made because he has made himself, ,ob.
noxious to the riotous portion of the
Missourians.


Atchison and Stringfellow, and Judge
Tomlinson. have squatted on lands where
they are laying off town ; and be va:
credibly informed chat all the council
men of Kansas have been instructed t.
vote to make Calhoun-the town they
are laying off-the seat of government
Mr.. Patterson then alluded to the cause
of his visit to Boston; denied any knoEl-
edge of the Emigrans Aid Society plans
or purposes till be came here, but was
now satisfied they were good, and tha:
all that had been said against the Society
was untrue.


At the close of his remarks vote o.
thanks was passed unanimously, for his
open. candid, independent address."

BRoTHERs-California has been the best taxed
and the worst governed country of which there is
any record. In vain have the onerous exactons of
government been paid without stint. In vain have
thus far all the sources of peaceful reformation
been exhausted. Long suffering has not propiti-
ated our rulers, nor has indignant reiiionstrance
been able to inspire terror Evil has followed evil
calamity has been heaped upon calamity, until
the young State which yesterday filled the world
with her renown, to-day lies bankrupt, crime-rid-
den, and abject. Much, very much of our misfor-
tunes is the result of accident and contingencies
which no human foresight could have prevented
but that crime, fraud, and infamy should have ag-
gravated our sorrow, we must blame ourselves and
reckless public policy. But there is always a
limit to passive endurance of fragrant wrongs, by a
free and enlightened people. The history of the
election campaign of '55 in our State is ample tes-
timony that the people united to inaugurate a
stronger, wiser, and better government. Let it be
fervent hope, Brothers, that this time they have
not been deceived.


What have been the issues thrust upon us here
tofore, in the political world? Not our home in
tcrests-the political sanhedrim of California has
uniformly kept them from the view of the people,
and has cunningly fomented discord on issues for
eign to this State In legislative halls and in
our cabinet councils, the interests of California
have been subordinate topics to the political issues
which have convulsed the old States since 1913.
What are these to us! California has asked for
REFORM and she has been answered by a camor
abont the annexation of Cuba She has asked for
a railroad, and the response has been howl upon
the Nebraska Bill. She has asked for protection
against Lynch law, judicial corruption and imbe-
cility She has asked for speedy settlement of
our land titles, and for proper and just protection
of the bona fde settler, and disunion is thundered
upon our in reply. Have we not mission in
tl,n rryII 1,t1,& /
tinct destiny to work out :! The broad Pacific lies
before us to bring into commercial subjection, and
wilderness behind US in hardly diminished wealth


invites the enterprise of the pioneer and capitalist
lntemperance and corruption banquet in corruption
in high places in the land, and bold and bloody
crime stalks unchecked in our midst


While these home duties are before us to per-


orm these domestic wrongs to redress, are we ever
to hang loosely on the skirts of remote scrambng
factions over the mountains kicked and trodden on
by all, suffering all the heat and dust of the tur-
moil without the hope of receiving any of the tro
phies of the contest Neither the success or defeat
of the Nebraska BIll-neither American or Spanish
dominion in Cuba-neither the cotton spinners in
Massachusetts-nor the cotton planters of Alaba-
ma, could or would at the cost of dollar advance
the interests Of California one jot. The main duty
of California at this juncture is to herself.


The questions which have caused such serious
agitation in the old States, are the which we
wish to ignore and discard from this State. Let us
rest assured that the Union is safe-that liberty
strikes its root too deep and strong in American
soil-to be SO easily and suddenly uprooted. But
even did danger impend, it is not in the power of
California to rescue the continent from its immi-
nent doom. Yet, we too, owe duty to the Con-
federacy in this question: and sectional isola-
ton enables to take noble and impressive stand
upon it. Removed, as we are, by position and ac-
tual interest from its baleful influence we should
allay instead of participating in its agitation. An
alyze this slavery question. 1t has proud prin-
thies. Side by side, in friendly contact repose the
historic States of Pennsylvania and Maryland
one free and the other slave State, the border
lines of the Hotspur State Kentucky, come flush up
to those of the young giant Ohio, and the pioneer
of the Western plains the Missouran, has only to
stretch his arms across imaginary line to shake
hands with his friend from the granary of the
West, Illinois. Here, at the very line of contact
between the slave and free States, there is compar
atively little feeling the subject of their different
domestic institutions, and would be none at all
were they let alone, but exactly in proportion as
we recede from this line, where were the question
one of principle, would see deadly border war
fare, do we find the antagonism growing stronger
and stronger, and instead of Pennsylvania finding
fault with her neighbor Massachusetts, and Nlissis-
sippi are at loggerheads. Why should we, there
fore, lend our voices to swell the clamor Why
enlist in cause so senseless and improbable in
itself, which while it divides us to our own des.
truction, is valueless to those with whom we SYM
pathise. Our true course to the confederacy and
ourselves tn mind our own huSinnSs and 1et"

We get the following from Col: Smith s
late work, Managerial Coup dEtat:


On the second night we performed Pizarro,
my brother acting the part Of Rolla. In the
last act, after seizing the child, and as he was
rushing up towards the bridge, he observed
a tall negro holding tea cup full of blood,
rose pink which was wanted almost imme-
diately on the other side of the stage. As he
passed. he said to the negro:


Here. boy, carry that blood round to me
on the other side-I want it the moment
cross the bridge""


Away dashed ROlla. bearing the child aloft,
amidst a volley of Spanish musketry; and
turning to cut away the bridge with his sword
what was his horror to see the tall negro walk
upon the stage, between the waters"" and
In full sight of the audience, holding the cup
in one hand and stirring up the contents with
the forefnger of the other, and hear him ex-
claim:


Here, Massa Smith. here's your blood""

ately, to shut in the ludicrous scene.

A. B. BIRD, Chairman.


The report of the committee was adopted.


On motion of Mr.. Applegate, Daniel Cribbs
was chosen Vice President
Messrs. Applegate, Mitchell and Lynch,
were appointed a committee to draft resOlu-
tiOns expressive of the sense of the Conven-
| tion.


The Committee reported the following,
which were unanimously adopted:
| Whereas, the preservation of our Republi-
can institutions depends upon the promulga-
ton and advancement of Democratic princi-
ples as handed down to us from the Fathers
OF the country. and whereas it is the earnest de-
sire of the Democracy to sustain those princi-
Piles around which we have so often rallied,
therefore


Be it Resolved, That the Democratic party
have ever been bold and energetic in the ad-
vOcacy of its political doctrines, and fearless
and determined in denouncing the hereses of
| its political adversaries. and that no crisis has
ever occurred in the history Of our country
when we could with such pride and implicit
confidence proclaim to the world our detesta-
ton of all secret political associations. and
our entire adherence to the old landmarks of
the party.


| Resolued, That the Importance of the ap-
preaching election, and the wiles and artifces
of the Know. Nothings render it the impera-
tive duty of every true democrat to inculcatc
and disseminate spirit of zeal and deter
mined interest SO that in the coming contest
the warfare shall be alone between the Demo-
cratic party and those secret political organi-
cations, whose proscriptve doctrines tend di-
rectly to the destruction of our glorious Union.


Resoived, That the endearing principles of
civil liberty embodied in the Declaration of
Independence by the immortal Jefferson, and
sanctioned by the constitution of the United
States which renders ours the land of liberty
and all asylum for the oppressed OF all nations.
| have ever been cherished as cardinal doctrines
in the Democratic faith; and every attempt to
abridge the rights guaranteed by these sacred
instruments ought. and will be resisted with
the same spirit that swept from our statute
books the Alien and Sedtion laws.


Res0lved, That we invite all Democrats
who may for time have entered the Know
Nothing organization, to return to their for
m faith and prime Piles, and abandon an in
sttution which is dlametrcally opposed to
sound democracy and the true principles OF
our government, and confined to narrow
prejudice unworthy the freemen of liberal
republic like ours.

ern District Of California, was murdered in cold
blood in the streets of San Francisco on the 18th
inst. by a gambler named Charles Cora, who
will be remembered by some of the older resi-
dents Of this place. Gov. Bigler was standing
within a few yards Of the parties at the time the
foul deed was committed. The following ac-
count Of the unhappy affair is taken from tbs
Alta:


Excepting triAing difficulty in bar-room
on the previous evening, ESQ trifing that it gave
rise to no apprehension that anything serious
would grow ont OF it) there was no manner Of
Misunderstanding between Richardson and Co
ra and even the difficulty alluded to o~was quiz
eted and settled to the mutual satisfaction of the
parties concerned. Just after explanations, and
perhaps apologies, which took place at the ""Blue
Wing"" ON Montgomery street, Cora and Gen.
eral Richardson walked down Clay street to-
gether. They stopped near the corner of Leid-
esdortf street, where they were observed by at
least two witnesses, and where Cora placed a
pistol at Gen. Richardson's breast and shot him
throash-the ball entering just above the left
nipple. Gen. Richardson fell dead upon the
sidewalk, scarcely breathing after the fatal shot
The excitement which arose when these facts
became known was widespread and intense



the members of the old Vigilance Committee
rallied to its call. Although there was some talk
of lynching, yet wiser couasels prevailed, and it
was conceded that the murderer was safe in the
custody OF the officers of the law. Fifty men
were selected from the Vigilance Committee to
guard the county Jail, where Cora is now con-
fined. Gen. Richardson 33 years of age
He had been Quartermaster General of the Cal
iforna militia; was member of the Democrat
ic National Convention in 1926 and since
March, 1853, has been Z. S. Marshal for the
Northern District Of California. He was faith

Slavery Among the Old Germans.",,"~


Slavery Among the Old Germans.


The little historical tract of Tacitus,
Ode Germania,"" is one of the most val
liable portions of ancient history that has
come down to us. 1t carries us back to
the very cradle of that proud, imperious,
and aggressive race that now leads the
civilization of the world. 1t shows US
that the infant nation was strongly marked
by those characteristics which are at this
day so fully developed in the Anglo-Sax-
on stock. ""The British constitution""
says Montesquieu, Originated in the
woods of Germany"" The Germans had
kings, but their power was limited
They had senate of mobiles, or house of
lords, but they were not permitted to de-
eide only upon minor matters. The peo-
pie, in their assemblies, discussed the
great affairs of State; and from their de-
cree there was no appeal.


The Germans had slaves among them,
who were managed like the serfs of the
middle ages. They were adscripti gleJa,
attached to the SOIL They had their
own houses and lands, for which they
paid rent. The account which Tacitus
gives of them is as follows: ""Their slaves
have not, as with us, particular employ
ments assigned to them throughout the
household. Each slave is master of a
habitation and family of his own. The
lord requires of him certain quantity OF
corn, cattle, or cloth, as from a tenant
and, so far only, the subsection of the
slave extends. The wife and children of
the master perform the other domestic
duties. 1t is rare to scourge slave, to
bind him, or task him with labor. They
are sometimes killed by their masters, not
through severity of chastisement, but in
the heat of passion, like private enemy,
except that it is done with impunity.
Freedmen are little superior to slaves,
rarely of any importance in the family,
never in the State, except among those
tribes which are ruled by kings. There
they rise above the free-born, and even
the mobiles. In the other tribes, the in
ferior condition of the freedmen is a proof
of liberty


Several facts here mentioned are wor-
thy of notice: Though servitude among
the Germans was mild, still it produced,
as usual, the bitter fruits of violence and
prejudice. The master became imperi-
Gus by the exercise of power; and when
in rage, often took the life of his me-
NAL. He did this with impunity, be-
cause his peers and judges were in like
condemnation. The Legislators protected
each other, and left the serf to his fate
Such is ever the result of unlimited pow
er. 1t is never safe to intrust the lives
and liberties of one class in the commu-
nifty to the arbitrary control of another.
The historian informs us, that the freed
man neither obtained rank nor honors.
He was despised because he had been a
slave. The badge of servitude was up
on him, and he could not rise. Such is
usually the condition of freedmen in re-
publics. In monarchical governments no
such prejudice exists; and why? Be-
cause there the lines which separate the
different classes in society are distinctly
drawn. A noble is never mistaken for a
| plebeian. 1t matters not how he obtained
his nobility, whether by birth, wealth, in
dustry. or flattery; if he holds the rank,
his title is respected, and all the world pays
him homage. So, under the government
of imperial Rome, fayorite freedmen who
ministered to the vices of the emperor,
were made his con6dants and his minis
ters. The same is true of the Turkish
empire eatthis day. In 1848, Lieut.. Lynch
remarked ""The Secretary of the pres
ent Sultan ofTurkey was poor boy. He
owes his station to his talents and study.
The late Sultan wanted page to wait on
him. He ordered the best scholar to be
taken from one of the public schools.
The Secretary was the fortunate boy i; and
by his fidelity he has risen to his present
high station. Here is an instance where
a pIebeian was exalted to the highest Of
fee in the gift of the monarch, to the ex-
Iclusion of his own relatives. The Viz
I lSf OF TIE OultaI, IL GdAtu HUH tslC oVE-
ereign's own family, must be a slave; for
the beautiful ladies of the harem are all
purchased of the slave-dealers of Geor-
gia and Circassia; and the child follows
the condition of the mother""
I In making the distinction between the
freedmen of monarchies and those of re-
spubiics, Tacitus shows his usual philo-
sophie acumen, and his thorough knowl-
edge of men and manners. He adds:
Sc the inequality of freedmen in other
tribes is proof of liberty"" This as
seftion contains law which is always
manifested where the evil passions ofmen
are not restrained by public opinion or
legal enaetments. Men, always envy
those who are on line with them in the
race of preferment. The runner in the
course viii jostle him who hangs uPonhii
shoulder or is upon the point of passing
him. Thus, Virgil represents Nisus de-
priving his rival ef0ntory, when him
self bad fllen:-"
