A CHURCH PANIC.

Terrible Disaster at q Lynch


burg Va, COlored Meeting.

THE RESULT OF FALSE ALARM.

TEN PERSONS KILLED AND UPWARD OF


THIRTY INJURED.",,"LYNcHBURG, Oct. 16.
A most terrible and heart-rending scene
occurred In this city at ten o'clock to-
night. A marriage ceremony was pro-
crossing at the Court Street Colored
Baptist Church, which was packed to its
utmost capacity. Some of the ceiling
pIastering fell, and the immense crowd
at once became panic stricken aud many
in the galleries jumped from thewindows
of the second and third stories; others
threw themselves headlong down the
stairway on the crowd belew. Men and
women crowded each other to the only
door of exit there was in the lower build
ing, and most of the killed were literally
crushed to death. No men are known
to have been injured. The fire alarm
was sounded at the Fire Department,
military and throngs of citizens were on
the spot promptly to endeavor to allevi-
ate the condition of the suffering and
dying.


The following bodies have been ident-
fep Maria Wilson, Virginia Robinson,
Maria Ransom, Mollle Ward,i Mary
Hedry, Emma Brown, Arena Cox.


Two unknown bodies are in the yard.


Three women are in the church in a
dying condition. The wounded are sup
posed to number at least thirty, who are
being removed in vehicles and on litters
to their homes.


1t is impossible in the confusion to as
certain the exact number injured The
streets are crowded with frantic men and
women searching for their friends. The
colored people seem perfectly horror
stricken, but the whites are rendering
every assistance possible


One of the wounded has just died on
the corner of Church and Seventh Sts.


Many of the wounded, it is feared can
not survive."

 March comes in like a summer day, as gentle as child, and if old savings ali be true, it will go out amid storm and tempest s like lion, fierce and wild.- C. Y. Shelton sends in word that Lynx Creek is booming. that placer miners have plenty of water and are whooping up the dirt and everlastingly scooping out the gold. Messrs. Nash aud Zimmerman, of Will Hanson Valley, were in town this morning. The farmers of Williamson Valley are quite hopeful that the approaching season wiIl be a profitable bne.

 Speaking of bankruptcy reminds us that If local items were the only legal tender. hereabouts, we should all become involun- tary bankrupts- There are absolutely none in circulation.

 George E. Brown has been on a scout as far as the Verde Valley looking after seed potatoes and the like. Brown. Marsh and Boettcher are thinking of farming the Jeff Davis ranch on the Hassayampa.

 Wilson < Haskell are busy, to-day, put ting the floor timbers in the upper story of the Courthouse, in order to give the brick layers a show to finish the walls, which they will not be long in doing when the carpen- ters get out of the way.

 No PRESS REPoRT-The telegraph line is working to-day, but so badly that no press report can be had.

 There is about bushel of prepaid mes sages lying at Yuma, that have preference, and are coming through with difficulty.

 Coop NEWS FROM THE TIpToP.-Mr. Wright. of Wright tS Kading, writes to A. Mcbride, of Thorne S Mcbride that the Tiptop mill is running splendidly, the pulp assays. as it comes from the battery, average Sf ,200 per ton. This, as everybody knows. who knows anything about mining, and milling is extraordinarily rich.

 It is rumored at the Post that the masked en-who invaded the residence of Col. Will kins, few nights ago, were neither bur glars nor soldiers who could not be account ed for on their rolls at night, but a couple l of officers bent on having a little inno- centGl amusement at the expense of others |

 l.. F. They should be confined in the guard house. George E. Brown gives lively account of | farming operations in Verde Valley. The people are putting in grain under the old l ditches; and ou the north side of the river above the Post new ditch is being con- structed which takes in number of new farms. There is no lack of water wherever they have ditches in any part of the Valley, and Brown regards the 'syerde Vale"" as the garden spot of Arizona.

 THE MILLER BROTHERS BANKRUPTCY cAsE.-Judge Tweed denied tie application of the Miller Bros. to De released from the custody of the U. s. Marshal, without ponds, yesterday afternoon, and made an order that they appear before C. B. Rush, in Bankruntcy, this morning, o answer questions concerning their prop .rty, ability to pay, etc.

 They appeared at ten o'clock, in obedi- nee to the order, but refused to answer, on he grounds that they were not yet ad- judged bankrupt.

 The matter was then sent before Judge Tweed, on a charge of contempt. who ruled hat they must either answer or 90 to prison pr contempt of Court, and remarked that e did not propose to have the Court made farce of that if they could not De accom- lodated with quarters in the county jail he hould have 10 apply to the Commanding fficer at Fort Whlpple for place for them T the military prison.

 Finding that they must either answer or o to prison for contempt, they agreed to nswer at ? p. M., before the Commissioner. n the meantime they are still in thecustody the Marshal, Tn default of the bond re- uired 70 insure their attendance from time ) time in Court.

Boston, Aug. ""a succession of
showers, accompanied by heavy thunder
and vivid lightning, visited this st ction
to-day, and considerable damage Is re-
ported at various points. At Rye Beach,
n. H., the shower at noon is reported as
having been terrific, and accompanied by
hail and violent wind, the latter being
quite wide IN its path, and blowing dow n
whole sections OF woodland. The bow
ling alley of G.. A. Jeness was completely
wrecked. The doors of the postoffice
were blown down and the building was
flooded with water. The chimney of s.
B Spears boarding-house was blown
down. A small boarding-house near the
bathing beach was blown over. The
bridge at the bathing beach was demo-
lished and several of the buildings were
more or less injured. A small boarding
house on the beach, owned by n. L,
Cate, of Nortbwood, n. H., occupied by
about twenty people, was split in two, but
fortunately the inmates escaped injury.
Whole acres of woodland are blown
over, and nearly all the chimneys in the
track of the storm are blown down. No
lives were Ilost

rible tornado passed over Wallingford
about 6 O'Clock this evening, and blew
over houses, uproOted trees and caused
the greatest devastation. tits estimated
that the killed will number at least twen-
ty, while the wounded reach twice that
number. The telegraph wires and poles
were blown down so that II was impos-
81 BILE to communicate directly with New
Haven or outside points. After the tor
nado passed it was found that it had been
confined to a belt of territory about a
half mile wide, and the whole damage
and loss of life had occurred on the sand
plains about a-quarter of a mile Porth of
the railroad station, near the line of the
New York, Hew Haven and Hartford
railroad. At six o'clock, while the men
were leaving their several factories in the
vicinity, IL began to rain gently. In a
| few minutes the rain increased to per-
feet deluge, while the lightning illumina-
ted the darkened sky as bright as day,
| and the thunder rolled with continuous
| and deafning roar. Without a seconds
warning a tornado wind, mingled with
hail and rain, swept across The northern
part of the town from west to east, and
everything movable in its track was car
ried away. 1t seemed to last but a mo-
ment, bur its results were frightful. After

Of about 30 persons, ladies and gsntle-

laughing, and extending TO Mr.. Walton
and his wife tn. salutations Of the day.
Al first Mr.. Walton somewhat alarmed
thought about making some resistance,
and backing the door so that no
enemy could attack from the rear,
but seeing that everybody was
in such a good humor and seeing
amongst the crowd his three sons and
two daughters, 1t hurst upon his mind
that he and his wife, Hannah, had
trudged along life's thornny pathway
until the 42nd milestone had been
reached, and this demonstration was
in honor OF that event. The aged
couple surrendered gracefully into the
hands of their captors, who took full
possession Of the house, and clearing
the little table soon had a larger
one spread and loaded with the luxu-
ri-s that sincere flial love and respect
always prompt upon such an occa

q. II. WINDLE,
LEWIS PAINTER,
JOHN JONES,
lHdHce COInDlUUee.


On the motion to adopt the report Mr.
| Windle said it might be thought the
| Finance Committee was extravagant in
raising the tax rate, but it should be borne
in mind that the properly assessment
has been reduced about $4,000, 600 from
last year. The present finance commit
| tee, he sad, has done what no previous
| committee dared to do-that is, faced the
| music and raised the tax rate to u figure
sufficient to meet the expenses of the
year without leaving large floating de bit
to be funded at the next session of the
Legislature.


Mr.. Lynch thought the increase of the
| tax rate was enormous. While the as
sessment was reduced 1t wa, mostly on
large houses, and the poor people would
be the greatest sufferers by the Increased
| tax rate.


| Mr.. Paynter said he was not lacking in
sympathy for the poor, but he felt i'm
/ PEELED to look at this matter in business
| light. 1t was not advisable to have de
ficlency, and the city must raise money
enough to meet Its expenses. 1t would
be a close shave to do this even at the
increased rate, and the Council cannot
make the rate any lower and be honest
in the matter.


Mr.. Chandler was glad the Finance
Committee had taken this stand. The
people demand great deal of work from
| Council, aud it takes money to do thil
| work. If the people complain that thei
taxes are too high, let them make les
fuss about improvements. Mr.. Chand
Ter thought the increased tax would ad
init of great deal of work being done
which would benefit the poorer people


Mr.. Norton claimed that it would not
as the city work was always done by
| nj, fun HI fbnnnlt
pie could not stand this increase of taxes
The majority of people are poor, an,
Council should accede to the wishes o
the majority.


Mr.. Payhter thought the Finance Com
mittee had already been very considerat
to the poor men, and had allowed al
error list for 1877 of nearly $4,000. Th
increase of the tax rate would aft, ct tn
poor men very slightly, but it would at
feet the rich men; the richer the man th
more his taxes will be.


| Mr.. Norton-And the more he will bt
able to pay them.


Mr.. Windle thought if the rate was no
increased the error list would be still
larger next year. The houses Of the poo
men are small, and the increase ON theI
will be only one or two dollars each.


Mr.. Lynch objected to the inconsist
ency of the plan; while everybody els
Twas economizing Council was increas
ling its expenses. He claimed that tn
Board of Revision did not reduce the as
sesSment on poor mems properties.


Mr.. Windle asserted that the Boar,
| took row alter row of small houses an,
reduced them from $1,000 to $500.


Mr.. Paynter insisted that the increased
tax rate would barely raise enough
money to cover the city's expenses.


Mr.. Hazlstt said work could not b
done without money; the people ask TO
the work and it must be done. The pay
ment of a tax is the only way by whic
u man gains the right of citizenship, AN
the man who does not pay mis- tax is no
a good citizen, the only thing to dc
therefore, is to raise the money.


Mr.. Baker reviewing the case, sal


that per cent. of the increase was mar
datory upon Council, having been in
posed by the Legislature for the beneti
of the schools. Last year the sum u
$lS6, 600 was added to the funded debt q
the city, the Interest on which woul


have to be met. He reviewed the az
propriations, very few of which are fo
permanent improvements, and did no
, see where dollar could be Topped of


or where the city could be run any NOR
, economically.


The report of the committee was the


adopted with but two dissenting votes


Messrs. Lynch and Norton.
Mr.. Windle presented a commune;
ton, but as the clerk was about to rea
it he discovered that it possessed no sis

married her, and is about 20 years old.

Ing to be in no better humor than before

OF but few months rose noiselessly
from the bed and went into the dining
room, where she secured large carving
knife. She then deliberately gashed her
husbands throat from ear to ear.


Being woman of powerful physique.
she TOOK the body of her husband upon
her shoulders, and threw 1t into the
creek which ran through the ard She
then, as the testimony of the chamber

buried the bed clothing and her robe de

OF her crime. She put the knife up the
chimney, where it was found yesterday.
The body OF Capt. I'ravers was found
In the creek on Sunday morning by two
fishermen. Mrs. Travers was arrested
upon suspicion of having committed the
murder. The body was traced from the
psrlor door of the house to the creek by
the clots of blood upon the grass. At

vers stoutly denied the crime, and said
that her husband had lett the bedroom

BRISTOL, Tenn, 0ct IL, 1873.


Intense excitement prevails here the rysteri-
GUS murder OF Mrs Sally Leonard, the wifo of Alex
ander Leonard, Q conductor on the Atlantic, Missis
sipp and Ohio Railroad, whose BODY was found a lew
mornings since in field in the suburbs OF this city.
From its peculiar position and the arrang gemeut
OF the clothing the Impression prevails that
It was placed there after death. This cory is
further borne out by tho fact that quantity st
earth was stuffed in the mouth, but there were no
marks OF violence. An investigation held and 1t
was shown that domestic troubles existed between
the deceased and her husband, which resulted in .
recent separation, and suspicion At first attached 10
two women who, on account Of jealousy, had been
known TO threaten Mrs. Leonard. Further as
closures, however, discredit this theory, and only
serve to enhance the darkness which enveops q
most outrageous and diabolcal crime The murdered
woman and her husband were connected with the
most respectable families in this seclion hence
the extraordiDary excitement mere Tue troubles
isung between them did wholly TO ALLEVIATE
thcm from each other, though they no longer lived
together. tert

AN INDECENT ASSAULT ON GIRL.


WHEELING, w. Va, July 14.-Al-
though West Virginia is famous for mob
violence, the latest attempt at lynching
in this state is the most sensational that
ever occurred here. On Wednesday last
q negro boy named John Briggs, aged
seven years, who lives in Raymond
city, Putnam county, was arrested and
placed in Jail on charge of attempting
to commit rape on little white girl
six years old. The testimony against the
boy was very strong. The girl was bad
ly cut in several places on her face and
neck aud showed marks of asevere beat
ing with a switch, all of which she said
was done by Briggs. Late at night it
was rumored about the village that a
large party of men had determined to
lynch the negro at once. The jailer ap-
piled to the sheriff for aid, and a number
of special con tables were hastily sworn
in to defend the Jail When the mob ar
rived they found that if they attempted
to carry out their designs there would be
a bloody fight. They thereupon held a
formal meeting, and the chairman de-
liberately put the question as to whether
they should proceed. The voting was
done by ballot and resulted in forty-five
against and forty-one for lynching. At
ter making q slight attempt to persuade
the constables to admit them the mob
dispersed and went home. The boy
Briggs is still in Jail."

CASTLE DAILY:

THB

Story of an Irish Home Thirty Years Ago

(Concluded.)",,"The short busy days that were carrying Les


bia on to her crowning day passed in q whir
Of oocu patton with IN ost of the household. Mrs
Ealy WAS little soaudaliz ID that John coult
seldom be found to give an opinion on any o


the arrangements for his sisters wedding


During that last week he was generally eithe
shut up in his study writing newspaper srti
oles or reading Ms. to Ellen, and asking hel
advice how to make q sentence more telling
the State prisoners more convincing. Sht
thouRht 1t . little strange and unsy YIN pathetic
Of those two TO be more occupied with ques
tions of politics than with the approaching
event in their own families bnt Brides dill.
genoe was suffi cient for the despatch OF all
necessary business, and the sight of Pelham'e
triumphant happiness, and Lessias attention
to herself, so ertrely satisfied her to leave
no room for plaintiveness. The wedding was
to be celebrated at Castle Daily.


Bride, who had lately been making constant
excursions there, left the Hollow tiualiy with
John and Lesbia q few days before the day
fixed for the ceremony, and Mrs. DAILY followed
her so as to arrive on the previous afternoon.
Pelham gave his last evening to Ellen, who
was not Yet ttTong enough to bear the drive to
Castle DAILY, aud was to be left at the Hollow
one solitary day. He was very kind and ten
der to her during the hours they were alone
together, while Ellen reclined on Aune's sofa,
wheeled in front OF the turf fire, and Pelham
sat on the low stool in tie nook by the hearth
that used always to be Connor's corner on win
Ter evenings in the old times.


They avoided oil allusiOn to the past, and
talked cheerfully of the bright future that as
opening oot for one { f the two aud Pelh am
oonsulted Ellen about his plans. asking her
tenants and dependents with Difference to
her superior knowledge of the people which,
while it gratified her, gave her q strange seu-
sation Of having died to her giriish self, az
wakered p in the middle of Anne O'Flahelty's
life with All her former cares resting on her
shoulders, and the task given to her of advis-
ing the owner of Castle DAILY, which Anne had
exercised for so many Sears.


Ellen early the next dSy ard saw Pal-
ham ride eff in the dewy October morning to
his wedding. She fastened the last of the
into the button hole of his cost with keen re-
collection of how she had intended to bestow
some OF its earlier blossoms, and then stood in
Size open doorway and watched bis figure les
ssliEg aloUg the winding road till it was lost
among the low bushes on the hill side.


The valley bad never looked fairer, or show
Sd more like an enchanted region, jewel paved
With emerald apd diamond and azure, than it
appeared when Ellen found herself left alone
to gaze on the misty outline of it's protecting
hills, the blue thread of it's winding river, its
opal colored lake, aud it's green slopes ell grow
ing momently more distinct in the Frightening
auushne. There was the old glamour of beau
~, but there as something wanting the old
sights were there, bLt not the old sounds. A
strange silence reigned all about the place that
fell like an ache on Eflen's heat, and ere long
sent her back with fast filling eyes to ut
herself ipt> the empty house. In vain she 'old
herself that as far ss the house was concerned





Her mother would return happier han size
had ever been before, aud there would sroa he
visits from bride and bridegroom, and new iu
aerests and pleasures and occupations would
spring up, making Happy. go lucky Lodge a
centre of happy life again. AS she was quite
alone Ellen thought she might spare at least
halfhsr thoughts from the joyous event of the
day that occupied every body else entirely, and
give herself up for a little space of time to
ommuLing with the past, to waudeIipg about
Tho tutTet rooms, aud in and ont II Aune's
hsuptB and IN imag ginAtlon peopliug them wi th
the figures and faces SO familiar to them once,
Sut which they would now know no more.
This at least was her uppeTmost train of
shongtt ns she crept larguldly up aud down
stairs and stood for half an hour to gether look
ing csntly round the sitting rCome.


Visions of Anue, and Peter Lynch and Con
nor, aud MuTdock Mslacby seemed t. fill her
mind to tho exclusion of everything else; and
yet if she bad spoken out aloud the thought
that wei bed heaviest on her lie art, and SEEM
ed to uuteIlne aud form q dark background
to all her sad recollect ons, she would have re-
peated 8 sentence that had fallen from Pei
hams LIS on the previous evening, when he
had asked her advice ou tie plea that his old
adviser, John Thornley,, would slon be alto
gether out of reach, since be and Bride had
decided starting on their foreign tour i'm.
nediAteiy after the wedding. The house would
net miss them; they could not be reckoned
among lite old freq uenters; their faces and fig
nres had no right to come among the throng
which E!len's fancy called mp, and whose
At sance she nourned over and yet she could
not deny to herself that II Was the thooRot OF
their desertion that msde the future she pict-
ured herself as leading In these rooms, so empty
Of Interest, full of cares too heavy for her to
hear alone.


Towards afternoon she lay down on . sofa
by the turret window and, quite worn out with
the agitation of the morning, fell asleep, and
Blept for some time, till about an hour before
sunset she was awakened by the sound of
horses hoOfs on the bridge. She had told her
self great many times during the day that
she most not hope for news from Castle DAILY
till the next morning, No one could be ex-
pected TO come out to the Hollow such q
busy day merely for the sake of saving her a
few hours solitude and to give her the morn
iug's news little earlier than her mother
eonld bring il. s had told herself this many
times, Yet "" en- the turret room door opened,
and John Thornley, ent gred with a bridal
bouquet in his hand, and good news written
on his face, she did not feel exactly surprised
she all at once understood that she would have
been bitterly disappointed and very unhappy
indeed If he had failed to come.

hand hnriad her face the hl0a-"

Mr. weissinger on behalf OF the man ufacturers Of

by the Convention as expressing their sentiments
the tax question. They also especially favored that
part OF tho Hon. George c. Cabes bill to reduce the
tax TO twelve cents per pound and TO allow draw.

pondent OF the Santa Ana Times,
furnishes the following to that
paper:


The prospecting fever is over to
great extent aud the owners of
claims are either working their To-
cations or making arrangements as
best they can to have them worked d
by others. During the past two
weeks there have been many con.
tracts let to work locations, enough
to develop the same, for an interest
In the claims. The plan is q good
one for many of the claimants are
too poor to work themselves. We
may leok forward to new and rich
developments during the next
month.


Tue developments In the princi-
pal mines are such as would satisfy
the most ambitious miner. Taylor
& Co. are at present sscking ore
that ia richer than any ever before
shipped from this district. The
pay streak Is fourteen inches thick.
There Is report current in the
valley that this mine has run out,
and | will just say that there is no
truth IN the report. There are but
few persons in the valley who
know enythlng about these mines,
and unless person spends lots of
time and great deal OF labor, he
will 20 away with only knowl-
edge of what is open to inspection
and of easy access. What is known
as the Taylor or Florentine mine
Is only spur from the Gray back
ledge, and though it is not large, it
Is rich. Mr.. Flanagan has had
considerable work done on his 10.
cation and with the best results.
If there Is anyone who doubts the
reports in the Times, let them
come to this place and look for
themselvee. They can do the
country more good by doing so, and
then report as they find it, than to
stay away and induce others to
keep away who might help develop
these mines.


Mr.. Lake is trying to let a con-
tract to run all incline of fifty feet
on his ledge, his business at Santa
Ana demanding all his time.


DIR. Harding, of Anaheim, has
contracted to run one hundred feet
on the Wildcat, second extension
north on the Southern Slope.


The Emma Company have shown
some good galena and they intend
pushing work In the future.


I. H. Lynch & Go. have just flu
ished trail two miles in length
from Shrewsbury's caflon to their
mine. They will commence taking
out ore Immediately.


Work is being done on the Santa
Rosa, Southern Belle, Victoria,
Southern Slope, Gold Hill, Emma,
Florentine, Blue Light. Warwick,
and many others."

A. Moor, for whose arrest on IA

shaken the dust of San Francisco
from his feet to return no more.
Since the investigation of the

has told is pretty generally believ-

never again appear before the COM

ever, that our system Is much the more com


Portable and agreeable to the taxpayer. II


England, for instance, there are a score o


taxes, poor rates, church rates, water rates
etc, all Of which are collected by different col


lectors and at different periods of the year


Instead of opening an Office in some conve


nient place and requesting the taxpayer tc
call around and settle whenever convenient
these collectors pursue their unfortunate vic.
tim to his domicile and continue to dun him,
day after day, until paid for in England it Is
the tenant and seldom the landlord who owes
and pays the taxes.


And the tenant does pay his taxes, never
resists them. Think OF that In the land of
John Hampden and tax reslsters, where an
attempt to collect taxes once produced a
bloody civil war. Tax resistance to-day Is
practically unknown In England; the English
man growls good deal over his rates, it Is
true whatever he loves and honors he growls
over-but he pays them after all.


How different Is 1t In this country. When
Dickens WAS over here he paid Americans Il
deserved compliment for the promptitude
with which they stepped up and paid their
taxes. ""The tax collector does not come to
your house."" he says, ""but invites you to
his Imagine an Englshman hunting up this
collector to pay his taxes to him"" But this
promptltude, which struck Dickens so forci-
bly,, and seemed to him an earnest proof that
Americans felt patriotic pride In their
country and were willing to aid 1t In every
way possible, is now, alas extinct-no longer
exists; and we have become instead a race of
confirmed tax-resisters. The disease Is grow
ing worse every year; at first it was only legal
taxes that were resisted, now it Is all; ut first
It was only few litigious persons that
fought the government, soon it became the
whole mass Of the property holders; tax
resisting associations and tax-ressting
leagues were organized everywhere to fight
the government in every court The bit
terness of this feeling has been demon
strated by the late tax rebelions in
several Kentucky and Missouri counties,
where the tax offices were broken into, the
books burned, and the collectors warned not
to attempt the collection of any taxes under
threat Of lynch law.


The various States and municipalities have,
on the other hand, made their tax laws more
and more stringent each year, Georgia 60
ing to the extremity of disfranchising all tax
resisters.


Thus the war between the government and
taxpayers goes on, becoming more bitter
every year. If promptness In the payment of
taxes be proof Of patriotism, patriotic feelings
are rapidly on the wane In this country Such
ls one Of the fruits of bad government, heavy
and fraudulent debts and the general political
disorder, peculation and mismanagement that
The Republican party has developed wherever
It has held full sway."

murder is given in dispatches from

Lynch, respected citizen of Berk-
ley, Texa', died some weeks ago,

seven other children, the eldest,
Clemie, aged seventeen years. On
Friday night the family retired as
usual, q lamp being left burning in
the main room. At midnight the
father was awakened by a pistol
shot, the ball striking him in the
breast. He sprang up and saw u
masked man standing in the mid
die of the room pointing pistol at
him. The assassin fired again, the
bail lodging beneath the collar
bone. Lynch fell unconscious.
When he recovered he found
himself lying in u lane
outside he premises. The
assassin, thinking Lynch dead,
seized' u hatchet and put
the children, who were witnesses,
out of the way. He assaulted
Ciemie and buried the hatchet in
her head. He also crushed the
skulls of three other children, then
set fire to the house. The distract
ed father saw the burning house
fall In on the bodies of his seven
children. The bodies We're after

place in the annals OF rioting, and the law

ligious exercises Precisely what offence
against the Catholic canons it was that in
duced the Archbishop to remove Father
Strupinski from his pastorate over the Poles
of Shenandoah we are not informed. Our
correspondent describes it generally as con-
juring or sorcery accompanied by the work.
ing Of miracles. Fortunately we are not
called upon to discuss this interesting point,


but to proceed with the state of things
that followed his removal. To him sue
ceeded Rev. Alexander Lanarkovich. Now
the flock boasted the luxury of two sets of
Poles, one of which only understands the
Polish and the other only the Lithuanian
language. While the miracle-working
Strupinski could preach to both, the less
miraculous Lanarkovich could only make
himself understood by the Poles proper.


Great discomfort among the Lifts Here
they were pining for the words of salvation,
and while the regular Poles drank in the
good tidings the benighted Lifts sat athirst
and unslaked. Then, it appears, arose George
Muscovitch and Andrew Marousky and
Peter Cutcavitch and asked fve hundred
fellow-Litts if they hadn't got souls to be
saved? They believed they had. Then,


urged somebody, they must drive off the
uni-lingual Lanarkovich and get in q BIZ
lingual ski or witch, as the case might be.

opinion and sundry paving stones
they yesterday morning proceeded to drive

intimating that they would knock him or
any other vich sky high that interiered with
their holy work. Result, scrimmagc with
the police, thirty-fve male and ten female
Lifts in durance vile. The morals Of this
story are obvious :-First-It is bad
to leave vitchs and skis without
good solid religious consolation. Second
1t is bad way to obtain salvations boon
by knocking the parson on the head.
Third-The legal fraternity in Pennsylvania
have evidently been going to the wrong
books. Fourth--This is not the sixteenth
century. Fiith-Even if it was there is
room for two churches in Shenandoah, one
for the vitchs and the other for the skis."

learned from one days rea ding of
newspapers from various parts of
the country, are varied and some-
times curious. Davis was led by
sudden and uncomfortable rage to
kill Rogers with a base ball club In

Ills. AS little premeditation was
shown by Montgomery in South
Adams, Mass. He gave Ellis cider
to drink, but quarreled With him
over o game Of cards, demanded
ten cents for the cider, aud shot
him because he wouldn't pay. A
sudden angry impulse, too, made
Sawyer kill his brother in Decatur.

and quickly that he took his own
life with the same weapon. The
cause Of a quarrel between Colby
and Livingstone, in u Santa Cruz,
Cal, hotel was trivial. Living
stone, waiter, brought cold cup
Of coffee to Colby, who at once q w
into a violent passion and shot the
offender dead. A more reasonable
disagreement between Wilson and
Colemsn, in Galveston, Texas, was
about the wife of Wilson, who was
killed ina desperate duel with


knives. Greer aud Rankin also
fought about woman in Forsyth,
Ga, the former losing his life.
Farrell found provocation to kill

Several love tragedies are alike in
their chief characteristics, in each

passion. But Sturgeon, who killed
Miss Buffum, in Rock Island, HIS,
was exceptionally cruel. He chased
her half mile, and kept firing at
her until she fell with q mortal
wound. Sha Yung, in Utah, tied
his faithless mistress to tree and
threw knives at her, one of the
cuts bringing the torture to an end
in death. Jennie Coyle, in Du-
buque, Iowa. did not kill the lover
who deserted her, nor herself, but
threw her baby into we'll, OIL

The defense reserved their opening.

question as to the right of planters who desire
10 supply their employees with manufactured
tobacco for their own personal use and ac-
conlmodation, we have taken pains, in the
interes. of our readers, through the internal
revenue Office of this place, to get decision
direct from Revenue Commissioner Raum
upon this matter specifically. The decision
obtained by us is as follows: /"" A farmer or
planter who simply supplies his employees
with what manufactured tobacco they need
for their own personal use aud for their
special accommodation, and not with view
to gain or profit to himself, is not regarded
as engaged in the business of selling manu>

"" Pa.",,"A most revolving crime was committed
near Wrightsville, York county, Pa, on
Tuesday evening. A little girl named
Campbell, about ten years of age, ac-
on her way home from days visit to
relatives in the country, was assaulted by
a Misunderstanding tramp. Unable to
accomplish his diabolical purpose the
fiend used pocket knife, iniiicting such
horrible injuries that the poor little vic
tim, after lingering in terribleagony died
on Thursday morning. The ravisher was
arrested and committed to the county

colored men who were believed to
have been concerned in the murder of
a prominent white citizen were killed
by a mob near here on w Wednesday
night. The murder, which was a
hendish one. took place about two
weeks ago. and a negro named Silver
was Immediately hanged for the crime
This was not thought to be sufficient
to vindicate the law, and on Wednes.
day night mob was formed, and pro.
ceeded first to the residence of Tom
Turner, near Brucetown. They called
for him 20 leave his cabin and go with
them, but he refused, saying If they
wanted to kill him they must do 1t
there. He would not submit to b.
blindfolded, and was shot in the pres
ence OF his wife. He was found yes
terday by the Coroner lying in his
night clothes in his bed room, and
with four bullet holes through his
body, all mortal wounds. In the
woods near by we're found the bodies
OF Edward Claxton, of this city, and
John Davis, both colored, hanging To
the limb OF a tree. Nobody in the
neighborhood could give any informa-
tion as to the lynchers of these men,
except that warrants for the arrest had
been issued the day before, and had
not been served. There were seven
men In the party which killed Turner
but none of them could be recognized
by his wife. The affair occurred IN q
rich and thickly settled district,
where the machinery of the courts is
supposed to be in full operation."

to shake cordially. The lady who folio wed
and claimed m iss o + iahertys second greeting
appeared to be about FIVE or six years her
brothers senior, and exaggerated in her person
the neu tral tint etfsct produced by his, that
she gave Anne the Impression of having been
cut out, dress. face, hair, and all, from au i'm
mense sheet of packing paper. Both spoke in
pleasant, well bred tones, and brought out
well-choseu remarks with ""a deliberaton and
air of good sense that reduced Miss Faherty
to state of conscious idiocy, and robbed her
OF all possibility of luventing appropriate re-
plies. Yet though the conveIs alton lapgosh-
ed, har visitors were in no hurry to go away,
and seemed to -fEd-stfi -afnnsement-it,
looking about them W ith air of intelli gent
investigation, such as would have become
European traveller in Ksmschatkau hut or
Indian wigwam. They asked permission to
examine the Good Peoples Hollow works of
art that adorned the eheffoniers and chimney
pieces, and they did examine them thoroughly,
passing little family Mandatory remarks upon
them to each other, that 80 put Anne past her
patience, that she longed to end the talk by
knocking together the two neutral tinted
heads bent critically over her treasures.
Every now and then, while Indifferent dis
course went on, Anne felt that four though tful,
cold eyes were stealing critical glauces at her
self, rs at some strange, unRccountable posi-.
bly, malevolent being, whose ignorant animos-
ity was to be soothed away or rendered harm
less by the charms of superior wisdom and
mAgpanimous example OF tolerant good W i'll.
She went out of the room for few minutes to
order soma additions to her luncheon and
approaching the turret-room door was startled
by hearing laugh, actually a natural girlish
and boyish fit of Taught perpetrated by her
prim visitors, Peeping in, she that Miss
Thornley, had lifted up gaily.oolored feather
flower wreath from the cheffonier and was
holding it round her brothers head, aud m ak
ing him admire the effect in the cracked look
ing-Rlass above the chimney piece. Connor
had cracked the glass long ago, and Anne
know well how distorted everything looked in
it.


The two faces had now tinge of color and
light in them, and the white teeth showed
sgreeably, but it did rot propitiute Anne to
find that her guests stupidity was due to her
presence, and that they could be animated at
her expense. After Luncheon they took a walk
through the valley 20 examine some new cot
t8ges Anne bnildiog, and to talk to
Peter Lynch ahont the druiRing of the bog
lands o. the hillside, and the other agricul-
tural improvements for which the valley was
famous.


Aune read on Peter Lynch's stolid face
fixed determination not TO let a word of useful
Information be dragged from him by her
present visitors, even If he were TO be torn by
wild horses for his silence, and for peace's sake
contrived TO leave her prime min ster to the
ladys management, aud monopollze the com
pnDy of the gentleman herself. Ho did not
like it, and tried at first to show bis indiffer-
ence to any Information on matters of business

munications with Mis- O'Flaherty TO remarks

Lynch when be wished to ask question re-
spectipg the nature of the soil or the works be
saw carried on. Anne could not help enjoying
the puzzled look that Peters astounding re-
plies brought upon his face. In despair, at
last he came back to her, and against the will
of both they were drawn, by the vital interest
that each took in the topics that opened up,
to throw off restraint and talk freely. Anne
had the most to say at first. 1t was the wis
dom or folly of the work of her life that was
in question, and somehow it wss 0 longer an
ins gnifi can't counteuEnce into which she
looked up as she talked. 1t was the thonght-
full pondcripg face, young and yet strangely
old, OF deeply Interested inquirer, whose YER
dict she could not help eagerly wishing to win
for her own views, The questions he asked
showed that Re bad thought great deal on
the subjects he was Investigating, and Anne
answered and argued, and her words flew out
faster and faster, and began to take color from
her hopes instead of her experience, till she
fouud herself expounding unreservedly to this
stranger some of the most cherished dreams
aud aspirations of her solitary hours. This
was while they were Investigating the indust-
rial works aud chief points of interest in

After Heightened progress they returned to the

had the double effect on Anne O'Flaherty of

of causing her thoughts to stray often TO

for having lost the only equal com panionship p

was no Mrs, Daily near to look uisapProving

good deal of gossip reached her about the
say ings and doings of Mr.. Thornley,, the Eng
lish gentleman, relative of Sir Charles Pei

| manage Mr.. Daly's affairs in his absence, and
who with his sister had taken up his abode at
Castle Daily. The accounts reached her filtered
through the prejudices and colored by the

II Annes consciencs occasionally pricked


her for having allowed herself to become a

Mr., DAILY made her take q turn OF two up aud
down the terrace before the house while the

did not again attempt to discuss the wisdom or

To his approaching departure. His mind was
full of the incidents OF the morning when he
had been into Ballyowen with his sons To at
tend the tr ial and procure the release OF the
prisoners who had been committed for stealing
Pelham's dog.


He was beut on learning the impression that
Pelham's looks had made on Anne, and taking

were both summoned Witnesses, Pelham to

N,te of E. G. Burnite, 800
Note at Union Nation Bank, 20 600
Sundry debts contracted by the
last City Council, and which
must bs met by another note
of about 10000
.. Total foating debt, $71 800
"" "" and funded debt, / ,2y4, ,45O
With regard to the sundry debts enum-
Grated in the list of floating debts and set
down as about $4,000, it will be neces-
sary for the Council at this present meet
ing to have ,ote discounted, in order to
raise funds for their payment, as there is
| not, to-day, a single dollars to our credit
in any bank of the city; but ON the con-
trary the city's account is overdrawn to
the amount of S51.44. At this point, for
the purpose of comparison, we invite
your attention 10 the floating debt of the
city one year ago, when the City Council
who preceded us entered their admins
tration of our city affairs:


Balance in bank to the credit
of the city, Sept. l., 1877, S58. .4o5 a
Floating debt, (P. Qugley's
note, $50 900, and L. G. Bur-
mites, 81 800 81 800 90
Balance in favor of city, S26 1876 ""a
1t will be observed upon a comparison
OF JneSe Two statements that the City
Council which came into power Sept. 1,
1877, did so with a balance in hand
amounting to 6,995 ""A. They admins.
tered the affairs of this city for one year
and during that period they have man
aged to expend that balance, and have
increased the floating debt of this city
from S31 800 to ST. 800. They have
nearly exhausted the appropriations for
the current year, with four months yet
remaining. They have exhausted the
City Treasury, and your honorable body
must commence your administration
with the passage of an extraordinary
20 carry on the government. Summed
up as follows:


Sept. l, 1877-Bal. in bank, $26 1896 ""a
Increase of floating debt from


Sept l, 1877, TO Sept l, 1873, 10000 90


$66, ,995 ""a


Add to this the amount of appropria-
tions for this year which have been ex-
pended, and you will have some idea of
the cost of running our city government
from from Sept l, 1877, to Sept. l, 1873 ""a
period of one year


The following appropriations are over
drawn, with four months of the year vet
remaining: Water Works, Sewers, Re-
pairing aud Cleaning Streets. Incidert tai
and Miscellaneous and Opening and
Grading streets.


1t is true that much of the exr enditures
of the preceding Council have been for
necessary improvements to The city. call
ed for by our natural growth but while
such is true 1t is equally the fact that
much has been recklessly and laylshly
spent where no real necessity existed.
At this date it would be impossible to
give an itemized account of the expendi-
lures, but such will be forthcoming in
January next, in accordance with city
charter, and we owe it to the taxpayers
of this city that this report shall be in
the utmost degree specific. This is rather
a bad state of affairs for the present
Council 70 commence business with in
stead of having large surplus fund to
the credit of the city in bank, to meet
current expenses, we commence desper-
ately in debt, and that after tie bulk of
the city and school taxes for this year
have been paid.


The present Council will have to run
the city from now until next July on
borrowed MONEY, there being no reve-
nue. but that which will be derived from
the Water Department, the small
amounts of taxes yet nncollected, and a
small amount of rents from city prop
erty.


IuG DtODl6 VI w tApotb
much from the City Council now about
adm inst ,ring hit ir affairs for the ensuing
year. The task set before us Is one f
large proportions. We must set to work
earnestly to do our duty. A thoroue h
reform of our city management is i'm
peratively demanded. Useless offices
must be abolished, salaries must b. re-
duced to reasonable rates, economy
must rule in all the departments. In
fact we must apply the rules to the con-
duct our of municipal affairs which each
one of us would deem necessary in the
management of his private business.
Should we fail to do this it is only a
question of time until our municipal at
fairs shall be over-burdened with the
double curse of heavy debt and oppress-
i've taxation.

the club to order, and the following resolu-

he opd, That We the Democratic Club

tended that the sentiments and wishes Of
the people were TO be more eminently in
huential in the selection Of q standard
bearer for the Republican party in 1880
than at any previous period. The masses
have trusted more TO leaders heretofore than
they will in the ensuing campaign, for the
reason that they feel sensible that the cause
Of human rights and American citizenship
has been somewhat lost sight of,
and that great and grievous wrongs
have been perpetrated under an i'm
munity that cannot be endured. For
this reason we anticipate that tho choice of
a leader will become so apparent through
out the country before the holding of the
Republican National Convention that its
action will be only that of acquiescence in
and confirmation of the popular judgment.
Whether that selection is to be named
among those who have attracted public
attention already, time and opportunity will
determine; but, be the selection what it
may, 1t will be made under circumstances
to insure certain victory. The people
have determined to conserve the Govern
ment and the rights Of citizenship in the
result of the next Presidential election.


THE BLINDNEss OF CONSERVATISM.


The Lynchburg ITrgiaian interposes the
felon's plea of mot guilty to the allega-
tions We have made relating to its conduct
on the question Of Southern outrages upon
the rights Of citizenship. II is but little
more than year since we have had any
knowledge Of the TGginiaR and its peculiar
characteristics of conservatism on the Bour-
bon side, and only judge its character un-
der our almost daily personal observations
during that period If the TI6giaian has
even reproved the Savannah Recorder for its
atrocious comments upon the Presidents
message or has rebuked the lawless depre-
dations of the South upon the rights Of citi-
zenship; or the brutal assassinations and
murders for opinion sake, even in its own
State, as was the case in GOODIES district,
or in South Carolina, Mississippi, or Louis
lana, we have yet to notice it, aud If we
have overlooked any such instance, and the
IirgiHidn will reproduce it we shall take
great pleasure in giving il the full benefit of
that proof in defense of its plea of mot
guilty"" We should be glad to respect the
position and conduct of our contemporary,
and would be the last Intentionally to mis-
represent either but with the light we have,
drawn from Somewhat careful pcr,lsal of
its columns for n year, we think our several
allegations fully justified. II we do it in
justice, that fact can be easily established
by reproduction Of its own utterances
that we have overlooked or forgotten.


1t is not very adroit for the lirgiHian to
attempt TO frame screen for itself by
charging that THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN
"" is wholly incapable Of doing justice even
= to the chief Of its own party, when lie at
tcmpts 10 he just TO the South, for in this
1t only resorts 10 a subterfuge. We sup
ported and voted for President HAYES, and
while we have not had as much conf
dencc rs himself in the wisdom and benef-
ccncc of his implicit trust in the sincerity
and sense of justice of the Democratic
managers Of the South, prior to the last
elections, we think there is no difference
between us now on that point; and we
know that TnE REPUBLICAN has not
changed its position materially as to the
South and its policy of outlawry, injustice,
aud wrong within the last year. So that
screen which the IiyiHidn has set up for n
hiding place in this controversy is little

Ry REV. FATHER FARLEY.


Solemn high mass was celebrated in st. Patrick s
Cathedral in Mott street. half past ten O'Clock by
Rev. Father Lynch. In addition to the regular quar-
tet choir. led by the organst Mr. John White, there
was volunteer choir OF upward of hundred voices,
who are practising for grand to be given in
aid of the Cathedral. Rev. Father Farley preached.
the subject being the duty of praying for souls in
purgatory. He called attention TO the fact that the
LIST of the month All Saints Day and the I'd All
Souls Day and then went to say that II pre-
cious duty TO beg God to hasten the joys of the de-
parted Of which they are in the end certain. but
which can only be attained after long suffering. The
Church. in her anxiety for the souls of those gone
from this life had form directed that that day
not only every offered up should be for the souls
OF the departed, but that private prayers should be
offered up Also We are too apt to forget friends
when they are dead. Our memory of them is ~ a
rule, too short lived. Even those for whom
willing to make every sacrifice and every selfdenial
while living, when the grave closes over them too
often memory of them is buried in the same tomb.
The Church knows this, and she knows also that
need to be reminded that the Saviour is still ready
and able to save from worse than death, He
when He brought to life again the daughter OF the
ruler mentioned In the gospel Of the day. There
other reasons tender than this invitation
of the Church. Are not bound to these souls
either by ties OF friendship of kindred of justice
OF charity? Many OF them have shared past joys
and our past sorrows-parents. perhaps. who wept
with US in our sorrows and rejoiccd with in
joys. And all that they ask for their toilings
and anxieties for is the sacrifice of few minutes
daily OF that life which they the instruments of
bringing us into. Perhaps when they earth
we did not love them as tenderly. rs dearly,
should have loved them and, in consequence have
been stricken with remorse. But remember that in
death we aid them more etfectuay than while in
life, for our prayers for their souls assist in
fastening them to that JOY which snrpasseth under
standing


BOUND JUSTICE CHARITY.


We are bound in justice to those souls in purg-
atory, because many of them may be suffering for
sins caused by evil example. There are
more lives affected by example, more good or evil
have any idea Of. 1t may be that some
soul is suffering the pains of purgatory
because OF some words OF ours thoughtcssly spoken
or some action carelessly performed. We are bound
in charity, for while we know of deaths of many
doubt of their salvation. yet know Of many whose


lives were not what they should have becn and whose
death came sudden that there not moment

agony intense. Why should We not listen to their
cry of Distress? II ship in distress is the

then stand the shore of life and look out upon the
souls tossing on the of eternity and remain

the meaning of that article of the creed-the COM
munon OF saints. Father Farley quoted from several
OF the saints in proof of the existence or purgatory
and that the suerings of souls confined there could
be benefited by the prayers of those earth. He
also quoted from the words of the Council OF Trent
which held that not only the sacrifice of the mass
but prayers numerous deyotions, to many Of which
indulgences were attached, and even aims giving
were etiicacious. Think, he concluded, what a
sweet thought it is that the trfe OF aims which you
may give here to appease the hungry may purchase
for some soul in purgatory an admittance to the
celestial banquet OF God."

Demiseux. of Montreal. After the first gospel Bishop
Lynch addressed the congregation the dogma of the
Communion of Saints in connection with the HUasts
of All Saints and All Souls. celebrated on Friday
and Saturday respectively The doctrine of the Cath
olic Church inculcaed he said that shall be tried
by fire. and one Of its most cherished dogmas is that
it is holy and wholesome thought to pray for the
this doctrine of the communion of saints we have
incentive to persevere in good works and to be faith
full to- the end. We shall certainly have to
suffer, not here in this world, though
brethren have suffered much here in many
ways. There is suffering in running counter
fractions. There be exchange for mans saliva
ton, for the Scripture asks ""What doth it profit
man il he gain the whole world and lose his
soul p 1t is only he that to the end that
shall be saved. We should so strive that lives
may be full of faith OF piety and OF charity that
after death may not be severed from communion
with the saints. We should engage ourselves in the
practice Of every virtue and initiate the example of
the saints If expect to be admitted into commu-
Mon with them. Our lives must be continual war

The communion Of saints means companionship
with the blessed, reward for good deeds, share in
the prayers Of the faithful not only in this world but
only practise good work. but give good example to
neghbor, that may be found worthy in the sight
of Heaven to be admitted into the companonship of
the elect when our career in this world has ended."

WHAT is AN EXISTING FACT.


Application made yesterday to Judges Davis
Brady aud Ingalls,, at the General Term Of tho Su
r. y.
discharge from State Prison OF u convict named Carl
Lesser, undergoing an Imprisonment Of two years,
upon conviction for false pretences in tho Court OF
General Sessions at the last October Term con-
viction, as Is claimed, having been illegal. 1t sp-
poared upon the trial that upon the 9th of last Au
gust Lesser, in company with ono CHARLES Melville,
visited the fancy jewery store Of Zetta Geroges
that they asked for tho husband OF the lady and
told to call again the evening; that Lessor arrived
time. but said that Melville (who, he stated, do
sired to purchase goods) had gone the thea
tire; that appointment made for tho DAY fol-
lowing that both Lesser Melville mado their ap
pearance tho store agreed upon; that
goods amounting in valuo s255 woro pur-
chased; that in payment Melville gave a check
on the Chemical Bank, signed by A. +.
Steenbach Tor the amount; that Lesser who had
vile to be merchant having places OF business in
New YORK and Philadelphia, and also that the check,
which was dated DAY ahead, gooa. The check
turned out TO be worthless such person Sleen-

Judge Gildersleeve, who presided. refused and
viction followed. Upon the argument yesterday Mr..
kintzng SAID the Court below erred IN refusing to
direct The jury acqut In order to constitute the
crime OF obtaining property by false pretcnces two
things, he insisted, arc essential to be proved;
FIRST, false representation as 10 u past





that representation as true. No principle Of law, ho
contendsd is better settled than that ho false pre-
sence must be OF some present existing fact, and
Of some iuture event or mere premise. The check
given Tor the jewelry was post dated IL was to be
hOnored the day following It's delivery. Such
ence referrbie TO Iuture event and In the
oil promise that the cneck should be paid 1t Is
pretenco OF an existing TACT IL Is promise ana

direct and positive false assertion TO some exist
ing matter by which the victim Is induced to part
with his money or his properly. Any false repre-
Btntation complained o. whicn Is promiss0ry in its
nature, has never been held TO be the foundation OF
CRIMINAL charge. check to be paid in ''tuturc"" Is

The POrsiand Murder.


PORTLAND, Aug. 21st.-A mar
named VIM. Smith has made o
statement to the authorities here
concerning Jackson Grant who il
under arrest for the sassination o
Dennis Spellen. Smith says that
Grant was at his (Smith's) house
on the morning of the day on which
Spellen Is supposed to have been
murdered; that he had with him a
double. barrelled shot gun. Grant
told Smith that he was go-
ing out to have a hunt.
Smith told Grant that ii he got any
game, to come back to the city and
he would buy it. Grant went
away but did not return for several
days. After he came back Smith
and he had a talk, when the former
had occasion to mention the mur.
der of Spellen. Grant seemed
very uneasy and acted in such u
manner as aroused Smiths suspi.
cions, when the murder
was alluded to. Smith told
his wife to question Grant about
the matter, and if possible to draw
the truth from him. This Mrs.
Smith did and succeeded in Undue.
ing Grant to confess the murder.
He said that he had killed Den.
mis- Spellen by shooting him
in the back, his object being to get
possession of the money belonging
to the man. Grant admitted that
he only obtained Sis. Smith says
he could scarcely believe that Grant
had committed the fearful deed
aud took no steps to lave him ar
rested. Soon after Grants wife
visited Smiths family and she too
said her husband had confessed the
crime to her aud had given her a
portion Of the money taken from
Spellen. When Grant visited
Smiths house after he escaped from
Gervis lie informed the police of
the fugiiive's whereabouts and
made the charge against him.


a BoId Robbery Ia Portland.


PORTLAND, Aug. 2l.-At nine
o'clock yesterday morning three
strangers entered the pawn-broker
shop of M. Osher, Washington
street, felled the proprietor with
slung-shot, locked the door, packed
up the jewelry and valuables and
escaped by the rear entrance, pass
ing through a dry goods store to
First street. An alarm was given
and an officer pursued the robbers.
At the corner ofThird and Morrison
streets they fired two shots at the
officer, missing him, but instantly
killing Louis Joseph, aged IA.
The robbers then jumped into an
express wagon, drove to the out
skirts of the city and made for the
timber. Pursuit was at once organ
ized, but thus far without success.
If captured, they will undoubtedly
be lynched in the prevailing excite.
ment. Oshel's injuries are con-
sidered fatal. An alarm has been
given in all directions and the
capture of the murderers is consid-
cred certain. The amount of plum
der obtained is as yet unknown.

THE REPUBLICAN, MAYoRALTY CANVASS
SATURDAYS NOMINATION ELBcTIoN.",,"THE REPUBLICAN MAYoRALTY CANVASS
SATURDAYS NOMINATION ELECTION.
The Republican meeting on Saturday
evening last was not only the opening of


the city canvass by the Republican, but
was the preliminary skirmish of the
great contest for the mayoralty nomina-
ton, between the adherents of Messrs


Gallagher, Patterson and Fraim. The


withdrawal of Capt. Macalister, which


appears to have been secured by the
very convenient extension of the term of
City Solicitor to three years, and his re-
election to the office, narrows, the con-
test considerably, and inspires the on
ponents of Capt Gallagher with the
hope that they will now be able to de-
feat him. With them it is ""anything to


beat Gallagher"" and for this great OBJ
ject they will doubtless concentrate
their forces upon John g. Patterson,
ESD, as the most available candidate for
the purpose.


The first meeting on Saturday evening
last, was neatly captured by the Gallagh-
er opponents, and they did not leave the
doughty captain the ghost of chance
Tor good show on the City Executive
Committee which is to be appointed His
followers at the meeting made no special
effort in his behalf, for the reason, as one
OF them stated, if they succeeded in car
rylng their points the cry would 90 out
that the meeting was packed in the in
terest of Gallagher; therefore they con
ciuded to let the opposition run that
part OF the machine without any consi-
derable objection.


The next meeting will be held on Sa-
turday evening, when City Executive
Committee will be appointed Great in
terest centres in this meeting, as the com
mittee appointed to nominate an Execu-
i've Committee contains only one of
captain Gallaghers expressed friends,
and will doubtless report an Executive
Committee of the same complexion. I'm
less the Captains friends succeed in can
turing this meeting he will stand a poor
show as far as Executive Committee is
concerned.

were filed with the murder record. Muir
ders of all the standard varieties were in
cluded in the chronicle-and there were
some recitals of extreme acknowledgements
bly, that Of the hanging of q man who had
murdered thirty odd persons and the lynch
ing of five negroes for offences against
women. Only thorough study of the
statistics Of crime can determine
numerous year by year than they were fer
merly, or whether we have our murders for
a given period in a few groups, with inter-
vals of quiet; but in so far as general i'm
pressions on the subject may be trusted,
the murders reported are two or three
to one against earlier periods, and
there are no intervals. What are the
causes for all these bloody indul-
gences of cupidity, revenge or other
passions Immunity for murderers is one
cause, an entire loss of religious convic-
tions in great part of the social mass is
another cause, and a third is the failure of
society to discriminate against families
prone to take violent steps in differences
with their neighbors. Under our system Of
Jurisprudence Justice is SO enormously
handicapped in a conflict with murderer
that she has no chance, and the murderer
who sees his way clear to cheat the
gallows will laugh at the terrors of
the world to come; SO that he can
be restrained neither by considerations of
discomforts in another world nor danger
in this. Our philanthropy, our tenderness
tor the lives of cutthroats, the favors of
the law toward them, all these deprive So
ciety of an advantage it had under
harsher system, and which was perhaps of
great importance when everybody was
hanged who had unjustifably killed
another-and hanged without regard to
sanity-the natural selection"" of the
times was against the numbering classes.
Now it is against the classes that supply
victims, and we are so far cultivating race
of men prone to murder."

was Street Commissioner. Tweed who was Deputy, as

until Cornell had been succeeded by Tweed himself,
der tie new title OF Commissioner OF Public Works,
Brennan by Richard b. Connolly, Controller, and
Hoffman by A. Oakley Hall, Mayor, that the schemes
! for plumber were developed. Mclean was in it for a
time but soon dropped out.

pleted last night in City Council. They
ere more than ordinarily. good.
John Guthrie, at the head Of the Finance
Committee, is most fitting selection-he
is careful business man, Of manifest ln'
tegrity, and as such gives the best possible
security that he will wisely manage the
m onies of the city.


The practical sagacity, and far reaching
experience of Lewis Paynter, as chairman
Of the Water Committee, ensures a wise
economical and honest direction of that
important part Of our municipal interests
Than VIM. 3. Norton, an upright, and
intelligent man Of the people, who is as
incapable of guile as he is of injustice
there could be no better choice as head of
the Committee on Printing, he will lcok
after the we'll being of the tax payers in
all matters connected with printing.
James McGlinchey, Of the Third ward,
is chairman of the con- mittee in charge Of
the opening Of streets. Citizens may bs
quite certain that his well known charao-
ter for justice, economy and impartiallty
will not fail to influence him in his pres
ent trust.


The selection of Benjamin F. Town.
send, as head of The committee in charge
of the streets, was wise. His ability to
manage men, and direct large work, fits
him prominently for his place.
The Public Building Committee is Off
cercd by Robert H. Taylor. We know Of
few men more conversant with our mu.
nicipal affairs than he, and we can assure
our citizens that whatever we'll ordered
knowledge of his duties, linked to an I'M
flinchng desire to be right, can accom-.
plish, will be done.


The young and handsome Maxwell has
the Police Committee under his direc1ion
this is well. He has The look of one who
can properly advise and counsel that bu-
reau, and VIC may look for reforms in it
reforms sadly wanted.


Mr. Rowe, of the Ninth ward, new
member, is at the head of the Committee
on Accounts. He is man gifted with
great good sense, marked intelligence and
""as honest as the SUM-"" There will be no
crookedness in his department,
Leuis P. Lynch is at the head Of the"

known goodness of Mr.. Lynch's heart, ever
ready for the sick and needy, is strong evil
dence that lie is the right man in the right
place.


Peter B. Heusted, who beat the redoubt-
able Tom johnson, Of the First ward, has
the Lamp Committee in charge. He is an
honest, reputable and substantial business
man, and will see to it, that the city is
properly lighted, or he will know why.


Mr. knight, of the Ninth ward, is
chairman Of the Committee on Education.
A man of the people, deeply interested in
the cause Of education; Of pure and exalted
character, lie may be safely trusted with
the delicate duties given him to perform.


Last, but by no means least, looms up
Alexander J. Hart, as chairman of the
Committee on Bonds. He is largely en-
gagged in trade, and although this is his
first charge of public affairs, his large ex,
perience as a man of business, and we'll at
tested honesty, guarantees that he will sed.
ulously guard the interests of the taxpay>
ers.


The gentlemen named are all Democrats,
as the dominant party in Coulcil, being
responsible for the direction of municipal
affairs, they wisely put the trust in the
hands Of their own men. TIL, Republi>
can members of the various committees are
we'll known, and upright citizens, and we
are quite certain will second the endeavors
of their chief to carry the city through
these irving times."

HOW EDGAR FREEMAN ESCAPED DEATH


AT THE HANDS OF THE NOR",,"HOW EDGAR FREEMAN ESCAPED DEATH


AT THE HANDS OF THE MOB,


A correspondent at New Haven, Conn.
describes in detail the treatment by the
Ansonia mob of Edgar Freeman. t6ecoI.
ored man arrested for assaultipp a little
white girl, The correspondent saws;


freeman said nothing until he reached
his cell in the village lookup, when he
asked why he had been arrested He was
told, and in reply he sad ""Jim Drake did
IT,"" lie was locked up to await a hear
ing this afternoon.


Jennie's fathers fellow-workmen, how
ever could moi let him rest. Early this
morning they gathered n an angry crowd
around the lookup. One Of them said
That Fieeman's greatest punishment
could be only Imprisonment for life.-
ms statement was like spark which
nres a mine. At onces cries of ""Thats
not enough"" Chang him. and ""Kin
him."" arose. Near these madmen was
Grand Juror Timothy Sullivan, with the
KEYS of the lookup in his pocket. Sud-
denly, he was knocked down, and his
Keys taken from his pocket. The mob
rushed to the door, opened it, and in a
moment Freeman, screaming in terror,
was dragged into the street. Constable
Castle and Judge Peck tried to save him,
but their efforts were greeted by jeers,
and stone hit Peck in the head and
Knocked him down. A new rope was
wound around Freeman's neck, a hum
dred grabbed the long end, and one sat
on his back holding the short end. In this
condition he was dragged through the
stony street until he reached the bridge
| over the Nagatuck. Here a moose was
made, and they prepared to hang him to
q bridge beam, but some one cried, ""Take
Ia mn, 10, Hnlh ,t. a 4. Ii
front of the barn"" This cry saved his
| lite, for they listened to it and dragged
him further. The blood flowed freely
from his many wounds. Up the steep
hill to where his employer lived they
pulled him, and when they stopped to get
breath he lay like a dead man. Once the
| rope tghtened on his throat, and he
threw up bis arms and groaned. At last
they reached the trees where he was to
hang, but the officers had followed them

private parties, ErGt4sgv st. ss7.y ~
Mr.. McGlinchey took . position opposed
to the report, saying that even were the
street obstructed, it was the duty Of the
City to keep the streets open, and hence the
city was responsible, and were the city not

property were the ones to whom Mr.. Meyer
was to look.

DEAR SIR In obedience to resolution

whether or not the City Council have the

Mr.. McGlinchey said that while this was
before the Council, he desired to make an
Explanation. He had no intention to make
q political point and did 1t with an idea at
retrenchment. '


Mr.. Chandler arose and said that the
matter OF reducing the number of surveyors
was certainly unwise, and any person who
paid any attention to that department could
see that the present number OF surveyors
employed was almost inadequate. -.


Mr.. McGlinchey called Mr.. Chandler to
order and said he was not speaking to the
question. ,.r..,. ...~ sa-..t.


Mr., Chandler took his seat and several


members supported him in bis statement


The Street Commissioner submitted q re-
port in answer to Mr.. McGl!nchey's resolu>

for information concerning ditch dug on


the east side of Christiana avenue during
the past summer. The report stated that
the whole number OF men employed was
25 and the total amouHt expended was
$3.50 II. The report also showed that the


work was done on the order of 2. Chandler
who at that time was chairman of the Open,
ing Street COMMITTEE.


\ On motion of Mr.. McGlinchey the reporG
was accepted.
Mr.. Townsend presented a petition from
Charles Cannon asking to have lamp at

 Dispatches from all points show that the storm of yesterday was the most violent experienced for years. The storm came from the tropics, and from midnight to noon it rapidly in- creased in energy. It was central near Bangor, Maine, and was attend ed with an unusually heavy rain fall. At Washington the fall was 3.54, at Baltimore 2.74, Norfolk 2.S4, Lynch burg 2.01, and at Smithvillc, \. C., 43l. At Baltimore the property along the wharves suffered much, and dis asters on the bay are feared. Along the line of the Philadelphia, Wash ington and Baltimore railroad the loss is serious. The storm was very severe on Long Island sound and along the New England cOlst, and the lighter crafts were terribly ham, mered.

at Huntsville, Ala. Returning in 1860, he
settled at Lewisburg, Union county ,serv-

sylvania volunteers during the emergen-
cies of 1928. In 1869 he was elected to
the lower house of the Legislature, and
the following year to the Senate, receiv.

ahvely brief, his political career has
been a brilliant one, and he has won the

the Srague case was steadily work
ing away at bolstering up the testi-
mony of their witnesses. A. d.

attending the sale OF
Browns place and the disappear
ance Of the notes given for it by
Willoughby. Barnard stated that
he managed the transaction and
had the notes assigned to w. A..
of Oakland, for no consid-
Grafton, to prevent Browns
creditors from annoying him. He
thought Browns place worth $4,000
with good title; went with de-
tective Hall to see Brown and drew
the notes VIII ich he received for the
land. The prosecution then at
tempted to account for the myste-
rious wagon load of men seen by
different parties on the night of the
going towards the More
ranch in the evening and coming
from that direction before day light.
For this purpose s. Cohen was
called and testified that he had TAX

ton from that sworn to by the wit

Yesterdays storm caused the creates
destruction and alarm, that have evel
been experienced. Houses were blown
down, and unroofed, trees hurled to
the ground, shutters and windows
blown of, chimneys, awnings and signs
mutilated.
| The brick stable at Shaw's mills was
blown of at the Second story; Mr.. Gala.
hans new brick stable was blow n dow n
and many more OF which we have re-
ceived no definite information. Four
Of the houses on the upper part Of Mar
ket street, were carried:fully mile
and half in land by the sudden rise
Of the river.


The banks we're broken all along the
river front, and the whole country for
miles around was inundated. Tasker's 5
Bank suffered the severest Of all.
the water driving the employees from
their avocations.


The worst part Of the storm was be-
tween s and 8 A. NJ, when the Woolen
Mill caught fire, and in one hour was
one mass of ruins.


The Mill had just started up few
minutes before the fire was discovered,
and the greatest excitement prevailed
among the girls employed there. Sever
al of them jumped through the End
story windows, and sustained very
serious injuries. Three girls fell out
ofa window about 8 feet from the
ground and were severely cut. The
fire rapidly gained headway, as the
water from the hose was not played on
the fire, and tie only thing that could
be done was to save the surrounding
property.


The next place our attention was
turned, was the sudden overflow of
Water street. Nearly all the residents
along this street, had their cellars and
back yards filed with lumber.


The tug boat Jas. McFadden, was
sunk early in the morning at the R. R.
wharf.


The propeller Clio, from Odessa, ran
aground on the beach at the Battery
and stove her gunwala in. 1t will re
quire several hundred dollars to Sc
her afioat again.


The number of small boats that were
mashed up is almost impossible to tell.


A coal barge unloading at Jeferson's
Wharf, was shattered into atoms.


Several more were in the same plight
some being washed high and dry in the
back ards of residents on Water street.


Towards noon the storm began to
abate, and then began the work Of
clearing up the debris and pumping
out cellars. This work will continue
or some days to come.


Every Que remarked that no such ex-
element prevailed for one day in New
Castle before.


In the evening We came very near
having another fire caused by the care
lessness of little boy by the name of
Lynch; he was in Lechler's after oil
and held the lamp too near the can,
when the oil exploded and in an ir-
slant young Lynch was one sheet of
flames; he rushed across the street to
his home and his mother threw two
shawls around him and smothered the
fire, the back of his neck and ears were
burned to crisp.


The fire company run the hose car
riage out supposing the building was
on fire, but the fire happened to confne
itself only to the porch, and was very
soon put out.


FROM RANGE R LIGHTHOUSE.


October 23rd, lS7S.-Six vessels on
shore in the fields, one large sloop
lays in the county road at Mrs. Cooks
bridge. Schooner Corrv, Captain Ray,
was dragged from Salem creek loaded
with hay, lays in the bushes Just in
front Of the light house. The schooner
Chambers sailed across the bank into
the road and up in Mr.. Nivin's field;
they tied it to tree for two or three
hoars, hosting sail they sailed back
across Mr.. Ayers wheat field and cross
ed the road the second time, and took
upon the bank where she now lays; the
tide in the meantime had fallen ""a or 3
feet. The destruction above New Cas-
tie hear is very great. Big boats,
little boats and steam tugs, hear are
ashore and boat seems to be sunk out
in the river, can't tell her name. Some
Of the boats have gone to pieces on Fort
Delaware.


Mr.. Nivins' barn and Mr.. Ayers car

down.

Mr.. Price called the attention of Coun-
Gil to the effects of the late storm upon
the school houses in the city. He stat.
ed that the Board had no funds availa-
BILE for the repairs Of such damages, aud
the law as now constituted not only
made no provision for such expenses
but gave the Board no authority to do
so. He thought that under the circum-
stance the City Council should do some
thing for the relief Of the Board. He
saw present Mr.. Eckel President of the
Board Of Education, and on his motion
Mr.. Eckel was invited to address Coun-
Gil upon the subject.


Mr.. Eckel coming forward, thanked
the Council for the courtesy extended
to him, and spoke of the disastrous ef-
fects of the storm upon the public
school buildings. No. he stated had
been entirely unroofed, and Nos. 10
and II partially unroofed. The esti-
mated cost of the repairs caused by the
storm he thought would be Sl036
which amount might possibly be in
creased by some damages not yet re.
ported. He referred to the wise pro-
visions of the law which guarded both
tha Roard nf Education and tho Civ
Council from creating unnecessary ex-
penses, and he complimented the Coun.
Gil upon the pleasant and friendly re-
lations which had existed between
them for the last two years.


The Board had a sufficiency Of funds
to meet their ordinary expenses for the
current year but they were totally un.
prepared to meet these last unlocked for
and being debarred by law
from raising money on their own re-
sponsibility they had on other resou @.
than to apply to the City Council for
relief. Mr.. Eckel said that the Board
looked to the City Council for help in
the emergency, and without such help
some of the schools would have to close.


The address of Mr.. Eckel was well
and after some discussion be-
tween Messrs. Chandler, Paynter, Nor
ton, McGlinchy and Taylor, the follow
ing resolution offered by Mr.. Chandler
was unanimously adopted. Mr.. Lynch
that it was no use hesita
ting because the schools had to be kept
open no matter what it would cost:


Resolved, That the Law Committee confer
with the City Solicitor to ascertain the right
Of the Council to extend relief and present
an ordinance Mt the next meeting of Council.


On motion of Mr.. Lynch the Commit

THERE was clever sprinkling of peaches
in Philadelphia yesterday, mostly from the
lower part of the State, and were selling |
at 81 to $3.50 basket.


TOMATOES and corn are getting more
plentiful, the former at 25 cents per basket
and the latter at Is cents per dozen, other
vegetables are abundant. Berries are most
out of market.


THE colored people connected with the
Bethel A. M. E. church of this town, have
chartered the steamer Artisan for the pur
pose of running an excursion to Cape May
from Clayton on Saturday next.


LEG BRoKEN.-Dr. Collins found on Mon
day morning the hind leg of one of his horses
broken just below the knee. A wound
indicated q severe blow from the kick of
horse or something else. He had to be
killed.


BY adv. it will be seen that G. w. g. S.
Taylor are again in the field with their
wheat drills-the ""farmers favorate' and
""Champion."" They could not last year
supply the demand and the prospect is
for another large run this year.


WE are authorized to state that the
Blackbird Camp proper will break on
Saturday, but that the most of the tent
holders desire to remain over until Monday
and arrangements have been made to that
effect. Preachers have been secured and
regular services will be held on Sunday.


DRowNED.-A boy named Joseph Wye,
aged Is years, fell off the pier at Fraland
beach on Wednesday last and was drowned.
He was from Philadelphia and had come
down that day on an excursion. The pier
at the place where the accident occurred
has only two planks for passage and is es-
sentially dangerous for young people.
| STATE FAIR AT DovER.-We call the atten-
ton of our farmers who have fine stock,
grain, vegetables, &C., and to the ladies who
| have choice articles of handywork, preserv-
| ing, &C., to the advertisement Of the State
| Fair in another column. 1t will be seen
that they offer premiums to the amount of
| $4,000. They want every one to send their
| best.


! THE Clyde is by far the largest, hand
soonest and fastest boat ever on the Bonn
bay Hook route. Her apartments are
complete in every particular and the trip
on her to Philadelphia besides being very
cheap is rendered attractive by the pleasant
company usually aboard, by the music and
by the excellent supper furnished by the
steward, Mr.. w. r. Cassart.


HEAVY RAIN.-The drought that was
beginning to tell on the early corn was en-
ded on Tuesday by an exceedingly heavy
fall of rain, submurging the low grounds
and making heavy washes in the roads.


Fortunately, there was no wind, and as the


farmer delights in a good ""mud RAIN


about the first of August to insure his corn


crop, he is complacent over the result.


NEW MILK PAN.-Edward Ward of oul


town has invented a milk pan that prom


ses to be great saving of labor TO the dairy


maid He claims for it that he can


separate 20 pans of milk from the cream in


ten minutes. The improvement is very


simple. 1t consists in inserting a ! inch


gauze wire in a tube at the bottom rim anC


when it is wanted to skim, 10y removing


cork the milk is drawn off into another


vessel leaving the cream remain.


MILL RACE BRoKEN.-During the heavy


rain of Monday night, or rather Tuesday


morning the volumn of water which rushed


down main street from the town into the


race of Sharp's mill, caused it to burst the


bank making fissure about eighteen fee


wide and from eight to ten deep. The


race gates lowered at night had cut of


the connection with the pond and as i


was intended for the cutters to empty int


the latter, a danger from this source wa


the least thing expected.


VIsIToRs TO SMYRNA.-Since last Wednes


we have obtained the following list of visi
. tors, most of whom have come to tow


since that date-former Smyrnians in frs
, paragraph:


Miss Annie Spruance, Miss Ella Crow


John Allen, John A. Cavender, Geo. i

THE BLACKBIRD CAMP was very largely al
tended on Sunday, in fact more SO than a
any former meeting-numbers coming
distance of fifteen or twenty miles. Th
roads were exceedingly dusty, and man
as they returned through the town in tn
evening, looked as if they had come out @
, a bull fight. The order is represented a
2 good, the meetings, to those who went fo
that purpose, attractive and beneficial, an
for those who went simply to see and b
seen, all they desired save the dust.
Rev. j. II. Wiley, of Townsend, preach
ed in the morning, Rev. T. Z. MartindalC
e of Middletown in the afternoon, and Rev


Thomas f, Newman, from near Baltimore
"" (who travelled Smyrna Circuit about twent
five years ago) in the evening. On Monda
the meetings were characterized by tn
old methodistic fire, but the subsequer
= heavy rains must have considerabl
q dampened the order.

MEssRs. EDIToRs:-The following is


detail Of my southern trip:


! left Philadelphia on November IL
at l.30 p. NJ, on q southern trip, &C
companied by Commodore Dunlap, an,
We arrived In Baltimore the following


morning, and proceeded from there i


Washington, whsr. We remained day
and visited the White House, Paten
Office, Capitol and all the Public Build
ings. While stood in the Capitol


was perfectly amazed. 1t cams to m,
mind II Congress was only in session,
could hear the voices Of Thoma' y
Bayard and James g. Blaine, the tw,
noblest statesmen of the country. AL
though our State is small, ! cannot bu
do justice TO the Hon. Thomas +. Bay
ard, who represents our little State in
the United States Senate -m


We proceeded from Washington Il
Alexandria, Va. There made the &C
quaintance Of the Rev. Mr.. Cook, a col
ored Baptist minister, who told me- tha
Baptism Is on the increase among tn,
colored people Of that section Of tn,
country. and that the colorsd children
are going to school and are learning
very rapidly. In regard to politics
some Of the colored fellows can br bought
at very low figures but this is among
the lower and ignorant class. Aftel
leaving Alexandria proceeded to Har
per's Ferry, situated at the foot OF the
Blue Ridge, where ] saw some Of the
finest scenery in the United States.


| visited and took from the roof o
John Browns fort shingle. The fort
is situated at the foot of the Blu.
Ridge Mountains and is a small two
story Brick building, about two hun.
dred yards from the depot and has an
inscription on II which is as follows;
John Browns fort"" proceeded from
there to Martinsburg, Va. They were
holding municipal election there
When We arrived at the depot We saw
a crowd of about two thousand people.
As Commodore Du llap and Higgins
German Laundry soap is so popular in
that section of the country, thought
the mob turned ont to meet him, and az
! stepped from the platform of the car,
baggage in hand, the crowd commenced
tocry out here he is! here he Isl was
about returning the salute, but was
stopped by the colorsd porter Of the Ho.
tel, who qnickly invited me into the
hotel coach and he then informed me
that the populace were looking for a
colored man who was supposed to be on
the same train whom they were going
to lynch. ! quickly called for the Com
modore to be seated and told the porter
to make all possible haste to the hotel
We arrived at the Hotel and was
shown to my room.


| returned from my room after leav
ing my baggage and there proceeded,
accompanied by the porter to the Jail,
where saw the crowd attempting to
overpower the Sheriff and batter in the
jail, but their efforts were unsuccess-
full. There met the Commodore and
the Sheriff's brother together; and the
Commodore advised me to return to tn.
Hotel and 60 to bed and that he would
stay and see it out, and that he would
inform me in the morning what had
transpired. About twelve o'clock the
crowd r-assembled, over two thousand
strong, overpowered the Sheriff. took
the prisoner out, dragged him to the
rail road bridge and hung him. The
Commodore got astray from tn. Sher-
IFS brother in the confusion and got on
the wrong road, when hs was taken by
some Of the mob for q government de-
tective. But after explaining to the
msb that he was the man who had the
Higgins German Laundry Soap team
in that place last spring, he was allow
ed To proceed to the hotel without mo-
lestation.


As the Commodore is on of the greatest
and quickest rail road travellers on re-
cord, do not know where you will
hear from me next. EDWARD LEARY.

from the Lynchburg District, Hon. John
Randol ph Tucker, in his recent speech
onthe tariff, correctly argues that tariff
not for the revenue, but laying contribu-
ton, as the present tariff does, upon one
part of society to sustain the industries
OF another, is contrary to the spirit of the
Constltution-that it creates a privileg-
ed class to receive bountles derived from
the burdens imposed upon the great mass
OF the people. What was misnamed
protection operated as bounty to the
privileged class, and was as unjust as if
the bounty were paid directly out of the
treasury to that class. He showed that
while the revenue paid in duties on inn
ports was S130,0O0,000, it was probable
the people paid annually as a tribute to
the privileged class not less than $780,
OOO,OOU While the manufacturing classes
amounted TO % pr cent. of the whole
industrial population of the United States
the i6 per cent. were made to cbntri butte
to their benefit, and that the effect was a
vast increase in the wealth of the manu-
facturing classes compared with all other.
He showed that as manufacturing inter
ests were aggregated in the Northern
States, the West and the South were
| tributaries to Northern interests.


Mr.. Tucker concluded his speech with
| the following peroration | wish TO sup
press every feeling that by remembrance
l might revert to, and extend my hand
to every man upon this floor. We are
brothers of common race, co-heirs OF
an Inheritance of constitutional liberty,
| co-partners in common destiny and
| civilization. We have virgin continent


washed by oceans and permeated by
great channels of Interstate trade and a


virgin soil teaming with products which


Will feed the hungry world, clothe the
| naked world, and shelter the homeless


world.


| Oh, my brothers, have we not something
better for us to do do than indulge il


memories of the past? Let the dead bury


its dead. Forget the things behind and
reach the things before. Let us join to-
| gether, hand by hand, clasp our arms in


one common impulse, unite in fur


thering the progress, prosperity and
honor of our country and make it the


glory of the world and blessing to our
childrens children, for all generations.
Applause all over the III ouse.


Apart from the waste of war, great
deal of the aggregate wealth of the coun
| try is not lost 1t has simply changed


hands or nominal values. The shock o


the panic of 1873 was very severe, anC


the damage it infiicfed was widely ex


tended. But If the shock was great tn,


power of recuperation is also great. Ano


although the early stages of recovery
| nave Deeu SlOW, anu values Ieel tHe eHec
OF that Shatterlng of confidence which


was caused by the financial cataclysm o.
1873, the very slowness of the recovery
jaugurs well for the permanency of i


when it is reached. A return to the higi
prices of the war is not to be expected


for them, as after the war of 1872, every


thing was artiticially inflated, and, as i


did after the war of 1872, a strong reac
ton would have set in until values wer,


brought down to their proper standard
even if the crisis of 1873 had not occurr


ed. The crisis simply accelerated tn


shrinkage. To the extent of the differ
ence between the abnormal shrinkag


eaused by the panic and the norma


shrlnkage that would have been produd


ed by the reaction from war consumption


and prices we may expect the country Il
| recover, and that recovery would be thu
more speedy If Congress would leave of


tinkerng with the finances."

| TnG FLGHC OF SHE DUCHESS
| Fonr days had passed since Lesbia's drive t,
| L Ige's Edge, and Ellen was again at the Hol


low Watching by Anne o'F'laheIty's sick bed
There had been a change for the worse in th
| invalids state, and it was now only at rare in


tervals that she could bear conversation O.

sitting silent beside her, gazing at tho deal
| face that was beginning to take the appear


ance of an empty shell, from which the ami


mating spirit was gradually being withdrawn.
Ste had hardly any news of those she wat
| anxious about. Castle Daily and Eagles Edge


were both deserted. Mr.. Thornley, was in
| Dublin, and Lesbis and Mrs. DAILY were stay
ing at an hotel in Galway, seeing nothing OF
Pelham, and unable to get tidings of him, but
| preferring to wait Mr.. 1nornley's return in his

don for an hour or so his favorite seat on the
horse-block ia the stable yard, and going to
fetch them from Bafiyowen. 1t WAS difficult
! in these days to persuade him to stir from his
self,chosen post where, as he said, he was
ready to tske orders, "" hen tie turn of the ILL.,
ness came and his mistress sert for him. He
had not seen Miss OFlaherty for fortnight,
he pleaded, when Ellen came from the sick
room to argue the point with him, and there

WAS for letters, Ellen had not the heart dur

how the old obstinate deter clins tion to be.
heve only what he chose was passing out of
his set wooden face, leaving it wan aud weak,
with an imploring, frightened look in the eyes
such as child tnrrs to dark room is fears
to be forced to enter. Hs might be wanted on
q sudden soon, though not for the csrs, he
expected, and Ellen Thooght he had ss much
of one more word. DR.. Lynch, too, had absent
ed himself, without sending any explaps tiou
of his absence. There seemed no avenue by
which tidings could come, any more than if
the little riSulet that surrounded the house,
whose bubblings and ripplings were the chief
disturbers of the unusual silence, had sudden
iy swelled into a wide ocean, cutting the
household eff from the rest of the world.
ct as the days crept by, vague apprehension
OF what was going outside idid oozs into
the valley, and reached even as far as the
watchers by Anne's dying-bed. There were
whispers repeated fron one to another, and
faces that had hitherto only worn an expires.
sion of anxiety expectation began
to look dark. At last, one day one
room with a face swollen with crying,
aud on inquiry it came ont that she had boea
to chapel in a distant village, and some one
had told her that Murdock Malachy had been
shot in fight there had been down in the
SOUTH. That was all Ellen heard for twenty
four anxious hours. Then all at once every body
was talking; even Peter Lynch's tongue was
loosed, and men ard women came up to the
Lodge from the valley. and from the solitary
farms among the hills, to tell the news, of
which the sir was full and question Miss
Eileen, if she could explain u.dings that
seemed to have STAINED them. It was all over.
Smith OBrien had been taken prisoner, and
there had been 70 fighting at all, oaly tn
multi in which one or tgo Of the bows hsd
been shot, aDn tbo rest had ru way, leaving
the leaders to tGke care of themselves.

time, ano how would 1T prosperf The cause
was lost any how, and the police and Mr..
ORoone would have it all their own way in
the country, aud what would they do at all
Could Mss Eileen tell them, when Miss
J'Flaberty was dead, AID Mr.. Counor, and
every one that hoped for better times put out
of the wayf""


From these whispered con nfeyer cas Ellen tried
to gather at least the copsolng certainty that
there had b3en lit le bioodshCd, and sbe re-.
turned u her post by the sick BED to watch
for an interval OF conscousuess, when she
might fulfill her promise Of letting Annie
know all to the last. She would be able TO
joice heartily in tbis determination to ali her
fears, and would not share the blank surprise
and shame tie at troubled Ellen when she com.
pared the high expectations and purposes Of
which she had been told with this denouement,
and thought with b, tter grudging of the young
lives that had wrecked themselves in the mists
of 30 miserable delusion. On the evening of
the fifth day De- Lynch came into Anne's room
and proceeded to ask after her health and talk
to her nurses ss if there had been no break in
his visits. Anne opened her eyes at the sound
of his voice, and q look Of intelligence and
inquiry came back into her face

matter-of fact tone, ""but that there is bsttsr
end to all their folly than might have been ex-
pected; and thCss for whom you care most

Anne looked Satisfied; bat when his business
in the sick room ended, DR.. Lynch beck
onod Ellen to follow him out of the room, and
dread sezed her that there was worse to hear

1t hardly took minute for the two SEN
tences, and for the look between, that bound
two sonls 80 closely together that nothing cut
them. O'Roone rushed forward with frarti
oath, and ordered the march TO proceed in
stontly. Lesbia felt herself violently thrust
aside towaI do the edge of the road, and the min
ute after the cavslcade moved at q rapid pace;
and she was standing with her back against
a stone wall, rounded by little crowd of
| people whom the rapid movement of the march
had left behind. red cloaked old crone came
| up, threw her arms round her neck and kissed
| her, and bare footed, bare beaded girl fang

and bnsied in setting the rug about her feet,
and their voices followed ber with emphatic
blessings to the turn of the road that led Up

lean over on the cushion of the car, and, un-
observed, weep out her excitement and ques-
ton the strange new joy that, in spite of
anxioties, would send irresistible thtills
through her. ''IIim that you own"" Yes,

She used to imagine giving herself away some

how much better it was than any hiug she had

Her tears had been long since dried when
the car drove up to the house door ct Eagles
f lge, and she began to be afraid that she
should bring iEto the house face iucousist-
emily joyful with the purport of her visit.
| There was no one at hand TO take the car, and

On Sappa Greek occurred an outrage the
recital of which makes the blood run cold
The bowling demons came suddenly upor

were gathered up by the settles and buried


at Bowden, all of whom were known, and
nine unknown ones.

has been greater than was anticipated and
it is generally conceded that larger share of pros

about 1000 persons have passed in and out the
doors daily But 1000 were provided with free
tickets. there would remain about five thou

admission from twenty-five 10 fifty cents, at the ex

Is the following


The rather remarkable proposition Of
NJ. Lynch in the Wilmington papers Of
to-day Of course puts an end to discussion
ofanother game between the Quicksteps
and ourselves. We played q game here
for the championship and won it fairly;
but TO place our claim beyond eavil We
accepted Mr.. Lynch's challsge, supposins
the question Of superiority to be between
US and the nine he brought here. If he
admits that they were beaten here, and
wishes to play us with superior"" team,
we decline to consider the matter further.
Doubtless there are many mines in the
country thst can dispose of US very easily.
But If on the other hand he thinks the
men hs played the first game which would
have been victorious il they had beer
tsirly treated. why does be not show hi,
confidence BY putting them again ON tn.

There were fifty five applications; of

In conversation Mr.. Springer explained
his reasons for the course he took at
the close Of the May term OF court.
""The records';' he said, ""were public
property: but yet as he understood the
duties pertaining to his office he did
not think that he would be justified in
giving them for publication in the



The applications were published in the
papers of Wilmington last year and in
thereof the county was put
to an additional expense of between
three and four thousand dollars at The
May term of Court, paid to witnesses
'nbp1naed to testify against unlicensed
liquor dealers.


He thought that they had no right to
be published; and he would not give
them for publication unless by pub
lie order from the Court.


As that order was given last even.
ing, prior to adjournment, by their
Honors, he bowed in submission.


He stated that after the close of the
May term of Court he received note
signed by the Chief Justice, from tn.
but he looked upon that az a
request merely, and not as an official
order, and he felt bound by his official
obligations u refuse.


Having said this, he, with a self.
conscious air of one having relieved
himself of matter of weighty consid
,ration, returned to his duties, and we
silently departed."

How do you get there, by railroad

stream, in Il body, for a colony? If
so, what price and terms? Is it u

upon with the greatest favor.

Perryville, Ind, March l, 1878.


We shall pay little attention to
the order of these interrQgatious,
but shall answer them in SUBJ
stance.


First-It is impossible for us TO
say whether an Engineer or mer-
chant in any department would
succeed here. We have goodly
number of merchants in all lines of
business aud respectable corps of
Engineers. Los Angeles is fully
supplied with lawyers, doctors,
clerks and persons who make their
living other than by the sweat of
their brow. What this county
needs is intelligent men of capital
who can introduce manufacturing
industries, such as do not require
cheap fuel, which we have not got
and men of small means who UNI
derstand and love farming. 1t is
not a place, first and last, in our
opinion, for Il man without at least
u small capital.


Second-As near as we can judge,
the city of Los Angeles is place of
about sixteen thousand people.
The county probably contains
thirty five thousand souls. We do
not consider it extravagant to as
sumo that the former will contain"

bitter pangs to those who knew and loved her to see
that she was doomed. Gradually the destroyer did
its fatal work. less elastic became her STEP brighter

a stricken at the root, she Withered and died

the bridegroom. There was no shrinking in this
brave, bright young girl when the supreme moment
came. She welcomed the white-winged messenger
as friend that would bear her to fairer and better
land. When medicines were being administered to
alleviate her suffering she asked that nothing be
Jesus would come"" she remarked shortly before her
death, and then, soon after, with glimpses doubt
Of the other world opening , before her she she said

lovely or beautiful there than she was on earth.

This rejection OF cvilitits did not, however,
put an entire stop to intercourse. AS the anx'
ious months passed on, there wns an inevitable
drawing together and Increase OF intimacy
among all those whose business it was to take
measures to- alleviate tho dire misery that was
certain now to come. Anne O'FIaherty and
the Thornleys met pretty frequently through
the early autumn on public committees and ut

and paler since he came into the country, and
the sister looked anxious. One day, atter a
meeting at the house of the Protestant clergy

overheard NJ IS Thornley, complain to the clergy
mans wife of the weary length OF the hours

never found it hard to be alone in her life be-

thinking that her terrors had any fancy or ex.
aggeration in them-the danger was only too
real, Threatening letters were placed about
the premises, or thrust into the crevices of tho
doors and windows almost every night now /;
and she could not but think that the lonely
road by which her brother returned from 81
Iyowen to Castle DAILY was watched. The
evenings were tolerably light still, but what
would 1t be when the autumn closed In, with
the winter to follow 7 She confessed She
dreaded it.


Mr.. Thornley, here caught sight of Anno's
Mortified face, and made an imperlous sign of
silence to his sister. Anne Poncerrd over that

misjudged them. There was plenty of spirit
aye, and Of deep and delicate feeling too, con.
ceAled by those grey masks of faces Anne be

and after the cheering subsidized, he
said:


""BoYs I've only to say that you've
elected Mayor boy who was born and
raised among you, and who will try to
MI the position worthily and honestly""
Immense applause.


DIsoRDERLY CONDUCT.


When the crowd first assembled at Mr..
Almonds house bricks were thrown in
to it by several rascally negroes who
were concealed behind trees across the
street. The scoundrels were fercely
pursued and it would have gone hard
with them had they been caught. Some
negroes also threw stones at the process
sion as it passed Orange street.

that he would perform his duty honestly
and conscientiously, without regard to
the fear or favor of any man.

NEW YORK, July 30th.-The o
Stock Exchange was the scene of
renewed depression again to-day
aud the lowest point of the season
was touched. There was decline
of one half to four per cent. and,
temporarily, the market is greatly
demoralized. The unfavorable re-
ports about crops from the West,
the morning kilograms about
cloudy and rainy weather and the
vague rumors af1oat of quarrels
among operators, had a tendency
to deprsss prices, particularly for
Granger shares, which suffered d
most. Toward the close share
speculation was strong anfhigher
with sharp advance in prices.
The Improvements from the lowest
point ranged from ! to 4 and the
advance was well maintained. In
the final sales the upward move
ment was most marked in North
west, st. Paul, Western Union
and Trunk Line shares and some
of the large sellers during the
morning were buyers in the after
noon.

RALEIGH, N. O., Nov. %, 1873.


On the evening of November q an as
sault was made upon Miss NJ Martha John
son, the daughter of respectable far
mer in Boonhill township, Johnston
county, by negro. The assault was
most brutal. The negro went TO the house
about four o'clt ok in the afternoon D whom
no one was there but Miss johnson. and.
after first asking for a drink of water,
made improper advances to the Young
lady, who became very indignant. The
villain then seized the lone girl and at
tempted to force her. Her resistance
was determined. The negro drew
knife and threatened to murder her un-
less she would submit. He cut her twice
about the shoulders with the knife, and
then attempted 10 stab her in the breas' !,
which she prevented by seizng the knife,
by which her right hand was severely
wounded. During the scufiie the cries
of the young lady were heard by one of
the neighbors, and when he came to her
assistance the negro had almost succeed
ed in overpewering Miss Johhson. On
the arrival of the neighhor the negro fed
TRACKING AND ARREsTING THE cRIMI-


NAL.


News of the affair soon spread and a
vigilance committee was organized to
search for the criminal. Several negroes
were arrested by TIE committee ami car
ried before the lady but none were iden.
titled. The vigilance committee opesly
asserted their intention of lynching the
negro whenever the right one should be
caught. Yesterday large, very black
negro, named Crumel Atkinson, was ar.
cested in Oberlin, negro settlement
near this city on suspicion. He was taken
TO Johnston county and identified by
Miss johnson as her assailant He had
preliminary hearing befur the police
magistrate and was sent on to fail tc
await the action af the Grand Jury
Great excitement prevailed, and the Off
Ger had to summon pos 70 to his assist
ance to prevent the lyncbing of Atkin
SOD, who is now in Jail at Smithteld, tn.
county seat, and strong guard has beer
| placed there for the protection of til,

Not soul was found on board and 1t is

The suction is great and the schooner
being caught in it shot like rocket up
to the pump-house. Both building and
pump were completely wrecked, doing

Keokuk Special to Chicago Tribune.1


Sensations in connection with the bodv-
snatching case at Beacon follow one another
in rapid succession. The last one came to
the surface to-day, being nothing more or less
than small pox scare in the interest of
Mackey. Yesterday morning g. P. Gone, of
Oskalooso, whom Mackey has engaged to de-
fend him, arrived in this city. He tried to
prevail on the sheriff, who had come after
the prisoner, to leave him here few days,
as it was feared he would be lynched if taken
back now. Failing in this, he held a
lengthy interview with Mackey, spending an
hour or more in the cell with him. In the
afternoon Mackey was taken ill. In the
evening physician was called, who pro-
nounced it case of smallpox.
There was rattling among the dry
bones about the Jail, and Mackey
was hast'ed off home, and a guard placed
over him. To-day he succeeded in obtain
ing smallpox certificate, signed by three
physicians, and was by order of the board of
health removed to the pest house. The cir
cumstances connected with the case led the
city marshal to suspect that the pretended
small pox was ruse. So he went to work
to investigate the matter, and soon found
that. on Sunday, Cone, the attorney of
Mackey, had obtained preparation of some
Kind at one of our drug stores. The time
which he spent in the cell is supposed to
have been occupied in ""whitewashing'' his
client with this preparation, in order to pro-
duce the skin eruption which was afterwards
pronounced small pox. The marshal has
other evidence which leaves no reason to
doubt that it was preconcerted plan on the
part of Cone and Mackey, originating with
the latter, to get up a small pox scare, IN
order to delay his removal to Oskaloosa,
where the excitement still runs SO high that
fears are entertained that Mackey would be
lynched if taken there now. The sheriff re-
turned home this evening, and Mackey will
be allowed to remain here for the present.
He is under strong guard."

AND LYNCH HIM.


NASHVILLE %, 1873.


A Shelbyvllle special to the Nashville
american says Dennis Belor was lynched
near that town last night, hanging from
the same limb from which two negro
ravishers were swung in September, 1871.
Belor bad been living at Thompson
Creek neiehborhood for a year and lat
terly lived with Patrick Williams,
farmer. William Martin, Williams SON
ln-law, lived near the latter. Night be-
fore last Williams and Martin were alb
sent on deer hunt, and their wives
were left at home alone after night.


Belor went to the house of Martin with
pistol he told Mrs. Martin he had come
TO protect her from some rowdies and wo-
men of i'll fame who were prowling in
that vicinity. Mrs. Martin says she was
afraid of Belor, but as he insisted on stay
ing about the premises as a guard, and as
she had no chance of escape to her moth
er's house, she retired to bed with her
young baby. Toward morning Belor
forced entrance into her room to outrage
her person. She pleaded with him and
resisted for along time until she was so
exhausted that she could scarcely lift her
hand.


THE FlEND AT WORK.


Then the inhuman monster accom-
plsned lbs purpose, almost crushing tho
llfe from her Infant, which she had been
frantlcally holding to her breast in the
hope OF deterring the rutish beast from
his work, which he finally accomplished
only half an hour before day light, and
then he threatt ned to kill her if She told
a hf. R.fn
WilliamSs house Belor mounted one of
his best horses and went off to a neigh
bors two miles distant, and was helping
him to saw board timber when he was ar
rested AT nine O'Clock. Mrs. Martin
though nearly dead from the horrors of
the night, WAS able to give the alarm at
an carry hour, and ""A crowd of md ignaut
and excited citizens We're quickly on
Belor'S track and soon arrested him.


THE VILLAIN BEFORE A MAGIsTRATE


He was taken before ""A magistrate. and
besides Mrs. Martins own Statement the
proof against him was overwhelming -
By this time the excitement was intense
and 1t was with difficulty that cool-head-
ed citizens saved Belor from being lynch
ed at once. Meanwhile Martin, the hus-
band, had returned and was crazen over
the recital Of the outrage upon his wife,
and he was only prevented by force from
killing Belor on the spot. AT six o'clock
Constable Arnold aud five well armed
men started with Belor for the Shelby
vile Jan, twelve miles distant. By ad-
vice of cltizens he avoided all the more
public thorougnfares. After travelling
through the woods he succeeded in get
ting ust inside the corporate limits, near
the railroad depot, when ""A large crowd of
men, some of whom were disguised, sud
denly rushed OUT from behind the engine
house AID freight house and freight ears
aud IN twinkling the surprised officers
were overpowered.


THE PRISONER TAKEN BY A MOB.


The mob seized the prisoner and fired
a pistol rs signal, which was answered
by peculiar whistles from all parts of the
town. The clans at once gathered.
Mounted men rode up, Joined the party
and AL hurried away with Belor and
hanged him. All the streets of the town
had been plcketed by strange horsenen.
who allowed none to pass until Belor was
in their custody. The lynchers intended
that Belor should never reach the iail
Large numbers of Citizens from Sheibv-
Vile visited the sceue of the hanging
this morning. The cuprit was hanging
by a small halter rope and was strangled
to death, the rope having nearly buried
itself in one side of his neck.


SCENE AT THE FATAL TREE.


The body presented ghastly and re-
voting sight rs it swung in the morning
sunlight A black and swollen tongue
protruded from the mocking, hldeous
mouth. The deep blue eyes gazed pite-
ously through thin white rims of half
open lashes, while the hands and body
We're black and purple with stagnated
blood.

the hands OF persons unknown""


The swift AMI Just, Though lawless.
pu, i,hment of Belor may be charged TO
technlcalities and delay of the law. Belor
came into the Thompson Creek com

one ever knew. He refused to give any
INFORMATION about himself. He was five

rs KILLING NO MURDER,",,"The Superior Court of the Stat of Con-
necticut sat on Monday at Norwich in that
State, and in view of the epidemic nature
of crime there, the sentences of the Court
upon convicted felons are exceedingly
curious. Can 1t be that as the election ap-
proaches political petitions for mercy to
individuals are favorably received, to be
compensated for by services at the polls
Or were the convicted felons so eminently
respectable that the law had to be ten
derly executedt A Mr.. Goddard was exer-
cising the old common law right of chastis-
ing his wife with q rod no thicker than the
middle finger of the wife>beater's hand
q neighbor who was ignorant of the black
letter doctrine of the reports and Year
books, interfered and was slain for bis
mercy. This to the common mind looks
like murder, but the Connecticut bench
considered 1t venal offence, and deprived
Mr. Goddsrd Of his liberty for eighteen
months and 500 fine One Mallet, liquor
dealer was offended, because O tipsy Gus.
toner said his liquor tasted of the pump,
and in his dudgeon, kicked him out with
such violence that death sobered him the
next day; this looks, very like murder in the
second degree. We are at loss to know


what a, Connecticut jury found It. The
sentence upon Mallet for his plsyfulness,
was sixty days imprisonment and 5000 fine


!"" The leniency of the Court in measuring
put punishment contrasts strongly with the
prompttude and severity Of the mob that
undertook to lynch the negro Freeman in
the same county in the last week of Sep
tember. Perhaps it would be hardly fair to
attribute the fierce lawlessness in the latter
ease and the mild interpretat on of the law
In the other to the fact that the accused
before the mob was negro and the con-
yicted before the Court were white men.
Yet If the same cruelty had been shown to
b negro in Southern community and the
same light estimate set on human life by q
court, many Of our contemporaries would
seize the occasion for homily on the bar
barisn of Southern society. We are in
clined to think that q series of sentences
like those passed at Norwich on Monday
would 60 far towards justifying the intro
ductica from the South and West of short
and easy methods for dealing with crimi.
malls. When the administration of the law
becomes farce the most law-sbiding com.
munity may be tempted to tragic excessea
IN vindication of It's own security""


A little Delaware justice, whom convic-


ton is had, would be very likely to improve
the moral tone of Connecticut. tas.I"

the education of youth. and they be found in
every part of the habitablo globe. Their long
sable gown and peculiarly shaped white collar
is as familiar to the citizens of Cairo Singapore,
Hong Kong and Melbourne to those Of Rome Paris,

scarcely thirty years established in the United States
It's progress during this time has been almost miracu-
lous. In 1s4s Archbishop Hughes obtained
from the Superior General, Frare Philippe,
four members of the Brotherhood who opened o

hundred Brothers in the States and Canada residing
in the principal cities and educating upward Of fifty
thousand pupils in 120 parochia schools twenty fvo

| New YORK, Aug. 1O.-The Di.
rectors of the Pacific Mail Steam
ship Company considered to-day
the question of California freights.
The matter of a new contract with
the Union and Central Pacific
roads was referred to President
Babcock, with power to act. The
Union Pacific road has settled it's
accounts Of freight under the old
contract to July 1st, only a
small amount of money being
paid over, on account of steamships
having been filled with freight.
The Acapulco had o freight list of
$4S, CSC, and the Crescent City which
sailed to-day carried forty-five cab
in passengers and very large car
go of freight, the invoice for which
calls for $36. 500. The new steam.
er Clyde is now In the docks, and
will be at once placed
on the Aspinwall route,
The contract for passenger rates
with the Union Pacific road has
not been abandoned as reported,
but is being faithfully kept up. 1t
was stated to-day by Pa
cific Mail director that under
the contract Pacific Mail pas
senger rates to San Francisco
are $137, the same as charged by
rail, in consideration of which the
Union Pacific Railroad pays five
dollars head for every through
passenger carried by rail. For the
month of June this amounted to
$4,000. It was further stated that
President Babcock will insist upon
ten dollars head money, and that
the freight contract will probably
be abandoned. Captain Babcock
and Sidney Dillon, President of the
U. p. r.. r., have had one confer
ence on the subject, and will meet
again on Monday.

Charlotte N. C) Observer: The
quantity of manufactured tobacco now
shipped from Reidsville, Danville, Wins
ton, Durham and other tobacco centers
in this State and Virginia to the South
probably greater just now than it has
ever been, owing to the fact that the fac
tories held all they made during the dis
cussion of the change in the tobacco tax,
and as soon as this was settled for the |
year, at least, manufacturers began to |
hip as rapidly as possible.


Fort Worth Standard The name |
and fame Of Albert Sidney Johnston are
indisolubly blended with the history of |
Texas. Responding to the call of the |
8 tate of Texas, whose battles for indie
pendence he had fought, and recognizing
the fact that Texas did not lose her SOW
ereignty by the act of annexation, he re-
signed his high command and cast his
fortunes with the south. The sod of
Texas covers the remains of our hero,
and the wild prairie flowers and luxuri-
ant grass wave over his grave.

equality of flaws between Ireland and England.
and the mutual good feeling growing up be-
tween the two races is spoken of in comfort

Swift"" lies heavy on them, and, for the benefit
of those optimists who believe in the possibili-
ty of q race friendship between the two ma
thing works in practice. There are about
20, 600 shipyard laborers in England, who,
almost to q man, are Irish: Their work mainly
consists in helping skilled workmen, called
platers, go per cent of W hom are English, and
all mem bsIs of powerful trades union. A
few years since both classes of men weZe paid
time wages, the ratio being about 32s to lSs
per week for skilled and unskilled labor.
Piece work has now been introduced, end the
platter earns three times his former wsges-of
course, by working three times as hare. The
helper, however (who, under the snb-contraot
system, is paid by the plater) only receives l7s
per week, although his labor, in the same way,
has increased three fold, and the difference in
ekill between the workmen Is really very
slight. Ia some yards the masters, seeing the
Injustice done to the laborer, insisted on his
receiving piece wages, and be then earned IS
where he had previously earned 80. This,
however, was too Inch for the platers, ana
their union stepped i'll and put an end to this
equitable mode of payment, without alleging
shadow of reason the real one being too
disgraceful to mention-the wish to pocket for
themselves the result of other mems sweat.
Scarcely any union exists among the laborers,
who are therefore not in position to struggle
against their taskm masters (their fellow-wor
men); but their grievances have been exposed
in series of mastery papers by Mr.. james
Lynch, of South Shields, who has again and
again invited the uuioniets to appoint arbitra-
tors to decide the matter. This was contempt
uously refused, on the ground that the suffer-
ere wore persons who merely belonged to the
g. sister island - bat Mr. Lynch, nevertheless,
all the help and sustainment which Irshmen
on Tyneside can give him. Politically as well
as socially, a league of 20 900 Irishmen might
weld great influence, and trust Mr.. Lynch,
in the end, will succeed in obtaining justice
for them by giving to the mass that cohesion
and union so necessary to the Improvement o.
their position.-London Correspondence Nation."

SUPPOSED WORK OF INcRNDIARIBs


NASHVILLE, Tenn, April IA, 1873.",,"ocE HOhh oF INCENDIAHIBB.


NASHVILLE, Tenn. April ""A, 1873.


Fifty-seven houses were burned at
Clarksville. the principal tobacco market
OF Tennessee, at an early hour this morn
ing. including eight groceries, four con-
fectionery establishments, two jewelry
stores, three clothing stores, two drug
stores, one book store, two saddlery
shops, two public halls, the Court House,
Chancery Court Clerks office. one furni-
ture store, one feed store, a coal office,
one newspaper office, one bank, one tin
and stove store, two millinery shops, one
gunsmith'S shop, one restaurant, one bar
Der shop, one livery stable, one immense
tobacco warehouse, containing 400 hogs
heads of tobacco; eight or ten residences,
one hotel, one agricultural implement
warehouse, one blacksmith shop, a shoe
shop and other small houses. The fire
lasted six hours from the time of break
ing out, eIhausting itself. Fortunately
there was no wind.


ORIGIN OF THE FIRE.


The fire is supposed to be the work of
an lncendiary. The negroes of the vicini-
ty have been very discontented of late,
owing to two causes. The first Of these
was the lynching of one of their number
a few weeks ago for an attempted out
rage ON white girl belonging to one Of
The hrst families in the county. Subse-
quently negro named Seat, while resis-
ting policeman named Phillips by at
tacking him with stones, was shot and
killed by the officer. The negroes were
intensely excited over this act and made
such threats of revenge upon Phillips
that he had taken up his quarters in the
Jail for protection.


The fire broke out half-past eleven,
and when the bell was rung alarming the
town it was taken for riot alarm, and
the people did not turn out promptly, all
dreading the result. When the lire had
got under way and was raging furiously
the negroes gathered in knots and re-
fused to give any assistance, openly ex-
pressing their satisfaction at the FIRE.


LOSS AND INSURANCE.


F. P. Gracy is one of the heaviest
losers on his immense warehouse, cover
ing over an acre of ground, worth S1O,-
600; insurance $1,000.


In the warehouse were 400 hoesheads
of tobacco, which is still burning and
will probably continue to until it Is con-
sumed as there are no means of extin-
gushing it. The loss from the turning
out of $500 hogsheads in the street and
letting them run down hill, bursting and
scattering the tobacco in the streets and
afterward getting wet by rain was also
large."

FOUR THOUSAND MILE, BY WAGON.
IN Old Couples Journey From Teras to


NcD Jersey in Prairie Schooner.


philadelphia Times, Aug. 22.l


Robert Elder and his wife who reside near
Brazoris, Texas, a town about sixty miles
west of Galveston, decided that they would
pay a visit to friends residing in Norr1stown,
Pa. Years ago, when Elder was young, he
and his wife travelled in wagon from
Shreveport, La, to the place in Texas where
they settled, and since then, having no occa-
sion to move, the uses of railroads and Pull
man cars remained unknown to them, while
the possibilities for ""prairie schooner
(canvas-covered wagon was bright memo
ry. They recognized in it all that
was necessary to pleasantly journey 1000
miles from home and back, and accordingly
they hitched up sorrel team, and on the
10th of January last they left Brazoria, and
on the I'd of August they arrived in Phila-
delphia. Yesterday they started on their
long journey home, drawn by the same
sorrel team and riding in the identical
""prairie schooner in which they left the
Lone Star State. Their friends had moved
from Norristown and the main object of
their journey was not accomplished. Never
theless they had good time and drove down
to Absecom and from there rode over to At
lantic City in the cars, their first railroad ex-
perience, to see the ocean. They spent day
there and drove back to Camden and en-
camped at the foot of Spruce street for
few days, having the wagon repaired and
laying in supplies. They were just 200 days
on their trip, averaging ten miles
day on he road. If they make the
same time back the sorrel team will draw up
at Brazoria on the 10th of next March and
the travellers will have been gone just four
teen months. 1t is not many years since
prairie schooners in fleets spotted the plains
west of the Missouri, and in the far West
there is many family that journeyed across



But the completion of the Central and Union
Pacific railroads throttled the prosperity of
the prairie schooner and as an institution it
ceased to exist, although it is still used to
limited extent. Two lines of railroads stretch
from st. Louis to the Gulf and steamships
ply between ports on the Texan coast and
New Orleans and New York, so that Robert
Elders method of coming north was evi-
IDENTIFY chosen not out of necessity.


s'My friends at home,' he relates, tried to
dissuade me from goin' IN wagon, but 1
knowed what comfort is, and l reckoned on
havin' good time, not only when we got here,
but on the road. too. Well, we've had it. You
see am paralyzed in the right side and can't
do much, and the old woman she knows how to
take of hosses, and she bein' right keen to
come, says to her, says /, Well do it. We
fitted up the wagon with q stove and cookin'
things, got the bedding, new harness for the
hosses and the boys gave us a send-off. We
left our two sons and a da'ter to run the place,
old man tells his story with many a
deviation from the necessary line of
narrative. So, blowing away the chaff Of his
relation, the story of the trip may be put in
this condensed form: The line of route was
north 200 miles to Dallas, on the line of the
Texas Pacific railroad, and thence east to
Shreveport, La, where they crossed the Red
River on the first of March. The first part of
the journey was made in easy stages. The
first day eleven miles was accomplished, and
during the entire trip the most ground COW
cred in one day seventeen miles. The
start was usually made early in the morning,
and the six midday hours were spent in the
shade, where the horses could forage
When the shadows grew long
they hitched the sorrels and prairie schooner to-
gether again and logged along. When it was
necessary to reach good camping ground, where
there was water, pasture and fuel, they fre-
quently drove the task of one day without
stopping, and, with the exception of the 9TH of
April, when they rested twenty-four hours and
had their wagon repaired at Chattanooga, they
shifted ground daily. Elder is not exactly

From Shreveport the route was across the
northern part of Louisiana, over bad roads, to
Vicksburg, at which point the Mississippi river
was crossed thence to Jackson and the north

near Corinth, where they entered the valley of
windings through Huntsville, Ala; Chatta-
nooga, Knoxville, Tenn; Bristol Lynchburg,
Va, striking the Potomac at Alexandria. They
stopped at Washington a few hours and visited
the Capitol, and thence through Baltimore,
Havre de Grace and Wilmington.

Gil chamber was crowded with persons
who came up to see the organization of
the new City Council, and to find out
who would be selected to act as Clerk and
Bailiif under the Democratic regime.
During the afternoon the Democratic
members of Council had held caucus in
the Jefferson Club rooms, and though the
result of their deliberations was strongly
intimated to few, most persons in the
room had no idea who the lucky persons
would be.


AT 1870 o'clock all the holding over
members, with the exception of Mr.. Price
of the Third Ward, entered the Council
chambers ,and President Lichtenstin called
the Council to order and directed the
Clerk to call the roll.


Mr.. Paynter moved that a committee
ofthree on credentials be appointed, and
the molion prevailing, Messrs.ss ssPaynter,
Norton and Adams were appointed said
committee.


The committee retired, and Council
took recess OF ten minutes.


In a few minutes Mr.. Paynter came in
to Council and reported that the Inspec
tors of the outer districts of the Third
and Fifth Wards and Of the eastern dis
trict of the Seventh Ward, had sealed up
both their tally lists ln the ballot-boxes,
and the committee could not examine
the returns of the election without hav-
ing one of each of these lists. nor could
the boxes be opened except by order of
the Council. He therefore moved
that the committee be authorized to open
these boxes, in order to procure the tai
ly lists.


The chair suggested that If the boxes
had 10 be opened it woHld be better to
do 1t in open Council, and TO exercise
great care in keeping the boxes in their
original condition.


Mr.. Paynter's motion prevailed, and
the boxes were brought into Council and
opened on the Presidents desk. The de-
sired tally lists were obtained, after
which the boxes were again locked and
sealed by Messrs. Taylor and James.


Mr.. Maxwell offered the following res
olution which should have been offered
on Monday night, but was overlooked:

 A true bill was found against Rev. II. H. Hayden on two counts, one for killing Mary E. Stannard by cutting her throat and the other for poisoning her with arsenic. Hayden will l not be put to plea at once, it is said, and an immediate trial is not probable, as the de fcnse will require some time to prepare their case. The arsenic which was found in the prisoner's barn, weighs very nearly the ounce which he acknowledges buy ying.

 A true bill was found against Edgar Free man, the Ansonia negro charged with outra- sing little Jennie Me Crindle, and who came near being lynched for it, by the grand jury at New Haven last Wednesday, his alleged vic | tim, who is rapidly recovering from her inju- | ries, appearing among the witnesses against | aim. A speedy trial is desired by Ansonia people, so that the moral effect of tho crimi- nars conviction and punishment may not be lost dulled by delay. Freeman was former. i y of Norfolk.

SAN BUENA VENTURA, July
12th.-The slow process of filtering
q rigid cross examination first
through a Spaniard and then
through q miserable Chinese inter-
prefer has been going on In the
More murder case all afternoon. As
the Spaniard and Chinaman do not
pretend to know anything about
the personnel Of the murderers, but
only the facts, their testimony
seems to be closely sifted by the
defense, apparently for the purpose
of contradicting Jones, the States
evidence, who has sworn and will
swear both to the facts and the
men. No discrepancy was made
out, except such as might be ex-
pected where a witness has testi-
fed three or four times from men,
ory. Mr.. Fay took the
laboripg oar to-day for the
defense, Mr.. Raymond apparently
reserving himself for another
day. The prosecution was con-
Quoted by Mr.. Ganahl, to be re-
lieved Tomorrow by Mr.. Howard.
The trial promises to last q week
at least. The detectives are not
here, and so far the evidence is a
repetition Of the details of the
killing. When Jones takes the
stand, or new evidence is intro
'duced, the case will become more
interesting. Sprague sits with his
counsel, is we'll supplied with note
books and pencils and takes volu-
minous notes of the testimony, but
never offers suggestion. The
Court informed counsel this even.
ing that unless more progress was
made night sessions would be- or
dsrsd as there are elk other de-
PENDANTS awaiting trial.

Mr.. Paynter presented communi-
cation from Joseph Bancroft & Sons
specifying the terms upon which they
would furnish water for the city. The
communication is printed in another
column.


On motion of Mr.. Maxwell the ordi-
nance providing for all increase Of the
police force was taken up, when he
offered an amendment to the ordinance
creating two additional sergeants, and
two special officers.


Mr.. Norton made quite lengthy
argument against an increase of SER
Geants, and thought that il the force
had to he increased there had better
be more patrolmen ana less sergeants
He thought that the idea Of four ser
geants to twenty patrolmen was sim
ly ridiculous.


Mr.. McGlinchey moved an amend
ment limiting the increase to two SER
geants of ofpolice. Mr.. Norton again
MADE lengthy address against any
Increase whatever, especially of ser
grants, as the two now appointed had
nothing to do but to 60 from the City
Hail to Fourth and Market streets
where they met the patrolmen and
then they would come back to the City
Hall and act Chief OF Police and Mayor
too.


Mr. McGlinchey said h"" could not
sit still and hear the characters of the
two srrgeants vilifrd, for there never
were better men upon tn"" force than
John Legg and John F. Whrlan.


Mr. Norton said he would yillfy
them for they deserve it, and turning
to Mr. Mcilinchey he said ''you know
yuu said to ne that We ought to have
more patrolmen upon the beats, and
less beats upon tLr patrols


Mr.. McGlnchey arising said: II

After several more lengthy prechps
from Mr.. Norton in opposition to the
increase Mr.. Mdiinchey's amendment
was adopted


After Mr.. Norton got to understand
the position Of the ordinance he made
another long speech against it, the
vote was taken on its adoption, Mr..
Norton declaring that he was prepared
to make twenty speeches against it.


The ordinance was adopted by

Mr.. lleusted sent to the President a
Of sealed proposals for lighting

been opened and We're found to contain
no bond with security the President
proceeded no farther until it was ascer-
tanned whether the advertisement sta
ted that bond was to company the



1t being found that no bond was men
toned, MesSys. Taylor, Chandler and
others contended that the Committee
should be instructed TO advertise for
new proposals, each to be accompanied
with bond and approved security.


M""ssrs. McGlinchey, Norton and
juthrie thought that the ordinances

his time, that persons making propos-
ais for contracts should always know
hat bond with security was required.


A motion by Mr.. Taylor to refer

proposals offered was adopted.


Mr.. Maxwell offered resolution

a Detes ntaed Suicide.


SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. l4th.--A
women ramed Hattie l.. Russell
committed suicide last night or this
morning. at the California House,
on California street. She came to
the house on Sept. 5th with man
named H. l.. Brabent and was
registered from Portland, Oregon.
Yesterday Brabent went away into
the country leaving her here. Last
night she retired as usual. This
morning she did not appear as
usual and no response could be OBJ
tained to knockings on her door.
At length ladder was raised to
the window and an entrance eff
fected, when she was dis
covered to be dead. On stand
at the head of the bed were two
bottles and the following note:
""San Francisco, Sept. Hth, 1875
To the Public: 1 wish you all to
know that / die by my own hands,
for l am tired OF life. 1t has no
charms for me. Hattie l.. Russell,
aged IS years and five months""
One of the bottles had contained
morphine and one chloroform. She
had evidently taken morphine and
then saturated her handkerchief
with chloroform, placed it over her
mouth and buried her face in the
pillow.

The MehrunY Murder Case.
VIsALIA, Sept. l4.-The prellm.
mary examination of ]. NJ. White,
accused of the murder Of DIR. A. b.
Mehrung, was set for 9 o'clock this
morning. The Court was crowded.
The prisoner was unable to procure
counsel and for this reason, COM
bined with the absence of the Dis
trict Attorney, the case was post
poned till Monday at P. NJ. The
excitement still continues unabat-
ed, but public opinion seems pref
ty evenly divided. Last night
Sheriff Campbell had reason to
suppose that White would be
taken from the Jail and lynched
and he accordingly took pre-
cautionary measures for his pro
lection by placing a large guard at
the Jail. Mrs. Mehrung, who is AT
invalid, returned from the moun'
tains this morning. White had al
interview with his wife to-day
She protested her innocence, bu
acknowledges that they were or
the floor together. Her testimony
on the examination Is looked fo
with interest. White expects t.
be acquitted on the ground that ,
man found under such circum
stances forfeits his life. White
having no money has been unabl
to procure counsel, so far. Hon
Thos. F. Fowleris interesting him
self to procure the services of Hon
p. D. Wigginten for his defence
This promises to become a cele
brated case as the friends of the de
ceased will leave no stone unturnet
to procure the conviction o
White.

wine Banks attacked them with stones, and
went so far as to fire shots into the colored
party. This is denied bv some and others
give different accounts as to the origin Of It.


The first scrimmage took place about six
O'Clock and was soon quelled, but about ten
more serious one occurred. The, colored
men attacked the depot yelling and swear
ing that they would shoot the first white

A dispatch from St. Johns, Newfound-
land, received ON Monday of last week,
brought the sad intelligence that the Most
Rev. George Conroy, D. D Bishop OF Ar
pal Ablegate to the Dominion of Canada,
died suddenly on Sunday evening, 4th
instant, of syncope, at the residence of
Bishop Power. He had been the guest of
Bishop Power from June %, and was suf.
fering for some time from Inflammation of
the lungs, but had apparently recovered,
and on Sunday morning was pronounced
in a condition to travel with safety. He
was considered one of the ablest of the
Irish Bishops, and had attracted the spe-
cial notice of the late Cardinal Francbl
during short visit paid by the latter to
Ireland few years ago, which was the
cause of his being entrusted with the very
important mission to Canada, in the dis
charge of which he visited the New World.


Or. Coproy was native of Dundalk,
where he was born December 3lst, 1852
His early stNdies were made in Armagh,
but at the age of seventeen he was sent to
the College of the Propaganda, in Rome,
where, after a six years. course, during
which he greatly distinguished himself, he
was ordained to the priesthood, and on his
return to Ireland was appointed to pro
fessorehip in All Hallows Missionary Col
lege, nea7 Dublin. There he remained
till 1856, when Cardinal Cniien, attracted
by his admin jstrative ability and learning,
appointed him his private secretary. For
several years DR.. Conroy fulfilled not only
the onerous duties of this position, but
also occupied the chair OF Theology in


Holy Cross Seminary, Clonl1fe, aud super

was appointed by Pope Plus TX, Bishop
of the united dioceses of Ardagh and Clon-
macnoise, and on April 11th of that year

ALEXANDRIA, July II, ISIS.
To Tie Editor Of hS Adt,Odd RepaJiicuH:


Last night meeting was held in the
Market square and was addressed by
Che Hon. Eppa Hunton, the present rep.
r,sentatiye Of the eighth district, who
spoke for an hour aud half explaining
his course in Congress- followed by :. Chapman
Ncale, esq, candidate for the nomination be.
fore the convention to be held here IN August,
for the Forty.sixth Congress. The ward meet
ings to be held Tonight will appoint delegates
TO the convention, majority OF which, II not
hl, will be favorable TO Mr. Ncale-s0 II Is
ssid by those who pretend to know.


\ bomb.shcll from b. Johnson Barbour, Of
Orange County appeared in the GdscHs last
evening. announcing himself as al indcpend-
ent candidate, which may interfere somcN hat
with the convention arrangements.


T. ], Fauntloroy, on Frederick, talks Of run.
ming independent also Ia the district He Is u
smart, shTc""d mGu, great on the stump, and
not particularly polite ia handling his weapons
In Il canvass, or he would not probably have
defeated Mr. Barton from that district Fred.
erick in the Legislature.


There arc uunierUus gentlemen all over the
district also looking for IL, aud, as there Is
eOnsidclal dissatisfaction in many parts Of the
district because General Huuton did not de-
sire to bring OIL light for Tiden he may be set
aside.


In Mr.. fuckers district, Mr.. Whitehead, Of
LynChburg, lOnncrlya q representative IN Con.
grefs Is making strong !uaaway for the nom.
inatiOn. Conventions are getting very 'odi.
GUS II the Virginia papers were not 50 bitter
nnd tymnnCal about shooting descrters or
independents, there would be numerous inde.
pendent candidates. Things, however, will be
lively during August all over the State. Mauy
want the position for the salary."

The discussion of the subject, which


was full and ample, then began, Messrs.,

sustaing the Chief Engineer in the exer-


else Of hls rightful authority. a. = = q


Mr.. Guthrie spoke for the companies


on the ground that they were ordered
into service by the First Assistant Enpi-


neer bu: Mr. Lynch replied that the As


sistant, in his testimony before the cons
mittee, had denied giving such orders.
Mr.. Guthrie insisted that be had only
hearsay evidence TO This effect, and Mr..
Windle In support OF Mr.. Guthrie's view
read q published card from Assistant
Engineer Thomas, In which he stated
over his signature, that ""exercising what


l believed 10 be my undoubted authority
in the absence Of the Chief, I ordered the


Water Witch 10 60 into service and ex-
tlnguish the fire. ~ i5sA lH'n 5.re'f0
Mr.. Adams stated that MFR. Thomas
when before the committee, denied Civ
ing such order. and after some further
discussion Mr.. Taylor read MIR. Thomas'
evidence, which was TO the effect that he
did not know at the time that they were


outside Of the city limits, bat on being

That In view, of this being the first

This amendment drew out still further

to the competition between Duncan Rose


of Toronto, and Thomas Lynch of New

met Lynch in Jones Wood, and, after an


exciting trial, they parted without any de-

Those who knew the capabilities ofboth |
men were now convinced that Ross was
defeated. Lynch had won four trials |
against two won by Ross. There remained |
only two more, and of one of these Lynch |
was pretty sure, because of his greater |
lightness and elasticity oflimb. This was |
the running high jump. Ross cleared |
height of four feet and eleven inches, and |
failed at Eve feet. Lynch bounded over |
the bar lightly, and was hailed as victor !
with hearty cheers. AS the five points |
scored by Lynch made him the victor, the !
6nal 100 yard foot race was declared of, /
Ross wished to run. Lynch said |
that he could not win it because of the con-

City Council held an adjourned
meeting last evening, President Lich-
tenstein in the chair.


Mr.. Huested chairman OF the Lamp
Com,uittes, presented the following pro-
posals for lighting the city during the
year 1879:


C {. Middleton proposed to furnish
coal oil at l4f cents per gallon.


The Pennsylvania Globe Gas Light
Company, proposed to light, ,sxtinguish,
clean and repair the lamps Of the City
OF Wilmington and furnish gas and oil
for the same, at t2l.s per lamp.


The Wilmington Coal Gas Co.. pany
proposed to light, extinguish, clean and
repair the lamps at el7.5O per lamp,
each lamp to bs provided with three
foot burner as in New York and Brook.
lvn; or S2l. .25 for a four foot burner
aid $25 for FIVE foot burner.


On motion of Mr.. Price the propos
ais were referred to the Lamp Com
mittee.


On motion of Mr.. Paynter Council
went into the nomination and election
Of an accountant in the City Treasur-
er's office.


Mr.. Paynter nominated Cornelius
Stinson.


Mr.. Chandler nominated John NJ.
Taylor, the present incumbent. Mr.. c.
said he made the nomination not
through any partisan motives, but be-
cause MIR. Taylor was good efficient
officer, and he has proved himself to be
worthy of the position. He instanced
the case Of WIN, Hemphill Jones, who
occupied position in the Treasury De-
partment at Washington, and who be-
came such an efficient officer that when
other parties came into power in the de-
partment, he was kept on irrespective
of party. He thought Council should
look to the advantage of the city and
vote accordingly. TO remove John NJ.
Taylor would be loss to the Treasurer
and to the CITY, and he was satisfied
the people did not 4 mand change.


The President appointed Messrs
Dorning and Guthrie tellers.


The ballot being taken Mr.. Stinson
received eleven votes, and Mr.. Taylor
nine votes


Mr.. Norton was present in the ante
room but did not vote.


Mr. Stinsol having received the
largest number Of votes was therefore
declared elected.


Mr.. Lynch offered resolution that
committee of one member from each
Ward be appointed for the purpose OF
distributing fuel to the poor.


On motion Of Mr.. Lynch the rules
were suspended, and the chair appoin-
ted to name the committee.


The Committee will be announced at
the regular meeting on Thursday even

There being no further business Coun-

Ming These reee that Magistrate Pitcher has shielded
and coJperated with NewYork bancopiayers, and hss
levied blaekma upon the keepers OF disordery houses

THE GRAFTON.


Profcssr Richard T. Greener, the orator of
the day followed. He began by alluding to
the festival Of Saint John, the disciple whom
Jesus loved, and referred to Saint Johns con-
nectiOn with Masonry. He gave an historical
account Of the first initiation of colored Ma
sons-Prince Hall aud others, 9th of March,
! l175. In l7Si they applied to the Grand
Lodge of England for a charter. September
II, 1854 1t was granted, and is numbered 49,
African Lodge, upon page 80 Of the Jurisdic-
tiOnal Claims of the Most Worthy Grand
Lodge of England. Tho charter bore the
names Of Lord Howard, Henry Frederick
Ddkc Of Cumberland He discussed the claim
OF the Massachusetts, Grand Lodge to jurisdic-
ton over Prince Hall and his brethren, and
traced the rise of colored Masonry until the
present time. There were now nearly lOO,O





recognition at hone they applied abroad for
true fraternity and found it. Brother Caubet
pleaded the cause Of the American colored ma
sons before the Grand Orient of Francs, In
1915. At Darmstadt, 10th Of May, 1873, the
Grand Lodge Of Hamburg voted with re.
gard to the motion made by the Grand Lodge,
Prince Hall, and of the Grand Lodges of Ohio
the convention of Grand Lodges declare that
these Grand Lodges appear properly cOnsti-
tuted, aud that the German Lodges will ac-
cord TO members Of these lodges and their
sister lodges, without reserve and joyfully,
acceptance into their lodges"" Apina Grand
Lodge, Of Switzerland, had also recognized the
cOlOrcd brethcrcn. St. Andrews Lodge of
Massachusetts,, of which Paul Revere and Jo-
seph Warren were masters, admitted
colOred members. But, said the orator.
at Is not by charters simply
be they ever so genuine, nor by seals
and titles, though doubly aud trebly authen.
tiCatcd, that we are to develop and make real
progress as race and as Masous our salvation
is u be worked out by our own right arm, by
our own innate worth aud rigid sense Of duty
as well ms appreciation Of rights. No amount
of recognition can make us mel until we first
recognize aud cultivate in ourselves those Gle
mcnts Of respect, thrift and intelligence by
| which alone race can be exalted.
DO we complain because the veil is not lifted
at once Do we nurmur sometimes as we
| wander through the wilderness signing for
perfect manhood and cquaity2 We may re-
member that Ireland has been in subjuction
over 600 years aud the yoke is not completely
lifted. DO we mourn often ut the intolerance
of caster Let us recall how frtters bound
the HinGoo, the Egyptian, the Frenchman and
Englishman. We may remember that the fore.
most intellectual race in Europe, the one
strongest In wealth, in genius in song aud
literature Is the once despised lsracltes, and
recollcct what prosecutions they have endured
in all countries aud ages since their Dispersion""
After referring to the antiquity of Masonry,
its umiyesaity, and its principles of liberty,
equality, and fraternity, the speaker CON
cluded with an eloquent appeal, to prove them
selves good citizens true MasUns, and earnest
Christians, by steady upright lives, maintcn.
ance of order, obedience to authority, and
patience under supposed wrongs and positive
grievances. Professor Grcener was followed
by Charles W. Proctor, who made q very inter-
estng address, taking for his subject The
History Of Chapter MusOnry in the District""
The festivities were continued until midnight.

HIS OPINION OF LEE, JOHNSTON, SHERMAN


AND oTERS.",,"


AND oTERs.


\ correspondent of the New York Her.
atd furnishes some table talk with General
Grant from Hamburg. In this talk Gen
Grant is reported as saying that if he had
known the soldiers and generals of the
Potomac army better he would have pre-
ferred to invest Lee in Richmond from the
Lynchburg or land side, as he invested
Pemberton in Nicksburg. He seems not
to have attached SO much Importance to the
capture of the Richmond, Gen. Lee being
his objective point. He says his loss in the
Wilderness campaign, all told, instead of
being 100, 600 men, as generally believed was
only SO, 600, and that campaign was neces-
sary to destroy the Southern Confederacy.
| He described the circumstances attending
the surrender of Gen. Lee, and passed his
Judgment in a kindly manner on the gen
erals and public men on both sides. He
praised Gen. Butler, wished he had had
abler subordiDates, and expresses regret
that an unlucky phrase in his official report,
IN which the latter was represented as
being bottled up should have annoyed
Butler. He thinks Jefferson Davis did all
he could for the Confedercy, and did not
deserve the harsh criticism he got. He
thinks Stenewall Jackson might not have
proved SO effective a general later on in the
war if opposed to men like Sherman and
Sheridan, when his peculiar tactics would
have failed Gen. Grant seems to think Lee
not so great as his Notwithstanding of
him of course as a soldier and not as a man.
tie was never so uneasy when in front of
Lee as some of the other Confederate COM
manders, and he describes him as man Of
slow mind, without imagination, and of
nf
johnson, in his opinion, was the ajlest
commander on the Southern side. OF
Bragg he appears to have but a poor opiu-
ion. He tells singular story of President
Johnston's desire at one time to arrest Gen.
Lee and other Southern commanders for
treason, by way Of making rebellion odious.
Grant and Seward had, it seems the man
llness and good sense to oppose and defeat
this folly; and General Grant says he
would have resigned his commission rather
than consent to the arrest. the Southern
men being sacred under their parole 10
him.


Rosecrans, Buckner, Mcclellan, Buell.,
Stone and Mcdowell were, he saws, in the
opinion of old army, the most promising off
GERS in 1861. He still thinks that Buell.
had genius for the highest commands, and
that Mcdowell was a man of great ability.
Sherman and Sheridan he praises without
stint.


Gen. Grant says be did not want to 90 to
West Point, never liked command, and
demonstrated against the creation of the
grade of Lieutenant general made for him,
though he saw the necessity of it later.
He says there was no battle of Lookout
Mountain-''no action worthy to be called a
battle.''


He says neither he, Sherman nor Sheridan
ever held a council of war; he determined
on his course in private, and no one knew
what he was about to do until the orders
were written out. Finally he speaks about
his presidential career; thinks the second
term was almost his due"" because he
had been bitterly opposed; but relates that
he refused peremptoriIy third nomination
which was urged upon him, aud on the
ground that the contest would belittle him;
that if reelected it would have been only
against strong opposition, and his admins
tration of third tenn would have been
unsatisfactory."

she said, sitting up, with an eager, refreshed
look on her face. II thought l was dead al

1t was q dark narrow space where was lying,
but at one end there was q door, opening
well,ligbted staircase. which, in my dream, 1
thought led up to heaven. | wanted to ges mp
and go to the staircase, but found myself un-
able rise-there seemed TO be great weight
jnst over my heart pressing me down. Then l
looked up and through the roof of my grave
their tears trickled through the tuIf and fell
on me like lumps of lead and weighed me
down. Then thought heard voices calling
me from tie top of the stairs to come up, aud
one voice said, why don't you pick up the
tears and briug them with you TO he 7 And at
the sound of that voice l seemed TO have
strength TO rise; and began to gather up the
tears, and as did so bright figures trooped
down the stairs and took them out of my hand.
1 expected to see the angels return by the way
they came, but instead of that they rose up
through the roof of the grave, and took the
weeping people by the band and led them
away. l looked after them, and saw that the
bare, psrched-up ground on which they stood
became verdant under their feet, and on every
side waved with grass and flowers and ripe corn.
You were the last lett by the grave, and was
wondering what would happen to you. when
1 heard q sound of horse-hoofs coming down
the road, and immed ediately the scenery of
the dream faded, and thought only of seeing
your father ride mp to this door, as he has
done hundreds of times to bring you home
when you have zen spending the day with
me. Dou't hear tae sound stiil 7""


'Yes,n said Ellen, sit must have been that

n-ans of which they intend TO be vic


'orious in avery county and Coagres-


ional district OF their State in the CON.
I'M election. u


For long time they have been at


york trying to intimidate State Senator
Duncan, OF Orangeburg county, a col
bred man, and to force him TO resign
bis seat and suspend bis work In the
present CANVASS. Failing to scare him,
they have now found white man


ho swears that in II. last canvass


Mr.. duncan promised him, If success
6ul, to secrre his appointment az
County Auditor. A warrant for


HE arrest of Duncan was mad""
'put by the D-,nocYts immediately after


obtaDing this sta:.nent, and just be-
4|bre the time appointed for the meeting


y the chairman Of the Precinct Com


hittee OF the county at Orangeburg


Duncan, who was county chairman, was
arrested and lodged in jail. Bail was
procured in the sum OF 81 800, it being
Furnished by a Mr.. Webster. There


n pom the same iniorner swore that
Webster was also promised by DuHcan
Ah- Office Of County Treasurer, and a
Warrant vas issued for the arrest Of


Webster, thus rendering him ineligible
'as a bondsman. Duncan and Webster
swere both locked up in deiault of IS,
bOO0 bail.


People In Washington who know
Webster say that he is a man Of unlm-
3psachable character aud Of much in
tiu-nce. H. was q Methodist preacher
BIZ New England, and, before the war,
iWent 10 South Carolina as u repres-n
tative of the Northern Methodist ch arch.
|lle has since been, and is thought yet
|to be-, the presiding elder OF the North
Iern Methodist Conference Of South Caro-


Dina. lie was, tor some years, Prssi-
dent of the Clafin University, Of
tOrangeburg, and editor Of the Free
Citizen. He is well known throughout
the state, and wields considerable in
tluence, but has made himself obnox-
lOus to the Democracy by his fearless
championship Of the colored race.
n Current events in South Carolina now
eeem to herald the early dawn of a


peace as profound and sincere as that
"" Which prevails in Mississippi and Ar
Kansas. Governor Hampton, in re-
GENT public speech, claimed that all ex.
eept two counties of the state are sure
% 60 Democratic, and that those two
,yre only doubtful. Republicans there
md in Washington conced- that the re.
tArn of single Republican to Congress
~ no longer thing to be hoped for.
The Democratic victory is already won,
1bt by the conversion ofRepublicans to
We support of Democratic principles
80 Democratic candidates but by their
practcal disfranchisement.

daughter, Mrs. John Parton. Capt.
Wilmar is a fine specimen OF the western
frontierSman, and has perhaps seen as
much wild life in the west as Kit Car
son, Daniel Boone, David Crockett or
old Greenwood. Although in his seven
ty-ffth year, he is as straight as an ar
row, an eye which has not been dimmed
by years, and, except an occasional
twinge of the rheumatism, is in as good
health as when he first tore himself from
society fifty years ago and began the
life of hunter, trapper and Indian
fighter. At that time he lived in Ken
tucky, where his wife died, leaving Il
girl baby, which the father placed in the
hands of a near relative to raise and
care for. That was over half century
ago, and the child is now Mrs. Parton,
the daughter whom the Captain is now
visiting.


When he first left home he and three
companions came down the Ohio River
to its mouth in canoe, thence up the
Mississippi River to St. Louis, which
was then but village.


They had heard much of the wealth
of New Mexico, which was then under
the rule of Spain, and concluded that
they would visit Santa Fe. They pur-
chased horses in st. Louis and other
necessaries and started on their long
trip, going as near on bee line as pos
sible. Only a few miles west of st.
Louis and they were out of the settle
ments and travelling over the trackless
and almost unexplored plains, which to-
day are the most fertile spots Of Mis-
souri, In course of time they came to q
fine stream of clear running water which
they followed down until they came to
where it plunged over ledge of rocks,
making most beautiful and picturesque
waterfall. Although the stream bore
no name at the time Capt. Wilmar is
confident that it was ShOal Creek and
the falls were what are known as Grand
Falls, situated about five miles south of
Joplin. Here the little company halted,
intending to rest few days before pro-
ceeding on their journey, as fish and
game were plenty and no signs of hos
tile Indians. One day the Captain and
another member of the company named
Harmon shOuldered their muskets and
went on foot in search of game, leaving
their companions to take charge of the
camp. They were gone nearly all day
and toward evening started on their re-
turn to the camp well loaded with game.
When they arrived here a sight met
| their gaze that nearly froze the blood in
their veins. Both of their companions
lay dead-one covered with knife
wounds and the other with bullet-hole
through his forehead. Not a thing
about the camp had been disturbed.
The horses were still standing where
they had been tethered, which shows
that the assassin, whoever he was, did
not intend robbery, but was bent upon
revenge for some cause which was un-
known to the two survivors. They
buried their dead comrades near where
they fell, and that evening left camp
and Travelled all night in westerly di-
rection before Ethey rested. 1t was
full 20 years afterward before the mys-
terry was explained, and then by chance.


During the Mexican war Capt. Will
mar took an active part on the side of
his country and organized company
of Texan rangers. Among his men was
a middle-aged man, very quiet in his
demeanor, but bold as lion. In a
skirmish with the enemy this man was
mortally wounded, and when he saw he
must die, called his captain to him and
asked if knew who he was. His officer
said he knew nothing about him only
what he had learned since they had
been together. He then told the cap
tain his true name and that of his ia
ther. Capt. Wilmar remembered his
father well, who had been lynched in
Kentucky for committing an unprovok
ed murder and which, at the time, Great
ed a great sensation.


The dying man said he had killed the
captains two companions, and he did
it because he knew they had been en-
gagged in lynching his father, and that
he had followed them from Kentucky to
what is undoubtedly now known as the
Grand Falls of Shoal Creek before he
had an opportunity to carry his design
into execution. He had dogged their
steps from St. Louis across almost the
entire State before he could catch them
alone. When the opportunity arrived
he crawled upon them, within ten feet,
and shot one of the men dead, and be-
fore the other could recover from his
surprise he sprang upon him, and with
his long, keen hunting-knife soon ended
his life He then mounted his horse and
left the spot, going back to his native
State, but soon emigrated to Texas.
There can be no doubt as to the truth of
the narration, and the captain is certain
that Shoal Creek falls is the spot where
the bloody scene was enacted.

nouncing tho subject Of his lecture ''Jesus and

that the comparison between these two great lights In
history was original with him. Tho English Or.

both made comparisons between Jesus and Socraies
But since then the Christian world had been
entering upon great revolution, the elements OF
which had been gathering for 500 years past Here
toiore Christianity had only been met by other his
toric religions To-day It must meet the universal
religion OF man, broad and expansive in its scope 1t
like the great river Mississippi being matched by
the vast ocean. To-day the struggle Of the human

isolated souls but entire peoples thirsting Tor

the attention of our people during the past
week, and provided sensational food to salts
fy the most insatlaple, come 70 an abrupt
termination to-day. AS telegraphed you last
night, the coroner's jury, afr an exhaust
less and impartial investigation, decided
upon verdict, which was made public this
morning, finding that the murdered family
came to their death at the hands OF Provost,
the prisoner. This, coupled with the ap-
prehension of lynching, seemingly proved
too much for Provost, for upon opening the
iail this morning he was found dead, having
hanged himself during the night. This act
scanned more remarkable, as he has remained
stoIid and immoyable in his claim of inno-
cence, and the overwhelming circumstantial
evidence produced no visible change IN his
demeanor.


At five minutes after eight o'clock this
morning, Deputy Sheriff Runner went INTO
the iail to serve breakfast to the four PRISON
ers. In the jail is an upper and lower Ter
of cells, four in each tier. Provost occupied
cell in the lower tier. The remaining
prisoners were in the upper cells, one oc-
cupy1ng cell directly above him. Provost
not appearing for breakfast, Runner directed
another prisoner to call him. He opened
the cell door, looked in, and reported to
Runner that Provost was dead. Runner i'm
mediately went to the cell and found that his
condition was as follows: Provost had tied
a towel around his neck; his coat he had
fastened to the upper bunk, which is about
four feet from the floor, and formed of thin
fiat iron strips laid across each other, leaving
openings of about four inches square.
Through these openings the coat-sleeves
were hung down; one of these was passed
through the towel and tied to the other
sleeve. He then drew his body so as to
| throw its weight upon his neck, and thus re-
manned until his death ensued from strangu-
lation. His body was in diagonal position,
his head being near the door, his feet rest
ing on the floor and his right hand rest
ing on the lower bunk, the left hand hanging
down. His head was not over three feet
from the floor, making it necessary for hum
| to draw his body up, and, by resolute deter
mination, hold it in >S1ze> position until
vitality was gone. Assistance being secured,
| the body was removed to Gardner's under
| taking establishment, where a cOroner's jury
was impaneled, and verdict rendered In ac-
cordance with the above facts. One of the


remaining prisoners IN Jail thought he heard
! a slight struggling noise about midnight,
/ but the medical evidence before the coroner's
| Jury fixes the time of the suicide at between
/ two and three o'clock.


Provost's features are not destorted, his
appearance being natural except the body,
/ which remains rigi in the curved position
| in which it was found. Yesterday afternoon


Father Oester, of the Catholic Cathedral by
request of the prisoner, visited the Jail and


remained with him an hour. He stated ne
was an Alsatian, born at Belfort and fifty


one years of age, but revealed no more of his


previous history. After leaving the prison,


having confessed the prisoner, and promis-
1 ing to return the next morning and admins


ter the sacrament, he was told by many that


there was great danger of the prisoner being
| lynched that night. He therefore returned


to the prison and informed the prisoner that


he had returned to furnish the holy com


munlon. The prisoner asked why he had


come at such an unusual hour. Father
Oester replied it was best for him to be pre-
pared to die, as mob might kill him that
I night. Provost asked what could be the


manner of his death, and was told that it


would be shooting or hanging Father
/ Oester again exhorted him to confess any
thing In his life which would make him un-


easy as to his future, but the prisoner was


silent. The priest then administered the


sacrament, and, giving him his prayer beads,


left him. After the departure of the priest


Provost declared himself ready to die, and


probably determined upon the subsequent


suicide. One of the prisoners heretofore re-


ferred to says after the departure of Oester


the prisoner was greatly distressed and


agitated. crying at times. He soon went to


his cell, one of the prisoners following soft
ly and peeping in. Provost seemed to be


measuring the distance from the upper bunk


to the floor, stopping Immediately upon dis
covering that he was observed, and soon


after the turnkey locked the prisoner in and
| he was seen no more alive.


= A general sense of relief is experienced by


the entire Community at the tragic ending of


the affair as it is understood that an organiza-


ton had been consummated cf band of
4 vigilants, who would have attempted their


purpose tonight. His timely death has,


however, removed ali necessity, and afforded


complete satisfaction to our citizens, who,


almost as unit, consider him guilty. To-


morrow morning the body will be inferred"

The Ventura Murder Trial.


SAN BUENAvENTURA, July 18th.
i his forenoon the trial of Sprague
was proceeded with. DR.. belmont,
the coroner, was first called upon to
prove the cause of death. He de-
scribed the location of ten bullet
wounds in the head, neck and body,
each of which, except two, were ne
cessarily fatal. None of them were
i'm the back of the head or body.
He had probed the wounds and had
requested leave TO make an autop-
sy at the time of the inquest but
relative of the deceased refused. He
could not describe the kind of
bullets particularly. From the
appearance Of the wounds some of
them were evidently rifle balls, and
the others either buckshot or pistol
balls, he could not tell which.


The Chinese cook was recalled
and severely cross examined, evil
IDENTIFY not SO much to break him
down as for an ulterior purpose.


The trial progresses very slowly,
the legal contest being keen and
close, exceptions and counter-eX-
ceptions following each other in
quick succession, each giving rise
to short arguments. The decisions
are prompt and 10 more often eX-
cepted to than Is usual in murder
trials. The Chinese cook testified
to-day for the first time, we be.
lieve, that on the night of the muir
der he saw five masked men. G.
A. Storke, sOn-in law of deceased,
was called, and proved a personal
quarrel between the prisoner and
deceased, few weeks before the
murder. On cross examination
he admitted that the collision
had occurred on land claimed by
Sprague, which WAS outside of the
claimed limits of the grant, and
also that on that occasion the ex-
amining magistrate refused to hold
Sprague for trial. After one hours
testimony, direct and cross, the
Court ordered it stopped, stating
that, at the proper time, he should
instruct the jury to disregard the
whole Of it.


Austin Brown, who lived within
half o mile of the scene of the MUIR
der, was next called to the stand
and examined by Col. Howard.
He had conversation with Sprague
two weeks before the murder, in
which Sprague said that More
ought to be killed, and would be,
and that men had been detailed to
kill him. In another conversation,
three weeks before the murder,
Sprague said he had just come
from Ventura, where he had talked
with Hines, who said the matter
must be settled in some other way
than by law. Sprague said: ""More
threatens to take our water, and
turn his sheep loose ON US, and 1
have come to see you about killing
him, and there is party organized
to do it. Long before this Sprague
told the witness that More ought
to be killed; he said the party to
do it were John Curlee, Jesse
Jones, H. Cook, julie Swanson and
Churchill, and he wanted witness
to join. WitnessAsked how 1t would
he done, and he replied that
it was all planned and fixed; that
they had a turpentine ball to fire
the barn and bring More out of the
house, when they would shoot him.
He said they would be disguised
with barley sacks over their heads
SO that no one would know them
and had place ofrendezvOus where
they would meet at 10 o'clock at
night. The signal was low whis.
tie which would be re-
piled to and some one
would come to witness. Witness told
him his wife could not stay alone
at night, and therefore refused to
GO. If he Qhe witness) was out at
night, she would mistrust some
thing, and he could not go. This
closed Browns direct examination.

Many are engaged in active service to the

Where lynch law prevails it is safe to
assume that the Courts are inefficient, or
the administration of justice failure, and
it was, therefore, matter Of surprise to
find, few days ago, that an attempt al
lynching had been made in Connecticut,
an old, thickly settled State, noted for
many general ions for its adherence to law.
Two days afterwards possible explains
tioB came in report Of the sentences i'm
posed by Connecticut Courts upon two
murderers. One had killed a man who
had attempted to prevent the criminal
from beating his wife. he was sentenced
to pay fine of one hundred dollars, and
suffer imprisonment for eighteen months.
Another, a iavern>keepsr, had kicked a
customer 30 severely that he died the next
day, He was sentenced 10 Imprisonment
for sixty days, and to pay fine Of 5000
Ii such are the lenient sentences imposed
upon murderers by Connecticut Courts, ar
explanation may be found in that leniency
f,r . disposition on the part Of mobs to
wresk vengeance on the heads Of bruta
murdersrs at the time they are captured
Lynching in a community governed b,
law i never excusable, but it is fact t,
be noted 'as such, and not in excuse there
for, that lynching is an almost universe
resort whenever the law or the admins
tration Of the law affords no adequate pro
lection against other crimes."

body. killing him almost instantly. The sound of
the shots and the cries OF Smith quickly brought
Darden from the store and he arrived just
in time to hear Smith say with his
expiring breath, I'm torn all to pieces"" The
lnlrderous assassin had concealed himself in wood

precipitation. He only few feet from his

of the rib inch long through the lung and lodged
under the skin the opposite side of the body. The

GREATLOss OF PROPERTY,",,"which So suddenly opened last Friday after noon Aug. 9th, has ever before been expe- risnced ln the calamities wrought by light ming. wind and rain, in any part of New England. The storm struck thls village ID a succession of severe showers, accompan- led with heavy thunder and vivid lightning. It was entirely unexpected, and wayfarers and farmers were completely at Its mercy. The wind blew fiercely, and the heavy rain was dashed against windog panes, threat ening instant destruction. while fences fell a prey to it's fury, and unreaped grain fields were made level with the ground. The lightning struck in several places but did no serious damage. O. w. Bassett of this town, was just passing the R. k. crossing when bright flash struck the truck behind bis wagon, and quickenee bis speed some what unnecessarily be thought. His horse started to run, but soon brought mp against the lamp post in front of Humphreys store completely demolishing it, and overturning the wagon. Mir. Baasett was partly stunned by the folce of the shock. An elm tree near. the house of Mrs. J. L.. Pease, was struck, and the inmates of the house greatly frightened thereby. 1.-The lightning struck in several places in the south part of the town eut without much loss Altogether it was the severest storm seen in this vicinity for years, and we are to be congratulated it's effects were ot so slight nature.

 THE wALLINGFoRD TORNADO.

 Connecticut was about the last region to expect a visitation from whirlwind, as people have become accustomed to some such accounts from the great plains of the West, or tho tropical regions, and when Tu- mors reached thls place about o'clock Friday night of terrible disaster in Wal iingford, caused by cyclone, it seemed incredible.

 Wallingford is 8 thriving manufacturing town, with population of about 900, sit uated on the line of the New York. New Haven 6 Hartford railroad, about II miles north of New Haven, and from Meriden. The storm came from the northwest, and the clouds were as black as sable pail for nearly an hour before the tempest reached the Inflated town. Some reports say that there was a meeting of the clouds, and that the storm burst in it's fury over the lake west of the village, and that there was an appearance of

 two hundred feet high. All accounts agree that the first striking demonstration was over the lake, and some people not only as' sert that the water was carried up from the lake. but that the waters of the lake were separated in 8 wide swath, forming roll

  From this point the tornado took definite shape and direction, and had rotary mo- ton. The track of the gale was on an even line about

 FOUR HUNDRED YARDS WIDE, and extending over distance of about two miles, though the loss of property and life was confined to Q much smaller space. The ground was covered with all manner of household goods and wearing apparel, tim bers, trees, and scarcely anything could be seen that did not bear the appearance or utter ruin.

 Great trees eleven feet in circumference were snapped off and 10 feet from the ground. Houses were blown down and actually swept away like chsff. Many houses were blown off at the top. leaving the lower part. Beams and timoers were hurled hundreds of feet through the air. i. The large High School building recently built of brick four stories high, ard costing $45, 900 was destroyed in it's upper stories, and the ruins carried several hundred feet away. Thirty lives are lost, and between $l50. .000 and $2OO, 900 worth of property destroyed. All the bodies were more OF less mutilsted, some of them were horribly d:sfgured.

 The list of dead is as follows: Mrs. M. Boyle: Thomas Cassin; Mrs. Margaret Mooney, John Mooney and wife, and Mat thew, Nellie and Kate Mooney, children, Conrad Tracy, wife and two children Mr. Joseph Huldie and two children, Fredrich Littlewood, Mrs. John Lynch. Mrs. Ed ward Downes, Martin Healy, Kate Conklir Mrs. Michael Toohy, John and Patrick John Hayden. John Psdden, Thomas Dai ley's infant, Thomas Ginty.

 INCIDENTS.

 The loss of life would have been mucl greater If the storm had occurred fev minutes later, as the men had not returne from their work

 Mrs. Toohyis body was found about on hundred rods from her house.

 Two hogs weighing $50 pounds each were carried about a quarter of a mile un hurt.

 A number of monuments and head stone were thrown over and broken in the Cath olic cemetery.

 Matthew Mooney was hurled fifty fes and almost beheaded.

 The tornado swept over the town abor half past six. and completed it's terribl work in about five minutes.

 Five out of six of the Mooney famil were killed.

 During the tornado the rain fell DO VI fully, in several instances saving the rui from breaking out in blaze.

 Trees were stripped of their bark con pletely, and in many cases trees on all side of buildings were thus served without il jury to the buildings.

 A stack of hay belonging to John Lync was taken by the hurricane into the air : m enormous height, landing nearly a eighth of Q mile up the hlll.

 Mrs. Huldy had her child in her arm when picked up. Both were dead and al most scalped.

The Hot Season.

BY OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES.",,"The folks that on the first of May


Wore winter-coats and bose,
Began to say, the first of June,


Good Lord how hot it grows %
At last two Fahrenheits blew up,
And killed two children small,
And one barometer shot dead


A tutor with its ball /!
How all day long the locusts sang


Amoug the lesfiess trees;
Three new hotels warped inside out,
The pumps could ouly wheeze;
And ripe old wine, that twenty years
Had cobwebbed o'er in vains
Came spouting through the rotten corks,
Like Joly's best Champagne!
The Worcester locomotives did


Their trips in half an hour:
The Lowell cars run forty miles
Before they checked the power;
Roll birthstone soon became drug,
And loco-focos fell
All asked for ice, but everywhere


Saltpetre was to sell.
Plump men of mornings ordered tights,
But, ere the scorching moons,
Their candle-monlds had grown as loose
As Cossack pantaloons !
The dogs run mad men could not try
III water they would choose;
A horse fell dead ,-he only left


Four red-hot, rusty shoes |!
But soon the people could not bear
The slightest hint of fire;
Allusons to caoric drew


A flood of savage ire;
The leaves on heat were all torn out
From every book at school,
And many blacBguard kicked and caned
Because they said, ""Keep cool -
The gas-light companies were mobbed,


The bakers were all shot,
The penny press began to talk


OF fLynching DIR. Mott;
And all about the warehouse steps
Were angry men in droves,
Crashing and splinteriDg through the doors
To smash the patent stoves"

manner and betrayed no nervousness. His
story was substantially this: was at home
all of Monday night, from half past six o'clock
when got home from the store. wore at
that time the same suit of clothes and the
same shirt which have on now, and which
1 have worn all winter; never use the gun,
although Charlie does sometimes; there are
no buckshot in the house. The last time
saw Green was last Sunday night about 10
O'Clock, as I was coming out Of church know
nothing as to how Green came to his death,
and had nothing to do with 1t whatever;
don't know Lucretia Brown, and never made
the remarks she said made; never told her
I would kill Green, as never had anything
to kill him for; me and Patterson are not
friends; whipped him once, and told him
would do 1t again II he didn't stop his stories
about me; never said that Green had parted
Henry Carter and his wife, or that would
kill him II he ever came between me and my
wife; never told Rachael Mitchell that
had twenty bullets for Green; I always took
Green's part when he w3s abused BY others.

A slight mistake occurred in the report o
day before yesterdays proceedings, in Ofice
King Robinson's testimony. What Mr.. Rob


inson really said was, that the probable rout'


taken by Green on the night of the murde


was from his residence down Pottowatomi


street to the vacant lots bordering on Nintl


street, across those lots to the corner Of TIN


alley at Ninth street, near which place he re


ceiyed the fatal wound.


| Green's funeral will take place this morn
ing, with imposing ceremonies, from the A
NJ. L. Church, on Kiowa, between Fourth an
Fifth streets, at IL O'Clock. The procession


will be an immense one."

primary election for county officers is su-
perior to the delegate system. Who will
receive the nomination for Sheriff or Coroher
is hard to conjecture. All is uncertainty.
Lambson Is the favorite at New Castle.
Lynch denies that there is any coalition be.
tween his men and the Republicans, and
says 1t is the same old cry that is always
raised against man that is likely to win.
But unless certain objection that is raised
prevails, John Pyle will receive the nominal
ton for Sheriff. And If s. J. Gilbert really
unites the elements he says be can, his
nomination for Coroner is assured. On tho
other hand If the railroad influence is welded
on Murpby's behalf, beyond doubt Hugh
Murphy will be nominated for Coroner

Mr.. Loveioy also submitted AN individua
report giving history of the question of th
change OF Textbooks since IL first came up II
the old board last June, aud urged rs objection
to the change;


First, the high chnractcrof Davies works that IN
principals and assistants are familiar with DRvic,
scTics that the manufacture ana multiplication q

commercial speculation, should hc dl,c""untC

,, First That the prescnt board stand In tlduciar

q Mr.. Lynch said he would ebeerfully vote

Mr.. Paynter stated that there was some
irregularity between the City Treasurer
and council In reference to the appropria-
tions and moved that the rules bs Suspended
and statement rssd.


Tha motion prevailed and the following
statement was read:


Mr.. Lewis Paynter, chairman &c.; Dear
Sir-Soms time ago when the appropriation
for side walks was exhausted by some ones
order. I dc not known who, $4S9.91 was
taken frsm the water appropriation and
used for sidewalks. The books of the
Clerk of Council, show this amount TO
have been, returned but the Treasurer's
books do not.


On last Friday the Treasurer refused to
pay our pay roll check and I had $50 50
charged to sidewalks, then he paid the
check. There is still due the water ap
preparation by sidewalks, $409.S9.


In addition to this, bill Of Joseph G.
File,i In October, for work done on sluce over
Brandywine race, by order of street commit
tee was charged to our appropriation when
it should have been charged to streets; the
bill amounted to $s4es; and was:applied by
Chas. a. Gallagher. The total due the
water department to date 10 $473.44.


As those appropriations are under the
control of B. F. Townsend, he should re.
turned II he has any money left pay oyer
pay roll to night as he will not have any
more use for money this year. Yours
I. Fl. b. MCINTYRE.
Mr. Paynter then said that the Water
Committee was not to be blamed for their
ignorance Of the smsllncss Of the appropris'
tion. Upon the cards on which the different
appropriations are printed and by which the
committee was guided, was much larger
than upon the Treasurer's books, and con
seauently they were led astray. The apprc
priation for garbage for 1878 amounted b
$1,000 which was much more than needed
and he moved that the payroll of the Water
Department be paid out Of that appropria-
| tion. .s .
After some little discussion the motor
prevailed. The payroll Of the Water De
partment was then ordered to be paid.


President Lichtensteip announced the

Last Saturday afternoon week ago he
met little German girl driving her cows
home from pasture. The child was sing
ing as the negro accosted her. lie had
begged food of her mother that morning.
and, though the place was lonely and il
growing dark, she recognized him pleas
antly and would have passed on. Sud
denly tins negro was joined by another,
and half an hour later the hapless child
dragged herself slowly along the road
toward home. The cows had reached
the paddock before her, and the good
housewise, alarmed, had started toward
the pasture in search of her daughter. A
doctor was summoned; but he gave little
hope of saving the child's life. The
father and elder brother reached home
from work little later; the neighbors
had angrily gathered, and before night
fall twenty-five armed men were securing
the country for miles about. The father
and brother at their head. A lieutenant
OF police, with twelve officers, joined in
the search, and a Gordon was formed that
swept slowly toward successive centres,
covering almost every foot of ground
meanwhile.


1t seemed possible that the negroes
should escape, but daylight the next
morning found the pursuers, their num-
Der swelled to fifty or more, st n defraud-
ed of their prey. 1t was rumored to-
ward morning that the two men had
taken refuge In dark cave in one cor
ner Of the beautiful Cave Hill Cemetery,
and an armed watch was kept at its
mouth until the sun, penetrating its re-
cesses, showed that it was empty. At
about half past In the afternoon two of
the policemen caught sight of the ne
groes resting under trees near the Lying
In Hospital. The officers cooked their
guns and crept toward the spot. But
the negroes were on the alert. Wash
ington sprang TO his feet and dashed off
though the underground. A pistol shot
increased his speed. The officers, as
they ran, emptied their revolvers after
him, but the man seemed to bear charm
ed life. He reached the bottom of The
hill unharmed, and their met the
brother of the outraged girl, with three
friends. The negro hesitated a moment
then turned and ran almost into the
arms OF another party. Every gun in
the three parties was emptled toward
him, but he still managed to escape,
though not, as before, without wounds.
He was tracked by his blood to the river,
but there the trail was lost. Several
times during the day be was seen, but
when confronted by only one or two
men, he stopped and hurled large stones
at them with prodigious strength and
accuracy of aim. Once, when pres e |
bv crowd, he pulled of his coat and
shoes, aud after that LIE out tripped his
purSuers with ease. Tie coat was found
rdcl d with bu lets aid sat- ted with
blood.


So with Tuesday. The crowd still
kept close on his track, caught sight OF
him at intervals, fired at him without
avail, and then lost sight of him again.
Desperately wounded, lie had 10 Difficult
ty in outrunning the fleetesl of the hun
ters. One negro, who bore some resem-
blance 10 the man, escaped instant lynch
! ing only by tine intervention Of a white
neighbor who knew him. That night,
with singular Doldne-s, Washing ton
made his way into the city, doubtless
with the hope of escaping across the river
by the terry 10 Jeilersonville. The
police heard that he was in hiding in an
old arehouse by the levee, and made a
descent upon il. But the vigi ant wretch
saw them coming, ran into house nual
by, followed by pIs'ol shots, and again
escaped. That night he succeeded il
crossing into Indiana.


The excitement in Loui sville haC


spread to the neighboring cities, and lht


authorizes of Jefiersonville were on Tho


watch for the fugitive. On Thursday


morning he was seen on the outskirts o
the town and chased until lost sight of il
the woods. Toward noon he appeared a


the house of farmer some five mile
from the river. lie was lame, bloody, ant
, covered with dust. He asked for some


thing to eat, and the farmers two daugh

scoundrel's instincts seemed in no wis

MOUNT vRRNoN MOB.


An Evansville, ,srecial of Nov. Is, says


Mount Vernon, where the negroes were
recently lynched, has made bid for further
unpleasant notoriety. By request, the
Evansville Light Guards-one of our
leading military organizatiops-went to
that place last night to take part in a
ladies fair. Several col1red porters were
taken along to look after the baggage and
such matters, and these at oucs became the
objects Of vile abuse by mob of a dozen or
more men. No attention was paid to their
insulting remarks; and, evidently embold.
ened by this, the rascals made rush for
the colored boys just as the company was
leaving the hall for the depot. One fellow
approached one the porters threatsnir civ
when the latter pointed six shooter at his
head, compelling him to drop bowlder
which he had picked up. This excited the
mob to more aggressive action, and for a
time an engagement between the military
and the mob seemed unavoidable; but by
great coolness on the part of the former
bloodshed was avoided. As the mob made
a united rush upon the colored attend ants
Lieutenant William Warren stepped for
ward with drawn sword and threatened to
attack the scoundrels with his company il
they did not withdraw. Being fewer in
number and not 80 we'll armed as the com.
pany, they were evidently afraid to make
an attack, and finally Withdrew, sllowing
the military to depart without further
molestation."

SUMMONED TO EARTH By A BRooKLTs

assembled In the parlors Of . we'll

Hoyt street, Brooklyn, the intention


being to hold q ""dark seanee"" and sum.
mon the spirit Of Madame Restell 70
appear aud disclose the secret Of her
terrible death. Ever since the tragedy
rumor has been circulating ell kinds
OF stories In regard to the dead woman.
There are Thousands who believe
that the body found in the bath-tub
was 9 cAdaver procured for the Occa-
alon, and that the Madame is now In
comfortable quarters In Canada or on
her way to Europe, aud that the offer
OF her will for probate is merely q
blind to more efectually throw the au-
thorities of the scent Others, again,
hint at murder. They maintain that
she was killed by the relatives of some
woman who might be compromised
should she weaken on the witness
stand, and disclose some Of the secrets
OF her business.


The belief that she was foully dealt
With is especially prevalent among the
colored people, and several of them
have been scared half to death by see-
ing the dead womAn's ""spook"" peram-


bulsting around their dwellings, and
exhibiting the gaping wounds In her
throat. These simple, superstitious
creatures are loud In the expression Of
their opinion that she was murdered,
and that her spirit cannot rest until the
secret is revealed.


The argument on the part Of the


many Intelligent people who cling to


the murder theory, 10 thus: Here was q

detectives employed TO watch her we'll

Of liberty aud peace for the rest Of her

way during the rebellion for his active
loyalty on the floor of Congress- his brave
and wise counsels during that struggle, his
unrelenting hatred OF everything disloyal
and reasonable toward his country, and his
firm devotion to the principles and laws of
reconstruction, have all cOnspired to make
him unpopular with those who have
trained on the other side during the last
seventeen years. No rebel during the war,
no sympathizer with that side since the
war, no Southern man who has been trap
ping for the present Administration during
the past year, has any use for Mr., CHAND-
LER, for he has been, and still is, in their
way. They find him an obstacle to the full
accomplishment Of their sectional ends, and
he is not wanted in the public service by
such, whether they are located North or
South.

to policy which brings rebels and traitors
to the front, and puts Union men on the
back seats in public affairs. This fact was
too well understood to endanger his subiec-
tion to such an ordeal


But we can say TO our Lynchburg friend
and TO all others in his way of thinking
that just as often as conspiracies against the
welfare OF the Government come to the sur
tace-as often as the embers of rebellion are
) stirred into life-and as often as the princi-
pies oil reconstruction are trampled under
foot and the rights OF American citizens
cease to be respected and preserved in the
South-just so often the people will turn to
such true and tried statesmen and patriots
rs ZACH CHANDLER for counsel and aid to
bear them through the pending difficulties.
THE OUTLOOK IN SOUTH CAROLINA.


In the South Carolina State election of
1874 many were the murders and outrages
committed upon the helpless Republicans,
which, although they did not equal in
enormity the historic butcheries of Ham
burg and Ellcnton, yet they served to in
timidate the colored voters, and thus pre-.
vented their enjoyment of the freedom of
the ballot. As Edgefield County took the
lead in committing barbarisms in 1876, so
did she in 1874. Ruiiians in paint and in
disguise held high carnival at all the cleo
ton precincts in that county; even at Edge
field Court-HOuse the pistol and bowie
knife did their work, and Republicans were
driven into hiding places. 1t was in the
election Of 1874 that the murderer ToNEY
killed his first victim. ToNEY demanded
of one of his laborors that he vote the Dem
ocratic ticket, but the voter refused, when
ToNEY drew his pistol and shot him down.
As the wounded man lay upon the ground
in the agonies Of death, he raised aloft a
Republican ballot, and called upon by
stander to put it in the box for him. One
moro bullet from ToNEY's pistol did the
work, and the defenseless voter was dead


ToNEY made his escape and resided in
Georgia until the election of HAMPTON,
when he boldly returned to South Carolina.
Ono day Last wsak ha apraasea at Edsef.id
Court-House armed in formidable man
ner The warrant for his arrest, which had
long laid dormant, was given to Deputy
United States Marshal AUGUSTUS HARRIS,
colored, to serve. HARRIS had barely told
ToNEY that he was his prisoner when the
latter drew his pistol and shot him down.
The Associated Press dispatch from Column
bia speaks of this killing as having been
done in self-defense, but we are assured that
it was a case Of willful murder. This and
other recent outrages have occurred directly
under HAMPToN's nose, but that great and
good man"" has failed to utter word in pro-
test. Verify, our citizenship is snare and
q reproach.


AT recent election held in the newly
made county called Hampton, to determine
upon the location of the county site, the
Rifle Clubs held sway at the polls, and re-
fused to allow Republicans to vote, stating
that none but members of the Rifle Clubs
should cast ballots in that election.


There is this popularity about HAMp-
TONS administration. If Democrat kills
revenue officer, which occurs several times
year, the murderer is allowed to give bail,
and the case is always nOlYe-prossed But
when revenue official, in the discharge of
his duty, takes the life of an outlaw, he is
bounded down and lodged in Jail without
the privilege Of giving bail. Such was the
recent action of Judge KERsHAw, in the
case Of HUGH CANE who, in search of the
outlaw REDMOND, found it necessary to kill
a man named LADD, to save his own life.


Perhaps ii would be well for Mr.. GoRHAM
and the Congressional committee to be ad-
yised of the recent action of the South Car
olina Democratic County clubs, who have
freely resolved to allow no strangers"" to
come into their midst during the coming
campaign for the purpose of misleading
the negroes"" Northern statesmen, who
may design canvassing South Carolina dur
ing the coming campaign should be advised
of this action to the end that they may pro-
tect themselves in the premises.


Notwithstanding there is q clear Republi
can majority of 10000 votes in South Caro-
lima, such has been the terrorism and in
timidation practised in that State that the
Republicans have but little hope of electing
even two Congressman. The late amend
ments to the Constitution, and the supple-
iVBlSlttlou lltIttO are dead
letters in all of the Southern States; and
there appears to be but two courses for
Southern Republicans to pursue, to wit
either take their lives in their hands and
perish at the ballot-bOxes in defense of their
prerogatives as citizens, or retire from an
unequal contest, hcaping anathemas upon
the men who cOncocted the reconstruction
acts, but who lacked the decency and cour-
age to sustain them to their logical Sc
quences. To sum up, it is idle to suppose
that Southern Republicans can withstand
the elements which terrified loyal statesmen
In Congress before the war and which held
the Union forces in check for years. They
are led now by the same unscrupulous |
leaders who directed them during the war,
and their power to do wrong Is fully COM
with their willingness to do it.

persons,-composed mainly ofapplicants
for the official positions within the gift
OF the present Council, ana for positions
on the police force-assembles upon tue
pavement In front of the City Hall, in
order TO ""discuss the situation"" and to
be conveniently handy to those Council
men who drop in to the City Hall every
night. These appl cants are increasing
every day, the bulk OF them being de-
sirous of wearing the blue uniform of the
police, though not few would be plea
SEQ to take the positions that Council has
I'M rs power to bestuw.


For Chief of Police VIM. j. Maxwell
and Thomas j. Mellon are the applicants,
while Sergeant James Whalen would
hk. TO be promoted to the position, and
Chief O'Toole, 1t is presumed, would
have no objection to continuing in the
office.


John f. Dolan is applying for the ap-
polntment of Sergeant of the Western
District, while the friends of that most
excellent and competent officer, VIM
Jones, are urging Mayor Almond not


only to reappoinJ him, bpt TO make him
Sergeant of the Eastern District
Thomas Huey and Robert Chambers
are applying for appointments ON the
force from the First District, aud Edwin
Haines from the Third District There


are also other new applicants, while all


the members of the pi esent force would,


OF course, be pleased to retain their posi-
tons.


For Messenger at the Water Depart


ment John j. Heaiey and Eugene X.
Lynch are the principal applicants, with
about dozen others at their heels. This


position Is at present held by Robert F.
Wright.


For Chief Engineer the applicants are
Allen Ruth, Thomas Ford and FL. b. Nc
lntire, while Daniel Farra's friends are
urging him for the position. VIM. j.
Morrow, VIM. II. Lee and Edward Me-


Intire are candidates for Registrar, and
Thomas Blanken will doubtless succeed


James Crosby as engineer at the City
Mill.


James A. Plunkett would like to re-
turn to his old position of Assistant in


the Surveying Department. He was un-
| tremendously showed out by the Repub-
lican Council before the expiration of
his term of office, under the pisa that
there was no further need for his SER
vices; but the door had scarcely closed
behind him when A. Brack Starr, Re-
publican, was installed into the position.
MIR. Plunkett thinks it would be only an
| act of simple justice to restore him to the
place from which he was so unjustly
ousted.

Alex. McFall, Charles Clark, Walter Wesley,

The facts of the case are that the two wo-
men arc a bad set, and have scandalized tho
neighborhood in which they lived for years.
Some two years ago Mrs. Broeck's husband
committed suicide, and since then runner
has been busy in connecting her name with
his death. About the same time Mrs. Will
sons husband died. Soon an illicit intima-
cy sprung up between Mrs. Wilson and one
William Brock, who was married man,
bnt no relative of the other woman in the
case. They soon eloped, and intense indig-
nation prevailed, threats being freely made
that there would be q frst-class lynchlng 1t

Wilson returned, followed by her paramour.
They took up their residence with the wid-

while one Bud Davis, who had been about


the place at the time of Broeck's death,


had returned to the scene, after

more indignation.


| On the Tuesday night referred to the


house was visited by about fifty masked men


Who demanded admission. This was re-
fused and the door was battered down. The


women were taken and bound TO post, after


which their backs were laid bare from the


armpits down, and they were most cruelty
| scourged with hickory vithes. The cruel
whips were laid on until the blood ran down
! their backs in streams. The women both
fainted, and were then released. The men


left after warning all the victims OF the out


rage to leave. Mrs. Wilson and paramour


have left the country, but Mrs. Brock, who

stay and fight it out, and intends to have re-

F ALABAMA MOB EXECUTE LYNCH LAW
UPON TWO coLoRRD AND ONE WHITE
MAN. 9W .IGl A4s0@3


HuNrsvnLI, Ala, April Is, 1878.
Oa Saturday last two negroes, named Eph
Hall and Ben Evans, at the instigation Of
Mike White, white butcher, doing business
4, here, assassinated George shoeaberger, .
rival butcher and . most prominent and
pstimable citizen. At the time of their
arrest. which took place the same day,
great public indiga alton was manifested
and there was believed to be strong prob
a ability that all three Of the culprits would
meet prompt punishment at the hands of
tie angry mob. BY prompt and vigorous
aclioa Of the Sheriff and his deputies the
men were safely lodged in jail. This after.
noon the three men were forcibly taken
from the Sheriff's custody and hung from
the limb of tree, amid the most intense
excitement. Early this morning people
came In from every direction IN throngs,
By noon the streets, and especially those 10
the neighborheod of the jail, were literally
packed. The Sheriff, who had, by bis de-
cislvs action ON Saturday, prevented the
summary punish hnent of the assassins,
at .mpted to summon guards for the protec-
tion Of the jail, but none would accept the
positions. Twenty or thirty United States
prisoners being in tho jail, the nited States
Marshal summoned guards to keep them
safe.


1ts8"" ""HBRE THEY COME""


At half-past one P. N. the people shouted
I"" Here they como ~ and soon hundreds Of
hOrsemen arrived, armed with double
barrel shot gums. They came up quietly
and took positions around the jail. The
multitude fell back as they approached.
A demand for the keys of the jan was re-
fused and the Sheriff could not be found.
The jail fence was broken down with sledge
hammers and crowbars. The mob then
forced It's way into the jail by the same
prucess. Evans, Hall and White were
bound, placed In wagon, driven half .
mile away under the limb of tree, where
ropes had been previously adjusted. The
negroes reiterated the same story OF their
guilt that they had already told.


ALLEGATION OF INNOCENCE.


Mike White protested his innocence. The
prisoners were asked If they had anything
to say. White said he had nothing to say
except that he was innocent and ready to
meet bis God. ..~


ACCUSED BY HIS ASSOCIATES.


Evans said, 81 know am here to die.
We were all In it. Hall shot the gun and
shot the pistol'""f Turning to White he
said, ""see Mr.. White what you have
brought me to-"" Hall said he had nothing
to say other than what he had before stated
about his part In the assassination and
Whites instigation of It.


White said-""God b. with nay wife,""


PRAYERs-AND ROPE.


Then they were asked II they would like
to be pray for. White said ""No,"" but the
negroes requested Rev. Mr.. Gordon to offer
prayer, which he did. The wagon was
then driven from under them. They were
cut down In twenty-five minutes."

The Moral ~uasiOn Entertainment. n I.


The promised entertainment OF the
Moral Suasionists took place in their
hall last night, and was in every re.
sprct grand success. At six o'clo k
the audience began to assemble and af,
ter the seating and standing places
were occupied many were necessarily
turned away. Frank Whel.n, Third
Vice President, ably managed the af-
tair. all previous arrangements having
been perfected by the committee, con
sisting of Messrs. Whelen, sutton and
Lynch. The rostrum was filled up
with dressing rooms on each side. In
the centre two large flags were parted
from the top, making a fine effect.


We have not space to give the pro-
grammr in full or give each performer
the credit they Justly deserve at our
hands. Willie Brown, organist of Del.
aware Avenue church, presided at the
organ. Messrs. Groves and Geo. Hill
gave Irish character sketches and
songs. Messrs. Sammons and Heald,
darkry sketches with songs and instru-
m-nts. Prof. J. II. Crabb made hosts

shieIds' Library Ball.


The largest and best ball ever given
in this city, was enjoyed by 1877 couple,
Wednesday evening in Institute Hall.
The grand march commenced at 10
o'clock, led by Edward +, Kane and
Miss May Redding in very graceful
manner, followed by lsG couple, the
largest number ever known to join in a
grand march in Wilmington. The mu-
sic was furnished by Richie's orchestra,
and swiftly flying feet keep time to the
violin's most bewitching notes.


The ladies' programmes We're amongst
the handsomest ever printed, but un-
fortunately the supply fell short of the
demand. Others will. yet be printed
and sent to those who have not yet
been furnished with them. The S. l..
A. are t. be congratulated on their sue
Cess, and it but adds TO their deserved
reputation for good order, to say that
nothing whatever occurred to mar the

ing not alone upon few feet of Irish sod, but
shedding it's light wherever there is an lrlsh
heart to prize it or Irish home to enshrine 1t.


The pagans of st. Patrick's day received the
faith with love and veneratiou, so that no
martyrs blood was shed by barbarian hand
nor martyrs hear broken By barbarian perse'
cution. bat in the civilized days of Qoeen
Elizabeth AID later of Cromwell, Irish blood
wss poured out like rain upon the SOIL and
the names of Irish martyrs gathered thick and
fast upon the pages of the sixteenth and seven
teepth centuries.


Their names-at least large number mum.
Der of them-are recorded in this book, and
their heroic lives are given us as examples
worthy of perpetual remembrance.


We wish we could give the record of Very
Rev. Peter O'Higgins' martyrdom during the
reign of Charles I. How he was accused of
sedition, treason, ETC., and yet was offered
pardon and large gifts if he would but re
nounce his faith. How with this document in
his hand he stood on the first step of the gal
lows, aud nobly proved that it was only the
Catholic religion that in him was condemned
to death, and then freely rejecting the pro-
posai and throwing the paper to friend in
the crowd, went to eet his doom.


The names upon the cover are Brady, Cresgh,
Lynch, Moriarty, O.Brien, O'Hurley, ONeil,
O'Reilly, Plunket, Sheeby and Walsh, but
within the pages are host of glorious names
which, dear to every Catholic heart, ought to
be doubly so to every Irish heart."

Death of che Notorious Mrs. gherman and, Sketch of her Life.",,"Death of she Notorious Mrs. sherman and a | Sketch of her Life.

 Lydia Sherman, the Derby poisoner, died in the Connecticut State prison. She was serving a life sentence for poisoning her husband. She was little over 50 years of age, having been born in Burlington, N. J., in 1924. Her life was one of the most remarkable in the criminal annals of the country.

 Even after having poisoned nine per l sons, two husbands and seven children, Mrs. Sherman was not suspected, but was viewed as model wife and mother. After her third husband, Horatio N. Sherman, died in Derby in 1871, his physician sent his stomach to the chem ist of the Yale Scientific School. Soon afterwards she was arrested, and she 1 laughed when the officer told her what his mission was. Her trial in 1872 ex- cited great interest throughout the coun- try. She was the coolest person in the court room. Her eldest son continued in attendance upon her throughout it all, and did not doubt, until it was over, that his mother was innocent. When the verdict, Guilty of murder in the second degree, was announced she made some commonplace remark and quietly sat

 down. One of the jurors said that had it been man on trial the verdict would have been in the first degree. r@

 While she was in the New Haven county jail for some months previous to the beginning of her prison life, she was treated with kindness by MT. Webster, the iailer, who attributed her conduct to monomania. For his kindness to her she wrote out the confession, an abstract of which is published below. It was re- ceived with amazement, and given as 6 proof of her insanity. Investigation, however, proved the truth of all she had said. After the revelations had been read there was some talk of hanging her by lynch law, and shewas speedily taken to the State prison. During the writing of the confession Mrs. Sherman talked of it with as much unconcern as if it was some simple business matter. In speak | ing of the incidents her face never paled, her voice never quivered, and she would say, 1T gave him arsenic"" or 1T put arsenic in his tea,"" or s'little Ann Eliza was better off after she took the arsenic. "" At this time, too, she declared that she had ''given herself to Christ, land main tained the role of a penitent Christian.

 In 1877, after she had served four years of her time, one morning when the cell door was open Mrs. Sherman es- capped, but was captured at the Central Hotel at Providence seven days after her escape. The Matron had been late in her last visit to the cells, and the thought of escape came to her like an inspira- ton. She arose and dressed herself, stepped into an unlocked eel, that was used for stateroom, and when the mat ron went to the kitchen followed her, secreting herself in corner. From this place she readily got ont by the main entrance, and losing her way to the de- pot, walked about until the early morn ing train for Springfield. She had $3O with her $10 she had earned by doing fancy work, and $20 had been given he1 by a convict to whom she had done a kindness. She bought some garments in Springfield, and went from there to

 Worcester, and at length to Providence. At Providence she became quite intimate with the landlady of the Central Hotel, and her mother, who recommended hel as 8 housekeeper to widower. Before any arrangement could be made the mother suspected who their guest WAS, and reported the matter to the police. A detective called upon her and she sup posed it to be the widower. In the con versation mention was made of Mrs Sherman and her escape. She had mol heard of it, and on being told that she looked great deal like her, she replied that it was incredible, for she was Mrs Moore, of Philadelphia. She made nc objection to being taken to the station house, A despatch was sent to the War den of the prison, and @ deputy came immediately for her. As his eyes rested upon her, he exclaimed, '"" Caught a last P She expressed herself as very glad to return, and begged the deputy

 to take her ""home"" immediately."

taken out of the water rights now used


by 1t, this would only lessen the power


about one-fourth. For use in the com
parsion of cost which we wish to lay be-
fore you we have estimated that the re-


naming three-fourths of the power
would rent for ST 900 year.


If Eve add to the amount which we
have proposed to chasge, $4,000 the sum
which we have estimated would com-
pensate the owners of the water powers
below here e-other than the city-(S1.25)
IT will show the probable cost to the city
for water taken from this place, for
pumping and water rights to be $6.25 per


million gallons.


In regard to the cost of pumping from
the present station, it appear. from the
report of the department in 1877 that the
running expenses of the water power
pumps-exclusive of repairs--amounted
to S252 for each million of gallons pump
ed, there being about 380,000,000 gallons
raised during the year. This was to the
Market street reservoir the surface of
which is, we believe, about 120 feet above
tide water. The Cool Spring Reservoir
is aoout 20 feet higher. The water power
will. of course not lift as much water to
the new basin. 1t tseems large estimate,
but say it will raise 365, 100000 gallons
year, and the total costs of pumping
million gallons from tide water with the
present pumping machine will be 50.


In both cases this is exclusive of inter-
est on the cost of the property used.
With the water po wer thus is about three
tunes the running expense, and with the
steam machinery we believe about equal
to them, exclusive in both cases of the
cost of the pumping main. The allow
ance for repairs does not provide for re-
placing worn out machinery.


ha nj hot . tIa
city would have to incur should it accept |
our proposition, would be that of laying |
pipes from the Cool Spring r eservoir |
to this place. The distance is about one |
and one-half miles. We do not see after |
making some irquiry, that it would be |
likely to cost more than 200 to lay a |
thirty inch main. The interest on that |
amount at 5per cent. is S2,500. We have |
estimated that the city's unused water
power will rent for 81 900; deducting i
this from the interest charge, leaves ST.
800 year.


1t seems likely that the city will use
water at the rate of 1,25O, ,000. 900 of gal |
Ions year by the time the arrangem ent !
we have proposed could be carried out. |
way as at resent, 81 ,682 % under our
proposal, at an estimate, of So 20 per gal |
Ion, the cost would be 81 ,812 30; and de-
Quoting the annual charge for interest,
less rent for unuSued water power, the
saving per year would be 1859 10. And |
increasing the estimate of consumption
to 500, 100000 gallons per year, the an |
nual saving, by the same process, would |
be 81 ,542 %.


This will increase as the quantity of |
water increases and if the water power |
at Rockford has to be supplemented by
steam power, the cost OF machinery as
well as running expenses will be much |
less than if the work should be done by |
increased machinery at the present loca- |
ton; as the hight of lift will not be |
much more than half as great.


This shows, we think, that there would /
be saving in the cost of the water sup
very great One-besides
the advantages of getting better wdter, of
net hdu,nq to protect At by se,oers and also
II the present steam machinery and
pumping main should be allowed, for a
while, to remain where they are, of hav-
ing-we may say without cost-the ad-
v antage of second pumping station in
in case of accident.

Mr.. Maxwell called up for third read
ing the ordinance entitled an ordinance
increasing the police force.


The first section of the bill provides
for tho appointment of four sergeants
in place of two as at present.


Mr.. Norton objected to the section he
could not see where four sergeants were
needed the position is mere nominal
one, as the officers do not have anything
to do but walk from the City Hall to
Fourth and Market streets, and get the
report of the men, and then walk back
to the City Hall and ""nap"" the rest of
the time. Why the sergeant should go
around on the beat and meet his men
and not take them all off the beat to
meet him at one point. What are the
other two to do? The sergeants now
nap around the hall, and act as Chief of
Police, Mayor and everything else.


Mr.. Maxwell, IN reply, said that the
gentleman charges the sergeants as act
ng Chief of Police and Mayor. What
hey previously did he knew nothing
lhout, but since September 9th John +.
had been Mayor.


Mr. McGlinchey moved to amend the
section by striking out call"" after the

CHARGES IN SOUTH CAROLINA AND IMPRISONED
A LACK OF WITNESSES IN THE ELECTION CASES


POSSIBLE.


WASHINGTON. Nov. 2i.-The following letter was
received to-day from of the most prominent
Government officers in South Carolina:


Unless some method devised to prevent further ar
rests the State authorities OF the witnesses In the
election cases am afraid when the United States Court
in Columbia next Monday there will be no wit
nesses there TO testify against those charged with viola
tions of the election laws 1t is becoming more aud more
apparent every day that the Democrats OF this State
inteod to use the whole power of the State
GOvernmenJ in shielding and protecting the ballot
box suffers. Notwithstanding three of the present
Democratic Circuit judges Of this State have former
occasions decided In involving no political ques-
tion that for perjury committed before Uuled States
Commissioner Court Of the United States. person
cannot be held to answer the State Courts,
vet In violation Of this decision OF their own
Judges the Democratic Trial Justices throughout
the State are arresting and committing to jail t1s
Witnesses Bound the United States Court, on the
charge having committed perjury before the United
States Commissioners. In Williamsburg County every
witness bound to the United States Court has been
arrested on that charge. In Darlington, the witness
making the affidavit upon which the warrant was Issued
was arrested for PERJURY before the preliminary exam
nation could held. In Oiner counties the same thing
IS being done.


To prevent the issuing of any warrants the
Democrats are trumping up charges against the COM
missiOners themselves There are only five commits
sioners the State who taking any action against
the men who stuffed the ballot-boxes and defed the
supervisors and marshas election day. OF these
hye Messrs. Lee and Virgins have already been
arrested and committed TO Jail by the
State authorities. Against Mr. Virgins, who was
formerly of the Circuit Judges, the Democrats have
invented frivolous charge viz, that he accepted
brbe of $50 from somebody three years ago. Mr. Lee
has been arrested and ncarceraed in JAIL charged with
the offence Of falling keep his Office Of Judge of
Probate which position he holds in addition to that Of
Commissioner. The circumstances of this are as
follows: About week ago, while in his office taking
testimony in regard 10 tue frauds committed In SUN
ter at the late election, he was attacked by a
crowd Of Democrats and narrowly escaped WITH his ie
The crowd demanded that he should leave Sumter,
else resign as commissioner. He Charleston to
procure the arrest OF his assaants. Upon his return,
after having been driven away, Democratic lawyer
made an affidavit before Democratic Trial Justice,
charging Lee with failing to keep his Office open. The
absurdiiy Of the whole matter is that there is DO law
requiring hin to keep his Office open at all times, and
even If there was, his failure to open his office for two
days would render him liable 10 criminal prosecu-
tion.


But law or TO law It is the determination Of the Dem
ocrats 10 punish every person who takes part what
ever In the crimes with which they
charged whether that person BET witness Commissioner
or Prosecuting Attorney Judge LudelngSs remark. In
regard TO Louisiana that the witnesses and the inno-
cent are the punished and nOtthe cuprts

Especial to the Transeript.l


New CASTLE, DEL, March %, 1878.


To-day Samuel Chambers and Gee.
Collins we're hanged BY the neck Gun
il dead,' in the Jail yard, at New Cas-
tie. The particulars Of


THE CRIME


for which these two men suffered the
death penalty to-day, is familiar to the
greater portion Of our readers, the out
rage having been committed within
halfmile Of Middletown.


Mrs. Kate Smith, in company with
her husband, started down the State in
search Of work in some Of the numer-
GUS peach orchards. It appears they
had heard they would be likely to get
grnpI0y = = Round Round Top Top, Nd, Nd and
desired to reach that locality. They
reached the neighborhood Of Middle
town on the afternoon Of August 18th,
1877. They we're accosted by the two
negroes who were hauling peaches to
the depot, on the road leading west
from the town, when conversation
took place between the parties, the
tramps making inquiry in regard to
to where they could obtain work, and
the negro Chambers agreeing to take
them where they would find employ
ment. The negroes then proceeded
across field, followed by the Smiths,
and when corn-feld had been reach
ed, some distance from the public road,
the white man was Knocked down and
the woman hustled further into the
corn-feld where the crime was perpe-
trated.


THE ARREST


was made on the same evening the
crime was committed. Mrs. Smith
positively identified Chambers as one
Of the negroes who had committed the
outrage, but she was doubtful in regard
to the identity Of the younger negro,
Collins, and he was discharged, and
Chambers taken to New Castle. It
is said there was lynching move
ment on foot, which was only frustra-
ted by the shrewdness Of Officer r 9th
well, who started with his prisoner at
an unexpected hour.


On the following Saturday some new
facts in the case we're brought to light,
when Collins was re-arrested and made
full confession Of the guilt Of himself
and Chambers, and was also conveyed
to New Castle jail. The Smiths were
held as witnesses.


THE TRIAL


took place at the November term Of
Court, when the negroes we're ably de-
Tended BY J. L. Vsllandigham. Cham
bers was tried as the principal, and
Collins as an accessory, and although
the confession Of the latter was not ad
mitted as evidence, they were convict
ed, and sentenced to suffer the death
penalty on Friday, March 22d.


SOME NEW DEVELOPMENTS
we're brought out a few weeks ago,
when number Of Wilmington gentle
men interested themselves in the case,
and employed a detective to work the
matter up. Smith was also brought on
10 New Castle charged with perjury, he
having stated that he swore falsely in
regard to being married to the woman
upon whom the outrage had been com
mitted. The law not being such as to
hold Smith on the above charge he was
finally discharged, but the gentlemen
who had interested themselves in the
condemned negroes continued to work
the case up, and On Saturday last held
a conference with Gov. Cochran, at
Middletown, for the purpose Of


ASKING FOR A PARDON
for the doomed men. j. Z. Vallan-
digham, Henry W. Morrow and John
A. Myers, the detective, were present,
also Attorney General Pennington and
Magistrate Naudain. The Governor
heard the merits Of the case and care
fully consulted the papers submitted
to him, but after thorough investiga-
tion decided that the law must take its
course, and 50 informed the Secretary
Of State o. Wednesday, who, We learn,
communicated the facts to Mr.. Nor
row, and that gentleman, in company
with friend, Immediately went over
to New Castle for the purpose Of


BREAKING THE NEWS
to the condemned men. Chambers re
ceived the news Of his doom with no
perceptable change Of countenance,
while Collins shed tears and was much |
Both continued to protest
their innocence.


A number Of prominent gentlemen
from Wilmington again visited Mid
dletown, On Thursday, and held con
ference with the Governor at the Ma
tional Hotel. The object Of their visit
was to obtain a respite for the con
demned men, but this they failed to
Do, and we are informed that the Gov
ernor soon convinced them that his de- |

Germany before the attempts to aSsassinate hersov

Such was the Kultar HamPf !. e., the fight between
the German Government and the Roman
Church. Another was the socialstic agitation,
A third was the stagDatiOn of trade. general de-
preston was the consequence, ard an agitation to
bring about better times by protection duties, by
the introduction of laws long since abolished, as
for instance, Imprisonment for debts, usuIy laws,
police supervision and interference in trade.
Indeed, young Germany was very leaky, and, before
foreigners even suspected it, in lather critical
condition. Then came the two shots. IL was an
explosion. But no disaster followed i'm

much, perhaps because a sovereign who had least

A prcttier day for the playing Of game Of
base ball than that Of yesterday could not have
been wished for by any advocate Of the sport,
and q prettier exhibition Of the beauties Of
this pastime has never been seen on the Ma.
tiOnnl grounds, in this city, than was witnessed
there yesterday.


1t would seem as II the advent Of Gerhardt
into the nine had infused new strength into
the members and brought out that ability to
hcld and bat that IL was believed thCy pos.
sessei, but which 1t seemed impossible to bring
into service. Since their reorganization marked
Improvement Is noticeable, aud they now play
not only decent but sstonishingly strong
game.


Since the arrival Of the Manchesters large
crowds have attended the grounds, and their
comments are very hattcring to the home nine,
and gives them encouragement to continue
their skillful playing.


II Is safe TO say that no ninc has covered
themselves with more glory than did the Ma.
tiOnal yesterday, and that, too, In game Of
faultless fielding. In the entire eight innings
not an error was cnargeable on their side, and
| the honors for 1t must be equally divided
among the players. The principal work was
| performed In the In.ncld, but Baker sustained
| his reputation rs an out-iellcr by making n
| brilliant long running catch. At the bat he
was a power aud every time he stepped to the
home plate another base.hit was predicted and
| the prcdictiIn confirmed, until Lcary became
disgustcd and permitted him to go to his base
on called balls evidently prcfcrring to give
one rather than take the chances of losing two.
Houck kept close on him with basc.hits, but in
fielding had but one chance, which was ac-
ccptcd. The plaudits from the audience at the
fine exhibition the National continued to make
throughout the game ought to have convinced
them that their friends appreciated the bGauti.
ful display aud were wi ling to give positive
proof of II.


The Mauchesters came forth In strength aud
determination to win sphere. They worked
hard and presistently, but while they kept
their opponents score down they met worse
treatment from their adversarics, who only
permitted one poor Manchester boy 10 reach
his second base, and no further did one ever
get lie must have felt sOrely, for he only
tarried few minutes on the spot aud then
withdrew, the side being out.


Lynch pitched with uncommon speed and
stcadincss aud proved too much for the New
EuglanGcrs, who admitted that he bothered
them more than any pitcher they have met
with this season. Appended is the score;"

A newspaper correspondent, who",,"A newspaper correspondent, who has been in Richmond, Va., speaking of the bell register used in liquor saloons, says that the plan seems to work we'll. The farmers favor the tax because it removes burden from their shoulders The officials favor it on the ground that it promotes public morals and gets tax out of people who never paid one. One man termed it the best temperance law that had ever been drawn. The liquor dealer backs it because it does away with the credit system, and the indicator acts as a check upon his bartender, for the amount of money in the drawer must tally with the register. In every case liquor sellers claim that their receipts have been increased. A proprietor in Richmond told me that his gain in re- ceipts for the first eighteen days was $39.5O. In Culpepper a hotel keeper claimed that through the decrease in the credit system, it raised his receipts 600 per cent. Of course, the dealers have raised the price of whisky from ten to fifteen cents glass. If man takes a drink alone he pays bis fifteen cents, thus giving two and one-half cents to the State, and adding @ like sum to the profits of the seller. If two take drink together they get it for twenty-five cents, the State in this case receiving the extra five cents. If man treats two persons besides himself, he pays forty cents, the State getting seven and one-half cents, and the seller an additional profit of 1 two and one-half cents. For every odd drink the liquor dealer secures this extra profit, and it would be singular indeed If he should revile law that puts money in his pocket. Besides this, it keeps bummers away from his saloon, and en- tirely stops the credit system for man must have hard cheek who asks another to pay two and one-half cents for the privilege of trusting him. So much for the dealer. The bartender is satisfied, probably because the law gives him an opportunity to '' knock down"" the

 extra two and one half cents without fear

 of detection.

 The law is enforced as strictly as the

 circumstances will permit, but some

 dealers have been indicted for attempts

 to evade it. In Norfolk indictments are

 pending for direct violations. It is thought that there is some cheating in

 Petersburg and Lynchburg, but in Bev'

 erly Douglas Congress District it is said

 to work to a charm. A prominent pro

 prietor in Lynchburg made his returns

 at the end of the first month. The

 assessor analysed the figures, and found

 that they turned out only two drinks {

 day. He mentioned the matter to the

 seller, saying that there must be some

 mistake, as he knew.hi saloon was on' of the most popular in the city. Th'

 proprietor colored and threw the blam'

 on his bartenders. He declared that the, must have mjsapprehended the terms o

 the law. After privately examining then

 he struck the bell of the alcoholic regis , ter 500 times, and thus added $125O t the months tax. The assessor accepte the figures and the collector got tn

 AOACJs AAO OPOA0G1OAo LII b40 uOuUA license as retail dealer and keeper of barroom gives dishonest men an oppol

that you would adopt the plan euggested by
the Most Reverend Aroh bishop of Cincinnati,
and address to the clergy and laty of your
respective dioceses a similar circular.


We trust that your Lordships will grant
this request, which we urge solely in the name
and for the honor of our Lord and of His
Sacred Heart, which spent for those abandoned
souls the last drop of its blood.


United with you in the same Divine Heart,
we remain, Most Reverend Archbishops your
devoted brothers.

 Prescott and Gillett stage, who arrived ID

 town just as we were going to press:

 It appears that the man Setwright had q

 misunderstanding with some one in saloon

 and in moment of frenzy, caused by an overdose of liquor, struck the party w h q bottle knocking him down, for witch of- fense Deputy Sheriff Burnett arrested Set wright. MT. Weir, peaceab.e gentleman. wishing to befriend Setwright, volunteered to take charge of him and was allowed to do SO. He took his charge and started from the saloon, intending to put him to bed for the right. but had not proceeded over one hun ed yards on his mission of kindness before Setwright pulled pistol, and p'ac- ing the muzzle at the head of MT. Weir, discharged the same killing his would be friend instantly.

 The murderer immediately took to flight followed by several persons who soon cap tured him. During the tune intervening between the killing of Weir and the capture of the murderer, the law-abiding citizens of Gillett concluded that a cottonwood limb was the proper place for Setwright and to that end procured rope and proceeded to where the parties were with their man, for the purpose of carrying out their program me, viz: lynching the fiend who had killed a good and peacesble citizen

 Col. L. c. Taylor, who was the party that made the arrest, stepped from behind a house, on the approach of the excited crowd, and asked them to spare Setwright. The indignant party who were bent on averaging the death of Weir, then and ther, in little shooting and Taylor was shot through the shoulder, rom the effects Inf which he expired in fsw moments. Sethwright was then hung by citizens present. These are the circumstances as near as we could learn them Tn our hurried interview with Mir. Levalley.

 Samuel Weir was we'll known and good citizen of this counry, enterpris ing ana law abiding. and his death will be universally regretted. His mother, Mrs. M B. Weir, resides at Sreels Tavern, Agust County, Va., where it was his intention to return, on ! visit, during the coming season. He was luire extensively engaged in freight. ing, with ,x teams, at Gillett, and elsewhere, and had what he considered fair show to wind up his fall with sufficient means to return to his nd home and make his motnera handsome present., as he remarked to the writer of this ] few weeks ago."

HAxPsrgaD IrEMs.-During the week we
have had visit from Capt. A. W. Eichel-
berger and L. f. Melsheimer, the President
and Secretary Of the Baltimore and Hanover
railroad. They passed over the line Of road
ferent sections they expressed themselves as
being well pleased with the progress Of the
work, which is now being conducted by Jos.
s. Git, engineer, who has succeeded our es-
teemed friend, Col. W. w. Taylor, whose
genial society we miss, he having resigned
his position here to take charge in the con-
slructi0n Of railroad in that State dear to us
Marglanders-the Old Dominion. The Col.
has left many warm friends here, and we feel
confident that he will be equally as well ap-
preciaied in the 'tSunny South TO which he
has departed.


The work Of laying track has been COM
menced at the junction with Bachman Valley
railroad and will be rapidly pushed forward
AS FAR as H0ffacker's Min, when It is contem-
plated to run trains from Hanover to that
point Il is expected that trains viii run to
Hoifacker's Mill by the lst of September next


The farmers here, as well as all over the
county, have had excellent weather TO secure
the abundant crops with which they have been
favored.


The temperature, notwithstanding few re-
freshing showers, has been rather warm for
very dignifed persons.


Quite Eumber Of persons escaped from
the heat Of the city are enjoying the pure air
and elevation Of our village.


A Pleasant ExcURsIox.-The excursion
Of the Knights of Pythias to Hayre de Grace,
on Saturday last, by Western Maryland Rail
road and the Steamer Pentz, was one Of the
most pleasant of the season. The day was
fine, and the trip by rail and steamer was in
every way agreeable. Capt kirwin, of the
Steamer Pentz, is a great favorite with the
travelling public. His polite attentions to
his guests on the occasion contributed largely
20 heighten their enjoyment. The National
Grays Band, under the lead of Capt. Ellis,
accompanied the excursion, and there was no
stint OF their enlivening airs. AS the boat
glided gracefully over the placid bosom of the
Chesapeake, the excursionists enjoyed the
scenery upon either shore of the bay, and
upon Pool S and Speseutia Islands, with the
keenest zest. At Havre de Grace an hour or
two was spent in social converse with its eiti-
zens and IN rambling through the town. At
the hour of starting large crowd had assem-
bled on the wharf, and as the steamer re-
sumed her homeward journey the band struck
up lively air, and hats and handkerchiefs
waved parting adieux. At Q o'clock the ex-
cursiOnists were home again, with unanimous
81 rs.H
not quite two hundred, not sufficient to cover
expenses Of the trip. The Knights conse-
quently incurred some pecuniary loss. Ice
cream cake, lemonade and other delicacies,
were served by Mr.. Carl Wiekert. The best
order was maintained throughout.


REUxI0v.-The second annual reunion of
the alumni and students of the Pennsylva-
mia College resident In the Southern States
was held at Hagerstown on Wednesday. At
the business meeting the officers were re-
elected, viz Judge John A. Lynch, of
Frederick, president; II. H. keedy, Esq, of
Hagerstown vice-president; J. Nc. Scott, N.
D., Of Hagerstown, secretary, and Prof p.
NJ. Bikle, of Gettysburg, Pa, treasurer.
Letters expressing regret for inability TO at
tend were read from Nj. Valentine, ID. D.,
president of Pennsylvania College; Rev. J.
a. AIUWAf BA-A W. - ~ OtAiOAF H.
D., Of Virginia; Rev. c. w. Knauif, of Loui-
siana, and others.


A discussion on the s'Relations existing be-
tween public schools and colleges followed.
The speakers we're C. V. S. Levy, of Freder-
ick, and Prof J. r. Dimm, of Lutherville.


The subject for discussion at the next meet
ing is THE influence of colleges in coun-
teraeting and oSerihrowing scientific infdeli-
iy,"" and the speakers selected are ). D.
Sehmucker, of Baltimore, and Rev. ID. NJ.
Gilbert. OF Winchester, Va. The orator for
next year is G. NJ Beltzhooyer, Esq, of
Shepherdstown, w. Va.


Ia the afternoon an Grafton was delivered
by Hon. John f. Smith, Of this city, which
was highly commended.


The reunion will be held next year in this
city, on Wednesday, July l6.


INCREASE or CAPITAL STocK.-A meeting
fthe stockholders Of the Taylor Manufactur-
ing Company, this city, was held on Tuesday
last, at which more than two-thirds of the
stockholders were present or represented.
The object Of the meeting was for the purpose
Of taking action looking to an increase of the
capital stock from S2O,000 to S120,0OO, and
it was unanimously adopted. We learn that
more than one-half Of the increased capital
stock has already been subscribed. This will
enable the Company to I'll their orders with
greater rapidity, as up to that day they were
behind very much. Few, If any, manuiaetur-
ing enterprises in this country have met with
such success as this Company. Starting in

about $3.50 o'clock on Sunday
night, on the arrival of the train
from Palisade, Ed. Rickar, con-
ductor on the Eureka and Palisade
Railroad, was shot by ALI. Chartz,
one of the lessees of the Eureka
Republican newspaper. The diff
Guilty occurred in front of the
International Hotel, just as the
bus drove from the depot. Rickars
was on the bus, and Chartz seems
to have been lying in wait for him.
The difficulty grew out of personal
items In the Republican, which
were distasteful to Rickar. AS the
bus drew up, Rickar, who was on
the outside, jumped to the ground.
He was Immediately accosted by
Chartz and some words passed
about the settlement of the
affair. Rickar said, 81 will settle it
right here"" and began to take off
his coat, when Chartz drew his
pistol and fired, the ball taking eff
feet in the left breast and lodging
in the spinal column. The wounded
man is still alive but the doctors
say he must die. Chartz ran to the
jail and gave himself up. There is
universal indignation and strong
talk of lynching. Sheriff Sears
keeps the Jail closely watched.
Rickar was one of the most popu-
lar men in the county and had no
weapons of any kind when shot
down. The officers threaten to ar
rest other parties as accessories TO
the crime."

receive his trial there; and that, in order


thereto, his majesty had sent bis commands


to the Governor of Virginia to deliver him


to Captain Allen, commander of SAID ketch


who is to bring him over.''


This letter was received on the 7th of


october, 1885, nearly year after the un-


fortunate occurrence upon the Quaker


ketch. Talbot was therenpon sent under


guard to the Governor Of Virginia, where


he was tried for the murder of Rousby on


the 22nd of April, 1856 He was con-


victed, but his kinsmel, the Lord Proprie


tary, no doubt seconded in his efforts to
( that end by Dick Talbot, who, probably,
! was a still nearer knsman of the culprit
/ than he, was prepared for the emergency
and had obtained pardon for him, which


he had transmitted to Virginia before the


conclusion of the trial.


| OF Talbot's history, subsequent to his
! trial, we have not been able to learn any
thing. The only writer that to our knowl-
| edge has ever investigated the subject was


of opinion that he was required to go to
! England in order to receive his pardon


there. This is improbable, because it was


unnecessary. 1t is very probable, though


not positively certain, that he returned to
! his manor after he received his pardon. for


we find deed upon record in the Clerks


office. in Elkton, which was executed by


him in 1857.


! The deeds that were written two hun
dred years ago are very curious documents.
| The conveyanceTs of that time never left
practical method of putting in it, hence
they contain many curious covenants and
provisions, This deed from George Talbot
to Jacob Young, for the tract of land called


Clayfall, contains much valuable historical
information in regard to the manners and
customs Of the early settlers upon Susque-


hanna manor. From it we learn that the
land called Clayfall had been granted by
Lord Baltimore to certain Francis Wright.


some time previous to the date of Talbot's
grant-the year is not stated, and that he
died and left no heirs, in consequence of
which the land escheated 10 the Lord Pro
prietary who had not claimed it, and thai
Snsquehauna manor, which included Clay
fall, having been in the meantime granted
to Talbot, he by this deed, conveyed it to
one Jacob Young, in consideration of the


Iron work of Sweeds mill, 200 young
apple trees now growing near the present
dwelling house of the said Young 4 lastly
for and in consideration of bargain and
sale which the said Young promiced to
make to me and my heirs forever for 5s


sterling of ye seat of mill that he for
merly caused to be built al the head OF


Piny creek vulgarly called Mill creek in ye
county Il manor aforesaid & fifteen acres
OF land contiguous to ye said mill seat, &C.
This mill was on the creek that is yet called
Mill creek and probably Jacob Young had
settled at the head of that creek before
Talbot obtained his grant. However this
may have been, this is the first mill we
find mentioned in the early history of the
county. No doubt it was a water mill,
The Sweed's mill, the iron work of which
is mentioned in the deed as part of the
consideration, was probably hand mill.


In the grant of Clayfall, ""all mines OF
metals, waits, cstrays, wild unmarked
horses, mares, colts. neat cattle & hogs OF
all sorts are excepted. and yearly rent of
los. sterling was to be paid by Young and
his heirs at ye Rock of Essenewee alias
Il pj, ot va fol Of P,,ly
Principio creek in ye manor aforesaid, or
lst day of October yearly & every yeaI
forever"" Then came the proviso, that
Jacob Iouug u all his heirs and assigns
time forever to yc mill or mills of me Vt
said George Talbot my heirs & assigns
upon or near adjacent to ye said manor to
be there ground all ye matt & bread, corn
that shall be spent by the families inhabit.
ing or resident upon any part of Clayfall
aforesaid, except snch times as they shall
not he in good running condition.


Young also covenants not 10 erect any
mill upon Clayfall and Talbot reserves the
right to demolish any mill that Young
might erect there. And Young agrees to
attend court when required and to do such
suit "" service to and ye said court as i
customary 4 usual on manors in England


This instrument of writing is of great
length and covers six pages of the book in
which it is Ieco, ded and concludes with
proviso which indicates, as do several other
hings mentioned in it, that the parties had
out little faith in each others honesty, for
The whole thing was to be void if Young
dug up and carried away the two hundred
young apple trees. 1t is very hard to con-
ceive how anything else could have been
incorporated in this deed, or bow stronger
or better one could have been made, but
Talbot covenants to make Young another
one, such his counsel, learned in the law,
might suggest, but he was not to be com
PEELED to go more than twenty miles from
the manor to execute it. This curious doc
ument is dated June TO- 1857, and is signed
by George Talbot and witnessed by Henry
Brent, James Lynch and Thomas Grunwin

there is no doubt, was at or near where the
iron works of George p. Whitaker are now
located, and no doubt that is where Talbot's |
honse or castle then stood.


What became of Talbot after the execu-
ton of this deed we are unable to say. 1t
is probable, though, that he returned to his
native country and the fact that royal
order was sent to the Lord Proprietary in
the reign of Charles the H., commanding
him to dismiss all Catholics from office in
the province, and because the reign of the
vacillating and superstitious James was
few years subsequent TO this time brought
TO a disastrous end by the prowess ard
courage of William of Orange that Talbot
retired in disgust from Maryland. There
is reason to believe that in some way Talbot
forfeited his right to Susquehanna manor
some time between the years l723-30.

office which was made in 1910, for PA

Letter from Samuel Townsend",,"For the Gazette.


Mr.. JoHNsoN:-I sent you few lines,
last Friday, concerning the rape case
last summer, or early fall, near Middle
town. In the Philadelphia Times, the
Benedict Arnold newspaper, there is a
communication, purporting to come from
Middletown, but the writer showed his
ignorance of Delaware, when he stated
that Governor Cochran prefers his own
country home, near Middletown, to the
Executive Mansion at Douer. This of
| itself showed the Ignorance of the fellow
in regard to Delaware, for Delaware has
not, nor never had an Executive Man
sion at Dover. He further says old Sam
Townsend, the war horse of Appoquni-
mink hundred, says the negroes must be
hung. l am no war horse, and not 80
old but what ] can tell the writing of a
jackass squirt. In regard to the Cochrans
they are an industrious, honest set of peo-
pie, and respected by both white and
black people in the neighborhood where
they reside. There is not, think, a man,
woman or child in this part of Delaware,
who wish to see or hear ofpersons being
hung; and all this abuse in the Philadel-
phia papers IL because the people in
Delaware, near Middletown, meted out
Ijustice, to two lonely, y,poor white tramps,
that had neither money or friedns, and
further did not belong to our State
They were in all but a starving condition

negroes, who promised to find them Q

persons, one q man and the other wo

said has always been bad negro, knock

woman short distance and committed
rape, then returned to the half dea6


white man, and held him whilst Collin.


also committed rape. These two white
persons, man and wife, went into Middle


town, the mans head cut, his clothes


bloody, the woman's clothes torn and sh'

Townsend, March 10, 1873."
6_1878-09-05_p3_sn84027718_00271763839_1878090501_0169,Connecticut western news.,01,1878-09-05,p3,,,"| Henry O. Williams of New Britain has re.

 gently invented steam heater to hatch eggs

 which operates quite satisfactorily. The eggs

 by his method are kept at 101 deg. Farenheit,

 and the amount of heat is regulated by cleo. tricity.

 In the Superior Court at Hartford last

 week Judge Beardsley decided to hear the ar.

 guments on demurrer of defendants counsel

 in the Charter Oak Life Insurance conspiracy

 cases on Thursday, September 5. It is expect

 ed that the arguments will occupy about three

 days.

 The terms of imprisonment of William AL len and Henry Hamlin for burglary at New

 London in 1871. will expire respectively on September 29 and October 15. But on tho ex-

 piration of their sentences they will be romov-

 ed to the Hartford jail tu await trial for the

 murder of Watchman Shipman.

 A man is travelling about the state and featuring on temperance, who is unable to re-

 sist strong drink himself. He is said to have

 led the class of '60 at the Yale law school, and

 he is accompanied in his wanderings by his

 aged mother, who urges him to speak against

 the evil which is dragging him down, hoping that he may yet be reformed.

 The people of Willimantic, New London and the intervening towns have been victimi- zed during last week by sharper, who passed himself off as the advance agent of the Guy family of opera singers. He obtained money by taking advertisements to be published in programmes, etc., and by selling tickets.

 The drummers and fifers excursion to Providence and Rocky Point Friday, was re- markable success. The special train out of Hartford consisted of twenty cars, and every car was filled to overfowlng when the train reached Providence. Upon the locomotive, as a sort of headlight"" was bass-drum with colored boy astride, armed with two sticks, with which he hammered the sheep-skin at lively rate.

 The list of the Wallingford tornado victims is increased to 32 by the deaths of Maggie Lynch at Wallingford, and of the Mooney baby at the New Haven hospital, where it was taken after it's friends had been killed by the disas- ter. The rest of the injured are doing well, except Richard Taylor, whose back was broken. He lives on liquids, and the constant use of morphine is necessary to alleviate his pain.

 It has been discovered that the human foot found in a. shoe Sunday, on the Beach near Cedar creek, wasn't a foot after all, but some corned beef used for crab bait by man named Edwards and his two sons, on the pre- vious Saturday. Wishing to use it another day, they placed it in an old shoe after they had finished fishing, tied stone to it and threw it out, the stone being used to prevent it's being carried away by the crabs or tide.

 -Niantic fishermen had an exciting tussel recently with a monster striped bass which broke cut of the net after it had been drawn up on the beach and darted for the sea. It was grasped around the body by one of the men lust as it reached the water, and he was quickly carried beyond his depth, but the other fisherman took hand in the fight then and both were borne out of the water. The fish weighed forty-six pounds, and was nearly four feet long.

 On Sunday, the 9th of September, the cor ner-stone of the Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus will be laid, in the town of Bloomfield, by the Rt. Rev. Bishop Galbery. The Rev. Dr. Carmody, of New Britain will preach the ser mon on the occasion. An excursion train will be run on the Connecticut Western railroad tor the accommodation of persons from Hart ford who wish to attend.

 The Patrons of Husbandry will hold & pic- nic at Southwick Ponds, on Wednesday, the Il tn of September Probably more than 500 farmers and their friends will be present. | The tables will be spread for the accommoda- tion of 1000 persons if so many attend, with | sea food, baked clans, etc. The Chinese com. have been invited to attend, and | some encouragement has been given that they | will be represented on the occasion. This is | to be the annual gathering of the order in l 

 The Bridgeport Farmer says: The judges | of the supreme court are unable to agree on | the question as to the constitutionality of the | law allowing accused persons the privilege of | waiving their right to be tried by jury, and | have ordered that the issue be reargued at | the October session of the court.

A KIND WORD FOR THE sUFFERERs.
The following is from the pen of one of
the bounced editors of the late Union,
and VIC give ii place that the aggrieved may
have hearing after his light had been
80 suddenly and rudely extinguished by the
late sale and transfer Of that paper into the
Democratic camp. This is no funeral Of
ours, but we are disposed TO comfort the
mourners by such solace as this publication
will afford


UNION ADVERTISING coNrRAcTs.


""The hybrid organ, tho result Of the coales-
cence of a violent copperhead Democratic
sheet and q paper which, If not Republican,
was, at least, not Democratic, announces that
1t will drop the tail of its title and sputter and
brag as the Daily Stick after the expiration of
the Tnion's advertising contracts. In other
words, that sheet adopts q temporary alias in
order to cheat advertisers. A Republican, who
sees no merit or right in newspapers attacks
on the country and the institutions he ad-
mires, who does not believe in the ascendancy
of the Confederacy, masquerading as the DEM
ocratic majority in the House of Representa-
tives, advertised in paper avowedly Republic





cuse for compelling that man to contribute to
a sheet whose course he reprobates. There is
neither law nor right to sustain such an un-
derhandcd trucking as this. Advertisers can
not DO bought and sold like merchandise.
Again, the Post is a on-union paper, and hun
dreds of workingmen have refused their GUS
tom to mercantile houses that advertise in u
rat paper, and JOHN LYNCH had no right to
sell his patrons out of trade in the fashion he
has attempted.


If is the intention Of the Union advertisers
to advertise in the Daily Stick an Onion, well
and good; but those who do not believe in
contributing to the dissemination Of political
hercsies aud the advocacy of dangerous polit-
ical theories need not pay, no matter how
fhuch advertising they get In the hybrid as

Instance, the proof.reader of the late Union
was paid nominaily SIS per week for his SER

has thus been robbed Of has been made to con-
tribute to the losses incidental to the cstab.

that either party got much the better of tn,

It may be said to the credit OF Virginia and
to the honor of the people of that old State
that we do not often get from it such
story as is told in the despatch from Rich
mond printed to-day. Fortunately, that
kind OF punishment Of great crimes,
which itself partakes of the nature Of
the crimes punished, has been mostly
practised hitherto in our frontier dis
tricts and in those little civilized coun-
tries where the people have no other
remedy for self protection. Where courts
do not exist or where the organization of the
machinery of criminal justice is so loose that
there is no guarantee for the punishment of
deinquents, or where it is practically found
that crime has immunity through COR
ruptions in the administration, there is
some reason for the application OF Lynch
law, though even in these cases the fact
that action is taken under the influence OF
excitement and passion, and that the guilt
of the accused is never certainly established,
stamps it as barbarous remedy as bad as
the evil it endeavors 10 correct But how
can it be possible that there is any excuse
for the practice Of this kind of barbarity in
Virginia? If the story of the hanging of n
negro woman in Rockingham county for
having, as supposed, instigated the burning
of barn is not an exaggeration, it is evil
dent that the people have for some reason
lost faith in the administration of justice,
and equally lost faith in themselves thus to
yield to impulses that are essentially MUIR
darons"

Mr.. Conrad introduced a resolution
providing for the purchase of horse and
carriage, for the use of the Street Com
missioner,S Street Committee and Opening
Streets committee, the Cost not to exceed
$3.50.


Mr.. Lynch, objected to the passage of
wages are low, ,and everything else Coun-
Gil should curtail its expenses, and hus-
band the money.


He knew that the citizens would OBJ
ject to the passage of the measure. They
would think that the Commissioners and
Committee were getting high toned, that
they needed horse and carriage to ride
around with. The other Commissioners
and Committees did not have one, and
he thought the Commissioner should put
up with little inconvenience as well as
other people; he did not see what they
wanted the horse and carriage for except
to electioneer.


Mr.. Chandler, said he had signed the
resolution because he thought that it
would be saving to the city; il would
enable the Commissioner to visit all the
men and see that the work was done.
As for politics, that idea must have origi-
mated in the gentleman's head who had
just spoken.


Mr.. Lynch-Don't the Commissioner
have boss to each gang? He must be
very high toned if he could not do a lit
tie walking.


Mr.. Baker had never heard so much
buncombe in the Council chambers, as
has just came out of the mouth of the
gentleman from the Tenth Ward. He
is a memberof the Committee, but does
not attend the meetings very regularly
and therefore does not know the large
amount of work that is being done


Mr.. Lynch inteTupting.-""It is not
worth while when you try to run every
thing yourself''-


MIR. Baker, II deny the assertion"" Mr.
Lynch, ""You try do it"" anyway.


Mr.. Baker speaking again to the point.
The city is doing great amount of work
at. the present time and long distances
apart.


Other Commissioners had assistants,
and he thought this would be cheaper
than appointing an assistant Commits
sioner.


The resolution was adopted.


The Street Committee presented the
following proposals for laying a terra

pedept for OBTAINING Connor till DR.. Lynch or
John Thornley, could see him and try to dis
suade him from his purpose. She debated





servants and despatch a summons to DIR. Lynch
to come to night; but she decided it would be
too great risk. Ballyowen was full of
strange policemen and soldiers, and q large
reward had been offered for Connors arrest,
and some one even of their own people might
be found base enough to think it pity tnat

She had bad previous expeIieno of Connor
in moods of deep dependency following on
great excitement, and she could not help
hoping that, after refreshment and rest, she
should find him more persuadable. AS the
eYening passsd On. hoYeYer. and the ConYer-
s ttion oet~een them was prolonged, she was
obliged to acknowledge to herself that for
once his resolution was too firmly rooted for
sry words OF here to shake it. He had been
wholly uuprepared for the events of the last
few days, and the downfall to his expeots-
tions had sen so great shock as to make
him loose his hold on hope, and turn from the
future with loathing. There was keen remorse,
too, fjr the share he had had in deludirg
Murdock aud the young men of the neig Dor.
hood who were now in prison with Pelham.
They spoke long of Murdock, and Connor was
deeply touched when Ellen repeated his las.
words.


He would not have blamed me or lost faith
in me, poor fellow, even if he had lived to see
what failure it was. l don't believe that

The garden was not in its usual trim since

there was blue and white passion flower in

gather blossom, thinking she would rather

had left open, she saw a man approaching the

her pace to intercept him before he could en- tor

For the first nomeIt the letter did not seem
to promise much interest it could not affect
the overwhelming troub BILE of this morning
but when she again stood by Connor's couch,
thought struck her which made her sink on
her knees and feel she could only open it so.
The note contained a few lines only, whose

also one up Secretary Creek, intersecting a |
line from Cabin Creek and also the other |

Mallet had made the demand of Craig which the law allows him to make, the subsequent proceed ings, and the tramp's arrest, would have been lawful even without a warrant, and the shoot ing would have been an attempt to murder without 6 shadow of justification, instead of mere attempt to kill, provoked by an attempt at illegal arrest. A statute passed in 1870 (Chap. 75) provides as follows:

 Whenever any transient person shall apply to any individual residing in this state to give him food, lodging clothing or money, the in- dividual to whom such application shall be 1sadc, may require the applicant to perform a reasonable amount of labor for such food, lodging, clothing or money; and, if the same be furnished, nsay detGin hina usstI such IGbor is performed, but not beyond the hour of elev- .-g1l s~8 8kn off fha dau aurrAp6. ing his application and if such applicant shall neglect or refuse to perform such labor, being suited to his age, strength, and capacity, or shall wilfully injure the person or property of the individual requiring the labor, he shall be deemed a vagrant and shall be committed to any town work house, or any county work. house in the county where the offence shall have been committed; or in case there be no such work-hoase in the town or county, then to the common jail in the county, for period not less than thirty days, nor more than six months; and until the costs of prosecution against him be paid and upon second con- viction of such transient person for similar offence he shall be committed to such work house or common jail for period not less than four months, nor more than year and until the costs of prosecution be paid.

 The statute proceeds to give the right of ar- TG86luk 8ucu H8ublSub pCIbO1J WcUONV """"- rant, to any sheriff, constable, selectman or grand juror, of the town, or to any executive officer of city, within their precincts; and, by e third section, it is provided that ''The select menOf any town may appoint one or more special constables in each school district in such town to carry out and enforce the provisions of this act""

 We are inclined to think that if instead of demanding money, Mir. Mallett had required labor of Craig, and the latter had refused to be detained and set to work as provided by the above law, the subsequent pursuit and at tempted arrest would have been legal and Craig's resistance an attempt to murder The foregoing statute excited some interest at the time of itsrpassage. but has lapsed to a great degree out of the public memory, and it is probable that Mr. Mallctt was not aware of his rights under it, on the occasion of Craig's ap- plication for food. Nor have we ever heard of any appointment by the selectmen of our towns of the special constables authorized by this statute. Would it not be advisable then for the citizens and selectmen of Washington and other towns, to inform themselves of their rights as regards vagrants under existing laws, to appoint special constables, and to take the legal steps for detaining transient persons applying for assistance, before appealing from Judge Martin to Judge Lynch?

 There does seem a necessity, however, to define and extend the right of arrest without warrant now allowed private persons. That right is now confined to cases where felony has been committed and there is probable ground for supposing that the person arrested is the offender. There are no statute felonies in Connecticut. Only the crimes known to the English law as felonies at the time of the emigration of our ancestors to this country are deemed such by our law. The distinction thus made leads to some absurd results. For instance Swift's Digest (vol 2 page 2S4)speci- iies only six offences as coming under that head; murder, manslaughter, arson, robbery, burglary and theft It is only the crime itself, not the attempt to commit it, which consti- tutes a felony. One cannot legally arrest a fellow who shoots at him with pistol with out warrant but one may arrest without war rant a person who has stolen hens egg from his yard One may arrest without warrant man who burns a dwelling house, but not man who burns . store; for the burning of store is not usually arson at common law. If Swift's list of felonies is complete (which we very much doubt), Wysnt could not have legally arrested Craig, without warrant, for committing rape, forgery, or perjury, or for attempting murder, arson or robbery, while the pettiest theft would have justified such an arrest Would it not be much more sensible to give private persons the right ofarrest with out warrant for State Prison offences. A simple statute making all offences punishable with imprisonment in the State Prison felo- uies, and reducing all others to the grade of misdemeanors, would not only greatly simpli- fy the existing law of arrests but would make 1t much more just and reasonable.

 While the citizens power of arrest remains limited to certain common law offences, and does not apply to many of our equally serious statute crimes the officers power of arrest without warrant has been increased to what we cannot but regard as a dangerous extent. On page 34 of our General Statutes we find the following:

 sRC. 3-Sheriffs, deputy sheriffs, eonstaileS, borough Dalifrs, police OI11CrIs, and TaiIrvasI and steamboat police, in their respective pre- cinta, shall arrest, without previous complaint and warrant. any person for any offence in their jurisdiction. when the offender shall be taken or npprehended iD the net, or on the speedy Information of others and all persons ss arrested shall be immediately presented be- fore proper authority.

MIR. Davis insisted that the contract
system was humDug, and had not re.
suited in the proper cleaning of the
streets.


Mr. Paynter moved to postpone futher
consideration of the ordinance until next
thursday night, which motion was lost
by the following vote:


Ayes-M essrs. Baker, Guthrie, Hazlett.
Knight, Lynch. Maxwell, Norton, Payn-
ter, Taylor and Townsend-10.


Nays-Messrs. Adams, Chandler, Con-
rad, Davis, Downing, Evans, johnson,
Jones, Price, Windle, aud President
Lichtenstein-11.


The seventh section was adopted by
vote of IL to 10, and various dilatory mo-
uons to adjourn, take recess, &C., were
defeated by the same vote. An effort to
call the ayes and nays on a motion to en-
cuse member from voting was ruled
out of order by the chair.


Before the ordinance was finally con-
sidered Mr. Baker obtained leave of ab-
sence.


Upon the reading of the title more dill
atory motions were made, when Mr..
Windle called for the previous question,
which was ordered by a strict party vote.
The title of the ordinance was then adop-
ted by the same vote.


Mr.. Paynter said if the ordinance was
not political measure, why was il me-
cessary to call a party caucus to put it
through, and in the face of strong oppo-
sition. If it was fair, square measure
1t would have been placed upon its mer-
its, ami not forced through a caucus.


Mr.. Conrad said he never looked up
on 1t as party measure. He thought it
would prove better for the people.


The ordinance was then put upon its
final passage and passed by strict party
vote-1l to 9-the Democrats voting in
opposition.


Council then adjourned."

CAN PARTY.


The City Council, last night by strict
party vote, repealed the ordinance re-
curing the cleaning OF the streets TO be
given out by contract, and res ored this
portion of city labor to the control of the
Street Commissioner and the Street Com
mittee of Council. Mr.. Baker alone, of
the Republican members, was opposed
to the measure, and voted against it on
several test motions, but befoi e it was on
its final passage he left the Council cham
ber.


The ordinance, as at present tinkered,
provides that the removal of ashes, gar
bage and offal shall be performed by
contract, but that the cleaning Of the
streets shall be done under the control
and direction of the Street Commissions
er. The Commissioner stall also attend
to the removal of ashes, garbage and
offal until the contracts for this work are
awarded.


The ordinance was being read by the
Clerk, but when he had read the second
section Mr. Norton said 1t did not read
Ike the same ordinance that was intro
duced and read two weeks previous.


Mr.. Windle claimed that he had a
right to amend an ordinance on its third
reading.


Mr.. Taylor thought it looked as if the
ordinance had been amended by the gen.
tleman himself, or by others.


Mr.. Lynch wanted to know why the
amendments were not offered in due
form, or as a substitute for the original
ordinance.


Mr.. Paynter claimed that the ordi-
nance under consideration was not the
one that was originally introduced, and
had not been properly before the Law
Committee.


Mr.. Windle insisted that it was custo-
mary to amend ordinances on their third
reading.


Mr.. Paynter assented to this view, but
insisted that the amendm ents must be
offered az such.


Mr.. Norton thought it looked very
much as though the ordinance was
10 be railroaded through Council,


Mr. Taylor insisted that the ordinance
under consideration had not been read
twice, and had not been approved by the
Law Committee. He made pOint of
order to this effect.


The Chair replied that the Clerk said
the ordnance had not been out of his
hands since twas signed by the Law
Committee.


Mr.. Chandler said it had been thought
necessary to add some amendments to
the original ordinance. but they had all
been approved by the City Solicitor.


Mr. Taylor inquired if the ordinance
was the same one that was introduced
two weeks previously.


Mr.. Chandler-The head is the same.


Mr.. Paynter said the new ordinance
had been handed to him 10 sign, as a
member of the Law Committee, and he
signed it, supposing IL was the one origi-
nally introduced. He had therefore been
deceived.


Hr nxrln oclyaI ClnrIr
from the minute book, the record of the
first appearance of the ordinance.


The Clerk replied that the present or
dinance was the same one that was origi-
nally introduced, but that it was not ON
the minutes.


Mr.. Hazlet said he never before knew
of a committee amending an ordinance.
Council alone can do that.


Mr.. Wiudle claimed that the ordinance
was regular and correct; that he had a
perfect right, after the secoud reading of
an ordinance. to make any amendment
or alteration he pleas d.


Mr.. Taylor objected to this assumption
of power. He sad that a paper was
broughtin for the first time and offered
for third reading The gentleman has
right to introduce an amendment but
he has not done so.


Mr.. WIndle-I do Introduce it as an
amendment.


Mr.. Taylor-No you don't; you call the
ordinance up for third rea,ting and
have the amendments read as though
they We're original sections.
The chair here dt cidtd that Mr.. Tay-
lor's point of order was correct, and that
the additions to the ordinance would have
to be offered as amendments.
The amendments were then proceeded
with until section 7, which provides for
The cleaning of the stree Is under the d.
rection of the Street Commissioner was
reached.


Mr.. Norton Questioned the necessity
for any change. The oniy trouble with
the present system was that it did not
make enough Republican votes. Under
| the proposed change poor and deserving
men would not get jobs, but only those
who wers supposed to have political in
| tiuence. If man said Mr. Norton is not
| suffi ciently well thought of by the people
of his own Ward to be sent to Council
without getting up such jobs as this, he
ought not to be here. This is nothing
but piece of political trickery.
Mr.. Johnson said there was nothing
political in the proposed change. The
streets had not been properly cleaned
during the past year, under the contract
| system, and change was desirable.
Mr.. Taylor considered the ordinance a
political measure. 1t was very strange
| for the author to bring it into Council
| upon the very night that the proposals.
were received for cleaning streets uuring
the ensuing year. There was plenty OF
| time during the winter to have consider
ed this change, but here the whole mat
| ter comprising eight or ten sections is to


be rushed through in one night. He
| thought past experience had proved that
politics IN city work worked no advau-
| tage to either party. The contract sys-
| TEN had saved the city some $1,000 last
year, and it would be advantageous to
continue.


Mr.. Windle claimed that he offered
the ordinance because the contract sys-
| tenn did not work well that the streets
Were not properly cleaned, and the con-
tractor did not properly perform his
work.


Mr.. Norton thought contractors should
be required to give ample security, and
the sureties be neld up to the mark. If
the contractor failed to do his work the
Street Commissioner and the Street
Committee were to blame.
Mr.. Lynch did object to the manner in
which the last contractor worked, but
thought he should be held up to his
work. To do away with the contract
system would increase the expenses, and
it was wrong to spend the peoples
far FL 81, L 1."

Toronto, March 1.-THE Hbernians wh'
have engaged 0DonOvan R0ssa to lectar
here to- morrow applied to Archbishol
Lynch for the use of st. Johns Hall, Bont
street, but his Grace, through Fathe
McCan, his secretary, denounced Rosaa al
q fraud and refused the hall.


To. day letter from the Archblshop was
read in several of the Catholic churches
coudemning those who had engaged Ros-a
and urging the people to keep away from
the lecture. St. Patrick's Hall, in Market
Place, has been secured.


The Mayor and Chief Of Police have
made arrangements fer the presence OF the
entire force of l25 men, in caRe of riot, aid
picked companies from the Queens Own
have been ordered to hold Themselves IN
readiness. The Orange Young Britons ure
very active, and if Rosea appears he will
be attacked beyond any doubt.


Toronto, March l9.-O'Donovan Rosa
lectured in ST. Patrick's Hall last evening
to an audience of about 1000. The threat
ened riot did not take place. Beyond a
continuous volley of stones for an hour
and a half at the lecture room, Kidding
all tho windows. no damage was done.
Nobody hurt. Rossa, unknown to the
crowd, passed to and from the hall unmo-
lested.





up Queen street and attacked Cosgrove's
tavern. The crowd inside answered with
evolvers, and the rioters returned the fire.
Hundreds of shots we're exchanged. A
shower Of stones was poured into the hotel,
until the window sashes and furniture were
completely demolished. The police, ninety
strong, charged the mob and welded their
bat0ns with great vigor.


Four men were shot here, and one young
Protestant, named Jas. Clegg, it is feared,
was mortally wounded. Meantime another
mob, 1000 strong, opened fire with stones
upon Collins's tavern, further up Queen
street, where Rosa was believed to be
lurking. Revolvers were used here, but the
police, fighting with matchless pluck
against enormous odds, cleared the street.


Rossa was driven out of town at ii
o'clock. Policeman Worth was struck on
the temple with . stone and knock ed sense
less. All his comrades were more or less
Injured; probably fifteen of the rioters
were injured with stones and police batons.
Doctors offices were crowded with wound
ed, though rs a rule the injured were taken
away to avoid arrest.


Hundreds OF roughs are still congregated
ia the lanes and back streets, and the po-
lice are parading the streets in force.


Toronto, March l9-O'Donovan Rossa's
lecture last night, ss a lecture, WAS a COM
plete failure, and disappointed all who
heard it. His principal supporters, before
be was half through, advised him TO cut it
short. 1t was not nearly so treasonable nor
inspiring as Gen. Barkes harangue of a
fortnight previous. All through the lecture
he MAS nervous 10 painful degree.

break down entirely. After the lecture it

feared, was fatally shot. Five constablcs

last night; two were fatally shot. Total
wounded $50, of whom fourteen were from

Before leaving New York, ODonoVan
Rosa was called upon by Now York

account of the interview:


Mr.. jeremiah O'Donovau Rosa has been

many boys. Several military
companies, some with, some with
out guns, were in the ranks. The

Mu, ers ana Lynching In ArizsnN.


PRESCOTT, A. T., June 15.-From
Mr.. Caldwell, who came in on the
Tip-Top stage to-day, we get the
following particulars of the shoot
ing and hanging at Gillette on
Wednesday. 1t seems that one
Setright, while on q bender, hit q
man over the head with bottle,
for which Deputy Sheriff Burnett
arrested him. He was released on
Sam Weir's promising to take him
away. The two started down the
street and had walked about $50
yards, when, without any apparent
cause, Setright pulled pistol and
shot Weir through the head, the
ball entering just above the eyes.
Setright went back and told his
account of the affair, mounted a
mule and put out. Half the town
mounted and went In pursuit, cap
turing the offender somewhere be-
low the mill in the brush and
bringing him back. Deputy Sh eri IF
Burnett got possession of the pris-
oner, and he and his assistant, l..
G.. Taylor, fortified themselves in
a house against the mobwhich soon
gathered, firing pistols and induIg-
ing in loud threats. During the
shooting Taylor stepped out of the
door and almost instantly received
a bullet In the head. The mob
then took Setright down into the
creek below town and hung him.
Sam Weir was known to every body
in this portion of Arizona as q
peaceable and orderly man. L. G..
Taylor was man of whom little was
known. lie was considered
prominent witness in the stage
robbery case which is before our
District Court and il is believed
that his death was caused by som g
one interested in the persons
against whom he would soon have
been called upon to testify.


Robert Hastings came into town
yesterday and gave the following
particulars concerning the killing
of the man recently found by Of
ficer Behan and others in the
Chavez Pass, on the road to the
Little Colorado: Hastings had gone
from the Moqui Agency to Rock
Springs Station, on the Santa Fe
and Prescott mail route, to deposit
letter for the Moqui Agent, and
there met John Hamilton and Tom
House, the latter the mail carrier
from that point to Navajo Springs.
He also overlook two Texans in q
wagon coming towards Prescott.
Hastings, Hamilton and the Tex
ans started on the road and when
they had travelled few miles they
saw House coming on a horse. He
travelled with them and left them
next morning. Hastings and
Hamilton left the wagon party aud
Travelled on toward Chavez Pass
and had gone but short distance
when House approached from q ra-
vine and Joined them. They trav-
eled on into the pass, where they
stopped to take some wafer and as
Hamilton was replacing the can
teen upon the saddle, House drew
a revolver and shot him in the
back of the head. For his own pro
lection Hastings lost no time in
getting to the brush and out of
reach Of House, leaving his horse,
provisions, etc., which have not
since been heard from, and came
on to report the crime. When
found by Beham and party, de-
ceased still had the canteen in his
hand. House was a young man of
great size and strength. He had on
II lcng fringed buckskin suit, two
pistols and bowie knife. Cause of
the murder not known.

yards from the house, and impetuously throw W

ing her frantic squeeze in her arms before
she exclaimed, athlessly,

Mrs. DAILY advanced a step or two to greet
Miss O'Flaherty, and Anne thought that the
last few weeks bad made change in her sp-
pearapce too. The extreme air of invalidism
was laid aside, her dress was brighter and
more becoming, her step had more life in it,
and there was actually smile-was it smile
of triumph ION her lips, as, laying passive
hand in Annes, she said


II am very glad to see you are able 30 come

WASHINGTON. D. c.. March s, 1878",,"WASHINGTON, D. c., March 8, 1878.


= ons half the bills presented in Congress
are in direct violation, either in letter or
spirit, Of the Constitution. These bills are
prepared by people with special interests to
be served, by public officers who wish for
extended powers, or who have theories they
wish to test, or by an active lobby which
sees possibility of plunder in every devia-
tion from simplicity in Government. Every
public officer is watched by an officer, who,
In in bis turn, is watched, every court in
some sections Of the country is at once aid
ed and epied upon by officers, and all these
spies and aids are the unnecessary and
vicious creatures Of system of legislation
not thought of 10 this country before 1861,
and which, If necessary, ceased to be years
ago. Every Department of the Govern


ment has It's secret agents scattered through


every State, forming an irregular and ire


sponsible body Of men whose very employ
ment suggests to them the corrupt use Of
power It may be that most of those who
will read this letter, have, 10 no apprecisb,e
way, except in the amount of their ytaxes,
suffered from this evil, but all of them may
at any moment suffer. 1t is awonder that
Democrats In the House and Senate content
themselves with feeble opposition to new
usurpations Of aRepublican administration,
and do not attack exis ting wrongs. ,Sens-
tor Thurman or Bayard, or Senator Beck,
or Representatives Glover, Edin steps'ens,
Springer, Cox, Lynch, Morrison, Potter, or
any of the hundred other able men tn Con-
gress could do no better work for the coun


try or their party than by thorough expo
sure of the changes that have been made In
the methods of transacting the business Of
the Federal Government. Exposure in this
matter would at once force reformation.
The Senate yesteday, passed the bill au-
thorizing the issue of long bond for the

On Mr.. Huested's motion the rules
were suspended, and he presented the
resignation Of his colleague. Mr. Max
well, member of Council from the First
Ward. ''0 ''''


Mr.. Lynch said that while he would
cheeriully vote for the resignation, be-
cause he believed Mr.. Maxwell would
benefit himself by changing his official
relations, yet he regretted that Council
was 10 lose the services of such an able
ana efficient member. Mr.. Maxwell had
always taken an active part in the pro-
ceedings of Council, and though his
equal might be secured his superior could
not be. And, said Mr.. Lynch, if he
carries to his new position the same zeal
and efficiency that marked his car, er in
council. Ills Honor will never regret
having appointed him Chief of Police.


he resignation was accepted, and
Council proceeded to elect Mr.. MaxweIrs
successor, when DIR. Allied Walton,
nominated by Mr. IIuested, was elected.
receiving eleven votes, TO six blanks.


DIR. Walton, being present, was quali-
fed by Mayor Almond and took his
seat


The Police Committee reported in
favor of confirming the appointment, by
Mayor Almond, of Daniel B. Woodward
as turnkey for 1879. Adopted.


The Law Committee reported favor

The Chief Engineer reported Is men

In presen ing the Water Department
pay roll, Mr.. Paynter SAID tina, owing to
some discrepancy between the books Of
the Treasurer and of the Clerk of Coun-
VIZ III itihbiOii w tllt hdltI
tion, the Water Committee had been led
astray, and overdrawn their appropria-
ton. lie said when the appropriation
for sidewalks was overdrawn, the sum Of
S4S9,9l was applied to il from the water
appropriation; and while the Clerks
books show that amount was returned,
the Treasurer's books donot Mr.. Payn-
ter then presented the following letter
from Chief Engineer McIntire.


Mr.. Le,cis PayRter, DEARSIR: Some
time ago when the appropriation for side
walks was exhausted, by order of some
one, do not know who, S4S9,S1 was TAX
ell from The water appropriation and used
for sidewalks. The books of the Clerk
of Council show this amount to have
been returned but the Treasurer's books
do not.


On last Friday, the Treasurer refused
to pay our pay roll check, and had $780,
81 charged to sidewalks. Then he paid
the check


There is still due the water appropria-
ton by sidewalks, S409.39. In addition
to this bill of Joseph File, in October,
for work done OH a sluice over the Bran
dywine race, by order of the Street Com |
mittee, was charged to our appropriation |
when 1t should have been charged to
streets. The bill amounted to S64.O5,
aud was applied by G. II. Gallagher |
Total due the Water Departmental 10 date,

AS these appropriations are uneer the |
of b. f. Townsend, he should, ifl
hehas any money left, pay our pay roll to-
night, as he will not have any more use |
for money this year.

while to clash with the Treasurer The


once was made for his (the Treasurer's)


benefit alone, as it was stated on the floor
OF Council at the time by his political
friends, that it was necessary to put a


man ir to help him, and they intma-
ted that he was incompetent. Mr..


Taylor could not say this on his own


knowledge, he merely repeated what the


Treasurer's political friends had said in
relation to the subject when the office of


Accountant was first established.
| Mr.. Guthrie thought Council had a
right to suit itself in electing an Ac-
countant. Bat recently he had learned


there were plenty of men in the city who
could perform all the duties of the Trea-
surer's office. Had he known it when
the last Accountant was elected he would
have voted to aboli III the office then.
The vote was then taken and the
ordinance passed by the following
vote:

WHEREAS, The Treasurer has not had |
prepared the interest list, the orders for |
which should be drawn this evening;


Resolyed, That the Treasurer be author |
lied to employ clerk, at a cost not ex- |
ceeding $50 per month, until such time |
as Council may resclnd this resolu- |
ton.


In support, President Lichtenstein said |
that unless the interest list is made out |
and orders drawn, at special meeting |
of Council to be held before the first OF |
January, people would come for their |
interest on Wednesday morning next, |
and would be unable to get 1t. Then it |
would be flashed all over the country |
that the city of Wilmington could not |
pay her interest This thing had never |
been neglected before, and the interest |
l,gt el, Ia, in nnnnai1 II /
ago.


Mr.. Norton thought the blame should |
rest upon the Treasurer and not upon the |
Council. The Council gave him clerk, |
but he refused to accept him. He, of all |
men, should have known the consequent |
ces ofa failure to pay interest, and If he |
causes trouble Council should not bear |
the blame.


Mr.. Guthrie said there was no cause |
for alarm, as not one-fourth the bond |
holders would come for their interest on
The first day, and there were still five |
days in which to prepare for them.


Mr.. Lichten>teln continued in relation
to the necessity of getting the orders
drawR and the interest paid promptly


Mr. Guthrie inquired of him if 1t was
not the duty of the Treasurer to send the
interest list to Council.


In response Mr.. Lichtenstein described
HOW tlhN SOhhtii3 al JCdiS hSoy hdo
paid Mr.. James Woolley $500 per
month, on account to prepare and estab-
lish new system of bookkeeping for
the Treasurers office. And theu finding
that the Treasurer could not keep the
new books as they should be kept, an
Accountant was provided, in order to
keep the books and to save the expense
of continuing Mr.. Woolley's engage
ment. The Accountant had always pre-
pared the interest lists, while the FL
nance Committee revised them. But If
this matter rs left to the Treasurer, and
the interest goes by default, the people
will blame Council and not the Treas
lrer.


Mr.. Paynter moved to amend the reso-
luton by authorizing the Finance Com
miitre ,insteat of the Treasure, to employ
,he CLERK. He said the Finance Com
mittee had the good of the city az much
at heart as the Pre- sident of Council. The
committee had intended to furnish The
Treasurer with a clerk to make out the
interest list, but he refuse to accept him.
Mr.. Paynter objected, so soon at
ter repeating an ordinance which pro-
yided for Treasurer's clerk, to pass a
resolution authorizing the Treasurer to
select clerk for himself.


Mr.. LichtensteIn accepted Mr. Payn-
,ers amendment, and the preamble aud
resolution were adopted.


On Mr.. Lichtensttins motion, it was"

A large and appreciaiive audience greeted
Miss Cole and her pupils, in Town Hall, on
the evening of Easter Monday. The stage was
beautifully decorated with flowers, shrubs,
ornamental grass and song birds in cages, Civ
ing it the appearance of some scene from fairy
land. The credit Of this tasteful arrangement
and fine effect is due alone, we understand, TO
our florist, Mr. B. F Lippincott, who is at
home and only contented among flowers and
plants.


The opening piano solo, by Miss NJ Hous-
ten, was excee dinghy well rendered as was al
so the solo from Marguerite which followed,
by Miss b. Pennington.


Lydia Flintham's recitals were rendered in
a manner that showed great natural talent
and careful training on the part of her instruc-
tress. Though no more than child in years,
her articulation was clear and distinct and her
action worthy of an adept Her second recital
of MADAME Smokes made a decided 'hit, ""
and was rendered in manner entirely fault
less. Little Lydia is not only gifted as an elo-
cutionist but is ready and versatile with the
pen, aud we predict for her bright future.


During the evening, Miss NJ. NJ. Cole sang
several solos and gave number of select read
ings, all of which were received by the au-
dieuce with hearty appreciation. Her recital,
''Tricksey's Ring"" brought forth rounds Of
applause This lady has been noticed before
in these columns as talented and accomplish
ed reader, and it is not necessary to 60 into
the details of the programme The duet, from
the opera of Norma, by Miss B. Pennington
and Miss Cole, was perfectly rendered. Miss
Pennington's superior musical attainments
and sweet voice are too well known in this
community to require comment. During the
evening she sang solo which elected much
applause


Miss Kate Cole, Of Baltimore, a young lady
Of fine musical attainments and possessing a
very sweet voice, sung a solo, darling""
in manner which delighted her hearers. She
also sang a duet with her sister, Miss N. NJ.
Cole, which has been pronounced one of the
best things Of the evening.


A vocal solo, Love May Come Tomorrow,
sang by Miss "" Lynch, was indeed musical
treat This young lady possesses remark
bly, clear, sweet voice, and we have heard her
solo praised on every hand. AIRS Flintham is
also the possessor of rare musical talent and Il
rich, sweet voice. She sang several solos, all
Of which were well received.


Mr.. Joe Stiles, whose musical attainments
are too well known here to need comment,
gave a number Of vocal solos in his usual
spirited style His ''Nancy Lee' was notice
able as fine effort.


Throwing Kisses"" neatly and cleFerly
rendered by little Petty Naudain, closed the
evenining's entertainment and the people dis
persed to their homes, no doubt feeling they
had enjoyed an evening Of rare pleasure.


Prices Orchestra was present and during
the evening performed number of select airs,
two of which were arranged expressly for the
occasion by the conductor, Mr.. Geo. Price.


The piano accompaniments were rendered
by Prof Stephens, Of Odessa,in an excellent"

WASHINGTON. D. G., April II. 1878.",,"W


The regular appropriation bills are
now in the positions given below: Pen
sion bill has passed the House and is in
Senate Committee; it will be reported
without important amendment. Three
bills. post Office, river and harbor, and
executive, legislative and judicial, have
been reported by House Committees,
but not finally acted on by the House.
Two bills, the consular and diplomatic,
and the West Point, are in conference
between the two Houses, as is the ""lit-
tie deficiency"" bill. All these confer
ences are caused by large amounts adj
ded by the Senate to the House bills.
The naval bill, after passing the House,
was increased enormously by the Senate
and the House Committee is now con-
sidering the subject. There will be a
Conference Committee on that subject,
too. The Army. the Indian, and the
Sundry Civil Bill, and two or more de-
ficiency bills have not been reported
in the House yet. There will be de
laws whenever the Senate has increased
the amounts appropriated, as the House
is lately showing q disposition to stand
by its committees.


Hon. Montgomery Blair's Maryland
resolutions arc now before the Judicia-
ry Committees Of the two Houses, and
the bill regulating the manner Of pre-
ceeding in Supreme Court on the trial
of the title Of Mr.. Hayes as contempla-
ted in the resolution, is before the same
committee Of the House. While it is
impossible to see any prospect Of the
passage Of the bill in the present House
and Senate, it is a significant fact that
Mr.. Garfield had few supporters ges-
terday in his efforts to prevent the re-
ception and reading Of the resolutions.
It was plain that all the members
thought the policy Of suppressing evi-
dence and avoiding discussion on the
subject had been pursued long enough.


The administration Nationat Inton
disappeared on Saturday last. 1t had
no right to exist. Its owners thought,
when they commenced its publication,
that decayed politicians, like Fenton,
of N. Y, and honest and impracticahle
politicians like Chamberlain, Of Maine,
to use as examples the two names which
first occur to me, would hereafter con-
troll the Republican party. They be-
lieved that, because the Fentons and
Schurz would be able to rally the hon
est majority of the people around them,
and that, because scholars here and
there showed IN interest in politics, the
scholars and thinking men of the coun-
trv would come to the front en- nasse
They forgot two things: First, that the
Democratic party, practically unit,
held majority Of the people; second,
that the machine politician, like Blaine
Conkling, Chandler and Cameron,
would rule the party or ruin it. From
the first, with ordinary prudence on the
part Of the Democrats, the only ques
ton has been as to the time in which
the Hayes faction should be driven IN
to the Democratic ranks. The Na
tionnl Union, anticipating the fate o.
those for whom it Iabored, is now &
portion of the Post, a paper which de
MES the title Of Mr.. Hayes 10 the Pres
idency. In a business point Of view
the Union goes out with clean hands
Mr.. Lynch insisting that all its debt:
be paid.


Mr. Hayes believes that the mex
House will be Republican. He says hc
will do all that he properly can to Sc
cure that result. He realizes the i'm
portance Of it, especially as the Senate
will certainly be Democratic after tht
4th Of March. In a certain sense th(
title of Mr.. Hayes will be on trial be
fore the next Congress, if not passeC
upon by the present one, and the inter
est expressed by him is not unnatural
But will the people Of the country as
sist him in selecting members Of tht
tribunal by which his case is to betried
VIII the Republican leaders heartily
second this, his first interference in be
half Of the party in general, knowing
that his fears rather than his care fol
them or the party dictates his course

 do not hope to give you the generals ex- act words, although as far as memory serves I do so- remember, for instance, asking the general why he had not invested Richmond as he had invested Vicksburg and starved out Lee:-''Such a movement"" said the general, ''would have involved moving my army from the Rapidan to Lynchburg. considered the plan with great care before Imade the Wilder ness move. thought of massing the army of the Potomac in movable columns, giving the men twelve days rations, and throwing myself between Lee and his communications. If had made this movement succeSSfuly-f had been as fortunate as was when l threw my army between Pemberton and Joe John son the war would have been over year soon- CT. l am not sure that it was not the best thing to have done; it certainly was the plan 1 should have preferred. If 1 had failed, how ever, it would have been very serious for the country, and I did not dare the risk. What deterred me, however, was the fact that was new to the army, did not have it in hand, and did not know what I could do with the gene ralso or men. If it had been six months later, when 1 had the army in hand, and knew what a splendid army ie was and what officers and men were capable of doing, and could have had Sherman and Sheridan to assist in the movement, 1 would not have hesitated for a moment""

 By the way"" said the general 'there is one point about the campaign in the Wilder ness worth remembering. My critics say that threw away 100, 900 men in that campaign. This has been repeated so often that it will ho hictnrU NOW m tnfal lOccpC about thirty-nine thousand, in all. Badeau's book will have the figures, but that is about the figure and those losses do not mean kill ed, but the number of effective men taken from my army by death, wounds, capture, and desertion, That movement cost me 39, 900 men, but do not forget what it cost Lee. Remember that Lee had to fight as much as did. He had the advantage of be- ing on the defensive, which is always an ad- vantage, and 1 had to attack and attack, but every blow 1 struck weakened him, and when at last he was forced into Richmond it was far different army from that which menaced Washington and invaded Maryland and Penn sylvania. Itwas no longer an invading army. The Wilderness campaign was necessary to the destruction of the southern confederacy.

 'I have always regretted the censurc that unwittingly came upon Butler in that cam paign, and my report was the cause l said the general was bottled up, and used the phrase without meaning to annoy the general or give hIs enemies weapon. like Butler, and have always found him not only as all the world knows a man of great ability, but a patriotic man, and man of courage, honor and sincere convictions. Butler lacked the technical experience of a military education, and it is very possible to be man of high parts and not be great general Butler as general was full of enterprise and resources and a brave man. If 1 had given him two corps commanders like Adelbert Ames, or Schofeld, or..Mackenzie, or a dozen 1 could mention, he would have made a fine campaign on the James and helped materially in my plans. have always been sorry did not do so. Butler is a man it is fashion to abuse but he is man who has done the country great service and who is worthy of its gratitude"""

hill, crumbling into fragments as they
went.


In the path of the gale stood the Ro-
man Catholic Church, hemmed IN on
three sides by a cemetery. The storm,
to Judge from the appearance OF the
ruin as it looked to-day, plowed into
the foundations, pressing them away
from the framework. Then the walls,
front and back, were crushed in, and
the roof fell so as to cover all complete
"". A more complete wreck than this
church could not have been made, eX-
cept BY fire. Opposite the church were
several little tenements, all occupied by
large families. When the gale had
passed, nothing remained to indicate
that there had been houses there, ex-
cept the gaping cellars and a line OF
spiinters leading into other lines that at
last met in an unbroken covering to the
ground of broken joistS, fences, kitchen
utensils, and clothing.


In this spot, an eighth Of mile on
each side of and opposite to the Catho-
lie Church,


THE GREAT LOSS OF LIFE OCCURRED.
It is a remarkable fact that every per-
son killed was member of the Catho-
lie Church. In one of the houses lived
Mrs. Downs, a middle-aged woman.
She was whirled away 600 feet, and
picked up dead and almost naked.


A hay-stack on John Lynch's farm
was carried an eighth of mile, and then
dropped upon the side of the hill.


Ali this destruction was done in much
less time than it takes to write it. With
appalling violence the wind swept up
the hill towards Main Street, whirling
and eddying about, and dropping a
shower of rubbish on the tobacco-fields
below. Where it touched the brow Of
the hill, the district school-house stood
in its path. The edifice cost $4,000 in
1870, and was fine brick building OF
three stories and Mansard roof. The
wind struck upon its west front, pushed
in the walls of the two upper stories,
wRENCHED HUGE PIECES FROM THE


WALL


and flung them into the yard and then
passed on. In an instant the building
was ruined Two stories stand, but
they are pushed out of perpendicular so
completely that they will never be
Strengthened.


Looking back from the school-house
toward the westward, about 90 feet be-
low, at the end of a steep slope, is the
plain, covered with its carpeting of de-
bris. The entire work of devastation in
that direction could be seen, plain
windrow, half a mile in width in its wild
est part, and in that dreadful lane there
were only two or three houses that still
clung together at all, and these so badly
twisted, tilted, and defaced that it will
be difficult ever to rebuild them. The
loss is estimated at S250,OO0,


THE SCENES IN WALLINGFORD
to-day were hesrtrending, and unman-
ned the strongest spectators. A brick
school-house was used as a dead-house,
and around this the thousands gather
ed, many searching for relatives and
friends, and many curious to see the
dead. Not less than 10000 people flock
ed into the ruined village from all the
surrounding country. Twenty-Five
families are homeless, and relief sub
scription fund has been started, headed
by Gov. Hubbard with 800. Every
thing possible is being done for the suf-
ferers. Such a tornado is almost un-
precedented in this section."

Tho clouds opened about four o'clock yester.
day afternoon, and II rained sufficiently long
to stop nearly all lovers Of baseball from at
tending on the third game of the series be-
tween the National and Pittsfeld, Of Mas
sachusetts, at the National grounds. A few
persons, backed by their love for this pastime,
ventured forth and witnessed a fve.inning
game for their courage 1t was an uniavora-
bic day, and neither nine could do justice to
their reputation as players. II was after five
o'clock before the condition of the weather
would admit of play being called.


The Nationals were forced to make some
changes in the position of their men Baker,
owing to sore hands, was compelled TO vacate
the CatCher's position, and sought rest in the
centre field. 4 trial Of Konnoy was made
behind the bat, aud 1t proved very expensive
luxury. lie was unable to hold or stop many
of the balls Lynch pitched, and the short time
he remained in the position he managed to
contribute three runs to the score Of his oppO.
ncnts. This was generous, but little too
costly, and ere the inning closed he was sup.
planted by Trott-who seems to be the general
utility man-and went to first base. where
later he added another error to his column,
making One-half Of the number chargeablc TO
his ninC.


After he went from behind the bat no more
mistakes were committed there. llouck
made brilliant dlSblc play. aud exhibited
something of his old vitality in fielding. At
the bat the National did no execution, and
failed to punish Burns, whom they faced for
the first time. Tho Pittsfcld made but one
score in the five innings and played with un.
common steadiness. The feature Of their
fielding was a magnificent running catch made
by Hopper Of the centre field. They handled
the willow freely and hit Lynch for eight
bases, although earning but one run in the
game.


For wonder the umpire, Mr.. Major, gave
satisfaction and was impartial in bis decisions
II would be we'll to hunt for such referees In
games to come.


Appended Is the score:"

the matter. We think we gave the
Petersburg Guard credit for having
carried off the coveted prize-though
the types NAV have made US say to

awarded to the Langston Guard. We
simply took occasion to note the fact
that the Petersburg Blues were highly
commended by gentlemen Of well

 TUCsoN, Sept. 1S.-Detective Evans brought in here on Monday last anoth. CT stage robber, an old offender and an American, whose name they deslre to keep from the public at present. He was one of the party who recently rob. bed the stage below Maricopa Wells and took bullion and horses. The bull lion was taken Go Silver City, cut up in small pieces and squandered cn the road. He was found near Camp Thomas, herding cattle. He has been engaged in numerous stage robeeries in the Territory, is thirty-six years old and has resided here eleven years. He will De taken to Yuma today by De tective Evans, provided he isn't lynch ed. He promises to peach on his pals, which may save his life. N.

 THE CITIZEN last week published an item in this connection which was simply the substance of the record in Justice Neugass' court On finding this dispatch in Prescott paper, we recognized the fact that attempts had been put forth 10 mislead the public, and for the first time made us begin to credit Jack Swilling's statement that he was made victim of reward hunt CTS. Let's be more specific:

 l. The name of the stage robber re- ferred to in the above dispatch appears in the court record in Tucson as J. s. Stout. His name is given out as Rhodes at Yuma.

 2. Sheriff Shibell says there is a man in Tucson who knows this same person was in Silver City, N. M., al the time of the said Maricopa stage rob bery. Deputy Sheriff Phy, of Marico- pa county, was over here last week, and says he long ago knew that Rhodes was one of the Wickenberg stage rob bers and was after him when here. Phy is also convinced that Swilling, Kirby and Monroe were innocent of the Wickenberg robbery.

 8. The reference to danger of lynch ing here was unfounded in fact, and has the appearance of an effort to ex- alt somebody.

 The further developments of this case, including the arrest of Swilling, Kirby and Monroe, will be awaited with anxiety by all men who abomi- nate the indiscrimmate arrest of men for crime. There can hardly be 8 blacker crime than the arrest and pun ishment-arrest being punishment--of innc cent persons. The zeal which is responsible for such arrests can we'll be dispensed with. Justice is slow, but usually certain."

 te PART II.

 The spring of 1874 was retarded in the Cal ifornia Sierras So much so that ce1tain Eas' tern tourists who had early ventured into the Yosemite Valley, found themselves, one May morning. snow-bound against the tempestuous shoulders of Fl Capitan. So furious was the onset of the wind at the Upper Merced Canon that even so respectable a lady as Mrs Right body was fain to cling to the neck of her guide to keep her seat in the saddle: while Miss Alice, scorning all masculine assistance, was hurled against the snowy wall of the chasm. Mrs Rightbody screamed; Miss AL ice ragged under her breath, but scrambled to her feet again In silence '

 ''I told you so,"" said Mrs. Rightbody when her daughter had regained the saddle.

 Miss Alice shrugged her pretty shoulders scornfully. =. .,a. @

 ''You were particularly warned against go, ing into the Valley at this season."" she only replied, grimly.

 Mrs. Rightbody raised her eyes inpatient ly. , ,

 ''You know how anxious was to discover your poor fathers strange correspondent, Al ice; you have no consideration.

 ''But when you hage discovered him-what then ?"" queried Miss Alice.

 ''What then?""

 ''Yes. My belief is that you will find the telegram only mere business cypher. And all tilis quest mere nnnsens- !""

 'tAlice why g0u yourself thought your fa- ther's conduct that night very strange. Have you forg0UUeu?

 The young lady had not forgotten, but for some far-reaching feminine reason chose to ignore it at that moment, when her late tum- ble in the snow was still fresh in her mind

 And this woman - whoever she may be -"" continued Mrs Rightbedy.

 'Hew do you know there's woman in the .case?' interrupted Miss Alice, wickedly. I fear. '

 ""Hew do-I-know-there's a woman ?"" slowly ejaculated Mrs. Rightbody, founder ing in the snow and the unexpected possibility of such ridiculous question. But here her guide flew to her assistance, and estopped further speech. And, indeed, grave problem was before them.

 The road that led to their single place of refuge-a cabin, half hotel, half trading, post scarce a mile away-skirted the base of the rocky dome, and passed perileusly near the precipitous wall of the valley. There was a rapid descent of hundred yards or more to this terrace like passage, and the guides paus- en for moment of consultation, coolly obliv- ious alike to the terrified questioning of Mrs Rightbody or the half-insolent independence of the daughter. The elder guide was russet- bearded, stout, and humorous; the younger was dark-bearded, slight, and serious.

 ''Ef you kin get young Bunker Hill to let you tote her on your shoulders, I'll get the Madam to hang on to me, came to Mrs. Rightbody's horrifed ears as the expression of her particular companion. @f #@f'#

 Freeze to the old gal, and don't reckon on me if the daughter starts in to play 1t alone, ]"" was the enigmatical response of the younger guide.

 

 before the tive men returned to their side, that high-spirited young lady had urged her horse down the declivity. S@ @# ' :. ..'9'

 Alas, at this moment 8 gust of whirling snow swept down upon her.. There was 8 founder, misstep, afatal strain on the wrong rein, fall, a few plucky but unavailing strug- gles, and both horse and nder slid ignomin- iousle down toward the rocky shelf. Mrs. Eightbody screamed. Miss Alice, from con- fused debris of snow and ice, uplifted a vexed and coloring face to the younger guide,-a lit tie the more angrily, perhaps that she saw 8 shade of impatience on his face.

 ''Don't move, but tie one end of the 1ass' under your arms, and throw me the cther,"" he said quietly.

 ''What do you mean by lass'-the lasso 2' asked Miss Alice, disgustedly.

 s''Yes, ma'am."" .

 ''Then why don't you say so?""

 Oh, Alice!"" responsibility interpolated Mrs. Rightbody, encircled by the elder guides stalwart arm. #.ss -s.,. ...t

 Miss Alice deigned no reply, but drew the loop of the lasse over her shoulders, and let it drop to her round waist. Then she essayed to throw the other end to her guide.

Miss Alice was no dead weight, however, but steadily half-scrambled on her hands and knees to within foot or two of her rescuor. At this too familiar proximity, she stood up, and leaned little stiffly against the line, causing the guide to give an extra pull, which had the lamentabie effect of landing her almost in his arms.

Last Monday an excursion party, number
lug between 800 and 400 colored persons, from
Lynchbura, Va, and vicinity paid a visit to
this city for enjoyment and sightseeing. On
arriving they divided up into small parties
and searched about for accommodations.
Quito number Of them went to the Exchange
Hotel, near the Baltimore and Ohio depot,
where the landlord, James Stone, agreed to
provide them with room and bed for twenty
Ave cents per head. The proposition was ac-
cepted, and matters went right until retiring,
when there was big row. 1t seems that the
landlord had not sufficient beds TO go round !;
90 he concluded to try another way Of cater
ing TO his guests somewhat uncommon In
hotel experience. He decided first to locate
eighteen Of them In one room then he got
bundles Of straw and proceeded to make that
number Of shake-downs, giving each o top
dressing Of q few rags. When finished 1t re-
sembled livery stable, with the horses beds
prepared for night, rather than reclining
places for human beings. The visitors were
greatly astonished at the kind Of accomni oda-
tions offered for their money, refused to &C.
ccpt them, and demanded the refunding Of the
twenty-five cents, that had been paid In ad.
vance, which the landlord declined TO do.
Hard words followed, and for awhile trouble
was imminent, but fortunately nothing serious

Ant. Chiness Legisia,ion IL Veto
ria.


SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12th.-A
Victoria dispatch says that Parlia-
ment has passed the Chinese tax
bill. The discussion was acrimo-
.ious. Both sides admit the ne
cessity of tax, but differ as to the
mode of collecting it and the
amount. The Government pro-
posed $50 per month, but being
strongly opposed, have reduced the
rate to $40. The Colonist, an
anti.Chinese paper, declares that
the bill will make the province a
laughing stock throughout Christ
endom, because of It's absurd pro-
vision and charges that it was
drawn up ty heavy employers of
Chinese labor to insure its disal-
lOwance at Ottawa. The Coionist
attacks the Government for insin-
cerity and bad faith.


Cbartz Sentence. Il for Life.


EUREKA, New, Aug. 11.-Alfred
Chartz was yesterday, sentenced by
Judge Gale to imprisonment for
life for the killing of 'Edward Ric.
kar, Railroad Conductor. He was
little moved by the sentence. Dur
Ing the afternoon, many prominent
citizens called on him at the Jail.
The sheriff this morning departed
with him to tho state prison. A sad
aspect Of this case is that Mrs.
Chartz last night became a mother.
The sand Lots Favor a CoMprsIng


Railroad.


SAN FRANCISCO, August 12th.-
At the Sand Lots meeting yester-
day resolutions were passed advo-
eating the building of a competing
transcOntinental railroad with it's

A Sian ShOt.


BLOCKS, CAL, Aug. 12.-Last
night shooting affair occurred
near this place. Hugh Kelcher
was shot by one OConner, the ball
entering his skull, causing q wound
that will probably prove fatal, as
his brains are ooZing out. The as
sault was caused by an old grudge.
O'Connor gave himself up to the
authorities.


Death Of Montague, the Acier.


SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 12.-H. ].
Montague, of the Diplomacy Com
hination, recently playing an en-
gagemena a the California Theater,
died last night at the Palace Hotel.
1t will be remembered that on Fri
day evening he was taken with
severe hemorrhage while on the
stage. Yesterday he seemed much
better, and during the evening was
making preparations to join the
troupe in the eastward trip this
morning. While chatting and
laughing, he was suddenly seized
with another hemorrhage, the blood
spouting in jets from his mouth,
from the effects of which lie died In
a few minutes. The body will be
emhalmed and taken East, accom-.
panied by the, remaining members

So we have deemed it in order, as something for preservation, to briefly review, in connec- tion with the execution of John Ten Eyck, the crime, and sketch of the life of the fiend, (for such he was), who breathed his last breath on the scaffold at Pittsfeld Friday forenoon.

 THE CRIME.

 A little way out from Sheffield village, lived Mir. and Mrs. David Stillman, one of the most respected old couple in that town. MT. s. was g carpenter by trade, and had by economy, saved up 8 little money, owned the little farm upon which he lived, and in the decline of life, nearly down to it's close, was enioyirg the fruits of the honest toll which had character ized all his years. We have yet to learn, that in all his acquaintance, there was one to doubt his honesty, his piety, or his good wishes for the prosperity of all about him. quiet, un- obtrusive old gentleman, then, was David Stillman, and one whose tragic death will live long in the memory of the people of Shelf field,

 His wife, Sarah, was fitting companion, 8 tidy housewife, kind neighbor, and known for her sunny disposition, and many acts of kind ness among her neighbors. She was a few years younger than her husband, and his sec- ond wife. Both were devoted members of the Methodist church in that town, and it's most prominent pillars. They lived alone, the two sons, one clergyman, and the other book keeper in the village, being both grown up, had gone out into the world for themselves Their home was peaceful and quiet, as .many another farm house is. There were neigh bors near, and yet 50 open were their daily lives, that they had no occasion to hide them selves behind heavy curtains at night, but the light of their evening lamp could easily be seen through the window pane, every evening, On the morning after Thanksgiving, or rather early evening, John Carey, Jr. 8 lad of fifteen, whom Mr.. s. had employed to do his chores, was mortified on entering the house, not recei- wing any answer to his footstep in the kitchen, ~~A~~ From the ghastly wounds on his head, and 8 bloody axe lying at the side. It needed no re- ffection to convince him that bloody scene had been enacted there the night before, and he at once alarmed the neighbors. On their return, & search was made of the house, and that revealed the fact that 8 double tragedy had been wrought. for, at the foot of the cellar stairs, lay Mrs. Stillman, her head bearing the wounds inflicted by the same bloody axe which had dealt the fatal blow to her husband, cold in the embrace of death. It was the most bru- tai affair in all this region, and many who saw the victims will bear it's memory as long as life lasts. On the table in the sitting room. was pail of butter, the steelyards which had evidently been used in weighing it, pitcher containing cider, and the patch work on which she had been sewing, while her husband was undoubtedly reading to her while she was thus employed. Further examination re- vealed the fact that an attempt had been made to fire the house kerosene had been sprin- kled on the stairs and stairway, leading to the garret, paper had been saturated, and fired, but it doesn't take 8 very wide stretch of i'm aginstion for one to believe it to be an inter- vention of the divine hand to stop the flames, and thwart the designs of him who had thus thought to cover his bloody work by the torch.

 THE SUSPICION

 at once fell on John Ten Eyck, colored man who had lived in 6 little house near the Still mans since the previous April. His reputa- tion was ra ther unsavory he was addicted to drink, and had made threats against this same couple only few weeks before. He had been in the village that day, and was known to be under the influence of liquor. When al 5 o'clock Thanksgiving night, young John Ca. rey was returning to his home from Stillmans he met this Ten Eyck, who asked him if they had any butter to sell, and if they had com pany; g MT. Holmes also saw him pass, an6 had spoken to him. Later in the evening he had been in the drug store, had bought hail dye, quantity of liquor and some cigars. Al one Nat. Johnsons he had exhibited money which he claimed he had taken from two tramps who had assaulted him, and at Nat Johnsons he had remained over night. He was arrested on the following morning, and ta ken to the house where he claimed not to rec ognize MT. StilIman, whose bloody remains Ia. before him. Upon him was found sum O. money, which he claimed he had recieved from his brother, in a letter from New Haven with which to purchase butter, but by calcula ting his purchases. it was found to agree ex actly with the amount, 8 son of MT. Still man had paid the old gentleman only da. or two before. John Ten Eyck was suspect ed man, and no evidence or trace has as ye been found pointing to any other man. H' was arrested, and it was with difficulty tha he was not lynched then, and there. The at tempt to carry out that object, at the prelimi ary examination in Burlington, afterwards when it required the busiest work, entirely ol the part of the sheriffs, who only kept thu crowd at bay, by cooked revolvers, their es cape and hurried drive to Van Deusenville and thence to Pittsfeld are all fresh in mem | ory, and need no repetition here.

 THE TRIAL.

 At the January term of the superior court the grand jury found bills of indictmen against John Ten Eyck, for murder in the frs degree, and 8 few weeks later he was arraign ed before Judge Colt of the superior court 1 when he pleaded not guilty, and his trial wa set down for May IS. Hon. N. W, Shores o Lee, and H. c. Joyner Esq, of Ct. Harrington | were assigned as counsel, but at the openin, of the case, the latter was unable ta go on witl it, and Hon. s. W. Bowerman was substituted the government being represented by Attor l ney general Train and District attorney Leon ard of Springfield. The trial lasted thre <! days, and was attended by crowds every day During it all the prisoner was apparently COG and collected, and his defense was conducte

 with as much ability as though the client hat been worth million dollars. The jury wa one of the best ever seen in Berkshire county

 who gave the case the most patient and carefu

 deliberation. Judges Colt and Ames presided

 The number of witnesses was large, and eacl

 was brought in and testified separately. Tn"

 Tine lawns of North Street are kept in really splendid condition, this season. They are always close -mown with the walks all cut to an uniform width.

 The removal of the Mansion House West Barn, and the building of new one on the To- cation of the old stage barn, is great inn provement to the property for summer use. The nearness of the stables to the hotel has heretofore been quite drawback.

 The West Park croquet ground is as live ly as ever, this season and, from six to eight D. m., it swarms with timers, undcrtakers, den- tists, printers, railroad superintendents and others. A recent feature is q board siding placed all around the ground to stop the balls Mir. c. H. Platt seems to be the champion croquct player of the village.

 We noticed that one of our College boys ''tooled"" the Naugatuck four in hand, to and from the station, on Tuesday. From the way in which he sat the box, did the ''hand over"" in turning his corners, and recovered the whip, I've nearly mistook him for a profession al, which we suppose is the highest praise that can be awarded him.

 Eugene Banker was arrested by Sheriff Champlin, Saturday night, at Woodville, on charge of having stolen buggy from the barn of Mir David Deforest of this place. The bug gy was taken about three weeks ago. One day last week, Mir. Deforest recognized it as Banker drove it up to Mir. Barnes place. Ban ker was arrested while coming back from New Preston with Deforest's buggy. The running part has been repainted blue, and the under side of the back of the seat was hacked off. Banker has his trial today Wednesday, be- fore Justice Beach.

 BASE BALL.-The Second Nine Nameless played an interesting game with the Gunnery nine at Washington on Thursday, beating them il to 8. five of the eight having been scored in the last inning The Gunnery players could make nothing of Lynch's pitching, getting but six base hits during the whole game. On the other hand the Lltchfeld nine found no difi- culty in punishing Bishop to almost any ex- tent, making no less than 19 first base and two second base. hits Of the Nameless Sedgwick led al the bat, with six base hits Gone for 2d) and no Outs Lynch made four base hits and one for two bases The Gunnery batting was so unsuccessful that there was little out-feld ing. Roberts caught difficult foul-bOund On the Washington side Burton, center-felder, made several fine fly catches w. Brinsmade played admirably at first and Lennon is to be credited with three of the six base hits made by the whole nine.

 -BIRCH GROvR.-In the summer of 1916 Benjamin Peck was drowned at thls place or the mill pond near this village. The writer ot this was not resident of the village at thu ( tl~ account of the occurrence Birch grove wa then fine romantic promOntory jutting int the pond and covered with beautiful bircl trees. Peck, with his fathers colored servant was engaged in felling trees the day was sul try and he took bath. He was good swim nlcr, but the chilling coldness of the wate caused cramps and he soon cred out for as sistance; the negro rushed to his aid, but poo Peck clasped his neck with both hands, am and they perished together. The inciden caused much sensation in the quiet communit. at the time.

 Septuagenarians of the present day-the boy cf that period-wh ever made it swimming place, will we'll remember the icy coldness o the deep water. It was supposed that colt spring here led into the river It was ia vOrite place for eel fishing. Singularly enough the river at this spot remained open in winte long after the other portion of the surface wa frozen over.

Mr.. Baker thought the estimated cost
should be given before the resolution is
passed.


MIR. Paynter urged the addition of the
estimated cost to the resolution and its
immediate passage. He thought the
work should be done, as the property on
the Southside was greatly damaged for |
want of such work. The people there
was entitled to protection, as they pay
taxes on property which is almost con, |
tinually Hooded, and therefore, at pres
ent, OF no practical benefit.


Mr.. Davis coincided in this view, and |
thought the Council had no right to COL
lect the tax from the Southside property

The work should be done, at any cost.

war with the Lynchburg Jirgiaidn for the
mere fun of the thing, but we must assert
the opinion that it is looking at the rcla-
tions that exist between the North and
South, and between the Bourbon element Of
the South and the Republicans residents in
their midst, through the very small end of
its horn. 1t takes no broad and expansive
view of the case, such as would seek the
greatest good Of the greatest number of the
American people. We are either one coun-
try and one people, each alike entitled to
the protection of all our rights in every sec
tion of the country, or we are q disintegatcd
and broken nation, whose fragments are
held together, not from legitimate causes of
cohesion, but from momentary circum-
stance and accident, as it were, and are
liable to fall apart under severe pressure.
This is not sound condition for the coun-
try to be in, but it is inevitable, so long as
men are prosecuted even unto death for po-
litical opinions sake in the South.
The IiTyinidn seems to think that calling
The REPuBLICAN ""a bear with sore head""
is fair Offset to its want Of sympathy with
all the policies Of the present Admiuistra-
ton, as well as for its dislike of the South
ern policy, which murders men simply be-
cause they insist upon their right to assert
their political principles and vote according
TO the dictates of their own conscicnces. We
must submit to be thus characterized, for
we cannot yield the right to differ from the
Administration whennvar. I"" s~. j""dy'neut,
it departs from what we regard to be the
line of duty to Republican principles and
the Republican party. The only differences
we have had with this Administration CEN
tire at that point, and that only, and no
matter what hard names may be meted out
to us we cannot change our attitude or sense
of duty on that account. THE NATIONAL
REPUBLICAN, though it may have acted
like ""a bear with sore head"" under
the Presidents policies, it has acted
in sympathy and accord with ninety
nine out of every hundred Repub-
licans throughout the entire domain
of the United States This should satisfy
us as to the justice and propriety of our
course, and further, while we have views,
we have no quarrel with the President and
his administration, however widely we may
differ with them as to what is wisest and
best on the other hand, we shall warmly
sustain them in all that seems to be for the
best good of tho country, as we under
stand it,


The TTrginian affects to think that there
is no conspiracy against the Government ;
but it rcirans from all reference to the
other wrongs enumerated by us as cause of
dissatisfaction and uncasncss. on the part of
the country. If there is no conspiracy
against the Presidents title, what, let us
ask, is the cause or use of the POTTER in
vestigation? And certainly q movement
to upset his legal title is a conspiracy
against law and the stability Of Government.
We are not surprised that the Jryinidn
is startled at the prospect that
the ""stawarts"" with the Man on Horse
back"" perhaps, at their head, are to enter
again upon the possession and control of
this Government. All such know that when
that hour comes the principles and laws of
reconstruction will no longer be trampled
under foot with impunity, and the rights of
all citizens at the South will be preserved
if not respected by the Democrats there and
elsewhere On this account those whom the
IIrgiaian represents dread that day."

expression, Is tall, with figure extremely we'll pro-
portoned. Her demeanor and her answers TO the
questions Of counsel indicated that she was fairly edu-
Gated. She appeared to realize that her position as
the principal witness against her father on trial
for his life was an awiully responsible one,
and this feeling made itself manifest before
she had completed her testimony. She was
attirsd In the deepest mourning, which contrased
finely with a clear fresh complexion. Her eyes were
studioIsly kept downcast her words were carefully
considered and deliberately uttered. Her testimony
terrible revealed her hatred OF her ather and
produced q desire to turn ones eyes away from her
ana listen only to the damaging evidence she was
uttering against her parent. This created profound
shudder in court. SO intense was her apparently
unnatural desire TO damage the prisoners case that
the prosecuting counsel were obhged to check her
frequently.

Yet it is dangerous to let him live, and altogether the people of his neighborhood are in a quandary and see no way of saving themselves from impending destruction except by moving away to some other part of the country and leaving the man to exert his activities solely upon inanimate objects and the lower animals.

Special Dispatch to the GAZETTE.
NEW CASTLE, Dec. 12.-The Court,
last evening, before adjournment, order
ed the publication Of the liquor licenses
granted and refused, and in accordance
with this order CLERK of the Peace Spring
er, this morning, courteously furnished
the reporters with the desired informa-
ton.


Mr.. Springer said that in his opinion,
the action of the Court in regard to ap-
plications for license to sell liquor was
part of the records of the Court, and
should not be published in the newspapers
though it was accessible to every citizen
who desired to examine the Court records
in the usual manner, by applying to the
Clerk of the Peace. As long as the Court
did not order to the contrary, he felt au-
thorized to carry out this view, but when
the Court ordered the publication, as
was the case last evening, he considered
it his duty TO comply with the order.


The result of the Courts action at this
term WAS the approval of forty-two ap-
plirdtions, and the non-approval of thir-
teen. The full list is as follows:

An adjourned meeting of City Council was
held last evening, Mr.. Lichtenstein, the
President, in the chair.


The Finance Committee made report
recommending the rate of assessment for
this year 10 be 50 cents per one hundred
dollars, for school purposes, and sS cents
for city purposes, making total of $1.2O
per hundred dollars.


After very interesting debate, earnest,
dignified and unusually animated, In which
Windle, Lynch, Paynter, Chandler, Merton,
Baker, and Hazlett participated, the re-
port was adopted.


An anonymous communication, presented
by Mr.. Windle, was ruled out of order, and
the motion to have the same read was lost.

Republican villainy made the South solid

shrek, in patriotic horror, that treason is
as rampant as ever and that there must be
repression in the shape of Solid North.


In the same way, Russian tyranny has


evoked the evil spirit of Nihilism, and the
government proposes to lay it with little
more tyrsnpy-For- centuries the genius
of Russian rule has been simply terror
ism. Let eerf or citizen offend anybody in
office-from the Gear down to the local
m magstrate-and he could expect the
knout or Siberia, without trial and with
out even having the choice of evils. Spies
and government agents abound; the
secrets of households are known to Minis.
ters of State through domestic treachery
affection for the government counts for
nothing, fear for everything; virtue is not
relied on as an element of the public peace.
ard coercion is expected to satisfy the
demands in that respect.


The natural fruit of such tree is begin
ming to ripen-it is hatred. Fear too long
too exclusive in its mastery,
sooner or later finds itself maturing into
hatred. Terror can only be kept alive by cru
city, and there is no heart 80 guileless as to
be forever incapable of resentment, no fear
so complete as to silence memory. Tradi-
ton carries from one generation to another
the tale of oppression, tho debt Of wrong
accumulates and bears interest, the sobs of
one age become the murmurs of second
the open defiance of q third, aud finally the
outbnrst that ends one era and commences
another. Russia is now entering upon the |
age of popular defiance. Nihilist societies |
abound in spite of her espionage, assassins |
strike down her M ost active agents and are |
acquitted by sympathetic juries, soldiers
in the field are found participating in rev.
dictionary plots and university students
protest with seditious boldness against i'm
perial acts. Discomfort has fairly gained
q foothold among the people and no longer
confines its expression to timid whisper.


The fact is that in all countries the pop
ular will is law, whether Inscribed
upon the statute book or not Even in a
republic an unpopular law is disregarded
by lenient juries, and tardy justice ia sup
plemented by Lynch court. Under a
despotism 1t is with great difficulty and
very slowly that an ignorant, besotted
population grows into a knowledge of the
situation sufficiently intelligent and gener-
al to rank as public opinion, but when
that has happeaed it becomes inexorable
Law before which the most frantic rage of
Gear or Emperor would be impotent. Pub

constitution of every country-living and
prevailing while written rules are growing
obsolete and lapsing into oblivion. The
people are the State, and they invariably
show it whenever they have their mind
made up and their will fixed.


In Russia the tide of intelligence is
rising-not the moral intelligence which
confronts wrong with virtue, but the mere
ly intellectual intelligence which knows
how to combat one wrong with another,
despctism with assassination, tyranny with
anarchy. Society there has been corrupt

New Orleans, has given q rare illustration Of
self-sacrifce. While away on his summer

Columbus (Ga.) Times: There are
thirty-one dogs TO every hundred sheep in
the state, or nearly three TO one. As these
dogs destroy 2S,625 sheep annually, worth
S73 S52, this Is 3 per cent. OF the value OF all
the sheep in the state. Yet the annual prof
its are So per cent. Remove the cause OF
the loss, and the profits will be 70 per cent.
on the capital invested. This amount would
in very few years be quadrupled, when
the clear profits on the average amount as
invested In 1874, would be 1882 6s7 per
annum.


A number of leading southern papers,
notably those Of South Carolina, are pro.
nouncing positively against the code duello





its enactments. The Augusta Chronicle,
speaking on this subject, says: People are
actually demanding that duelsts shall be
punished like ordinsry criminals. Govern.
ors and solicitors and courts and juries may
suddenly unite in bringing some duelist
man slayer and his seconds to the cafold,
and in having him done to death bya vulgar
rope. When this is done all the chivalry
and romance Of the code will exhale. and
murder will no longer be considered one Of
the fine ars.


The Oldest man in Georgia is said to
be freedman known a. John Williams, who
resides near Albany. A correspondent OF
the Macon Telegraph writing Of him says:
He was engaged in hauling lumber and
other building material for the erection of a
fort in Virginia during the war of the revo-
luton, at period two years prior to the
surrender OF Lord CORVALLIS, which event
occurred, as you will remember, on tine 10th
Of October, 1881. As the father OF FIVE chill
dren, he reasonably claims that ne was at
the surrender of CORVALLIS twenty.seven
ye'rs old. Add this to the difference be-
tween 1881 and 1873, and it will show the
amazing longevity of one hundred and
twenty'four years.

and is used in bringing to the city coal from
the pits some seventeen miles distant. On
the 1st Of August the Palermo left the pits
for Lynchburg, and made the return trip in
one week. The boat does not wash the
banks as much as the boats drawn by mules

much interest and surprise along the route

arm and hand so he could not use it, Being
badly frightened, and in the rscufile hurting
his other hand, and, supposing he was bitten
by the snake, he ran for his house, the head

three hundred yards before freeing himself

then found he was not bitten, but had hurt

ages Of property burned by Mont.
gomery's tenants, q mutual society,
OF which Montange Is alleged to
have been an active member be-
tween December 20, 1873 aud
September I, 1876. Clarke Is said
to be the largest land owner
iu this State, owning between
40, 900 and 1000 acres in the coun-
ties of Green, Dutchess, Oneida,
Otsego and Montgomery. The af-
fidavit of Clarke sets forth that he
became possessed of the lands
through a grant by the Colonial
Council to VIM. Cory aud others.
The associates of Cory transferred
an undivided moiety to George
Clark, an ancestor OF the present
owner. During the anti-rent ex-
citement from 1916 to 1850 suit was
brought on petition of the tenants
by the State VS.. Clark to vacate
his letters patent on account of
fraud in obtaining the grants.
This suit was decided in Clark's
favor in every court. Clark's
father had let out the land 10
farms of 2C0 acres each for pei iods
of different lengths. These leases
began to expire in large numbers
and new leases were offered to the
tenants at an increase of so cents to
81 so per acre. This increase met
with great opposition in the Mont
gomery Tenants Mutual Society.
Quarrels have constantly occurred.
Up to the present time property
worth thousands of dollars has
been destroyed and it is believed
the Society still exists, although its
movements are conducted with
great secrecy.

Our intercourse, gentlemen, these last

heard there. The city affairs were earnest

me great satisfaction to thank you, gen.

city, for services rendered and honest
ly performed I believe, nay, know,
gentlemen, that such is the verdict of
our people.


Gentlemen, we are on the point of sew
ering connections, which cold and pos
sibly distrustful at the start, have become
strong and warm. Some of us met a
short year ego, almost as strangers, we
part, / feel, as fast friends. Pleasant
recoilections of business and committee
meeting are in store for you and me.


For your uniform kindness to me, 1
cannot find fitting words to expresss my
warmest thanks.


No presiding officer could have been
treated with more regard, consideration
and sincere friendship.


If have erred, gentlemen, if my rul- |

you will kindly forgive aud bear in mind |
that the chair must enforce the rules, |

he presides, that he cannot knowingly |
disregard ""charter and ordinances, that |

crs,"" their habits, and their country. They are
Il curious race of mOuntaineers who inhablt
several wild couatics of West Virginia. Their
origin is unknown. The pure Saugcr is be
ing by himself. The Digger Indian is the
nearest parallel to him, but the SAUCER is better
physically, and has more intelligence than the
Digger. The colonies of the Saugers were re-
CruitCd by CyScrers from both armies during
the war, and the influence of these foreigners
among them has probably elevated the moral
and social condition of the race. Lawful mar.
riage is unknown among them, and they have
no use for lawyers, doctors, or preachers, or
schooltcacherS. They live in the woods, and
among the rocky Businesses, far away from
highways and civilized settlements. Their
abodes are logcabns, with mud Chimncys, and
sometimes caves and holes in the ground, They
live on game, and include in the list which
furnishes their bill ottare, raccoons, opoSsums,
grOund-hogs, squirrels snakes, owls, crows,
pOlecats, and other animals that come
to their traps. The women drink tea Of sassa-
tras and the roots Of the golden rod In the
spring they find Il dellcacy in brook trout,
which people the mountain streams and pools


They despisc frogs, which are about the only
living things the Saugcr does not eat, while
fried grasshoppers are rare luxury. The
Saugers have a commerce, too, They dig the
ginseng root which is plentiful in the noun
tans, steal into the nearest settlement by night
and sell it by appointment with their grocer,
and steal out again with corn meal and bacon,
of which they have learned the value, when
their small grain is scarce. The ginseng is
shipped to China, where it commands a high
price So they contribute to the commerce OF

A Few Facts about the Action of the Hou,


Thereon,",,"n House
Thereon.


In view Of the action recently taken by the
House Committee OH Elections In the con-
tested election case of Lynch against Chal.
mcrs, from the Sixth Mississippi District, re.
view of the case is not inappropriate.


The colored voters have majority in said
district of about 10000. At every
election held in the State since reconstruction,
prior to lS75, with one exception when light
vote was pOllcd, the Republican majority has
never been less than 1900 in the counties of
which the district is now composed.


In 1876 Mr.. Lynch was the candidate of the
Republican party, having been unanimously
nominated for reelection to Congress in cor.
vcntion composed largely of cx-Confcderates,
and received the general support of the party.
Chalmers was the candidate of the Democratic
party, and received the general support of his
party. 1t is an indisputable fact that the col.
ored men voted the Republican ticket in all
localities where they were allowed to vote at
all with as much unanimity rs they ever did
| Although q Republican nomination in such a
district would ordinarily be regarded as equiv.
alent to election in the absence of serious
party divisions, yet Chalmers, the candidate of
/ the minority party was declared elected by u
majority of 1900.


| To overcome the large and overwhelming
Republican majority In the district three
methods We're adopted: First, disfranchse-
| ment of Republican voters; second violence
third, frauds. In the counties Of Warren and
| Claiborne there were not less than 5000 col
Orcd men who were positively denied tho priv.
! ilege of registering and consequently the right
to vote, aS no one can vote who has not been
| previously registered. These men of course
were denied the privilege of registration
| through legal subteriuges and tcchnicalities.
| They were required to give affirmative answers
| to certain unnecessary and unauthorized ques.
tiOns as u condition precedent to registration,
and whenever the applicant for registration
would fail to answerany one of these questions
| to the satisfaction of the registrars, he was
told to stand aside, although he might be per.
sOnally known to the registrars to be quail
| fed aud legal voter. This course was pursued
in Warren County In every voting precinct
outside of the city of Vcksburg, (where the
bulk of the Republican vote of the county II, !
except one; but in Vicksburg, where the bulk
of the Democratic vote of the
county Is, no such questions were
| asked, and thus every white man in the county
who desired to do so was registered while
ONLY about sixteen hundred out of about six
thousand COlOred voters in the county were
allowed to he registered. The same course
was pursued ia Claiborne County.


In Claiborne and jefferson Counties such n
reign of terror was inaugunted by the Demo.
cratic rifle clubs rs to make the election n
complete farce Whenever Mr.. Lynch At
tempted to fill his appointments to speak iu
| those counties he was met by hundreds OF
armed Democrats and his meetings were dis
| pcrsed ii Fl Grms. Mr.. Lynch was told by the
| then recognized leader Of the Democratic
party Of Jefferson County that no Lynch
should not be allowed to make u speech in the
County When asked his reason for making
this assertion he frankly stated that tho col
Orcd voters of the county were then disOrgan-
lied, and that If he Lynch were allowed to
make speeches in the county tho cOOred men
would - again organized, and 1t would be m.
| possible Tor the Democrats to carry the county.
| As the COlOred men were not Ia a condition
to defend their rights by force of arms the
effort 10 canvass the county was abandoned,
and it was returned as having given Demo.
| cratic majority Of about LOO out Of total
vote Of about 1900. The registration book )
show that there are about 1000 colorcd and 7OO
white voters in the county. The Republican
majority at previous elections had been about
200 Tho high-handed Outrages that we've
committed in this county were carried so far
that some of tho then leaders Of the DcmoC-
rdcy have become disguised, and do not hest.
tate to denOunce them, but without effect.

Democrat in 1875, and who was according 10
his own admissions, party TO the frauds and"

But the Republican majority In tho district
was so large that the tactics of the Democracy
were not sufficient to overcome II, and accord
ingly, of the votes actually poled on the day
Of the election, Lynch had . majority Of about
1000, and this majority was changed into q
Democratic majority Of 1900, through the
most Outrageous and unblushing frauds. The
| frauds that were committed In the counties Of
Adams, Warren, Issaquena, Washington, Goa
homa, and Sharkey, to say nothing Of the
others, made change Of between 5000 and
10000 In the vote Of district These allcga-
tions were all distinctly set forth In the notice
of contest. As soon as tho result of tho elec-
tion was known, Lynch employed an attorney
TO take charge Of tho case, to formally pre-
pare the notice Of contest which he had made
verbally during tho campaign, and send IL by
registered letter to tho home of the member
elect for personal service, which was done. But
the letter was detained by q clerk in the
Vicksburg office until the time allowed by
law for serving the notice had nearly expired,
aud then sent the wrong route. This
clerk subsequently, admitted to Lynchs
N hat hn had haa ,aaI th.
Nicksburg post-ofice as q consideration for his
services In this matter. Chalmers, knowing
that he had not been fairly elected, and being
particularly anxious TO prevent an exposition
OF the methods that were resorted to for tho
purpose OF returning him, did not hesitate 10
| take advantage Of this technicality about the
service Of the notice, and refused to recognize
the same Us legal. Mr.. Lynch instructed his
\ attorney to proceed with taking the testi-
mony the same though there had been no
| informality In the service Of notice. This he
did, but with poor success. The registrars In
Warren County refused to produce the regis
tration- books or to furnish certified list of
the registered voters Of the county or TO
allow any one else to have the books for
that purpose. They also refused to answer
any direct questions that were asked them
| relative to the manner OF conducting the reg
istration. In Jefferson County the officer be-
fore whom the witnesses were to bo examined
was threatened with personal violence If he
| allowed any witnesses to be examined before
him, and did not sit In the case. In Issaquena
| County Lynchs attorney and the officer be-
| fore whom the witnesses were being examined
were arrested, tried, convicted, and fined for
taking testimony, as was alleged without
authority of law. The accused parties took
an appeal to the Circuit Court and gave bond
for their appearance at the next term Of said
court. Tho cases, of course, were dismissed
without going through the formalities Of
trial. When the time allowed by law for the
examination Of witnesses by the contestant
had expired, testimony had been partially
taken IN but three counties. When Congress
met, in October last. the sitting member made
q motion before the Committee on Elections
| to have tho case dismissed, on the
ground that he had never been legally
served with notice Of contest. This motion
was argued before tho committee early In Feb
ruary. The committee referred the papers in
the case to subcommittee, with instructions
| to ascertain whether or not the case has suih-
cient merit to warrant an investigation. After
two months consideration, tho subcommittee
reported, and it was agreed that the case
| should be thrown out not, however, on the
ground that the sitting member had never
been legally served with notice of contest, be-
cause the testimony that had already been
taken was not sufficient to overcome the ma
jarity NY which tie sitting member was re-
turned elected, and that the present Congress
wauld expire before the necessary testimony
could be taken in substantiation Of the allie
cations set forth In the notice Of contest 1t
will be seen, therefore, that the case was dis
missed, not for the want of equity, but simply
for the want Of time.


A man is therefore allowed to retain seat
in the National House of Representatives who
is simply the official product of an organized
system Of frauds aud swindles upon the ballot
box. A man whose title to the position
which he holds Is sealed with tho innocent
blood of hundreds of his countrymcn, and
whose so-callcd election was procured at the
cost and sacrifice Of every principle of moral
ity, equity, and justice.

Secretary Evarts gives his opinions else
where upon the effect Of the cipher disclosures,
the Western elections, and Republican pros
poets in New-YOrk. When the Secretary says
that THE TRIBUNE's disclosure of the cipheTs
will naturally greatly strengthen the Republi-
can party, and predicts that the Republicans
will carry the Legislature in this State, he
will find far more ready acquiescence than
when he expresses the opinion that 1.-THE Solid
South need not any longer be feared rs n
political power"" This is q statement calcu-
lated to bring broad smile to the thoughtful
| cOntenances of those politicians who propose
that the Solid South shall elect the next Presl-
dent, and furnish the next Secretary of dhe
Treasury.


There is document printed on another





ner, and all other Democrats for that matter,
both of the Tilden and anti-Tildcn scCts. 1t
is the indignant protest of a majority OF the
delegation which placed Mr.. Faulkner upon
the Democratic State Committee, under dis
tinCt pledge that he would vote for Mr.. Pur-
cell for Chairman, against the course which he
carried out in spite of their protest-that Of
betraying them and making himself the
Tilden candidate for Chairman as against
Mr.. Purcell This Is a quarrel in which
The TRIBUNE takes only a news in
terest. But at the same time THE TRIBUNE
has no objection to saying that no one who
has contemplated Mr.. Faulkner sliding about
in the SinuOus ways of State politics can doubt
the truth of the charge. A year ago Mr..
Faulkner was an anti-TIlden man, but not
without his price this year he turned Iilden
for a consideration. He is one of those
thrifty politicians who sell out so often that
eventually they cease to be worth buying.
Mount Vernon, in Indiana, would be prom
ising field for missionary work, or would serve
as a substantial basis for a large and efficient
police force. If the town is to be judged by
the recent occurrences there, it is composed





too many of them, the worst sort Of
outlaws or mere madmen. 1t is altogether a
shocking stOry-this account of what the dis
match truly calls ""a series of disgusting crimes
""and tragic revenges."" The crimes were those OF
seven or eight drunken negroes; the revengcs
the assault upon the jail where the men
were confined, the stabbing OF one of them,
and the hanging of four Others-were the
work of men who could not plead the
frenzy OF drunkenness as an excuse,
and who were intelligent enough to know
that they were doing murder in usurping the
functions of tie courts. Yet they were so
eager for the lives of these five black
brutes that they formed a small army
to meet the State troops which were
said to be coming, and actually planted
cannon in the streets. 1t was a highly de-
liberate lynching-a disgrace to the country
that it should have occurred in the midst of
a bOasted civilization, disgrace to the State
which lacked tho self-respect to repress 1t, a
disgrace to the community in which such a
deliIium of crime was possible.


Democratic opinion upon the cipher dis
patches continues to be singularly unanimous.
The Hon. Robert c. Winthrop, who says with
truth, that he is no longer actively engaged in
politics, and expresses an opinion reluctantly, is
nevertheless constrained to admit that the dis
datches /"" if true, place an indeible stain on
all concerned"" aud adds: al do not
chow they can very well be explained,
""and they exhibit a lamentable want
""of political and moral rectitude."" Ex-
Governor Bedle, of New-Jersey, will say
absolutely nothing-which is equivalent to
saying a good deal. Congressman SOuthard,
of Ohio, struggles hard TO believe that Mr..
1iden had nothing to do with the kilograms,
but is compelled to think they are quite
extraordinary"" and ""Of very compromis-
""ing nature and are likely to exclude Mr..
""Tilden from any further share in the
""party councils"" Congressman Hardenbergh,
of New-Jersey, regards the whole at
tempt to buy the Presidency as an
infamous outrage"" the perpetrators
of which should be exposed and punished.
And that pure and incOrruptible statesman,
Mr. Leon Abbott, thinks the matter ought to
go before the Grand jury; and when Mr..
Leon Abbott recommends the Grand Jury for
fellow Democrat the case is bad indeed.

sight to look upon at the Ranchito
and in its immediate neighborhood.
So far as we have been able to
learn, there has been comparative.
ly little loss by burning or other
wise of the corn crop of the valley,
and the estimate made some time
since of ten thousand acres of corn
in the valley will not, we think, be
materially reduced. The yield per
acre will be above the average and
the quality excellent. There are
fields whose average yield has been
estimated by competent persons at
100 bushels per acre. The weather
has been peculiarly favorable this
year for the growth of corn, and
farmers can calculate on good
market for their immense surplus.

cit insisted upon the vote being taken, but
Saville savagely refused to do 80, and
finally upon being pressed struck Mr..
Pritchett and the two men clinched. They
were forced apart BY friends, but Saville
was dissatisfied and drew revolver in his
rage, threatening to blow hole through
his opponent, but peace was at length re-
stored.


Just before the Ninth ward polls closed
crowd of some seventy-fve or eighty ne.
groes came up, and threatening to take
possession, behaved in q very disorderly
manner. Word was at once sent to the
nolice station, and as there were no police~
men about, Chief O'Toole drove over, but
the negroes having got wind of word being
sent for aid, had dispersed before he ar
rived.


At Fifth and Spruce street. the eastern
precinct of the Fourth ward, ripple of ex-
citement was created at about $50 O'Clock,
when q man came up to vote and had his
vote challenged by John Gallagher, who
| had been very drunk and quite abusive all
afternoon, and the man struck him. Gal
lapher then turned to officer Traynor and
ordered him to arrest the man, and tmme~
diately caught the officer by the collar and
| commenced hauling him around the street.
officer Traynor not being used to such
tbinps of course did not enjoy It, and finally
| settled the festive John with smart blow
| in the eye.


In the evening the colored folks had
warm contest in the western Precinct OF the
Fifth ward by Jack Boston and Peter Blake


getting together and mopping up the gutter
with each other by turns.

glad indeed when, on reaching the

Arriving at Silverado we found
the town or camp situated In the
Santiago cai1on, the width of the
canon being about 300 feet, and
containing q population of about
100. The place, we are informed,
is u true representation of an old.
time California mining camp, the
only difference being that few of
the miners are camping here with
their families. Mr.. p. a. Clark, of
Anaheim, has an assay office here,
and Is also Recorder of the district.
Mr.. Clark was the first to take any
interest in the new discovery, and
SO sanguine was he that the miies
would prove important that he
surveyed out a town. calling it
Silverad0. He has II Gozy little
office, neatly fitted up and fur
nished in good shape. We are in
debted to him for information in
regard to the mines. Mr.. Clark Is
interested in severa! mines in the
district, which promise well.
Among the improvements made
and in contemplation, we notice
that Mr.. Cash Harvey has opened
a feed yard and blacksmith shop,
and new eating and lodging
house will soon be opened by Mr..
q. g. Gillette; a meat market will
soon be opened by Mr.. Tighe, and
q stock of goods will soon be put in
by Mr. Pierce. of Fountain valley.
Town lots in the Cuisines"" part of
the town are selling at $50 each,
and those further up or down the
caiion at $25. There il no doubt
but what Silvcrado is destined to
soon become tlourishing town.
After taking a general view of
the town we commenced the ascent
to the Blue Light Milling Co 5
mine, owned by Messrs. Harvey,
Thistlcwaite, Dunlap and Jackson.
| Arriving at the mine we found Mr..
This,lewaite and number of work.
men busily ut work taking out the
ore. They have on the dump at
least eighty tons of assorted ore,
and have taken out altogether
about $50 tons, averaging $500 10
the ton. They have ten burros en-
gagged in packing the rock from the
mino to place near their bee ranch
in the caiI,n below-about three
miles d istan;-whera it Is assorted
and shiI ped to San francisco. Mr..
Thistlewaile informed us that they
could take out the ore faster than
one hundred burros could pack it
away. Last week we mentioned
that the suit of Taylor & Co., VS..
the Blue Light Mining Go. had
been decided against the latter
Company, which may probably
lead our readers to believe that the
Blue Light Mining Co.'s title to
the mine had been shaken. Not 80.
The question of title has never been
thrown into court. There Is no
doubt that they will get possession
of what they claim, and what
rightfully belong to them.


There are probably about 120 10.
cations made. On the Gray Back
lode, the first extension north is
the Mountain View claim (the or
iginal discovery claim) owned by
Messrs. Sears & Lake. They feel
very jubilant in regard to the fu.
ture prospects of their mine, and
have we'll defined ledge the crop.
pings of which assay from $13 to
500. They claim to have struck O
vein which will assay $500 to the
ton.


On the Gray Lack lode there are
number of claims, the second ex.
tension north, and adjoining Sears
& Lake, is the Southern Belle,
owned by Cassidy, Standard, Smith,
aud Taylor Il Co. The groupings
assay from $5 to $l0O. The first
extension south is the Blue Light
Co., mentioned above. The second
extension south is the claim Of
Dunlap & Flanaghan. The ores
taken from these claims assay from
$76 to $350-the low grade free
milling ore; the high grade being
smelling are. The fourth extern
sion south is tho Astor, owned by
Rumble & Jackson; the fifth south
being the Elith, owned by Granet
g. Wenger, of Anaheim.


West of the Gray Back and run.
ming parallel with the same, is the
0phir lode. The first extension
north Is the Fairview, owned by E
A. Pullen and others. The second
extension north is the Alpha Co.
The work done has been OH the
line between the two, having cut
in about four feet, at q depth of
twenty feet from the ravine. The
ledge is well defined, showing an
abundance of medium grade of
free milling ore. There are q num-
Der of other locations on the Ophir
lode, all considered valuable.


West of the Ophir is the Galena
lode. 'Khe first extension north is
owned by e. ""A. Pullen, p. A. Clark
and Others. Second, the Emma
Company; third, owned by J. j.
Quinn and others; fourth is tho
Southern Slope, owned by Hunt
ington & Company. There was
quite an excitement in Silverado
caused by the owners of the South
ern Slope mine striking vein as
saying 81, 233 80 to the ton. Ad-
Joining is the Mooreland, owned by
J. q. Kimble, of Santa Ana, and
g. M. Woodruff, If Anaheim.
Among the other claims on this
lode Is the Thanksgiving, owned
by Lynch & Nimo. At all points
where openings have been made
ore of good quality has been
found. The Silver Belt lode assays
$400 to $500 gold. New discoveries
are being made daily.

SAN FRANCISCO, March 13.-For
some months past the grocery store
of b. +. Levy, 537 Clay street, has
been Systematically robbed of a
great variety of articles. The dep
relations could not he traced to any
of the employees, and no Indications
were found that the doors or WIN
dows had been forced. On the
night of February 9th the safe was
neatly broken open and the con-
tents, to the value of several hun
dred dollars, taken. The police ex-
amined the premises, and, by as
to a iittle-used loft in u re-
mote corner OF the store, found u
hole leading into the room above.
This had evidently been cut from
below and was intended for blind.
A trap was next found in the rear
of the store opening into the cellar,
where there was found All arch
way about eighteen inches high
leading into Il space running
from the front to the rear of the
and about six feet in
width, occupied by gas and water
pipes. Another trap was found
which led up into the barber saloon
of Adolph Magazini. An officer
was detailed to keep watch in the
store, and last night Magazini was
Al iOn IN
plunder. The officer, with levelIed
revolver, ordered him to surrender.
He made rush for the trap,
when the officer fired shot
and closed with the burglar. Both
fell through the tap. After des-
perate struggle Magazini released
himself, and crawling through the
archway, gained his own store.
The officer then sought the street
to prevent escape by the front
door, when Magazini fled by the
rear door and made good his es.
cape. He was arrested later, and
is now locked up. Magazini has
always heretofore borne good
and his systematic bur-
glaries and desperate resistance
and escape, excite much comment.
A good quantity of Levy's prop
erty was found on his premises.

DECIDING THE PRISONERS


This counter excitement diverted the rage OF the
people from tbs prisoners, and acting under cooler
counseis, 1t was decided to wait I'LL night and
lynch the prisoners quietly at all hazards Armed
men patroled the ja, and Court House all day, and
the streets were flied with them, though there
was no demonstration and difficulty occurred In
tho afternoon funeral notices of the murdered

The cannon, under guard OF ton men, was stl In

a very weak structure. On entering the door there
six cages cells OF iron, surrounded
by a wide corridor Four Of the prisoners were soa-
1nsd In one cell nearest to the entrance and old Horrr

Ono Of the most atrocious murders every perpc-
,rated was that OF the French family vacelot con-
sistiue OF four persons, on Wednesday night. and
which had q fitting solution to-day. Last
night the Coroner's jury rendered verdict finding
that the murdered persons came to their deaths al
tho hands OF Pierre Provost who was under arrest
suspicion. This, coupled with apprehension of lynch
ing seemingly proved much for Provost for upon
opening the jail this morning he found dead, hav


ing hanged himself during the night This act seemed
the more remarkable as he has remained stoid and
immovable IN his claim Of innocence, and the over
whelmng crcumstantial evidence produced no visible
change In hts dcmeanoE


THE DISCOVERY.


Al nvs minutes. aitor eight this morning Deputy
sheriff Runner into the Jail to breakfast TO
the tour prisoners The Jail has upper OF cells
four In each tier. Provost occupied . cell In the
lower tier, while the remaining prisoners were IN
the upper cells, one occupying cell directly above
him. Provost not appearing for breakfast Runner d.
rec,ed another prisoner to call him. He opened tho
door, looked n and reported 10 Runner that Provost
n
found the condition therein as toows:-Provost had


tied towel around his neck his coat no had fastened
TO the upper bench. which was about four iee from
across ench other, leaving openings OF about four
| inches square. Through these openings the coat
sleeves ung down. One Of these passed through
the towel and tied to tho other sleeve Provost hav
ing made this arrangement placed his body
neck and there remained until death ensued from
| stranguatioo His body was In diagonal position,


his head being the door, hts feet resting
| door. Ihe right hand resting on the lower bench
/ ana the lett hand hanging down. Hts head was not
over three feet from the floor, making u necessary
for him 70 draw body up and by resolute deter
mination hod It In that position until vitality was
| gone.


| Assistance being procured tho body was removed
| to an undertaking establishment, wncre the Coro-
ner,s Jury impanced and.a verdict rendered In

Ing prisoners jail thought he heard slight strus

Tuesday night of this week Thos.
Rice, colored preacher, was taken
from the parish Jail at Bayou Sara by
a crowd of laWless men, and being
conveyed to point half mile from
town, on the Woodville road, was
hung to the limb of mulberry tree.
The offense for which this unfortunate
negro was thus cruelty murdered was
the killing of a prominent politician
under circumstances which fully just
ified the deed. During the night of
Saturday preceding the last election,
crowd of men visited the home of
Rice, near Bayou Sara, with the evil
dent intention of ""bulldozing"" him.
He heard them coming, however, and
escaped to the woods. Finding their
game had flown, the mob set fire to
the house, destroying its :.entire con-
tents, and while the flames were still
raging Rice fired upon the crowd of
incendiaries from secreted position
in the woods near at hand, killing one
Th0s. G. West, the Democratic can
didate for Sheriff.


Shortly after this occurrence Rice
left the parish and went to Pointe
Coupee. Last week the Sheriff of
West Feliciana went over to Pointe
Coupee and arrested Rice, but crowd
of the latter's friends rescued the pris-
oner. The Sheriff organized a posse,
returned to Pointe Coupee and ar
rested the riugleaders in the rescue.
Rice came forward and gave himself
up under promise of protection and
fair tlial. How this promise was kept
the opening sentence OF this article
will show.


While law, order and good feeling
prevail in all other portions of the
State, violence and lawlessness hold
imperial sway in West Feliciana and

 Captain Adam Kramer, of Camp Apache. called upon us to-day, in company with Price Behan. The Captain bears a good reputation, both as an officer and gentle man, among soldiers and citizens. He is here by the order of the Court to testify in the Little Colorado lynching affair, he hav- ing been called upon, in his capacity as an Army officer, to make arrests, etc.

 Governor Hoyt who sui the people O this Territory as their executive officer, has not learned anything further in regard to hls transfer from Arizona to Idaho. The c vernon is satisfied with his present field of jurisdiction and il seems to all candid, fair minded people. that where both the people and the Governor are suited he should be retained where he now is. Again when a change is to be made it seems but fair ana right that the wishes of the people of the Territory should be consulted to a certain extent.

 The special grand jury, empanneled for the purpose of investigating the Little Colorado difficulties, etc., have found bills against Juan Sedilio, Manuel Lucero, and Madaleno Calderon. In addition to these, we understand other indictments have been found against parties not under arrest, whose names we suppress. The whole of this Little Colorado trouble will be the means of throwing the County several thou sand dollars deeper into debt, with the chance of no person being convicted of the crimes as charged in the indictment. An other great drawback and injury n renew ing these old matters, at this time, is the calling away from home of several farmers and others, living at Springerville, Round Valley and other places, a distance of from t50 to 200 miles, without recompense."

The Lynchburg Yrgiaida publishes q
liberal extract from our article in reply 10
the bitter and dsloyal criticism of the sa-
vannah (Ga.) Recorder upon the President 5
message, and characterizes what we say as
atrocious."" The TirgiHiaa is q Conserva-
tive journal, which can see but one side of
the Solid South"" and that is the Southern
side. ltcondemns nothing that is ""atrocious""
or even moderately wrong in the South, nor
has 1t even word of commendation for that
which is palpably right In the Government
| or on the part ofthe North since the war 1t
processes to an ardent desire for ""the restora-
tion Of ancient fraternity"" between the
two sections of the country, and yet we have
to discover it in any degree counseling q
respect for the Constitution, the laws, and
the equal rights of citizenship when they
are trampled under foot by the Democratic
party. 1t has no word of rebuke for the
Recorder for its worse than ""atrocious"" senti-
ments in its comment upon the Presidents 5
aliusion to the lawlcssness OF the South and
his demand that the laws relating to the
elective franchise shall be respected at the
South MS they are at the North. 1t has no
condemnation for the call of the Recorder
upon the South to assume an aggressive po-
sition toward the Government and its de-
mand for q due respect for the Constitution
and the laws on the part of the South. Its
perceptiye faculties do not seem to discover
anything wrong in the demand of the Re
cordcr that the South shall speak out and
submit no longer to such impeachments
either from the President or the leaders of
the Republican party, when the impeach-
ments alluded TO is mild reference to the
outrages and defiance Of law and right that
have marked the history of the recent cleo
tions in several southern States None of
these things seem TO attract even the attcn-
ton, much less the condemnation, of our
Conservative contemporary. On the other
hand, they seem to meet with its
tacit approval, and it thus places
itself in line substantially with those
who antagonize the Constitution, the laws,
and the President. 1t seems to forget that
he has covered his official action with n
sacred obligation to enforce the Constitu-
tion and the laws and to throw the protecting
arm Of the Government around all the cfti-
zens Of the United States, without regard
to color, birth, or condition, and is doing
only his constitutional duty in presenting
the case to Congress as lie understands ii.
1t has not voice to applaud his action any
more than it has TO condemn the frauds,
wrongs, and butchcries that are resorted to
in nearly every Southern State TO secure n
party advantage at the expense Of every
principle of right and justice.


The IirgiaidR is not retcent in its att-
tude toward the Government and its sup
porters. 1t finds speech with which to de-
nOuuce the truth when it is held up in too
strong light to be grateful to its vision
1t is of this that the loyal people of this ma
tion now complain, and of which they will
continue TO complain until remedy comes
in some shape. The South have been
trusted until they have shown mmistak-
ably that they do not hold the Constitution,
the laws, aud rights of citizenship, or
even the Government itself in proper re-
spect under their relations to the nation
which recognizes but one Union, one Con-
stitution, one flag, and one Government
Their apparent fnithlGssness to these
warns of impending danger, and arouses the
loyal sentiment of the country everywhere,
both North and South. 1t is because the
South insults the loyal sense of the ma
ton by acts that are inconsistent with n
proper respect for law and right, that the
loyal press aud people raise a warning voice
and demand q suspension of the outrages
that have disgraced our civilization. And
this voice will not be hushed until right
prevails and wrong and outrage are prop
erly punished and entirely suppressed in
every State in the Union.

The satisfaotion felt by the neigh hborhood in
the funeral observances with which Miss





rest, though it did something to-soothe the
wild grief of the inhabitants of Good Peoples
Hollow, did not hV any means overshadow
heir anxiety for L lens recovery. This John
Thornley, had t, acknowledge to himself when
he went among the crowd assembled in and
about the tent where Peter Lynch's wake was
held. He had come out in q mood of restless
mieery, seeking not 80 much for distraction as
for that bitter tonic of seff-pity "" hica he fan.
oied would be afforded by the sight or other
peoples forgetfolness contrastsd with his own
bafr,, tafx No ,vaS
medicine different from that he had come to
seek the balm of sympst by pergadpg and
true, that its subtle soothing could not but
creep to the heat most resolved to hug its
sorrow in solitude


Bride Thornley,, FOR whose speedy retarn
John had entreatsd, arrived at the Hollow the
hours after her entrance into the house was
installed in full charge of the sick-room.
Order, regularitJ and calm seemed to 'low
her stops, and from that day the invalid began
to mend Bride would not have permit 5ed q
wake to take place within few yards of the
room where her patient lay sick of nervous
fever, and she could not conceal the contempt
she felt fIr the excuses which John and Pelham
urged in excuse of their compliance After o
trihing disagreement, however. on that score,
everything went smoothly. Mrs. Daily, who
was of too anxious q temperament to make 3
good sick nurse, was th ankful to yisd the chit
management of the sck-room to Brides skill
fol hands. and Ellen, who had never in her
days of health songht Brides company, turned |
to her in her suffering and weak mess with an !
absolute clinging dependence that laid a
strong hold on Brides generous nature, and |
banisned exery shade of jealousy or grudging
from her heart for ever. AS day by day little |
tokens of amendment in the PATIENTS state ap- |
peared, aud were atteibuted by DR.. Lynch to
Miss Tnornley's careful nursing, fresh links !
were woven bet weeu these two, and when
Bride dressed Ellen the first day of her
leaving her room she did not feel as if it were
the old rival whom she had distrusted and
been tempted.to envy, whose golden hair she
wit Af. re- hut kbar
some altogether new creature whose charms
and whose manifold sweet -esses were in some
sort posst ssion of her own that conld hardly
be rightly appreciated by anyone but herself. |
1t had not come into her previous experience
to be brought into close intimacy with per.
son TO whom expressions of affection, and ten.
tsneously and folio we'd feeling as necessarily
as breathing does being; aud after the
first surprise she could not deny that this
gracious warmth of nature "" az pleas ant to her
and would be missed as the unclouded sunshine
of southern lauds is m 5ed by those who re-
turn to colder climates. She began to dread
the thought Of living ont of sight of the one
face that now always flushed with pleasure
when she came near, oct of reach of the hands
ever ready tt be stretched out towards her for
welcome or cares es, out of hearing of the voice
that in all the feebleness of sickness had been
so profGse in thanks for every little service
rendered. She did not know that she could
face the blank s1ch q loss would leave any
better than John could really faoe the es-
tran cement he always auticipa ting as the
end of their present engrossment in the D 4lys
SffIirs.


When Ellen was we'll enough to be left for
an hour Of an evening, 3 i 1e and John
used to pace mp and down the short garden
walk in front OF the house while Pelham and
L,sbia INDUCED in endless lovers talk in the
sheltered nook of the bridge head that had
baen the lovers corner since the bridge
was built. Then John always propounded t5e
same plan for their joint future lives which
Bride always listened to with the same con-
seriousness that he was longing ell the time for
her to dispute it's inevitableness, and the same
wonder at herself for the pain it ,st her to be
able to do 80 truthfully. They were to ain
few weeks longer in Ireland till Lesbia was
married, and till such arrangements could bs
made would enable Ellen Daily to manage
the ,od Peoples blow estate, left her by
Anne, adeantageously. Tnen they would take
their departure together and spend year or
so in foreign travel, out of the way of being
called upon to take part in events which the
next year would certainly bring, viz, the de-
paItIre OF Ellen to join Connor ard his friend
in America, or, if such a course conld be safely

Gloucester mackerel schooner, lying 20
about twenty miles off the lightship early
on Sunday morning, sighted two BLACK
objects, seemingly drifting logs close upon
the weather bow. These objects drifted
nearer and then the lookout saw that they
were monster swordfish, far out OF their
latitude. They were backing, motionless,
in the sun. A boat was lowered and was
soon within few lengths of the swordfish.
The barpooner hurled his harpoon with
unerring aim at the smaller swordfsh. The
one slap of it's tail, which is much like
three bladed propeller, the swordhsh dart
ed away, leaving q wake of foam. The
harpooner's line whizzed out from the boat
until thirty five fathoms had gone. Then
there was q sudden stop. Some of the
crew began to congratulate themselves on
the death of the swordfish, but the har-
pooner cried out =: ""Look out, he's com
iDg!""


The swordish darted toward the bow OF
the boat direct. The crew backed water,
but uuavailingly. The sword of the tish
pierced the thick oAken plauking of the
boat as though it WAS tissue paper, and
the beat careeped until water poured IN.
The harpooner escaped by jumping back
ward. With a Ratchet he chopped OF the
part of the sword protruding through the
side aud then he hacked the fish until 1t
died.


This fairy, strangely enough, had not
disturbed the other swordtish. The har-
pooner sent IA nurpoon we'll home just
behind its head, and after dartiDg about
and churning tue water into great ex-
pause of foam IL died.

He was arrested on Saturday and was fully identified by the girl as well as by dog that was with him, and by persons who had seen him hanging about Crisman's premises. He was taken to Franklin and jailed. The iailor had cause for the belief that he might be lynched, and for several nights kept the jail guarded. No attempt hav- ing been made at lynching, his suspi- cions were lulled and the guard dis. missed at eleven at night, promising to send two guards, however, in theil place. An hour afterward the tramp o1 15O horses was heard, and then came g knock upon his door. ""Who's there ? asked the jailor. GA friend"" was softly replied. ""What do you want?"" asked the iailor. ""We've come for Calvi1 Beatty, and we intend to have him. w don't want to frighten you or harm you we are aware of your position and re spect it. Just quietly give us the key and stay in your room""

 ""You can't get my keys. I will dit before I will give them up,' said thu iailor.

 ""Knock down the door,"" said a ma1 in an undertone, and it was done. Thre men rushed into the hall through tn breach, when the jailor's wife met them exclaiming, ""Oh, gentlemen, just con slder what terrible thing you are doin' before going any further"" Said they "" Madam, we took the whole matter int consideration before leaving our homes Our minds are made up now"" The then passed into the jail, knocked o1 the lock to Beatty's cell, told Beatty h was wanted, and pushed him along ou of the door and took him away. Tn next morning halter. with a moose was found, but it was not tied to tree Underneath were many tracks of horses but no signs of Beatty.

MEETING OF THE NATIONAL


ACADEMY OF SCIENCES.",,"INTERvIEw-AN OLD


ZEN sIoNER.


From Our Regular Correspondent
WASHINGTON, April 20.
The events of the week have been the
gathering of the ""National Academy of
Sciences"" at the Smithsonian Institution,
and the arrival Of Mr.. Edison, the famous
inventor with his Photograph, which he
exhibited yesterday at the Capitol to an
admiring throng of Senators and mem
bers. Mr. Edison received an invitation
by telegraph, to attend the meetings at
the Smithsonian, and brought with him
his marvellous instrument, which is, sure
enough, a wonderful invention. When
he took it up to the Capitol, some of the
more skeptic among our Solons shook
their heads doubtingly and predicted that
if such things, a. claimed for the phono-
graph We're possible, then the world would
certainly not stand long; but others, with
more faith in the possibilities of the nine
teenth century, elbowed the throng to
get near enough to the instrument and
get chance to test it. Mr.. Edison first
explained the principles upon which the
phonograph operates, and then went
through a number of practical tests, such
as whistling, singing, growing, talking
different sentences, &c, all of which the
phonograph repeated with wonderful
accuracy. The only two instances in
which it failed to repeat distinctively the
questions put to it, was when Senator
Howe said something into the mouthpece
to which the only answer came back was
''Bow wowW but then perhaps the Sena-
tor had only been barking. The other
failure was when, in reply to a whisper
by General Butler into the machine, the
single word ""Spoons"" rang out clear and
with metallic sound in the very uttcrance
that had something significant in it.


As possibly many of my readers now
hear of the phonograph for the first time,
/ will endeavor to describe this wonder
ful machine in a few words 1t is com
posed of cylinder, on which appear
spiral grooves, and which is connected
with crank by which it may be turned
and diaphragm over the cylinder, show

the steel point would merely have pressed
the tin foilinto the grooves of the cylin-

When the steel point was again passed

tempt of,the law which led in West Virginia
to the numbering of murderer by mob,
we are called on to chronicle the extra
ordinary doings Of party of dog-lynch-
ers upon Bergen Heights, in the ncighbor-
ing State of New Jersey. A ferocious dog
last Thursday bit and severely mangled a
child. The citizens became excited, and q
gang Of men, masked like the people down
South and out West who take prisoners
from jails and hang them to trees, made an
onslaught upon all the dogs of Bergen. We
do not admire the average town dog; we
loathe the white-coated Spitz therefore we
can be acquitted of any false sentiment in
the matter but a masked band, armed with
clubs and pistols, slaughtering dogs by tho
hundred some Of which, no doubt, were
valuable animals, looks little wild, within

terrible thing, but you must kill all the
dogs if you will abolish it. 1t will not be
enough to kill half or three-quarters, or
nine out of ten Of the dogs of Bergen, but
you must kill all the Bergen dogs, all the
Jersey dogs and the dogs of all the States
bordering on Jersey. This is too much of q
task for any masked gang. Thorough"" is
the most impossible of political or social
maxims The French Revoutionists took to
cutting aristocrats' heads off to abolish aris-
tocracy, but they did not cut enough to pre-
vent the fresh crop. Here we have one
child in alleged danger of hydrophobia,
and half the community runs mad with
cynophobia. What the sight OF water is to
dog in the rabies the glimpse of dog
was to the cynophobic Bergenites. They
foam and fire pistols at the wag Of n mon
grel's tail, and yet they will not kill all the
dogs. The police of Bergen took no notice
of the affair. Where is Mr.. Bergh? This
new disease may prove catching, and we
look to him to dognose it and prescribe and
apply the remedy."

THE AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP.


It appears to be difficult to decide which Of
the leading amateur clubs of the District Is
entitled to the championship. They have
played, iu great measure without prear-
rangcmcnt, and no record OF games has been
kept such rs all will concede to be accurate.
The Potomac Club having claimed tho cham.
pionship, the secretary Of the Athletic Club
Immediately replied through THE REruBLI-
CAN, giving figures to show that tho honors
belonged to his club. Mr. W. 7. Seville, secre-
tary Of the Potomac Club, sends communica-
tion to THE REPuBLtCAN rcasscrting their
claim TO the championship. lie says


We have played seventeen games during the sea-
son. Of which but two were lost and one was a tic
game. We have played with all the prominent
our reorganization, N which time both the Potomac
and Star clubs were disbandcl, or we could not
have taken the name Of Potomac As To the
charge that We have not played with the ROscdalC
Baseball Club, the secretary OF the Athletic club
Is not well Informed. On the 3Oth Of September We
played an exhibition game with the Roscdalc Club,
which was decided by the uinpiro-Mr. MudGau,
OF the Emmett base ljal Club-9 to In our favor.
A second game was arranged with the same club
for Tuesday October l. but the Roscdale failing to
appear, and we being on the ground ready for play,
we accordingly claim the game. Having defeated
all the clubs IN the District which have any stand.
Ing as amateurs. we claim tho championship and
in support Of our claim would respectfully refer to
our score.


Another claimant for the amateur pcnnaut
now comes into the field, and that Is the Co
lumbia College nine. As the question Is one
which II Is almost impossible TO decide on nc.

The cruelty of which a. Wisconsin wife
complains, in her suit for divorce, is that
her husband tied her securely and shaved
her head. The defence is that she bleached
her black hair to lemon color by the use of
acid, and that he, deeming such thing
highly scandalous, took the only means of
undong what she had done. He says that
he bought wig for her, initiating her nat
ural hair, so that her bare head might be

Two prisoners were lynched in Springfield,

crime was committed tried to prevent the
unlawful hanging. The trip seemed to be

happily rescued by human persons striving

told Williamson that the girl was too young

This warning did not induce him to wait,
but made him jealous and watchful of his

made deliberately, and after he had good
reason to believe that her mothers predic-
ton had been verified. After shooting her

l of the TIMES, which had been set in motion
especially for their amusement.


After expressing themselves in unmeas-
| ured terms at the wonders of the printing
Office, where they had seen the type ''set up""
| and afterward repro luced ON paper by steam
| machinery, they lett for further sightseeing
about the city. After being supplied with

which was on exhibition on Delaware
street. As they entered the room
| where the little instrument was placed, they
| seemed as IL each one felt like he was going
| into an ambush, so carefully did he tread the
| floor.


They were all, however, finally seated near
| the talking machine together with Messrs-
X. N Hershfield and daughter, Col u.
| Anthony, Jas. McGonigle, y. II Perry, Frank
| +. Lynch and number OF others. The first
i talk made on the phonograph by Mr.. Sargent,
the operator, was heard with Indifference by
| the Indians, IL was in English. To furth-
| Ell satisfy them of the magnitude Of the In.
| vention and its powers, IL was suggested that
Chief Joseph talk into the machine In the
Indian Language. This he did, saying, I'VE
| are here looking at the white people, who
| are our friends; we like the city and its peo-
| pie we will return tonight""


| This was reproduced with such effect that
| every Indian heard il and expressed unboun-
| ded asionishment. The next one VINO talk-
ed into the machine was Sep-pOon-mas.
He in broken English said, ""Now see you
my friend, ] See you all now very good.
like you all right"" This was rePe ated clear
ly TO the satisfaction of ALL


Yellow Bear was the next who talked. His
words were to the effect that he with the re-
mainder OF the party had come TO see his
friends was glad to see them and enjoyed
their company much. This was also in the
Indian tongue and reproduced, SO
that il was clearly understood by the speak.
er and the interpreter, The last speaker was
Cookbook -steh-nickt. He said that he, with
the other chiefs, were here to See their friends,
and would return in the evening. Mr.. Sar.
gent Ihen spoke into the tube crying, Hello
hello. fire fire - etc. Alter this was repeated,
Colonel Anthony was asked 10 talk into IL.
The machine was turned back, and when |
about ready TO speak Mr.. Sargent turned the
crank, and before a word cOuld be uttered, |
the phonograph yelled out Hello! hello!
firei fire ~ Then. IN All instant, Colonel An |
Ihony said TO ii ""Iou a fraudI We will |
call a meeting of the citizens, and appoint a |
committee, and have yon run out of the |
city"" This was also repeated with distint- |


Mr.. Hershheld's little daughter NJ xt spoke |
81 have read much of the phonograph, but |
have not had ""A chance To see IL work"" This
was reproduced well.
Joseph, on being asked to sing, refused and |
said: Il have seen enough TO satisfy me that 4
this is a wonderful thing""
After leaving the phonograph, the party |
visited several OF the prominent business
houses and made some purchases, bought
some shawls at Weaver x Small's, enjoyed /
ice cream at Beiga's 5, and finally. ..leturned to /
TIE TIMES office about six O'Clock, where /
again they Were hospitality entertained. The |
telephone was again brought into requisition /
and Charley"" made himself heard at Col. |
AnthonSs house. During this time
a quiet conversation IN the Indian tongue /
had been in progress between the remaining |
chiefs and Mr.. Chapman.


A SURPRISE.


When Charley had finished his talk he, at a |
signal, turned around. and Chief Joseph and l
the others arose to their feet. Mr.. y. B. Perry,
OF The TIMES, who WAS innOceDtly looking on |
TO see what would follow, wss aiso asked by |
the Interpreter to arise. He obeyed, and !
follows, Qnierpreted by Mr.. Chapman: ave |
are friends. You have been our friend. In /
talking 10 your people with the paper you |
have spoken straight. give you


THIS PIPE
as a slight token of the regard OF myself and |
my chiefs here. 1 hope you will always be |
oar friend, and hope ALI white men viii be |
our friends The pipe Is an emblem of peace, |
and one of the most valuable OF our giiis."" 1


THE PIPE |
which is an elegant one was handel to the |
recipient by the Chief, all Others Of the party 1
bowing assent. Mr. Perry replied in few
words, stating that his relations with the |
prisoners had been of a purely business ma
lure; that he had always endeavored 10 |
write the truth about them and that the bus
iDess of a newspaper demanded that at an
times on v facts should be written. II his |
reports had been favorable they were only |
50 nom the facts gathered. III they were
otherwise II was from the same cause. On be |
half of the TINES, and himself he expressed |
his friendship and welcome. After shaking |
hands, with the party they were again seated 1
ana he pipe was nghted and passed around |
the circ a tok. n that the friendship thus /
made should not be broken.


AT COL ANTHoNY's RESIDENCE.


After the ceremony of the presentation OF |
the pipe was concluded Chief Jo>eph's party /
visited the residence of Col. ID. X. Anthony,
on the North Esplanade, where they spent n /
pleasant half hour, listening to the piano /
and a song rom Mrs. Anthony, seeing the /
house position of the telephone, and smok- /
ing. While the visitors were at this place /
Chief Joseph said he had ""A few words TO /
speak. The entire party, including several /
ladies' arose TO their feet, and Joseph spoke /
follows:

over our trip to the city. This is true / speak /
TO you He who takes care of our spirits Will Il

COLONEL ASrHoNY's REPLY.


The above having been interpreted, Colonel
Anthony replied


al reciprccsie the sentiment You have ex-
pressed. All our people wish your people
we'll The great majority of the American
people wish you TO be well and happy. Per
sonally, We all like Chief Joseph. He is a
good and an able man. His influence is for
a little while 10 live, and IL is best TO try TO
be happy while We live. None of Of us will
live 10 be more than a hundred years old,
hence, let US now try TO do all the good We

President Litchenstein then addressed the
Council. He said that for q good city gov-l
ernment 1t was not necessary for men to be
of high order of culture. They should be
good business men, should be punctual and
honest and ready to speak and vote their,
convictions. Those men who hold up. for.
the best measures can be called the best
party men, because they reflect credit on
the party which elected them. He said he
desired to refer specially to the careless
manner some committees had of dealing""
with petitions and communications, some
time never reporting upon them at all.
The right of petition is sacred to the
American people, and to keep the petition
in your pocket is discredit to the body,
and to the petitioner. I would also ask
that close attention be paid to the assess
me Mt books, because 1t can be readily seen
that mistake might occur of $100, 900 and
the board rot know it. The speaker ad. 4
vocated the repeal by the Legislature Of.
the act of taxing land, and also recoms
mendsd that change be made In the pres-q
ent manner of taxes for city and countysl
purposes, so that personal property, might
bare a share as well as real estate, HHeo

if some of its prominent citizens who have
banded themselves together as regulators
are to be accepted as specimens Of the in
habitants at large. These regulators, un-
der the pretence Of giving the public better
protection than is afforded by the laws,
have been committing NJ urders and indulg-
ing in all sorts OF illegal and violent acts,
until the whole country is in terror Two
men who were notified by the band to leave
the county under penalty Of death and
neglected the warning have been shot dead


One man who had incurred the condemna-
ton of the regulators was murdered in his
bed by the side Of his wife. Ten other citizens
have received orders to leave, and one Of
them, fearing assassination, has taken his
departure. There is, however, dispos-
ton to make n stand against the ruffianism
Of the band, and the Grand Jury have in
dicted seven OF the number for kidna piping,
some of the accused being men Of wealth.
1t is to be hoped that the law will be found
strong enough to regulate the regulators.
Al rare intervals, in new and wild COM
munity, where 1T Is impossible to enforce the
laws and criminals get the upper hand Of
society, vigilance committee may seem
almost justifable. But it is always peril
Gus experiment for men to go outside the
law and set themselves up as judges, juries
and executioners over their fellows.


The enforcers Of lynch law easily slide
into the commission Of the worst OF crimes,
and the severe punishment of few lynch
ers would be wholesome in this country.
Darke county Ohio, would be an excellent
place to commence such an example. The
murders committed by the regulators of
that county seem to be marked by extreme
brutality, and it would be well to prove
that when the law gets its grip upon the
murderers it will be as relentless toward
them as they have been toward their victims."

Va, published elsewhere this morning, re-
counts the hideous details of tragedy en-
lawless mob. A prisoner named John Wal
lace, accused of murder, was confined in q
room of temporary prison awaiting removal
to the Jail. The guards stationed for his
safe keeping and protection from violence
were attacked at night by an armed mob,
the prison doors forced and the prisoner
seized and bound in the most summary
manner. Realizing at glance what his
fate was to be Wallace made the most
piteous appeals for mercy, but the brutal
crowd laughed ut his cries and dragged
him headforemost down the stairway and
out Of the house. Here one would
suppose the innate barbarity of the howl
ing fiends who danced around their victim
in the darkness would have been satisfied
by the mans death on the nearest tree.
But no, they actually dragged the poor
shrieking wretch along the Baltimore and
Ohio Railroad track on his back and as fast
as strong men could run. For quarter
Of mile this horrible scene was made,
if possible, still more dreadful by the
agonized screams of the dying Wallace,
whose bruised and bleeding body was torn
over stones and railroad ties as if it was
sack of chaf. 1t is to be hoped that the
man died soon after he ceased to cry and
moan. Anyhow, when his brutal execu-
TONERS hanged him on On apple tree q
mile from his late prison they found his
spine and neck broken. The barbarity
of this outrage demands that quick
and unhesitating vindication be made of
the majesty of the law, and that all the
perpetrators be brought to justice The
number engaged point to the probability
that the avengers of Wallace's crime were
actuated by the same motives that led him
to commit it, and that this numbering of the
murderer was the second bloody scene of o
family quarrel. If the authorities fail to
prove to these Littleton savages that State
law and not Lynch law is supreme in West
Virginia they will bring lasting dishonor
on their State"

the parties he had been talking said tnat
before they would see the institution go
down that they would be willing to con-
ribute towards it, He thought the Coun-
Gil had better not let it go down but try
1t little while longer, and if there Is any
| thing wrong going on there, try and cure
the disease.
Mr. Taylor, said he was also very
much surprised at the resolution Delng
offered, and be would move that the mat
| ter be laid on the table for one week.
Mr.. Norton, wished to know what
great benefit has the Hospital been to
| the citizens of Wilmington. The advo-
Gates of the institution say that we ought
to have such place for strangers In case
they come here sick or get hurt here. He
thought they had better look after our
people first, as charity begins at home.
The place had been so far Kept up for


persons who could go there and pay S3


or 81 per week board, and he wouid IKE


to know what poor laboring man IN this


city could do that. He contended that


the building had not done as much good


as it had cost to keep it up. The building
is not adapted for hospital The rooms


for the patients are so far away from


those of the superintendent that a paueht


might might die and the official know
nothing of it, until he visited the room IN


the morning and found the man dead.


He was in favor of having hospital for


our poor, and send them there whether


they could pay SO per week or not. II


we want to benefit our poor we had bet


ter take part of the money that 1t now


takes to run the institution and establish


a dispensary, where the poor coulu go


and get medicine free. He had been in


formed by large number Of physicians


that they would give one hour free every
day if such an institution was establish


ed. He had been informed on good au-


thority that it cost S25 per week for each


patient that was sent there.


Mr.. McGlnchey said that two years


ago he had conversation with the nurse


at the hospital, and from that conversa-


tion, he came to the conclusion that the
way the institution was conducted was


nuisance to the city. If it was conduc-


ted the same way now he was in favor OF
abolishing 1t.


Mr.. Guthrie, said he could not under
stand why the gentlemen were surprised
at such resolution being offered, as he
had informed them that he was going TO


introduce it. The had always thought the


institution was nuisance land thought SO
still He promises of the citizens to con

one cent had been so contributed. In
order to show what the institution had

ST. LOUIS, Jan. 1S.--The Hon James
j. Mcbride returned last night from Hills
boro, Mo-, having succeeded, a. counsel
for Miss Rose Bell Rebecca Boltlnghouse
who Is accused Of murder in the first
degree, In procuring q continuance of the
case until the second Moncay In May.
In the summer OF 1874 one Howardwas
arrested In 81. Louis on charge Of steal
ing horses In Jefferson county. It was
supposed that he belonged TO gang of
horse thieves. He was transferred to the
authorities of Jefferson county, who came
up to st. Louis TO get him, As he was
about TO depart, Howard said at the
-Four Courts: ""If they get me down there
In their hands they will swing me up to
the first tree they can find."" On his ar
rival at franklin be was taken by mob
from the jail, and after being carried to q
beautiful grove q short distance from
town, was tried bya band of masked
men, who pronounced him guilty, and
hanged him from a tree. -,a.f,4.l, N,


The newspaper reporters who went down
to franklin from st. Louis heard that
Howard was guilty also Of murders a child
having Ymysteriously disappeared who
bad been living with him and his para.
mour, Mrs. Eads, beauty who had
wrecked the life of her husband, a we'll
known captain ON the river. About a
lyear afterward II was announced that
Mrs, Eads, who bad In the interval be-
come Mrs. Boltinghouse, had been ar
trested in Platt county on informati on
furnished by Mary Taylsr, the sister o.


the little boy, Lewis Merrill Taylor, who
Is supposed TO have been murdered.


The story told by Mary Taylor is I
strange one. She said that In April 1877


when she was fourteen, her little brother
offended Mrs. Eads by some piece Of dis


obedience, and she took him to,a smok,


shed near the house. Selling an ak,


handle, she best him over the head ant


body until the last spark of life had beer


extiDguished. The body was given intt


Howard's hands and he buried 1t In th'


woods near by. Miss Taylor says sh,
continued TO live with MRS. Boltinghous,
|. for three years afterwards, moving witt


her 10 st. Joseph and st. Louis, am


Then to Camden Point, Platte county
where Mrs. Boltinghouse's father, JohI
Eldridge, cultivated farm. After liv


ing with her for seine time In Platt


county, Miss Taylor removed to the resi-


dence Of a neighboring farmer, name'
Kirtley, to whom she first communicat
5 ed the story above given. i..a ui
Mrs. Boltinghouse's account of the bo


is that she gave him into Howard's han


10 be taken 20 her father's,i in Platte coun
Il lty. 1t Is certain that the boy never ar
! rived there, but her allegation Is tina
a Howard probably took him TO st. Loui
and designedly abandoned nim to what
' ever fate he might happen OH. The sci

that he opened out on the subject be really

when he talked about his hopes and plans l
was dszzled, and could not help believing in
them and giving him the fullest sympathy.
Bot later, when he began to say words to me
about the new strength my sympathy gave,
and what might be to him and the cause if
could love him. l was startled and distressed.

back. calling myself half-hearted, and incaps-

he left. We speut the last day here. You

that village, and it appears from circum-
stances that they cohabited. A short
time ago the woman gave birth TO still
born child. The agent buried the child
and the matter was kept quiet until last
week, when the agent made a boast of
the matter. In the meantime the lady
died and was buried. The deceased has
several sons residing in Philadelphia, who
learning of the revelations made by the
agent, went to Millington, to revenge
their mothers 1wrongs, and it was almost
impossible to restrain them, and the
friends of the deaceased, from lynching
the debased wretch, but finally their bet
ter judgment asserted itself, and he was
allowed to depart. The mans name is
Webb, but in difference TO the family the
lady's name is withheld."

WASHINGTON, D. c., Nov. 32.-
Minister Welch, in handing Lord
Salisbury the five and half mill
lions fishery award, handed also q
communication, in which, under
instructions from Washington, he
stated that the payment was made
because the United States desires
to maintain the value and good
faith of arbitration and treaties be,
tween nations aud, above all,
with Great Britain. With
this motive our Government
reserves the question of
obligation to pay the amount, al
though 1t does not withhold it. The
United States Government also
wishes it understood that the
amount awarded by the Halifax
Commission cannot be understood
as furnishing a precedent or fixing
the value of benefits accruing to
her fishermen on the banks of New
Foundland. Itprotests against the
actual payment being considered
by Her Majesty's government as
acquiescence in any such measure,

Again five years have come and


gone. and the dear old convent walls


cannot longer shelter Lima from the
storms aud Ills Of life, but she mus,
go forth now upon its broad theatre,
| and grapple, as it were, with its stern


and actual realities. Lima felt that
| her strength was insufficient to fight


against the conflicting waves, which,


at times, rise SO far above the tide OF
human affairs. Hers was naturally a


heroic disposition, but think that


braver hearts than hers sometimes 8
shrink from duty which they are


we'll aware they ought to perform.


while, at the same time. they feel a


perfect Inability to do so.


Lima knew that to distinguish her.
self with the success for which she
was working, that she must further


her course with her old, invincible
determination aud resolution. AL.


though at times she thought the re.
sponsibiities that she had tax ell upon


herself weighty and inadequate, she


would labor faithfully to the end, to


consummate the one wish of her life


Then, if she failed, God help her. LII,


na would not allow herself TO contem.


plate the possibility Of q failure; she
possessed large amount OF courage
| and this she considered indispeusi bic


TO the attainment Of her desire; there.


fore she called into action every drop

kind sisters and schoolmates dear

beatific scenes which warmed and


frightened that home circle, endear.


ed TO her by long and happy associa'


tions.


Once again Lima was adrift upon


the worlds broad ocean, and ere she
had proceeded far upon her voyage,
Its cold, dark waters chilled her very


heart. But for one brief period Lima


would be happy, for she was going tn
spend two j""yous months at home


with tie loved ones, and this thought
filled her soul with unspeakable de.
llght. Homeward-bUw much rap.


,ure is there in just that one, ample


word, particularly TO those who have


been, for long while, deprived of the


bllsses which cling SO tenaciously

While Lima is being whirled ovel

into Mrs. Mayuard's CHEEKY and

aud she are doing, though l must first
tell you that Mr.. Maynard had left
the country several months ago, and
was at present living in Lynchburg.
Through the ins:rumentality of sew

large business house of that character.
which brought him q salary sufficient
to supply more abundsntly the wants
of his family. They were able, now,
TO send Agnes to good school ; and =,
beside. he rented pleasant residence
on West street, one noted for the
beauty and health of its locality.


Mrs. Maynard purposely withheld
the information from Liua, wishing
to give her all agi eeable surprise
when she came home, and now they
were waiting in joyous expectancy
for her coming. Every room in the
house had been neatly prepared for
her reception, particularly the one
especially prepared tor her, aud every
day, for the past week, Agnes had
added one thing more, here aud there,
to its comfort; flow ers gathered from
her own little garden decorated the
low msnteI, filling the room with q
rich and perfect odor. The pantry
was well filled with the choice dain-
ties that Lima loved. and they were
only waiting now for the morrow,
that would bring the loved aud alb.
sent one.


The shrill whistle Of train coming
IN at five O'Clock did not startle Agnes
as it would the next day ; for what
did it Inatter how many trains came
and went if Lima was not coming that
evening?


Agnes pulled out her slender purse
and examined it, saying. Yes; here
is enough to buy her half dozen nice
oranges, and she shall have them""
And ina few moments Agnes was 60
ing down the street to make her pur-
chase. She saw a carriage little in
advance of her. and a hasty glance as
sured her that there was some one in
it who had on handsome travelling

tho FIRST guard and demanded admission; he
refused and they drew hcir pistols and fired several
shots In The air and tho man ran or Entering the

membe Of the Board.


Mr.. Windle replied that In the opin
len Of the City Solicitor 1t did not.
n Mr.. Hazlet opposed the ordInanc Of
the ground OF general economy. II
claimed that the members Of the Boar
performed only about six weeks work


and therefore the present selary was su


ticient compensation.

: creased At aAy time, but did not think th
n increase could be given to the preseI
T. iincumben


II Mr.. Windle said in the opinion of th


City Solicitor it could be; he also sai
I. that the members Of the Board perform


ed at least five months of hard labor; tbs


they did more work than the Water Con


missi sners, and il their compensation wa


not increased the members would ste
% down and out.


d Mr.. Norton thought the provisions
~ the city charter would prevent thel


from having the benefit of tho increase.
Mr.. Lynch was OF the same mind, b.
'' thought Council was obliged 10 accel

70 low.

,g Mr.. Paynter said a member Of Il
II ~ Board had stated to him that the salai
n should be at least S400 or $500. He thougl
ii. tho present pay was too small, but W
OF Of the opinion that the charter prohit


ted the increase.


Mr.. Baker said this question did n
affect the ordinance. it only affected II
ae right of the members of the Board to 7
a.3 ceive the increased compensation.
y"" his opinion they were prohisited bystl


city charter from reoeiving 1t, neverth

WIS intemperate in his habits. and had become

fire below Crook City, D. T., has swept in an
| eastcrly direction, burning up hay which had
] been cut and stacked for the military posts
| at Bear Butte. The military quarters narrow.

Cardinal by the Primate, the Archbishop
Of Cashel, the two senior Suffragan
Bishops. Walsh. and Lynch. and the
celebrant Bishop Moran. Then the plain
tive 'Requiescat in Pace"" was chanted by
the tenor and counter tenor, and was deeply
solemn. This closed the function, the
church was gradually cleared and the doors
were closed.


TIE FUNERAL.


It was intended that the interment should
take place at ten O'Clock tonight In strict
privacy at the Church of the Holy
Cross, attached to the beautiful and
picturesque Archiepiscopal Seminary.
Clonlihs, which was erected out
of the Cardinals own savings and
dedicated two years ago by the late Cardi-
nal Franchi, during his visit to Ireland.
The Catholic people. however. were too
much afflicted to allow Of this, and the
whole neighborhood of the Cathedral was
crowded. The final ceremonies were very
solemn and imposing.


EN- ROUTE TO THE CEMETERY


The coffin was simply placed on On open
hearse drawn by four plainly caparisoned
horses, and o long line Of carriages
followed. The people walked along
side in such numbers through the
streets Of Dublin that 1t was found
necessary to proceed very slowly, and an
immense crowd had assembled outside the
gate Of the Seminary. It was in
tended only to admit few priv
ileged persons, but several hundred
people found their way in. The Primate
and the other bishops and many priests
were In attendance. The anthem ""Subve-
mite sancti Dei,"" given in the Gregorian
chant, announced the arrival of the coffin.
It was laid on the bier before the altar and
the absolution pronounced by Bishop Mo-
ran. The coffin was then borne out by the
bishops, because the entrance to the vault
is outside the church.


IN THE cHuRoH or THE HOLY cnoss.


The vault is of plain brick, without orna-
ment. and the Cardinal himself had II
made The cofin was laid at the entrance
and the ""Benedictus"" was chanted,
alternate verses being sung in har-
mony. The scene was most pic
turesque, the clergy standing in, rows
and on an inclined slope the crowds of
mourning people looking on as the plaintive
music asoended in the night air. The night
was clear, the stars were shining and
hundreds Of candles and torches were
Pickering among the thousands of specta-
tors


THE LAST SCENE


Tho holy water was sprinkled on the
coffin, which was then placed in the vault.
The last prayer was said by Bishop Moran.
struggling with his emotions; the ""Requies-
cat in pace"" was once more chanted and all
that was mortal Of Paul Cullen, the first
Irish Cardinal, was left to await the last
trumpet.
