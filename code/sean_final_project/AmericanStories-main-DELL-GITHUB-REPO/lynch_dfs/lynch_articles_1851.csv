Messrs. Anderson and Wadsworth start
ed this morning for San Jose, as special delega-
ton from the sitizens Ofthis place to urge upon
the Legislature the importance of immediate
action with reference TO the proposed division
OF this County. The propriety and actual ne
cessity for such n division is so apparent to
every one who is at all acquainted with the po-
sition of things in this county, that it is u
m tier of surprise that there should Ibe the
least delay in this simple act of justice. We
invite the attention of our readers to the fol-
lowing communication upon this subject

our representative, Mr.. Field, the 7tlr of Feb.

scribing the bounds of Nevada county. This
was all right, so far, bat there the matter
rested On passing the House it appears
it was sent to the Senate, and there it has
been allowed to remain in statu quo for two
months or more, awaiting the action of that
honorable body. In the mean time, the Leg

Where this matter will end no one knows,
but, we hope that the rights of the citizens
within the bounds of the proposed county of
Nevada, will not much longer be sacrificed,
to the low ambition of intriguing politicians.
We hope that their time will not longer bo
wasted in useless and expensive journeys to,
|Marysville, the County Seat of Yuba Coun-

Where law secures not life''


Reeitals of murders and outrages, promptly suc-
ceeded by the wild justice"" Of Lynch law, ms
Lord Bacon terms revenge, following each other
in swift succession, crowd the columns of these
papers and in one only, the Inder, is voice OF
expostuation raised against the summary pro-
ceedings of the mob, who supply the place and
exercise the functions Of judges and ministers
Of Justice.


That manly and fearless expostulation against
the rule Of such Reign of Terror as the sway
of mob law must introduce, we will give to-
morrow. Our space to-day we reserve for a
brief recital Of some few of those popular de-
monstrations, and of the crimes which provoked
them


The stern necessity on unsettled frontiers of
an occasional resort to such examples, to awe
the lawless rufians who fly like wolves before
the advancing footsteps Of law and order, no one
can deny, however much he may deplore the
substitution of such irregular and lawless modes
of procedure for the regular administration of
that ""I.aw whose seal is in the bosom Of God""
and whose forms afford protection for the in
nocent against the sudden gusts of passion

But from the numerous accounts given of

as well as from the following cool commentary
which we take from the Sacramento Transcript,
it would seem that it was to be enthroned as
the "",higher law"" of the free State of California
ANOTHER LYNCHING AFFAIR-The people of
California-at least that portion of it who re-
gard all evil doers with an abhorrent spirit

to repress crime and punish the guilty.


We have accounts within the past week from
all quarters of the State, where the people have
risen in their majesty, and stamped the vile in
fringement on good order and personal safety,
with their broad seal of condemnation. That
q better and more healthful state of society will





When the passion and the excitement of the
hour passes away, the more sensible and reflect
ing portion of the people of California will per-
ceive the necessity of promptly putting stop
to these excesses, which undermine the very
foundations of law and order, and lead to the
commission of the very evils they are originally
intended TO prevent the recurrence of.


We doubt not that the ""sober SECOND
thought"" of all such will assert its supremac,
finally over ebullitions of misdirected anger, a

There is no evil in new societies comparabl
to that of placing power in Irresponsible hand
and dignifying moblaw with the holy title {

scenes that occurred at Sacramento, San Fra,

other items Of interesting intelligence:


Tremendous Excitement at Sacramenio--A Nq


Shot and the Murderer Hanged


On Tuesday, about 2 P. NJ. a young man,
MINER was in the Mansion House, well knowr
gaming hell, corner of J. and Front streets lie
wa. looking on at a monte table, when the deal





erick j. Roe, a gambler, told him to 90 to h--ll
Some words ensued, and Roe struck the mine
in the face.


A fight was the result, in which Roe was
worsted then he was joined by several of his
fellow-gamblers, and they al together fell upon
the miner. Mr. Charles ii. Myers, blacksmith
passing by ut the moment, interfered on behalf
of the miner, and cried, ""Fair play, don't four OF
you get on one mani"" He struck no one, how
ever, but succeeded in drawing off Roe, who
thereupon drew his pistol, Colts revolver, and
turned upon Mr. Myers, with ""What the h--ll
have you to DO with t?"" Myers was running
away, when Roe fired and shot him through the
back part of the head Myers fingered, about
four hours, and died at o'clock. 1t appeared
from the statement Of Roes witnesses that he
had been on ""bust' the night previous, land
had been drinking just before the affray.


Roe was Immediately arrested and placed in
the lookup. An immense crowd speedily con-
gregated, filed with indignation, and determined
to nflict immediate punishment The meeting
having been organized and chairman appoint
ed, twenty-five persons were deputed TO aid in
guarding the prisoner, and after several inefiec-
ua attempts by various citizens, TO dissuade the
people from their evident purpose, committee
was appointed to investigate the facts. Myers
was sober, industrious citizen from Columbia,
Ohio, where he leaves a family.

John Clea Sheriff. Col. Kewen appeared as
counsel for the prisoner. Several witnesses
were examined for and against Roe; those for
him being mainly gamblers.

fsr the prisoners, breaking down benches desks'
railing and everything which impeded their pro-
gress. driving the police officers before them.
Fortunately for the culprt, the Washington
Guards, who had been parading in honor OF the
day, happened to be near at hand, and on being
called on by the authorities, drove back the
crowd, and cleared the courtroom at the point
of the bayonet. While the Guard were driving
back the crowd, the prisoners were taken out
the back way, and let down through trap door
into the station house below.


The next day, some apprehensons having
been expressed as to the safety OF the prison
ers, an immense crowd numbering perhaps
five thousand persons, assembled in and around
the courthouse, rendng the air with their shouts
and clamor The meeting was addressed by
Mayor Geary, Recorder Tilford, Judge Parsons,
and others. generally in favor of law and order,
but we're listened to with but little attention by
the gathering.


TIE mayor finally proposed that a committee
of twelve be appointed to keep guard over the
prisoners, to see them kept in close confine-
ment. and to attend the further examination to-
morrow. and look to the full admins traton of
Justice. This proposition met with partial fla
vor, and two or three of the committee had
been appointed, when counter movement was
started on another part of the balcony, and the
proposition made that committee OF twelve be
appointed to report to the meeting then assem-
bled what should be done in the premises. This
movement was clamorously adopted, and the
following gentlemen appointed such committee

and recommended that Judge, sheriff and jury
of twelve citizens be selected, who should at
once proceed to the trial of the accused, and that
they be dealt by as they should be found inno-
cent or guilty by such tribunal. This PROPOSE
ton was lust what was wanted by the crowd
and of course was adopted with the loudest
manifestations of satisfaction, and preparations
were at once made to carry the reco nmendation
into effect


J.R. Spence was nominated, elected and ac-
ceptcd to act as judge.


The court"" then assembled in the recorders
court room, and was called to order by the sheriff
H. Ray Bowie and Chas G. Ross, were subse-
quently chosen associate judges.


The following citizens were then selected, and
sworn as Jurors, to try the issue: K. 5. Watson,
James Riddle, d. Page, J. c. Schenck, S. T.
Thompson, George A. Hudson, w. E. Stouten-
berph. George Endicott, Il. J. Smiley, James Ii.
Robinson, j. G.. Pelton, d. X Minor


After the organization of the court, Mr. Nc
Allister stated that he was counsel for Wildred
and that the evidence against him was entirely
different from that against Stewart, and there
fore asked that they might be tried separately
The court decided to try Stewart first. f. n.
Emmet was assigned as counsel for the State
against the accused. Justice Shepherd here ap-
peared and entered his protest against the case
being taken out of his hands, and moved the
postponement of further investigation until
two o'clock, stating that this duty had been i'm
posed upon him by the people themselves.


Mr.. Coleman moved that all counsel be dis
pensed with in the case and that it be tried on
its merits before the jury. Judge Shattuck
stated that he understood that counsel was to
be assigned to the prisoner, and that he had un-
| dertaken it, MIR. Coleman contended that there
should be no counsel--no lawyer with long


speeches and law from the time of Moses, and


that it should not be allowed. loud cheering
| Judge Shattuck protested against such a trial,


or farce, but finally concluded to go on.
| d. X. Minor, one of the jury, contended that
| the case should 90 on and nominated Mr.. Cole


man as counsel for the people.


The appearance Of the prisoners was here de-
manded by the people. Mr.. Coleman opposed
it-they were safe in custody and could not es-
cape. He then addressed the jury, stating that
he would arraign Stewart, charged first with
murder, and afterwards with burglary and rob-
berry, The trial was then proceeded with, evi-
dence was taken, and the jury retired.


After an absence of an hour or more, the jury
came into court, and said they could not agree
nine being for conviction, and three for acquit-
tai. The Jury were then discharged, and the
court dissolved, amidst the angry growing of
the multitude, speeches still continuing to be
made at various points in the crowd. In the end,
the officers of the district court succeeded in
getting possession of the prisoners, and the ex-
citement subsidized in the prospect of a regular
trial.


ANOTHER LYNcHISG ArFArR.--Monday, the
cath, two men, of very suspicious appearance,
entered the store of Messrs Kettelle, Mahoney
e. Co, and one of them asked for Mr.. J. c.
Bell, who was in the back part, for light He
gave him a light, and ordered him to go on The
outside to smoke. The man at first pretended
to be drunk, but after while knocked up against
Mr. Bell, who struck him off. The other party
in the mean time was fumbling with the pota-
toes. Finding they could make nothing there,
they crossed over to Middleton & Hoods. Mr.
Bells suspicious were strongly aroused, and he
watched the men closely. He went across the
street, and told the men who stood in front of
the store, to watch the two men. Presently
they came out, and Mr.. Bell seized the man
and took him inside. On searching, they found
in his pockets silk vest, pocket book of jew
elry, and number of other articles, that were
recognized as Mr.. Middleton's property.


There was quite crowd in the room at the
time, and instantly they rushed upon him, cry
out to hang him. A rope was procured, and
he was in fair way TO swing, when the crowd
were induced to commute his punishment. One
man had already pounded the fellows features
into fat but now on the outside seven sturdy
honest truckmen, laii upon him with their heavy
cart whips, and lashed him into foam. The
blood spouted at every flash over the face, and
the culpri, yelled murder"" When the truck
men were pretty well tired out, they rung his
ears almost of, and proceeded to wash him off
by pitching him into the dock. Finally, however,
the police took him in charge. His companion
escaped after hard run, but will inevitably share
the fate Of the first, If the truckmen ever catch
him. They know him

less have suffered from such villains, yet the pro-
ceedinps of the so-caed ""Secret Committee re-
mind us of the terrible sway of the Star Chamber
of European memory, when no man felt safe from

The testimony given before the Coroner at San

certainty which was naturally coming 10 pass:

shall only ask you therefore TO look win me AT one
State more III detail and shall take Massachusetts,
because suppose all Will admit that MASSACHUSETTS
is considered one of the strongest Anglo-Saxon
States IN the Union.


Massachusetts, Strongly Anglo-Saxon Will al
NIT, but what her Irish blood has done and now
strong II is now. Among her earliest records are
Irish names. An Irish Charitable Society existed III
Boston 40 years before the Declaration OF lndepen-
dence to relieve their INDECENT cOunrymen there-
Fanouil Hall was planned by an lTSh archlleCt' NJ
the AnglOSaxOn massacre in State-s one oil the hrst
victims was an Irlshman. Stark and Sullivan, Ooth
at Bunker Hill were both sons of rlshmen ana MAJ.
McClary was among the slam. Gen. knox, WASH
ngton's companion and afterwards IN MS caolhel
was born III Boston of Irish parents. Inc SulnVans
are no unImportant mines IN MASSACHUSETTS. But
coming 10 later times and what are the facts feIhaps
the three strongest Anglo-SaxOn States are MasSd-
chusetts Connecticut and Virginia Enghshmen are
apt indeed 10 single out Massachusetts and It's Me-
uopolitan-modern Athens as the faircst specimen OF
American Anglo-SaxOnism Yet how few OF such
ignorant babbers know that almost one half OF the
entire people of Boston i6 per cent? are foreigners
not TO mention the descendants of lrlshmen, settled
there during the last 200 years. In the Boston D,
rectory for the present the names OF smith ana
Brown of course stand al the head the next highest
name is Murphy. and then follow among the more
numerous the Barrys Buffers, Dohertys, Fltzgerads,
Kellys McCariys, O'Brens all lrlsh. The CITY erk
is McC leary, which is not Anglo-Saxon, nave
looked INTO the documents published by the Clty oil
Boston, concerning the census OF that my taken IN
May, 1850. The population OF Boston was men
l3s,7ss The number of children between and 10
wears of age ""a 215 and OF these l2lS2 were OF
foreign paftntape, one halfthe youth OF me Clty
The foreign population Ill the City Is 6J4so, very
large preponderance of whom are Irish. This class
has increased 26l77 since ls45. The English
Immigrants so few tha, the censors did not
think worth whl.e to mention them. The num-
bers are given Irish 52,g23 German 1906,
other Countries 7s77. So see that the city
OF Boston is about one-half foreign population,
that of 63it6 comprising that foreign population
50 1913 are lTSh, and Only l05i3 from ali other coun
tres The Anglo. Saxon Immigrants are so few, as
not to attract even the notice OF the cenSorS Ihey
not, perhaps one TO thirty from other countries
Taking the native InSh population, with those OF
lrSh descent, and presume that Boston, the cdplal
of New England, is, by large majority Celtic TO-
day and that Anglo XonlSml Is growing beautifully
less every hour. When such the facts concern
ing the capital of the strongest Angio-saxon state
IN the Union, does 1t not bespeak an advanced state
of perfection IN the manufacture OF brass TO claim
this country as Anglo-Saxon. In the town OF ROx-
bury, in population of 1870 there are fo0i lot
egners In the town OF Lawrence, III January lsic,
there were 3,9i9 inhabitants OF whom 2-loS were
foreigners. mostly Irish one of the most pleasing
facts connected with the census OF Boston Is thdl
the average attendance at the primary schoolS III
that CITY, ls49, s,te3 anC OF these, Q, l5O are
reported of foreign parents 1t is easy to foresee
what race With these numbers anu TINS euuc dtlon,
Is TO be the leading power IN the ne1t gehefd'ioh
BY city Document No. 4, 1880 We learn tnat more
than one half OF the parents of the chdreh' whose
births for that year registered there, are rish,
and that than threefths of the parents OF the
Boston children born IN that year are foreigners
There are 2,5i0 Irish fathers, 1879 lrish mothers,
3l4O foreign fathers, and 3l4 foreign mothers IN tue
whole number 5,03l OF the parents OF each sex re-
gistered During that year there were register
cd 2,ss' intentions of marriage, and OF these
majority were foreign males and females. In Mas
sachusettS there are but two towns, Boston Corner
and Monroe IN which there are no foreigners, ana
their united population is but 303 DR.. Chickering

Dreadful state OF Affairs.",,"The arrival Of the Prometheus brings Us fifteen
days later intelligence from California, by way Of
the newly.opened route Of the san Juan de Mica
ragua


The prominent, and by far the most conspicuous
feature of the California news is the prevalence Of
what would be called on this side Of the continent
the supreme authority Of Judge Lynch. In san
Fran .isco IL s the execution Of the decrees Of the
Vigilance Committee of Eve hundred, (not quite so
ceremonious as the old Venetian Council,) in the
prompt punishment Of Grim inals, and for the pre-
servation Of law and order. Strange as il may
sound in this longitude, these of-hand trials and
summary executions are, in good faith, designed
for the preservation rather the restoration, Of
law and order. The criminal may be a murderer,
n horse thief, burglar, an ircend diary, a common
shoplfter, or petty rogue, if the Vigilance Com
mittee catch him, and convict him, be Il instantly
carried out and hung up at the nearest convenient
tree, or beam, or rope and ta,kle. The crime, the
pursuit. the appreh ension, the Indictment the trial.
the judgment, and the execution, may all take
place in the same afternoon. The whole business,
in the case Of Jenkins, was done in the
course Of evening, by moonlight; and in
the case OF Stuart, another Botany convict,
tried also as a thief, the interval between
the commencement Of bis trial and the hanging
was about Eve hours. In the case Of the Mexican
woman a, ,Downieville-who, for fatally stab bng
miner, was tried by the popular process Ia such
cases established, and convicted Of murier-the
blood Of her victim was not yet cold, when the
woman, having been tried, convicted, and con-
demned, was swinging lfeless in the air The
Anglo saxon institution Of the rope, by sort Of
'cH'ra ge""cte, or c0rsiiinDi, may be con-
sldered as pretty vel established in California; but
the rapdity with which il brings the criminal TO
his quetus Is somewhat startling 70 a community
accustomed to the slower formali,ies of law.
This quickness Of the penalty s even more astound-
ing TO our precouceived notions than the rapyo ~
crimes which come under the death penalty bv The
new California code. We have no nice di.linc,ion,
between murder and manslsughter nor betvsos
highway robbery and a petty theft: the same
judgment Of strangulation makes short work Of
them all Truly, this is a terrible state Of things
and Is deeply to be deplored


But the people OF California, e appsars not ONLY
have reasonable excuses for these summary and
indiscrminato executions. bat their situation l.

"" hlle Moore was in Clarksville on

OF murder and robbery. 1t appears
that Moore was employed in an ex-
tensivc trading house in California,
and thinking he was not making mo-
ney fast enough, concluded that he
would adopt another plan, and so one
night he murdered his employer, and
robbed him of $4,000, and then ""cut

sumable that the old covey will have
hard time of it on his arrival at the

probably play the hero in the popular

il appeared, on investigation, that, while Capt.

smith shop of Mr.. Casper Ofienstein, for the pur-
pose of compelling journeyman in his employ
mept to join them. Mr.. OIcnstein. coming into
the shop, was struck violent blow in the face by
some person unknown, and Mr. Mulloy, police
officer, resisted in his efforts to preserve the
peace. This what led to the arrest of the par
ties in the procession. Eight of them gave bail to
answer for ""aiding and abetting in the riot,' al
though it did not appear that they were partici-
pants in any other way than by their presence,
which made them accessories. Three dis
missed, and one was committed to Jail to await

The Richmond Times of yesterday epitomizes
some OF the most important provisions Of the new
Constitution, as follows:


Nearly all State and county officers are to be elected by
the people, including the Governor and Lieutenant Governo
the Judges the Supreme District and Circuit Courts aud
the Justices Of the Peace Commonwealth Attorneys Clerks
and Sheriff..


The Legislature is to be spporioned the House Of Dele

cember and will meet the second Monday in January,
and thereafter the sessions will be biennial.


From this summary recapitulation it will be per-
ceived, says the Times. that the prominent modi-
6catons of the present Constitution consist in the
adoption Of the system Of popular elections in all
departments of the Government, in the abandon
ment Of the principle Of the representation Of pro-
persy, and in requiring the Legislature to provide
for the payment Of the present and every future
public debt."

Of another door, and ran to the residence Of
her master on the adjoining farm, and loudly
called for him. On reaching the house she fell
from exhaustion. and at the last accounts
was still alive, though bat little hopes wers en-
tertained Of her recovery. She states that she
did not see the persons who fired any Of the
guns.


a1here have been three persons arrested on
the charge of being concerned in the munder.
William w. Webster, an uncle Of Mrs cosden.
and also of Miss Rebecca c. Webster, her sis-
ter, who resides In Delaware, was arrested on
Friday, and underwent an examination before
magistrate In thai State, and proved an alibi
by several most respectable witnesses. He
was arrested ON thelestimony of brother Of
Mrs Cosden, about ten years Of age, who had
sad he heard his uncle make some threats
against Cosden and his family; besides which.
there had been q difficulty between him and
Mr. Cosden about some land. This was the
boy that escaped from the house at the time Of
the massacre, and fed to Georgetown Cross
Roads and gave the alarm. Mr.. Webster hay-
ing come over to Mr.. Cosden's place on Sun-
day, to attend the funeral Of The four victims,
was arrested on suspicion OF having some con-
nection with or Knowledge of the affair, and
committed for further examination.


aThe second one arrested il James Roberts,
travelling clock mender, who bore the exact
description ftlle assassin given by Miss Web
ster, even 10 The size, build and shape, aud also
to patches on the knees Of bis pantalo0ns, as
the one who had entered her feem. He was.
brought before her before she died, and she
three times declared that he was the gulty
party. He, however, succeeded in proving
that he was at Fredericktown, in Cecil county,
between tive and three miles of, at the time
the murder is supposed 10 have beeDcommitted
proving the abb by most respectable Wit
nesses. This man had been in Mr. Cosden's
house on the same day, or the day previous, TO
mend the clock, aud was invited to-remain 20
dinner. During the dinner hour Mr. Cosjen
had sent up stairs to borrow dollar from Miss
Webster. He was discharged on proving the
abb, but was immedistely arrested on the
charge of having entered the house of Mr..
Stevens, at Georgetown Cross Roads, mt I2
O'Clock on the previous night, so asto have him
at hand if further testimony should connect
him with the transaction He belongs to Dell
aware, in Appoquinimink Hundred.


THE third party arrested is Wm. Shelton,
who is mill hand, in the mill Of Mr. Yoshell,
in nearly the same neighborhood that Roberts.
came from. The suspicion aga nst him arises
from. the fact Of bis having recently bought
double-barrelled gun, a revolver or double
barfelled pistol, and some dirk knives, at Smvr-
ma. He had also been seen by boy in the
mil casting bullets from peculiar kind of
metal used in the mill, whom lie cautioned not
10 say any thing about it,sor the possession of
the gun and arms, all of which he kenf con-
cealed to Mr. Nosheli. His personal appears
ance corresponded with that described bv Mr..
Cosden as the man who had shot and stabbed
him. the bullets exactly fitted his gun. aud were
Of the same metal as that used in The mill, and
the door bore the mark Of having been broken
open by blow from The muzzle Of double
barrefed gun. lie was also absent from the
mill, from The Tresious Tuesday until after The
murder, when he was arrested AZ or near the
Ceclltoa Cross Roads. On these grounds he
was committed for further examination, and
all these are now in Kent county jail.


''Fhe excitement against Roberts was in.
tense, and if he had not succeeded in proving
an dlibi it Is probable that he would have been
lynched forthwith by the people.

Croach's house, but, thinking he heard the
robbers in the stable, turned his course towards
the Cross Roads


""Mr Crouch also immediately started an ex-
press of to arouse the neigiIbors, and on The
arrival Of two men from the Crossroads in
the vicinity of the house, Miss Webster stated
that she heard their horses hoofs, when the
assassins tcok fright and fled having just at
that moment shot her. Although She made
no statement of the kind, the physicians, con-
sisting of Drs. james .Highe, C. w. Graham
and John Z. Marsh, who examined her BODY
after death, as well as that of Miss Cosder,
state that an attempt had been made to commit
rape on both of them, either before or after
they were Shot

1t is subject of regret that the news from Cuba
was OF such character as TO require the imme-
diate return of the President of the United States
before he had visited all the places embraced in his
programme. The people of Lynchburg, espe-
cally, must have been much disappointed after
the arrangements made for his reception.


The slang whangers of the Democratic press are
harping upon the old song of "" Travelling Cabi-
net"" and giving themselves much uneasiness
about the absence of the President Let them rail
en- If they had not material in this they would
ind 1t In something else. Everybody understands
and appreciates the necessity party hacks labor
under of something to scold about. But the sober
minded, thinking people of the nation have long
since come to the conclusion that President FlLL-
MORE has just as much right to take little recre-
alton as any gentleman in the land.


Indeed, there is an absolute propriety in looking

Government is great machine that goes on al
most as well when the President is absent as al any
other time 1t is mere matter of convenience to
have him near the public archives Bot as the
slave question is the great and agitatng theme, it

scwnrd'- speech.",,"A criminal trial of extraordinary charac-
ter and unprecedented duration has been
for some months in progress at Detroit.
and has very naturally attracted a large
measure of public attention. The fact that
a considerable body of citizens, hitherto
respected and esteemed, many of them
thrifty farmers and fathers Of families,
some of them members of churches, were
arraigncd as guilty of arson, wantOn de-
struction OF property and the most reck-
less tri1ing with human life if not delb-
crate attempts to destroy it, very properly
excited profound and painful interest,
which the unequaled length of the trial has
not suiliced to disspate.


Gov. Seward, after repeated and ur-
gent applications, consented to appear as
counsel for part of the accused, and has
faithfully fulfilled the responsibility thus
assumed He had other duties pressing
upon him, and would gladly have been ex-
cuscd from attending this trial if he could
have felt justified IN so doing but he could
not And the moment 1t was announced
that he had undertaking the defense, the
slulccs of defamation were opened upon
him, as if he had himself been guilty of
some ahhorrcnt crime. The malignity with
which he was assailed by the J0urHal OF
Commerce. Buffalo Commercial, Detroit
Free Press, etc, was too intense and
unique to be covered by the mantle of Polit-
ical hostility 1t combined the meannesS of
spite with the ierocity Of dcadlleNt hate.
We trust no friend of the assailcd has even
stopped To notice the harkinc OF tins cnvious
pack. even though the first missile thrown
would have suilced to silence them. If IN
this free land men accused of atroclous
crimes are To be deprived OF legal defense,
by heaping odium on any eminent lawyer
who may be chosen 10 conduct II, We may
as well make way at once for Lynch law
OF the dospoti>m which now cruShes East
cn Europe


The merits Of this Conspiracy case We
leave to the jury. whose verdict NAV now
be hourly expected. But the fact that sew
eral of the accused were acquitted, by di-
rection of the Judge, even before the de-
itnsc was opened, shows that at least some
innocent men were included in the indict-
ment, and that a lawyer who undertook the
defense did not necessarily make himself
the accomphse or the shIeldof felons. And,
liz view of the great interest attached 10 this
ease. the important questions involved, and
the extraordinary assaults 10 which he es-
pecially has been subjected hy it, we dis
patched Reporter to Detroit expressly 10
report Gov. Stewards summing up for the
defense, Of which the first part is given =.
this paper. That it viii be read with
deep and lively interest, the subject and the
author alike give assurance. Few readers
can md time to pcruse the entire trial, but
thlS Speech, with the Verdict. VIII give
very good idea of It's more important fea-
lures. We hope To make room tor the resi-.

hear proposal for the establishment Of model

late of Trinidad, is the gentleman with whom
the proposition originated, and the plan which
he submitted to the meeting was that ElO,0OO

the purpose of carrying il onf. and for promot-

mayor of Galway in 1885, built the choir of ST. Nicholas
killing and defrauding strangers, without martial law
This is the origin of the term Lynch Law.


| frequently see similar statements to the
above, giving the origin of Lynch law which is
become famous and favorite code for the
sovereigns in many parts of our country, What
| ever may be the merits of the codesthey are
not due to James Lynch, mayor of Galway.
Lynch law originated in Virginia, but it was
different code, and enforced under different
circumstances from the modern Lynch law,
which means no laD. Immediately preceding
and during the revolutionary war, in the from
tier counties of Virginia, the state of society
was completely unsettled and turbulent. A
gang of horse thieves and connterfeiters, ex-
tending from New York to Georgia, made Camp
bell county, Virginia. the centre of their opera
tions. The jails and court houses were remote /;
| in fact, criminals had to be taken to Williams
burg for trial This was frequently attended
with great danger, and frequently the prisoner
was rescued by gang of ruthans, and witnesses
were in some instances shot, In this state Of
interregnum, when there was no law, or circum-
stances were such that it could not be enforced,
temporary. code WAS drawn up by Major John
| Lynch, of Campbell, q law-loying and law
obeying citizen, and agreed to and signed by
his neighbors They built them a log jail and
a sort of courthouse, and for some time, indeed
until the conclusion of the war, the, arrange
ment worked most admirably No man was
| ever punished without trial, and they never in
| ficted capital punishment, never going further
than confinement and the eop-skH At the
proper time they threw aside their code for the
laws of the county. ...


Major Lynch was noted for the excellence of
his character. The above statement knog is
substantially correct. | heard it from lawyer
of high standing in Virginia, who was person
ally acquainted with Major Lynch, and who
had in his possession a copy of the laws. 1t
will thus be seen that the modern advocates of
what they call Lynch law do not get any war
rant for their lawlessness and violence from the
excellent man who is so unfortunate as to give
a name to their proceedings. Should this ac-
count meet the eye Of papers published in the
part of Virginia in which Major Lynch lived, !
have no doubt they will be able to give fuller
and more interesting account of the man and
| his code .... .... A VIRGINIAN."

Orleans OH the 22d ult., dates from California to
the 18th Of March have been received. The
following summary of the news is from the San
Francisco True Standard of the 18th:


The weather still continues very dry, not a
single fall rain worth noting having occurred since
the last mail, and there is now very little hope
entertained that we shall have any rain OF con-
sequence this season. Additional efforts there
fore being made to render the earth dug up IN the
dry diggings available as possible. In addition
to the canals, and other modes adopted to bring
the water to the earth, the miners have now, in
some localities, adopted the plan of carrying the
earth to the water. They have constructed a
new washing machine on the same principle as
that called the ""long tom,"" of three times its d-
mensons, which they call the ""frmae TOM""
They then supply themselves with carts and
wagons, and horses and mules, and cant the dirt
distances varying from one TO three miles, to the
banks of the streams, where, by the aid Of this
sfemale tom,"" they enabled to make from
one to three ounces per day.


Further Information confirms the accounts of
the new diggngs, referred to IN our last summary,
and others are said to have been opened on the
Calaveras; cid localities heretofore indifferenlly
tried, have yielded, to perseverance and energy,
good returns. We continue to hear good accounts
from Scott's and Klamath rivers, aud the quartz
rock mines. Also from the diggings Oh the bay
of odos Santos, in Lower California. Rich Dig
gngs also found 10 exist in localities where it
was not supposed any gold could be found, even
the tops of some hills yielding abundanty The
dredging companies are commencing active opeI-
atons, and SO sanguine the proptietors Of the
STEAMBOATS, fitted up for this purpose, that the
of one propose, in order to enable the boat
to reach particular spot, to build dam SO as to
make slack water navigation.


On the whole the yield of gold in the mines, to
the steady perseveriDg miners, continues 10 be
good, and there does hot seem any prospect OF the
mines being exhausted for long period TO come.
Earth which has been twice washed even, a
third and careful washing, gives excellent results
to those engaged.


Agricultural prospects remain nearly the same
at the departure Of the last mail. The want
Of rain is great drawback aud threatens seriously
to interfere with the prospects of the crops for the
present year. 1t is however said that IL will not
affect them to the extent heretofore feared, and
that the yield will be good. Grain, it is said, will
rpen before the heat and drought of summer
would affect it, and the principal injury caused
by the want of rain will be- that the farmers will
have to be coptent with single crop instead of
having two. as it is very easy to raise two when
there is average quantity OF rain in the winter.


Political matters have received more attention
during the few days past. Both the Wings and
Democrats have held their primary elections in
this city, for the choice Of their General Com
mttees, and busy engaged in perfecting their
organization, and marshalling their forces for the
preliminary contest, to come Oft at the Municipal
election, in the ensuing month. 1t will, no doubt
be vigorously contested, but will, we satisfied
be decided upon other grounds than those of mere
party nominations. The Conduct of the present
Common Council has been such to produce.
conviction in the minds of the public that they
must have good men in office irrespective OF party,
and numbers will vote for the best men in nomi
rol,t.
call themselves.


The Legislature has been, since the reaction
consequent upon the excitement att. nding the at
tempt to elect an U. S. Senator, busily engaged in
forwarding various measures OF Importance TO the
interests of the State, but great progress has not
been made. A bill has been passed to prohibit
the drawing of lotteries within the State, and
imposing heavy penalties on all who shall be in
any wise concerned in getting one up, besides for
feiting the articles put up, and the money paid
for tickets, TO the OF the State. 1t is regarded
as a good aligury for the future, leading to tie
anticipation that the prohibition Of gaming will
follow in due course of time. at present the
Legislature has not got further than 10 provide for
licensing gaming, positively prohibiting some few
games,) bill for that purpose being now pending
before them. Many other bills OF great import
ance to the State and this city are also pending
before the Legislature. Among others, is one
relative to land titles in San Francisco, especially
as regards water lots. The House on Wednesday
passed bill IN relation TO those subjects, which
if it should be concurred in by the Senate, would
create great commotion in this city, as it would
unsettIe more titles than it would settle.


Indian affairs are still in the same unsa sfactory
condition as at the last dates, Detached parties
of Indians visit the camp of the Indian Com
missioners at intervals, but There has been no
general interview nor undersl anding; and in the
meantime there are continual reports Of incur
sons OF the Indians, depredatons upon cattle,
occasional murders, &c. Whether the commits
soners will succeed in making treaty is quite
doubtful. Many persons believe the lndi ms will
procrastnate until the snow mets oil the noun :
tains, that they will then retreat beyond the
Sierra Nevada without making any treaty, and
next wear will again return to make their incur
sons and commit their depredations on the miners
and rancheros. 1t is believed that they will never
make any treaty which they intend to keep until
they are convinced of the power of the whites by
etfectual chastisement. .a..- ,.


Lynch law, we regret to say, has been inflicted
in several instances, since the last mail. In one
case, two men, who were detected on the Cosum-
hes river, steal pg horses, were hanged at hail an
hours notice. They gave THUR names as James
Baxter, of Maine and Charles Simmons, of Mass.
The rancheros and miners possessing property Of
this kind, have become exceedingly exasperated.
In one locality Cthat where these two men were
hanged3 is said that stock has been stolen to the
value of 100000, and no mercy will be shown
to thnse who are detected.


Previous to the execution Of these two men,
another man, named Orville Hamilton, had been
tried before Judge Lynchs court for hoIse stealing,
convicted and sentenced to be hanged the follow
ing morning, but managed TO make his escape IN
the night. A man who was suspected Of aiding
him to escape was sentenced to receive thirty
lashes. On the South Fork Of the Yuba, man
known as Yankee jim, whose name was James
Knowlton, who had been detected stealing stock,
was also hanged, and previous 10 his execution
said he could implicate hundred others but
would not do -, .,l...

fifteen persons in it from Saturday evening to
Sunday evening. James Selden, white boy,
was found by officer Lynch and a watchman, on
Saturday night, in very bad company, and pur-
suing very wicked practices. He paid costs
and gave security for future good behaviour.
Eliza Lee and Henrietta King, sable wenches,
paid the same penalty. Elizabeth Talbot, equally
dark, was sent to the workhouse. John Pros
ser, found drunk, was sent down for sixty
days.


Messrs. Robinson and Eckton, young gentle
men, hired buggy from Mr.. Jeffcrs, near the
Navy Yard, yesterday, and last night became
stalled in pile of bricks at the corner of Sew
enth street and Louisiana avenue, where they
we're found by the Mayor of the city o little be-
fore IL o'clock They were rescued by few
watchmen, who took the abused horse and bro
ken buggy to Mr.. Pomphrey's stables, and the
gentlemen to the watch-house, whence they
were permitted to depart as soon as sober.
They nc, doubt feel badly to-day, but the buggy
looks still worse.


Officer Martin last night arrested Alexander
carp for trying to force open the door to Copp S
bar-room, and Michael Tooney for keeping him
company. He put carp in the watch house
first but while he was trying to get Tooney in,
carp got out through the window and departed.

on Wednesday morning from San Juan de Nj
caragua, bringing California dates to the 10th of
July. The Prometheus has brought on freight
S57S ,579 in gold dust, besides what she may have
brought in the hands Of passengers, who number
three hundred and sixty. She left San Juan on
Monday, August 4, at III a. m, and arrived at
Staten Island, below New York. on the
18th instant, at ii O'Clock p. M. making the pas
sage in eight days and twelve hours, bringing her
passengers from the steamer Paclhc, which leit
San Francisco on the l4th ultimo, and arrived at
San Juan del Sud on the 29th, with four hundred
and twenty-five passengers and $oOO,OOO IN gold
dust. We learn from the New York Tribune that
the passengers by the Nicaragua route came fif-
teen miles by land carriage; thence took the
steamer Director across Lake Nicaragua; thence
the new iron steamer Sir Henry L. Bulwer down
the San Juan river to the Prometheus, in thirty
two hours running time. They all expressed
themselves very much pleased with the route, and
say that the country is delightful. They had no
sickness.


The following synopsis of events is taken from
the -Alta California of the 18th of July:


''Snce the departure of the mail steamer, on the
first OF the present month, the only event OF mo-
ment which has transpired in city has been the
trial, conviction, and execution of ielon known
Jim Stuart, by the vigilance committee, body
of citizen Of the highest respectabiity and stand
ing in society. He was hung for multiplicity OF
offences, and, by his own confession, voluntarily
made, was villain OF the most desperate charac-
ter. He was hung about o'clock, on Friday, the
llth inst, at the end of Market wharf, in the pre-
sence of several thousand citizens.


GA Spanish woman was hung in Downeville, in
the Sacramento valley, for numbering man
named Cannon, on the 7th inst.


''In Sacramento, Marysvile, Stockton, and else
where, the citizens have felt themselves compelled
to act in their behalf, the laws having proved
so utterly inadequate in themselves, and their ad
ministration by the properly constituted authori-
ties so lax.


""Men have been executed for offences of Grim
inal nature in this city and in Stockton. The
cent execution of Stuart in this city produced
temporary excitement among those who entertained
opinions antagonistic to the action of the COM
mittee; but it appears to be subsiding. His honor
Mayor Brenham has issued proclamation desir
ing all good citizens to withdraw from the vigi-
lance committee, or associations of like charac-
ter; and Judge Campbell, ofGthe court OF sessions,
the 18th instant, charged the grand jury for the
county that all those concerned in the execution of
Stuart had been guilty of murder, or were partceps
criminis.


ercise its powers and is using its utmost endeavors
to rid the community of the villains who have 30
long infested it. Their acts are sustained by ma
jority of the citizens. Organizations of similar
character have sprung up in almost all the promi-
nent places Of California, and the courts have been
forced, by the expression of public sentiment, to
pay stricter attention to the administration OF the
law


""The intelligence from the north is by no means
pleasant. A party of pioneer emigrants, who had
been landed at Point Oxford, above Trinidad, con-
sisting of ten men, under command of Capt Kirk
patrick, were massacred by the Indians. The In
dams in the entire vicinity of Rogue's river, and
the Klamath region, have exhibited the utmost hos
tty against the whites, and being armed with guns
and pistols, as well as bows and arrows, are most
formidable adversary. Several parties of whites
i'm off had
mitted depredations, at the last accounts.


""The Indians are still troublesome in Sacra-
mento valley, and refuse TO come in at the place
specified by DR.. o. M. Wozencraft, oftbe Indian
commissioners. Colonel Mckee, also of the COM
mission, isat Benicia, preparing to prosecute his
mission in the region OF the Klamath and Trinity
rivers. Colonel Barbour is in the vicinity of Los
Angeles, intending to visit again the Indians in the
Tulare valley, who have recently exhibited a dis
position to break their treaty of peace and amity.
The commission are totally without funds, and ut
terly unable prosecute their mission to success
fal issue without additional supplies.


ga rencontre took place on the Let instant be-
tween George F. Lemon, City Assessor, and Will
liam II. Graham, young lawyer. Shots were
exchanged, and Graham was shot in the mouth
and left arm Lemon Immediately gave himself
up, but his adversary having told him to draw and
defend himself, and suited the action to the word
the recorder discharged him. Graham Is out and
doing we'll.


1.-THE 9TH of July was not celebrated with any
great pomp, in consequence of the calamity which
has recently befallen the city 1t was, however,
observed by the firing of guns, parades, &c.
""ln Sacramento City most aggravated highway
robbery committed on the 9th inst, in broad
daylight. Impatient of the laws delay, the peo-
ple by their united expression induced the court,
and the lawyers selected to defend the prisoner, to
70 into trial Immediately, and at last accounts
one of the party was before the court on trial.
""The Mormons making decided movement
toward establishing direct communication from
the Salt Lake to the Pacific. A large party have
recently arrived from Salt Lake through the Cajon
Pass, about sixty miles from Los Angeles, with an
expressed determination to settle in that section.
They said to be negotiating for the purchase OF
a very fine rancho belonging to Senior Antonio
Longo.


""fhe intelligence from the mines continues to
be extremely encouraging, and a general spirit
of contentment seems to prevail among the miners.


""The effects of the late fire in this city are yet
percephble. but the energy and enterprise OF our
citizens appears to be unabated. The burned
district although not entirely rebuilt, is pretty
thickly studded with tenements of all descriptions,
and brick and stone buildings of the most sub
stantial character in process Of erection in all
parts""


The California papers abound with accounts oi
Lynch law executions, of murders, robberies, rev.
elations Of crime, Indian massacree, sc. man
named James Stuart, convicted of murder and rob-
berry, tried, condemned, and executed by the
vigilance committee of San Francisco, on the lth
of July.


The affair had created great excitement at San
Francisco from the fact that the community is di'
vided into two partes-one favoring the admins
tration of the Lynch code by the vigilance com
mittee, and the other opposed to it. AS far as WE
are enabled to judge by the papers, the former are
still in the ascendancy, but how long this state
things will last we cannot say.


The San Francisco correspondent of the New
York Journal Of Commerce, referring to the vigi
lance committee of that place, says:


""Cahfornia, and this city in particular, is pass
| ing through fiery ordeal, resulting from the de
termined efforts of our citizens to rid themselves
the organized bands of thieves, robbers, and mur
derers who have so long infested this community

cellency, John Anthony Quitman, late Governor
of the State of Mississippi, has been discharged
from Gus dy--that the government C the
United States having failed to introduce any
proof whatever in support of the unfounded and
malicious charge made against him Originated
by the enemies of the South in order to degrade
the sovereign State of Mississippi that hac
through her convention and legislature fearless
ly asserted her rights under the Constitution
and to humiliate her Chief Executive officer who
had taken bold and prominent stand in behalf
of Southern Rights, either by forcing him to re-
sign his station, or to be led into captivity as
Governor of the State to be tried by an out of
the State trib iuaD and having accomplished all
that was inte, I'D in the commencement of the
prosecution, has ordered the same to be dis
missed; and, whereas, we have an abiding con-

condemnations and executions, perpetr a.
ted with relentless severity by the sum
mary action of the people. To those who
are unacquainted with the difficulties S
under which California has labored, ever
since the adoption of her State Constitu-
ton, the latter alternative may appear
even more terrible than the former; and
a course dictated in fact by the most
awful necessity which can be imposed
upon any ommunity, may seem little
else than the lawless outbreak of un :
bridled popular passion. We have been
somewhat sharply taken to task bv some
of our contemporaries for justifying the
motives of the San Francisco Committee
Of Vigilance, and the members of the
Committee themselves have been made
the subject of violent denunciation; yet
every successive arrival from California
proves more clearly the justice of what
we first asserted-that the Lynch Law
now in operation is not Mob Law, but
the result of a universal sentiment of Or
der, conscientious belief that it can
not be obtained by trusting to the regu-
lar authorities, and sense of danger



which impelled them to immediate ac-
ton. We have professed eur inability
to Judge, at this distance, whether 9TH
er means might not have been employed
to enforce the laws avoiding course
which must be always hazardous to the
future peace of society, even when the
sternest exigeney compels it. The dis
closures which we publish to-day, show
clearly the reality of the dangers to
which the Californians were exposed a;
they show how nearly hopeless was the
reliance to be placed on ordinary operas
ton Of law. So far as the evidence goes,
they prove, at least, that there have
been sufficient reasons for the action of
the Committee of Vigilance, to exoner-
ate them from the violent charges which
have been made against them on this side
of the Continent."

duce with the opening of navigation in the
spring, ani they are no.longer obliged, as for
/ mtrly, to hurry off their shipments during the
winter by the way of New Orleans, in order TO
!. realize funds b. drafts on their shipments. The
bar king facilities at the East are doing as much
to draw trade from us as the canals and railways
which Eastern capital is constructing.
. ""All the lead from the uppsr Mississippi, now

most recent and astonishing change in the
course OF The Northwestern trade is. to behold,
As Il frel tells us, the number Of steamers that
now descend the upper Mississippi, loaded to
the guards with produce, as f'r rs the mouth OF
Illinois river, and then turn up that stream with
their cargoes, to be shipped to New York via
Chicago.


""The Illinois canal has rot only swept the
whole produce along the line ofthe Illinois river
to the East. but il is drawing the products from
the Upper Mississippi through the same channel:
thus depriving not only New Orleans, but ST.
Louis, of a rich portion of their former trade""


To this we may add the fact that cargoes OF
corn have been recently shipped from Iowa,
down the Mississippi, along the Illinois canal,
by way of the lakes, to the city ofNew York.
! The cause Of this astonishing result may be
thus explained.


Artificial lines afford not only the most speedy
means oftransportation, but the unity and system
i of their administration gives them great advan.
tage over the efforts of individual enterprise
They have a basis of travel and mail monopoly
which enables them to discriminate in favor of
any specific article of commerce, the factorage
and financial results Of which may be sufficient
to generally indemnify them for the abatement Of
freight whilst the revenue of the improvement
Is sustained by an increased charge upon bus
ness not subject to connection, or by the large
amount Of trade which they command. These
exclusive resources, rapidly, certainty and safe
ty of transportation, with the power Of discrimi
nation that has enabled these great lines to
wrest from the Mississippi so much of its pro-
duce.


To establish the capacity of artificial to com
pete with natural lines, we publish the follow

gina, for exI ortation, could be collected in her
own Atlantic ports, it would not fall short OF
twenty millions of dollars, nor would her con.
sumption of merchandise be lcss. Besides this
the very organization Of commercial facilities
would guarantee an immense accession of min.
eral and agricultural productions


| In this connect n, we must press upon nll in
terested the indispensable importance of provid-
| ing for the Improvement Of the James river, the
common outlet Of so much Of the Chesapeake
trade Its distractions affect the trad, Of Nor
folk, Richmond, Lynchburg, and Kauawha and
each of them are alike interested in securing the
4 perfect navigation of this noble stream. Your

which this shall be done; they are aware that if
the interests now appealed to, shall be convinced
Of lis paramount Importance, the means will be
readily devised for its accomplishment. The

appointed on yesterday, charged with the duty
of preparing report and resolutions for the
consideration Of the convention have performed
that duty and directed me to submit to the con-
vention the result Of their deliberations.


For the information of this body, will read
the report of the committee. II is as follows:


The committee appointed to report to the
convention the most efficient means of achiev-
ing its important objects, have reformed that
duty so far as the materials existed for
proper statistical exposition Of the value Of the
trade of Virginia, rs well as the facilities CON-
pleted, or in progress, for its transportation to
the exporting cities OF the State


The commercial prosperity of Virginia is
based upon the employment OF the Chesapeake
ports; and no project for acquiring the ma
terials or the means Of expectation, can be sue
cessful which does not contemplate their em-
ployment. rn.|


The country tributary TO the Chesapeake
possesses advantages not surpassed by any
other on the Atlantic. Nature has been so
bounteous, that the difficulty has been, not so
much to discover good site, for city, but
to Disseminate between the numerous excellent
locations presented. Norfolk, Richmond, Pc
tersburg, fredericksburg, and Alexandria, have
all been established to receive and conduct the
trade of Virginia.


From the individuality of these local interests,
it has been heretofore impossible to adopt any
system of improvement calculated to promote
the exclusive advantage Of any one OF the cities
referred to. Apprehensive that the limited
trade legitimate to each might be diverted to
some rival, impediments have been thrown in
the way Of great lines of communication v it'll
the interior Of our own and other States, calcu-
lated, perhaps, to vary the local direction OF
some particular trade, but destined, in the end,
to compensate each of these cities, by its d-
vidend of trade far SURPRISING in magnitude
aud value, any particular loss. The evils OF
rivalry, will, however, be no longer felt, each
of these cities having received line OF internal
communication, many of which are now con-
vergng to a common point OF union ; interests
heretofore supposed antagonistic, are now har-
monized in the completion Of plan common
TO them all, and weapons frightened by the
confici of generous rivalry, are now welded
in the achievement OF common triumph. 1t is
thus that the construction of the South Side
raj road, and of the James River canal, make
the prosecution of the Virginia and Tennessee
railroad, alike important to Lynchburg-to
whose public spirit is so largely due the concep-
ton and execution Of that great project-to
Richmond, aud 10 Petersburg. The extension
of the great Central railroad to the Ohio, no
longer subject Of exclusive interest to Rich
mond, appeals to the support of Alexandria.
The completion of the Dock connections will
connect Norfolk with the James river and Ka-
nawha canal. and interest that city in its exten-
sion TO the Ohio. The Richmond and Danyile
railroad is upon the same principle, a work from
which Petersburg and Richmond may derive
common benefits.


Convinced, therefore, that their interest and
duty alike demand cordial alliance, the cities
of Virginia will hereafter bestow upon the ex-
tension of the great lines Of improvement here
in iicated their earnest and combined co-opera-
ton. . q.


Since, however, the partial completion of
these great improvements have already bestowed
upon the cities Of Virginia a large accumulation
oftrade, il becomes necessary to encourage the
establis hmcnt of n commercial marine, of sail
ships and steamers, TO convey abroad our own !
trade, and exchange for it the productions Of
other nations. The export and import trade OF
Virginia is now taxed with transport coast
wise, for expectation from Northern cities il is
burthened with the charges OF Northern mer-
chants whilst the whole commercial profits
resulting from freights, exchanges, as well as
from the Importation and supply of the goods
received on exchange, result ex lusiveiy to





We state this fact in no spirit of sectional
prejudice, but as consequence OF our own
supneness. We think it time that a trade so
circuitous, and tribute so unworthy, should
cease. We should now export from, and import
into the Chesapeake cities Of Virginia, by YES
sells owned and manned by Southern men. No
State can expect TO preserve its prosperity, which
does not provide for its citizens the varied pur-
suits in which industry and enterprise shall re-
ceve an adequate reward.


In estimating the present value OF the Chesa-
peake trade, so far as meteriaIs are at hand for
correct estimate, will find that the James river
and Kanawha canal its principal tributary. con.
tributed during the lrst year, SO, % S65,49, the
products of the interior whilst il carried into
the interior, merchandise and other articles val
ued at S7,727, ,224,29~


The business of the central railroad has
doubled within the past year, its downward ton
mage amounting to $4,000 tons, and its upward
transportation is perhaps one-half that amount.
The Richmond and Danve, the Richmond
and Petersburg, and Richmond and Fredericks-
burg railroads, contribute considerable additions
TO the aggregate of trade upon the James river.


Amongst other important items Of an export
trade, We may mention that the total inspections
of Virginia bacco amount TO 10000 hog sheads,
Ol WHICH the hrper pOIilOn - sHlppeu 10 bu'
rope whilst the remainder, with large amount
not inspected, is manufactured in the interior
for consumption at home and abroad.


The Touring mills in Richmond manufactured
last year l,l73,l00 bushels Of wheat, and are
expected this year to manufacture ,5S7, 100
bushels. This flour e shipped to Rio, through
Northern houses. In ,essels whose return car.
goes consist chiefly Of coffee. This coffee is,
in turn, sent back in Northern vessels TO Vir.
ginia, for consumption--the freights, commits.
sions, and commercial profits of both the export
and import trade, being direct loss to the
State Of Virginia, TO which this trade rightfully
belonged.


During the present year, however, some Of
the most enteprising merchants Of Richmond
have shipped nine cargoes Of -four, directly to
Rio, the vessels to return to this port with
hides, coffee. and other products Of South
America. We are moreover informed that
larger amount Of goods will be imported this
year to Richmond than has been imported in
any one year for series Of years; and that the"

The timbered portions of the Pottawatamic pur-
chase are comprised Of strip Of land forming the
esstery shore Of the Missouri river, and Of another
strip stretching along and including .he bluffs. u
range of clay hills dividing the bottoms from
the rolling prairie, ard which lie back from the river
at various distances, ranging from five to 6iteeu
miles al few groves scstteIed along the streams
of water tributary to the Missouri river TIE re-


due of this ira Ct of country is bald prairie, which,

mons and the purchasers OF their ""claiins,"" wnom

The undersigned found many persons in the dis

chase"" who have sold out their possessions in tue
Eastern States, and emigrated thither with a view
to better their condition; but when arrived, they
could make no settlements without paying prices
equal to the cost Of the full fee Of ands in other
sections, and prices entirely beyond their means to
meet. After having betrayed the expenses Of the
grafton Of their families and having sunk their
little means in efecting the same, they could not
return; and to live ard obtain bread, they have
been obliged to shelter themselves in novels, and

We are indebted to the Lynchburg I"" Virginian""
for opportunity bringing to notice, at this moment,
the precise language Of the Preamble to the origi-
nal Articles Of Confederation agreed upon by the
Delegates Of the old Thirteen States, as follows:
. Whereas the Delegates Of the United States Of
= America in Congress assembled did, on the ff-
y. teenth day Of November, in NE year Of our Lord
one thousand seven hundred and seventy seven,
and in the second year of the Independence of
America, agree to certain Articles Of federation
z and PERPETUAL UNION between the States Of New
!. Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and
I. Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and
Georgia, in the words following"" &c.


OF these ""Articles'' the 18th was as follows: \


Every State shall abide by the determinations
Of the United States In Congress assembled, on
all questions which by this Confederation are
submitted 10 them. And the articles Of this Con-
federation shall be inviolably observed by every
State, and THE UNION SHALL BE PERPETUAL nor


shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made
in any Of them, unless such alteration be agreed
to in Congress Of the United States, and be
afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures Of every
s-State.n


The clause Of Ratification, embracing as well
the Preamble as all the Articles, was in the follow
ing words 4:


And whereas it has pleased the great Governor


of the World 10 incline the hearts Of the Legisa-
II lures we respectively represent in Congress to
approve Of and to authorize us 10 ratfy the said
- Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union,
Know YE that we, the undersigned Delegates, by
virtue Of the power and authority 10 us given Tor
Z that purpose. do by these presents, in the name
and behalf Of our respective constituents, fully
and entirely ratify and confirm each and every Of
the said Articles of Confederation and Perpetual
Union, and all ard singular the matters and things
therein contained; and we do further solemnly


plight and engage the faith Of our respective con-
stituents that they shall abide by the determine


tons Of the United States in Congress assembled,
4 on all questions which by the said Confederation


are submitted to them and that the articles there
Of shall be inyiolably observedby the States we
respectively represent, and that THE UsIos SHALL
BE PERPETUAL""


Ten years afterwards, in the year seventeen
hundred and eghty-seven, the more fully to secure
and carry out the objects of the Confederation
prominent one of which was The ""perpetual union""
Of the States-another Convention was called,
by which the present Constitution Of the United
States framed and submitted to the States, and
by them solemnly concurred in and approved. The
Preamble to that Constitution commences in these
words: We, the People Of the United States, in
order to form MORE PERTEcT UNION, establish
i"" Justice &c. 1


In their first convocation (says the Virginian)
the States resolved that the Union should be per-
0efual"" They met second time to make that
Union MORE PERFECT"" Having consented to
the articles binding the Union by a perpetual""
covenant. and having gone into second Conven-
tion the prime object Of which was to make that
9 UNION"" more perfect no State had right to
make any reservation in passing upon the Consti-
tuition. And if the right to make reservations had
passed out of the power Of the States then, for
tiori is lit now out Of the power of single party
to the covenant to violate and dissolve that CO.
venant.


This is precisely consonant, as the reader will
perceive, with the opinion expressed by Mr.. Ma
OLSON to Mr.. HAMILTON, whilst the present Con-
ssttuton undergoing ratification by the States
>that the ratification of the Constitution by State
with any condition whatever must viiate the rati-
,fcation; and that the Constitution required an
adoption IN TOTO AND FOREVER."

The numerous perfect fossils found in Italy be-
gan as early as the latter part of the fifteenth cen
tury to create that spirit of inquiry which has been
lately developed into the science of Geology. Two
questions arose concerning these remains: W he
ther they ever belonged TO living animals, or were





they were buried during the Noachian deluge! If
our readers will turn to the pages of Burne.s Sa-
cred Theory of the Earth"" published as late as
1890, they will find an account Of the original of
the earth, and of all the general changes which it
hath already undergone, or is to undergo, till the
consummaon Of all things"" as it was understood
by contemporary theorists; for Burnet's Sacred
Theory became the textbook of the times. Du-
ring the last half century, however, the study Of
geology has risen to the rank and dignity ofa science,
and has been as rapid in lis growth and as cumu-
latve in its developments it is vast in its scope
and comprehensive in its object. There is no sim
gle science which sooner shows the sciolist and
exposes him to contempt; for geology is in alliance
with so many cognate branches of physical investi-
cation that it becomes next to impossible for the
piring and presumptuOus Seri studi0rum of our age
found their pretensions on science so exacting.
The profound geoogist must make himself CONVEX
SAINT with the whole circle of the scences-physics,
chemistry, botony, zoology, minersogy, physiolo-
gy, physical geography, comparative anatomy in its
departments of ornithology, ichthyology, helmin-
thology, &c. And if, like the authors whose works
we have quoted above, the geological student con-
sders also the relations Of geology to revealed reli
gion, he needs competent knowledge Of sacred
hermeneu,ics and clear conception of the princi-
Piles of natural as well as revealed religion. We
know of no other science which so forcibly reminds
the student of that fine remark of Cicero's, in his
oralion for Archias ""All the practical sciences
which have relation to liberal knowledge possess
kind of common bond, and are connected together,
as it were, by certain natural relationship""
1t is from the religious bearings Of geology that
the two excellent works whose titles we have ap-
pended above derive their chief interest and value.
There was time when very good but rather weak
minded Christians trembed at every thrust of the
geologst's spade, and started at every blow of his
hammer chipping off the rock like Prospero, the
specres that affrighted them of their own cre-
alton; and like Uzzah, there have not been want
ing those whose officious zeal has prompted them
to put forth their hands to uphold the ark when it
was in no danger of falling. We have but little
patience with the pusanimous faith of such reli-
gionsts though, in charity for these ""weak bre-
thren,"" we have often wished for some Lieut. Lynch
to drag the bottom OF the Red Sea, in hopes that
one of Pharaohs veritable chariot wheels might be


shed up to confirm their faith, or that some lucky
geoogist might unearth from his grave in Palestine
The skeleton of Goliath of Gath, encased in his he'll
met of brass and coat of mail, with one of Davids
""smoo,h stones from the brook"" lodged in his era
mum, and with his identical spear lying by his side
and its head weighing, according to the account""
precisely six hundred shekels OF iron. The vale
tudnarian religion and hypochondrac pietism Of
such disciples is not, however, worth the fostering
as DR.. Johnson would say, it has not sufficient vi
tay to preserve it from putrefaction it lacks the
Uis medicatrir and the Uis preseruatrir of living
and operative faith. We Think with Robert Hall,
that ii is degrading to the dignity Of revelation
tabished through a succession of ages by indubta-
bic proofs, to be advertng every moment to the hy
pothesis OF It's being an imposture, and to be nvit
ing every nsolent sophist to wrangle with about


the title when we should be cultivating the posses
sion Yet we far from believing that the attacks
of impiety and error against Christianity should be
unheeded when they have become formidable il is


then, and only then that they must be met and repel
led by the very weapons with which the enemythas
| conducted the assault. Skep,cism at various in
tervals has renewed its opposition to Christianity,
and when folled in mode Of attack has resorted
to another: it has joined battle on the field of his
tory, amidst the crumbling ruins Of Egyp-
tian antiquities, and in the foggy region of me-
taphysics, but in later times it has entrenched
itself behind barricade of stones and trees and
skeleton remains, and there planted its batteries for
a final struggle; thus eyincing versatility in the
mode of attack which demands corresponding
versatility in the conduct of the defence. Mr. Mil
ler and DIR. Hitchcock in a crisis like this, have
boldly volunteered to spike the enemys guns, and,
for the present at least, have succeeded we think,
in silencing his batteries, which, if opened anew,
will need to be manned by more skiful artilleriss
than any now in the field.

CuIiforuSn",,"blished government there is wholly subverted, and
in its stead substituted vigilance committees
or committees of safety, which recognise no legal
principles or precedents, save what found in
the unwritten and summary code of the law Lynch.
But while all this Is going on, alarming enough in
principle, but, wonderful to say creating no alarm
in practice, the tribunals in all civil matters are
recognised and obeyed. just they are in more
established and in older States Nay, even nice
distinctions drawn between the apparently con-
fiicting jurisdictions of the code Lynch and the
statute law, or law of the land; for we see in St.
Marysville (Cal) Herald before us that the vigi-
lance committee of that place declined to interfere
in Mexican brawl where knives had been used,
and murder almost perpetrated, upon the ground
that the case was not one for them, but for the
statute law. The illustration is SO singular and
sgnihcanrthat we must give our readers the case
in full.


Mexican, it seems, attacked by three
other Mexicans at ST. MarysvilIe, and was SO Sc
verely wounded by knife cuts that he was not ex-
pected to survive. He received seven or eight Sc
we're wounds The cause of the attack is said to
have been dispute, which arose few evenings
since at a Mexican fandango, says the ST. Marys
vile Herald. Thevgilance ecommitteevery prompt
ly arrested two of the men; the other one had not
been taken. The committee examined the two





them very conclusive; but, upon a cool and dis
passionate review Of the whole case, they deter
mined ""not 10 infiict punishment upon them, not
deemipg it case in which they were warranted
to proceed. They therefore handed them over to
the authorities"" But, adds the editor:


""justice Ellet examined the men, and detained
them till II can be ascertained if the wounds in
hicted upon their unfortunate victim shall prove
mortal. II so, the charge against the men will he
ri hat wit in
tent to kill. In either event, the trial must be
prompt. MUST, in italics, significant of Lynch q


'We think the citizens will commend the action
oil the vigilance committee. The purpose of that
committee Is not to punish offenders OF this class
but those who commit wanton attacks upon the
peace and property of the community; such crimes
as are more extended 10 their consequences, and
the extent of which cannot be known when they
are committed. 1t is no part of the committees
business TO take cognizance Of private quarrels
however fatal their consequences, except it be
found that those whom the law makes the guardian
of the citizen are lax or negligent of their duty
But let not the proper tribunal delay this case;
the trial must be prompt, and the punishment
must speedily follow conviction, if the parties be
convicted; otherwise the vigilance committee will
yet take the matter into their own hands,


The trial must be prompt and the punishment
must speedily follow conviction. The editor speaks
by the authority of Lynch; butt in the distinctions
here drawn between the jurisdiction of the court of
Lynch and the courts of law, we see the Difference
yet paid to the civil and statute law.


What is remarkable, nay, astonishing, is that
the Lynch law is becoming the popular law of the
land. The San Francisco Herald, disproving the
rumor that the Governor about to convoke an
extraordinary session of the Legislature in order to
reinvigorate the laws of the land, exclaims


''Tbe truth is, we are getting on remarkably WE'LL
This city is more free from crime than it ever has
been within recollection, and the measures being
taken by the vigilance committee will make it still
more We are fast and imperceptibly getting rid
of all the vagabonds who have been plundering and
numbering so long with impunity. 1t is true, we
have still wretched Judiciary; have a very in
efficient police but the citizens about to correct
all that thing by degrees, They have set a mark
on the .t forehead OF the Judge, and they have
sumed the duty OF the police There is conyie- !
tion in the minds of all that punishment will now
closely follow the heels Of crime, and that crime
can scarcely be committed without detection. 1t
is true that yet there are many things wanting
but what do not want ia an extra session of the
last Legislature. We have many difficulties 10
contend with, but really that would be burdening
US beyond our strength and patience.
""a great denl ia said about the prevalence of |
Lynch law throughout the country. Some three |
or four hundred warlike Indians have put to death
twelve horse thieves, Well, there is nothing very
deplorable in that. We are glad
to know that there is force of sort to restrain
such depredatons in the lower country; and while |
the native Californians have such force, we hope
they will always call .nto requsition against such





nora for murder, and two persons shot in melee |
at the place. II is to be sure, to be regretted
that the murder was committed, and that the melee
was provoked; but nevertheless the death of those
four persons was perfectly natural consequences |
the necessity of which was to be deplorcd of course
but nevertheless natural and unavoidable In this
city man has been executed for burgary-a man |
belonging TO gang of robbers, assassins and in
cendiaries. Lynch law, no doubt--but Just law |
punishment rendered necessary by the prevalence
of crime.


' In all these cases we have noiniustice and
in those in which the citizens the avengers of
the violated law, no haste, passion or thirst for
blood. A firm determination there is to meto out
punishment where it is deserved, and that determi
nation will be persevered in, whether there be an
extra session of the Legislature at Vallejo or not""


This is cool, complacent even. The attachment
of the people to the law is apparent from their
quiet submission to it. The committees of vigilance
proceed, weaee, with great system in all parts At
st. Marysvle there meeting of the COMMITTEES
held at the court house. The organization of the
was completed. There were tive hun
dred and thirteen signera. 1t the intention of
the committee to take complete census of the city,
keeping record of the name and occupation of
every one Locations in which there is any hesi- |
fancy in giving this information, or where the |
manner of doing so is at all suspicious, will be |
strictly watched, says the narrator Of the scepe In
all parts Of California like proceedings going on



This apparently necessary subversion OF the civil |
and statute lava is more nor less than revolu- |
tion, bloodless though it be; but what must aston
ish mankind is the and quetude in which it is
all done. The american element of self. government
is pTging itseifof the dangerous foreign odni1treS
that haze got into The STATE.


We have one other Lesson in this spectacle, and
that is, tho danger of opening State, California
has been opened, to the conyicts and criminals of
the whole earth. Botany Bay, and all the other
British penal settlements in the Pacific, have vom-
ited their criminals upon this rising State. The |
criminals of Chill, of Peru, of all Mexico, have so
fled there for an asylum. Our States this sido
of the Rocky mountains have no doubt disgorged |
their share of murdercrs, thieves robbers burglars
&c-criminals whom police and our laws
could ovcrawe here, but who run riot in California
Such facts as these the Caiornians offer as their
apology for the subversion Of the statute law, and
the establishment Of the code Lynch in its stead |
1t is fearful experiment the necessity for which
no state of society that have yet lived in or

the following sound and timely suggestions upon
matters OF great interest to every lover of his
try and respecter OF its institutions:


FROM THE PUBLIC ADVERTISER NOVEMBER s.


Last week heard citizen Of one of the extreme South
ern States, very intelligent and member of the Union
party say that much depends in the South upon the results
Of the pending trials the North of the persons engaged
the late Of fugitive slave from the hands of the legal
authorities He said that il the persons indicted fail to be
convicted and punished the feeling The South in favor Of
separation from the North will be greatly deepened and
tended that in fact, the people Of the South will conclude
that the they separated from the North the better


Now, that the persons engaged in the Of
the fugitive slave ought to be convicted and punished and
we most earnestly hope they will be; yet we say without
hesitation that have very little expecta ion Of such
suit The is one of those in which the system Of jury
trial the almost certain escape Of the offenders
with mpuniy. The great mass, probably ve-sixths
or nine -enhs of the na~ri~ as Arh-ss 10 IN
favor Of the conviction Of the Syracuse rioters, If the
testimony should prove their guilt yet there frac-
ton of the population Abotionsls, who would be OPP
posed their convicton what the testimony might
be. Now in the empannelng Of ures, the privilege that
belongs to the defendant Of peemptoy challenging certain
Number Of names gives him great advantages and, if the
charge against him that of aiding id the of fugi


tive slave, he will always at least in nineteen out Of
twenty, be abe in such community that at the North,
to few upon the jury; certainly two that
will permit verdict to be rendered against him. We
have belief whatever that the Syracuse will be
vcted; but if they permitted go free, their escape,
growing will out of the nature of the jury system and
the perverted feelings of very small proportion Of
nifty, should neither desperation susprse the
South.


The people of the South should bear in mind that there
classes of crimes for which convictions take place
Gently made in New Orleans convict Of the leaders
in the getting Of the first Cuba expedition the testimony
against them perfectly conclusive, but there much
pubic and private sentiment and feeling in favor Of them
that they and their counsel had difficulty in securing ues

after trial took place, and in every instance the testimony
strong it could be, yet jury to convict ibustie

tenths Of them without any trial at all


Take another class Of offences against law. In every

If the Syracuse rioters ecspeas presume they uli-

The citizens Of Syracuse, New York, held q
public meeting on Saturday last to give expression
to their sentiments in relation to the recent riot and
rescue of fugitive slave from the officers of the
law. The call for the meeting was couched in the
following terms:


""The citizens of Syracuse and The county Of Onondsgs
who in favor of sustaining the Constitution and Laws Of
the country and who desous Of expressing their abhor
and reprobaon of the late infamous proceeding in this
city by which the laws have been violated the Government
temporarily subveed and disgrace fixed upon the town IN
which these awess acts have been pepesed are requested
to meet at the City Hall in Syracuse Saturday, the 25h
day Of October instant, at ] o'clock A. M.


The necessity for meeting of this character has become
apparent BY reason OF the fact that by continued silence on
the part Of oW citizens, impression is being formed in
the who have been thus conpng against the and
good order Of society, that entertain feeling OF inder
ence TO these outrages.


It is we'll known that Syracuse has for several years
past been tie theatre in which have been held
where the most sdous and revolutionary doctrines have been
avowed and promulgated, until opinion has been created

posed meeting"" ae @


The above call was signed by some eight hum
dred Of the citizens Of Syracuse, including the
most influential men Of both the leading political
parties, and the meeting which ensued is described
to have been one Of the largest ever held in that
city. We copy below its proceedings, as reported
in the Syracuse STAR Of Monday, by which it
will be seen that the opinion
of the masses of the people nobly vndicates them
from the obloquy which is attached to the late dis
graceful acts of band of fanatics.

editor and the unfortunate of the rencontrc
Of Thursday. He expressed the belief that he was
nortally wounded and expected soon to die. AT
four O'Clock Sunday morning, when the stage left,
there had been change in his condition, and his
physicians expressed the opinion that though
chances were against him he might survive, and
there reasons to hope that he would.


The deepest gloom pervaded the town of Lynch
burg. The family aiiiction occasioned by the
event was extreme. Both gentlemen exten-
sively connected. Mr.. Saunders had been but six
weeks married. Mr.. Terry has wife and four
children. The hope was earnestly indulged that
he would survive.


The condition of Mr.. Biggers, the police officer,
was the same as at last reports He was severely
wounded, and not free from danger.

dress the speaker was warmly applaudei


Mr. pnckney WAS followed BY Mr.. Edward Lynch
of Utica New-York. who delivered a very brillian,
discourse on the influence OF Christianity on the
Civilization of Europe and America The matter Of
this Grafton. and the earnest spint of conviction
which marked the manner of the speaker, drew forth
frocueut ard rapturous bursts OF applause. II would
be next TO impossible TO give, within the limits OF
brlcf newspaper report any thing like periec' a'


stract even of his remarks. without doing an mus


tee to the able and eloquent manner IN which he
treated his subject.


National pride and is Legitimate Objects formed
the subject o. an eloquent Grafton by Gustaye The
baud. The speaker commenced by alluding TO what
he denominaied false National pnde, as nstanced IN
4 thirst for aggraadizement Of territory. and pro
ceeded say that the cause of all the mlsior-
tunes into which France has fallen since the year
l79e. after the peace OF Campo Fornlo, could De
traced 10 4 lust for territory When the victor OF
Arcol and Lodi made peace with the Austrians at
Campo ForTnio, France was bounded on one side by
the Rhine and the other by the Papal States. She
was bound by the same limits then. that Charlie
mssne gave her, to which Louis the Fourteenth
wished TO raise her. and which Bonaparte himself
AZ that time desired she should not pass The Drec
tory however who then ruled the deStnies ofFrance,


imposed on the youthful conQueror OF Italy the ne
cessy of taking first Switzerland and then the Papal
States Thus began that system OF INVASION. which,
step by step. brought the French arms 10 Vienna. 10
Berlin. to Naples, and eventually TO Moscow. The
nations of Europe finally up against Napoleons
victorious legions and they only satisfied thai
they had inflicted just chastisement on France when
he became an exile IN 81. Helena when they had
diSmaniled one-half of the French fortresScS, and
retrcnched many Of The finest provinces that Louis
the Fifteenth had left TO France To conhne our
energies then, SAID the Speaker. to that geographical
position which the laws Of nature and the sympates
of race Indicate should be the first object of States
mans pride, and within those limits to develop eve
nv Agricultural, Commercial and Industrial resource
to foster Art 70 encourage Science to open all the
avenues to prosperity and wealth--such should be
the objects steadily to be held in by those who
guard Nations welfare.


The speaker concluded by saying tina. the national
pride of America should show itself IN being
most Solctous not only to bless her own inhabitants
with just laws and a wise government, but TO be
ever the last in attacking the rights of others-the
last to infringe on the inhabitants OF other States
the last to take up arms, even IN Just cause but
the last also to quit the field and bid the ihunders OF
her cease so long as justice 20 her outraged
rights and her independence had not been secured
against every foe from without. She should be ever
the last to oppress others, but ever the first to bid
those who struggled for liberty toll on and hope and
to strike fear to the heart of the tyrant.


Mr. Dennison delivered the Vaedlctory Address.
After some very happy and appropriate remarks on
the many pleasant years he and his companions IN
study had spent in the institution, he alluded ma
prophetic strain to the many changes that would
take place there within the next fifty years Al the
expiraton of that period, said he this spot haowed
by so many pleasing ""reminiscences will have under
gone a great change. The City will spring upon
these fields amid those groves through which boy
hood loved to loiter Where now we see few scat
tered houses will then be the populous town The
old man as he visits the college OF his youth viii see
little that he can recognize The same merry laugh
will ring in his ear, but no familiar and well-loyed
faces will meet his view. Through all the mlshaps
through which they were doomed to pass. he hoped,
however there was one respect IN which he and his
companions would not change-the principles With
which their minds had been so studlously fed. He
hoped those great and golden principles would never
forsake them nor be found wanting TIL the last He
then bade adieu to his Professors and Superlors Of
the College, and TO his fellow students, N feeling
language, which affected all who heard him.


At the conclusion of the exercises, which occupied
several hours, Rev. Mr.. Schneider of Brooklyn ad

Arrival of the Alabama at New Orleans.
SAN FRANCISCO IN ASHES

The steamship Alabama has just arrived, with two
weeks later news from California, the dates being
to May l5 She came via Acapulco. Her news is
ofgreat Importance.


A terrible fire occurred in San Francisco, laying
IN ashes property to the amount of $l3, 100000.
Among the buildings destroyed, are the Custom
House, Union, Parker's National, New World, City
Demonico's and the Exchange Hotels, also Roses
buildings, and the offices of the Steamship Co.


The fire also spread to the shipping, consuming
large number of vessels which were lying at their
wharves. 1t was discovered in Clay street, and ran
through about dozen blocks, quickly spreading TO
other parts of the city, the greater part of which lies
heap of ruins. Hunter, George, Maine, Centre,
and Eldorado streets are completely gutted.


The utmost CONSERVATION prevailed during the fire
and thousands were turned out of house and home,
having lost their ALL


Measures were about being adopted to relieve the
distressed, and it is feared number of tives have
been lost. Business WAS not thought of.


San francisco presents soTowing and heart-sick
ening picture.


The news from the mines continues of a cheering
character. New discoveries were being daily made,
and the prospects Of the minee were highly favor
able.


Those working with the quartz crushing machines
were reapng rich reward. In some instances the
average per man was S3oto $50 per day


Lynch law is still in force and several new ex-
amples have been made"

immense quantities of earth are thrown
up, awaiting the rains The name is
significant, and the placers rich.

town of Mokelumne has been gradually
filling up with new arrivals from almost
every section of the country. The three
or four lines of stages running here, come
in full of passengers every evening, but
seldom have full complement in going
out to the lower cities--a gratifying
proof of the estimation in which the
diggings of Mokelumne are held by all.


Grass is springing up rapidly all over
the hill sides and in the vallies


ROBBERY gentleman named Van
Bibber, Kentuckian, having got upon
a slight ""bender'' in our town, on Thurs
day evening, was robbed of two hundred
dollars in gold dust and valuable mule.
The animal was subsequently, found in a
livery stable, in the lower end of town,
where it had been left by Mexican,
who promised to call for il in the morn

did not call, and thus saved Judge Lynch

The last English journals recount the recent
confession Of murderer which has hardly
paralleiin the annals of crime. The man Lynch,
little ard weak, but always deemed respectable
and religious, began his murderous career in lre-
land, by cutting down with an axe driver in the
highway, whose dray and bullock he coveted.
Soon afterwards, he overlook an old and young
man, and killed them both, In order to obtain
possession of their horse and cart With these
u
stopping at lonely farm, managed to kill all of
the occupants, consisting Of an old man, his wife,
boy, and little girl. He took possession of the
farm, and by his ingenuity and hypocrisy escaped
suspicion, and came to be deemed most ex-
empplary character. One Of his laborers at last
began to mistrust linn, but was soon silenced
with cold steel This last murder led to Lynch's
detection and conviction. Here Were eight per-
sons deliberately butchered one after the other,
all for the sake of little bit of property that was
hardly worth twevc-month's wages. This, in
itself, is a sufficiently strange phenomenon of
moral peryersion; but, as il to make it yet the
more extraordinary, Lynch habitually wore the
sembance of piety. He prayed often, stirred
up the consciences Of his victims before des.
patching them, and showed himself anxious that
they should not go out Of the world in their sins


The case Of Count Hippolyte Viscart de Bo-
carrnc, now on trial ir Belgium, has excited at
tention through all Europe. Descended from a
noble family, well educated, accomplished in
manners, he, with the cooperation Of his wife,
distilled nicotine from tobacco leaves, invited
her rich brother to dinner at his chateau,
knocked him down, forced the poison into his
throat, and quickly destroyed life. This case
has marked resemblance to that of Professor
Webster, not only in the social position of the
parties, but in the fact that each resulted from
the pressure Of debt that originated in ruinous
osteniation and extravaganza.


The Cosden murders in Maryland, the legal
investigation of which has just terminated, dis
close an atrocity Of purpose and 4 recklessness
of action that scarcely admits Of belief. The
parties to the deed were so numerous and out
wardly respectable, and the motives which in
stigated it were 30 exceedingly disproportionate
to its tremendous awfulness, that the mind in
stinctivey quaiIs before it as some mysterious
work of the powers of darkness, rather than
subject it to cool analysis as an act Of human
volition.


So of the enormties Of the Michigan conspir-
ators as brought to light by the trials now pen
ding in Detroit. Where, in American annals of
crime, can a case ofsuch diabolical malignity be
found? The agents were many of them men of
wealth and station, the motive private grudge
against public enterprise, and the contemplated
victims perfect strangers. against whom no
malice could operate, for they were utterly un-
known, and not one, nor dozen, nor score,
but hundred in number. A scheme of more
direful malignity could scarcely be concocted in
the councils of Pandemonium.


We this morning chronicle an atrocity nearly
in our very midst, which almost curdles the

ter, deliberately slaughtered in his own house,

evincing remorse for the act, courts his doom
and demands 10 be hung without trial. Read

and mark bow atrihes light as are"" In-y ytransform

These cases are varied in their character bat
they will show how little the malignant passions
of the human soul are effected by the merely
external influence Of modern civilization
Fiends as helsh as ever still haunt the dark
caverns of the human heart. Human science
with all Of its magic spells, cannot exercise
them, for their nature is far too subtle for the
grossness of all earthly appliances. Constitu
tional sensibties, social Establishments, or pru-
dental considerations may lull them into quiet
ness, but they cannot destroy, nor expel, MOI
securely chain them. If the doors of tempta.
ton are not habitually kept gudaded, guarded
too, under the dir, ction and with the blessing
of Heaven,--they, may at any time, when Q
combination of influences shall favor, be aroused
into irresistible energy, and riot without re-
slraint in their work of destruction. Who shall
determine the moral laws which govern theiI
activity and give them the final mastery? Who
can reveal the mysterious processes by which
they infusc their malignity into the whole being
of the man, and transforming him into then
own nature literally endcmon him

This has been truly an eyentful day.
While quietly III the office attending to

by the quick report Of the unmistakable
Colts SIX shooter. The street was soon
cleared, aud OH taking a look saw the
Marshal, Mr.. Mcfarland, backing down
the street, exchanging shots with Chill

Tne Chileno was still advancing, when
Que of the constables fred aud shot the

During this melee the Mexicans and
Chleuos attempted rescue, whereupon
the fight became general between them
and the Americans. which resulted in the
killing of two Mexirans, and wouuding
three Others. The fight soon after subsl-
ded 10y the foreigners reireatin9.
II is expected mat there will be gem

TO the convention, which was marked BY the lu-
ininous reasoning and valuable statistical infor-
nation, characteristic of the efforts of this dis
tinguished advocate of the cause of internal inn
provement. Ths following resolutions were
appended to the report Of the committee:


ResolUed, (asthe opinion of this committee,)
That lines OF mail or other steamers, or other
vessels. from Hampton Roads to some port or
ports of Europe, ought To be established; and
Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky,
and such other Southern States as are disposed
to aid in the enterprise, should be appealed to-,
and an appeal should also be made 10 Congress
to bestow upon snch line the same mail facilities
which are extended to the Northern lines; and
The bars which now obstruct the navigation of
James river, should be removed.


Resoit ed That committees be nppointed to
memoraize Congress and TIE legislature Of
Virginia, aud to prepare address to the public,
upon the subject aforesaid, and tie great i'm
portancc to the people of Virginia, and the
South generally, that they should conduct their
own trade directly on their own bottoms, and
with their own men and means.


Resolped, That lines of packet ships, screw
propellers, or mail steamers, ought to be estab-
lished between the exporting cities of Virginia,
and the West Indies, and South America
Resolued, also, That the people Of Virginia
be requested to hold meetings. in their several
counties, cities and towns, to effect the objects OF
the foregoing resolution; and that to this end it
be recommended to them to adopt some organi-
zation by the appointment OF standing and cor.
responding committees, or otherwise, as to them
shall seem best.


Resolred, That the merchants of our Atlantic
cities ought to import directly to our Virginia
ports the production Of foreign countries used
and consumed in this and the adjoining States !;
and tn it be recommended to the merchants of
the in erior and the people at large, to aid them
in this noble enterprise.


On motion of Captain Dimmock, the report
was adopted unanimously.

tion OF the resolutions, Captain Dimmock moved

mittee and the resolutions proposed by it, lie
developed his views i"" detail, deprecating the
introduction of party politics. of all appeals to
the federal government for aid, and insisting
upon the necessity of individual action. As an
embodiment of bis views he offered the follow
ing resolution, by way of substitute, for those
prepared by the committee.


Resolued, That committee be appointed to
open books for subscription &C a joint stock
cot pany, for the purpose of constructing or
purchasing the necessary vessels to form line
of packets between Virginia and Europe, TO be
propelled by wind or steam, with sufficient
capital 10 run the said vessels.

citemen in San Francisco which for several hours

rescue Of the accused from the officers Of justice.


The Alta California Of February 23d has the following

Mr.. PiscKSrY spoke for about half an hour aud the
sentiments that characterised his discourse breahed
spirit OF warm and patriotic feeling toward the democra-
tic institutions Of this his native country The subject
was well handled throughout aud considering that the
speaker was but graduating student young and with
practical experience he deserves credit the style
ia which his address delivered, and the fine Ian
guage in which it was couched.

ers, discourse by Edward Lynch, of Syracuse, New
York. This address was also well delivered.


o. National rriden discourse by Grlstaye j Thebaud

the ncrs asng national greatness of the United States

eloquence was displayed in the delivery.

parting and feeling address to his associates of the
graduating class and to the professor directors and
others connected with the college

The interval between each speech was relieved by

After the distribution Of premiums, which followed the

would otherwise have left the college grounds earlier

A moment believe, nor do we suppose that the
people who threatened him with Lynch law had
the slightest fear of any such thing What they

mislead the unrefeCting


One thing strikes US not little remarkable.
The opponents of Slavery at the North are often
charged BY certain class of journals with pus'

the question is triumphantly asked, Why don't

citizen does go South, for pleasure or business,

OF Charles Summer.


The citixens Of this Commonwe ealth who respect
law, and think il worth while to uphold courts Of
Justice will without doubt feel indignant at tho out
the court-roo of tho highest court Of the United
States in this district. e Qs


A prisoner. duly arrested, under warrant au-
thorizsd by law, was held in custody by the obi.
GERS Of the law, before the court which was about

force open the door Of the court-room. knock down
the oficsrs take the prisoner out o. the custody Of
dozen officers against the sudden rush of such mob
IL wholly unAvailing, and the rescue Is complete.
One Of the black mob, AZ II to give the United
enforcing Law here, in Massachusetts, was gone
from the whites, seixes the sword Of the marshal.
which was suspended as the badge OF authority in
the court room, and, unsheathing il, makes into
the street 70 head the mob in aid OF the rescuers
No State officer stops him-no constable arrests
him. In all its legal turpitude and atrocity, this
act Of insolent defiance Of Law is the same AZ IT, DUR
ing the trial Of Dr. Webster, mob Of persons con,
scientiousy opposed TO capital punishment, had
rushed into the courtroom and rescued the pri
soner. The example Of forcible resistance to law
and to courts Of justice Ia contagious. II tho mar
shal IL lynched 10 rescue the prisoner, tho judge
may next be pulled from the bench and hanged at
the lamp post, or at least tarred and feathered


This IL, in fact, the advice of Charles Sumner,
given to his colored followers in Faneui Hall. The
breaking into a courtroom, and stealing the mar
shal's sword, and rescung prisoner in custody Of
the law, are the practical application of the doc
trines of Mr.. Charles Sumner, in his atrocious
speech in Fansul Hall, November 26, on the Fugi-
tive Slave law. And when such teachings come
from . commissioner Of the United States court.
who has stcovn TO support the Constitution and
laws Of the United States, can we wonder that Il
rant colored population. 20 lead them to commit
the gravest crimes against societyf


Who il morally the greatest criminal, the negro
who broke into the courtroom and seized the
sword, or Mr. Charles Sumner, who taught him
that il was right and glorious to do so and wor-

we may not seem to overstate the case against Mr..

and trust that the parallel may be continued yet
further By burst Of popular feeling against oil dc-

year Of my life That enormous engine, fabricated
by the British Parliament for battering down all

with all future generations. In every colony, from
Georgia 10 New Hampshire inclusive, the stamp

his abilities and virtues had been esteemed before,
or whatever his fortune, connexions, and influence

Mr.. Saunders is the son Of DR.. Saunders, a

Saunders, who assailed him with stick. Mr..
Terry drew pistol ""a five -shooter) and fired at

until the contents of their pistols were exhausted.
Both of them were severely, and it is feared NOR

The New York Democratic State Convention.


SYRACUSE, N. Y, Sept IL, 1851.


We announced e,terday that the committee
on the contested delegation from the fourteenth
district of this city, had decided in favor OF
Judge Waterbury Mr.. Ryder, his contestant,
was afterwards admitted as an honorary Tem-
Der, on the motion Of his successful competitor


In the Columbia county case, Mr. Annable
withdrew, in consequence of which Mr.. Hoge-
boom, of Hudson, was left in possession OF the
seat.


The committee on organization then reported
the following as the permanent officers OF the
convention:


Prcsident.--George Hasey, of Tompkins
Vice Presidents j. Allen, Of New York.
Hiram Barber. Albany, Arnold Mason, Oneida,
s. p. Gould, Monroe, ]. Disosway. Richmond,
John +. Merrill, Warren, s. M. Purdy, Che
mango, Samuel NJ. Butler, Erie.
Secreiaies-A. L. Hazleton, st. Lawrence,
P. Tucker, Wayne, John Benedict, Lewis, Ma
than Westcott, Orange.


Mr. Maurice, of Williamsburgh, on behalf of
the minority of the committee, then rose and
UOmlt1uleU w ILL., W. DuuCh III piuCo VI ilat-
sey, remarking mt the time that he had no OBJ
lection to the vice presidents and secretaries.
Mr. Maurice also had the imprudence to state
that rumor was in circulation to the effect that
the committee on organization had been ap-
pointed with express reference to the selection
Of General Halsey as president, (Mr H., Ms tenn
pora,y chairman, having appointed the commit
tee which nominated him.) This unmannerly
alluson reused General Halsey, who rose and
indignantly denied that the committee had been
appointed with any such view He said he was
Cass and Butler man in ! 848, that he cherished
the union and harmony of tie Democratic party,
and had signed to act purely with reference
to such result in this convention. He con-
cluded by declining to accept the nomination Of
president This proposal was met with uni
versal no."" from every quarter of the house.


Sickl.s then asked General Halsey if he would
accept, if elected; hoping that the Generals
pride might induce him 10 say no. This inqui-
nv led to great confusion, but the result was that
General Halsey made no reply.


Mr. Maurice then rose, and nominated Bouck,
and pro eeded to denounce the proceedings at
length, as destructive of the hrmony of the par
ty, [he meant Of the prospects OF steamship spec
ulators.] He threatened the convention that If
they elected Halsey, there was an end OF the
Union The did not say whether he meant the
union of the convention, of the party, of the
States, or of the spheres, but we presume that
all are as mu n involved in the implication as
either one.l This part of his speech wns gen.
erally hissed He then said he spoke his own
views, and cautioned gentlemen against hiding
their heads and thinking, like the ostrich. that
their whole bodies were covered, &c. The bear
ing Of this figure was not quite apparent, but il
is one OF those rhetorical fables which will apply
to almost anything.


Gen. Nye, Of Madison, then rose and said he
hoped no member was TO be shaken from his
purpose by threats of any character. For him
self he should scquesce in whatever might be
the decision of the convention, as to who should
preside. He considered the motion TO substi-
tute another name, an insult TO the convention,
and one of the most impudent things of which
he had ever heard. Gen. Nye's remarks were
received with discussion and applause.
+. B. Cutting, Of New York. deprecated any
further talk as tending only 10 promote dissen-
ton, ard urged that the vote should be had at
once. II was n fight only TO be settled by count
ing noses, and the sooner they were at il the
better.


The vote was then taken on the motion TO
substitute the name of Governor Bouck for that
of General Halsey, and there were IS ayes snd
6s noes. SO the motion was rejected. The
New York delegates yo'ei as follows:


For Ex GOVERNOR BoucK, FOR PERMANENT
CHAIRMsK.--F. B. Cutting, Henry J. Allen,
Emanuel ID. Hart, Edward G. West, Daniel E.
Sickle-, Joseph NJ. Marsh, Michael Murray.


AGAINST BoUcK, AND FOR GENERAL HALsEY.
Freeman Campbell James G willett. Stephen
II. Feeks, Daniel w. Norris, Nelson J. Water
bury, John Cochrane, Lorenzo b. Shepard.


The report Of the committee Was then agreed
TO. and the gentlemen named by them clared
TO be the permanent officers Of the convention.


Messrs Birdsall, Of Broome; II. J. Allen,
fourth ward, New York; Dissosway, Of Rich
mond Mason, Of Oneida, then rose and success
svely declined 10 act as ice-presidents.


This was ore-ararged as part Of the scheme
Of intimidation, by which IL was hoped TO drive
the majority into concessions.


Mr. Cochraae, Of New York, then moved the
appointment Of a committee on resolutions.
Whereupon, Mr. Sickles again rose and moved
| that the committee on resolutions be appointed
BY the delegates from each Judicial district, So.
lecting two members from each district Mr..
Sickes said the resolutions he considered to be
the most important question that would arise.
He was free 70 say that he disliked the presiding
officer to have the appointment Of the commit
tee-tbat gentleman, in n recent canvass for
Congress, declared himself opposed to the Fu
gitive slave law, and he (Mr Sckles) wanted no
resolutions from any committee appointed by an
officer eut raining that view. lie assured the
convention that unless platform was adopted,
fully sustaining the compromise measures, any
ticket which Il might nominate would fail to re.
| ceive the support Of the Democracy Of his sec
ton Of the State.


General Clark and John G. Wright though
both hunkers, were discontented with their
champion, and censured his tone Of remark most
unreservedly.


Mr.. Sickles's motion Was rejected.
Tie motion Of Mr.. Cochrane was agreed TO,
AMI the chair was directed to appoint the COM
mttee.


The convention then adjourned till o'clock.

left the Georgia at Chagres, awaiting the arrival
of the Isthmus and Union at Panama. The EN-
pirc City encountered strong easterly gales during
her passage.


22d of June. 1t commenced on the north side Of
Pacific street, near Powell, at ten O'Clock in the
morning, spreading down Pacific street, through
Broadway and on to Stockton street. In half an
hour il crossed Pacific street, and at the time
crossed Stanton street, spreading rapidly down
Pacific, Broadway, and Jackson streets All in
Broadway, far as jackson street, was destroyed,


On Pacific street 1t extended far as Ohio street,
taking the City Hall and City Hospital In its course
On jackson street every thing was burned to Mont
gomery street, including few houses below on
Stockton street The fire then crossed diagonally
into Washington street, in the rear OF the Baptist
church, which saved. Ii thence extended
down Washington and Dupont streets, taking the
jackson House in its course.


The California restaurant, adjoining tho Alta
California office, was blown up, but did not pre-
vent the flames from crossing in the rear OF the We
randall and extending down Washington street to
Sansom stopping on the south side at Burgoyne's
building. On Montgomery street, the west
side is burnt from Pacific to Washington street.
and also all the east side, with the exception of
two three buildings near the corner of jackson
street.


Between Washington and Clay streets the only
building burned was occupied by Cronan 4 Mark
ley From Washington street the fire cfossed over
in the rear of the Ell Dorado to the new theatre,
which destroyed.


The flames then spread to Merchant street, and
thence crossed into Clay street, below the Califor
mia Exchange, on the north side. Thence the tre
extended to the brick building occupied by Rol
lanl & Wilde, at the of Montgomery street.
Immense quantities Of goods were removed to the
Plaza. which took fire and were destroyed.

Bach, Burnet, s. Co. In ali, about five hundred
buildings were destroyed, and the loss is estimated
at s ,0O0,0 Immense quantities OF lumber were
consumed. The persons burnt out are generally
insured


The fire was undoubtedly the work of ncendia-
ries and several persons have been arrested, but
positive proof of their guilt has been adduced.
Few heavy stocks of goods were burnt, most oil
the buildings being occupied as dwellings. The
excitement created since the fire against the des-
peradoes living amongst US has resulted in the
determination on the part OF the citizens to pre-
vent the landing of persons from penal colonies,
unless they produce testimonials of character
The proceedings of the vigilance committee have
been generally sustained by the community.


Captain Snow, worthy citizen of Sonora, has
been murdered by two assassins, and in two days
afterwards the ruffians were taken and hung by
the populace, under the most intense excitement.
In a Carson's diggings two Americans
and some four or five Mexicans were killed.

and the other to five years imprisonment
A party of nine men, under Captain Fitzpatrick,
had been cut off by the Indians at Pague river, and
all most inhumanly murdered.

Some persons who had taken offence at an article
which appeared in the Sonora Herald, went to the

OF all the Periodical Journals devoted to Litera-
ture and Science which abound in Europe and in
this country, this has appeared to me to be the most
useful. 1t contains, indeed, the exposition only OF
the current literature of the English language, but
this, by its immense extent and comprehension, in
most expansion ofthe present age.

Major stita's speech on the Preservation

 Of the union.",,"Of the Uni0ns

 In every city where # was announced that Jenny Lind vas to sing, expectation to hear and feel the effects of her great vocal powers, yas always on tipioe, and, so far as l have seen. il was always more than realized When il was announced on Saturday morning, by hand bills stuck up in var- oas places in this city, that Major StiIli. who Whg, and hss been puiFed by his friends, as ''ske greatest smp 0rnior a the Stats, would address us on the subject Of preserving the Union, my expec tation was also on tiptoe to hear the orator. bat perhaps t was too much heightened from the prais- es had heard bestowed on thus geatemanS orato- nal powers as now, after hearing him. l cannot place myself as to him in the sane category with those who heard and praised Jenny Lind; but must say, was very much disappointed. Always de- lighted 10 hear fine Speaker. at the appou;od hopr, I repaired to the court house; when had hobbled up there, found respectable 'coagrs- gatoa."" Among them I noticed pretty good sprinklng of the har9- fsfe4, inoor1sfibie drfqo- n'oc,acg;"" but the large majority of the auditors was composed of the ""yark and fie'' of the Whirs. headed by the presence Of the head men of that party. -l mean those principal Wings who, by their superior intelligence, have heretofore ruled that party Tn this county, and generally through out the State. After the lapse of soine minutes, Major Stith was formally, though in a very awk- ward manner, introduced to soyereigns, the peo- pie, by Major Lawson. He occupied the stand about an hour and half. My design is to com ment only on one or two points in his speeeh- Among other things he sad he knew of but two individuals who were open ayowed disunonists. Why then does he come here and preach 10 us. who are all lovers of the Union, the necessity oi is prcservationl Why speakto convince people on subject whom he admits are already convinc- edl Why commit such an act of supererogationq He is against inc continual agitation of the sub ject Why then speak on 1t at all, which IS eer- tainly agitating the subject His precept IS good, yet, like the wicked preacher, after giving fl. he fails to follow if himself. What then is in the wind7 Is it solely and merely love of the Union to speak thus to of the necessity of it's preserv- ation, who love fl as we de our wves2 Is there no ulterior views at this uncure, operating on and impelling tbe Major as well as other prominent Wings to agitate this subject? Is it not already known that the whole of the Whig party through out the length and breadth of this confederacy. as they have many times heretofore done, are about to drop old party issues, and, like the locuSs which have come this year, shed their old skin, cotbe themselves in a new dress, and come out under the popular facnating, and all powerful name of the great ""Tnion Party.""

 By thus attempting to gull and deceive the hon est yeomanry of the State, they think there will be a remote probability of electne their candidate to Congress. But again to the speech. The Ma jo sad If the northern States by their majority in Congress were to repeal the fugitive slave law, he would not be m favor of secession. Secession was not known in political point of view, nor had it ever been applied to State affairs, and was un- known to the law books, dkc., it being term only used when a schism occurred in churches, &c.- Yet he would in such an event advise the south to hold on 10 the stars of our flag and to the Consti

 tuition and government, and for such an abomna. ton he would drive the people Of the free States out Of this Unon, and thea give them the strlpes, that IS to say, he would emphatically force them to leave this Union, and after he got them out of it.

 he would tie up each rascaliy fellow whom he had driven of, to black jack, and although he would not inhict on him the old lynch law of forty! one; yet be would give him just th,rty- one stripes Tn commenoratioa of the Union. and to let the yllian bear in his recollection he once belonged to it, and that 1t was once composed of thIrty-one States. This was knock-down argu- ,l,tt r.l.

The same majority moreover that would repeal that law, would inevitably hold on to it with a strong hand, and would control the arny and navy, and would retain possession of the vari- rlous arsenals, doekyards, and other pubic prop efis, as well aS the public moneys. And yet with all these inequalities and disadvantages preponde- rating agaiaSt us, as well the great inequality in numerical force, the gentleman says he would

REsIsrANcE TO THE LAW BOSTON


A message was received from the President of
the United States. in response 10 Mr. CLAY's reso-
luton calling for certain information in regard to
the recent case of resistance to the law in Boston
The message was read az follows:


EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,


February 10, 1851.
To the Senate Of the United States:


have received the resolution of the Senate OF
the 18th instant, requesting me to lay before that
body, if not incompatible with the public interest
any information may possess in regard to an al
legged recent of forcibe resistance to the exc.
cution Of the laws Of the United States in the city
OF Boston, and to communicate to the Senate under
the above conditions, what means have adopted
to meet the occurrence; and whether. in my opin-
ion, any additional Legislation is necessary to meet
the exigency of the case, and to more vigorously
execute existing laws.


The public newspapers contain an affidavit of
Z, O
Massachusetts, setting forth the circumstances of
the case, copy of which affidavit is here with com
municated. Private and unofficial communications
concur In establishing the main facts Of this account
but no satisfactory official information has as vet
been received, and in some important respects the
accuracy OF the account has been denied by
persons whom it implicates. Nothing could be
more unexpected than that such a gross violation
of law, such high handed contempt of the autho.
rity OF the United States should be perpcrated by
band Of lawless confederates, at MONDAY. in the

prise, not unattended by some degree Of neel-
gence; nor do doubt that, if any such act of vio
iencc had been apprehended, thousands of the good
citizens of Boston would have presented hemseIves
voluntarily and promptly, to prevent it, but the dam
ger does not seem to have been timely made known
or duly appreciated by those who were concerned
in the execution of the process. In community
distinguished for its love of order and respect for
the laws; among people whose sentiment is lib.
erty and law, and not liberty without law, nor
result OF sudden violence, unhappily too much un-
prepared for to be successfully resisted Il would be
melancholy, indeed, if we were obliged to regard
this outbreak against the constitutional and legal
authority OF the Government, as proceeding from
the general feeling of the people, in a spot which
is proverbially called ""the cradle of American lib
erty.''


Such, undoubtedly, is not the fact. II violates
without question, the general sentiment Of the peo
pie OF Boston, and of vast ma iority of the whole
people OF Massachusetts, as much az it violates the



digraces those concerned in it, their aiders and
abettors.

Ii purports TO be the first of a series on naval
life, illustrating the various cares, deprivations,
duties, and enjoyments of that life, by his own
experience Of thirty-two years in the different
grades of our naval service. And Judging from
the number before us, "" The Midshipman,"" the
work promises much enjoyment and useful in.
formation to the reading public The author
commences his work with his first youthful aspi-
ration to don the bright buttons, and ""warder
DER the sea-"" excited by the weather view of
large frigate, and the gallant, dashing bearing
Of her officers and crew with their port togs on.
He obtains appointment to her. end starts on
a cruise to the East Indies, touching at Madeira
and the Brazils, of which places, and indeed Of
many others, he notes many curious and inter-
esting facts and throughout the whole work
carries the readers attention with peculiar inter-
est with him, as he wanders from land to land
and sea to sea-


The author draws us into an unusual degree
of sympathy with him in his trials and dar gers.
and we feel a thrill Of excitement and apprehen-
sion during the perusal of the many hazardous
positions and narrow escapes of the cruise.


This, his first cruise, proves to be an eventfu
and in some respects dastrous one, for, after
n variety of miraculous escapes from the perils
of rocky shores and mountain waves, when
about returning, that dreadful epidemic, the
cholera, made its appearance on board and soon
turned the proud frigate into hospital and
charnal house. On the first appearance Of this
drea iful disease, tho anchor was weighed, and
sail made for home, IN the hope that the pure
sea air would dive it from their midst but
such was its virulence, that during few days in
the vicinity Of Java Head, seventy of the crew
were cast into the waves.


The authors description of this awful period
when death in its most repulsive form was daily
hourly among them, is most impressive.


He arrives at length safely at home, and after
many amusing incidents which occur to the au-
thor during trip to the far West he joins the
squadron for the suppression of the slave trade
the futty Of which under the system, he
amusingly illustrates.


He returns from the coast Of Africa, and vol
unteers for the naval expedition fitting out
against the pirates then abounding in the Gulf
and West Indies

privations suffered, and skill and gallautry dis
PLAYED by those ohio composed H. the author
gives graphic and wildly interesting account
Besides the different events of interest incident
to active service, and much beautiful description
Of persons, places, and scenery, the author has
diversified his work with mnltitu1es of spirited
anecdotes, suggested during the progress of the
yarn, or connected with persons or scenes which
his wanderings associate with him; these being
introduced so nppropos in illustration of charac
ter add greatly to the interest and beauty Of tue
