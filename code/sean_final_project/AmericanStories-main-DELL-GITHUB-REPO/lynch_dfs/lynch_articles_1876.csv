The Finance Committee, on the COM
munication from the Board of Education
asking the Council to cfrer for sale the
unsold school bonds, the issue of which
was authorized by the Legislature, re-
ported adversely.


Mr. Febiger could not understand why
the committee could report adversely
The issue of the bonds was authorized BY
law and the Board was authorized to
erect school houses.
In response Mr. Hayes recited what he
| declared acts Of extravaganza on thepart
of the Board. They had recently pur-
| chased a school house, the Taylor Acad-
| emy and paid for it out OF the general
| school fund they had also just raised
the salary of the Secretary and Treasur-
er, who only has about three days work
per month to perform. They now rent a
school for $1,000 per anumn which they
propose to dispense with when the new
|
cost, judging by the cost of previous
schools, about $24. 900, it will be cheaper
10 continue to rent The school.


Mr. Paynter didn't believe the new
school would cost 1000 and it would be
a saving to dispense with the rented
school,


Mr. Lynch agreed that the Board was
somewhat extravagant, but thought that
according to law tie bonds should be is
sued.


After further discussion Mr. Lynch
moved to amend the report by striking
ont the word adversely"" and inserting
the word ""favorably.' Adopted by u
ayes to nays.


The report as amended was adopted.


The Street Committee reported favor
ably on the petition of the City Railway
Company. for permission to continue
their double tracks along Delaware Ave-
nue.; also, on the petitions Of the market
House Co, for the occupancy of the bed
Of Second street, between Market and

ever side shall be deemed advisable by

... WAsHINaToN, January ID, 1876.
In the House to-day, after the usual call
of committees and the transaction OF some
general business of minor Importance, Mr..
Knott, of Kentucky, of the Committee on
Judiciary, reported the bill known as the
Amnesty Bill with amendment, requiring
an oath to he taken by the person amnested.
| The Amnesty is general. The bill re.,ds as
folio VS.: ""That all disabilities imposed and
remaining on any person by virtue of the
Bird section of the l4th article of the amend
mems to the Constitution Of the United
States, be, and are hereby removed, and
each and every person is, and shall be for
ever relieved therefrom on his application
before Judge of any Court of the United
States, or any Court of Record in the State
in Which he is a resident, and taking and
subscribing to the following oath, to beduly
attested and recorded ;"" @

domestic, that will bear true faith allegi-
ancs to tine same and obey all law made in
CATION freely and without any mental reser-
vation or purpose of evasion whatever""


Mr.. Knott then moved the previous ques
tion on the passage of the bill. Mr.. Nc
Crary, of Ia, member of the Judiciary
~ ~, ;ttao oclod Mr. Kpott 70 viold b;ro
the cor for the moment. Mr.. Knott re-
piled that it would afford him pleasure to
yield to his colleague and to gentleman
on the other side Of the house, but he felt
hat neither the peace of the country nor
the harmony of the house required any fur
thcr discussion of the proposition. Mr..
Frye, of Me-, also a member of the Ju-
dicia ry Committee, asked Mr.. Knott to per-
init him to ask simple question. Several
Democratic members objected, and Mr.. Cox,
N. Y, said we have had enough of talk.
Mr.. Blaine-Will the gentleman, Mr.. Knott,
allow me, without one word of debate, to
have a letter read. Cox, Randall, and
several other Democrats objected. Mr..
kno5t-I cannot consent to open the debate
at all. insist on the previous question.
Uaughter.) Mr. Blaine, l understood that
the gentlemen from Kentucky declines
either to admit an amendment or allow the
debate. Loud calls of ""order"" from the
Dem ocratic side. Mr.. Randall, in remon-
STRANGE, You know better than to do this
Cox, Somewhat more angrily, you have
been in the chair yourself, and ought to
know better, Uaughter.) Mr.. Blaine, !
want distinct understanding. Mr.. (Frye)
simply desire to ask whether the Repub-
lican minority on the Judiciary Committee
concurred in the report. Mr.. Cox ""vocif-
erously,"" l call the gentleman to order,
Maine is always out of order.

ton was seconded and the Main question

birds not voting In the affirmative, Mr..
Blaine moved to reconsider the vote just
taken. The Representatives who voted in
the affirmative were Messrs. Farwell. Har
When Mr.. Haralson, who is colored, voted,
(aye) he was loudly applauded by the
Democratic side.


Mr.. Lynch, another colored member, said
he was In favor of the bill, but he wanted
Mr.. Blaine to have an opportunity to offer
his amendment. Mr.. Randall moved to lay
Mr.. Blaine's motion to reconsider, on the
fable. Blaine, you have not power to make
that motion. Mr.. Mills, of Texas, said he
could not understand how the gentleman
from Maine could always keep the floor on
these privileoed motions. He remembered
that when Blaine was Speaker, he gave
the floor gratifiedly. Mr.. Blaine said he
was clearly in order to discuss this motion
as it h IS brougl up the whole question. It
was not the purpose of the Republican side
to ilibuster on this bill although they might
follow the example of the other side which
ilibustered for seventeen days on the Civil
Rights bill, bill that was intended to give
right to


WHOLE RACE.


Blaine wanted this bill passed but they
wanted some opportunit to offer amendments
he thought the oath proposed by his bill was
proposed by Gen. Banks. Mr.. Hop called
attention to the fact that the oath proposed
BY Gen. Banks, required the afiant to swear
that he would obey all the laws of the U 8.
Mr.. Blaine said his was 50 and if proposed to
put in an amnesty bill that a man muct
obey laws to which received the af1ixing of a
stamp to a letter. Mr.. Banks said his side

Mr.. Blaine then read letter from Gov
ernor Holden, of North Carolina, dated
January IL, 1876. The letter says the
| writer observes that there is good deal of
excitement over the amnesty question, and
lie calls attention to the fact that in 1870 he
was removed from office by impeachment

""Whom the gods would destroy, they
first make mad is an axiom peculiarly
adapted to the present course of the Viz
ginia Democracy. In the cases of Repub
Ican Congressman elected from that State
they have recourse to partisan majority
in Congress to keep them out Of their seats,
as in the case of Piatt, and to award the
positions to those who are about as much
entitled to them as the man in the moon,
as illustrated in the seating of Goode. In
their municipal elections, however, they
are wont to rely upon partisan judiciary
with which the State is afflicted. A case
in point, and one which illustrates the capa-
bilities of the Democracy in the matter of
political villainy, has recently occurred in
the city Of Lynchburg, and while it has
been attended with no loss of human life,
is q species of the same kind of diabolism
that prevailed in Mississippi and at Ham
burg, South Carolina. The facts are briefly
these Previous TO the election in that city
on the 25th of May last there was but one
Republican official, viz, the mayor. At the
election held at the time indicated the Re
publicans not only succeeded in re-electing
their candidate for mayor, but also for clerk
of the court, city sergeant, treasurer and
commissioner of the revenue by majorities
ranging from 203 for the mayor down to 1G;
the Democracy only electing their candi-
date for Commonwealth attorney by a
majority Of 10, and the high constable, who
had no opposition. The candidates elected
all received their certificates, and were duly
inducted into office on the 1st of July.
Beaten at the polls and ouSted from Office
the incumbents being the Democratic can
didstes-the Democracy determined to con
lest the validity of the election in the Cor
poratiOn Court, reckoning, and not without
reason, on a partisan judge to aid them in
their nefarious attemptto to thwart the clearly
expressed will of the people. 1t appears
that il the Third ward of that city there is
q large Republican majority. In order,
therefore, to get rid of the returns from
this ward the cry of inf0rmaLjty was
raised. That was before they stole
the ballots. At the election in question
the judges of election we're all Democrats,
and the clerks were of like faith, together
with two or three Democratic challengers,
and the only representative Republican
known to have been in the voting place
consisted of one challenger. Beaten as we
have said at the polls, the defeated Demo
cratic candidates contested the election in
the Corporation Court, of which one James
Garland, a Locofoco of eighty four years
standing, is the so-called judge, basing
their suit on alleged informalities that had
been not only acquiesced in, but suggested
by the Democratic judges, one of which
was that the Republican challenger put
one ballot in the box while acting in the
place Of Langhorne, a judge, at Lang
horne's request, after showing the ballot to
L., and while the latter was dispatching
his luncheon. Another was that two of
the Democratic challengers assisted in
strlnging and counting the ballots; and still
another, that the Democratic registrar acted
as judge, having been selected by the two
remaining Democratic judges to fill the
place of another Democratic judge, who
failed to make his appearance at the proper
hour. The appropriateness of this action
was deemed all right in view of the fact
that the same individual registrar had acted
at the election last fall, and no objection
was then or afterwards made to it. These
were the pretexts upon which this contest
was inaugurated before partisan judge,
whose adaptabilitY to the infamous pur-
,,ocao IF tho nanocr,cu is ao up0uae+;on,5
as his indisposition to pay his honest debts
Knowing as we did the character of this
official, the NATIONAL REPUBLICAN at the
beginning Of the contest predicted the re-
sult and advised the Republicans of
Lynchburg tC save themselves the cost of
defending a suit wherein it would be found
that they had no rights which this corrupt
old partisan would respect This advice
was based on the fact that he had on more
than one occasion before rendered decisions
adverse to Republicans, and it was be-
lieved because Of their politics, an opinion
that was verified by the action of the Court
of Appeals in upsetting his verdicts, and
our predictions have been more than real
lied by the result; Notwithstanding the
fact that all the witnesses on both sides,
judges included, declared their belief that
the election was fair one; that no fraud
had been practIced or even attempted,
fact SO patent that even Judge Garland
himself admitted it in his so-called decision,
yet decided the case against the sitting Off
cials, elected them from their positions,
and reseated the Democrats whom the peo-
pie had repudiated. Among those reseated
Democrats was the clerk Of the court who"

preached by the Rev. Dr. Duny OF 81 Josephs church.
in response 70 an invitation from the Union he took
his text from the episte OF St James second chapter
where the disciple says that not only faith but good
works are necessary for salvation We apt
slider the world before the dawn OF Christianity
mersed in awful ignorance and glocm; without honor,
without morality, without God, without any fixed prn
cples TO guide virtue without any definite cnd
toward which to direct his footsteps wthoa; any
BILE assurance OF hnal retrbution But all these
misses false, and never was the world In state Of
greater intellectual grandeur than at tho period
when the twelve fishermen converted to
principles heretofore unknown. Every art that could
humanize cnnobe man had attained it's highest
perfection Every branch Of literature that tended TO
the exercise OF the best faculties had been cultivated
success School after school had discussed the alb
strusest sciences and sought solution Of the mystery
of mans existence. The Roman principles of philos-
ophy had como the truth the ethical code OF
Alexandria had proposed higher and purer standard
OF morals and even upon the subject of the Godhead
Paganism had thrown oil many of It's grosser ideas
and aimed at teaching principles Of intellectual
character. Yet, Notwithstanding all this grandeur
and mental culture, such the tropical splendor OF
the sun Of revelation that men thought from the con-
trast 10 have passed fromthe darkness of midnight TO
the brightness OF noon This was the man
of the coming of faith. 1t
the lght-smple complete and universal II spoke of
the past and the future with the same certainty Of
the present IL spoke OF eternity Of tme II spoke
OF and the greatness of his destiny in the tte-
ness of his origin. But Notwithstanding all this,


MAN IN HIS PRIDE


of heart and in his OF Christian humility
carried away by this uminary OF faith to wrest IL
to his destruction. For We find IN after
times men ignoring the principle OF good works and
depending solely upon their faith for Justification tell


ing that Christ effected the redemption OF mankind
SO completely, wiped away the worlds sins SO utterly
that all we have TO do is TO lean upon HIM, and that
without any concurrent labor of our own but solely by
the easy operation of believing in Christ saved
Hence hear often the doctrine OF justification by
faith alone Hence much abuse OF the Catholic
Church and OF Gods sacraments, simply because
she and lhey say that the murderer must shed
Of contron that the thief must return his stolen
booty that the avengeful and the dctractor must re-
store tho fortune and the name OF their victims; that
although without faith, is impossible 10 please God
nevertheless iath without works IS dead that al
though il is faith the mysteries and revelation OF the
Christian religion which saves us nevertheless II Is
faith its precepts without their observance which
condemns u.s. And here 1t Is that the Catholic Church
meets two different kinds OF opponents-one the
Peagan heresy, which seems TO resuscitae itself in
this day, and which says, If am an observer OF
the law If refuse to lie, # scorn to steal If my man.
hood refuses degrade itself by any act of moral
physical intempcrance l cannot fail TO satisfy ajust
God, matter what relgion or faith profess. Now,
let cndeavor to dsabuse this impression by assur
ing you that your good works can have no
merit but by and through faith. Faith
IL is that impress them with the
seal of eternal lite as the bank noto issued from
the Treasury Department would be useless without the
proper Endorsement SO whatever we do, though hon
orabe and audabe, # it bear not the characteristic OF
faith It were presumptuous to suppose 1t conducive 10
salvation This what ST. Paul inculcates TO the Jews
when he tells them:-'Immoate whatever victims
you please, purify your bodies ever SO much, make
whatever profession you like of an exact religious
ship il all these obServances all these ceremonies bo
not sancti1ed by faith they TO purpose And
this is what the doctors OF the Church demonstrated
necessarily to the herecs OF their times And this is
why preach it to you. And although the argument is
in my words nevertheless 1t is the doctrine of the
saints the doctrine of the Scriptures the doctrine OF
Jesus Christ, that without faith, sincere humble,
obedient faith il IS Impossible to please God Wiil you
ity which compromises the doctrines OF Jesus Christ


answer, cannot do It, IL is my duty simply TO tell
them you II they are too hard, close not with me;
close with that God who created you who
sanctined you, who redeemed you solely out
OF His mercy, aud tell Him, If you imagine
and who bear itY However, His doctrine is
unchangeabe as Himself, and still remains. BE you
angels or martyrs in respect to morals, If you
wanting in purity of faith, in simplicity of faith,
sincerity of faith, answer with ST Paul, your works
avail you nothing, without faith it is impossible TO
please God"" But, strange to say, scarcely has the
Church met and refuted this heresy when she has TO
turn her attention to another the exact contrary OF
the former however, no less subtle, but more ex
travagant and unreasonable. l speak OF of the
primary doctrines OF the Reformation that faith alone
without good works will This is smooth
doctrine and remarkably agreeable doctrine 1t only
lead heaven and that pandered successfully to
the degraded age in which was promulgated Faith
without works forsooth. Ask the saints and martyrs
of Christianity II they believed this doctrine Why was
It they prayed tasted and bled Tor their aith2 Why
was 1t they practised with wonderful constancy the
whole compass of evangelical councils and they Will


tell you they did not believe this doctrine for ST. James
taught them different when he said las the body
without the spirit Is dead, 80 also faith without good
works is dead"" Is there anything which conduces
more directly or speedily TO inhdety and licentous-
ness of belief than iniidelity and RIGHTEOUSNESS OF
works II this be true, where is your fundamental
doctrine that faith without works will save you Is
It not in accordance with the equity OF our contract
to bind a man the moment he accepts that
tract TO all the obligations embraced therein Why
is it, then when VIC by faith have accepted the
Dbrcfta anitv Inv ifc al
obligations Let me assure you, and you will lind
in accordance with reason, that the Christian who
has accepted and believed Christianity and not fol-
lowed its precepts-n words who has relied upon
the doctrine that faith alone will him--will be
more severely Judged and more terribly punished

know it. hence elections there are always
fairly aud peacefully conducted. Even a
Conservative paper, the EceninI StIr,
admits this. Witness the following from
its issue of Friday:


""The election was fair and the result is un-
avoidable. Let us, then: pursue the even

Asa result of this ""fair. play"" system,
the city. although possessing registered
Democratic majority, was carried in the
late election by the Republicans. who were
not restrained by intimidation from voting,
and. owing to. their freedom from restraints
that obtain in Petersburg and elsewhere,
they were enabled, in common with their
opponents, to look after their party inter
ests and see that the ballots were fairly
counted. -s.e


We have yet to hear of the Democratic
mayor who is influenced by the sense of
justice and fair mindedness that obtained
with Mayor Burch, whom the people of
Lynchburg have had the good sense to re-
elect by large majority. Referring to
the character of the gentlemen on the
Republican ticket, the Star, Conservative,
says:


-"" As to the gentlemen elected we have only
to say that Lynchburg is to be congratulated
that she is to be represented at least BY her
own citizens, and men of good standing and
identified with her interests. And now, fellow
citizens that the thing is over, let US lay aside
all elimination and recrimination."""

names of those Fathers of American Indeper

The Massachusetts, delegation
| That signed our glorious Declaration,


Were Hancock. Geary, Robert Paine


The great John Adams, and again


Another Adams, Samuel by name.


New Hampshire, called the 'fGranite State,
Sent Whipple, Bartlett, Thornton great
Alike in counsel and debate.
| 3 Rhode Islands delegates, We see,


Were Stephen Hopkins and Ellery.
q Connecticut excelled by none,


Sent Roger Sherman, her noblest son,
With Walcott Williams and Huntington.
S New York as delegates employed
Lewis, Morris and William Floyd
With Francis, Lewis and Livingston,
Who died before the war was done.
New Jersey to the Congress sent
Her honored college President,
John Witherspoon, with Stockton, Clark,
Hart, Hopkinson-all men of mark
Though Pennsylvania need not blush
For Morris, Morton, Wilson, Rush,
And though most men might seem as dross
To Clymer, Taylor, Smith and Ross,
To Franklin each his tribute brings
Who neither lightning feared, nor kings.
The men from Delaware-indeed
As true as steel in utmost need
Were Rodney, with MacKean and Read.
""My Maryland"" is proud to own
Her Carroll, Paca, Chase and Stone.
10 On old Virginia's roll we see
The gifted Richard Henry Lee;
And, just as earnest to be free
His brother FraRcis Lightfoot Lee;
And Wythe and Nelson patriots true
With Harrison and Braxton too,
But of all of them there was not one
As great as Thomas Jefferson.
IL North Carolina's chosen men,
We know, were Hooper, Hewes and Penn.
IL And South Carolina's vote was one
By Hayward, Lynch and Middleton.
l3 From Georgia came Gwinnett and Hall
And Walton, too, the last of all
Who signed our precious Declaration,
The pride and glory Of the nation."

HOW SIX MUIR",,"HOW SIX MURDERERs WERE LYNCHED.


The telegram announced the lynch.
ing few days since, near Edgeield,
South Carolina, of six colored men,
charged with the murder of Mr.. and
Mrs. Harmon, a venerable and infiuen'
tial white couple. The Charleston
News and Courier says when the in,
guess closet the prisoners We're dsliv
cred into the custody of the shoriff fn,
commitment to jall. But Immediately
the sheriff was seized by the crowd
which numbered about six hundred
perso rs, his head was hastily covered
with bag, and he was carried off by
force and confined. All of the prison
ers were taken by the crowd, which
was composed of both white and black
citizens, and marched to a point half 6
mile from the scene of the MURDER
There the six men who had committed
the crime were tied firmly together il
a row, and five minutes were given tc
them to pray, at the expiration Of
which time a volley of one hundred
shots were fired, and the six wretches
fell dead to the ground, About three
hundred men took part in the last acI
of the lynch.ng. They were variously
armed with rifes,shot guns and pistols
No masks were worn by anybody, and
and there was NO exhibition of any ex
citement of any kind. no loud talking
and no whiskey. Previous to their ex.
ecution two of the men confessed thai
the party had been concocting the
murder for several weeks. After the
murder the house was gutted of every
thing valuable, and part of the goods
were recovered in the hands of one o.
the men who was executed."

Va woman, who helped her paramour,

thus describes her wretched condition !:

with dreams of skeletons, and fen dis
dance around her bedside, their mock

the horrible past. She PAGES up and
down her strongly barred room wishing
for death, and occasionally dashes her
hands into her eyes as If to keep from
her gaze the awful scenes attending the
inhuman butchery of her husband. She
has wasted in flesh to such an extent

turc.

The election in this city took place |
yesterday, and was conducted very |
quietly, excepting in the Sixth Ward,
disturbance occurred about |
two O'Clock.
A man named John Fry, who has
been living In this city for about three |
years, and for some time past in the
Sixth Ward, attempted to vote, and
was challenged.
In the confusion which followed
Fry was struck by some one, when he
drew revolver. Some half dozen
shots were instantly fired, by whom it
is impossible to tell, but Fry was
shot in the back part of the head.


A man named Wingate was also
struck in the hand and one of his
fingers slightly cut.
Fry was brought to the City Hall,
where his wound was dressed by DIR.
Ogle. 1t was only flesh wound and
not serious. He said that the shot
which struck him was fired by Heal.
He was afterwards taken to his home.
In the second Ward, Ned Leary,
COL, fer interfering and challenging
voters, was soundly punched.


The negroes voted freely, particular
ly in the Sixth Ward, where the votes
of colored repeaters were taken with>
out reserve while legal Democratic
votes were frequently refused, a negro
who attempted to vote for McMena-
min was dragged away from the polls
by five or six other negroes, who re.
fused to allow him to vote unless he
voted straight.

SECOND DAYS SESSION.",,"seciolly report for the Gazette. .


NRw CASTLE, MAY 9th. 1875.


Court opened this morning at ten
o'clock, Judges Wooten and Houston
on tho bench. The Grand Jury list
was then called and sworn, Evan G.
Stotserburg being sworn as Foreman.
Judge Wooten then delivered the
charge Of the Court, substantially as
follows:-


""GENTLEMEN or THE GRAND JURY:
1t has not been customary for many
years for the Court to deliver long
written charge, as formerly. Our Re-
vised Code has been so well arranged
and the laws so classified, that this ne.
ccssity has been superseded. At the
present term, | am happy to say for
the credit of New Castle county, there
are no capital felonies. Most of the
business that will fall under your no-
tice, is of trifling nature, such as
larcenles, assaults and batteries, illegal
sale of intoxicating liquors.


The Courl here called the attention
Of the Grand Jury to the provision of
the Revised Code, concerning crimes
and misdomeanors. and also to the act
regulating the sale of intoxicating
liquors and remarked that whether
this law was wise or not, was not for the
Court to say, but it was the law of the
State, and while it was such it was the
duty of those concerned to obey it and
especially those who arc granted Ii
eenses.


The Grand Jury then retired 10 their
room.


The first case called was State VS..
Robert Lansing-gambling. The de-
fendant not being taken the State re-
tired the case. A


State VS.. John G.. Hey-assault and
battery with intent to kill MIR. Dugan,
November 7th last. The defendant
pleaded guilty of an assault only. The
Court heard the evidence tending to
prove family quarrel at Heys, and
Mr.. Dugan's interference whcreupon
Hey went for Dugan with a knife.


The defense called a witness to prove
that he had no knife and the night was
too dark to see a man from the curb
and also that Hey was drunk. Attorney
General for State, Whiteley for de-
fense. The court imposed fine of
$40 and costs.


In another case against Hey growing
out of the same transaction the Attor-
ney General entered a 7soIIe pros. upon
the payment of costs.
State vs. Daniel O'Neill-Assaulta and
battery upon AL. Wingate, with intent
TO kill. This is a case growing out OF
the shooting of Liizze Doyle by o.
Neil, last year, while he was pursuing
Wingate to arrest him. The Attorney
General entered nsHe pros in the case,
O'Neil paying the costs.


State VS.. George Reans-Larccny of
articles of the value of $50, from the
residence Of Thomas IL. Poole, in Mill
Creek Hundred, May 16, 1875. The
Jury returns mot guilty.


State vs.. Michael Lynch-Selling
liquor without license. Pleaded gull
ty"" and fined $50 and costs.


State VS.. Theodore Schmit-Selling
liquor without license-three cases
n0lie pr Os entered.


State rs. Timothy Quill Selling
liq Ior without license-six cases.
Bonds forfeited,


:, State VS.. Thos. Lally-Selling liquor
Illegally. Bonds forfeited. Four
cases.


State vs.. Joseph Lafferty - Selling
liquor without license. Six cases
nolle pros. Defendant is now in Aims
house, and the State considered it as
cheap for the County to have him
there as in Jail.


State VS.. Abraham Kinslew-Appeal
in bastardy. The State hud no evil
dence to offer. The Jury found that
Abraham was not the father of that
child.


At 1.05 p. m, the Grand Jury re
turned and were discharged until 8
p. m.


State VS.. Charles J. Kyle-Selling
liquor without license. Three cases.
Bonds forfeited.


The following bills were found:-


State VS.. Wm. Benton, (col}-Lar-
ceny. Two charges.


State VS.. VIM. Diggs-Larceny,


State VS.. Edward NJ, ers = Larceny
State VS.. Thomas Davis and Samuel
Bush-Larceny.


At 2 O'Clock, Court adjourn I'd until
y p. IN.


AFTERNOON SESSION.
Court was opened at p. M, and the
Grand Jury returned to their room.
!! The Court then proceeded to arraign
the prisoners against whom true bill,
were found in the morning, and all
pleaded mot guilty""


The first case called was State vs.
Edward Myers, who was charged with
stealing Noah Cannon's silver watch
on the frst of February last, in vii.
mipgton. The Juiy. after a short alb
sence, returned verdict of guilty.
) The next case called was State vs.
. VIM Diggs-Charged with stealing &
gold watch from William A. Coyle, il
Wilmington, last January. The prose
cutting witness, Mr.. Coyle, a whit,
IMAM, was robbed in negro house O
,. prostitution, and accused Diggs If Ia
king the watch. Diggs claimed tina


he keeper of the house, Mary Ross

John Carpenter, the negro cattle
thief was arraigned before Esquire
Brady, this morning. and was held for
trial at the next term of Court on tn
following charges:


For stealing seven ice cream freezers
and three tubs from Charles Kyle, $500
bail.


For stealing one cow twice from
!ssss 'ssis. sharpeS $500 bail for each


For stealing COW from Sam'l Logan
$500 bail.


For robbing the house of John Lewis
Twelfth and Tatnall streets, of cloth
ing and other household articles $500
bail.


This list does not comprise all of
Johns crimes. as three parties from
whom he had stolen one horse and
two cows failed to appear against him
They will probably prefer their char
gcs at some later day, and by the time
of this trial, the bold cattle thief will
have enough charges against him to
consign him to prison for life time,
and cover his black body with lashes
from top to toe. This afternoon he
was sent to New Castle in default OF
bail.


1t was suggested at the hearing that
John be shipped out West for trial, IN
those Localities where cattle thieves
are tried before Judge Lynch, and their
sentence executed upon the most con-
venient trees, Delaware justice, hsw.
ever, will probably prove sufficient in
this case."

AS determined and general effort has been
made to misrepresent the returning board of
Louisiana, and to exalt the functions of the
distinguished citizens who have focked to New
Orleans to relieve the legal authorities Of all
responsibility in the discharge of their duties,
it is well to bear in mind the contrast between
the two bodies, and not to fall into the mis-
take Of supposing that their powers are co ordi-
nate, their authority equal, and their decision
equally final and binding.


The returning board is legal body, called
into existence by the laws of Louisiana, prop
erly organized, and assembled to discharge
function which is clearly defined by statute.
They may be incompetent men, they may be
corrupt men, they may be even as vile as the
gamblers and mercenaries who have managed
the Tilden campaign, but they are the only
body known to the law in this matter. Their
action can be set aside only by an appeal to
the law, and no citizen of this country has any
more right to insult them beforehand, by the
declaration of what their course will be, or to
attempt to bully or coerce them by any means,
than he has to walk into q court of law and
insult the judge by announcing what his de-
cision will be on case he hasn not heard.


The distinguished citizens ,on the other hand,
are merely q miscellaneous excursion party,
some of whom are decent men, some of whom
are bummers, but all of whom, bummers and
decent men, are equally devoid of authority.
Their pretense that they have come there to
see fair play is as insolent as if bully had
staggered into court to tell the judge that he
was going to see just decisions rendered. They
have as much right to visit New Orleans as any
other citizen has, but when they advertise that
their super-serviceable celerity In travelling
endows them with an authority to revise and
reverse the action of the legal authorities they
not only commit an impertinence which stamps
them as ridiculous, but they become mere
bummers, threatening tribunal they cannot
control.


The very fact of their going down there at
the invitation OF partisan committee shows
that they are not impartial, but that they have
q deep interest in the decisi on they wish to
bring about. They have shown their fitness
to sit as impartial arbitrators by openly charg-
ing the returning board with an intention to
commit infamous frauds, and we presume that
if they find the Republicans reluctant to stul-
tify themselves by sending an amateur joint
committee they will divert their vile charges
and dishonest insnuations against the whole
Republican party. We are quite certain that
there is no stretch Of insolence beyond their
reach, and we only hope that the prominent
Republicans who have made the mistake of
BOiLS ~ pEcccuCC hdb
not at all wanted will hare the sense to see
that any assumption by them of an official or
representative character will merely expose
them to ridicule.


There need be no mistake as to which body
is authorized TO count the vote of Louisiana
nor need there be any mistake as to how the
vote of Louisiana is to be counted by the only
body appointed by law for that purpose.
There is no room for a legal argument, or for
a Constitutional question. The law says
clearly that the returning board shall hear
testimony and arguments relating to the votes
which they are TO canvass; it gives them full
authority to set aside results which represent
intimidation, armed resistance, bribery, cor
ruption or improper influences of any kind.
We think that the power conferred on them
is excessive, and even dangerous, but we do
not propose to substitute lynch law in its
stead, and we ask our readers to remember
that, if this power is exceptional, the circum-
stances which called it into existence are ex-
ceptional, and it is probably as good q way as
could be found Of correcting that subversion
of law which has marked the election in the
South. But be 1t as it may, we must be
prepared to accept the decision of the legal
authorities, and we advise the other body, the
distinguished citizens who are cooling their
heels outside of the Office of the returning
board, to constitute themselves into a return
ing board by returning home, that, like
Polonius, they may play the fool nowhere but
in their own house."

Yesterday morning ct the usual hour for
going to work about eighty new men, to-
9ether with al the old ones, assembled ct
the basin ready for work. The men EN-
ploysd for the past week gave up their posi-.
tjons rather reluctantly because they thought
they were entitled TO another days work to
make the full week. But when informed
that the pay roll had been made up and
they must make room for others, they
layed down the pick and the shovel. Some
fingered around for anhour or 10 thinking
they might be taken to supply the vacan-
cies, which were about ten In number, but
these will be filled by new recruits.


The same bosses remain, ~ > change In
those positions would not be advantageous.
About 20 colored men are at work.

Of which belong to Thomas Ford, and ten

The 10th day of March was the coolest
day experienced in the Black Hills dur
ing the entire winter. The mercury was
down to twenty below zero, and was
still sinking, while the snow rolled down
in binding, eddying clouds, rendering
life out of doors almost impossible.
The unfortunates who were encamped
in and about neighboring gulches hocked
into the dark, cheerless cabins and hud-
died together in shivering groups about
the pitch or pine fires, kept up for the
free accommodation of all who might
seek warmth and shelter within doors.
At least thirty men had congregated in
the most prominent store, the largest and
best in Custer. The mud floor was rem
dered muddier by the thawing of the ice
and snow which dripped in small streams
from the rough wrappings of the cosmo-
politan assemblage.


The store is deserted military bar
racks, a large, low, barn.like affair, con-
tanning beds, blacksmith's forge, carpen-
ter's bench, bar-room, grocery and no.
ton store, and reporters desk. The CEN
ter of attraction was the bar, which was
being literally patronized by the shiver-
ing crowd.


A party of young men from Salt Lake
and the mines of Nevada came rushing
into the store, and, with loud, boisterous
braggadocia, took possession of the bar.
Ranging themselves in row in its front,
they called for ""sOme o. that ar licker.""
Round after round of whisky was poured
down, and still they stood and talked,
and swore and laughed. They had just
arrived from Cheyenne after twenty
days voyage, and were about to sepa-
rate and each 60 his own way, some to the
north, some to the south, and others to
remain; and this was the farewell drunk.
For fully two hours they stood before
the. bar, pouring down whisky, and
about / o'clock started for the door, where
their teams stood shivering in the storm.


Alexander Shaw and Tom Milligan
were partners, both from Salt Lake, both
young, rough, but affectionate friends,
Just on the point of shaking hands before
parting. They reached the door and
rushed forth, shouting and yelling like
his revolver and fired in the air.


Fire higher, Tom, or you'll hit some
of us"" said companion.


Too late! the pistol was again raised
again by the reeling man. There was a
flash, report and Aleck Shaw reeled
across the threshold of the door.


""Good God Tom what have you
done? Did you shoot Aleck ?"" said one
of the party.


""No, he's only possuming, boys"" an
swered Shaw. '""Get up, Aleck, and take
drink""


The reckless shooter staggered to the
PROSTATE form which lay upon its face,
and seizing him by the coat collar, turned
it over. A CHASTITY, sickening sight was
presented to view. The pale face was
striped with blood, which Oozed out of a
small hole in the forehead. The bullet
had pierced through the brain, and had
lodged beneath the skull upon the back
of the head. For amoment the drunken
man stared down into his friends bloody
face, then his countenance assumed a
deadly pallor, his eyes became fixed with
horror. He was sobered. Turning
round to his Mortified companions. he
said-as he threw his pistol down |:
Boys, didn't 90 to do it. I'll swear
/ didn't mean to kill him."" then, burst
ing into tears, he clasped his hands TO
his face and stood sobbing like a child.
""He was the best friend had in the
world, boys; and l loved him like a
brother. Oh, God, what have / done /!
What have / doneT""


""Lets hang him."" suggested some
excitable individual, behind the half
sobered group Of Salt Lake men.


""No, no! None O. that ere business
Just yet in Custer. The man must have
a trial."" said a citizen, coolly, as he
drew his revolver.


""I arrest, you, sir, in the name of the
citizens of Custer"" said Pete Mckay,
the merchant, and Milligan stood meekly
awaiting the grasp of the law.


""Who'll dare to arrest him ?"" said
one of the drunken Salt Lakers. ""You
let go of him, you Pete Mckay. You've
got no legal authority to arrest him, SO
jest take your claws off him. or Pll-'


""This is my authority"" said Pete
Mckay, drawing his pistol. 81 am q
citizen of Custer, and intend to turn this
man over to the City Marshal. Who
dares to interfereT'


mo one % answered one or two of the
by-standers, and half dozen pistols
flashed from their scabbards, and for sew.
eral minutes there was an ominous silence
in the group. 1t was fine tableau.
There lay the victim of drunken ruff
fans recklessness, the brains slowly
oozing from the hole in the forehead
Over him stood the sObered ruffian, pale
and paralyzed with horror, while pistol
in hand stood the merchant grasping the
shoulder of the submissive Milligan
behind him dozen or more miners
hunters and emigrants, silently support
ing the stern, determined merchant
while opposite them were ranged the
Salt Lake party, irresolute and surprised
1t was critical period in the history o
Custer. A shot from either side woulC
have resulted in terrible slaughter
The least attempt to rescue Milligar
would have brought forth volley from
the citizens, and then Judge Lynch woult
have been called in to finish up the bust
ness.


Marshal Burroughs soon arrived ant
took charge of the prisoner. A jury
was at once impaneled, and frontie
trial commenced in little log cabin, tn,

Again the prisoner spoke


""Am ! to be kept out here while the
trial for my life is going on inside?'


""Yss, you just are"" answered Vance.


The first thing Tom Vance did was to
step behind the bar Of the Eldoralo and
say:

testified to the horse being the property OF

at Virginia City. The case WAS given to
the jury, and, after a few moments deliber-
alton, they returned the verdict:


""Guilty

""GentIemen, before passing sentence we
will drink to the jury


, The very good health of the jury was


drunk. The Court resumed the bench,
and pronounced:


""The verdict of this Court is that the

the burying ground an stretched""
There was rush for the door, and while
: some ran across lets to the cemetery; others


guarded the prisoner on his way to execu-
ton. Tom Vance walked behind the pris-


oner on the black horse, and, as he did so,


he remarked to his barkeeper, who had


closed theEldorado, to be in at the death ;


This beats circus or horse-trot, this
does, an is just as good as cock-hght A

The committee drove the black horse
under the limb of tree, from which dan
gled the moose.

Judge and executoner. :,
The prisoner balanced himself as well
As he could on the saddle, the nosse was
placed about his neck, the Judge said :
""Iif you have got any last words to say

""Hod on hold on""


1t wa, a prolonged scream at the top OF

held the black horse by the bits. The pris

INFANT MORTALITY.


Tho distressing increase OF the infant death rate
during the heated period Of the last fortnight has
created deal OF xicy and ALARM and especially
In those lower wards where the ravsgcs have been
most fatal Many are unable TO understand why The
death rate should be greater among young children
than among adults, and many causes have been
assigned which in reality have bearing at all upon
the Professor }. Adler physician OF large ex-
perence IN tho treatment OF uantile complaints, yes
terday favored HKxALp reporter with his views upon
the subject Sunstroke in itself, he said, was
a common TO adults as children, though II
affected them in different degrees; but tnc in
creasng death rate among the latter was ue to the com
brcc effects of the heat bad ventilation and improper
food Many deaths were ascrbcd to tho effects OF heat
wuich actually the result OF neglect careessness
ignorance on the part OF the parents The extra
heat OF tho atmosphere prevents the body from giving
out It's heat IN natural course. Thus impurities arc
not allowed escapo the system, tho circulation be
irregular and catarrh OF the stomach and bowels
condition tho sevcreness OF the disease is increased
Sometimes this catarrh condition extends throughout
the intestinal tract digestion prevented, the
body becomes weaker through loss OF blood and ex-
haustion and death cnsucs- This is stated by
the Professor TO be tho usual manner In
which Infants affected by this disease
or course many vary but In general the neglect
OF the digestive organs IL the main cause Of The IN
creased mortality The irregular circulation OF the
blood should be neutralzed by proper feeding, or the
least mistake liable to bring on the fatal bowel com
paint Drinking, TOO. OF unsuitable liquids at i'm
proper times did its fatal share. Bad ventilation In
tenement also greatly assists the evil Tho Pro-
fossor that Of tho lower districts Of tho
arc absolutely poisonous in their effects The streets
themselves are improperly cleaned and DIS
miectant sare not used As an instance In TINS
respect he states that Sunday morning before
tho Fourth he saw three policemen Kill dog, sup
posed to be mad upon the corner Of broadway and
Thirty fourth street Twenty four hours later the body
the animal still lying in the street The season
has gone far enough for arriving at any approxi-
mate estimate Of the total death among children
as compared with former years. but the Professor
offers his opinion that II the heat should continue
the increasc oi mortality will be alarming He recon-
general prcvenatves increased facilities for
public baths, a better distribution OF information
among the ignorant classes upon the laws OF esting
drinking and digestion, and urges particularly more
attention the dsinecton and cleaning OF the streets


OUR WATER SUPPLY.


Commissioner Of Public Works Allan Campbell yes
terday gave HERALD reporter the following opinions
and views as TO the effect OF the prolonged drought on
his department.


The volume of the Croton river Is very much re-
duced and we drawing from artificial reservoirs
in Putnam county but we are always compelled 10 do
that IN summer. The aQueduct is filled aud is drawing
all tho water II has capacity for Our distributing
has fallen about one foot IN the last month
That shows We are distributing more water than wo
are receiving or course, the extra consumption OF
in summer by such means as street sprinklng,
gutter washing, tho playing OF fountains, the cxtraor
dinary amount used in washing, &C.. calls Tor much
larger supply than any other season. But that no
new stale OF things good fall Of rain in
the Croon Valley would save US from drawing from
our artlfciaI sources in Putnam county; but havo
such superabundancc there that, as yet, We run no
danger from the want OF ram.


Our real trouble Is with our aqucduct. Il Is too
small This city 100, 600 900 gallons day. which
equal to the consumption OF London This can be
and should be greatly iessened- The people OF New
York should not waste much II is impossible
10 build aqueduct at present on account oil tho
scarcely OF money. do all can to save it. For in
stance requested the Park Commissioners 10 shut OF
she fountains IN the parks between nine O'Clock In the
evening and morning, which they immediately COM
plied with. have several times, through The press,
requests TO the people 10 exercise more care; but
II is delicate thing keep on asking 1t in matter
which Is closely related to cleanliness especially
among the inhabitants OF tenement houses do not
ask anybody stint himself but TO only what he
really needs, and be certain that none goes 10 waste
II this done think our present aqueduct would
provide amply Tor all the water which The city wants
In conversation with one Of tho employees
OF the superintendent OF Water works
ofnce a HERALD reporter learned that the
story circulated about decrease OF water IN the
reservoir Is uniouRded This gentleman said that dur
inv tae summer season. when rains inrequent the
condition OF Croton Lake and the mains 1t supplies
seem 10 give great deal OF concern 10 people un-
acquainted with the resources of the water works.
Inquiries about the precise number OF gallons OF water
ready for distribution are received, and alarmisis
arc always found ready to exagrae stories about the
lake having dried up the water pipes being choked
aud then circulate them about the city. THE heat OF





water works man. 'shss not affected tho water supply
TO any appreciable extent IL may have fallen about
half inch in the reservoir, but that Is ALL and It is
entirely early to indulge any anticpations OF Sc
rous failure or The supply Croton Lake has not been
much Affected by the drought and the number Of
small springs that run into II are apt to be dried up
ony in cases OF extreme protractcd drought beyond
anything like a probable period""


The reporter asked IL such had never happened


Oh yes was the reply ""in 1868 We had considerable
trouble with the water There was no rain Tor a long
time and It's absence began to tell upon the supply in

of II court room in Hopkinsville, Ky,
with her thild husband, after jury had
failed to convict her of numbering her
second husband. The people were not
satisfied, however, aud every night her
house is guarded against lynchers. She
was n beautiful widow, and had two offers
Of marriage. One was from young Gal
bIaith, who was poor, and tho other was
from old Mr., Wolf, who was rich. Sue
accepted Wolf, avowedly because she
loved his money, and two months after

his property she married Galbraith. The

DETAILS OF The ABBEvILLE CoNsPIRACY


CHARLEsroN, s. c., Dec. 11.-Sixteer
negroes were arrested in Abbeville county
charged with the murder of two white mel
whom they ambushed and shot near
Lowndesville, on Monday.


Six of the negroes made full confession
duplicating their fellow prisoners, and d.
vulging plot for the murder of the white
men of the village and capture Of the wo'
men. Twenty of them were in the conspir-
acy, and they had begun the butchery BY
slaughtering the two white men.


OF the sixteen srresOed, thirteen were
started from Lowndesville to Anderson, the
intention being to send them from Anderson
to Abbeville by railroad. This roundabout
course was adopted to avoid lynching by
men who were said to be on the direct ROAD
from Lowndesville to Abbeville.


The prisoners started from Anderson on
Saturday under . strong guard, but up to
last evening have not been heard from. 1t
is rumored that they have been intercepted
and lynched by party from Georgia, but
no confirmation of the report hes yet reach
ed Charleston.


Two of the prisoners had been hurt when
captured, and the party may have stopped
on the road to ease the wounded, especially
az the weather has been 10 cold."

the third reading, it was agreed to. Yeas,
""a; nays, IS. The senate, by a vote Of yeas
""a to nays 12, ordered that the joint rcsolu.
ton be read the third time at o'clock to-
morrow. The senate receded from its dsa.
greement to the amendments of the house
bill to punish counterfeiting of trademark
goods and to prohibit dealing in such goods.
The amendments of the house were agreed
to and the bill passed. Then senate went
into executive session and soon adjourned


uOUAE.


In the house, on the 9th, Mr.. Bland's
silver bill was taken up on the regular or.
der. The morning hour having expired, the
bill went over without action. Mr.. Cox
chairman of the committee on banking and
currency, reported bill TO repeal section 8
of the resumption act of January IA, 1878,
which directs the secretary of the treasury
10 redeem in coin the legal tender note
then outstanding, and proposed TO allow an
hour and q half for its discussion and like
time for the discussion OF q further bill
which he was directed to report, providing
for commission on the subject He would
decline, however, to allow amendments TO
be offered. lie opened the argument by
declaring his belief that the fixing of day
for resumption was hopeless menace 70
prosperity; that it effected no good, and that
il was utterly useless for all practical puf


poses. The best business men of the coun.
try had said so, and said SO to his committee.
The bill which IT was proposed to repeal in
part had passed congress as party neces-
sty; under the whip and spur of the previ-
Gus question. Mr.. Goode, of the banking
committee, advocated to repeal. Mr.. Hew.
lit asked Mr.. Cox to let him offer as substi-
tute bill providing for committee on the
subject After some time wasted in call Of
house, Cox allowed Hewitt's proposition to
be offered as substitute, aud the previous
question was seconded without objection.


The vote was then taken on Hewitt's sub
stitute, which provides for commission of
three senators, three members of the house,
and three experts TO be selected by and as
sociated with senators and members to con-
slider what measures are necessary and prac-
ticable in order to bring about resumption
of specie payment, at the earliest possible
time consistent with due regard TO the inter-
ests of the country, and TO report bill en-
bodying results OF its investigation on or
| before the 18th Of December, 1876. Finally
| the vote was announced, as .-eas, 90; nays,
| iOi; so the substitute was rejected. The


vote was then taken on the bill reported by
Mr. Cox from the committee on banking
and currency, it was passed yeas, 1906;

All our readers are or should be interested
in the question of Capital Punishment If it
be necessary for the peace and happiness and
safety of society, at least in eases OF mortal
felony, it Is vitally necessary. The room for Il
compromise is exceedingly narrow. If the pun
ishmcnt be desirable, or if it be demanded by
the fundamental principles of Jurisprudence,
all weak dalying is DISASTROUS all morbid SYM
pathy childish, and all efforts to keep the law
on the statute book without enforcing 1t are
discrcditable to the human intellect. Again,
if the experiment of abolition is to be
tried, the least which we can demand
is an accurate statement of results, or
OF the absence of results which can be legiti-
matcly regarded. as conclusive. -Four years
ag0 the extreme penalty was abolished III Iowa.
Vigorous attempts have been made from time
to time 30 restore it recently these have been
multiplied, and a direct influence brought TO
bear upon the Legislature; and it has been
distinctly asserted that one result of the repeal
has been great increase in crimes Of a cap
ital character in the State. We confess that
we were ourselves under Such an impression.
We would therefore specially call the attention
of the reader to the letter of Mr.. Bovee,
which we publish this morning. The writer
has given great attention to the subject, and
occupies a prominent and honorable position
among the opponents of the gallOws.


1t will be observed that Mr.. Boyee denies
that murder in the first degree has increased
in Iowa during these four years Of experiment; ;
and he quotes the authority of Senator Jessup
for the exactly opposite fact, that murder in
the first degree has decreased since the abo-
lition. Again, other crimes Grape, for lnstance)
have increased in number, and this increase is
of offenses which were never punishable by
death.


A very important question is whether the
absence of a legal death penalty in Iowa has
intensified mob violence there. Mr. Bovee
meets this by pointing to the prevalence of
Lynch law in other States III which capital
punishment is still maintained. He cannot
conclude, we are sorry to say, without speak
ing a little sharply of ""theologians"" "" who STILL
upon religious grounds, advocate the restOra-
ton of the old law. Mr.. Bcyee should re-
member that it is quite possible for a cOnsci-
cntious man to accept the ancient doctrine
upon this point as of Divine authority There
is nothing absurd in it, and really nothing
opposed TO the very highest and most rational
benevolence In this respect, capital punish
ment stands upon the same footing with war,
which ia undoubtedly forbidden by any literal
and narrow Interpretation of texts. Th"" So"

dent Lichtenstein in the chair.


A bill of $1,330.52 due Butcher Il Merch-
ant, was passed, and $400 ordered to be

balance was laid over Mr. Febiger stated
that an invitation had been received from
the Board of Health asking the Water
Committee to meet with the Committee of
the Board on Impurities of the Brandywine.
1t met but did not see what Council could
do, as there was State law to govern all
water courses which supply water for cities
motion by Mr.. Febiger referring the
Board of Health to the State law was
adopted.


A favorable report to lower the water
pipes on Clayton Street, was adopted. Esti-
mated cost $50.


The Engrossment Committee reported all
ordinances recently passed properly en-
crossed.


The City Treasurer reported to the credit
of Cool Spring Reservoir, $7759; to Current
Expenses, $3241.59; to redemption of
bonds, $500, total $4020.1S.


Edward McIntire, Water Registrar, report

and the Chief Engineer Of the Water De-
partment reported 16 men and cart en-
ployed.


Mr.. Febiger reported bills Of the Water
Department unpaid amounting to $2424.24,
and that $4,000 will be equired to meet the
expenses of the fiscal year.


MIR. Baker presented a petition to have
Jackson Street between Gilpin and Lover
ing Avenue graded; and the curbing set and
sidewalks paved from Gilpin to Shallcross.


Mr.. Febiger presented petition to have
two oil lamps at Eighteenth and Tatnal
Streets.


The following nay rolls wers presentei
and passed Water, S184; Street, $572.04
Police, s1708.25; Miscellaneous, $1447. As
Mr.. Underwood presented the following
proposals for finishing the grading of Wal
nut street, from Front to Third;
| T. q. Cook, 40c. per yd., or 300 for job
Patrick Carberry, $97 for job; James Nc
Nutty, 1870. per yd. Thomas Ford, Sic

On motion of Mr.. Underwood the con

A resolution offered by MIR. Pickels wa
adopted, nstructing the Clerk to ascertain
the amount of different bills collected TO

A second resolution by Mr.. Pickels in
structing the Lamp Committee to repor

Mr.. Febiger called up for final readin
the ordinance to amend an ordinance, re
organizing the Fire Department. (lhis OF
dinauce restores the salary of the Chic
Engineer of the Water Department t
$500. and reduces that of the Water Reg
istrar from $1,000 to 5000. The ordinanc
passed last April to reduce the salary OF tn
Chief Engineer to $1,000 never went int
effect.)


AIr. Lynch, in opposing the passage of til
ordinance, said this did not agree with til
argument OF the majority of Council
passing an ordinance two weeks ago reduC
ing the wages of the laboring man, and
knew of over 80 competent men in this cit

70 the Edftor o. The Tribune


SIR: Your New-Haven correspondent 3D."" who
favored us in The TRIBUNE of the 2d inst with
very valuable disquistion upon the heinous crime
of tamperng with the free exercise Of the ballot has
little or nothing to say in regard to the evidence
daily disclosing the Louisiana Democratic practice
in that regard, but confines his lamentation to the
decaying morality of the Republicans of that State
and assumes broadly that the Returning Board now
canvassing the returns in compliance with law, are
set of unprincipled knaves, at whose hands no
honest verdict can be expected. Your correspond
ent says;


I there no danger of fraudulent transactions by the
louisiana Returning Boardi II suspicious oi the
honesty of the persons composing that lenaIkaoie t
bnnsl learned my distrust from TIE TRIBUNE, which,
time after time during the past four years has de-
nouneed them as the most uAo cor4uP' so
Of seamps that ever held Office.


His expression time after time during the past
four years. shows that he has fallen into the very
common error Of cOnfoundng the present board with
the ono that canvassed the election of 1872 IL Lou
isiana. The TRIBUNE itself has not been exactly
free from the same error In reverting TO the history
of the board of 1872 it well to remember how its
action was viewed by the Senate Committee, which
in its report said.-


Though cannot approve OF such a canvass as
that mace by the Lynch Board who seem 70 have acted
upon tie principle of fighting the devil with fire. ana
Eelloggs government was elected, nevertheless be-
lieye that KellOggs government was defeated ana inc
popular reversed by the fraudulent manipulation OF
Inc election.


That is tho only censure that the board Of 1879
met at the hands of the committee. 1t and the law
creating it have gone out Of existence Are its SINS
if any. be visited upon its successor the present
boardf ""B"" evidently thinks so, for he says:

""B'sD ethics might make him an exceedingly up
right judge-they certainly could not be relied upon
to insure his impartality. His wholesale cOndcmna-
ton of the present board is nhmanly cruel UNJUST
to them unjust to the Republican name, and utterly
at variance with the facts. The majority OF the pres
ent Returning Board was elected by the Louisiana
State Senate in 1874. One member has in the mean
time been chosen to fill a vacancy and one vacancy
still exists They exercised their functions for the
first time in the State election of that year. No
member of the board of to-day on the board Of
1872. Their action in 1874 subjected to the
Investigation of committee of the U. S. House of
Representatives-a body that in the court of public
opinion subject alone to the revsOry authority OF
the people. The Returning Board of Louisiana was
less fortunate in that respect-their action re-
yised by au assumed higher authority this commit
tee who in passing judgment upon their acts did,
as is done constantly every day by revisory
courts reverse the judgment of the court below.
But this was done in unkind terms III ""B."" is
familiar with the case he assumes to treat Of his
audacity IN SAYING that ""these men have cheated
before smaoks more OF the inimcal partisan than
of the outraged virtue Of the well-wsher of his
party affiliations His misstatement should perhaps
be aseIibed to his ignorance. The haTshest ex-
preston used by the Marshall branch of the
committee of 1875 in regard to this board was that
their action was unjust, illegal, and arbitrary -
and tins by men abundantly Supplied with a vOcab-
ulary of political denuncatOn. ""B.s"" ready use Of
the words fraud and cheat"" found no sanction in
the minds of that committee.


There was another branch--the' Republican--of





and Frye, who, in dissenting from the proceedings
of the board, said:


The Returning Board claims that IN this proceeding
they acted under an honest belief that they right
in their construction of the law, and that they were
giving effect the true Will OF the majority OF the peO
Die Of louisiana and that in their construction they
followed the precedent set by the Democratic Fusion

The kind of law and order that would
reign in South Carolina if Wade Hampton
was Governor is amply illustrated by the
accounts of the lynching of dozen ne
groes at LowndesviIle few days since
without any show of trial Such barbara
ties only go to show that the reign of the
rifle club element is now supreme, and
that it is 8 'treign of terror"" They ex-
coed in horror the Turkish atrocities in
Bulgaria by the difference between our
civilization and that of the Bashi Bazouks.
IF the butcheries of the latter in Bulgaria
warranted the interference of all the Great
Powers of Europe, how much the more
would the same Powers be justified in en-
tering protest against the Government of
the United States for allowing the con-
tinued massacre of its Christian citizens in
the Southern States without interference
for the arrest and punishment of the per-
petrators7 If General Wade Hampton
possesses the influence he processes to be
sble to exercise over the rifle clubs of
South Carolina, he and his associates can
put 3 stop to these wholesale murders.
That they do not do so, shows either that
they do not possess the power they so con-
fdertly boast, or that the atrocities are
committed with their connivsnce at least,
if not by their direction. The lynching of
these negroes without trial by mob of
whites shows the correctness OF the
Presidents judgment in refusing to with
draw the regular troops from that
State. He justly observed that it was only
the presence of the troops there which
prevented a wholesale slaughter in Colum-
bia 1t is time that the people and Con-
gress should look this matter of prevailing
iawlessness at the South squarely in the
face, and decide between 9 reign of terror
there and governments which are repub-
lican in form"" If those States are now in
the enjoyment of republican form of gov
eminent, it must be clear to the minds of
all that they are only form. The execu-
tion of law is mere sham, mockery.
There is no pretense even, 30 far as we
can learn, of the arrest and trial of white
men for breach of the peace"" for muir
der, lynching, whipping, assault and bat
terry, rape and assassination when these
crimes are committed upon negroes and
their families who refuse to vote the Demo
cratic ticket. The rifle clubs will not per-
NIT the arrest and trial of their members
on such charges. Or, if they do, the whole
club will attend the trial in body, fully
armed, and remain there as q standing
menace to court and jury that the verdict
must be one Of acquittal or justification.


We beg to say to the Democratic party,
North and South, that it cannot afford to
stand the sponsor of such mocksries, al
though they may be committed in the
names of Liberty and Reform"" We say
still further to Southern Democrats that, in
our opinion, they are now sowing the
wind to an extent that will soon result In
q large harvest of whlrlwInds if the hand
of the assassin is not speedily stayed in
their midst. 1t is said that even a worm
will at last turn upon its torturer. And it
is beyond all reason to suppose that the
initiative negro will not ere long, should
these expressions and crimes against them
be continued, begin course of retaliation
upon the whites t. hat is fearful to contem-
plate.


Since writing the foregoing Charleston
telegram has been received which imputes
the charge of conspiracy for retaliation to
the victims of these lynchers. If this
should prove true, and it needs confrma-
ton, that fact only goes to show the cor
Tectness of our impressions that such action
must in the very nature of the case result
from the course which the rife clubs have
been pursuing for several years past under
various names and disguises. 1t Is the
legitimate frait Of the Ku-Kluxing, the
White Line and rife club riding and
whippings, the bull doing and the shot
gun policy of the whites. God grant that
the latter may now open their eyes and
stay their barbarous and murderous hands
before it is too late! We, in common with
all Christendom, shrink IN horror from the
contemplation of war of races in this
country. And all the more because there
is not the slightest necessity or excuse in
reason, right or justice for any such war.
All the freedman asks is the free enjoy
ment Of those rights and privileges of citi-
zenship which are guaranteed to him by
the Constitution. Can the Democracy of
the South or North afford to deny him
these in the name of reform and liberty?
Can it sfford to hazard with him war of
races, which in the South would be tanta-
mount to one of determination, aud sacri-
fee by the same act his labor, rather than
deal Justly by hlm2 The plain question
to which the Democratic party must soon
give categorical answer to the people ef
the country is, whether it will or will not
scrupulously recognize and obey IN letter
and spirit the thirteenth, fourteenth and
fifteenth amendments to the Constitution
of the United States2 Promises, made in
resolutions only to be broken in practice,
will no longer avail. Hereafter, actions
must speak. The people will hold the
leaders to a rigid accountability. If an
affirmative answer is intended, it must be
shown by cessation of lynchings, bull
dozings and assassinations, and the accord
ance to the negroes of their legal and con-
stitutional rights and privileges. Intimi-
dations, threats and menaces for political
effect must also cease. The alternative,
we cannot and will not now attempt to
depict. We prefer to leave this to the
fervid imagination of the reader.

[From the Times, March 4th.",,"+ Among the prominent arrivals at
the Bella Union Hotel yesterday was
Mr.. c. Delano, ex-Secretary of the In
terror, and lady, of Washington City,
ID. G.


Next week Mr.. E. J. Davis, of Riv-
erside, will commence the erection of
a store at that place for parties from
Los Angeles. 1t will be of brick, 3Ox7O
feet and two stories high.


Quite an excitement was created at
Halls Camp a short time since over y
lynching affair. 1t appears that q
man was strongly suspected of steal.
ing certain articles but the proof not
being sufficient to warrant legal pro-
ceedings it was determined to extort
confession of theft from the party.
He was therefore taken to = tree, q
moose placed about his neck and was
then hung. The experiment was re-
peated half dozen times, but the fell
low wouldn't confess worth cent, SO
they turned him loose. This seems
rather peculiar manner of treating
thieves and doubtless has its merits in
some cases.


Through the courtesy Of Mr.. ID. See-
ly we had the pleasure of perusing
letter from Edward Petit, of Salt
Lake, concerning the discovery of ex.
ceedingly rich silver leads near st.
George in Southern Utah. One lead
has been located for six miles in
length and the cropping assay from
$500 to $l,750 per ton. Large quanti-
ties have been shipped to Salt Lake.
He also states of what is of more in
terest to us, that the probabilities are
very favorable for the Utah southern
Railroad being pushed forward as rap
idly as possible to st. George as soon
as Spring opens, in consequence Of
these discoveries. If this should be
done it will not be very long before
Utah will be shipping her stores of
wealth through our valley to the
coast.

evidence that has appeared on the
subject, has coversed with Repub-
licans both white and black who
were in or near Hamburg at the
time of the massacre, and that
their conclusions against Butler are
arc not supported by testimony
which would not be. instantly con-
sumed to ashes under the rays OF
judicial test"" The Judge then
states in less judicial, perhaps, but
more matter-of-fact Language, that
General Buffers house was burnt
last year by negroes; that his be-
ing engaged in fight with a body
of them at that time was as con-
stables posse to effect the arrest
OF the incendiaries under the au-
thority of a negro trial justice; that
on his being hImse'f arrested for
that act he and his friends went
at once peaceably to Judge
Mackay's court and were acquitt-
ed; that he collected a force oflaw-
abiding white Democrrts to defend
from a mob oflynchers the Jail in
which the destroyer of his own
house was confined, and The judge
asks if the man who acted thus
under severe provocation could
have taken part in the Hamburg
butchery unprovoked as he was
either by injury or insult."

case. He complained of Fisher to the President
and on strictly public grounds demanded his re-

General Pieuepont, and the reasons they presented
were of such character that the President could not
ignore them. Ex-Gov. Shepherd appeared as the
champion of District-Attorney Fisher, and at one

competence for the position, and for this and
other reasons sufficient in themselves, he was
removed. Subsequently the criminal operations OF
Hines and Kettle were discovered, and were fol-

party and of other crimes of similar nature
have been filed in tie Post-Oiiino Department; br'
Postmastcr-General Jewell. after thorough invcs-
tigaton OF the case has held that sufficient cause
for Wickersham's removal has been shown, and has
therefore refused to compy with SpenceT's request.
Another of PostmasteT-General Jewels enemies Is
Senator Conking, and the reason for his opposition
has already been referred TO- Special Agent Morton,
who was removed on the 1't of July, was Mr. Coak-
lng's apDcntee, and had been engaged exclusively
i'm setting I'D conventions in Mr.. Conllings interest
in virginia. Col Nosby OF Virginia, who Is
one Of the most influential men in Gen.
Grants administration, is another of those who
have d,sapprOvcd of the manner in which Post
master General Jewell has managed his department.
One ca .sc OF his opposiOnwas the removal oi Capt
Chap an, who served as a bushwackcr under
Mosbv during the Rebellion and vino, on his recon-
mcndatop was appointed to be route agent between
this city ard Lynchburg. Chapman was remoyedto
mako place for Bradley, gallant Union soldier
formerly employed i'll the pos-oice OF the House ol
REPRESENTATIVES but displaced on the assembling Of
the Democratic House. Mosby demanded that his
ex- Confederate friend Chapman shoud be replaced,
but in the mean time evidence had been
shown to the Postmaster General conclu-
siycly proving that during the war Chapman
had been engaged in sort OF black-iiag crusade
against the Union forces, and that be had been
guilty of great barbary i'll the treatment OF prison
ers who fell into his hands. Mr.. jewell therefore
refused to Teiusjatc him. wEcreupon Mosby went To
the White House and obtained ""a PeTemptory order
from the President. This order remained Ia the
Post Office Department for several days or weeks
before il was executed, but finally Capt. Chapman
was reinstated and still holds his place.


From these facts it will be seen that Gov. Jewell
BY his administration of the P0s-Oficc Department
had incurred the ehmity Of several of Gen. Grants
most intimate and influential friends, and that when
the political exigcncy arose the Presidents mind
had been prepared for this change.


The unanimous verdict Of those who have been
most familiar with Gov. JEWELS administration of
the Post-Olicc Department Is that its business has
been conducted as far was possible on strictly
business principles. The late Postmaster-Generll
leaves the Department with fewer rings
in and about it than he found there.
Attorneys and claim agents have been banished, and
those who have business with the Department, OF
claims against it, have been shown that nothing was
to be gained by the employment of professional De
partment lawyers. Their business has been just as
promptly attended to when presented by Themselves
""a when they have employed persons supposed to be
possessed of influence. Straw bidding has, through
Cow JEWELS efforts, been i'll a great measure broken
mn MANY dishonest officials have been removed,
and it is reported at the Department that the last
drunken clerk was discharged few weeks ago. While
these many reforms have been effected III the De
parfmcnt under Gov. JEWELS administration,
Numerous improvements in the postal service have
been introduced, which have greatly increased it,
efficiency and usefulness to the people. Many OF
these will be recalled without being mentioned.
Among them are the establishment of the fast mail
trains and the extension of the railway postal sys-"

morning the most abominable and inferna


racket that ever saluted mortal ears was KEEP


up. The tin horn brigade was out in full


force and with the aid Of squeaking fife ant


some kettle drums made more and more dis


agreeable noise than all other things com


bined Some two or three anvils were car


ried into the Square"" and utilized as cali


non, and these with pistols, guns, fire-crack


ers, rockets, tin horns, shouting and yelling


men and boys made the night as hideous as g


loosened pandemonium. Nobody slept and


everybody rejoiced that the span of human


life is not long enough to stretch over two


centennials. One such as this one is decid-
edIy enough, with some to spare. Among
the attractions of the night was huge bon


fire made of dry goods boxes and coal oil
barrels in the centre of the square which illu-
minated the town and caused the people who
lived in that vicinity to tremble and quake
with fear for the safety Of their houses Inn
Thus was spent the night before. The day
ITSELF Tuesday, was given up to the boys
with horns, FIRE crackers, torpedoes, muskets,
shot guns, pistols, &c. Among other things
they had wee bit of cannon, about six
inches long, and when heavily loaded the
nasty little thing would make report almost
as loud as six FOUNDER.


BLOWING OUT A PEDLAR.


One of the best things the boys did with
their horns was to blow out a yankee notion
vender. This fellow, who belonged to that
tribe of wandering pedlars who almost in
variably swindle all who invest in their wares,
had stationed himself upon box with big
torch in front of him and was having good
time to himself making funny (?) speeches
and selling little things to cut glass With, &C.,
but in an unlucky moment, he addressed a
very illnatured remark to boy with horn,
ordering him to 60 away from there. The
boy went, but in a few minutes came back
with the whole gang, and for while that
fellow heard more blowing than he ever heard
before in his life. For moment or two they
would slacken and he d start again only to
be saluted with the same din much to the
amusement of the lookers-on who seemed,
generally, to think that the horns had done
a good thing for once. Finally the fellow
packed up and quit and left in disgust.


FLAGS AND DECORATIONS.


Quite neat display of flags was made by
the stores and other business places though
business was suspended. E. B. Rice decorated
the front of his confectionery store and ice
cream saloon with profusi0n of small flags,
among them thirteen with the names of the
original colonies printed thereon. The trim
ming was very tasty and pretty. Messrs.
Eliason & Benson and w. T. Foster had also
fine display of flags and other trimmings.
Two big flags streamer and host Of little
flags foated from the cupola of the town hall.
neat pole was erected on the TRANSCRIPT
office and an eight-foot flag was run up on
halyards trimmed with small flags. Several
private residences were also prettily decorated
with the national ensign.


In the evening an nexceedinglywelcomes storm
accompanied by heavy rain blew up which



of guns and crackers and gave the wearied
citizens an opportunity to sleep, Of which
they were not slow to take advantage, losing
the brilliant and pretty sight of a quantity Of
rockets, roman candles and other fireworks
which Mr.. Rice set off after the rain was over,
and this wound up the Fourth.


AN OUTRAGEOUS ASSAULT.
The Notorious Whitlocks Again.


An exciting trial was held at the Office Of
Esq. Walker, on Wednesday which, hot as the
day was, was attended by large crowd Of
interested spectators.


The following is statement of the facts in
the case, as near at least as our reporter could
ascertain them from the evidence ELECTED at
the trial On Monday last number of per-
sons from Middletown went over to Odessa to
attend the ""Pole Raising"" among whom were
the parties to this affair. While there, it
seems that one of the Whitlocks, the notorious
John, who was tried at New Castle at the last
November term of court for the murder of
negro man in his grog shop in this place, was
detected in the act Of unbuckling the reins
from the bride bit Of Thomas Murray's horse
the lynch-pins having been already removed
from the wheels of the carriage to which the
horse was attached. A young man, named
Hayes, who saw Whitlock unfastening the
reins, reproved him in language merited by
thesdeed, saying that it was Every mean act
of which no one but low, mean scoundrel
would be guilty"" On the strength of this
Whitlock attacked Hayes and Edward Thomas
attempted to defend the latter from his assault
as he (Hayes) is slight built young man and
unable physically to cope with Whitlock, and
stepped between them. This interference was
not relished by Whitlock, and he asked
Thomas if he meant to ""take it up"" Thomas
replied, ""Only so far as to protect Hayes from
your assault"" Whitlock then made an at.
tack on Thomas, but bystanders interfered
and prevented further proceedings for the
time.


Whitlock Immediately returned to Middle
town, gathered up party of his pals and
went back to Odessa breathing vengeance
against Hayes, Thomas and their friends.
Thomas supposing the matter was at an end
had left Odessa and come over to Middletown.
this the Whitlock party came back
and after drumming up recruits got together
and arranged a conspiracy to go to the Ma
tional Hotel where Thomas and bis friends
were ascertained to be and make combined
attack upon them. This plan was at once
put into execution. Proceeding to the hotel,
after accommodating the premises and ascer-
tanning that Thomas was in the bar-room
no harm, and therefore off his
guard, several of the largest and strongest of
the party entered the room under the pretense
of getting drink, while the rest closed and |
carefully guarded the doors to prevent the
escape of their victim, or assistance from
him from the outside. John Whit
lock quickly and slyly stepped up behind Mr..

Correspondence Of the Baltimore American. ]


HUNTINGTON, W. VA,


January %, 1876


Judge Lynch and his court last
night executed summary proceedings
against a cold -blooded murderer, and,
although one life has paid the forfeit
for terrible crime, it is not at all
improbable that a second life will be
demanded by the lynchers. In my
brief dispatch uf Sunday I gave the
outlines of the murder of a farmer
named Miner, and the lynching of his
murderer. I am now prepared &c
present to your numerous readers the
full particulars of the horrible affair.


On Sunday last, 10Th instant, Hugh
Miner, q we'll to-do farmer, living
within two miles of Barboursville, the
county seat of Osbell, disappeared, and
nothing being heard of him up to
Friday, certain inquiries induced his
friends to believe that he had been
murdered, and acting upon legal ad-
vice, the friends of the missing man
caused the arrest of Mrs. Miner and
q man named Ben Williams. The lat
ter person had been strongly suspect
ed by Miner of having, during the"

time Miner has been missing.


TIE CHILD's story.


After Mrs. Miner and Williams had
| been locked up i'll the county Jail, and
| which is connected with the court
house at Barboursville, little son of
| Mrs Miner stated to the law officer
| that he witnessed the killing of his
| father, and gave the following facts:
After his father aud mother had re-


paired to the yard the quarrel was re-


newed, and while thus engaged. Will


liams armed with an axe, stole up be-


hind. and striking the doomed man


two blows upon the head with the


axe, felled him to the ground. Wll>


liams then cooily cut the throat of his


victim, after which the wife seizing


hold of the legs aud Williams the
arms of the slain man, bore the body


to the barn and concealed it i'll a dung


heap. The murderers then returned


to the house. and after washing the


blood from their hands and clothing,


stated to the little boy that if he even
whispered what he had witnessed they


would kill and bury him beside his
father. Thus threatened the child re-
mained silent upon the snbiect until
the murderers had been lodged

crushed, and bis neck cut almost III
twain. The finding Of the body caused
Intense excitement among the people
for miles around, and before dusk
Saturday, a meeting WAS publicly held
at Barb 'ursville, at which 1t was re-
solved that Williams should be hanged
Immediately. Every particular rela
tive to the hanging of the murderer
wa, discussed without gutse or con-
cealment from the officers of the law,
and when the meeting adjourned, it
was understood that Williams should |
be hanged that night. A minister of
the Gospel Was dispatched to the jail
for the purpose of praying with the
prisoner, but the latter treated the
subject in q fippant manner, avoW-
ing that he knew nothing about the |
of Miner.


THE LYNCHING.


A few moments thereafter fully one |
hundred unmasked men mar ched into |
The court house yard, surrounded the
j all and organized committees to carry |
into effect the hanging of William-.
A vote as to the place was taken, and |
~, ba
wild ""aye"" was the response. This |
shout was heard by the miserable man,
aud, when informed of it's pnrport,
confes, ,ed to having killed Millner, / ut
declared that Mrs. NJ lner was not
accessory to the crime Mrs. Miner,
however. by repeated admissions, con-
vii ced the Iynchers that she was q
party to the murder, but they resolved
TO leave her Ill the hnnds of the law. |
In less than ten minutes after Williams
b ad made his confession the jaiIor was
to produce his prisoner, and
amid IA awful slence, broken only 10y
the falling rain, Williams em""rg. d
from the Jail, followed by Mrs. Miner, |
whom the lynchers determined should
witness the execution. Within thirty
feet of the Jail stood the gibbet tree,
aud d ngling from stout limb was
The rope and restless moose. At
signal, fully fifty pairs of arms tug
ged at the slack end of the rope,
and tho next instant Williams was
dangling in space. A guard was plac""d
over the body, and seven hours elapsed
before the co pAe was taken down aud
aid upou the ground, to await snch
action as friends or officers of she lew
might take in the premises. The body,
however, during the morning was taken
n charge by the Sheriff. Mrs. Miner,
after beiug compelled to witness the
execution of her accompiice, was
to Jail, but the Exc tement
,o- day is at such heat that it is not at
Ill improbable that she too will be
taken from the jail and hanged by the
ynchers. To prevent this double dis
grace a strong body of order-loviug
Of Barbour>viile have declared
sAat the law in the case of the wife
sh all be respected, and if the lynchers
attempt a second execution bloody
work will follow.


After tue mob had collected in the
court house yerd the States Attorney
attempted to dissuade them from Their
unlawful intentions, but his words
we're met with derision. Parties who
took an active part in the lynching of
Williams openly boast of their partlcl-
patton in the matter. and defy the au-
thorities to attempt their arrest."

The Council Earnestly at work ON the


city Budget.",,"To meet the expenses OF the city for
the current year without incurring the
necessity OF issuing scrip or any other
like obligation, Is what is occupying the
attention OF our City Administrators just
now. The condition of the city, finan-
cially. 30 far as this year Is concerned,

ly expenditures, as compared with
ia income, IL will show deficit by
the first OF January, 1877, OF
$1G1 900, unless means are adopted

ever, Is far from being desperate.
The first remedy proposed, Is that which
computes with sordid facts and figures

number of the citys employees and re-
ducinp the salaries OF those retained,
md those Of the Administrators them
selves, twenty-five per cent. rms IL
is reported will be reached by u
reduction In the expenses OF THO
Department OF Improvements amount
ing TO $l0S,0O0 for the remaining SIX
months of the year, and to Sb3,ooo
In the other six departments. It u the
opinion OF Mr.. Plsbury. the Admins.
traitor Of Finance, that this reduction OF
""
without much difficulty, and the exigen-
cies OF the budget complied with. The
second proposition involves the closing
OF the free markets. IL isalso the opin-
ion OF Mr.. Pilsbury that, In the event
these markets are closed, the city will
be enabled to obtain 100000 for Its
markets on lease Of two years. or this
amount 100000 is entered on the
budget pledged to the late fiscal
agent leaving q surplus Of 100000, to
be added TO the credit side OF the budget,
thus reducing the deficit TO $6i 900.
which will bc easily supplied.


In such case the hardships which
might otherwise result to the employees
of the city will be greatly modified, and
Il is barely possible that there may be
no reduction Of employees or salaries at
all


The wharf question Is In statu quo, ow
ing to the proceedings taken in the Supe-
rior District Court by the bondholders.
Therefore its effect upon the budget, II
1t can have any, cannot be determined
until Judge Lynch decides in the
matter."

 When Lambert struck this old road he discovered on the north side of it di- lapidated log cabin. Approaching the cabin he noticed light within, and, feeling satisfied that the murderers were close at hand, he gave 8 loud cough. This brought to the rear door of the house the old woman who occupied it, and who obtained living by selling cakes and beer to passing wayfarers. Lambert. in feigned voice, asked to spend the night within, and was at once admitted. He had but crossed the threshold when the report of Q musket was heard in the next room, and the ball splintered the woodwork of the door above his head.

 Without moments hesitation Lam- bert, with nothing but his tomahawk in hand, sprang into the next room and struck down the man in whose hand was the still smoking musket. The villain s companion, the smaller man of the two, at once fled the house; but before he had passed beyond the light of the fire within, the avenger, with the wretch s own rifle, brought him to the earth in a struggle with death that lasted but a second. AS soon as he had fred the shot Lambert turned upon the prostrate murderer, who was about to arise, and struck him second time, felling him to the floor again. He then, with rope furnished him by the old woman, bound the villains hands and legs securely. In the morning the avenge- borrowed a horse from the woman, strapped upon it's back the living and dead murderers, and before nightfall arrived at Stoi tler's inn.

was undoubtedly deliberately planned and

The citizens who were securing the
country at late hour this afternoon ar
rested Frank Landers, against whom the
evidence is said to be very strong. The
feeling against him is intense, and 1t is pos
sible that he may be lynched before morn

WASHINGTON. JAM 23.-The Republican members
and Senators met in caucus iii the Senate Chamber
last evening to select Congressional Natioha he-
pnblican Committee. Not more than half the Repub-
lican delegation in each house was present, inc
number being between seventy and hundred; but
Il was significant fact that all the Presidential can
didates were present except Senator Norton 1t was
also noticed that all doubtful in the Senate, eX
cent Mr. Chrstiancy, were present, including Sena-
tors Hamilton of Texas. Robertson of South caro-
lima Mcmillan of Minnesota, and Angus Cameron OF
Wisconsin. Messrs. ConNlng, EdnundS, Frehhg-
huysen, the two Morrills, Sargent, the TWO Oahi-
erons Cragin, and Hamlin were among the prohi-
nent Senators present None of the Liberals
In the House were present, and 80 the faces
of Messrs. Chittenden, Bliss Willis, Banks, WI
liams, and others conspicuous by Their
absence Mr.. Kelley of Pennsylvania, whose Loyalty
is sometimes doubted, was also absent. 20 also was
Mr. Kasson. Senator Sherman presided and MT
Tdmunds made the address and presented the reso-
lutious His speech is spoken of in the most praise
worthy terms He referred to the glories and





only to 90 on in the noble purposes to achieve
the victories that have adorned it's banners in the
mast He spoke in pleasant terms of the fact that
some of those absent had returned, alludng To Mr.
Hamilton and Others, and urged the welfare of the
country as the motto Of the party. The following
gentlemen were selected to compose the Committee
namely: Senators Cragin and West, and Representa-
tiyes Wheeler ofNew-York Hunter of Indiana, Lynch
Of Mississippi Burcbard, and Page The duty OF TINS
Committee is TO select one member OF Congress from
each State and Territory to act as aCongresslohaI
executive committee i'll Washington, and the duty
of this second Committee is to provide documents
and speakers for campaign purposes and 70 levy
contributions on Government clerks and other
officers of the Government, III order TO pay the eX-
penses of the campaign. The Committee selected
last night will confer with the delegations from the
various states and select the persons recommended
II is probable that Senator Howe will be Chairman
Henry d. Cook, who has been treasurer of the cam
Dairn funds for several years. has resigned ana his
place will probably be filed by Jacob ID. Tome OF
MARYLAND who is an officer of the Citizens National
Bank Of Washington.


The most interesting feature connected with the
organization of the Executive Committee Will be
election of its Secretary. This position has long
been held by Judge Edmunds, Postmaster OF wash
ington and special friend and adviser OF Secretary
Chandler Mr.. Edmuuds has been very eniclent es-
pecially in the organization Of the negroes in the
South, first into Union Leagues, and later into
constitutional Union Guards"" He has dispensed
In largo degree the patronage of the Committee
and at the close of the last Presidential campaign
established The Republic magazine, which las been
devoted to the defense of the Administration. 1t
has been currently reported that the funds with
which this monthly organ was established were
those which remained in the treasury OF the Commit
tee at the close of the last Presidential
campaign but the magazine seems now to be prl-
vate enterprise. Judge Edmunds has also supcrln
tended the preparation of special editorials on po
Ideal TOPICS which have been printed weekly and
furnished to Republican papers all over the country
The printing of this sheet for which considerable
sum has been paid, and the reproduction OF cam
paign documents have been given TO The HdshinTon
Chronicle aud this work has contributed to its sup
port in no small degree. Some estimate of the value
of this work to a newspaper not especially well sup
ported may De based Oh the fact that during ono of
the Presidential campaigns since the close of the
war ex-CongressInan Platt Of Virginia obtained the
lob of printing campaign documents, aud with his
partners received $4,000 from the Congressional
Committee. During the last four years The Aaiicndt
Republican rather than The Chronicle has
boen the kitchen organ OF the AdIninlstra-
ton, and has received al the fattest
Jobs which have been given out in this city. The
hcpsblicon IL will be remembered is a thTd-term
organ. and s considered more than any other. AS
the mouthpcce Of Gen. Grant. The present editor
of this paper is Mr. Brooks Washington journalist,
somewhat well known throughout the country for
his alleged connection with the distribution Of
Cuban bonds Mr. Brooks Is now reported TO be a
candidate for the position held by Judge Edmunds,
and il is asserted. by those well informed that he
has already secured majority Of the votes of the
Republican Senator'S Should he be successful the
printing of campaign documents, &C., would doubt
less be transferred from The Chronicle to The bepub
koda. and bis election would be interpreted, both
here and throughout the country, as a triumph of
the third-term party."

currence In the Ninth ward in which Mr.

cred at the suggestion of Mr.. Farrell. A
voter approached who wished to deposit q
ballot for Mr.. Barnhill. Mr.. Farrell in q
very emphatic manner announced to him
that the polls had closed and he could not
deposit bis vote. This was all very well,
accordance wiJh decorum or comfy. A
gentleman approached with vote for Far.

and to this Mr.. johnson, the Ward Inspec.
tor objected, ,whereupon Mr.. Farrell became
very demonstrative, and with . blow of hil
fist sent the sash, glass and all crashing
into the face of Mr.. johnson, who was SIT
ting inside, and was badly cut about tht
face. Mr.. Farrell said to those about him
""stick to your colors boys"" but he himself
sought safety in flight, and took refuge il

out OF the way until ~ O'CLOCK that night
when posse Of citizens escorted him ovel

BOARD.",,"William Pitt Kellogg, whom Grant
forced into the executive chair Of Louisi- |
ana against the will of the people of that
State, has telegraphed the New York
Tribune that the democratic victory in
that State was gained by systematic
course of murder, intimida. ION and terror.
ISM"" This is the account he gives of the
condition of society unde. his govern
ment, all the state machinery being un-
der his control and the federal force being
at his disposal. His assertions form a
part Of scheme of lying which is to af
ford basis for the contemplated action
| of the returning board. This returning
board is federal institution for the man
ufacture of majorities. In January, 1872,
before a congressional committee then
sitting in New Orleans, S. b. Packard, the
present republican candidate for govern
or, testified as follows:


| Q. Under the power with which you
have vested the governor, cannot he de-
clare any person he chooses elected?
| A. 1t would nearly amount to that.


The returning board is composed ofthe
governor, lieutenant governor, secretary


OF state and two state senators. In 1872,
when the Democrats carried the state by
: a large majority, it ignored the returns
| and declared Kellogg elected by 1861.


No Official returns were before the board


and the way it reached its determination
is thus described by member in testify
Init,


mittee:


Mr., Lynch. We took all the evidence


we had before us and our knowledge of
the parishes and their political complex
ion, and then we decided

the vote ought to have been?

s mittee of the United States Senate the,
: say: 'sThe proceedings of that board can


not be sustained without disregarding al


the principles of law applicable to til
1fl subject and ignoring the distinction be
l. tween good faith and fraud""


Although both houses of Congress dc
clared the proceedings to be illegal an
j, revolutionary, President Grant sustaine
% them and maintained Kellogg in his sea
n by the bayonet. In 1874 the returnin
=, board again counted out a democratic ms
III jority, and the United States troops il


vaded the Legislature and removed &

ts Grant, of course, upheld the scoundre


in their operations. 1t is to this return

national usurpation. The possibillii

The intimidation policy, which last

flourishing in Mississippi to-day, and
the Democracy is a walking arsenal,
ready at all times to break up Repub-

In this city and county the cam

boast on the streets that they have 2O,-

prepared for any emergency. They
say when the trouble does come they
will go for the leaders of the Republi-
can party and kill them first. There
is not Republican military organi-

the Republicans own as much as

openly assert that they are
in favor of carrying this county if
they have TO kill every white and

If there Is no trouble in this county
it will be owing to the forbearance of
the Republicans. for the Democrats

the course being pursued by the Dem

county is paradise compared
with the adjoining counties of
Wilkinson, Claiborne, and Jeffer-

the Republicans allowed to hold meet

been forced TO leave, and are to-day
refugees driven from their homes sep
arated from their wives and children,
for no other reason than because they
are Republicans.


FREE SPEECH AND A FREE BALLOT
is not granted to Republicans in this
State to-day. In this Congressional |
District the Republicans have a ma
jority, in fair election, of fully Is
600. The Democrats have nominated !
the rebel Brigadier General Chalmers,
who took an active part in the Fort |
Pillow massacre. The Republicans
have nominated the Hon. John r. |
Lynch, a colored man who has served |
the Sixth District in the FOrty-third |

wearicd with examination of some questions, .One
need TO know more now, not Of law merely. but of
anything TO be good lawyer than he did one

with the intelligence and morals Of the age or

see that not even the brother Of Jupiter or Juno,
though the son Of Saturn, could, without prior
study and patient training and long experience,
utilize and make effective these terrible and con
stantly improving agencies.


For a moment makes like comparison In the
fields Of legal science Take the law of municipal
corporations, the many statutes and all the learn
ing touching those local self governments now, as
compared with the early part of the twelfth cen
tury, when the original charter was given to Lon
don, or a century afterwards when, in the days OF
King John, these rights of Internal and subOrdi-
nate administrations were conferred upon towns
and borOughs. Turn back TO the case Of Lynch
VS. DalZell, decided in the House Of Lords, in l79
touching hre insurance, and now attempt to trace
the decisions upon this vast important and rapidly
growing interesting subject, scattered through
many thousand volumes and many more thousand
cases. Glance over Angel Reynolds, Bunyon,
BOnney's compilation, BigeloW's collection OF
cases. Bliss and many other authors and the
numberless cases in our reports and begin to get
q slight glimpse o. the growth Of life Insurance
and vast sums of money annually and perma.
nently invested therein.


Recreate for a short time in the perplexing and
rapidly widening fields of tax titles, which you
will find was not discussed by Mr.. Kent In his
valuable Commentaries, in all that be has so well

track and witnessed the sport left fully satisfied with
all they had seen. Four took place, the first
dash Of three-quartcr Of mile, between very
equally matched horses, and they made q capital race.
The avorto was beaten and this gave appetite to the
spectators for the that to follow Tho
ond that has for years been considered
important one, It being the Ocean Hotel Stakes for
threo year-old colts and hlies When first run, and
the following year, tho race was mile heats but
aflcrwari changed to mile and threequartcr dash.
The frs. year, 1870, the race was won
by General Buford's Enquirer, after Lynch

to mile and threcquarters, Mate, carrying ITO lbs,
won the stake in 3:15 Extract second, and in 1873
Lizzie Lucas, carrying lO7 lbs, beat the great Tom
Bowling in 3:12H. The weights for the race again
underwent a change and II was decided that colts
should carry 95 lbs. and fies % lbs until 1873. In

",,"Yesterday evening, at six O'Clock,
before Judge Lynch of the Superior
District Court, the case Of Triplett and
Turnbull, the Union Rights Stop OF
Baton Rouge, was called and, on mo-
ton Of attorney for the Sheriff OF East
Baton Rouge, the writ was dismissed
and the accused handed over to the
Deputy Sheriff Of Baton Rouge, who
took them up the river on boat leav-
ing in the evening; they were accom-
panied by one Of the deputies OF Sheriff
Fagan, the latter having promised to
see the prisoners safely incarcerated in
the Baton Rouge Jail, and without be-
ing molested.


The result Of the affair is due to the
impossibility of counsel for Triplett and
Turnbull to make out a case for thelr
clients after the filing Of the affidavit
made in this city before Judge Adams,
of the Fourth Municipal Court. the
grounds for the writ being based on the
original affidavit made in Baton Rouge,
through which they were arrested and
lodged in Jail here, and which was con.
siderod informal and illegal."

It is unnecessary for us at this time to
point out the economy of the Democratic
Council lust in power. We have done so
repeatedly, and shown where 1t has dealt
with the city's money prudently, and ac-
complished more than any of the councils
which preceded it. None of the figures
which have been published have ever been
controverted, they have defled argument,
and stood awaiting and inviting argument,
and yet it has not been complied with.


The Democratic tickets offered in the diff
ferent wards are candidates for office from
party that has stood up against all calumnJ !,
and asks only for tho patronage of those
who admire honesty in municipal govern
m ent and wish perpetuation OF the same.
Council In Democratic hands again will be
the same safeguard to the peoples interests
that it is now, and to secure this every Dem
ocrat is called upon to-day to DO his duty
and vote the ticket In his ward offered by
his party.


IN THE THIRD WARD.


Discovery has been made that the ene-
mics OF the Democratic party are already
arranging their plans for the defeat OF the
Democratic ticket, and conspicuous In this
movement is one, we are sorry to say, who
is acting solely through selfish motives. He
was defeated for the nomination, and Is now
and has been for several days circulating
tickets which are introduced to deceive.
These tickets have the name of the Repub-
lican Councilman at the head, and the
4 Democratic candidates for Inspector and
Assistant Inspector beneath It. These
tickets have been freely distributed about
the ward. These tickets should be well
watched for.


The most desperate effort that Will be
made by the Republicans to carry the elec-
ton will be in the distribution OF negro
, repeaters in the different wards. These
have been regularly trained to do the work,
and under the leadership of experienced
noliticiaps will 90 from ward to ward
, denositing their ballots for the Republican
ticket. 1t is understood from an authorita-
tive source IT, at this will be the most for
, midable opposition that will be offered to
the Democrats In the contest to-day. They
; are to be most successfully met and in no
; better way could 1t be than that proposed in
the Sixth Ward.


IN THIS WARD.
It is proposed to have men at the polls
from every ward in the city, and by this


means If q man attempts to vote in ward
that is not the one of his residence he will
be Immediately recognized and placed where
repeating counts for naught.


The same course will be pursued at all


the polls in the city, and in this way re-


peaters can be detected as fast as they


make their appearance. It will be neces-
, sary to do this in all the wards, but in the
sixth ward more especially than the others,
as the effort to defeat Mr.. McMenamin
, will be a most determined one. Into this


ward 1t is said that the Republican politi-
clans intend to send perfect flood of re-
peaters, as they have sworn, If such can be
done, to defeat Mr.. McMenamin BY any


means that may be available with but
small regard for the amount OF principle in
yolyed in carrying out their threats.

Mr. Pyle said, that he in company with
Mr.. Jones had visited the Water depart
ment office and signed bills amounting u
81 $40 20, and left them On the table @
usual for third signature but had not aeen
them since and did not know what he'd
become Of them.


Mr.. Farrell stated, that in the Ninth
ward the Inspector and Assistant Inspector
were both Republicans, and % the city
charter specified that one of the said officers
should be from each party, he desired !
Assistant Inspector elected; but /
was overruled by the chair. a


On motion the proper officers were instrct-
ed to make note for $20, 600, to b dis-
counted In the Union National Bank for
ninety days, to pay q note due on the 7th
inst.


The following resolution Of respect for
the President was offered by Mr.. Lynch
and unanimously adopted on rising vote:


Resolved-That the warmest heartfelt
thanks of this body be and are hereby ten
dered to M. L. Lichtenstcin, Esq, - mark
of respect for the kind, courteous and gen
manner in which he has acted
upon all occasions as our presiding officer.
It is with profound pleasure that We assure
the honorable gentleman thstin our humble
opinion the just and impartial manner IN
which he has filled the position entrustedt to
him by the people, should not only meet
with our approbrtion, but should receive
the praise Of the entire community.


Messrs. Lynch and McIntire both spoke
in the highest terms of praise as to the ell
cheney, faithfulness and integrity Of Mr..
Lichenstein as presiding officer. Though
be differed with them politically, yet they
had the kindest regard for him and the
strongest faith in him as an officer and
gentleman.


Mr.. Lichenstein in return thanked them
very kindly for their unanimous sentiment,
in approving his course, and assured them
that this was one OF the 3appiest hours Of
his life. .p


It was remarked by Mr.. McIntire during
his speech on the adoption of the resolution
VI EcspsCI1 tuAV ~ Was AoSt WVItuy Va uV-
tice that Mr.. Lichenstein's decisions had
never been appealed from once during his
occupancy of the chair. 4

Legislature.",,"for the completion of the northern
compartment of the Cool Spring reser.
voir was called up MIR. Pyle and read
twice. (This ordinance was printed in
yesterdays GAZETTE


Mr.. McIntirc stated that at the next
meeting, when this ordinance came up
for third reading, he would, if in or,
der. substitute it with one more legally
drawn up.


The chair stated that such action
would be in order.


Mr.. Farrell said that no ordinance
could be drawn up by any lawyer in
the country which would not conflict
with the city charter, in regard TO rails
ing money for the completion of the
reservoir. He said the only plan was
TO have the Legislature convened, and
authority granted for the issue of
bonds.


Mr.. Paynter offered resolution pro,
vidiDg that the President and the
chairman of the Water and Finance
Committee be appointed a committee
to wait on the Governor and request
him to convene the Legislature for the
purpose of having passed an act auth
orizing the city to issue bonds for the
completion of the reservoir.


MIR. McGlinchey said that the same
gentleman (Mr. Pyle) was chairman of
both the Water and Finance Commit
tees, and therefore the committee
would be composed of two members.
Mr.. Mclntire thought this was no
time for trivial objections. He was
interested in the workingmen, being a
poor man himself. If the men were
not soon furnished with work they
would follow the example of working
men in Newark, N. j., and demand of
the city either ""bread or work""
Mr.. Lynch moved as an amendment
that Mr.. Paynter be added to the COM
mittee.


Nr. Febiger moved as further
amendment that in case the extra ses-
sion of the Legislature is called, the
Council request that the completion
of the reservoir be taken from Coun-
sioners. He gave as a reason that the
amount OF money proposed to be asked
for (3O,000) was not sufficient to even
finish the north compartment of the
basin.


MIR. Farrell opposed MIR. Febiger's
amendment. He also said it was folly
to ask for only $4,000 loan from the
Legislature. Great loss had already
been sustained from a want of money,
and this time enough should be OBJ
tanned to entirely finish the work.


Mr.. Paynter replied that no sum
had been fixed upon to apply to the
Legislature for permission to borrow,
and that in case the extra session was
called an estimate could be procured
of the amount necessary to be asked
| for.


Mr.. Pyle stated that the Consulting
Engineer had given an estimate that
the amount necessary to complete the
northern compartment of the basin
was $25, 600; hence the sum mentioned
in the ordinance go, ,00O). In asking
the Legislature for permission to ere,
ate loan, the entire amount necessary
to fully complete the reservoir could
be estimated and applied for.
Mr.. FebIger in his further remarks
| intimated that the interest expressed
| by certain members for the poor men
was all buncome; there was not Re-
publican employed on the basin.


Mr.. McIntire-Yes, there are num-
ber of them.


Mr.. Febiger-Thcre is not colored
man employed in any department of
the city.


Mr.. Farrell here called on MIR. Nc
Menamain, who stated that several
colored men were employed in the
Street Department.


MIR. MeIntire supported Mr.. Febiger' S
amendment. He favored the plan of
Commissioners several years ago,
| when Mr.. Febiger and his party objec-
ted to it, aud spent $775 in bribing the
Legislature to authorize loan for the
reservoir without insisting on the
Commissioners. He also said that
when the work was commenced the
Republicans wasted 100000 in idle
engineering-digging French drains,
&c, around the basin lot.
Mr.. Paynter was willing to give his
solemn word to Council and to
Almighty God that he had NO political
views in this matter.


Mr.. Farrell insisted that Mr.. Febi.
gers request for Commissioners was,
like all his other movements in Coun-
Gil, for political effect. He hoped to
| have Conservative Democrat and a
Conservative Republican appointed as
two of the Commissioners, and thus
secure some benefit for his party.
Mr.. Febiger laughed at the idea of
any Republican controlling the ap'
pointment of the Commissioners
when the Legislature is almost unani'
mously Democratic. He wanted the
reservoir taken from the hands of
Council. He believed two thirds of the
work already done would have to be
done over again, and the paities who
finish the basin would have to bear
the blame. For himself he wanted
nothing whatever to do with the
work.


Mr.. Febiger's amendment, after
some further discussion, was lost by
) the following vote:


Ayes-Messrs.-Febiger, Downing,
Adams, Jones, VIM. Candy, McIntirc,
Taylor.

EDITOR TIMES John r. Lynch wa:
advertised to speak at Port Gibson on
the 21st. From many indications was
led to believe that he would not he per.
mitted to speak.


THE LITTLE PAPER


published at that pIace-that IS ever
filed with falsehood, SANDER AMI mis-
representations of Republicans, gave out
that Lynch was to be there on The 2Ist,
and that somebody e.-e would b. there
too.


The streets and county cross roads


WERE FIRsE PLACARDED


with &"" Sitting Bull war dance-wiil
commence at daylight, Dist"" and again
cross bones, and 21st on each side OF it.
BY o'clock, on the morning of the 21st,
friend came to my house and informed
me that the different Democratic cubs IN
the county We're quietly dropping into
town and reporting at their headquarters;
tha. he had been informed that the
Sheriff had summoned one hundred Of
them to act as Sheriff. police at the Re
publican speaking. At 9 a. NJ, got on
my horse and started to the speaking
ground, which is about half way between
my house and Port Gibson, or say half a
mile. When / got outside of nay gate |
was told that there vas a picket Of fifteen
men just beyond the turn of the road
ahead of me- [ did not wish to go alone,
and turned back and went around
through my field and came ont on the
public road ut the two mile bridge.
HE MEETS THE NEGROES AND ADVISES


THEM TO GO TO THE MEETING ARMED.


l found the people from towards Grand
Gulf had passed up the road on their way
to town. soon caught up with them
and found them hiding their guns in the
bushes. / said to them, ""Men, you are
leaving your guns too far from the speak
ing better take them farther up the
road and then hide them"" We went up
the road say quarter of a mile, when
we met the same man that was at my
house in the morning, who announced
to us that there were ut least two hun
dred and fifty men in Port Gibson getting
cut their needle guns.


But CHANGES HIS OPINION AND ADVICE


When he told me this, turned to the
men and said, ""Men, the best thing we
can do, is to go quietly back to our
homes | intend to do so, and you had
better do so too"" They all started back
for home, and l went home and stayed
there the balance Of the day.


WHAT He LEARNED.


| learned afterwards that the people
had gone nearly to the two-mile bridge,
when the Sheriff and some of his men
overlook them, and, after much persua-
sion, induced them to turn round and come
back to the speaking, he pledging his
word Of honor that they should not be
molestcd. Perhaps two-thirds Of them
went back with him, after putting their
guns in the bushes. When they arrived
on the grounds Lynch was refused per-
mission to speak, unless under Democrat
ic direction; was repeatedly called a liar;
and declined speaking and Wash Daven-
port attempting to take the stand, the
colored people broke in all directions.


LIVELY SHAKING OF THE SHIRT TALE.


Those taking the direction of Grand
1ulI were purSueu Ot J5FSJ W SOHtc queen
or tloenty red shirted gentry, who amused
themselves by firing at them with their
pistols and striking at them with clubs,
and riding furiously at them, the people
flying terrified before them. The pur-
suers seemed to get Inducements until
there could not have been less than two
hundred and fifty rushing madly along
a regular steeple chase-along the public
road, along the railroad, up through my
field, charging ont through the sedge
grass, hunting them up like you would
partridges, and with as little danger.
While this scene was passing the flag Of
the United States was peacefully waving
over a garrison of her soldiers, in full
view When they got to the two-mile
bridge l understand few shots were re-
turned that was where the boys had
left their guns. The Sheriff and his
posse afterwards crossed the bridge and
skirmishing over the fields Of James
Page, succeeded in capturing four Of his
brother-in-law's sons, all young men
under twenty, and carried them off to
Jail. One Of them was accidentally shot
in the foot They searched Pages house
for implements of war, and finally passed
back to Port Gibson to glorify over the

Republican meeting that has been at

New CASTLE, May Court opened, this
morning, at 10 o'clock, judges Wootten and
Houston on the bench. The Grand Jury
list was then called and sworn, Evan C.
stotsenberg being sworn as foreman.
Judge Wootten then deliverd the charge of
the Court substantially as follows
Gentlemen of the Grand Jury:


1t has not been customary, for many
years, for the Court to deliver long writ
ten charge, as formerly. Our Revised
Code has been 30 we'll arranged and the laws
so classified that this necessity has been
superseded. At the present term, I am
happy to say for the credit of New CASTLE
County, there are no capital felonies. Most
of the business that will fall under your
notice is of a trlfling nature, such as lar
cenies, assaults and batteries, and illegal
sale of intoxicating liquors.


The Court here called the attention of
| the Grand Jury to the provision of the Re-
vised Code concerning crimes and misde-
meanors, and also to the act regulating the
sale of intoxicating liquors, and remarked
| that whether this law was wise or not was
not for the Court to say, but it was the law
of the State and while it was such it was
the duty of those concerned to obey it, and
especially those who are granted licenses.


The Grand Jury then retired to their
room.


The first case called was State Us. Robert
Lansing-g ambling The defendant not
being taken, the State retired the case.


State Us John G. Hey-assault and bat.
terry with intent to kill Mr. Dugan on No

gully of an assault only. The Court heard
the evidence, tending to prove a family
quarrel at Heys and Mr.. Dugan's interfer-
ence, whereupon Hey went for Dugan with
knife The defense called witness tC
prove that he had no knife, and the night
was too dark to see man from the curb
and also that Hey was drunk. Attorney
General for State; WAitely for defense. The
Court imposed fine of $40 and costs.


In another case against Hey, growing ou

BLANE's SPEECH.


Mr.. CnAIRMAS-rhe honor Of the national govern

alike menaced by those who demand the per-
petnation of an rredeemable paper currency. For
from prostraton in business confidence returns but
slowly; trade revives only partially and today with
capital unprOductive and labor unemployed, find
ourselves in the midst Of an agitation respecting the
medium with which business transactions shall be
carried on Until this question is definitely adjusted

power stubbornly stands to-day. The republicans,
always true TO the primal duty or supporting the
tions credit have now cast behind them all minor diff
ferences and dssensions the financial question and
have gradually consolidated their strength against IN

prominent political issue, and those democrats who
favor OF honest dealing by the government and
honest money for the people. may be compelled TO act
they did in that still graver exigency when the
istence of the government itself was at stake


While this question should be approached in no
spirit OF partisan bitterness, il has yet become
tangled with party relations that intelligent discus
sion Of it be had without giving its political his
tory; and If that history bears severely the demo-
cratic party its defenders must the facts and
not quarrel with their presentation Firmly attached
TO political party myself, firmly believing that par
ties in free government are as heathul they are
inevitable, ] still think there questions about
which parties should agree TO disagreoand OF
these the essential nature and value Of the
lating medium. And it Is a fact of especial weight and
significance that up to the paper money era-whch
was precpiiated upon during the rebellion
OF wars ineXorabe necess ties-there
never political party in this country that bar
leved in any other than the specie standard for our
currency. If there any principle that was

member of Congress continuously durng the admins

truth when he declared IN the Senate that ''this

men, who had themselves seen and felt the evil OF
paper money and meant TO their postcrty from
It."" To this uniform adherence 10 a specie standard
the crisis OF the rebellion forced an exception


Mr.. Blaine then proceeded sketch the condition OF
affairs which compelled the issue Of legal tenders
which the ablest lawyers found for in the
text OF the constitution, and which placed on the
ground Of absolute overwhelming necessity"" He
then referred the Of the democratic party
which, he said irreconclaby hostile to the issue
of legal tenders when that OF credit was neces-

the country was saved conceived a violent love for
them. Continuing he said


THE FINANCIAL CONDITION

revulsions In trade common 10 al commercial nations

alive and alert as looks for instant remedy and
the danger in such condition OF the public mind is

time, the theories for relief are numerous. and we
have marvellous recipes offered whereby the people
shall be enabled 10 pay the dollar they owe with less

such deuson seemingly forget that even Il this be

efforts to be unfair and inconsistent in the con-
ference committee on appropriations, has
earned the undying soubriquet which has re-
Gently been given him of ""Inappropriate Sam""


Ha Ia. Another little scheme of economy.
1t is said that the man who named his son
""John Wilkes Booth Hamilton"" will be paid
by the ex-rebel House his salary as clerk to
the Ways and Means Committee for the full
session. That's right, gentlemen. 1t is in
your line of business. The payment of rebel
claims are, and that is the claim of rebel.


Mr.. Lynch, of Mississippi, delivered an elo-
quent and forcible reply to Mr.. Lamar's speech
on Saturday. 1t must have been chagrin in
tensifed to the ex-Confederate chieftain, after
proclaiming that the colored race was unfit
for the privileges of the elective franchise, to
have such a thorough excoriation from the
hands of one of the leaders of that race.


Some miserable and ungenerous journalist
has started rumor rejecting unfavorably
upon our bright and rising young vocalist,
Miss Abbott, and in answer to this mean
attack score of prominent gentlemen and
ladies calamity came forward in her defense,
and in a pithy card to the press deny the
allegation, and would evidently like to skin
the ""alligator"" alive.


Mr.. Lynch, during his speech in the House
on Saturda y, said of the Democratic party
'They are willing to subordinate all other
questions to the one great object of Demo-
cratic success. They are willing to subordi-
nate all other questions, without excepting the
honor, the integrity and the plighted faith of
the nation. They only ask, Give US the Dem
ocratic party; that is what we want. The
sole objective point with US is to get the Gov
ernment into our hands and let US get our
fingers on the purse-strings of the Treasury""
Yes, and to day one hundred thousand hun
CRY, anxious, impatient ofice-seekers are
success, and waiting, waiting for the ship to
come in.


The wheels of progress still revolve, and
Congress is to adjourn at last-Wednesday at
the latest. Happy Wednesday. Welcome
adjournment. Goodbye mud-slingers. Wei
come political legislative rest to the dear
people. Farewell vain and tricky investiga-
tors. Welcome relief from the continued
blunders of Democratic House; thrice well
come. And, again, farewell, oh mighty dirt
hurlers. Thank God, long farewell. Yea, a
long farewell to schemes that blacken what
ever they touch; to utterances that make 10y
atty blush to parsimonious meanness that
makes the acts Of whte-livered misers bright
in its presence; to rebel bills for paying rebel
debts; to the army of Confederate soldiers
camped in the left wing of the Capitol; to bill
ious Ben Hill and Estate Rights Tucker; to
the inappropriate Randall and the felicitous
Cocks; to these and to all others of the ex-
Confederate and doughfaced mob that has
made this the longest, most expensive and
most disgraceful session ever inflicted on the

months interest had accrued and that the interest
payable semi-annualy. When the semi-ann interest
became due she compelled TO pay the interest for

now here. Firing at 500 yards began short
"" before II O'Clock, each team occupying
different shooting point from yesterday.


Fulton fired the first shot of the Ameri-
can team at 800 yards, and made bulls
eye, scoring 5. Gildersleeve made three
successive BULBS eyes. Bodine's first three
shots were 4, s, 4. Aliens first shot missed
the target his second scored Q only, and
his third 3. Rathbone's first two shots
were 5 and 4. Dakin's first shot was a
bulls eye, and Farwell's first four shots
scored 4, 5. 4 and 5.


Of the Irish team, Rigby led of, and made
an outer counting Q. Dyas made bulls
eye, scoring 5, and Fenton made 3 bulls
eyes in succession. The shooting of the
Irish team, so far is strong.


The shooting of the Americans is improv-
ing. It opened rather weak.


The Scotch are doing very fairly. Boyd
opened with bulbs eye. Thorburn's first
shots were bulbs eyes, while the balance
are good shooting.


The following is the score of the Canadian
team at 500 yards:

the Irish team fine score of $50 out of a
possible 200, while the Australians scored
16l, the Canadians 159, the Americans 1853,
and the Scotch 157. This is gain for the
Irish of % and leaves them only s6 to make
to get even with the Americans. The
contest now lies between the American
and Irish. The shooting of the former is
improving so much at the present range OF
1000 as to render it impossible that the Irish
can close the gap. The Americans won by

 aFive Years old.-The morning of July IA. 1871, we printed the first newspaper ever printed in Salisbury, hence, to-day, July IA, 1876, THE NEWS is five years old, and begins it's sixth year with this number.

 Barn Burned-Very sorry indeed to learn that the large barn, sheds and ice house belonging to Editor Hyde of the Lee Gzeaner, were destroyed by fire on the evening of July 4th. Insured for only $500, only a small per cent of the loss.

 Sold for Thirty-F'ive Hundred.-Hen. Ayers says he has sold his ''colt,"" (forty- two years old last May) and got thirty-fve hundred (cents) for her, notwithstanding the unpleasant notoriety she gave herself by running away the other day, when she ran ten or twelve rods before she stopped.

 A Gale in Lime Rock.-The brisk wind which preceded the storm in this village of last Monday afternoon, was gale in Lime Rock, blowing down quite number of trees. We understand teams were employed all one day in dragging trees, etc., out of the road. No damage is reported except the wrought among the trees.

 Fifty, Not Thirty-Five.-We were in correctly informed in regard to the number of members of Cascade Lodge from Falls Village, which were in attendance at our celebration. We stated in our report that thirty five members were present. We are now informed ths number was fifty Good; wish the number had been twice fifty.

 Hot Weather.-If our readers think they can make a newspaper such weather as we have had for the past few days, we'd like to have lem try it. Mercury in ther- mometers higher than Mt. Ararat, and ed- itorial courage going in streams out of ev- cry pore. Several days in succession the mercury reached very nearly to 100 in the shade.

 Those Notices..-We euclose in papers this week little notices to some of our sub scribers, which we trust will be read and carefully considered by those who find them. We shall direct our mailer to en- close notice in the paper of every sub- scriber whose date has not yet been brought up to the Centennial figure, ""76. "" It is simply little privacy between us and them, and we are sure cannot otherwise than be pleasantly received.

 The Democratic Nominee. 'Tilden, Tllden, who is this Tilden the democrats have nominated,' an honest hearted citizen asked of peighbor in this village few days since. 'Why, Theodore Hilton, oi course,"" was the response. ""Then by golly he don't get my vote; I'll never vote for g d-d w-w-wretch as he is, if he is g democrat"" The fun of 1t Is, the kind neighbor who informed our Yerdant friend that Theodore Hilton was the man, is one of our prominent citizens, who takes but one newspaper, and that is religious jour nal.

upon its duties and have collected a
very large sum of money and other
property from the assets of said assign
ees, amounting in all to the value of
over five hundred thousand dollars.


That after the making of said as
signments on the 18th day of January
it was filed.


That on February I'd 1876 the said
Temple & Workman made a pretended
inventory of their joint and several
property and of their lirbili ties.


That the said assignments were not
made in good faith but with the intent
to delay and defraud the creditors of
Temple & Workman.


That it was not intended to convey
all of their property to said assignees,
but Oh the contrary thereof the said
Temple & Workman did fraudulently
conceal large amounts of their joint
and several properties to the value of
two hundred thousand dollars, and did
wholly omit the same from the said
inventory made by them as aforesaid.


That said Temple & Workman did
SO conceal, among other things,
large sum of money in gold coin,
amounting to fifty thousand dollars,
Which said last mentioned sum was
received by said Temple & Workman
at their said banking house and above
the amounts paid out by them be-
tween the 9th of December A. d. 1875
and the date ofsaid assignments.


That Temple & Workman did so con-
ceal, among other things, a certain

pie q Workman, and that they did
fraudulently conceal other pro missory
notes.

That said Temple fraudulently con-
cealed about four hundred head of cat
tie and one thousand head of sheep.


That on the 18th day of January,
1876, and after drawing said assign
ments the said Temple did fraudulently
abstract from the assets of said firm of
Temple & Workman $1,000 in gold
coin and placed among the assets his
check therefor ante-dated January 18th
1875.


That on the 18th day of January 1876
and after the drawing of said assign
ments the said Temple fraudulently
abstracted for the assets of said firm
$2,400 gold coin.


That on the 18th day of January one
Thomas w. Temple, a son of F. P. F.
Temple, with the consent of the latter,
did fraudulently abstract from the as
sets of the firm $500 gold coin.


That at the time said assignments
were made one Adolph Portugal was
indebted to the sali firm in the sum of
$4,000 gold coin, that three days after
said assignments were made the said
Temple, fraudulently combining with
said Portugal, to defraud the creditors
of said firm, did cause the said indebt-
edness of Portugal to be satisfied on
Temple then drew his check for the
said sum of Sc, 900 in lieu of said Por-
tugal's Indebtedness to said firm, and
ante-dated his check to Jan. II, 1876,
and placed the same among the assets
of the firm and did fraudulently omit
and conceal the ndebtedness of said
Portugal to the firm.


That said Temple claims as exempt
from execution, as homestead, GER
tain real estate which he has falsely
inventoried at $4,000 when the plain
tiffs know it to be worth $4,000.


That said VIM. Workman claims as
homestead property falsely valued at
$4,000 when it is worth $4,000.


That none of said property so con-
cealed and omitted from said invento-
ry as aforesaid, was ever delivered to
said assignees.


That neither of said assignments
was made in good faith, in that both
provide for the payment of certain
claims known to the said Temple &
Workman to be false, and for the pay
ment of more upon certain claims
against said assignees than was justly
due them.


That said inventory includes cer-
tain pretended debt from said Temple
& Workman to J. J. Mellus, Treasur-
er of the City of Los Angeles, when
in fact no debt was due from said
Temple & Workman to said Mellus.


That neither of said assignments
was made in good faith in that on the
18th day of January 1876, the said
Temple & Workman, well knowing
the insolvency of said firm,of Temple
& Workman, and the insolvency of
each of said firm and while they were
actually engaged in making said as
signment to Spence q Freeman, the
said Temple, with the sole purpose
aad intent of preferring enc creditor
over the others did then fraudently"

Third. There are no substantial complaints of

| su6stantiated by ample proof, we decline to con-
cur in his removal from those schools.
While we readily admit the legal right of the

proved to be inefficient, long established usage,
beginning from the very foundation Of our school
system, has established the principle that teach

neglect OF duty inefflcency. reversal of this

After further discussion both names nominated

Trustee Randolph, from the committee on

The committee were of the opinion that such a

the adoption of the resolutions referred to, and
they offered resolution that said school be loca

Mr.. Haues' Reclamation.",,"THE REASONS HE STATES FOR HIS ACTION;


MS ECONOMICAL EFFORTS OPPOSED AND


FRUSTRATED.


In the City Council last evening, Mr..
James 2. Hayes, member from the Fourth
Ward, arose for the purpose OF Offering
his resignation, and spoke in substance,
as follows:


During the three -and-a-half years l
have been member OF Council. it has
been my effort to do what is right and
economical, and my idea to legislate for
the benefit of the whole city and not for
the benefit of few people. may have
erred in many things, but it so ! did it
unknowiDgly, IL has been my aim to do
justice to all.


The Democratic party came into power
on the principle Of economy, and on that
issue we gained control of Council Then
my sole object was to carry cut this prin-
clple and bring up the financial condi-
ton of the city to a sound standpoint.
But | have been baffled in my attempts;
all my efforts have been met with op-
position votes in Council sufficient to
overcome them and the objects of econo-
my defeated. We now have a floating
debt of over S105, l90.40, against $4,000
in Sepembter last.


Mr.. Paynter here inquired what was
the floating debt and the financial
condition Of the city this time
last year. He said the Democrats in
Council were charged with being more
extravagant than the Republicans were,
but he did not think SO. He wanted a
falrer comparison.


Mr.. Hayes responded: have not the
figures at hand to give the required in
formation. | am only showing the re-
suit of our acts, and | want to place my
self correctly before the community, so
that the people may know how | have
been abused and villitied and how have
failed in my efforts for economy.
In January last the appropriations
then amounted S2j3, SO 50, and the ex-
penseS for the first seven months OF the
fiscal year amounted to S252, ,j77 10
nearly the amount Of the entire appro-
pration. This is the result OF our Efforts
to economize and cut down expenses.
] say this not in a spirit Of uukindness
TO the party or 20 my fellow members,
but to put myself right before this com
inunity, where ! have lived for thirty
three years, aud where, during the last
year | have been most damnably villiied.


He. ncintirt here Il ated that the float
ing deht or the city this time last year
WIS 10000. He said Mr.. Hayes resigned
hcriH5e he could not ruie, and wautsG 10
either rule or ruin


air. Hayes responded that he neither
wanted to rule nor ruin, and then handed
III hl5 resi- gnatioE, which WAS read, as
follows

The present efficiency iof the colored schools S
mainly attributable to the protection thrown
around them through Congressional legislation,
wherein they were removed from the local politi-
cal revulsions. That, together with the generous
support given them by the citizens generally. and
the active interest in their management by those
Identified with then by race and sympathy, have
placed them among tie best schools IN the coun.
Try. The bill introduced by Representative
Lynch looking TO the creation of a separate board
Of trustees to look alter the colored schools spe
clally, receives, We understand the support of the
best thinking minds among our colored citizens.
Among the reasons assigned is tina: the colored
child shsuld not be subjected to and governed by
the pre- siudice which excludes II from the common
school, especially, after au experience Of thirteen
years, II has been demonstrated that the colored
people are capable Of managing the education ol
their own children."

Down came the lamp satura- ting the overcoat with oil, which now costs 35 cents per gallon, former price from l2 to IS cents, which ignited. and the garment was soon one mass of fame His honor bethought him of some valua- ble papers which were in the pockets of the ill-fated coat.

| HISTORY OF ITS ADOPTION.
Mr.. C. Edwards Lester, in ""Our First Hum
| dred Years."" describes the situation preceding
and attending upon the adoption of the
Declaration as the hour which had sat last
""come for the final step to be taken which
''was to render forever the thirteen Colonies
""from the throne Of Great Britain. Scarcely
'three months had passed since the English
'stroops had been driven out of Boston, and
'the shadow of great war was spreading over


''the whole country. Nearly every provin-
""cial Assembly had spoken in favor of Inde-
""pendence. But still the Colonial Congress
''hesitated on the verge of the ABYSS which


""single act would lay open at their feet, while
''the nation itself seemed ready for the last
s'decisive movement""


For many days after this feeling of dread
had clouded the minds of the delegates. A
murky gloom pervaded the hall where their
deliberations were held. Richard Henry Lee
had already displayed the high qualities of
statesman, and his soul glowed with patriotic
fervor He rose in his place, and in the rich
tones which gave so magical a charm to his
eloquence. read in a clear, deliberate voice the
great resolution which SO far transcribed the
action of Congress on the 10th of May, recon-
mending the establishment of independent
State governments in all the Colonies, that 1t
was rather the expression of the popular will
of the country-could it have been heard that
day-than the will of Congress itself. It en-
braced the three great subjects Declara-
tion of Independence, a Confederation of the
States, and Treaties with Foreign Powers
and was in the following words: ""That the
'tunitcd Colonies are, and Of right ought to be


'free and independent States; that they are
''absolved from all allegiance to the British
'Crown, and that all political connection be-
'tween them and Great Britain is, and ought
s'to be, total ly dissolved.


''That 1t is expedient forthwith to take the
""most effectual measures for forming foreign


ALLIANCES.


""That the plan of Confederation be prepared
""and transmitted to the respective Colonies
""for their consideration and appreciation""


Mr.. Lees biographer, says tradition, relates
that he prefaced his motion with q speech,
portraying the resources of the Colonies, and
their capacity for defense, dwelling especially
on the bearing which an independent position
might have on foreign Powers, and concluded
by urging the members so to act, that the day
might give birth to an American Republic.


1t was we'll known that Mr.. Lee was to in
troduce the great resolution, and 1t was equally
well known that, If pressed at the time, it
would divide the House. Only few of the
more dauntless spirits, even In that brave
Assembly, were prepared for SO irrevocable
Declaration. The question was brought home
to every delegate. Every man there knew
that in voting for it he was deliberately put.
ting the halter round his own neck. One
movement further, and he had leaped the
gulf, and found himself beyond the line of
high treason-a proclaimed outlaw, with a
price on his head. Any man might kill him
the God of Heaven alone having the power to
put a mark upon his brow that would exempt
him from slaughter.


John Adams seconded Lees motion; but we
learn from the Journal of Congress that the
resolution was postponed until the next morn
ing, and the members were enjoined to attend
punctuaily at 10 o'clock, in order to take the
same into consideration.


Promptly at the hour the House met, when
Lees resolution was referred to a committee
of the whole. Benjamin Harrison, the future
Governor of Virginia, took the chair, Then
commenced that great debate of which we
know so little, except the result. 1t lasted
till O'Clock in the evening, when Hancock
resumed the chair, and announced that, as
the committee had come to no decision, they
had directed him to ask leave to sit again on
Monday, June 10, and the motion to adjourn
over Sunday was carried.


For two days longer the resolution was de-
bsted with all the vehemcnce and power
which could be brought for its defense on the
one side, against everything that could be said
on the other. The page OF no history yet writ
ten, or that ever can be written, will give more
than faint idea of this gigantic and despe-
rate struggle; for it is not known, after a
careful search of a century, that a single
speech then delivered is now in existence. In
the preface of the ""Memoir, Correspondence,
""and Miscellanies from the Papers of Thomas
Jefferson"" it is declared that this is the first
| disclosure to the world of these debates. We
| are told at the time jefferson summed up the
| arguments for and against the resolution
urged 10y the speakers during both days-that
on the one side James Wilson, Robert r. Liv-
ingston, Edward Rutledge, and John Dickin-
son declared themselves in favor of the meas
ures, but objected to their adoption at the
| time because there would be a lack of unau-
unity; and pleading for delay of three
weeks, they announced that by that time,
they believed the Middle Colonies, which were
not thcu ripe for the measure, would be pre-
pared for IT. They were answered with ire"

IRON REGULAR CORRESPONDENT OF THE rRIBUHE.1


PHILADELPHIA, Sept. ""a number of prominent
Louisiana Republicans now in this city-among
them Centennial Commissioner Lynch and Con-
gresham MOrey-represent the condition of affairs
in that State as rather discouragng to the Repubh
cans. The recent assassination of DIR. Diukgrave,
sheriff of Ouachta PARISH they fear is the beginning
of a series of political murders Of leading white Re-
publican politicians who are active in organizing the
negro vote. Dr. Dinkgrave was native of the
State, and therefore not open to the odious
charge of being caTpet-bagger. He came of
an old Whig family, and was Repubil-
can by connection. He had been engaged
for a few days before his death in forming the
blacks into campaign cubsnot secret societies, but
open, political clubs, such as common in every
campaign throughout the North. Several times he
had received warning that his life was in danger If
he persisted in this work, but being man of per-
sonal courage he paid no attention to them. The
circumstances of his assassination were as follows:


Returning to his home one day, he noticed strange
man, armed and mounted, watching the house.
Fearing an attack, he called to man named Dobson,
who was unloading some lumber ut the river bank
q
together When they approached the stranger, he
called to Dobson to stand aside fired the sheriff.
and wheeling his horse, rode rapidly away The ball
broke Dr. Dinkgraves arm and entered his side, and
he died in few hours from the wound. His wife, who
is staying at Bethlehem in this State with her sister,
Mrs. Morey received the news of the shocking event
two DAYS ago. her friends having concealed IL from
her until she could be brought home from Cape
May where they at the time the first intelligence
came. She is completely prostrated with grief MI
Morey, who represents the district where tine
crime was committed, says it was undoubtedly per-
petrated by man sent from another parish under
the same system that prevailed in the days OF the
Knights of the White Cameha. That organization
is extinct but its work is being continued by the
numerous rite clubs forming all through the North
ern parishes for the purpose of intimidating the
blacks Men who were obliged to borrow money to
buy bread and meat TO subsst on while making n
crop"" manage IN some way to get possession of
the best improved arms. The clubs are in the habit
of marching in body TO Republican meetings.
They have committed no violence as yet, but the
presence of military force of hostile white men
AZ the gatherings of the blacks has of course, the
intended effect of terrifying them. The Republican
politicians are making earnest effort to have de-
tachments of United States troops sent to the dis
trcts where these rifle clubs operating for the
sake of the moral effect upon the community, and
unless this is done they fear the State will be lost
They can have 20 per cent of them vote, they say,
and still carry the election, but they do not mean to
have the whole coored vote stampeded, after the
Mississippi fashion, if they can help it, The Demo-
Gratis of Louisiana are, they believe copying closely
the tactics of their brethren in the adjoining State
and by refusing to employ the negroes or to make
advances on their crops il they vote the Republican
ticket by show of armed force by the murder OF a
few prominent men, and by some coaxng and
great deal of intimidation they intend to overcome
the Republican majority and get possession OF the
State Government. They care very little for the
Presidential election if they can get control OF the
State Administration and Legislature These state
rnents are made by men who have been identified
with the conservative wing Of the Republican party
in Louisiana and are entitled to respect."

The Uses Wf Saetrepolitans",,"In the case of Heintz vs. Lynch, hon.
est John Lynch, in the Sixth District
Court, the people have had an oppor
tunity to speak through jury concern
ing Metropolitan interference with the
rights of citizens.


The facts in the case, as shown by the
petitioners evidence, ETC., are as fol-
lows:


Lynch owned some property in Hurst
Vile, in the upper part of town, which
he leased to one Chas. HeiDtz. Together
with his family he went and lodged with
Heintz for several months and, as the
latter complained, neglected to pay his
board and lodging. Result. a suit for
1919 against Lynch. Lynch, in revenge,
called in those State troops, the Metro
politans, and dispossessed and effectu-
ally routed Heintz


Apparently Heintz did not like the in
reference OF the Metropolitans, re-
belled and brought a suit for. damages,
saying that his premises had been spoil
ated, his crops destroyed and disposed
of, and his goods generally injured and
destroyed. A jury, after hearing the
evidence returned O verdict against
Lynch for $500, thus showing the value
Of Metropolitan interference."

the city's right and duty to comply with
the decree which orders that no wharf
duties shall be levied upon vessels land

ished the hope that after the election
political discussion would subside, but
II seems that your correspondent p is so
thoroughly welded 10 sport of this XII. d
that it Is impossible for him to desist.
He has essayed to make the public be.
lieve that his communication was writ
ten prior 10 the election, but its whole
tenor and the fact that nearly three
weeks had elapsed before its publica-
tion show the contrary. Be this as il
may, he evidently shows an ardent de-
sire to keep the ""ball rolling"" for what
purpose | am unable state, unless
his self-conceit has been so inflated
by the oglIng of the Democratic
Ringsters that he thinks he can fright
en- the Returning Boards Of the South
ern States, as | understand great
hopes were built upon their fears. lie
continues in the same old strain, charg-
ing the Republican party with all man
ner OF evil, and cndeavors to refute nv
arguments by branding my statements
as stale calumnies, falsehoods and alb
surdities, without adduring n single
proof either of their falsehood or absur-
dity. Hold on P! Pause IN your mad
career! As you are fond of anecdote,
! will relate one that happened in old
st. Mary's in ante Geiium days. A
wealthy s!avc-owner was continually
. accusing his slaves Of stealing his to-
bacco, corn and wheat. One of them
took courage and asked his master how
they could steal from him when his
doors were all locked. why, you in
solent knave,"" replied his master, how
easy il would be for you to take a few
boards from the barn, and how easy YOU
could bore holes in the floor of nv corn
house and plug them when not in USE""
""lcs, but massa, what We gwine to do
wild 1t artcr VIC get :"" ""Out from
here, you worthless rogue. Do YOU
suppose | believe one word YOU saw !:
You know well enough tha. old -
will buy everything YOU bring him and
ask no questions"" The slaves held a
caucus, and concluded that as their mas
ter knew so well how TO steal that he
was not honest himself, and as they
were deemed guilty they had as well
steal. So the boards were taken of,
the holes made and plugged when not
IN use, and old - had frequent night
calls. Be cautious p. Be wary, oh We
hungry Office hunting democrats. Til
den may be declared elected, and as
Floyd and Thompson robbed the Gov
eminent they had sworn TO support and
boas'ed m the South that they had no,
left the Yankee Government"" dollar
TO begin with, so may some OF the Re-
publican officials, following such Illus
trious examples, excite the ri>ibie fac
ulties of their Northern neighbors bv
telling them how they deprived the
""rcbel administration"" OF the where
withal to feather its nest. A word to
the wise is sufficient. p SAYS. that in

Republican party ] have displayed

and justice are held in allowance"" In

that are in il also' IfPp proves this,
he places himself in a ridiculous cate

party is neither tuller nor more unqual-

comments ON Tilden and STYLES them as
rubbish. yet he lays great stress on
what he terms Republican inconsisten-
cies and quotes Carl Schmz's remarks
during the Greeley campaign. Mr..
Schurz. as well as MANY others who
were not witnesses 20 the numer-
ous outragcs perpetrated in the South
ern States, was slow to believe that civ.
ilized people could be guilty Of such
acts Of violence towards their fellow
men. But when Mr.. Schurz commit
ted the. political summersault ascribed
to him, Ne had not denounced Mr.. Hayes
and branded him as thief before bis
notninstlon and then made haste 70
canonize him Afterwards. And cod
concerning the remarks ascribed to Sem
ator Hale, p fails to inform the public
which Of the two parties was alluded to:
but be this as it may, it only serves to
show his misplaced confidence in the
Southern people, based upon their in
sincere professions of fidelity to the Con-
stitution and their civilized pretensions.
P says that 81 reiterate the stale calum-
nies against the South which he states


'have been refuted and branded as
false by the highest and most unim-
peachable authority"" His high au-
thority is the names of few ministers
Of the Gospel, a few bank Presidents
and Judges of the Courts. He claims
that ministers of the Gospel Of all de-
nominations denounce those charges as
untrue, but we fail TO find the Metho-
dist Episcopal church represented on
that list. This being the last stratagem
devised by the Democratic party prior
to the election, it was hoped that il
would do its work effectually: but what
ever OF merit il may be entitled to, a
dozen such ministerial commercial and
judicial memorials will fail to convince
the Intelligent public that ministers of
the Gospel and high officials are infal-
lible or that they never become political
partisans--for instance, Bishop Lynch,
one of signers OF tbs much esteemed
document, also signed one in 1861,
which stated that South Carolina was
peaceably inclined and had no intentions
to rebel. This when she was prepar-
ing her guns TO attack Fort Sum
ter. The notorious Moses was de-
nounced by the Democrats in the vilcst
manner and Chamberlain was lauded
to the skies for striving to prevent him
from becoming a member OF the Su-
prcme Court: but as soon as it became
apparent that Chamberlain codld not be
induced to espouse the cause of the
Democrats, they Withdrew their friend
ship from Chamberlain and centered
their affections upon Moses. brands
as false my statement that bands Of
armed rufiians were organized through
out the South to render the rights of
the negro of no avail, and SAYS that
those States passed all laws necessary
TO protect them in those rights. Now,
they passed only such laws as were
necessary To make their State laws ac-
cord with the Constitutional Amend
ments, and will say to r that while |
believe the statements OF Sheridan and
Chamberlain to be true. vet the most
convincing proof comes from Demo-
cratic sources. Hon. Reverdy johnson,
one of the retained defenders of the
ku-klux, denounced the enormitles
practised. by them in South Carolina
by saying, They are shocking TO hu-
manity; they admit neither of justifica-
tion nor excuse: they violate every OBJ
legation which law and nature impose
on man Representative Lamar said
concerning the Hamburg massacre -
"" Through all the uncertainty which
cXasperations and exaggcrations have
thrown around this subject, there Is one
fact which CLEANS out acknowledged.
or, il not acknowledged, is indisputable.
II is that body of white men did, with
out authority OF law put TO death a num-
ber of black men who had been taken
pri>oners-l mean who had been cap
tured and deprived OF their libcrty-but
who were not prisoners in the legal

The fact that Custer, though with the
expedition and nominally in command
OF his regiment. had no command what
ever until after Reno's return from his
fruitless scout OF the 20th has not been
made public. His regiment was divided
into two wings, the right under Reno
and the left under Benteen, while Gus

with his brothers and a few trusty men,
hunting and scounting on his own ac-

Generally he was with the advance,
but not in command. Two or three
times he was called upon to find passes
through bad lands or mountains, and
once Terry said no other officer but Gus
ter could have conducted the command
through the difficulties, which seemed
insurmountable, so successfully. On
the morning OF June %, for the first

those who knew him do not wonder he
tried to make the most out Of it, and
staked all In an attempt to conquer the
Sioux without assistance.

which were under his immediate com

Who're Five Hundred Trains Pass


Daily.


Railroad men throughout the country
say that the Broad street crossing of the
Pennsylvania and Central Railroad of
New Jersey in Elizabeth is the most dan
gerous to be found in the United States.
Since the lst of June Of this year five hun
dred trains Lave passed this point daily.
The crossing is guarded neither by gates
nor furnished with bridge for pedestrians
to pass over in safety, yet fewer fatal acci-
dents have happened there than at any
other station along those two great arteries
of travel. The managers, while acknowl-
edging that these additional safeguards are
badly needed, say that trey can get along
without them, as long as Pat Lynch lives
Pat has been the signal and switch-tender
at this crossing for eleven years, and dur
ing that time has saved the lives Of thirty
persons and has prevented, at the risk Of
his own life, innumerable collisions Of
trains. As the railroad people say, ""he is
worth his weight IN gold"" Old as he is
he is always at his post Of danger, near the
middle of the crossing, or in the little sig
nal-box, from 7 o'clock in the morning
until o'clock at night. He knows about
all the conductors, engineers, tiremen and
orakemen on the myriad oftrains that pass
and repass daily, and knows to a second
when they are due. He attends to the sig
nails, has them thrown into the right posi-
tion for danger or safety at the right time,
looks to the switches and takes his position
to warn pedestrians as the trains roll by
him. A single misstep or the loss Of pres
ence Of mind for minute during the early
part of the day, when train after train in
quick succession, is laundering along
loaded with passengers for the metropolis
or westward bound, would send him beneath
the wheels Of 4 locomotive. His precision
and coolness in the presence Of danger are
apparent when it is taken into considera-
tion that it frequently happens that thir-
teen trains arrive at this crossing within
fifteen minutes, or almost at the rate OF
train a minute, all of which have to he
properly signalled and the crossing looked
after, and only he to do it.

the regular passenger trains which run by

""extras"" have been added, many of which
are run by sections, and these have to be
looked after as they come and go at all
times, great precautions have to be taken
to guard against collisions. Besides these

LONDON, March 14th.-The gale of
Sunday was very violent and destruct-
i've around the entire coast. Numer-
Gus shipping casualties are reported.
An unknown brigantine was seen to
founder off Portland at midday; all
hands were lost. The sea was running
tremendously high and it was fmpos-
sible to send aid. The telegraphs
throughout the country are still de-
ranged and communication is slow
and difficult. The weather continues
unsettled. In France telegraphic COM
munication was deranged to an un-
precedented extent. In Paris roofs,
chimneys and trees were blown down
or carried away. Numerous casualties
are reported, some fatal. Damages in
the districts flooded by rivers are
greatly increased in consequence Of
the gale. Numbers of undermined
houses on the Seine were blown down.
The gale was also violent on the
French coast.

snow plows and one engine are in the
ditch at different places. The storm
has abated, but the wind has not yet

Bedell, the fireman who was injured
this morning, died from the effects of
his injuries. His leg was literally
crushed to jelly between the tender

out soon with proper care. The Com

Messrs. Irelan. Taylor, McGlinchy,
Paynter, Adams, Jones, Underwood,
and Febiger were present. Mr.. Ford
was absent, but afterwards came in.
The Council was called to order by
the President. and Clerk Lee called
the roll.


Mr.. Febiger moved that a Commit
tee be appointed to examine the re-
turns of the Inspectors and report the
result of the election. Adopted Com
mitteee, Messrs. Febiger, Jones and
Paynter.


The Committee retired and after
half hours absence reported the result
of the election (as already published)
and that the following gentlemen were
elected members of Council.


First Ward-Thumas johnson.


Second Ward Benz i. Townsend.


Third Ward-Caleb T. Windle.

years H +. Pickles for one year.
Sixth Ward-Seth H. Feaster.
Seventh Ward-Philemma Chandler
Eighth Ward-Henry w. Downing
Ninth Ward-John g. Davis.
Tenth Ward-Louis p. Lynch.


Mr.. Febiger stated that the Second
Ward Republican tickets mad been
printed with the name of the candidate
for Inspector in the place of the candi-
date for Assistant Inspector, and that
therefore VIM. l.. Countiss was select.
ed Assistant Inspector, instead of Jas.

The report of the Committee was
adopted, after which, ON motion of
Mr. Febiger. the members.elect, eX.

were qualified by the Mayor. On
entering the Council chamber they
were greeted with a faint applause,
which the chair promptly suppressed.

and the Clerk called the roll


President Lichtenstein then spoke as
follows:


GENTLEMEN OF COUNCIL 1T is not
only proper but wise, that the managers
OF large corporation at the beginning
OF a new year should closely examine the
state of their finances, should clearly
understand the debit and credit sides oil
their ledger, SO as to be able to faithful
ly perform the duties they have pledged
their honor to perform. From the City
Treasurer books, / learn that at this
day. after the bulk of the taxes has been
received there is no money left in the
treasury, while notes sof some $50, 500
have to be provided for. Moreover, there
are $4,000 due the Cool Spring Reservoir
=. 900 for interest, the orders for which
have been drawn, also S1,700 for Re
demption of Bonds, making a total Of
S52. 200. You will, theref Jre, perceive
that this Council begins its operations
with $50, 900 less than nothing.


The current expenses for four more
| months before the close OF our fiscal year,
will have to be provided for. A large
amount will be needed to pay for paying
| of Walnut street, the contracts for which
have been signed, unless the contractor
should decide to have this work delayed
until we are letter prepared to pay. As
an Offset, Gentlemen, you have only what
may be collected of the balance of city
taxes, and from the books of the City
Auditor.


Gentlemen, this que stion is very Sc
rious and difficult to solve. If | can draw
a lesson from yesterdays election, it is
that our citizens desire an economical
administration of their afairs-that
Council should not continue their trod-
den path-but retrench, yes gentlemen

nations.


| The Miscellaneous Pay Roll for one
year amounted to S17, ,439,S3, reduction
OF $4,000 will not diminish applications
for the positions by equally qualified per-
sons.


The Street Cleaning Department has

Monday, S24 800. Gentlemen, q saving
af S12, 900 can be made here, and yet the
streets canI be kept as clean as they are
kept to-day.


| The Water Department proper has cost

of $1,000.


Add $4,000 for the Board of Public
Education, and $40 900 for Street and
Opening Streets appropriations, and you
have total of SAL 900. 1t is not improb-
able that reduation of 50. 1000 may be
made from the other appropriations, and
we foot up $4,000. Continuing faithfully
in this matter for two years, we will be
enabled to sink the present floating debt
into oblivion without having recourse
to the favorite mode Of funding. Then,
gentlemen, you may have the satisfac-
tion of reducing taxation, and do you
suppose that the citizens will think of
changing government that honestly
and faithfully attends to the city inter
est! You are aware gentlemen, that
manufacturing establishments form the
growth and prosperity of city all over
this broad land of ours, you may see the
evidence, that wherever such establish
ments.are fostered and protected, pros
perity has been general; our own little
city is no exception. If we are success

the expense, as he doubtless deemed it, of

albeit Republican, and whom he and his
party have been unable to supplant in Con-
gress, even through the medium ofa stuffed
ballot. The ""verdancy"" of the Indcz
has, however, in the concluding paragraphs
of the article we havo quoted, furnished
the public with the motives which i'm
PEELED this legislative committee in the
commission Of their dlscourteous act.
Suppose that Stowell, being invited, had
""opened with TRADE that immigration
""would never come into Virginia so long
Gas the Kuklux. White-Liners, lynch
claw, rebel jurics and other like institu-
""tions were in vogueS The cause Of i'm
emigration would not be materially ad-
""vanced by such performance"" In other
words, we are 10 infer, and the inference IS
a legitimate one, that lest the truth be told
these gentlemen who profess to be so
earnest in their efforts to people the State
with immigrants and q mode of inducing
the coveted immigration be pointed out,
that might endangcr Locofoco supremacy
in Virginis, by causing an influx Of North
erners into her borders. Lest all this might
happen, they preferred to begin in the CON-
mittee with the ostracism they propose to
continue, and which has been 30 fully at
tested by Republicans in that latitude ever
since the war.


1t has not been our purpose in this arti-
Gle so much to defend Representative
Stowell, he being abundantly able to do
that himself, as to place the facts in connec-
tion with this Virginia immigration move
ment before the public. If it be the pur-
pose Of the dominant party in that State to
ignore, ostracise and perSecute the Northern
Republican settler, the sooner the fact be.
comes known the better it will be for all
concerned. If, ON the other hand, they de-
sire that kind Of immigration that will
speedily build up their waste places. it is
well for them to comprehend the fact that
a more liberal policy than they have ex-
hibitcd may be insugurated. When men
of the North who honestly entertain Re.
publican sentiments can feel sure that they
will not only be tolerated. but fully pro-
tected in the expression Of their opinions
at the ballot box, and whom social ostra-
cIsm for political opinion sake shall cease,
then will Virginia obtain the influx of pop
ulation she so sorcly needs, but not until
then; and it is due the people Of that State
that they should know it, To compass so
desirablo an end, papers of the class to
which the Inde=-Appsag belongs should
be ''squelched"" or their editors be re.
strained from their blatant utterances by
a wholesome public sentiment."

city few weeks since for the osteusible
purpose of comforting with the Virginia

of immigration to that State. To this con-

district Of that State, and from which a
healthy regard for the rublic sentiment of
the nation will compel his cicctmeut and
the seating of Colonel Platt when the sub
jcct comes before the House for its action.
With regard to Mr.. Stowen there could be
no such frivolous p:ctext. He is in pos
session of q scat in Congress, TO which he
was elected by an overwhelming majority
Of the voters Of the Fourth district, and in
a moral point Of view is fully the peer OF
any one of his Virginia colleagues. In
note addressed to the Fredericksburg (Va.)
Star, called forth by an editorial in that
paper deprecating his absence from the
meeting, Mr.. Stowell says: II was not
present because l was not invited, and
mot invited because was not wanted,
and not wanted because I was Repub-
""ican. No one is moro favorable to im-
migration than myself, and no one can
feel the need of it more than the North

GeuiGs its existence. Hear il:


1--WE desire to put ON record our deliberate
judgment that the committee acted exactly
right, If, as is supposed, It dccliucd to invite
S!owcll 10 take part in the conference. That
Republicans favorable to the cause Of immf-
grafton were not ignored, appears from the
fact that Colonel I'd. Daniels, late editor of
the S'a'e Jcsrra' was Eot nuly in attendance,
but took an active rari in the deliberations OF
The session. But to have asked StuWcl to
take any part in the exercises of the occasion
would have been piece OF folly and farce of
whit We hope the committee was not guilty.
SICwCn is ia 10 sense All honest immigrant to
Virginia.; OWLS no property here. though it Is
alleged that lie has money on dCposit in BOs-
ton: has no defined residence. and in the late
conference Of Virginia Republicans at Rich

Thus it is not even known were the creature

cnte, such as it il, is malign to Virginia and
Fr=r l.,l, l. ~.
ostracism, intimidation, persecution AMI vio-
lercc are to be expected by any Northern man
who makes his home IN Virginia. What, in
the name OF common sense, was the Use Of in
yitinc su:h lying partisan to lend any help
ing hard 10 the immigration movement? Sup
pose nOw-and nothing was more likely-that
Stowell, being invited, had opened with a
tiradc that immigration would never come
into Virginia so long as the ku-Klux, 'Whito
Liners lynch Law, rebel iuries, and other like
institutions, were in vogue? He is fully capa-
bic of that or any other infamy. The Star
VIII concede that the cause of immigration
would not be materially advanced by such
performance. On the whole, for the various
ICG: ons alleged, and for others that might be
stated, we conclude that the committee did
well in not expecting Mr. Stowell 20 be
rrCscnt.""


Exactly why the late editor OF the State
Journal was in attendance docs not appear,
bc ing neither member OF the Legislative
Committee, from which all Northern men
we've studiously excluded, nor member
Of Congress. Report has it that he is far
from indisposed to sell his OWN property
in Virginia, and lie may have adopted the
method of getting into this committee
meeting, whether invited or otherwise is
immaterlal. TO compass this end. In any
event, the opinion of Mr.. Daniels, whether
expressed in committee or through the
public prints, is that Of but one man, and
oan by no possibility outweigh the other
wise unanimous sentiment of Northern
Republican settlers in Virginia, nor even
the justification by the rebel sheet from
which We quote. of the conduct pursued
toward the representative of Republican
constituency by this Locofoco committee.
Just what constitutes ''an honest emigrant
TO Virginia"" this organ of Looofocoism does
not deign to inform its readers. but we hap
pen to know that Mr.. Stowell went to
Virginia with more thousands than the
diminutive upstart who essays to cnlighten
the people Of Virginia through his Indcr,
and whose consuming vanity is as offensive
to good taste as 1t is to well-bred people,
ever possessed in hundreds; and further,
that he (StowelD succeeded in the course
of legitimate and honest mercantile Ca
recr in losing all his means among people
whose organs would now drive him, il
they could. from the State. for the crime of
being Republican. That he has no prop
crty there proves his honesty, and his
inability to pay the taxes hcaped upon the
people by Locofoco Legislature. If the
want of property should exclude a man
from position. even that Of mem
Der Of Congress, several OF yfrginiss
present Representatives would be COM
PEELED to take back seats. Nobody should

handed in his resignation to the Pres
ident, to take effect July lst, next.


The Facts.


New ORLEANS, June 23.-It now
transpires that the five negroes lynch
ed by the regulators at Port Hudson
last week were the joint per-
petrators of the Mount Pleasant
plantation outrage, who were taken

charged the crime on parties from
Mississippi.

given. Crooks telegraphed for addi-
tional troops. Several companies are
under orders to join him at once.


TiIden the First Choice.


NEW YORK, June 23d.-A special
from st. Louis says Tilden is the most
prominent candidate. Ohio is split

MIR. Farrell said the question is to
raise money, and now is the time and
the place to do it. To morrow night
report from Council. Money can be
raised without the members incurring
any responsibility.
Mr.. Febiger agreed with Mr.. Payn.
ter that the occasion was too important
for hasty action. 1t ought to be con-
sidered whether these ideas for raising
money can be made legally effective.
Capital cannot be obtained ON meagre
security and we must not rush this
thing through without consideration.

should be settled quickly. What are

Mr.. Farrell said the result of the
pending vote would determine wheth-
er the men were to work or steal.
Mr.. Febiger said this was not the
truth. He would vote nay on the mo.
tion.

Council and the Workingmsn
The PLEA FOR WORK CONSIDERED
WORK ON THE RESERVOIR


TO BE COMMENCED.",,"roRr-woRK ON THE REESE RvoIR TO


DE STARTED ON MONDAY MORNING


THE ISSUE OF CITY WARRANTS RECON.


MENDED,


The City Council held u special
meeting, last evening, Mr.. McIntire in
the chair.


Mayor Whiteley stated that he had
called this special meeting at the
request of five members-Messrs
Martin Farrell, r. Il. Taylor. Isaac Z.
Pyle, ]. Il. Adams, VIM. McMenamin,
for the purpose OF taking action upon
the resolutions passed at the meeting
of workingmen held the previous
evening.


Mr.. Farrell stated that the chairmen
of the committee appointed at the
meeting TO present resolutions to
Council was in the chamber, desiring
to present the resolutions, and moved
that he be heard. Adopted.


Mr. Myles Burke, the chairman of
the committee referred to, in openin 6
his remarks, said the papers had stat ed
that he was no workingmcn, but a
storekeeper, and had no right to be at
the meeting. He admitted being
storekeeper, but thought it question
whether the store kept him or he kept
the store. He was also workingman
and was not ashamed of it. His name
had recently been on the city pay rolls,
and he hoped it would soon be seen
there again. He then presented the
resolutions, which he hoped would re-
ceive favorable consideration.


nlnrk mad tho rnsnlutinns
when.


Mr.. Farrell moved that the rcsolu-
tions be adopted and referred to a
special committee of five, with power
to act.


Mr.. Taylor questioned if it was pro-
per to adopt the resolutions, as they
did not belong to Council, but came
from outside citizens.


Mr.. Farrell thought that Parliamen>
tary tactics might be reserved on this
occasion. The workingmen are inter-
estcd in the adoption, by Council, of
these resolutions, and this is why he
made his motion.


Mr.. Taylor said it would be more
properly in order to refer the resolu>
tions to o committee ana receive re-
port thereon.


Mr.. Paynter inquired what was
meant by the ""power to act"" cont lined
in Mr.. Farrell's motion.
Mr., Farrell-The committee will
give the information at the requisite
time.


MIR. Febiger repeated Nj. Paynter's
question, he wanted to know what Mr.. i.
Farrell desired in asking fer the COM
mittee ""power 10 act""
MIR. Farrell replied that the case was
one of hardship to the workingmen.
Every day we hesitate increases this
hardship. Therefore refer the subject
to a specia! committee, and let them
determine what they can do in order
to better the condition of affairs. If all
other suggestions fail let the basin real
estate he mortgaged in order to raise
money to continue the work.


Mr.. Taylor insisted that it would
be better to refer the subject to the
committee and have report.


Mr.. Farrell, not wishing to split
hairs, expressed his Willingness to
qualify his motion by making it ""that
the resolutions be recei0ed and referred
to a special committee of five, with
power to act""


Mr.. Febiger moved as an amend
ment to strcke from the motion the
words with power""


Mr.. Farrell accused MIR. Febiger of
a desire to retard work all he could,
and for purpose-the benefit of the
Republican party.


MIR. Lynch favored the reference OF
the resolutions to committee with
instructions to report at this meeting.
If he had the power he would put the
men to work at once spend the money
for current expenses Oh the reservoir,
create o floating debt and let the Legs
islature fund it,.


Mr.. Taylor favored placing the res
ervoir work in the hands of commits
sioners, as long as there are two parties
eneof them will want to take advantage
of this work.


| MIR. Farrell admitted that he was
pecuniarily interested in the matter OF
the workingmen getting employment
so is every business man in the com.
munity. He was not candidate fol
re: ELECTION.


Mr.. Febiger said it had been charged
that men had been working on the
reservoir who were not residents of the
ClJy. Also InaI UOyS, nOJ representing
FAMILIES had been employed at $15
per day, and that one of these boys was
a son of one of the most important
officers of the City Government who
received large salary. Mr.. Farrell
as q member of the Water Committee
must have known this, and yet he pro.
tested not against it. Does this look like
having an interest in the benefit of the
workingmen of our city!


Mr.. Febiger was proceeding to refer
to the working of the laborers employ.
ed in pipe laying by the late Chief
Engineer (Mr. Hyde) when Mr.. Farrell
raised poiLt of order that he was not
i, speaking to the question.


The chair stated that he had allow
ed other gentlemen wide range, and
would not care to decide the point
well taken unless it was pressed.


Mr.. Febiger then proceeded to say
that he could not vote to give five mer
power to do what they choose, with
out the knowledge Of Council.


Mr. Lynch offered as another"

|fsWAsH1NGToN, Feb. 10.-The following
case was submitted in the United States
Supreme Court yesterday:


| al. Shipley ct al. W. Cowan ct al. Err.


ror to the Supreme Court of Missouri
This was suit In equity, commenced by one
Mcpherson, and continued by the plaintiff
In error his executors, to divest the title o.
defendants, who claim the lands in dispute


under patent from the United States, anC
pre- -emption by one Chartrand Mode in 1885


and continued by his SONS in 1S46, up te


1896, when the patent was issued to them


as heirs. The Mcpherson claim is based on


location made by officers of the United


States in favor of the State of Missouri, ano


a patent of the State made under an act o.


Congress of September, 1841. The Court


below held that the State location was void
-Ibecause the land was specially reserved by
act of Congress, and the State Department
had so Instructed its officers at vt. Louis
that it twas reserved from sale on entry o.
any kind to satisfy the village of Carondelet
under the acts of June, 1919, and May
1894"" The bill was dismissed, and 1t II
here urged that the decision was erroneous
Ebecause 1t was not established on the tria
that the village of Carondelst ever filed an!


claim to commons, such as to make 1t tn


subject of reservation. -.
The defendants in error maintain the cor
rectness Of the Judgment below, but submit
that as both parties to the suit claim undel
indepenent legal titles, wholly adverse. d


each other, therefs no equitable Jurisdiction

Col. Febiger then read a statement which
he claimed to have been copied from the
books of the City Treasurer, which showed
statement similar to that read by Mr..
Hayes at the last meeting. LIS, r,t


Mr.. McIntire stated, that in addition to
the items forced on This Council, by the laet
body, was one Of $9, SOS A for improvements
to the City Hall, which should not be laid
at the door. Of this body. ..


On motion Council went into an election
for committee to nominate a Board of
Health, when the following were chosen:
Messrs. Irelan, McIntire, McGliuchey,
Paynter, Murphey, McMenamin, w. NJ.
Canby, Downing, Farrell and Lynch
q Mr.. Farrell arose to personal explena-
tiop. He said that the eK-chairman of the
Water Committee, at the last meeting of
Council, had declared that bic had resigned
his position in Council because he had been
baffled in his attempts to leconomize. In
support of his theory Mr. Hayes had educed
. mass of figures to impress, the minds of
the people that the Democratic members Of
Couacil were squandering the city's money
He, Mr.. H., had also accused Mr.. Farrell
of coalescing with the Republican members
of Council in order to defeat measures Of
economy which he had introduced. Mr..
Farrell said hs de6ed any man 10 that
chamber to mention time Or an act of his
in which he ever asked man to vote for q
measure since he had been member. The
only coalition he ever knew of was at the
last meeting of Council when Republicans
and Democrats alike united In passing an
ordinance giving the poor working men
81 10 per day for their hard-earned labor,
which Mr.. Hayes had deprived them
Of. But, on the contrary, Mr.. Farrell
knew that the gentleman r.. who has
inst retired lngratiated himself into the
favor of the Independent Republicans of
the last council, and Induced them to re-
cognize him as leader of the Democratic
party and procured for himself the respon-
sible (?) position of Chairman Of the Com
mittee on Bonds. Again, when the time
came for the election Of IN Actuary to the
City Treasurer, Mr.. Hays united with the
Republicans against Democrat, and there
by secnred his election. Mr.. Farrell claim
ed that he had always acted IN an honora-
BILE and upright manner, and for the sole
benefit of the city. On every committee of
which he is chairman, he scrutinizes every
bill presented, so as to see that not penny
shall be paid that ought not to be, and as
long as he holds the poAti61s he does, he
shall continue to act ig tho game upright
manner as before AS for Mn Hayes, just
before resigning, he produces 4 mass Of
figures, intending to cast stigma upon
the party that fostered him. He. tried to
make people believe that be was an econo-
mist, and in doing so, produced figures
which were simply untruths. Col. Febiger,
he said, produced mass of fgnres pro-
duced from an intensely partison paper
and offers them In evidence against
the statement of officers of the city.
Mr.. Farrell continued at some length, show.
ing conclusively that the record Of the
Democratic members of the Council since
they came into power last September has
been that of honest, conscientious men
working for the interest of the city.


After rambling debate between Messrs.
Febiger and Farrell, the debate closed.


3 On motion of Mr.. Psynter the petition of
Joseph Dennis was referred to the commit
tee, with power to act.


During the evening orders were directed
to be drawn as follows: 1T. Lungren

The Law Committee reported several or.
dinances in conformity with the city char
ter. ~ .. p.
Mr.. McIntire, from the special committee
to inquire into irregularities in the Water
Department, had letter read from Mr..
Charles Burton, Jr., asking postponemept
Of his report as owing to his continued III
ness he had not been enabled to make the
examination he wished to. He also stated
that from his statement the city was in debt
to him $500. The committee was con-
tinued one week. n gNetnIleE


The City Treasurer reported sa8, $40 In

voir; SIC, ,487 48 to the credit Of current ex-
penses; for the redemption of bonds, 500,

The Street Commissioner reported 68 men
and II horses and carts in the employ OF
that department. q ! Q ( n
Chief Engineer Ruth, of the Water De-
partment, reported 195 men and S6 horses
and carts inythe employ Of that department.
! On the reading of the Water Department
pay roll, Mr.. Febiger objected to Mr.. H. B.
McIntire, general foreman Of the Cool
Spring Reservoir, receiving $500 per day
as he is q foreman, and the ordinance pass
ed last meeting makes the pay of foreman
$200 per day. 3'.a- '. ~


,Messrs. Farrell and Paynter took differ
ent view of the matter, on the ground that
Mr.. McIntire held the position Of a super
intendent, and was entitled to more than an
ordinary foreman. ~"" ."" ..2,a q


Mr.. Farrell, to put the matter beyond .
doubt moved to strike out the words gen.
eral foreman and insert superintendent


Col. Febiger suggested that If ordinances
! were allowed to be circumvented in that
/ manner, the Water Committee Gould desig.
nate all the laborers shovellers or pickers,
and pay them higher wages.


The chairman stated that in bis opinion,
1t would take an amendment to the ordi-
nance passed last meeting to pay Mr.. Nc
Intire more than $500 per day, and SO de-
cided the amendment out of order.


Mr.. Farrell appealed from the decision OF
the chair. r. -'
On the question ""Shall the decision Of
the chair be sustained"" the following was
the vote:


Yeas-Messrs, Adams, VIM. Candy, Down
ing, Febiger, Jones and Underwood-6.
Nays-Messrs, Bickts, w. M. ...Canby, Far
rell, Irelsn, Lynch, Murphy, McMenamin,
Nc Glinchey, Psynter, Pyle and Taylor-1l


The appeal was therefore not sustained.
MI. Farrell's motion was then passed
and the pay roll passed as 1t stood.


The following petitions were read and re-
ferred. ~


From John Jordan, asking that Clay
mont street be graded and paved, from A
to Lobdell street: from VIM. Mccullough,
asking that William street between A and
Lobdell streets be graded and paved; from
Edward jackson, asking that water be in
troduced in Eighth street, between Madf-
son and Monroe; from w. G. Sruance,
stating that E. L. Rice, Jr., had put bill
against the city into his hands, for collec-
tion, and asked the city to allow their So
licitor to refer the matter to referees; from
Lindley Pierce, asking that Elliot street be
curbed and paved; from James Thompson
asking that water pipe be introduced into
Orange street, between Twelfth and Thir-
teenth; from Rochus Nessick, asking to
have 81 refunded him for error in grading;
from Caleb Milborn, asking Council to
name street running from Scott to Dupont
and between Seventh and Eighth streets, af-
ter him, as he owned two lots on It.


An ordinance making an additional ap-
preparation to the Fire Committee was read
twice. r..
An ordinance allowing Geo. W. Dorsey
to tap the main at Twentieth and Market
streets was read third time and passed.
Mr.. McMenamin stated that former
member of Council, at the last meeting,
made statement Of the expenditures and
receipts of the city for the last seven
months, which was 90 grossly inaccurate
that he procured statement from the
City Trea surer, City Auditor and the
Registrar of the Water Department, so as
to have them correct, and begged leave to

In the October elections, the same
party will carry Mississippi. In
the latter event, the Republicans
will be so disheartcned that they
will make very little effort to Sc. :

city Budget.",,"To meet the expenses OF the city FOR
the current year without incurring the
necessity OF issuing scrip or any other

attention OF our City Administrators just
now. The condition OF the city, finan-
cially, so far as this year is concerned,
IL, that at the rate of the present month
ly expenditures, as compared with
it's income, it will show deficit by
the first OF January, 1877, OF

to obviate it, The situation, how
ever, is far from being desperate.
The first remedy proposed. Is that which
eschews all favorable contingencies and
computes with sordid facts and figures
-retrenchment; by decreasing the
ducing the salaries OF those retained,
and those OF the Administrators them
selves, twenty five per cent. This 1t
is reported will be reached by a
reduction in the expenses OF the
Department OF improvements amount
ing to $l08,000 for the remaining SIX
months OF the year, and to $53,0OO
In the other six departments. 1t Is the
opinion Of Mr.. Pilsbury, the Admins
traitor of Finance, that this reduction OF
over $40, 900 ""a month can be effected
without much difficulty, and the exigen-
cies OF the budget complied with. The
second proposition involves the closing
of the free markets. 1t isalso the opin,
ion OF Mr.. Pilsbury that, in the event
these markets are closed, the city Will
be enabled to obtain S50O,00O for its
| markets on a lease of two years. Or this
amount $4,000 is entered on the
budget-pledged to the late fiscal
agent-leaving surplus OF 100000, to
be added to the credit side OF the budget
thus reducing the deficit to S6l 900
which will be easily supplied.


In such case the hardshlps whicf
might otherwise result to the employees
Of the city will be greatly modified, ant
it is barely possible that there may b'
no reduction Of employees or salaries a
all.


The wharf question is in statu quo, ow

groes were purchasing unusual quant-


ties Of buckshot. w. ID. Sprott, also, a


white man notoriously obnoxious TO the


white people, and Of an intolerant, ma
lignant disposition, was suddenly and


without occasion, appointed Deputy


United States Marshal. The day pre-
ceding the disturbance he was closeted


for nearly an hour in a room adjoining


the writer's with two prominent Repnb-


licans. One OF these, that night, called


the writer into the same room and re-


marked: s'There is going to be a diff

now see how consistent DR. Sprotts' de-

fore and on the Dist Of October.

Williams, and numerous other were ex-
amined on oath. All of those witnesses
are negroes, most of whom were captured
with guns in their hands. Their evl
dence discloses facts, that not only give
the lie to the above, but proves w. ID.
Sprott bold conspirator against the
public peace, and a dangerous malefdc-
tor Further, they confirm the belief
that the troubles Of the 2lst were Instl-
gated by him in pursuance Of plot pre-
arranged.


The above named witnesses state
g that, at the instance Of DIR. SprOtt,
two meetings were held at the residence
of James Page"" the negro ex-County
Treasurer, where all the measures were
discussed and plans arranged. Both
meetings were held with closed DOORS
guards being placed at them to shut out
intruders. At the first meeting, which
was held about the Sth inst, James Page
told them he had been directed by DIR.
Sprott, who had been appointed Deputy
u. S. Marshal, to instruct them to bring
their guns to the barbecue. Companies
were organized, John Speilman, who is
now in jail, and Dallas jackson, being
elected captains; and Singleton's lane,
about two miles from town, was designa
ted the place of rendezvous, The second
meeting was held Thursday night, the
18th of October, when the same instruc-
tions were given, and letter from Sprott
was read authorizing them to bring their
arms"" Phoebe, the wife of James Page,
told the writer, in the presence of several
witnesses, that she could and would pro
duce Sprott's note. And James Page,
himself said to Captain DeCourcy, the
officer in command of the United States
garrison stationed here, that g if Sprott
denies it he is damned liar.


The negroes, on the morning of the
were met by the sheriff about
TWO miles from town. They were
armed, end had been going through the |
manual. After consultation with Page, /
he latter agreed to disband his men, and
o conduct them, without their arms, to |
he speaking. 4"" While we"" say the |
lbove witness, ''were hiding our guns,
Dr.. Sprott, carrying his gun on his |
high, rode up and said: Boys, | am
Marshal, and if you do not carry your
runs to the grounds with you, | will not |

tarted a second time towards town. DR..
Sprott picked twenty-six men, and sent
hem forward as an advance guard, with
to fire on any white man
Who intertered With them. About one
nile from town we met Ed. Jones, who
old us that if we carried our guns into
own we would be cut to pieces; Jim
'age advised us to lay aside our arms;
Without saying word, Sprott rode off
owards his house; we went on to the
arbecue grounds, where Lynch told US
e would not speak; Thomas Richardson
lade few remarks, advising us to reg
ster promptly, and then we started back
0 the place where We left cur guns. The
heriff was the only white man on the
rounds, and he told US he could and
'ould keep the peace we all had buck
hot, and our guns were loaded with the

1t now appears how much truth there

Surely Sprott does not pretend that he

unsatisfactory account of the affair and
leads to the impression that the negroes
were lynched.

o'clock, a young white man named Clay
ton Allen, aged twenty, and Theodore
Baker, also white, were riding out of the
village of Lowndesville, about eleven
miles from the county seat of Abbeyille,
together. They had not proceeded far
before they were fred upon by party of
and Alien was instantly killed, pierced
by six musket balls. Baker was severely
wounded by small shot, but escaped with
his life. The negroes belonged to one of
the State militia companies, and were
armed with the rifles belonging to the
State. The murder took place on pub
lie street in Lowndesville, in front of the
Presbyterian church.


The reports of the rifles attracted sew
eral persons to the spot, and when it was
found that Allen was killed, the alarm

following extracts from a letter just pub
lished by Prof. W. G. Sumner, of Yale Col.
lege, on Louisiana affairs. He was one of
the Democratic committee who went to
New Orleans, and his letter simply reflects
the partisan views of the committee. 1t
may be proper to add that Prof. Sumner,
though one of the faculty OF Yale College,
had little or no support either amongst
the faculty or the students in his conclusion
to support Mr.. Tilden; from ex-President
Woolsey down to the freshman class the
voice was strongly against him. This is
what he says


The election was held under complicat-
ed and elaborate corps of State officials, ap-
pointed by the State Government, and free
from any of those popular checks which
we, in the North, regard as essential to
self government. The efforts of the press
and che party committees to obtain infor-
nation were treated as impertinent 1t was
furthermore necessary, inasmuch as the
ruling party did not publish returns Except
as hereafter stated and did not, therefore,
either deny or accede to the Democratic re-
ports, to fortify these latter by certificates
in manner totally unknown in the North.





experience of 1872 and 1876 took, as 1t ap
pears, energetic measures to secure trust
worthy returns, duplicates of the returns
sent to the Returning Board. have before
me detailed statement by parishes Of the
returns which were received as a result of
the efforts of the Democratic Committee,
with memoranda of the authority on which
each parish return is based. Allowing for
possible errors of detail, this statement es.
tablishes a moral certainly that Governor
Tilden carried the State by 1900 majority
according to the returns. l met no persons
in Louisiana (and mixed as freely as pos
slble with persons of all classes and both
parties), who denied or doubted that this
was the true result of the election. 1 was
told that the Republican newspapers had
published returns from thirty or forty par
ishes, coinciding with those in the Demo-
cratic statement, but had then desisted,
declaring that the returns were
incorrect and unsatisfactory. met
no person whatever who admitted any
other hypothesis than that the Returning
Board would bring out Republican ma.
jority. 1t was not discussed; it was as
sumed as of course. 1 heard abundant
complaints of outrages, &c, against ne
groes who voted the Democratic ticket, and
l talked with a number Of persons who had
such complaints to make. l also resolutely
pureued all possible inquiries within my
reach to try to find out the truth. In
conversation which a number of us held
with Governor Kellogg, he was asked for
facts under this head. He cited the case
OF Gaid only. Gaid was killed by lynching,
under circumstances of revolving injustice,
in September, 1875. Politics had nothing
to do with it, much less this election. 1t is
fair to say that our interview was cut short,
and Mr. Kellogg got no further with his re-
cital. Other charges of outrage which l
heard or cav we're intangible and uncertain.
| could not bring any of them to distinct
shape. ALI of them were denied, and es-
pecially the broad and general descriptions
of systems OF intimidation were energeti-
cally denied by men of unquestionable
character and integrity.


The election law is intricate, and while
apparently adapted to provide for all con-
tingencies, really creates a hundred tech
nicalities and machinery which renders
really popular elections impossible. The
play of its various parts allows scope for
fraud, chicanery and abuse. 1t depends
upon the action of an army of officials, ma
ny of whom are far away from any control
and free from all responsibility, while they
are able to defeat the whole purpose of the
election by corrupt or malicious asser-
ton. The ingenuity with which devices
are planned and practiced for producing
fraudulent results is simply dabolical. The
party in power having control Of this ma.
chinery, can make any election mockery,
and the community finds itself locked in
network OF crafty arrangements from
which escape seems impossible.


l saw negro presidents of negro Demo-
cratic clubs. When asked why they had
formed or Joined these clubs, they replied
that they were sick of the confusion and
misery of the country. They thought that
the promises made to them had not been
kept. They complained especially that they
had no schools. and that the school funds
were embezzled. They said that tie DEM
ocrats made fair promises, and they were
disposed to try them. Colored men made
speeches to this effect through the disputed
parishes. l saw and read an original speci-
men of circular issued by the Republican
committee to the State Supervisors of cleo
tion, in which the person addressed is or
dered to bring up the Republican vote of
his parish to certain figure, and is told
that his recognition by the future State ad
ministration will depend on the fidelity and
success with which he does this. 1t is
claimed that polls we're established at the
last moment, or in out-of-the way places and
we're not opened before the hour appointed.
In New Orleans sewing-machine circular
was sent through the Post Office to voters
who had registered. These circulars were
often misdlrected in some way or other, 30
that they were returned ""not found""
Each one had a registration number on it,
and the person who held that number was
struck from the list and warrant for his
arrest issued, but not served. The cases
we're recorded in book, but the evidence
circular was attached to the warrant. A
volunteer committee indexed the book and
published the names, and after long exer-
! tion succeeded in getting back the warrants

passengers were formed into line and the name. or'h
place and destination of each newcomer registered
This work was oftentimcs accompanied by more u'i-
cutics than first appears on account OF the different
languages spoken and from other circumstances
After having registered the emgrant passed over

slip upon which was marked the number of tickets

WHO OWNS cARDEyY


Mr. James Lynch, Commissioner OF Emigration md
President Of the Irish Emigration Society, who was
called upon last night by HERALD reporter was
priscd and shocked to hear OF tho catastrophe which
had bealen his wards The regular meeting of the Com
mssioners he said would be held Tuesday, but he
supposed he and hts colleagues would hold special
meeting at early nour to-day 10 devise some
means of relief for the sufferers. In the
course OF brief conversation, Mr. Lynch
sad the Commissioners must under tho
laws OF tho State, designate landing Place for emf
grants Castle Garden had been designated and
had been used for the purpose during the past twenty
ono years They may, however, designate any other
place within the State, and tho steamship companies
arc obliged land the cmgran.s Mt the place desig
mated When they arc landed 1t becomes the Commits
soners' duty TO take them Tho building

the OF New York by tho common consent Of the
authorities of the State and OF the United States for
the specific purpose for which It used The
ershp Of the properly Is vexed question. Tho city
claims ownership in the premises, but they might ind
il hard prove their title The State also claims to
own hem but 1t would be equally difficult for it to
support its claim. Many years ago the federal
government gave tne VropeIy W tne S'hte
to be used MS a landing depot for mmi-
grants; but it did relinquish its claims
upon the premises, and thcre to-day evidences
of the ownership of the State in existence 1--WE do
not admit said he ''the claims Of the city to it's
ownership although have steadily paid rent for the
property to the Comptroller believe the property
really belongs to the United States government""


The exact value of the burned building Mr.. Lynch
did not know, ho stated that 1t was fully covered
by insurance..

CONCESSIONS FOR PRIVILEGES""


What was the nature of tho ''conccssIons and what
the ''priviegcs' were no seemed TO understand
except sy conjecture Communications hayo appeared
in the local newspapers from those percnnially In
quisitve persons, Anxious Infhrcr"" sold Subscri-
ber' and others OF the family asking in vain for fur
thor information. Inquiry at the offices OF the Cen
tennial officials showed that there air OF mys-
terry about the matter not because there was anything
''crookein about Ito use word that Is
now in iashion-but because Il was not
deemed 'Judicious"" to make public the items under
this heading at the present time. IT. like Mr. Tweed,
the inquirer pressed for ''b OF particulars he was
politely refused and referred TO the Committee on Con-
cessions being given to understand in general way
that the concessions grants to sell articles within
the Exhibition grounds awarded to restaurateurs,
cigar dealers and newsmen mostly, at the highest
prices offered the money TO CO. OF course toward re-
imbursing the stockholders in the Centennial fund.
When, therefore. the HERALD correspondent endeav-
ored obtain list OF those concessions as legiti-
mato item Of news he found his path filled with OBJ
stacles But by dnt OF persistent work the details
were obtained and number of curious facts the
result interesting showing the American love of
speculation, fertility of invention in devsing of
making money out of the Exhibition, and apparent
but not real reckcssncss in paying large sums of
money for what 10 the unpractised often like
trling privilege





For instance one man has offered $500 600 for the
'prvilose"" OF sweeping out the Exhibition buildings,
guaranteeing pay all his help and to keep the fifty
odd of flooring in the buildings perfectly cleaned.
One cannot but admire the ingenuity and business
foresight of this man. as n little calculation will show
that by very moderate charge to each exhibitor for
keeping hs space clean, and by being permitted to
tain money and valuablcs found in his sweopngs this
eRterprisng individual might make very good thing
out of the concession notwithstanding the high prico

FAUoUIER COUNTY, Va, April s.


A large number Of Republicans assembled at
the urt-house in WarrentOn, in pursuance OF
public notice. to elect delegates to the State con-
vention, to be held at Lynchburg on the 18th of
April. The meeting was called to order, Mr.. S. p.
Bayley elected chairman, and James Bayley Sec
retary.


Mr.. S. p. Bayley, ir., rose and said: Gentle
men, we have assembled for a two-fold purpose
first, to elect delegates to the State convention;
second, to reorganize the Republican party in the
county, which has fallen to pieces either through
the negligence or inhdelity of its chairman, Mr.
W. A. Pattie. You are aware that it was the
duty Of the chairman, Mr. Pattie, TO call this con-
vention. This duty the chairman did not perform
according to the usages Of the party, but he and
four others secreted themselves in some place un-
known to any Republican now present and ap-
pointed delegates. The respectable element of
the Republican party will not submit to this in
justice, and therefore, we have assembled for the
purpose of electing delegates to that convention
who will reflect the sentiments Of the Republicans
Of Fauquier, who will faithfully represent US at
the State convention. have little confidence in

places to accomplish what duty demands to be

have assembled to perform q duty we owe to our
selves as citizens, believing, as we do, that the
prosperity Of Virginia and our county as united
whole depend upon the ascendancy OF the Repub-
lican party. We are Republicans from principle.
We desire to see the wise and humane legislation
Of the Federal Government made available; We
desire TO see the Government supported
by these new and lasting props-the country
restored 10 condition of tranquility. Then feel
assured, as q united people. We will be blessed
with glorious and happy success. Principles are
indestructible, and are not in the least affected
sections, as some would have you believe: and !
believe Republican principles to be the best hope
of the American people. They constitute the
granite foundation which rests the great fabric
Of our institutions, and upon these principles only
can the Government be administered TO consuni-
mate those purposes for which il was established
Mr.. W. A. Potter offered q resolution to the
effect that this meeting ratify the action Of the
secret meeting held by him, which appointed del
egates with instructions to vote for Blaine IN the
State convention. Mr. Potter, In support of his
resolution, said in reference TO the calling Of this
throne, and that person was one John S. MOsby,
moving in the interest Of Conkling, second edi-
tion OF Grant, with his fraud, corruption and
thieving. Mr.. Potter's resolution was then put
to the house and voted down. The meeting pro-
ceeded TO elect delegates. s. p. Bayiey and w.

The Republican party then reorganized by elect

Mr.. Paynter opposed the ordinance
deeming it unfair in its bearing upon
our citizens, by keeping city butchers
off the streets.


Mr.. Lynch opposed it on the ground

drive the people to the market houses

to pay four or five cents per pound more

stated, 1t was their intention to visit the Pres-
dent at 10 o'clock a. m, and from the Executive
Mansion they will go to the Capitol, and occupy
a gallery reserved for them in the House by
Speaker Kerr. A reception is to be rendered
them by resident Indianisns at Willard's hall,
from to o'clock p. NJ, which will undoubtedly
be an enjoyable affair, as the President, members
of the Cabinet, the Indiana Senators and members
will be present. The occasion will be enlivened
by the music of the Marine band. The hall has
been beautifully decorated, and 1t is to be hoped
that all the resident Hoosiers will be present.

The following letter TO Mayor Will
teley, from New Albany, Ind, was
read, and the Publishing Committee
authorized to have it printed.


""Hon. William e. Whiteley--My
Dear Sir: Will 1t be trouble to you
to make the following suggestion to
Mr.. J. X. adams. treasurer'of tie fire.
mems Committee, in case the 50 COO
has not yet been raised. 1t is /. way
To get the residue of the money with
out making it hard on.a few and with
less trouble, think, than any other
way. We shall iDaugurate it here
within the next ten days and shall ask
all the other cities, towns and villages
in Indiana to do the same. The plan
is as follows: In each place the ladies
are asked to cooperate, and in city
like Wilmington, the Opera House or
principal hall should be used, and a
small admittancc fee, say 10 or 25c. be
charged. Every person who attends
must bring pound package of some
thing. You may have what other en-
tertainment for the time you please,
but the main point is to have good
jolly fellow as auctioner, who shall
sell at public auction for cash TO the
highest bidder for the benefit of Della
wares headquarters, every package.
No package to be opened until all
sold.


In this way, every neighborhood
contributes, and there may be enter
tainments of the kind at private houses
as well rs public halls. The great point
is to see that some influential persons
Qadies especially in every village or
town to get the people interested,
Our ladies intend to have coffee and
sandwiches, provided for the ousts at
the Opera Houee. l think the firemeu
with the aid of the ladies and the press,
can make the plan work. 1t is the
pound party idea, now quite fashion
able in New York, and it struck me
that our Indiana people can succe ed
through it, and why can not the Della
ware people?"" Your friend,

The letter was dated on the 10Th oi

SHERIDAN ON THE PRESIDENT OF THE


BOARD.


From his report in 1867.


l say now unequivocally that Gov
ernor Wells is political trickster and
dishonest man. | have seen bim dur
ing the July riot of 1866 skulk away
where could not find him to give him
guard, instead of coming out as
manly representative of the State and
joining those who were preserving the
pea;e l have watched him since, and
his conduct has been as sinuous as the
mark left in the dust by the movement
Of snake. I cay again that be is dis
honest.


CARPENTER on THE BOARD.
From Speech in the Senate.


One pleasant little gentleman swears.
with a smiling face. that be himself
forged /, 200 afidavits in one day and
delivered them to Mr. Boyee, sitting
in the board. and Bovee said'he was ""a
hell of fellow and asked if he could
not get more of the same kind. and he
said be could get 800 or 400 Of the
same kind by 9 o'clock the next morn.
ing. if necessary They, not satisfied
with the duplicate returns. not satisfied
with the newspaper accounts. not satis-
fed with forged afidavits. and after all
these valuable means of information
failed, the board themselves swear that
they made an estimate, based upon their
knowledge of the political complexion
of the country. as to what the vote
ought to have been if it had been fair.
and counted it accordingly. and SO esti-
mated it in one parish. giving Mr.. Kel-
logg so many votes. and SO on. They
went through in this way and reached
the end of their labors December 9th.
1872 The entire returns from the
State showed that McEnry had 65. .579
votes spd that Kellogg had 55, 973
votes, SO that McEnery's maj ,rity was
9,6O5 This Lynch board gave Kel-
logg 1880 and McEnery 54.O29,
making Kellogg's majority lS $751;
They were not going to do things BY
halves. If they were going to have
a Governor, they we're not going to
stop on the majority the Democrats
Governor in fact got they were going
better. and they doubled and gave Kel.
logg $4,000.


LOGAN ON THE KELLOGG BOARD.
Speech in the Senate, 1873.


The government. or pretended gov
ernment. now set up with Kellogg for
Governor) is one that has no existence
10 fact. except founded upon fraud,
without returns, without votes. without
anything except mere desire Oh the
part of a combination to establish a
government. They have done so by
calling to their aid force and power. and
by that force and power they have es-
tablished government there and reign
over the people contrary to their rights
and wishes, in face Of the law and in
violation of the Constitution.


REPUBLICAN COMMITTEES VIEW.
From report 10 the House.


The board took different view of its
power, and proceeded to throw out the
votes from many polls where they found
intimidation and violence to have ex-
listed The result was to defeat persons
whom on the returns they should have
declared elected, and to elect persons
who should not have been declared
elected. In regard to four parishes
they declared no result whatever. but
referred the matter to the Legislature.
The result of this action aoas to change
the political majority Of the persons acho
by the Constitution and laws Of Lou
is,ana, are entitled to organize the
House Of Representatives We have
no doubt that they believed that they
we're defending the people Of Louisiana
against fraud on their constitutional
rights. But there is no more dangerous
form Of self delusion than that ,ohich
induces men IN high places Of public
trust to violate laU to redress or prevent
what they deem public ,0romgs 1t is
further said that this is a question
which concerns the people of Louisiana
alone, and that they should be left to
fight out the question among them
selves. But this is an erroneous view.
both Of the rights and duties of the peo-
pie of the United States under the Con-
stitution. They have an interest in
the question whether Senators or Repre-
sentives for Louisiana, thrust into their
seats by illegal means, shall sit in Con-
gress to make laws for them, and
achether electors, gaining their office IN
like manner, shall turn the scale IN the
case of a President Of the United States

 What part tue military are to take in the Centennial pageant has still to be determined. It is known that the ma jority of the governors will be attended by their guards, but besides these there will be COT siderable number of citizen troops present at the opening. There will be during the progress of the Gen tennial season numerous grand parades, but it cannot be expected that many of the regiments should be present at more than one of these. And as the greatest of these occasions will occur on the fourth of July, it is probable that the greatest number of militia and volun- teers will be present then. Gen. Flaw ley has made 8 digest of all the core spondence upon the point. From this 1t appears that Alabama will send eight to ten companies from Mobile, and 8 regiment from Union Springs; Arkansas will send an entire regiment from Little Rock; Connecticut will send an entire | brigade in August; Delaware will send a regiment from Wilmington; Georgia will send from Atlanta the Governor s Guards and the Atlanta Cadets, and from Columbus the City Light Guards, and from Savannah the Volunteer Guards and the Republican Blues, all | of these being independent companies; Illinois will send from Springfield the Governors Guards and 8 regiment 1000 strong, and from Chicago 200 men of the G. A. R., 600 men of the First regi- ment Illinois State Guards, and 400 men of other regiments; Kentucky will send one company of militia and one battal- ion of artillery, also the Louisville Grays, 200 strong; Louisiana will send three companies of artillery and com pany of Centennial Guards; Maine will send two companies of infantry from | Augusta; Maryland will send one regi- ment, the crack Fifth Baltimoreans Massachusetts, sends the Governor staff and guards, and seventy five to one hun dred citizens, ineal descendants of minute men of '76, and about 5000 troops; Michigan will send cadet corps 1 for the Fourth of July; Missouri will send 200 men; New Jersey will sen1 $500 men to participate in every one of the displays; New York will send from the city five regiments, including the cracks, the Seventh, and Ninth, and the Old Guard, and a company of the Centennial legion, and from Buffalo a regiment, from Albany one, and"" from Utica the Veteran Zouaves, and from other places general complement of 7,500 men; Ohio will send ,00O men of different regiments, and the Cleveland Grays; Rhode Island will send 300 men for the Fourth of July, and 200 men for the first of August; Tennessee will send Governors Guard and 1000 men; Texas will send the Galveston Artillery, with guns, caissons, and all, excepting horses, which they will borrow from Philadel phians; Vermont will send eight com panies, and Virginia will send com. pany from Charlottesville, another from Lynchburg, and another from Alexan, | dria."

The most captious critic will scarcely find
fault with the tone and temper Of Governor
Chamberlain's proclamation on the subject
Of the lynching of the Harmon murderers,
for the whole purpose Of it 10 to point out
the danger to society Of such acts, however
provoked, and to remind the public, in their
own interest of the inexorable need Of main
tanning the laws supremacy. As the Chief
Magistrate of the State, Governor Chamber
lain could say no less than he has said, nor
could It bs said with mere kindly dignity.


We have not pretended to justify the
killing of the Harmon murderers. What
we could not do when tho horrors of the
deed for which the murdsrsrs died were
fresh in our recollection we cannot do at
this later day. But Governor Chamberlain
must remember that confidence lie plant of
slow growth, and that for years past the
people have had reason to doubt the eff
cheney of the courts in this State as a means
of Furnishing criminals. The records OF
the courts are covered deep with mis-trials
and acquittals through the fundamentally
of ingenious lawyers or ignorant juries, and
for tive years, In common opinion, pardons
could always be had by those able and will
ing to pay for them. 1t was the fear that
the Harmon murderers would escape, as
other criminals had escaped which provoked
the Edgefeld !ynching. The better course
would have been to try the law once again,
and resort to Judge Lynch only when TIE
constituted tribunals of justice had failed to
mete out to the murderors the doom they
deserved.


In reading the accounts of the lynching IT
will doubtless have been noticed that q
number Of influential gentlemen strove hard
to persuade the lynching party from carry
ing their determination into effect. And We
remind the public that in such inability tc
control bodies of men whose passions are
exsatsf lies the danger of mob law

stances. Tho brutal deed of the Ku Klu1

would be better for the public if such matters
could be kept between the priest, the MUIR
dcrcr, and God.


One of the remarkable features about this
case is the illustration it affords of the slight
value of circumstantial evidence when unsup-
ported. A large proportion of those who have
read the previous testimony in this case, as
well as many of the officials concerned in ex-
amining it, thought that the beggar-woman
whom Maggie accompanied to the woods
committed the murder Many minor clrcum-
stances favored this view, and so firmly was 1t
adopted by the neighborng villagers that pre-
caution had to be taken to prevent them from
lynchirg the woman. The result renews the
lesson of care in such Investigations. 1t offers
some antdote to the public impatience for
swift punishment in murder cases. and affords
some consolation for the laws delay. 1t also
throws fresh doubt on the superiority of that
circumstantial evidence which Prof Huxley
regards as better than oral testimony."

By the confession of the murderer of little
Magic Bauer. all the details of the horrible
tragedy are now brought to light. Very natu-
ral indeed, was the fierce Indignation of the
hystandcis when the facts of the crime were
rchearscd. 1t is not at all astonishing that they
were with difficulty withheld from lynching the
criminal but it is exceedingly fortunate that
they were prevented Otherwise there would
have been two murders instead of one, and
probably much greater difficulty in securing Il
verdict against the new criminal. There will
he scant sympathy for the wretch who gave
the rein to his vile Instincts there would
be an abundance for the bystaudcr who
failed to curb Il righteous Indignation.
The advocates Of the death penalty and
it, opponents, though differing as to methods,
will agree rs to the main point i'll the case OF
murderers like McCOn0chie. Such as he must
be forever secluded from intercourse with
their fellow-men. They are brutcs at heart,
and furnish one of the arguments to
evolutionists that all men are descended
from beasts, since some OF them
thus display their ancestry. We shall
not wish to hear the tale of McConochies rs
penitence in prison and his hopes Of future"

II all occurred in o lawsuit, very
small one in appearance, but great
enough to show once more how uncer-
tain is the law, and, above all, the coi
rectness Of Nosey's proposition.


A few days ago Mr.. Chas. L Howard.
President Of the Louisiana State Lou
terv Company, brought suit IN the ou
nerior District Court against Durant GA
Ponte. ESQ. on d promissory note lof
$3.50 and interest. This was answered
nv q general denial and the plea that
the Louisiana Lottery Company. having
no banking privileges, was not empoW-
cred to discount notes; and further,
that defendant had a much larger
claim against the plaintiff, then pending
or about to be entered in the United
States Circuit Court. With rapidity
that would be highly commendable IL
manifested generally, the case was fixed
and decided within ten days. ana de-
fendant was squelched, in the legal par
lance of the deputy clerks OF the Oourt' -
house Pending the proceeding, JOS
Hornor, Esq, representing the Plain nfERIOo
suit being SO insignificant the defnostoffiee
ant would be willing to abide by the i-weekis
cision Of Lynch's court, entered a,ar
mittiture of fifty dollars of the face eHEttP55p D
the note and the interest, thereby shay
ing the amount down to an unappeal-
Mr.
defendants attorney, whose nose
is as proverbial as our own,
began to think that that end OF himself
was either becoming less sensitive or
was 'drove in In vain did he search
the quickest recesses of his subtle brain
TO discover some plan by which he could
increase those five hundred doliare one
dollar more in order to enable him to
take an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Not even the financial ingenuity OF Eu-
gene Levy, the broker, could assist MN
in his legal difficulty. But 10! that
nose. sirs. that nose, the ferret of his
phiz, suddenly polied itselfin into the dusty
pigeon holes of the clerks Office OF the
Superior Court and, behold! there was
the Judges signature fixed in indelble
hirroglyphics to the Judgment, which,
+ in plain and uumistakable words, de-
! creed five hundred dollars and interest
/ in favor Of the plaintiff just the problem
! that Levy himself had been unable to
/ solve.


The clerk OF the court it seems. al,
though he had carefully eliminated
/ the RENTED fifty dollars, had forgotten
! to leave out the interest. And thus was
! Lazarus raised from the dead and little
Joe Hornor sat in corner, whilst De
metrius, the silversmith, raised an up
! roar.


Nosev finding such a formidable rival
| in a member of the legal fraternity, de-
termined at once to emulate him In MS
own field. He bethought himself OF
several plans, but only succeeded in
conceiving the dastardly project OF in
fringng on somebody's patent by con
verting his nose into pump handle.
After further and more mature reflec-
ton the project was abandoned, and
Nosey walked into the C9stomhouse.
a strong odor OF fGuayava jelly. the same
which probably prompted Dom Pedro to =.
ask one of the officials, on the occasion
Of His Majesty's visit to the granite
building, to show him 'some OF zem
Guayava CIGARS Certainly this odor
had some CONNECTION with law, but not
civil law, and the latter was what Nosey
was in search of. Presently, however.
he chanced TO run against an odd look
ing, little old man, whom he recognized
rs Tom Scandal with bag on his
shoulder and q hooked stick in his hand.





ment along the sombre corridors
of the editice. Nosey was prompt
ed to ask him what he was
doing. Tom replied, with the
utmost serenity, that it was none Of his
business, but recognizing Nosey he told
him that his occupation consisted in
picking up court decisions ia antieipa-
ton of their being rendered and by
hawking them about the streets he
made a fair living. Business had been
dull during the past week, but he
thought he had just picked up scrap
that might prove profitable. 1t was
part of u decision in the injunction
phase of the suit against the Lottery
Company, in which plaintiff was put out
of court because he had had the audacity
to prove that the stock on which he was
suing was his own, although it stood in
another mans name, and the man in
whose name the stock was entered in
the Lottery Company's books had had
the candor to swear that such was the
case. Nosey thanked Tom for the in
formation and withdrew, re marking that
he was not buying to-day.


few minutes later Nosey had en-
tered the Charity Hospital unseen, and
for few moments looked around for
Matt Hogan among the ordinary NOR
tails. Matt had, however, been removed
to ""pay' ward, where he now lies
with excellent prospects OF recovering,
for the period within which peritonitis
may still be expected to declare itself
| has nearly. # not entirely passed. With
apparent nonchalance he scorns the
charge of being an accessory TO the
murder Of the unfortunate Laresche,
and yet when the indictment Of the
Grand Jury was communicated to him
Matt did not take it with his haDitual
GOODNESS. He acknowledges that he has
sometimes INDUCED in ""nefarious
transactions, but he does not wish to be
classed with murderers.

If those votes were all legally cast, or rather, if there was fair and free election Throughout the State, then Gov. Tilden is entitled to receive the electoral vote of Louisiana, and to be inaugurated as President This is the question which the Returning Board, exercising judicial powers under the laws of this State, is Co determine. The Republicans say that in fnAny instan- ces the election was not free one, and m proof of the assertion point to the fact that in some of the parishes of the State, where the negroes are considerably moro numerous than the white people, and where at former elections the Republicans had large majorities, the returns now show Democratic maiorities or large Re- publican losses. This, it is asserted, ia prima facie evidence that improper means were resorted to, slnce 1t is assumed that the negroes. if left to themselves and un- influenced by fear, would always vote the Republican ticket. A Southern Republi- can politician, if called upon to state his theory mathematically, might put it in this form: If ""a"" represents the number of colored voters in given State. ""b the number of white Republicans, and ''c"" the white Democrats, then ""a"" plus ''b"" minus SC"" will be equal to the ma iority which the Republicans ought to have in any election in that State. If the majority IS reduced below this figure, or if the Democrats succeed, then it is held that there must have been fraud, or that the negro voters were intimidated.

 shall not in this letter, discuss this method of reasoning, but will simply say that while unexpected results in any elec- tion may furnish grounds for suspicion, and make investigation desirable, they are not in themselves proofs on which 1t is safe to base any positive conclusions. In the present crisis in the political affairs of Louisiana and of the whole country, the people will demand on the one hand that all the facts bearing on the election in parishes which have been revolution ized shall be made known and a full ex- planation of the change shall be given. and on the other that no action shall be taken which will affect the final result in this State unless 1t is based on the most satisfactory and conclusive evidence.

 One of the most important questions which is sure to arise during the discus slon of the Louisiana question will be in regard to the exact character of the in- timldation which will vitiate the election in parish or voting precinct. A Repub- lican of national reputation who has re- 

 the war told me the other day that in cer- tain portions of this State it is impossible for white Republican or black Demo crat to live, except m the large towns. He did not say that men who ''went against their color"" in those sections of Louisiana would certainly be murdered, but he meant that they would live in such constant fear, hated and avoided by those of their own race with whom they camo Tn daily contact, that one of two courses only would be left for them to pursue either to quit the country or yield to the pressure and go with the tide of public opinion. This assertion was made to prove tu me the absurdity of the Demo- cratic claim that negroes had voted for Tilden and Nichols in the last election. Now in parish where such @ state of things as this gentleman described exists 1t is plain that free election is impossi- ble. No violence may be used, no unlaw- ful means resorted to to influence the in- dividual voter either on election day or at any time during the campaign which precedes it, and yet the very essence of a free election, the deliberate choice of the elector, may be wanting on both sides. This is kind of intimidation not less de- plorable than others, but one which it seems to me impossible for any election law to reach. It is the result of an inhe- rent defect in the constitution of society where it exists, and it is extremely diffi- cult to say how that defect shall be cured. don't suppose any one would pretend that the returns of the election in parish where this state of affairs is known to ex- ist ought to be rejected by the Returning Board i'll the absence of direct evidence of violence or threats, and am sure that no public opinion in the North would sustain the rejection of the returns of such q pa. rish without conclusive evidence of that kind. 1

 Another kind of intimidation winch the Republicans of this State assert has cost them thousands of votes can hardly be brought within the scope of the election laws. I can best describe it by giving an example. St. Landry Parish has been carried by the Democrats at every elec- tion, believe since 1868 until this year. Now 1t has beyond dispute gone for Hayes and Packard. The explanation which the Republicans give of this change is as follows: They say that in St. Lam dry Parish there was horrible massacre of blacks in 1868, which struck terror to the hearts of the negroes, and the mem- ory of it has prevented many of them from voting at every subsequent election. In other words, the colored people, being by nature easily frightened. and remain ing longer under the influence of fear than white men, have actually been kept away from the polls for six or eight years through intimidation, the cause of which may not have been repeated Although it is greatly to be regretted that such 6 condition of affairs as this can exist in any free country, don't believe the cleo. tion laws of this State cover such a case, or that they ought to do so. At the same time, as we bring the scenes of violence nearer and nearer to the election, it may be that the very delicate question will arise as, to how recent an act of violence must'be iD order to make it vitiato an election. h'aia iRHo iHf'

 ] If a negro from Grant Parish swears that he dared not go to the polls and vote on the 7th of November, 1876, because he remembered the slaughter of Republicans in his parish in 1874, and if he can specify no threat or act of violence since that time, will the board decide that the elec- ton was not a legal one this month |?

Several of them expressly declared that they had not come to New Orleans to get the state voie for Mir. Tilden, and all acauiesced The first effort was, there fore, to ascertain the facts. Judging from the usage of Northern states this would not be difficult. On addressing the state committee for information, 1t was at once found that that body had been obliged to contend with unheard of difficulties in ti.eir efforts to obtain returns These diff culties were partly physical, due to the lack of means of communication with re-. mote parishes, but for the most part, they were due to artificial and malicious ob- structions placed in their way The etec- ton was held under a complicated and elaborate corps of officials, appoint ed by the state government, and free from any of those popular checks which we in the North. regard as essential to self government. The efforts of the press and the party committees to obtain informa- tion were, treated as impertinent. It vas furthermore necessary, inasmuch as the ruling party did not publish returns (ex- cept as hereafter statedl. and did not therefore either deny or accede to the democratic reports, to fortify these latter by..certificat es in manner totally un- known to the North. The democratic com mittee, warned by the experience of 1872 and 1874, took as it appears, energetic measures to secure trustworthy returns, duplicates of the returns sent to the re- turning board. -

 The suspicion of the latter body impli- ed in this course of action is abundantly justified by it's history. I have before me detailed statement by parishes of the returns which were received as 8 re- suit of the efforts of the democratic conn- mittee, with memoranda of the authority on which each parish return is based. Allowing for possible errors of detail, this statement establishes moral certainty that Governor Tilden carried the state by seven thousand majopitY, according to the returns. ...--....

 I met no person in Louisiana, and mixed as freely as possible with per sons of all classes and both parties. who denied or doubted that this was the true result of the election. I was told that the republican newspapers had pub lished returns from thirty or forty parish es, coinciding with those in the democrat ic statemnnt, but then desisted, declaring that the returns were incorrect and un- satisfactory. No counter claim is made in regard to the returns. The only an- swer made is that there have been out rages and intimidation in five or six par ishes, and that the returning board will have to correct the returns by throwing out the votes of those parishes. The re- publican newspapers of the 14th inst. went further, and declared that it would be necessary to insert the votes which would have been cast for the republicans if the intimidation had not taken place. 1 met no person whatever who admitted any other hypothesis than that the return ing board would bring out a republican majority. It was not discussed; it was assumed, as of course. 'i a '....-* #

 < The proposal, then, is that the return ing board shall destroy the votes of large number of others who really voted, and supply the votes of large number of others who did not vote, because they think that some persons voted under coer- cion and others refrained from intimida- tion. Could anything more arbitrarily destroy the whole theory of popular elec- toral government?' a.s- Ga...

 For obvious reasons could not enter into the question of fact as to outrages I heard abundant complaints of outrages, &c.,, against negroes who voted the demo- cratic ticket, and talked with number of persons who had such complaints to make. also resolutely pursued all possi- bic inquiries within my reach to try to find out the truth. In a conversation a number of us held with Governor Kel- logg, he was asked for facts under this head. He cited the case of Gaid only. Gaid was killed by lynching, under cir cumstances of revolting injustice, in Sep tember, 1875.

 Politics had nothing to do with it, much less this election. It is fair to say our interview was cut short, and MT. Kel logg got no further with his recital. Oth- CT charges of outrage which l heard or saw were intangible and uncertain. l could not bring any of them to distinct shape. All of them were denied, and es- pecially the broad and general descrip- tions of systems of intimidation were en- erget1cally deuied by men of unquestion- able characte and integrity.

 see no guarantee against fraud except in the vigilance and interest of the oppo- sing parties. Such guarantees exist in Louisiana, with the vast preponderance of the chances in favor of the party in power, which appoints all the officers of election, has the federal officers on it's side and controls the federal troops. Every effort made by the democrats to to prevent frauds isptortured into proof of intention to commit fraud. and runs through the present temper of the people, finding ready credence. -.ae ........

 I do not wonder that the people of Louisiana despair of justice and far treat ment from us when 1 see the readiness with which honorable men accept mis- construction of all their efforts and the te- nacity with which the same men cling to party preiudices. is shame to human nature and fragrant violation of all the assumptions of free government. It only proves with renewed force how wrong 1t is for us to be governing a state 1.6O0 miles away. If the vote is not to be count ed as cast it is plain that the investiga- tion ought to be full, open, impartial and complete: but cannot see how any such investig gation is possible in the nature of things if the tribunal were above suspic-d ion. The theory that such an investiga- tion is possible leads to one result, as yet distant, but sure-congress will be the returning board of the nation and usurp the election of president. es asis -t71l

 The only conclusion L could reach in regard to the general matters in dispute were as follows; Society in Louisiana is almost entirely disorganized. It is claim ed, and strong facts are alleged in proof, that this is due to standardization of the civil officers, from the highest to the lowest with very few exceptions. The law is made an engine of abuse at every turn. Officers ofeyery grade neglect or violate du-. ty for favor UT reward. The most sacred institutions of civil socIety are perverted to produce wrong gtand abuse. The elec- ton law is intricate, and while apparent ly adapted to provide for all contingen- cies, really creates hundred technicali- ties and machinery which renders popu- lar election impossible The play of it's various parts. allow scope for fraud, and chicanery and abuse It depends upon the action of an army of officials. many of whom are far away from any control and free from all responsibility, while they are able to defeat the whole. purpose of"

has been kept up, at heavy cost to the
people, ostensibly for the education of
the colored race. According to the report
of special committee, chiefly composed
of Republicans, several of them colored
men, to the Legislature, the institution is
den of corruption and iniquity, more
suited for the preparation of pupils for
the penitentiarY and gallows, than for
honorable avocations. If half that was
said in that report be true, the concern
ought to be demolished, and the
ground on which it stands sowed
with salt. The money which has
beenA spent upon it, under pretence
of education, has been worse than thrown
away. We pres0 pc the question of what
to do with it, will receive the attention of
the Legislature. We are not in favor of
epriving the race, for whose special bene-
fit it was intended, of any of the educe.
tional advantages which they now enjoy
but We hold that the money which is ap-
propriated for their education, should
be spent wisely and economically, and
strictly for the. purposes claimed. The
best informed colored men of the State,
and among the number the late James
Lynch, earnestly opposed the Alcorn
University project, and thought that the
money expended upon it would have
been more judiciously appropriated in the
establishment of primary and norma
schools for the education of the children
of their race, and results have shown
that they were correct.


Alcorn University was sham in its
inception, but it has turned out to be
worse. According to Radical testimony,
it is gigantic fraud and reeking mass
of corruption."

Some of Our Political Prophets.",,"Mr.. Stanton, who is filling the unexpired
term of Judge Ketchum, of Pennsylvania,
and who is one of the ablest young lawyers in
the Keystone State, says that he believes
peaceful solution Of the present complications
will be secured by the saving common sense
Of the American people. The renowned ""War
Horse"" of Ohio, ex Senator Ben Wade, views
the situation through decidedly Republican
spectacles. He says that Hayes has been
fairly elected, and will be inaugurated with
out war. He says that organized war is i'm
possible, for the reason that the Southern
men who recently tasted its bitter fruit will
have none of it, and the Northern Democrats
never will taste that fruit as long as there is
q chance to run. Representative Wiltshire,
who is a bold and fearless statesman, in
whom both parties have great confidence,
says that the people of the South de-
sire an honorable and peaceful settle
ment of the present difficulties and
will throw all their influence in that direc-
ton. Mr.. Conger, the Republican parlia-
meptarian, wit and watchdog of the House,
says that peace and Hayes will both reign
after the 4th of March next. Mr.. White, of
Kentucky, the only Republican Representa-
tive from the Bourbon State, says that he be-
lieyes Hayes has been constitutionally elected,
and will be inaugurated beyond the peradven-
ture of a doubt. he says, however, that Mr..
Tilden's friends may possibly inaugurate him
In New York, in which case he will be simply
treated as a scarecrow until he attempts to
interfere with the Hayes Government; then
he and his accomplices will at once be recog-
nized by the Government as traitors, and will
be clapped into Fortress Monroe so quick that
It will make their heads swim. Mr.. Flye, Of
Maine, thinks the situation very serious, but
says the American people, conscious of the
fact that they cannot afford war, will have
peace, and an honorable one, at all hazards.
Mr.. Lynch, of Mississippi, says that the
outlook is promising, and believes the
Democrats will submit pesceably when the
decisive moment comes Martin /. Townsend
says that the brave men who saved the nation
at the peril of their lives still retain the un-
bending courage ard iron will which made
them heroes on the battle field, and that right
will triumph at their hands, and the will of
the people constitutionally expressed will be
sustained,"

d in the annual report of the Fire Com
mittce, which is in substance as follows
Upon visit on Tuesday evening, we found
the Department in excellent order. We were
received by the members of the different
companies with great kindness. A high
gentlemanly tone seemed to pervade the en-
tire Department. We are of the opinion that
our Department, considering the facilities ut
their command, has no superior in the
United States, either volunteers or paid.
1t is, we think, fully prepared to combat
any ordinary fire that may occur, but in
case of serious conAagration, we are
afraid that there Is not sufficient quantity
of hose at their command, and we think
that it would be wisdom on our part to pur-
chase suitable quantity Of hose, SO as to
have It on hand In case Of emergency.
We also think that the fire bell should lie
higher SO as to throw out q better sound,
for In its present condition 1t is no benefit
to the department. We earnestly recon-
mend that donation be made to the Wash


ington Fire Company to assist them to
repair their Hook and Ladder Truck. We
also recommend that fire alarm telegraph
be introduced into our city as soon as pos
sible, as 1t might be the means Of saving y
vast amount of property.


Our First Department consists of 412 &C
tive members and steam fire engines,
hose carriages, l hook and ladder truck,


$3.50 feet Of hose, 800 feet Of 1t being
first class gum hose the balance being light
er. .
The horses belonging to the different
companies are all well aud ready for ser.
vice at a moments notice, as 1t was fully
demonstrated to us that they could be
hitchel up to the engine and leave the house
In ten seconds. The houses of the different
companies with one exception are in goot
condition and credit to our city.

MITTKE AT IRVING HALL-A NEW UNION


WITH TAMnANY PROPOSED


Last night the anti-TAmmany Executive Committee
met Irving Hail. and business OF considerable in
terest to every member Of the organ zaton to DO
Transacted rrmor OF Its character had the effect Of
insurng largo attendance In addition to the regular
members OF the committee numbers OF politicians who
look with anxiety to the settlement; OF the local po-
cal issues and are desperately eager to know II
the heshpots Of Office for which they hunger
to be put within their reach or not, 1ocked
the Hail. and scattered themselves about within and
without, discussing with evident anticipation OF
important disclosures the action OF tho closeied CON-
mittce The latter had declared their Of pr
nature. and consequently their first caro- to
shut their deliberations from the intrusion OF the
Of their party well as upon such seekers
Of news as appeared.


When the doors had been closedlnd watchful Ger

Aiter the usual opening routine Mr. James O'Brien
moved that committee should DO appointed consist
ing OF from each Assembly district aud ono tom
the Twenty third and Twenty yiourtk wards to confer
with the Tammany Hall organization nnd endeavor to
devise some plan Of union upon the county ticket
Whom Mr.. O'Brien sat down there seemed, as far as
couic be Judged from approving mods, disposition
among the members OF the committee to favor his mo-
tion but Mr. Ira Shafer, the chairman OF the General
Committee, rose TO oppose IT, He SAID that be- for one
opposed to Tnnmany Hall, root and branch. he
believed n making no attempts 10 combine with It on
anything and said that overtures to 1t could not DO
made with honor to the anti-Tammany party.

that he In favor 0t union aud that at this juno
turo tho duty Of every citizen who desired tho

the nation were turned upon New York, II behoovcd
all democratic factions TO sink their differences and
harmonze their interests that the common end might
be the more readily effected.


Mr. Shaier got upon his feet when Mr.. Morrissey
had concluded, and turning toward him, ho said he
would ask the Senator If last year he could have boon
elected IN his district had the people there known that
this year ho would seek to ally himself 10 Tammany
Hail


Mr. Morrsscy replied that this moment when
tho great national should be cOnspcuousy promi
nent before every democrat and that watching It he
should lose sight OF facton preudices and wrnugngs
and give his whole attention TO the point where was
most needed. Every true man, he said, believed in
doing and he felt confident that the who elected
HIM to Office thought as he did and would unanimously
support him If called upon 10 do so.


Mr. Timothy Shea spoke against the union In one Of
hts characteristic ''No Tammany"" 0ratlons and
followed by Mr.. William Z. Mitchell, who said lhut
during the last few years it had been conclusively
proven that a combination OF democrats with republi
cans in this city had always had ono sided result
The democrats might have had tho cry for the
but the other party carried of the WOOL Whenever
faction OF the democracy OF tho city allied itself to re-
publcans against another faction OF its political
complexion always helped the republican State ticket
aud had to regret Its rashness when was too late 10
remedy it. lie said that this had been the case last
year. and that II IL union Effected would have
this year democratic candidates suggested by demo-
Gratis instead OF by republicans, as 1t was twelve
months ago.


Mr. James D. McClellani opposed the motion, saying
that was not tho function Of Iho executive COMMITTEES
60 action such matter, and moving that II DO
referred to tho general committee.


Judge Murray said that to facilitate matters 1t would
be well to have vote taken deciding whether union
with Tammany Hall would DO desirable and making

A Boy Brutally Murdered by his


Father-AnOther Son Seriously In


jured.


The Cincinnati ""Commercial' of yester-
day says:


A bloody affray occurred in the little vii
lage Of Oxley, subdivision of LockIand, on
the Hamilton and Dayton Railway, about
ten miles north of this city, at 9 O'Clock
yesterday morning resulting in the death of
a boy, and serious if not fatal injury of an
other. 1t was the result of domestic
troubles, the particulars of which are as


Burrell Dudley, colored man
with his wife and several children.
reside at Oxley. It seems that Dudley
and his wife have not lived happily
together, but their home has often
but the scene of bitter quarrels. Two sons.
Alexander, aged fifteen years, and joseph.
aged seventeen, have on all occasions taken
the part of their mother, and saved her
from harm. Yesterday morning Dudley be-
came involved in a quarrel with his wife
about some trivial matter, and would pro-
badly have inflicted upon her some bodily
injury, when, as usual, the two boys inter-
fered. This exasperated him to such de-
gree that he seized shot gun, close at hand
and taking atm at Alexander, fired, the
charge of buckshot entering his abdomen,
producing a ghastly wound, from the eff.
feets of which he died soon after.


The infuriated father then turned on
Joseph and commenced beating him over
the head with the gun, breaking the stock
OF the weapon all to pieces, and finally left
him for dead.


The wife escaped by running to the house
of neig hbor living near by, and gave the
alerm. Dudley was soon after overpow-
cred and arrested. He was placed in charge
OF the Town Marshal, and locked up for
safe keeping until this morning, when IT
was the intention to bring him to the city
and lock him up in the county Jail.


Last night, however, the colored people
residing in that vicinity began to assemble
around the house in which Dudley was con-
fined, and fears were entertained that they
would make an attempt to lynch him. In
order to prevent sucn action, the Marshal
with the aid of some friends, succeeded in
escaping from the crowd with his prisoner,
and, procuring wagon, at one o'clock this
morning safely landed his prisoner in the
Hamilton county jail."

On taking the chair, Mr.. Laftte said:


Ladies and Gentlemen-I return my sincere
than KS for the great and unmerited houor con.
this meeting, the object of which is to cele,
brate the thirtieth anniversary of the corona
tion aud glorions PontiEoase of our Holy Fa-
thsr, Plus the Ninth.


On this day the Catholics of every country
unite in returning thanks +"" The Almighty for
the special favor conferred upon one who,
through so many long years of trial and snffsr-
ing, has borne aloft the Bann ar of the Cross
with a firm hsnd; attaching to himself with
ties of strongest affection all faithful children
of the Church, and commanding the respect of
it as q special favor of Divine Providence tn at
our Holy FathEcsr Plus the Nipth, should have
been allowed to wear the Tiara for longer
period than any of his predecessors. not ex-
cepting the great Saint Peter. A prisoner in
bis own palace, he is mightier in his weakness
than all the princes Of the earth, clothed in all
the panoply of power.


His warm heart, filled with love for his chill
dren of every cline, is most sentative to any
tokens of affection offered to him by them. He
has assured me with his own lips, his couuten-
aDco besmiHg with beDevolence, that he has o
special affection for the Cathoics of America |;
We can, therefore, feel assured that this de-
monstration by the Catholics of New Orleans
will iEpart TO bim special consolation, and
will call down upon us bis warmest blessings.


Kneeling at his feet, his hand resting upon
my head, have felt an indesoribable thrill of
joy as he INVOKED blessing upon me aud my
family, and trust arose q better man. We
will all feel the pleasurabe effects of the bless
ing he will surely invoke upon Us in return for
the fisl affection to which we propose giving
expression to night.


Mr.. LATTE concluded by introducing the
orator of the evening, the


HON. THOMAS. j. sEMMEs,
who delivered the following address:
Mr.. President, and Ladies and Gentlemen:


""I hope ever to see America among the fore
most nations in examples of Justice aud liberty I;
and presume that your fellow w-citisens will
not forget the patriotic part which you took in
the accomplish ment of their revolution, and
the establishment of their government, or the
important assistance which they received from
u n alton in which the Roman Catholic faith is
prOfessed.""


What have just read is an extract from the
response of Gen. Washington to an address of
the Roman Catholics of America on his acces-
sion TO the Presidency.


That address wac only signed by fve persons,
as follows:


""In behalf of the Roman Catholic olergy-J.
Carroll""


- In behalf of the Roman Catholic laity-
Charles Carroll, of Carrolltou, Daniel Carroll,
Thomas Fiizsimmons, Dominiek Lynch""


In 1884 the Rev. DR.. Carroll was appointed
0uPoAIOA Va SAA SkOLBy III bAO
States.


IL was not until after the Consultation of the
United States bad been adopted and the Gov
ernmeDt established, that the Holy See Issued
the papal bull appointing Baltimore as the
Episcopal city, and DR.. Carroll as the hrst
Bishop of tho United States. This bull is
dated November 9th, 1889.


(Mr. SemmsS here read an extract from tho
bull, which want of space cOmpels ne to omit.)


There being no Bishop in the United States,
DR.. Carroll sailed for Europe in the summer OF
1880 and was coneecrated Bishop of Baltimore
August 18th Of that year by the Vicar Apostolic
of London.


Thus was the Catholic Church, at the time
Of the adoption of the Federal Constitution,
cOpacy independent Of all ecclesiastical su-
thority, save that Of the Apostolical SEQ and
the Roman PontiG. The infant nation and the
newly organized Church started together in the
race Of development,


The nation has become great and powerful
the Church has not merely followed In tbS foot
steps of civilization and erected churches and
schools in every valley and on every mountain
top, but she has penetrated the widest hauutS
of the savage in the execution of her divine
mission to preach the gospel to all men.


When the Rev. DR.. Carroll was appointed
Bishop of the United States. the Catholic pOpu-
lation numbered about 10000, Of which 16 900
were reiHhsbitants of Maryland, and z GOO resided
in nPennsylvania. About thirty priests exercised
the functions of the ministry.
Bishops, 600 priests, $500 churches, 1 700
parish sohools, and 6 600 600 of popuIation.

16_1876-02-08_p2_sn84038806_00280768972_1876020801_0130,Los Angeles daily herald.,01,1876-02-08,p2,How the People are Robbed.,,"We have the most law-abiding peo-
pie in California that can be found in
the United States. We doubt if there
is people On the globe who would
manifest the same degree of patience
ami forbearance under the same provo
cations. All the devices that can be in
vented to rob them legally and illegal
ly, they endure with fortitude that
would put to shame the ancient Qua
kers. Their houses are robbed and
burned; stages robbed; their women
raped and murdered, and for all these
outrages there is no lynching. Every
body says let the law take its course.
Such little offenses as horse stealing,
land-jumping and black-mailing, is
only reported to the Sheriff and Courts.
Nine-tenths of the men summoned to
serve on the jury in such cases have
never heard of the case before. The
sffense was committed perhaps in
sight of them, but so little do such
things disturb the community that
they never hear of it until the District
Attorney reads the complaint. This
forbearance upon the part of the loyal
citizens has emboldened every class of
robbers until they are ready to walk
in and help themselves to all we have.
1t Is true the lawless brigand still pre-
fers the lonely highways or the shades
of night to secure his plunder. But
there is class Of legal robbers that
are more bold but equally corrupt, who
have the cheek to walk In and occupy
our possessions, houses, lands, and
everything else. They are great
sickle for the law, yet without the
shadow of a legal claim they can serve
notice on any citizen of this city,
county or State, to get up and vacate
their homes, and large damages will
be claimed if they refuse. The poor
fellow is frightened. All he has on
earth has been expended on this land,
but he fears the law, 1t is very
expensive to go into court, even If he
should win the suit, it will break him
to pay lawyers, etc. While he is thus
Eliminating in his mind, Iank-sided,
lynx-eyed lawyer makes his appeaf-
ance, looking as wise as an owl, and
as humble as URIAH HEAP, who in
forms the poor fellow that the best
thing to be done is to compromise,
and he agrees to approach the prosecu-
tor and see what sum his dignity will
condecend to accept to withdraw the
suit. The next lawyer he meets tells
him he is fool to think of compro-
missing, that he can win the suit very
easily, and will only charge a fee of
s.. The prosecutor sends word that
he will compromise for s., fixing the
amount a few dollars less than the
fee of the other lawyer. The unfortu-
nate man has his choice now, and
there is so much money to be drawn
from his pocket anyhow, and he
makes up his mind to stand the black
mail. This class of robbery is going on
all over the State. Thousands and
millions of dollars are being filched
from the honest, hard-working people
in this way, under the color of law.
Let it never be said again that Cali
fornians are not the most patient,
kind-hearted people in the world. In
every other state the people have Or
ganized into leagues and unions to
protect themselves against oppression,
and they make strike and big fuss
about little reduction in wages.
What would they do If they were be-
ing robbed as we are? The same black
mailing game was undertaken some
wears ago in the State of Texas. But
Texas is a very sickly country for that
class of men, and they all died or left.
and the Legislature passed some laws
that settled or put stop to such suits.
Now that our Legislature is in session
the honest people of the State should
petition that body to make law COM
pelling these parties bringing suit for
land to give bond for all costs and
damages. 1t is no trouble to give
bond, il the claim Is good one. But
Il would be q hard matter to give
bond for the cost of Imany suits that
have already been instituted. This
class of suits is not only robbing the"

for their filth and slOp. 81 have, said the
orator, "" done business on Walnut stree
when my wagons were hub deep in mud.
1t Ia burning shame that the matter should
be passed now, when ir can be done for less
than at any other time. They say it is po-
litical, that Mr.. McMenamin wants to come
back to Council from the Sixth Ward. Too
late for colonizing now, Who are these
men who demonstrate ? Mr.. Cause, the
Hilleses, the Bushes, the Tatums, the Nc
Caulleys; yes, they all object. Why it is too
cruel to make these men pay. They don't
want Walnut street paved; they want to
keep it as a reservoir for their filth till king
dom come. These men never sell property;
they always buy and keep 1t. Mr.. Murphey
appealed to all to vote intelligently upon
the ordinance""


Mr.. Paynter also took strong grounds in
favor of the ordinance and said if it was
right in May when Republicans and Demo-
Gratis in Council were in favor OF it, it is
right now. He had carefully analyzed the
list of remonstrants, he said, and attributed
the opposition of the wealthier portion Of
them to selfish motives.


William Candy explained why all signed
the report for paving the street when there
was no remonstrance but when there was
remonstrance he had his name stricken





to sleep in the charman's pocket until sud.
denly one Thursday afternoon, before
Council met, he found it necessary to have
a meeting held which was only attended by
the three Democratic members, and the re-
port hurried through. The large remon-
strance came afterward and it went to sleep
too in the chairman's pocket. The gentle
men from the Second Ward said the remon-
STRANGE should go to the committee.


Mr TnIt -, nl,af,. \ 1af1 fIaot rua9
the place for it to go.


Mr.. Candy. Yes, it was, and the report
with it. He hoped an injunction would be
granted aud justice done bv the courts,
when council fails to do it, Nearly all the
residents on the street, rich and poor, ex
cept 13 have demonstrated, and he consid-
cred it an outrage to treat them IN such
man ner.


Mr.. Febiger, after correcting the mis-
representations and inaccuracies of MIR.
Murphev, reminded that gentleman that if
he would only think minute he would not
traduce the character OF Taylor Cause,
one of the largest hearted and most liberal
philanthropist of the city. MIR. Farrell now
got off one of his characteristic speeches
on capital and labor, denounclng the press,
leading off in an attack on Taylor Cause,
accusing George w. Bush with placing the
manure from his horse stables on Walnut
street, and with an attempt on the part of
the rich men in Council to cut wages down
to 80 cents day. Wilmington, he said,
shone forth to-day as a bright star, as the
only city in the Union which had by ordi-
nance established days wages at $1.5 by
an ordinance.


The vote was then taken and the ordi-
nance passed by party vote as follows


Yeas-Messrs B ckta, Farrell, Ford, Ire
Ian, Lynch, McIntire, McGlinchey, McMen-
amin, Murphey, Paynter, Pyle-1l.

 Western Grasshoppers.-A gentleman

 in this village received letter from Chero

 kee, Iowa, few days ago, from which we

 quote the following:

 We write to inform you that the grass

 hoppers in large numbers have made their

 appearance in O'Brien county and the

 northern part of this county. In O'Brien

 county we are informed that the corn crop

 has been entirely destroyed, but that great

 deal Of the wheat and oats will be saved.

 It has caused general panic, and will

 again throw northwestern Iowa into bad

 repute. There is strong south wind

 blowing to-day (July 3Ist) which may keen

 them off. We send you scrap from a

 Sioux City paper in reference to the dam-

 age done at Windom, Minn.

 WS7adoma Reporter, July 27.1

 We have taken the utmost pains to learn

 the exact situation. All seem to agree that

 the pests have never before appeared in

 such numbers. They have covered the

 ground, and grass, and crops, and trees.

 Trees at night fairly bend under their bur

 den of 'hoppers. Young forest after young

 forest has been stripped of it's leaves. and trees of several years growth are left as naked as in winter; and large fields of corn and potatoes that had escaped the early raVages have fallen victim to the incom- ing scourge. We have had grasshoppers for long time, and each year they appear thicker than the previous, but this year

 nave hatched not only in greater numbers,

 but an army of still greater proportions has appeared and is filling the ground with eggs that had just been made vacant of eggs bv 1 the warm sun.

 Lakeville.-The Lakeville members of the Nautilus Club with their invited guests started for their trip to the Centennial Ex- hlbltion at Philadelphia Monday morning. They went to Bridgeport by the Housaton. lc road, and sailed in the schooner ''Katie J. HoYt,"" which had been arranged for their accommodation. The following went from Lakeville: Surgeon General Knight, Commodore Stillman and wife, Purser Fisher, Commissary [of hash1 J. Brinton and wife, Mir. Tom Norton and wife. Miss Phelps, Carrie Bostwick, Miss VanAlstvne. Miss Barnum, Miss Ophelia Williams, Hen ry Dewey, Wm. Landon, Douglass Owen, Charles Wood, Gilbert Bryan, Mir. Nash, and the two Messrs. Saunders. Chaplain Vail, with his white choker and pocketful of sermons, joined the party op it's arrival at Bridgeport We are indebted to Purser Fish tor an invitation to accompany them, but duties at home forbade our going, l Quite number of white sea gulls are re- ported to have been lowering over lake Wononscopomoc for few days past. Has this fact anything to do with the Nautilus Club?

 Ex-Gov. AverillRof Danbury is expected at the Miller House this week for few | days sojourn in this pleasant region. MT. | AVeril was raised in Salisbury, and his friends and Salisbury people in general will welcome him to his old home. MT. A.

 The Irish Temperance Question: EDITOR CONN. WEsTERN-DEAR SIR.-You will oblige us very much by publishing the following facts relating to a temperance society which has lately been organized by large portion of the Irish Catholic resi- dents of the town of Salisbury, and which has met very strong opposition from Father Lynch. It seems strange to say that clergyman, no matter to what de- nomination he might belong, should oppose such an object as that of temperance, es- peclally in Salisbury, and it is still more strange to say that he and one or two oth- CTS, in order to sustain his opposition, should invent the following false and very silly reports, viz: that we were going to organ ize Fenian society; that our rules did not say that only all these who were Catholics were entitled to membership, and that be- ing the case, any man, Protestant or Yan- tee, could join our society if he pleased. Now these reports are as false as God is true. Every one who attended our meet &la Al,a. l color of Fenianism about our organization, . and any rational being would not conceive the thought for a moment of any of our American Protestant friends joining us. .

 More Potato Bugs.-The early part o

 this week the potato bug pest brok

 out again. and manifestlY with renewed vigor. The gardens and fields of potatoes which for some little time have been givel rest from the ravages of the bug were found all at once literally covered with the insect in all it's stages of growth from the full grown, ten-line, stripel bug down to the smallest specimen, and all O. them exceeding industrious in their effort! to annihilate the vines. What this curse will amount to in years to come at this rate of increase can only be surmised.

 Resumed.-The Wheeler & Wilson com pany, Bridgeport, has resumed work, after being practically closed for a month. Al though it is not generally known precisely what changes have been made in the oper atlons of the factory, yet it is understood that they amount to complete revolution in the manner of conducting the affairs o1 the concern. The contract system is gen erally. but not entirely abandoned. Some ot the old contractors are now superintend ents of thelr former departments, and oth- CTS are thrown out. There has also been 8 large reduction of wages, varying according to different reports from 25 to 33 per cent.

 Two Hundred More.-There are still about two hundred of the two hundred and fifty different individuals, to whom we sent the kindly invitation to even up three or four weeks since, who have not made if manifest they hold us in that esteem we wish they did. Once more we remind them pleasantly. Won't you please hear us? We can't always beg in this manner, but we maust have our pay some way or other, and if we can't get it this way, we must get it the other; but we don't want to say anything about that. Pay us up fairly and squarely and enjoy reading paper that is paid for

 Disgraced Physicians. pr. Bracken, a young unmarrled physician in Plttsfeld, was bound over for trial by the Superior Court last week, for criminal intimacy with the young wife of Arthur Wells of Lenox.

 Dr. H. $. Streeter, an educated and skillful physician at Gray, Herkimer coun- ty, N. r., has been proved to be criminally intimate with number of his patients, young and old, including two little girls fourteen years of age. Accused of his crimes by an indignant citizen, the doctor seized butcher-knife and threatened to carve him up, but afterward fled from the town to avoid being lynched. Streeter has a wife and two young children.

 The Bea utiful Pomengranite.. Mrs. Charles Hunt of Huntsville handed in, with the name of new subscriber the other day, the most beautiful pomengranite blos- som we ever saw. It was profusely sur rounded with the long, slim leaves of the twig which bore it, and with the flower, was very charming. A pomengranite tree is rare exoctic, in fact we have grave doubts of there being another in the coun- try, and we have been intensely interested and delighted at this specimen from the rec of Mrs. H., who has our sincere thanks for it. Somebody says Mrs. Hunt has one of the finest flower gardens in Litchfeld county, remark which we presume will come very near to the truth.

 Jig Dancing in Sheffield. The good people of Sheffield. we have no doubt CD, eel highly honored at the selection of their luiet village for contest between jig lancers. The following letter from New Haven will explain itself in relation to the challenge and it's acceptance;

 That Cow Question.-MR. EDITOR ;- n former issue of your paper an article D relation to Horace, is said 10 reflect on he good name of this peace abiding con- nunity, and our Mir. Sherwood is anxious 0 have you inform your readers that Wash ee street does not extend to Mount Riga. Tor even to the mountain bridge. Further nore, Farmer Goodsell furnishes milk at a 'rice that makes milk stealing entirely un- necessary, even ln these hard times. It is he opinion of some that Horace took his whisky straight before giving you the ill., ormation that led to the publication of he offensive article. Otherwise his usual ood nature would have prevented him aking such an unkind mode of informing he public that his old COW was drying up.

About eleven o'clock yesterday morning,
a man named George Long, who lives on
John street near Gordale, and who was on
the farm of Daniel Thomas, opposite the
Columbus Rolling Mills, hunting walnuts,
entered the orchard of the latter for some
apples, when he, Mr.. T., set his dogs upon
him. They attacked the man with such fe-
rocity that he was unable to get away from
them, and urged on by their owner, they
rot him down and lacerated him to such an
extent that his recovery is matter ofdoubt.
The affair was witnessed by several persons
from short distance, but they were unable
to render any assistance in season. Mr.. L. :.
it seems drove off his dogs after seeing that
there was danger of the man being killed
outright. Mr.. Long staggered onward till
he reached the Columbus and Toledo rail-
road bridge, where he gave entirely out
from loss Of blood. From this place he was
helped by some friends. DR.. A. Neil was
called in to dress the wounds. He pro-
nounced 1t the worst case of dog biting
that be had ever seen. The chief wounds
| are in the legs or in the neck. From the
calf Of his leg the flesh had been so torn az
| to leave cavity reaching to the bone large
enough to contain hens egg. A cash is
torn In bis neck two inches long and in other
places his flesh is terribly mangled. Mr.
Long is an industrious working man, in the
employ of the Asphalt Company. The fam
| lily are now left in destitute circumstances


and are now worthy objects of charity. Mr..
Thomas is Welt known farmer of consider
able wealth, who resides on his farm on the
west side Of the Olentangy river, adjoining
the corporation limits. His dogs have quite
a local reputation for ferocity, and recently
drove some parties who we're fishing in th'


vicinity into the river. They are the terro


of the citizens Of the neighborhood. Th'


indignation of the citizens of the Tenth


ward, where Mr.. Long resides, rose to tn
highest pitch upon the circumstances ofth


case being known that their was talk q


once to administer lynch law to Mr.. Thom


ss, bus more prudent counsel prevailed."

NemS says: The negro man who
was arrested at Wilmington on the
night of the 9th ult., suspected of
being the party who committed the
outrage near Masseys in the morn
ing of that day, was released on
the 29th, no one having appeared
to identify him. This is very sin
gular, as twas said that he answer
ed the description OF the guilty
wretch, and probably was the
man. Another negro was arrest
ed near Mt. Pleasant, Del, on
Monday, by some persons from
Masseys, and taken before Esquire
Blackiston, at Millington, where
he was confronted by the outraged
girl, who declared most positively
that the prisoner was not the man,
and he was accordingly released.
There was, we are informed, a
very large crowd around the ma.
gistrate's office during the hearing
waiting. it is said, to lynch the
prisoner in case he should be iden.
titled, not many of whom, however
We're Millingtonians. Search is
still being made for the gnilty
party; but what is the use o.
searching if, when arrest are made
no steps are taken to identify the
parties?"

Nd, August Is, 1876: believing that health
may be largely promoted and pleasure Sc
cured, to an extent not otherwise attainable,
by an annual cruise upon the waters of our
beautiful rivers and bays and their tributaries,
and that the enjoyment of such an occasion is
greatly enhanced by the association of con-
genial minds"" the ""Innocents Abroad"" from
the preamble of whose constitution the above
extract is taken, started on their second annual
cruise on Saturday, August 12, 1876, from
the Sixth-street wharf in the fast-sailing
schooner Commerce, Capt. John Keller.


The excursion party this year is composed Of


THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS:


Ell. Evans, president of the club; H. E.
Weaver, secretary; o. T. Thompson, treasurer
and purser; L. Stoddsrd, sailing master: c.
G. HeLersn and E. Schmidt, executive COM
mittee; De Wilton Haines, T. F. Shoemaker,
A. S. Lynch, D. W. Lsthrop, J. P. Afllard,
John Stunkel, B. Y. Martin, E. A. Evans, By
ron Turner and Chas. A. Appel.


The route laid down is to 20 first to Pills
delphia, to the Centennial, of course: thence
to Cape May, to Atlantic City, to Long Branch
and Jamaica Bay, if time will permit; thence
along the Atlantic coast to the capes of Vir-
gfnla, and home.


From the well-known reputation of the
members composing the excursion party, and
the route selected, it will be easily seen that a
good time is not only anticipated, but fully de-
termined upon. There were few incidents
worthy of note occurred during the passage
down the river to Point Lookout. Head
winds retarded the progress of the vessel some
what, but proved her excellent sailing qualities,
as well as the seamanship of the captain.
The ""Innocents"" found some friends at Point
Lookout, with whom they visited and took
some fish. Once more on their way, Stodditrd
captured Spanish mackerel which had wan
dered into forssken paths. The precious
""Inrocents"" are all well and having a good
time"

Closed ?",,"A short time ago the Board OF Public
Education declared 1t could not carry on
the schools during the present year for
the amount of money that was expsnd-
cd on them last year. The members Of
the Board said they would close the
schools when the 100000 appropriated
by the City Council was expended; to
keep the schools open the usual time,
the Board demanded $74.5OO. The Coun-
Gil refused to appropriate this increased
sum. Then the Board threatened to ap-
peal to the Courts. Finally the Council
asked the opinion of Mr.. Walter Cum
Minis, the City Solicitor. upon the ques-
tion. 1t was given last week and the
Solicitor said the Council was bound to
furnish the amount of money the Board
required. He did not, however, show
that there was any penalty attached for
the non-performance of this require
ment.


The Council urged the Board to be
more economical; but to no effect. 1t
was ine1orable and demanded the $74,.
$1,000; knowing that this could not be
furnished without incurring debt this
year. and increasing the taxes for the
next fiscal year. commencing on the let
oe July, 1876.


Last evening The Council met for the
purpose OF determining whether the
money demanded should be appropriated

other city affairs. they must see tha
they elect gentlemen to the Board O
Public Education who will unite in tn,
efforts OF the Council to keep dow,
taxes and avoid running the City int,
debt.


1t would never do TO close the school
and turn the children on the streets
and therefore, the Council was wise il
voting the money. Wisdom should hav
taught the Board to economize within
the amount it expended last year."

 The great international four-oared contest at Philadelphia was contested by 50 many crews that it was necessary to divide them up and row three in 8 heat; the victors of one first heat was rowed by the Eurekas of New ark, N. J. Argonautas, of Bergen, Point, N. J., and the Dublin University crew, and was won by the Eurekas in 9.263 being complete surprise, as the others were the favorites. The Yale College crew won the second heat over the Vesper and Crescent crews, of Philadel- phia, in 9.02sz. The Columbia College crew won the third heat in g. Il, beating the Eliza beth crew, of Portsmouth, Va., the Quaker City crew having withdrawn. The fourth heat resulted in victory for the Beaver wycks, of Albany, over the Falcons, of Bur lington, N. J., and Duquesnes, of Allegheny City, Pa.; time, 9.14. The Malta crew, of Philadelphia withdrew from the fifth heat, leaving an easy victory for the Watkins (N. Y. ) crew, whose only competitor was the Penn sylvania crew, of Philadelphia time, 9.06I. The sixth heat was contested by the most formidable of all the crews, namely: London rowing club, and Northwesterns, of River dale, Ill.,, the Atalantas, of New York, with drawing on account of sickness. The Lon doners won in 8. .55, the Northwesterns making for the Cambridge (England) University crew over the Oneidas, of Burlington, N. J., 1T 9.O6s4. In the second days races in the first

 heat the Eureka crew was beaten by tht

 Beaverwycks in soy. The Columbia crew having withdrawn from the contest of tho second heat on account of sickness, left al

 easy success for the Watkins crew over Gam

 bridge in 9.O11, the stroke of the Englishmel

 giving out before reaching the goal. Th'

 third heat was contested by the London crey

 and Yale College four, and resulted in 8 vic

 tory for the Londoners in 8.511 Yale beinl

 but one second behind. The time was tn

 fastest ever made on the river, and was en

 thusiastioally cheered by an immense crow

 of spectators. The last of the series wa

 rowed the third day by tho Londoners, Beaver

 wycks and Watkins. Although the race wa

 generally conceded to the foreigners, to tn

 surprise of everyone the Beaverwycks came Ii

 f1lst in g. 9.06, the Londoners second in 9.061

 The poor time is accounted for by the rough

out of the banks to do business with. That is
the present difficulty.


Mr.. Powers then referred to his own section.
The rate ruled higher in the new counties than
in Older ones. This was natural The Houlton
savings bank let money at eight per cent Fort
Fairfield recently made loan at rates VARYING
from to IL per cent 1t could not have OBJ
tained money at that rate six or eight years
since. He represented borrowers, and he was
confident that they do not desire any change in
the law of interest. They wanted no go-be-
tween curb stone broker to 60 between them
and the lender


Mr.. Lynch of Machias, said that the main
questlon With him was what was the highest
fate OF interest any man in any industrial bus
mess IN Maine can pay. He had made extend
ed inquiries. and the universal answer is that
no man can pay more than six per cent. He
held that the present law had increased the
rate of interest in Maine. In his own locality
there were men who had surplus of money
which they loaned to safe business men at six
per cent. Under this law the effect had been
different. A savings bank was instituted and
into that bank went all the money in that vi
cinity. That bank regulates the rate of inter-
est and has fixed the same at per cent. The
result has been disastrous. 1t has been said
that the law would be broken and thus make
the parties criminals. This would be light of.
fence compared with the taking of runous rates
under the present law. The borrower as always
at the mercy of the lender. The lender is cool,
exactiug and cautious The borrower is excit-
ed, unwary and often deluded. He was fit
victim for the sharp and often merciless lend
er, who would take the highest possible rate."

The debate on the interest bill to-day was
one OF unusual interest. The Hall was full,
the area about the Speakers desk being
filled with ladies. Mr.. Haynes opened the de-
bate and spoke nearly an hour, during which
time he received the close attention of the
House. He devoted large portion of his time
to the history of the usury question, and the
attempts of the government to regulate the
price of money and the necessaries of life. He
quoted authorities in political economy to show
that the wisdom of that class is against fixing
rate of interest. He also devoted some time
to showing the fallacy of attempting to define
the natural rate of interest by law. MI.
Haynes business has not been in the direction
to give him practice in public speaking but be
is ready and forcible speaker. Mr.. Powers
speech was undoubtedly the best effort he has
ever made in the House. His argument was
fair, cOgent and his manner most effective.
Mr.. Lynch of Machias quite surprised the
House. He proved himself to be speaker of
power and adroitness. He made even more of
his side than did Mr.. Pike He seized uron
his best points and used them with power His
candor and warmth concealed the speciousness
of his argument There was Just a flavor of
demagogism about it. No man ever thought
of taking more than six per cent interest in
Machias until the mischievous law put it into
his head. Now he wants eight ten, twelve
and more. The law has destroyed his con-
science and made him Shylock. The simple
holder of money would ten years ago lend to
anybody; now he puts it in the savings bank to
have an excuse for not lending to the fellow
who needs money. He made the money lend
er dreadfully grasping fellow, sort of ghoul
who went about devouring innoc ent but i'm
pecunious lenders. He had the floor when the
the House adjourned aud will ontinue to NOR
row.


The Montville fight is at its fiercest in the
committee to-day and continues this evening.


A committee of the Maine Medical Society.
consisting Of Drs. French of Portland, Brickett
of Augusta, and Horr of Lewiston, presented
bill before the Judiciary Committee today to
institute State Board of Health similar to
those already existing ia other states. The
board is to consist of seven members, who
shall have secretary at salary OF $4,000.
DR.. French read paper that won high COM
mendations for the ability with which he set
forth the advantages of such board. On the
merits Of the question the committee would re-
port the bill, but in these times of retrench-
ment the committee is nearly divided over the
item of cost. 1t has been suggested that the
fish propagation fund be turned over to the
creation of the board.


The Deering Boulevard came to a sudden
termination today before the Ways Committee.
The projectors of the scheme lad failed to give
legal notice of their intention to the Legisla-
ture and on that omission the matter will 60
to the next Legislature. The committee could
not waive that without violating the statute.


Some careful lawyers, who have been looking
up the matter, are very confdent that the
judges of the Supreme Court will give the
opinion that the school mill tax is constitution
al.


The Finance Committee tomorrow hear the
friends of the Maine General Hospital. Drs.
Greene and Tewksbury will address the COM
mittee. The feeling in favor of the hospital is
much better than year ago. The patients all
over the state who have been treated at the
hospital prove to be ardent advocates Of the
claims of the institution.


The Temperance Committee held a session
this evening. After full consultation it was
voted te report legislation inexpedient relative
TO increased penalties.


The Railroad Committee today gave leave to
the Maine Central to bring to the committee
bill authorizing them to take up the track
from Crowley's to Lseds' junction. The COM
mittee did not vote on the merits Of the uues-
tion. There is a strong feeling to require the
company to make the connection through Lew
iston before the track is taken up.


The Land Grant Investigation Committee
will meet tomorrow The matter is hardly
spoken off.


The Railroad Committee will report bill
giving the Portland & Ogdensburg Railroad
further time to locate portion of the line and
bill to amend the charter of the Aroostook
River Railroad.


The Judiciary Committee will report a bill
giving additional rights to married women in
actions of tort.


A bill will be presented providing for the
payment of salaries of railroad commissioners
by the state instead of by corporations. S,"

to put her on the witness stand. The court was
opened shortly after 10 o'clock.

response to an interrogatory by the witness when
he approached him, Henry Brewer exclaimed,

The prosecution objected, and the court sus
tanned the objection.


The defense noted exception.


Mr.. William b. Cassin, of Georgetown, sworn,
testified to his acquaintance with and good stand
Henry Brewer; his general reputation as a quiet
and law-abiding citizen was very good; never
heard the reputation of Joseph N. Brewer gues-
tioned.


Mr.. James S. Welsh, -four manufacturer, OF
Georgetown, D. c.; Nr. F. Y. Ward, lawyer, and
H. Z. Berry, of Baltimore, all testified as to the
good character of the Brewer brothers.

The admissibility Of this kind OF testimony was

Mr.. Riddle made lengthy and exhaust BILE
argument that the evidence was admissible. He
expected to show that rumors involving

of Mr.. Marbury. Msrbury, at s p. m. on Tues
Newton Brewer for Henry. Not finding Henry,
he communicated the substance of what he had
eect Il that lis sister Was about To Become 'nS
mother through her relations with Col. Clarke.
On the following morning Marbury met Henry,
and made the same communication to him. That
will be the substance Of the statement of Mar
bury, and the effect OF II on the brothers will be
shown. Newton Brewer told Henry of whs: he
had heard, and the latter rushed into the
presence OF his sister and learned IRON her the
most explicit confirmation of the statement in the
most aggravated and worst form. When Henry
met Marbury on Wednesday morning the latter
found him disturbed and shaken to the pro-
foupdest depths Of his nature, which was neither
weak nor shallow. Marbury then made full
midday train and came to Baltimore, and here
occurred what did occur. 1t was proper that all
this should go to the jury, SO that they could de-
termine whether the Brewers were not thrown of
their balance-call II insanity, or what you may
and thus irresponsible for their actions.


Mr.. Riddle said that the defense proposed to
follow up Msrbury's testimony with that of Miss
Mary Brewer herself 1t would appear that she
had interviews with Henry on the Tuesday even
iEg and the Wednesday evening in question.


Mr.. Knott objected to the Introduction OF the
testimony.


Mr.. Riddle argued that previous decision of

Many years ago Lynch"" law was only
known on the Western borders, where no es-
tablished government was in force, and where
every man took the Law in his own hands.
Even in such case it was condemned by all
law-abding citizens as an injustice to the ac-
cused and an outrage upon civilization. But
now il is not confined to the borders. Judge
Lynch has presided at court in every State in
the Union, and the citizens begin to look upon
such court as a necessity. Why is it that
upright, honest, law loving citizens engage in
and sanction these trials! 1t is because we
have too much law and too little justice in our
courts. Tie lawyer enters into all the intri-
cacies Of the law, and presents precedents; the
judge feels bound by the law, and gives weight
to the precedents, and instead of presenting
law and justice in the case clearl! to the jury,"

them.


The making of laws was designed to enforce
justice-that being the basis of all law; but our
modern lawyers endeavor in their arguments
to find and present some law or precedent that
will bear upon the judge and jury In his favor,
while he actually knows there is no justice In
1t. If he evades justice by an ingenius man
ipulation of law, he gains notoriety and prac-
tice, regardless of the effect upon society. The
same spirit of competition which enters into
trade is showing itself at the bar, and it is bad
for the bar and society.


A feeling now permeates society that there
is little Justice in courts, and this feeling will
grow until arbitration will settle nine-tenihs of
the cases and a lynch court dispose of nine
tenths of the murders. 1t is unfortunate for
society, but it will surely be so, unless the bar
and the court, in all their arguments and
charges, take justice for basis and law as
coroIlary. This is done, the faith of people in
law courts will return; otherwise we will go
from bad to worse.

he suffers from having his children worship

that is only another consequence of bis
past course. But 1t may also be suggested
in-reply to this argument that the wishes of
the mother as'to the religious faith of tho
children should not be forgotten, and are
deserving of at least equal consideration.
What those wishes were may be inferred
from the testimony of the relatOr's brother.
They we're not coincident with those of her
husband. Over the religious discipline and
instruction of children courts have no jur-
isdiction. Human laws deal only with the
civil rights and duties belonging to the re-
lation Of parent and child. e Hoxst. 6'9.)

his positions cannot be maintained either
on principle orruthority; and putting aside
the learning of the books and the weight of
precedents the case has no better foundation

VS.. JAMES BRATToN.


The writ of Habeas Corpus in this case
was issued upon the petition OF Jonn :.
Lynch, and directed to James nra'ton,
commanding him to bring before me sne
persons therein named, together WIN the
cause of their being taken and detained. !,


On the day appointed tor the return o.
the writ and the hearing OF the petltion,
Mr.. Bratton produced the persons named 10
the writ, to wit: Mary Lynch, aged 10; Jonn
Lynch, aged 9, and James b. Lyncn, agea
d: and also made return IN wrltlns anu
under oath, in which he cerunes Cne caaSes
Of their detention by him. Inc substance
of them is that the said Mary, yon9 anu
James are the children of John +. Lynch
and Emma ]. Lynch, who were married on
the 5th of February, 1856; that Emma was
the daughter of the respondent who, IN the
month of October, 1859, finding that the re,
lator was unable to support his wife and
two children, William then two years ola
and Mary, an infant of three weeks, LOOK
them to his own house where they renamed
until March, 1856; that during tnis
interval Emma and her cnll-
dren lived separate from tne
relator who contributed nothing whatever
to their support; that in the early part oi
1864. Emma and her children went to i've
with the relator in Wilmington, where ne
had commenced business; that about this
time. or shortly after, the relator acquired
habits of intemperance which grew 10 De SO
CONFIRMED and excessive that he not only
neglected to provide for his family, out
treated them with extreme cruelty, so tnat
in December, 1870, the said Mary was com
pelled to leave her fathers house ana mas
ever since lived with the respondent; that
for three years the relator paid no rent, ana
the respondeut had to contribute to the sup
mort of the said Emma and her children;
and that finally, on the 14th of March, 1878,
IN conseouence of the continued intemper-
ance. neglect and cruelty of her husband,
Mrs. Lynch obtained from the Legislature
of Delaware. an act of divorce, s'nc""Io,
bv the I'd section of which it was enacted,
""That the said Emma j. Lynch shall nave
the sole care, charge and CUSTODY VI heT
children"" The return turther SETS 1ortn
that on the 10th of August, 1873, the salo
Emma died, having committed the care OF
her children to the said respondent and MS
wife, who took thep and have ever since
wholly maintained them, except 90 lar as
the wages of the eldest child, william,
aided in his support; that said William dled
in August. 1874, at the house OF the re-
epondept: that the relator in April, 1874,
married apain and now resides In Philadel
pbia: that the respondent is able snd anx-
IONS TO support the said children who are
much attached to him and his wife, and de-
sire to remain with them; that it would be
greatly detrimental to the interests OF the
children to remove them from their present
home and commit them to the CUSTODY OF
the relator who by his violent temper, bis
intemperate and improvident habits is
wholly unfit to take care OF them, anu mas
forfeited all right to them, and that IN addl
tion to this whatever right OF CUSTODY M
NAV have had are completely annulled by
the act Of divorce.


To this return there was general denial
on the part of the relator, but more par
ticularly to that portion Of 1t relating to MS
present character and conduct and his MT.
ness 70 have charge OF the children. 1t
was alleged that since his last
marriage he has reformed his hap'ts
and established new position IN
in society, entiJling him to the respect and
confidence of his friends and netghbors, and
to the restoration of his paternal rights.


A number of witnesses testified tothe ma
terial facts contained in the return, and the
private act of divorce, duly authorized
and recorded, was exhibited. One witness
swore that he had seen the relator lntoxl-
Gated since his last marriage.


On the part OF the relator 1t was shown
that for nearly two years past his life mas
been industrious, sober snd reputable, thai
he is carrying on fair business and Is aole
to maintain and educate his children. On
these grounds it was claimed by his counsel
that the only question TO be considered was:
whether John f. Lynch s~aot fit and capa-
BILE to have the charge of his children, he
having the legal right to their custody; since
the legislative act assigning them to their
mother, being in the nature of an interlocu-
tory decree. was not final or conclusive, and
the trust thereby imposed on the mother not
being transmissable by descent, on her death
the rights of the father revived. 1t was also
argued that something was due to the
repentance and reformation Of the relator


it is not necessary to review the evidence
in detail. Enough has been stated to
afford room for the application Of the legal
principles, which will govern and control
the decision OF the case. These principles
are to be found in the modern text books
and in long and ample current Of authori
ties from Lord Mansheld's Is time to the pres
ent. The right of the father to the custody o
his infant child, grows out of his duty tt
maintain, educate and protect It, and while
he gives it education and support, he is en-
titled to its services. But this right Is not al
absolute one, and is often made to yielc
when the best interests Of the child require
that it should. Society also has an interes
in the welfare and morals of children, ant
it is for the public, that, in determining

The unveiling of the statue of William H.
Seward to-day was a significant event. A few
days ago witnessed similar ceremony when
the statue of Lafayette was unveiled. Both
of these works of art stand in the most con-
spicuous and the most favorable positions in
New York-the Seward in Madison square, at
the intersection of Broadway and Fifth avenue.
In passing up either of these great thorough
fares the statue faces you and is sure to catch
your eye. 1t is the same when you pass up or
down Twenty third street or when you stand
on the steps of the Fifth Avenue hotel. The
Lafayette is placed in like commanding stu
alton in Union square, looking directly down
Broadway, fanked on either side by Washing
ton and Lincoln. The statue of Lafayette by
Bartholdi is fine piece of work, partaking
somewhat in style of its French origin.
1t seems fitting that statues of Lafayette and
Seward should be raised almost simultaneously
in this Centennial year. Both, in their own
lands, were apostles of Liberty. Mr.. Seward
visited Lafayette in September, 1888, at his
home iu France. After the death of Lafayette
Mr.. Seward lai II an eloquent Grafton on
the virtue z. ua lat patriot.


NJ Hva.l mis- Grafton, and in one of his
ls.,r-s s.ol. Europe, describes the hospitality
~ . ,'t' .Isiasm with which Lafayette and his


y received him as an American citizen.
-afayette's love for America never abated.
We hope the time is not far distant when the
statues of Lafayette and Seward will grace
the capital of the nation as they low do the
metropolis. Washington should be the city
of statues. Besides these two named we miss
at the capital any memorial of John Adams,
one of the greatest of American patriots. His
statue should be placed by the side of Jefier-
sons before our Centennial ardor dies away.


You will copy, no doubt, from the New York
papers the details Of the ceremonies to-day,
and hope find room for Mr.. Eyarts' Grafton in
your paper. 1t is impossible to do justice to
him by any description of his great effort. 1t
must be thoughtfully read or heard. The
whirligig of time brings round great changes.
Twenty-Five years ago Mr.. Evarts was making
speeches antagonistic to Mr.. Seward, and the
city of New York was more ready to lynch the
apostle of the Higher Law than to build him
q monument. Indeed, the city at that time
would not tolerate so moderate an auti-slavery
man as Hamilton Fish, who was to have pre-
sided to-day.


/ regret to learn that Mr.. Evarts did not
write out his splendid Grafton, and that the
reporters but imperfectly heard him. If SO, it
will be public loss.


The statue is one of the best in America,
both as work of art and as a likeness. 1t
should be duplicated for Washington. B."

Miss, Clarion, of Monday, contains
the following in reference to the riot
on Saturday at Port Gibson:


PoRT Gibson, Miss. Oct. 81.


To J. z. GEoRGE:-Itis is Lynch's day
here and much excitement. Spratt,
saying he was deputy Marshal, start
ed toward town with an armed BODY
of negroes. The sheriff met them
with possee and ordered them to
dispcrsc. Claiming right to keep
in his own county, the Marshal dis
banded after a parley. No body Of
our people armed. (Signed)


VERTNER.


A second despatch to j. z. George
says: The Spratt negroes fired from
ambush on few of the sheriff's pos
see, two miles from town, doing no
damage except to horses. The whites
returned the fire wounding one and
capturing several negroes. The bal
ance of the blacks escaped into the
swamps. After reinforcing we fol-
lowed, but have not caught up as
yet. (Signed) j. d. .VERTNER.


The Memphis 1rdidnche this morn
ing says the following was received
from republican sources last night:


JACKSON, Miss, Oct. N.-Represcnt-
ations that the negroes are the ag-
gressors in Claybourne county, are
utterly without foundation. United
States Deputy Marshal Spratt, who
arrived here last night, reports that
prior to to-day Lynch was gazettcd TO
speak at Port Gibson. The indica-
tions were that he would not be per-
mitted to do so. A deaths head
and cross bones with the, date of
meeting on each side were placed
over it by the county democratic
clubs call under pretcnse of presery-
ing peace. Hundreds of white liners
acted as shcriffs and police. The col
ored people were not permitted to
carry arms to the meeting having
been promised protection by the
sheriff. They left their arms two
miles from town. Atthe commence
ment of the meeting Lynch was gross
ly insulted by the democrats and de-
clined speaking under the restrictions
imposed by them.


A notorious democrat, who was un-
der number Of indictments was put
forward by the democrats when the
colored people began to dispersct
They were pursued by the democrat
ic mob with arms and eflectually
stampeded. They were hunted like
partridges, but the object was appar-
emily not to murder but to intimidate
them, so they would abandon their
determination to register and vote.


They were pursued two miles, when
reaching their guns they fired into
the whites wounding two horses.-
No other damage was done. One
negro was wounded and several ar
rested and lodged in Jail. This is
the first republican meeting attempt
ed to be held in Claybournc county.
Deputy Marshal, Spratt, reports a
reign Of terrorism throughout tho
county and says the republicans can't
vote unless protected by L. s. troops.
A company of troops is now station
ed at Port Gibson, but the command
ing officer did nothing to preserve
peace."

Then It was the turn Of the two clubs,

were followed into the square by the

A splendid body of men, over one
hundred strong, marching behind their
splendid banner. and attired In white
shirts, black trowsers, white caps with

and uniformed in black trowsers, white
shirts, green cuffs and collars.

THE FINNERTY GUARDS

splendid rooster which INDUCED In

square. fIN


THE KANE GUARDS,
preceded by u cur representing a cane
field scene, were in citizens dress and
were led by a fine field band. This com
pleted, US far as could be discovered,
the immense turnout Of the Third Ward.
About the same time there came in IA
mighty van from Camp street,


THE FIRST WARD,
the Central CLUB leading with splen-
did brass band and several handsome
transparencies. Second In order came
the

the

of the Tenth Ward. announced them
selves they were preceded by a fine
brass band and numbered between
two and three hundred men in citizens
dress.


The most thoroughly and completely
uniformed ward was the


ELEVENTH,
and In numbers waSinferiOr TO none. II
the Third Ward Is excepted.


THE woBKrNGMEN' CLUB
were very neat. their red cap, red cuffs
and collars showing to much advantage
in the light OF the thousand torches.


THE eAUTHREAUx woRKMEN CLUB
were none the less to be admired for
their soldierly bearing. their white caps
with red bands, red cuffs and collars.


THE YOUNG '76,
OF the same ward. were very numerous,
and their black caps. blue collars and
cuffs, studded with stars, gave them
jaanty appearance.


THE CENTENNIAL GUARDS,
with cooked hats trimmed with red, red
cuffs and, collars, were very much ad-
mlred also.


The van was. of course, preceded by
the Central Club, and included the old


HICKORY CLUB,
in citizens dress. Several brass and
field bands were In attendance.


THE w1LTz GUARDS,

proved Itself too small to contain the
great influx OF people, and the clubs

much like the Tilden Reform club, and

1_1876-05-17_p1_sn83016025_00279525401_1876051701_0491,The Portland daily press.,01,1876-05-17,p1,The Last Boomerang.,,"The sincere respect to which Mr.. A. G..
Riddle is entitled induces us to accord to his
arralgnment of Mr.. Blaine an amount of
space which it does not deserve, either on the
score oil Its importance or precision. The
whole effort proceeds upon an extraordinary
hallucination. Mr.. Riddle, conceiying that a
dead son-in-law was in some way affected by
Mr.. Blaine's vindication, attempts to defend
his memory by proving that the son.in-law at
different times told different stories concern
ing the same matter. This is bad enough,
but it is made worse by the additional card
from Mr.. III. L. Bridgman, which Mr. Riddles
publication compels. Mr.. Riddle prints let
ter from Gen. Boynton setting forth the story
Mr.. Knowlton told him, viz, that after
Blaine had been in private consultation with
Stewart for some time, in Stewart G. Riddles
law office, he (Knowlton) was called in to
sign as witness the legal transfer of t,venty-
fre $1,000 bonds. Mr.. Bridgman says that
the story Mr.. Knowlton told him was to the
effect that he signed as witness the legal
transfer for fifteen $1,000 bonds.


What Mr.. Riddle has, therefore, succeeded
in doing is to show that Mr.. Knowlton, in
undertaking to tell the same story successive
ly in the adjacent Washington offices of the
Cincinnati Gazette and OF the Boston Adcer-
tiser, made, in passing from one to the other.
change of S10.0OO-nearly one-half-in the
amount.


We must add, with the utmost kindness to
Mr.. Riddle, and everybody else concerned in
this business, the opinion that if Mr.. Blaine
were notorious horse thief, who had at last
been caught under the most suspicious cir
cumstances by.a border ruffian jury of Sheriff
Lynch's men, they could not be induced to
hang him unless they had something more
nearly approaching real evidence than any
thing that has yet been adduced against him
in this whole pitiful business. There may be
evidence that he has done something wrong
we ourselves once thought so-but if there is,
in Heavens name produce it. This tattle
about dead mans having told some people
story contradcting the story he told other
people about transfer of bonds in Mr..
Blaine's presence, which he guessed was to
Mr.. Blaine himself, begins to look like child
ishness"

THE GLORIOUS FOURTH.
A Big Time ""A.Comin'.""",,"About the most enthusiastic meeting ever
held here on the subject of celebrating the
Fourth was the meeting at the Court House on
last Saturday evening, in response to the can oi
many citizens, Thorough the city press, dodgers
drums and flies, Bach's band and fire crackers,
for all conspired to bring out crowd. Inc
court room was by far inadequate to hold all tnc
people and many turned away.


Mr.. T. +. Bull WAS made chairman ana u ~
Trimblc Secretary After some music ny Bachs
band, Mr.. Chas. Blanchard suggested the ap-
pointment Of Il committee to start things.


Mr. l.. A. Rising moved that the chair appoint
a committee of FIVE, to name committee OF
forty to make arrangements The chair then
anpointed L. A. Rising, Chas. Blanchard, Henry
Mayo, w. E. Bowman and II. Wather such com
mittee.


While these gentleman were making up their
committee of forty, short, appropriate and pa
triotic speeches were made by Capt. Thompson,
and Messrs. White, Ebersol, Trimbe, Smith,
Allen and Russell.


The committee of five then reported the fol-
lowing committee of forty, which was adopted;


A, Lynch, Chairman; Z. c. Allen, Jno f. Me.

and Dr. Petit


The secretary was then instructed to furnish
Mr.. Lynch with list of his committee, 10 mem
bers of which to form quorum, and the meet
ing adjourned with grand ""hurrah'


The fact of big celebration is therefore set
tied. The management was never in better
hands and there is no danger OF its running
into catch.peRny affair AS has been the case
too often. The managers are business and pro
fessional men of the best standing, and mean
business They mean to make this the most
elaborate and successful celebration Of the
Fourth ever held in the county, and to include
the entire country in the affair and they desire the
cooperation Of our neighbOrs interested IN the
matter to make it such. The plans have not yet
been arranged, but an interesting programme
may he Guaranteed."

 DEAR NEWS. Every season brings it's epidemics, sometimes ID one form, some times another but this year it comes in the differs from all other diseases: where oth- CTS originate in poverty and filth among the poorer classes, this is quite the reverse it rages particularly among the higher class. Nearly every family has felt it's influence, although comparatively harmless in it's physical effects, yet mentally it has pre- duced terrible strain, and financially de. pletion of purses. Perhaps you would be pleased to know that we have had this ter rble disease this ism-this centennialism If so, then here goes. We have had 1t in the full sense of the word. Now I wouldn't say word about it if it wasn't the most popular theme to write upon SO everybody says, and that makes it SO fur thermore, what we are to say upon this subject we intend to say this year, then let it drop for few years.

 We'll we have had centennial, conse- quently we are aged. Now as 1t has refer ence to age, there has always been class of very estimable ladies in our land that have felt great delicacY about their age j; but at last they have nobly come to the front and acknowledged themselves cen- tennarians. We thought bes. to start off 6 centennial old we think 1t has it's advan- tages we take our position in the land with all the attributes of manhood except size therein we differ from MT. Adam. He began life young, but full grown, and evidently not maiured in wisdom, as be was led to do some very foolish things. To be sure we are Q little under size, but we make up in age and wisdom. Did it never strike you MT. Editor, as being remarka ble, the number of people there are this year centennial old that never were be fore. The ladies wear centennial hats cool their heated brows with ccntennia fans, f1irt with centennial 'kerchicfs au( promenade in centennial number threes in fact everything is infected to greater O less extent. Even the little column of mer cury hanging by our doors scorns to ob serve us from any other point than the cen tennial point.

 Strictly speaking we are but five year old, but as that figure looks so insignifican we decided to change it to one hundred hence our centennial, and arranged it t' fall upon our national birthday. The da, was ushered in with the booming of cannon aud pealing of bells, and loug before day light it set med as though bedlam was le loose. By seven or eight o'clock in th morning the train from Kanawha Falls ar rived, bringing fifteen loaded care with peo pie from the back country, and until twelv o'clock the crowds continued to pour il from the mountains, until it was estimated that not less than five thousand had ar & centennial. The streets and building were decorated with arches of evergreens surmounted with that beautiful emblem 0 liberty so dear to the heart of the tru American-the stars and stripes-with sprinkling of other nationalities, as the Ger man. French and Irish flags, and Gs thei silken folds were waited to the breeze the, seemed to clasp our own true flag in lovinl embrace, proclaiming peace and good vii to all who seek our beautiful shores.

 Early in the day the procession wa formed, consisting of bands of music members of the different orders in full re galia, city and town officials with invite, guests. a regiment of cavalry, military con, panies representing the continentals, war O 1872 and the Mexican war, msgnificen car containing thirteen beautifully an, tastefully dressed young ladies representing the thirteen original states, and snothe containing eight for the territories, togeth CT with the grand marshal, Gen. John H Oley, and his score of ads, followed b, hundreds of citizens, made most imprcs sve sight as they marched through the diff ferent streets and thence to the grounds o Marshall College, where an oration wa given by MT. McGinnis of Guvaudottc wherein he gave brief history of ou country from its earliest discovery to tn , present time. The audience was very at tentive, and I'll warrant many of ther , learned more of the land of their birth tha , they ever knew before. The speaker, afte wishing we might all be reunited ut tn

 next centennial, pronounced us hundre years old, when refreshments were ar nounced at twenty-five cents per heat

 wherein many one got their first squar :, meal.

 The festivities of tho day closed with game of ball for silver cup, between clut

 from adjoining towns. In the evenin there was to be grand display of fir

 works, but had to be postponed on accoul 1 of terrific thunder storm, wherein Na,u gave us pyrotechnic display far beyor h the power of man. On the whole 1t was gr nl success-not casualty with one e !. ception. One man got clip with cou e ling from an Ohioan for hurrahing for Je |. Davls. They two were the only ones a n rested, which cannot be said of some ( our adjoining towns.

 # The authorities in the town where Il

 horse thief was lynched held an inque ,t over the body and brought in verdict ( e willful murder. Warrants were issued f' d the arrest of some of the most promln; lynchers, but the sheriff is supposed to hay .s kindly notified them beforehand, and {

Mar. Farrell asks for n New Assistant
Inspector for tho Ninth Ward
Closing C0urtesies.


The City Council held an adjourned
session, last evening, President LichA
tenstein in the chair.


The bills in the hands of the various
committees called for, reported upon,
and passed.


The Water Committee however
failed to report their bills, Mr.. Pyle
stated that during the afternoon he
and Mr.. Jones examined and signed
the bills in the Water Department
office, and left them. according to the
usual custom, lying on the table. But
since then they had disappeared and
could not be found. They amounted
to $167029. 1t was afterwards dis
covered that the bills had been brought
to the auditors office and left there.


Mr.. Farrell stated that the Inspector
and both Assistants of the Ninth
Ward were Republicans, and said he
presented. He would therefore move,
If in order, that Council proceed to
nominate and elect and Assistant In
spector.


The chail stated that he was not
aware that any vacancy existed.


Mr. Farrell said that the Assistant
Inspector, (Mlchael Sherry elected as
a Democrat but had since changed. {.
and is now an avowed Republican.


The chair said that both Inspectors
had been duly elected, and no vacancy
existed.


Mr.. Farrell said one of the Inspec-
tors should be Democrat, else the
election would be illegal. He read
from the City Charter to show that
Council can elect Inspector when the
officer elected ''declines, removes
from tho Ward. refuses TO serve. or is
unable to act"" He said the man was
proclimed Republican, and was there's
fore ""unable to act""


Tho chair could not construe the
charter in this manner, and the subject
was dropped,


On motion of Mr. Pyle,a note or $50,
600, at 90 days, directed to be dIscoun.
ted, in order to meet a note for like
amount due Sept. 7th.


The pay roll Of the Street Depart
ment, S9l3.S7, was read and passed.


On motion of Mr.. Pyle, orders foI
the salaries of members were directed
to be drawn.


Mr.. Lynch offered the following re-
solution:


ResOlred. That the warmest heart,
felt thanks of this body be and they
are hereby rendered to NJ. l.. Lichten
stein, Esq, as mark of respect fol
the kind, courteous and gentlemanly
manner in which he has acted, upoI

1t is with profound pleasure that we
assure the Honorable gentleman, thai
in our humble opinion, the just anC
impartial manner 10 which he hal
filled the position entrusted to him BY
the people, should not only meet will
our APPRECIATION, but should receiv,
the praise Of the entire community.


Mr.. Taylor put the resolution betor,
Council, and MIR. Lynch referred il
appropriate terms to President Lich
tenstein's official course.


Mr.. Mclntire also referred to thu
Presidents business and impartialit,
as presiding officer.


The resolution was then adopted, b,
a rising vote, and President Lichten
stein rendered his thanks for the higl
compliment rendered him. He fel
gratified that his efforts to preside falI
ly and impartially had met with tn
appreciation of the members, and hope,

of differences which had arisen dur

France, written June, 1874, and addressed
TO Mr.. J. l.. Winston, Of Lynchburg,
Va, which is chiefly noticeable as being
filed with generous sentiment towards
the South, and it consists entirely of
recollections of the meeting between the
Northern and Southern army officers
after the surrender at AppomattoI, at
which Mr.. Washburne was present. OF
the meeting, he writes;


when ] arrived at the courthouse
negotiations and pour pdrlers were going
On between the commissioners at Generel
Gibbons headquarters, at the house of
Mr.. MCLEAN, and then saw many of
the general officers on both sides. From
what one saw there it could hardly have
been conceived that these men had been
in arms against each other through more
than four years Of deadly strife. The
terror OF the breach, the fury of the
charge, and the fatigue of the march
seem to have been forgotten, and these
brave men came together more as friends
than enemies. In all OF their talks there
was never q suggestion nor a word from
either side that could have wounded the
tenderest susceptibility. Many Of these
officers on both sides had served together
in the old army, and it was touching and
interesting to witness the sympathy be.
tween them which had survived these
long years of conflict and carnage
There was one sentiment among all OF
these men, which seemed to crop out in
spite of themselves, and that was that
after all the bloody struggle of the past
they were still all Americans. The only
punishment saw inflicted was that OF
some large jugs of brandy which haC
found their way to the Union headquar
ters, and under the peculiar circum
stances that was not taken and deemed
as Cruel and unusual punishment
within the meaning OF the constitution.


The letter contains great deal of gen
erous praise of Gems. Gordon and La
mar, and other Southern officers."

upon the lheraiy oi the present Congress and the

reason which ut the present writing Is unaccountabc
that very serious In regard TO The
time ut which the mails must DO delivered on
The Post ONCE authorities and the railroad
officials. While the arrangements for tho tram
were being made, II 10 shown conclusivey bv the
correspondence that tram ""a which starts Ut twenty
hvc minutes past four O'Clock from this side Of the
river, was tho one selected and agreed upon. Nat
u,ay enough the Post Oico officials thought that by

Jersey City they would have ample time to make the
connection. Tue General super intendcnt OF the Penn
syivania RAILROAD Company, however, notified the
Division Superintendent OF the Railway Mail Service
that the mails or that train must lot be received later
than hali-past three O'Clock, over an hour before
the schedule time for the starting OF tho

The remaining members, Messrs. Febiger,
Jones, Underwood, Adams, Taylor, Payn-
ter, McGlinchey and Irelan, came into the
smile Chat they were permitted to return)
on their faces, and were soon called to
order by President M. L. Lichtenstein.
After roll call, on motion Of Mr.. Febiger
the Chair appointed Messrs. Fcbiger,
Jones and Paynter committee to examine
the Credentials of the newly elected Coun-
cilmen, The committee retired, and after
remaining out about three-quarters of an
hour they reported the following named
gentlemen duly qualified to hold seats in
Council to represent the Wards from which
they we're elected for two years


Thomas johnson, 1st Ward; B. Frank
Townsend, 2nd Caleb T. Windle, 3rd; Jno.
G.. Baker, 4th; VIM. Candy, 5th; Seth H.
Feaster, 9th; Philemma Chandler, 9TH;
Henry W. Downing, 8th: John Davis, 9th;
Louis P. Lynch, 10th, and H. F. Pickels,
for one year, from the 5th Ward. N


On motion of Mr.. Febiger the new mem
bers were sworn in by Mayor Whitley, ex-
eept Messrs. Chandler and Windle, who af-
firmed and all took their respective seats
and were addressed by the President as fol-
lows:


GENTLEMEN OF COUNCIL 1T is not
only proper but wise, that the managers of
a large corporation at the beginning ofa new
year should closely examine the state of
their finances, should clearly understand
the debit and credit sides OF their ledger, so
as to be able to faithfully perform the duties
they have pledged their honor to perform.
From the City Treasarer's books. I learn
that at this day, after the bulk of the taxes
has been received, there is no money left In
the treasury, while notes of some $39, 500
have to be provided for. Moreover, there
are $1,000 due the Cool Spring Reservoir,
81, 900 for interest, the orders for which have
been drawn, also 81, 200 for Redemption ol
Bonds, making total of $4,000. You
will, therefore, perceive that this Council
begins it's operations with 52,200 less than
nothing. l.H .n.a


THIS current expenses for four more
months before the close of our fiscal year
will have to be provided for. A large
amount will be needed to pay for paving oi
Walnut street, the contracts for which
have been signed, unless the contractor
should decide to have this work delayed
until we are better prepared to pay. AS an
offset, Gentlemen, you have only what may
be collected of the balance of city taxes,
and from the book of the City Auditor.
Gentlemen, this question is very serious
and difficult to solve. If can draw les
son from yesterdays election, it is that our
citizens desire all economical administration
of their affairs-that Council shall not con.
tinue in the trodden path-but retrench.
yes gentlemen, retrench on every point.
The people desire us to cut off all unneces
sary work, not to spend single dollar not
absolutely needed. The majority of this
Council will be held responsible # from
this day saving of at least $50, ,OOC
dollars year is not accomplished, from
our annual appropriations.


The Police Pay Roll for twelve months
was $19, ,10S.95, a reduction of 5000 will
am convinced, not produce many resigna-
tions.


The Miscellaneous Pay Roll for one veal
amounted to $l7 ,439 SO, q reduction O.
81, 900 will not diminish applications for the
positions by equally qualified persons.
The Street Cleaning Department has cost,
Including heavy pay roll on last Monday
$24 800. Gentlemen, q saving of $lS, 900 cal
be made here, and yet the streets can be
kept as clean as they are kept to-day.
The Water Department proper has cosl
$11 ,945.23, it, too, will stand reduction O.
s., 5000.


Add $4,000 for the Board of Public Edu-
cation, and $40, 900 for Street and Opening
Streets appropriations, and you have tota
| of $41, 900. It is not improbable that q re-
duction OF $4,000 may be made from the
| other appropriations, and we foot up $5o, WV
Continuing faithfully in this matter for two
wears, we will be enabled to sink The pres
eut floating debt into oblivion without
having recourse to the favorite mode ol
funding. Then, gentlemen, you may nave
the satisfaction of reducing taxation, and &c
YOU suppose that the citizens will think o.
changing government that honestly and
faithfully attends to the city's interest
You are aware gentlemen, that manufac-
turing establishments form the growth ana
prosperity of city all over this broad land
of ours, YOU may see the evidence, that
wherever such establishments are fOstere0
and protected, prosperity has been general
our own little city is no exception. II We
are successful in keeping down taxation
with our inexhaustible water supply, oul
excellent railroads and waite connections,w we
invite such establishments to be located
here, and thus find employment for our un-
employed mechanics and laboring men
Let us act unitedly to obtain such benefcia
results. All / ask of you gentlemen, OF
behalf of the city, is that you should use the
same prudence, the same economy, tht
same counting of the costs In the admin
istratiou of public business which you use
in your own business and your own house
holds. And now Gentlemen, allow me u
call your attention to some very important
matters that claim your attention.

the coming year render his acceptance simply

Mr.. Lynch may be relied upon, should he he elect,

Then he persuaded his father to let him take one
horse from the wagon hitched ready for farm
work, and ride to Madelia. The boy rode the
horse at the utmost speed he could get from it.
Once the horse fell, but the delay was short.
Along the road he shouted to the people that rob
bers were about, bat none would believe him. He
then rushed to the hotel in Madelia and told his
story. He was again doubted, but the landlord,
who knew him. vouched for bis being reliable. j.
Voght, landlord, Sheriff Glespin, William Estes,
and two Norwegians, quickly mounted aud armed
started out soon followed by fifty others.


The advance came in sight of the robbers FIVE
miles west of Madelia firing upon them without
effect. They we're walking deliberately over the
marsh where the horsemen could not follow, and
were out Of range. Once around the marsh a
prairie chase followed Horace Thompson, bank
er, of this city, and son with ladies' were on the
prarie cunning. The robbers made toward them

the skirmisbers and then was op, nod from all
around the coppice Three OF the robbers fell at
the first fire. One continued to fire. Having
been wounded before, probably at Mortified, he
had but one arm to use. but one of ais wounded
comrades loaded his pistol for him. When the
skirmlshers first opened fire one called TO the rob-

A political meeting was held at Port
Gibson, Miss. on Saturday last, at
which both parties were represented,
but the republican speaker, James
Lynch, colofed Congressman, declined
to speak on the ground that be was in
suited BY the democrats. A colored
democrat then made speech. during
which row was commenced, it is al
legged, by the republicans, (who deny
the charge, and the meeting broke up
in disorder. The sheriff Of the coupty
with large posse undertook to restore
order and arrest rioters, when the re-
publican negroes, under United States
Deputy Mashal Spratt, were vancouver
- into an ambush, from which they
fred upon the posse. but doing no dam
age. The latter returned the fire,
wounding one colored man. They then
captured several others and this ended
the disturbance The blacks were all
armed at the time Of the fight, having
previously secreted their weapons near
the town. The whites under the sheriff
were mainly unarmed On the strength
Of the affair Deputy Marshal Spratt an
nounces that there is terrorism in the
county, and says the republicans can
not vote unless protected by United
States troops. It may be added that
although there is a company Of United
States troops at Port Gibson the COM
manding officer did not see that their
services we're needed. consequently did
not interfere."

KELLOGG vs.. wARMoTn.",,"KELLOGG Fs. WARMOTH.


Kellogg and the whole Adnnistra-
ton are extremely hot on Warmoth,
and do not attempt to conceal their
vews about h1m in the least. They
mean war to the knife and will not give
up. II Warmoth be nominated they
will refuse to support him and look for
a third ticket in the field what sort Of
q ticket Is not said for which all their
influence aud patronage will be thrown.
Warmoth, Kellogg anticipates. will be
easily beaten by fifty thousand major
ity. His election would mean return
TO per cent taxes and new debt OF
twenty-five millions piled on the State.


GRANT VS.. wARNoTH.


He dares Warmoth to telegraph to
President Grant and ask for the latter $
conversation with him, Hahn, Packard
and Badger about him. He (Warmoth)
can get the news easily enough,
II he wants 1t, and more than enough.
Grant not only said he would not sup
port Warmoth, but that he could not
believe that any deeeut or honest man
could vote for him.


A-for the article in the National Re
publican, Kellogg believes that to have
been bought and paid for by Warlnoth,
as political capital for the campaign.
Under all circumstances the administra-
tiop quarrel with Warmoth will be
carried on to the death, and under no
circumstances can he be supported. His
nomination will split the party.


Cards and pamphlets were freely CIR
culated on the street abusing WarInQth:
Administration men, on the tail end OF
last nights drunk, were Grating against
the woes iunumerabie that his notnlna-
ton would bring to Louisiana and the
Radical party.


wAEMorH's HOPES.


The Warmoth men were quiet, made
no angry replies, laughed aud pointed
10 the rooms where the Committee on
Credentials were meeting. Their re-
ports will probably produce another
storm. There will be, of course, a ma
iority or Warmoth report, and g minor
ity or Administration report. The ques-
tion then arises In regard to contestants
voting on these reports. Packard has
majority OF the unconteSted seats, War
moth Of the contestants. The rules are
rather obscure and uncertain on this
subject. and much will depend on
Pinch's decision, ''and what that will
be, God only knows"" cried a despond-
ent AdministratioDist.


Warmoth's nomination Is yet by no
means sure. The election OF Pinch yes
terday on test vote sent Warmoth
stock up several degrees. rs 1t was pc
lieved that Pinch was trying 20 carry
| ""de Gunner"" However, this is rather
heavy load, and the Administrationists
proclaimed that il could not be done,
that several OF Pinch's men when 1t
came to voting for renegade would not
| have cheek enough to do 1t, but give In.
PACKARD.

Rumors were afloat that his name
would be taken down and Tom Ander.
son selected as standard bearer, as man
with fewer enemies. 60


Ludeling is virtually out OF the race

to anticlpate O Warmoth reaction anc
was leaning toward Warmoth.
AS it is now. Anderson and Warmotf
are the only two hopeful ones chances
about equal. Warmoth men are little
skeery about expressing their senti
ments.


Dibble is gone, but there is little
chance OF Steele getting the office o

Before the engineer Of. the House was ap-
pointed, be promised his present assistant
(GleDcy) the position which he now holds,
but upon securing the appointment, he re-
fused TO fulfill his promise. Cheney became
enraged at this, and sent several letters to his
friends soundly denouncing the engineer and
charging him with all manner of crime, from
petty theft to poisoning. The engineer, in
order TO hush matters up and effect a compro-
mise, sent for the misused Cheney, and gave
him the position promised. These letters i'm

After Mr.. Hooker had finished his speech
yesterday, In which he arrsigned the Repub-
lican party of Mississippi for corruption and
maladministration, Mr.. Lynch arose and an
swered the charges by strong and we'll
timed speeC h, which took at once the wind
out of the ails of the Democratic member,
Mr.. Lynch, whose wide experience In Missis-
sippi politics, renders him admirable authority
on all subjects relating to the affairs Of that
State, charged that there is an armed Or
ganization of White Liners in the State,
which was brought into existence for the ex-
press purpose of suppressing the elective
franchise Of the colored people by force and
intimidation; that this organization was a
part and parcel of the Democratic party, and
without its villainous influence that party
could never have gained the ascendency in
Mississippi. In answer to Mr.. Hooker's
charges of corruption and oppressive taxation
Mr.. Lynch produced figures which showed
conclusively that the taxes of the State under
the Ames administration had been reduced
nearly five mills on dollar, and the debt
nearly one half. 1t is very easy for such men
as Mr.. Hooker to present statements dressed
in all the rhetorical beauty Of the English
language, but it avails nothing in the face of
refuting facts, such as those given to the House
yesterday so ably and happily by Mr.. Lynch.


Is Fitzhugh crazy or is he too honest for the
Democrats in the House? Some time ago he
refused to turn over certain books relating to
the document room until an invoice of the
contents of that department had been taken.
He urged several of the Democratic members
to investigate the matter. He called their
to the fact that many thousand
volumes of valuable public documents are
missing from that department. The missing
documents consist of such works as ""Tbe
Medical History of the War;"" which is valued
at $50 q set in open market. He besought
them to look Into the matter and bring the
guilty parties to justice. Who are the guilty
partiesi There is a man named Fletcher in
the folding room who, perhaps, can answer
this question. He was Mr.. Samuel RandalPs

B. J. Fem, of Plymouth. The circumstances were these:

 On the 9th of last January Silas Car rington, of Bristol, was in the Derby Sta. tion at New Haven. waiting for the train. He was talking good deal. and rather loudly, when policeman in charge at the place told him to go and buy his tick ct. Darlington replied ""You be d--d,"" whereupon the policeman arrested him. MT. Fenn, who was standing by, interceded, telling the officer that Darlington was a peaceable man and that be would see that he went of on the next train without further trouble. The policeman told Fem to mind his own business or he would ar rest him, too. Fem continued to remon- strate, and the policeman did arrest him and took him to the court. where Fem insisted on trial, and was acquitted. On the trial here, the policeman insisted that he never arrested Fenn, but this state ment vas proved false by numerous wit nesses. The police officers also swore that Fem and Darlington were intoxicat- ed. which was unquestionably untrue, al- though they were naturally much excited and indignant at the treatment they had received.

 Another case occurred, recently, which, as reported. shows still more outrage ous disregard of tue rights of the citizen. Mir. David W. Thompson, a representa- tive in the present legislature from Beth lehem, drove to New Haven, on Saturday the 9th, to attend the funeral of the late Vicar Gen. Lynch, with whom he had had business relations. With him was Wa terbury gentleman named Longworth. There had also gone from Waterbury to the funeral a Mir. Michael Lynch. and man named Ash, who drove team hired in Waterbury by the latter with the understanding that he was to procure Q fresh horse in Naugatuck. On arriving at that place, Ash could not find another horse, and drove on with the Waterbury animal to New Haven, giving notice of the fact to the Waterbury liveryman The stable keeper was angry at this change of plan, and told the Waterbury police that Ash had stolen his horse. They tele- graphed at once to the New Haven police to arrest Ash. Messrs Thompson and Ash both drove to the Park House; and the policemen charged with the arrest of Ash, not knowing which of the party to take, by direction of the New Haven chief of police. seized all four, handcufed them and led them through the streets to the police station. There Longworth and Thompson were at once discharged; and, on the arrival of the Waterbury officer, Lynch was also allowed to go free. On Friday Longworth and Lynch sued the policemen who arrested them for false imprisonment; and Mir. Thompson has, we hear, brought suit against Chief of Police Allen and two of his subordinates.

 It Is getting time that these city police men should be taught that it is not a safe thing to seize any countryman they may chance to meet, handcuff, and hale him before their courts without any charge of crime against him; and. in fact, without any crime having been committed. Nor IS it to the credit or advantage of New Haven that it employs a set of foreign born catch polls reckless and stupid enough to arrest strangers charged with no crime, and brutal enough to drag them in irons through the streets of their city.

Tired Of.

[Lonisville Conrier-Journal.",,"WAsHINGTON, Feb. 1.-The South
ern Republicans had a caucus last night
at Millard Hall, which was numerously
attended by the carpet-bag persuasion
Among those present were Senators
West, Spencer, Clayton, Dorsey, Como
yer and Patterson. Alcorn looked OF
for ten minutes and then excused him
self Representatives Morey, Lynch,
Welles, Purman, and others, and Messrs.
Platt, Stowell and ex-Congressmau
Smith were also present. These were
reinforced by portion Of the office
seeking carpet-baggers now in the city.
Others were not invited, and are feeling
very sore about it, There was long
debate about the condition of affairs in
the South. Mr.. Purman asked, ""What
shall we do?"" to which Haralson, a ne
gro, replied, ""Draw your pay and quit the
State""


Spencer and Patterson were the prin-
cipal speakers. There was a good deal
of anxiety expressed to have a Supreme
Court decision confirming the constitu-
tionality of the enforcement act, as the
only way of carrying the elections. 1t
is said that the Supreme Court was about
equally divided.


Mr.. Patterson had had a most discour-
aging interview with the Attorney Gen
eral in which the latter had told him
that he was tired of these applications for
troops whenever a man was killed or mu-
tilated, and that the Administration was
tired of upholding rotten governments by
bayonets. He asked why they did not
appeal to the courts.


Mr.. Patterson said it was hopeless to
expect any more military aid from the
government, except to enforce the pro-
cess of the courts.


Mr.. Haralson, the colored member
from Alabama, was very severe upon
Spencer, and said the negroes preferred

Commissioner Kaufman called attention to the great
injury which must result to emigrants from andna

On Monday week, Sd inst, at poll
raising in Odessa, youth named HAYES
saw a notoriously bad fellow of Middletown
named John Whitlock in the act of un.
buckling the rens from the bride bit OF
Thomas Murray's horse, the lynch pins
having already been removed from the
wheels of the carriage. Hayes told Whit.
lock he was doing a mean trick when
Whitlock started to punish him. Just
then Edw. Thomas stepped in to defend
Hayes when the crowd interferred to pre-.
vent further trouble and Whitlock went
off. But in Middletown, that night, Whit
lock with a crowd of pals caught young
Thomas in the bar room of the National
Hotel and beat him terribly. Indeed, it is
thought he would have been killed but fol
the interference of friends.


On Wednesday complaint was made by
Mr.. Thomas before Magistrate Walker
Capt. j. NJ. Barr appeared for the com
plalnant. John Whtlock was held in
$4,000 bail, Theodore Whitlock in $500 and
William Whitlock, son of Theodore, il
$500, in default of which the two former
were committed to the New Castle Jail.


The Middletown Transcript says tha
John Whitlocl is the one who was tried a
New Castle at the last November term o
court for the murder of negro man in hi
grog shop in that place."

TROUBLE ANTICIPATED


The little court room OF the Fourth Judicial district
OF Brooklyn the of the inquest in the cases o.
the Fanny Hyde-watson, the Rogers Donohue,
the 0'Brien-whalen the Wallace wife nur.
ders and OF the terrible Dwyer tragedy,
will be thronged again to-day, TO listen
to the testimony in the atrocious and revolving
that has stained the annals Of Brooklyn Coro.
Nolan will at two p. NJ. commence his inquiry into
the death OF William W. Simmons at the hands of Vic.
tor Kretz, alias Andreas Fuchs. and has summoned
some twenty-five twenty-six witnesses The state
OF feeling among the people Of Williamsburg is
very bitter against Kretz, and threats have
been made of taking him from the hands OF
the police and lynching him, either on the way to
from tho court To prevent any such action
the part of the mob which will undoubtedly assemble
in the vicinity Of the Court House, situated the
ncr of South First and Fifth Streets strong force OF
police will assemble around 1t. The road to
and from the Jail will also be protected by
extra patromen. In addition to this covered
vehicle containing well armed policemen, will
follow closely the wake of the carriage containing
the prisoner. 1t thought altogether unsafe 70
convey him In the Maria as that would be TOO con
spicuous an object to pass unnoticed.


At the court one but representatives OF the
press the witnesses subp9naed and those whose duty
requires them to be present VIII be admitted except
by permission OF Coroner Nolan or Captain Woglom,
that crowd inside the Dullding Will De
inquest will probably be concluded before the end OF


the week. that the papers may be placed as speedily
as possible before the Grand Jury


SELLING HIS TALK.


A gentleman visiting Raymond Street Jail yesterday
afternoon attempted TO engage Kretz In conversation,
but was at once met with the question, ""Have you
| tobak-smokng tobakY"" ""No, l have none. ""
""Then, y said Kretz Il no talk.


Al this moment Of the jailors came down the
corridor and approaching his cell handed him paper
OF smoking tobacco through the door, The visitor then
said, ''Well you have tobacco, can't you answer
my question ?"" Kretz holding the paper up, replied,
''This your tobak; you give tobak talk no tobak
no talk go TO Williamsburg tomorrow; get plenty
tobak, cigar then me talk With this he retired TO
the back Of his cell.


ONE PucHs STATEMENTS coSTRADcrED.


1t will be remembered that during the OF his
examination Fuchs stated that he arrived IN this coun
try, from Hamburg, on the steamer Cimbra May l6,
1872 of course IL he had taken passage upon that
vessel his name would necessarily appear
upon the passenger list A HERALD reporter visited
the Office OF the Hamburg American Packet Company,
located 1t the Of Broad and Beaver Streets
yesterday and inquired for the passenger list Of the
Cimbria, which left Hamburg May and which arrived
here May 16 1872 The reporter found that upon that
particular voyage the Cmbra carried about AS passen
gers, but among the list such name Fuchs, Fox
or Kretz could be found The reporter, assisted
by Of the employees Of the company, went
the list very carefully, but failed to find what they
were searching for. Hence If the murderer did
tualy take passage upon the Cimbra May l6 1872 as
he says, he must have shipped under name different


from those which up to the present he has given tho
police."

FALSE STATEMENTS DENIED.


II is not true that the white people OF South Caro-.
Ina arS disIoyal or dsairectcd toward the United
States government. On tho contrary thcy are loyal
and well Affected toward H. They obey II AZ homo
and would defend il promptly from foreign aggression
II IL not true that South Carolina or any or It's

sor whatever ior tho federal government 10 interfere
for the protection 81 the Stale government against the
violence Of her citizens


II is not true that tho white people OF the state
are hostile TO the coorcd people or havo any desire
or cvl rights o. the contrary in their convent tons
ant, in the speeches Of their candidates fer six years
or more the most public and soen pledges have been
given that n tho rights oi tho coored people shall bc
respected and protected. The colorsd people should
know that these pledges viii bs faithfully kept.


CHARACTER OF THE RIsIE CLUBS


II is not true that the lew rO clubs the State are
combinations ot against the law that thoy
engaged numbering some pcaccablc citizens anu
tnidatng others or that they canno, be controlled
suppressed by the ordinary course OF justice. The
President has been deceived These Clubs existed
with tho knowledge ana recognition 0i the Governor.
Not one oi them over acted in defiance of law or
against tho government or constituted authorities.
The hosiiiity 10 them oi Governor Chamberlain and
his coadIuors is recent IL Is POLITICAL and rs designed
10 ancct The coming election


""l ~ not true that recent collisions the
whc people have been the agsrcssors. Thor forbcar
ancc as IN the Charleston riot, the unprcvoked Cam
hoy massacre and The still more recent assassination oi
white citizen at Edgeicid mas been wonderful The
truth that the leaders OF the coorcd people, tearing

excited their ignorant dupes have supplied them with
arms have aroused their ears Tor tho loss oi Their O

THINGS AFFIRMED.
1--WE may also affirm some tnings which are true -:
at is true that thcrc is the state most active
earnest and exccu canvass To overthrow corrupt rule
and ro-estabsh honest state government. This Is
legitimate and lawful object, which should command





try II treason defeat Cham bcrlan, is IL
insurrcctiOn to elect Hampton


at is true that, whilcthc white rifle clubs ordered
by tho Governor and the President dsband and as
pcrse, the coored militia o tho Statc are allowed to
remain IN organization and in possession OF their
arms. and 10 attend political meetings in military
order with rifles and other arms The object OF this
discrimination IL as obvious s the comparatively
dccncclcss condition which It places the white
population. Wo SIMPLY ask what would the ncopie
OF New York or Massachusetts think or do upon iko
application Of tho bsyonet principle to them under
such circumstances


Az ArrxAL To THE NORTH


'fellow counryncn, we havc sought 10 place before

plication to Judge Don A. Pardee, Of
the Second Judicial District Court. for u
decision Of the contestation. under the
law OF 1873.


As the matter stands, Judge Lynch
has obtained from Judge Tissot, OF the
Probate Court. sitting in the stead Of
lynch. recused. an order enjoining
Campbell from interfering in the oecu-
pancy Of the bench of the Superior Dis
trict Court.


Campbell as soon as Fardee decides,
If in his favor, will endeavor to obtain
the Sheriff of the parish of Orleans to
execute the process OF Pardee'S court,
and there's the rub


It Is true that Campbell's s case may be
taken to the Supreme Court. who will be
sitting Mt OpeiousaS by that time. and
the result will probably depend upon
the sympathies Of Ludeling with the
Kellogg or tho Lynch.


war horse, though still suffering from
illness, looks serene His opinion IS
that the law Of 1873 does not apply in
the least in Campbell's case. and the
matter may be considered at rest for
the present, so far as the authority of
the Superior District Court Is concerned.


Judge Tissot, again presiding, yester
day afternoon granted motion made

lawless revolutionary and corrupt char
acter OF the usurpatory Government
the President has established in Louis
lana. Fortunately. all the parties IN
interest IN the affair are Radicals. No
Democrat. Conservative Or White
Jeaguer had anything to do with it.
Even the Court itself is an infamous
spawn Of Radicalism. organized 70
persecute our people, and Is 10
them odious in the extreme. Az
tbe last session Of the Legislature
an act was passed abolishing 1t, ana
that act was regarded as one Or the cliiot
reform measures Of the session. But
Kellogg. desiring TO retain the oouft Tor
partisan and corrupt purposes. mas
failed to sign the bill, and the row begun
Yesterday and pending now. grew out OF
a struggle between tho Radical factions
To control this odious tribunal.


Hawkins, tho supple and nnscrupulous
tool of the party, presided over 1t Tor
long time. but during Keliogg's recent
splurge in Washington and Philadel-
phja Hawkins performed tho one net
or his life for which tho honest
reople of Louisiana feel grateful
to him he took To his bod aud died.
Antoine. acting as Lord Of Louisiana
at the time, appointed Judge y. y.
Lynch. Of the Fourth District, to the
vacant seat in the Superior District
Court. Barney Lynch Ia believed by
every person to be a tolorably honest
man. though no II n bitter, vindiotiye
Radical, and n negro lover OF the most
pronounced class. We do not propose to
bear Testimony TO the integrity OF Judge
I.ynch. but we do believe he is not the
worst man in his wicked and corrupt
party. Jtappears at any rate that he is
not the man who Kellogg desires should
succeed Hawkins. Of Infamous memory.
And. whatever Lynch may be, 1T Is evi-
dent that Kellogg. on his return from the
Centennial, realized that Antoine had
put up n Judge on him he could not run
TO suit himself. and no resolved to have
n new Judge Of his own


Several days ago 1t was known that
Kellogg intended, II possible, to dis
place Judge Lynch and appoint in his
stead either H. G.. Dibble or Hugh }.
Campbell, both Of them ranking among
the most corrupt and odious political
bummers in the State. Yesterday it
transpired that Hugh J. Campbell had
been chosen to run the Superior District
Court. A chief magistrate acting In the
public interests with Wow OF removing
an Objectionable official. or an official
holding a doubtful or disputed commits
sion, would have resorted to legal
methods, and proceeded through the
courts. But Mr. Kellogg did not adopt
this line of action. The official crea-
ture himself Of lawlessness. perjury and
violence, he has no idea OF government.
except bayonets. mobs and militia de

legality Of Antoine's appointment
of Lynch through the courts,
therefore. KolIvgg furnishod H,ah

Of the Superior District Court, and sent
him to take possession Of the bench n
ct a,mis. Campbell accordingly gather
cd squad of Metropolitan police ten
or twelve strong headed by Captain
Lawler, marched into the court
and assumed possession. Subse-
auently, Mr.. Wurzberger. the Chief
Deputy Of Gen. Waggaman. the
Civil Sheriff, found the Superior District
Court occupied by LAWYERS peelers.
sent for Goy. McEnery, the legal ad
wiser of the Sheriff. and, after consulta-
ton with him. ordered Lawler to with
draw his mon, rs the courts were In the
possession of tho Civil Sheriff, saying
that, though no conflict was desired, the
authority Of the Sheriff would be main
tanned. Campbell then advanced to
Gov. McEnery, displaying his commits
sion rs Judge Of the Superior District
Court Gov MCEnery promptly replied
that there had been enough coup d'etdfs;
enough violence and lawlessness in the
State. and that ii he (CampbelD had
claim to tho iudgeship it was his duty
to prosecute it through the courts. and
not attempt. to seize it by violence and in
timidation. Campbell. abashed, turned
away, and, with Lawler and his Metro
politans, left the Court to Judge Lynch
and the recognized civil authorities. And
thus the case stands at this time.


II will be noticed that neither Demo
Gratis, Conservatives or White Leaguers.
rs we have previously remarked, had
anything to do with this law
less proceeding. The Civil Sheriff,
his deputy. Mr.. Wurzberger, and
Governor McEnery, his legal adviser,
are pronounced Democrats, it is true,
but they only interferred to prevent VIC
lcnoc to preserve the law and to pro
tect the public peace. Judge Lynch
was appointed to the disputed Judge
ship by Antoine. doubtless because he is
one Of the most pronounced advocates
of the rights, etc, Of the negro r2ce.
Kellogg desired to displace him. be

Lynch is governed BY a sort Of cranky"

Moscley, of Richmond, DIR. W. b. Robertson,
Of Lynchburg, and Professor NJ. c. Ellsey,
of Blacksburg, who have been extremely ac-
tive in the discharge Of their duties, although
with very limited appropriation at their
command. The report is very creditable to
them, and shows a comprehension OF the
problem to be solved in regard to the pro-
lection and multiplication Of food fishes in
Virginia As might have been expected, the
shad and the striped aud black bass received
special attention on their part. Much also
has been done in regard 10 the Introduction
Of the California salmon, that fish of the
future. They obtained large number of
eggs from the United States Fish Commission
for which they established two Matching
houses, one at Blacksburg college and the
other at the Virginia Military Institute, and
they propose to have others hereafter at the
University of Charlottesville and at the
Hampden school, at IIampden, whenever
their funds viii permit. The young fish will
probably be soon introduced into their new
quarters IN appropriate streams in Virginia.
The Commissioners also did what they could
toward propagating the shad, although the
season was unfavorable for the fullest meas
ure of success.

body. aud there was no exhibition ~
excitement Of any kind. no loud talking
and no whisky.


Previous to their execution Austin

that the party had been concorting tho

knocked his victim on tho head IIollo-
way turned tho bodies over. and stephen
cut their threats. After the murder the
house was gutted Of everything vnIu-

tho crime was unusually horrible, and

such as to provoke resort to means Of

 remarkable for succession of high tra- gedies. On Sunday night last, three ''roughs"" called about midnight at pub i lie house, four miles west of town, kept by widow woman, demanding entrance. Soon after they were heard breaking in 8 back door A hired man stood inside with club, and when the door opened wrenched pistol from the hand of one of them, whereupon the others commenced firing at him but without effect. while he called to the woman of the house for his pistols. Finding plucky resistance, they decamped, but brought up towards morn ing at saloon kept by an old German, in the suburbs of the city, whom they found lying on lounge, and beat and kicked till he was insensible, then shot at his wife, and finished up by robbing the house. 1t was early noised abroad, and suspicion rested on one-armed despera- do who has served several terms in prisons and jails, and who was a terror to his ac- | quaintances and the neighborhood west of town where his father lives. Many have been waylaid-not excepting his father whom he laid under contribution. Hence, he was arrested and placed in the engine house the ""lock-up"" being food ed by the freshet in the river), and tied to the engine with ball and chain attached to his leg. About two o'clock, the watch man, whose duty it was to look after him, called and found him asleep in sort of drunken stupor, he having been drinking heavily through the day. Two hours later he called again and found him sus- pended by the neck, in good .hangman style, about four feet high, the ball and chain still hanging to his leg and he cold in death. Some parties had stealthily en- tered and strung him up, but not, as it seems, till after he had been knocked in- sensible, there being several wounds on his head, none. however, sufficient to prove fatal. He was a powerful fellow, and there are indications that he made the best fight he could under the circum- stances. There is no clew to the perpe trators, but it is generally thought it was done by some friends of the German whom he had so unmercifully maltreated. I believe he vas recognized as one of the party. While all felt relief to be rid of him, many feel deeply the shame and dis grace of the manner of his taking of. Our local paper repudiates it as case of ''lYnching"" and calls it a case of deliber- ate murder on the part of the perpetra- tors.

 The next night. few miles west of the scene of the first outrage, sober and in- dustrious young man who was bringing in a load of old iron late at night, was killed. either by accident or design, public opinion being about equally divided on the question. His body was found next morning lying in the middle of the road, with his neck broken and jaw crushed. At first it was supposed he had fallen from the wagon and had been run over. but the indications are that he was robbed and perhaps murdered. as he took out a load of wrapping paper which, if sold for money, with the cash he took with him, would have left him between forty and fifty dollars, while only twenty cents was found on his person. His team was found tied to. the fence some distance from where the body lay. He left wife and four children in destitute circumstances, for whom generous subscription is being taken up.

 These tragedies. with suicide and two jail deliveries in this county during the past ten days, furnish sufficient excite ment of the kind to last for some time, we hope. There are also some comedies to offset, the Argument"" of one of which is as follows

 A newly married couple, who had con- mendable desire to do the agreeable, in- vited in some friends to help get away with nice fat turkey. The dinner pro, gressed finely till nearly through, when little more dressing was wanted. The host struck his carving knife into the bird near the neck and gave it turn; where upon he felt tremendous grating, and the whole truth flashing in upon his mind he suddenly felt a strong desire to seek some silent nook unseen by mortal eye, where he could relieve his pent up feel ings. How the matter ended deponent saith not, but it is safe to assume that it will be some time before that blushing bride will cook another turkey with the crop in.

tracted sickness. Moral suasion is the gov.
ernlng element in this institution, the rod
being never resorted to except In cases OF ex-
treme stubborness, etc. Prizes given month
ly for proficiency in spelling, etc. hope no
patron of mine will ever think for minute
that punish child wrongfully, or show any
fayors In this respect or any other, as never
do. 1t has always been part OF my study
to guard against this, and to treat all the
same in every respect. There is only ONE
way of doing in this school; that is Learn
YOU MUST. Parents should not notice every
trifiing thing. Children are apt TO misrepre-
sent. misaT prehend and misconstrue sayings
and doings OF the teacher; so In case OF any
dissatisfaction between teacher and pupil or
pupil and pupil, and any parent wishes TO
hear the correct statement, please call at the
school rooms, and i will explain before the
school, etc. Application must be made prior
rooms on the Both, Sst of December, and LIST
of January, in the afternoon.

Tie valuo of the enclosure not yet ascertained. A man by the name of Hendricks is under arrest, charged with the deed, but what proof positive, or circumstantial, there is against him we are not advised. He has been taken to Little Rock for investigation. In the same sack were many other registered letters, much more val. uable. perhaps than those pGr- Joined, but the hurry of the thief, darkness, or other cause protect ed them. It is sad that the world is so dishonest. Every thing of this sort works hardship OH somebody.

 Ft. Smith Herald: Broke jail is again tie cry, and on last Fri day night three prisoners, one Indian and two negroes, confined in the county jail on Potcau, made their escape. They were assisted from the outside. Oliver Polk, once q candidate on the radical ticket for State Senator, was one of the birds. If they will stay gone, think Sebastian county won't lose much. How ever, the frequent recurrence of jail delivery in nearly every coun ty in the State, and several times in this, should admonish us that if the jails be not secure and safe to keep prisoners, they should be guarded. Diligent search was made for the escaped, but with out success.

 Jacksonport Herald: MT. Toni Britt, of Richwoods township, was in town on wednesday last in some trouble. It seems that on Tuesday he loaned his mule sad dIe aed bridle to one Jesse Will Hams, who wanted them for the purpose of coming here to obtain a license, to marry. Jesse not only forgot to secure the lcense, but neglected to return the rrop- erty, and skipped out iii the df rcction of Texas. Brit, who was accompanied by friend; borrow ed the necessary shot guns and took the track. If they catch the young man there will be some fun. Williams is about twenty five years of age.

 Corning Express. A young man named Charles Grosch, has been staying in our town for some months. He was engineer at Smith < Betts' mill, and boarded at the Central Hotel. Saturday night he left suddenly, forgetting to pay his boaid bill, and after breaking open a trunk belonging to Dr, Marchand, and abstracting ten dollars therefrom. Grosch is a native of Marietta, Pa. and pro fesses to be the son of Q gentle man who is highly respected and the cashier of the First National Bank at that place.

 

 Boonville Enterprise: The car Tier on the mail route to Tumhn- son informed us on wednesday evening that two persons hml

Said parties were in jail and from movements thrt were on foot when our in formant left there it was thought there might an application of the lynch law in contemplation, we were also informed that Floyd refusing to be arrested.

been announced the Hon. Henry Stan
berry, of Cincinnati, ex-Attorney Gener-
al of the United States, has written an
able constitutional argument upon the
South Carolina case, condemning the use
of federal troops in the State. Among
other things he said:


""In all our political history, from the
beginning down to the centennial year, 1
cannot call to mind any armed interven-
ton by the federal government, based
upon q proclamation and the military
orders in question except to put down an
insurrection. The uprising of the people
of Rhode Island to overthrow the govern
ment of that State and change its consti-
tuition by force of arms, commonly called
the Dorr rebellion, was of that charac-
ter. There has been great deal of
domestic violence in many of the States;
unlawful combinations to violate the
rights of its citizens and substitute Lynch
law in place of the lawful authority, and
vigilence committees in place of the re-
gular State officials, and all these have


been wisly left to be dealt with by the
local authority. Our people have tradi-
tional dread of military interference.
They prefer that their political contests
and their individual rights shall be kept
sacred from the military power. 1mper-


feet as the civil law and local power of Il


State may be in giving them the protec-
| ton, they will never consent to come un-
der abe power of the military, except in
| those extreme cases where force must be
opposed by superior force to preserve the
State"""

From V. g. A. r. Tatman and others

Mr.. Pickels offered an ordinance re-
pealing the ''ordinance regulating the
pay o: laborers in thes.employ of the
city, passed April 18th, 1876"" Read
twice,


He also offered AMI ordinance maxi
ing an extraordinary appropriation for
the benefit of the appropriation for

On motion of Mr.. Pickels an order

on the 25th inst,


Orders were also directed to be
drawn for interest due sundry bond
holders. amounting to 50, ,33s,O3.


Mr.. Underwood offered the following
preamble and resolution.


Whereas. On the 26th of August
last, contract for the grading of Wal
nut streets, from Front to Fourteenth
streets. was made by the city with a
person representing himself to be Pa
trick Murphey, q bidder for the same,
| anu WuObC DAo udb UCCn dCCCpbCo p1
the committee to whom it was referred,
and


Whereas, it appears to the satisfac-
tion of the committee that the person
representing himself to be the said Pat
rick Murphey is named VIM. O'Brien,
and that the said VIM. O'Brien, OBJ
tanned the said contract by misrepre--
sentatlons and fraud. therefore,


Resolped, By this Council that the
said contract is hereby revoked and de.
clared null and void, and of no effect
whatsoever.


Mr.. Paynter objected to the imme-
diate adoption of the resolution. He
said he understood Patrick Murphey
was the contractor; but If the old
Street Committee was deceived, the
present committee was also likely to
be.


Mr.. Underwood said that Patrick
Murphey's name was VIM. O'Brien,
and that he was employed on the
Street Department, on the recon-
mendation of Mr.. Ford.
Mr.. Ford denied that he had recon-
mended the man.


Mr.. Lynch moved to lay the matter
over one week.


Mr.. Baker said that Patrick Murphey
was myth. and that Wn. O'Brien
had signed the contract as Patrick
Murphey, and that he was evidently
backed up by some one else.


Mr.. McGlinchey was of the opinion
that the contract was worthless, and
that if O'Brien had signed it as Patrick
Murphey he could not obtain any
money.


The contract was called for and read
II was signed ""Patrick Murphey"" with
Patrick Sullivan and Michael Hayes as
sureties.


Mr.. Baker said that the Street Com
A mittee did not propose to allow the
work to go on above Third street, il
the matter was laid over one week.


Mr.. Febiger, asked Mr.. Ford if ht
knew such a man as Patrick Murphey


Mr., Ford said he did.
=. Mr.. Febiger asked if Mr.. Murpbey
signed the contract.
Mr., Ford said he did moi know; he
J. had hired his teams to the sureties, ,anG
would hire them to any one who
. would pay for them.
y The motion to lay over one weel
n was lost, and the preamble and resolu
n tions were adopted:
4 Mr.. Underwood also offered aresolu
= tion stating that VIM. B. Davis held
e contract for procuring stone from tn
IF Eleventh street quarry, which wa
s never authorized by Council, and de
claring the same null and void; an


further ordering the Street Commis
= sioner to depose the said William L


Davis,

q was made by the Street Committe,
K; and was not authorized by Council"

a Virginia Democrat hereafter has aught to

there to hear to the end, that he may be

morning A Gordon of police was formed across
Washington-st near its junction with Fulton-aVe.
and at its intersection with Johnson-st but outside
of this line the multitude pressed closely one upon
another, striving to catch glimpse OF the ruins
and of the work which was in progress. Similar
throngs filed all the streets through which the veh
clcs containing the remains were drven. The crowd
wa. 20 great that il almost an imposslbllity tor
those who permitted 70 enter the lines to make
their way through it. All classes of people COM
posed the asSemblage-wOmen and Children, as wen
as mcn-all drawn to the spot by an excitement
which leyeed all distinctions of age or sex. The
determination on the part of the people to see all
that was possible led them to resort to all sorts Of
subterfuges to gain admission within the
limits, and only the excellent police ar
rangements kept them from encroach-
ing upon the scene Of the disaster and interfering
with those engaged in the labor of removing the
bodies A gentleman who with several companions
was held fast in tho midst of tho surgng crowd,
powerless to move hand or foot said: 1--WE Gre In
much the position as the poor wretches who
persisted last night. Only think how they must
have felt, knowing the flames were close behind
them, while they were helplessly involved in the
mad rush for the stairway"" This suggestion was so
shocking as to cause his hearers to shudder invol-
unfairly. The asscmblage generally seemed to
realize the greatness Of the calamity, and hush
unusual in such large gathering held possession OF

buildings having low roofs which commanded a
view of the scene were also occupied by the anxious
crowd.


The appearance Of the front of the thcater was
much as usual except that the glass windows in the
tower were broken and the doors were much shat
tered. Dicters restaurant was not materially In-
iurcd and was open. The people who were allowed

They were then placed in the undertakers

sight caused many strong men to turn away from
the spot with fearful eyes.


Tho First Precinct Staton-honse was filed with
an anxious crowd Of persons inQuring to the fate
Of friends and with officers reporters aud those en-
cagcd in the sad task of removing the dead Be
hind the desk was a large pile Of ovcrcOats, hats,
and clothing Of various kinds, picked up by Officers
about the scene of the disaster.


All day long the work went steadily on, and rs the
nnmLcr of the dead increased far beyond what the
widest rumors had stated 1t, the excitement deep
cnod and an anxious and hcartsicA expression set
tied on the faces of those whose sad duty II was to
assist in the recovery OF the bodies. The ambu-

lawless, revolutionary and corrupt char
acter OF the usurpatory Government
the President has established In Louis
lana. Fortunately, all the parties In
interest Ia the affair are Radicals. No
Democrat. Conservative or White
JeaCuer had anything to do with it,
Even the Court itself Is an Infamous
spawn Of Radicalism, organized to
persecute our people, and IL to
them odious in the extreme. At
the last session or The Legislature
an act was pissed abclishing 1t. aud
that act was regarded as one OF tho chief
reform measures OF the session. But
Kellogg, desiring to retain the court Tor
partisan and corrupt purposes, mas
failed to sign tho bill, and the row begun
Yesterday and pending now. grew out OF
a atr,ivgle between the Radical factions
To control this odious tribunal.

long time, but during Kellogg's recent
eplurge In Washington and Philadel-
phin Hawkins perform the one act
OF his life for which the honest
people "" Louisiana feel grateful
to him he took to his bed and died.
Antoine, acting rs Lord OF Louisiana
at the time appointed Judge u. Y.
lynch. of tue Fourth District. to the
vacant seat in the superior District
Court. Barney Lynch is believed by
every person to be % tolerably honest
man. though he is u bitter. vndlctiye
Radical, and negro lover of the most
pronounced clase. We do not propose to
bear testimony TO the integrity Of Judge
Lynch. but we do believe he is not the
worst man IN his wicked and corrupt
party. It appears ut any rate that he 1s
not the man who Kellogg desires should
succeed Hawking. Of infamous memory.
And. whatever Lynch may be. 1t is evil
dent that Kellogg, on his return from the
Centennial realized that Antoine had
put upa judge on him he could not run

a new Judge Of his own


Several days ago II was known that
Kellogg Intended. If possible. to dis
place Judge Lynch and appoint In his
stead either Fl. @. Dibble or Hugh J.
Campbell, both Of them ranking among
the most corrupt and odious political
bummers in the State. Yesterday IL
transpired that Hugh J. Campbell had
been chosen to run the Superior District
Court. A chief magistrate acting in the
public interests with a view OF removing
an objectionable official. or an official
holding doubtful or disputed commits
sion. would have resorted to legal
methods, and proceeded through the
courts. But Mr. Kellogg did not adopt
this line OF action. The official crea-
ture himselfof lawlcssness, perjury and
violence. he has no idea Of government.
except bayonets. mobs and militia de-
monstratione. Instead Of testing the
legality OF Antoine's appointment
Of Lynch through tho courts,
thercfofe. Kellogg furnished Hugh
J. Campbell with commission as Judge
OF the Superior District Court, and sent
him to take possession OF tho bench Vi
et armis. Campbell accordingly gather
cd squad of Metropolitan police ten
or twelve strong headed by Captain
Lawler, marched into the court
and assumed possession. Subse-
qucntly. Mr.. Wurzberger. the Chief
Deputy OF Gen. Waggaman. the
Civil Sheriff. found the Superior District
Court occupied by LAWYERS peelers,
sent for Gov. McEnery, the legal ad-
wiser of the Sheriff. and, after consulta-
tion with him. ordered Lawler to with
draw his men, rs the courts were In the
possession Of the Civil Sheriff, saying
that, though no conflict WAS desired. the
authority OF the Sheriff would be main
tAined. Campbell then advanced to
Gov. McEnery, displaying his commits
sion as Judge Of the Superior District
Court. Gov. McEnery promptly replied
that there had been enough coup d'etats;
enough violence and lawlessnees in the
State, and that il he tCampbelD had
claim to the judgeship 1t was his duty
to prosecute it through the courts, and
not attempt to seize it by violence and in
timidation. Campbell. abashed, turned
y,
politans, left the Court to Judge Lynch
and the recognized civil authorities. And
thus the case stands at this time.


1t will be noticed that neither Demo
crats, Conservatives or White Leaguers,
as we have previously remarked, had
anything to do with this law
less proceeding. The Civil Sheriff,
his deputy, Mr.. Wurzberger, and
Governor McEnery, his legal adviser,
are pronounced Democrats, it is true,
but they only interferred to prevent vio
lence; to preserve the law and to pro
tect the public peace. Judge Lynch
was appointed TO the disputed Judge
ship by Antoine, doubtless because he is
one Of the most pronounced advocates
Of the rights, etc, Of the negro race.

 conveniences within a moments walk, it

 should be filled to it's fullest extent with

 drawback to visitors from New York city

 is the lack of railroad accommodations,

 people who wish to get into the country ir

 true of other places than Lakeville. Land lord Russell of tbis village would reap } benefit from it, and it would be a substan

Special Dispatch to the N. Y. Times.


WARRINGTON, Oct. 24.-Private and Off
cial intelligence received here shows that
the same system of terrorism that Wade
Hampton and his followers had been prac-
ticing with impunity in South Carolina,
prior to the arrival of United States troops
in that State, prevails in Mississippi and
Louisiana. Dispatched received to-day
state that an armed body, con-
sisting of about five hundred men,
prevented Congressman Lynch, of Missis-
sippi, from addressing Republican meet
ing on Saturday last at Port Gibson. The
hooting, yelling and riotous demonstrations
of the armed mob made lit impossible for
Mr.. Lynch to address those who had assem-
bled to listen to him, and he was forced to
abandon the stand and advise the people to
go home.


Capt. Hale, of the Sixteenth Infantry,
commanding the United States troops at
Monroe, La, makes the following report to
the War DEPARTMENT about affairs in his vi
clnity MATTERS in remote parts of Qua
chita Parish are somewhat unsettled. AL
most daily complaints are made to me by
negroes of being driven from plantations
and from employment, either because they
had attended Republican meetings, or be-
cause Of their refusal to unite with Demo-
cratic clubs. Many OF them complain of
having been treated with personal vio-
lence, and some of having had their cabins
broken open and gun-shots fired into them.
| From careful observation, am induced to
believe that is the determination of the
majority of the white people here, as we'll
as elsewhere in the State, to elect the can
didates of the Democratic State and Parish
tickets at all hazards, and that the success
of their candidates on the national ticket
is to them only matter of secondary i'm
portance.""


Capt. Hale also reports that, a short dis
tance from Monroe, two disguised white
men fired upon and instantly killed Prince
johnson, a colored preacher, and seriously
wounded another colored man named Eat
on Longwood At the time of the murder,
johnson was standing on the porch in front
Of his house. with his infant daughter in
his arms, and Longwood was employed in
his field loading seed cotton. Two physi-
clans, residing in the locality Of
the murder, whose services were So
licited for the wounded man, re
yfused to attend him. The road was
I found picketed with armed men, who re-
| fused to permit LoDgwood's brother to visit
1 Monroe to obtain surgical aid. In cOnse-
1 quence of threats made by the mob to do
Nturther violence and murder, Capt. Hale
detailed a force to guard the house of
Longwood. Capt. Hale's reports were trans
mitted through the regular military chan

The City Council met last evening, Presi-
dent Lichtenstein in the chair.


The Lamp Committee reported adversely
for lamps on Fifth between Walnut and
Poplar on Lombard between 9th and 10th,
and 10th and 18th streets and on the petit
ton to change certain oil lamps to gas
lamps the committee was continued until
January, 1877.


""a report in favor of opening Tatnall
street from 23d to Elliott Avenue was
adopted, the estimated cost being Bis, and
an adverse report to open Van Buren, street
from Delaware Avenue to Cool Spring Res
ervoir was also adopted.


Several bills reported by the Committee
on Opening streets were laid over on ac-
count of the appropriation for that depart
ment having been exhausted.


Mr.. Windle, from the Committee on
Printing reported that any violation of the
contract with the 0'Byrne Bros. for print
ing was not intentional, and that hereafter

The City Treasurer reported $7441 to the

Upon the reading of the Auditors report
signed by Joseph L. Beggs, per Charles a..
Mcguire, clerk, Mr.. Baker inquired whether
report signed in such manner was legal,
as Mr.. Mcguire was merely a clerk and not
bonded officer. Mr. .Paynter thought that
Mr.. Mcguire was responsible to the Audi
tor and the Auditor to the City Council.


The City Solicitor being present, gave it
as his opinion that Mcguire being elected
by the City Council to be the clerk of the
Auditor, had right to sign documents for
that officer as, ""per j. Mcguire, clerk""
Mr.. Baker said he was not objecting to
Mr.. Mcguire, for he had every confidence
in him, but in his business he would require
a power of attorney before his clerk could
sign legal documents for him.
Mr.. McIntire, late Water Registrar, re-
ported $537.36 collected and paid into the
Treasury since last report.

rem. The Judge closed his opinion thus:


In view OF these principles and the cvi-
uehce submitted at the hearing ii is difficult
70 understand on what ground or pretcnSe
'iC lathef can demand the possession Of his
Tiil""reh' except upon the theory that there
HAS grown up IN hls heart new and sin
ccre love for his offspring, consequent upon
his reformation and his reDentancn for tbo
past, and that he desires from the rurest
and best motives that can actrate human
conduct, to have their custody, that he may
ENJOY the comfort and pleasure of their So
clety. But all this, while it may excite
sympathy and move to pity, does not rc.
store his forfeited rights, which are as far
as concerns this proceeding as if they had
never existed. There is no element of min.
ciple OF OF TACT TO reason upon in his favor


ne law and the evidence combine to pro
nounce against his claim. Noreported ease
can be found in which there is less show of
right. Admitting that the death of Mrs.
Lynch repealed the act of divorce. and that
the guardianship Of the children was not
asslgnable by her, it does not follow that
the father is entitled to have them. After
the granting of the divorce and during the
ilie OF the mother, he certainly could moi
nave claimed their custody. On her death.
they found new home and formed new re-.
lationS. Where could they have gone if
the grandfather had not o|enel his heart
ana house to receive them? The fatber
had no home to shelter or means to .urnort
them. Save for the grandfather ihcy
might have been cast upon the charity OF
the public. But the act Of the Legislature
Is stlil in force and is conclusive. It obro.
gated the right Of Lynch to the care and
control OF his children, and only by thrir
consent can that right be retrieved."

Little Joe Horner~


Snt in II corner


Sucking his thumb""


1t all occurred in lawsuit, u very
) small one in appearance, but great
enough to show once more how uncer


tain is the law, and, above all, the cor


rectness Of Nosey's proposition.


A few days ago Mr.. Chas. J.. Howard,


President Of the Louisiana State Lot
tery Company. brought suit in the Su


perior District Court against Durant da
Ponte, Esq, on ""a promssory note for
$3.50 and interest. This was answered
by u general denial and the plea that
the Louisiana Lottery Company, having
no banking privileges, was not empow-
cred to discount notes. and further,
that dofendant' had much larger
claim against the plaintiff, then pending
or about to be entered in the United
States Circuit Court. With q rapidity
that would be highly commendable II
manifested generally, the case was fixed
and decided within ten days, and de-
fendant was squelched. in the legal parA
lance of the deputy clerks Of the Court
house. Pending the proceeding. JOS
Hornor, ESD, representing the plaintiff,
probably with the conviction that, the
suit being so insignificant, the defend
ant would be willing to abide by the de-
cision Of Lynch's court, entered u re-
mittiture OF fifty dollars OF the face of
the note and the interest, thereby shaw
ing the amount down to an unappeal-
able condition. Mr.. Lazarus, the
defendants attorney, whose nose
is rs proverbial as our own,
began to think that that end Of himself
was either becoming less sensitive or
was ""drove in.' In vain did he search
the quickest recesses of his subtle brain
to discover some plan by which he could
increase those five hundred dollare one
dollar more, in order to enable him to
take an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Not even the financial ingenuity Of Eu-
gene Levy the broker, could assist him
in his legal difficulty. But, lol that
nose, sirs, that nose, the ferret OF his
phiz, suddenly poxed itself into the dusty
pigeon holes Of the clerk 8 office of the
Superior Court, and, behold! there was
the Judges signature fixed in indellble
hieroglyphics to the judgment, which,
in plain and unmistakable words, de
creed five hundred dollars nHd interest
| i'm favor OF the plaintiff; just the problem
| that Levy bipaeclf had been unable to
solve
/ The clerk of the court, it seems, al
| though he had carefully eliminated
| the remitted fifty dollars, had forgotten
| to leave out the interest. And thus was
| Lazarus raised from the dead and little
| Joe Hornor sat in corner, whilst De-
metrius, the silversmitb. raised an up
| roar.


| Nosey finding such formidable rival
in q member of the legal fraternity, de-
| termined at once to emulate him in his
own field. He bethought himself OF
several plans, but only succeeded in
conceiving the dastardly project Of in
fringing on somebody's patent by con-
verting his nose into pump handle. |
After further and more mature reHec- |
ton the project was, abandoned, and
Nnsey walked into the CustOmhouse |
q strong odor of Guayava Jelly, tire susae 81 ne |
which probably prompted Dom Pedro to
ask one of the officials. on the occasion |
Of His Maiesty's visit to- the granite
building, to show him some OF zem
Guayava cigars"" Certainly this odor |
had some connection with law, but not
civil law, and the latter was what Nosey |
was in search of. Presently, however, |
he chanced to run against an odd look !
ing little old man, whom he recognized !
as Tom Scandal, with q bag on his |
shoulder and hooked stick in his hand,
picking up scraps Of paper and parch- |
ment along the sombre corridors |
of the edilice. Nosey was prompt
ed to ask him what he was |
doing. Tom replied, with the |
utmost serenity, that it was none Of his |
business, but recognizing Nosey he told |
him that his occupation consisted in |
picking UP court decisions in anticipa-
tion Of their being rendered, and by |
hawking them about the streets he
made a fair living. Business had been |
dull during the past week, but he |
thought he had just picked up scrap !
that might prove profitable. 1t was
part of a decision in the injunction
phase Of the suit against the Lottery |
Company, in which plaintiff was put out
Of court because he had had the audacity
to prove that the stock on which he was
suing was his own, although it stood In
another mans name, and the man In |
whose name the stock was entered In
the Lottery Company's books had had
the candor to swear that such was the
case. Nosey thanked Tom for the in
formation and Withdrew, re marking that
he was not buying to-day.


few minutes later Nosey had en- |
tered the Charity Hospital unseen, and
for q few moments looked around for
Matt Hogan among the ordinary NOR
tails. Matt nau, however, Deen Iemoveu
to a ""pay"" ward, where he now lies I
with excellent prospects Of recovering, /
for the period within which peritonitis
may still be expected to declare itself
has nearly. If not entirely, passed. With
apparent nonchalance he scorns the |
charge OF being an accessory to the /
murder of the unfortunate Laresche,
and yet when the indictment OF the |
Grand Jury was communicated TO nm
Matt did not take it with his habitual
GOODNESS. He acknowledges that he has
sometimes INDUCED in ""nefarious
transactions, but he does not wish to be
classed with murderers.


No policeman is now in attepdance
upon him, for, it is said, that he has sig
nified to the authorities that II watch
man was placed over him he would
Jump"" otherwise he would remain.
The inference is that Hogan has i'm.
pressed the authorities with the belief"

IN-wHY GEN. ANDERSON REMAINS IN THE


BOARD.


NKw-ORLEANs, Nov. 23.-The board met at 11;30
o'clock this morning. Present for the Democrats,
Messrs Palmer, Bger Trumbull, Julian and G. b.
Smith; for the Republicans, Messrs. Stoughton,
Stevenson, Parker, Clarke, and Farweu. Judge
Spoford of counsel for the Democratic candidates
submitted the following:


The undersigned Of counsel for candidates on the
ticket, respectfully represent
that they informed and believe that the Supervisors
Of Registration for fourteen parishes had not filed their
returns here at tme the board adjourned Yesterday
that many these arc and have been for some
time, in the City Of New-Orleans, in the hands OF
Republican supervisors or of Republican candidate
for Congress- that proof Of this fact appears in the at
davts filed relative to the parishes of Ouachita Laiay
ete East Baton Rouge Red River Franklin, and others
that it appears from the statements made by
Gen. T. c. Anderson before the board on Mon
day last that the returns for St. Landry
were lin New-orleans on that day, though reported
that the supervisors other persons holding said re-
be ordered TO bring the before this Board OF
Returning Officers forthwith.


Annexed proof shows that NJ. j. Grady, Supervisor
for Ouachta has had his returns here in this city for
a week past; that j. A. Veazey Supervisor for La
fayette had his returns here week ago; that f. A.
Clover Supervisor for East Baton Rouge, has been
here with his returns for 10 days past that A. w.
Caroughe, Supervisor of Red River, has been here
with his returns for seven days past that w. II.
Mckay, Supervisor of Franklin, forwarded his re-
turns the 10Th inst and is not in the city; and
that Geo. S. Smith, Republican candidate for Con-
gress in the WITH Congressional District, is in the
City of New-Orleans and brought with him from
It'll hoo, hfua
troll some of the returns from the Red River Parish
and in said IVth Districts and an annexed copy of a
circular letter to supervisors of registration from d.
j. NJ. A. Jewett, Secretary of the Republican Cam
paign Committee shows that they were instructed to
bring the Republican vote of their parishes up to
prescribed figure.


On motion of Gen. Anderson the president of the
board instructed the secretary to issue orders to all
the supervisors in the city to file their returns inn
mediatey request was made by the Democratic
counsel that they beinformed to the order in which
the contested parishes would be taken up, so that
they may have time TO summon witnesses from dis
tant parts of the State. President Wells said that
the rules governing the board could not be changed
that notice woud be given when contested parish
was to be considered but that there no order
established. 1t agreed that the parish of East
Baton Rouge should be the first contested parish
taken up.


During the meeting Gen. Anderson rose to qucs-
ton of privilege read an article from a newspaper,
and said:


wish the public know, and also the editor, who has
probably not read the under which this board is act
ing (Act o. Of November, 1922 that since that tne
when resigned my position member Of the Return
ing Board on account OF being candidate
for the Senate, the law has been changed
Now, for the information of the gentlemen
present and Others will state that the law under which


was acting in 1870 and 1872 s different from the law
under which acting at present. Act No. % Of No
vember 1872 does not state, the act OF 1870 stated
that no candidate will be eligible to sit in the Returning
Board under the OF 1870 The Attorney General Gov
John Lynch Gen. LOngstreet, and myself were members
Of the Returning Board did not act on the board which
returned Gov. Kellogg Gov. McEnery.


After the act OF 1872 signed by Gov. Warmoth 1t
was required that of the five persons elected by the Sen
ate a majority established quorum, and in
quorum existed owing TO death other causes, the
vacancies TO be filled by the residue OF the board OF
returning officers The Senate elected the following
officers: Gov. Wells, John Lynch, Gen. LOpgstree q
Casenave, aud Louis NJ. Kenner subsequently,
Mr. Lynch having resigned j. T. q. Anderson
was elected by the board Of
its members That is all the law says the subject,
and now 1 am acting under this law, and there is
nothing in this law said about being disqualified
on the ground Of his being candidate II there was
would be sitting at present this board. Further
MORE acknowledge my competitor was elected. but
however wish the public TO understand that am not
acting under the same law as did In 1870 when
testified that 1 ineligible under that law.


Col Zacharn read letter from Col. Bush Vice
President of the Democratic Conservative State
Central Committee, pressing upon the board the
necessity of appointing Dr. Kennedy the board if
the proceedings were TO be conducted in spirit of
fairness and justice. request for representation
among the clerks was also made. GovWells replied
that the clerical force had been completed and the
board would not make any alterations. but would
attempt TO fill the board.

How Representative Lynch Was


Defeated.",,"After Senator Stevenson asserted in the
Senate that the constituency Of Representative
Lynch had gone over to the Democracy In num-
bers SUFFICIENT to defeat him by nearly 5000 ma
jority, representative of the NATIONAL Re
PUBLICAN called on Mr.. Lynch and had the fol.
lowing conversation with him:


Reporter. Mr.. Lynch, 1t has been said in the
Senate to-day that the eolored people Of your
district deserted you in large numbers and
formed an alleiance with the Democracy. Is
such the case?


Mr.. Lynch. No. sir. My people never have
EOr do believe they ever win, desert me for the
purpose Of joining the pemosrsey ,..,


Reporter HOW was II possible Tor your hand
some majority Of 1000, in 1875, to be entirely OBJ
liberated and yonr opponent elected by nearly
$500 votes in the recent election?
f. Mr.. Lynch. will tell how that wonderful
change happened. 1t was the work of fraud and
the result Of bull-dozing doubly 6ull-dozed.
There has not been fair election in Mississippi
since 1874. Since that time the Democracy have
conceived and put in force their infamous shot
gun policy, which has completely and absolutely
nullihed the rights guaranteed to the colored peo-
the last election, Notwithstanding the fact that
some Of my people were intimidated, was hon.
estly and fairly elected; but when the canvassers
made their returns was deliberately and fraud
ulentIy counted out. My majority in 1875 was
over 1000. They now return my opponent as
ear-marks of outrageous fraud upon the face Of
II, and shall contest the election. shall do it
not only In Justice to my constituents and to my
self, but shall contest 1t SO that the people of
the United states, who are more welded to honor
and honesty than they are TO party, can see hoU
franchise privileges under the shotgun rule in
Migslssippi,"

TWO ASSISTANTS THIS EVENING.


This evening between 9 and 10 o.
clock, an election will be held ut the
different engine houses OF the city, for
Chief Engineer of the Fire DEPART
ment and two Assistants. The candi-
dates are as follows:


For Chief Engineer-A. d. Vande-
yer, of the Fame; James Burke, of the
Weccacoe, VIM. Hanna, of the Wash
ingten; Geo. A. Messick, of the Re-
lance; VIM. Maxwell and James w.
Agnew, of the Delaware.


For First Assistant-Charles
of the Water Witch.


For Second Assistant--Samuel X .
Baylis, of the Friendship.


AS the voters of five companies are
necessary to elect, it is not probable
that there will be an election of Chief
Engineer by the Department, in which
case the election will devolve upon
City Council at the next meeting
There will be little or no opposition to
the candidates for Assistants.


The Judges and Inspectors of elect
ion appointed by the different compa-
nies are as follows:


Friendship-Jadge, Joseph Perkins
Inspectors, Thomas Lynch, Frederick
w. Larison.


Delaware.--Judge, Edward II amilton
Inspectors, John Dolan, James Sean

denbraak.


Weccacoc-Judge, Chas. II. Lukens,

Miller.


The Reliance and Water Witch will
appoint election officers this evening,
previous to the election.
This morning there was no apparen
indications that any of the candidate.
for Chief Engineer would withdraw
although rumors to this effect were
current during the week, Only {
withdrawal of one or more candidates
will prevent the election from falling
| upon the City Council.
John L. Lee, of the Water Witch
was brought out this morning as {
candidate for First Assistant, and it is
expected that other candidates for As
sistant and Engineers will be brought
out this evening. 1t is thought, how
ever, that the Department will elec
the Assistants by decisive vote,"

",,"In the case Of Heintzvs. Lynch, hon.
est John Lynch, in the Sixth District
Court, the people have had an oppor-
tunity to speak through jury concern
ing Metropolitan interference with the
rights of citizens.


The facts in the case, as shown by the
petitioners evidence, etc, are as fol-
lows


Lynch owned some property In Hurst
Vile, in the upper part of town, which
he leased to one Chas. Heintz. Together
with his family he went and lodged with
Heintz for several months and, as the
latter complained, neglected to pay his
board and lodging. Result, q suit for
1913 against Lynch. Lynch, in revenge,
called in those State troops, the Metro
politans, and dispossessed and effectu-
ally routed Heintz.


Apparently Heintz did not like the In
reference OF the MetrOpolitans, re-
belled and brought suit for damages,
saying that his premises had been spoli-
ated, his crops destroyed and disposed
of, and his goods generally injured and
destroyed. A jury, after hearing the
evidence returned a verdict against
Lynch for $500, thus showing the value
OF Metropolitan interference."

show what a great scarecrow the
wharves have been to the uninitiated,
and prove that the thieves required
nearly $4,000 to build wharf which
can be built for SLIGO, and under Mr..
Burke's proposition would cost $3.50.


The Injunction asked for by Mr..
Michael Carvin comes up on Monday
before the Superior Court, and in the
face of the decision OF the Supreme
Court, it cannot be conceived how Judge
Lynch can order any interference with
the city's right and duty to comply with
the decree which orders that no wharf
duties shall be levied upon vessels land
ing at this port In excess of the amount
necessary to keep the wharves In repair
for the accommodation Of the shipping

 York, except by the train which leaves at near p. m., and reaches the city after 9 p. m. Before the Conn. Western road was built, and while it's projectors were trying to persuade the town to subscribe to the work, we fancy they promised better things than this. Such however, is now the fact. A new and cheaper route to New York and the Centennial is now however, given by the Rhinebeck road. By taking the train going west at 1.19 p. m., you can connect at Rhinebeck, or at Rondout oppo- site, with the safe and spacious boats | Thomas Cornell or James w. Baldwin, These are as good boats as any on the rlv CT, and give good fare and clean berths. As late for any business, except taking a nights lodging at hotel; nothing really is lost in time. The fare is considerably less by the Rhinebeck and steamboat route, and you save on the nights lodging. It is less fatiguing by far, and one escapes the tedl- ous weariness of the disagreeable Harlem railroad.

 Musical Concert in Lakevile le-About two weeks earlier than the Winsted music al concert, Miss Ada Pettee, who has had under her instruction in vocal music in Lakeville, a class of thirteen pupils for the past few months, has arranged to give to the people of this region musical treat, such as they have not enjoyed before for a very long time, if indeed ever. On Thurs day evening of next week, at Academy l Hall in Lakeville, she and her pupils will give musical soilee, the programme for which promises very great deal, but which we have no doubt whatever will be fully sustained. Miss Pettee has deservedly obtained reputation for skill, tact and ability In lmparting instruction to her pu- pills, possessed by very few, and being as sisted by Prof. Stillman of Lakevllle and by MT. George B. Seeley of Ct. Burlington as amateur viclinist, she will present an en- tertainment that should be, ,and we presume will be-, very largely attended. The con- cert will begin about s-4 o'clock in the evening and the doors will be open for ad- mission at z. The price of admission, even for reserved seats, will not be large, and we hope all will go.

 Rape.-MondaY afternoon, while Mrs Walter Brasie was coming from her home on Sugar Hill, and while passing through the woods near what is known as InGlar cave, she was met by Frank Bailey, who was recently released from Litchfeld jai on the petition of prominent citizens o Salisbury (Reader; dld you sign that peti- tisn [? and who suggested to her that sh' must be tired, and told her she had bette

 sit down and rest. Mrs. Brasie, becoming alarmed at him replied that she was no

 though Mrs. Brasie struggled desperately

 and fought the fiend terribly, almos

 scratching his eyes out, he succeeded in ac : complaining his purpose. Officers are afte 5 the scamp, but at last accounts he had no , been arrested.

They drove Halls horse all the way and tele- graphed him to that effect whereupon he become enraged, and ordered the arrest of Ash for horse stealing, Ash was arrested together with Lynch. James w.

which has existed IN perfection and unbroken down To
Ihe present age preserving al us salient features un
Church. established mere school OF philosophy,
whose theories might be received by and rejected
by another but, on tho contrary, perfect society
with perfect system; society of precept and COM
mandment which should stand forever and extend to
all nations Against that Church the gates hell
not prevail She endured persecution and caumny
and has been preserved unharmed Whosoever
hcarkens unto the teachings OF the Church hcarkens
unto Christ; he who despiscs the Church despses

essential features OF the Church form complete or

Virginia meets in the city Of Lynchburg
to morrow, for the purpose of electing

it is difficult TO determine who of the sew
eral prominent gentlemen mentioned in
connection with the Presidency will be ia
vored by the Republicans of the Old Do
minion. If we may judge by the individual
predictions of many of the delegates elect,
there will be so great contrariety of opin-
ion as to preclude the possibility Of agree
ing upon any particular fayorite; yet we
are fully persuaded that the deliberations of
the convention will be governed by the
broadest and most comprehensive views,
and that individual preferences will be sunk
in view of the necessity for presenting q
united front against the common enemy.
In no State, perhaps, hsye Republicans
greater reason to dread the accession of the

those Of Virginia. They have but to
lock within their own borders to wit
ness, on every hand, the terrible ruin in
flicted upon their Commonwealth under
the rule of the misnamed Democracy. A
mountain load of debt, the free school
system virtually abandoned, immigration
estepped and a prevalent ostracism should

most advisable to be adopted BY the con-

Actuated by this idea, their session can
not fail to be for the best interests Of the

perfect equality before the law, the educa-
ton of the masses by the State and the pre-
lection of the ballot in the hands of all
citizens, regardless of race, color or pre-

the downfall Of the Republican party.
But with firm adherence to these clrdi-

ward, four. five and ak namee
being frequently scratched. As the
two tickets kept very nearly even during
the race, It was thought that with these
Hcratchings the result would be u mixed
4 get of delegates, with probably the
O'Brien men ahead say six or seven,
to four or three of the citizens or

The two tickets are an follows.

or these, the first very probably got ""A

In the other polls there was but one

Ca determine who will win the day.
Tenth ward.


The contest in the Tenth Ward was
quite excited, the polling place corner
Of Josephine and st. Charles streets
being crowded all the morning.
There were three tickets In the field !:
The Conference ticket, which was sup
posed TO contain the names Of gentle

At 10 IN. the Conference ticket was
ahead. It was also voted almost straight,
whereas the others, Citizens ana
Peoples, we're considerably scratched


Eleventh ward.


Voting was quite brisk at the Eleventh
Ward, eortier of Magazine and Sixth
streets, and by noon half the votes were
polled.


There were two tickets in the field.

Between the first two tickets there
was considerable rivalry. aud up to 10
m. Ii was quite uncertain which would
win. both sides having kept pretty even,
with a COOK deal OF scratching going on


Twelfth ward.


In the Twelfth Ward there were five
delegates to be elected. with thirteen
candidates to chose from, all printed on
the same ticket, the voter to erase nine
and leave the other names. This
amounted, In fact, to a scratched ticket.
and left the question Of delegates
greatly in doubt.

The names Of Messrs. Aycock, Weber,

posed to be ahead. but the matter was
extremely uncertain


Thirteenth Ward.
Poll corner Of Magazine and Valence
streets. There were only two tickets i'm
the Thirteenth Ward. Mr.. Jacob Van
Hoven's name figured on both of these,
thus probably ensuring his election.
The remainder of the tickets were as
follows: Peoples ticket-E. r. Cheval-
ley tand J. J. Gidiere. Democratic and
Conservative ticket-E. f. Virgin and
w. +. Clarke. At ~ m. to-day there |

Scenes and Incidents at the


Ruins Yesterday.

LOSSES AND ASSURANCES.

Preliminary Action of the Emigra-


ton Commissioners.",,"who ed Attracted hther by the graphic details OF II
rs given in the HERALD Of yesterday. Among them
were many well known insurance men, who dstrib-
uted themselves about the ruins and specuated upon
the damage done and the probable cause OF the fire.
Castle Garden yesterday certainly presented very
woc.bcgonc appearance, and all was confusion and
chaos for the Grst few hours of the morning Two or
lhrec Commissioners carly arrived upon the grounds
md with the aid of supcrintcn Jackson and Super
ntenden Coonan OF the Labor bureau. within few
minutes order restored and by the time that three
vessels discharged their cargocs of living
freight the vast business OF tho commission
running as smoothly s usual Nothing remained
standing except tho base walls of the old lor that has
experienced so many changes. Nearly every foot of
wood including tho circular galleries, had been eaten
up by the flames, that for once had enjoyed full meal
On the door OF tho rolunda promiscuous
of charcoal pieces OF from the roof twisted
by the excessive hoat into all of shapes, half
consumed beams charred josts and other cral in
tcrspcrscd with bricks and stones here and there In
side the brick columns that supported the galleries
stood as silent monuments OF what a few hours before
was the scene OF hustle and busy life. Tho only por-
ton OF the gallery that had escaped that on the
west under the point where tho fire originated. rho
wooden shed the outer line Of tho walls, under
which is the landing wharf escaped destruction as
we'll did the three pavons facing the Battery Park
rhc used by tho Commissioners and their
executive officers badly scorched,
md the sido fronting the rotunda
intirey gutted. Tho flames did not respect
,hc costly and cozy of tho commission. There
hc fine furniture, the richly upholstered chairs the
Iidcboard and desks, wcrc partially dcvourcd Even
The clock crsped and at thirty nvo minutes past
seven the hands became silent and STILL But not until
the glass had been melted by the consuming heat and
the face twisted into unsccmly shapes





Luckily the number OF who arriv
was small or the commission would have been seriously
taxed to provide. for them The steamship SPAN landed
about half past ten ISL passengers of whom 49,
Siccrago passengers, principally English and Irish
Later the City OF Chester landed 44o OF whom Sol
Nennones, from Russia, on their way Wisconsin.
About one O'Clock the steamship Idaho landed seventy
five cabin passengers and 731 steeragc passengers,
nearly all the latter were Mormons route for Dako-
Ia. The Commissioners Notwithstanding the cop-
iusion collected these cmgran,s in tho labor bureau
and supplied all with tho usual meals The
Ncrmons were, in the afternoon despatched to the
west by the Pennsylvania Railroad, and tho Mennontcs
left the Eric Railway for their now homo. BY
lhrcc o'clock the pavilions nearly empty, and
business proceeded as usual superintendent Coonan
speaks in the highest terms OF tho cooncss under the
excitement OF about $50 Mcnnonitcs who had arrivoi
IN the Celtic and oaer Sunday and in the
Garden awaiting tho arrival Of their associates by the
City OF Chester.





At this stage Of tho investigation It is impossible to
form anything Ike estimate of the losses
sustained by the catastrophe two experts
agreeing upon estimate The most intelligent esti-
mates place the loss building between $50 coo and
f45, 600 The former probably low and the lat
ter too high The portion destroyed merely the
gallery surrounding the rotunda tho little Insignificant
buildings the ground floor OF the rotunda and tho
roof. The gallery was OF wood of the most common
place style Of architecture while all the buildings
the Gocr not worth more than 81, 900. The
Offices OF the Commissioners and their attaches,
on tho second floor, adjoining the pavilion,
werc damaged probably TO the extent Or
$1,000 while 81 coo will cover all tho damage to
furniture. II is believed that the building be pu,
tho condition 1t previous to the fire by the
jucicious expenditure OF less tnan $50 900, tho
structure is insured for s2o0Oo in responsible CON-
papics The loss TO the commission will, therefore,
not exceed $4,000 Indeed. il is not at all unlikely
that the insurance companies interested will rebuild
the Garden instead OF paying the losses Labor is at
the present time cheap, while material is lower than
II has been Tor years and the companies may lind II
advantageous to them to rebuild H.


The loss baggage destroyed cannot be ascertaned
for months A large number OF pieces storage

were contained in these trunks and boxes only the
owners know Tho baggage is insured Tor $4,000,
which may may cover the loss. Ex-
ports connected with the Garden estimate
thai each trunk and It's contents is on an
average worth $50, and knowing the number

entire baggage oss The Commissioners anticipate

How Raphael Williams Met His

him, before the arrival of the authorities,
who with considerable difficulty got him
out of their clutches and conveyed him to
the Jail at Platte City, Friday night. The
real name OF the prisoner was Rahpael Viii
liams, and he was not generally, so far as xe
have been able to ascertain, considered a
bad character.


He was, as stated, taken to the Jail and
confined in cell by himself, and although
there was some talk OF taking him out by
force and hanging him Saturday night, the
sheriff, DIR. f. Med. Cofiey, felt no appre-
heBsion of violence, yet he, together with
his deputy, Mr.. VIM. Moran, kept stric,
guard for fear OF an accident"" Things
vent Oh all quiet enough until Sunds sy
night, when IL began to be Whispered about
| that a


of men were gathering from the country
about Camden Point, the scene OF the out
rsge committed by Williams, for the pur-
pose of overpowering the sheriff, and TAX
ing the prisoner out and


HANGING HIM.


These stories were, of course, of startling
import, but as there is usually much OF thai
kind Of talk on such occasions, it was
thought possible that the people would
hardly go so far as to take justice into their
own hands, and violently snatch the priso-
ner from the hands of the Law, in order to
send him to his last account before being
tried by the courts; but in this the officers
were


| MISTAKEN!


Between the hours of l and 2 o'clock.
in the morning, large body of men, num-
bering, it is thought, about one hundred
and twenty-fve-all masked-rode into
Platte City, from the country, on fine horses
and accompanied by a wagon, loaded with
heavy tools, such as sledge-hammers, picks
crow-bars and axes, to be used in the


DEMOLITION OF THE JAIL,


in case their demands were not scceded to.
The party was arr anged with the wagon in
the center and an advance and rear gnard,
the first of which cautioned people who
happened to be up to remain carefully in
doors, and see nothing, and the second to
see that their ""hints"" we're complied with.
One man, a barber, named Stivers, let his
curiosity get the better of his discretion,
and followed the parry short distance to-
ward the Jail, when one of the rear guard
suddenly wheeled on him and forced him
at the muzzle of


| NAVY REVOLVER


to beat hasty retreat, in the direction oi
his home. Tue cavalcade then proceeded to
the Jail, and in a manner that showed the
whole affair to have been well planned one
who spoke in a


| COMMANDING VOICE,


ordered the command to halt. The sheriff
was then called out, and a formal demand
was made for the possession OF the prisoner
This, DIR. Codey refused, saying he had nc
authority TO turn the prisOLer over. TIE
chief of the gang Immediately gave an or.
der, and some began TO unload the wagon
OF its contents which seemed to have been
taken from the section house of the rail
road. They began then to hammer at the
doors OF the Jail, in a way that together
with the threat that the structure would b<
demolished, caused the sheriff to endeavol
to Use force to stop their progress, when hs
and his deputy were seized, and overpower
ed and the keys taken from them. The
prisoner was soon found, and after being
bound and gagged, was thrown
inc the wagon, into which the
tools were returned, and the
whole party moved away in the direction
Of place called Tracy, about three-quar-
ters of mile from the Jail. Arriving in
| the vicinity Of large tree, the cavalcadr
halted, and the poor, quivering victim OF
their vengeance was given to understand
| that his


| LAST HOUR WAS COME.
The gags were removed from his mouth
and amid his loud and unheeded cries fol
mercy, the fatal moose was placed about his
neck and the wagon in which he WAS kept
was driven beneath the branches the tree;
one end of the rope was swung over a limb
and made last, lesvi, z the criminal stand
ing on his tip toes, in which position he
stood, while he was informed why the
SENTENCE OF DsArH


had been thus passed on him. One of the
party recounted in a thrilling voice the
horrors of the deed he had committed. AT
signal, the wagon was driven rapidly
from beneath the feet OF the victim and in
a second longer he was swinging in the air.
A few short struggles, and all that was left,
was the mo'ionlesa torn. sway ing to and
fro between the earth and sky. The grim
crowd OF execu,ioners, after waiting silently
and statue-iike on their horses, until the
last spark o. life had me, departed in the
gloom of the surrounding forest, satirfed,
doubtless, that they had done righteous
act.


THE BODY


was left until in the morning, about Z
o'clock, when q party, consisting of about
dozen white men and one coIored
man, visited the scene OF the horror
and cut the remains down and prepared
them for interment, the coroner having,
with jury, viewed the body, and returned
a verdict OF death by hanging, in accord
ance with the above facts. Attached to the
body was found the following note written
in bold clear hand


Platte CITY, No., July 81, 1875


Know all men by there presents, that,
whereas, one Raphael Williams did com
nit rape upon the person of Mrs.
a white woman, in the neighborhood Of
Buens Vista, Platte county, Missouri, July
9th, 1876, and that We regard this CRIME
the chief # crimes, and the Law deficient
in its punishment for like crime we deem
it necessary TO take the Law into our own
hands, hoping that when our General As
semblJ meets this winter they will increase
the penalty for this crime to capital pun
ishment. Take heed, that henceforth all
persons, black or white, regardless of color,
guilty of like crime will suffer in like man
ner.


We hope it will be the laat time that We
will be called upon to record such . crime
We are Of those sho wore the blue and the
gray, and those who remained at home as
private. .citizens, but have united to protect
our families against such treatment a one
OF our citizens received on July q, 1876.


The greatest excitement prevails over
the commission of the deed. Some think
the party Of lynchen was composed of citi-
zens OF Platte City, aided BY . few from
Camden Point, but - yet no one of them
has been recognized, nor is it likely that
they ever will be, although the grand jury
will take the matter in hand and endeavor
to discover their names.


The woman, Mn. Davis, Who was out |
ragged, is reported to have been lady high |
ly respected in the neighborhood where she |
lives, and the commission of the crime |
aso1sed the whole district in proximity |
thereto. She is said 10 be nov living in q |
critical condition and not likely to recover. |

hat the woman was dead.

and refused to admit the amendment pro
posed by Mr.. Mills to repeal the rssump-

seconded, So to as, aud the house then x6:ed
by yeas And nays, on ordering the main
question, which was ordered, and the bill
passed without divisipni also reported Mr..
Randalps bill, authorizing the purchase of
bullion FOR that purpose, which was passed.
A bill providing that when Colarado is adj
mtted as a state the laws IT the United

where, and that that state shall constitute
one judicial district, was passed. On mo-

house then took up the Geneva award bill,

cial appropriation bill were non concurred
in. The special committe on Louisiana af-

West Felicisns, and the house soon after
wards adjourned.


In the house on The 18th, the join
resolution to modify the treaty with China
so as to restrict immigration was passed.
Bills introduced and referred-By Mr.. Lord:
Joint resolution recommending an addition
al amendment to the constitution, providing
that officers Of the Uaited states, such as as
SCISSORS, postmasters, marshals and collectors
except collectors OF custom duties, shall be
elected for a term of four years. BY Mr..
Raymond: Providing for the gradual re-
sumption of specie payment, and for the re-
peal of so much OF the resumption act rs
fixes the date for resumption on January !,
1879. Mr.. Clymer from the committee on
expenditures in the war department made n
report in the case Of the charges against
Speaker Kerr. The report states that after
full inquiry into the facts, and after a thor
ough examination of Lawrence Harvey, the
only witness making tho charge, and also of
Aug. p Green and divers other witnesses, it
appears that in 1866, while member of the
house Of representatives Of the thirty.ninth
congress, Mr.. Kerr did, in the exercise OF his
right or privilege, nominate Green for an ap-
pointment in the regular army. The COM
mittee, however, found no difficulty it
reaching conclusion that the charge as on
the payment of money to Mr.. Kerr was un-
qualifedlv false, and that Mr.. Kerr stood
fully exonerated from all complication Of
fecting his personal honor or official integri-
ty. The committee has found nothing in Its
whole progress OF investigation to impair or
detract from the well established reputation
for unquestioned personal integrity and un-
sullied purity. Mr.. Clymer remarked that
the conclusion was the unanimous Judgment
not only of the committee, but of the house
and country. Mr.. Garfield suggested that
vote be taken on the report by the members
rising. The suggestion was adopted, and
all the members, 2l0 in number, rose in the
affirmative; none in the negative. The
speaker pro ten. laid before the house let
ter for Thurlow Weed suggesting that Oscar
Lafayette, grand son of Gen. Lafayette, be
invited to visit the centennial as the guest
of the nation. Referred to committee on
centennial. Adjourned.


In the house on the 18th, Mr.. Roberts
introduced bill to reduce taxation on the
circulation of state banks to an amount
equal to that paid by national banks. Re-
ferred. Mr.. Ferry from the committee on
military affairs reported back the senate bill
in reference to the detail of army officers as
professors at the state military academies,
AMI extending the limit from twenty to
thirty. After discussion, passed yeas, 1872 I;
nays, 80. On motion of Mr.. Atkins it was
ordered that no business should be trans.
acted to-day and tomorrow, except general
debate ON the army appropriation bill. The
house then went into the committee Of the
whole, Mr.. Blackburn in the chair, on the
army appropriation bill, and was addressed
by Mr.. Wood IN. "" Mr.. Lynch addressed
the committee on the political status OF the

RICHMOND, Va July l, 1876.
telegram from Charleston, W. Va, states that
Allen the horse thief and murderer Of Mr. Mitchell the
stable keeper taken from the Jail OF wingfcld,
Putnam county, and hanged by mob at nine O'Clock
this morning.


A large number of amounted men were seen last night
to pass through Barboursvile. They arrived at Wing
field the county seat OF Putnam county, about seven
O'Clock this morning. The Jail was at once surrounded
by the party the keys demanded by them from
the jailer the peril of his lie, and the doors
opened The mob then proceeded to the cell in winch
Alien confined and took him out. He was carried
by the mob about three miles from Barboursvile,
formula Of trial the murderer was strung up and
hanged.


He made a statement, the details OF which are not
yet to hard but he gave his real johnson.


THIS is the third time, recently, in which murdcrers
have been summarly dealt with in West Virginia
The laws delay had occasoncd and effected the escape
many criminals that it Is not considered safe to
allow nurdcrers the chance OF tedious and
tain process Of trial by the courts. II was notable
ut BarDoursville that there were large numbers of
mounted ''cavorting'' around with bands of
music ii they making preliminary preparations
10 celebrate the Centennial Fourth.


Coroner's jury held and verdict was rendered
that deceased 'came his death by visitation of
unknown parties to white oak tree"" This is the
singular verdict that came here tonight, but IL is
believed that the frequency OF such prompt punishment
will certainly put stop to murders in that State"

BosroN, Sept q, 1870


There is a reign OF terror account of the tramp
country, in cities and large towns, as well as in the
rural districts Their depredations and outrages arc
daily becoming bodor. Only last Sunday an noffen-
without tho slightest provocation, and when taken
into custody the only explanation offered by the vaga
bond that ho couldn't help it,"" and he was ""per-
fcctly willing the crowd should lynch him."" An
officer prevented this, however, and the wretch was
to-day committed for murder.


Another, the circumstances of which are moro hor-
rble even than the above, is reported from Meoway
small town few miles southeast from this city.
About twelve O'Clock yesterday tramp called at the
house OF Mr.. John Neyon, tho brush factory at
the boundary between Medway and Norfolk and
supposed he had departed his travels Hc
proved to be scoundrel, however. hc
decoyed lto daughter OF Mr. Ncylon.
eight years old, the woods attempted to out
ing the threats OF the ruial, and her cfies aroused
her father, who at oncc went TO her relief The tramp
became so cnragcd at his failure that he lifted Tho child
bodily and threw her into pond He then fed into
the depths OF the wood ana escaped.


Mr. Ncylon fouud the child In the pond, and, with
the assistance OF neighbors, rescued her In
hausted condition.


There great excitement In the town over the
affair."" and large crowd turned 10 scour the woods
for the cuprit The Indignation was intense, ana had
the tramp been caught yesterday he would have been
lyncbcd Tho woods wcro surrounded, but tho search
Tor the mlscreant proved unavaiiing up to late hour
last night II sxnown that he is stiil in the woods,
however and the search for him continues 1t Is not
improbable that the citizens will take the law into
their own hands II the criminal should be found."

heard one the other day, that that
party and its newspapers condemn the
massacre of negroes in the South and
especially the cowardly Hamburg
butchery. But it is false. We have
never seen a Democratic newspaper
that said a word against the ku-klux
manner of reducing the Republican
vote. Democratic newspapers, DEM
ocratic speakers and Democratic Con-
gressmen apologize for and excuse on
fiimsy and false grounds the murder
of negroes and ""carpetbaggers,"" and
some, as the Jackson, Miss, Clarion,
oppenly approve of such crimes and
oppression. That paper, one of the
most influential Democratic journals
in the State of Mississippi, speaking
of the Hamburg murders, said:


No impartial person can read the
reports of the affair 1CitftOut approving
The conduct Of the aUhiteS, and at the
same time sympathiZe with them in
the misfortune of having been forced
to such an extremity of action in self
defence.


The whites were the originators OF
the disturbance, and murdered those
unarmed, defenceless people in the
most cowardly and cold blooded man.
ner, as an act of intimidation.


A Virginia Democratic paper, the
Lynchburg Sfar understood the de-
sign well when it said:


The South Carolina negros are get
ting their backs up. They had better
remember the fate of their brethren in
Mississippi. IAN ounce OF prevention
is worth a pound of cure""


A majority of the Democratic party
to-day cherish and practice the doc
trine that intimidation, force and
fraud are legitimate means to carry an
election. This is believed in from
Tilden the ballot-box stuffer down to
the masked ku-klux night rider that
murders Republicans white and black
for opinions sake."

Jiige Wales Opinion--The ChildreIa
Continued In the Care OF Their


Grandfather.",,"In the Law Library, yesterday after
noon, Judge Wales gave his opinion
in the case of VIM. Lynch, who had
applied for writ of mandamus, com
pelling the restoration to him of his
three children, who were cared for
and in the custody of their grandfath-
er, Mr.. James Bratton.


The opinion reviewed the case at
length-the Incorporate habits of
Lynch, the departure of his wife with
the children to the house of her father,
her divorce, death, and the relator's
second marriage, and his demand for
the custody OF his children. The
opinion stated that Lynch's eldest
child-a girl of seyenteen-having
arrived at the age of discretion, could
decide for herself-but that the GUS
tody of the other children-aged nine
and six years-must be decided by
legal opinion. The opinion further
held that the children at present were
well provided for, and that the mental
reformation of the relator was OF too
short duration TO indicate as to its
lasting character. The children,
therefore, were continued in the Gus
tody Of their grandfather Mr.. Bratton,"

have been elected except the three from
New Hampshire, and they will undoubt-
edly be Republican, as in the late election
the Republicans carried every district, and
will do so again in the spring. 1t is now
pretty conclusively settled that of the
members who will receive certificates each
party will have AS, leaving New Hsmp-
shire to determine the fact whether the
next House shall be Democratic or Repub-
lican, and in accord with the adminIstra-
ton. Should the Republicans succeed in
securing the organization of the House so
that an honest Committee on Elections
could be had, several Democrats whose
seats have been obtained by fraud and
force will probably be ousted, and the
rightfully- elected Republicans put in their
places. Among these is that Democratic
bypocritical ballot-box purifier q John
Goode, jr., of Virginia, who will receive
the certificate from that other exemplifics-
tion Of the beauty of the purity of elections,
Governor Kemper, of Virginia. He will
have to give place to the Hon. Joseph
Segar, who was rightfully elected. and
proposes to contest for his place, and see
that the will of the majority who
elected him is carried out. General
Banning, of Cincinnati, is another who
will have to give way to Hon. Stanley
Matthews, the ell ected member from that
district. Mr.. Rapier, from Alabama, will
also obtain the seat to which he was elected;
while one of the Democrats from Mary
land, who was elected, according to one of
the Democratic Sunday papers, by votes
sent from the District of Columbia, will
have his right to seat sifted and deter
mined. Hon. John R. Lynch, of Missis-
sippi, will also take the place of Chalmers,
of Fort Pillow notoriety, and there are
several other cases that it is not now neces
sary to enumerate. Enough Republicans
have been elected to secure q good working
majority in the House, and all who have
been elected should at once prepare to con-
test. This practice of stealing into Con-
gress by fraud and intimidation must be

city purposes as cents on the $l0o) could
raise sufficient money. The amount
raised at this rate, would only reach
about $206,0Co, and the appropriations
amount to $253,000. About $l4S,0OO OF
this year 8 taxes have already been spent,
which would leave only $99, 600 to meet
current expresses. The floating debt
amounts to about SIG. 600, and no allow
ance has been made tor the discount on
taxes paid during July. and for the taxes
which cannot be collected. AT this rate
there will soon exist q AoAtiDg debt OF
s3O,C lo, or s40, 1000, which will have to- DE
funded. He was opposed to any further
funding of the floating debt. iaH ~


Mr.. Pyle replied that the differences
between the revenue to be raised BY
taxation, and the appropriations, would
be 5eovafed by the Waterg Department

Mr.. WIN. NJ! canhy ,::moyed, to amend
the report by making the city tax rate

Mr.. Febiger seconded the amendment:


Mr.. McMenamin said the idea OF the
Finance Committee was to lay tai

Of the city, and he Thought the tax raised


would be sufficient for this purpose, al
he was certain none of the committed

""Like to hear about it? Well, il


isn't much of story but maybe |


would amuse you.


""You see was on a jury up in Tu.


olumne county some time in the Sum


mer of 80 or '5l. We had no grea


show of law in those days, but wher


there was something of the kind to set.


tie, we summoned up an amateur cour


as it were, and Judge Lynch presided


You have heard of the Judge? He die


IA good deal of service at that time anC


many's the man / have seen OF


his sentence say prayer or two anG


Jump into eternity from the end of 6


hemp rope. 1t was short shrift with


most of the fellows that Judge Lynch


had business with.


""Well, 1 was telling you that 1 sat


on jury. 1t was to try Dutchman


named Blum for stealing something
over hundred ounces of dust from a
couple of miners Blum was cooking
| for the miners and he was kind of


half-witted fellow that nobody had
ever thought any harm of before. The
| boys planted the dust in the cabin for
safe keeping and one day it was dis
| covered that Blum had stole it-at
| least, nobody saw him take it, but the
case was figured down tolerably close
and most of us reckoned that Blum
would not get out of it without crick
in his neck.


""There was a fellow in camp that we
| called pike He was from Missouri.
l. Il 10 Inl h1t
wasn't; it was Lucas or some such
thing and he had run away from
wife and three or four red-headed chill
dren in the States.


""Well, Pike was foremost in accus-
ing the Dutchman and he swore that
Blum had come into his saloon and
asked him to drink and had paid for
the liquor and an old score be-
sides with some dust which might be
half an ounce, or little more. He
saw Blum take the dust out of a sack
that was too big for Dutch cook to
have. Besides this, Pike had seen a
light in the cabin one night late and
had noticed that Blum came out and
sneaked up a gulch behind the drift.
What he did up there Pike didn't
know.


""But in spite of all this proof chat
was dead against him, the Dutchman
held up his hand before God and swOre
that he did not know thing about
the business; that be never stole any
dust, and never settled any score at
Pixies saloon which more than half
believed, especially about the score.
1 couldn't help thinking that Pike
was almost too handy in giving evil
dence. | had an idea, too, that man
who would run away from wife and
a house full of babies in the States
wasn't any too good to lie about
little thing like this.


""When, we, the jury, went out to
calculate on the law and evideace,
told them what l thought about
it and I was not alone in my opinion.
Two or three others had made up their
minds Just as l had that the Dutch
man was innocent, and couple more
who hadn't really decided the question
with themselves came around when
we put it to them in our way. But
some of the jurymen wouldn't listen
to me at all when we argued 1t over.
They were just morally convinced that
the Dutchman stole the dust and they
were just morally bound to find him
guilty. So when we took vote on
the question it was a tie-six for the
Dutchman and six against him.


1--WE talked and argued on the point
till we were all about worn out,
but neither six would give in. 1t
was not the most comfortable place
YOU ever saw either,-that jury room.
It was sort of attic with a low CELL
ing, or no ceiling at all, for the roof
was close over our heads, and the sun
broiled through mighty close and hot |
tell YOU, and the worst of it was that
the Court wouldn't allow us anything
to keep our courage up and fight it
out.


1--WE tried to persuade our Sheriff
(you see we did things up in regular
form, if it was Judge Lynch's Cour:)
that we needed little som. talng to
help us on, but it was no so. Then
we lowered a bottle out of the window
with a string, but the unfeeling GUS
ses on the outside wouldn't Go any
thing for us either. Our Judge got an
idea of our doings and sent word by
the Sheriff that if we didn't get to
business and make out a verdict he'd
keep us locked up till every mothers
son was starved to death.


""When we had been out about six
hours, and no prospect of agreeing,
with every throat in the crowd
parched dry, and altogether the most
unhappy Jury in California, ore of
the Jurors of the opposite faction pro-
posed compromise. 1t was that
four of us-two from each party
should play game of Euchre to settle
the verdict. Itwas to be best three I'D
five, and the winners should make 1t
guilty or not guilty as they pleased,
and all the rest must agree to 1t. 1t
was somewhat irregular way of set
Ting point of law and evidence, per-
haps, but we were mighty desperate,
and so we agreed to it. A big stout
fellow by the name of 'Frenchy' and
myself were chosen to play for our
side. as we were considered about the
best of the lot in the game. We
played against couple of as good
hands at cards as were to be found in
in the camp, but were dead sure our
selves that we would win forall that.


.Iwon't be tedious in telling how
the game was played, but at the end

Mr.. Farrell called up his Ordinance
fixing the wages of the laborers in thu
! city departments at $3.50 per day, t
which he offered an amendment 6xin,
the pay of foreman of laborers at g.. o,
per day. Adopted.


Mr. VIM. Candy offered a furthe
, , amendment striking out 81 so per d a,
for laborers, and inserting 81 80 pc
day.


Mr.. Lynch opposed the amendmen
. in an elaborate argument. in which h,
portrayed the miseries of the poo
laborers, and the insufficiency of thei
present rates Of wages. He oppose,
any reduction from the sum fixed il
the ordinance, $1.50 per day.


Mr.. VIM. M. Candy supported hi
amendment, believing that $1.35 pc
day was the average rate of laborers
wages.


Mr.. Febiger thought the friends o
the ordinance were forgetting tn
? noble taxpayer"" and spending othe
peoples money more freely than the
would spend their own. He though
the ordinance was q reflection en- tn
committee, who heretofore, have la.
the power to regulate the wages O
laborers.


The amendment was then lost by
ayes and II nays-Messrs. VIM. M
Candy and Jones voting in the affir
native.


Mr.. Hayes,..in his remarks, state
that during the year not more tina
150 laborers could be employed at tn
reservoir. BY paying these men 81 8


per day it is grinding meney out of tn


pockets OF 1400 or more other ta
)paying laborers, who can get but 8


and 81 25 per day.


Mr.. Farrell supported the erdinanc


and argued that the reduction of wage
' by the city, was taken by other EN-
ployers as reason for making simila


reductions.


Mr.. Hayes said his idea of aCounci


mans duty was to do for the city a


he would for himself. Numbers @


men were offering to work for 81 2
;c per day, and it was not right for tn
IL city to pay more than other employer
would pay. He said that in Septembe
. 1875, when the Democrats took charg


of Council, the floating debt of tn
n n city was $12 ,21S.54. Since then ther
n had been collected $159,605 ""a, all G

that the presence of United States troops
is not necessary for his arrest. He also
says that if a legal investigation is had,
and he does not show that the negroes
were the aggressors, and the riot insti-
gated by emmissaries of Chamberlain, he
will undertake to answer personally for
the death of every man, white and black,
who fell. 1t is difficult to see how Gov.
Chamberlain can avoid responding to
this challenge by prompt proceedings,
which he should have taken long ago,
instead of running to Washington for
federal troops. We have yet seen moth
ing that can be accepted as an excuse for
the barbarity of killing prisoners who
had surrendered themselves; but this is
no reason why the whole affair should
be misrepresented for political purposes.
The Hayes newspapers would have the
public believe that a aregularly organized
militia company were murderously at
tackled by democrats because they dared
to celebrate the fourth of July. The
fact is that the so-called militia company
was disorderly, armed mob, who had
seized arms belonging to the state, and
at the time of the disturbance had met
in armed resistance to minor court,
presided over by one of their own color,
and their own political faith. Further,
these outlaws have, for years, been
nuisance and terror to the community
which they infested, owing to the anar-
chy which prevails inSouth Carolina, and
the impossibilities of obtaining Justice in
the partisan courts of that state. Finally
they came in collision with white mob
which proved too strong for them, and
lynch law was administered to some of
the blacks, just as it has frequently been
administered to white offenders in
northern states with less provocation
Politics had nothing to do with the mat
ter, except that it is owing to the vii
lainous rule of carpet-baggers and igno-
rant negroes that condition of affairs
has been produced in South Carolina
which renders it impossible for white
citizen to secure legal protection from
violence and robbery. Gov. Chamber
lain had better stop writing partisan
letters and begin proper legal investi-
cation of this wretched business."

Alter considerable discuss on the bill was


rejected.


Ihe House then went into committee of


the whole on the consular and diplomatic


appropriation bill, and was addressed by


Mir Springer, of Illinois, in defense of the


economy features of the bill.


Mr Cox supported the bill and Mr.. Kel-


1y opposed 1t.


As to the FURTHER course of the debate, it


was understood that Mr.. Blaine would adj


dress the House tomorrow, and that the


general debate would close tomorrow.


The committee rose and the House ad-


iourIed.


WASHINGTON, d. C., February IO.-The
Speaker presented memorial from citi-
zeGis OF Louisiana, pray ing for relief against
certain political evils existing in that
State Referred.


The mOrning hour having been dispensed
with, the House went into committee OF the
whole on the consular and diplomatic APP
preparation bill, and was addressed by Mr.
Hale, of aine. He began by showing the
importance in view OF the past history of
the country OF maintaining its foreign mis-
sions, particularly the mission to England,
as it had been of invaluable service to
the country during the rebellion. He
alluded 10 the fact that no less than six
Presidents had experience in diplomatic
service, and it would not do in the light of
all the history of the past to cast slurs up
on diplomacy az thing not needed and as
a thing which should be given up.


Mr.. Hale was followed by Mr.. Lynch, of
Mississippi, and at the conclusion of his
speech Mr.. Blaine arose and addressed the
committee. Every seat in the House and
galleries was occupied, and the closest at
teBtiOn was given to his remarks.


Mr. Tarbox replied to Mr.. Blaine. He
said Mr.. Blaine had shown the spirit of
the advocate rather than the spirit OF the
savaDt in still defending criminals; the
speech was an attempted vindication of the
financial policy of the party which had
ruled the country without let or hindrance,
since the flower OF peace blossomed upon it,
and was an attempted Impeachment Of the
political action OF that party which, since
that time had no power at all in the conn
ellis OF the Nation.


Mr.. Randall, chairman OF the committee
on appropriations, defended the action oil the
committee in reporting this bill This CON-
mittee has in no degree Interfered with
any OF the commercial interests OF the
He concluded by defending the
action oil the committee in regard to the
China and South American consu lates.
The committee then proceeded to consider
the bill by sections, for amendment.


MIR. Chittenden moved to strike out the |
reducing appropriations for sal- |
aries Of Ministers to France, England Ger |
many and Russia. Rejected.


Mr.. Haze moved to amend the paragraph |
by increasing the salary of the Ministers
from l4,OJ0 to Sl7, 1900 After dis u-sion |
il WAS rejected, and the salaries of those
Ministers are lett at Sl4,90O.


No amendment was offered to the para
graph fixing the salaries of Ministers to
Spain, Austria, Brazil, Japan and China
at $4,000, and they remained thus fixed.


Mr.. kasson moved TO increase the salary
,f the Minister to Italy from $1,000 to
$4,000. Rejected, and mission to Italy
stands at $1,000.


Mr.. Banks moved to restore the mission
% Greece, and spoke in favor OF his mo-
ion, but 1t was rejected, and there is there
ore no provision in the bill for q mission
% Greece.


At this point of the bill, the committee
'ose. and the House adjourned.

The question OF the Louisiana Senatorship will prob
ably up before the Senate in shape in which 1t
may be decided at least that the State shall have two
Senator's For three years IL has had but one, Mr.
Pinchback having been all that time cooling his heels
In the waiting room Mr.. Eustis, who has just been
elected appears the choice made In strict accord
with the law of Legislature whose right to sit
neither party in Louisiana here disputes If the
Senate rejects Pinchback it must admit Eustis, II
would seem. Pinchback sent to the Senate by
Legislature constituted, as committee OF the United
States Senate reported, by fraud and violence The
conservatives claimed in 1872 to have carried the State
and to have eeceda majority Of the General Assem-
bly, To oppose their possession the republican side
four persons constituting what known IS the Lynch
Returning Board, improvised a set OF election
turns--not having single scrap Of an official return


from any precinct In the Stateshowing the election of
Kellogg and his ticket and large majority Of republican
members Of the General Assembly In the meantime
Kellogg went before Judge Dure and under cover of
order in chancery to perpetuate testimony in suit
which he swore that he intended to bring but which
he has never brought obtained q decision declaring
the Lynch Board to DO the legal board, and Antoine
colored candidate for Lieutenant Governor procured
from the judge injunction restraining all per-
sons not declared elected by the Lynch Board
nom acting members Of the Legislature In
order to make these proceedings effective Dure issued
his notorious midnight order"" directing the United
States Marshal TO seize the State House. and that on
ca supported by United States troops and furnished
with list Of the members who to constitute the
Kellogg Legislature did accordingly take possession OF
the State House and proceeded as instructed, TO en-
panel Legislature. The body thus constituted i'm
peached Governor warmoth and installed Pnchback
in his place. and at subsequent period elected that
49, fenC hv nd
ration OF Kellogg's term.


During that winter the Louisiana case brought
before the Senate and referred to the Committee
Privileges and Elections, OF which Mr. Morton
was the chairman and OF which Messrs
Logan, Anthony, Carpenter, Hill, Trumbull
and Alcorn the other members
The majority of that committee composed of Messrs.
Carpenter Anthony Logan and Alcorn their report
to the Senate refer the following terms to Judge
Durell's conduct in issuing the midnight order':-


1t is impossible conceive OF irregular. ile-
gal and in every way nexcusable act on the part OF
Judge Conccding the power OF the Court to make
such an order, the Judge out OF Court had no more
authority TO make II than had the Marshal II has not
the form of judicial process II was not sealed
nor II signed by the Clerk and bad no more legal
effect than an order issued by any private citizen.


And concerning the restraining directed against
the members of the General Assembly the report
says





injunction, issued for purpose under heaven
cept control the organization OF the Legislature and
compel the seating of those members who had been
returned and certifed by the Lynch Board and
clude those who had been certified by the De Feriet
Board When we consider that the act OF Congress
under which this proceeding was Instituted by express
words excludes members OF the State Legislature from
the right 10 maintain any proceedings in federal
court TO obtain their seats, even they have been
defeated and deprived of their rights because citizens
have denied the right TO vote account OF
color or previous condition OF servude and that the

herenbefore set FORTH which order commanded the Mar
shal prevent all unlawful assembage therein under
guise pretcxt OF authority claimed by virtue of
pretended and made by the sad DeFere
Board we comprehend the full force and effect OF
the additional restraining orders in the Antoine case


Referring to the Lynch Board, the report says


There is nothing all the comedy OF blunders and
frauds under consideration ndeensibe than the
pretended canvass OF this board


Mr Trumbul, OF the committee, in his report
said


The history Of the world does not furnish q
palpable instance Of usurpaton than that oy which
Pinchback made Governor and the persons

stalled In power by the aid OF the United States Army
in pursuance Of void order OF United States Dis
trct Judge. proceeded TO elect John Ray land after
ward Pnchback to represent the State Of Louisiana in
the Senate Of the United States.


Mr. Joshua Hill OF the committee refers as fol-
lows to Judge Durei's orders and the consequences
flowing from them


What boots II to rebuke the illegal and tyrannical
assumptions OF judge If his orders and decrecs
have all the effect he designed 10 give themf OF what
consequence Is that hs violations Of law should be
though be had not exceeded Jurisdiction and abused
the authority OF his oticei


And finally Senator Morton, no less emphatcaly
than his colleagues the committee, thus condemns
the conduct ofJudge Durell leaving 10 doub,
that in his mind tho pretended Legislature organized
Iff. hat,
existence


The conduct OF Judge Durcl, sitting in the Circuit
Court OF the United states justified or de.
Tended He grossly exceeded his Jurisdiction and as
sumed the exercise OF powers 10 which he could lay
claim But the pretence that In suit 70
perpetuate testimony the Court could 60 be-
decide who constituted the legal ,I'''u Return NJ
ing Board under the laws OF Louisiana, and
enforce the rights Of such might determine to
be members Of that board. and 10 enjon others who
were not is without any foundation In law or logic In
the Antoine case Judge Durell not only assumed 10
determine who constituted the legal Returning Board
but 70 prescribe who should be permitted take part
In the organlzaton OF the Legislature, and to enoin
all persons from taking part in such organization who
we're returned by the Lynch Board as elected
And this assumption OF jurisdiction made In the
face Of the express provision in the act OF 1870 that
benefits should extend 70 candidates for electors
for Congress or for the State legislature His order in
the Kellogg case TO the United States Marshal to
possession Of the State House for the purpose OF
/ preventing unlawful assemblages under which the
Marshal called TO his aid portion Of the army of the
United States as posse coDitats can ouy be charac
tcrized as gross usurpatlon.


Thus will be seen that every member Of the Sen

which elected Pinchback 'sunlawful assemblage

was in type, we have received further
particulars of the horrible murder
which occurred in Cherry Grove town
ship on the afternoon of the 18th inst.
It seems that Milton Wilson, the per-
petrator of the deed was native Of
Brokenstraw, Penn. and was born in
1929. He had been previously married
and lived in eastern Wisconsin,, and,
after three children were born to them,
his first wife left him because of cruel
treatment. In 1862 he married Cor
nelia Lloyd, in Manchester, Wis.,, and
moving to Cherry Grove some two years
after has resided there ever since. His
late wife had borne him seven children,
the youngest being about twenty months
old. He is described as large man,
very overbearing, quarrelsome and cruel,
but his wife is said to have been an ex-
cellent woman. They have lived un-
happily together for several years, and,
only few days before the murder,
Wilson beat his wife so severely as to
cause miscarriage, and she was still
suffering from that injury when the
fiend cut her throat. Her wounds be-
trayed that the act was committed de-.
liberately and that his purpose was to
put her to death 3; but when he came to
operate upon his own neck the coward
ly brute had not sufficient nerve to in
dict even a decidedly dangerous wound.
He was brought to this city on Satur-
day and placed in the county Jail. He
is said to be very reticent about the
matter Of the crime, but willing enough
to talk upon other subjects, and we are
told that he claims that he will tell all
about the murder, and the motive that
prompted it when he is put on trial,
and denies that the guesses and sugges.
tions which have been made public are
true. The community at Cherry Grove
was greatly excited by the crime, and
only the doctors assertion that Wilson


wounds would necessarily prove fatal


saved the wretch from death by lynch


ing.


i SHORT CRoPs.-We have heard from


all quarters discouragiug accounts abou


the wheat crop but judging from tn
number of Mccormick Harvesters tha


farmers are buying and hauling home
we would expect more than an ave,


age crop. We visited the Reaper var
of Mr.. Brooks, the other day, an
J found him and his men setting up an
loading machines upon wagons at
lively rate."

Also how another, about the same time at Bar boursville. the county of Csbell, was taken out and treated to like dose, from which your readers may infer that justice is rather at low ebb, and to be administered only at the hands of a frenzied people, and re- ally you are not much amiss in your reck- oning.

 The latest tragedy happened Tn the eYen- ing of March lst in our midst in this wise, between Wash Williams and Anderson Grafton, both colored men in the employ of the Ensign manufacturing company. In the family of Williams was fair-skinned, curly-haired, adopted daughter, between whom and the aforesaid Grafton there had sprung up mutual attachment and an agreement that they would, in imitation of the manners and customs of a superior race, have it ratified by an officer of the law. Accordingly, they proceeded to and across the Big Sandy river on to the soil made historic by that famous pioneer and hunter, Daniel Boone, and then and there the loving twain were made one till death do them part, from whence they returned about noon of the same day and proceeded to immediately settle down to enjoy the the bliss of newly welded life in the home of the happy groom, who by the way had been living wldower and was pretty we'll fixed. Wash, the adopted father and father-in-law, not relishing the manner in which the pale-faced daughter of Africa had been spirited away from him, breathed threats of vengeance on the happy pair, which threats he put into execution as soon as night had spread her sable mantle abroad. Having procured large six-bar- relied Colts navy revolver, which was heavily charged with powder and balls, he proceeded to the house of Grafton, who not experimenting any danger, came out to know why he (Williams) was prowling about the house. Williams, after charging him with unfairness in enticing away his his 'Dovinda without permission, suddenly raised his pistol and fired directly in Graf tons face, the ball taking effect in his neck and severing the cutorid artery. The poor fellow turned 10 flee into the house, when the infuriated demon rushed upon him, placing the pistol close to his left arm send ing ball through it and breaking the bone, the pistol being so close that the clothing was burned. As Grafton fled into an inner room; third shot followed, but struck the partition.

 Williams then ran to the rear of the house and fired one shot through the win dow, the ball striking the partition. Back he comes again to the front, and entering the house fired the two remaining shots di- rectly at the bride, one taking effect in hel back and the other passing through the window. In the meantime, Grafton esca ping into the inner room, leaned himself

 upon the table and immediately expired Such was the unhappy state of affairs wher your correspondent reached the house som, five minutes after the first shot was fired

DEMOCRACY.",,"


emulous of the uneuviable notoriety of


being leaders in nefarious methods of de-


frauding Republicans of the results of their


votes, and in attempts at defeating the al


ready expressed will of the people. A few


days since we ventilated, at some length,


the fraud and violence that prevailed in


Petersburg at the last election, by which


city that contained registered Republican


majority of 500 was handed over to the


ex. Confederate Democracy, and now the


same party in Lynchburg puts in bid,


which, if successful, will entitle them to


be regarded as the champion frauds Of the


State.


1t will be remembered that at the NUM-
cipal election which occurred on the fourth


Thursday of May, the Republican candi-


dates for mayor, clerk of the corporation


court, commissioner Of the revenue, city


treasurer and sergeant were elected; the


first named by majority of more than tho


hundred, and the others by msjorities


ranging from 46 down to 8. Not content


with having been fairly beaten at the polls,


(as was admitted the day after the election


by the Star, Democratic paper,) these
defeated Democratic candidates, Gall OF


whom held the offices before and were
candidates for re elec'ion.) fearing to fol-
low the example set them in 1851 by
instituting q little civil war on their
own account, have had recourse to
the Democratic courts as means
of composing their ends. Wehave before
US the copy of document that was filed
in the clerks Office of that city on 5stur-
day week, contesting the right Of the csndi-
dates elected on the Republican ticket last
month to hold their several offices on &C.
count of alleged informalities in q ward
that gave Republican majority OF 236,
and when it is remembered that all three
of the commissioners of election were
straight-out Democrats, the public will be
able to see, in the event of these informal
tiles being established, how near the whole
thing came to being ""put-up job"" The
document to which reference has been
made charges that q Republican challenger
received ballots, put them in the box and
checked them off the registrars book, and
that one clerk, Democrat, acted as clerk
without appointment, and without having
taken the oath of office; that two other
Democrats, (who are named, who were
neither judges nor clerks. aided in counting
and stringing the ballots; and further. that
the Democratic registrar of the ward acted
as judge of the election. These are the
counts in their bill against receiving the
vote of the only clearly. pronounced Re-
publican ward in the city, and by throwing
out which they could count in the defeated
Democratic candidates, and as they are
known to have the courts on the side that
believes in the theory that Republicans
""have no rights that Democrats are bound
""to respect, they doubtless confidently
calculate on q bloodless victory, even
though it be obtained by infamous devices.
If the allegations of the contestants were
true, it is no more than has heretofore
happened in the Democratic wards Of
the same city, and, if it was illegal, why
did the judges of electioE-lll of whom
were Democrats-permit it! They were
sn intelligent men, and, having before
acted in the same capacity, were presumed
to know the election laws of their own
State. We don't profess to know what
will be proven on hearing of the case;
but if the facts be as charged it will look
decidedly bad for the Democratic judges
who permitted the violations of law in the
only Republican ward in the city, and the
only one in which violations Of law are
alleged to have occurred. Not because the
Democratic contestants do not feel assured
of success; for, with the courts organized
as they are in Virginia, there can be little
doubt of it, but evidently with view to
silence the objections that have been
raised at their course by the respectable
portion of the Democrats, the contestants
have engaged every lawyer of pronounced
ability in Lynchburg, with the single ex-
ceptlon of Hon. T. S. Babcock, (who sp-
pears for the defense,) to prosecute their
partisan suit, thinking, doubtless, that by
the special pleading of counsel ""the worse
will be made to appear the better cause""
and the community thereby be kept from
openly denouncing them for their efforts
to foist themselves on a constituency that
had already repudiated them at the polls.


There is another feature of this fraud
ulent effort to deprive the majority of their
right to participation in,'the city govern
ment that will admit Of explanation. In
accordance with the law the ballots of the
three wards-there are but three wards in
the city--were separately sealed up by the
judges of election and deposited
with the clerk of the conrt, the latter of
whom was the defeated Democratic candi-
date for reelection. On the night after the
election the ballots Of the Third ward,
which had given the Republican candidate
for mayor a majority of two hundred and
thirty. six, together with the ballots from
the First ward, which had also given him
q majority of twenty four, were stolen, and
nothing has since been heard Of them.
Who did it, In whose interest was 1t done?
1t will not, perhaps, require a very great
amount OF astuteness on the part of the
reader TO place the responsibility of this
theft on the party in whose interest it was
evidently made. i. e., the Democracy. This
is very apparent, in view of the fact that
the ballots from the Democratic strong
hold, the Second ward, were left un-
touched. .-- ... .. -..r.. a..


There are the devices that are re-
sorted to in q country in which we are
wont to boast Of our freedom Of opin-
ion and liberty in expressing it at the bal
lot box. When stuffed ballots will not
as in Portsmouth, Va, violence
Is resorted to, as in Petersburg, Va. When
it is not safe to try that, the State courts,
organized by partisan Legislature. and
presided over. in the main, by partisan ]
judges. are used to compass the defeat of
the majority when that majority Is Repub-
lican in sentiment. Such trsYesties on lib"

OF the bill was to remove that restriction.

THE Evidence ALL IN AND THE CASE SUMMED


UP B9 BOTH sIDEs-THREATs OF LYNCH


LAW IN CASE THE JURY SHOULD ACQUIT OR


DISAGREE.


The Concord correspondent OF the New
York Sun gives the conclusion of the trial of
Lapsge, charged with the murder of Miss
Josie Lsngmsid. and now under sentence OF
death for the crime, as announced in the
telegraphic columns of the Sentinel: The
usual complacency of the auditors in the
certainty of the conviction of the prisoner
gave place to an anxiety bred not little of
dstrust of the II men to whom the
life of Joseph Lapage has been COM
mitted. They fear that the jurors
NAV have beeOme infected with the doubt
with which they are hardly able to deny the
evidence for the defense had influenced
their own judgments. They have watched
the prisoner to-day with more attentive in
terest than before. As usual hundreds
were unable IN obtain admission to the
court room. The prosecution first called for
the rebuttal George Julius, John Demas
and Edward Gamslain. They rode to Joe
Daigu ault's house in one of Joe Daignault's
teams, arriving there az l2:3O P. NJ. on the
day of the murder. The employees of Daig
nault, who drove the team, had testified
that they found LaTage there talking to
their employer. The sbOve-nsmed wit
nesses swore that, with equal opportunity
to see whoever was talking with Dalgnault,
they did not see Lapage.


BAD FOR PRISONER.


William Il. Cole testified that he was
hauling dirt on the road between Suncook
and the academy on the morning of the MUIR
der, and Lspsge passed him at $50 A. NJ.
going toward the academy. The detectives
were then recalled, and swore that Lapage
invariably told them that Joe Dlignault was
shoeing horse when he arrived there. Joe
Dsignault, when on the stand, swore that he
shed no horses until the afternoon of Octo-
Der 4. The prosecution again rested at this
point, and the defense called in Tebuttal
Gilbert Ralph Rickwood, of the McGill Uni
versity, Montreal. The witness took his
degrees in London, although he had pursued
his studies in Germany well. He testi-
fed that the blood OF men, horses, sheep,
COWS, and goats can re distinguished under
the microscope when fresh, but after it has
become dried the distinction is a mere mat
ter OF opinion, and wholly untrustworthy
as evidence. The ecross-exRminatiOn elected
that the professors opinion was based
from the present advancement of blood
science in Canadian schools. It might be
better understood in Germany, where IL
originated, and wherever mechanical ad
vantages equal to those OF Germany can be
OBJ aimed. The defense rested here, and Drs.
Chase and Hsiles were recalled to show that
the mechanical spectroscopic. microscopic,
and scientific advantages OF Boston are be-
yond criticism. The examination lasted un-
til the noon recess, and both sides resting, it
came to be generally known that the sum-
ming up would begin at P. NJ. Those who
desired to hear that part of the cRse-and
they were about all that had obtained seats
kept their seats with praiseworthy sslf-de-
NAL during the recess of an hour and half.
The prisoner, the jury, and those within the
railing of the bar retired, but those who
counted that their early coming would make
them proprietOrs OF the seats of retiring
auditors were generally disappointed.


SUMMING UP FOR THE DEFENSE.


Counsellor Samuel Page summed up for
the defense. His reputation as a politician
is at least state wide, but general confidence
was INDUCED in that his ADVOCACY of the
prisoner would amount TO nothing, that
Lew Clark, as the attorney-general is ia
miliarly called, could not easily demolish.
AS Mr.. Page proceeded with his argument
a manifest unessiness took possession of the
audience. They eyed Lapsge in way that
indicated that they were growing less as
sured of the certainty of conviction. Coun-
sellor Page pointed out the missing links in
the chain of circumstances with consum-
mate skill. The different identihcations of
Lspage, he contended, were rendered GER
tain by the well-disssminated fact that
the prisoner was confined in the
first cell in the Concord jail. Those
who wished to put nail
into his cofiB were led directly TO that cell;
and so men nearly blind with optical disease,
like Mr.. Towle, spoke certsinly, although
they could not recognize neighbor as far
as they swore Lspage was from them. The
only person who saw Lspage pass the acad-
emy was Miss Gault, although over hun
dred boys and girls wor- playing just inside
the open fence. She swUre that he passed.
The wood choppers who sWore that Lapsge
visited them at A. NJ. in Cofin's lot were
four, to three who swOre that they saw him
there between II and /. This very differ
ence among the canadians, he argued. fully
answered the imp9tatiOn that those citizens
had combined to swear their countrymRn
out of trouble. From these witnesses the
advocate claimed that the prisoner mad es-
tablished, not q sentimental doubt, but one
that almost excluded the hypothesis of his
guilt.


MUTTERINGs.


Those who listened to Mr.. Page from the
outside of the closed windows, by some
sort of magnetism, became aware that he
was shaking the faith of many earnest be-
levers in the prisoners guilt. Those dis
appointed in obtaining access to the court
room heard these rumors with somethi nQ
akin to dismay. ""Thst jury isn't the sort
OF one TO try a case like that"" said one
man. ""Why, the clerk Just told me that a
juryman, while at supper the first night,
broke up his fish balls in his coffee, think
ing they were doughnuts. He ate the mess,
too, just saying they make the cookies pow
erful salty like down here in Concord"" I""
Such juryman, the criticising Daniel de-
clared, was unworthy of trust. Doubt soon
bred determination, and not a few said
openly that ii Lspage should be acquitted IL
would not do him much good. He won't
live to get far from town. Men were even
found who advocated the same sort of
speedy settlement of his case, even
in case the jury disagreed. Attorney
General Clark began his summing up
at o'clock. Hecommented upon the evil
dence that the prisoner was in the academy
road just before the time the girl was MUIR
dered. If the jury believed this evidence

panions knowing this to be the case, de-


terminded to follow their prey on foot
also. Accordingly the major part of the
party at once continued on the trail.
while three or four of the men removed
the body and the horses to Stottler's
inn. Shortly after night had fallen,
Lambert's associates became dissatisfied
with their errand. and in body returned
to the inn.


The intrepid blacksmith noiwithstand.
ing this demoralizing detection, contin.
ued the pursuit alone. After travelling
in northwestern direction for twelve or
fourteen miles, he came to an old and
disused road, running nearly parallel
with the one he had left. This was called
the ""Old Pennsylvania Trace"" between
Philadelphia and Red Stone Old Fort,
situated on the waters of the Mononga-
hela river. 1t was the first road ever
opened between Eastern Pennsylvania
and the head-waters of the Ohio river:
and the ancient landmarks, ''threc chops
and blaze were still visible by dav.
light on the old trees. This ancient road
and landmarks were adopted by the sur
veyors and openers of roads in the West
to propitiate Heaven in favor of the first
settlers of the great western wilderness:
and hen;e the first chop was for the
Father, the second for the Son, and the
third for the Holy Ghost; and the blaze
was merely designated to attract the eve
of the observer.


When Lambert struck this old road.
he discovered on the north side of it di.
lapidated log-cabin. Approaching the
cabin, he noticed a light within, and,
feeling satisfied that the murderers were
close at hand, he gave loud cough.
This brought to the rear door of the
house the old woman who occupied it,
and who obtained living by selling
cakes and beer to passing wayfarers.
Lambert, in a feigned voice, asked to
spend the night within, and was at once
admitted. He had but crossed the
threshold when the report of muskct
was heard in the next room, and the ball
splintered the woodwork above his
head.


Without moments hesitation, Lam
bert, with nothing but his tomahawk in
his hand, sprang into the next room and
struck down the man in whose hand was
the still smoking musket. The williams
companion, the smaller man of tn, two,
at once fed the house. but before he had
passed beyond the light Of the fire with
in. the avenger with the wretch's own
rifle, brought him to the earth in strug.
gle with death that lasted but second. i.
AS soon as he had fired the shot, Lam
bert turned upon the PROSTATE murderer,
who was about to arise, and struck him a
second time, telling him to the floor again.
He then, with rope furnished him by
the old woman, bound the williams hands
and legs securely. In the morning the
avenger borrowed horse from the wo.
man. strapped upon its back the living and
dead murderers, and before nightfal! ar.
rived atStottler' inn. On the following
day the living man was publicly lynched
in front Of the inn, and the bodies were
then consigned to an unhcnored grave.
Lambert's companions, craveu-hearted
as they had proven themselves, we're
loud in praise of their daring leader, who
until the day Of his death, was hero
in the humble circle of life in which he
was placed."

Bosrox, Sept 81, 1919


There Is . fc!gn ot terror account of the tramp
country, in cities and large towns well as in tho
rural districts Their dcpredatons and outrages arc
daily becoming boldcr. Only last Sunday an inoffen-
sivc old woman in the town of OTIS was murdered
without tho slightest provocaton, and when taken
into custody the only explanation offered by the vaga
bond was that ho couldn't help it,"" and he was sper
fecty willing the crowd should lynch him."" An
officer prevented this, however, and The wretch was
to-day committed for murder


Another, the circumstances of which are moro hor
ribe than the above is reported from Meoway,
small town q few miles southeast from this city.
About twelve O'Clock yesterday tramp called AT the
house OF Mr. John Neylon, tho brush factory at
the boundary between Medwny and Norfolk, and
supposed he hnd departed on his travels Ho
proved to be scoundreI, however, he
decoyed littlo daughter of Mr.. Ncylon.
eight years old, the woods attempted to out
rage her. The child screamed for help, notwithstand
Ing tho threats OF tho rulaa and her cfies aroused
her father who at went her relief The tramp
became so cnragod at his failure that he lifted Tho child
bodily and threw her into pond. Hc then fed into
the depths OF the wood ana escaped


Mr.. Ncylon found the child In the pond, and, with
the assistance OF neshbors, rescued her In
hausted condition.


There great excitement In the town over the
affair, and large crowd turned scour the woods
for the culprt The Indignation was intense had
the tramp been caugh, yesterday he would have been
lyncbed. The woods surrounded, but tho search
Tor the miscreant proved unavaing up a late hour
last night IL isxnown that he is sti in the woods,
however, and the search for him continues 1t Is not
improbable that the citzcns will take the law into
their own hands II the criminal should be found"

this particular have been disappointed. and that
have found this session a pleasant sunny pas-
time. And IN going away from here shs II carry
with me those same feelings of friendship for the
members OF TINS legislature that l felt for nv
schooi-boy associates, and which now esteem so
highly. Such acquaintance, such feelinVs of
friendship have never formed from that time nm
til now. And the present occasion reminds me of
those associations find here the same warm friend
ship, the same true affection among the members
of this House that | found there. And I have
learned here, also, another lesson, lesson which
lmpresses itself upon me very powerfully. 1t is
this, that the antagonisms of men arc in a great
measure imaginary that if all human kind could
be associated together closely we have been
during the last fifty days. should learn that the
natural condition of the human heart is kindness
and that the more closely people are brought to-
gether, the warmer that feeling Of kindness will
grow. And while heartily concur in all that has
been said in relation to the presiding officer of this
House, and do heartily concur in it all think

following


Resolved. That the thanks of the members of
this House are due and they are hereby rendered
to James Is. Walker Messenger Edward H.
Crie, First Assistant Messenger, Chas II. Getch

ron and Joseph ID. Randall, Pages, for the faithful
and impartial performance of their several duties
during the present session of the Legislature.


The resolution was unanimously adopted.


Mr.. ROWE said:


MIR. Speaker, feel that l should not be doing
justice to my own feelings if l suffered this ses-
sion to draw to a close without expressing INV
gratitude to tue officers and members of this
House. fully lndorse every resolution that has
been offered. And feel under great obligation
to all for their courtesy and their kindness that
have been extended to me. Courtesy, kindness
and affection has claim that we cannot resist
II forms cord that we cannot sever. If there is
a sight, the semblance of which towers above
everything, 1t Is to see people living together in
harmony, regarding each others rights in everv
respect. must say that the few days that have
spent here are among the plcasantest days of nv
life, and they will ALWAYS afford me great source
OF pleasant recollections. My desire is that this
ieeng shall not be confined to this House, but that
1t shall go out from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
from the Lakes to the Rio Grande, so that this
whole nation, tins whole people shall constitute
one perfect brotherhood ! tender my thanks to
all the officers for their kindness and courtesy ex-
tended to me on all occasions. The thought
that we are about to part brings a sadness to nv
mind. These faces l shall ever recollect and it
VIII afford me the greatest pleasure to meet them
Again thanking the officers and members for their
kindness, bid you good night.


Mr.. FoGLER presented the following


Nesolved, That the thanks of the members of
this House are due, and are hereby rendered to
n. w. Dutton, the faithful and efficient Chairman

the vigilant attention and untiring application
which he has given to the discharge Of his duties


MIR. DUTTON responded in few well chosen
remarks. If he had, as Chairman of the Busi-
ness OF the House, met with any measure of sue
cess, it was largely due to the Kindness and gen.
erosity of the members. He had received naught
but kindness from both officers and members.
Especially was he indebted to the Speaker for
many favors at his hands.


Mr.. TILDES responded in a feeling manner TO
the sentiment embodied in the resolves. II had
not been his purpose to speak, but he could not
remain silent. lie referred to the fact that he
came among the members a stranger, and of the
courtesy and kindness uniformly extended to him.
and closed with thanks to all, his remarks being
received with applause.


Mr.. POWERS OF Houlton, expressed his entire
appreciation of the resolutions in fitting terms,
and returned his sincere thanks for the courtesy
and kindness extended to him BY both members
and officers: 1t gave him pleasure TO say, that in
legisalng for the interests of the State there had
been little or nothing of politics. When the
question comes, what is best for our own State
we are all democrats and we are all republicans
plause.


Mr.. LORD of Lebanon said:


am aware THAT speech is silver and silence is
gold, and yet as one of the youngest members
of this House, cannot leave this assembly with
out extending my thanks for the courtesy and
and prayer shall be, that in the upper courts our
hands may be clasped in the presence of Him who
spako as never man spake.

Speaking. The man lives here and has

Please take what steps are necessary.
There is one United States boarding

Mr.. HOOKER, Of Miss, said he was aware It

Mr.. HOOKER then referred to the conduct of the
carpet-baggers in the South, and quoted from
Mr.. Greeley and others TO show that they were
held in detestation- These carpet-baggers had
gone South to foment discord and stir up strife
and they had been placed in position where their
only policy was 10 plunder the States in which

Mississippi had q record on that question Of which
1t need not be ashamed. He referred to q large
number OF Northern men VINO had settled In the
State before the war, and who were honored By
the State because they came there with means
added to the material industry and attempted to
build up the waste places, and had not come for
purposes of plunder, as the carpet-baggers had.

that large numbers Of negroes.and white Republi-

Mr.. LYNCH's SPEECH


Mr.. LYNCH, of Miss, SAID he wanted to cor
fallen. He recognized the fact that there had
been bad men In the Republican party and
some would attempt to defend all men in the
party. As to the carpet-baggers he recognized
in a great measure the truths of what Mr..
HOOKER had said, but he wanted also to call at
tentiOn TO the fact that the Democrats put these
men in office whenever it suited their purpose to
do So He need only refer to Governor Warmoth,
Of louisiana. The Democrats had denounced
him thief ana q plunderer, and yet as soon as
he went over to the Democratic party he was re-
ceiyed with open arms, and the Democrats were
ready to honor him with the highest office In the


He (Mr. LYNCH could imagine how the chief
mogul of the Democratic party would take War
moth by the hand and say, sIt is true, we have
denounced you as a thief and n plunderer but the
only real crime you committed was In being
Republican and that you have atoned for that
can forgive all minor sins"" Laughter
With regard to the charges nf violence, Mr.
LYNCH insisted that there was an orsaai zation In
the State known as the White League; that
was an armed organization, and that its object
was the intimidation Of Republican voters He
was anxious TO elect only good men to ot1ce, but
they could not vote with the Democracy so long
rs that organization countenanced the White
Leagues, whose object is white supremacy by the
pOwer.Of the bullet if not by the ballot.


He wanted to see the day when these preludices
would all be rooted out, but the cOlOred man could
not vote with the Democrats 80 long as that party
was arrayed against their peace ami quiet, and
did not protect them in all their rights. He was
surprised that MIR. HOOKERS love Of party should
have gone so far as to justify his defense Of the
White League. He (hr- LTSCHl appealed TO the
Northern Democrats to aid in the suppression OF
mob violence in the South, and when that was
done there would be peace, harmony and good
will.

The question Is frequently asked why
don't the Claiborne street railroad
company make some sort Of a combina-
tion with the Pontchartrain company

might be received more gracefully now

two rivals.


Referring to the request of the City
Railroad Company-which has been
granted to them by the Council-to run

\ LYNClIING OF ALLEGED coll


ORED CONSPIRATORS.",", A PLOT REVEALED.","a PLOT REVEALED.
CoIU MBIA, Dec. II. 1876.


The special HERALD correspondent,
sent to inquire into the truth of the alleg-
ed lynching of ten negroes in Abbeville
county, which was reported yesteld day by
the republicans. .telegraphs from that place
| as follows -


""No lynching of negroes has taken
place, either here or in any of the adioin-
ing counties


A HORRIBLE PLOT.
The developments of the plot for the
murder of the whites, arising out of the
pending investigation, are intensely horri-
BILE. Lowndsville, which was to be the
scene of these massacres, is situated in
the northwestern portion of the country
on the Savannah River. twenty miles from
Abbeville, and the same distance from
Anderson. The county is rather sparsely
settled, and the negroes are largely in the
majority. The plot proposed to kill all
the whites in the town, and then go from
house to house in the country. On the
night of the murder of Allen all the road,
leading to Lowndsville were closely pick
eted by from fifteen to twenty armed ne
kIOtS, OllC oQIdh StstlonCt tllC IEtSDl-
terian church, where Allen was muir
dered.


THE MURDER OF ALLEN.
Allen and his friend Baker had been
visiting ladies and were on mrs way
home, when they were halted in mont of
church. They Immediately stopped, and
command to fire was given by one of
the negroes. Some one in the crowdshout-
ed to the negroes to ''hold on"" but the
command was given again and the firing


Immediately took place. Allen, being
pierced by six bulleas, fell from his horse
dead. Bakers horse wheeled and ran
with his rider, who was wounded in the
neck. One of the negro militia ran out
and fell over Aliens corspc. and fired at
Baker without effect. Baker returned to
town and gave the alarm. After the fir
ing the negro piekets on the other roads
leading to the town concentrated upon
the firing party y the church, but soon
after dispersed. No action was taken by
the people or the authorities until the
next day, when Trial Justice Beckham
issued warrants for the arrest of the sus-
pected persons.


NEGEo's CONFESSION


The negro named Maxwell, who was
arrested, made a full confession.


The officers succeeded in arresting only
seventeen of GO or 20 in the plot


The first negro arrested was discovered
by wad shot from his gun, which was
found near the scene of the murder of
Allen. 1t was the margin of the Union
Herald, Governor Chamberlain's organ,
which had the negro's own name written
on it, He was at once arrested, and on
this evidence made full confession.


The utmost quiet prevails, and if there
had been disposition to lynch the
negroes heretofore that terrible alterna-
tive has been abandoned."

piraiion of the morning hour consideration


was resumed of the bill TO carry into effect
the provisions OF the Hawaiian treaty. Sen.
alcr Sargent spoke in favor OF the hill, and
senator West in opposition. The joint reso.
luton proposing an amendment TO the con-
stitution of the United States, prohibiting
appropriations for sectarian schools, was
read third time, in accordance with an
order of the senate last evening. Mr..
Anthcny called up senate bill to print the
report of the proceedings Of the Belknap

then took recess. Evening sessi""'--uron

Mr.. Salisbury continued his argument.


In the senate, on the 14th, Mr.. Har-
vey called up the house bill for the sale Of
Sabine islands. Several amendments were
agreed to and the bill passed. Mr.. Edmunds
moved 70 take up the proposed constitu.
tiona amendment prohibiting the appro-
pration Of money for the support Of sec
tartan schools. Agreed to; yeas 23, nays 13.
A discussion then took place, which lasted
until the expiration Of the morning hour,
when the matter was laid over and the sen
ate proceeded to consider unfinished bust
ness, which was the bill to carry the Hawai-
ian treaty into effect, Mr.. Norwood continu-
ing his remarks in opposition TO the bill.
After long debate the senate by vote of

In the senate, on the 18th, proceeded to
the consideration of house bills granting
pensions to various persons, and large
number were passed, but before acting on
all on the calendar a motion for an execu-
tive session made by Mr.. Anthony :was
agreed to and at 1890 the galleries were
cleared and the doors closed. Senate re-
sumed session at two O'Clock, and Mr.. Win
dom moved TO take up the house resolution,
providing for final adjournment of con-
gress, and to amend the same so as to ad-
journ finally at three o'clock this evening.
Several senators objected, and the motion
WAS then withdrawn. A bill to provide for
the payment of a full months wages to cer-
tain OF the employees recently permanently
discharged from the bureau OF engraving
and printing of the treasury department,
was passed without amendment. The chair
laid before the senate message from the
president Of the United States, returning,
without his approval, senate bill to provide
for the sale of a portion Of the reservation
of the confederated Otoe and Missouri bands
of Indians, and Sacs and Fox Indians in
Kansas and Nebraska. Also another mes
sage from the president, stating that he was
convinced, after further examination. that
his message, returning the bill without his
signature was premature, and requesting
that the bill might be returned to Finn for
his signature. A motion to refer the mes
sage was rejected. The question being on
the passage of the bill. Notwithstanding the
objections of the president, it was passed by
a unanimous vote. The amendments II the
house to the bill fixing the limit Of expendi-
ture for the erection of public buildings at
Little Rock was concurred in and the bill
passed House bill for the relief Of Mrs. J.

Windom called up house joint resolution
providing for final adjournment, and moved
10 amend so that the houses of congress
should adjourn at ~ o'clock this evening.
The amendment was agreed TO, and the res
oution as amended adopted. At 1880 p. M.
he hammer of the presiding officer, Mr.
Ferry, fell, and he spoke as follows: Be-
fore declaring the order of adjournment
permit me, sepators, to express my obliga-
tons for the trust confided and for the cour-
tesy extended to me throughout an arduous
session of eight months and over, now
drawing to close. For your generous
support through an impeachment trial and
during my first regular sessions experience
as your presiding officer, accept my hearty
thanks. This session has drawn to close,
and while associated with other historical
events it Will especially be notable as EN-
bracing the union of two centuries in the
life of the republic. National permanence,
however, is no guarantee against personal
change. We are about to part, but not with
out the suggestive reflection that in the first
month of the new century and next to this
in which we separate our number was
broken by the death OF one whose short
senatorial career had won the attachment of
many and the respect of ALL and by the de-
parture of another whose longer career had
qualified him for the merited place OF exc
cutive adviser, which he now honors with
credit to himself and the senate. In re-
tuning to your several states to greet their


approval of your distinguished services, may
heaven kindly care. attend and return you

senate whose valued aid, has enabled me to
hold your confidence, tender sincere ac-
Acknowledgement. Finally wishing you safe

The house, ON the 18th, resumed the
political discussion, and was addressed by
Mr.. Lynch. The report.was then agreed TO.


BY it the following missions are practically.
abolished, as no appropriations are made for
ministers to any of them: Portugal, Swift

The bill provides, however, for charge de

Paraguay and cities of 5000 each. The fol-

WHAT THE PRESS SAYS ABOUT IT.


Governor Ti'den's nomination Is not
equivalent to au election, for this Pres
'deltlal election is to be one of the
most vigorous and most closely con-
tested that has ever taken place III the
history Of the country. The result is
so doubtful that the canvass will have
all the interest of a game in which the
skill If the players keeps the judg-
ment of the spectators in suspense
The chHnces are so doubtful that putt
lie expectation will be kept on the Yui
rjUc throughout. It is safe to say
that we are entering on one of the
most Interesting, vigorously contested
and doubtful Presidential contests
that has ever taken place since the or
ganizatiOn of the gOvefnment.-N. Y.
Hcrald.


THE WORK AT ST. LOUIS.


The democratic convention has
fought bitterly but briefly, and after
filling all the St. Louis bar rooms with
riot for two or three days has placed
an admirable candidate upon a bad
platform, and has now paused for
breath. 1t was wise to nominate for
the presidency its very strongest man.
With new and rising statesman Ike
Governor Hayes its case would have
been hopeless. York Tribune.


FOR THE CoUNTRY's INTEREST.


We care not for the party. but in the
interest of the country this opens
way for escape from evils and dangers
which threaten the republic. The
nomination cannot fail to excite III
every part of the 5untry the most
hearty and hopeful enthusiasm. We
admit no doubt of its success.-NeW
York SIN.


SYMBOL OF REFORM.


Cincinnati gave the nation a candi-
date without purpose, on platform
without a meaning. st. Louis re-
spends with a candidate whose name
is the symbol of reform, upon a plat
form which meaus a peaceful revolu-
ton in the conduct of the govern
ment.-NeaO York World.


CLOSE OF The BANKS.


There will be a revulsIon all along
the center of the country, for the party
IN its wisdom has virtually abandoned
these States. We prefer Tilden to
Hayes, and shall advise the democratic
organizations to stand by the nomi-
nees. The election of Tilden would
signalize the triumph of certain iemo-
cratic principles. We shall feel it our
duty to counsel harmony for the or
ganization of the democratic party. It
mnst be preserved. There is nothing
for the democratic party to do but to
close ranks and move forwatd.-Cin-
c5'anati Enquirer.


REPUBLICAN SATISFACTION.

the choice of Tilden the republicans

An amusing case of absent. minded
ness occurred yesterday, and the joke
stands against our friend Captain
Smith, a well known contractor Of this
city. The Captain, it seems, has an
excavating implement in the form OF
a scraper on wheels. The machine
had been at Joughin's blacksmith
shop for repairs, and when the Cap
hitched his horses to it for the purpose
of taking it away yesterday afternoon,
he was busily engaged thinking of his
grandmothers' second cousin. He
took the road toward home and the
Horses tugged away with their main
strength to pull the machine which
should have rolled off as lightly as u
sulky. Still tie Captain failed to no.
tice the over-exertion of his animals
from having so much 10 think of in
Connection with his grandmother's Sis
ter's husband. At last the fretting
and putting team stopped from sheer
inability to pull II foot further, and
when the Captain recovered from his
revery and looked around for the
cause of the stoppage, he found his
scraper loaded down with dirt and
macadam, and wide furrough plowed
i'm the street for the distance of five ol
six squares. The Captain is moral
man and did not swear-only o little
to himself."

led him.


Col. Febiger read the following letter
which will explain itself:


WILMINGTON, April 5th, 1875.


Chairman of Water Committee,


SIR, Owing to the accumulation OF wa.t te
water from Rodney, Downward, and ad-
Joining properties on Franklin streets im-
mediately west of the Cool Spring Reservoir
the safety of the banks Is seriously en-
danpered by the water settling and forcing
a passage to find a lower level. I am un-
able to conduct the water away; not having
the authority to change the grade of Mr..
Downward's lot on the bed of Franklin
street, through which drain should be
constructed to carry the said water to
Peunsylyania avenue, thereby lessening the
volume which at present flows along the
north side of the reservoir, overfowing Mr.
Grants property and threatening break o
the bank which will certainly be the un-
fortunate result if measures are not at once
taken to conduct the drainage elsewhere.


Permit me, therefore, to urge upon your
honorable body the necessity OF obtaining
the right of way on franklin street tt
Pennsylvania avenue. -,


Hoping that this matter will meet,witf
your prompt attention. I ?smain respect
fully yourse A,1Sv Rrru

Murder In Phlladel phla.",,"AN ITALIAN SHOOTS A CoLoRED AAN-0NE


OF THE CHASTITY PHASES OF PHILADEL-


PHIA LIFE AMONG THE LowLY.


From Times Of Yesterday.


Cries of murder fell on the ears of the
startled inhabitants of the vicinity of
Seventh and St. Mary streets at an early
hour last evening. Crowds rushed into the
drinking saloon on the southeast corner of
the said streets named, whence the cries
proceeded, to find Harry Gibbs, colored
barber, dying In the arms of his friend,
Joshua Deal, shot through the heart by
Columbo Rassazzi, an Italian bar tender.
The saloon is one of the worst In the lowest
quarter of the city and is frequented by
abandoned characters of all colors and both
sexes.


A Times Reporter visiting the place re-
ceived the following account of the horrible
affair: Gibbs had been in the place several
times during the day and had obtained
several drinks for which he had not paid.
About five O'Clock be and Deal entered be
saloon and again demanded drinks. The
bar. tender refused Gibbs, and ordered him
out of the house. The latter 81 lied
beer glass and threw it at the bar tender,
shivering the glass to atoms and breaking
several bottles. Luchini, one of the pro
prietors, c.ied, 1t is stated, ""ehoot
him."" when Rassazzi drew revolver and
fred, the ball striking Gibbs in the right
breast and passing through hts heart. Luchi-
nj denies having told Rassazzi 10 shoot. As
soon as he fred Rassazzl ran up stairs, fol-
lowed by crowd of negroes, who cried:
Murder p ""Officer!"" etc. Officer John
Votz soon arrived, and arrested both Lu-
chini and the murderer and conveyed them
to the Third district station house. He had
some difficulty 10 converting his prisoners to
the station on account of mob of negroes
who insisted on lynching Rassszzi. Off,
GERS of the Nineteenth district started to
take Gibbs to the Pennsylvania Hospital, but
he was dead before they reached there. The
Coroner took charge of the body
and had it taken to the Nor
que, where a post-mortem examiua-
lien will take place to-day. The inquest
will take place to- morrow.


Charlotte Duffy, colored female, who
was In the saloon and says she saw the
shooting, told TINES reporter that two
men were fighting in the place, that Harry
Gibbs went to seperrte then, when Rassazzi
jumped over the counter and struck Gibbs;
that Gibbs asked what he meant and
that Bassazzi then drew revolver and fred.


Gibbs is said to have been good work
man, and was considered peaceful .man,
except when drinking Rassazzi was con-
cered in stabbing affray about fohr years
ago at the George NJ. Wharton school
house, Third street above Lombard, where he
was at work at the time. The neiphbor
hood in which this tragedy took place is
one of the lowest in the city, and the
streets contiguous have an evil repute.
Tnis last terrible crime but adds another
chapter to the list of horrors that has
made St. Mary's street famous."

It is well enough to tell things Of this
kind when they occur, but it won't do to get
TOO far ahead. Neither Mr.. Pattinson nor
any one else has been appointed special Con-

ably be might have been appointed, if it were
not for the fact that the Commissioners have
no authority to give said appointment to any
one but resident of St. Georges hundred,
for under the laws Of the State no one can
be appointed Constable who has not resided
in the hundred, for which be is appointed, at
least six months. That blocks the game SO

Some were appropriate and sentimental, 9TH

An WILMINGTON CHRONICLE E


MARRIED IN HASTE TO REPENT At
'L1rsuRn-THx HISTORY OF A RUNAWAY


AATCH-THE CASE IN COURTS. .,giI


In the year 1855 there lived upon Du-
points Banks two families of the name Of
Lynch and Bratton. One Of Mr.. Brattqn's
daughters was then about fifteen years Of
age, and she attracted the attention Of. John
Lynch, a con of the e.dcr. A runaway
match was the consequence, as neither of
the parents had any knowledge Of the in
tended marriage, and would not have given
their consent. They were MARI led In st.
Joseph's Church, Brandywine, IN February,
1856 '0H'''I oil! ~ 1sH - -


Tiny went to housekeeping in an humble
way, Lynch being about twenty -one years
of age, and was learning the business of
the manufacturing Of wooden goods. ,: wo
children were born to them, William and
and Mary In 1859, ip consequence Of want
Of employment, or inability to keep house,
Mrs. Lynch returned to her fathers house
with her two children, Lynch being forbid
den to visit her there. .si. .1.. .r.i5.i


For seven years, until 1866, Lynch alter
mated between peddling and painting, saw
ing, meantime, some money, with which he
started = liquor store At Second and Orange
in this city. The wife and he again lived
together In house taken and furnished by
Lynch at Sixth and Tatnall Streets For
some time things went on 1ourishingly,
Lynch doing good business, keep
ing q carriage and 4 pair Of stylish
horses,r and during this time there ap-
pears to have been no disputes between the
two, man and wife. It appears that Lynch
gradually fell into habits of intoxication,
which ended in his failure in business and
quarrels and trouble at home. Mrs. Lynch,
either prompted by her friends or driven by
the bad habits of her husband, to whom she
had in the meantime bore two other chill
dren, named respectively John and James,
petitioned the Legislature Of Delaware in
March, 1878, for divorce, which was
granted upon the 14th of the same month,
and by the End section of the bill divorcing
her, the care and custody of her children
was committed to her. In the following
August, Mrs. Lynch died. After the death
|of the mother, the habits of Mr.. Lynch
completely, changed, and from being man
OF intempsrsts habits, he became q model of
sobriety and industry, and has continued so,
until now. In april, 1874, he married q
woman Of some fortune, commenced busi
ness IN Philadelphis, ,,and feeling that he
would like 70 have the custody Of his chill
dren, fled his petition for writ of habsas
corpus in the Superior Court Of this county,
praying for the custody Of his three surviv-
ing children, ono having died of sun stroke
in August, 1874. The writ was granted as
prayed for, directed to Mr.. James Bratton,
the natural grandfather Of the children,
who had assumed charge OF them upon the
death of their mother, and taken them to
his home on Market street in this city. & 1


The hearing upon the writ 30 grained !,
WAS heard yesterday, by Judge Wales, In
the Law Library, st 10 o'clock a. m, q
number Of witnesses were examined by Mr..
Spruance, on the part of Mrs. Bratton, who
most mutely detailed the story as above
told, but Of course deepened and colored by
their feelings. Upon the part of Mr.. Lynch,
many respectable witnesses were examined,
including his brother, q clergyman, appar-
emily most satisfactorily proved Lynch's
complete reformation and contradicted many
of the averments of the other side. One
Of the painful features OF the case was the
testimony of Miss Mary Lynch, a young
girl of about II years Of age, who mani
tested intense hostility to her father.


The case was one in which Intense feel
ing was manifested by both sides. 1t lasted
the entire day until six in the evening, and
was concluded by Mr.. Spruance for the
Bratton's, and by Mr.. O'Byrnc for Mr..


The Judge will consider the case and de-
eide It 1t some future day. Meantime the
children will remain with their grand
father,-r.r"

to repair the road from Milneburg TO

under control Of the Canal Company.

pany II In need of repairs but II In un-
dersteod to be In fair condition.


Major Burke has also requested Mr..
Hardee. City Surveyor to make gen
eral inspection OF the whnrves and re-
port on their condition, This Is proba-
bly, for the purpose Of correcting the
belief OF some Of the Administrators
that II will take large sum to put the
wharves Ia thorough repair.


Capt, Tads having applied to the City
Council for the loan of one Of its dredg'
Ing machines 10 aasiHt In scraping the
river bottom Of the ietties In order to
facilitate friction by the current, Major
burke will probably lend the ''olan

to the great annoyance OF the people OF
the neighborhood.


II was expected that Administrator
Brown would present his report on the
budget tomorrow. when the Council
meets, but for several reasons the re-
port will be deferred One Of these
reasons la the probability Of the. closing
up Of the private markets, which will
necessarily increase the value OF the
public markets and therefore the reve-
nues of the city. In fact since
the opinion of Judge Lynch
on the market question has been made
known, several new offers have been
made TO the city for the markets, which
are said To be great improvements on
previous ones. 1t may, therefore, under
the circumstances. be. unnecessary TO
reduce the number of the oity's en-
ployeeH or tho salaries Of those who
would have been retained under the
original proposition."

PLANTATION, sc.


The City Council met in regular
session, last evening, President Lich-
tenstein in the chair.


When the special committee to in
vestigate the alleged regularities in the
accounts of Chas. Burton, Jr., late
Registrar of the Water Department.
was called, Mr.. McIntire, chairman of
the committee, presented letter from
Mr.. Burton.


The letter requested another post.
ponement of the report for one week,
as a full investigation of the Water
Department books, which was now be-
ing made, would show the city indebt-
ed to him. to the extent of about
$500.


The committee was conti1u ued anoth-
er week.


The City Treasurer reported Balance
in bank subject to the reservoir, 1856.
570.62; the current expenses, $40 .487.
46; redemption of bonds, $700. Total,
S47.75S.0S.


The Street Commissioner reported
Sc men and II horses and carts en-
pIoyed in the Street Department, pay
roll, $50O,50.


The Chief Engineer reported IA men
employed at the Water Works, pay
roll, $171 90; construction of pipe, 25
men pay roll, ,S204.21; at the reservoir,
175 men and 35 horses and carts, pay
roll, $1163. .65; pay roll for carts, 1851 /
43. Total, 1913 men and 35 horses and
carts, with total pay roll of $780,
90.


The Street Department pay roll al
lowed the two foremen $1.75 per day,
but on motion of Mr.. Farrell they
were allowed 25 cents extra for last
Friday and Saturday, in accordance
with the ordinance passed last Thurs
day night, fixing their wages at 81 per
day.


When the reservoir pay roll was
read, Mr.. Febiger objected to the
item, ""H. B. McIntire, general fore
man, So per day."" stating that the
ordinance fixed the pay of foremen at
80 per day.


MIR. Farrell moved that general
foreman"" be stricken from the pay roll
and superintendent"" inserted in lieu
therof.


MIR. Febiger raised the point OF order
that such a motion could not be enter
tanned, as it conflcted with the lOrdia'
ance. The chair declared the point
well taken, IN his opinion, and express
sed a desire to hear the opinion OF the
City Solicitor on the subject.


MIR. Farrell appealed from the deci-
sion of the chair.

OF lynching the prisoner heard but this feeling
seemed to die out toward evening when the verdict OF
the Coroner jury announced. The main facts Of

I toward the sink, the woman's clothes covered with

! wounds he said during two days previously


Bernard Petty and Sergeant Hough corroborated the
above witnesses


Captain Robbins testified TO having searched tho
| prisoner. Being confronted with Ryan, Bartell said
| that he was not the Ryan he meant There were
good many Ryans around that neighborhood;"" adding,
al don't want give anybody away can stand all

| Rev Hugh Flaherty, pastor OF St. Cccilias Roman

the Needs OF tie Street-H is Rendered


one of the Filthiest Streets IN the City


a,ud should be Paved The Vote on tie


Ordinance.


At the meeting of City Council last
night, the ordinance authorizing pave
ing of Walnut street was, on motion
of Mr.. MeMenamin, called up for
third reading.


Mr.. Febiger said he would vote
against the ordinance. The petitions
ers for the work only numbered thir-
teen persons, and they were not large
owners. There was heavy remon-
STRANGE against the work, and it would
not be doing justice to the community
or to the financial condition of the city
to pave the street.


Mr.. Murphey said.'.lt is very
strange thing that gentlemen who have
no pecuniary interest in Walnut street
Should take such deep interest IN the
question of paving. Walnut street is
very level and we'll adapted t. heavy
hauling. 1t has been sadly neglected
for years, and has become reservoir
for filth and dirt. 1t should have been
paved twenty five years ago. Gentle
men who live on French street. and
whose property runs back to Walnut
street, have making the latter street
the receptacle for all their dirt and
garbage. have been in business on
Walnut street, and have seen my carts
up to the hubs in mud on winter days.
l have often wondered why the street
was not paved. and suppose it is just
hnna,co Of
1t is not justice to the city to allow
this street to 60 unpaved when so many
other streets of far less Importance have
been paved for years. The street has
been kept in bad condition long
enough, for the accommodation of
those who wish to make nuisance of
it, and now let otheIs have chance.
The paving can be done more cheaply
now than at any other time, and there
can be no political capital made out of
the work, as it is too late to colonize
the wards, and the paving will be done
by contract. There are some rich pro
perty owners along the street who
wish to keep it in its present filthycon
dition until ""Kingdom Come"" and it
is not right to allow these men to stop
the wheels of progress, and TO contin-
ue filthy nuisance on large import
ant street.


Mr.. Paynter referred to the fact that
the petition was presented to Council
May 25th last and that all the members
of the Street Committee had signed a
favorable report upon it. Now the Re-
publican memb bers of the committee op-
posesthe report. He could not see why
an important thoroughfare like Walnut
street should be neglected and unpaved.
He had examined the remonstrance, and
found one-third of the signers were poor
| colored men living above Ninth street.
Then he endeavored to have the report
amended SO as to extend the paving only
| to Ninth street, but failed. These col
ored men, and residents of French street
comprise large majority OF the remon-
strants. Others are men who are trying
| to escape payment Of their 1st debts for
the paving of Fourth street.


| Mr.. VIM. Candy admitted that the en-
tire committee had signed the first re-
port, but claimed that the remonstrances
had not been fairly considered, and that
the committee had held its meetings on
the subject of which the minority had
not received any notice. He asked Mr..
Mr.. A did so.


Mr.. Farrell Ito Mr.. Adams) Did you
not cay, a week ago, that you would
have favored the paving Of Walnut
street had it not been fer the slight cast
upon you, by your not receiving motto e
Of the Street Committee meeting?


Mr.. Adams.-I do not so remember.


Mr.. Farren.-I can prove it by Joseph
Flanagan.


Mr.. Candy said he thought the street
needed paving, but under the circum
stances it would be an outrageous act
and if the work was ordered he thought
the property owners would get an in.
Junction.


Mr.. Farrell saw the Almighty dol.
lar in the opposition to the paving OF
Walnut street it was the natural com.
bination of the rich man against the poor
man, which has resulted in the stagna.
ton of business which now exists all
over the country. The rich men have
banded together as unit to reduce the
wages of the laborer. They are working
for this object all oyer the country. and
Wilmington is about the only city where
laborers are paid S1.50. These are the
men who oppose giving work to poor
men, and they are aided by treaohorous
press which can be subsidized and
bought. The Press has become one of
the most internal machines of the pres
ent century, and has been used in grind
ing down the poor men until it is the hu.
gest invention Of tyranny this free coun
try ever perceived.


Mr. Farrell then referred to the Gus
tom of Philadelphia, in paving and lay.


ing pipes in streets as soon as they are
opened, which custom he highly com


mended. He stated that Mr.. James F
Trainor, who had store on Walnut
street, moved away on account OF tht
on Sixth street. He closed by strongly
urging the paving.


Then the ordinance was adopted by


the following vote:

Friday morning a negro named Sam
Camden was arrested in this city on
the chargeof committing an atrocious
outrage upon little girl only nine
years of age, the daughter OF d. X.
Hatfield. Even the negroes themselves
threatened at the time to lynch the
brute, and Hatfield, the father of the
ruined child, while attempting to
avenge her by shooting the negro, was
arrested and closely confined until the
negro was safely guarded and out of
was admitted to bail to keep the peace
in the sum of $500.


The ficnd entered Mr.. Hatfield's
house while he and Mrs. Hatfield were
absent. When he was arrested the au
thorities dceme,i it unsafe to commit
him to jail, and he was held in charge
of strong guard until the excitement
should subside. Last night a number
of armed and disguised men arrivedat
Barboursville, near here. They pro-
| ceeded to the Jail and demanded the
keys. These being refused, they
found lot of stonemason's tools,
with which they succeeded in break
ing open the door. They had some
trouble in obtaining tho keys. butfi-
nally succeeded in getting them. They
took Camden out and marched him
through the main street OF Barbours'
vile. They then proceeded to the
railroad depot and from thence down

Grand Jury was sworn in, Evan G. Stotsen-


burg being made foreman.


The presiding Judge, Wootsn, then
charged the Grand Jury briefly


Gentlemen Of the Grand Jury, it has not
been customary for many years for the
Court to deliver to your body, long writ
ten charge as formerly. The Revised Code
has been SO well arranged, and the laws 10
| admirably classified, that there has been no
| necessity for such charge. At the present
criminal term, | am happy to say for the
credit of New Castle county, there ale no
capital felonics of which she has had for


merly too large number. Most of the
business which will fall under your notice,
are assaults, batteries, larcenies, and viola
tions of the liquor law.


The Court here called the attention of the
Grand Jury to the Revised Code, and cs-
pecially to the act for the regulation of the
sale OF liquor. He said that it was not for
the Court to judge as to the wisdom or
otherwise of the the liquor law, it was the
! law OF the State, and should accordingly
be obeyed, and especially by those to whom
the sale Of liquor had been granted.
The Grand Jury then retired.
The Court proceeded to take up the cases
as follows:


State vs. Robert Lansing, indicted for
gambling. The Attorney General retired
this case, Lansing being at large.


State vs.. John G. Hey. Assault and
battery upon Dugan with intent to kill.

guilty of simple assault, and the court
! after hearing evidence of the nature of the
transaction fined Hey $40 and costs.
Another case against Hey, growing out


OF the same fight was nolls fros'd with
costs.


State vs.. Daniel O'Neill. Assault and


battery upon A. Wingate, with intent to


KILL This was the case in which The Doyle
girl was shot last year while O'Neill,
police Of1lcer then, was pursuing Wingatc
| to arrest lin, and shot after hitA. A noHs
pros was entered.


State vs.. George Revis. Larceny, May


10Th Of last year, of articles valued at $50
from the house of Thomas Poole, situated
in Mill Crock Hundred. The jury found
him ""not guilty""


State vs. Michael Lynch. Selling liquor
without license. Lynch pleaded ""guilty""
and was mulcted $50 and costs.
Tho remainder of the morning was occu-
pied in fOrfeiting the bonds Of men who had
given bonds to appear to answer the charge
Of violating the liquor law, and who had
failed to appear.


State W. Abraham Kinslow. Appeal In

until P. NJ when it adjourned until

Tho Court then proceeded to arraign Ed /
ward Myers, VIM. Benton and WIN. Diggs,

Davis, white men, against all of whom true
bills were found in the morning for larceny.
All pleaded ""Not guilty."" The first ease
up was State "". Edward Myers, larceny OF

strong protestations Of innocence, and the

WHERE SHALL THE cIrYs oYFAL BE DUMPED !?
One of tho most remarkable events that has been
chronclcd for years in police annals happened yester
day afternoon in the Lower Bay about two miles south
o. Coney Island.


Forty men OF the Brooklyn police force under com.
mand OF Sergeant Carpenter, OF the Eighth precinct
stood on the deck of the tug W. f. Cheney employed
by the Street Cleaning Department Of this city In tow
Ing scows to sea, momentary expecting an
attack from a squad Of fifteen of tho New York
police including Superintendent walng and Captains
Gunner, Klilea and Irving. The latter stood the
upper deck OF the police boat Seneca, alongside the
Cheney, waiting only for the word Of command from
Commissioners Wheeler and Nichols who were on
board, and the word was very near being given.


Every determined and the occasion was
OF intense excitement A loaded howit yawned
from the Seneca Brooklyn officers ready If the
worst do terrible execution, but fortunately
the storm cleared away ard nobody was hurt


THE OCCASION


Of this extraordinary condition OF affairs was
the prearranged action OF Shore Inspector
Cornelius Ferguson, who, claiming to bc act
ing under the law, took forty policemen from





Hopkins, and boarding the Cheney. which was towing
five scows loaded New York street refuse arrested
all board and forbid tho dumping OF the material.
The arrest claimed to have been made
under the law OF 1875, which makes 1t
necessary Tor all persons dumping garbage in
the bay or ocean to first obtain permit from the
Shore Inspector for the county, the object being
give such inspector the right apart whatever
hours he desires for the dumping At the time Of the
arrest Commissioners Wheeler and Nichols wero at
Coney Island point engaged in inspecting the shore.
with view to ascertain what truth there in tho
frequent complaints by citizens OF Long and Coney
Islands that offensive material from tho street cleaning
scows aoated ashore and created stencil. Accompa-
nving them were Superintendent walling, Captains
tcndent O'Brcn, Chief Clerk Hawey Counsellor
MacI.ea and exEycise Commissioner Stincr They
had been brought down by the police boat Seneca aud
first stopped at Bath. where they made careful
animation, finding nothing more offensive than stale
bread and melon rnds. At Coney Island point nothing
whatever offensive was found, ana Ex-senator Norton
OF that place. had no complaints TO make. While at
tho point the startling intelligence received
tha, the Cheney had been boarded and
got under way and was soon alongside
BROOKLYN policemen swarmed the decks of the Cheney
and Captain Kelley OF the boat fastened To shout TO
the Police Commissioners that he and his men
under arrest. Commissioners Wheeler Nichois held
hasty consultation, in which Superintendent Wall
ing Captains Gunner Killlca and Irving participated
The result was feeling of decp Indignation





the Commissioners having had legal advice
that the law under which the arrest
Claimed to be made was not applicable to the
Street Cleaning Department, which dumped nothing
offensive in the bay, the offensive matter, such as
dead animals and decayed vegetables being IN every
instance turned to the Health Department which
had them towcd to by with Frank Swift.
Feeling thus satisfied that Ferguson's action nrb
trary and Illegal they determined to resist Capt Gun
demanded Of the Brooklyn force their right board
the Cheney. curt answer came back thst they
acting under orders aud meant to hold the boat and all
board The defiance was too much for the New
York police to bear and they prepared for action.
Superintendent Waing hastily consulted with the
minute aerward gave the order to Captains Gunner,
kilca and Irving


TO GET READY FOR AN ENGAGEMENT


The Seneca mustered only fifteen men all told beside
the Commissioners and reporters, but the deficiency
was made up by the howitzcr, which Captain Irving
quickly placed in position to sweep the deck tho
adversary At this juncturo James Jones Roundsman
OF the Seneca who was prisoner on board the Cheney
Jumped away from the Brooklyn officers and
cheers by the New York crew. The seventy
five Italians the five scow loaas OF material in tho
meantime ran about, pitcho IN hand in a terrible
state of excitement. Az last the Commissioners took
the initiative by giving the order for the Italians to
commence dumping and fear no danger The pitch.
forks were used with unusual rapIdity and
the refuse noated in largo quantities The
Brooklyn officers, amazed at the boldncss
OF their opponents stood SILENT but they got
forccmcnts from the n. X. Hopkins which came up
alongside with twenty more officers and the shore
inspector Then the Commissioners anxious II possi-
BILE, to avoid actual conflict ordered the New York
men below. expecting that Mr.. Ferguson would
board, show his authority and explain his action,
but no would not do SO.

at last acted as the go beweeR and boarded the Hop
kins. Ferguson was firm He meant hold the
at all hazards An entue seemed more Imminent
than before but finally the Snore Inspector agreed to
90 back to Fort Hamilton and consult Judge Church,
who gave the warrant OF arrest II he said, 'Let the
men 80 their own recornzancc until the day Of
trial, he would do so. otherwise not


HOW 1T ENpED


At nine O'Clock the Seneca arrived Mt Fort Hamilton.
where Ferguson informed the Superintendent that tho
Judge would not release the men. The Cornmiss
appointed Superintendent Walng, Captains Gunner
and kiililea committee to offer behalf or the
Police Department OF New York to become responsible

 In the year 1875 there were only thirty seven deaths in the town of Canton, the least number in any one year for over 20 years. During the past fifteen days there have been ten deaths within half mile of the Collinsvllle post-offlce. The following are the names. ages and dates: Cecelia Shetz, Jan. 30, aged 36; George Stebbins, Feb. 8, aged 2; Catharne Samsel, Feb. 4, aged 6s; Mary label. Feb. 5, aged 6; Mi chael Pfelfer, Feb. 6, aged 72; Conrad Hobine, Feb. z, aged I9; Elizabeth Tabel, Feb. 9, aged 5; Lena Schultz, Feb. II, aged 8; Thomas Lynch, Feb. 12, aged 8 ; Sarah Beachamp, Feb. l3, aged 35. Seven of the above were German, two French and one Irish. The five children named died of scarlet fever, which is quite preva- lent in this section...... Monday morning the 7th inst, John Shultz, while oilinx llne of shafting, was caught by his clothing and carried around nearly one hundred times, striking the timbers above and be- low, badly bruising his feet and legs, and UIcdhluS Ouo lc& dUOVe anu DelOW ble knee, dislocating both ankles, breaking one arm twice, also two ribs and shoulder blade. He was at first supposed to be dead, but soon revived. Dr. Sweet of Hartford adjusted the fractures, and thinks he will recover without much permanent lameness. It was a wonderful escape from instant death......P Prof. l.. c. Bateman of Fowler & Wells Chronological Institute, New York, recently gave six lectures on phre- nology, physiology and physiognomy to full houses in Union Hall Prof. B. is a young man of only 27 years, yet will nl- ready rank among the abless expounders of that interesting science. With a rapid utterance and ready command of language, mingled with exquisite humor and appro- priate gestures, his lectures were very fas- cinating and interesting throughout......W now have seventeen street lamps on our principal streets, which we appreciate highly; but few more lamps on some dark corners would be very pleasant.

Charitable Institutions.",,"We invite special attention to an Item OF
information that has been furnished us by
an eminent legal friend. We are informed
that the city authorities have, in violation
of all law and all deceucy, published as a
defaulter for taxes every charitable and re-
ligious institution in this city; that further
more their proper law officer, viz the city
attorney, or assistant attorney, has taken
defaults in all such cases, and that he has
gone SO far as to confirm those defaults into
actual Judgments for 30 much money.


These are what may perhaps be properly
called snap iudgments, because if the par
ties in charge of these interests had been
notified they certainly would have filed
defences, and, as certainly defeated the
jealous efforts of these learned gentlemen.
The Judgments could not have been obtain
ed if the public had known anything about
the job.


But there is very little use in now dis
cussing the manner of the wrong doing;
the question is, what, if any, is the remedy
We will remark that these scandalous judg-
is cannot be signed for several days to
come, and consequently new trials can be
applied for. Indeed, we are satisfied that
Judge Lynch will, if the matter be brought
to his attention, refuse to sign any such
judgments until ample time shall have been
given every body to apply for justice. By
fiction of law the publication Of de-
faulters' list is supposed to be citation Of
every person, individual or corporate,
therein named, but in point of fact when
certain establishments know themselves to
be exempt by law from taxation, they never
dream of looking in the list for their names,
and consequently Judgment against them
is virtually one without notice."

The American, gives the following report of the affair:

 On Monday Dupont got drunk and wandered over to where A l & G s Chat fields masons are erecting the new brick depot for the Naugatuck road. The ma- sons recognized Dupont's condition and shouted to him to Pull down his vest"" tossing down fecks of mortar upon him from theic higher position on the wall: it is also said they flung down pail of water upon him. Dupont was naturally enraged, and when one of the masons, Jerry Mclaughlin (said to hail from Westport) came down, he threatened to pick a drunken row with him, but went away after a slight encounter. Soon he returned and Mclaughlin told him to go away, and as he did not comply he hit at him with the spirit level the plumb at. tached to it striking him over the temple and fracturing his skull. This was to- wards night on Monday. and Dupont was laid on some bagging in the Naugatuck freight depot where he remained all night without attention, the presumption prob ably being that he was only dead drunk. The next morning, however, it was appar- ent that Dupont was soon to die, and some of the officials of the Naugatuck road sent for a doctor; but it was too late for Dupont died about noon Tuesday. That afternoon Mclaughlin was arrested and brought before three grand jurors for trial, who heard some evidence and concluded that he acted in self defence; he was discharged, and this Wednesday, morning came to this city, many citizens believing that he would have been lynched had he remained in Winsted. The people of Winsted were naturally much dissatisfied with the way in which Mclaughlin was let go. A corners jury vas summoned, the case was more thoroughly investigated. and itappsared very plainly that Mclaughlin was mot at al, justified in his harsh treatment of the deceased; that he inflicted the mortal blow in mere wantonness; and that his conduct after Dupont's death showed him hardened brute. The coroners jury found that Dupont came to his death from wounds inflicted by Mclaughlin and warrant is out for his arrest, but it is supposed that he has fled the state. There is much indignation at the bung- ling manner in which the case was man. aged by the authorities. Nobody wants the murderer lynched, but that he should be allowed to escape without a thorough legal investigation is justly held dis grace."

and lay our heads on soft pillow SOM
cold winters night, it sometimes seem'
as if nothing but luxurious couch o
this sort could be worth calling bed
Yet large part Of the world enjoy nc
such arrangement for sleeping and
could not enjoy it if they had it. Ou'
own ancestors reposed in much less
luxurious fashion. In Eastern ceun.
tries people commonly spread net on
the fat roof of. their house, and make
that their bed. In Russia the top Of
the stove is the bedstead. In both
cases the sleepers do not undress them
selves.


In ancient Egypt-as still in China
aud Japan-wooden pillows we're in
vogue, followed out to fit the shape Of
the head. But the ancient Egyptians,
while, on account of the heat and ver-
min, they preferred hard pillows, are
said to have considered their comfort at
night in the invention of spring mat
resses These we're made of strips Of
bamboo crossed over each other, and
must have been as cool, if not quite as
soft and yielding, as the webbing Of
twiue stretched over frame, on which
the natives of India rest.


The lsraelites used sheep and goat
skins stuffed for pillows. and in early
times same for bedding; but their bed
steads. at later period, at least. must
have been very costly. The prophet
Amos speaks Of couches Of ivory.


Among the Assyrians. and afterwards
among the Romans, couches Of gold and
silver we're possessed by the rich. The
reason for this spleudor was partly that
the beds we're not kept in separate
rooms, but in the same room by day.
and were used for sitting on, and re-
clining at meals. At Roman feasts the
guests all reclined, and sometimes each
person occupied separate couch.


The Anglo Saxon ancestors we're not
at all refined in their sleeping arrange
ments. Their beds consisted Of wood
en- boxes. filled with bag of straw
In an old illustrated manuscript there
is picture Of king going to bed =
He has crown on bis head ""a very
uncomfortable night cap) but has no
night dress.


King Henry VIII. of England, is
said to have slept upon straw bed.
while his servants lay upon the rushes
strewn on the floor of the royal kitchen.
The Kings bed was not what we should
call luxurious; but so much ceremony
was used in going to it that seven cham
berlains were employed in undressing
the royal parsonage, turning down the
bed clothes. etc etc. One indispen-
sable practice was to thrust sword
into the straw to see that no person was
concealed in it


When feather beds came into use in
England they were regarded as articles
Of great value, and it seems comical to
US to find them so often mentioned in
wills. The person to whom feather
bed was bequeatbed did not usually re-
ceive anything else; his comfort BY
night was provided for. if not his vel
fare by day.


It may be mentioned in connection
With beds, that strange superstition
was once common in the south of Eng.
land. in belief that person cannot
die while lying on pigeons feathers. A
dying person has often been removed
from feather bed to the bare floor.
under the notion that the death strug.
gle vas. prolonged. owing to the pre-
sence in the bed of few pigeon feath-
ers. In England it is still customary
to surround the bed with curtains. -
Americans have adopted the more SEN
sible French fashion of allowing q free
circulation Of air about the sleeper.

The following letter, dated October 81,
1875, from Claiborne county, Mississippi,
from former slave there to his fellow former
slave now living here. will show the modus
operdndi of the peaceful election about to
take place in that State. 1t is believed to
be specimen of the purpose Of the ex-
rebels throughout the whole South, which
they will accomplish tomorrow:


Mr.. Dear Sir: / now take the pleas
ure of writing you few lines to inform you of
my health. / am well at the present time,
thanks be to God. We are all very anxious
to hear from you, and also to hear how
you arc getting along up there. Times
are very hard here. The whole county is in
an uproar. The Democrats are Just carrying
everything Just as they please, and are all
armed, just ready for fighting, and say that
they are going to carry this Presidential cleo
tion If they have to fight for it. Rev. John r.
Lynch, from Congress, came down on the 10th
Of October to make q speech for US, and the
Democrats would not let him speak. We
came very near having q big fight about 1t.
Please to write soon, and let us hear from you
all. The letter closes with some personal mat
ters Of no public INTEREST,"" r. W.


The full name is withheld from prudsn-
tial considerations. But it is genuine let.
ter from one colored man to another.
Those two men were once fellow slaves Of
the same master, and knew each other
well. What the letter states so simply and
briefly spoke volume for the truth Of the
outrsges of rebel Democrats all through
the South. There can be no doubt that
this solid South"" will give the vote Of its
States to Tilden eff they have to fight for
it."" Intimidation, threats. violence and
b,oodshed will follow if the negroes at
tempt to vote for Hayes.


If this vote of sfhe solid South"" 80 se-
cured, elects Tilden, we may as well give
up the contest, call the war for the Union
failure, and submit our necks, white and
black, to the yoke of the Southern rebels."

 Man Shot.",,"CINCINNATI, Nov. 4.-The dem ocratic clubs of this city had a final demonstration tonight. There was great deal of bad feeling displayed by crowds on the sidewalk. It is stated that several boulders were thrown into the ranks, injuring some men in the procession. One man was shot by negro, who was prompt ly arrested by the police and hur- ried off to the station house, fol lowed by a large crowd, with threats of lynching him. No alarm was turned on, and crowd of several thousand men collected around the station house. Mayor Johnson addressed the crowd, advising them to leave the pris- oner in the hands of the officers, which had a quieting effect. At a late hour the crowd dispersed."

afternoon with the Louisiana delegation


to the st. Louis convention.


The matter OF the Injunction prayed
for by the city against the private mar
ket men was to have came up yester-
day before Judge Lynch, but the time
OF the court was occupied by a jury case
during the entire day, and the market
case went over.


In this connection it may be said on
the authority OF Mr.. Piisbury that there
is due for licenses by the private market
men over ten thousand dollars. The
delinquents, If such they may be called,
are OF that class OF private market men
whose establishments Is are within twelve
blocks OF any public market"" (which
is prohibited By the law now being
endeavOr to collect these licenses with
out recognizing the right OF these mar
ket men TO establish themselves
wherever they please. On the other
hand, all efforts have heretofore failed
to enforce the law providing for remov-
Ing the private markets twelve blocks
from any public market.


Regarding the sale Of the revenues Of
the public markets, the bids for which
will be opened at 10 o'clock on the 9th
little time is afforded to the purchaser
to complete his arrangements between
the date OF the acceptance OF his bid
and the first OF June, the day on which
he i5 expected to take possession OF the
markets. The complaining persons ask
for modification OF the ordinance
in order that more time shall
be allowed the purchaser to sign the
contract and arrange for the collection
OF rents, etc. The difficulty, however,
that offers itself is, that to comply with
their request would entai! delay Of an
entire month in the sale OF the revenues,
under the published ordinance, and the
annoyance Of selling the revenues for
the month Of June alone, whilst it is
deemed urgent by the city administra-
ton that the sale on the three or five
year plan shall be proceeded with at
once.


In the committee of the whole, held
yesterday, the wharf lease question. was
not touched upon, as was expected, and
nothing will be done until Monday, at
the earliest, when the Injunction asked
for by Nj. Michael Carvin, to prohibit
the city from making any reduction in
the wharf dues, comes up in the Supe-
rior District Court. Should the injunc-
ton be refused, there will be
three or more plans brought be-
fore the committee to settle the
question Of the Ellerman lease among
them one by Mr.. Pilsbury, which will
propose to- resell the contract with an
extension OF two or three years, condi-
toned that the wharfage dues will be
reduced; another by Mr.. Burke. Mr.
Burke's proposition is that the city shall
cancel the Ellerman contract and reas-
sumo its obligations to the wharf bond
holders. Mr.. Burke's plan also in
cludes the filing up OF considerable
aren of che batture above Canal street,
thereby reciaiming valuable property,
materially improve the city treasury."

PoRTs-A BATTLE OF AFFIDAvITs COMING.
[FRoM A STAFF CORRESPONDENT OF THE TRIBUHE.I


NEw-ORLEANs, Nov. 1s.-It is pretty we'll settled,
or will be before this letter reaches NewYork, that
the Democrats polled majority of all the votes
actually found in the ballot boxes in this State on
the 9TH of November. If those votes were all
legally cast rather, if there was fair and free
election throughout the State, then Gov. Tlden is
entitled to receive the electoral vote of louisiana
and to be inaugurated as President This is the
question which the Returning Board exercising ju
dical powers under the laws of this State. is to de-
termine. The Republicans say that in many in
stances the election not free one, and in proof
of the assertion point to the fact that in of the
parishes Of the State, where the negroes consd
erably more numerous than the white people, and
where at former elections the Republicans had large
maorities the returns now show Democratic majOri-
ties or large Republican losses. This. it is asserted,
is prma facie evidence that improper means were
resored to- since it is assumed that the negroes if
left to themselves and uninfuenced by fear, would
always vote the Republican ticket. Southern Re-
publican politician if called upon to state his theory
automatically, might put it in this form: II ""a""
represents the number Of coloredyoters in given
State, ""b"" the number of white Republicans and
""cp the white Democrats, then a"" plus "" bD minus
&C"" will be equal to the majority which the Repub-
licans ought to have in any election in that State.
II the majority is reduced below this figure if the
Democrats succeed then it is held that there must
have been fraud, that the negro voters were In
tmidsted


shall not in this letter discuss this method Of
reasoning, but will simply say that while unex-
pected results in any election may furnish grounds
for suspicion. and make investigation desirable.
vvhi 10
to base any positive conclusions. In the present
crisis in the political affairs of Louisiana and of the
whole country, the people will demand on the one
hand that all the facts bearing on the election in
parishes which have been revoutionized shall be
made known and full explanation Of the change
shall be given and the other that no action shall
be taken which will affect the final result IN this
State unless il is based on the satisfactory and
conclusive evidence.


One Of the most important questions which is sure
TO arise during the discussion of the Louisiana ques
ton viii be in regard 10 the exact character of the
intimidation which will vitiate the election in
parish or voting preciuct. A Republican of national
reputation who has resided in NewOrleans since the
close of the war told me the other day that in GER
tain portions of this State il is impossible for white
Republican OF a black Democrat to live, except IN
the large towns He did not say that men who





Louisiana would certainly be murdered but he meant
that they would live in such constant fear, hated
and avoided by those of their own race with whom
they came in daily contact that of two courses
only would be left for them to pursue-ether to quit
the country or yield the pressure and go with the
tide of public opinion. This assertion was made to
prove to me the absurdity Of the Democratic claim
that negroes had voted for Tlden and Nichols in the
last election.


Now in n parish where such a state Of things rs
this gentleman described exists is plain that free
election Is impossible. No violence may be used, no
unlawful means rcsOrted TO to influence the ndivid-
ual voter either election day or at any time dur
ing the campaign which precedes II, and yet the
very essence Of free election, the deliberate choice
Of the elector may be wanting on both sides. This
ia a kind of intimidation not less dcplorable than
Others but one which il seems TO me impossible for
any election law to reach IL is the result of All in
berent defect i'm the constitution of society where il
evists and il is extremely difficult to say how that
defect shall be cured. l don't suppose any one
wonld pretond that the returns of the election IL
parish where this state of affairs Is known to exist
ought to be rejected by the Returning Board IN the
absence of direct evidence of violence or threats
and am sure that no public opinion in the North
would sustain the rejection of the returns OF su'h
parish without conclusive evidence of that kind


Another kind OF intimidation WHICH thp htPloH- |
cans of this State assert has cost them thousands OF
votes can hardly be brought within the scope OF the
election laws. can best describe it by giving an
cvomnle. 81. Landry Parish has been carried by |
tbe Democrats at every election, | believe, SINCE
1868 until this year. Now it has beyond dispute |
gone for HAYES and Packard. The explanation |
which the Republicans give of this change is as fol-
lows; They say that in St. Landry Parish there |
yvos n horrible massacre of blacks in 1868 which |
struck terror 70 the hearts of the negroes, and |
the memory Of il has prevented many of them from
voting at every subsequent election In other |
words. the colored people, being by nature easily |
frightened and remaining longer under the IN |
Aucnce of fear than white men, have actually been |
kent away from the polls for six or eight years |
through intimidation, the cause OF which may not |
have been repeated Although 1t Is greatly 10 DE
regretted that such condition OF affairs rs this can
exist in any free country, don't believe the eiec-
ton laws Of this State cover such case' OF 'h't
they ought TO do So At the same time, as we Drihg
the scenes of violence nearer and nearer 10 Tue |
election IL may he that the very delicate question
will arise as to how recent act of violence must
be in order to make it vitiate an election.
II negro from Grant Parish swears that he dared

1876, because he remembered the slaughter Oh he-

Girls.


indianapolis Special to Courier.J Journal.[


This morning, while two young girls,
daughters of William Hunter and Captain
Clinton, Of Warren township, Ind, were
walking the Junction Railway, on their
way to the township school, they were
attacked by negro, who sprang over the
fence armed with q club, and accosted
them with the remark: ""By God, have
got one of you"" Miss Clinton was the
first to apprehend danger and ran; but
Miss Hunter, who is less than sixteen
years of age, was knocked down by the
brutal scoundrel and dragged into the
field adjoining the railway. where, despite
the resistance of the unfortunate girl, but
for the quick coming Of help, he would
have accomplished his horrible purpose.
As soon as the settlement heard Of the
outrage there was general, vigorous
search of the woods, and had the rascal
been caught limb of the nearest tree
would have stretched his neck. Word
was brought to the police station not long
after the occurrence, aud late in the even
ing the negro was arrested by Donovan
and Lynch, of the old police force, and
brought to this city and lodged In jail.
His name Is the Rev. John. H. James, of
Danville, and h, had been imported here
by the Radicals to manipulate the ne
groes to fraud upon the ballot-box in
October."

that the prisoner is not Raston, while the fourth

 village was held at Academy Hall last Sat urday, evening to organize village inn provement association, with MT. John A. McArthur izsthe chair. MT. M l.. Graham ! read the report of the commissioners of education recommending the formation of associations for village improvement, after which constitution and bylaws for the government of the society were presented by committee appointed for the purpose, and adopted. The organization is to be called the Salisbury Village Improvement Association. The following is list of officers elected for the ensuing year: Mir. M. l.. Graham, president; Mrs. J. L. Pease, D. T. Warner Esq. and Mrs. M. c. Jewell, vlce-presidents; J. l. Pease, secretary Henry Hubbard, treasurer; Mrs. Henry Hubbard and Miss Grace Warner, collect ors.

 An executive committee of nine was ap- pointed as follows: John A. McArthur, Mrs. Silas B. Moore, Martin Harris, Miss Katie Glens, c. H. Glens, R. H. Ball, John P. Walton, George Bower and Hinsdale Dexter. It was thought wise to put the in- itiation fee for members at a low figure, and the sum of twenty-five cents was agreed upon, with monthly dues of twenty-five cents. Thirty-four gave in their names and became members last Saturday evening. It is exceedingly gratifying that so much in terest was developed at this meeting, and it is to be hoped the organization will be a permanent one. There is no reason why our sidewalks cannot be kept iu good con- dition, trees planted, the street lamps trimmed and burning and everything de- gently and in order, and what has seemed most needful to bring about this desirable state of affails was organized effort. This is now accomplished, and we shall look, act, feel and be better

 The Dedication.-On Thursday after noon, the 27th day of last May, the cere- mony of laying the corner stone for the new Catholic church in Lakeville was sol emnized. At that time the walls for the

 foundation of the structure were erected,

 but little else was done in the progress of

 the work, and now the church edifce is completed, and was dedicated to the wor-

 ship of Almighty God last Sabbath. The

 external appearance of the structure is very

 imposing, standing, as it does, on an emi-

 hence that commands an extended view of

 the surrounding country.

 The interior is not as elaborately finished

 as some of the city churches, but has neat

 solid and substantial appearance yet no,

 so plain as to look cheap, but instead, to 8

 Protestant's eye, is a thousand fold more

 rich and beautiful than those SO highly or

 namented. The chandeliers, brackets and

 the decorations about the altar and chancel are in very good taste.

 The train from Winstcd, bringing people

 to the dedication, arrived about half-past ten o'clock in the forenoon. Among the

 passengers was the St. Francis Temperance , Society of Winsted, about 35 men, which

 was received at Lakeville by the St. Mary's of the Lake Temperance organization oi

 that village, when procession was formed which marched to the church. The best ot

 order was maintained; not syllable o loud talk being uttered by any, but all pro ceeded with dignity and decorum, ant

 nothing occurred to disturb in the slightes

 degree the sanctity of the day. Soon aftel the arrival of the procession the eigh priests who took part in the ceremonies o the dedication, marched in procession around the church, blessing the exte1io

 walls with holy water and chanting thu

 psalm Wiserere, after which they proceed . ed in similar manner to bless the interio

 walls. The altar was then blessed, the Ger

 emony of which was accompanied by thu

 litany or invocation of the saints, and thu burning of incense.

 The priests who took part in the exerci ses were as follows; The Rev. Luke Dal, of New Britain, who performed the cere mony of dedication, delegated by the Yer, Rev. James Hughes, administrator of tn, diocese. He was assisted by Rev. Charle

 Lynch of North Adams, Mass; Rev. Eu gene Gaffeny, Thomaston Rev. Richar' o. German, Waterbury Key. P. P. Law Ter. New London Rev. Freuquellino, O , s. F., Winsted; Father Glackymere, (Jes uiD New York city, and Rev. J. H. Lynch the pastor. After the ceremony of dedics tion, high mass was celebrated with tn

 Rev. Eugene GaffenY as celebrant and Rev - Charles LI nch, deacon, and Rev. P. r a LaWler, sub-deacon and Rev. Richard U German, master of ceremonies. After th gospel of the mass, a sermon was preache by the Jesuit father, who took his text i e Matt. xviii, verses l9 and 20. To giv II even synopsis of this sermon we cannot but will add word. He in degree e1 IS planed the ceremonies just completed al T added shade of defense of them. Ever, q thing, said he, Tn the church should be COT secrated, and ceremony is necessary to col

 secration. In our secular life many thing e are consecratcd, said he, the ring worn b

 the sainted mother is lost. A fabulous r o ward is offered for its recovery, rewar ta thousand fold greater in intrinsic valu than the ring, but it is made sacred by i ,t being long time worn by the mother, an is prized above rubies; therefore, bless th ,r church and every part of it and consecra d it,and it will be always precious to the pe l. pie. He exhorted them to be generou ,tt 'If,"" he added, ''the money spent at tho. m other places, where something overflow Id the bowl or glass, was given, Father Lyme Id would have no trouble to pay the deb. ,e the church at once.""

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7.-Representative Lynch
OF Mississippi has prepared n statement showing the
methods adopted deraud him OF his reelection last
Fall The district Il known the Shoesring DsIict
from great length and slight width IL Ia arfanged To
take In all the heavy negro counties In tho state with
the view Of making ii the only sure Republican district
After the complete success OF the plan OF terrifying the
state In 1872 the Democrats under Gen Chalmers deter
mined to this district also from the Republicans


Although the majority nearly $4,000 they accom-
plishcd this without rcsorng to much Violence lnth-
dation was connued chiefly TO two counties Claiborne
and Jefferson where no Republican clubs were allowed
10 les Organized I'm Claiborne County Mr.. Lynch was
informed he must hold no meetings there. The Demo
cratic frauds began with the registration In CiaDorhe
County over 900 Republic an voters we're denied the
right to register the whites registering first and the re-
madcr OF the time allowed by law being consumed IN
putting nonsonscal and unauthorized questions TO the
coored voter. 20 that only small part OF them were
a. 10 get their names the list In Warren County
the board of registry made Affirmative answers to queS-
ous not authorized by law as condition OF regstra
tou and In this manner dsenfrnnchised about 3,OOO
Republican voters. On election day frauds oil the most
outrageous character were pracuced hJstemauchiS
throughout the district In Mr. Lynch's own county
Adams-a change of over 200 votes was made In one
parish by taking Republican ballots out OF the boxes
I'm Mr. Lynch's own precinct he watched the e'ec-





ton carefully himself, and up TO O'clock when
tho election officers took recess for dinner
361 votes had been poed OF which number the hepuo-
cans had over 800 After dinner ls6 votes were poeu
80 Of which were Republican, but when the votes were
counted out at sht only 80 Republican votes
in the box the number after dinner showing clearly
that the officers when they went TO dinner took out all
the Republican votes and put Democratic votes III 'noH
stead This is specimen Of many frauds oil similar
kind Of which Mr.. Lynch has evidence


In Issaquena County at every precinct except one tho
took out Republican votes and put their own
marty tickets in In their stead In Wilkinson County not
only were tho same tactics employed but armed oo's
OF men went 10 the residences Of leading RepnbcanS on


o rcbt nreccding the election and demanded and OBJ
tanned tho Republican tickets aud destroyer tiJi % ~
that rho nc Xt day In many precincts. not u sihSI ~

Race difficulties became frequent in Edgefed. At

two whites were seized by an armed band of white
men, evidently well organized, and shot. They Were
made 10 face the force and every man, at the Woru

their bodies. The affair stirred upmuch bad bioou

knew 1t to be useless, offered reward for the appre

They caught at the chance. Country papers were

Two strange men, pretending to be sailors,
went to Milford last week and peddled some
kind of cordnroy-looking fabric, which
they represented to be an excellent English
cloth. This they sold in pants and vest pat
terms. They asked from 81 to Sl2 pattern,
but on q pinch would sell for So or So. They
pretended that the goods were smuggled and
a few greenies bit the hook thus baited, and
bought at The higher figures. The fabric was
iu fact nothing more than Canton flannel,
fixed by dyes and starch SO as to really look
like valuable goods.-Smyrna Times.


week or two ago, two men, presumably
the same parties as these Milford peddlers,
sold quantity Of the same kind Of material
which they styled ""English Corduroy to
some gentlemen in this vicinity, who proved
themselves ''greenies'' by thus allowing
themselves to be gulled by knavish traders Of
whom they knew no more than they did Of
their goods.

SIR: My attention has been attracted
to the following extraordinary statements
which appear in the editorial columns of
your paper this morning, made by Sena-
tor West, of Louisiana, in reply to Sena-
tor Bayard, of Delaware, while discus
sing the origin and authors of the lawless-
ness and crimes in the Feliciana par
ishes:


desire to state right here that it was
matter Of impossibility, almost, to get a
Among those that the Governor was con
sidering, We recommend Powers OF two
evils we chose the least.


These statements of Senator West are ut
terly false. The man who was removed
from the position of Tax Collsctor in Or
der that the midnight assassin Powers
should receive his promised reward from
Governor Kellogg, was James De Gray,
an uncompromising Republican, but a
man of such sterling integrity and high
character that Immediately upon his ap-
lpointment being made known to Clinton,
East Feliciana, his bond, amounting to
nearly 10000, was made by Democrats,
to prove that politics had nothing what
ever to do with the troubles in the par
ish, and that when Governor Kellogg ap-
pointed honest men the citizens would
support him IN the performance of his
duties.


Will Senator West answer the follow
ing questions:


Did not the Republicans of East Fell
ciana elect as Sheriff a negro who could
neither read nor write, and of such vile
character that even Republicans refused
to sign his bond, and Governor Kellogg
was compelled to remove him?


Did not ex-Mayor Chase, of Clinton
Colonel Isaac Packwood, Captain Mona.
han, the present Sheriff; II. A. Cross, g
Democratic Presidential elector at the
last election, and many other prominent
and influential Democrats protest against
the appointment Of Powers and accuse
him of being the instigator of all the dis
turbances in that parish?


Was it not notorious among Republi
cans in New Orleans that Powers wa!
the leader and in command of the masked
murderers who lynched John Gair AM
hung his sister-in-law, Babe Mathews.


Did not Ray, the colored representativ,
from that parish, denounce Powers pub
, licly as the author of that crime; ant
, was he not compelled to leave the parisl
in consequence, remaining for month
in New Orleans?


Did not Governor kellogg reques
! Powers to appoint Mr.. De Gray hi
}deputy, and did he not do so? Is thi
Iwhat Senator West calls ''choosing tn,
worst of two evils""


Frank Powers received the reward O
his ruffianism, and his conduct and char
acter sufficiently prove the purposes 70

Gray removed.

Mr.. Frye yesterday offered resolution ask
ing for the appo intment of q committee of six
to proceed South at once for the purpose of
investigating the recent election frauds in the
Fourth ALABAMA district: and the Sixth district
of Mississippi. The Democrats voted solidly
against the resolution. Several attempts
have been made to secure an Investigation of
the frauds in Mississippi, but every time they
have been thwarted by 8 united vote Of the
Democratic party in the House. Conscious of
the palpable and infamous outrages commit
ted by their party friends in that State the
Democracy in the House dare not have the
mask torn from these iniquities and exposed
to the view of free and liberty loving people.
The Sixth district Of Mississippi, now repre-
resented by Mr.. Lynch, was, without doubt,
the most thoroughly bull-dozed district in the
South. In Warren, one of the counties COM
posing the district, not less than three thou
sand out of five thousand Republican voters
we're denied the right to register and
consequently the right 10 vote. In Claiborne
county not more than 200 out of about 2, 500
colored voters were allowed to register. Thus
1t will be seen that over 1000 Republican
NOAG4 III lutec INO COuu-
ties alone. The reign of terror in Claiborne
and Jefferson counties was complete. The
Democracy in each county was an armed mill
tary organization, and they allowed no Repub-
lican meetings to be held nor speeches to be
made. In these counties, Notwithstanding
the disfranchisemeut of 1900 Republican
voters, Mr.. Lynch received majority of from
5000 to 5000 votes, but this was overcome by
systematic frauds and swindling practicei in
every county in the district. By this outrage
upon the elective franchise of free people
Republican majority of 10000 in the Sixth
district of Mississippi was overcome, and
Democrat pronounced elected by over 4, 900.
The Democrats in the House know this to be
a fact, and are willing to screen the outrage.
Their action yesterday bears us out in the as
sertion, and proves that Mr.. Tilden's reform
ers are not the reformres of wrong and infamy,
but rather the aiders and abettors of crime
and lawles sness."

connection with politics than the lynching OF a
bOrse-thef in Indiana But when the lion OF lynch

eases politics was tho melting cause Of midnight
visits Even if this was not so staple request by
a white nan, when TO threat was made would no
doubt have all the effect of Inenacing language. IL
is very easy TO see how this would be in COM
munrty so disorganized us certain districts in
Louisiana are admitted to have been. For instance,
q white man asks joe one OF his coloTed field hands,
TO join a Democratic club Joe, knowing that If he
does he will be ostracized by the people of his
color, turned out of the church, perhaps disowned
by his wife. refuses TO do well"" replies the
white man, ""you may do as you please, but If you
vote the Radical ticket you viii have TO take care
of yourself / cart take care of any Niger who
goes against my interests"" Now, no threat has
been uttered in this case yet it is very likely that
visions of midnight visits from bulldozers will rise
in the mind of the negro and determine his action
while perhaps, the white man has no Thought OF
molesting him. i have no doubt that there were
hundreds of cases of intimidation of this kind-acts
which in themselves were entirely innocent, and
which in peaeeable community would have been
wholly without effect, but which in the bulldozcd
parishes Of Louisiana did affect the vote.


The Democratic majority in the five parishes of
East and West Feliciaaa, Ouachita, East Baton
Rouge, and MorehOuse, as returned this year, was
about $500; the same parishes gave the Repubii-
cans about the same majority two years ago; that
the change Of majority them alone was just about
sufficient to account for the Democratic majority
which appeared on the face of the returns Was
this change entirely effected by the means of which
have been speakings j think not The evidence
that the white people in several of the parishes
made special effort TO draw the negro vote to tho
Democratic party just conclusive as that OF IN
timidation. Two years ago the :"" white line poncy,
was the distinguishing feature of the canvass; this
year il was everywhere formally abandoned. Two
years ago the negroes were repeled and given to u-
derstand that their alliance was not wanted, and
that they need expect no political recognition II the
Democrats succeeded; this year they were welcomed
to the Democratic clubs, on an equal footing with
white members, and barbecues and entertainments
were prepared for their benefit. Every effort was
also made to make those who joined feel secure;
each one cot showing which not only secured
him from molestation by white people, but insured





been accustomed to enjoy. Whatever the coloSd
people priced highest was most freely promised
them They want schools, but through the incf1i-
cheney or dishonesty Of the Republican parish Of
fcials much Of the school fund has been lest or
stolen. The Democrats promised more school money
and longer terms. They promised better wages
better prices for the crops and cheaper meat ana
cOrn and they promised TO protect and defend all
the political and social rights which the coloed
people now eEjoy. Arguments like these had their
effect, and won many votes.


Some of the Republicans from the North, who
during their stay here made the most thorough in
vestigation which their opportunities allowed, ad-
mitted in private conversation they msS have done
il in their report to the President, which have not
vet secnl that negro votes were gained by the
Democrats through legitimate means, but they also
held that intimidation having been proved, that
vitiated the whole election in the locality where il
occurred. One Of them Illustrated his position by
quoting the familiar rule Of law that if person
wlfully mixes his property with that of another in
such a way that it cannot be distinguished, the
latter may claim the whole; so he said when PARTY
taints its honest vote with fraud that the honest
part cannot be distinguished from the dishonest
part then that party can rghtfuly claim the benefit
OF none of il.


Another question which ia 10 arise in the fu-
ture discussion Of the Louisiana question is the rela
tive responsibility of the two political parties for the
condition of affairs which has existed in the budOzcd
parishes during the past year. The bulldOzers
themselves have uHquestionably been Democrats in
most instances | say in most instances, because
believe that there have been feW.eases III which
Democratic coloTed men have been bulldozed by
Republicans of their color. But the white pe0-
plc saw that the organization of regulators became

uept 10 afford protection either to life property,
and esnceiaIly to the latter. This is undoubtedly
true. Il is not necessary that should describe the
Government or want of government OF this State
for the last four years. 1t is fatally defective and
un-American in at least one particular the power
procoels from the Executive and not from the peo-
nile and when the Executive holds his place against
the will and consent of the people and besides lacks
the ability TO make his will respected, his local rep
reseutatiyes i'm the parishes worse than power
less But there has been too often want OF dis
position to enforce wholesome laws. In no state
have pa1dons been cheap or as frequent as horc.
Mr.. Nordhof, in his book on the South written
two years ago, gave some very striking details Oh
the number of paTdons granted by Gov Kellogg,
and believe the policy has not been changed since
that time. Tie Democrats tell n story, the truth
of which will not v9uch for, or a politician tIled
for some crime, mur0cr, believe, VINO, wheh the
iudge pronounced sentence, walked up TO the bench
and handed mp his pardon, which had been pre-
pared in advance Tho most natural result OF
such state Of affairs as thls Is
that the people will take the law
into their own hands and anarchy follows Inns ID
last what happened in the buildozed parishes Ihe
courts utterly failed to punish crime and the parish
officers 60 arrest criminals and the regulators in

 ""Mr. Thos. A. Boyd, late editor of the State Grange, at Little Rock, died of consumption at the residence of Mrs. Washington, near this city, on ""Wednesday evening last. The deceased had but recently come to our county with the hope Of restoring his health. He was tenderly cared for throughout his illness by an afiectionate brother and sympa- lhizing friends. He was buried at Evergreen Cemetery in this city, by Rieff's Chapel Grange, with the honors of the Order. Funeral services were conducted by Rev. s. A. Mason, of the M. E. Church south.

 The deceased was son Of the late James NJ. Boyd, of Lynch burgh, Va, and had only resided in our state for a few years. He was young man of excellent mind for one of his years, of broad and liberal views, and as editor of the Weekly Grange, did much to advance the interests of the people of his adopted country.

 He was favorite with all who knew him, and many will be the tears shed when it is known that Thos. A. Boyd is no more. We deeply sympathize with Capt. E. D. Boyd in his sad afiliction, yet we are glad to know that, altho' in land among strangers, he has received every attention and as sistance that our kind hearted cit izens should render. We learn from Capt. Boyd that he will soon remove the remains of his brother to their old home in Virginia."

counts to bring successive suits upon them by
creditors.


The bill to close up the affairs of the Land
Office was read twice and assigned for Thurs.

The bill authorizing the Camden Village cor
poration to build hall was assigned for We'd
nesday afternoon.


Mr.. Cleaves of Portland called up the bill to
repeal the act Of the last legislature declaring
that no disabled soldiers of the late war shall
be deprived of the right of suffrage by reason
of having received aid from the town in which
he lives. Mr.. Cleaves moved to reconsider and
called attention to the law it proposed to re-
peal. Mr.. Powers of Houlton explained the
action of the Judiciary Committee on the bill.
They were required to examine into the consti.
tutionality of the present law, and after exam.
ination were clearly of the mind that it is ua-
constitutional aud conflicts with the pauper
laws. Mr.. Powers said he would gladly vote
for constitutional amendment conferr ing up
on the veterans of the late war the right of suf-
frage in all vicssitudes; he was not in favor of





in very forcible manner. He said that good
lawyers in the last legislature reported ths bill
which is now law. Why did they not detect
its defect at that time? Why does this Legis-


lature assume the prerogative of the judiciary
department of the government by declaring an
act of other legislatures unconstitutional? Let
the courts decide the matter Let the coun-
try's MANNED veteran, now dependent upon
charity because he was stout hearted and true
in the hour of the nations dire necessity, have
his day in court. 1t was said that the school
mill tax was unconstitutional by our best law
yers, but the Justices of the Supreme Court
find otherwise. In the light of this experience,
let US not go on and assume powers belonging
to other departments of the government. He
also referred to the act of 1864 granting aid to
the families of soldiers in the field, which also
contained declaration that receiving such aid
should not render the recipient a pauper. Mr..
Talbot of Machias favored repeal 1t was un-
constitutional Ho would have the constitu-
tion so changed as not to deprive poor persons
of suffrage but those who had committed infa-
nous crimes. Mr.. Bass favored indefinite
postponement, but while he was speaking the
hour arrived which had been assigned for the
capital punishment abolition bill, when the
matter was tabled.


The capital punishment measure, reported
| by part Of the Judiciary Committee, was TAX
| en- up, the pending bill being that prepared by
| Mr.. Frank of Portland. An arrangement for
| division of the time, made, and Mr.. Pow
| ers gave his first half hour to Mr. Fr,nk, who
| spoke against the death penalty with much
] earnestness and effect. He showed conclusive
/ ly by reports from several states and foreign
countries and the events in our own state that
the argument OF the necessity of the gallows""
is grOundless. Mr.. Eastman of Saco defended
the death penalty. He urged that the death
penalty is not prompted by desire for retrbu-
| tive justice; it was simply society protecting
itself. Mr.. Hobson advocated his amendment,
| which gives the jury the right to say whether
i the punishment for murder in the first degree
shall be death or Imprisonment for life. Mr..
Talbot opposed the amendment on the ground


that it is Unconstitutional. Mr.. Hussey of No.
Berwick opposed capital punishment on the


ground that it is in violation of the precepts of
/ the New Testament, which should be the basis
of all good laws. Mr. Pillsbury of Pennington
next spoke in favor of the bill, land was followed
| by Mr.. Floyd of Winthrop. Gen. Anderson
| then spoke against Mr.. Franks bill, He said
| that it was incumbent upon those opposed to
/ capital punishment to show that their proposed
| system is better than the present policy. Gen.
Anderson explained the law as it now is. He
| then proceeded to show that the murder record
| in Maine, as given by Mr.. Frank, is incorrect.


He then gave the action of the opponents of
capital punishment in the Thorne case. He


then considered the question of the sacredness
| of human life. He said it was an instinct of
| mans nature to defend his life. Was it mur.
| der if, in the defense of life one takes the life


of another? Is it murder when society takes
| the life of a murderer in self-defense? He said


that great many men in his own party be-
lieved in the late war that the North was the
| aggressor. Whether or not that was the case


he did not propose to discuss. They so believed
| Yet they were drafted and sent to the war and


there killed men. Were they murderers? No,


they were simply obeying the laws and orders
| of those in power. Gen. Anderson alluded to
| the intelligence and progress of the 10Th centu-
| ry. He doubted whether the state was any


higher in its civilization than 100 years ago,
| taking into consideration the influx of foreign
| population in our cities. He doubted if the


laws were wiser than 100 years ago or the men


better. We have better schools, more learned
| men, more expensive system of government


more liberal culture, but he doubted if, as
| whole, the people are more conscientious more


observant Of the Sabbath and the old moralities
| or have higher and truer civilization than
| those who lived century ago. He next con-
| sidered the Bible argument and quoted the case


of Annanias. He said that this question
| should not be decided upon any appeal to SYM
| pathy. He closed his speech with an appeal to


let the law stand as protection to the weak,


which was greeted with applause. Mr.. Powers
| of Houlton defended the bill and opposed the


death penalty He examined the arguments of


the gentlemen on the other side AMI made


most effective speech The hour having arrived


for taking the vote, it was first put on the


Hobson amendment, which was lost, yeas 45,


nays 81. The vote was next taken on the Frank


bill abolishing capital punishment and resulted

THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.",,"THE CONSTITUTIONAL QUESTION.


Upon the points decided in a case in
Illinois, another in Michigan, and the
late case of People Us. Lynch, in our
Supreme Court, doubt has been
founded of the constitutionality of the
Act now under consideration, not
withstanding that the facts of those
cases have no resemblance to the pres
ent one, and that it is by no means
clear, that our Supreme Court has de-
cided any thing more than is expressed
in the first proposition of the opinion
of Chief Justice McKinstry, in accord
ance with Art. XI, Sec. IS Of our Con-
stitution, substantially, that a street
assessment, like any other tax, not
equal and uniform, is void. Judges
Wallace and Rhodes concur with
him, on this proposition, and no other.
Judges Crockett and Niles concur, in
silence as to the reasons; and properly
under the circumstances. can be held
only to the above stated proposition,
which was sufficient to reverse the de-
cision below in favor of the right of
unconstitutional assessment.


In his elaborate opinion, the Chief
Justice presents new theory of con-
stitutional construction, tending some-
what to limit the power of the Legis-
lature over the discretion of the Coun-
Gil of a city, in local legislation.
Granting that majority of the Court
so held-which is far from being cer-
tain-and that while the Council is
left to legislate on a particular subject,
the Legislature may not lagislate
within the city, on the same matter.
No such point can arise under he Act
creating this Board, which really does
not interfere with a discretion existing
over matters which the Council is
competent to act upon, but in fact,
takes away all discretion, and vests the
same in another class of city officers,
over certain branch of legislation.
By this disposition of the Legislature,
the municipal independence ESQ to
speak) is preserved intact; the corpo-
ration has lost none of its rights, even
if its local government may be little
more complicate or at first appear
somewhat strange and out Of the old
routine, or Gf you willy defective. 1t
will scarcely be held that the Supreme
Court has intended in People Us Lynch
to deny the power of the Legislature
absolutely to abrogate, or in its own
discretion, to amend and alter the
charter of municipal corporation.


The dissenting opinion of Judge
Rhodes, to the second and third pro-
positions of the Chief Justice, Is wor-
thy of attention, as showing what has
been the course of decision in this
State, and most probably reflects the
actual opinion of the majority of his
learned associates:


~ am unable to concur with Mr..
Justice McKinstry, in the conclusions
announced under the second and third
grounds discussed by him.


''Some of the positions laid down
by him might, perhaps, with pro-
priety, have been accepted and APP
piled at the commencement of the
Judicial history of the State, as sound
rules and meaning in the construc-
tion of our constitution, and others,
perhaps, are deserving of a place in
the instrument itself.n e


""But at an early day different con-
struction was adopted in respect to the
power which the Legislature might
exercise over municipal corporations,
and In respect 20 persons and property"
18_1876-05-03_p1_sn84038806_00280768972_1876050301_0429,Los Angeles daily herald.,01,1876-05-03,p1,,,"ton; and, in my judgment. that con


struction ought not to be changed, ex
cept upon more cogent reasons thar


are presented In this case.n


This case furnishes an elegant Tar
gumentn with which the best intellec


may occupy itself pleased and In.
structed: evidently it Is not to be
treated as final Judgment, to deter.
mine and govern all the political re-
Iations of municipalities toward the
State.


The only provisions Of the Constitu-
tion of this State, concerning incorpo-
rated cities, are the following:


Art. W., .9ec. 81. M ztls


I"" 1t shall he the duty of the Legis-
lature to provide for the organization
Of cities and Incorporated villages,
and TO restrict their powers of taxa
ton, assessment, borrowing money,
contracting debts, and loaning their
credit, SO as to prevent abuses in as
sessments and In contracting debts by
such municipal corporations""


Art. XII. Sec. 9.


Each county, town, city, and In
corporated village shall make provi-
sion for the support of its own officers,
subject to such restrictions and regu-
lations as the Legislature may pre-
scribe.


See Art. Nv. Sec. 80, ante p. II.


Otherwise that instrument is silent,
upon the particular forms of the mu-
nicipal governments, or the powers
that may be conferred upon their vari-
GUS officers. aa


These matters belong to the Legie-
lature to determine, as 1t may deem
best, according to the diversified in
terests and condition of each commu-
nifty. This proposition, in the same
or equivalent language, has always
been maintained in this State, by the
Courts. Justice Field (Blanding Va.
Burr, 13 CAL, 343, says:


|"" 1t is only for the convenient ad-
ministration of the Government that
the State is divided into 5 counties,
cities and towns. These political SUBJ
divisions are mere instrumentalities
with powers more or less enlarged,
according to the requirements Of the
public. These powers are subject to
be increased, restricted, or repealed,
at the will of the Legislature, accord
ing to the varying circumstances Of
the State""


Often the long enjoyment Of suc-
cess, even on the narrow theatre Of To-
cal politics, begets confidence that
treats office as species Of property
""a vested right.n An eminent Judge
has remarked:


""The proposition is an absurd one,
that political power conferred by the
Legislature can become q vested
right, as against the Government, in
any individual or body OF men,""
Nelson, J., People vs.. Morris, 13 Wend.
1885,.


""The powers conferred on muui-
cipal corporation are not III the ma
ture of a compact. They are subject
to repeal or modification, at the will
of the legislative powern Gases
cited l Brightley's Dig, p. 1876. Sec.
l07,) Dillon on Corporations ~, and
authorities there cited.


Although as early as the year 1850,
a general law of California essayed to
establish a uniform system of city
government, notifications of its es-
sential features became necessary in
all the cities, from time to time. This
has repeatedly happened to the city
of Los Angeles-through special Acts
lin the years 1851, 1852, 1854, 1856,
1859, 1852; again, in 1874; then again
by the ""Amended Charter"" Of the
present year.


By the Act creating this Board, we
have merely another change of the
municipal government, a re-distribu-
tion of that aggregate authority which
the State has been willing to delegate
to the corporation, over its citizens
and their property; this to be exer-
cised through two distinct elective
organizations of officers, in their rela-
tions each so far independent of the
other and so limited within its own
province, that one cannot usurp the
functions of the other. The local
gOvernmen, has been re-m0deled by
the sovereign, that is all.


The members of the Board are city
officers. like the members of the
Council, their powers respectively oil
derived from the common fountain Of
municipal authority and municipal
privileges-the Legislature.


Both for their public conduct are re-
sponsible to the peoples aud one Is held
to the faithful performance of duty by
an additional heavy pecuniary obiiga-
tion. The fact that the Board COM
mences its career under appointment
fairly cannot affect the question more
than the circumstance that the Judge
of the City Court and Chief of Police,
according to the amended charter, are
also to be appointed-this being the
legislative will; or that, in the form
alton of new counties and judicial
districts, the State courts have to he
organized in the same way.


This power to regulate these public
boiies is said to be inherent in its ma
ture in the Legislature, when not re-
strained by the Constitution 40 How.
U. S. 534. We have seen that there
is no such restraint in our Constitu-
tion. and that the case of the People
VS.. Lynch has made no encroachment
upon this paramount authority of the
Legislature. The principle upon
which 1t rests, indeed, will be found
to be sustained throughout the Union.
The principle itself and the applica-
tion of it are illustrated in l6 How. u.
S. 1863, $50:


""Public or municipal corporations
are established for the local govern
ment of towns or particular districts.
The special powers conferred upon
them are not vested rights, as against
the State, but being wholly political,
exist only during the will of the gen.
eral Legislature; otherwise there
would be numberless petty govern
ments existing within the State and
forming part of it, but independent Of
the control of the sovereign power.
Such powers may at any time be re-
pealed or abrogated, either by gen.
eral law operating upon the whole
State or by special Act altering the"

below the Railroad, reported in favor
of placing a bridge with Is feet span
across the run; estimated cost, $500.

and other, for the paviHg, curbing and
guttering of Thirteenth street, between
'Claymont and Forrest streets, the com.
mittee reported favorably except as to
the guttering.


Mr.. Farrell said the guttering was
the most essential part, and moved to
amend the report by including it,
The amendment was lost and the
report was adopted.


The committee also reported in favor
of awarding the contract for building
a schultz across the Brandywine race, ,at
Orange street, to Stephen Davis at $133,

remonstrance of q: L, Garsed, and
others against it.


Mr.. VIM. Candy opposed the report.
and presented another remonstrance,
signed by property owners represent
ing, he said about one-half of the
street. He then moved to amend by
referring the report and the remons-
trance again to the committee.


Mr.. McMenamin said when the paw
ing Of Fourth street was proposed the
remonstrants were five to one against
the petitioners, Mr.. Febiger opposed
the paving of the street, as it would be
entirely useless, as far as the upper
part was concerned,


Mr.. Farrell thought the street was an
important one very level and particus
larly adapted to hauling-and should
be paved.

Front to Ninth.


Mr.. VIM. McCanby moved to amend
the amendment by inserting Sixth
street instead of Ninth.


Mr.. Farrell thought it began to look
as if the opposition to this matter. was
a political arrangement.


Mr.. Febiger said the paving was a
political affair, intended to carry the
Sixth Ward and re-elect Nlr. McDIenaI
min.


After further discussion, the amend

Mr.. Farrell offered an amendment
requiring the paving to extend to

toty.


In the GAzETrE, last week was men
toned the attempt of Mr.. VIM. Lynch
to obtain the custody of his children,
who, since the death of their mother,
have been living with their grandfath-
er, Mr.. James Bratton. Mr.. Lynch
had filed petition in the Superior
Court for writ of hd6eas corpus to se-
cure to him the possession of his chill
dren, and the hearing upon the writ so
granted, was heard yesterday, by Judge
Wales, in the Law Library, at ten
o'clock a. m. A number of witnesses
were examined by Mr.. Spruance, on
the part OF Mrs. Bratton, and upon the
part of Mr.. Lynch, many respectable
witnesses were examined, including
his brother, a clergyman, who apparent.
ly most satisfactorily proved Lynch's
complete reformation, and contradicted
many of the avertments of the other
side. One of the painful features of
the case was the testimony OF Miss
Mary Lynch, young girl of about II
years of age, who manifested intense
hostility to her father.


The case was one in which intense
feeling was manifested by both sides.
1t lasted the entire day until six in the
evening, and was concluded by Mr.
Spruance for the Bratton's, and by MIR.
O'Byrne for Mr.. Lynch.


The Judge will consider the case and
decide it at some future day. Mean
time the children will remain with
their grand father


ANOTHER SUIT FOR CUSTODY.


Judge Wales heard yesterday, upon
writ OF hdbeas corpus, the case of Miss
| Catharine Hughes, of Philadelphia, VS..
Mrs. Mcfarland, Of this city, wherein
the former claims the custody of her
neice, q girl about fourteen years OF
age, named Bridget McCahey. The
father of the child resides in the coun.
ty of Tyrone, in Ireland, and about a
year ago, requested Miss Hughes to
send for the child ,and take care of her
she did so, paying her passage to this
country. Iu the month of September,
Mrs. Mcfarland induced the child,
who was on visit TO Wilmington, to
remain with her, promising TO send
her to school. Instead of doing 80 she
put her in the match factory near this
city, to work. When this was COM
municated to Miss Hughes, she took
immediate sters to obtain her custody


After the hearing, Judge Wales, in 9
brief opinion, reviewed the case, aud
concluded as follows:


| Miss Hughes lives out at service ant
has no home to offer her niece, ant
would be compelled to find her on,
among strangers while Mrs. McGartlapt
gives Bridget home, and makes hel
one of her own family. On consider
alton of the whole case, do not thinl
it my duty to change the custody o.
Bridget McCahey, and she is accord
ingly rcmanded to the respondent."

a great deal has been said and written
in proof Of the ostracism TO which Republi-
cans are subject in the South, and it has
as often, aud with assumed indignation,
been denied by the Democratic prints Of
that section. When, however, the true
feelings of these rebel editors obtain sd-
vantage over their discretion they break
forth in strains that are the unmistakable
echoes OF the devilish spirit that possesses
them, Only day or two since we no.
ticed an editorial advertisements in States
vile IN. c. paper for Democratic o
barber. The editor acknowledged that the
village was in the enjoyment of an aSun-
dance Of the tonsorisl profession, but the
chivalry of that mountain city were loath
longer to have their birsute append ages
manipulated by the hands of Republic IN
members of the knights of the brush and
razor. The chances are that in the event
the unshsven Democracy of Satesville are
successful in their search for member Of
the shaving fraternity of the ""unwashed""
Democratic persuasion that the Republican
tonsorisl artists now there will be the
gamers. in escaping deflement by reason
of the necessity that will be laid upon them
to baEdle less of that which defiles. The
purpose, however, of this article was more
especially to call attention TO the subjoined
naorceau. clipped from the editorial col
umns of the Lynchourg Tirgin5an Of the
24th:


''If It shall turn out that Judge Bond, who
went to South Carolina ten days before tie
opening Of his court, had anything to do-and
We fear, from his antecedents, which are bad,
that he had-With manipulating the Returning
Board at Columbia, we hope that every gentle
man in this city will give him the cold shoul-
der when he comes here. He ought to be
quartered, in that case, at negro hotel""


Judge Bond went to South Carolina in
pursuance of his duties as United States
circuit judge for that among other States,
and we know no good reason why he
might not have gone ""ten"" days or one
hundred days ""before the opening of his
court"" had it suited his convenience to do
so. Certainly he might have done so with as
much propriety and in far better taste than
was exhibited by the flock of Democratic
pilgrims who visited the State of South
Carolina without invitation or authority,
and for the sole purpose, if we may pre-
sume-as has the Thginian in the case of
Judge Bond-of engaging in all manner of
discreditsble devices to have the State
counted"" for Ti1den, and thereby defeat
the expressed will of the people of State
in whose affairs non residents and unin-
vited visitors could have no legitimate con-
cern. On the other hand, it was eminently
proper in United States judge, knowing,
as he doubtless did, the character of the
Aforesaid pilgrims as well as the native
Bashi Bszouks with whom Ghey went to
associate, that their presence might give
rise to judicial complications in which his
presence would be necessity in the inter
est Of peace and justice, and that he should
he on hand to attend to the duties eni5ined
upon him by virtue of his Office. The same
Judge has been in that State before among
the 4. X. g, as the records of Aib,uy pen
itentiary abundantly testify. As to his
manipulating the Returning Board"" that
is bosh Of the thinnest texture. The boIrd
seems. judging from the sequel, to have
been in possession of abundant ability TO
take care not only of itself but of the great
interests committed 10 it, and to thwartth
combination of pilgrims and Bashi Bizouks,
and that. too, without the interference ofthe
Judge or ANY other man."" The truth is,
the TIginidR dislikes the aforesaid func-
tionaTy for more reasons than oqe, not
only because he is in politics an uncompro-
missing Republican, but for the additional
reason that he had few moaths since, in
the regular performance Of his legitimate
judicial functions, to turn over a Virginia
railroad, at the instance of creditors who
thought they were being deprived of their
just dues, to receivers. The VirgiHidn
had been making a good thing out of the
road IN question in the matter of printing,
&c, which was likely to be estopped, lence
'fhe CALLED jade winces."" Unfortunately,
Judge Bond is ""a Radical"" If he had not
been, the possibility is that he would not
have deprived the Tirginian and Billy
Malone of their pickings. Consequently,
being ""a Radical"" as hereinbefore men
toned, who failed to see the propriety
either of permitting Democrats to absorb
railroad earnings that belonged to foreign
bondholders, or who. with equal regard
for fair dealing in political Counts""
placed himself in inconvenient proximity
to the concoctors Of Democratic villanies
in South Carolina, he must needs draw
from that mild-mannered @ exponent of
Virginia Democracy, the Lynchburg Vr-
ginian, the ""hope that every geutleman(D
al in this city will give him the cold
shoulder when he comes here"" He
even goes further than that, and seeks to
bring discredit on his bosom friends, dun
gees colored Conservative club, "" of which
he was wont to be so laudstory prior to
the late election, by inserting that che
ought to be qusrtered at a negro hotel.""
This is really the unkindest cut OF all, and
will doubtless be cause of affiiction to the
Tirginian's friend Duugee.


Bsdinage aside, there is serious aspect
TO this social and business ostracism that
is slowly, it may be, but quite as surely,
working the ruin of all the material pros
poets of the South. The papers of that
locality are constantly parading the advan.
tages of that section of the country, which
really might be great, before the people,
and urging emigrants to settle there. They
have formed innumerable emigration So
cieties, for the purpose of inducing
greatly needed addition to their population,
and yet, after all these efforts to replenish
their numbers, those who do 60 there, if
they are Republicans, in most cases meet
with the reception fjreshadowed in the ad-
vice rendered by the Tirginian to the
people Of the city in which it is published;
but if the correspondent of Northern
newspaper who possesses q wholesome re-
gard for the truth, in the course of his
peregrinations in the South, states the case
with the same frankness that the Virginian
has done, he is at once denounced as
'Iying Radical"" who has abused their
hospitality by telling the truth. Good

OF CITY COUNCIL TO BE CHOSEN.


The municipal election in this city will
be held on September 5h, five weeks from
next Tuesday. There are to be elected:
One member of Council from tine First
Ward, in place of Thomas johnson, term
expired.


One member from the Second Ward, in

One member from the Third Ward, in

One member from the Sixth Ward, in
place of VIM. McMenamin, term expired


One member from the Seventh Ward, in
place of VIM. NJ. Candy, term expired.


One member from the Eighth Ward, in

One member from the Ninth Ward in

One member from the Tenth Ward in
place of L. p. Lynch, term expired.


There will be, it is safe to say,


A NUMBER OF CHANGES.


Messrs. Murphey, McMenamin, and Far
rel, Democrats from Republican Wards,
will naturally not be returned, though both
McMenamin and Farrell may be expected
to fight hard for reelection. In the First
Ward, Thomas johnson will doubtless be
renomnated by the Republicans. In the
Fifth Ward, William Canby's renomina-
ton is generally desired, and Henry F..
Pickles is warmly urged to resume his old
seat. Ic is believed that il he will consent
to do so he will be nominated with entire
unanimity. In the Sixth Ward, against
McMenamin, Seth III. Feaster has been pro-
posed, and Doctor G. Harlan would be very
acceptable to many. G. Wesley Weldin,
who was urged to run, declines. In the
Seventh Ward, many citizens will part with
William Nj. Candy with regret, but he would
not serve longer. Geo. s. Capelle, John
Green, F. L. Gllpip, Preston Lea, and AL
fred D. Warner are among those suggested
for the place. In the Ninth Ward, John 7.
Davis has been named, and there is very
favorable expression in favor of Ziba Fer
ris, or John Palmer, either of whom would
carry the Ward by large majority.

the legal government IN Louisiana was
counted out BY fraud four years ago
No fair-minded Republican attempts to
deny the fact, in face Of the refusal Of
the United States States Senate to ad-
init any Of Kellogg Senators to seats.
But IN four years the popular recollec-
tion Of these events has grown some
what dim, and brief outline Of them
will give our people clear idea Of the
outline of the outrage, which, there are
too many reasons to fear, viii be at
tempted again, in order to deprive Gov
ernor Tiiden of the position to which
he has been legally elected.


The Returning Board, Of Infamous
memory. was composed of the Govern
or, the Liestenant-G Governor, the Secre-
tary of State, and two Senators. In
1872. two of these officials, having been
removed by the Governor, formed Re-
turning Board Of themselves, filled va
eancics, and proceeded to count the
ballots, which always remained in pos
session of the other and legal Board
II was this count Of ballots, which the
canvassers never saw, which declared
William Pitt Kellogg Governor of Lou
isiana. And it is this same Governor
who Is now preparing, there is every
reason to believe, to use the same ma
chinery to count in Rutherford b.
Hayes! In 1872 just after the cleo
ton, Kellogg filed a, complaint before
Judge Durell that 10000 persons had
been denied registration that from
1900 to 5000 blacks had been deprived
of the right to vote, that ballots enough
to elect him had not been counted: that
the returns were about to be DESTROYED
sc. Durrell. who goes down to histo-
ry as ''the drunken judge"" declared
the Kellogg Board legal, and enjoined
Mr.. McEnery from making any claim
to the office OF Governor. Warmoth
checked this movement by approving a
law passed at the last session OF the
Legislature, but not yet acted on, abol-
ishing all existing Boards of Canvassers
and authorizing the Governor to ap-
point new one. He approved the law
and appointed Returning Board. This,
under the Constitution of Louisiana. he
could legally do. The Returning Board
canvassed the votes actually cast, and
declared McEnery elected Governor.


This was supposed to be the end Of
the matter; but the same night, though
no application for troops had been made,
Acknowledgement Williams tclegraphed
to Marshal Packard that he was to en-
force the decrees of the United States
Court, and that General Emory would
furnish ""all necessary troops for that
purpose"" The same official, by order
of the President, had refused troops a
few months ago, when they were called
for bv the Governor and the Legi>la-
ture. Durclrs midnight order"" was
now issued, ordering the Marshal to
take possession of the State House, and
prevent the assembling of the Meme
nv Legislature. Packard, and other
Kellogg officials, including the latter's
own counsel, afterward testified that
this was issued bv Durell on his motion
and without application.


OF this order and others, Senators
Carpenter, Anthony, Logan and Alcorn,
all Republicans, said, in their report :
Viewed in any light, the order and in
functions made and granted by Judge
Durrell in this cause, are most repre-
hensihly erroneous in point Of law, and
are wholly void, for want of juris-
diction; and your committee must ex-
press their sorrow and humiliation that
a Judge OF the United States would have
proceeded in such fragrant disregard
Of his duty, and have SO far ovcrstepped
the limits of Federal jurisdiction""


Under Durrelrs order the Kellogg
Returning Board declared Kellogg's ma
iority to be 1851. This extract from
the testimony before the Senate Conn
mittee, shows how this accurate major
ity was obtained-T Mr.. Lynch was
member of the Kellogg Board, which
was called the Lynch Board, after him |:


Mr.. LYscH.-We took all the evil
dence we had before us: and on knowl-
edge of the parishes and their political
complexion, and then we decided.


Senator CARpENrER.-You estima-
ted it, then, upon the basis of what you
thought the vote ought to have been:


Mr.. LYNcH.-Yes, sir; that was just
the fact; and think, on the whole we
were pretty correct.


The ""eyidence"" was afterwards found
to consist Of newspaper articles, letters
and several thousand afidavits (discov-
cred to have been fcrged) by negroes,
that they had been deprived of,he right
to vote. This Board, which declared
Kellogg's majority TO be 1881, never
had an official return before it, and this
pretended accuracy was sheer, impu-
dent falsehood. Both Legislatures or
ganized, and John McEnery and one
hundred of the wealthiest citizens tele-
graphed to Washington that they were
about to come North to Law their case
before the President, and prayed him
not 10 recognize either government
until he had heard them. Williams,
the Attorney General, sent On insolent
reply that the visit would be ''unavail-
ing"" that ""the Presidents decision is
made, and will not be changed""


The Senate investigation followed,
and the report of the majority OF the
committee, signed by Senators Carpen-
ter, Logan, Alcorn and Anthony. con-
cluded as follows:


at is the opinion Of your committee
that, but for the unjusti6able i:-terfer-
ence of Judge Durrell. whose orders

him for the past year. While there
was no break in the personal relations

fort when together.


The President will be quite as good
as his word, aud if the Democrats con-
tinue in their obstinate course, the en-

probably be suspended July first. As
the situatiD IN looks now it does not
seem possible for the House to pass

the evening session, Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday of this week, to consider the
legislative appropriation bill, the House
then went into Committee of the whole
on the bill to provide for the deficiency in
the printing and engraving Bureau of the
the Treasury, and for the issue of silver
coin of the United States in place of frac-
tional currency.


The general features of the bill, and
principally of the section providing for the
issue of silver coin, were discussed pro and
con by Landers, Evans, Philips, N. s.
Burchard Bright, Hamilton NJ. Near
field, Page and Townsend. Randall fol-
lowed, and in the course of his remarks
charged that portion ofthe opposition to the
silver clause of the bill was due to Bank
note engraving companies, who, between
the years 1868 and 1874 had received over
IS, 900, 100000 from the Government.
A number of amendments were offered to
be considered as pending and ordered to be
printed.


Mr.. Speaker laid before the house sew
eral communications from the President ,
including a message vetoing bill for
the relief of j. A. Hyle of Missouri, and a
communication from the chairman of tho
board, on behalf of the United Stat es Ex-
ecutive department, at the Centennial, ask

is in the Jamaica, J.. J., jail. Since the l5b
of August, when Maggic's mutilated body


was found near her parents dwelling, Kate


Hoffman and two or three men have been
suspected. Among them was Frank Nc
Conachi, otherwise known as Frank Gen.
| ME. He Was arrested several weeks ago,
aud both he and Kate Hoffman were In jail
last week, and then they were discharged
| for lack of evidence. Detective Stephen
| Payne was far from satisfied with this ac-
tion, and kept steadily on McConachi's
track. McConachi persistently insisted
| that be was in New York at the time tht
murder was committed. This was foucd
70 be untrue, the officers ascertaining thai
On the day and the day previous to the
murder he was at Decker's store in Spring


field. On Sunday, the 18th, he was there
On Monday, about an hour after tht
murder, he entered saloon kept by Ger
man between Springfield and Mr.. Bauer'e
house, and asked for something to eat. A.
his time 1t was noticed that his nose and
face were scratched and bleeding.
On Saturday night last, Detective Payne
re-arrested McConachi and yesterday he
took him from his cell 10 the place where
the murder was committed.


On arriving vt the spot where the bod,
was found, the prisoner trembled violently
and completely broke down, and made full
confession, not only of The crime, but of the
manner in which he committed 1t. At tht
request Of Payne, he showed others, who
we're near by, the spot where the deed was
committed and the way in which he accom-
plished it. His narration is as follows:


On the afternoon of the 14th Of August
be was In a cornfield when Maggie went TO
show Kate Hoffman the way through the
woods to the Valley Stream depot. He saw
them both 60 past the cornfeld, watched
Maggie's return, and as she got opposite 10
him, he sprang out at her, and grsppled her
by the throat to prevent her from making
Doise, the poor child meanwhile crying,
""Ma ma !""


At this point in the confession, th-
mother of Maggie, who was pres ent, sprang
upon the prisoner with the force of tig-
ress and grappled him by the throat. The
officer took her cff.


gle he kept his grasp upon her throat and

woods, where he attempted violence, anu
crammed leaves and the corner of her bon
net into her mouth-tying the strings to
gether about her neck. He also took her
waist ribbon and tied it tightly around ber
neck, which completed the work of murder
He afterwards broke down some cedar
limbs, so that e couM ind the body after
dark, for the purpose of hiding it more ef-
tectualy; but when darkness came on he
was afraid 10 90 near the place.


After McConachi had made this terrible
confession he was taken by the officers to
the Valley Stream Depot, to take a train
back to Jamaica. Here, the confession be
ing noised about, a crowd soon gathered
with rope, and the prisoner was saved
with great difficulty from immediate death
by lynching; the officers threatening to
shoot the irst person that approached him
He was returned in safety to his cell at Ja-
maica.


McConachi is twenty-.even years old and
was born in this country. The members OF
his family are highly respected residents Of
Brooklyn, and for some time past have re.
fused to have anything to do with him."

Wesley church Of the colored citizens Of the
Fifth, Sixth and Seventh districts, called at the
request OF q number of citizens, to consider mat
ters in relation to the colored schools Of the Dis
trict. d.
The meeting was opened with prayer by Mr..
Joseph II. Jackson called the meeting to order,
and was elected permanent chairman; Mr.. Gil
bert II. Joy was elected secretary.


The chairman, In stating the object OF the

ing he had communicated with the president OF
any bill in benefit Of the colored schools had been
recommended to Congress by that body. He re-
]. r. Lynch, January %, providing for q reorgan-
ization OF a colored school board in the District.
Alter remarks by several present, q committee
on resolutions was appointed, who reported the
following


RESOLUTIONS:


Whereas bill has been introduced In the House
of Repre- sentatives by the Hon. J. r. Lynch,
board: and whereas we believe that thU bill was
gotten up in secret by parties who have not the
true interest Of our schools at heart, but have
only II cir selfish motives to crafty;


RssoIred, That we, the colored citizens In mass
meeting assembled, comprising the Firth, Sixth
snG asrd Of this city the aoon q the Hon
orable Commissioners in consolidating the school
boards, and believe that their object was TO
our children should have the same high
order Of qualification In their teachers as sre en-
joyed by our white citizens, and we most respect
fully request the Commissioners to remove the
discording element that binders the progress OF
our schools, and that they Will see to It that our
children have teachers Of education and refine
ment and such qualifications for training the
youth as are enjoyed In the white schools OF this
city.


ResoIved, That q committee of three be ap-
pointed TO lay these resolutions before the Uom-
missionsrs Of the District OF Columbia, and to
furnish the Board OF School Trustees with COPY,
and that they respectfully request the Hon. Mr..
Lynch TO withdraw said bill.


After considerable debate the resolutions were
adopted and the meeting adjourned."

;ztions of a great crime committed
within its borders, particulars of
which are given in a special to the
Chicago papers. A man named John
Cottrell, some time last fall married a
widow Melrose. who had two children,
both boys, aged and 10 respectively.
Ever since the marriage the stepfather
has behaved toward the children in
the most brutal manner; frequently
driving them away from home in the
dead Of night, when they usually took
refuge with some the neighbors, and
compelling them to go without shoes
Oh their feet. and really without cloth
ing upon their backs. A few nights
ago he got one Of his freaks on and
drove them out. They were almost
without clothing, and started for their
uncle's, i'll Crawford county, When
ten miles below their home, in Clark
county, the younger Of the two boys
gave out. His brother succeeded in
getting him upon a piece of ground
free from ice and SNOW; and, leaving
him, went on to the house of a gentle
man by the name of James Hand,
where he was taken in. His STEP
father had been in the habit of beat
ing him and his brother whenever
they told anything of his mistreat-
ment, and it was some time before he
would consent to tell Of his own and
his brothers sufferings. About this
time Mr.. Sackrider came up having
found the younger brother dead where
the elder had left him. An inquest was
held, and the jury returned verdict
that the child came to his death
through the brutal treatment of his
stepfather. With difficulty the COM
munity were restrained from lynching
the stepfather, who is under arrest."

odist Episcopal church in China. The
emigration of Chinese is principally
from Hong Kong. The emigration is
conducted, he thought, on the same
principle as in Germany and other
principal European countries. The
Chinese Companies, as far as he knew,
have no criminal power, and were it
not for the contract with the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company, would have
no power over the mass of Chinese in
San Francisco without the consent of
six companies or the sanction of Cox
or some missionary, in the case of
converted Chinese. No Cinnamon
can return in the Pacific Mail Compa-
ny's vessels. Many of the Chinese
who come here have no knowledge of
the existence of these companies, or
hongs, until they arrive. At the
wharf they are met by the agents of
the companies and asked what portion
of China they come from, and the an
swer determines the company to
which they will be assigned.


Silver coin has improved since yes
terday, Brokers' quotations now vary
ing from 4@5 per cent. discount; trade
dollars are also improving, there being
a brisk demand from Cinnamon at d
@10 per cent. discount. 1t is evident
that there is a lock up process going
En- among bullion men who have found
it necessary to take the step in order
to protect their interests. That their
manipulations in progress at the pres
ent time may be surmised from the
fact that the Banks of California and
Nevada and London and San Francis
co Bank and nearly all the other lead
ing institutions of the kind refuse to
sell dollar in silver coin and are con-
stantly in the market buying the arti-
Gle up. The China steamer carried in
the neighborhood of $600,000 half in
fine silver bars and half in Mexican
and trade dollars.


Martinelle Eugene was arrested this
afternoon on charge of attempting
rape upona three and half year old
child the Daughter of man named
Herman, residing on Vallejo street. 1t
is charged that the accused enticed the
child into cellar near her house and
attempted the commission of the afro
cious crime. Before he escaped peo-
Pile who saw the child leave the cellar
crying, captured him, and only the
timely arrival of an officer prevented
large crowd which had congregated
from lynching him.


1t is reported that the Democratic
State Central Committee is engaged
i'll incubating job and will try to
send delegates to the st. Louis con
vention without the intervention of a
State convention. The committee was
in secret session this afternoon. The
County Committee, which meets this
evening, intends to have something
to say about the matter.


The Democratic State Central Com
mittee met this afternoon at Union
hall, in this city. There were twenty
four delegates present. Colonel Peter
Donahue, the chairman, presided. The
object of the meeting was to set day
for the State Convention, to select del
egates to the Democratic National
Convention at st. Louis. 1t was
finally ordered that the State Con-
vention should be held at San Fran

The large hall in the summer school building,
Seventeenth and NJ streets northwest presented
last night scene long to be remembered. The
hall itself was a picture OF lovelinese the stage
being formed into a perfect flower bower, contain
ing the choicest exo:ies, the perfume from which
permeatcd the entire building. The flowers were
hung in graceful festoens around the arch which
eneireles the stage. Suspended from the ceiling
were numbers Of beautiful baskets containing
the loveIiest offerings Of nature. Immediately
over tae arch were the words, 'normal class""
with Cupid reclining between the two words. The
devotion OF the class to the memory ef the late
ChsTles Sumner was attested by the elegant and
tasty decorations which surrounded his admirable

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: The committee on

this the hIst commencement occasion, relative to
the cOlOred schools Of Washington and George
town. and particularly to the origin, progress and


usefulness Of the school with which the depart


ment inviting Your presence and attention to-
night is connected. Prior TO the year 1852 which
may be regarded the beginning of tho free
school era for eoloTed children in the District of
Columbia, the free colored Population Of this Dis
tTict had enjoyed, with but slight Interruptions
in time. tho benots Of instruction in colored prf-
yate or pay schools for half o century. As early
as the year 1907, more than two thirds Of century
ago, school hGnse was b1Iit, furnished and sup

which was almost, If not quite within hearing OF

Its erection was but year or two subsequent
TO the organization Of the first free schools for
the white children of this city. These two facts
of almost simultaneous Occurrence-ths estab-
fishing OF free schools only for the white children
Of this city out OF the common public fund and
the erection of house and establishment
therein OF school for eoiored children by three
illiterate colered men, out Of the savings Of the

and injustice and unfortunate and scathing re-
Election upon the ruling elements of society of
that day, and the latter in the appreciation OF
the value of education shown and in the energy
evoked for its attainment, proud monument TO
the qualities and capacities OF race. The mere
mention of the names Of those three men, George
Bell; Nicholas Franklin and Moses Liverpool,
should tncite to higher aspirations and their
memories should be reYered as those Of the bene-
factors of mankind.


cannot, perhaps, morc happily pass from this
period TO the next than through the following
glowing but


JUST TRIBUTE


by the Hon. Henry Barnard, ex Commissioner OF
Education, WHO, in his report to the Senate Of the
United States, in 1885, respecting schools in this
District says ..It is worthy of observation thai
in no case he's coored school ever failed for the
want Of scholars: The parents we're always glai
to send their children, and the children were
always ready to 60, even when too poor to be de-
Gently fed or clothed. When o school failed it
was for want Of money, and not for want of appre-
citation Of the benefits of education. The same
remarkable avidity for learning was then appar-
ent as is now so manifest among the whole body
Of the col0red population Of this District.


The coicred people of the District have shown
themselves capable, TO q wonderful degree of
supporting and educating themselves, while at
the same time contributing by taxation TO the
support Of the white scnools, from which they |
were debRrred, and that, too, when in numerous |
cases they had previously bought themselves and
families from Slavery at very great expense
their history furnishing eNRmple of coura ge |
and success, in the mist of trial and oppression,
scarcely equaled in the annals of mankind.-


At the breaking out of the rebellion there were |
about zoo children in attendance at the eolOrei
as the free colOred population at thai period was
ll000, the attendance at those schools Wss fatty
rroportionate to that of the public schools Of to-
day with their population Of i4,oOl. From those
100 pupils were formed the advanced classes in
tie schools Of the relief societies which succeeded
largely the pay schools, and which did commend |
able work in this community as late as the ear
1855.


In the school year 1890 it became paInrully |
apparent that the most advanced pupils in each |
OF the five school districts were prevented from
making that progress which proper grading |
would permit. The cause lay in the. multiplicity
oi classes under one teacher, 10 prevent

there was no provision whatever. The cause of |
the small classes was in the neeessItOus cIrcum-
stances forcing tn laa
some before reaching, and others after having |
reached. the more advanced grades To permit |
this state Of things 10 continue to invite dis
cOuragement, and thereby, in frequent voluntary |
TO deprive many of the dement's to
be derived from higher instruction and the schools
OF much excellent material, which could be
shortly fitted for usefulness in this community |
and elsewhere.


The frequent interviews which We hays hal
With teachers Of those schools in that wear ali |
pointed 10 the one feasible plsn-that of consoIi- |

and the school, would be outweighed by the supe- |

would afford


In November Of the following school year

adopted by the board of trustees in the transfer |

A citizen of Gonzales, Texas, feeling
aggrieved at comments In the Galveston
Ae,cs upon the lynchinR OF three alleged
m.rderers, has sent to the editor OF that
journal the moose cut from the rope with
which oue of the victims, named Stuart
Campbell, was hanged, to show that the
rope was tied Ia y regular hangman 4
knot 40 that Campbell would have no
reason to complain, provided he had
been in condition TO complain after
the completion of the job, The Coma
les man says the hanging was not done
In haste nor Ia brutal manner. The
three were made to stand on horses
which were led from under them, the
men having previously been given time
for prayer. ct cetera. The necks OF
Tucker Campbell, and man named
McElroy, were broken, while Stuart
Campbell died from straugulation. The
NeDs correspondent claims that the
hanging was done after the fashion
wnich the law Directs, aud is evidently
surprised as we'll as ohagriDed to learu
that people should oriticise the execu-
tioners for emitting the preliminary for

common, but it Is not often complicated with
lynching as in the strange case reported from
Clermont Mills, Md. The story is that the
murderer, being taken to the woods by a
crowd, was hung for little while, and then
cut down before he was strangled; and that
afterward he hung himself. This looks like
tale invented to cover the actual facts of
lynching performance but even if it be true,
the crowd of lynchers can and should be held
for assisting at suicide; practically, at a
murder."

presented a petition Of citizens of Massachu
setts asking the passage of a law making
every member of Congress responsible to hi'


constituents, the majority of whom, it he does
not meet their expectations, may at any TINT
recall him and appoint a successor The ques
tion of amending the 22d joint rule came up OF
a resolution of Mr. Edmun. This rule relates
to the method of counting the votes for Presi-
dent and Vice President and provides that
majority in joint convention may have the
power to throw out the vote of any state. Al
the two houses are now constituted the Demo
Gratis have a majority in joint convention and
the 22d rule would give them the power to rev
olutionize the government and defeat candi
date elected by the people. The question was
discussed at some length, but went over with
out action.


H0uSe.-Bills were introduced and referred
as follows; to repeal stamp duties ON medi.
cines; to prevent traffic in intoxicating liquors
at the Centennial; for removal of all political
disabilities; prescribing form of oath fol
members of Congress; to reduce the salaries Of
all executive and legislative officers of the gov.
eminent except of the army and navy, under
$1500, 20 per cent. and to fix the salary of the
President at $4,000; directing discontinuance
of work on the streets in Washington; to re-
peal the act prohibiting payment of debts due
by the United States before the war, except on
proof of loyalty; to amend the act granting
pensions to soldiers of the war of 1872


MIR. OBrien of Maryland submitted the fol-
lowing amendment to the constitution:


Section mo state shall make any law re-
specting an establishment of religion or prohib-
itlng the free exercise thereof, and no minister
or preacher of the gospel of any religious creed
or denomination shall hold any office of trust or
emolument under the United States or under
any state;uor shall any religious test be requir-
ed as qualification for any office or public
trust in any state or under the United States


Section 2-No money received by taxation
from any state for the support of public schools
or derived from any public fund therefor, nor





under control of any religious sect, nor shall
any money SO raised, nor lands so devoted be
divided between religious sects or denomina-
tions, nor shall any minister or preacher of the
gospel or any religious creed or denomination
hold any Office in connection with the public
schools in any state, nor be eligible to any posi-
tion of trust or emolument in connection with
any institution, public or private, in any state
under the United States which shall be sup
ported in whole or in part from any public
fund.


Mr.. Whyte of New York moved to suspend
the rules and bring the House to a vote on the
amnesty bill introduced by him from the ben
eft of which JEFF. Davis is excluded, and also
to vote on the amendment striking out that
section. The motion to suspend the rules was
lost-yeas ITO, nays $50.


Mr.. Holman moved to suspend the rules and
adopt resolution declaring it unwise and in
expedient at this time that specific and arb-
trary periods should be prescribed by law at
which legal tender notes of the United States
shall be paid in coin by the Secretary of the
Treasury, and that therefore the acs entitled an
act to provide for the resumption of specie pay
ment approved Jan. IA, 1872, ought to be re-
pealed, and instructing the committee on bank
ing and currency to report bill for that pur-
pose.

that the drawings and votes were to be an

fallen to the political enslavement Of the
honest white man under the tyranous

vulturous carpet-bagger. If this is to form

pointed. During the absence of this commute GOV.

addressed the Convention. He impressed upon the

ON the abstract issues of old. Let the whoie

On the Road to the Park-Two wsll-Contsstsd


Trnfs",,"A great many city people never get chance to
see waving fields and cool, shady groves except
when they go to the races. The ride to Bright
wood is always an enjoyable one to the city bust
ness man, although the surroundings are not en-
tirely rural The dwellings by the way are not
rustic enough, the woods arc not Wild enough, the
wayiarers are not simple enough. There are no
stump-fences, no rough-haired, horny handed
grangers Bat still pleasant relief is afforded,
and whenever there are races at Brightwood the
winding read to the park is alive with vehicles.
Buses, carryals, buggies, hacks, every descrip-
tfon Of conveyance that the nineteenth century
has prodSced, stampede the road. Every enc Is
on an eqxal footing. The s'liner,"" sitting On the
box of his dingy hack and shaking his stump Of q
whip over his spawned nags, feels as hilarious as
the high official with his pair of fancy trottsrs and
as heartily as the most important. The liveliest
scene on the road is the return home from the
races. Then all start together In pell-men race
to be the first to reach the city.

rasping Of wheels is pleasant music. The most
dismal gathering in the world Is Dass ipii n, Gi

The scenes about the track were varied, too.
Little knots Of men discuss the claims Of the sew
eral horses, and others stand about the pool-
stand with their hands in their pockets and listen
to the jokes Of the auctioneer. Everybody talks
horse talk"" and pretends to know exactly what
trotted by each watches his particular avorite
with critical squint, and, turning TO the by
stander, assures them that ""she's good 'un. ""
No matter how comfortable the seats provided
are, men will always sit on the backs Of them A
man must get in such position that his knees
advance any opipion on q race. When heat is
finished all Of the selfstyled judges rush down
from the grand stand, tumbling over the seats

now canvassing Virginia for the Democratic
party, in late speech at Lynchburg gave
utterance to the following atrocious senti-
ment, which we commend to the especial
attention of the colored people, whom he is
endeaVoring to seduce. Speaking of free
dom, he said:


t'Why, colored men, Lincoln was a pet
tifogging demagogue, and was continually
boWfDg the knee to slavery, and had he not
been driven to it, would never have issued
the proclamation""


Referring to the Irish race, Duugee used
the following complimentary language, that
must be especially refreshing to ex-Mayor
Kelley, of Richmond, whose party employs
this refined and dignifed orator:


""You colored people have been told that
there were many instances wherein the Irish
had been good friends, quoting from the speech
of 0'CoRnen in the British Parliament, aud
saying many things to prove his position.
tell you that the Irish race are a brutal and
inferior set of people, and the bitterest enemies
of the earth. 1t was these damnable Irish that
in 1868, and warn you colored people to avoid
an Irshman as you would snake""


The Democratic papers Published in
Lynchburg say that Dungee's speech was
one of the best ever delivered in that city.
Further comment is unnecessary."

Sending Troops South.",,"





The Hamburg RiOt-A Pretext for |


Sending Troops South.
The Radical newspaper express no
sympathy for the poor white man
who was shot down by the negro militia
company at Hamburg, S. c. We have
no doubt that this innocent mans death |
was heart-rending to his relatives and |
friends.
We have no good men in this country |
to spare, either white or black, and the
killing of any such is crime that must
be atoned for to the offended laws. Lynch
law is not to be commended, even when |
men deserve to die for their offenses.
What threats tho ring leaders of the |
negro militia company at Hamburg, may
have made while with their arms they
occupied the house as a fort and detied |
oil the civil authorities, has not yet been
fully made known. But we have no
doubt that when all tine facts come to be
learned it will be found that the whites
did not act without great provocation.
We do not justify the execution Of the
six negro men said to have been shot
after the company had surrendered. The
whole affair shows how completely the
Republican party has failed in its at
tempts TO govern the country. The
general government is robbed by the
100000 white of6ce holders. from the
Cabiuet officers down to the tide wait
ers, and in the Southern States the
negroes are made to bear arms to over
awe the white people while the carpet
baggers rob them of the little that is
left after paying the taxes imposed upon
them by the negro; the latter enjoying
nearly all the offices, when they are no.
toriously untitled and wholly irresponsi-
BILE.


There is little wonder that the poor
white people of the South feel degraded
and outraged by the villainous govern
ments Grants soldiers have forced upon
them during most of the past eight or
ten years.


THE negro population about Ham
burg is one of the worst in the whole
South. 1t was there that was organized
afew months ago plot for the general
rising of the blacks against the whites
in several counties in Georgia, which
would have involved wholesale murders
and outrages of the most fearful kind
Fortunately correspondence revealing
the details of the conspiracy was inter
cepted, and by the prompt intervention
of Judge johnson and Gov. Smith o
Georgia, bloodshed was prevented
Prince Rivers. the negro magistrate VIII
figured in the Hamburg disturbance
was one of the conspirators implicate
III this plot. The so-called militia com
pany of Dock Adams was a mob Of negr
rufians who had become notorious fo
their outrages, and had been ordered b
the Governor t deliver up their arms t
the State year ago. They were de.
peradoes who dehed the authorities an
private citizens alike, AMI though tn
does not excuse the killing of pr;so,
ors who had surrendered themselves,
shows that it was not political mott,
which led to the tragedy""


There are people who believe tn
affair was designedly brought about f
political purpose.


That an attempt Is 10 be made TO car
the Southern States ty the bayonet ,
are assured, even by Republican paper
as the following copied from one W
