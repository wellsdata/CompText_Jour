General Sheridsn.s Victories and Their


ADV ges TO General Grans.


The ""short sharp and dec sive"" operations
of General Sheridan in the Shenandoah valley

the king o. soldiers to storm nd carry the in
trenched defensive lne Of ,.uemy on the
oppos te hank of the difficult rav.ne OF Opeqnan

and aaescity. with the slodgment and retreat
OF Early, to follow him instantly to push him
vigorously, and then, when brought to stand
IN strong position, to attack him at once,
with absolute confidence and complete success
Thus the advantages which were not gained
in the battle Of Opequan creek were fully CON-
pretended as within his grasp by General
Sheridan, as were also the advantages that
might acc ue to the enemy from single hours
delay in pushing on his trail. Thus, at Fishers
Hill. white Early was still staggering and de-
moralized from the blow administered below
Winchester, in being attacked again, he was
speedily routed and put to fight. notwithstand-
ing his fsncied security on . fortified range Of
heights deemed imprcgnabe. This is the forti-

suburbs Of Baltimore 9,f


We have despatch from General Lee to
the rebel War Office confirming snbstan TALLY,
though somewhat vaguely, our ewn reports Of
the results Of the battle st Opequan creek and
announcing that General Early had fallen back
to Fishers Hill, having succeeded in getting
quent disaster to Early ut Fishers Hill renders
tho safety of those trains exceedingly doubtful.
The information we have OF the movements Of
Torberts cavalry leads us to the impression
that Earlys provision wagons will not escape
and that he will be fortunate in reaching
Richmond with even . remnant OF his late
formidable army OF near forty thousand vcte-
ran troops His killed, wounded and nissing
Che night after bis expulsion from Fishers Hill
probably exceeded tweaty thou.and men, be-
ginning at 0pequsn creek. The escape of the
remaining fragments Of his army will depend
more upon thor dispersion than their cohesion.


Tho substantial results of General Sheridan's
victories we nay thus safely estimate as in
volving loss to General Lee Of oie-fourth OK
the forces upon which he has relied for the de-
fence OF Richmond, and the strengthening OF
Grant in the same ratio in addition to the re-
Inducements he is constantly receiving. The


strategioal advantages gained are equally i'm
portant; for Sheridan now absolutely controls
the Shenandoah valley, and by moving towards
Lynchburg will, ia all robability-considerin

 Dispatches from General Grant, dated at 8 o'clock this morning, have just reached this department He says:

 We have now ended the sixth day of very heavy fighting. The result to this time is much in our favor. Our losses have been heavy' as we'll as those of the enemy. 1 think the loss of the enemy must be greater. We have taken over 5000 prisoners in battle, whilst he has taken from us but few except stragglers. I PROPOSE TO FIGHT TT OUT ON THIS LINE, IF IT TAKES ALL SUMNER""

 THE GOVERNMENT IS STARING NO PAINS TO SUPPORT HIM. EDWIN NJ. STANTON, Secretary of War.

 SECOND DISPATCH :-WAsHISGroN, May IF |--9:l5 P. NJ.

 4 O -uCfOI UcHcIW DtI [.

 No dispatches from the Army of the Poto |mac have been received since ll:30 o'clock Hast night.

 General Sherman has not been heard from lowing, probably, to the damage to the lines !south of Nashville, by the recent storm. A dispatch from Gen. Sheriden, dated i Headquarters of the Cavalry Corps, May 10, states that he turned the enemy's right, and !got into their rear. had destroyed from eight ito ten miles of railroad, two locomotives and three trains, and a very large quantity of sup ,plies; and that since he had got into thei 'rear, there was great excitement among the Inhabitants and with the army. The enemy's |but had been run of, and he had re captured five hundred of our men--two of them Colo |nels.

 ;davs from General Butler.

 Dispatches received from General Steele re bort his command as having arrived at Little Rock. He had fought superior force of the |enemy, commanded by Kirby Smith in person lat Saline River, and defeated them. A steamboat from Red River, arrived to day at Cairo, reports endorsements going ur to-day to General Banks.

 General Canby has passed Cairo on his way Ito Red River.

 EDWIN NJ. STANTON, Secretary of War. A cores pendent says :-Wednes'lay morn ing the fighting was again renewed. and Wa; eontinued with various success until about ! b clock, when our line was somewhat advan ced.

 At that hour a flag of truce is reported te have been sent by Lee, who asked for ces sation of hostities for forty-eight hours. that he might bury his dead.

 General Grant replied that he had not time ito bury his own dead, and would advance i'm medately; and some parts of our lines were therefore pushed forward.

 It is stated that the woods were shelled, but no response was elicited from where the enc mys centre had been few hours before.

 The prisoners captured on Tuesday and We tuesday number over 4,000. The rebel dead and wounded were found covering almost every foot of ground wherever our troops sur ged forward and the rebels gave way.

 The slaughter among our troops was terrific but not so great as that of the enemy, and but few captures were made by the latter.

 Among the killed in the battle of Tuesday, We're Brig. Gens. Stevenson and Rice. The latter lived about two hours after being taken to the hospital. Just previously to his death. he requested to be turned and on being asked which way replied. Turn my face toward the enemy"" Those wore his last words Be fore he died. he suffered the ampu.ation of a leg near the thigh.

 SATrRnAy.-The brilliant news of Friday that Lees Army had received a if not a crushing blow, was officially on Saturday, by dispatches from Gen Grant himself mp to Friday morning at 8 O. clock, at which time Lee was in full retreat either for Richmond or for another strong po- sition. Our troops were at once sent in pur- suit, and soon came up with the rebel rear guard. Gen. Grant would pursue vigorously. though his army was greatly fatigued The captures of the glorious battle of Thursday when Hancock so galantly stormed the rebel right. are set down at from thirty to forty guns and from four to six thousand prisoners. One Major General, Edward Johnson ,and two Brir. adiers-a brother. Of Johnson and George H Stuart, of Maryland-are among the captured officers. Our losses had been very heavy. but no computation could be made with any degree of correctness. A dispatch was read in the army on Thnrday, announcing that Gen. Sigel had destroyed the railroad between Lynchburgh and Charlottesville, forty miles below the lat ter place.

 Gen. Butler, at latest accounts, on Thursday, was moving on Fort Darling. Gen. Kautz's cav airy had been sent to destroy the Danville Rail- road at the bridge over the Appomattox.

 We have the following dispatch by telegraph dated Washington, May 14th:

 Between nine and ten thousand prisoners arrived at Belle Plain to-day. The roads be tween Fredericksburg and the battle field are thronged with captured ''graY backs"" on their way to the rear. We have captured thus far nearly l5,000 prisoners. The rebel dead and wounded cover the country for miles around. The dead are unburied.

 Latest news received here is up to 9.30 Fri day morning. At that time the battle bad not been renewed. Our forces were rapidly pur suing Lees hungry army, which was retreat ing towards Gordonsvile. Rebel trains con-l tain no prisoners, and the further they go| back, their chances grow small by degrees and| beautifully less. Our cavalry and infantry areI hundreds and thousands of prison ers The Rebel killed and wounded have all fallen into our hands, to the number of 35 900 ] The rebels were driven from the field, and had| no time even to bury their dead.

 Lees forces commenced to retreat Friday night at o'clock, and his rear column was seen to leave SpottsyIvania at daylight Satur Saturday morning.

 The rebel General Longstreet was wounded in the right breast, and carried off the field. his command had learned that"

The enemy made his appear ance on the 18th on the Shreveport Road. and drove in our advance cavalry. Gen: McCler nand met them with his command, when they withdrew without fighting. The armies, how ever, were in close proximity, and the pickets were constantly firing. A battle was hourly expected. Gen. Banks was hit by piece of shell in the battle of Norritt's Bluff. on the

Itis twen-l |ty or twenty-two miles east of Orange Court house. about fourteen miles southwest off |Fredericksburgh, and by the course of thn roads, sixty-fve miles north-north-west off Richmond.

 MoNDAY.-The dispatches from Gen. Grant come up to Saturday morning at 615 o'clock. During the day the advance of Hancock deve- Hoped the fact that the rebel army had fallen back four miles. There was TO engagement during Friday and the department has no in Ltelligence of any general officer having been killed in the terrible engagement of Thursday. During Friday night an important maneuvre was made in sending the fifth and Sixth Corps Ito our left, and an attack was to have been made at daylight, but no sound of battle was heard during Saturday at either Belle Plain or sFredericksburgh. and it is therefore supposed that Lee had retreated still further The move. ment and attack, had they been successful, would have placed our army in Lees rear, and |compelled his retreat upon Lynchburgh instead Bof Richmond. Some definite idea of the losses inflicted on the rebels may be gathered from sthe additional fact. stated in Mr. Stanton's irst dispatch, that over 1000 prisoners, including 400 officers, with Maj. Gen. Johnson and Brig sGen. Stuart, had arrived at Belle Plain.

 Sheridan has done his work in the most thorough manner. Getting in the rebel rear without difficulty, he seems to have done as he { pleased, despite the whole rebel cavalry force ! He destroyed both railroads for miles burned : four bridges from 20 to 200 feet long burned several depots captured and destroyed supplies Ito the amount.of one and half million ratons: entered the Notifications of Richmond: on looming out met Stuart's whole force masSed ment the rebels were routed, and our forces pursued their way lesurey towards Bottom $ Bridge. and have since reported to Gen. Butler I lat Turkey Bend on James River The Rich mond papers of the 18th announce the death sof Stuart. the rebel cavalry leader, from wounds received in battle.

 The news that Gen. Thomas has occupied sDalton is confirmed and we have the further Intelligence via Cincinnati, that our forces have scaptured about five thousand prisoners and ten sor twelve pieces of artillery. The official re port from Gen. Sherman. transmitted through 1.-the War Department is clear and distinct It lis dated near Resaca, May l4, and it states that sby flank movement on Resaca Johnston had lbeen obliged to evacuate Dalton, and onr forces were in his rear and front. The weather was fine. and the troops in admirable order

 Advices from Gen. Butler, by way of Fort Iress Monroe, to 18th inst, stated that there ehad been no fighting since the 1lth inst But Ilater and official dispatches from Gen Butlnr state that he is still in front of the enemy's works at Drury's Bluff.

The |enemy have r tired into their square redoubts. upon which Gen. Butler is bringing his artl- Ilerv to bear.

 The news from Gen. Sherman is favorable land encouraging up to Saturday evening. His army had been fighting all day. with conSidera l be advantage. but no decided result.

 Stoneman is reported to have destroyed a wagon train, captured two guns, and thrashed Roddy.

 [Signed1 EDWIN NJ. STANTON, Secretary of War. TUEsDAY.-The news from Gen. Butler, rep |resents him as laying regular siege to Fort Darling, and that his Chief Engineer Gen. |Gllmore, was confident of soon having posses sion of the fortifcation.

 The situation in Virginia, as portrayed byI dispatches from Gen. Grant up to Monday morning at 8 o'clock, represents everything quiet for the last two days. The roads are ins such an impossible condition as to necessarily suspend hostilities until they improve. Our troops are in excellent spirits, and perfectly sanguine of success. Heavy endorsements of fresh troops were arriving.

Gen. Grants Recent Successes,",,"a. Since the disastrous failure in from
of Petersburg, which was due to Burn
sides incapacity, lack Of energy or o
fidelity to his supcriors, Grant ha
succeeded in.decidedly improving th'
aspect of our military affairs in Vir
ginis. s.


First, he through Sheridan
restored confidence along the upper
Potomac. Uniting half dozen de-
tached forces under one leader. and
that a good one. he has been able to
present to the enemy force too large
to be stampedcd by any mere raiding
party. Seeing this to be the case,
Lee has been dctaching troops from
near Richmond to overwhelm Sheri-
dan, feeling, doubtless, quite sure that
Grant could and would do nothing in
that vicinity. But Grant has,


Secondly, planted himself firmly in
q good position, within six miles of
Richmond, on the north side of the
James. And he will stay there until
he is ready to move nearer.


Thirdly, he has thrown a strong
force across the Weldon railroad, and
It is reported that he has dciied the
most desperate attempts on the part
Of the rebels to dislodge him. If they
can't drive him of to-day, they can
less likely do so tomorrow. We are
now, for the first time, in position
to strike the Danville railroad and
keep it broken. This is the first and
main condition Of success in the siege
Of Richmond. If we can cut off its
supplies, we can compel fair fight or
q surrender.


In the engagement to recover the
Weldon railroad, the rebel Gen. A. =.
Hill was severely wounded, and Gen
erals Heath and Lee (son of h. Z.
Lee, were killed. 1t is thought by
many that the rebels will make no
further attempt there, al that Peters
burg must soon fall.


The latest advices from Grants ar
my state that the Weldon railroad is
being thoroughly destroyed, and War
rcn is making demonstrations on the
Petersburg and Lynchburg railroad.


Secretary Stanton telcgraphs that
Gen. Hancock was heavily attacked
on the Weldon railroad on Thursday,
aud after one Of the hardest fought
battles of the war, the rebels retired
leaving their dead and wounded in
our hands. General Grant estimates
the losses of the rebels in his front,
within the past two weeks. at 10000."

THE Missouri CAuPAIGN- Persons
who are not in the habit of looking be-
yond immediate, and tangible results
upon the spot, will be apt, some of them,
to feel disappointment on account of the
withdrawal of Gen. Prices army from
Missouri


But the whole matter was wisely plan
ned, faithfully executed, and quite as
successful as could have been expected.
When the history of the war comes to be
made up, and all the bearings of events
seen together, we incline to think that
this exploit of Gen. Price will add more
to his reputation than any other. He
returns with large accession of force,
and with a larger train of baggage and
ammunition wagons than he took in
He has inflicted millions of damage upon
the Federals. He has given new hopes
to our party in that State, by showing
them they are still under the care of the
Confederacy, and that efforts will bs con-
tinually made for their redemption, in
common with other States of the South,
and proven to them that we are still
vigorous power for their relief He has
taught the enemy how vain are their
hopes of subjugation, since after near
four years of war, the population of Mis-
souri, still rises around them like the
eruptions of a volcano, and Confeder-
ate army marches through the very
bowels of the land"" and comes out
stronger than before. These are the re-
suits of the expedition as they affect
Missouri and this department, but it had
greater objects still 1t was principally
intended to relieve the armies of Gram.
and Hood, and Early just at the critical
period when their fate hung trembling
in the balance. A. j. Smiths forces
were drawn from Memphis to ST. Louis,
thus leaving Forrest free TO cooperate
with Hood, and the tide of battle in
Georgia has receded in consequence back
to the neighborhood Of the old field Of
Chickamauga. They only hold Allan
ia with a nominal garrison, and have
been obliged to relinquish any ultimate
designs of that colapaign from which
they hoped 80 much and gained so little.


Reinforcemcnts, which might have en-
ablod Sheridan utterly to overwhellna
Early and occupy tho Valley to Lynch
burg, perhaps causing the fall of Rich
mond, have been diverted to another guar
ter The necessity of troops in Nilsson
ri defeated Grants urgent call for a re-
OF 100000 incn Richmoud
still stsuds iinpregnable shsrman bids
fair to abandon Georgia. Sheridan, al
though claiming victory, has been bad
"" damaged, and has since found it i'm
possible to make any impression upon
Early Who can say whether or not
his Missouri campaign aaved the Con
.edoreey}


On the other hand, had the enemy nol
met Gen. Price in overwhelming force.
he would have continued to occupy the
State, and immense advantages would
have accrued from that to balance losses
n the Eastern department. Gen. Price
was IN position to svail himself of either
event. Affairs took the course expected.
The results have been sach as were an
ticipated, although not nois-d abroad
whilst in process of accomplishment


We think Gen. Price has managed
the expedition with eminent prudence
and discretion. lie nigh. have gained
more immediate applause perhaps by
attacking and capturing St. Louis or
Jefferson City-a sort of transient mill
tary glory, gratifying to his friends Tor
time, but would have secured no perna-
Aent benefit to the country, might have
the existence of his army,
and would in any event have bought that
glory with immense sacrifice Of lives.
All honor to Gen. Price for his prudent
discharge Of the duties be assumed. He
deserves we'll of the republic


So we repeat that the Missouri cam
paign exhibits great military sagacity on
the part of these who control the dcs-
tinies of the department,andc c,enfers honor
upon the Generals who made it so sue
cessful."

still pushed forward like reSis,leSS torrent

that not more than ten per cent. have been
dangerously wounded. and that q large number

""CARLrox,"" the intelligent war correspon
dent of the Boston Journal. writes from the
battle field in Virginia as follows


| think that Lee has depleted his forces
elsewhere to make up in some measure his re-
cent losses here. They fight desperately and
hold out with great pertinac,y. There are
vet bloody battles before us-trias Of strength
endurance and patience which will require
nerving up and bracing of all our powers. We
have been iubilant, exultant, have magnihed
success and without measuring Cur adversary
al his full strength have taken 1t for granted
that we were going TO take Richmond at once
and clean the rebels ont of the Old Dominion.
Better hold on to our enthusiasm for the pres
ent The blows which the rebels are recel-
wing are wearing out their strength 1t is n
question of time and endurance, rather than
of military science and skill.


Residents of this place inform me that the
State is nearly exhausted Of supplies. that Lee
has his main depot of supplies not at Richmond
but at Gordonsville and Lynchburgh and that
the operations of Sheridan in cutting the Cen
tral road, while il might embarrass Lee some
what, would not cut him off from his base
which is not Richmond. but Gordonsvlle and
Lynchburg A well informed gentleman says
that with the Weldon line OF road in our pos
session Lee cannot subsIst his army q great
while Time and hard pounding will break
the rebellion. Our commander has the quail
ty of endurance. When repulsed at Donelson
his right pushed back his center ready to yield.
he stormed the works with bis left and carried
them. At Pttsburg Landing, Beauregard
thought the victory was won on Sunday night
but found he was mistaken on Monday morn
ing.


At Vicksburgh, after months Of mortar f.
ring, canal digging and the repulse at Haines
Bluff, the rebels became jubilant, and settled it
that Vicksburg could not be taken ; but one
morning they found General Grant on the Big
Black. in the possession OF Jackson, and them
selves hemmed in. After months OF siege ope
rations came the victory at last. At Chatta-
nooga, we barely had foo,hold. The condition
of the army was critical, but n day all vas
changed, and our banners waved triumphantly
from lookout and Missionary Ride. But
enough We shall have reyerses, success,
bloody fields, hopes deferred, but victory al
last. Ii is better TO break the back OF the re-
bellion here into the Old Dominion, rather
than in the interior Of the South, far from the
seaboard Here we can get at the enemy I;
there the possibilities are that he would get al
Us.

In this attack Brig. Gen. Stevenson, com.

VICTORY AND PEACE.",,"|

 The past week has been one of cheering in

 tsrest to the loyal people of the Union. News

 of hotly contested httlss and glorious victo-

 ries have followed fist and followed faster with

 every days reports from the seat of war. Pub

 lie interest and expectation which have been

 lately centered in tAe movements in the shen.

 andoah valley, have not been disappointed-

 Sheridan's operatl Ions against the rebel Early

 have been sucGe ssion of victories, the de details of wh;ch, ,,as received from day to day, we have chronickd elsewhere.

 These operations as our readers know, have a direct and positive influence on the cam paign against Richmond. Lynchburg, the object of Gen. Sheridan's movement, once in possession, Richmond is practically surround ed by the Union army, and cut of from the rest of the '' Confederacy."" It's fall, therefore, can be but question of time. and that short one. The same master mind that surrounded and forced Vicksburg to surrender. can be seen in this last campaign against the rebel capital. By their own admissions, the cause ot the rebels never looked So dark to them as now. or the Union cause brighter. Let us in. yoke the aid of Heaven to our armies, to sus- tain the great cause and the brave armies that are fighting for it, in their culminat ing blows against the rebelliop. s

 Already the fruits of sherman's great vic.o- ry at Atlanta are seen in peace proposi-

 ions,"" which are authoritatively stated to have been made on the part of the Governor of Georgia to Gen. Sherman. looking to the re- turn of that State to the Union. The Rich mond papers admit trouble and fear to their cause in that direction, and are busy discussing the probabilities of rebel revolt on the part of the state authorities of more than one their of :"" Confederate States"" Generals Grant and sherman and Sheridan, and the old Viking Farragut appear to be the best ' peace men"" we can, send them, and the success of their la- bors is already beyond peradyenture.

 In view of those victories and happy omens of Peace on the basis of complete recognition of the federal authority. into what utter iasig- ni6cance and contempt fall the brawlings of such fellows as the Woods and Vallandig- hams and Seymours, and of the party which 1 is endeavoring to foist "" little Mac"" into the Presidential ofice We are all for Peace, but itmust be such Peace as our brave armies are fighting to-day to attain. a nd under God, and with our help. shall be speedily achie- we'd. The blood of those of our brethren who have fallen in the glorious struggle, cries out from the ground against any other. and woe be to those who attempt to stop the tri- umphal march of our living heroes, under the banner of the Union, to Victory and Peace."

This is among the latest dispatches received

Below We give the most important of the
dispatches


! BALTIMORE, July 1--we have nothing
from Washington but idle street stories. There
are 10 dispatches-uO papers-nO trains. The
American has information from Frederick that
the rebels were driven out yesterday. About
9 O'Clock in the morning, the advance OF Coles
cavalry dashed 10 and fight took place 10 the
streets between our troops and the small rebel
guard. resulting 10 the defeat of the latter who
were driven in The direction OF the Monocacy.
During the time the rebels were 10 possession,
their f0ragng parties were sent out into. the
country to secure horses and cattle, and came
10 with large droyes of cattle pigs and sheep.
The main street was literally filed with horses
and cattle, all Of which were driven down 10
he fordS and sent across into Virginia Brad
ley Johnsons cavalry, it is asceriained, crossed
the pike a. CAROLS manor, at 9 O'Clock yes
terday morning, with an immense train OF
captured horses, going toward the Potomac.


NEW YORK. July l3th.-Tbe Herald has the
following 10 regard to the capture of trains
south Of Hayre de Grace, Maryland, about
twelve miles from Gunpowder bridge: Pistol
shots were heard and the train was stopped
when the rebels entered, pistols in hand, and
ordered the passengers cat. As they went ont
they were re bbed of watches and money. with
cooked pistols at their heads The cars were
then set on FIRE. General VIM. B. Franklin, a
/ passenger on the first train, being asked BY the
rebels who be was, replied nobody of any &C
count The guard passed on, but Baltimore
woman told them who be was, when they re-
turned, demanded his papers, and took him 10
charge. The rebel force was about $50 strong
The lady prisoners were well treated, and ap
peared to be acquainted with many Of the
rebels, whom they greeted most afectlonatey
The rebels had 10 hesitation in taking what
they wanted from the passengers. They took
boots, coats hats, etc. Among the prisoners
were several officers, who succeeded in making
their escape. The passengers were finally
released and obliged to walk TO Bush river
more than nine miles distant.


\ reoel deserier, who represents himself a
native Of Indiana, states that the rebel force
invading the North is very large. There are
three brigades of cavalry-Brecknrid
Rhodes, and aooiher division OF infantry. Their
movements are kept a profound secret by the
officers. The general Impression is that the
object is the capture of Baltimore or Wash
ingion. This deserter belonged TO the force
which drove Hunter from Lynchburg, after
which affair large reinforcements arrived from
Richmond aud marched northward.


PHILADELPHIA, July lilo P. M.-Our
gunboats commenced firing on the rebels at
Bush Hill, on Bush river. Baltimore trains
from here, tn 5 morning, went as far as kersy
mausvie, and then returned. The uext train
went only to Wilmington. No signs of rebels
at the former place. Later advices say the
guuboats have driven the rebels from Bush
river, and recaptured one locomotive


a correspondent Of the Philadelphia Enquirer
estimates our los at the fight on the Monucacy
at 1000 mostly captured after we were hauked
The rebel loss in killed and wounded is believed
10 be fully as large as our entire loss.


! HAvRE DE GRACE, July l2.-Semi officia
intelligence has been received here that yester
day afternoon a fight was progressing sever
miles from Washington, on the Seventh street
road near Crystal Springs Parties from Blair
sixteen miles from here, report that a thousand
rebel cavalry were there last evening. Trains
are running to day between Baltimore anC

hundred and fifty feet of the Gnupowder bridge

Valley C~unn and Lees Lines.


We give to-day map Of the several points
In the Shenandoah valley and east Of the Blue
Ridge that are important in The progress OF the
struggle between Sheridan and Early. or. II
the report Of E.rly's removal be true, between
Sheridan and Longstreet That struggle is
now one Of the very deepest interest. II we
running order, then with that road, with the
Lynchburg and Petersburg road and the Ka-
nawha Canal, Lee has three lines Of supply,
and oil of these must be broken up before he
can be forced to fight on Grants own terms
the great final battle for life or death.


None Of these lines is safe. Lees greatest
apprehension lately has been for the Southsde
road, and the events Of the past few days have
shown that he had risked even tho safety OF
Richmond in order to mass his troops where they
could be used for the defence of that line. But
Sheridan's defeat OF Early, and the rapid race
up the valley, brought an unexpected danger
to the Central road, and alarmed Lee lest that
line also should be lost His fears for its
safety are apparent in the fact that scarce as
men are, and necessary as it Is that he should
hold the Southside road, he has yet sent several
thousand men to reinforce the body that be
depended upon to hold the valley and keep
open his communication by way Of Charlottes-
vile aud Gordonsville. The column that
lately swept down the valley and threatened
Washington is now posted solely with view
to cover the Central Railroad and keep It open.
1t is in strong position at Browns Gap, and
If Sheridan leaves it there and moves on he
leaves force in his rear that can cut his COM
nunications. If he attempts TO carry the posi-
tion, he must fight bloody battle at great dis
advantage.


Grant and Sheridan will end way to get
over this difficulty, as both have gotten
over others. Sheridan is perhaps nearer
to Charlottesville than Lee supposes, as
Grant is much nearer to the Southside
road than Lee would like him to be.
Lee already sees how preoarious is his hold
on the Southside road. With Grant 80 near to
that road as he now is, Lee dare not keep
large force at Burkesvile Junction, for fear
that it would be cut of; and thus Grant can
by q single march, and perhaps small fight,
close up at once the Southside and Danvillo
roads. Lee would thus be left with only one;
therefore he will take great care OF that, and
we shall have yet, NO doubt, some pretty large
operations before Sheridan destroys the road
at Gordonsvile and Charlottesville; but We can
not doubt that he will do il.


II will be seen by the order Of General
Grant, riven in the letter of our correspondent
with Sheridan, that Grant has made up his
mind to put an end ct once and forever 10 the
foolery that has so long made the valley dis
grace to as Hitherto that valley has been
justly styled the rebel granary. II has fed The
rebellion at Richmond, Il has been harbor 10

the front received by the Government here,
was embraced in the gratifying dispatch of
q. N. Tae latest unofficial news from the front
received here up to 10 a. IN. to-day, is up to noon
yestesday-Ingall's despatch to Senator Mes.
nith-giving an account of Hancock's brilliant
exploit, and stating that Burnside and Warren
were then pressing the enemy.


We, however, know further that the battle
continued until p. m, when artillery firing
was no longer heard at Belle Plain. AS the
country was suitable for the use Of artillery,
the fact that it ceased to be heard after that
hour satisfies US that the battle ended then;
and the further fact that nothing has reached
also satisfies Us that our army was pushing
forward ''on to Richmond, rather than hold.
ing its position Of the forenoon or giving back.


We may add that throughout all Of yester-
day no artillery firing was heard at Belle
Plain. This could not possibly have been the
case If the rebels had not retreated clear be.
yond the temporary reach OF Gen. Grants
guns, as Assistant Secretary Dana stated they
were getting ready to do as early as at a. m.
Of Thursday. Between theP and the North
Anna there is no ground Offering them chance
fer making an obstinate defence.


So the public may expect to hear OF the o.
currencs OF the aext fight ON that river or on
the South Anna a short distance nearer Rich.

in the series Of engagements ending on Thurs.
day last at p. m, as to compel him to seek
the CO yer Of the Richmond Notifications, Or to
retreat rapidly in the direction Of Lynchburg
and S.aunton, from which point his army has
been provisned for the most part ever since
Grant crossed the Rspidan


We may add that we do not share the appre-
hension Of many around us that Lee can make
. more obstinate defence on the North or
South Anna than he made on the Po; the lines

Ioager than that on the Po, and therefore
much wsaker-far more easily pierced or

HEADQUARTERS, ARMY PcroMAo,}",,"day. The enemy has fallen back as previ
eusly stated tothsir lines, two miles from I
Petersburg, and are making strong works
similar to those we encountered on our ar.
val here. The rebels work night and |
day, evidently expecting an attack. Rich
nond papers acknowledge heavy loss in |
officers and men on Sunday, but claim they
took 1900 prisoners. Our loss in the 5th |
corps is seven officers and so men killed
= officers and 7S4 men wounded, 50 off -
GERS and 1858 men missing The 9,h
cops lost about 800 which makes the loss
4155 in those two commands. No doubt
many will yet turn up. Craw |ord's diyi
ion sustained the greatest proportion of
losses, he having lost about 1000, mostly
prisoners.

situation Of our armies, East and West! and


what Is the prospect? We are admonished by


the financial difficulties of Mr.. Secretary Fes-
sender, the disordered condition Of the money
market and the increasing uncertainties in all
our business affairs that unless we achieve
| some decisive military victories over the re.
bellion during the present campaign we shall
need the exercise of wisdom, prudence and
patriotism in the highest degree to escape
the shock of financial revulsion and q poll
tical revolution which may sweep away all the
remaining landmarks and signal stations of


""the Union as 1t was and the constitution as it


is"" What is the prospect!


With capable, harmonious and energetic


administration we should say that the pros
pect is cheering-that the speedy demolition of
the two enfeebled armies upon which the for
tunes Of JEFF. Davis and his confederacy now


depend may be considered inevitable; that the


Treasury has passed its severest ordeal, and


that brighter days and better times will soon


dawn upon us with the crowning triumph of
the Union. We are assured that, though the
grand army Immediately under the eye of Gen.


Grant is apparently inactive, its jealous
and untiring leader is steadily working out his
great designs, and that the fruits of his labors
are already ripening; that, having relieved the
| administration Of the danger of rebel raid
| into the national capital, he will lose no time
in resuming active operations against Peters
burg and Richmond. The communications Of
Lee with Georgia are as essential to his safety
as his triple lines of intrenchments; and, to
maintain thoso Communications ar rooovor
them, he must, when the alternative is present
ed, come out and give battle or abandon Rich
mond to save his army. He will be compelled
to assail the intrenchments which threaten his
complete isolation from the South, instead of
awaiting an assault or the tedious approaches
OF regular siege. The single thread of the
Danyile railroad is now the only military line
OF connection left between Richmond and the
States below. This will be shortly cut off, and
then we may look for the solution of the cam
paign in Virginia


The lately gathered wheat harvest in that
State will doubtless enable General Lee to
draw supplies for a month or two from LYNCH
burg and the Shenandoah valley though not,
perhaps, beyond month or two, in conse-
quence Of the recent destructive Union raids
over all the country between Lynchburg and
Staunton, and thence down the Shenandoah
valley to the Potomac But, with
General Sherman's army at Atlanta, the
question of an open railroad or two to Georgia
becomes one Of greater moment to General
Lee than the immediate subsistence Of his
troops. He must soon reopen his communica-
tions southwark by another movement upon
- ~,
the lines Of General Grant, or be Will be too
late. The close reconnaissance Of Washington
made by Early and Breckinridge has disclosed
a tempting prize to a larger movement in the
same direction. BY the railroads to Fredercks-
burg and Culpepper Court House, and thence
by forced marches, by way Of the Potomac
fords near Leesburg, the whole OF Lees army
proper might possibly even now be moved to
the rear of Washington in time to carry the
city before General Grant could send up ""a
body Of bis veterans sufficient to relieve it.


Here, then, at Washington, as from the be-
ginning OF the war; is the weak pcint 10 our
military situation: and this weakness Of the
national capital lies in the weakness of tie

ARMY OF THE POToMAC NEAR PErERsBURG,)


Tuesday, June q, 1864. {


HOW WE FAILED TO TAKE PETERSBURG.


When, early on Wednesday morning. the


Second Corps had effected the passage of the


James River at Windmill Point, Gen Hancock


was met by dispatch from the COMMANDING


General, directing him that if provisions had


arrived, he should ration his men before pro-


ceeding toward Petersburg. Just at this time


he received information. seemingly reliable


and conveyed, / believe, by an engineer officer


who had just come up from the pontoon


bridge, to the effect that the transports had ar


rived with supplies. This fact Gen Hancock
| communicated to the Commanding General


stating that he would soon begin issuing ra-


tions, and would then move forward as di-
| rected.


The information proved to be mstake-a
| lamentable mistake-the transports had not ar.


rived. Yet this simple error caused delay in
| Hancock's corps of five hours and a half His


column Joined Gen. Smiths troops on the
morning OF Thursday. But had he been up
earlier by the difference noted of five and
| half hours, he would have reached the front at
| 1880 on the evening of Wednesday, which was
precisely the moment at which General Smith


made his attack


| Thursday morning revealed a new actor on
| the stage-a new element introduced into the
problem.


While our troops were coming up during the
| night Beauregard also came up, and the re-
connoiSsances of Thursday morning also de-
veloped him in force in line hastily thrown
up during the night, and a little closer TO the
town, but still strong enough to check our ad-


vance. The mi'ia was relieved-Beauregard s
! force numbering $4,000 men, and reinforced
| by the addition of BushrOd JOhnsOn's com.


mand, took their places Men of very differ
ent mettle these. from the crude soldiers to
| whom the defence of the works eff Petersburg
had been intrusted!


1t is true the assaults of the two succeeding
days drove the enemy from their temporary po-
siton, but it was only to fall back on a line
hugging the town, which Beauregard was pre-
| pairing in the meantime. and which, constantly
| strengthened during the interval that has since
elapsed stands between us and the desired
| point, as formidable an obstacle as we have yet
| encountered


This line was assaulted along our entire
| front on Saturday last in an engagement, the
details of which | shall presently recount The
attack was similar in character to that made
| on the lines of the Chickahominy on the 3rd
| instant. 1t resulted. like that, in serious loss
oflife, and its issue was of similar kind-that
| Is, we failed to carry our point.


like untOward fortune attended the attack
of Gen. Butler on that portion of the rebel
| position lying north of the AppomatoX. Meet
ing. like Smith, with but feeble resistance from
| the local troops in the attack on Thursday, he
seized the Petersburg and Richmond Railroad,
| and destroyed it in part; but Longstreets arri-
val compelled Gen. Butler to withdraw to his
orig nal line.


PETERSBURG NOT BEsIEGED
If this outline of the present situation be III
| telligible, it will make manifest how absurd is
| the notion which has been expressed in the
| northern press, that Petersburg is in state of
siege. Such phrase. as marking mere atul-
| tificatiOn of idea might be allowed to pass
| noticed; but it is calculated to give altogether
| erroneous impressions, both OF the present po-
| sitiOn and of the future prospects OF the army.
| SIEGE in any other than the loosest use of
| the term, can only be applied 10 an army III
veSting city and planted on or interrupting
| its communications. Now, we neither invest
| Petersburg nor are we planted on nor have we
| interrupted its communications.


Begin with the Northern communication
| the Petersburg and Richmond Railroad This
was seized by Gen. Butler at Port Walthal, and
| the track torn up for some distance But Beau
| regard was able to repulse Butler, and this
road, as is conveyed in an official dispatch from
| Gen. Lee to Mr. Davis, has again been put in


running order. Looking to the southern side,
| the communications of Petersburg are by the
Petersburg and Suffolk and the Petersburg


and Danville roads. Looking to the western
side, Its communications are by the Petersburg


and Lynchburg Railroad. Beginning with


these in order, the Petersburg and Suffolk road
is in our pOssessiOn-the left wing of our army


rests across it; but it forms no part of
| the communications proper Of Peters


blrg, because the terminus, Suffolk,
has for a long time been in our possession.
There remain. therefore the Petersburg and
Weldon and the Petersburg and Lynchburg
roads. These are its real communications.
| Now, we have touched, and in the present
situation can touch neither of these. To tap
| fho ch,,r, o.,1N Nn1I nilJr
| development of our line several miles to the
! left. To tap the Petersburg and Lynchburg
| road is at present impracticablc ard probably
| it will be impossible to do more than make it
| the object OF visitatiOuS from raiding parties,
| because an extension so far to the left would
seriously endanger our own communications,
| and the maxim does not allow Cs to expose
| our own communications in operating against
| those of the enemy. In this condition of
| things, to speak of Petersburg as being under


siege is simply an abuse OF language.
| l have adverted to the nature of Beaurc-
| CARDS defence of Petersburg. This has been
| a matter of remark with the ablest heads in
| this army, it rivals his defence of Charleston.
and stamps him as one of the most skillfill
| soldiers in the rebel army. And certainly this


estimate is not weakened, but, on the contrary.


heightened by fact which has astoniShed


every one here. 1t is this the army of the
| Potomac has not yet met in front OF Peters
| burg single man belonging to Lees army
| prOper-not man of the three corps of
| Longstreet, Ewell or Hill. The force defend
| ing Petersburg consists exclusively of the army
of Beauregard, with such accession outside of
| the army of Northern Virginia as he may have
received.


To the natural query as to where Lees army
| is, can speak with no fullness of assurance
There may be corps in front of Butler, and
it is well known that, five days ago, Ewells
| corps was sent after Hunter The other corps
| is probably preparing another definite line, in
case Petersburg should fall."

Another Victory In the VAfley-ThS


Battle OF Fishers Hill


Once more we have glorious news from the
Shenandoah valley. Sheridan has gained still
another victory over the redoubtable Early-a
victory that he characterizes as every COM
plete and victory that goes far toward tho
accomplishment of what we expected of Gen
eral Sheridan-the actual dispersion of Early's
whole force. Only darkness prevented such
an actual dispersion in this fight


Fishers Hill, the scene OF this last victory,
is little ways beyond Strasburg. and is q field
on which it is reasonable to suppose that the
enemy had the ground greatly In his favor It
is position that EARLY long ago chose to fight
upon when he should be forced to fight any
where near it. 1t will be remembered that
when forced up the valley in August. and just
before he received his last reinforcement from
Lee, he had concentrated bis force ct this
point, and evidently intended to dispute our
passage there. He had then. probably recon
noitred and studied the ground oD which he
has now been beaten; for all his advantages of
position and fortifcation have not enabled
him to arrest the triumphant progress Of Sheri-
dams victorious column.


Sheridan's cavalry, at the latest accounts be-
fore the news Of the battle, were beating up
Early's fanks and Crook was feeling his front
Sheridan thus learned where Early was, and
then went at him at once, he is not t!mid
fighter. Crook swept on the cnemy's flank like
an avalanche, and the veteran Sixth and Nine
teenth corps stormed tho position in front.
Sixteen guns were taken, and that fact is
positive assurance Of the complete demoraliza
ton Of Early's command.


1t was unwise in Early to fight again 80 near
the scene Of his former discontinue Had be
not been tempted by his previously chosen and
reconnoitred neld, but kept doggedly on his
retreat, he might have gotten to Staunton in
time to organize there . resistance that would
have bothered Sheridan very greatly; but hav
ing been thus badly beaten and even broken
up at Fishers HILL it is not possible that he
can make another stand at Staunton or any
where else In the valley, and thus Sherdans
way to Lynchburg is open. Sheridan will thus


in all probability, having settled Early, settle
also the fate Of the rebel capital.

General sheridan's victsry-Its Import


ance I'm Reference 60 Rich mond.
General Sheridan's brilliant victory over the
rebel army under General Early, in the shenan-
doah valley, is q telling blow in support of
General Grant below Richmond. The battle
(of which the first information received here
was In the despatch Of the HERALD correspond
cnt in the field, published yesterday morning)
is described by General Sheridan as ""a most
stubborn and sanguinary engagement"" lasting
""from early in the morning until Eve o'clock
in the evening"""" That it was ""a most stub
born"" conflict is apparent from the sanguinary
results on both sides, and especially in the
heavy losses of the enemy in killed and
wounded. For instance, their loss of four
generals in this battle among the slain is a
greater loss, il we are not mistaken, in generals
killed than either side has suffered in any other
engagement Of the war, not excepting even the
stupendous and terribly destructive three days
struggle at Gettysburg.


In this desperate tenacity with which the
rebels fought for their position, the serious
consequences to their cause Of their complete
defeat are strongly suggested. OF itself the
position which Early held was of no value
whatever; but, having chosen it as a
line Of defence IN which to accept bat
tie, in losing it, after bis disastrous struggle
to maintain it, he loses the Shenandoah valley.
An army, even Of veteran soldiers, defeated and
driven from the field as his he's been, we may
safely say, without some rest, reorganization
and reinforcements, is in no condition to risk
another engagement with the victorious adver-
sary. The badly defeated rebel general must
therefore retire with his shattered columns to
some safe place up the valley, if he can find it,
till reinforced from Rch nond, or abandon all
the intervening country to go to the relief of
Lee. In any event, we dare say that General
Grant has arranged his plans to battle him and
spoil his calculations.
: But here the inquiring reader may ask why
is it that Early, with his twenty-five or thirty
thousand men, has remained 80 long In the
Shenandoah valley, when evidently Lee has
been and is sorely in need of him and his troops
for the defence OF Richmond? We answer that
Early, in the Shenandoah valley, was
charged with very important role in
support Of Lee In the first place, he
was charged with the gathering of the
wheat harvest of the valley for the subsis..
ence of Lees army. In the next place, the
presence Of a rebel column of twenty five or
thirty Thousand men lowering near the Upper
Potomac required at least an equal Union force
to watch its movements. Next, by some sue
cessful trick Of strategy, there was a chance
that the Union force might be decoyed into
snare, cut to pieces, or driven heiter-skelter
back into the defances at Washington. necessi-
tating another call upon General Grant for US.
sistance. Next, by the occupation Of the Bal
timore ano Ohio Railroad Early would mate
rally retard the reinforcement of Grants
lis supplies from that enarter. Next, by stand
ing guard near the outlet of the Shenandoah
valley Early protected Leo on the north and
west, and especially against another hostile
descent upon Lynchburg-an important depot
of supplies to Richmond. Finally, as the raids
OF Early Into Maryland and Pennsylvania had
always yielded the most desirable stores of
plunder he, by lowering near tue border,
might have other opportunities for additional
cap lures Of no rses and cattle, -four and corn,
drugs, dry goods and groceries, hats, boots and
SHOES.


These inducements, objects and necessities
will show that, Notwithstanding the heavy pres
sure upon Lee, his lieutenant. Early, has been
doing good service in the Shenandoah valley,
both in the subsistence and defence Of Rich
mond. Dislodged and put to rout from his
chosen position on the Opequan, an admirable
stream for defensive military purposes, Early
bas sacrificed all the advantages suggested
The Baltimore aud Ohio Railroad is relieved
and will speedily be reopened; the Maryland
and Pennsylvania border is safe now and hence
forth, we doubt not, to the end Of the war;
General Sheridan is pursuing the broken and
demoralized fragments Of the late menacing end
defiant rebel army in his front and on his flank;
and the only question Of DOUBT remaining ls
whether the heels OF Early win serve him bet.

Our Successes East and West.


Our latest advices from the Army Of tie
Potomac indicate that there was . lull In the
fighting on Friday. Lee, in tho hard nght Of
Thursday, evidently found his position at
Spottsylvania Court House untsnable, and re-
treated on Thursday night He was pursued
on Friday, and found in position four miles
further south, and apparently disposed still to
dispute our advance General Meade doubt.
less refers to this still defiant atttade Of Lee In
his order to the army, in which no tells the
soldiers that ""tSeir work IL not over"" and
that the enemy has yet to be overcome""
But certainly he is neither hasty nor unduly
sanguine when he expresses his confidence
that ""the future efforts Of the army will result
in success.n Lees armv Ia 0raatlv raan~na In
numbers, burdened with . portion OF its
wounded; its supplies Of food, and perhaps
ammunition also, are inadequate to its wants;
is can expect no reinforcements, and it would
seem IS II only some miracle In warfare could
now turn the tide Of success in it, favor.


Secretary Stanton informs us that It Is not
true. As reported, that General Sigel has cut
Lees communications with Lynchburg. 81
non zero. ben trovato. It ought to have
been true and might have been the last feather
in the scale. Lees communication with Rich
mond are certainly cut, and 1t d now reported
that he has received his supplies from Lynch
burg entirely since Grant has been south Of
the Rapidan. Had that road been cut his army
would now have been four days without ra-
tions.


Gen. Butler is doing bravely before Fort
Darling. His despatch to the War Department,
dated at eight o'clock yesterday morning an
nounces the fact that Gen. Gilmore, by bril-
liant flank movement, got possession of the enc
my's works on the right on Friday night, and
held his position. He sends another despatch,
dated ten o'clock, in which hs states that ct
eight O'Clock In the morning-even while he
was debating the first mcssage-Gen Baldy
Smith had assaulted and taken possession Of
their outer lines, driving the rebels into three
square redoubts, upon which, at last accounts,
Gen. Butler had brought his artillery to bear.


From General Sherman We have . continu-
ance Of good news McPheBon's movement
on Resaca BY way Of Snake Creek Gap had
compelled Johnston to add ono more to
his innumerable retreats, and TO evacuats
Dalton In hurry. Our forces were In pursuit.
and there was every appearance that Johnston
would be compelled to fight on disadvanta-
geous terms We captured nve thousand pris-
oners and ten or twelve pieces OF artillery.
In East Tennessee the troops under General
Scho6eld defeated the enemy and drove them
into North Carolina, after . hard fight, on the
9TH instant.


Thus, - the news eliminates. il gives assu.
rance Of success st al points.

Unless these abominsble practices OF the

period. aud tho minds Of men are inAamed BY
unwontedi passions. As to the attacks upon
Mrs. Lincoln. they only injure, and that seri-
ously. the side from which they emanate. She
has outlived and lived down. by her modest
courtesy and gentleness, the ISLANDERS with
| WHICH secession sympathizers at Washington
assailed her on her advent to the White House.
Let us fight it out as men. says General Sher-
man in bis recent pitby and characteristic let
ter to General Hood; and so will say oil de-
cent citizens in reference to these attacks upon
the matron and wife who is by national
comfy, the FIRST lady Of our land. We feel con
fident that General Mcclellan muss disapproye


this style Of warfare iu his behalf, and, how
ever reluctant he may be to interfere in such
matters, would suggest to him the proprety OF
giving his partisans hint to Improve their
manners.


AS to the attacks upon General Mcclellan
made by the Lincoln organs, they are foul and
disgraceful beyond any parallel in partisan
warfare Is it really the wish Of the Lincoln
papers to persuade the American people and
the world at large that every citizen who sup


ports General McClellan's claims to the Presi-
dency is at heart traitor desiring the disrup-
ton Of our Union and the success of the jeff


Davis conspiracy. Or how long do the chief
organs of this Lincoln faction believe that they


can with impunity pursue the work Of villifying

condition Of the public mind any spark may
serve to kindIe conhagration that will not be
extnguished without bloodshed. There will,


we fear, be attacks upon the offices of the
newspapers engaged in these scurrilous out


pourings and we shall have the misfortune


to see the editor Of one Lincoln organ sus-
pended on a lamppost at his own corner,
while the editor OF another Lincoln organ
keeps him company on the lsmppost oppo-
site. Every act OF violence thus committed
in the democratic metropolis will be re-
taliated in some one or other Of those rural
districts in which the Lincoln men are strong,
and, as the upshot of the whole scandalous
quarrel, the loyal States will be plunged into
riot anarchy and indiscriminate lynching.
These consequences we regard as inevitable
unless greater moderation of tone be imme-
diately evinced by the partisan writer's Of the
Lincoln aud Mcclellan press.


Everything Coming Down with .


Crash.


Gold has been coming down for several days
past and is now considerably below two hun
dred. Before long it must be at one hundred
and forty. which is about the Legitimate pre-
MUM. The prices of everything are coming
down with gold. Stewart has marked his


goods down to two hundred; but he must mark
them lower now that gold has again fallen.
Provisions are coming down. The butchers
and bakers are coming down. The tailors and
hatters aud shoemakers are coming down.
Those who want to buy should wait for the
crash. IL will soon come. Spectators and
, speculating merchants and speculating dealers
are beginning to come down, and the people


generally will be benefited. Everything is
coming down, and coming down with crash.
The reason OF all this is that the rebellion is


coming down. Early has come down already.
80 has Mobile, IL the current reports be true.


Grant will move presently, and then Lee will
come down Then Sherman will come down
on Hood like thunderbolt, and nothing will
be left Of she so-cslled confederacy but few


starved negroes, good deal of waste paper,


and the mortal remains Of JEFF Davis. Then


Macmillan will come down from the throne

The armies of the South now in the field
are composed of the following bodies OF
troops Longstreets corps, A. =. Hills corps
and the troops under Beauregard, holding
the lines defending Richmond and Peters.
burg, $4,000 infantry, 10000 cavalry, and
800 guns, in all $1,000; Early's troops in
the valley. Is 600 men; total of Lees army
proper, 10000 men. Breckinridge's forces
in Southwestern Virginia, 10000 men;
militia at Lynchburg, 5000 men; total under
General Lees immediate orders, l02, 900
men. Troops under Beauregard and Hood
in the West, $4,000; in Arkansas and Mis-
souri,, under Sterling Price, 10000 men; at
Charleston and Savannah, $4,000 men; at
Mobile, IL 900 men; total, 10000 men.
Grand total of troops Of the Confederacy in
the field, 2l4,000.


AVAILABLE MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE SOUTH.


The above is the present actual strength
of the Confederate armies, but it is by no
means the extent of the available military
power of the South. The South has had in
arms, since the beginning of the war, $50, 900
men Oncluding the above 1000, and
$4,000 or 60 900 more, who are now prison
ers in our hands, and SIS 900 men who
have been killed and disabled during the
progress of the wary If the tables in my
letter Of September 18th are correct, and
their accuracy has never been disputed, the
South still has, therefore, reserve of $50, 900
white men of the proper military age. The
experience of four years of war, therefore,
shows that the South is abundantly able to
keep on foot armies equal in numbers to
those now in the field for four years more
at least. These facts will be brought before
the Confederate Congress at an early day,
and in an elaborate and detailed shape, as
arguments against the proposed measure Of
arming the slaves as soldiers.


ED AT PRESENT.


There is no probability, however, that that
measure will les adopted, or even passed for
adoption. The universal sentiment of the
South is against it. All the prominent pub
lie men Of the South, now at Richmond,
concur in the conviction which is entertained
by General Lee and all the other prominent
rebel military leaders, that the slaves have
been and will continue to be far more useful
to the Confederate cause as agricultural
laborers than as soldiers. 1t is absolutely
necessary that certain portion of the COM
muuity should be employed in raising grain
and rearing stock, or, in a word, in produc-
tive industry; and the experience of four
years has demonstrated that the slaves con
'titute that portion Of the Southern commu-
'ity which can be so employed to the best
advantage of the States at large. To with
lraw them from these pursuits it would make
it necessary to withdraw white men from the
army to take the places of the slaves on the
farms and plantations."

The Rebel Movctncnt upon washing.
ton-The Prospect.
From all the conflicting, exciting and per-
picking reports, rumors, conjcctures and inven-
tions, in reference to the daring advance Of the
rebels through Maryland to the vory gates of
Washington, we gather these important and
gratifying facts:


Fnst-That General Grant gave the infor-
nation to the War Office at Washington nearly
two weeks ago Of this daring and desperate
enterprise Of the enemy.


Sscondly-That in consequence Of this
positive and seasonabe Information the
needful precautions have been adopted
for the immediate protection Of Washing
ton, Independently Of the forces Of General
Hunter, General Sigel and tie auxiliaries
moving forward from New York and Philadel-
phia.


Tnirdly-That General Hunters column
from Lynchburg, having crossed over the
mountains Of West Virginia to the Ohio river,
aud passed round by way Of the Baltimore
aud Ohio Railroad, has in reality arrived at
Martinsburg, in convenient rapport with
General Sigcl at Harper's Ferry.


We dare say, too, that, a. Baltimore has evi-
IDENTIFY become q secondary chapter in the pro.
grammc of this rebel invasion, some thousands
OF veteran troops have been detailed from that
city to the movable defensive army of Wash
ington; and from still another circumstance
we are led to the conclusion that the national
capital is positively secure. We refer to the
patriotic proclamation just issued by Governor
Parker, OF New Jersey, in which he reasonably
infers that, as no call has been made upon him
for reinforcements from Washington or the Gov
ernor or Maryland it must, be. because il has
been considered that no immediate assistance
from New Jersey is needed to expel the in
vaders. Without standing upon ceremony.
however, Governor Parker calls upon the pee
pie OF New Jersey to put themselves in readi
uess for immediate contributions TO the national
army Of Washington; aad in thus proceeding
he will comm and the hearty appreciation Of all
loyal men.


Governor Seymour, Of New York, though
late in the day, speaks in the same patriotic
tone; hut still we must confess that, in our
Judgment, but for the bane ul influences of party
politics on both sides, There would have been
all along spirit of cooperation between the
federal authorities at Washington and the
State and city authorities Of New York which
would have rendered DO movement here at the
eleventh hour necessary for the protection of
Washington or Baltimore. In the next place,
the lamentable helplessness OF Maryland and
the sluggishness of Pennsylvania in moving to
the rescue are difficult to he accounted for,
and are without excuse, except upon the mise
rxble plea OF perfect confidence in President
Lincoln and the War Office in any event 70
take care of the White House.


Assured. however, that General Grant has
supplied the deficiencies of the administration in
thus matter, we expect within the next twenty
four hours to hear that the rebcls, driven from
the back door of Washington, are casting
about for q way Of escape. In this anticipa-
ton, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and
New York should at once cooperate 10 effect
such concentration of forces against the re-
tIring enemy as to dospoil him at least Of every
particle Of his Maryland plunder in his retreat
to Richmond. Let this be done, and We are
sure that General Grant will speedily electrify
the nation by the crowning victory Of the war.


GENERAL MCCLELLAN FOR A LITTLE An
TIErAM-Who is the commander OF our forces
In Maryland Is there any one entrusted with
the general duty Of concentrating our forces
and fighting the rebels now in that State, or is
every general to look after his own little dis
trict, and is fight with the enemy to be all
mere matter Of accident as to where II takes
place, who makes II, and how II results Such
is the appearance just now; aud, in the ab-
sence Of any definite commander, we nominate
TOT the place Major General Geo. b. Mcclellan.
In the summer Of 1862 the government en-
trusted this soldier with the commander ""sll
the troops for the defence Of the national
capital"" and he discharged his duties in
manner quite satisfactory TO the country. We
are deluged with communications that point to
him as the flt person for such . command
now. It is certain that II he were appointed
there would be no scarcity Of men. Undoubt-
edly IL would be very bitter pill TO the radi
calls TO have such an appointment made; but
we suppose they would rather see Il made
than to 20 20 Washinaton and peril their own
precious lives for ""ths dafsA@e of tAs national
capital"""

was cleared. This it was thought, would


be an end to the affair; but in two minu-


tes two of the soldiers appeared at the


door with muskets. Neil and the bar
tender apprehending more serious trouble,
started for the hall outside of the saloon


Just then the sergeant made his appear

Of the soldiers fred. The ball struck
Neil in the left breast, near the nipple,
and passed through his heart and lungs,
and entirely through his chest. The
death-dealing missile lodged in the rear
of the bur, breaking some bottles in its
course. Neil walked to tho hall, dis
tance Of about fifteen feet, when he fell
and instantly expired Thus tragicaly
ended the life Of Alex. Neil. His age was
about twenty-one or two years. He bore
an excellent reputation for sobrety, strict
attention TO his business, and for his
habitual quiet domeanor. His presence
in the saloon was on matter OF business.
He was in the employ of II. h. Schram,
Esq, who was witness Of the tragedy,
md who sincerely mouFns his untimely
death. The soldier who fired the fatal
shot was soon arrested, handcufIed, and
imprisoned. The balance of the squad
took possession of the sidewalk on the
north side Of the public square, and under
the direction of their Lieutenant, num-
ber of our citizens were assaulted, and
arrested and placed under guard aud a
genuine reign Of terror inauguratcd.


1t being near the time for the train to |
leave, they proceeded to the railroad do.
pot, Of which they took possession, |
and de6ed and one 10 arrest them. |
Precautions were at once taken to
prevent their taking possession of the
cars and engine by locking the doors Of
the former, and uncoupling the latter and
sending ii down the track. While they
held the depot, it was at the peril of life
that any one entered it. They threatened
10 fire into the crowd Of passengers and
citizens around the depot, and carried
their threat into execution by firing at Mr..
p, Stockwell, the charge passing near his
head. All these proceedings created an
intense excitement in the village The
civil authorities were powerless to arrest
the desperadoes. Finally, a file of twenty
men of the Veteran Reserve Corps, under
the command of Lieutenant Dimmick,
upon the requisition Of the Sheriff, march
ed to the depot and arrested them. They
with their Lieutenant, were soon lodged
in the cells of the county jail. Our COM
munity then experienced feeling of re-
lief; but their indignation was not ap
peased, aud for time there were strong
indications that Judge Lynch"" would
establish his court, and order summary
proceedings But respect for law and
order prevailed, and tho offenders were
left in the hands of the civil authorities,
by whom they we're arrested, and are to
be tried. We understand that the sold.
iers on their way here from 6aokett's Har-
Dor, manifested the same reckless dis
regard of human life which eliminated in
the death of young Neil. Among other
acts, we learn that on stopping at the old
Blanchard House, MIR. Terry, a highly re-
spectacle colored man, living in that
vicinity, they proposed to carry into effect
certain proceeding which he escaped by
mounting his horse and putting him to
the top of his speed. As he was leaving,
one Of the soldiers fred at him, but missed
his aim. There are rumors of other des-
perate deeds committed by them, but
which we will not record. Such are the
outlines Of the most reckless, lawless,
tragical affair that ever transpired in our
village. 1t would not of course be pro-
per for us, in advance of judicial proceed
lngs to characterize the crime which re-
suited in the death of MIR. Neil. While We
are writing this Con Wednesday after

ton fixes total losses of Army of Potomac in
killed and wounded and missing. up to com
mencement Of battle of 18th. At q. 900. The
Star says. from fact that no cannonading
was heard yesterday from front, il is believed
Lee is shifung his position and taking care
to put himself out of fighting range. Public

Lee has been SO weakened as TO COMPEL him
to seek cover in Richmond Qualifications, or
retreat rapidly in direction of Lynchburg or
Staunton, from which place his army has re-
ce;ved suppl es since Grant crossed the Rap
idan.

ton. Dead and dying everywhere in great
numbers. Men are lying in some places in
piles threeiand four deep. many wounded in
divers parts. Enemy removed large num-
of dead and wounded during Thursday from

a half ground in advance of that occupied the

Yankees Were promptly checked by our
infantry, and they retired to their line
beyond the church. Saturday morning
at daylight, the heavy booming Of artil-

with the hoarse roar of artillery.

feet on the NItIitAry Stu ntion.",,"


General sherdan's pursuit of Early is likely
to be as effective as his recent vic ory was
complete. He has rot only sent the enemy


""whirling through Winchester"" but he is
whirl ing them on towards Staunton at q most
pitless rate. Early fought till night on Mon
day, and doubtless marched his men all Monday
night. All day Tuesday Sheridan's cavalry
must have been at Earlys heels; for on Tues
day at three p N. Sheridan was crossing a
| stream thirty miles south Of where the battle
| began on Monday. Such pursuit continued
| through two OF three days, might very probably


end in the complete dispersion OF Early's force,
and leave Sheridan without an opponent aud
with an open road TO Lynchburg. Sheridan
has plenty of cavalry; ana no man in the coun-
try knows better how to use that arm, 80 aw-
fully efficient. for just such service as is now
required of. it in the valley. Indeed Major
General Sheridan will now in all probability
show as no one has hitherto shown in this war,
bow much an energetic pursuit can accomplish
toward the absolute destruction Of beaten
army


Our victories in August and September
make our record for those two months one of
almost unparalleled splendor. Lee beaten
three times in many desperate attempts to
drive Grant from the Weldon road; Hood


beaten three times in his attempts to break
Sierman's advance, and a fourth time in the
decisive battle that gave us possession OF At
lanta; our triumphs at Mobile, and, finally.
Sheridan's magnificent success in the valley
all these make a series OF victories that are the
surest guarantee the people can have Of peace.
But Sheridan's victory is something even bet
ter than the splendid climax to this splendid
series. 1t is victory whose effects upon the


situation at Petersburg will be immediate and
| great. and il is one that shows us exactly how
\ distinct is General Grants grasp Of the whole


situation in Virginia. Sheridan, as we have


repeatedly shown, could have beaten Early a
/ month ago as easily as he did on Monday last;
but Grant was not ready for the victory then.
He used the valley to amuse Lee, and when
that amusement was no longer necessary to his
purpose he made Lee pay for it. He has been
ahead Of Lee at every step, and is still ahead /;
tor il will doubtless prove that Sheridan 8
battle has been exactly timed for its effect else
where than on the immediate field where it
was fought.


That effect will be seen in the triangle com
prsed between Richmond, Petersburg and
| Lynchburg. Sheridan pushing Early toward
! Staunton, or beyond 1t, toward Lynchburg,


will very imperatively divide the attention that


Lee now gives to Grant. Lee will then be in a
/ very uncomfortable dilemma. II he sends out


any force to stay Sherdan-to save Early and
| Lynchburg-Grant will take that opportunity
\ TO get the last OF Lees railroads. If he does not
| send ont such force, Sheridan may very prob,
| ably get hold Of the same railroad at its Lynch.
J burg end; and so, in either event, Lee mus,


get away from Richmond--if he can For all
| this to be soon done IL is necessary that Lee


should not be reinforced by the veterans under
Hood, whom Sherman has for little time left
idle Sherman's truce expires to-day. and 1t is to
| be hoped that be may Immediately assume active
operations again. IL for no other purpose than
I to keep Hood's men out Of Lees army.

Washington, Dec. lSth.-Dispatches wer
received to-day from Gen. Foster, who ha,
q personal interview on A. n of Wednesday
18th, with Sherman at Fort McAllister
which had been taken by assault on the pre-
tiols day. Savannah was closely besieged
and its capture, with the rebel force there
was confidently expected. It was to be sum
moned in two days, and if not surrendered
Sherman would open his batteries upon 1t
Foster reports that Sherman's army is IN
splendid condition, having lived during the
march on turkeys, chickens. sweet potatoes,
and other good things, in the richest part OF
Georgia


Nothing further has been heard from
Thomas to .dav. Unofficial dispatches state
that the Provost Marshal at Louisville re-
ports 5000 prisoners and SO pieces Of arui-
lery as having been already secured: 1t is
ascertained that in transmitting Thomas
report last night a telegraphic mistake was
made at Louisville or Nashville, in estimat.
inc the number of our casualties. The dis.
match written by Thomas stated his whole
loss would not exceed 5000, very few being
killed


A dispatch from Lexington, KY, this
evening. states that on the 18th, at Kings.
port. East Tennessee, Burbridge had fight
with Basil DAke's brigade, formerly Nor
gan's, and routed it with loss to the enemy
Of $50 killed, wsu6ed and prisonSss, and
their trains.


New York. l9th-The Herald's CORES
pondence from Buffers headquarters, dated
Dec. 18th, says: Last evening, about O.
clock, the lines of Bre-et Major General Fer
zero, commanding at Bermuda Hundred,
were attacked by the rebels. The firing,
which was both heavy and incessant for an
hour, was mostly confined to pickets, though
there was sufficient artillery used on our side
to repel The attack Five rebel gunboats and
two rams, the Virginia and Richmond, were
distinctly observed lying under the guns of
Fort Darling yesterday, towards evening""
They are doubtless there for purpose.


The Richmond Enquirer of December 18th
has a semi i-oficial editorial in favor of arming
the slaves. 1t says Gen. Lee is in favor Of
the proposition. The Enquirer says: When
we supplicate European nations for help, we
must he prepared to receive it on their con-
ditons, which will be the abolition of slave
ry. 1t also asks: ""Shall we prolong the
war. sacrifice our children and destroy our
country for the sake of slavery"" 1t con-
cludes: I've hate, detest and despise the
enemy far more than we love slavery""


A telegram to the Richmond Whig from
Lynchburg, dated December l4th, says a
body of Yankees, returning towards Ream's q
Station, East Tennessee, encountered our
forces at East Zollicoffer Station, on Tennes-
see road, nine miles west of Bristol, where a
fight was said to be progressing at last ac-
counts.


The Richmond Sentinel of the 10th says
Foster is quiet under his failure on the Sa-
vannah Railroad. Sherman has seemingly
despaired of opening communication with the
sea at Beaufort. The capture of Fort Meal
lister is announced. Its liability to capture
has been well understood. Sherman will
now be able to get supplies by way of Ossa-
baw Sound. Should he capture Savannah
he will have exchanged a city in the interior
for city on the coast which has been CON-
pletely closed to commerce since the loss of
Fort Pulaski in 1862.


New York, l8th.-Earl Russell sent the
following reply to the dispatch of the Con-
federate Commissioners and the manifesto Of
the Southern Congress.


To j. Slidell and Dudley Marn:-I have
had the honor to receive copy which you
have sent me of manifesto issued BY the
Congress of the so called Confederate States
of Americas. Her Majesty's Government
deeply deplores the nature of the struggle
between the Northern and Southern States
of the formerly united Republic of North
America. Great Britain has since 1888 re-
manned, with the exception of a short period,
connected by friendly relations with the
Northern and Southern States. Since the COM
mencement of the civil war which broke out
in 1861, Her Majesty's Government has
continued to entertain sentiments of friend
ship equally for the North and South. Of
the cause of the rupture, Her Maiesty's Gov
ernment has not pretended to judge. They
deplored the commencement of the sanguain.
airy struggle, and anxiously look forward to
the period of its termination. Meantime they
ore convinced they must consult the interests
ofpeace and the rights of all parties by OBJ
serving strict and impartial neutrality. Such
neutrality Her Majesty has faithfully man.
tanned and will continue to maintain.


tSigned,) RUSSELL.


The London Times, speaking of Russell's
letter, finds no favor in it to either north or
South. First he snubbed the Confederates-
They are only the So called Confederate States
and have yet to establish their right to the
appellation. This. too, is a compliment to
e""o Shiou vi tue ctdteS, Dut tnere follows q
counter snub to the United States. They are
the formerly United Republic. But to saw
they were formerly united is to imply that
they are now disunited, and to acknowledge
thereby the existence of the Confederate
States. Russell seems to be apparently afraid
that neuter does not mean both, and therefore
IT he would maintain even in words strict
neutrality, to avoid any demonstration of
friendship to either belligerent.


Washington. th.-The..following report
of his operations has been received from
Thomas, dated Headquarters Army of the
Cumberland, near Spring Hill, Dec. 18th:


The enemy has been vigorously pursued
to day, but has studiously avoided any at

THR SEIZURE OF THE GEORGIA.


The seizure Of the late rebel pirate Georgia,
by the United States steamer Niagara, made in
accordance with the we'll established principle Of English
maritime law, that beligerent vessels cannot,
during the continuance OF hosNIties, be legally
transferred, as regards ownership, in neu-
trail ports, and liable TO seizure wher-
ever found, notwithstanding they may have been
actually and in good faith sold 10 neutral parties The
same principle OF maritime law has been declared by
this government and under any vessel that has been
used for beseren purposes under tho authority OF the
called Confederate government, will be seized whom
it be dene whatever may be her actual owner
ship the time. The English government has recently
reassered this law and issued instructions rorbdding
the transfer OF such vessels in British waters and there
Is chance for any complication to arise from such
seizures il only being 70 identify the vessel to
render its seizure legal and valid

having occurred in printing the law by Little Brown.
Their digest made, by act OF Congress- competent
dence before courts Of law. which gives II importance;
but OF course, when IL varies from the enrolled bill evil

New YORK CRY AND Irs CONGRESSIONAL. REPRE-
sKNTArIvEs.-The election Of members of Con
gress in this city is one OF the most important
questions before the people at the coming cleo
ton. New York is more vitality interested in
the Union than any other section Of the coun-
try. Its growth. its prosperity and varied in
terests cosmopolitan as it Is in character, are
closely identified with that OF the Union itself
Whatever tends TO divide. 10 weaken and re-
tard the growth of the nation, affects the pros
perity OF this city, holds it back and delays it
in reaching its destined position as the frst and
leading city in the world. 1t being the COM
mcrcial metropolis Of the nation and in fact
the financial centre of this continent, that in
luence, that combination, whether political or
otherwise, which destroys the prosperity Of any
section OF the nation, however remote, has its
effect here II is q blow at the veins in our
commercial and Industrial system, which,
! extending to all sections Of the country,
gather up and bring into this. the heart Of
| The nation, that nourshment and support
necessary for the success, growth and pros
perity OF the city in all its multitude OF in
terests. How important, therefore, it is, that
in the selection Of men to represent us
in the national Legislature during the present
crisis, persons shall be chosen who not only
comprehend the real position and import
anee OF New York, but its identity Of interests
with that of the whole nation. We want men

I Secretary Stanton telegraphs from Wash

Dispatches from Grant, dated P NJ, are as
follows: The enemy came over on our left last
evening. and attacked US They were repulsed
with great slaughter To relieve Gen. Warren,
who was on our left, Gen. Meade ordered an
attack by the balance of our line. Gen. Han
cock was the only one who received orders in
time to make an attack before dark He drove
the enemy from his intrenched skirmish line,
and still holds it. ! have no report Of the
losses, but suppose them to be light""


Other official dispatches, not from Gen.
Grant, were received at the same time, and give
more details, as follows, the first beng dated
May 80, s P. NJ: Gen. Warren has pushed
down on our left until his flank reaches point
south of ShadyGrove Church. Crawford having
got detached from the rest of the corps, was
! attacked aud driven back little. The enemy
, then threw force, which, It appears. consisted
of Ewells corps, upon Warrens left, attacking
them, but were repulsed. The engagement was
short, sharp aud decisive. Warren holds his
ground at an advantage, seven miles from Rich
' mond He reports that he has taken a consd
erable number OF prisoners, and that there are
many rebel dead on the field. OF his own loss
he has made no report. His latest dispatches
{ say that the enemy are moving troops TO his
, left, apparently TO clear an approach to Rich


mond in that direction. On our right, an action
has been raging ever since dark, but has now
closed. As soon as the enemy attacked the left

The other dispatches above referred to, dated

Col Brooks drove the enemy out of his strongly
intrenched line and holds it. The losses are
not reported. Burnsde's whole corps got
across TolapatOmy creek, last evening, and is
10 full communication with WarrenS left
, Hancock rests upon this side of the creek. The
Sixth Corps is upon Hancocks right, and
threatens the left flank of the enemy. Smith
ought to arrive at Newcastle at noon, whence
he can support Warren and Burnside, if neces-
sary. Sheridan, with Gregg's and Torbett's
divisions of cavalry, is on our left flank. Wilson
is on our left and rear, for purposes reported 10
former dispatches The country thereabouts is
thlckly wooded with pines, with good openings
The indications this morning are hat the enemy
has fallen back south of the Chickahominy.


The following was received from Butler on
the 30th ""All day heavy firing was heard in
the direction Of Mechanicsve. Six refugees
just from Richmond. report that Grant was on
the Mechanicsville Turnpike, and that be was
driving ahead. A woman reports that meet
ing was held yesterday, while she was in Rich
moud, to see whether the city should be sur
rendered or burned. The Mayor advocated
surrender, aud be was put in Castle Thunder.
The enemy attacked my lines yesterday. and
were repulsed. Today all day, they have been
demonstrating against my works on Spring
Hill. and on the eastern bank of the Apponat-
tox, bat were repul>ed.'


General Hunter, who has taken command Of
the corps lately under the leadership of Sigel,
10 the Shenandoah valley has issued an order
from the position at Cedar creek. directing the
troops to be put in light marching order, and
announcing that they must .subsist upon the
country as much as possible. His objective
point in the valley is Staunton, and he may
also employ cavalry to cut the railroad and
isolate Lynchburg.


A Chicago dispatch dated June lst says:
Letters from Sherman's army to the Goth give
details of his movement to that date. The
evening before, Howard, Palmer, Hooker
Logan and Dodge's corps were at aud slightly
beyond Dallas. hankng the rebel position at
Altoona. At this point Johnston had halted
defyiDg resistance. occupying very strong
natural and powerful fortified position. When
our army moved on the previous Monday
Sehofelds corps made demonstration at sew
eral points, leading the enemy to the belief that
we proposed 10 attack them directly in front
While thus engaged, the rest of the army
marched rapidly TO Etowah, aud crossed with
out serious opposition al point about l ) miles
below the railroad bridge Immediately re

miShing. reached Dallas on the evening of the
25th Schofeld crossed at Etowah station,
and was, at the date of the letter. moving down
the ridge to join The main body of his rear
guard, constantly skirmishing with the enemy.
Johnston was again completely outgeneraled,
and compelled 10 abandon his stronghold at
Altoona and fight if at all. in the open country
south of there. The country in which our army
is now operating abounds with splendid roads,
and our trains continue to run to Kingston and
Rome, though it is plain Johnston can. if be
chooses, occupy point in our rear. Sherman
seems perfectly indifferent to this fact. The
army is ratioued for march to Atlanta and
beyond. An attack was made and train of
so wagons captured between Cassville and
Kingston. The enemy have shown no symptoms
of intention to attack our rear. Our forces

In order thai the full value of Sheridan 8

ments lately made by Early. He was sent
down the valley. it will be remem-
hcred, very soon after Grant had crossed the
James river, and when the Army Of the Potomac
no longer literally covered"" our capital. In
1862 General Lee had been very fortunate
with similar man1uyre. No sooner had the
Army of the Potomac, by its movement to
Harrison's Landing in that year, gotten of the
direct line between Richmond and Washington
than Lee pushed part of his army mp to the
Rapidan. This frightened General Halleck,
and caused the withdrawal of our army from
the James. Lee then Immediately pushed his
whole army on after the body with which he
had made his first venture, and thus, at single
stroke, transferred the war from the neighbor-
hood Of his own capital into Northern State.
He counted upon similar result in the pre-
sent year, but ought to have remembered that
he had not General Halleck to deal with any
longer His tentative was failure. Grant
understood it fully and clearly from the
FIRST, detached just enough force to nullify
Early, and that valiant rebel, though he made
a great noise, did no damage.


Lee, to the best of any ordinary judgment, at
the time he made this movement made it in
perfect safety. There appeared to be no doubt
that he could spare twenty thousand men for
this attempt, and no doubt but that he, with the
remainder Of his army well posted in immense
Notifications, could keep our force at bay.
Moreover he, in common with all Rebellion,
confidently expected that our army was to sit
down and die with fever. But Grant disap-
pointed him in all respects. His watchfulness
his energy, his immense activity, soon con-
vnced Lee that be had played a hazardous
game in the detachment of Early. Stretching
his line to an immense length, he compelled
Lee to attenuate his line, and then, through
that very weakness in Lee that was caused by
the absence Of Early, Grant was able to seize
the Weldon road. The rebel papers pretend
that this was a matter OF no consequence;
but this seizure OF the Weldon road
added one hundred dollars to the price Of
every barrel Of -four sold in Richmond after it
was made. Had Lee had present the force
with Early he might have prevented that
seizure; but since he could not prevent, be
had to make the best Of it.


Grants movement on the Weldon road gave
an entirely new character to Early's occupa-
tion Of the valley He was now no longer
there to threaten Washington or divert men
from Grants army. By the lose Of the Weldon
road Lynchburg had become a place Of the
most vital Importance to Lee, and Early
business was now to cover that place. and, II
possible, gain a victory for moral effect He
was even reinforced, in the hope that be might
do this last; but it soon became obvious tina;
he was a no onentity. He could 'offer battle,
and did il every other day; but he could not
force battle Lee saw that, having spared so
many men to accomplish certain purpose,
and having failed in that purpose, the absence
Of those men from the circle around
Richmond was to our advantage. and
not to his. Lynchburg could be. as
we'll defended by troops within that
circle, and within that circle also they would
be handy as supports in case Of emergency. Il
was imperative that he should cover Lynch
burg; but il was also imperative that he should
have the occasional use OF the troops that
covered that place for other purposes for men
were getting scarcer every day by the drain
OF desertion and large losses in battle.

look upon HuNTEE's recent campaign as
entirely successful. We quote:

defeated at Lynchbnrg and driven back be-
yond the Allegheny mountains.


Now let us look for moment at the
facts. We know that he attacked the
enemy at Lynchburg; We know that he
was repulsed; and after an interval of
ten or fifteen days, where do We find
him j.? We answer, at Charleston, West
ern Virginia, some hundreds of m les dis

for HUNTERS reputation, neglects to give

the map, and fnd Charleston, W Westvirginia,

rebel railroads, or in other words to CO.

Of Richmond. 1t was also expected to
secure the Shenandoah Valley, the inlet
to Maryland, from the rebels. That Hun

not dispute. No army marches through
rebel territory without doing it, but it is
idle to say that he was successful in the
main objects Of the expedition. He could
not take Lynchburg, neither could be re-
treat down the Shenandoah from whence
he came, and probably was wise in getting
away from his pursuers in the manner he
did. But the result was, that finding the
Shenandoah Valley open, for SleEI was
not serious obstruction, the rebels pass

ry, and are now, or have been, raiding
through Maryland and Pennsylvania, de-
stroying vast amount Of public and pri-

ment, if not alarm, through other North

to the failure Of HUNrRR's campaign.

Aso to move two corps the left in such manner as
to seiza and hold the Southsde railroad This would
have compelled the immediate evacuation OF Petersburg
as that place would truly have been rendered unten-
able in military view, and Lee would, for safety,
have withdrawn his army within the defences of Rich
mond and disposed his troops as to defend the Dan
vile road-a line of communications which would then
have been invested with the utmost Importance. The
movement the right however, resulted in the posses

that on she left failed for want OF vim the part OF the
officers directing it. The hopeful tone of Gen. Grants

In Chicago the selling rates tha: day were as

Confederate Government to manage our foreign
relations, and TO defend us against our common
enemies. All matters connected with domestic
prosperity; the business, welfare and happiness
OF the people at home, devolve upon the States
They stand to the people in parental attitude
to watch over their interests, and in all proper
and constitutional ways to take such action from
time to time as will promote their general COM
fort and happiness, and protect the people gene
rally from distress and loss. This. indeed, is
the chief Object of all governments


In ordinary times this NAV be well enough
accomplished by periodical sessions of the Leg


slatuIe at long intervals, leaving the executive
and Judicial branches constantly in operation to
give efficacy TO the laws enacted.


In extraordinary times, ike the present, when
the whole ordinary courses of events are turned
aside, and new emergencies continually arising
affecting the people vitality, the action of the


legislature is more frequently required. Great
distress may occur to the people, and much
damage to the government itself for want OF
prompt legislative action. The State Govern
ments of Louisiana :ad Texas have felt this
and have done great deal TO relieve the people
in their prtsci: emergencies. We think our
Legislature could DO great deal in the same
way if it were shortly convened. The course
of the war has brought many families TO dis
tross. Their crops are neglected. and they are
destitute of clothing or the means of industry.
The State has means and facilities for assisting
them by expectation of cotton, and importation
OF cards AMI other Indispensable articles, which
private enterprise cannol afford. Our country
is destitute of iron for agricultural purposes
Our hills are full Of iron ore. The Confederacy
cannot make enough for military purposes, and
private enterprise makes none. Something
might be done to part;ally relieve this necessity,
by encouraging manufacturers here, or obtain
ing it, for the poor, abroad.


These are mentioned by way of example.
There are many other subjects requiring imme-
diate attention, such the finances of the State.
the public lands, and the Judiciary. Amongst
other things it is worthy of remark. that our
clerks offices and State offices are al destitute
of stationery. There arc no books for recording
deeds, or proceedings of courts The proceed
ings of the Legislature, the public acts, and the
decisions of the Supreme Court, are all unpub-
iished. An enquiry should be made concerning
this. Ii the public printers have neglected their
duty. they should at once be held liable in their
bond. If they have been unable by any exer-
tons to procure the material for tine purpose the
public exigencies require that the State should
II and hgyo tho -;...i u.
least cost.


The State has the power and means Of i'm
porting material for these purposes. They are
properly public necessities, but whilst attending


TO that, if the Legislature were 10 afford assist
ance 10 the newspapers in obtaining material to
disseminate information, nothing would be lost
TO the State, and the benefits to the community


would be ineaiculablc Hundreds of citizens
will be apt to die in the country for want of
medicines. 1t would be an act of humanity on
the part Of the State to establish dispensariss
throughout the State, to furnish the poor and
destitute. They have 30 means else of procur-
ing them. The enemy laugh at this very dis
trcss.


Besides that, We doubt whether the noAt elec-
tloil tdh ot EcIu anu Il quorum elected unless
| some provision be made for voting by refugees


and soldiers. Ii there should be failure, our


Sfalc government Will be virtually extinct Our


members Of the House of Representatives, and

pire. If new legislature be not elected, we

The Knights of the Columbian Star in
this State number about sixteen thousand.
They are all armed but many Of them poorly.
/ Their purpose is insurrection aud cooperation
with the Southern rebels in the destruction Of
the United States Government. The order
exists 10 more or less strength in all the Free
States, but assumes different names, according
i to circumstances and in conformity with popu
! lar spirit. The great end, however, is the
same everywhere-the overthrow Of the Fed

the Democracy were not let alone, and little
before, John Il. Ridge. agent for Browns
Press, was travelling the State, organizing
Democratic Clubs"" Ridges name appears
on the roll of the Knights, now in our posses
sion.


If there should be any doubts in relation 10
the authenticity OF the documents in our pos

following perSous:

tary.


1t may be interesting to these traitors TO
know that their local organizations, through
out the 5 ate, are thoroughly known-names
of officers prominent members; aud times and
places of meeting. Sharp eyes have been upon
them. Wary detectives have been in their
lodges and immediately reported their whole
proceedings; and it has so happened that the
internal traitors have not been tree TO one an
other-what but treachery could be expected
Of wretches base enough to be traitors 10 their
country? Enough Is known to subject every
william Of them TO arrest and Imprisonment;
adequate preparations have been made for
them, and the sc0undrels may commence ope-
ratons as soon as they please.


We have not room to give the full details of
this conspiracy. or q full list of the officers and
members throughout the State. The correct
n IS OF the whole may he judged by the follow
ing selected from the names selected in one
district:


Grass Valley-Dr. II. Davis, J. R. Ridge,
T. McSorely. = Brown.


Downievie- Peter Van Chief, Roderick
Mckenzie, Thomas Bowers, Homer King.
Matt Lynch Q. A. Clements. r. A. Cochrane
james Galloway. Regular meetings were had
at MOoFe's Flat, Grass Valley, and North San
Juan.


Some time ago it became known TO the Or
der in this city that we were in possession of
the following documents, and since then their
meetings have been suspended, or had with
great caution. Since then they have been bu
silly engaged in changing their whole manner
Of procedure. signs passwords, alphabet etc;
but that will be of little account, as they find
it wholly impossible to guard ofitclualy
against spies and inlormers. They expect to
obtain powder. lead, and other appliances in
this city, and have already secured conside
rable quantity. AT the|proper time they will
seize one of the forts commanding the city
(Black Point), and proceed TO extirpate the
Abohtionis.sl


The foregoing elaborate and authentic ex
position will forever settle the qdestion as to
whether a reasonable secret ofder exists in
this State. The fact can no longer be doubted
by any reasonable man. We regret for GER
tain reasons 1t could not have been published
before the election; but even DOW it will serve
TO put Union men on their guard, aud will ad
monish them to keep up their protective or
CARNATIONS, and be at all times prepared TO
shred the traitors to pieces, should they at
tempt any demonstration whatever AS We
have said before, the danger is not yet over.
The traitors had no expectation OF eleciing
Mcclellan, but expected TO exasperate and
work up the passions of the ignorant, by mis-
representing and denouDcing the Administra
tion as despotism, so that the projected in-
surrection might occur at or before Mr.. Lin
coins second Inauguration. As stated in Ber
ry's letter, they expected to easily fnd pre-
text TO assert that the election had not been
fair; and thus create plausible cause for revo-
luiion.


Let the attention of the military and the
several Union organizations be sharp upon the
movements Of the traitors and, whenever q
demonstration is made, let the known leaders
suffer death. 1t was their original intention
having taken possession of Black Point, to
seize certain number of prominent citizens
as hostages until the city had been given up.

crimes against law and liberty more than
can be numbered. Posterity will scarce
ly find shclf-room for the volumes which
will be written upon the grand plunge
which the people Of America made from
free principles into despotic principles,
from high and holy regard for the sane
tity of law into the license Of q radical
majority rule.


Nor is it the Constitution and law
alone that men have violated with the
excuse that An emergency"" required
it. Fixed principles Of moral right and
wrong, established doctrines Of religion
and Christian duty, have been trampIed
on by politicians with the same excuse
and the result is visible in widespread
and melancholy disregard among the
people for these once-establislied views
Of right, which were the peculiar char
acteristic of the American people,
Churches are desecrated. Pulpits are
occupied by demagogues. Politica
meetings on Sunday mornings take the
place of the worship of God. The ole
hymns Of praise have often given place
to partizan political ballads, or to ""na
tional songs"" In the minds of young
people, patriotism according to the
Radical definition Of the word, takes
precedence of religion /; loyalty"" is
almost the same word as piety. The Ad
miDistration is applsuded for filling the
pulpits Of churches, by military order
with anti-slavery preachers. and for ban
ishing men whose only offence is rigid
adherence to the purity Of their clerical
character, and refusal to use their min
isterial office for the purposes of any
political party. Publications Of q
Loyal character are widely circulated
read and admired, whose only meri,
consists in being builesques or parodies
on Holy Scripture and we have nov
ying before us one of this class, ISSUED
by Radicals in New York, which con
tains blasphemons parody on the creed
substituting for the names of the per
sons in the Holy Trinity the names o
military and political leaders. So-called
religious news papers do not hesitate
to compare such sublime scenes as the
TRANSPORTATION Of Christ with incidents
in the lives of popular men in the coun
try, and clergymen, in prayers to God
personify Freedom"" as a goddess, and
with a sweeping creed, that wholly does
away with the whole religion of the Bi
BILE, returning TO that Of Mohammed, ol
Of the Scandinavians, tell rs that the
dead of the battlefield pass at once into
eternal bliss, redeemed by their own
blood We exaggerate nothing in this
picture. We speak with proof of every
word before u.s. This is the aspect o.
our country, under the rule Of Radica
party, whose religion is their own lust
for power and hatred of their opponents
II is the result Of this doctrine, for three
years past impressed on the popular
mind. that Constitution. law, right, duty
religion, everything, ought TO be sub
jected to the requirements Of the ""emer

At an inquest held before me. a Justica. of
the Peace in and for said county, over the
body of Stephen Galbraith, on the 7th day Of
November, 1864, the following iurymen were
summoned to inquire into the cause of his
death: F. Kittridge, E. voluntinet. Jere-
miah Lynch, Barney Conroy. II. F.Burr,
and Daniel Caughlin. The Jury being
sworn


Daniel Caughlin testified that he was about
fifty OF sixty yards from where the body was
found, and saw deceased about FIVE minutes
before the body was found. Heard two
rep0rts-one the, natural sound of a shot gun
and the other lighter sound. and immedi-
ately heard the cry of the children and wife
of deceased, and ran to the spot and found
deceased dead, his brains blown out and his
clothing on fire. The body was not moved
from the position in which it was found until
DR.. Pelham arrived.


DR.. J. Z. Pelham being sworn, testified !:
/ am practicing physician and a resident of
Shasta. was in Horsetown this morning
about half past 8 ioclock, A. N. While at
Spencer's Hotel was informed that Stephen
Galbraith had shot himself. ! Immediately
repaired to the spot and found him in the
immediate vicinity of his residence, on the
outside of the corral fence belonging to his
harm, lying at full length upon his back. with
his head towards the fence, entirely dead, the
whole top of his head being blown of, and
his brains lying on his right side, about four
feet distant frcm his body, shot gun on his
left side and the ramrod on his right, and the
remnants of powder flask on his right,
which had evidently been exploded.
found a wound on his lcSt temple evidently
made by the discharge Of a large bored gun
in such close proximity that all of its con.
tents. whether powder, shot, ball or wad-
wing, would enter the wound. That wound
was the cause of his death. examined the
shot gun and found one barrel discharged
and the other one so nearly loaded that the
wad covering the shot had been rammed down
about four inches. ] came to the conclusion
that Mr.. Galhraith came to his death by the
accidental discharge of one barrel OF his dou-
BILE barrel shot gun, while in the act of load.
ing the other barrel, and that he fell almost
Immediately in his tracks. There was evi.
dence of blood, brains and shot in the bushes,
which led to the conclusion that he was in a
standing position at the time of the discharge
of the gun, Immediately where he fell, and
that the gun, at the time of its discharge, was
resting with the breech on the ground, and
the muzzle pointing in the direction Of his
head. | saw no other appearance Of injury
to the body. except that his clothing had been
on fire and apparently put out with water.


Jeremiah Lynch testified: was sitting
with Mr.. Ja.es Daily outside of his house.
heard Mrs. Gaibrairh scream back of her
house, and Immediately went to ascertain
what was the matter. She told us that Ste
phen Galhraith had shot himself back of his
stable. l then repaired to the place desig-
mated and found Mr.. Galbraith lying at full
length on the ground upon his back, and
quite dead. ! found the clothing of deceased
on fire brought some water and put it out;
and in all other respects l corroborate the
testimony of DR.. Pelham.


The following is the .erdict of the jury:
We, the undersigned jurors, summoned for
the purpose ofinquiring into the cause of the
death of Stephen Galbraith, after hearing the
foregoing testimony and seeing the body. do
find that he came TO his death by the acci-
dental discharge of his gun while in his
own hands,

'' ''Sherman's programme for his grand cam
paign northward seems to be no secret. He
will start from Port Royal, and move straight
for Branchyille. the point OF junction between
the Georgia and Carolina railroads. He then
proposes to follow the main lines of roads to-
wards Virginia, stealing and marauding as
N uch as he can by the way. All very fine; but

The Prospect Glorious.",,"The news which we give to our readers this
morning of the success Of General Grants
mastery flank movement, commenced on
Saturday night last, exceeds our most sanguine
expectations. Dislodged from his strong posi-
tion at Spottsylvania Court House, General
Lee has been so rapidly followed up in bis
retreat as to be unable to organize bis forces
for q deliberate stand on the North Anna
river Repulsed from that stream, be Is
necessarily driven across the South Anna
because Of the danger Of risking an engage
ment with that river between him and the de-
fences of Richmond. The safety of his army Is
the first consideration. He may have provided
line of defensive works at Hanover Court
House. and there may be fought the decisive
battle Of the campaign but we rather incline
to the impression that the necessities Of his
army are SO urgent and the danger to his lines
of subsistence SO great that he will not stop
short of the Richmond Notifications.


AT all events, as we interpret Secretary
Stanton's last official despatch. General Grant
has cleared the way before him to the South
Anna river, and, with the railroad in running
order behind him to his base of supplies
at Fredericksburg, he may take his own
time in the disposition of his forces for
the crossing into the Peninsula. Mean
time, having abandoned the railroad
which connects Richmond with Lynch.
burg, by way Of Gordonsville, General Lee
is now wholly dependent for his supplies
upon Richmond and the roads communicating
with the city from the south. He has, there.
fore, no other inducement than the prospect
of speedy battle to halt this side of Rich.
mond; and this inducement, we incline to
believe, he will regard as not sufficiently
attractive to detain him.


1t is possible that, without waiting to be
cooped up, his next movement may be the
evacuation Of Richmond. and a retreat into
North Carolina with such plunder as he may
be able to carry off. Undoubtedly the fate OF
Pemberton will be the fate of Lee, should he
resolve to hazard the chances OF siege. Mean
while we have no apprehensions that General
Butler will permit Beauregard to leave the
southern defences of Richmond to give help.
ing hand to Lee at Hanover, or that Beaure-
gard will run the risk Of this unpromising ex.
pertinent.


The news of General Shermau's victorious
progress in Georgia, as described in the rebel
journals, from which we make some ex.
tracts this morning, will be found very anus
ing. Joe Johnston, it seems, is perfect master
of the science Of retreating, and gains all bis
victories in that way. He has Sherman now ex.
actly where he is wanted; and when Sherman
gets into Atlanta it will be better still for the
Confederate cause"" The Charleston Mercury
following up this theory Of Johnston's re
treat, applies the same style or giori
fication to General Lees advance back
wards. Thus that paper parades the
losses OF General Grant at sixty thousand
men; says that his reserves are all exhausted;
that Buffers forces are re.embarking; that gold
in New York has run up to ZIG, aud that, alto
pether. the Yankees are In a bad way


Such are the desperate devices Of the leaders
Of the rebellion to sustain their desperate
cause and to keep up the lighting spirit OF
their unfortunate followers yet little longer.
But all these delusions will soon be at an end
The fall Of Richmend will scatter them to the
winds; and that great and glorious event Is
close at hand."

New York, 3d.-Herald has the following
account of the fight north of the James on
Friday, 30th: Three desperate attempts
were made by enemy to retake the works
captured from them on Thursday. General
Lee in person commanded, but rebels were
driven each time with considerable loss.-
Enemy were discovered at 2 P. NJ. massing
troops in woods directly opposite the fort
captured yesterday, and in half an hour they
charged with wild yelis and heavy column Of
attack. Rams at same time opened on our
position and our line was enfladed by fire
from rebel battery on river. The men, how
ever. steadily to their posts and received reb-
els with so hot, we'll directed and incessant a
| fire that they broke in confusion and raced
to the woods. Twice they rallied and re-
turned to the charge, but with the same re-
suit, until finally they broke and dispersed
and fell back in irremediable confusion,
leaving the ground covered with their dead

including smany officers and greater part of

Her}d's special, dated Martinsburg. Oct.
lst, says latest intelligence from Sheridan
left him making preparations to force rem
nant of Early's army from Browns Gap, in
the Blue Ridge. This was on the 27th.-
Early's position was believed to be a very
strong one. He doubtless intends to hold it
as protection to Gordonsville and Char
lotiesville as well as Lynchburg. There can
be little doubt of Sheridan's success, for Ear.
ly's army has lost heart and Browns Gap
will pro; another Bisher's Hill.


| Herald's 10th corps correspondent saw
rebel prisoners say Davis and Cabinet fed
from Richmond. Richmond:W only paper
published on 30th owing to the general i'm
pressment of arms bearers Lee is said to be
acting independent Of all instructions, and in
fact military Dictator of the rebellion. as his
retreat in direction Of Weldon Rairaad is
cut off, it is thought he will concentrate his
forces at Richmond and make life or death
struggle there.

Dad feature Of 1t being tardiness. He
should never have respected the ukasa Of
his expatriation. He should, at The hrst
opportunity. have thrown himself upon
his rights as an American citizen. and
have presented squarely the issue between
the deepotic acts Of mere individual and
the constitutional rights Of citizen Of
this Republic.


Who banIshed Mr.. Vallandigham -
Was Il Q properly constituted 'couTt Of
Law, before which he was brought by e.
tablished processes, and his guilt proper
ly sUbstantiated, and as . conclusion Of
which he was found guilty by . jury Of
his peers and thereafter punished By
""bAnishment"" as provided by lawe Not
ct ell. Who banishen hime Mr.. Lincoln
and who Is Mr.. Lincoln who thus, in
person, or through his agents, takes upon
himself the part Of Sheriff, Judge and
Juryl He is nobody in these capacities
""a mere individual-a mere John Smith,
bearing no more extended relations to 30
ciety that any other John Smith, Should
bis acts as an individual be respected,
then9 No; and therefore Mr.. 'Vallandig-
ham, who was banished by Mr.. Lincoln,
the individual, the mere man, does right
when he refuses to obey any order issued
by Mr.. Lincoln.


The question for Mr.. Vallandigham is
not one of resistance to law, but Of adhe-
renee to law and resistance to tyranny
He was not banished bylaw; no court
had taken cogniEance Of has case he was
not tried or sentenced by legally consti-
tuted tribunal. He was simply kidnap-
ped and sent out of the country by . pos
Sc acting under no valid authority.


If body Of rufians acting under the
leadership Of some Bill Jones, Tom Smith,
or Abe Lincoln, should come to Chicago
and seize some citizen and hurry him OF
to some secluded place, and there, iua
court with Judge Lynch presiding, should
sentence that citizen to be hung, or to be
sent to Canada, and should proceed to
carry that sentence into effect they would
do precisely what was done some months
ago by posse Of men to Mr.. Vallandig-
ham. Would that citizen be thought
guilty Of disobedience to law If he should
tSluSo W otuy III OduAubS WubtucE uo Woo
banished by these rufiahsf No; nor is
Mr.. Vallandigham one whit more. guilty
of disobedience to law when he refuses to
stay where he was sent by body Of ir-
responsible men.


II Mister Lincoln chooses to attempt to
arrest Mr. Vallandigham and again send
him out of the country, an issue viii be
raised in which every citizen of the Re-
public is deeply interested. It is wheth-
er the Constitutional rights of the citizen
can be abrogated by the will Of mere in-
dividual; it is, in short, whether the Con-
stitution or the simple will of q despOt is
supreme. It can be settled now as well
as ever; it is better to settle it now, for
If the country submits longer to attempts
to suppress the freedom of the press and
the citizen, we will yield ourselves TO q
tyranny which in little while will re.
duce this people to a condition more In
famous and degrading than that of Helot.
ism in ancient Sparta.


If Mister Lincoln is wise, he will not
attempt further usurpations. The people
have borne much already, and the time
is close at hand when further endurance
will cease to be either virtue or q posi-
bility.-Chicago Times."

A Fredericksburg correspondent of the Er.
aminer, writing under date Of April eth, says: !:


""The opinion prevails In Washington that
Lee army, In numerical strength, does not
exceed $1,000 men. To oppose this force, or
rather for the purpose Of attack, Grant has re-
quired that the Army OF the Potomac shall be
rendered lGO, 600 strong. To this end reinforce
passing up the Orange and Alexandria railway
Tor the past ten days. Ten days hence it will
be ready for the advance, which Is universally
desired in the United States from Lincoln
down, or up, whichever phrase you prefer.


""The commonly received opinion that Grant
cations is erroneous. He will seek TO turn the
flank Of our army, and his policy Is. evidently,
TO maintain his present position until his or.
genixation and equipment are thoroughly ac-
his strategy, to surprise Gen. Lee. He may
march rapidly and without announcement
either to some point of crossing the Rapldan or
Rappahannock, or to Port Republic, thence to
Staunton, thence to Lynchburg. think an
attempt to flank on the east the more probable;
the Rappahannock. This, however. is all
conjecture, and but the echo Of Washington

 June Both. lH64.",,"

 DEAR ENQUIRER Ut is difficult to under stand what relative importance tho next mo notonous week bears to the general campaign. When the issue of the movement is uncovered perhaps these dull days may take an imp0rtan, place apon the record, but at present l find but few people who attempt to explain their s;ea,hcanaa. To he srrs our brave patient soldiers need rest, but there Ca be n o adYan- age in taking repose that will only increase ,Ae burden and peril of the struggle. If our enenies' lines of supply were permanently in terrupted, so that every week of rest and re Reion to us would be one of exhaustion and Encouragement to him, ten days repose of this army would be worth a reinforcement of 20,- 900 men but these days of inactivity look like cencentrstive preparation and encouragement to our foes, and fearful resistance to our next struggle for victory With the Lynch barg Railroad destroyed for miles and the Welden R. R. within oul grasp, no great effort seems to be necessary to cut Lees army en- tirely free from ""the Confectionery"" and from all outside assistance; but the left wing of our army has been lying. for week. within mile or two of the latter road, with no force of the enemy between them and it. Reconnoitering and pleasure parties have been out almost daily, and watched the laborers ut work repair. ing the track, protected by light guard i; and yet no effort has been made to occupy and hold this great rebel thoroughfare. Yesterday, Gen. Wilson, returning from the most brilliant Cav airy expedition of the war, was intercepted, as he approached the Railroad, and was overpow cred and driven back before assistance could reach him. When the projected movement, that will have been initiated before this letter is in print, shall have transpired, the wisdom of these things may be unfolded. Let us hope so.

 The attempted return oe Gen. Wilson, is al most the only episode upon the quiet of the past few days. He is reported to have accom- plished his mission most perfectly, completely destroying about 60 miles of railroad, without meeting any serious opposition. But. on Tues day night, as he was returning. he fell upon a heavy rebel force on Stoney River, and had desperate fight. It was here that the 2nd Brigade, containing the 1st Conn., Cavalry, was cut of from the main command and perhaps captured. Extricating himself from this posi- ton by taking circuitous route, he attempted to join our army by way of eems' Station, Il 0 miles from Petersburg, on the Welden Rail Road. Here he was again checkmated by force of rebel infantry and artillery. He sue ceeded in getting courier through to General Meade, with a statement of the case and a re oues. for assistance. The 9th Corps was sent down to make diversion in his favor, but came to the spot too late to assist him.. He is said to have retreated south, and we can on- ly hope and pray for his deliverance.

 Nothing new has transpired with the 2nd Conn., Artillery, except as connected with this movement of tho 9th Corps. left them, this afternoon, at the Station, about to return, pro bably, to their old position.

WAsHIsGTos, June l4-There are ru-
mors IN town to-day that Sheridan has

Hunter, to destroy the Richmond aud

capital is principally supplied. Il is un-

all the damage possible 10 the railroad
and depols in bis pathway. He is ae-
compsnied By large cavalry and artil-
lery force, aud is fully able to cope with
any body Of the enemy with whom be
may fall in. II was suspected, at the
time Sheridan started, that be would
pass around to the south side Of Rich
mond and sever the communications
leading out Of that city, but this portion
Of the programme has probably been
entrusted to Kautz, who once before
raided over that territory, aud is there

Sheridan's destination has been devel-

struction Of the railroad connecting them

little farther into the country, and effect

the rebel capital are now taxed to their
utmost capacity to supply the inhabitants
Of Richmond and the immense army oi
Lee. The people Of Richmond are al
ready suffering on short rations, and il

Andrew johnson. formerly United States
Senator from Tennessee, was born in Raleigh,
North Carolina, December 20. 1905 When
be was four years of age, be lost bis father, who
died from The effects of exertions to save
friend from drowning. Al the age of ten be
was apprenticed TO tailor in bis native city.
with whom be served seven years. His mother
was unable 10 afford him any educational sd
vsntaees, and he never attended school day
10 bis life. While learning his trade, however.
be resolved 10 make an effort TO educate himself.
His anxiety 10 be able 10 read was particularly
excited By an incident which is worthy of
mention A gentleman OF Raleigh was in the
habit of going into The tsilors shop and reading
while the apprentice and journeyuen were at
work. He was an excellent reader, ard bis
favoriie book was volume OF speeches, princi
paly OF British statesmen. johnson became
interested, aud bis first ambition was TO equal
him as q reader and become familiar with those
speeches. He took up the alphabet without
an instructor; but, by applying 10 the journey


men with whom he worked, he obtained little
assistance Having acquired knowledge Of
The letters, he applied for the loan Of the book
which he bad so often heard read. The owner
made him present of it. and gave him some


instruction on the use Of letters in the formation
Of words. Thus bis first exercises 10 spelling
were in that book. By perseverance he soon
learned TO read and the hours which he devoted
TO his education were al night. after be was
through his daily labor upon the shop board.
He now applied himself TO books from two to
three hours every night after working from ten
to twelve hours at his trade. Having com
pleted his apprenticeship in the Autumn Of
1924, he went 10 Laurens Court House. South
Carolina, where he worked as journeyman for
nearly two years. While there be became
engaged TO be married. but the match was
broken off by the violent opposition of the girls
mother and friends. the ground of objection
being Johnson's youth and want of pecunlary
means. 10 May. 1926, be returned to Raleigh,
where be procured journey work, and remained
until September. He then set out to seel his
fortune in the West, carrying with him his
mother, who was dependent upon him for sup


port. He stopped at Greenvlle, Tennessee,
and commenced work as a journeyman. He
remained there aboni twelve months, married,
and soon afterward wen, still further westward:
but failing to 6nd a suitable place to settle, be
returned TO Greenviiie and commenced business


Up 10 this time, bis education was limited to
reading, as be bad never had an opportunity Of


learning TO write or cipher; but under the in
siructions OF bis wife be learned ihese and other
branches. The only time, however, be could
devote to them was in the dead of night. The
first Office which he ever held was that OF AL
derman of the village, to which be was elected
in 1928. He was re elected to the same posi-


tion in 1929, and again in 1880 In that year
he was chosen Mayor, which position he held
for three years. In 1885 be was elected to the
Legislature In the session of that year he
took decided ground against q scheme of inter-
nal improvements, which he contended would
not only prove failure, but entail upon the
State burdensome debt. The measure was
popular, however, and at the next election
1S31) be was defeated. He became candi-
date again in 1889 By this time many Of the
evils he had predicted from the internal i'm
provement policy which he had opposed four
years previous were fully demonstrated, and he
was elected by large majority. In lS40, he
served as Presidential Elector for the State at
large on the Democratic ticket. He canvassed
a large portion of the State, meeting upon the
stump several of the leading Wing orators In
lS4l, be was elected 10 the State Senate. In
lS43, be was elected TO Congress where. by
successive elections, be served until 1853.
During this period of service he was cOnspicu
GUS and active in advocating. respectively the
bill for refunding the fine imposed upon General
jackson at New Orleans in 1915, the annexa
ZION of Texas, the tariff of 1916, the war meas
ures of Polk 5 Administration. and a homestead
bill In 1858, he was elected Governor of
Tennessee, after an exciting canvass, in which
he was opposed by Gustavus A Henry. He
was re elected in 1855, after another active
contest, his competitor being Meredith p.
Gentry. AT the expiration of his second period
as Governor, in 1857, be was elected United
States Senator for a full term. ending March 3,
1868. Although he was Breckenridge Dem.
ocrat, yet at the first dawning OF the rebellion

President, aud advocating measures for sustain

papers are insultingly inquiring of loyal men,
devoted to the Union OF these States, what
kind of Union they want. We think that we
can answer for all true hearted Union men.


We do not want a Union distracted by
sectional hates and jeaousies and struggles for
supremacy. We DO aot want Union char
acterized by South Carolina notifications, by
Mississippi repudiations. Alabama lynchings,
Virginia ideas of State Rights, Lecompton
Constitutions, Kansas highway robberies,
House of Representatives fsticuffs, Senate
Chamber cudgeings, Border State wars, or
John Brown raids We do not want Union
that is incompatible with liberty of speech and
thought We do ut want Union IN portion
of which a man, resident or travelling, cannot
speak, nor even privately cherish an opinion
for or against slavery, or any moral OF social
question that has arisen or may arise, without
being exposed TO imprisonment or q violent
death, as has been the case in the South. We
do do not want Union in which a men 5
birthplace either north or south of a given line,
dsqualifes him for an office of high trust We
do not want Union in which portion Of the
people shall be laying up arms and drilling a
soldlery, in evident and express preparation for
the battles of diSunion. Rather, if it please
the curious and inquisitye we want Union
as it was during the first half century Of our
national existence, when every man was allowed
to quietly own and peaceably dispose of what
he might hold under the Constitution. We
want Union in which, when one party is
beaten at the ballot box fairly and under the
forms of law, all parties will gracefully bow TO
the will of the majority, and, if wronged in the
selection of rulers, seek their remedy at the
ballot-box in future contests. 10 a word we
want Union in which we shall have the
harmony and uniformity of other days-a
uniformity based upon the great principles
Of the Constitution.


This is the Union We are fighting for, and
We intend to have it, or exterminate every
rebel South, ard every Copperhead North

dsis, two of the Episeopalans. one of the Bhp-
lists, one of the Cath7 s, beside seYaral places
of worship for the oolore1 people. 1t had also
three banks, several cotton factories. ore WOODEN
factory, two ropevaks, one iron furnace, six
iorges, and numerous mills of various kinds.
Three newspapers were published there. The
falls Of the river, which arrest the ascent Of the
tide immt diately above Petersburg, furnish ex-
tensive Ea;er-power.


Around these falls p caual has been construct
ed by which means small boats ascend the river
for about 100 miles. The limits Of The borough
include the decayed village Of Blauford, in Prince
George County, which was once superior to Pc
tersburg in some respects. The remains of its
church were among the most interesting and pic
turesque ruins Of Virginia. In 1915 great lire
occurred there, by which nearly our hundred
houses were consumed.

 l Resolred That whatever opinion might have been entertained of the origin, necessity or justice of the Tories of the Revolutionary War, by the Federalists of the late war with Englan1, orly the Wings and Aboliionis;s of the present war with N'exico, the fact of their country's being engaged in such war ought to have been sufficient for them, aud to have precluded debate on that subject till q suc- cessful termination of the war; and that in the meantime the patriot could have experi- enced ro diNicu;ty in recognizing his place On the side of his country, and could never have been induced to yield either physical or moT al aid to the enemy

 This was good tt::oc.::na then, and believe it is now.

 Among the other charges named in the third proposition it one conderning the ad- ministration for interfering with the freedom of the press. Certainly no paper which has followed the course Iail down in the Resou- tion of Mr. VallanligIiam, which have read, has been nterfered with.

 But. sir. this charge comes with poor grace i from the representative of d party which tried to force through Congress- and upon q free dom-lo'ing people tEe Lecompton Constitu- tion.

 The 2lst section Of that Constitution pro- vided-

 If any free person, by speaking or by wr- ting. assert or maintain that persons have not the right 10 ho.l slaves in the Territory. or shall intro luce into his Territory print, pub iisti wr:'t' circulate, or cause 10 be introduced into this Territory. any book, paper, magazine, pamphlet, or circular. containing any denial of the right cf pcrso:s to hold slaves in this Ter ritory. such person shalt be deemed guilty of 1 felony, and pnnShcl ny Imprisonment at hard la'or tur tern, ::f not less than two years There is freedom of the press for you Yes, and freedom of speech at the expense of i'm pris1nment at hard labor for tern, not less th m two years Amd that Is what the very Democratic administration of Mir. Buchanan tried to carry tbraugh Congress, aAd force up on the people ot Kansas.

 When the administration of James Bucban- an shall Isav. b.en pursed of this effort to srikr down the freedom of speech and of the press there will i,e abundance of tine to frame all indictment agAis.st the administration now ill power. But it is claimed that the Post Office Department has, at times, refused to c.rrv certain papers thereby denying to the people free Is Of the mails think it was during the administration Of Mr. Van BGreir, If 1 am wrorg, any gentleman will please correct m-> T law was passed eTing to post masters the rig lit to refuse to deliver any mat- ter believed lp ha If nn 'ince:llary charac- ter PoStl.,ast,!s ortan.ti.Ees during the ad-- ministrations of Van Bnrnn, Polk. Pierce and Buchanan, exercised their rights under this law. and refused to deliver papers printed in the free States. have before He copy of q letter sent bv a Southern postmaster to iIor ace Greeley during Mr. Buchanan5 adrninis- tration. I will read it:

 Pos1 CFFIcs, Lynchi,nrg, Dec. 2. E5.C. Mir. HORACE GREELEY Sir II hereby ill., form you that shall not, in future, deliver from this office the copies of the JiibNnc which come here, because believe them to 1 he of that incel,iary character which are for biei,ipn alike by the laws of the land, and a proper regard for the safety of society. You will therefore dis .ontuue them. Respectfully,

 R. II. GLASS, F. M. Has anything appeared in the New York Tribune of more ncendiary character than i language published ill certain Democratic pa pers soon after the breaking out of the war? 1 If there has, 1 have never seen iI. But perhaps it was not intended that this law should be enforced against it's authors. l may be that it is unkind. Let the Democrat ic party call for it's immediate repeal.

 1. Another charge against tho administration

 s,.that the President has, in violation of law

 issued Proclamation coDiiscating the prop erty of the rebels, and declaring their slaves i free. The gentleman has made this charge but failed to advance any argument in support of his position. Mr. Stevens, in his speech before the Geor- gia Convention, from which l have already quoted. after referring 70 what had been done for the South, and the prospect of more new slave States, adds - If you do not destroy this hope, and, perhaps, by it lose all, and have your laSt slave wrenchcd from you by sern military rtle, as South America and Mexico were or by the vindictive decree of universal emancipation, which may be reason- ably expected to follow

 The Presidents Emancipation Proclaina ton vas issued in accordance with the req sonable expectations of the South, but the gentleman from the Eighteenth considers it a very gross infringement upon Southern rights.

 It is enough for me to know that during and after the Revolutionary war, nearly every one of the original thirteen States, passed laws confscating the property of the Tories. ] know of no good reason why the rebels of the South are entitled to any greater considera ton than were the enemies of our country ill the days of the Revolution.

 The common law of military necessity has demanded, for the purposes of bringing inc war to as speedy close as possible, that every support of the rebels should be taken away.

 We now have large number of these slaves in our army, and it is the unanimous verdict of thelr generals that they make good soldiers. Yes

 Adorn but him with freedom,

 And proud he braves

 The rebel knaves

 That fight where traitors lead 'em D

 This attempt to throw diseredit upon the government by finding fault with every act of our public servants, has been carried much too tar. It has injured us in the eyes of foreign nations, and prolonged the war, sacrificing thousands of lives, and materially increasing our national debt.

 The Richmond Enquirer of the 7th of Sep tember, in all article headed the road to peace, thus speaks :-

York City.",,"York City.


1t IS one Of the most extraordinary features
Of this extraordinary war that we should have
a regular rebel press In this loyal metropolis OF
the country. Since the rebels began their
attack upon this government by setting fire to
Fort Sumter and robbiug the Custom House at
New Orleans, they have never wanted apollo
gists and defenders here at the North. Day
after day the rebel press Of this city has exten-
uated their vices and given them unbounded
credit for virtues which they have never pos
sessed. The greater were the outrages and
barbarities Of the rebels, the louder were the
peans of admiration from the ircendiary press.
Our victories were tortured into defeats, our
defeats magnified into final disasters, while the
rebels were spoken Of as constant victors, and
lauded to the skies as miracles Of merit, cour-
age and endurance.


When the rebel press Of this city had fairly
wearied out the patience Of the people. II was
partially suppressed. To cay that every one
pie and evident fact; but still there were
doubts az to the legality and judiciousness of
such movement Everybody would rejoice
to see murderer hung; but still all Law abid-


ing citizens would object to see him dangle


from lamppost without legal trial. Upon


this principle the government was induced to


relax its severity towards the incendary press,
and those papers which had been suppressed and
denied The mails were once more permitted to
resume publication. Tie result was the great
riot in New York. The rebe. press Of this city
ipHamed the worst passions Of some OF onr
citizens, and q lawIess mob devastated the
metropolis, robbipg, burning and ravisbing
without restraint. Finally an admirable police,
assisted by the military succeeded in getting
the upper hand of the rioters and order was
once more restored. But the cause of the out
break-tbe incendiary rebel press which had
provoked it still remained to work further


mischief. Little by little 1t gathered strength
for another disturbance. At last the oppor-
tunity came, and a desperate and atrocious
attempt was made by rebel emssaries and
rebel sympathizers to burn down this city and
to involve In q fearful confagration our
citizens, our women and our children. Provi-
dence preserved us from this dreadful peril;
but the cause. the incentive, is still among us,
aud we are not yet entirely safe.


Our readers will remember that the scheme
to burn down New York was forcshedowed in
the Richmond papers. They stated that the
men to commit the arson were already here,
and that money alone was needed. They


argued that twenty men could fire our city; and


this SCENE to be about the number actually en-
ployed. ""Ono New York"" said these Richmond


rebels, ""is worth twenty Richmonds;"" and upon


this basis they urged JEFF. Davis to let no-false
acrupses prevent bis giving his consent to their


diabolcal plan. But while the Richmond


papers foreshadowed this iocendiary plot the


rebel papers in this city were not silent.
One OF them remarked that there were plenty


of hearty, able-bodied rebel refugees in New
York, making loud boasts OF their loyalty to the
confederacy. Again we were warned that the
rebels would retaliate upon us for the opera
tions Of our generals in the South. Threats


that the war would be brought to our own fire.
sides were not unfrequent Accompanying
these significant articles were others which, in


eu'ogy Of the rebel leaders and in detraction


of the North, far surpassed the secession press


of the hottest part Of South Carolina. We
call public attention to these facts. We ask


General Dix to consider them. Could the
rebel press Of this city know Of the presence
Of able-bodied traitors among US and be SO
we'll informed OF their intentions, without some
direct or indirect completely with them? That
is the question which we wish our military
authorities TO investigate.


When the plot of the rebel incendiarles was


defeated, and our hotels and theatres, with
| their innocent inmates, saved from becoming q
flaming funeral pyrc, the rebel press Of this city
was attentlvely watched by those anxious to
discover the guilty parties. One of these papers
ventured to claim the exclusive credit of know
ing all about the plot. Another INDUCED in
! q column Of special pleading to prove that the
rebel authorities chad exhibited too much wis


dom and taci' to endorse any =; inSendary enter
prises; that they were too ""Chsstian and
enlightened"" and that tie idea Of their organ.
izing such plot was ""absurd, ungcnerous and


UNJUST to the contrary Of all


this Notwithstanding. Yesterday another OF
our rebel organs took up the strain, declaring
""the phosphorus panic"" to be shameful and
ludicrous,"" and denouncing General Dixs
admirable order as savoriug Of ""Lynch law""
This was the phosphorescent organ which
expected the incendisrism on Friday night, and
had its reporters on the spot, but was obliged
to alter its heading to the news, a. the fires
were extlnguished. Another rebel paper pub
lished two letters yesterday, ridiculing tho
terrible scheme ss republican yplot Titus

soon as we advance. His army, according to
statement of prisoners captured on Saturday.

our lines several times but was driven back
with heavy loss. The rebels finally retired

oLO HEG WINNIE, OF ARKANSAS.

Among the old settlers of Arkansas",,"among the old settlers OF Arkansas
we mean the real old settlers-was Uncle
Ben Winnie, as he was universally called
by the young, and most everybody else.
Uncle Ben had had hard time of it, as
he said, from the beginning of his exis-
tence. lie had in early life been RATS
man, then a keel boatman, and then q
sort Of third mate on one of the first
steamers that started on the ""Massissip,""
and finally he ""pre-emptied"" on the gov
ernUent land and set himself up for a reg
ular sovereign. In the course Of time
Uncle Winnie found himself the keeper
Of a tavern, and it was at his house where
was performed, for the first time, the
""Old Arkansaw Traveller"" Uncle Win
MES customers, Of course, were compare
lively few and far between, but he took
good care of all that came under his roof !;
and if his hog, hominy, ""bar meat"" and
sweet potatoes were rathe"" roughly done
up, he managed, by bluff way of his
own, and a variety Of ""reminiscences of
his early days, to season his constantly
presented viands, and you made hearty
meal without noticing particularly of
what its dishes were composed. AS the
farms increased, Uncle Winnie's house
became the headquarters Of the sparse
population, and among the Improve.
ments"" introduced, as a consequence of
this new order Of things, was the frequent
meeting of card parties. At first Uncle
i Winnie rather discouraged this style of
amusement, but he finally fell into the
humors Of his friends, and, much to his
surprise, found out that in his long fat
boat trips from Pittsburg to New Orleans,
he had, to while away the time, learned
to hardle ""the picters"" with q skill that
soon became the talk Of the neighborhood.
This gave new zest for the thing, and
""the boys"" usually made it business to
back up"" against Uncle Winnie, but he
came off with flying colors, and, at last,
attained a notorcty that was known from
Little Rock way up to the Chickasaw Ma.
tion. 1t was Uncle Winnie, in fact, who
first inu reduced draw poker"" in those
upper regions. and he also did much to
give the present finish to the different
games known under the name of ""brag.
I But Uncle Winnie, for all this, was a
straightforward, honest man, never pro.
posed in his slife a game himself, and
woud have gone one year after another
without thinking about cards, if he were
not drawn into the game by his custom
erS and friends; and yet, so thoroughly
was his conversation seasoned with fig
urcs Of speech picked up at the table, and
from those who INDUCED in gaming, that
he rarely spoke two consecutive sentences
without one of them smelling strongly of
the shop. We remember the fact that q
venerable and worldwide. known Bishop,
travelling from Tennessee TO Louisiana,
stopped over night at Cncc- Winnie -
The old man had great respect for the
bishop, and after supper he sat himself
down, and highly grauhcd his ""o!d wo.
man"" by listening to n long talk about
the ""neccSSily Of being saved"" Uncle
Winnie every now and then Ginning in
with a commentary as follows:


THAT'S light Bishop; the devil goes
about. as YOU say, with pack of marked
cards in his pocket, and will cheat whJ.
ever plays with him.


That's right, Bishop, an honest life,
when you are played out, is braggin'
hand, all aces nothing can beat it,""


That's right, Bishop; rcvcr knowcd
a man that cheated that didn't get caught
at last, and perhaps lynchcd, or at least
put OH the boat at the first wood-yayd.""


That's right, Bishop; the Bible is a
truup- thar's no mistake about that""
In the course Of time Uncle Winnic's 5
oldest son, boy Of some eighteen years
ofaGe, was most cXpectediy invited to
lot thr,, IL, of 'H.voe
A distant relative, who desired an assist.
ant, offered great inducements. and Win
lie junior, a real chip Of the old block,
and a real honor to Arkansas, made his
preparations for the first time to leave
home. His mother treated the thing a
good deal as all mothers do, and filed up
the time before his departure with crying,
packing up a trunk, and making cake
fiXins.' Old Winnie took most grasp.
ing and philosophical view Of the matter
He remarked that life was pack Of car DIS,
and that our success depended upon how
they were dealt out. He said he knew
fellows who never coulb get above four
spot, and never enough of them to make
= more nor pair He'd knowed others,
.agin, who always had their hands full OF
queens and aces, and even if the deal run
low, they would get two low pairs or three
duces, that were even better in this case
than ""picters."" In short, Uncle Winnie
said some men had luck; play as they
would, they couldn't, in fact, help win.
ning whether they Set down with green
ones, or took shy at ""the tiger""


AT last the boy was about to take his
departure ; his mother gave him her last
kiss and her most fervent blessing, and
Uncle Winnie accompanied him to the
wagon that was 10 take him to the steam
boat landing. The moment for leaving
came; he had held up wonderfully all
through the preliminaries. but now his
heart was too full, and he broke out as
follows:


bob, you are about leaving home for
strange parts. You're going to throw me
out of the game, and 60 it alone. The
odds is agin you, Bob, butremember al
ways that industry and perseverance are
the winning cards; they are the bowers.


Book farming and all that sort of thing
will do well to fill up with, like small
trumps, but you must have the bowers to
back 'em, else they amt worth shucks.-
If luck runs agin you pretty strong, don't
cave in and look like sick chicken on q
rainy day, but hold your head up and
make 'em believe you're flush of trumps ;
then they won't play so hard agin you.


give lived and Travelled around some,
Bob, and I've found out that as soon as
folks thought you held weak hand,
they'd buck agin you strong. So when
you're sorter weak, keep on bold front,
but play cautious: be satisfied with a
pint. Many'S the hand I've seen euchred
cause they played for too much."

 9th corps this morning carried two more re. doubts, forming part of the defenses of Pc. tersburg. capturing 450 prisoners and guns. Our successes are being followed up.

 OEr forces withdrew from within fifty wards Of the cnemys intrenchments at Cold liar. Dor, made flank movement of an average of about fifty five miles march, crossing the Chicahominy and James rivers, the latter 2,OOO feet wide and e4 feet deep at the point of crossing, and surprised the enemy's rear at Petersburg. This was done without the loss ot wagon or piece of artillery, and only about one hundred and fifty stragglers were plcked up by the enemy. In covering this movement, Warren's corps and Wilson's cav- aafy nad frequent skirmishes with the enemy, eacn losing iron. 50 to 60 killed and wounded, uu' ihhic'ihg an equal if not greater loss upon the enemy. The 18th corps, Gen. Smitha: were transferred from White House to Bermu. da Hundred by water, moved out to near Pa. tersburg, the night of their arrival, and sur. prsed, or rather captured the very strong works northeast of Petersburg, before sufH. cient force could be got in them by the enemy to hold them. Smith was joined the night following this capture by the 2d corps, which in turn captured more of the eneniy's re. doubts further south, and this corps was fol. lowed by the 9th, with the result above stated. All the troops are now up except two diyis- ions covering the wagon trains, aEd they will be up to night.

 The enemy in their endeavors to reinforce Petersburg abandoned their works in front of Bermuda Hundred. They no doubt expected troops from north of the James river to take their place before we discovered it. General Butler took advantage of this and moved n force at once upon the railroad and plank road between Richmond and Petersbur0. which l hope to retain. Too much credit can. not be given the troops and their commanders for the energy and forttude displayed during the last five days. Day and night has been all the same, no delays being allowed on any account.

 Later unofficial dispatches show that at 8 o'clock Saturday morning, the enemy still oc. cupied Petersburg Major Morton was killed in an assault Friday.

 Nothing to-day from Sherman or Hunter. EDWIN NJ. STANTON.

 An official dispatch received at the War Office from City Point, dated Sunday morn. ing, brings the intelligence that our army has ; advanced 10 within q mile of Peterborough. where they found the enemy strongly entrench. ed. Several assaults were made but were up- successful. Our troops have, however, strong i, y lntrenehed their advanced position. It is supposed from the force within the enemys new works. that Beauregard has received re- inducements from Lee. Our army, from the ntren chments they now hold, fully command the city of Petersburgh, and number of shells have already been thrown into the city, setting fire to several houses, and doing other serious damage. The rebels, to defend Pc. tersburgh, have been obliged to evacuate their position in front of Bermuda Hundred, which was occupied immediately by Gen. Butler, be- fore Lee could get his troops across the James The Richmond and Petersburgh Railroad, according to one account, has also been taken possession of by our forces, and General Grant Lopes to be able to hold it. His description of these recent movements fro the Chlckahomiuy are admirably concise, and drawn so plainly and forcibly and is such a vivid descri ption of these great events as to impress every one with the consummate skill with which they were planned and executed. As bold strategic movement it is altogether the greatest Of the war. During the charge of the Second Ninth and Eighteenth Corps. on Thursday last, each Corps took several re- doubts, and the Ninth Corps captured four guns and four hundred and fifty prisoners. It Is said Lee has moved 34,000 men forward to the support of Beauregard at Petersburgh, These reports, however, are probably only con. jectures.

 An official report from General Sherman, 7 received Sunday, states that during the dark ness of the previous night, the enemy gave way, and that our pckcts have penetrated his entire line from right to left. The whole ar. my is in hot pursuit, and is as far as the } Chattahoochee. General Sherman adds II start at once for Marietta""

 Richmond papers of the l4th give their yer [ sion of Grants late movements, from which it appears that the rebels were again outgene:al- ed, for Grant had been gone eighteen hours before they found it out. And then it was un- certain to them whether he had moved to cross James river, or merely to make it bis base for another effort against Richmond from the Pen- insula.

 About two hundred acres of the Arlington estate, immediately around the old Mansion House, Washington have been set apart as c burial ground for soldiers who may happen to die there.

 The ladies sewing circle in Boston made in the season just closed 5,384 articles of cloth ing, 3,420 of which was sent to the Sanitary Commission, and the rest to the sufferers of East Tennessee.

 ] On the 10th of June the London Crystal Palace, had been open ten years During that | pcIiOu lL Has Uceu FISlL6u Uy Lne 0Xtr2OTuluhry number of more than fifteen millions and quarter of persons.

 Petersburgh is the grand centre of five lines of railroads. The City Point road 10 miles long, the Norfolk road 80 miles long, the Great Western road l64 miles to Weldon, sad 162 miles to Wilmington, the Petersburg and Lynchburg road l23 miles, and the Richmond and Petersburg road P miles.

 The explosion on Friday at the Washing. ton arsenal originated in the spontaneous com bustion of fireworks placed to dry in tbs sun befsre open windows. Secretary Stanton promptly repaired to the scene of the calamt' ty to succor the unfortunates.

 Four hundred thousand soldiers letters were sent from the Washington Post office on Frh day and Saturday. They were Pnnc'Pan from the Army of the Potomac. Ihsir 'osAs weight was upward of six tons.

 There are now fifteen thousand patlente ir tbo bosnitals of the Department of Washing ton Fifteen hundred conva!eseents have beep retmr,ed to the front within the last two weeks. weeks The number will be largely apgmsut."

New YORK, July 12.-The World prints
the following extract from private letter,


Lexington, Va, June 12-- Yesterday we
marched from Medway here, being quicken
ed as we were advancing by the sound Of
Crooks guns engaged with Gen. -, and
who held This place. They defended it with
great acrimony, burning the bridge and,
playing on the hills as We came up, with
shell, and bushwhacked us from behind ev.
cry tree. This was madness ON their part.
IS we had beaten them before being Joined
by Gems. Crook and Averill, and are now of
course able to whip them twice over.

for Breckenridge, who has been detached
with his division from Lees army to drive
US back; or at least halt US between there
and Richmond or Lynchburg, whichever we
should strike for. 1t is supposed the plan
is to put the broken brigades of the Valley
under Imboden, Jenkins, Mudwall Jackson,
McCausland and Jones, and to get here a
division of Lees veterans, and then give us
another try for the valley.

fully employed by Grant, he can send troops

will hold all bis force in Richmond. this COL
umn can make the rebel capital untens BILE

main artery Of supplies.

An evening cotemporary of ours-suppose
we cay the Republican-perpetrated the joke
yesterday evening OF getting out an extra with
considerably less than nothing in it, ""a way it
has,) and also In its own default OF news put
its foot into it to the extent Of denying the truth
fuiness of the news in our extra.


To its o6cious denial OF the facts we stated,
and especially that to the effect that Sheridan
had effected junction with the forces of Gen.
Butler, which that paper contradicted so elab-
orately, we commend the following Official
bulletin from Secretary Stanton to Gen. Dix,
which corroborates our statements to the letter:


""WAsHINGTON, May Is, $50 A.. M.-An oficia

which affords ground for Inference that Lee

the advance Of the 5th and 9Th corps.


Nothing later than $50 a. m. Of yesterday has
been received from the army by this Depart.
ment. All the wounded that reached Belle
Plain yesterday evening have arrived here.
The surgical reports from the headquarters Of
the army state that the condition of the supplies
Is satisfactory and the wounded are doing well.


The medical director at Belle Plain reports
everything at that point as satisfactory. The
surgical arrangements have never been SO COM

The claim Of the Republican that its news is

men here, but we don't see why it should.

Mac Arone is certainly on the Republican,

through the Republican the ne WIS that Grant, on
the first day of the fighting, had driven Lee to
the wall and to Richmond. He it was who yes.

We have already heard from the divisions Of
Generals Averill and Crook, and this recent

II is to be observed, as comment on Wash

Hunter, still Weary from the Lynchburg raid
and only brought 10 tie isont by incredible ex
ertions, are the only forces We have yet heard
OF as vigorously and successfully pursuing the

the troops sent from Washington directly for
this purpose, under Major General Wright
Ii the news Of q battle OF Leesburg shall
prove to be true, we shall doubtless hear more
OF that column. As we announced two days
ago, tho rebels seemed to think of max

Their trains and plumber southwark. To the
reported engagamons, however, we give little
cr2dit, it bsirg only remote possibility that
General Hunter would have pushed bis columns
south and west OF that point IL Major General
Wright, who was at Poolesville six DAYS ago,
still stood confranted by any serious force Of

chance Of finding any efficient cavalry force to
'.make them afraid The moment, however,
that the rebel incursion North reached General
Hunters cara, lie Issued orders for the instant
purchase OF oil horses Immediately available
for cavalry service in Eastern Ohio and West
Virginia; and the result is that we have to day,
in hot pursuit Of the retreating enemy very

There is ono gratifying circumstance in cou-

upon The attention of the country the imbe-

The hfst annual meeting of the subscribers
to the Merchants Exchange was held at their
room yesterday. There was large attend
ance, and much interest was manifested
Jonas II. Perley, Esq, Chairman of the Board
Of Directors, presided who read the report of
the Directors for the past year, which present
ed the affairs of the institution in a aattering
condition.


When the subject of opening Merchants
Exchange was agitated, ii was not supposed,
by the most sanguine, that more than 80 sub
scribers could be obtained. Ii that number
could be had, it was supposed the institution
could be carried through the year. But such
was the enthusiasm manifested by our mer-
chants, and III fact all classes of our citizens,
that. according to the report of the Directors,
the members of the Exchange now number
about three hundred and seyenty-five, and it
is placed on permanent foundation. The
receipts Of the past year have amounted to
S2l00, and the expenditures have been $500
leaving a balance in the treasury OF 5000.
The courtesy of the telegraph companies in
furnishing dispatches, was acknowledged, aad
other matters of interest were mentioned in
the report.


Messrs. John Lynch, James o. Brown, w.
s. Dana, Augustus f. Stevens, and F. o. Lib
by, were chosen Directors for the ensuing
year.


r. G.. Hersey Esq, President OF the Board
Of Trade, offered the following preamble and
ba q ""A
ing deserved compliment to Mr.. Rich, edi-
tor Of the Price Current, for his efforts to es-
tablish a Commercial paper here, which is
of so much benefit TO the mercantile interests
of our city.


Whereas, The publishers Of the Portland
Price Current and Maine Shipping List"" have
announced their intention of enlarging the
same, provided sufficient encouragement is ex-
tended them TO warrant the undertaking; and
whereas, the Importance of publication de-
voted 20 the commercial and business inter
ests Of the city and State, (if properly con-
Quoted, J cannot well be oyerestimated; there
fore, be ii


Ees0tced, That the contemplated enlarge
ment of the portland Price Current"" meets
our most hearty approval, and we pledge our
best efforts to increase its circulation and ad-
yertising patronage.


The resolution was unanimously adopted
Mr.. Rich, in response, said that he should inn
mediately enlarge his paper.


Some interesting remarks were made by W.
s. Dana and +. @. Libby, and the meeting
then adjourned.


The subscriptions for the new year then
commenced, and there was a great rush to the
Superntendent's desk for that purpose."

! Secretary of the Democratic Club.
| The meeting was then ably addressed by
| His Honor Mayor Rice. of your city. who
analyzed the acts and doings of the present
administration, from the inauguration Of the
Union-splitter down. The audience were
profoundly interested in his lucid exposition
Of the principles OF the democracy. Mr.. Rice
was followed in an able speech by \. Waugh.
ey, Esq. of Seneca, and he in turn by G. W.
! Armstrong. of Brookield and f. Davis, Esq,
Of Allen.


! The democrats in this locality are alive and
Will give Il good account of themselves in
November. Their most ardent aspiration is
that the usuper and tyrant Lincoln may be
hurled from that chair which he is so unwor-
thy Of &C cupying.


3he following constitution was presented
and adopted by the club,


''All persons who are opposed to the re-
election of Abraham Lincoln, whose inability
and imbecility has become a byword and re-
proach amongst the people whose acts of
Tyranny overleaps the bounds Of European
despotisln, whose hypocrisy exceeds that of
| the Pharisec ci Old. whose bufoonery excites
the contempt of the world, whose hatred of
his own race and love of the negro has chan
ged the policy of the war from the high and
noble effort Of compelling obedience to the
constitution, into negro stealing and eXpedi-
tons for cotton thieving and plunder; all Who
are in favor Of maintaining this c9rFAtry as 1t
always has bees until recently, free and hap
py, aad safe asylum for all political offend
ers against the tyrants of the old world, who
are in favor of peace and restoration Of the
Union under the constitution, shall be mem
bers ofthis Club."

lay before our readers this morning, from our
armies East and West is very interesting, and
altogether furnishes o cheerful view Of the pro-
gress OF the general campaign.


General Shermal has suffered severe re-
pulse in attempting to carry BY storm forti-
fed mountain, occupied by the enemy, on the
direct line of his march to Atlanta; but as the
result, 10 . military view, was only . failure
by . direct attack to dissodge the eDemy, we
lave no doubt that the infall.ble expedient Of
a flank movement will remove him. This is
not the first nor the secopd time Ia which
General Sherman In this campaign haS been
repulssd from some difficult and strongly
intrenched position Of the enemy; but
in every case, after feeling the ground and dis
covering that It would be cheaper to 60 around
instead Of adhering to the purpose of going
over the enemy's works, flank movement has
Of battles and fanking operations whereby
General Lee has been pushed back from the
Rapidan to Richmond has pushed back Joe
Johnston from the northern border OF Georgia
into the heart Of the State. When turned out
of this last hiding place we guess his next
to be turned out again by another flank move
ment. The decided superiority Of Shermans
army over that Of Johnston, infantry, artillery
and cavalry, renders the former equal to ali
contingencies.


From the grand army Of the East, immedi-
ately under the eye Of General Grant, We have
the gratifying information that 1t is steadily
closing in between the rebel capital and its
vital railway communications with the South;
that they are already cut of from the Weldon
to the Danvile line, and that within few
days, in order to regain them, General Lee viii
be compelled to leave his Notifications and risk
his fortunes in the open deld. The crossing to
the south side OF the James river of Sheridsn's
powerful cavalry column will soon determine
this question, whether General Lee will con-
sent to be completely cut of from the South or
will hazard the open fields to reopen his COM
municatlons.


In this connection the brief despatch from
General Hunter in reference to his operations
in the fruitful region west Of Lynchburg is sat
isfactory. He reports encouraging and unva-
rying successes; and, though no gives as yet no
details Of his movements, the nature Of his dam
ages to the enemy may be inferred from the
hints Of the Richmond journals Of his remorse-
less appropriations spdfy yeetruction Of rebel
depots OF military stofes. DC.


East and West, in spite Of temporary checks
and drawbacks, the work of the campaign goes
steadily forward. Let the administration show
some energy and activity In strengthening the
Army Of the Potomac, and in bringing the great
feet Of iron-clads and gunboats on the James
river Xinto . little practical exercise, and
grumblers and skeptics and Wall street gold
gamblers, in sympathy with the rebellion, will
speedily be silenced. Let our readers, mean
time, be assured that the ground gained by
Gen. Grant he holds, and that he has the rebel
lion firmly within bis grasp.


Presidens Lincoln and His Incompetent


Cabiaet.


That famous gathering Of officeholders and
shoddy contractors usually styled the Balti-
more Convention seems to have incurred the
displeasure Of President Lincoln. II was or
dered to meet upon a certain day and rcnoi-
nate Old Abe and then adjourn. Instead Of
this the Convention exceeded these instruc-
lions, and dared to hint, by one Of the resolu-
lions in the platform, that imbeciles ought to be
turned out of the Cabinet. The President was
equally sstonshed and indignant that clique
Of men, duly hired to do certain job and duly
rec ompensed therefor, should presume to die
tate to him about such matters; and, conse-
quently, be has not paid the slightest attention
10 that resolution.


We agree with The President that it Ia very
vexat;ous to find fellows so oficious as TO prof
fer unwelcome advice when they were en-
ployed simply to renominate and endorse the
present administration. If this were Turkey,
ard Lincoln were pacha Of three tails, he
would be fully justified in bow -stringing al!
those meddlesome and impertincnt ser
wants OF his who were sent as dele
gates TO the convention. But as this
is at least nominahy republic, and
as Mr.. Lincoln is as yet only plain President,
with great many smutty tales, be is unfortu-
nately deprived Of the power to punish the dele
gates as they deserve. Under the circumstances,
too, IL might even be we'll for him to yield TO
the inpudent demand OF the persons engaged
TO renominate him. His organs and his orators
are perpctually asserting that the Baltimore
Convention was an expression Of the peoples
will, a voice from the popular heart, and all
that sort Of thing: so that, in order to keep up
the illusion, Lincoln should consent to be
guided little by what the convention re.
solved. Not TO do this is to expose his own
trick, aAd 10 practically confess that his renomi-
nation was the act Of o set Of puppets, un-
worthy of regard or respect when they squesled
out more than they had been told 10 utter. An
immediate reconstruction Of the Cabinet might
help Mr.. Lincoln with bis own party and gain
him soms adherents from among the outsiders.

all due Difference to our Governor, Who may be
| supposed and doubtless has more fully consid-
cred the matter in all its bear ngs II is certainly
| bad economy to sacrifice the government Of our
State to save expense. II we allow our civil
government to go by default, it will not only
have bad effect upon the spirits and patriotism
OF our people, manyiof whom may, and already
begin to consider our State government defunct.
but it will give color abroad to the Federal as
sumption that we are already conquered. This
idea is industriously circulated there. late
number of Harper's Weekly has chart repre-
senting the States subjugated by Federal armies
All of Arkansas is included in the subjugated
| territory. We ourselves know that their power
does not extend one inch beyond the pickets Of
their military encampments. But if we exhibit
nothing of the vitality of State government in
any part of the State, we cannot be surprised to
find the Federal representation of our condition
| taken correct


This is important When forced to negotia-
tions for peace, the Q. S. governmcn, will con-
tend for the principle of uti possidslis-that is,
to retain all they have. If we have no organ
lzed State government actually working, to
sustain and enforce our laws we can make
but poor showing against the assumption
that our State government is subverted. and
one under Federal authority substituted in its
place. II is far better that they should not have
| plausible showing for such an existing fast.
whether the principle be ceded or not. Be4des
that, great many people, unaccustomed to de-
eide for themselves. are strongly inclined to seek
rest from their troubles by submission to the
| government de facto or what they conceive to
be such Our State government, under our
Constitution, should he constantly asserting itself
as the true government de fdcto. Whilst lying
dormant, it may not be recognized as such.
| We would like much to see our county and
municipal organizations all restored, and our
courts in session over all portions of the State
not actually occupied by Federal armies. The
sheriff should again be the supreme executor of
civil and criminal law throughout the land
Crime which now stalks shamefully abroad,
would hide its hideous head in secrecy as before.
The grand jurors should again become the con-
servators of the lives and property of the citi-
zens The civil arm would be sustained by the
military. Soldiers, either the reserved forces or
those of the regular organization, would always
1 be permitted and ordered to lend the sheriff their
aid in the execution Of the laws. Under such a
state of things men would be no longer shot
down in open day by iendish assassins, nor ciii-
zens be robbed before their eyes Of horses and
other property by banditti, either falsely as
suming to be soldiers of the Confederacy, or, if
such, disgracing the cause by their crimes.
| Lynch law is no remedy. Itis alarming to all
who reat ct that, when once inaugurated under
public sanction, the most innocent ore no longer
safe from the hatred and malice of others who
may choose to suspect and punish them of crime.
However excusable in particular cases, the prac-
tics is horrible. There should be left no pretext
| for it in the fact that our courts are all dead.
Nor is there any reason to apprehend that the
conflict of civil and military authority might
endanger our unity. There is no conflict. Each
has its own sphere. The courts yield to all le-
gitimate authority vested in the War Depart
raent, The commander of the Trans Mississippi
department has clearly shown in many cases, and
in different ways, that he is willing to bow TO the
majesty of the laws, and assist in their enforce
ment by lending when practicable, the force o.
the military arm. And it may be noticed more
over. that in no case has conflict yet arisen IL
any Southern State between the courts and mill
tsry authorities wh;c ;ch has not been coon adjust
ed without any breach of harmony.


From these considerations we seem to perceive
many advantages to our citizens at home, the
political interests Of our State, and the cause o
the Confederacy. to arise from . small amoun
of judcious legislation. Some of it is indispen
sibie for instance, some provision fer the pun
ishment of feonies less than capital. We hav'
no longer the control of our penitensiary. ""ha
then. Shall we fold our arms. and say ther
shall be no punishment for crime!


Provision is already made by law against tn
collection of debts, and for continuing cases Oh
account Of absence of parties or witnesses in tn
army. No soldier interest could be affected
by our courts-


A vigorous State government operating TO en-
force the laws, and protect life and property IN
those parts of the State unoccupied by the enemy
vonld do much to sustain such condition o
society a. would be most effective in supporting
the army, Encouraging desertions, and preserv
ing calm and steady the patriotism OF the people
The principles of many cannot be trusted in tn
decentralization which always attends civil an
archy Besides that. such government woui'
! extend itself Immediately, with all 1t. vita
power, over such counties as We might recove
from the enemy. 1t wopld follow our army ant
take possession of the soil as rapidly as the enc
nv mi yht be forced back As the last hostile
foot withdrew, we would find ourselves al:ead.
a fully restored State, without any inter-regnum
| and free of the embarrassments which attend al
| goyernm ents renasceat from a condition of abe,
| ance.


A meeting of the Legislature is necessary TO
the perpetuity of our government. The term
of members Of the lower House and one half tn
Senators expire next October. If our civil or
ganizations are not kept up. there will be M
regular elections, ana the Legislature will bt
dead. 1t will require two years or a change O
Constitution to revive it. Meanwhile, the who'll
shadow of State sovereignty would reside in th'
| person of the Governor alone. 1t will look like
subjugation certainly, and will be so considered

Drury's Bluff. was yesterday de sloped into q

forces on the south side II Petersburg, extend
ing 90 far as to cover the railroad leading west
from that city to Lynchburg.


The brief report from General Grant OF
Yesterdays operations Ii very encouraging
and strongly suggestive Of the near approach
OF the crowning events Of the war. He re-
ports that Warren attacked and carried the
enemy's line on their extreme right, capturing
q number Of prisoners, and that General Meade
moved from bis left Extending Warrens move
meut) and carried the enemy's line near
Poplar Grove church. Now, according to
al elaborate and carefully compiled map of
Virginia before US, Poplar Grove is on the
Petersburg and Lynchburg, or Southside, Rail-
road, some 6fteen miles west Of the first named
city, and about the same distance west from
the position held by General Grant on tho


Weldon road. The point thus gained cuts of
the rebel army in front Of p Petersburg from its
direct connecting link with the Danville road.


aud Lees supplies from that line for Petersburg


must be brought round by way of Richmond.
| But, while the road between the two cities


must now be strongly guarded TO prevent its


seizure by General Butler the junction Of the
| Danyille and Lynchburg roads is now within a
days march Of q cavalry raid from General


Mcade's army. With the loss Of that junction


the James River Canal to Lynchburg will be
| the only line Of subsistence remaining TO Lee;
for the whole country north of Richmond has


been completely eaten up between the two
armics In this bread and beef consuming ca m
paign.


In this view of General Lees situation the
question naturally recurs, how was 1t that the
important position Of Poplar Grove church was
wrested from him SO easiys We have the ex-
| PLANTATION In another branch Of yesterdays
operations The enemy yesterday, In three

have maintained. This simple explanation


discloscs ais incapscity to hold his present ex-


tended lines with his depleted army against
the heavily reinforced columns OF General


Grant; and bere we perceive, too, tho sagacity


of Grant In giving his adversary employment

II must be apparent now to the most in-


credulous copperhcad that Richmond is In

bis unfortunate Lieutenant in the Shenandoah


valley Is calling for assistance, and that Grant,


thoroughly comprehendng bis own ad-


vantages from the weakened condition OF


the enemy, is moving forward in the right way


aud at tho right time TO turn bis opportunity


TO the best account. The attack upon General


Butler betrays not only the Importance OF But


ler's new position, but that either the strength


or the fighting spirit OF Lees veterans Il gone;


for in hazarding the Soutbsds Railroad TO dis


lodge Butler from Chapns Bluff Lee must


have felt that the movement was called for BY


the most immediate danger 10 Richmond.

Position or Ge.ersl Grant The Ena


Near at Ssaad.


The removal of the Army OF the Po!omae
from tie north side Of The Chickahominy to the
south side of the james river places Geoe1e'
Grant in most admirable position for decisive
work against Les's shattered aud diminished
army and the rebel capital.


The capture OF Petersburg Of Itself Is sn i'm
portant step towards the reduction Of Rich
mond; tnt 1t is only Jan item among the many
from tho north to the south side Of the city
First, the transfer Of his srmy from the deadly
swamps aud jungles of the Chickahominy to the
dry. rolling, healthy country between Peters-
burg ard Richmond is . matter for general
congratulation. Secondly, the entire army Of
General Butler. powerful reinforcement. has
TINS been added to the Army OF the Potomac,
together with the iron-cIads and guuboats Of
Admiral Lee-anotheY tremendous reinforce
ment, Thirdly, In transferring his base OF
supplies to the James river, General Grants
active army is again practically reinforced to
the extent OF the fifteen or twenty thousand
men relieved from the duty Of guarding the
railroads and common highways used on the
Chickahominy for transportation purposes


But, most important Of all, in . strategical
view, General Grant. with tho magnificent
army which ho has now concentrated imme-
diate'y under his eye on the south side Of the
James river, at once cuts of Richmond from all
the Southern railroad lines through which the
city and Lees army are fed from day to day.
Lee must. then, make up his mind very
soon either to give battle, in order
to reopen his communications with his
sources of subsistence, or to abandon
Richmond undar cover Of the night. in order to
save bis army; for If he attempts the expert
ment Of shutting himself up behind his foreG
cations, like Pemberton, hs will inevitably SUI
fer the fate Of Pemberton. We think 1t highly
probable that Lee will repeat his old trick o!
Antietam, Gettysburg and Wi,liainsport-a
basty evacuation between two days-carryiag,
this time, JEFF. Davis and his Cabinet along
with him (the rebel Congress, taking time by
the forelock, have already cleared out), and
that he will move off up the James river, on
the north side, along the canal, towards Lynch.
burg, which is the only route Of escape likely to
furnish subsistence for his army.


General Lee would have now the opportu-
nifty for stealing march upon Washington, if
he only had the means and facilities for moving
in tha. direction. But all tho railroads to the
north and northwest from Richmond have been
so seriously broken up By Generals Grant and
Mosby that Il will take thousands of men
and months Of labor to repair them; and
+ they were not broken up they would
be useless to Lee with the whole intervening
country between Richmond and Waahi ngton
exhausted OF its provisions Take for instance,
the Shenandoah valley. In 1868, In advance Of
hin Northern aggressive movement from the
Rspidan, General Lee established convenient
depots Of provisions, from point to point, down
thousand men, on limited rations, was enabled
to reach the bountiful supplies Of the loyal
States OF Maryland and Pennsylvania But
how Is It nowi From Harper's Ferry up to
Staunton, distance Of one hundred and thirty
miles, the Shenandoah valley has been thor
oughiy secured and cleaned out by General
Hunter, while the country beyond Staunton,
towards Lyuchburg aud the Southwest, has
been as thoroughly harvested by Generals Ave
rill and Crook.


The rebel army In Richmond, therefore, can
not move northwArd, because the roads and all
tho facilities in that direction for army trans
porta;ion are destroyed and because the couu-
try Ia exhausted OF its cattle aud corn pigs
and sheep, bacon and poultry, everything. On
the other hand, the army of General Grant
stands now across the roads on the south side
OF Richmond. To give him battle there Lee
will be utterly defeated; to staad stiil IN Rich
mond is, on his part 60 prepare for surrender
a ""a Pemberton; and what, then, can be do but
steal or in the night up the James river, aad
next, by roundabout way, move down upon
the desperate enterprise OF junction with
Joe JohustonY


In any event. the fall OF the rebel capital ia not
for off, and then, as with the lose OF Richmond
and the retreat or decisive defeat OF Lee, Old
Virginia will have no further interest in yenl.
Davis, the seventy-fve thousand veteran Vir-
gna soldiers now 10 hs service will leave IL
in disgust che people OF North Carolina will
thea revolt against him, his kingdom will fall
to pieces, and Nassau or Mexico will be bis only
chance Of escape.

A SoLD ENGINEER SELLs.-A rather amus- ing adventure occurred on New Jersey rail- road. One of the engineers, we will call him Snipkins had been sweet on a young lady, whose name we may disguise in that of Shaw Icy. Wicked wags insinuated that consequen' ces of disagreeable nature to both parties l were to grow ont of it, and that the statutes of the sovereign State of New Jersey. in the case, would be enforced. Snpkins grew ner- vous. A New York gentleman, W ho had been informed of the saw,' got out at one of the stations, and going up to the locomotive, in quired if there was man there named Snip kins.

 'That's my name, answered the unconscious engineer.

 At the same time he produced roll of doc I uments.

 What business?' enquired the engineer. 'That matter about Snawley,' was the an swer. Couldn't you settle it by marriage, or something2 hate to make the arrest, and-' ! put bell you Iuefe IS uOtnlug Ol tno soFt, exclaimed the engineer there never has been-there's nothing in it-and the fact is-' he continued, wiping the precipitation from his forehead--my name isn't Snipkins.'

 Pooh pooh! that won't do. You said you were snipkins-every body says you are Snipkins-and know you are. Besides, here is the requisition of the Governor of New York, and the order of Gov. Parker. Where do you get of, at Eatontown or Red Hook7' | 'At-Red Hook was the answer. l Very well-Ill wait until you get there, and then--unless you agree to marry the girl ito New York you go.'

 And the New Yorker went back to the train, where he regaled the party with an ac- count of his adventure.

 When they arrived within mile of the junction, the passengers felt the train sudden ly stop. On looking out they saw the loco motive make tracks for the depot on its own hook. The New Yorker shook his papers at the engineer, but the engine beam went the faster. After a long detention, the locomo- tive returned and picked up the detached cars i; but, siugularly enough, there soas c di6srent engineer in charyel
