binding upon The people, and first receive their free

FELLOW CITIzENs:-Delegated by Won. |
rom different portions OF this State, ior the
solemn purpose of re-nodelling your ORGANIC
LAW, whist engaged in the performance Of
Lhls most interesting task, our attention has
been called to one or two important facts not
connected with our conventional
abors, fair exposition of which 10 YOU at
-he present time, we deem II our imperlous
duty to lurnlshl The election of President
and Vice President OF the United States. is |
now almost at hand, and il is truly remarka- !
5le, that although the State of Mississippi is |
as deeply interested in tins election as any
member OF the coniederacy, yet so imperfect
are the arrangements hitherto made i'm refer
ence TO this important matter, that there are
THREE DISTINCT electoral tickets
now presented to your notice, all OF which |
profess 10 be friendly TO the existing adnnls-
Iration, and to be favorable to the reelection
Dt the illustriOus statesman and warrior who
now administers the civil affairs of this Re
public, with as signal honor and SUCCESS as
have heretofore marked his military opera
tlons. One OF these tickets has brought into
the names of Andrew Jackson
and PhlllpP. Barbour; with what prOpriety
It Is unnecessary Tor us to determine. Il is
sufficient ON our part TO suggest that Mr. Bar
bour cannot possibly be elected; & that there
is nothing like a certainty Of his getting more
than the votes of one State; the plainest in
dlcations indeed having already disclosed
themselves IN proof of the utter unreasona-
beness OF the supposltion of his even ebtaln-
ing the support of the State in which he re-
sides; Notwithstanding he is much and deser-
vedy respected, not only there but through
out ihe union for his abilities, his great MORAL
worth and hIgh-toned republican principles.
The other two tickets referred TO are both IN
fayorSol General Jackson and Martin Van
Buren, and differ from each other only IN re-
gard to one OF the electoral candidates propos-
ed; one oil these tickets being composed OF the
names of General Thomas Hlnds, Gen. lii
ram c. Runells, Gen. Wiley p. Harris, and
Col William Dowsing, the other substituting
the name OF Col Samuel Hunter, for that Of
General IInds Already the Republican
strength is divided as before described, be-
tween Barbour and Van Buren, whereby ma
nv votes must necessarily be distracted iIom
the Jackson and Van Buren ticket. II the
remaining strength of the party IS AGAIN to
be DIVIDED, there is evidently great danger OF
the entire success of the Clay and Sergeant
ticket in Mississippi, a result which every
tue friend of the South would most deeply
deplore, and which would Immediately intlict
upon the character of the State, a dlscredlt
that would not soon be eilaccd. IL is there
