The Northeast Washington association met
last night at the corner Of ieth and streets

Maupin secretary. 1t was apparent from the
commencement that there was an impetuouS
and disorderly element present mostly from the
youth OF tnat section), and ciamorous for lynch
law. This disturbing delegation was from the
vigilance committee organized at the corner OF
Ith street and Maryland avenue on Saturday
night. After the meeting was opened differ
ence Of views in relation to the objects of the
meeting was apparent. The members of the
Northeast Washington association took the
ground that it was meeting OF the association,
while the youthful delegates were in favor of an
Indignation meeting and ventilation OF eXcit-
\ ing speeches They were finally persuaded to
leave the meeting, under the impression that
there would be another outside meeting
more In consonance with their views.
Mr.. Hughes moved that committee of safety
be formed, which should act when it became
necessary, the committee to be selected by a
committee of three appointed by the meeting.

plan, only he did not like to see him ashamed
to have his name in the newspapers as one OF
he had been challenged, he would explain that
he would be one OF the committee OF safety. A
young man named Jewett denied that any one
was ashamed to be known as member of this
committee. The young lady who had been
assaulted was SchooLmate of his, and he
would go as far as any one in vindicating her.
Col Morgan got the floor ana began to counsel
moderation, but the impetuous youths In the rear
of the room made so much disturbance that he
was unable to proceed. After they had left the
hall and quiet was restored. the previous dues-
tion was called and the motion laid on the table.
Mr.. Henley, from the committee on police, read
the new bill regulating the police force, now
pending in Congress. He advised the meeting
to cooperate in securing the passage of this
bill. and to discourage excitement. The asso-
citation could aid the District Commissioners by
going to the committees of Congress. He pre-
ferred the bill known as the Senate bill, with an
amendment which should be secured fix
ing the additional number Sof police at
$50 in place of $50. He said bill
would be presented TO the House increasing
the force to $50 men and tontng down the
clause in relation to the appointing of soldiers
and sailors exclusively. The Chair Thought one
point to be secured was the location of a Station
house in the northeast section OF the city. The
standing committee made a report on railroads
in which it was staf ed that subcommittee had
been appointed to go to Congress to urge the
adoption Of the union depot plan. Mr. Love,
from the committee on streets and alleys, re-
ported that subcommittee had been appointed
to look after the lighting of II and n streets

LEssoN Iil.--ln the third lesson there are many

that VIC have no hold for the appliance Of scientific

LESSON Iv-The ethnographer finds among the
myths ormany peoples savage and civilized the
story Of universal deluge. To some Biblical
scholars these are the suryiyols by tradition of the
story Of the Noachic deluge.


The question ismnny sided. We have TO discuss
the crcdibility Of human traditions, and science
hasno knowledge of an universal dclugc destroying
simultaneously the animals and plants of the
globe within the human period These, repeat
are open questions, and the Bible student must ap-

who searched to see If these things were So


The events intervening between this lesson and
the next are sweeping generalization of the fam

There are two ways by which these chapters may
be studied profltsbly-the one Is to take the Ian
guugc of the chapters themselves and TO distribute
the tribes therein named over the lands assigned
to them the other, to study carefully the present
populations of the globe racaly and lngistically,
aud TO trace them backward to the common source
from which they nrc all derived. need not say

BoILER-THE ENGINEER KILLED.


The tug Martha laid at the Pusey,
Jones & Co. Is wharf, this morning, all
ready to be overhauled and laid up
for the winter. A few minutes before
seven o'clock she was boarded by the
engineer, Theodore Miller.


What occurred during the next twen-
ty minutes will never be known. The
fire was gong as usual under the
boiler, and it is probable the engineer
stirred it up and put on the draft for
the purpose of getting up steam.
About quarter past seven O'Clock, the
workmen in the yard were startled by
heavy explosion from the Martha,
and one of the men on the steamer
Arbutus on looking up. just caught a
glimpse of the tugs boiler and smoke
stack disappearing in the water in the
middle of the Christiana. At the
same time shower of splinters and
broken timbers around the yard fur
ther indicated the extent of the explo-
sion.


The workmen at once rushed to the
wharf, and found the Martha bad
wreck. The boiler and the two heavy
beams by which it was fastened to the
boat, had disappeared. Half the deck
was torn up, the engine room was de-
nolished, and the pilot house blown to
pieces, the roof being hurled into the
yard, about twelve or fifteen feet from
the wharf. Mud and water were
splashed over the boiler shop, and had
it not been for the fact that the tide
vas low, which caused the boat to lay
under the wharf, much Injury might
have been occasioned in the yard.


The boat presented a strange sight,
Only the ash pan of the boiler was left,
the pipes were broken and bent, the
timbsrs splintered, and the engine
knocked out Of gear. Just in front of
the engine lay the


BODY OF THE RNGINEKR,


Theodore Miller. 1t was instantly
taken out and placed on the wharf,
but life was found to be extinct. 1t ID
probable his death was instantaneous
with the explosion of the boiler, and
that he never knew what killed him


The engineers death was the only
casualty, but a man named Lynch, an
employ6 of the boiler shop, was struck
in the back of the head by a flying
piece of CRATE bar, and SO severely cuI
that he had to stop work.

Tho game of ball at the National grounds
yesterday afternoon between the Baltimore
and National clubs was decided contrast TO
the exhibition on the day previous, be-
tween the Nationals aud Philadelphia Ath-
letics, and q game far moro enjoyable TO wit
ness. AS the record stands the two clubs that
played yesterday are the strongest in the
National association, aud either will have TO
work hard TO become victor.


The match was the finest contest played
here this season, aud continued 80 close
throughout that few errors would throw 1t
either way. So evenly were the teams
matched and so steady tho playing
that up TO the seventh innings
neither side had been able to score. In this
innings. however, tho Baltimores, by hits OF
Richmond, Brouthcrs and Deasley, earned one
run and took tho lead. In the next, Lynch
obtained his base on called balls, went to
second on McCellan's put-out on first, and
came home on Gerhardt's two-base hit to right
field, and the latter followed to the home plate
on Mansell's drive to the right field but would
have been out had Deasley held the ball we'll
felded by Clapp. In the last innings neither
side obtained run, although both sides got
men TO the third base.


1t would be difficult to discriminate between
the players where all did so well, but in bat
ting, Mansel, for the Nationals, took the lead, ,
going four times to tho bat and making four
hits.


The umpire was feature of tho game, dis
pleasing both sides, and varying very much
from that OF the umpires on the grand stand
The Baltimores were particularly complaining
as to the decisions, lut rs the umpire was OF
their own selection they swallowed the medi-
cine, dstsstcfu as it proved. The same clubs
play here again this afternoon at $3.50 o'clock.


If the lovers OF this sport desire to see good
ball playing they should attend or not grum.
bic because they remained ut home and missed
witnessing an interesting and fine contest.


Appended is the score:

 i WASHINGTON, March Ion Friday night

 last Miss Leins, living on Capitol Hill while on her way to church was struck down,

 stunned and carried into an open lot by a

 negro, who assaulted and robbed her of 8

 satchel and prayer book. It was almost two

 hours before she reached her home. Her

 throat was black with choking, one ear was almost cut from her head, and her body was covered with bruises caused by the cuffs and kicks she had received. She now lies in a critical condition. negro named Thomas Smothers was arrested yesterday and recog- nized as her assailant. At midnight 8 crowd of about one hundred men marched to the Seventh District station house and demanded the prisoner, but he had been removed to another station, where he was guarded by the entire reserve police force.

 Opinion in Judge Coles Case.

 WASHINGTON, March I'm the matter of Judge Coles and the Commo nwealth of Vir- ginia, petition for writ of habeas corpus, Justice Field dissents from the ruling of the court. J. D. Coles is judge of the PennsyI- vania County Court, and was arrested on warrant issued by the District Court on an indictment founded on the fourth section of the act of Congress, March 1st, 1875, which declares that no citizen shall be disqualified in any court of the United States, or any State, on account of race, color or previous condi- ton of servitude, and any officer charged with the duty of selecting or summoning jurors, who shall exclude or fail to summon any cit izen for the cause aforesaid, shall, on convic- tion thereof, be termed guilty of misde- meanor, etc.. etc. Coles is now held in cus- tody and his petition is for certiorari to said court, to send up the record of it's proceed ings, and for writ of habeas corpus, alleg ing that it's action was without jurisdiction, and hls imprisonment hereunder is unlawful, and he prays to be released therefrom. The commonwealth of Virginia presents similar petition, declaring that she is deprived of the services of her judicial officer. Judge Field, after stating the law of Virginia relative to summoning juries. holds that the United States District Court exceeded it's jurisdic- ton, that the act in the section referred to, so far as it relates to State courts, is unconstitu- tional and void Justice Clifford concurs in this dissenting opinion."

SIR: Why should lawyers ask new trial
for, defer justice to, and tax our District with
the expense of keeping, criminals who are SO
evidently guilty as the threA men who now
stand convicted for tho murder of Mr.. Hirth
II Pinn is innocent of Il participation In the
crime let him make full confession of what
he knows about it, as States evidence, and
thus save himself and bring speedy Justice to
the guilty parties. Honest men live in fear
aud trembling each hour while such men as
Cox, the man guilty of murder and robbery,
and doubtless of rape, too, from tho condition
in which Mrs. Hull was found, and Stone, the
wife murderer, aud tho murderers of young
Hirth can fmd men to defend them, stay tho
hand of justice, and cause the taxes money of
honest industrious people to be spent in hOus-
ing and feeding brutes-yes, wild, feroclous
beasts In human form. Let those lawyers
change places with the bereaved or wronged
ones; let one Of their daughters be treated as
Miss Lelns has been treated by brute, and
see if then they would stand up and plead for
the wrctches who are dark blot on our civili.
zation and a dark shame OH the weakness and
inclliciency Of our laws. To advocate tho
reign Of Judge Lynch is II fearful thought, but
this would be better than such daliauco with
criminals guilty OF such fearful crimes.

He was taken to the scene of the assault and identi- fed by his victim. vote of the posse was taken, and 1t was decided not to lynch him, but to allow the law to take its course. Kin placed in the guard house under strong guard. On Monday morning he was sent to Walterboro' to jail, still strongly guarded. On their way to Walterboro' the guard were overpowered by an armed force, consisting, it is said, largely of the relatives of the wo- man, and the prisoner was conveyed to a SC cluded spot in the woods, where he was kept till night About nine o'clock last night he was again confronted by the woman and again identified He was then taken to the woods, where preparations were made to hang him. At the last moment he confessed the crime, and also confessed to similar crime upon a colored woman in Newberry six years ago.

eral issues of the campaign.

ifest tendency to centralism and des-

The affairs of government. He urged
united support of the National,
State and County ticket in Novem-
ber.


Martin Farrell, Esq, Democratic

forts of the Republicans to conduct a
tloody shirt"" campaign, until the Maine
Lection knocked the life out of them,
when hey CHI pg dla e and began to play
upon the fears ui the worklrgmen by
| declaring that Democratic success meant
| free tr ,de, and Tree trade III, ant NO work
| and low wages. Mr.. Farrell also allu-
| led TO local stflirs, and referring to the
| disgraceful events Of Saturday night, said
he vas as much in favor as any man Of
giving the negro all his personal and po-
| litIcal rights, but the acceptance OF these
| rights must not be accompanied by
such offensive demonstrations. He
hop d there would be no further trouble
over this question but if there was that
not the negroes, but those who lead
them into trouble and then sneak out

AuOtner Otu


Hanc1cE.


NEW YORK, Oct. IA letter ia
published, of date May 18th, 1858,
from General Hancock to John B.
Haskin, of New York, in which he
thanks the latter for his advocacy
of him (Hancock) for President,
and says he knows there is wide
spread effort to make his name
prominent, and that that fact arose
probably from the Republican cam
didacy Of General Grant, and from
his share In the Southern work.
He was anxious for the triumph of
Conservatism over Radicalism, but
had no ambition to be President.
His position, II nominated, would
be embarrassing, having 10 pro-
fession but that of arms and possess
ing no riches; but he would not
hesitate on that account, if he could
win and others could not.


Another once for Grant.
NEW YORK, Oct. THE Even-
ing Commercial publishes a ,rumor
that General Grant and two
wealthy and influential Cleveland
friends Of Garfield-namely, Anna
sa Stone and 8. T. Everett-will
60 into the Board of Directors of
the Western Union Telegraph Com
pany at the next election.

Grmnt-FOwter latisrVew.


NEW YORK, Oct. 7th.-The
Herald says: Among the officers of
the army and particularly those
stationed on Governors Island,
and therefore brought intimately
Into relations with Hancock, there
is good deal Of feeling in regard
to the alleged Fowler. Grant inter-
view. The amendm ents Of the
original publications. said one of
the officers, make the matter worse
muddled than ever, and the next
thing In order will be for Grant to
explain his explanations. Grant
is bound, remarked another. to
make Garfield the next President.
He knows then that he will be a
power behind the throne, whereas
If Hancock is elected he will be
left out in the cold. He is not in
a position to ask favors of Han
cock. In the first place he treated
him most shabbily when he gave
Mcdowell, junior Major. General,
the command of this Department
and sent Hancock west, where he
did his utmost to cripple him,
while the latter was in command
at New Orleans. And what did
Hancock do, interrupted another
officer. He resented it. He would
would either command or he would
not, and when he found he could
not command, but must content
himself with being a figure-head, !,
he resigned and he did what any
high-spirlted officer would have
done. There is an unwritten his
tory that may be written.

was ordered to strip He partially undressed
himself, and requested one of the mob to un-
button his shirt as he could not reach the but

 WASHINGTON, Oct. 29.-The War office has received from Major Ofley, of the Nine teenth infantry at Fort Garland, a detailed statement of the killing of the Ute Indian Johnson and the subsequent lynching of the murderer by the Indians. The statement is made by Captain Pollock of the Twenty third infantry. After stating the facts al- ready published Captain Pollock says:

 believe whatever disposition made of the prisoner by the 1ynchers done quickly Most occurred about Il a. about thirty miles from the agency, and at o'clock the evening of the Indians engaged in it were at the agency Since the affair the Indians have been quiet and peaceable at any time They seem to be perfectly contented and satisfied, and there is no excitement about the agency. found no excitement until I came down the road and in the vicinity of Saguache, and that Jackson, the who had charge of the train in which the difficulty occurred I am well satisfied be brought about by aggression the Indians by the whites. With the light before cannot look upon voked murder of the Indian by reckless half drunken teamster and that the fate of the white clear of lynching which, much it is to be deplored is not an uncommon occurrence throughout the country and the midst of civilization and

 Major Offiey in forwarding the report says in conclusion: The man Jackson who was in charge of the train has told different stories about the affair. He told me the Indians did not fire at his party. To others he said they shot twice He has claimed relationship of every kind to the man who was killed. He told me he was one of his own boys He also states that Cline was home about an hour af- ter starting, whereas he did not get back un- til the next dry. The Indian Johnson had been employed by Colonel Mackenzie during the summer and was considered quiet and peaceable man."

township, this county, was putting in
his corn day or two ago with drill,
which was draE En by mare belonging
to Mr.. Lynch, and ridden by an old
man whose birthplace is the Emerald
Isle. After making few rounds Mr..
Lynch discovered that the old man,could
not manage the mare very well. and
supposed that it was owing to a curb
bit that was being used, which he con-
cluded to change, and another bride
was procured. As soon as the one
with the curb bit was stripped from
her head the old mare started off at
full speed, with the Irishman on her
back, and dragging after her the drill.
An eyewitness to the affair speaks Of it
as having been exceedingly amusing.
The old man having nothing but tuft
of the mares name to cling to, was
holding on to that with all his might
and yelling at the top Of his lungs for
help, while at the same time the drill
that was following in the rear was cut
ting some strange antics. After the
mare had described one Or two circles
around the field the old man tumbled
off, and the drill passed over his body,
fortunately doing him no damage. Mr..
Lynch has discovered by this feat that
it is not well to change brides without
first securing the animal in some other
way.-LoCal News,"

cover and arrest the murderers, and
these efforts will probably prove sue
cessful, as will be seen by the follow
ing from the Dodge City, Kansas,
Times, of April 3D.


''Sheriff II. Fleming, of Sweetwater,
Texas, arrived in this city, Tuesday
morning, having under arrest three
soldiers belonging to the 10Th Infant
ry. The men were arrested at Fort
Garland. They were indicted by the
Grand Jury of Wheeler county, for the
murder of A. G. Springer, in Novem-
ber, 1878. at Springer's rancho, in Tex
as. Many of our readers are familiar
with the circumstance of the killing.
The mea belonged to party of thir-
| teen soldiers, which formed the pay
masters escort. They were engaged
in playing cards with Springer, when
an alteration ensued, in which
Springer and young man named
Leadbetter were killed and three sol
diers were wounded. The names of
the soldiers under arrest are Private
Patrick Kerrigan, who was then in
charge of the paymaster's escort, Ser
geant Theodore Lowe, and Private
Frank Gibson.


""Sheriff Fleming secured requisi-
tion from the Governor of Colorado
for the arrest Of the prisoners. The
soldiers were taken under military es-
cort to Sweetwater, as they feared
they would be lynched; but these fears
are groundless. The Sheriff arrested
these men unde- reward offered by
the Governor of Texas, founded on
the indictment by the Grand Jury."

Russian Students Charged with


the Grimes In st. Petersburg.
| LONDON, Feb. 28.-A Paris despatch
to the Times says 1.-THE inhabitants
of st. Petersburg are beginning to at
tribute to the students all the tecent
menaces and crimes there. Threats
are consequently heard on all sides
against the students, and the inhabi
tants affirm that if any criminal act
occurs on the anniversary of the EN-
peror's accession to the throne, they
will hold the students responsible, and
will burn down the University and
lynch every student who falls into
their hands. The Government,
therefore, is now forced to take meas
ures for protectingt he students.

Opposed to co-Educatlon.",THE BOARD PosTPoNEs THE ouEsrro,"Inc 6Oaru Oh EuucatfOn met in reg
ular session last evening, President
Eckel in the chair. @
The question of co-education Of the
sexes came up In almost the first item
of business, on the report offered sew
eral weeks ago, by the committee
on transfers, recommending that a
room In No. be set apart as a gram
mar department for boys and girls, in
order to relieve the pressure for seats
at other grammar schools. ~ ~


Mr.. Baird said he thought this
would be good thing to do It would
be better for the children and over
come the difficulty of accommo dating
the grammar school scholars with
seats. YItl-r.l4 yl


Col. HeisleT inquired whether, if
this report was adopted, it was to be
merely q temporary expedient, or the
introduction of an established custom.


Mr.. Kent replied that it was design
ed to make the arrangement, to 90 in
to effect the first of the next school
year.


DR.. Grimshaw next took the floor,
and opposed co-education from a
physiological, mental and moral stand
point. He quoted from ""Clark on Co
Education"" strong work against CO.
education by DR.. Edward ii. Clark, of
Boston, leading physician and
scientist. He also alluded to the fact
that Mr.. Gladstone, England's dis
tinguished statesman, after having
given his daughter term at Cam
bridge, was opposed to co-education.
The doctor then moved to lay the sub
ject over until the first meeting in
July next.


MIR. Grubb said he favored co-educa-
ton, and in response to DR.. Grim
shaw's quotations from Clark, he
quoted from Prof VIM. P. Harris,
superintendent of the St. Louis public
schools, who strongly favored CO.
education in a pamphlet issued in
1872. Mr.. Grubb also read letter he
had received from Prof Harris, in
which he said he still believed fully in
the merits of co-education.


Mr.. Kent followed Mr.. Grubb and
attempted to floor DIR. Grimshaw and
his quotations from DR.. Clark, with a
work entitled ''Sex and Education""
reply to DIR. Clark, by Col. Thomas
Wentworth Higginson. Cont .nuing,
Mr.. Kent unrolled formidable look
ing bundle of letters, and proceeded to
read arguments Of every conceivable
shade In favor of co-education, from
the following distinguished peda-
gogues: ...


President Fairchild, of Oberlin Col
lege, Ohio. .---r


Prof. ]. II. Wickersham, State
Superintendent of Public Schools in
Pennsylvania.


The Superintendent of Public In
struction, Cleveland, Ohio.


The Superintendent of Public In
struction, Dayton, Ohio.


| J. W. Dickinson, Superintendent of
| Public Schools of Massachusetts.
President Andrews and Prof. Bas-
com, of the Michigan University.
| President Pickard, of the Ohio State
University.


DIR. Grimshaw, Notwithstanding this
fierce onslaught =, of distinguished
authorities, arose smilingly, and sar-
castically twitted the friends of CO.
education for drawing the fire of the
opposition before they let off their
own ammunition. However, he said
he would be happy to answer all these
authorities-if he had time. He said
Col. Higginson was Colonel of a negro
regiment, and doubtless a brave SOL
dier, but DIR. Clark was distinguish
ed scientist, educated with q special
regard to the subject of which he
speaks. Whose opinion, therefore, on
this subject, would the Board prefer
to takep


Mr.. Kenney said he was opposed to
co-education, from practical stand
point. At No. 4 school the girls were all
right, but the boys weie greatly COM
piained OF. BE was 10th to endanger
the reputation of girls by mixing them
promiscuously with boys. He thought
1t was wrong 10 save boy At the expense
Of girl. The schools were we'll enough
now, and 1t was poor doctrine TO mix
good girls and bad boys for the sake Of
economy of room.


Col. Heisler took an exactly opposite
view from that expressed by Mr.. Kenney.
He was opposed to co-education out of
regard for the morals OF the boys. He
was prepared to substantiate all he said,
and If gentlemen of the Board would
accompany HIM he would show them
something In the grammar schools that
would fill them with surprise. And this
""something"" was on the part of the girls
He had seen girls and boys from Mol
schools acling on the streets in manner
that made him feel ashamed. He had
known of notes passing between the girls
and boys at No, l, making appointments
for night meetings. He had some of
these notes In his possession, written by
the girls OF No. l. About two years ago
these was talk Of expelling girl from
No. for bad conduct. The boys had
been more gentlemanly than the girls
are ladylike, where they are together;
""and,"" said Col. Heisler, In conclusion,
""what Is economy of room, to the virtue
and proper care OF tue pupilsP' %

Grimshaw's motion to lay the subject
over until the first meeting in July
was adopted by the following vote

 The Democrats were on the qui vive last evening. There were thirteen lively ward meetings. and political business was boom ing. They were the primary meetings of the party, and big with importance, as bearing on the local nominations for Representative, Senator and Judge of Probate, and on the complexion of the delegations to the Con eressional and State conventions. The fight was principally over delegates for the Con- gressional, Senatorial and Representative con- yentions, there being contesting candidates on all of these tickets For Congressional honors both Judge Levi B. Bradley and Judge Phelps are in the field, and both showed considerable strength It is difficult to decide which has gained majority of delegates although from the best informa- ton that can be gained it appears that Phelps has the inside track. Bradley men are, how ever, confident So far as sheriff is con- cerned it would appear that Byxbee has large majority of the delegates, and, in fact, that the delegation is almost unanimous in favor of his renomination; in short, that he has got ''walk over"" Plunkett appears to lead as the Senatorial candidate, but William J. Mills loomed up strong, and Driscon as the candidate for Representative, yet all these calculations may be upset when the conven- tions meet, as ""the white man is very uncer- tain"" Many of the delegates elected are ''non- n-committal, , which means 'the longest pole gets the chesnuts.' s.'

 FIRST WARD.

 In the First ward there was no struggle"" 7"" The primary was held at 313 Chapel street. the ticket in favor of Mills and Driscoll having complete ''walk over."" One hun dred and thirty-four votes, with but few scratches, were cast for the one ticket in nomination, the few ''scratches'' there were not affecting the general result. The ticket elected was as follows:

 state-C B. Bowers H. P Frost Edward J. Ender. Congressional-D. L. Carpenter, William J. Mills, Truman s. Foote.

 County-George E. Kimberly, J k ReInDert, E Zacher.

 Judge of Probate-E Gilbert. George Hitler. Jacob senate-D L. Carpenter. J. 1ngersou, J. R. Buick epresentatives-George E. Kimberly, Lewis Asher, W. H. Law, jr.

 Primary Gommitteeman-G George E. Kimberly.

 SECOND WARD.

 In this ward ballots of different colors were used. For two hours and over the Demo cratic wigwam, the scene of the contest, cor ner of Oak and Asylum streets was sur rounded by crowd of hungry strikers, who hesitated until approached by one of the gang who fixed things to their satisfaction. The polls closed at half-past nine, with the fol lowing result for the successful ticket, which, up to the present time, means Phelps for Congress, Plunkett for Senator and Fox for Representative

 Congressional-John Reynolds, Edward M. Graves, Joseph D. Plunkett.

 The above ticket received 94 votes, while the opposition boiled only ""A.

 Would be Senator Plunkett was around carefully eyeing proceedings to see that his own ward would not leave a cold day for him. The defeated candidate of 8 year ago looked happy and sanguine, and apparently did not consider it necessary to wear patent leather boots to secure his election. While feeling was strong, the demonstration was quiet

 THIRD WARD.

 In this ward two hundred and sixty-fve votes were boiled, and the fight was Q bitter one, which dated back to the caucus, when half dozen fists were shaken in the face of a member of the Hancock Legion who stood up and announced his preference for Judge Phelps. The contest in fact waxed so warm that Larry Eagan, the chairman, stood up and threatened to floor any man that dare lay finger on the man who was so outspoken for Phelps. The Phelps, Plunkett and Fox ticket received 10S majority The delegates elected are:

 state-Thomns F. Gaynor, George R. Cooley, Alex ander Troup, Lawrence Eagan.

 FOURTH WARD.

 In this ward the general interest some what Jagged. When the polls closed it was generally conceded that the Bradley and Mills delegates had been elected.

 FIFTH WARD. The Fifth ward Democrats held their pri- mary at John Tuttle's store, corner of Woos- ter and Chestnut streets. The contest in this ward was an exciting one, especially so be- tween the Driscoll and Fox factions. The Driscoll ticket, so called, was successful by one majority on the State, Congressional, Sena- .torial and Probate tickets, while the Represen- tative ticket was elected by 14 majority and County ticket by IT majority. Following is the ticket:

 state-Curtis F. Evarts, Simon B. shoninger, C. T. Driscoll.

Its more adroit and influential meni- bers were favorable to Tilden. though perhaps d""uhting the advsability of his nomination. Barnum and Burr controlled the selection of delegates, while Waller controlled the Con- vention. Though himself opposed to Tilden, the latter did all he could to keep the anti Tilden people from passing directly hostile resolutions, and finally moved the indefinite postponement of the platform proposed by the regular committee, put the motion him self, and then declared it carried and the convention adjourned, all. as it were, in the twinkling of an eye The following is the list of delegates chosen. most of them, as the Tribune reporter neatly puts it, Gin favor of Tilden but against his nomination :'

 AT LARGE.

 First District-A E. Burr, Hartford

 Second Dstrict-William Parsons, New Haven.

 Third District-David A Wells Norwich

 Fourth District William H. Barnum, Sails bury.

 COUNTY DELEeATEs.

 Hartford Jeffrey O. Phelps, Simsbury

 Holland -Jabcz l.. White, Bolton.

 New Haven-Samuel Simpson, Walling- ford.

 Middlesex-Curtis Bacon, Middletown.

 New London-Ralph Wheeler, New Lon don.

 Fairfeld-Jonathan E. Wheeler, Vest port.

 Litchfleld-Henry B. Graves, Litchfeld.

 The notable feature of the Democratic Con vention was the same that characterized the recent Republican Convention dissatisfaction with the machine. In fact the opposition to Tilden in the former was even more pro- nounced than the opposition to Grant and Blaine in the latter. It required all Tom Walters phenomenal assurance to stop the debate on the demerits of Mr. Samuai J. Tiden, into which the convention had drifted when the tour de force of It's chairman cut its proceedings short.

 The most important fact of all, however, was the power shown by Mir. Barnum to mould the party he leads, entirely to his will. While the convention can hardly be considered TIlden triumph, 1t was clear victory for Barnum. He again heads the Connecticut delegation; and, though he may not be able tD give their vote entire to Tildcn he will cer- tainly deliver it to the candidate Tilden des- ignates should be determine not to run again himself.

 It is this unworthy subjugation of Connec- ticut Democracy by Wm. H. Barnum which renders it utterly unserviceable as means of reform. No man in his senses will forsake the Republican party in Connecticut, and join the Democratic party. in the belief that he is advancing the cause of political purity. He runs away from one machine to place himself in the power of vastly more powerful, vastly more dangerous machine. Connecticut De- mocracy, therefore, can expect no direct help from those who want reform and restoration of the people to real power, in place of the tuteage in which they are flow held by peliti- clans. Of course the Republican who bolts bad nomination knows perfectly we'll that he is indirectly helping Democratic candidate who may be just as bad man as the candi- date he bolts. Must he therefore bow to the dictation of one party machine because he sees that the opposition machine is still worse?

 It is this assumed necessity of choosing be- tween two evils that will keep good men in both parties voting all their lives for bad candi- dates, unless they finally get their eyes open to the fact that the only way to put stop to tho ian of bod oopd;dotoo ;, holx them as often as the party machines set them up. The moral question all lies in nut shells It IS 70 excuse .tor Uoting for c bad ,asam that others are voting tor soorse one.

 A stupid brute got into a row with stupid crowd at Patterson, N. J., on Sunday. It seems that the German societies there have practice of celebrating the first of May. They have been in the habit of crossing over piece of land occupied by one William Dalzell, butcher. He objected strongly to the practice, and was on hand Sunday, with his son and shot gun to prevent the trespass A young man by the name of Van Houten got into scuffle with the younger Dalzell, when the father came to the rescue and shot Van Houten dead. At the time of the murder, it is said, neither Dalzell nor Van Houten were on the formers land. The crowd then chased DalZell into his house, and seemed determined to lynch him. He fired on them. once more and shot little boy and little glrl, not seriously, however. The mob had now be. come riot of the most violent description, refused to disperse on command of the au- thorities, set Dalzell's house on fire, and chased him from place to place. At last the officers succeeded in running hlm through the crowd and taking him with swift team to Newark jail. The military have been called out, and the man is probably no longer in danger of immediate mob violence

 At an early hour on Saturday last. Harry Crane, of Bethlehem, committed suicide by shooting himself through the heart with a pistol. The Waterbury American gives the following account of the affair."":

 About o'clock he arose from his bed and while in the act of dressing was noticed by his wife to slip small pistol into his pocket. She immediately attempted to wrest it from his grasp, holding on to him till strength was exhausted, when he threw himself on his bed, drew the weapon and, in the presence of his wife and daughter, shot himself, the fatal bull let passing through his body being found in the bed. It entered just over the heart He died in a short time The deceased had for some time been depressed in spirits and melancholy, owing in measure to ill health He leaves wife, one son and two daughters. The deceased was 58 years of age.

 WAccA, Aug. 27.-Lynchfield Burks was hanged here at ? o'clock this afternoon, for assaulting little girl nine years old, named confession, and up to the last denied his guilt. He seemed resigned to his fate. Strenuous efforts were made to save the con- demned man, and many of his friends until this morning entertained hopes of receiving a communication of his sentence or at least a respite Governor Roberts, however, de- clined to interfere, and Burks suffered the penalty of the law.

When the prison authorities visited him at o'clock this morning they found the con demned man in the last agonies of death. Near him was 8 large pool of blood, and blood was issuing from wound in his left wrist, which he had made with penknife. On examination it as..found that the arteries had been severed. How Rucker got posses sion of the penknife is a mystery to all. The crime which he was to have expiated to- day on the gallows was the murder of man named R. P. Grayson and his wife. He was sentenced June 16th. During his trial he manifested most stolid indifference. When asked at the time if he had anything to say, he replied that he had nothing to say except he wanted the court to grant him as much time as possible, as he (the prisoner) had out several petitions for communication of his sen tence.

 Hamlin was hung yesterday at Hartford iail at 11:40 o'clock. He met death with for titude and resignation. During his last night he was guarded from intrusion by his watch men, who had with them also mastiff. He did not essay to sleep until long after mid night, and spent his waking hours in writing, meditation and conversation. His spiritual attendant, the Very Rev. Father Hughes, was with him for two hours in the early part of the evening, leaving him at p. m. He talked frequently during the night to Deputies Fenn and Won Wettberg, who were of the 'sdeath watch"" He seemed cool and collect ed. At about quarter to one he sought his pallet and lay down, first enjoining his keep CTS to wake him by o'clock He was soon in deep slumber. During the evening people hung about in the vicinity of the jail talking about the impending gallows scene and eager to hear anything which they might chance to learn about the prisoner or the arrangements for the hanging. At a. m. Deputy Fenn went in to awaken the condemned man. but he had just got his eyes open himself. ''Woke up in time, didn't I ?"" he said, adding good morning to those about him. He set to work to perform his toilet, over which he spent considerable time. He, to all appearances, was as calm as ever, and displayed no nerv- ousness while. in the performance of his customary morning duties. He took no breakfast but busted himself with morning devotions, after which he wrote little and then made 8 disposition of the effects which have ornamented his cell. Friends sent to him a number of floral offer- ings Thursday night, and these he smelled of Thursday morning and remarked on their fra grance. At o'clock the Rev. Father Hughes and two assistants came to the prison chapel, whither Hamlin was conducted by the prison officials. Then the sacrament of the Lords Supper administered to him for the last time, and after this low mass for the dying was said, there being music by a vocal sextette at his request, and entirely con- trary to the usual custom. The service was very impressive and the priests who were in l attendance were very much affected, more so 1 than was the condemned man, who main tained his usual composure, and after the proceedings, which lasted half an hour, he | showed great nerve and fortitude Beside the clergy, there were at the service Sheriff Seymour and several of his deputies, Assist ant Editor Belden and City Editor Burr of the Hartford Times and Reporter Fenn of the Hartford Post. After his return to his cell he became more nervous, and for the first time since the death sentence was pro- nounced upon him showed signs of excita- bility and nervousness. He showed increased signs of nervousness the time for the exc cution drew near. He now asked for his breakfast. He ate sparingly, and what re- mained untouched he sent to fellow prison CT to whom he had become much attached, one Frederick Killenberger, awaiting trial on a charge of forgery.

 As early as 10 o'clock the neighboring housetops in the vicinity of the jail whence the scaffo1d could be seen began to grow black with people waiting to see the prisoner swing of. By this time the police force, 15 men, had arrived, also dozen deputies de- tailed by Sheriff Seymour. Six of the po- licemen were assigned to duty inside the jail enclosure, the rest outside Among Hamlin's last visitors were his lawyers, T. E. Steele and Roger Welles, with whom he shook hands and exchanged good byes.

 In reply to MT. Welles as to his feelings, he said he thought he was going to Heaven. The lawyer said 'sWell, you've got the con- solation that you are not to be hung for your l own act, wholly"" to which Hamlin solemnly 1 replied q can say here, and at this last moment, that to the best of my knowledge and belief did not kill him (Shipman). That's Gods truth. I can't say Allen did it, but I'm satisfied did not do it knowingly If did kill him know nothing about it.' At this time 15O persons provided with passes to the death scene were in waiting at the sherif's ofice which could hold but few more. All was quiet, without pushing or con- fusion. At 11:1O the reporters, physicians, officers and spectators in general who formed l the throng in waiting were admitted to the jail enclosure Among them was Quong Xxi l Gnu, member of the Chinese Educational Commission, who was attired in white, cool | flowing robes. He stood with uncovered head. His back hair was worn in a queue It was more serious orderly throng than l that present at the Hoyt hanging. Father Hughes was at this time with Hamlin perform ! ing his churchly offices. The sheriff read the 1 death warrant, Hamlin being inside the bars. | Hamlin remarked, 1.-The word hang oc- | cured often in that"" His arms were now | pinioned, and at 11:29 there was a cry from | the police, Hats off '"" Hamlin was in close | conversation with his spiritual attendant a | few moments more, at the close of which he exclaimed to the sheriff, 'tAn right; go on i; | I am ready"" The solemn procession, con- | sisting of the High Sheriff, Hamlin, Father | Hughes, Father Lynch, and Deputies Pack ! ard and Fenn, now moved to the scaffold Hamlns step firm and he did not waver 1 The party being assembled on the scaffold | the sheriff asked Hamlin if he had any last I words to offer. Hamlin, with a firm, steady ! voice, said:

 q want to return my thanks to all of those l who have befriended me since I have been

 confined in jail. The fact is we had no in

 tention of killing MT. Shipman or of doing ! him any bodily harm on the night he was

 killed. haven't at this moment the least bit

 of ill will against any one who had anything

 to do with this case or with bringing me here

 where I stand to-day. I forgive them all,

 freely and fully, and hope God will forgive

 me as freely as I forgive them""

 ! As he uttered the last few words he raised

 his eyes toward heaven; and there was on his

 features beseeching and imploring look,

 combined with one of intense mental agony,

 which it is utterly impossible to describe, and which none but those who saw it can

 imagine It was to all appearances the one | trying ordeal through which he had to pass. | After he finished his remarks he turned to

 Sheriff Seymour and in an undertone said,

 ''That is all""

 Father Hughes then advanced to the con

 demned man and exchanged very few words

 with him in whispers. Hamlin kissed the

 cruciix of black and gold which the priest carried in his hands. Then Father Hughes

 kissed Hamlin on both cheeks, shook hands,

 said Good bye, poor fellow"" and the two priests left the scaffold

 Deputy Sheriff Fenn then pinioned Ham,

 lin's arms from the back, while Deputy Sher-

 if Packard strapped his legs above and below

 the knees. In doing so he accidentally drew | Hamlin slightly around, which caused the condemned man to turn and look down upon him ho dSofo hon"

Plunkett %. Dillon in 1859. In that
case Mr.. Dillon had seven majority
but after q careful examination COun-
Gil found the frauds committed to have
been so gross that they declared the
seat vacant, and it was not filled DUR
ing the year. The writer claimed that
the present Council should have acted
in the same manner in regard to Mr..
Allen, as they had no law to elect him.
In support of his labored ideas, the
writer cited an old law on the subject
of contests and elections before Coun-
Gil.


At the conclusion of the reading of
the article, Mr.. Taylor said that a
great deal had been said in the editor
ial about the Council having no war
rant or law to elect member as Mr..
Allen was elected. He did not sup
pose that the gentleman who wrote the
editorial just read intended to say that
Council violated their obligations in
electing Mr.. Allen, but he should have
hesitated before he wrote it. The case
of Dillon Us. Plunkctt referred to was
entirely different from Mr.. Aliens
In the former case there was major
ity, while in the case of Mr.. Allen it
was tie.


The law at that time was entirely
different from the law at the present
time. For the benefit of the gentle
man who wrote the editorial he would
read sec. 4, chap. 446, vol. 10, Della
ware laws, passed at Dover March 9th,
1877. If the editor had read that por-
tion of the law he would see that
Council had power to elect their own
members. He would advise the editor
of the Republican, whoever he may be,
not to be too hasty in forming an
opinion. AS he is not legal editor,
he should have consulted lawyer be-
fore he wrote theeditorial.


In conclusion he would say that Mr..
Allen holds his seat in Council as
legally as any of the other members.


The chair stated that he supposed
the mistake occurred because the last
edition of the ordinance was published
in 1879, and the editor of the RepubIi-
can did not know that there had been
changes made since that time.


On motion adjourned.

To the Editor of The National Republican:


SIR: There is very general dissati sfaction
in the State with the outrage of tho State com.
mttee in having the State convention at about
the most inaccessible aud remote portion OF
the State that they could select, at Staunton
which is well.nigh into West Virginia and be.
yond the mountains, and tho purpose of the
manipulators is evident At the meeting of
the committee it was alleged by the mover OF
the resolution (member from Lexington, an
ollice-holder and Sherman mani, that the Re-
publicans from Eastern and Tidewater were
enthusiastic for Grant, aud that tho convention
ought not on that account be held in Rich
mond, Petersburg Lynchburg or Norfolk.


What we desire to invite attention to is the
terms of the call for the National convention
at Chicago. 1t reads as follows:


Republicans and all who will corporate
with them in supporting the nominee Of the
party are invited to choose two delegates
from each Congressional district and four at
large from each State"" There is no mention
of State conventions and no authority con.
ferred upon them; only the Congressional dis
trcts are mentioned. 1t necessarily follows
that If delegates are elected through the ma
chinery of Congressional district conventions
they must be admitted to the Chicago conven-
ton. We regard tho suggestion to tho Re-
publicans of Eastern Virginia to avail them
selves ofthis mode of action as worthy of con-
sideratiou. Four-flths ofthe Republican vote
in the State is east and south of Richmond,
hence the expense and sacrifices involved to
get to Staunton are such that not one-third OF
the counties are likely to be represented by
bona fde delegates, and 1t will bo marvel II
u correct representation of The choice and sen.
timcnt of the Republicans of the State is OBJ
tanned at that convention. REPUBLICAN,"

Roanoke river (then called Staunton
river), during the old Revolutionary war
when there were some Tories of cbnox.
iOus character still remaining in the
county not reachable by any statutory
law, Col. Charles Lynch, supported by
Capt. Robert Adams, his brother-in-law
both farming on adjoining plantations,
and-.-Calloway, determining to rid the
country of such dangerous enemies,
seized, on different occasions, three of
the worst of them, tied them to q tree
and logged them SO severely as to
prompt an unceremonious departure
from the State, as they were ordered.
This sort of procedure on the part of
Lynch and his friends proving so effect
i've in Campbell was quickly followed in
other counties, where loyalty to King
George sometimes provoked summary
punishment, and it was called ""Lynch
law"" and has been to our day.


The snatch of an old song of the time
is still repeated in the neighborhood:

were tied and whipped. Life was never
taken.


Webster, in his unabridged dictionary,
says of ""Lynch law"" that it was the
practice of furnishing men for crimes
or offenses by private, unauthorized
persons, without a legal trial. The term
is said to be derived from Virginia
farmer named Lynch, who thus took the
law into his own hands,"""

CHICAGO, ILL.,, June Sat the ad-
iourned session the delegates as we'll
as the galleries were becoming very
impatient. 1t required a man of
acknowledge leadership to command
their respectful attention. The roll
of States reached New York with
one or two nominations made. The
clerk paused significantly at this
State, but no more was made and
North Carolina was called. Then
General Woodford of New York
arose, and having obtained unani-
nous consent, nominated General
Chester A. Arthur for vice presi-
dent. Having failed to nominate
the General of their choice he said
that his State heartily concurred in
t he nomination of the distinguished
General from Ohio, and offered as
his second on the ticket her own dis
tinglished son, who would insure a
majority in the Empire State. Gov
ernOr DenDlSOn Ol Olllo WAS tne
first to second the nomination in
behalf of the delegation from his
State. General Fitzpatrick followed
in behalf of the New Jersey deleGa-
ton, and when Emory A. Stoors
pledged Illinois to Arthur, it was
evident that the work at recess had
been cleanly done, and that Arthur
would certainly be nominated
Lynch, Mississippi negro, said
that it had been their intention to
present the name of B. X. Bruce,
but they would not do so, but would
heartily second the nomination OF
the distinguished soldier from New
York.


The spectators arose and shouted
Justify and long, wearyir G the patience
of the delegates so sorely that Senator
Dorsey's motion to clear the galleries

between the Albany aud National clubs.


Derby pitched for the homo team and Baker
caught, Lynch being laid Off, suffering from

proved so efficient in the position that the
visitors could do nothing with him, and
secured only eight hits in the game. On the
other hand the Nationals had no trouble in
hitting Nichols, aud in the fifth innings
drove him from his position, Say being sub.

pretty well dcmoralized the visiting team, aud

A Tale Of Valparaiso.",,"| Tale Of Valparaiso.


BT WILLIAM coxsTocK.


The American frigate Brandywine,
Commodore Jones, and the British fripate
Thetis, Captain Bingham, lav in the har
Dor of Valparaiso. Every Sunday a nor
ton of the crews of these two frigates
went on shore; the dancing halls we're
filed and the fiddle squeaked.


Although merriment was carried to the
greatest height. and much aguardente, ""a
very bad whiskey) was arank, yet it was
very seldom that any row and qaarrell.
ing took place. It seemed to be tacitlv
understood that when the sailors met on
shore on sunday, for the purpose of rec
reation and amusement, nothing but
good fellowship should prevail, and as the
sailors spent their money freely among
the natives, the latter always seemed dis
posed to greet the former in friendly
manner.


There were two conical hills to which
the sailors had given the names of Mair.
top and Foro-top. On the summit of
these hills, on the very apex, were the
principal places of resort tor seamen,
where they drank, danced or took tempo
rary board.


The Iheuse on Main-top was quite
large establishment, and was kept bv
""Black Sam,' colored man, who had
been servant to DR.. Valentine Mott, of
New York, and who could tell many an.
ecdotes Of that celebrated physician.


Lower down were two public houses,
and Martin Wolff kept saloon near the
bottom of Fore-top.


These houses were visited only by for
elgners, save that occasionally q Young
Spanish girl dropped in to take drink
and converse with such seamen as chanc-
ed to be present.


Such was the state Of things in Valpa~
rlaso, or that part of the town most tre-
quented by seamen, when a new saloon
was opened about hundred yards below
the establishment of Black Sam.


The man who opened this new saloon
or clearinghouse, was a little fellow
about twenty-five years of age, dressed
IN navy blue, and making no pretensions
either to education or social standing.
Indeed, his pretenslons were so modest,
and he had SO little to say about his an
tecedents, that a story was soon circulat.
cd about his being an escaped convict
from Botany Bay. As he never took any
pains to suppress that report, it was soon
regarded as fact, and he went by the
name Of ""Botanv Bay SAM


At first this new Ian ]lorG drew little
custom, but the disco> ~ was soon made
that he kept good liquor, and that his ia.
BILE was much better supplied than those
Of other landlords. Two noted dwellers
on Main-top left their boarding houses
and took up their abode with Botany
Bay Sam. One Of them, known by the
sobriquet of ""Bolivar,"" who had lost
leg when engaged under Cockrane in cut
ting out Spanish frigate from the har-
Dor of Callao, and the other an English
man, who had also been wounded in the
Patriot service, were in receipt Of regu-
lar pension from the government. If they
lett the country they would lose their
pension; therefore they remained in VAL
paraiso.


But, if Botany Bay Sam was in -four
ishing condition, such was not the case
with one class who, it was observed, had
come to grief pretty generally. This
class was the runaways or deserters
from the various vessels in the harbor,
and particularly those who deserted from
the British trigatc. Attention was drawn
to this subject by the cries which reach
ed the ears Of the seamcn who lived near
the beach, which cries proceeded from
tho captured deserters who were recciv-
ing their punishment with the cat o. nine
tails at the gangway of the Thet,s.


The subject was much talked OF by
sailors congregated in the saloon Of Bot
any Bay Sam, especially as the latter
was known to be great patron and pro.
tcctor Of deserters. 1t soon came to be
noticed, however, that Bolivar, who
boarded with Sam, took little part IN
these conversations, and it was even hint.
ed that he looked as if he knew more
about the matter than he chose to tell.
But Sam himself, was loud in condem.
nation of the captain and officers of the
British trlgate, and often asserted that
whoever betrayed dcserters for ""blood
money"" ought to be hung by the heels
and skinned alive.


Strangely, therefore, it sounded when
it began to he whispered about that one
John Edwards, who had left the Thetis,
and had taken shelter under the wing of
Botany Bay Sam, had been captured on
| the same night, and been taken on board
the frigate in irons.


The question was asked, how could
the officers of the Thetis have so soon dis
covered the whereabouts Of the runawav2
Bolivar was called upon and requested to
tell all he knew of the circumstances at
tending the desertion Ind capture of Ed
wards. He was not at all communica-
tive; he seemed very unwilling to talk
about the affair. This was deemed bad
omen. Suspicion darkened, and very
savage glances were cast at Botany Bay
Sam. But perhaps no conclusion could
have been arrived at, if Martin Wolff had
not advised the seamen to ply Bolivar
with liquor. That was done, and the
gallant seaman, when drunk, confessed
that Sam had sold Edwards to the cap.
tain of the frigate.


The confession of Bolivar meant
great deal more than was at first supposed;
and little reflection convinced the en-
ragged seamen that Sam, having been en-
trusted with knowledge Of all the
hiding places where deserters secIeted
themselves, had betrayed not only Ed.
wards, but all the other runaways who
had been captured.


Angry growls and threats surrounded
the house of Botany Bay Sam. He pro
tested his innocence, but little attention
was paid to what he said, and finally, on
one dark night, crowd beset his estab~
lishment for the purpose of dragging
him out and subjecling him to
the terrible asperitles of lynch
law. But just as one stout fellow
had beaten in the door, and during the
brief lull IN the tumult which succeeded
their first act of violence, the meb heard
the regular, short, jerky stroke of the
man. .of-war oars, giving notice that
boat from the frigate was rapidly ap-
preaching the shore. Nothing could be
seen in the darkness, but the noise made
by the oars in the ar-locks denoted that
somebody was coming who meant bnsi"

 NEW YORK, Jan. 9.-oIt became known to 8 few persons yesterday, and to-day was made public, that Benjamin 0. Bogert, treasurer of the Produce Exchange since it's organization, with the exception of one year, was default CT to the Exchange in large amount. The disclosure of the dedication was due to the determination of the finance committee of the Produce Exchange to transfer the amount of the Exchange from one bank to another. Mr. Bogert is supposed to have used the money which he took in his private business. Mir. Bogert did not appear at the Exchange or at his office after the discovery was made, and died suddenly yesterday afternoon at the house of a friend in this city. It is thought that, unable to bear his disgrace, he may have committed suicide, though his relatives call it apoplexy. The Board of Managers of the Produce Exchange remained in session to-day for several hours. The superintend- ent, after the meeting, said they felt satisfied that MT. Bogert's defalcations would not be over $35, 900, and against these they held sureties for $20, 900.

 A post-mortem examination made this evening upon the remains of Benjamin O. Bogert, defaulting treasurer of the Produce Exchange, showed that death was due to poi son.

Dr. Ben nett was summoned and sought to find the cause of the singular attack The preliminary investigation by the doctor and the police. with whom he at once communicated, showed that the tongue and the sauerkraut were the only things which the family had eaten that day.

All four members of the family were reported this morning as improving."

The origin of the great houses is los
in obscurity, and the end of them eaual
"", but 1t is always interesting when on,
can trace them either TO their origin o
in their decline. a case which has ius
been tried in the law courts in Franc,

cline as rotting out. II ends in Tho

of the royal nuke, but we must tax,
what we ind. The other dav Uric Eu.
gene Fuelle de Collin de Bar, Vicomte
de Clyry, appeared before a French Jury
on charge of robbery and general
swindling. He had been arrested in
England on an extradition warrant, and
before he went TO England he had qui-
etly relieved the landlady of the fur.
nished apartment which he occupied in
Paris of considerable quantity of her
property. He had hired the apartment
for considerable sum in the fashionable
quarter, and he no sooner obtained pos
session OF it than he broke open the
drawers containing the private effects of
the proprletress anC made off with them.
His coniederates in this transaction were
his own valet and stewart and other
""otiicers of his household"" The poor
landladv had no suspicion of her lodper.
Tor he bore a noble French name and
was OF princcly origin. IIismother was
the daughter of the Duke of Brunswick.
HIS father was French gentleman of
extremely good descent. The poor lad
was born into every Species OF elegant
corruption, If that adjective can ever be
applied TO that noun. His grandfather
lived the life that every one in Paris
knows, went about painted up to the
eyebrows, and wearing a curled perr,iq,,e
whlle ms morals were even more arlif-
cially nasty than his manner of dressing.
lie installed several temporary favorites
IN his household at short intervals of
succession, and the mother of Uric de
Clvry was one of them. She was
brought up in kind of splendid Bohe-
mia. Her father took little notice of
her, being entirely cngrossed with his
notice of himself, and he made very
slender provision for her education and
training. She therefore had but little
OF this description t. transmit to her
son. In worldly goods she was almost
as badly off, for the old Duke kept a
tight hold on his purse strings. She OBJ
tained very little money from him.
though he rolled in millions; vet at the
same time, though living in his house,
she was always within sight of the great
est luxures that money could purchase.
Her lips, as 1t were, touched n river of
liquid gold, but she was still athirst.
She formed most costly and extravagant
tastes, and had nothing to crafty them
with. Her son was in this respect true
child OF his mother, and in others the
trne grandson Of the lllustrious Duke, so
that he was thoroughly well equipped
with bad qualities on both sides, and not
a single vice was wanting ior his compo-
sition. lie could not work, to beg he
was ashamed but he was not ashamed
to steal. and he lived pretty comfortably
for time in Paris on his wits and his
name. His grandfather was known to
be so rich that nobody hesitated to trust
the young fellow, and even when the
grandfather died and left all his money
away from the family to the City of Ge-
neva, there was still hope of recover
ing it by a lawsuit. In the meantime
Uric de Civry went on cheating IN the
hope that something would turn up in
the shape of a favorable decision in his
mothers suit for the recovery of the
property. He might probably after that
have turned an honest man. That was
no doubt his intention, but unfortunate
"" before he turned honest he had to get
hls grandlather's money, and before he
could get his grandfather's money, he
ran short of ready cash, and was obliged
to clear out the Clothes-presses of his
landlady, as before stated. There was
hue and a cry after him, and he an
away TO England. In England he was
not idle. lie was a handsome fellow, as
may be inferred from this description OF
him as he stood in the dock the other day;


""Twenty-seven years old, elegantly
dressed, dark blue eyes, bright red lips,
white teeth, clegantIy.curled mustache'
in fact, a perfect dcad-shot in the war
fare of drawing-room and ball. With
these advantages he could work as well
in England as in Paris, and he found
means to commend himself TO the favor
of a lady of the British aristocracy, and
was living very comfortably on the
pocket money which she gave him
when the police quietly took him by
the collar. Some sort of defense had to
be made for him as he stood in the
French dock, but il was little to the pur-
pose. The whole case was proven to
the hilt. lie had become the accom-
pice of his very servants in the
most scandalous kind of robberies, and
rObberies were the least disgraceful
things in his career. He denied them
to the last, though he incidentally adj
mittcd other weaknesses which would
have been quite sufficient to hang him
in a country where lynching-law pre-
vailed. The judges sent him to prison
for three years-and thus ends the story
of a noble life."

ASSIST HIM.


The Morning News gives the de-
tails of terrible case of infan ticide
that recently occurred at Bay View,
Cecil county, Md.


The story Is that the wife Of
Nathan Tyson, Of Bay View, was
known to be about to give birth to a
child, and that Mrs. Tyson was seen
going about the house as usual, until
Thursday or Friday last. On Mon
day afternoon Tyson was seen dig
ging hole in his garden, which he
said was for the purpose of planting
grape vine. Suspicion being
aroused, warrant was issued on
complaint Of Mrs. Mary E. Riddle,
aneighbor which was served by Con-
stable Isaac DeFord, who was ac-
companied by Esquire Benjamin,
Mrs. Riddle, Thos. Riddle, Henry
Burns ard John Loaan. They went
to Tyson's house, and Mrs. Tyson,
on being asked. where the child was,
said it was dead. Tyson said he had
buried it, and on being pressed by
tho Constable took them out in the
yard, where, covered with rubbish,
was large goods box, inside of
which was small box. This Tyson
pointed to, saying, ""It is in there""


The constable opened the box and
took out something enveloped in qua
no sack. Unravelling this the body of
a new born babe was found. There
were finger marks ON It's chest and neck,
and its mouth had the appearance of
having been forcibly opened. The box
had been too short for its burden and
tho inhuman father had forced 1t down,
and now it lay there with its little legs
all twisted up to make it fit.


The Constable placed Tyson ander
arrest in charge of deputies, and the
magistrate summoned a coroner's jury.
A number of witnesses were examin-
ed whose testimony was mainly sur
mises aud suspicious, and nothing def
mite was elected until DR.. P. B. House
keeper, tbe leading physician of the
place, took the stand. He testified that
the child had been born alive and to all
appearance was a healthy infant. Its
death had been produced by an over
dose Of laudanum, nearly one-quarter
OF an ounce having been administered
TO it.


The Ms. Tyson was called to the
stand Amid sobs and groans she protes-
ted that her husband would harm her,
and refused to speak unless he was re-
moved.


This being done she told her mouLful
story. How, on Friday tho infant was
born, with no one by aid comfort her
save him who had proved so recreant.
How, on Saturday, he made her ad-
minister the first dose, and subsequently
administered the others himself; and
ho q, after taking It away from her to
i poison 1t, he afterwards hid it where 1t
was found. And how, to crown his
,, cruelty, he made her, weak and feeble
as she was, come down stairs and en-
gage in work in order 10 allay suspicion.
When the woman's story was known
the neighbols became intensely excited,
and threats Of lynching were made by
men who have ever been most law abid-
Ing. ""Hang him."" was the shout, and
Tyson turned around to the minister,
who had asked him whether he was
prepared to die, and said with grim
sniile, ""You may take me out now and
HdilB IlC w tuob btOC uSlOoo IhC ASoA1 Wv
shall go to Heaven""


After Iha consideration of this testi-
mony the jury rendered verdict that
Tyson had, with premeditated murder
In his heart, killed his child by an over
dose Of laudanum.


Constable De Ford, took his prisoner to


Elkton Jail upon commitment by
Magistrate Benjamin.


THE PRlsoNEk's sTARMENT.
He says he Is 40 years of age, was mar
ried about 1865, and has three children
living. He was formerly a teamster,
but for the past three or four years has
b zen too sick to work. The child, he
says, was weak, puny infant, and he
gave 1t the laudannm to strengthen 1t.
| He averred the greatest affection for 1t
and regret at Its death His relations
with bis wife, he said, had always been
| pleasant. He expressed perfect willing
| ness to die now. His spirit is thorough
| ly broken, and with tears running down
| his cheeks he calls upon God to witness
his innocence.


After the terrible occurrence the wife
was taken to the home of her brother-in-
law, Wesley Tyson, and here she re-
ceived the kindest treatment.
| She is little woman, not much over
| four feet high, and shows signs of once
been comfy.


| They were married about 1865, just at
| ter the close of the war, and have three
| children living, all small. Nathan has
| often treated her badly. Once, just be-
| tore one of her other children was born,
| he kicked her and Injured her very
much. Some time ago he wanted to
make her run up hill in order to pro-
duce miscarriage. lie said that II the
baby was a boy it could live, but if 1t
was a girl 1t must die, as they now had
too many and could not afford to raise 1t,


On Friday night, when the hour Of
confinement came, he refused to have q
doctor or let any of the women come in,
and he assisted her at the birth of the
child, she telling him what to do. The
child was born alive and was very
healthy and took its nourishment twice


Saturday morning Nathan said he
must kill it as they were SO poor.


al begged and prayed him not to do
it,"" she said with sobs, land told him IL


was an awful sin aud he never would be

said, ""and you must give 1t the lauda-

pored him to let iG live and that


would work hard and not let 1t be a bur


den. But he made me give 1t a tea

 SELMA, Alabama, July 24 l To the Editor of the JOURNAL COURIER:

 If any reader of the JOURNAL AND COURIER

 thinks he or she would like to spend the sum-

 mer travelling through the Sunny South, I

 am inclined to think they would get enough 1 of it in about one week. It is 900 in the | shade as l sit in my room writing and for the

 last four weeks it has been at 3 D. m.. from 90 Q to 96 Q wherever I have been. with A

 few exceptions. What with the heat, riding | on trains all night, a part of the night l working all day like beaver to get as many | Northern goods into the stocks of Southern

 merchants as possible, drinking different

 waters at each town, and eating sometimes | wien I can snatch time to eat, have lost

 about ten pounds in weight and find myself

 looking forward to September and cooler days with an exceedingly great anticipation. am at. present what is called ssdrum | mer, more properly commercial tray | eler, or some might term me @ commercial | missionary, and my ''feld'' lies in Alabama ! Georgia and Tennessee, these three great 1 States containing at least twelve times the

 territory of my own dear Connecticut Any | | will keep his eyes and ears open can hear and 1 see much to interest him and his friends, 1 and, calling all the readers of the JOURNAL

 AND COURIER my friends, I propose to try l and induce them to some things in the l South as I see them trusting may add my 1 mite to 8 better knowledge of the people and | customs of the South.

 Leaving Baltimore, my commercial head quarters, at p. m. Thursday July Sth (via l Virginia Midland railroad from Washington | find oIf fof@ 1 Lynchburg the central depot of the tobacco | trade of Virginia. It has a population of | 16,000. This is my first stopping point At | the depot some dozen porters struggle for the l honor of conducting me to the best hotel in 1 the city. Catching the eye of the gray-haired ! veteran of the Lynch House I give him the drummers' sign of '|help,"" and am in an in- stant relieved of my dusty gripsack tLe i'm l portunities of the porters, and am on my | way, not to be lynched, but provided with a l good bath and excellent breakfast. What ever l possessed the founders of Lynchburg to build l city on the side of a steep hill is past my comprehension. The streets on which the 1 business of the city is done are so steep that 1 to prevent them being washed away they ] are paved entirely with round cobble I stones and present very rough appearance. | You see tobacco everywhere. Every other 1 dray has on it either great terees packed full, l just in from some storehouse or being sent to New York or elsewhere; or large, square, 1 fattish baskets filled with the weed, being hauled to some factory to be made up into 'tJackson's Best,"" or '.Pride of the South"" or fragrant Durham, or some one of the hun dred other brands.

 At 2:5O p. m. I am ready to take the train for Bristol Tennessee The depot is just at l the foot of the hill on which Lynchburg is built, and of course nothing in the way of @ breeze can reach 1t on these hot summer days. 1 When board the train from Richmond at 3 p. m. find myself among crowd of men, women and children, all bound for the noun tains and springs, trying to get away from the torrid heat of the lowlands and cities. I The train waits nearly half an hour, and meantime the sun beats down hotter than furnace. Every seat is occupied and some are standing. so great is the rush to get to the cooling hillsides and mountains My seat companion is a young lady from Chatham, Va, near Danvile, a fiery little rebel, al- though not born till during the war; and chatty and pleasant. We get started about 3:30, and the movement of the train through the air affords immense relief to all, and those who are well wilted down brace up and show interest in the beautiful scenery we fly | past.

 l Liberty is the first watering place we pass, 1 947 feet above the level of the sea. Near here are the two peaks of Otter standing out from the surrounding hills grand and sublime. It is related of President Jefferson, who was skeptic, that he once camped all night on the higher of the two peaks, having only his colored servant with him, his purpose be- ing to witness sunrise. When Old Sol ap- peared the next morning, clothing the earth and hills with beauty far surpassing any or dinary view the old slave turned to his mas ter and upbraided him for his lack of faith in divine creator. From this time until dark we are going up, up, up, dartlng through short tunnels and around the brows of hills, l through some of the grandest scenery the shines upon, until at GAO we reach Christianburg, the highest point this route, the summit of the Alleghanies, 2,550 feet above the level of the sea. We have passed some ten popular watering places, and our car full has dwindled down to about ten passengers. The country between Lynch burg and this point, and in fact to Bristol, Tennessee, is principally grazing and wheat growing section, and as I look out and the herds feeding am made to think of the cattle upon thousand hills. Every few minutes pass threshiRg- ! machines at work, sending up clouds of dust and chaff, out in the fields where the crop is grown, and we see great stacks of straw from which the grain has been taken. Again some stretch of hill and vale, beautiful enough for painters brush, only to be succeeded by some view of mountain l or stream still more beautiful. As we stop at the watering places-Blue Ridge, Big Lick, Salem, Big Spring, Summit, etc. crowds of children and ladies come troCp1ng out to welcome friends and new corners. l The hotels look cool, and the coaches and omnibuses gay with youth and laughter Truly it IS not necessary for people here to go to Saratoga, Long Branch or Newport to l find comfort in these hot days. Virginiu end Tennessee have right within their own bor- ders scores of sulphur and chalybeate springs to heal the sick and render life worth living in the comfort they bring Up among these mountains, with their springs and&healthy forests and drives among the clouds, the Virginians flock and after two three months return to their homes refreshed and ready again for the worlds warfare and turmoil

 At Big Lick which we pass at 5 o'clock, are several large tobacco factories. Between Lynchburg and the summit of the Alleghanies are to be found over twenty popular springs with waters classified as Sweet Chalybeate Salt Sulphur, Red Sulphur, White Sulphur, Yel- low Sulphur, Warm Springs, Bath Alum Springs, Hot Sulphur Springs, Healing Springs Cold Sulphur and Blue Sulphur. Some of these are yet undeveloped. The minerals are iron, copper, coal and zinc and we pass at our left several iron furnaces and zinc works. After leaving Christianburg, where we take supper, at which the inevitable fried chicken is had, with hot biscuit, we be- gin to descend again, Bristol, Tennessee3 where we are due at 12 midnight, being 1,60O feet above the sea. About 10 o'clock, when I well settled for nap, and wishing my self well at Bristol and between sheets once more, we are brought to a sudden stop by our

 

 and quarter. A pair of drummers not hay

 ing before their eyes the fear of the god of slumber, regale the rest of their travelling companions with ""reminiscences, and every few minutes tired woman or man wants the rest of the car to inform her or him if there will be failure to make connections at Bris tol. Reassured, they subside into their cor ners again and drop into restless series of cat-naps. We finally arrive at my next stop ping place, Bristol, Tennessee, just over the half of fha hQ ing on Virginia soil and at a. m. am sound asleep, the first time for nearly sixty hours have had my clothes off or good sleep.

 Bristol is town of about 4, GOO inhabitants. It is flat, struggling town, full of life, sup

 plying merchandise to the people for twenty miles in each direction. It is a good speci-

 men of large Tennessee town, without any

 fine buildings, having one long principal

 street, upon which are located nearly all the

 business houses of the place. The street

 crossings are made of standing stones or

 steps raised six inches above the street and

 a Corn FieId-The Brave Act or a Little

 Boy.

 LANCASTER, Aug. 19.-Tuesday night a man was discovered stealing corn in one of the fields of E. H. Kaufman, living on the Harrisburg turnpike, fifteen miles from this place, by Abraham Kaufman, a nephew of William Kaufman, aged fourteen years, and Andrew Miller, farm hand, aged eighteen years. There have been a great many depre- dations of the kind and these boys were watching while the thief was prowling around the field pulling off corn and depositing it into large bag which he carried on his back Miller approached the man, saying, q want to see who you are"" when the thief, without a moments notice, pulled out large bone handled knife and plunged the large blade into Miller's body, almost piercing his heart. The boy fell down, bleeding terribly. The thief stopped over him to plunge the knife again, when little Abraham Kaufman picked up large stone and dealt him terrible blow, striking the forehead and rendering him insensible. Then the lad ran for his un- c1e, who lived some distance away, and told him of the fight The uncle mounted horse and rode to the scene of the conflict. Upon arriving there the thief, who had partially re- covered had crawled under fence and laid down to conceal himself. Upon examination it was found that he was partly under the in fiuence of liquor and very desperate. MT. Kaufman could not take the man to town without assistance. Shortly after three farm hands came along, and with their help they secured and bound the thief and brought him to this city in 8 wagon. They lodged the man in jail. The thief was recognized by the po- lice authorities as John Meyers, about fifty years old, living in this place: He has long been desperate character. When told that he had stabbed the young man and that he could not recover he replied, ''That's right ; I ought to have killed him outright"" Young Miller was taken to his home and medical aid quickly summoned. Upon examination it was found that he had received terrible gash about eighth of an inch below the heart, and his recovery is very doubtful Great ex- citement prevails in the neighborhod of the tragedy, and threats of lynching were freely indulged in."

very trivial one.


JOHN HAYRY's WRECKED HOME.


The crowd of morbid curiosity seek
ers stood on tip Zoe sad listened With
closer attention Vhen the next case was
called.


Jim, alias ""Patsey"" Wahls was the
defendant, and his coarse, brutlissfeat-
ures were rendered more revolving by
a blood stained nose and broad band
age across his forehead.
John Haney, a respectable-looking
man, had preferred charges CT threat
ening to kill, and no told his story
briefly. He came to his home ON Second
street late on Thursisy night, and
found two girls in The lower room.


""Whers's my wife ?"" he asked of one
Of the girls.


""Next door, l guess"" was the an
swer.


Then he asked, ""Who Is up stairs H'


The girl replied eyasiVely, and he
took lamp and went up stairs. In the
front room he found his wife and the
prisoner in bed together. Hs struck
them over the heads with the lamp,
but 1t broke. ""Then,"" said he, Il scs
another lamp, but 1t wasn't hard
enough, for / wanted to kill them. !""
The witness told how after he had got
officers and returned to the house, the
prisoner threatened to kill him.


Officer Pardse and Sergeant Whelan
corroborated the witness, and two girls.
Alice Miller and Mary Griffin, who had
been in the house, didn't know much
about it,""


The Mayor fined Wahls the costs Of
the case and held him in $500 TO keep
the peace.


The srring wife, Mrs. Haney, was
then srrsigned. She is rather hand
some woman, and hung her head in
shame. The testimony and penalty
were similar to that in the preceding
case.


HANCOCK MAN.


John Thomas smiled as no was LED
in. Officer Thomas testified that he
found him drunk and bowling about
politics in tae street.


""Ah, ys mast excuse me now sOr,

WILMINGTON, DEL, Jan. 26, 1880.
To the President and Members of the


Board of Education:


GENTLEMEN I'm view of the fact
that at times of promotion from primary
to grammar grades there may be many
seats untitled in the boys grammar
schools, while in the girls depa tments
there may be more applicants for pro-
motion than there are seats vacant in
the girls grammar school, or uice uersd,
and in order to utilize at all times, when
needed, the full seating capacity of the
school room; and believing that the
government and morale Of the schools
are improved by tife co-education of
sexes, your committee would recon-
mend that at the commencement of the
next school year, in September, 1880,
the seats in the various rooms of the
grammar schools be filed irrespective of
sex, in the same manner as are those of
tie primary schools at present.


Respectfully submitted,


LkNDLEY q. KENT,


L. A. Brown,


SAM'L +. BELTS,


Committee.


Under the head of unfinished business.
MIR. Morrow's motion TO transfer to the
city The sum of S22, 900, now in bank
subject to the order of The Board, came
up and III lieu of the motion Mr.. Nor
row offered the following resolution, and
moved its adoption


RESOLVED, That the proper officers be
authorized TO draw check In favor of
the Mayor and Council, for the sum of
$22, 900, from the surplus fund accumu-
lated to the credit of the Board OF Edu-
cation, and now lying unemployed in
bank, said money TO be applied by the
City Council to the payment of the
monthly installments due by that body
to the Board for the year 1880.


DR.. Grimshaw moved to lay the reso-
luton on the table, which motion pre-
vailed by the following vote:


Ayes-MesSrs. Baird, Belts, Conrad,
Furry, Grimshaw, Grubb, Kent and
Shortlidge-S.


Nays-Messrs. Heisler, Kenney, Nor
row, McIntire, Palmer, Kyne and Presi-
dent Eckel-7.


Before the vote was announced, Mr..
Kenney changed his vote to the affirma-
tive, with a view to a reconsideration Of
tie vote.


Mr.. Morrow's resolution to allow the
Superintendent TO employ a clerk, at an
expense not to exceed $50 per year, to
assist him in making his averages, also
came up as unfinished business.


DR.. Grimshaw moved to lay the reso-
luton on the table, which motion was
lost by vote of ID nays to ayes.


Dr. Grimshaw, speaking to the resolu-
tion, said he was opposed to any increase
of expense in the Superintendent's Of
flee. This officer now enjoys as large a
salary as he could get in any other city
of this country, and his work is no
i-eavier than that of most clerks, while
he has plenty of time for the perform
ance of all his duties.


Mr.. kenuey was also Of the opinion
that the Supenntendents salary was
ample TO warrant him in performing all
the duties of the office.


Mr.. Baird explained that the making
up of averages was part of the duties of
the teachers, hut as their time was SO
occupied during the examinations they
could not attend to the matter, and the
Superintendent generally employed
clerk to attent to the work.


The resolution was then adopted by
rising vote of to D..


On Mr.. Kenney's motion No. COM
mlttee was authorized to have the heat
eTs of that school repaired.


Mr.. Baird offered the folio wing pream-
bla and resolution


WHEREAS, The annual report of the
Treasurer of this Board, presented at
held January 18Th, 1880, shows a
surplus of about twenty-five thousand
six hundred ddollars above the amount
required for the expenditures of the
year 1879; and,
WHEREAS, The desire of this body is
that the Taxpayers shall be relieved as |
far as Lossibie Of the payment of heavy
taxes, therefore
ReSoiUed, That the Finance Com
mittee of this Board are hereby instruct
ed to notify the City Council that the
amount of money needed for school pur-
poses, IN addition to the surplus of S22,-
800 for the year 1880, will be S45, ,548 18. |
This will enable said Councll to fix tax
rate for school purposee about 33 per
cent. less than would otherwise be re-
quired to raise the sos 600 already appro- |
priated by them, thereby saving to the |
taxpayers one-thi7l of their entire |
school tax for 1880.
AS soon a. the paper was read Mr.. |
Kenuey moved TO lay it on TIE table.


DR.. Grimshaw raised the point that
the motion was not In order, Us no mo-
ton for the adoption of the resolution
had been made to bring it before the
Board.


The chair ruled the point not well
taken. and DIR. Grimshaw appealed.


On the call Of ayes and nayes the ru-
ling of the chair was sustained by the
following vote:


Ayes Messrs. Furry, Heisler Ken
ney Lally, Morrow, McIutire, Palmer,
Lynch and Kyne-D.


Nays-M essrs. Baird, Belts, Conrad,
Grubb, Kent and Shorthdge

vote:

Now the Fire Department are Set.
Ting tie Matter for the Present.",,"The fire department Of this city have


not yet taken much interest in the se-


lection Of candidates for the Office Of
Chief Engineer Of the. fire department.


The seeming lack Of interest is attribu-
ted by some as ruse Of the various
companies to see what candidates will


be preferred by their contemporaries.


After making queries in regard to the


matter yesterday afternoon 1t was
learned that but one aspirant was look
ing forward to q nomination. Calling
at the Friendship fire engine house the


REPUBLICAN, was told by a member of
that company that at present no candi-
date had been nominated, but in all
probability the Treasurer of the com
pany, Mr.. Thomas Lynch, would be an
aspirant for the honor of securing that


position. 1t the Phoenix fire engine


house in answer to the query whether
that company had nominated candi-
date 1t was said that no candidate had
been elected and none probably would
be. Likewise the Water Witch Com
pany have paid no attention to the
matter. A member of the Reliance
Fire Company says it will take no stock
in the affair whatever. The meeting of
the Washington Fire Company on Mon
day evening was so long that no refer.
encs was given to the question. The
matter possibly will receive attention
at the next meeting. The Fame Hose
Fire Company have not yet considered
the question, bat in all probability will
dc so at the next meeting. The Vice.
cacoe Fire Engine Company also have
been diliatory in regard to the ques-
ton. The report that Robert Cotting-
ham, a member Of this company, was
for the Office, is branded by
Mr.. c. as false. Many Of the oompa.
MES say that they think the appoint

ult, the white people and negroes of
Texarkana had a severe engage
ment, which resulted in leaving five
wounded negroes on the battle
field, three Of whom, it is thought,
would ""pass in their checks"" The
cause of this terrible tragedy
was an attempt, by the whites,
to lynch a negro, known as DR..
Cromwell, who had attempted to
rape Mrs. Coners, a white lady.
Cromwell, a few days previous to
his fendish act, had quarrel with
Mrs. Coner's husband concerning a
lot in the town Of Texarkana. The
quarrel resulted in fight. Crom-
we'll, to have revenge, attempted
his hellish act upon Mrs. c., whose
shrieks soon brought parties to her
relief, who arrested and put Crom-
we'll in Jail. The night before the
encounter, the sheriff, fearing Crom-
we'll would be lynched, secretly re-
moved him. Not knowing this,
four men started Sunday morning
to secure the Jail key. When within
few yards Of the the jail, a party
of negroes rose from behind
a fence and demanded them to halt,
and, the white men not obeylng,
opened fire, when the reserved
force of the whites came up, and
general engagement began, which
resulted as above stated, none Of the
whites being injured.


The negroes, after being routed
threatened TO burn the town, and all
the whites who could do so, armed
themselves and stood picket on the
streets all night, awaiting move
ment from tho negroes; but no
demonstrations of the kind were
made.


The whites learning that the
fend was secreted near the railroad,
not far off, selected party who
went to the round house, demanded
an engine, went to where the fend
was secreted and hanged him. The
citizens Of Texarkansa apprehend
more trouble with the negroes about
the matter, and, we suppose, keep
on the lookout."

 Paris Correspondence of the New York World.

 The origin of the great houses is lost ill obscurity, and the end of them equal lv, but 1t is always interesting when one can trace them either to their origin or in their decline. 1a case which has just been tried in the law courts in France helps us to this in the case of one great European house, that of the Duke of Brunswick. It is mt 50 much of de- cline as rotting out. It ends i'll the hulks.a It ends, 1t is true, only ill the person of an iliegltimate representative of the royal Duke, but we must take what we fl Id. The other day Uric Eu- gene Fuelfe de Collin de Bar, Vicomte de Civrv, appeared before French jury on charge of robbery and general swindling. He had been arrested in England on an extradition warrant, and before he went to England he had qui- etly relieved the landlady of the fur nished apartment which he occupied in Paris of a considerable quantity of her property. He had hired the apartment for considerable sum inthe fashionable quarter, and he no sooner obtained pos session ot it than he broke open the drawers containing the private effects ot the proprietress anG made off with them. His confederates in this transaction were his own valet and stewart and other officers of his horsehold."" The poor landladv had no suspicion of her lodger, for he bore noble French name and was of princely origin. His smother was the daughter of the Duke of Brunswick. His father was a French gentleman of extremely good descent. The poor lad was born into every species of elegant corruption, if that adjective can ever be applied to that noun. His grandfather lived the life that every one in Paris knows, went about painted up to the eyebrows, and wearing a curled perrttque, while his morals were even more artifi- cially nasty than his manner of dressing

 He installed several temporary favorites in his household at short intervals of succession, and the mother of Uric de Civry was one of them. She was brought up in kind of splendid Bohe- mia. Her father took little notice of her, being entirely engrossed with his notice of himself, and he made very slender provision for her education and training. She therefore had but little of this description t) transmit to her son. In worldly goods she was almost as badly off, for the old Duke kept a tight hold on his purse strings. She ob- tained very little money from him, though he rolled in millions, yet at the same time, though living in his house, she was always within sight of the great est luxurIes that money could purchase

 Her lips, as it were, touched river of liquid gold, but she was still athirst She formed most costly and extravapant tastes, and had nothing to gratify them with. Her son was in this respect true child ot his mother, and in others the true grandson of the illustrious Duke, so tbat he was thoroughly well equipped with bad qualities on both sides, and not a single vice was wanting for his compo- sition. He could not work, to beg he was ashamed, but he was not ashamed to steal, and he lived pretty comfortably for time in Paris on his wits and his name. His grandfather was known to be so rich that nobody hesitated to trust the young fellow, and even when the grandfather died and left all his money away from the family to the City of Ge- neva, there was still hope of recover ing it by lawsuit. In the meantime Uric de Civry went on cheating In the hope that something would turn up in the shape of favorable decision in his mothers suit for the recovery of the property. He might probably after that have turned an honest man. That was no doubt his intention, but unfortunate ly before he turned honest he had to get hls grandfather's money, and before he could get his grandfather's money, he ran short of ready cash, and was obliged to clear out the clothes-presses of his landladv, as before stated. There was hue and a cry after him, and he ran away to England. In England he was not idle. He was handsome fellow, as may be inferred from this description of him as he stood in the dock the other day:

 ""Twenty-seven years old, elegantly dressed, dark blue eyes, bright red lips, white teeth, elegantly -curled mustache"" --in fact, a perfect dead-shot in the war fare of drawing-room and ball. With these advantages he could work as well in England as in Paris. and he found means to commend himself 10 the favor of a lady of the British aristocracy, and was living very comfortably on the pocket money which she gave him when the police quietly took him by the collar. Some sort of defense had to be made for him as he stood in the French dock, but it was little to the pur- pose. The whole case was proven to the hilt. He had become the accom- plice of his very servants in the most scandalous kind of robberies, and robberies were the least disgraceful things in his career. He denied them to the last, though he incidentally ad- mitted other weaknesses which would have been quite sufficient to hang him in country where lynching-law pre- vailed, The judges sent him to prison for three years-and thus ends the story of a noble life."

that his own violin ""scraped so aw-

Friends of Grant se- veseIy critieisc the utterances of Sherman in opposition to the propo- sition to make Grant, Captain-Gen- eraI. This dissatisfaction with Sher- man is not so much over the merits of the case, as because they regard this attitude of Sherman as indicative of gross ingratitude- Grants mill tary friends are well aware that Sher- man has been under constant and deep obligatioueto Grant But for the magnanimity of the latter, Sher- mans military record would have sufferete- severely, aside from those things of which the public will have q clearer idea when the publication of the records of the war is com plsted. It is regarded as little less than ludicrous for Sherman to sheer at the proposition to create the new office for Grant on the ground that for the life of him he cannot see what q Captain General would have to do or of what use he would be.

 Starving to Death-A Man Lies Helpless

 forTen Days in n Lumber Pile.

 NEW YORK, Aug 13.-At 7:3O o'clock this morning feeble grooming attracted the at tention of Officer George Lynch, of the steamboat squad, as he was on duty at pier 47, North river. He looked around, but the grooming suddenly ceased and was not re- stunned for some minutes. The officer trac ed it to pile of lumber at the head of the pier, and in hollow at the top partly covered over with boards he found a man evidently in the last stages of starvation. He was un- able to move, or even to speak. His cheeks were sunken and his pinched face wore death-like pallor. The officer summoned an ambulance. The surgeon examined the al most inanimate man and pronounced him completely exhausted from starvation. He was put in the ambulance and taken to St. Vincent's Hospital. There he was made to take 8 milk punch, which greatly revived him and brought back his power of speech. He said that his name Charles Riley, and that he was thirty-six years old, laborer and homeless. Ten days ago he was driven from No. 843 Mulberry street, where he had lived for some time, for non-payment of rent He went into the street sick and penniless, having been out of work for several weeks before Hav- ing no place in which to rest he wandered to the North river and lay down in a hollow space at the top of the lumber pile on which he had been found. He was taken so sick that he was unable to leave it, and he told the house surgeon that for the last ten days he had nothing to eat or drink. His appear ance indicates that he is telling the truth

 THE NATIONAL CAPITAL. Mexicans Violating the Neutrality Laws.

 WASHINGTON, Aug. 13.-The Department of State has received & despatch from the United States consulate at Laredo, Mexico, which indicates violation of the neutrality laws on the part of the Mexican authori ties. A number of State prisoners confined at La redo effected their escape and fled across the Rio Grande into Texas. They were fired upon by the Mexicans while crossing, and were followed into Texas and also fired upon in United States territory. This is in viola tion of the GuadaIoupe- -Hidalgo treaty be- tween the United States and Mexico The treaty provided that escaped prisoners from either country should be extradited and de- nied the right of pursuit by the authorities. Laredo is nearly opposite Fort Mcintosh, in Texas, and the State department has inquired if the War department has any knowledge of the affair. It has not but it will be fully inquired into and action taken if it is fully shown that the offense mentioned by the consul was committed in violation of treaty stipulations.

 AUSTIN, Aug. 15.-A new sort of poisoning seems to have broken out in certain localities in this State. A report reaches here of the fatal poisoning of six men under very peculiar circumstances in Falls county. A day or twoa ago six white men, citizens of the neighborhood, were riding along the road, when observing a farmer at work in his watermelon patch near the roadside, request ed permission from him to get down and help themselves to melons. One or two of the largest melons were selected, and the men proceeded to eat. Very soon they became deadly sick Three of them died while at- tempting to climb the fence, and the sixth man fell dead while trying to mount his horse The owner of the melons is said to have dis claimed any knowledge as to what caused the eaten heartily of the melons in the same patch just before the men rode up. He is said to have been taken in hand by number of incensed citizens, who would undoubtedly have lynched him on the spot but for the ap- parent candor of his statement.

 A few days ago a country paper published here printed statement that a black boy had been fatally poisoned by arsenic found in a watermelon which the boy had stolen. The theory obtains that these melons grow in cot ton patches where Paris green is used to kill boil worm hence the poison"

business would be brisk. and more money
would be taken TO Washington than carried

The crime was the absorbing topic of con-

a few facts gathered from the hangman's
record. 1t shows that l0l men were ju-
dicially put TO death in this country
during the year, an increase of five over
the number for the preceding year.
When we say l0l men we mean men
in the more limited sense-not one
woman having been hanged during the
year. Two of this number were shot to
death, one in Utah and one in Texas,
the laws in each case giving them the
choice Of death either on the scaffold or
by the bullet. In the list of executions
North Carolina and Texas lead of with
twelve each, followed by Pennsylvania
with ten, Oregon with seven, and Vir-
ginia, Georgia and Arkansas each with
six. Only three were hung in New
York, Sixty-four of the 10l were hang
ed in the Southern States. In the res
pect Of race, So were whites, 81 negroes,
5 Indians and1 Chinaman.


Sad as the record is, there is a still
sadder one to come. Seventy-four men
were lynched in this country in the
same period of time-in Kentucky 8,
Colorado g. California O, Louisiana 8,
Texas 5, Tennessee Georgia 4, Missis-
sippi 4, Dakota 3, Nebraska 2, Wyoming
2, Illinois 2, New Mexico 2, Missouri 2,
Minnesota 2, Alabama 2, Iowa /, Ohio /,
MARYLAND |, Indiana |, Kansas l.. South
Carolina |. Montana l. These figures
are disgrace to this country. Let no
one think that the men who committed
these outrages are the only guilty par
ties-not by any means. A part of this
aggregated crime rests upon the incom-
petent, corrupt or cowardly officers who
permit murderers to escape; part upon
those sentimental judges and juries who
put mercy before justice, and part
upon public sentiment that winks at
murder and murderers. Judge Lynch
should be utterly driven from the United
States at least."

The Luckless Nationals Play n Good Gam


and Get NVorsted",,"


The Chicago club champions Of the league,
played the Nationals last Saturday aud de.
feated them by score Of seven to four The
visitors came on to the grounds attired in blue
flannel suits, with white caps, belts and stock
iugs, aud presented y neat and attractive ap-
pearance. Shortly after their arrival, IN the
presence of about 1000 spectators, the game
was commenced. 1t was soon apparent that
Lynch was not in trim, and should have re.
tired from the pitchers position ere ho did.
The rheumatics are affecting him. aud he
Is In no condition at present to play ball The
luck was all on the side of tho visitors, aud
although the home team did some sharp and
excellent fielding still it was no match for
their opponents luck. For instance, In tho
fourth Innings, after the chance was presented
to retire the Chcagos for blank, Dalrymple
hit bounding ball to tho right.held that
caromed on the top of carriage aud went iuto
the street, giving tho batter homo run and
fetching In two others Tho umpiriug was
rather unsatisfactory. Trott meant well
enough, but his Judgment was bad.

When my stomach was injured I felt life escaping from me I had only just time to say to myself that would not die, and am alive. Any one else would have died.'""

 It is no joke to offer testimony against the illicit distillers of Georgia. The moonshiners of Hickory Flats, in that State, recently hunted two witness es into swamp only twenty miles from Atlanta and besieged them there for six days. Some friends succeeded in get ting a little food to them or they must have been starved. At last they were delivered by 8 squad of mounted revenue officers sent out by Collector Clark, of Atlanta, in which city they were prompt ly concealed. Their testimony will be heard very soon in the United States Court. To save their lives, they will be then sent to part of the State remote from Hickory Flats, and purse will be made up to send their families after them.

 Referring to the 175 executions which took place in the United States last year, 75 of which were by lynch law, the New York Herald says: There is never any complaint about the inef- fectiveness of hanging as done by the lynche1s. They always run their man up smoothly and without delay, and there are only few cases on record where the same man had chance to be hanged twice. Cannot our several thou sands of sheriffs borrow wrinkle from the lynchers on this point?"

great to her when she found, after her mar
riage, that her husband whom, as s girl, sho
had admired aud honored as one who had
done his duty to his native State in arms, and
whom she supposed to be still true had in fact
allied himself with what are known in Vir-

of this kind could be found as it is u source
of modification that the Supreme bench should

THE STATUS OF MUNICIPAL. LITIGATION


THE SOLICITORS RECOMMENDATIONS.",,"GENTLEMEN-I have the honor to
submit the following report Of cases In
my charge for the year ending July q,
1880:


James Megary, d. b. a., vs.. The Mayor
and Council If Wilmington, p. b. r. No
vember term, 1878.


An appeal TO the Supreme Court from
judgment against the appellant for vio-
latlng the city ordinance against keeping
disorderly house. The case will pro-
badly be tried before the next term OF
court.


John Bowers, d. b. a., vs.. The Mayor
and Council of Wilmington. NIvem-
ber. term, 1877. This case Is similar to
the above.


James M. Williams vs.. Edmund Pro
vost, Collector. November term, 1879.
This is all action of RepIevin for pro
perty taken by the collector in payment
for taxes, due by Wesleyan Female
College.


John Tweed, d. b. a., vs., The Mayor
and Council of of Wilmington. May
term, 1880.


An appeal from the judgment of the
mayor upon the charge OF violating city
ordiran


VIM. Ruth, d. b. a., VS.. The Mayor
and Council of Wilmington. May term,
1880. Case similar TO the one just men,
toned.


Angelic CardinellO, d. b. a., VS.. The
MAJ or and Council of Wilmington. May
term, 1880. An appeal from the judgment
of the mayor for violating the city
ordinance.


The Mayor and Council of Whining
con VS.. Philip Lynch. May term, 1880.
An action brought by the city to recover
damages for taking stone belonging to
the city; will probably be tried at next
term OF court.


Council of Wilmington. In Chancery.
Case Is now a. issue.


Wm. e. Smyth VS.. The Mayor and
Council Of Wilmington. In Charcery. A
bill recently filed to erjoin the city from
collecting any ass ssment against conf
pla inant for:.his proportion of expense OF
paving the bed Of Van Buren street. No
d, cision has been announced.
The following cases have been dispos-
ed OF since last report, viz:


Eliza Harris and Mary Harris vs.. The
Mayor and Council of Wilmington. May
term, 1878. Case discontinued by plain
tiffs, who will pay costs.


William A. Murphey ct al, vs.. The
Mayor and Council of Wilmington, ct al.
In Court of Errors and Appeals. In this
case the court, at the last June term, de-
livered lis opinion affirming the decree
of the chancellor dismissing the bill, All
costs will be. paid by the cOmplainants,
| renew the recommendations made In
my last report.


think it would be to the interests oi
the city if the Mayor should be required
by ordinance to make annual reports to
the City Council. Such reports, embody-
Ing such recommendations as that Off
Ger might deem proper to make, would
be of great value to the City Council as
the legislative body of the city.


As my term of Office will expire in
May next, deem it my duty to recon-
mend that the salary of the City Solici-
tor be increased. The duties of the Of
flee are onerous and responsible and
have increased so that the almost con-
stant attention Of the City Solicitor is
required.


Such an important Office can now be
properly filled only by lawyer of ex-
perience and ability, and the salary
should be sufficiently large to secure the
services of such perssn and compen-
safe him for the loss of private practice.
recommend thorough revision of
the ordinances Of the city. Many Of
them are obsolete, others are entirely
inapplicable to the present condition OF
the city, and many others are so vague
and indefinite as 10 present grave diff
| culties to their enforcement and inter
probation.


All petitions for curbing and paving
sidewalks and beds OF streets, and the
construction of sewers should be re-
ferred to committees to ascertain wheth-
er the signatures are genuine and are
those OF properly qualified persons. l
have experienced great difficulty in the
trial uf cases, in consequence of parties
denying their signature to petitions, and
that the names of persons are sometimes
attached who are not owners OF property
or are otherwise disqualified.


Tie present method of making assess
meuts and entering liens for local i'm
provements is, in my judgment, made
quate and imperfect. Much greater par
| ticuarlty should be observed in matters
of detail, especially in describing the
property to be charged with the lien and
in ascertaininy with certainty the names
of owners Many OF the liens now
standing on the books are uncollectable,
owing to the failure of the Council aud
city officers to follow strictly the mode
| of procedure prescribed by the charter
and ordinances.


AS the Legislature will meet during
the next winter, suggest that COM
mittee ON legislation be appointed at an
early day so that mature consideration
may be given to matters upon which 1t
may be deemed important to invoke the
aid of the Legislature; such as the pur-
chase of real estate or water rights and
the condemnation of land for the i'm
provement of the water works; the use
of the public streets by railroad COM
panies and individuals for railroads and
sidings; the vacation of streets; the
change of the beginning of the fiscal
year from January to July; the sale oil
firearms and toy pistols to minors; the
amendment of the laws providing for
the assessment aud collection of taxes,
and the assessments for local improve
ments; the alteration or repeal OF the
law defining the powers and jurisdiction
of the MAYORS Couit, and many other
matters which will be suggested TO the
CITY Council.


Very respectfully submitted,

recognize it as a kindly or pleasant

under peculiar circumstances.
When look around and see the

ence that have met before, re-
grst, indeed, that it is not my es-
pecial privilege tonight to make a
Democratic speech. regret that
1t is necessary that this meeting

ure as well as my duty, to make
something of public demonstra-
ton, even in the presence of the

form before this same audience, or
at least some of you, on the even

ply in response to your calls to
speak for five or ten minutes, I
said that in this campaign should
not engage In throwing mud at
any one, or at the Republican can
didate. After had said so, a cer-
tain newspaper published here said
that the reason said intended to
pursue that policy was because I
was afraid OF the personal policy
myself. 1t was one of the editors
of the Los Angeles Express who
wrote the article, and if he gets 1t
fright, and understands what for, 1
think he has reason to know that
however much I may be afraid of

not afraid. Applause

The Coroner Jury IN the case of

caused by the explosion OF a lamp, a
full account of which has already ap-
peared In the GAZETTE, assembled last
evening at the undertaking establish
ment OF l.. W. Palmer, on Shipley, be-

The first witness called was Frank A.
Cafswell, who testified that ON Tues
day night last, about 11.30 o'clock he
was on his way home, and upon reach
Ing French street, he heard the cry Of
''fire, fire."" he stopped q moment on
the church corner, and then heard a
noise as some one running; he then ran
TO the Washington engine house and
knocked on the door to give the alarm;
while he was standing on the corner, he
doticed man who afterwards proved
70 be the man who picked Mrs. Sauer-
lander up. After leaving the engine
house, he walked up French street ac-
companied by two men named Joseph
Brady and William Lynch, and when
near Fifth they noticed something white
lying on the pavement, and l said:
""Good God, men; there is q woman ly-
ing In the street."" When we got up TO
her we found a man bending over her
stamping out the fire; she was bleeding
very freely around the face and should

| 70 help her, so returned to the house,
and endeavored to open the door; as 1
took hold Of the knot felt some one
pulling on the inside, and as the door
was partly opened a man stuck his head
out and said: ""For Gods sake 90 for q
doctor donot know what has become
Of my wife. II was that confounded
lamp that did IL, and we are almost
burned TO DEATH"" Immediately went
10 the City Hall and informed tLose
present at that place of what had oc-
CURED, and asked who would be the
best physician TO get at that time Of
night, and they informed me to 60 tor

turned to the house and assisted In put
Ting out the fire. Sauerlander repeated
several times that II was ''the confound

Mrs. Phoebe Brauenstein testified that

by some one pulling their door bell;
heard a man asking for help as a woman
was bui ned; my husband called me, and

b e; when l went into the house SAN

continued TO help to dress his wounds,
and after that was done we laid him on
a bed. 1 remained with him the re-

The morn- ing service which began at 10 o'clock, was devoted to the ceremonial confirmation of be- tween fifty and seventy-f five children. from this ard adjoining towns. The touching and tender ceremony of the imposition of hands was feelingly performed by Bishop McMahon of Hartford, who afterwards spoke to the children of the significance and importance of the step they were taking; gave suggestive hints for their future religious guidance, and exhorted them to right and noble living The exercises of the afternoon for the dedication of the new bell, attracted many people, and the church was again closely filled. The ded- icatory sermon was delivered by Rev. Father Lynch of North Adams, and it was most scholarly and eloquent discourse, replete with illustrative poetical quotation, admirably ren dered The music of the day, furnished by singers from Troy, was worthy of all praise it was of high order, inspiriting and elevat- ing. The bell is gift to the church iron, the young ladies of the parish. It is of large size and excellent tone, and will prove ser vlceable and noticeable addition.

of Virginia, and attached its fortunes to his. as
well as his fortunes to those of his old politi.
cal enemies. The two are united for the de-
struction of the Conservative party of Virginia.
And this is the fact that we have to recognize
and must deal with. 1t is idle to think of
compromise with these people-we mean Gen.
eral MAHoNE and his party leaders. They
loathe tho Conservative party more than they
ever did the Republicans, aud have no idea of
returning to its fold, except upon terms that
would be dishonorablo to the party, aud which
could not be conceded. It will never accept
General MALONE as dictator; and lie will be
that, or nothing.


We repeat it.: The coalition is complete
Tho Readjusters and tho Republicans of Vir-
ginia are united In opposition to the Conserva-
tive organization, and mean its destruction il
they can compass that object 1t only remains
therefore for the honest Democrats and Con-

We are prone to think that tho YHgnidn,
in making its statements, uniformly tells
only that which it believes to be true but
then, after all, it is not poss sessed of that
degree of inflllibility which doprives il OF
the power of being mistaken. That General
MALONE and his allies have placed the Con-
seryative party in Virginia in a hopeless
minority the leaders of that once powerful
and controlling organization begin to realize
painfully. This however, never could have
been accomplished without the aid of tho
Republicans, who had been trOdden into
the very earth by the unrelentng tread
and infamous methods Of that party. The
domination of the Conservatives had been
so arbitrary, ovcrbearing, unjust and dis
honest that it brought disintegration within
its own ranks. Such Democrats rs
General MAHoNE aud Others who we
could name had become 80 thoroughly dis.
gusted with the policies and practices of the
Conservatives in managing the State In It's
financial aud other interests, that they re-
solved to break away from the Democratic
organization, and, if possible, to secure Il
sufficient following to accomplish change
of policy on the debt and other important
questions The funds dedicated to educa-
tonal purposes had been misappropriated
or stolen, until that cause which holds so
dear place in the popular heart of that
State had been brought TO laugushing
condition, and its schools were being closed
and the fountain Of primary education was
being dried up This was the condition ol
things, allied to the fact that the States in
debtedness had become so onerous and un-
bcamble that portion of the Conservative
party resolved to seek an amelioration o.
their condition in a change, and declared
their purpose in that direction more than q
year ago


This action and its purposes found ready
sympathy with the Republicans, They had
so long suffered from the iron heel of cen
seryatism that any prospect Of relief wa'
grateful TO them. They saw their oppor'

a little Gum, of remarkably small cal

Nothing more silly has transpired in

backed up by a gang of bowling jour-

vative""-and it would take year for
any one of them to tell what ""conser-
vative"" meanS-there is no telling
what republican congress will do
with these contested seats. 1t may be
safely predicted, however, that, if rad
icalism can be profited, all of the
legally electe representatives will be
turned out, and their seats given to
men who were n OF elected.


AT present the gigantic intellect of

 A run of about five hours out from Chattanooga brought us to Knox vile, beautiful city of some impor- tance. It is near the head of nayi gation on the Tennessee river. The business of the place has grown to some importance, and substantial blocks of buildings give the place q solid look. The custom house is 8 handsome marble structure. the mar ble being an abundant of the hills near the city. The university of Tennessee and the deaf and dumb asylum are located at Knoxville and are handsome buildings.

 At Morristown, about AS miles east of Knoxville, we found !. so-ss Of 2000 souls. Here we had the plessnrs sss meeting Mir. Jno. E. Hell ems, editor of the Morristown Ga zstte. Morristown is the county seat of Hamlin county.

 Seventy four miles from Knox vile we pass Greenville the county seat of Green county, and the former home of that great sen of Tennessee. Andrew Johnson. From the car windows, situated on . pretty eleva- ton, we can see the white marble shaft marking the last resting place of all that is mortal of this great man. At Union, eleven miles from Bristol, we make halt, and in a body, made a visit to Mrs. Mary Stofer, q daughter of ex-president Andrew Johnson. We were about as dusty and dust begrimed set of persons as you hare ever seen, get ting of the cars travel-worn and without even time to dust of our clothes or wash. But notwithstand- ing our unprepossessing looks, Mrs. Stofer received us gracefully and cordially, and expressed much grat ification at the honor thus done to the memory of her husband. She is an elderly, pleasant lady. aud has an elegant residence, new and elegantly furnished. located upon a lovely site. She showed many family relics, among the number, the tailor's shears with which MT. Johnson com menced his trade.

 We reached Bristol at 8 p. m. and took up quarters for the night at the Virginia House, kept by a diminu- tive statured gentleman named John Wood, who. being in delicate health weighed only 423 pounds. We were pleasantly roomed at this house and farsd splendidly in the dining room. At this point we met an old Arkan- sas friend, Dr c. $. Vance, of Mar. shall, Searcv county. This part ol Virginia is his old stamping ground and he was here on a visit. The route from Chattanooga to Bristol is over and through picturesque country. At Bristol we formed the acquaintance of Mir. Jno. Slack, edi tor Of the Courier. From this point we checked through to Washington The Atlantic. Mississippi and Ohio road is the line over which we made the run from Bristol to Lynchburg . distance of 204 miles. It is a mos, excellent road-is we'll ballasted and smooth and steady. The greater portion of the track has just been re laid with steel rails, and the most approved pattern of iron bridges have replaced the wooden ones. It is justly popular as the great passenger route from all points l south and southwest to the north and east. It has the automatic air brakes and the Miller patent safety plat forms and couplers, and runs palace sleepers on all night trains. The conductor with whom NC travelled from Bristol to Lynchburg, Capt. "". A. Horton, of Lynchburg, we found to be one of the most aecommodat- ing and gentlemanly conductors we have ever met on any road. He is one of the oldest conductors on the road having served the road co1tinu- ously tor 26 years. We were placed under many obligations to him for kindness in pointing out places of interest along the route. It Is a pleasure to travel over a road with such 8 conductor as Capt. Horton. The scenery along this road is very beautiful and grand. The topograph- ical conformation of the country which it travsrses is varied and In- teresting. At Bristol the elevation IS 1900 feet above the level of the sea. At this place the western slope of the Allsghany mountains faces us, and at Mt. Airy it crosses that mountain range at an elevation of 2600 feet. Gradually going down grade from Mt. Airy we enter the Roanoke valley at Salem, and the landscape of that delightful little valley IS as lovely as our eye ever rested upon. Leaving this valley we approach the Blue Ridge mountains and cross them at Bufords Gap at an elevation of 1900 feet From Buford's station, l67 miles from Bristol and 37 miles from Lynchburg we get 8 fine view of the lofty peaks of Otter. Decending the Blue Ridge we soon find ourselves at Lynchburg-the City of Hills. This is the halfway point between Bristol and Norfolk. All along the route from Bristol to Lynchburg are numerous and de- lightful summer resorts, also many "

In the brief time that have permitted
myself to tarry in Richmond, I have had
time to meet several bankers, merchants
and railroad men-all Southerners-and
they oil declared that the growth and pros
perity Of their city was wonderful. One Of
them said to me that he saw his beloved
capital on fire, and wouldn't have given ten
thousand dollars for the whole place. ""You
have no idea of our great prosperity"" said
he. why sir, in 1860 we had about ST.
900 population, and about the same, OF a
little less, at the time Of the surrender. In
five years We increased our population to
81 900; and, in ten years after, the census
most of these people are just the kind we
want"" Mr.. Johnston, Of the firm of Johns
ton & West, extensive stationers and book
sellers, informed me that since January /,
1880, 179 brick and ""a frame buildings have
been erected and ""a elaborately enlarged.
There have arrived at this port since Jan
uary l, 1880, $40 sailing vessels and $50
steamers, with a total tonnage of 975, 900.


Even if manufactures did not meet the
eye upon every turn upon the approach to
the city, it would not be the fault Of the
water. power of the James river, which is
hardly excelled by the Mississippi at Min
neapolis. There are upon both banks of
the James extensive Touring, paper, and
cotton mills, and large number Of iron
manufactures, among which is the famous
Tredegar Iron Works, noted for its manu-
facture of Confederate armament during the
late civil war. The most important industry
Of all, however, is that of Tobacco, which at
present operates ""a separate establishments
and gives employment to 6, 450 negroes.


Richmond is not alone in its posperity.
It has such neighbors as Petersburg, Lynch
burg and Norfolk, in the race. Norfolk,
however, is making impressive strides
Last year 42O new buildings were added to
its architecture and over 1000 inhabitants.
Its port business last year amounted to
$38, 200, ,436. In this total is included $13,-
789, ,209 from cotton exported and $780,
900 for coastwise cotton trade. The peanut
crop alone amounted to $1.000.00"

A Location EIend.",,"There is not Q mining community on this coast that is not cursed by the location fiend. That the black mailer is bad there is no denying :; but for tricks that are mean and for tricks that are contemptible the loce- tion fiend is boss. Like the coyote, you cannot scare him of. With a copy of Copps' handbook and a tape line he roams abroad, and woe be- tide the old stakes that may come in his way. You might build another Chinese wall around the 1900 feet of ground upon which you had been to work for years and congratulating yourself upon having a clear title if not good claim. Try to sell your claim aad you will find that the fiend : has been around and swu5g the northwest corner of 'Whangdoodle' through your Chinese wall, and can bring ten good citizens to swear they had seen him put up the location notice of the ''Whangdocdle'' long before you were born. It never an noys the location fiend to be cramped for room. He has been known 10 climb up one side of pine tree and down the other with tape-line be- tween his teeth, in oruer to get all of the 300 feet on each side of his ledge that the law allows him.

 The location fend never works Q claim. He is too busy for that. He is the first at stampede and the last 10 leave. You can not get up in the night and put up monument on a new discovery without finding the fend hard at work stalking of exten- sions. Lynching cannot squeIch him he was never kDown to die; but we would suggest as the most effec- tual remedy for his 1termination, the enforcement of the stumpage law.

He had almost completed tbts, and early in the evening he and Mir. Wilson called at the office of Justice of the Peace Eldred, an old and warm friend of Shouse. They had been con. versing tor some time and were about to separate, when Bartree, who is farmer at Ledgedale, few miles distant from Hones- dale, hurriedly entered the front office, With. out stopping to say word lie reached his right hand dowh into the hip pocket of his trousers, and, drawing a revolver, rushed in front of Shouse, placed the muzzle at his temple, and discharged the weapon twice. Mir. Shouse's head fell back in the chair in which he was sitting, and, without speaking word, he expired.

that at least five of the solid democratic

methods that have been resorted to to crush
out the republican vote of that section. 1t
is of this undeniable fact that we complain.

It was more from accident than design

that there really was any thing thar

mot hewever refrain from referring to
the bravery and boldness of Mr..
Ford in pushing his claims
for Democratic nomination in the face
Of the fact that 1t was prs-arranged by
the leaders Of the Democracy two years
ago, that in ease the election Of Mr..
Pyle was allowed without factious oppo-
sition, that Col. Purnal Lynoh was to
be his successor. We have nothing in
the world against Mr.. Lynch, but on
the contrary we like him and have
ever found him to be gentleman, bat
having become the candidate of a ring
in the Democratic party that farms out
the Offices two years in advance, We
havo an admiration for the man who
will wade in and smash that ring. A
Col. Ford seemed to be doing that
thing, we were kindly inclined towards
him, but at the same time we want it
to be distinctly understood that this is
none of oar fight. The Republicans
have had their nomination and we ex-l
poet to give those nominated heayKy
support. Mr.. Ford is Democrat /and
does not expect any support FROM the
REPUBLICAN,, indeed all that We hays
said that night be considered favorable
to Mr.. Ford has been without soNcita.

contest with a oO9siderable degree
Of interest. Two years aGc we were
made aware that q bargain and sale

rather Of the itinsrapt order of preach

residents Of Princess Anne, which took

against Shores and Bowen, which may
be carried into effsct bsfore the day is
over. The fact that the child is the
step-daughter and first cousin OF the
old farmer, and that she is only twelve
years old, has aroused feeling against
him that may result in tragedy. The

Paige, a colored iii sInber of the Virginia house
OF delegates, yesterday introduced in that body
a resolution citing the fact that within this
month negro at Amherst Court House. and
Arthur Jordan, another, at Warrenton, Fau-
quier county, have been lynched, the former
charged with ravishing young white girl OF
Amherst, and the latter the seduction, abduc-
ton and marrying, whilst he already had
wife, Miss Corridor, white girl, OF Fauquier.
Mr.. Pafge'S resolution requested Gov. Holiday
to offer suitable reward for the arrest of the
men charged with these unlawful executions.
He offered no excuse, he said, for the rigorous
punishment OF his race when convicted OF these
heinouS offenses, but only desired they should
have formal conviction and regular execution
under the law. Gen. w. H. Payne, of Fauquier
county, In which Jordan was lynched, in reply
to MF. Paige, strongly deprecated mob law, but
Said:-""In the case like the one In question,
where this negro Seduced and kept as his mis-
tress the daughter OF man who had given him
employment, and when, too, that accused was a
married man, will turn my back and shut my
eyes whilst operations are going on"" He re-
peated, as his opinion, that he who Is guilty Of
such heinouS offenSe. whether the victims be
white or black should be hung on the nearest
tree Gen. Payne'S motion to refer Mr.. Paige'S
resolution to the committee on courts of justice
for investigation was carried by vote OF % to
13-every white member present but one voting
negative. Gen. Payne said that none OF the Cit
Kens OF Wafrenton had any connection with or
knowledge OF the lynching OF Jordan.

disoernible. In such crowd accidents must
be expected, but beyond tho breaking of u

touching Col. Thomas Ford's candidacy
for the Democratic nomination for Sher-
if have caused considerable anxiety on


the part Of the Democratic ring leaders.


The latter have woke up to find that


Mr.. Ford is not only prominent but q


formidable candidate and contestant


with Mr.. Purnal Lynch, for the nomi'


natl IN which was two years ago sold oat


to the latter. Since this has been discov-


cred the old Bourbon ring.rulers have


bsstirred themselves to strengthen the


broken down hedges of the party and


are in search for the lost sheep that


have strsyed away to Mr.. Ford's fold.


Persuasive measures are first to bs used


but if those are not successful the lash
is to be vigorously applied to the recall


citrants. The second Saturday OF June
| is to decide whether members Of the


Democratic party will meekly walk up


to the polls at the Democratic nomina,


ton for Sheriff and ratify the sale said


to have been made to Col. Lynch two
years ago, when Mr.. Pyle with his


pocket full of silver rocks swooped


down upon the party from the hills of
Christiana Hundred and scooped in the


nomination. The question with the
Democracy is whether the rank and file
Of the party who do the hard labor
shall have any say in the matter Of
choice except to vote for the man deci-
ded upon at the last election to be this
years candidate and who has been kept
bandboxed up for the occasion ever
since. Mr.. Ford is not exactly the lead
er of the party who says that this
course cannot be practiced any longer,
but he has the manly independence to
be a candidate against the elect and all
who are opp osed to Bourbon ring rule
and opposed to few fixing up the slate
to suit themselves, are tiocking to his
The day has come in politics
when ring rule cannot long be success
ful in any party, and he should be
hailed as a man worthy Of support who

are Republicans and shall not vote fol
sither Mr.. Ford or Mr.. Lynch, but at
the same time we cannot fail TO admire
he man who places himself fairly and
Iquarely before the people unfettered
md unhampered by rings for their suf-
RACES. Mr.. Lynch is gentleman but
le is not more SO than Mr.. Ford; he is a
Democrat but not better one than Mr.. II
'opd; he is the candidate of a clique, y
"" ring by which be was set aside two tt
ears ago to be the successful candidate

should be the case. Very few clubs could

PREPARING TO INCREASE THE REPUB-
LICAN MAJORITY IN CONGRESS
SEATS OF SOUTHERN MEMBERS TO
BE CONTESTED.


Though no notices of contests have as
yet been filled by republican candidates
for Congress from Southern States dur
ing the last campaign, it is understood
| that within the time specified by law
notice of contest will be filed by the re-
publican candidate in Delaware, on the
ground of illegal election laws. In
West Virginia the seat of Mr.. Wilson
will be contested by the republican can
| didate in the First district. Mr.. Will
sons majority as claimed was about 120.
| In Virginia rsadjuster candidate talks
| of contesting Cabell's seat in the Fifth
district. In North Carolina's First dis
| ..;ot Crapdu ronuhlinon will ooptaof
Latham's seat. In South Carolina, un-
der Instructions, it is understood, from
the National Republican Committee, the
five democratic Representatives will
have contests. In Georgia's First dis
trict Collins, republican, will contest
Blacks seat. In Florida Bisbee will
again be a contestant for the seat from
the Second district. In Alabama Lowe,
greenback dem ocrat, and member OF
present Congress, will contest the seat
given TO his democratic opponent In the
Eighth district, and in the Fourth the
epublican will contest Shelley's seat.


In Mississippi Chalmers, represent
ing the Sixth or Shoe String district,
will have his right to the certificate
contested by Lynch, colored. In Loui-
siana the contest will be for the seats
OF Messrs. Gibson, of the First; Blan-
chari, of the Fourth, and King, of the
Fifth districts. In Missouri the Third
district will give contestant named
Lessingham, who disputes the election
of Mr.. Frost, whose claimed majority
was about one hundred and ninety
1t will thus be seen that there is pro
liability of sixteen Republican Con-
gressional nominees in Southern Sta, ef
contesting the seats of that number Of
Democrats, and one Readjuster and
one Greenback Democrat asking fol
the seat of straight Democrat.


FRACTIONAL NOTES.


The bill introduced in the Senate
TO day by Mr.. Ingalls, to provide tor
the issue and redemption of fractional
notes authorizes the Secretary of the
Treasury to issue ten, twenty-five and

to exceed in the aggregate $40, 600, ,OOO

the Inconsistencies OF Garfield. the Repub-
ican managers hurried an agent 70 Gar
field for his views. but he was afraid to
open his mouth. Failing by this means
the Associated Press was brought to the
aid of the managers. and at recent
meeting of the directors Of the National
Associated Press, held at Cleveland,it was
decided to dispatch special agent of the
association to Gen. Gar6eld's residence,
near Mentor, for the purpose OF making
every possible effort to procure brief and
concise statement Of tho tariff issues
from the candidate. MIR. r. I. Paine, Jr..
city editor Of The Press of Cleveland was
chosen to act in this capacity, and Oct. Is
visited the Garfield homestead with pre-
pared list of questions, among which were
the following:


''Why in 1864, did you vote to reduce
duty on railroad iron from eighty to slxtv
cents per hundred?""


will you explain the following extract
from speech delivered by you in 1866,
and published in the Congressional Record
of the same year2 I am willing as a
compromise to favor the reduction on
railroad iron. I think we should also
reduce the proposed duty on salt, t,and have
no doubt in several other particulars We
should reduce the rate of duty.


''In 1866 you said in answer to a speech
delivered by Thaddeus Stevens: Against
the abstract doctrine of free trade, such,
very little can be said. AS theory it
has much to commend It. Il can never be
applied to values except in time oi
peace


During debate in congress in 1870 you
are accredited with saying: Nor will il
be denied that a large majority of the
great thinkers of the day are leading ir
the direction of what is called free trade
and much can be said in its favor.


In 1872 you voted yes on bill in
which il was proposed. on and after Aug,
l. to make rebate of 10 per cent, of all
duties on wood, iron and steel, and every
thing else of like composition except cot
ton machinery""


What have you to say to pamphlet
circulated in Maine. In which it is stated
that in 1872 Congressman Lynch intro
duced q bill, which you supported. in
structing the secretary of the treasury to
pay rebate, equal to the duties col
lected on nuts, bolts, and other articles
which enter into the composition of ships
and othe: buiIdings?""


Are you a member of the Golden Free
Trade club. of EngIand?""


When Mr., Paine entered the residence
of Mr.. Garfield he was shown into the
parlor, where dozen or more people were
found in waiting. Among these was Mayor
Mckinley. On inquiry it was learned that
Garfield was closeted with gentleman IN
an adjoining room, and subsequently it
was found to be Capt. Henry. a special
agent of the postofice department. who is |
stationed at Cleyeland, and who, since the |
nomination, has acted as bodysguard to
the candidate. He is found with him on |
all occasions, and seems to thoroughly |
understand the duties he is expected to
perform. If Mr.. Garfield can not elude
reporter any other way, Henry is found |
ready to step in and break the charm. and |
carry off his master on some seemingly |
very important errand. These two gentle
men were in consultation when dinner was
announced, and on invitation of Mrs. Gar
deld all. with the exception of MIR. Paine |
adjourned to the dining room.


A few seconds later Mr.. Garfield enter

ABERDEEN, Miss, March IL, 1880.",,"


SIR: Since my last letter. dated at Oko,oun,
| have been fortunate enough to gather tew
additional points in reference to political
affairs in Mississippi, and approaching your in
structions to correspondents to be brief, | will
cndcavor to comply as near us possible.


Perhaps it is necessary to state, In the out
set, that have given very close attention to
Mississippi politics In order that might asccr
tain, if possible, why it was that so great
unaumity of sentiment should prevail
throughout the State in favor of General
Grant mud l fnd that ii Is attributable to
several causes: In the first place tho timid
policy inaugurated by tho present Admnistra-
ton tho anxiety manifested as to tho final
result of that policy, the gradual removals of
the old tried aud trusted leaders from official
positions, aud their places filled with Demo.
cratic bulldozers and men of doubtful political
character, and finally the abandonment of the
Republicans and turning them over to the
tender mercy of the Democratic party. While
all this was transpiring at home, they saw the
cowardly surrender of thl States of South
Carolina and Louisiana TO Democratic control;
| Republican Governors dCpOsed, State L0gisla.
| lures usurpcd, aud Republican organizations
| throughout the southern States disbanding,
notwithstanding tho fact the National Admin.
istration was still Republican,; yet no soothing
| counsel WAS waited bnGk 10 calm tho fears and
doubts that prevailed; no implied regrets ox'
pressed for the base betrayal of the mon who
had rislied their all in the effort to uphold aud
| iniuse Republican principles in the South, but
with a brazen Indifference they were given to
understand that hope defcreth hope; that the
sceptre was about to depart from Judah; that
| it was the fixed aud unaltcrbe policy of the
Administration to Conciliato the Southern
| Democrats ut whatever cost or sacrifice. These
| inevitable facts constantly staring tho RCpub-
lcans of Mississippi in the face, Is it to be
| to fl,,,f
Grant rs their hopo and mainstay for the iu'
turc? In him they have faith, aud, feeling
| the injustice done them, and tho tardineSs OF
| tho Administration to right the great wrong,
permitted; no amount Of fnely-spun sophstry
or seductive appeals can ever inYoiglo them
| into the ranks of rival cnndidates The old
| Roman lcgons were never moro cOmpaCtly OF
solidly knitted together than are tho Republi'
cans OF Mississippi to-day in favor of the illus
trious hero, statesman and citizen, General
| Grant.


There is another plausible reason assigned
| for this popular outburst in favor of Genera
Grant. 1t is pretty generally believed in diff
| ferent sections of the State that the Fedora
power Is being used TO further the interests o
u member of the Cabinet as Il Presidential
candidate by an arrangement which points to
the removal of all Federal officials not in nc
cord with his cause, and who are known to be
favorably inclined to eithor Grant OF Blaine


The old trusted leaders, embracing the in


telligence and worth of the party, such Il,

Kce, Colonel A. p. Shattuck, Captain !. l.

influence Mt Washington to control the ap
pOintment of q iourth.cass postmaster Tho
Republicans are not Indifferent to these
things, and they will eagerly watch tho op
portune moment TO put quietus on all sual
arrangements and prescriptions.


The circular sent out by the Southern l!e
publican Committee at Washington docs moi
meet with approval among the Republicans o
this State. They see in the suggestions Hd
yahced Trojan horse stuffed with Treasury
notes, and they do not propose to be caught
mapping this time, Not 10 instruct is the
very thing tho opponents Of General Grant
havo been working for, knowing that it Is
| IN utter impossibiity 10 instruct for anybody
else; and their last hope is that tho state con
venton will not instruct, that they may
manipulata the delegates TO suit their own
personal ends. The motives which prompted
the committee to Issue its circular may have
been proper and right rs viewed from thciI
standpoint ut Washington, but its recon-
meudHJiOns are seen in u different light hero
and the committee must not feel aggricved !
their advice is not sanctioned by the STATE
convention. General Grant is tho choice n
ninety.nine out of every hundred Republican,
IN Mississippi, and not to instruct for him
would exhibit wanton disregard OF tht
wishes of the party. Ii, by some Unforeseen
circumstances General Grant should not bt
nominated, there would DO ample timo Il
consult rs to the merits and ayaiabily Of can
didatcs.

at their headquarters in readiness to
90 to Townsend by special train.
Co. A had secured the j. &. Yates
fife and drum corps, which arrived
on the Gas train, and proceeding to
headquarters sounded the roll.
The boys tell in line at once and to
the stirring music of flies and drums
proceeded TO the depot, and drawing
up in open order received the Her
bert Club"" The crowd about the
depot was simply immense for this
city and their hearty cheers as these
friendly greetings were passing be-
tween the companies showed that
they were fully appreciated by the
public.


Captain Toner, of Co. A, detailed
eight pioneers and stationed them
at the doors of the two first cars
with orders not to allow any but un-
formed members TO enter. Thus
all confusion was stopped and the
company boarded that portion of
train set aside for them in the best
of order.


The Herbert Club and civilians
then filled the remaining four cars
aud at 7.25 the order was given ""all
aboard"" and we were on our way to
Townsend. At State Road mo-
ment's delay, few taken on, and
away again. AT Kirkwood thirty
were added, at Mount Pleasant 65
boarded the train, and on reaching
Middletown over 100 uniformed men
were drawn up in line and took pas
sage. BY this time fully 600 men
were packed away in seven cars and
the good natured humor of the throng
was the best evidence that all handt
were out for a jol!iticatlon.

tured by Manager Albaugh, but ap-
peared at the matinee on Saturday,
evidently intoxicated. He walked
up to one of the proscenium boxes,
Ia which was seated the proprietor
of the hotel, where he stopped, and
shaking his fist at that gentleman's
face, exclaimed: ""Get out OF here.""
On Saturday night his condition
was greatly improved, but he omit

he suddenly walked down to the

and then in a weak and trembling
voice, and with tears pouring down
his cheeks, Fritz spoke as follows:

sat down on the stage and exclaim.

[Applause.] Then In an undertone
Emmett said (apparently address

saying, ""Let the music go on"" and
finished the performance without
further break. When lie made al

CHICAGO, September 2lst.-The
Inter. Oceans Springfield, Tenn,
special says: Some time ago
white man was found dead in this
vicinity. He was u bachelor OF
considerable property, and lived at
Haddlersville. He was not q poll
tician, but q planter Of good char
acter, and was undoubtedly MUIR
dered by some highwaymnn for
booty. Nevertheless, the Demo-
0crats Of this section took advan-
tAge OF the occurrence for political
effect, and soon after arrested sew
en- OF the colored Republican lead
ers-the best men, and those Of the
most political influence = and
charged them with this crime.
They were sent to jail and tortured
by all the methods known to the
inquisition to induce them to CON-
fess their guilt. They were whip
ped, hung by the toes and thumbs,
and would have died under the
torture II they had not been men Of
extraordinary constitutions. OF
course no confession could be OBJ
tained, and no evidence against any
of the prisoners was secured by the
Prosecuting Attorney, who, by the
way, WAS . Democrat. The men
who Investigated this outrage en-
desvored to have the trial post
poned until after the election, as 1t
was very apparent the men would
be acquitted. But being unable to
secure postponemeut they organ.
ICED . mob Of $50 Democrats and
attacked the Jail 1t night and
lynched two Of the colored men.
The remainder will be held fol
trial. The object Of lynching was
to terribly the col0red men, and II
has been accomplished. While the
Democrats here all deprecate the
tendency to give political color te
the outrage, and attribute ths
lynching to public feeling among
the whites, that crime ought to bs
punished Without waiting for lega"

derstand what is meant by it and
have taken warning. The colored
men who were lynched were re.
spectacle, law-abiding citizens and
active Republicans. Alexander
H. Byrd writes from Eutaw,
Green county, Alabama, showing
that in the precinct from which
Mr.. Byrd writes there were Ut
votes cast, according to the count
as made by Democratic judges.
The Democratic ticket had a major-
ity. But now come forward 621 men
who make affidavit that they voted
the Republican ticket, which
would give an absolute Republican
majority in the precinct OF over
500. Mr.. Wallace, the United
States Commissioner who came
from Mobile to take the affldavits
referred to above, was first grossly
insulted by some prominent Demo-
Gratis, and afterwards five rifle shots
were fired at him and his friends as
they sat under tree in the Court
house yard. Fortunately they were
not hit, but a mule standing near
them was killed. Mr.. BY ri pre-
diets, from what he knows of the
present temper and intentions, that
II Hancock is elected there will be
war brought about by the domi-
neering and aggressive spirit whicb
will then break forth with all its
virulence.

PARIS, Sept. 20 2O-Gambetta re.
turned to Paris Friday evening. He
and Constans had a long interview
Immediately after. The universal
opinion is that Constans has been
acting under Gambetta's advice,
and that De Freycinet's Montaubau
speech was the beginning of the
conflict between him and Gambet.
ia, which had ,.o ,..i.re of compro-
mise, but hi.st result in De Freycin-
cts resignation or surrender, unless
he proved stronger than Gambetta.
The latter's friends express the
belief that De Freycinet wishes to
be elected a life Senator; then as.
pires to the leadership of the anti
Gambetta Republicans. To.day's
official Journal publishes a letter
from President Grevy to De Frey
cinet in which the writer says: II

determination to resign, and shall
not forget tie services you have

 have become about one of the most ! famous mining men on the continent In one day received sixty lelters-all

 from strangers-from people that the

 Star has been sent 10 containing

 marked articles. These many people

 received the impression that the Star was printed to denOunce a man that

 had caught and exposed its editor in some stealing operation.

 When I was in Tucson with my friends we could not go to the ""w. C.""

 without the editor of the Star escort. ing us. He told us that all mining

 cor Uanies paid him for notices and

 paid largely He further stated he

 was confident many of these mining

 outfits were frauds and they dare not

 refuse paylng him, for he could ruin

 them.

 We'll, he cannot ruin the Shakespeare

 and he cannot get cent. l believe that he steals little from the Stage I Company, but that is not the Shaks-

 peare Company.

 l wish 10 say something to you

 which YOU can use in any way you see

 lit. l know many of the good people I Of Tucson, both Americans and Mrxi cans, would lynch Hughes had they

 heard certain statements made by him

 as journalist and otherwise.

 ! He said there was no such thing as a virtuOus Spanish woman, nor could

 he think of Mexican man who would not steal. He further stated that he knew the convent school was simply run 10 accommodate the priests.

 My first impulse was to throw him out ""f my window ID the hotel. but I knew would be only polluting n.y. sell by touching him. l then asked him what exceptions he made. 10 which he replied he would not except any. He then began to make disreputable statements about the American ladies. Thss l promptly stopped, as 1 knew ! personally Ihe husbands and the ladies. but he had already named one married iady m connection with granting him iavors during the absence of her hus- band at lrrscott, forgetting time-hon. ored principle of ""even honor among | thieves""

 But G""d help the wretch who after receiving such favors would bctray the honor of the woman and loos, ly boast Of such thing in the presence of three men. In court of justice ifI l am present he dare not deny one ints Of these statements, and l can have them ALL FULLY SUSTAINED

 During my sOjourn in Tucson no man on earth ever heard ue make loose statement about female charac ter. In fact, always feel that it is mans duty to tear yagrant 10 pieces who attacks female character. But I was simply sOjourner; he was occu py ing the position of moral teacher

 Summoned.

 It will be recollected that on the night of February 18th the night switchman on duty at the ''Tin bridge"" over Mill river saw @ man.who was crossing the bridge fall into the water. He reported the facts in the case, and a day or two after it was ascertained that Owen McGrail, who with his family lived at No. 200 East Chapel street, was missing. The friends of McGrail made several efforts to find the body, but without avail. Tester day afternoon a little daughter of John Welch, who lives at No. 46 View street. was missing, and the mother, fearing that the child had fallen into the river, walked along the banks in search of her little one. While doing this she saw what proved to be a body floating in the water. Nothing could be seen but hair floating upon the top of the water, but supposing it was her child, Mrs. Welch gave the alarm. Officer Leyerzapf was noti- fled, and securing boat and the services of Patrick Lynch, rowed out to the place indi- cated and secured the body, which proved to be that of Owen McGrail floating upright in the water. Word was sent to the police office by telephone, when Roundsman Smith and Acting Coroner Hugh Deiley repaired to the locality, which was about one hundred feet above the bridge. By orders of the coroner the body was removed to the station house, and from there was taken to the almshouse The coroner directed jury of inquest to be summoned to meet at the police office this morning at II o'clock. The jury will proceed to the almshouse, and after viewing the body will hear evidence and render their verdict, which will probably be that the deceased came to his death by accidental drowning. The family of McGrail have removed from their former residence on East Chapel street and up to a late hour last night their present ,ubaraohouta had not hean asoertainAd"

""sECTIoNALIsM"" AGAIN.


The Lynchburg VGgiaidn rises to ex-
plain and to controvert the positions of THE |
NATIONAL REPUBLICAN on the question of
sectionalsm, and in doing so it seems to
have lost the thread Of the discussion, or at |
least to have become somewhat beclouded |
in the effort to show that solid north oc-
casioned solid SOUTH"" Such q PROPOSE |
ton certainly betrays q bewilderment of
ideas Our most excellent monitor and ex


emplar Of elevated discussion now takes |
the ground that in 1872, seven years after
the war had closed, ""the south gave sublime
evidence of their anxiety TO blot out all
the bitter memories of the civil war and
TO inaugurate the reign Of fraternity when
they accepted HORACE GREELEY, the old
""leader of the abolition forces, to be their
candidate for the first Office in the gift Of
the people"" Such proposition at this
time is too innocent for an infant class Of
logicans. In that canvass the democrats
emerged from their demoniac schemes of
crushing ont the republican sentiment of
the south by the most barbarous methods
and crimes to bait tho democratic trap with
HORACE GREELEY, who had already given
himself away to the rebels and traitors by a
line of conduct entirely outside the rule of
republican propriety. He had forfeited the
confidence of the loyal sentiment of the
country by rushing hastily into the arms of
the debris of the rebellion to tender bail
for tho aroh traitor who had brought upon
the nation the flood of woe that had we'll
nigh overwhelmed it. That voluntary and
needless act on his part when there were
wealthy friends of DAVIS in the south who
could have become his guarantee not only
astonished but grieved the north and con
WINGED thinking loyal men that he had lost
his head, if not his republican heart. That
act on his part, however, paved the way to
democratic nomination, which he accepted
under heinsane idea that his republicanism
was to break the republican party in twain
and secure his election. The event
showed the mistake that he and
his new allies made in that ad-
venture The lines of the rank and
file of the republican party remained un-





verdict against his political recreancy in
more than $4,000 majority The north did
not bite at that bait, and poor GREELEY
was hurried into premature grave by fol
lowing the i'll advice Of n mistaken friend
ship. That act on the part of the south
was not in the interest of fraternity and
peace, but had for its purpose TO capture the
north by a decoy. That was what there
was of it. The deception was discovered
and the conspiracy was defeated.


The J'irginidn says again, with childlike
innocence ""The stalwart republicans will
""ship from the other section; these efforts
""of ours to shake hands across the bloody
""chasm.n We win say TO our cotemporary
in all franliness that we have understood
those overturcs perfectly, and for that Tea-
son the republicans have not trusted them,
As often as u hand has been extended to
them from the other side Of the bloody
chasm il has been rceling with the un-
dred blood of some republican whose
life had been taken by itas a forfeiture for
sustaining the republican laithin the south.
The mask of the ku klux, the murderous
rife of the night rider the shotgun Of the
bulldozer, were always behind the boody y
hand that has been extended to the north
and for that reason it has not been accepted
and il will not be and should not be until
il is purged Of the life-blood of murdered
republicans. Does the Tirgiaida see the
point, and has it the candor to recognize it
as we'll taken? 1t carefully avoids allusion
to or rebulSe Of the ouirages that have passed
into history, and which have been resorted
to to make the south solid for democracy
They form the barrier that has stood be-
tween the south and the north in the way

stitution as the democrat does, and as every
citizen does in Ohio, Pennsylvania ant
New York without terrorism, ostracism o.

will be allayed and the north aud soutl
can be friends but never before. This il

The more Tanlmany Frances and shakes its fist at

Davenport is interfering successfully with schemes
for ballot-box stnfing.


Think of this: In November. 1870, proposition
was made to General Hancock that lie accept
nomination for the Presidency a Greenback
ticket with an ex-Confederate. Did he treat the
proposition with contemptnous silence, or did he re-
ject it with indignations Neither one. Apparently
unmindful that he had been grossly lnsuted, he
wrote a very polite answer, saying he soldier
and could not express any opinions, and adding:
"" If were nominated by party | would be gov
erned by its platform or / would not accept its nomi-
natonu What did that meanf Blanton Duncan.
who received it, interpreted II to mean willing
ness 10 accept, for he mt once circulated IL as con
ilential document among his fellow Greenbackers.
and from that time to the present, when lie Is on
the stump for Hancock in Indiana, has been zeal
Gus disciple of Hancock. The Democratic papers
seem to interpret 1t in the same way, for they are
very careful not to print the correspondence.


General Butler is said 10 aspire to n Cabinet po-
sition. He would make a rattling change Secre-
tary of the Treasury.


An exhausting investigation of the Hancock Re-
publican Soldiers and Sailors Association III Phil
adelphIa has been made by a Necs reporter. The
Democrats have claimed a membership Of 1000,
composed entirely of men who have hitherto voted
only the Republican ticket. The reporter found
president and a treasurer, who said they had en-
rolled 1G7 name. The list couii not DE seen. but
the president and treasurer alter violent mental
wreuching, were able to mention two OF the names,
Lynch and West. They could do no more, neither
find first names for these worthless, nor tell IN wnat
regiments they had served. This removes the wind
from another Hancock boom.


1t is only few weeks since the Democrats were
claiming that Grant a Hancock Veteran. They
not doing SO any more.


It's estimated that at least half million of dol
lar, has been sent to Indiana by Democrats for the
purchase of votes. The voter who is III the market
viii be very stupid If he casts his vote before he
ceiyes his reward.


Circular No. 329' as given in yesterdays TRIB-
UNE, is appearing on the fences and bill-boards of

Solid south

tOn of Oulld0Zng


Hancock doubts if Grant said it all. Nobody else
does.


II seems that the Southern chivalry is not above
stealing We used to be told that nobody but carpet
Daggers stole ny'hing in tho South. An ex-
sheriff of Now-OreAns has been discovered 10 be
defaulter in the sum of b2J0,OO0. of which amount
the city will lose nc least 100000. AMI the State
of Louisiana the rest. The Democratic journals
charge that bis crime was known to the city and
l.
leading Democratic jonnal of Ncw-Orpans. The
Democrat says of thc case: "" AS all the facts in
the dcialcation OF the late civil Sheriff come to
light the pubic mind is puzzled to deter
nIne which Is the more criminal, the man who has,
with the hodncss Of a hiC.iwayman and the impu-
dence ef Boss Tweed, pocketed the peoples money,
or the pubc officials whose duty 1t was 10 guard
the peoples interests and protect them from rob
berry""


The Indiana voter who agrees to vote for Ian
ders Oh promise of pay after election will sell his
honor and whistle III VAIN for his reward.


An esteemed correspondent, of unqucstioned
veracity, sends tho following conversation, which
he calls request for change princpeD:

the Levy court. The next act In tn
Ipresrranged programme was for Lev!


C0urtman Wier to take the floor at {


nod from Mr.. Silver and commenc


reading the transfers Of property in th'


southern assessment district Of vii


mingt0n.


A merry twinkle Of Mr.. Wier's eye


was noticed as he stalled that he thought


it was good time now to read thu


transfers SO that the assessors need no


remain at New Castle longer at an ex


pense to the county. This remark drew


half concealed smiles from the members


of the Levy Court and other Democratic
lights in the court room, the evident OBJ


jsct of the reading Of the report being


to keep a hundred or more Republicans


in waiting from getting assessed. The


reading of the report occupied hal


hour after which motion by Mr.. Weli


to make the transfers was passed and


Mr.. Hughes, the assessor Of the South
ern District, was discharged from fur


ther attendance at the Court.


At this point in the proceedings Pur.


nell J. Lynch had no trouble in getting


the attention of the Court as a voucher


for Lambert B. Armstrong of Pencader


Hundred, whom he wished placed upon
the assessment. Mr.. Armstrong; name
was placed upon the assessment though
form Of questioning was gone through
with to avoid charge of paritiality.-
James L. Hawkins being on the watch
succeeded in getting the name Of
Edward Barney, Second Ward, placed
upon the assessment, after running a
rafting fire of cross questions.


Mr.. Ward, Assessor for the Northern
District of Wilmington watching his
opportunity got his list of property
transfers into the hands of Mr.. Wier
that it might be read. Mr.. Wier get
ting the floor was about to commeucs
reading the transfers, when Mr.. Silver
who sat Just in front Of him Was about
making motion to assess a colored
man who had handed him his voucher.
Mr.. Silver who with an injured air OF
innocence inquired ofPresident Bright
who had the floor, who Immediately
decided in favor of Mr.. Wier. Again
Mr.. w. thought it proper and right
that the tausters should be read as eMr.
Ward had already been in attendance
two days at the Court at great incon-
venience to himself and expense to the
county. Another smile passed around
amongst the members Of the court and
the Democratic luminaries. Mr.. Wier
commenced at 2. 10 p. M. to read the
transfers and finished at 3 P. M, when
the transfers were ordered to be made
and Mr.. Ward was discharged from
further attendance at the court.


The following assessments were then
made Isaac P. Carty, Fourth Ward;
Charles L. Smith, Fifth Ward; Frank
A. Mitchell, Fourth Ward; Henry 5.
Jenkins, Fifth Ward; Ahram R. Jen-
kins, Fifth; Charles Butcher, Second
George Harris, Second; Francis w.

son, Second, John Macy, Second; Sam

Sixth; George Shockley, Fourth; James

ond. Two colored persons applied for
sessment whose names were found 10
be already on the lists and of course
we're refused. Though no action was
taken during the day on the request of
Mr.. Bush through the committee of
business men from Wilmington the
matter was the subjsct of considerable
talk amongst the members of the court
and leaders of the Democratic party.


States Attorney General, Gray, who
is also attorney for the Levy Court is
in favor of the plan recommended by |
Mr.. Bush, of setting aside specific days |
u pom which citizens Of certain wards or |
Hundreds may appear and have their
names placed upon the assessment. 1t
Is also said that the plan is gaining |
favor with the members of the Court
who now begin to see that though they
may by certain Must fable actions to
preve t the assessment of large num-
bers of Republicans who are daily ap-
plying, the Republicans on the other
and crowd in such force that the mem
bers are constantly annoyed and the
business of the Court retarded. Besides
his there Is prevailing idea amongst
The members that, however, much they
nay despise the United States laws there
nay after all bs something in them
hat might make matters very un-
pleasant.


It is due to the court to say that in
40 instance have they yet positivelyre-
used to assess any persons entitled che
ew they do assess are divided between
vEite and black, the latter predomi-
lating, and yet the tactics pursued if
verse yered in and carried out must
in the disfranchisement of
arge numbers Of citizens who are los Il

ave their names placed upon the as
essment lists. !"

CRIME THAT HAS JUST BEEN MADE
PUBLIC.


DECATUR, Ca, May 3.-The most
cruel murder Of Miss Victoria Norris is
creating the most intense excitement
Her dead body has been found, and her
murderer is now in Jail, writhing in
terrible torture lest an angry and out
ragged public will break down the Jail
doors, drag him out and lynch him. Miss
Norris was an orphan and a respectable
young woman. Sue lived on farm in
the family of James Jolly. Her nearest
relatives lived 80 miles away, John
Weaver was her lover and they were
engaged To be married William
Weaver was married farmer near by,
and he too fell in love with Miss Norris.
So did Jolly. She became alarmed and
resolved TO 60 home TO escape the very
jealous AMI angry wife OF jolly, with
whom she lived. jolly and VIM.
Weaver consented to take her TO the
railroad station In a wagon. Her truck
was loaded up and they departed. That
was the last seen of the young woman.
Her relatives were informed by some
unknown person, who signed Miss
Norris name. that she had gone to At
lauta. Her friends tried To nnd her,
but could not, Finally jolly ran away
from home. Befor be went he burned
a trunk in q brush heap. The trunk
lock and bands corresponded TO those of
Miss Norris. jolly was arrested and
brought oack here to Jail.


On the way he confessed that he
knew all about the killing of Miss
Norris, though he did not do it himself.
He promised that he would show where
her body was buried. As soon as he
was carried to his old home, he took the
officer from the house where lie said the
bones OF the murdered woman could be
found. An excited crowd at once dug
into the ground and found the remains
of the girl A coroner's jury at once held
an inquest over them and returned a
verdict that Victoria Norris had come
TO her death at the hands of james
Jolly. The entire county was then wild
with excitment. 1t was expected that
the Jail wsuid be torn open and Jolly
lynched.


jolly lay in his cell night after night
in the most horrible agonies. When he
would drop into a feverish sleep he
wo1ld scream aud wake saying that he
had seen the murdered woman in his
dreams. He began to make confessions
soon after he was put in Jail and has
made dozen not two of which cores
pond. At first he said that he left Weaver
on the road with Miss Norris and after
being gone half an hour returned TO find
the girl dying. Weaver said he had
choked her TO death in his efforts to out
rage her. He and Weaver had hastily
buried the body aud afterward had re-
moved II to where IL was found. Soon
after jolly made this statement. Weaver
was admitted to bis cell. Jolly then fell
on his knees and denied every word of
what he had just uttered. He then said
that he had tried TO ravish the young
woman; in. efforts TO slude his grasp
shehad fallen backward out of the wagon
and broken her neck. He was frightened
and buried her body as quickly as
possible. He made still. another con-
fesson To the effect that he tried to out
ragged the girl and for fear she would ,ell
he bad killed her. He now denies this.
Last weak Weaver was tried for COM
plicity in the murder. The principal
witness against him was Jolly, whose
statements were SO contradictory that
the Court ordered Wesver's discharge.
Jolly now lies in De Kalb County jail
at Decatur six miles fIom Atlanta. He
appears to be in sgonies all the while
and fears that the outraged community
Will lynch him. He will be tried in
few weeks and il there should be any
defect Of evidence sufficient TO REQUIRE
his release, there is snothlng more certain
ihan that be will be the victim Of lynch
law."

Randolph began demanding hush money from
Simpson about something in connection witt

received in consideration of $1,000, release
from all further claims. Immediately, how.

He was released on bail this afternoon. Ran.

DEAD BODIES EXPOSED.


NEW YORK, April 3.-The vault of the Wes-
ley NJ. E. church caved in, exposing to view an
immense number of bodies, the rotted cofins
being broken by falling brick.


Twenty or twenty-five years ago, when the
age of sanitary reform began, the health au-
thorities caused the vaults to be closed and
their use abandoned. They were then full. 1t
was estimated that fully 5,O00 bodies had been
deposited in both.


As shelf after shelf rotted away and fell un-
der its CHASTITY burden, the collins were more
closely packed, the space at the top grew
larger and room was made for more shelves.
The topmost had reached the arch when
the entrances were sealed and earth was filled
in on top Again and again, in after years,
the rain made holes through the ground, and
at the old entrance the arch caved In but the
holes were stopped up and no more was thought
of it. big shed was built over the vaults IN
place of the smaller one that once stood be-
hind them, and fifteen or twenty tons of coal
were dumped in it. This great weight weak
ened the arches and they fell with crash.

The democrats are very much incensed
over the truthful and myincible character
of Senator CoNKLING's speech They can
not impcach his material statements or
dislodge his Arguments, but they seek their
revenge by indulging petty criticisms and
making mouths ut him. The Richmond
State is sadly disgruntlcd over the follow
ing extract:


In several southern states there is large
well'knowu, Ofteu.asCertained republican ma
iority, but all southern states alike, without
exception or doubt, are relied upon to count
on the democratic side and to score 13s elect
oral votes-laeking but AZ OF majority orall


Instead of adducing any proof TO over
turn this bare and truthful statement it
lodges that point and asks why he did not
tell about the ascertained democratic ma
jorities in Philadelphia and all that sort of
ribald nonsense, when there is no analogy
between them and the forcible and mur.
derous counting out under state sanction of
large republican maiorities in the southern
states by the shotgun and rihe-facts well
established in history 1t assumes that
there are frauds and ballot box stufiing Mt
the north equal to countorbalance the tissue
ballots and other frauds at The south, in
stead of impeaching his bold, fearless and
truthful statements based upon the unim-
peachable record of southern history during
the last ten years. Indeed its assumption
in regard to any extent of fraud and ballot
box stuling at the north beyond what may
be practiced by the democratic party is all
n failacy. The me thods of fraud and in.
timidation by rifle clubs, shotgun practice
lynching and murder for opinion sake have
never been introduced into the political
contests of the north to crush out either
republican or democratic sentiment Every
legal voter is permitted in the north ia
exercise his right of suffrage without him
drance or molestation. This is what the
republican party in the south has de.
manded, but il has been denied them, and
the State is not so ignorant MS not to know
this fact. The utterance of Senator CoNK.
| LING on this point is based in truth and
| fact and will withstand any measure of as
sault and ridicule that may be brought
against it. In view of the glaring light o.
irrefrdgable history which sustains and
| tortifes his position, it requires an unusual
amount of cheek even to cavil at his state
meuts while none are so brave MS to at
tempt TO dislodge them. We suppose tha
the reason why the southern press does no
remain silent under this exposure of tn
deepdyed villainies of the ""solid south
is that they fear the public mind woulC
regard silence as a confession of guilt, ant
hence they resort to dishonest cavil to mis-
lead and caiole, instead of bringing fortl
the proofs to overturn Senator CoHKLIYGl
statements in a manly and decent way."

Yesterday a number of sporting men from

to John Lynch's, just beyond the District line
in Maryland in the vicinity of the chain

the feathered combatants, and as Washing
ton won the previous main, tho homo cocks
wero by far tho favorites. Tho stakes were
S25 on each match and 500 for the main.

The Coroner started with the Jury to
go 10 room up stairs. As soon as he
was gone the crowd entered and hustled
the detective out of the way. A rope
was thrown over Snyder's neck, and he
was dragged and pushed to the door,

He answered: ""No, want to be

coolly, ""Oh, that's all right"" A double

Then a man mounted the tree and

they swung him up again. He showed
no fear and never asked for mercy. The
rope was made fast to the fence on the
other side Of the road and he was left
hanging for half an hour. When the
Coroner came down from the inquest
the body was still hanging to the tree
When District Attorney Anstett arrived
the body lay at the foot of the tree. No
information could be obtained as to the
lynchers. No arrests lave been made.
The Coroner's jury found that Jacob
and Anna Gogle came to their death
from blows inflicted with an axe In the
hands of Joseph Snyder.


THE VICTIMS.


Mr.. Gogle was a miner and worked in
The mines near his residence. He was
thirty-eight years old and his wife was
thirty-four. They were both natives Of
this county. The victims presented
horrible and sickening appearance.
Their skulls were crushed IL, the wounds
showing that the murderer had struck
them with the blade Of the axe. The
walls of the room and the bedclothes
were bespattered with blood.


THE MURDERER's COMPRESSION.


During the interval between the ar
rest of the murderer and the lynching he
told the following story:-''I wanted to

sTCKENING DETAILS.


The Coroner held an inquest upon the
body of Snyder this afternoon and rem
dered verdict to the effect that the
deceased came to his death by hanging
and that the parties who committed the
dead were to the jury unknown. 1t is
generally believed that the murderer
committed terrible outrage upon the
girl Alice after killing her parents
although she denies that he did so.


District Attorney Anstett visited the
seen this afternoon and at once COM
menced.. investigating the ease. He will,
if possible, bring the lynchers to justice.
The quick action off lynchers is COM
mended by large number of citizens of
Easton, while others Indignantly con-
denim it.


AN INNOVATION IN PENNSYLVANIA.


The hanging of Joseph Snyder is, ac-
cording to the Oldest police officers and
detectives the first case of lynching that
has ever occurred in this State."

HORRIBLE STORY OF BRUTAL PASSION


AND CRUELTY.",,"HORRIBLE STORY OF BRUTAL PASSION


AND CRUELTY.


EAsToN, Pa, Dec. 81, 1880.


Two crimes of the most terrible and
most sickening character, by which
three human beings have been de-
prived of existence, were committed
within the past twenty four hours at a
little settlement called Santee's Mills,
a few miles east of Easton. The story
is not pleasant one to read.


BRITISH Low


Joseph Snyder is a worker in the
Coleman Ore Mine, was about twenty
eight years of age, German by birth,
of muscular build and not bad looking.
He had lived for some time as board
or in the family of Mr.. Jacob Gogle, of
whose daughter, Alice, be became en-
amored. Alice was but fifteen years
old and her parents objected to her
acceptance of Snyder as a husband.
Thus there arose ill-fseling between
Snyder and Mr.. and Mrs. Gogle.


He bad frequently made advances
toward Alice, the prepossessing daugh
ter of Mr.. Gogle. The daughter had
complained to her parents of the ac-
tions of Snyder, and her father had
had several stormy Interviews with him
telling him that he must either leave
the house or stop at once his disagree
able attentions to his daughter. On
Saturday they had bitter quarrel, and
Snyder was told that he must pay his
board and leave the house. Yester-
day Sunday Snyder remained home
in cheerful mood, joining with the
children and two girl friends, who had
come from Farmersville, few miles
distant, to spend the night with them,
in in singing their Christmas anthems,
which they were practising for an en-
tertainment in which they were to lake
part in few days.


About eleven o'clock last night Sny-
der arose from his bed, and entering
in a nrde state the room where Mr..
and Mrs. Gogle were sleeping Drained
each of them with an axe. He then
sought the chamber Of the young girl
whom he had professed to love. With
her there were at the time girl named
Clara Young, who was paying her a
visit, and her younger sister, Mary.
Snyder here conducted himself in a
shameless and brutal manner, and the
terrified girls-two of them mere chill
dren-screamed at the top Of their
voices.


THE CHAMBER OF DEATH.


Clara and Mary, crying ""Murder p'
ran down stairs into the room of Mr..
and Mrs. Gogle and crouched, trem-
bling with fear, upon the foot of their
bed. Hearing no sound from the cou>
pie whom they supposed to. be there
the strange silence increased their
terror, and Miss Dung, hastily spring
ing to the floor, struck match upon
the wall. The scene which met their
gaze under the feeble rays of the match
was enough to freeze the blood OF
older and braver hearts. Mr.. and Mrs.
Gogle were there, but they were ap-
parently dead. The bed clothing and
even the wall were covered with blood.
Overcome, almost faint horror, the
girls gave only one glance, and then
tottered headlong from the room and
mounted the stairs screaming.


HOURS OF TERROR.


The murderer, bravely repulsed by
Alice Gogle, was still in her room; bul
when he heard the approach OF Clara
and Mary he savagely seized them, and,
pushing them into another room, locked
The door. They remained there for
some tilne shiyering with both cold and
terror. The murderer then went down
stairs and taking off his shirt burned 1t
int ha 1fn Tho uIrls Ad
in the second room for several hours un-
Ill they were almost dead with fright
aud suspense. Alice Gogle, looking
through pipe hole in the floor, saw the
murderer putting his shirt in the stove.
She asked him what he was doing, aud
he replied that 1t was not his shirt but
some shingles that he was burning. She
told him that she knew 1t was his shirt.


THE ALARM GIVEN.


Snyder now went out and alarmed the
neighbors, telling them that murder
had been committed at Gogle's house.
de did not appear excited or concerned
ia The least, but while the neighbors
we're assembling he took care TO aisap-
pear. This was about four O'Clock this
morning.


The excitement and confusion were
great, and little or nothing had yet been
done toward caring for the children or
looking for the murderer. Threats of
lynching were at once made contingent
upon the finding of the murderer.


With Snyder's disappearance from the
premises there also disappeared a four
barrel revolver, which was kept in an
empty cigar box on the window sill in
MIR. Geogle's bedroom. The revolver
was owned by Mr.. Geogle. Under the
direction of Detective Y Yohe,the country
was secured to find Snyder. Every foot
print was followed, and at length Yohe,
searching through the straw in Capt
Ritter's barn, caught the murderer by
the leg. He made no resistance, aud
the detective handcuffed him and took
him to the scene of the tragedy, followed
by large crowd OF persons, who yelled,
""Hang HIM hang himw ~ The missing
revolver was found on Snyder. At
about o:30 A. M. Corner Uhler drove
up to the house in sleigh. The pris-
oner was taken into the house and care
fully guarded by Detective Yohe with
revolver in hand. Threats of hanging
the prisoner were continuously made.

 Harry Dimond, IS years of age, who with his mother formerly lived in this city, nov ing from here on account of health about the time of the Philadelphia Centennial to San Jose, California, was shot perhaps fatally in San Jose recently by an assassin who, after shooting him, exclaimed, That is not the man intended to shoot"" Young Dimond was shot while returning home from a con- cert with two ladies, Mrs. and Miss Prince, friends of his mother. A police officer heard the shot and ran and found young Dimond lying on the ground, but the assassin had dis appeared. The wounded young man was conveyed to the residence of an Episcopal clergyman near by. Great sympathy was felt in the city in the case and great indig- nation excited. The physician found that a ghastly hole had been made just below the lower left rib by bullet of unusual size. The young man told the doctor about the shoot ing. Three shots were fired at him, but one taking effect Dimond knew of no possible cause for the crime. The widowed mother soon arrived almost fainting at the sight of her only son wounded and bleeding, and per haps mortally wounded.

 The city was again excited three or four evenings later by another attempted assassin ation. This time broker Mir. Boring, was shot at while going to church in the evening with his wife and another lady, The assas- sin as he fired exclaimed, 'eYour money or your life"" MT. Boring a muscular man. sprang forward, grappled with the assassin, and they fell and rolled in the street. During the scuf1e the pistol was discharged again Mir. Boring's foot slipped on stone and his man wriggled from his grasp and sprang away, firing as he did so full at MT. Boring, the ball passing close to his head. Still un- daunted, MT. Boring pursued. The ladies were frightened almost out of their senses, and Mrs. Boring tainted. Police whistles were blown, and hue and cry raised, and finally the would-be assassin was arrest ed. He was lodged in jail, but crowd came to lynch him, and hearing of their approach the authorities secretly removed him to a se- cure place. On being locked up, he com fessed that he was the man who shot young Dimond, and that he did it by mistake, and"

Special Correspondence of the REPUBLICAN,
New CASTLE, May 20.
Factional feeling never ran higher in
the Democratic party than II did TO-
day at the county meeting held here in
the Court House. The occasion was
nothing more or less tLan disgraoeful
riot, and, between the efforts Of some
politicians half-crazsd by excitement
and Of others wholly crazed by whisky,
the seat of justice, which was the scene
Of the smbroglio, was temporarily
changed into bowling bedlam Of the
most pronounced nature.


The recent Republican Convention at
DoVsr was not circumstance to il In
the way of discreditable tumult at the
State Convention the contssting parties,
who were men Of standing, fought fair.
lly and met foenen worthy Of their
steel at this, the Democrats Of all
grades and conditions met on common
level and wrangled in manner dis
creditable even to those who took part,
and carried things with the most mani.
fest unfairness.


| GETTING 1T STARTED.


Chairman Bright Of the County Ex-
eoutive Committee called the meeting
to order at o'clock. At that time few
Of the Wilmington crowd had arrived.
Temporary organization was sffested by
the selection of Mr.. Bright as chairman
and Joseph Roberts Of Appoquinimink
as Secretary. On motion Of Albert 0.
Newton Of Red Lion, the meeting ad-
ourned at 8 O'Clock to allow those pres
ent TO attend the funeral Of Mrs. Hattie
Gray, wife o: HoH: George Gray.


Before the clock struck three the
Wilmington gang had put in an ap-
pearanoe. Many of them came in the
cars, but number of impseunious bat
tervent members Of the party trudged
over afoot. The majority Of them were
drunk ty the time the meeting was to
re-assemble, and ripe for rufianly
row. At the stated time they surged
into the court room and James II. Ray
of Newark tslled the bell.
The confusion had not quisted down
before Thomas Mellon Of Wilmington
moved that II. c. Turner be chairmaa
Of the meeting.


A crowd, who belonged TO the Lynch
faction, shouted that this was cut Of
order, AID Mr.. Turner respectfully
declined.


Mr.. Bright here appeared and called
the meeting to order.


Mr.. Mellon, irrepressible and intoxi-
Gated, could not understand why Mr..
Turner could not be chairman, and
loudly nominated him again, and the
motion was again declared out of order
by the crowd with howl Of derision.


Thomas Bird moved the appointment
Of Committee on Permanent OEgani-
cation, by the chair. This was adopted,
bat Mr.. Mellon, angered at the lack
of attention paid his motion, proceeded
to violently demonstrate. His friends
checked him.


AFTER 1T WAS STARTED.


The chair appointed the committee
as follows:


Brandywine Hundred-H. NJ. Bar.
low.


Wilmington-H. E. Lannan, w. H.
Lee, Ignatius C. Grubb.


Christiana-Thomas J. Haman.


Mill Creek-Edward hammond.

Pencader-James Nicholson.


New Castle-A. H. Silver.


Red Lion-A. O. Newton.


st. Georges-Nsthaniel Williams.


Appoquinimink-J. s. VanDyke.


Blsckbird-Henry H. Wells.


The committee had not been half
announced before hoarse and spon- |
taneous murmsr of discomfort ran
through the crowded audience, and,
when the chair concluded a howl OF
indignation went up from the friends
of Thomas Ford and Martin Farrell.
The storm had burst on the convention
with violence, and before chairman
Bright had removed his iron bowed
speotacles, the room was the scene of
indescribabls confusion.


Dennis Gallagher, Eugene Lynch,
Thomas R. Lslly and half dozen men
Of that ilk were on their feet saving
the air with angry fists and demanding
what right the chair had to make such
appointments. Men on the other side
derisively jesred, and Enoch Moore, Jr.,
q Ford man, cried out for the whole
Wilmington delegation to leave the
To cap the climax the ire
pressible Mr.. Mellon vociferously re-
MIR. Turner for president,
and did 1t so persistently that that
gentleman mounted chair in despera-
tion and declined.


PERMANENTLY ORGANIZED.


Meanwhile the committee had rstir-
ed and, before the meeting had be-
come orderly, 1t re entered, and Mr..
Grubb reported the following perna-

troy Just gained by their opponents.


Mr.. Robert moved that 8 COMMITTEES


be appointed 10 choose an Executiv
Committee. This was adopted.
Samuel Townsend, snugly seated il
the Court crier's chair, moved tina
John C. Wilson be appointed from Ap
poquinimink. The chair said il had 1
right to appoint, and Mr.. Roberts, aftel
yelling that he bad intended to incor
porate that in his melton. moved t

Specially reported for the Gazette.


New CASTLE, Feb. 3.-The case o
State vs.. William Zeigler was on lria
to-day, when the report in the late edi
ion of the GAZETTE concluded. The
evidence for the prosecution went tC
show that Zieeler voted In both the east
aud west precincts of the Fifth Ward
The defense showed that Zeigler was
drunk at the time. The testimony ol
Edward Singles reached the fact that he
was q qualified voter In the cas- ern pre-
cinct Of the Fifth Ward. The defense
of intoxication was carried out to COLI
siderable leugth, and several witnesses
testified that lie was wildly drunk.


The evidence having been concluded,
Mr.. Gray argued with great force TO the
jury, claiming q verdict Of guilty from
he undoubted fact that Ziegtr did vote
in both the precincts Of the Fifth Ward,
and was surely not qualified voter Ia
the west precinct. When Mr.. Gray con-
cluded his address court took recess
until o'clock.


AFTERNOON SESSION.


Court reassembled at 3 o'clock.


Argument In the Zeigler case was re-
sumed, and Mr.. Sha pley spoke In favor
Of the prisoner. He did not claim that
the prisoner had not voted, and did not
hold that the vote was legal, but IL was
clear that he was not responsible for
what he did; but, being very much in
toxicated, he was made the tool Of 9TH
ers who pushed him up to the window
where he cast his vote, not knowing, ~
reality, what he did. A man in such a
condition could not justly be held re-
sponsible.


Mr.. Gray In closing, said that no mat
ter how much excited the prisoner was
from liquor, he must suffer the c0Dse-
queues Of his act, the law not making
drunkenness an excuse for crime.


Chief Justice Comegys charged the
jury, calling attention TO the fact that the
principal allegations IN the case were
admitted by the defendants counsel but
a plea Of Iptoxication was set up, and q
claim made that the prisoner did not
know what he was doing. One fact Ia
stated in the evidence, aud that Is that
when asked at the polls where he lived
he replied that his father had driven him
from home and he now lived in that pre-
cinct. II the jury believes he knew What
he was saylrg it is quite reasonable t.
suppose that he was not so badly intoxi.
Gated. The Court went on at consider
able length, and particularly impressed
upon the jury the fact that drunkenness:
was no excuse for crime, unless the nc
cused was so much intoxicated that ht
did not know what he was doing.


The case went to the jury at 1885,
O'Clock, and at 4.15 verdict of guilty
was returned.


Ziegler was sentenced 10 pay fine o.
$50 and the costs Of the prosecution.
State VS.. John Dolan, for being, as po-
liceman, within thirty feet of the polls al
election; Wbiteley aud Sharpley for de-
Tense, Gray for State. The indictment
was found under the act of the Revised
Code, making 1t a misdemeanor for po
liceinan to be within 30 feet Of the poll'
on election day.


The State examined Daniel +. Stew
art, distributing clerk at. the Post Office
and Philip Lynch. The witnesses fol
the defense were James Magfaw, Elec
tion Inspector; John Mulhn, Assistant
Inspector; Patrick Neary, David w
Hughes and DAVID +. Finley. All thes,
witnesses were about the Tenth ware
polls ON election day, and all testified Il
seeing Sergeant John Dolan about IL
feet away. The substance of the evi-
dence was as follows:


The voting place was at Pleasant ant
Jackson streets. In the evening maj
giving his name as Thomas j. Webl
came up and offered 10 vote. The Re
publicans objected to the vote and sal,
he did not live in the Ward. He reptile,
warmly, saying the other side wer'
ssdamned liars"" and other warm word
of similar nature passed between boil
parties, while the whole crowd ran VI
70 the window, and shouted loudly al,
waved their arms. This lasted som'
time, and while 1t was going on, Mr.
Stewart, heard Sergeant Dolan say
""Mr. Inspector either take or reject tina
vote"" MIR. Stewart turned aud saw
Dolan standing near and said he had NJ
business so close TO the polls. Mr.
Stewart and Mr.. Lynch both testified
that they did not think the demonstra
lion made around the polls amounted Il
breach Of the peace; but Messrs
Neary, Finley and Hughes thought i
was a breach of the peace aud might hav'
led to a serious disturbance. The whol'
weight Of the evidence indicated that thu
accused was near the polls in the capa
city of policeman, and was only ther'
| during the disturbance. The case wa,
| .uhmIttad WlthouI nrpumeut and a yer
dict OF not guilty was retnrned. In tn
illegal voting case of Owen Hannum
nOile proseQui was entered. Andrew
Glubb pleaded guilty to selling liquor OF
Sunday and was fined $50 and costs
Charles Dorshiel pleaded guilty to sell


ing liquor without lict nse and was tinr'

Pursuing bis prosecutions, Il is stated
that Mitchell next obtained from The

When the old man died, bis dangh-
ter, as sole heir. inherited the Planta-

content with his spolls, Mitchell appears
TO have determined to possess himself

he induced one j. G.. Walton, Justice
OF the peace, to visit the young woman
and take her deed on the plantation, in
which William E. Glass, who bad wit
messed The former pretended confession
of Miss Robinson, was made trustee and
representative of Mitchell in the trans

that Walton brought her threatening

Miss Robinson, badgsred al last be-

and the parties arrested. Intense ex-

Il lboutIsIx years ago q youth named
81 sse Z. Mitchell, while at work near
= e residence Of a man named Robin
eyon, in the neighborhood referred TO,
hurt himself badly with saw, and was
removed to the house TO be properly
cared fOr. Michel received at the hands
Of the family the utmost kindness and
attention, so much. so that an time he
recovered from his injuries, though he
ever alterward suffered from certain
Iameness. The family in which he
found such timely and eFectual refuge
consisted Of old Mr.. Robinson and his
wife, his son, Thomas I. Robinson, and
his daughter, Miss Lizzie May Robin
sou, the latter an amiable and attractive
young lady. Between Michel and this
young person, who had been specially
kind to him during his illness, very in
tImate relations ensued, as was natural
on the strength oftheir association and
the sympathy which she manifested for
his suferings. 3


For some reason, however, an es-
trangement between the guest and hIs
hosts soon followed, and Michel vas
forbidden the house by Mr.. Robinson;
Mitchell also got into squared With young
Robinson, the fruits Of which W were AFTER
ward fatal to one and nearly so to both
OF them; but at the time it appeared 10
blow entirely away. Robinson, more
over, about this time became involved
in scandal about young woman OF
the county, and was arrested with a
view 20 his criminal prosecution. While
he was IN the custody Of the officers of
the law he effected bis escape by the
aid, il Is SAID. OF his sister. and so made
his way to Texas. Mitchell then be-
gan a system of espionage and persecu-
lion, of which Miss Robinson was the
helpless victim, practising on her fears
in thousand ways, and threatening her
with disgrace and exposure of kind
most revolving TO the sensibilities OF a
modest and innocent girl.


He IS said TO have threatened to de-
liver her to the authorities on account
of her alledged connection with the es-
cape OF her brother from the constable,
alleging that she had committed felo-
nv in so dong. for which she could be
subjected to the most severe punish
ment. II is said that he also accused
her OF more Asgrant offence, pretend
ing that she was the mother of babe
born out of wedIock, and intimat;ng his
intention of exposing her shame TO the
public and fixing upon her stigma Of
ineHaceabIe disgrace. While these
things were going on the following pos
tal card was addressed to Mitchell by
the brother Of the persecuted and IN
happy girl: -


""EL PAso, March, 1874.


'.Dare to harm a hair Of any one who
Is OF my blood, you cowardly dog, and
I will have your life If il be twenty

protected woman now, but you are lay

moved no doubt by the reports that still
reached him Of MicheII's proceedings,
came to Virginia, and on reaching home
found that Mitchell was on the premi-
ses. Mitchell attempted to retreat from
the wrath Of the brother, well knowing
that wherever they met one or both
was destined to bite the dast. And 30
Il proved. Young Robinson followed
Mitchell and opened FIRE, striking him
In the side, and receiving al the same
time ball from MitcheIl's pistol, in
the abdomen. Mitchell fell and was
thought 70 be mortaIly wounded, bat to
make sure Of killing him Robinson

the case in regard to garbage, as this

mt report of Mr.. Bsrrows, United States
consul at Dublin, to Secretary Evarts, l find
hat in one year the small holdings, spoken
If, have decreased and the large ones in-
creased. There has been nine per cent.
decrease in horses, in cows and per cent.
in all other animals. In the past year 10000
acres have gone out of cultivation, and there
are now over 100000 acres waste, ,OOO, ,OOo
Of which government surveyors say can be
reclaimed. One thousand nine hundred and
forty three men own two-thirds of Ireland,
300 persons own 100000, while twelve
persons own 1927 1888 acres, and five million
people do not own an acre. In 1900, when
Ireland had her own parliament and over
eight million population, the rental was |
f4 600, 900; in 1879, with only population |
of five and quarter millions, the rent roll
is f14 100000 In 1900 the alien landlords
were residents, and spent their money i'll the |
country; now they are non-residents, and
five si1ths of the rents are sent out of the I
country without any return whatever.


The annual wheat revenue of Minnesota is
$50, ,OO0,000: and now let us imagine its con-
dition if the farmers were forced to send
1928, ,OOO, 900 of it to few men in New York,
who sent back nothing in return. At True
Friends figures as to the number of acres
productive, and the government valuation of
thirteen shillings per acre, the tenant
farmers pay for the land in rent every
seven years. Parnel proposes to estab-
lish q peasant proprietary on q rental
purchase from ten to thirty years, and
yet True-friend declares it an impossibility.
But here are more figures: During the last
week of November past, 10000 animals, 49,
OOO, 600 pounds of meat were shipped from
Ireland TO England. Millions of pounds of


meat and breadstuffs are being shipped to


feed England, and the money received for it


to pay the rents, in turn leaves the country.


When short crops occur in France, Austria,


Germany or Russia the government prohibits


expectation, the preservation of its people
being its first duty, but England has not pity
for the Irish people. She must have all the
fat bullocks, hogs and sheep, wheat, pota-
toes, butter and cheese they can raise, and if
famine stares them in the face let them emf
CRATE or appeal to their friends in America
for food. Eminent political economists say
that the land of Ireland is capable of sup


porting population of 100000, yet with
one third that number thousands are starv-


ing, and charge it to the bad laws and bad


landlords, propped up by the strong arm of


England. He says that excessive rents are


dus entirely to the greed of the people for


the land, in outbidding one another, and
even going SO far as to bribe the whole
| household of the landlord in order to secure


the holdings for rent. If this


we're true it only proves the base injustice of
the system that keeps the door wide open
| for vice, greed, avsrice and dishonesty.


Having thus slsndered the whole people of


Ireland he next pays his attention to the old
Celtic families for whom he has particular


dislike. He say:


1T is somewhat strange that the greatest dis
| tress always existed in that part of Ireland to
which it is said Oliver Cromwell gave the
Celtic chiefs the choice of going to, or to
| hell, viz: West Cork, Kerry and Connaught,
| and where the majority of the land Is still
| owned by gentlemen who rejoice in such Celtic

| aid, MoMaho', Burke, B AXE Bedkin, McGuin
ness, O'hlahony, ETC., etc., while from the
| provinces of Leinster, and Ulster, which are
owned by the descendants of the early English
settlers comes no report of dire distress""


l pronounce this statement a compound
| lie and villainous SANDER. The Celts took
CromwelPs advice and went to Gonna ught,


aud he went to the other place, bat while
| they fled to the mountains of West Cork.


and Kerry, and the wilds of Connemara, the
| English took care to vest the ownership OF
these mountain countries in few favored


'scum of the English nation"" The queen
has dubbed her son Duke of Connaught, in


the vain hope that he won't prove a prince
of the other place. A few months ago
he visited his dukedom and
pronounced it splendid country
| to hunt in, and right away the funkies


started shilling head testimonial for him


in order that the starving people might have


an opportunity to propitiate royalty. Ten OF


the above list of Celtic names are not Celts


at all, but Anglo Norman, and the majority


of the lands in the west of Ireland are not


owned by Celtic gentlemen. AS an instance


one of the largest landowners in Galway is


the Earl Clanoarty, who is not q MacC1rthy


at all, bat is French, whose grandfather, Mr.


Dick French, married into the family of tt


t-throat Castlereaghs, got seat in parlia-


ment, voted for the Union, sold the liberties


of the country, and like the ass in the lions


skin, was permitted to clothe himself with
the honored title borne by those he had


helped to despoil. So also is the prese nj


possessor of Shane's castle, and the broad


acres of Tyrone, not an ONeill, but Chi


chester, who in 1868 Her Majesty granted


the right to bear the ancient nam and title


Lord O'Neill. They are only two of the


very many cases of the same kind, but God


forbid that thu old Celtic race of Ireland


should be held responsible for the acts of


such land and title robbers.


have before me the report of the local


government board, wherein l find that on


the 4th October, 1879, there was relieved in
the warehouses; as follows: Ulster, 1O,26l,


Munster, II, 1866, Leinster, 1875, and Con

has been 2 per cent. greater in Ulster than
the other provinces, and in the whole coun-

states that ''there is general failure of the


crops except in parts of Donegal and Lon


donderry in Ulster, parts of Cork and Linn


erick in Munster, and parts of Wicklow in


Leinster,"" so that Connaught, where Crom-

of crops, has only 5,4SO in the warehouses,

The wheel struck him near the shoulder and ran the entire length of the arm, manglingit terribly. Assistant Baggage master Lynch, who saw the accident, had rushed to the spot and stood waiting an op- portunity to rescue the unfortunate man from his perilous position. After the second set of trucks passed he seized MT. Gillick by the collar and dragged him away from the train. He was then placed in an express wagon and taken to his residence, where Doctors Hub bard and Porter attended him. His arm was smashed the whole length, and he had seri- ous bruise on the head, besides other contu- sions. The arm was amputated Monday night. Yesterday morning he was as com fortable as could be hoped for, and may recov- CT, although the fact that he is seventy-eight years old lessens his chances very materially. MT. Gillick has quite history in connection with the Hausatonic road. He had been in the company's employ for over forty years, and was one of the first to use 8 shovel when the line was built. He was also the first man that ever turned railroad switch in Bridge port For over thirty years he has been em- ployed as switchman about the Housatonic yard and other localities in Bridgeport, and for ten or twelve years has had charge of the two Housatonic switches at the depot. He is well liked among his fellow workmen, and has been in the habit of attending to his religious duties with great punctuality, giving as 8 reason that he did not know how soon he might be killed."

last evening, which was largely ATTENDED
and highly enjoyed, if applause is to bt
| taken into consideration. The pro
gramme was one of unusual excellence
and the singing was above mediocrity
Part first of the programme opened witt
Ian overture by Ellinger's orchestra, en-
t'ltled ""Diadem"" from Hermann. II
was followed with cherus by the S@n-
gerband, entitled, ""How Have Loved
Her."" A duet, ""The Swallows"" sung
by d. Maier and c. Yetter, was well
rendered, both of the gentlemen having
good voices. A Either solo, by w.
Bailey, was highly enjoyed. A quar-
tette composed of Messrs. Fuekel, Stab,
Stuhlfeld and Miller, sang ""Joy and
Honor"" Part first closed with chorus
entitled, ""Deep Night"" by the Bund,
and it was certainly the best piece of
singing during the evening as a chorus.


An overture from Bellini. entitled
""The Turkeys in Italy"" by Elllnger's
orchestra, opened part seeond. 1t was q
very pretty piece OF music, and the Or
chestra did it full justice. A chorus,
""Leaving the Harbor,"" was next sung
by the Bund. 81 would that my
Love-"" duet by Messrs. Freye
and Yetter, was well sung
Both of the getleman have culti-
waited voices, which fact made their
singing the more enjoyable. The
musical exercises closed with a trio,
by the Misses Werle and F. We'll, Jr.,
and chorus entitled ""The Philister."" !""


At the conclusion of the concert,
dancing was commenced and CON-
tinued until early morning. The affair
was one of the most pleasant that has
taken place in this city for some time,
and was conducted in true German
style, consequently the best of humor
prevailed, and no disturbances oc-
Cured to mar the pleasure of any one
present.

 James McMahon, Joseph Lynch, James Moran and Thomas Reilly, the river pirates who boarded the schooner Victor off College Point, were this morning indicted by the grand jury for felonious assault, also for burglary in the third degree. All four of them pleaded guilty to both indictments and were sentenced to the State prison for ten years each.

 Hugh Gardner, who was once @ police commissioner and convicted of misdemeanor on technical point of law in connection with an election case, was nominated to-day in place of Dewitt c. Wheeler. The nomination was rejected. Joel W. Mansfield was immedi- ately nominated for the place and the nomina- tion was laid on the table. The resolution indicates Tilden's desire to get possession of the police board and Conklings ability to maintain working relations with Tammany."

 SAN FRANCISCO, July ""Details of the Sand Lot meeting Sunday evening state that the crowd generally deserted Kearney's stand to hear the exposure of Kearney by Wellock. The latter was terribly bitter, designating his former chief as an iron jawed hoodlum, whose tombstone would be written Liar, coward and trait or"" The cheers which followed this language were loud and long. Wellock af- irmed that Kearney had property at Marble head, Mass, to the amount of $6O, GOO, which he had accumulated while pretending to the worHngmen that he was poor. He told the agitator that he would bury him so deep that GabriePs trumpet would never wake him up. The crowd then sur rounded Kearney and drowned his voice with cheers and hootings, and he was escorted off by the police to prevent his being lynched."

Drubbing.",,"Drubbing.


Not over 1o0O people were on tho grounds corner
of sixteenth and s streets northwest, yesterday
afternoon 10 witness tho first championship con-
test in this city between the National and Balti-
more clubs 1t Is evident that the announcement
made some time ago that tho Baltlmores at home
had raised the price of admission to thoir grounds
TO fifty cents created the impression abroad that
the same thing had been done here. Several per.
sous inquired ut the ticket "" indow IL such an in
crease had been made, and seemed very much
gratied on being informed to the contrary. In the
opening OF the season the Nationals established
their scale Of prlees--general admission being
these figures until the season closes. Therefore,
1t is only necessary TO say that the public need not
believe any OF the ruinOrs IN regard 10 increasing
the admission fee.


Tho game yesterday was very interesting and
demonstrated that the BaltimoreS were tough Gus
toners to handle, and 1t was only owing TO the
superior batting Of the home club that they were
enabled 10 carry OF the honorS. In the second
innings the Nationals obtained and earned one
run but from that point out to the seventh innings
so sharp was the fielding that both sides were un-
able TO score. III tho seventh innings Lynch start
cd the music, and barring ont Mcclellan and
Derby. the rest of the nine Kept the Baltilnores
dancing to the time until four earned runs were
scored Seven safe hits Powell with o two bascr,
followed each other in rapid succession, and when
Mcclellan came to the bat the second time and
put the side out he left three men on the bases.
From that tiino 10 the close of the game the Ma
tonals did no more run.gotlng In the eighth
innings Richmond got in a thrce.bGSer, AMI did
some tall encrcirg of the bases for man that got
hit severely In the groin IN the innings previous,
as he did but he remained ut that base rs Burchel
put the side out Hlwes, who he'd reached frs; on
Il safe hit sent home by the long drive of Rich
mond, giving Baltimore Gn eurhed run, and the
only one they got during the game,


Lynch pitched beautifully, and was more effective
and steady than lie has been for some time pnsL
Only three errors wero made in the nfeld. Powell
getting two and Snyder one. GerhRr1t played q
brilliant game, evidently trying TO rest Derby and
Baker as much 0S possible, and did much of their
iclding. Warner and Mcclellan were faultlcss in
their work. The former did some good service at
tho bat aud It is pleasure TO that he Is finding
out how to hit the ball safe. Mansoll, the new man.
had but one iy-ball and gathered 1t in. He was
loss fortunate with groundor.


ON the other side Richmond eXcellcd, but
Bronlhcrs aided him materially in doing the good
service. Deasloy caught fine game. aud has i'm.
proved very much since last year. The Nationals
hit long balls, and as consequence the outtleld
of the naltimores had an abundance to do, and
with one exception gobbcd everything they got
their hands on. Their batting was rather light
and out of BaltimOr9's six hits Richmond got
three.


Mr.. Ebon Kpp umplrad, and MS thore was no
fault finding he Is believed to have given general
satisfaction. There Is no doubt but that he was a
great improvement on sOno OF tho stock recently
Imported here and the clubs might go further and
fare worse,


Strange as It may appear the six runs made in
the game were earned, and although errors crepl
in st they did not affect :ho final score which Is

The game of ball between the Albany and
National clubs yesterday presented two Ica-
tures-good batting and abundant errors
Neither side enjoyed much advantage over
the other In either respect. In The fourth
innings. Lynch. who had u lame arm, and Sny-
dor sore hand. gave away to Derby and Ba-
ker who filed the pitchers and caicher's po-
sitions to the end of the game The change
was good one. and worked admirably. In
tho eighth innings, when the score was tied,
the Albanys succeeded in working man to
the third and second base. Then Derby
did as fine a piece of pitching aud Baker
catching us has ever been seen on these
grounds. IIo succeeded in striking both Pike
aud Tohin out, aud Farrell hit an easy ball to
short stop that everybody thought would close
the innings for blank, but to the surprise Of
the spectators and doubtless Mcclellan him
self, he let the hall pass between his legs aud
two runs were scored, aided by n tumble of
tho ball by Snyder in the ccntro field. by
hits aud errors the Nationals again tied the
score in the ninth innings and darkness pre-
vented continuation of the game.

Mr.. Lynch--It was understood by

Mr.. Lally reiterated the contract be-

he would vote for the motion.

wanted it postponed. As the matter
stood the Board could not draw 1t from

Mr.. Baird.-How then can IL draw 1t
for the use Of Council.


Mr.. Morrow strongly urged the adop-
ton Of the motion, saying school taxes
were raised not only for school but for
city purposes.


Mr.. Baird advanced the idea of having
$4,000 remain, and have Council deduct
1t from the appr priaiion.


Mr.. Kenny rebuked DIR. Grimshaw for
calling the question political matter it
was untrue. Mr.. Baird was In favor Of
deducting the amount from the appro<
priations why did he not do that when
the amount was asked for? 1t was the
duty OF the Board to return tho money.


DIR. Grimshaw, forgetting the previous
charge he had made of ""pohtical maneu-

denial Of politics into charge that he
(Dr. Grimshaw,) was taking a political
stand, roundly berated that mem Der, say
ing IL was shameful to maze such a
charge here.


Mr.. Heisler said that he had told the
members that this money was in bank
and for them 10 ask for a lower appro-
priation accordingly, but he had then
been laughed at. He moved to postpone
and the motion was adopted.


The Board then adjourned."

as follows


Your COMMITTEE on Teachers report
that they have filled the vacancy In No.
o by transferring Miss ella L. Todd, of
No. Il, to this vacancy; that they have
promoted Miss Annie p. Nichols and
Miss Annie B. McCloskey each one place

mended that one room in No. 4, now
occupied by boys, be allotted to the girls
TO be transferred 10 grammar schools.
The communication was transferred to
the Committee on Thransfers.


Mr.. Kent said that In his opinion the
only plan to Obviate this difficulty could
be to grade the pupils In the four lower
grades Of grammar schools, without re
gard TO sex, as is done now in the pri-
mary schools, aud promote them accord
ingly. He said that while this year there
were vacancirs In the boys schools, next
year they might exist in the girls
schools. Therefore the only way to reg
ulate the matter was TO unite the sexes
ia the schools, when all the seats could
be utilized without trouble.


On motion OF Mr.. Kenney, Louis p.
Lynch, member-elect from the Tenth
Ward (uice ID. J. Mention, resigned) was
sworn IN and took his seat. lie was ap-
pointed member of the committee OH

tional rooms In school No. 13, at a rental
Of $3.50 per annum each, which was laid

The Superintendent, by request, ST ated
that there were so applicants at No. 8,
80 at No. 7, 30 at No. 8, and 20 at No.
8, and that another room in No. l3 could

vices Of clerk at the end Of each month
and at the close Of examinations in jan
uary aud July, to assist in making out
averages, &c, at an expense not exceed
ing $50 per year. On motion of Mr..
Baird, the resolution was laid over un-
I'll next meeting.


On motion of Mr.. Palmer, the Print
ing Committee was authorized to have
six sets of questions printed at a cost not
exceeding $3.50.


The Superintendent's m onthly report
OF absence Of teachers showed that DUR
ing December teachers were absent 261
days on account Of other causes.


Mr.. Conrad presented q gas bill OF
S9.4 for school No. /. and DIR. Grim
shaw moved that no further gas bills for
this school be paid. He claimed that the

repair the stoves in that school.
Mr.. Morrow stated thst by the report
of tho Treasurer there was balance In
bank of So, 900, out OF whiah the Board
had only its December bills to pay. He
therefore moved that the proper officeri
be instructed to draw An order for the
balance, about So 900 In favor of the
Mayor and Council of Wilmington.
Mr.. Kent inquired W h: idea was IL
view tor the Board to pay this money tt
the City Council; IL was certainly wrong
to thus appropriate the money raised BY
school taxes.


| Mr.. Kenny-The Board promised t.
the members of the City Council, wheI
was agreed to pay the Boards funds il
monthly installments, to return all sur
plus funds that might be on hand at .h'
close OF the year. He went on to stat,
that during the year 800 900 hal beeI

 Caucus of the FafthfuI-P1enty of Tim

 Der and Some Hay Out-The Uncer- ! tainty of Politics and Two Local Chief

 tainS-A Card from Waler-F4e Also De-

 c1ines.

 Considerable interest was excited about town, both in Democratic and Republican

 circles, yesterday afternoon, in reference to the authoritative announcement, which was

 broken to leaders in this city yesterday, that 1 ex-Governor R. D. Hubbard positively and finally declined to enter the field for guber material honors. This evening the Democrat

 ic chiefs from all parts of the State will be

 assembled in this city, and in their prelimi nary caucus will fight the battle to decide

 who shall be the party standard bearer in the coming campaign. Now that Hubbard is out

 of the race, the names of ex-Governor Eng l lish Waller of New London, Loomis of New London, Hovey of Norwich, and ex-Judge Seymour are uppermost in the party circles The Register has strongly urged Hubbard's name as the one to head the ticket, and says

 his declination to serve cannot but be regard 1 ed as unfortunate and throws the party into an unexpected state of affairs, with 8 State

 ticketto benominated in less than forty-eight | hours. It adds ''It is easy to name men | who will be splendid candidates and who can | easily be elected English and Pond (of l Hartford) would be a very strong ticket. | Seymour and Waller would make 8 fine run.

 Wheeler (Nathaniel, of Bridgeport) and Judge Morris, of New Haven, would be good

 candidates. Whether any of these gentle 1 men would consent to be candidates is an- | other matter"" Considerable doubt is ex- 1 pressed in Democratic circles as to MT. Eng fish permitting the use of his name ! for the office; and Waller, of New Lon | don, friends of his indignantly de- | clare would refuse to be shelved with nomination for second place. But a l complication ensues with Loomis' friends if 1 the name of the handsome and talented Wal l Ter is put forward for the first place, and New London Democrats are divided between Loonis and Waller, to say nothing of 8 simi- l lar state of affairs imminent in this city on the same subject. Judge Hovey, of Nor l wich, is mentioned"" in this city quite strongly by some who are quite power in party matters. The party leaders are, as in | dicated above, in quandary, and they are

  ters fully to night for the convention to- 1 morrow if they have to make an all nights task of it. Harmony is an article the Demo- cratic leaders have been particularly anxious for this campaign, and thus far they seem to think they have gained that point as regards local issues, but they are painfully aware and admit that ""white man is very unsartin. 7"" Tonight A. E. Burr, Waller, Cleveland, Wheeler of Bridgeport, Loomis of New Lon don, Gallagher, probably Judge Hovey and the great central controlling figure of the Democracy of the State, ex-Senator William H. Barnum, and other party magnates, in cluding those in this city, expected to be in council at the New Baven House, while the corps of lesser lights or satellites includes many of both the old hunkers and the young Democracy. The popularity of the Bigelow and Bulkeley ticket stirs up the Democracy considerably, and there is music in the air, and if the present impending campaign is not to be lively one then all political signs fail. A little interest is excited over the contest for the Democratic nomination for Senatorial honors and particularly over recent develop 1 ments. The story as related is that Mir. J. D.. Plunkett orated to the Hamden Democrats so ] successfully as to capture them, and came home in excellent spirits with the Hamden ! Senatorial delegation in his pocket. Now, as is well known in this great city, the friends of MT. Mills are many and able, and he is neck and neck in. the Senatorial race with his competitor, the graceful and artistic Plunkett. But Hamden being pocketed by Plunkett, more scaIps for Mills were needed as an off, set. The genial Mills now went on short vacation to Woodbridge, admiring the great natural beauties of the town and finding the way to the hearts of the Woodbridge faithful The result was spells. Mir. Mills, the story l runs, came back with the Woodbridge delega- tion in his pockets. But some magician seems to have potent influence in Democratic cir cles on the hills of Woodbridge and the plains of Hamden, and the upshot is that caucus of Woodbridge and Hamden Democrats was

 held Saturday evening and both delegations went over to Gilbert Benham, of Hamden. And now, if the sting of ingratitude is painful, surely the Hamden and Woodbridge Demo- crats must be in frame of mind, but both candidates have girded their Joins, finding new towns to conquer.

 Waller Also Declines to be Candidate. The Hon. Thomas M. Waller also declines, as appears by the following personal card in last evenings New London Telegram: NEW LONDON, August Is, 1880.

 AS one result of the speeches of Brown and other Democratic Senators upon the bill for pensioning Confederate soldiers who had fought in the Mexican war, Robert Hanna, Confederate soldier who did not not fight in the Mexican war, seems to have grown hope ful of compensation for his sufferings for the Confederacy, and has sent to the Pension bureau an application for pension In this application is the following

 am the identical Robert Hanna who was enrolled on the tn day of August, 1861, in Company G of the Fifteenth regiment of South Carolina, Confederate States of Amerl- ca, commanded by Captain McCutchen, and was honorably discharged at Lynchburg, Va, on the 5th of February, 1865, and my age is now 3S years. While in the service aforesaid, and in the line of my duty, received the fol lowing disability, to wit: l claim a pension on account of a wound of my right arm, re- ceived October 19, 1864, which caused the arm to be amputated at the shoulder, and am seriously disabled thereby. was treated at Lynchburg Hospital. I have never been employed in the military or naval service of the United States. Since leaving the Con- federate service have resided in South Caro- lima, and my occupation has been that of a stock herder. Before my entry into the ser vice aforesaid, was of good, sound physical health, being at the time farmer, and am now very much disabled from obtaining my subsistence by manual labor by reason of my disability above stated, and I make this dec laration for the purpose of being placed upon the invalid pension roll of the United States. hereby appoint and empower with full power of substitution, Nathan W. Fitzgerald, of Washington, D. C., my true and lawful at torney to prosecute my claim. My postofhce address is Graham Cross Roads, County of Williamsburg, State of South Carolina.

 Mir Hanna is in too much of hurry. The party which will give him pension, if he ever gets one, has not yet the power to do it, and his premature application will not help his case A large majority of the people of the North still continue to draw the line at the payment of Southern war claims and pensions to Confederate soldiers."

he could summon when they attempted to
bring him out, but recognizing the fact that
he would soon be ovcrpowered his courage
failed him, aud he appeared terror.strckcn.
Bailey had been twice condemned to death by
jury, but succeeded each timo In obtaining
new trial. The mob at one time attempted
to get him out Of the Jail to lynch him, but he
was stoutly defended by the sheriff, who was
forced to take him to the tower Of tho court
house aud threaten the mob with shotguns in
order to save him. On another occasion mob
took him from the Jail, carried him some dis
tanoo from tho town aud had him under the
halter, when he was rescued by few men,
who, with cooked revolvers, defcd the mob
and took him back to jail. Tho murder of his
wife was unprovoked."""

to our article on this subject is Characteristic.
Though very lengthy, it may be eptomized
thus: The republican party will never ac-
cept the professions of the southern people
or regard them as loyal to the union until
they accept the rule Of the republican party,
ii. C., become members Of that political or
ganization and thereby make it dominant in
every southern state. That is the only pro.
fession that can purge them Of ""the infamous
crime of rebellion""


The Lynchburg Virgiaidn ought not to
indulge in such statements as the above, for
they may lead us to change our mind as to
its truthfulness if kept up in this tone.
We have no quarrel with a democrat for
being SUCH 1t is the right of q citizen to
be what he pleases politically. The rebels
were all democrats when they went into the
war to destroy the government, and we do
not expect them TO change their natures
and instincts politically. But what we had
q right to expect Of them was that when
they pretended to surrender to the govern
ment that they should manifest their good
faith by respecting its constitution and the
laws TO which they surrendered or pre-





done in all or in majority of the states
that were in rebellion. In five of those
states the amendments to the constitution
which guarantee to every citizen, be he
white or black, republican or democrat,
the right of ofopinion the right Of suffrage
aud the right of being without molestation
or interference from any one are openly
and delantly trampled under foot. This is
what we object to and correction Of this
practice is what we demand. This is
what the democrats in at least five of the
states of this union have denied, accom-
panying their denial with force, outrage
and even murder The republicans have
submitted TO the unlawful and outrageous
policy and methods Of the south as long as
it is safe to the national welfare to do so.
They propose now TO hold the south at bay
with its 13s electoral votes by making the
north solid to degree that will preserve
the government from any powOr on their
part in the future TO control or shape its
policy. This is the remedy, and it is
within our reach in this contest, The north
never could have been made solid had the
south respected the constitution, the laws
and the rights of every citizen as they are
guaranteed therein. But the page of his
tory-uncontroyertiblc hstory-has estab-
lshed the fact that the right Of opinion, of
suffrage and Of life finds norespect in five of
the late insurgent states. This is the great
wrong that is to be righted-not in blood,
unless the south shall again resort TO that
expedient, but by holding the south away
from federal power with d sternness that
! will be eficctual and with power that is"

A COAL OIL HORROR.

FEARFUL RESULTS OF A LAMP


EXPLOSION.",,"A MAN AND HIS WIFE TERRIsLY
BuRNED-MIRAcUL ESCAPE OF
THEIR LITTLE CHILD--A TERRIBLE
SCENE.


A fearful visitation fell upon the house
Of John Sauerlander, No. 513 French
street, last night, by which he and his
wife were made the victims Of coal oil
explosion, a1d their little girl, aged five
years, narrowly escaped the same fright
full affliction.
1t happened about twelve O'Clock. Mr..
and Mrs. Sauerlander were just going to
bed. She was ahead, holdi, In her
hand the deadly, but as yet unsuspected
coal oil lamp, and he close behind, lead
ing their little girl by the hand. They
proceeded up stairs by the back stair
way, and just rs they reached the second
floor, the lamp In Mrs. SIS hand ex-
ploded, throwing the


BROKEN GLASS AND BURNING OIL
in all directions. In an instant tho
clothes Of the man and woman were on
fire, and then began their terrible strug-
gle for life.


Mr.. Sauerlandcr, Notwithstanding hls
terrible situation, at once noticed that
the little girl was unharmed, and with
rare p 90 nee Of mind he picked her ND
aud threw her into the bed room, on the
bed, and then. lying down upon The
foor, he drew the bed clothes OVER him,
aud rolled over, In an endeavor TO ex-
tinguish the flames that by this time en-
veloped the entire upper part of his
body.


Meanwhile, his wife rushed frantically
to the window, and attempted to leap
out into the yard below. The window
being rather small, however, she did not
succeed, though some parties aver that
she really did make the leap. The more
probable supposition is that she rushed
down by the font stairway and went
out by the street door. Marks of blood
on the steps and floor indicate this means
Of flight, and blood stains are also ON the
| window OF the room where she evidently
attempted to leap out. At any rate, she
picked mp her child before leaving, and
on reaching the street proceeded to the
residence Of Mr.. Samuel Barker,
few doors above, where she deposited
her child on the front steps and knocked
loudly at the door. Then, without
waiting for any response, she started for
her house again, but overcome by ex.
citement and suffering, fell down upon
the pavement In front Of the door, her
clothing still burning fiercely about her.
| Here she was found by Mr.. Barker, who
at once set to work sxiinguishing the
fire, and with the assistance of Joseph
Brady and Edward Lynch, who just
then arrived, he succeeded. The three
men then carried Mrs. Sauerlander into
the house, where they found her hus.
band blindly cropping his way about, and
suffering dreadful agony. His clothes
were not then burning, his efforts to ex
tinguish them by rolling in the bed
clothes having proved successful.


The three men after laying Mrs
Sauerlander upon lounge In the back
room, proceeded up stairs, where they
found the bed on fire. This fire they
soon extinguished with a few buckets
of water, though their forethought and
timely efforts prevented what might
have been serious confiagration.
Meanwhile the excitement and smoke
had occasioned an alarm of fire to which
the Washington and Reliance compa-
hies responded, but their services were
not required.


BY this time the entire neighborhood
was aroused, aud people came flocking
to the house. Physicians were sent for,
and DR.. Blocksom, the first to arrive,
went at once to work to relieve the two
nnfortunates. DIR. Kirscbner, the faml-
ly physicif u, soon came, as did also Drs.
Bush aad Springer, and with their unit
ed efforts the patients were made as
comfortable as possible. Linseed oil
and cotton were applied to the burns, ,and
/ al Cd
ministered. Mrs. Sauerlander lay upon
the lounge. suffering intensely, as was
evident by her pitiful groans, and all
band sat in chair beside her, ,herocally
sitting all expressions of his torture.
He bore up with great fortitude until
bed was,made for him, and as he lay
down he complained of great pain.
Much Of his strength Of nerve as well as
body, was gone by this time, and as DR..
kirschner administered a hypoderrnia
injection into his arm, he evidently did
not understand the meaning of the
pricking sensation and said, reproach-
fully, ""Oh, doctor, you shouldn't do
that""


The examination by the physicians
showed that both parties We're fearfully

burnt TO q crisp, and the left side of her
; face, her left breast, arm and shoulder,
aud right hand we're terribly burned. A
puncture, evidently inflicted by piece
Of broken glass, was discovered in her
elbow joint, and had severed the med


ium vein, which accounted for the pro-
fusion of blood around the premises.
Mr.. Sauerlander's back was charred


and he was also burned around the


head, arms and upper part of the body.
There was also slight cut upoon his


right temple. The skin and part of
the flesh peeled from his shoulders as
he was lifted from chair to bed on


the floor. He suffered great pain for
a couple of hours, and then began to
sleep fitfully, apparently sinking into
: lethargic condition. Mrs. Sauerlan-
der suffered great pain continuously,
and rested very little during the night.
At s o'clock this morning. the pa
tients were visited by Drs. Kirchner


and Blocksom, who spoke hopefully of
their condition. The physicians said
that as the sufferers had evidently in
haled none of the flame, there were


strong hopes of their ultimate re-


covery.

 of that and of our faith in him we have in

 these things I stand here and pledge Maine to

 give him the most earnest support from now

 until the ides of November.

 General Logan said: ''We are to be con-

 strength. Whatever may have transpired in this convention to hurt the feelings of any one hope that in our conclusion it will pass from our minds. I say with the friends

 Mir Campbell, of West Virginia, read tel 1 egram from his constituents declaring that 1 West Virginia would do her best to make Gen. | eral Garfield the next President.

 MT.

The business in order before the convention was motion made in the af- ternoon to proceed to nominate Vice Presi- dent.

 MT.

Mir Pixley concluded by moving E. B. Washburne, of Illinois. (Cheers)

 MDennis Mccarthy, of New York, in a brief speech eulogizing Washburnes record in Congress and Paris, seconded the nomina- tion.

 B. c. Robinson, of Connecticut proposed to fill out the ticket of the citizen soldier of the West with a business man of the East, and one who would save to the Republican party at least one doubtful State. He placed in nomination Marshall Jewell of Con- necticut MT. Hicks, of Florida, desired the convention to go to the country with prom ise to break up the odious ''solid South"" If the party would nominate Judge Thomas Settle, of Florida, it would not only give double assurance of such in Florida, but carry North Carolina and go a long way te ward bringing about a similar result in Georgia and Alabama.

Maynard was nomi- mated by Mr. Houck, of Tennessee. General Woodford, of New York, presented the name of General Chester A.

Dennison, of Ohio, seconded the nomination and predicted SC, 900 majority in Ohio MT. Lynch, of Mississippi, intend ed to present Mir. Bruce, but in view of party unity and success and at Bruee's request ssc- onded Arthur's nomination. MT. Morrison of Maryland and Filley of Mississippi also seconded Arthur's nomination. MT.

WHAT Is GOING on IN THE WORLD.",,"An effort is being made at St. Louis
to turn the tide Of colored immigrants now
arriving from the South to some other State
than Kansas. The Rev. W. o. Lynch, Pre-
siding Elder Of the Methodist Episcopal
Church, of Topeka, recently visited st. Louis
for this purpose. He represented to the To-
cal Relief Association that Kansas was al
ready overrun with refugees, and COM
planned that the St. Louis Transportation
Committee influenced them to go to Kansas
by telling them that 81 ,O0O,O 200 had
been subscribed by the people for their
benefit, and that upon their arrival in
Kansas they would be well taken care Of.
He further stated that he had good reason
to believe that the Transportation Commit
tee were Influenced by money received from
steamboat companies. An investigation
of the charges was promptly made, which
resulted in the removal Of the Com
mittee named, and their commissions
have been revoked by the Mayor. A
branch of the Kansas Relief Association
has been established in St. Louis, for the
purpose Of paying the expenses of all in
digent colored immigrants until arrange
ments can be made to send them to other
States. Is is said numerous applications for
colored iaborers have been received from
Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Michigan and
Ohio, and an effort will be made to induce
them to go to those States."

 Ut is truly refreshing to hear such sermon as that preached by Rev. Jer- orie Haraldson at the Methodist Church last Sunday. He preached as though he loved to preach-not as though it was task which he waded through indifferently, and irksome to him. If all preachers would preach after accomplished and one would not feel bored to, death when he attended church.

 Here is specimen of what can be made out of the soil of Arkansas: Mr. J. A. Tillman cultivated 93 acres of land near this town-5 acres of which were in the river bottom and ""A acres upland. He made eleven bales of cot ton which weighed 5696 pounds and had remnant of 600 pounds of seed cotton left; besides an estimated waste of 1000 pounds beat out by the late rains anl not gathered up from of the ground. His cotton brought him $601.- 37 cents. The crop was made and gathered entirely by MT. Tillman and his 14 year old boy, assisted in picking by his two little girls-the only hired labor for the whole crop being for pick ing 6797 pounds of seed cotton at a cost of $5435. His little girl only z years old picked 201S pounds. Him self, his little boy and two little girls picked 13,253 pounds. In addition to this, MT. Tillman made plenty of corn to do him.

 --The grand excursion from all points on thls road to Washington D. C., will positively take place on the 10th of this month.

Those of our people who may wish to visit their old homes in the State of North Carolina will find this an excelL lent opportunity, as they can switch off from Lynehburg and go but little out of a direct line. There will be palace sleepers from Little Rock to Lynchburg-faref for single birth $3.75; {; Section $750. All who intend to go on the trip will find tickets for sale at this station on Feb. 12th, and 1t is the re- quest or the Agents that those who want ticksts make application between that date and the l4th, so that ample accommodations for all may be provided.

 The school board held a meeting last Saturday night. The secretary made his annual financial report showing the condition of the finances of the district.

The streets were crowded with people and
the fine appearance of the military was gener-
ally commented on. They never looked neat
er nor marched better. They were credit to
any city. The new uniforms of the Infantry at
tracted favorable comment, and the High
School Cadets were the subject of fiattering
remark on this, their first appearance
on dress parade. Flags were generally dis
played all along the route, and business
throughout the city suspended.


Arrived at City Building, the battalion
opened ranks, and received the members of
the City Government, who were headed by
Chairman Taylor of the Aldermen and Presi-
dent Fisk of the Council, and then m arched
direct to the Preble street station of the Roch-
ester road where the train was in readiness to
convey them to Evergreen.


AT EVERGREEN CEMETERY.
On the arrival of the train at Morrill's Cor
ner the line was reformed and marched to the
soldiers lot when the squads detailed to dec
crate graves in the various sections proceeded
at once to the performance of that duty.
Nearly two hundred graves were visited in
the various sections, and marked with beauti-
full wreaths, baskets, and lboquets of flowers.
Among those particularly noticeable for the
beauty OF their arrangement, were baskets for
the graves of Capt G. w. Thompson, Lieut..
Grin b. stevens, Charles f. Long, d. III.
Stevens, and Charles f. Vanhorn wreaths
for the graves of William A. Hall and Will
liam Cummings; and bouquets for the graves

placed upon the grave of Miss Adeline
Walker, nurse, who gave her health and
ultimately her life for the sick and wounded
in southern hospitals.


After decorating the graves the various COM
panies were reformed in line and the Post
the monument. Rev. G. A. Hayden, of In
dia street Unversalist church, offered prayer
and dirge was played by the band The fol-
lowing original poem by Miss L. M. Eaton,
dedicated to Bosworth Post, was tlren sung:


Another year has flown,


Another spring has gone, ,------


How quickly sped.


Far from this quiet spot,


Far from this hallowed lot,


Our hearts forget thee not,


Our sacred dead.


With dirge and mufed drum,


AT duty's call we come


A faithful band


Beneath this azure dome


Beside your leafy home,


Thy comrades loving come, -


OF every land.


We gather here to-day,


Attribute sweet to pay,


Our h0nored dead.


To deck with flowers rare,


With garlands rich and fair,


While the dear old flag waves there,


Its folds outspread


AS long as life shall last,


Our comrades of the past


Shall be our care,


And when Post BoSworth all


Shall answer to the call,t


The final muster roll.


Wen meet you there.
the procession reformed and marched to the
cars.


EVENING.


City Hall, notwithstanding the change to
warm weather, was filled with Splendid au-
dience last night. The platform was occupied
by Chambers Band from 7.3O to O'Clock who
delighted every one with choice programme.
At its close Department Commander Smith
and staff, with Post Commander Nickerson
and staff, members of the City Government
and distinguished guests, the orator of the
evening, and Rev. Messrs. f. E. Clark of Will
liston and w. e. Gibbs of Congress Square
entered and took seats on the platform.
Prayer was offered by Mr.. Clark, after which
Hon. W. f. Lunt delivered the grafton, an alb
stract of which is here given:


HON. W. F. LUNT's GRAFTON.
Mr.. Lunt commenced by saying that the day
commemorated the patriotism of those citiz MS
who participated in the great movements des-
tined by Providence to advance our civiliZa-
ton, consolidate our national power, promote
education and as5imilate the various sections
of the country. The speaker then went on to
describe the similarity between the life of an
individual and that of a nation. There are GER
tain laws, physical and social, which, violated,
produce seriousGresults. Nations are but an
aggregation of individuals, perpet etuating their
race Dy mutual ala ana protoCtlOn. The ma
tion's life depends upon the observance OF
these laws. Mankind is divided into the bar
barian, half civilized, civilized and enlight-
ened. All elevations from the first condition
are the results of continual struggle as there is
also a continual retrogressive tendency, by
sort of moral gravitation, towards barbarism
Examples of this tendency were afforded in
the contrast between the wild and cultivated
rose, and also between wild and thoroughbred
cattle. Take away the essential conditions
which have led to the superior development of
the breeding and speedily both rose and cattle
will return to their original form or be extin-
guished altogether. So with places on our
own coast where once were smiling fields and
happy homes The settlers abandoned them
and now only the stone foundations remain in
the midst of the forest primeva. Nations
have grown weak chiefly through the decad-
ence of the spirit and disposition of the indi.
vidual citizens. ga sound body is essential to
sound and vigorous mind.'' A mode Of life
tending to such condition in the individual
will develop a national will and energy to ex-
ercise the ,powerthus created and makes tie
nation both progressive and aggressive.
10 make the nation strong so that it NAV
exist for ages, individual citizens must observe
the laws, cultivate the moral sepsibilties en-
tighten their consciences, discriminate Justly
as to private rights, be simple in habits. insist
on compulsory education, a reverence for law
and love OF country: The great problem our"

W. j. Porter, man who bore the
reputation of being hard character,
mas been living at Alma, lmin-
ing camp in Park county, for some
weeks past. This morning he bought
pistol saying he proposed to kill his
partner. Before finding his intended
victim he met Thomas Connolly, a
hard working miner, and provoked a
quarrel and then shot Connolly With
out warning. Porter was arrested and
placed in Jail, but he had been there
less than an hour when fifty of the
leading citizens of the camp came up
and, putting rope around Porter's
neck, hanged him up at the place at
which he was standing, tying the cord
to q projecting beam Of the jail. No
masks were used, and no resistance
was offered to this summary proceed
ing. When the ""vigilants'' entered
the Jail Porter drew knife which he
had concealed about his person and
made an effort to defend himself, but
was soon disarmed. At last accounts
his body was still hanging before the
Jail. =.
There have recently been three IA
tai shooting cases in Alma, which is
the Justification of the people of that
place for their conduct to-day.


SHORT WORK WITH A MURDERER.
Santa Fe also boasts of recent
lychihg. Sylvia Pisa, the rufian who
murdered the old woman Lopez a few
days ago, was taken from jail on Sat
urday by about forty mounted and
armed men and lynched. His body
has not been found, and it is supposed
that he was taken out three miles from
town, shot and his body hidden."

 and there in our annals. The sojourn of the I regicides in New England after the restoration of Charles II. is a chapter of authentic TO- l nance. know of no reason to distrust the 1 tradition that in the attack made upon Hadley by the Indians in 1875 the people were rallied by word of command from an unknown man, l advanced in years and clothed in the costume | of former day, who suddenly appeared in | the midst of them, put the invaders to flight, ] and then disappeared himself; and that the veteran who had thus led and inspirited them

 and then vanished was the same Colonel Goffe who had broken through the lines of | Prince Rupert at Naseby and had sat on the | Court of High Commission that sent to the seaffold King Charles I. Walter Scott has | lost great part of his fascination for the | generation at present on the stage. Mediae- | valism can no longer cast spell on the men | of to-day the democratic tendency is too

 rife; the criticism of social inequalities is too

 keen; pageants and glorious feats of arms do ] not veil from our eyes the accompanying igno- rance and superstition. Yet we can at least ! remember the thrill of delight which was ex- perienced in reading for the first time how, in | the lists of Ashby when Ivanhoe was hard pressed by his antagonists, and well nigh borne down, the stalwart knight in black ar- nor, who had istlessly stood aloof from the contest, suddenly walked from his slumbsr, 1 struck Font de Boeuf from his saddle, rolled \ the bulky Athelstane in the dirt with single | blow of the battle axe wrenched from his l hand, and leaving to the disinherited knight | but 8 single foe to deal with retired from the throng as leisurely as he had come, awakening the surmise, however, that the mysterious champion whose powerful arm had done that work could be none other than the long ab- l sent monarch, Richard Occur de Lion. Our l sense of the heroic is doubly stirred by brave deed in an emergency. Let me advert to an l incident, one of the most affecting in all Grscian history, which occurred in conneo- 1 ton with the battle of Marathon. But first must recall to your memory some of the cir cumstancss relating to that conflict. It was one of the great battles which have detsrmin- ed the course of history. It was contest of the East with the West, Europe with Asia. It was the question whether the growing civili- zation of Greece, with its ideas of liberty, of constitutional right, and the value of the in dividual, should be crushed by the might of that colossal Empire which had already quenched in blood the revolt of the Ionian cities The Greeks were to stand face to face with the military force of that Asiatic power which had spread it's dominion over g great part of the world as 1t then existed.

 And the Athenians were left to bear the brunt

 by themselves. Philippeides, ono of the

 swiftest runners, had been sent to Sparta,

 reaching that city, 1855 or 40 miles distant, the next day after he started. The Spartans, stunted Romans as they have been called, with their pharisaical piety, for the reason, either real or pretended, that they thought 1t not right to march until the moon was full, with held their aid. There was treschery and di- yidsd counsels, moreover, at home. Ailtiades had obtained leave to fight only by the cast ing vote of the Polemarch, given at his urgent request. Immediately after the bat tie, a shield was displayed on Mt. Pentelicus, signal of traitors, designed probably to di- fIoD fN

 ium, as they actually did, for the purpose of effecting landing nearer Athens, an attempt which was baffied by the rapidity of Miltiades who, on the game evening, or, possibly, on the morning of the next day, marched his army distance of 23 miles to meet the apprehend- ed attack. There on the plain of Marathon the ten thousand Athenians, among them

 men like the poet HEschylus, stood and be- fore them was the uncounted host of their enemies spread along the shore. At this mo-

 ment, when not only their lives and the

 lives of their families, but the very existence

 of their country, and, in an important degree,

 the cause of civilization for all coming time, were hanging in the balance, and they were left by tho other Greek communities to fight single handed-at this moment of su- preme peril they saw approaching to their

 help 1000 men, the whole fighting popula- tion of the little town of Platea. No doubt the

 pseans of the Athenians rang out with louder

 note, as they ran forward upon the enemy,

 for this timely help and the sympathy which

 it betokened- Athens showed her appreciation

 of the timely service done by the Plateans by

 making them Athenian citizens, az far as civ

 il rights were concerned and, ever after, at

 the commemoration of the victory, once in

 four years, the Athenian herald impIored the

 blessings of the gods upon the Plateans in common with his own people.

 Into intellectual efforts of a high order char

 IT, IL

 without convictions cannot speak or write

 well. Eloquence has been styled virtue, so

 dependent is noble and effective speech upon

 the moral spirit that animates the orator.

 When the orator requires lofty courage in or der to speak as he does, when he speaks, not

 for the qualification of his hearers, nor for their applause, but for practical end,

 like the salvation of the State, then his words

 are really deeds Speech is then itself an act.

 < There

 have been men in public life who were most

 remarkable for their intellectual accomplish

 ments and for the graces of manner, and who

 lacked no advantage which training could con-

 fer, but who have failed in the power to

 thrill their auditors, simply because they made

 oratory moro an end than 8 means. Other

 men who have been thought to be, like Moses,

 slow of speech, men of action, of indepen-

 dence, of courage, have risen to an eloquence,

 which, If you measure eloquence by it's effect,

 has never been surpassed. The biographer of Cromwell tell us, in his quaint style how that leader, at critical moment, in the House of Commons dropped from his stammering tongue speech that melted tough old Sir Ed

 mund Coke to tears. There is striking per sonage, pertinent here, in the diary of the elder John Adams kept during the sessions of

 the Continental Congress. Under the date of August 22, 1774, he writes-referring to MT.

 Lynch of Virginia, whom he pronounces a

 most sound and judicious person 'sHe (Mr.

 Lynch) told us that Colonel Washington made the most eloquent speech at the Virginia Con- vention that ever was made.

There was man behind the words,-a man not caring to say grand things, silent man, ac- customed to follow up his words with deeds. reputation and fortune in jeopardy, in the matter which they were debating; who knows whether it may not have been the effect of that incident, as related by Lynch, which led John Adams to suggest the name of Washing ton as commander of the Continental armies !?

 Prof. Fisher now compared the types of heroism shown in Cranmer and. Latimer re- spectively. Oranmer thrust the perfdious hand into the flames. Old Hugh Latimer, how different was he in his natural temper? 'tBs of good comfort, said he, ''Msster Ridley, and play the man we shall this day light such candle by Gods grace in England as trust shall never be put out"" Thus also the speaker compared Melancthon, scholarly, true yet timid, with brave Luther, whose courage rose as difficulties arose. He drew picture of Nilton's facing the immediate peril of total blindness rather than the assertion of his duty to his country. He tcalled, he said, Gin reply to friend, the two destinies which the oracle of Delphi announced to the son of Thetis: 1.-TWO fates may lead me to the.realms of night.

 If, staying here, around Troy's wall fight,

 To my dear home moro must return

 But lasting glory will adorn my

 But, if I withdraw from the martial strife,

 Silent is my fame, but long will be my life.

GIRL RECENTLY KIDNAPPED.


Saleme Burkett, the young girl VINO
was kidnapped BY four men belonging
10 Boyd & Peters circus at Shanksvil'e,
in Somerset county, Pa, has been found,
and Yesterday s. G. Peters, A. u. Davis,
II. Marks, and Clark Wise, the men
charged with the crime, had nearing
before Judge Hunton in GreepsDiTg;;
Miss Burkett was put on the stare anu
was examined by Congressman Cotroth,
who acted as the girls counsel. IS
Burketu said that she was at the snow
a Shanksville on Tuesday, the 18th
inst; at 2 o'clock in the afternoon, Wen
the show was out, she started to 60
home; a Snowman met her by the
church and asked her to 60 back; she
told him she did not want to 60 bacsS; he
then took hold OF her aud dragged her
back; she was at the show ill night; she
then started TO 60 home with some
neighbors; at the door she was met
again by several showmen; she was
carried back, thrown dowo, and they all
assaulted her; they afterwards put her
in the ticket wagon and took her to
Jenner Cross Roads, and on the way
one of them, who stayed In the wagon
with her, assaulted her al Jenner; she
tried to get away from them, but was
prevented; five of them took her to the
woods and again saulted her; after
this she has no recollection of anything
that happened; did not know that she
was at Ligonier or how she got there;
did not know how she back to Somerset.
Here the prosecution asked postpone
ment OF the hearing on account of the
sad condition of the witness. Mr..
Cofroth, in asking postponement, said
that this was one of The most heinous
and revolving crimes ever perpetrated
After remarks by counsel for the de-
fense, the Judge continued the case un
til the 30th of July.


Rumors were rife yesterday that thu
girl was found dead in Indiana county
1t appears that after the prisone,1
found her father was after her at Ligonie
they took her across the mountain, an,
she found her way to Somerset in a mos
deplorable condition. At some place.
she was seen wandering along the roaC
scattering sand or going listlessly
through fields. She at last fell into
kind hands, who took her TO Somerset
and sent her home. She has no remem-
brance of what happened to her or what
was done to her after she was put in a
tent at Jenner Cross Roads. The pri-
soners were remanded iuto the custody
Vi the Sheriff. The girl recognized each ot
the four men in custody as the parties
whom she saw with Ike show, and who
had assaulted her. The case will be
ferreted TO the bot ON. Miss DrIkett is
a pretty little country girl and will be
fourteen years old in December. She
was plainly dressed, but seemed not to
be III condition to give her testimony.
She gave her account in a low, weak
voice. The most intense indignation
prevails in Greensburg, and threats oi
lynching the offenders are freely made."

BILKED BY A PIONEER PRESS MAN.


The all important theme of conversation for
the past few days in our city has been the sud-
den disappearance of E. J. Lynch, reporter for
the st. Paul Pioneer Press at this city. His
brother William, who has been here for few
weeks visiting him, has also vanished. The
shippers have skipped the town, board bill
and sundry other bills.


Monday evening William informed his land
lady that ED was invited to the Clifton
House for tea, aud consequently she need not
wait for him. As for himself, he did not feel
we'll and did not care for any thing to eat-his
inner cravings did not tend in that channel, so
to speak-and at once retired to his room
Later in the evening light was noticed there
and nothing was thought of the matter until
the next morning, when their non-sppearance
at breakfast aroused the suspicion that the
gentlemen had changed their bosrding house.
and that they did not fancy frequent remind
ers of Indebtedness. Upon investigating their
room it was ascertained that what little of this
worlds possessions they did have in the shape
of clothing, had been packed into a valise aad
was gone. Nothing was left but his sweet
hearts picture and one or two other trifling
articles and volume of Burns poems. The
last named article he, E. j., probably left
thinking his conscience, if he possessed
one, would supply him with what he
lacked by the dispossession of the little vol
ume. The conclusion is that he held the lady
IN such high estimation that the picture was
lett to compensate for board bill of about
$45. Nothing was said until noon, when it
was known that they were not in the city. In
quiries were made which brought to light the
following facts, the ''mourners"" being more
numerous than was at first imagined:
We think the invitation extended by one of
the prOprietors of the Clifton house Monday
night was of different character than the one
| intended to convey, rs he was invited to settle
his account of some $50 in the billiard hall
connected with that house, and he concluded
that he would refuse the bid and patronize the


Mankato house for supper, which they both
did. Nothing is known of their mo 5ements
after that, but it is supposed they both took
the western bound train for Sioux City at s
| o'clock that night. Among other victims, be-
| sides those named, are Gen. Baker, who signed
| a note for him for S25; J. q. Chapman, the
same; John Diamond, $2S, which he borrowed
the day of his departure W. B. Smith, $50
for clothing and several others. His total in
debtedness is nearly $500. We have heard of
several instances where be tried to borrow
money and failed, and induce others to go his
security, with like results. Many regret
their undue amount of confidence.
There are a great many 81 told you
SOS, or II thought So"" We evidently had a
better opinion of him than he deserved, as we
could hardly credit the facts, though having a
knowledge of his alteration."

surcease, casting fraudulent votes just
merely to relieve their dimentia.""


Tho Chief Justics charged the jury at
considerable length, dwelling especially
upon the plea set up upon the defense,
wherein he said that drunkenness was
no excuse but rather an accessory agent.
Were the plea of drunkenness received
as an excuse for crime, society would
have no protection.

DE YOUNG KILLED.

SHOT Y MAYOR 1. s. KALLocH's son",,"SHOT ID MAYOR 1. 8. KALLOCH'S SON.


IN FRANCISCO, April %, 1880.


Charles De Young, editor Of the
Chronicle, was shot and killed at half
past seven o'clock this evening by j. M.
Kalloch, son of Mayor l. s. Kalloch, in
the Office Of the Chronicle.


The story Of the trouble between the
De Youngs and the Kallochs begins
with the candidature of the elder Kali
loch for Mayor of San Francisco. On
the night of the 22d of August, 1879,
Mr.. Kalloch, Er., then the workingmen's
candidate fer Mayor, made an exceed
ingly bitter speech at q mass meeting in
reply 10 an article in the Chronicle.
That paper was opposed to the sand lot
party, and in an editorial accused Kali
loch Of imm0ralities practised in Boston
twenty years before. It was in answer
ing this charge that Kalloch made his
very bitter tIack upon the De Youngs,
calling them, among other things, ""the
bastard sons Of prostitute.D


The following evening Charles De
Young drove IN q covered coupe in
front of the private entrance of the Me-
tropolitan Temple, where Mr.. Kalloch
had his study and room, and sent a mes
senger boy asking him to come out. Mr..
Kalloch Immediately appeared on the
sidewalk. when De Young shot him In
the breast. Mr.. Kallock turned to re-
treat within doors, when De Young shot
him in the back. A crowd Immediately
seized the carriage in which De Young
was, turned it over aud tore him out.
He was dreadfully kicked and bruised,
and would no doubt have been killed on
the spot h Ad not an unusual number of
policemen come suddenly to the rescue
and hurried him to Jail.


The shooting occasioned the most in
tense excitement throughout the civ,
aud frequent threats were made to lynch
De Young. Kalloch was then consider
ed to be dying, aud frequent meetings
were held by the workingmen for the
discussion of the shoot ng and its politi-
cal consequence to them.


KALLoCH. JR.'s. FIRST THREATS.
1t was at one of these meetings that
|. N. Kalloch made his first appear
ance as an agitator. He made most
inflammable speech, calling ON his
fathers friends for vengeance. He
was a baptist preacher located in
Sonoma county and came down to the
sand lot meetings. He was considered
a good speaker, and was listened to
attentively by the bowling mobs. So
favorable an impression did he make
on them that they discussed the proba-
bilities of making him Mayor in case
his father died. At this meeting young
KallOch said that he hoped for peace,
at the request of his mother, and foI
the sake of his father, who, he thought
would certainly die ifexcited. He be-
lieved, however, that his father ""would
live to tread on the sod over De
Young's grave. Continuing he said -


81 appeal to you, if De Young is not
killed by the law to help me kill him.


Kalloch, Sr., recovered, was elected
Mayor, and the matter appeared to die
out 1t seems now no Sever, that il
/ was only simmering, and the action o.
young Kalloch in shooting De Young
dead in his Office is an evidence that HI
did not forget his threat."

The Striking Cabinet Makers.",,"l The Striking Cabinet Makers. | NEW YORK, Feb. 26.-The prospect for the striking cabinet makers of Hermann's facto- ries is far from encouraging. Some of the better men returned to finish the work they had in hand when the strike commenced. They declared that they would be only too glad to remain in the shop for good, since they fully realized that MT. Hermann's proposition was excellent, but dared not stay for fear of | other strikers and trades unions. Under the l circumstances MT. Hermann decidedto wait no longer for them, and engaged several hundred men in Boston and Philadelphia, where he has branch offices. The passage of these men to this city will be paid by their employ CT, and they will arrive tomorrow. They are said to be all good men, and they will be paid thirty per cent. over the old rates of wages for the first month, and after that they will receive the increase offered the strikers from IS to 22 per cent. above the price paid pre- vious to the strike. The factory will be locked during working hours and every pre- caution taken to guard the new corners against any possible annoyances from the strikers. The strikers met again this morning and lis- tened to numbers of encouraging speeches from members of their own organization, as well as from representatives of other shops and factories. They resolved to remain firm in the position they assumed, and not to re- sume work till every one of their demands have been acceded to. Yesterday they for the first time accepted some pecuniary assist ance offer them.

 Meeting of the League Officers.

 ROCHESTER, Feb. 26.-The officers of the Base Ball League are in session at the Os- borne House in this city. The board of directors, consisting of Hurlburt, Evans, Sage, Thomer and Lodsn, met this morning and prepared report, which was presented this afternoon. The business is entirely se- cret, no reporters being allowed. It has been learned, however, that the six Western clubs will open the season by playing six games among themselves. The Eastern clubs will do the same. Eighty-four games will be played by each club, forty-two at home and the balance outside. The Eastern clubs will probably first visit their oppo- nents in the West. It is thought the schsd- uie which has already been prepared will meet with considerable opposition before being arranged satisfactorily to all parties. There is some talk that the representatives  to rsscind the legislation adopted last year preventing the manager of a club taking seat on the field where his club is playing.

 At the evening meeting an address was de- livsred by President Hurlburt on temperance, in which he argued that men would be far better players on the grounds and more high ly esteemed by the public at large if they would not touch intoxicating liquors in any shape. The following was presented and unanimously adopted:

 Resolved, That in view of the probability that any club now a member of the League forfeiting it's membership by disbandment or inability from any cause to play out its games as per schedule, committee, consist ing of President Hurlburt and Eyans are hereby appointed and fully authorized to ar range with any club in good standing to take the place vacated by the retiring club under certain restrictions and obligations to be fixed by said committee, and provided that such an arrangement does not confer membership on said club appointed or involve any change in the seasons schedule as fixed.

 All the clubs agreed to an arrangement not to negotiate with any player for the season of 1881 prior to October 23, 1880. The follow ing were selected umpires for the season Fred. Waterman of Cincinnati W. J. Riley of Cincinnati, Charles F. Wilbur of Troy B. F. Wade of Cleveland, J. W. Young of Syra- cuse, M. Mclean of Philadelphia, A. J. Pratt of Allegheny, Penn., Charles B.

 When I last wrote you I was just about to

 pass through the Hoosac Tunnel in MassA- | chusstts. In fact I was prevented finishing my letter by the darkness while inside of that place, for although the lamps were lighted in- ! side the car it was darker than midnight out | side. think no traveller ever goes through ] there without a feeling of dread. The air within is always damp and cold, and the five I miles' ride is always finished with long drawn breath of satisfaction by mo when I am once in daylight again. From North Adams I went to Troy, and af- ter 8 couple of hours in Albany took the night boat for New York, most remarkable thing | to be able to do at this season of the year, when navigation seldom opens before the mid dle of April. By the way, did you ever guess how much fall there is to the Hudson river from Albany to New York-something over 150 miles ? fellow passenger set me to guessing (knowing was from Connecticut and I honestly put it at two hundred feet. You can imagine my surprise when tell you upon his authority that it is less than sixty inches. That accounts for there being so few ice houses along it's banks down near it's mouth. The icemen have to get their crop further north than tide water, or it would be

 brackish from the salt of New York bay. Think of it, my New Haven friends, when you could buy coal at half the price you had to pay for your ice per ton last year, what you may reasonably expect to pay forit the coming season.

 After spending day in the greatest city of our land took the cars for Easton, thence to that famous town of crooked roads and dark bridges, and was much pained to learn from local paper the misfortune of one of its for merly most respectable dry goods merchants, and one whom in former years had transact ed business with. It seems that for some time past he had gained a reputation for sellin g dress silks so cheaply that the merchants in the neighboring stores and towns were losing all of their trade, and it could not be under stood until one day last week the truth came out by him and his wife both being arrested in one of New York's large retail stores in the act Of carrying away in an ordinary paper box several full pieces of the most costly goods. You saw full account of it in your dailies, but you ought to have seen the indignation of his fellow merchants when the matter was brought to light. They felt like lynching him, they said

 From Bethlehem I went to the ""City of Brotherly Love-"" and the next day tried to go over to Allentown, md after two or three unsuccessful starts succeeded in getting there by taking what is often said to be the surest way home, i. e., the longest way round. You can imagine my feelings when I took the wrong train, spent twice the usual fare, and several hours more than the proper time sim ply because I mistook the depot-for they have railroad depot on every sixth cor ner in Philadelphia, it seems to me. When I was once in Allentown I left for Reading after being we'll laughed at for being for twenty years drummer and not knowing ''the ropes"" yet. By the way, the iron busi ness is ''booming' up this way still all along the Lehigh Valley, but when I reached Read ing it was changed. Seventeen of the largest mills, as learned to. day in Harrisburg were idle on account of strikes. Oh, what fools | some men are. Anxious for work at $1 per day | and then, after being advanced 25 to 50 per i cent. in less than six months, striking | and starving their families, simply because 8 few leaders, more lazy and subtle than their fellows demand an advance, more than the employers can pay and run their business without positive loss. am too indignant when writing on this subject to express my contempt for such fellows in words.

 forgot to say that before arriving at Har- | risburg took little run up to PottsvilIe to | see an old friend who has spent many years of college life inSour city, and he was delight i ed to hear about the old ""Profs"" aud the col | lege and loca! news in general. I promised him the JOURNAL AND COURIER when my next letter was In print, and know he will be glad to read over your columns again. We became so much interested in Connecticut matters that we forgot for the time business, dinner, and also the fact that both of us were fifteen years older than when we last met.

Correspondence OF the Richmond Com


monwealth.


CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va, July A.
One of the most shocking outrages
was perpetrated near this place on
Monday last, the facts of which have
just came to light. Living in about
three-duarters of mile from the SUBJ
urhs of the city. lives family by the
name Of Maupin. The family is poor
but honest and respectable. On Mon
day last, while the husband was alb
sent, the wife, with three of her small
children around her, was at work in
the house. She saw standing at the
door negro man, who, when she ask
ed him what he wanted, said that he
understood that she had some socks
for sale and he wished to buy pair.
She told him she had no socks for sale
He then made some remark about the
weather and continued to talk until
the woman became alarmed and said
to her little son, aged Z years, that
they would &C to their uncle's, who
lived a short distance off. She closed
the door at which the negro was stand
ing and prepared to leave the house.
She then perceived the negro had come
around to the rear door. She also clos
ed that, and taking her infant in her
arms left the house. When she had
gone about twenty or thirty yards she
saw the negro following her. She be-
came very much alarmed, and started
back to the house for pistol. Before
she reached the house she was seized
by the negro, who tore her infant
from her arms and threw it on the
ground. He then attempted to drag
her into the woods, but finding that he
could not, he threw her to the ground,
and there, in the presence of her three
children, outraged her, af,er which he
fled. When her husband returned,
she related to him her story, and de-
scribed the negro. A party went out
in search of him, and found negro, by
name Joe Bryan or Bryant, who ans
wered the description. He was brought
before Mrs. Maupin, who identified
him as the negro who outraged her,
He was then turned over to The author
tiles and lodged in jail. Since the
facts have become known great indig.
nation prevails, and there is sone talk
of lynching, but as yet no demonstra-
tion has been made."

of the town, having been interested in
recent experiments in electricity on
the bodies of persons who had been
hung, arranged with the chairman of
the committee to let them have the

TO drink heavily. He was soon in state
Of intoxication and in the midst Of. a

ent of tho postohico department railway mail
service, returned to Washington yesterday
from an extended tour of inspection over the
routes traversed by the new fast mail service
trains which were put in operation on July
between New Yolk city and tho west. Mr..
Thompson started from New York city about
ton days since and travelled west, via tho New
York Central road, as far rs Cleveland, Ohio,
returning, via Pittsburg, Harrisburg and
Philadelphia, over the Pennsylvania railroad
He examined carefully the schedules Of the
roads on which the department depends for
the performance Of this last service, AS well rs
the mon, means and appliances used in doing
tho work, aud all minor matters which arc
likely to contribute to tho success of the fast
mail service, and SIS a result Of his ohserva-
tons pronounces everything in hrst'class
condition.


Congress at its last session appropriated
$3.50 900 for special mail service on railroads,
Previous to that time Sl50000 had been ap.
propriatod for this service fOr tho year 1879.
| Mr.. Thompson says very satisfactory results
| in the direction 0f eNpodiing mail service
have boeu accomplished during tho last year
| with tho limited appropriation of 1879, With
| the increased appropriation Of P30OOOO Tor the
/
he expects still more gratifying results will be
| obtained.


The service as organized mp to tho present
! time includes IN addition to what was in sue
ccssful operation last year, an improved fast
mail service from Now York to tho west oven
| the New York Cvutral and tho Pcnnsylyaniu
railroads, which places somo Of the most i'm
portant eastern cities in closer mail con

| Traius on each of these roads leave New Yorl
at about p. m,, and by this Urrangemon
alone Mr. Thompson believes that large por
tion of the entire mail of business day il
New York city, or at least all that portion nc
cumuhtng between the hours Of 9 aud 1870 p
M, will be advanced westward us far as Chi
cl2o twenty-four hours sooner than undcr tn,

The siguer Is one Of the most tesper-
ate members of the James brothers
gang. who tor a long time operated IN
Missouri. numbering Te2ceab!e citizens,
and who subsequently fed to Texas 10
es-ape the uenalty of their crimes, W hlth-
er they were pursued by officers Of the
law The history Of their depredations
would i'll a volume. For couple OF
vears the press Of the entire country
has teeme,i with an almost uninterrupi-
ed rerorl of their ra=caliiies, their blooi-
thirsty exploits, and their hair-hreadth
es ar,es from lynching. On January -,
1875. Jesse and his gang threw a hand
grenade into house in Clay county,
Mo. instantly killing severai persons.
For this they were pursued and over
taken By the deputy marshals- Beng
men Of reckless valor, and being rem
forced, they succeeded in beating on The
officers o; the law, and made good their
escape. This was followed by the BRO al
murder of a citizen named Daniel Ash
land. on April IA, 1875. Following up
these exploits. jesse james and his two
brothers. assisted b. another gang Of
masked burglars, broke into the North
field Bank OF Minnesota, helped them.
selves to a large sum Of money, and
wound up by numbering the cashier. All
these crlmes. and others too numerous
TO chronicle, were perpetrated with i'm
punity. An unsuccessful attempt to take
these freeboo,ers into custody, was made
on October % following, They, however.
eluded their pursuers, but were again
brought 10 bay on the 10Th OF November
with the game result. Another attempt
for their apprehension was made on the
29th, but they seemed to be possessed of
superior strategetieal ability and always
either beat off the pursuing party, or
managed 10 conceal Themselves In some
inaccessible resort, known only 10 them
selves, where they could rest securely,
and defy the approach Of an army.


FLIGHT To IENAs.


After spreading terror and disrnay
throughout the length and breadth OF
Missouri, number Of the gang fled to
Texas. thrilling narrative was teIe-
graphed from Kansas City, Mo, on the
81 OF last November detailing an attempt
TO capture the James brothers, and rec1t-
ing that in the struggle which followed
Jesse was shot dead. The account OF
the affair went on to say that the officials
Of Joplin, Mo, had a short time prev
iously been apprised that the James
brothers, and at least two members Of
the gang were in that vicinity. This in
formation occasioned the widest dis
may. II was feared that sheir presence
boded i'll to the inhabitants. The au-
thorities affirmed that the outlaws medi-
tated raid on the bank at Joplin OF
Short Greek. On that account these in
stitutions were carefully guarded by
number OF armed men whose services
we're suddenly called into requisition IN
anticipation Of such visit. Al o'clock
on the morning Of November 2, George
Shepherd rode excitedly into Short
Creek, suffering from a pistol shot
wound in the thigh, and with sundry
perforations in his saddle which were
caused BY bullets He reported that he
had had desperate encounter with the
James brothers. Shepherds story *
cited more alarm than sympathy. He
was supposed TO have belonged 10 the
James and Younger gang who had pre-
yiously in connection with the Quantrell
band participated in the robbing Of a
Kentucky bank The James brothers
Inistristed hiin, although he was admit
ted to their company, and was aware OF
their hiding-place. He was regarded a.
q SPY in the camp. He and Jesse had
disagreed, and on that account his life
was attempted. lie had met the party
at Short Creek, where they were lurk-
ging. nediiating another raid, at the
time that Shepherd came to grief.


SHEPHERDS STORY.


He told the following story Of his adj
venture: Mike and Tom Casey, another
man and mvself, set out yesterday to
capture the gang. They were to 81 crete

retreat. The rest OF the gang, II was ex-
pected, would pursue me, and In that
way be drawn into the ambuscade
where my companions were IN waiting.

said. Jessie, YOU know YOU robbed my
cousin and murdered him Jesse moved
his hand toword his pistol and wheeled
about his horse. | then fired, hitting
him in the back of the head, and he fell
headlong TO the ground. ! then put
spurs to my horse and fled. jim Cum

me. During our fight several shots were
exchanged. Cummings mad the tieetest

the fire, and one Of my shots struck
Cummings in the arm and knocked the
pistol from his hand. With that he
wheeled his horse and went back""


Upon receipt of the above information
there was much rejoicing, as II was sup

ed. A heavily armed posse went out
the following morning to scour the Short
Creek district, but without meeting with
success. Jesse james, the wounded

and subsequently made his headquar-

with a small following, still remain, med

A bright mulatto negro, Columbus
Christian, twenty-five years old, was
lynched about ten miles from this place
by party of men from the community
for committing an outrage on Miss Miller,
beautiful and respectable young lady.
The circumstances are as follows:-There
was party in the neighborhood. This
negro came to her house, and introduc-
ing himself as the son of white man in
the neighborhood, said he was sent to es-
cort her to the party. She, after hesitating,
agreed to go, and accompanied by her
young brother went with him. Discover
ing, after proceeding short distance,
that he was a negro, she fled back to her
house pursued by the negro, who, after
threatening her aged parents with pis.
tol, again carried her off and outraged
her. He fed to Lexington, was pursued
and brought back by guard of five men,
and while on the road was lynched by
about forty persons, some of them were
supposed to be negroes. Shots were
exchanged with the guards and several
were thrown from their horses. No one
was seriously hurt. The sympathy of the
community is with the lynchers."

about 500 spectators. The attendance would
have been larger had not the threatening
clouds deferred many from venturing out to
the grounds, The game opened well for Il
close contest, but in the third innings the vis-
itors got caught in the field in the shower and
the Nationals had obtained five runs before
time was called. After the rain when play
was resumed the feldcrs found it hard work
to keep their feet. Many errors were commit
ted, and it was unfair to judge Of tho ability
Of players. The home club had the advantage
in being able to hit the PhiIadelphias' pitcher
which the visitors could not do with Lynch.
The same clubs will play again this afternoon,
and as the ground will be dry, much better
exhibition and closer contest is expected.

 the Indtamss

 WASHINGTON, Jan. S.-A dispatch was re- ceived to-day by Secretary Schurz from Gen. eral Adams, dated Lakin, Kansas, saying that the Utes were on their way to Washington. The military were dismissed at Lakin.

 The knowledge that the female captives taken at the White River Agency were out ragged by the Indians has created profound sensation here, and of course hurts the Ute case before the department. The facts were known by persons having inside information all along, and these persons are objects of some criticism now for withholding informa- tion so essential to just popular estimate of the situation. The public will now stop talk ing about the 'schivalrous"" Utes.

 PUEBLO, Col Jan. S.-Twelve Ute Indians, in charge of Lieutenant Taylor of the Ninth cavalry with ten men, arrived here yesterday, and immediately went east on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe road. They had ordered dinner at the Union Depot Hotel, but the sight of a large crowd of palefaces destroyed their appetites, and they at once boarded 8 train and left without eating. Between 2,OO0 and g, ,OOO people congregated at the depot to see the sayaQes. ssHang the red devils i' ssShoot the murdering iends!"" and like expres- sfons were frequently heard from a portion of the crowd, and the Indians were pelted ] with stove coal by some boys who had board ed 8 coal train on the side track. The sav- ages were terror stricken, as might be ex- | pected move was afoot in the morning to organize 500 men and lynch them; but cooler counsels prevailed, and the citizens deter mined to let the Indians pass without injury. Had there been any injudicious action taken l by the troops or miners, no power could have

 restrained the mob from lynching them. Had l Douglas or any of the Indians engaged in the l murder of MT. Meeker or outraging the l Meeker family been on board the tr ain the ! rope would have come into play."

Murder of q Daring Lad.",,"Murder of n Daring Lad.

 CINCINNATI, Jan. S.-News reached Leba- non, Ky, yesterday, of the killing, by Milton White, aged seventy years, the keeper of a tollgate near MackvilIe, Washington county, of Philip White, boy of seventeen years, on Monday last. There had been a quarrel between the two, who are relatives, and Milton says the boy had threatened his life. On the day of the killing Philip was passing along the turnpike in front of Milton's house, when the latter came to the door with shotgun and said he was going to shoot him. Philip threw open his bosom and told him to fire away, which he at once did, killing the boy instantly. Milton was held for murder, and bail was refused. Fears of lynching are entertained."

1t will be noticed that the return o

this Is interesting. When the POLL

we're but 663. The inspector said
without showing 1t to he q fact, that thre'
double Republican tickets had bee,
cast and he threw them out. The vote

 To OUR LADY READERs.-It fre- qnently happens that the ladies want some article which they cannot find at home, and it becomes necessary to send abroad for it. To any one who may be thus circumstanced we desire to recommend the Purchasing Agency of Mrs. A. B. Sparks, No. 707 Russell Avenue, St. Louis, Mo. Mrs. Sparks is the relict of the late lamented James II. Sparks, editor and proprietor of the Fort Smith Herald for many years. She has gone to St, Louis to educate her daughter, and being in circumstan- ces, financially, which renders 1t ne- cessary for her to use every exertion to meet expenses, has adopted thls means of doing for herself. Mrs. Sparks will send samples of goods and give any information in regard to styl- es, prices 65c. upon receipt of the pro- per postage stamps. Her purchases ex- tend to any article in the market, such as carpets, gloves, ladies underwear, suits and costumes, furs, shoes, glass and china ware, &c. We feel no hesi- tency in guaranteeing that anything entrusted to Mrs. Sparks will meet with prompt and careful attention. Her charges are 5per cent on purchases. | The Arkansas Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church will con vene in the NJ. k. Church in Russell vile, next Wednesday, Feb. 4th, at g., o'clock, A.

New Hampshire -Garfeld's plurality
about 1000. Congressional delegation un-
changed.


New wJersey-Hancock has majority Of
about 1000. The Legislature is Re-
publican, insuring Republican successor to
United States Senator Randolph. The Con-
gressional delegation Is unchanged polit-
ically. Ludlow, Democrat, is elected Gov
ernor by not far from 1 900 majority.


New York-Garfield has carried the State
by an estimated majority of from Il, 900 to
20, 900. The Legislature is Republican in both
branches, thus insuring Republican United
States Senator to succeed Herman. In New
York City Grace, Democrat, is chosen May

North Carolina-Democratic by reduced
majority. The Republicans gain one Con-
gresham, Hubbs in the Second District.

$1,000.


Oregon-Probably Republican by few
hundred majority.


Pennsylvania -Garfeld's majority in the
State is about $1,000. The city of Philadel-
phia gives about q, 900 Republican majority.
The Legislature is Republican, thus insuring
a United States Senator to succeed Wallace.
The Democrats claim net gain of one Con.

Rhode Island -Garfeld's majority 7,410.


South Carolina-The Democrats carry the
State by majority Of about 1900, and elect
solid delegation to Congress.


Tennessee-Chooses Hancock Electors.
Hawkins, Republican, is elected Governor.
Legislature In doubt. In the First Congress.
sional District Pettibone, Rep, is elected
over Taylor, present incumbent, and in the
Tenth District, Casey Young, Democrat, is
beaten by Moore, Republican.


Texas-The Democratic State and National
ticket has about 70, 900 majority, and all six
Congressman are Democrats, being gain
Of one-Shepherd, in the Fifth District.


Vermont Garfield g majority estimated at
$1,000. Republican Congressman all chosen.


Virginia-The regular Democratic ticket
has majority over both the Readjuster and
Republican tickets. The Democrats lose
one Congressman to the Republicans Dez-
endorf, in the Second District), and preba-
'bly two of the Readjusters are chosen-Sto-
vail, in the Fifth, and Paul in the Seventh.


West Virginia a-Hancock's plurality win
be about u 900. The Republicans claim the
election Of Hutchinson to Congress from the
First District, which will be q Republican
gain.


Wisconsin -Garfeld's majority estimated
at 10000. The Congressional delegation
stands SIX Republicans to two Democrats,
Republican gain Of one-Guenther beating
Bouck in the Sixth District.


Dakota Territory-Pettigrew,R Republican,
elected Delegate to Congress.


The Indications are that the Republicans
have made sufficient gains in Congressman
to give them control Of the new House, while
the Senate is not unlikely to be tie, giving
the Vice President the casting vote.

here last night by tho sheriff of Robertson

met Mr.. James McDougal, a lumber mer-
chant of Baltimore of high respectability,
relative of Mrs B j. McGrann, OF
Lancaster, and one of the genial class of
Springs visitors who become generally
known and popular. Mr.. McDougsI has
been an ardent Republican; a demonisc con
dition he reached after starting In life as an
Old Line Wing, and passing thence through
the purgstory OF Douglas Democracy. Mr..
McDougal lost forty thousand and some odd
dollars By the rebellion, circumstance
which may account for some of his
bitterness against the Rebels. They
say he was in danger of being lynched in
the unpstrioic atmosphere Of Baltimore, in
the early days of the rebellion, fact which
l can readily believe, for he evidently is
brim full of strong opinions and plain Ian
guage, and has no disposition to check their
overflow. He told me somsthing which you
will be glad to hear, and which | am sur
prised that We never reed before.


When Mr.. Lincoln issued his Emancipa
tion Proclamation-I believe that was the
occaaon-a deputstion of citizens from Bal
timore went on to Washington to coDgratu-
late him. Mr.. McDougat was of the number.
They speedily got through with their ad-





to leave, with the declaration that they would
not further tTespass upon the Presidents
valuable time.


Take seats, boys take seats"" exclaimed
Mr.. Lincoln as he rang for chairs to be
brought in. ut would be strange il could
not spare q balf hour or an hour for colver-
sation with friends who have come from
Baltimore TO see me""


And the visitors sat down and spent nearly
an hour in conversation. Presently the sub
ject of Generals came up, ana various opin-
ions were expressed ss to who was the ablest
officer on our eide. When a great many
opinions had been given, Mr. Lincoln seid
Gentlemen, in my judgment, you have
not struck the right man yet""
And of course all were anxious to hear
him name the man and asked HIM to do so.
He said:


ut is General Hancock""


The countenancs of his visitors expressed
their surprise, and one of them ventured to
say that be feared Hancock was too rash.


""Yes."" said Mr.. Lincoln. $50 some of the
older Generals have eaid to me, and have
said to them that have watched General
Hancock's conduct very carefully, and
have found that when he goes into action he
| achieves his purpose and comes out with q
smaller list of casualties than any OF them.
Bold he is, but not rash. Why, gentlemen,
do you know what his record was at West
Point?""


| And Mr.. Lincoln went to his book shelf
and taking down an army register, showed
the position in which Hancock had gradu-
sted, ana that, furthermore, in a class that
was one of the most distinguished that had
ever graduated at the Military Academy
/ Continuing to speak of him In the highest
terms, he further said:

Hancock is destined to be one OF the most
distinguished men of the age. Why, when

The bullet raised @ ridge along the skin, the work of which shows to this day. She finally succumbed to superior strength, but to the last maintained the same dare devil, reckless demeanor.

 Having captured the assassins the question now arose, ''What are we to do with them?' some were for taking them back and letting the law take it's course. The advocates of this line of policy were largely in the ninori- ty. There were those among us whose rela- tves had fallen victims to the deadly ham, mers and knives of the watches, and they would not listen to the suggestions of the conservative element. They threatened to do some killing then and there if the demands for instant vengeance were not regarded No one could have offered very strenuous op- position if they had carried out their threats, but it was thought best to do the job up af- ter the most approved form obtaining in the courts presided over by Judge Lynch.

 The prisoners were accordingly arraigned and asked what they had to say in their de- fence. The old woman was sullen and ugly, but the two men showed signs of faltering. Had they been left to themselves they would have made full confessions beyond doubt. The amiable Kate perceived this, and, think ing it would please the vigilantes too much to hear confessions, she fell to cursing her brother and father for their cowardice. Foul CT language was never uttered than came from the lips of this fend No term was too vile to apply to her relatives They took 1t sullenly at first, but soon something of her reckless spirit infused them and they too joined in the tirade. The.chorus of blasphe- my that went up from that hardened lot caused a shudder to run through our party. With death staring them in the face, they united in cursing us and lanenting their ina biity to do us harm. Such malignity never equalled. Even the old woman chipped in occasionally and her appearance indicated Sha IKhn 1f1Ff f1oaf onstration.

 When charged with the murder laid at their doors the answer was curse, followed by more curses, and then volley, fusilade of curses and ribald abuse. Our court went through with the form prescribed and then pronounced sentence of death. The an- nouncement was received with jeers from the hardened criminals, who had determined to brave it out to the last. It was decided that the murderers should be shot, ns it would take too much time to hang them.

 EXECUTION AND BURIAL.

 The was already nearly down and the shadows of approaching night were deepen ing. There on the borders of the forest the cruel killers were tied to saplings and told to prepare for death One of our number, who had not quite forgotten his early education, undertook to offer prayer, but the lovely Kate spat in his face while he was addressing the throne of grace, and he quit right in the

 

 The four died with curses on their lips, hardened and unrepentant to the last. There in that lonely, dismal spot, away beyond the confines of civilization, they met righteous retribution, and their souls, black with crime were sent to meet the Great Judge. Their executioners treated them better than they treated their innocent victims. They were killed quickly and painlessly, not butchered brutally

 To be sure, not much time was wasted in burial, but it was growing late and the vigi- lantes had long ride before them. A hole, made by the displacement of the roots of a fallen cottonwood, was made little larger and deeper and the bodies thrown in and hastily covered with loose earth, rocks and brushwood. This was all there was to the funeral

 On reaching the level again the effects of the Renders were stacked and burned as sort of offering to heaven. We then proceeded northward, separating before reaching the settlement, each seeking his home quietly. There was no blow made about our achieve ment, each man keeping his own counsel The secret was well kept and it was weeks be- fore outsiders stopped proving around in search of the Renders. Those immediately concerned very speedily lost interest in the chase, however, and, though nothing said on the subject it came to be tacitly derstood through Labette and Montgomery counties that it would be waste of time to prosecute inquiry further"

 The Chicago Times publishes the following letter from Oswego, Kan, describing the all legged killing of the Renders written by one who claims to have assisted at the work of vengeance:

 There is no doubt that the Renders are dead They are awfully dead, and their bones are whitened by the processes of na- ture ere this I speak thus decisively because know whereof speak It is not customary for one to boast of acts of lawlessness, and it is not in that spirit that enter upon the re- cital of the last chapter of the bloody career of the brutish Renders. I am prudent enough, too, to wish to hedge myself against possible annoyance, and had I not received your solemn assurance that you will not di- vulge my name, 1t is not unlikely should leave the writing of this scrap of history to other hands When search was ln- stituted for the body of Dr. York, in April, 1873, suspicion was directed toward the Ben ders, and contrary to the general belief a close watch was kept on them for a while They must have been aware of the survell- lance for at the first opportunity they de camped. The report that they took the train at Thayer, a station @ few miles north of Cherryvale and went to Humboldt, from which place they took passage for Texas, IS a mistake. They simply bundled their goods into two wagons and started for Indian Terri tory. They did not proceed ct once to their destination, if, indeed, they had any destina- tion marked out, but crossed over into Mont gomery county and squatted near the Verdi gris river to await developments. The dis tance from their farm was something like twenty miles. John jr., or John ST., made daily trips back to the vicinity of Cherryvale 4oo ro1e y5yo1 fhnI 1nf to return if the excitement should blow over, but if it continued warm they would go on as originally planned. They knew of the dis covery of their crime within an hour after the bodies were dug out of their shallow graves, and they lost no time in striking their tents. They struck out for the west bank of the river and started southward post haste. Their flight soon became panic, and to add to their discontinue one of their wagons broke down. Packing what they could of the load on their horses they piled up what was left, set fire to it and hurried on.

 PURSUIT AND CAPTURE.

 In the meantime vigilance committee had been formed. This move was taken with the greatest secrecy and none but trusty men were admitted to the organization. The ut most circumspection was used for the reason that in new community like this the doubt fuI assistance of suspicious characters was thing to be dreaded The vigilantes did not number more than one hundred men all told, but they meant business, as the sequel prov ed It was my good or bad fortune to be one of the elect Scouts were sent out in all dl- rections, and within forty-eight hours of the departure of the Renders from their camp in the next county, the fact was duly reported to us.

 About forty of us organized into a pursu- ing party and started after the butchers. Once on their trail, we had no difficulty in

 V-fnfh ho1 fa- ken to the open country west of the river, but were keeping within convenient distance of the thick timber that grows in the valley watered by this stream. They were expect ing pursuit, and hoped to escape by losing themselves in this timber. AS we proceeded tho trail freshened, and ere long we came across the half-consumed ruins of the wagon left by the Renders in their flight From the direction they-were taking, it became evident to the mind of those acquainted with the country that they were pointing for that par adise of cutthroats located near the mouth Of the Red fork of the Arkansas The country hereabonts is bleak and desolate region, 1n- fested by horse thieves, half-breed Creeks, PaYnees and Cherokees. Once there they knew they would be safe from pursuit. Even the United States troops have never been able to penetrate that ter-r0 i7ac0graitG. It is safe retreat for the border ruffans, and is known to ba such all through this section of V. distant about one hundred and forty miles from the point where the Verdigris river en- ters Indian Territory. The murderers had about forty miles to travel before reaching the boundary of the Territory, and they were probably twenty miles beyond the line when our scouts caught sight of them. Burdened as they were with much cumbrous baggage, they had not been able to make very great speed, but they used every possible effort to put space behind them. It was about three o'clock on hot, sultry May afternoon that we came in sight of the party. They saw us as soon as we came from cover, and abandon ing everything they broke for the forest They plunged into the woods and scattered We were close upon their heels, however, and they did not succeed in eluding us long The old man and his wife and Kate were un- der arrest in less than hour.

stoned by the recent gale on the lakes was the
loss of the steamer Alpena, bound from Grand
Haven to Chicago. The Inflated vessel left
the former port on Friday night, Oct. Is, with
about eighty people on board, not soul of
whom, it is believed at this writing, is left
to tell the story of the disaster. The Apena
was due at Chicago on Saturday morning, the
16th but the owners Of the vessel and friends
and relatives of those on board did not despair
of her safety for three days after, when the
most indisputable evidences OF the awful fate
that had overtalen them were furnished III the
shape of pieces OF the wreck and stray articles
Of furniture bearing the name of the
Alpena. These were washed ashore III
the vicinity of Holland, Mich, on the east shore
of Lake Michigan and it il the general impress
sion that the steamer met her fate not far from
that point. There were ten carloads Of apples
stored on the main deck OF the Alpena, and the
theory is advanced that when she got into tho
trough of the sea this cargo became unmanage-
able, and pitching from side to side with the
motion of the boat finally rolled her over. Such
a cargo stored i'll that way instead of in the
hold would have tendency to make the boat
top-heavy, and it is not improbable that this il
one Of the causes of the disaster. The finding
of portions OF the piano on the eastern shore
may be taken IA further proof that the NOV
ables on the Alpena were on the rampage.
1t is not unlikely that the Alpenas piano
jumped clear through the side of the cabin in
one of the violent lurches. When heavy body
gets loose on a vessel in a storm it is q terrible
thing, and is sometimes transformed into an ir-
resstlble engine OF destruction. 1t Is also
probable that she became disabled in somo
manner, and thus fell an easy prey TO the an
cry waves. This belief is strengthened by the
story OF tho officers of n schooner, who report
seeing the Alpena off Racine Saturday morn
ing, between 10 and IL o'clock, heading due
west, laboring very hard in the trough
of the sea. They saw no signals of
distress, but supposed from the way the
boat was acting that she was in trouble.

on the lakes for ten years she was rebuilt at
Manitowoc by her present owners, the Good

 CHARLESTON, Dec. 12.-Last Sunday Mir

 Thomas Kennedy, living near Salem, went

 over to his fathers house short distance from his own house, to ask his mother to stay with his wife during his absence. Mrs.

 Kennedy was young lady of only nineteen

 or twenty years of age, intelligent, refined

 and highly respected. When her husband

 left she shut the door and sat by a window to

 write letter to her mother. As she sat there

 she saw in the yard Joe Barnes a colord boy,

 about sixteen years old, who had been em-

 ployed by MT. Kennedy the previous week,

 and she asked him to bring her an armful of

 wood. This boy had been induced by two

 negroes living near by-Vance Brandt and

 his sister Julia, aged respectively eighteen

 and fifteen-to hang around the premises,

 and when Mir. Kennedy left..the place to give

 the signal to Vance and Julia, who kept

 themselves concealed in thicket. This

 couple had heard of MT. Kennedy's inten-

 tion to visit Charleston, and, thinking that

 he would have good deal of money in the

 house, determined to break in and get it.

 When Joe turned to go for the wood he gave the signal and soon met Vance coming into the yard. Vance asked him where Mir. Ken nedy was, and went immediately to the win dow and three times tried to get in, and each time he was showed out by Mrs. Kennedy.

 Finding that he was determined to get in she opened the front door, ran through the yard and was just going through the gate

 when Vance snatched up hoe lying in the yard, overlook her at the gate oT11 Ir11oO bod IA- mercy and told him she would give him all the money she had, if he would only spare her life. He cursed her, and said ''Pse

 been waiting to kill you a long time'' and at that struck her two more blows, in attempt ing to avert which it is supposed her hand was broken. Just then Julia came up with another hoe and severed her head. When MT. Kennedy returned, about three hours afterward, he found his wife lying outside the front gate, mutilated, cold and stiff, her head almost severed in twain. The entire cranium was cut off from ear to ear, leaving the brains scattered around on the ground. A jury of inquest being had returned yer dict, murder in the highest degree by un- known hands"" Several colored persons were arrested on Monday but no clew to their guilt being obtained they were prompt ly released. On Tuesday the colored boy, Joe Barnes, arrested. He showed so much confusion on being questioned as to his whereabouts Sunday, that only few questions served to bring out his full comics sion, from which the above account is taken. The horrible character of the murder awak- ened intense indignation in the neighborhood, and a crowd of 15O white men and 50 colored men assembled to punish the murderers. A cart was obtained, and halters being placed about the necks of the prisoners and tied to the limb of tree, the cart was driven from under and the trio were soon dangling in the air. expiating the most cold blooded murder ever committed in this vicinity"

in searching fer them found the trail,
and in connection with it was the foot
print of man, which very strong ly
reminded him of villainous looking
Mexican or Greaser Gas they are COM
monty termed, who had been loiter-
ing around the camp for some time,
but was now missing Informing the

out to a man, and in. a short time the
offender was securely bound and lying
upon a table in the nearest saloon
awaiting further orders As the coun-
try was becoming more settled it was
urged and finally decided by some of
the most influential citizens of the
camp to give him the benefit Of a jury
trial, although it was somewhat diff
cult to impanel the jurors, as they pos
itively refused to serve in the capacity,
but with those men, to think was to
act, and the required number Of men
we're soon secured in the street by
main force and placed in the spacious
poker room adjoining the bar-room,
where a brief statement of the case
was made before them. The jury, in
dignant at having anything to do with
the case except to help hang the Of
fender, concluded to veto any more
foolishness of this kind, and thereafter
teach the citizens of that camp better
than to allow a horse thief such honors,
consequently when the door was open
ed and the outsiders crowded around
eager to hear the verdict, the foreman
replied promptly, ""Not Guilty"" Amid
a perfect volIey Of oaths the door was
slammed and they were informed
Through the key-hole) that they would
have to ""do better than that"" or re-
main there their natural existence.
Consequently they decided the matter
and verdict of guilty was immediate
ly rendered. when they were invited
out to ""drink to the Mexican's future
happiness"" for they had hung him an
hour before. Twelve more indignant
men than those jurors it would have
been hard to find in Nevada at that

 105. General George s. Beal of Portland,

 was elected Adjutant General, he receiving 95

 votes to for s. J. Gallagher. The Repubi-

 can Legislature adjourned at o'clock until 10

 o'clock tomorrow morning.

 Governor Davis telegraphed this morning

 to all the military companies of the State to

 test their feelings. The purpose of this or

 der was that commanding officers of compa-

 nies should report to headquarters every

 morning, and if at any time the tele-

 graph wires were cut to start with

 their companies for Augusta by rail

 One of the first companies to re-

 spond was the Montgomery Guards. One

 of the Portland companies, composed of Irish-

 Americans who are Democrats, Captain Lynch

 commanding, reports that he recognizes the

 powers that be. The Acting Adjutant Gen

 eral has secured possession of the bills and

 pay roll of the armed guard placed over the

 State House. Secretary of State Chadbourne

 sent communication to the Legislature an-

 nouncing that the State seal has not been

 turned over to him and returns of votes are not on file.

 All the indications tonight point to peaceful settlement of the existing difficult ties The action of the fusionists, under the lead of Governor Smith and Secretary of State Sawyer, makes this possible. When the hour for the meeting of the fusion Legis- lature arrived all the members who are in town were assembled in front of the State House warmly seeking admission. Charles E.. Nash, Mayor of Augusta, supported by Chief of Police Charles White and a special guard, stood at the entrance to the Capitol grounds and forbade anybody to enter, even with pass or certificate of membership in the Legislature. Senator Strickland first applied for admission and was refused. A few minutes later Speaker John O. Talbot and President of the Senate Lamson, followed by MT. Gibbs, clerk of the House, with the official records under his arms, approached Nash, a crowd gathering around. As they drew near Talbot said tI demand admission as Speaker of the House of Representatives. 'I am di- rected by Governor Davis to say that the State House is closed to the public this afternoon"" replied Nash, 'sas no public business is being transacted in any of the departments ""I demand entrance as member of the House."" said Talbot. 'ssMy orders are peremptory,"" was the reply. q have no discretion in the matter, but I will, with pleasure, forward any communication in writing to Gov ernor Davis which you may wish to make"" ''Who are you ?"" asked Talbot My name is Charles B. Nash,"" replied the Mayor. Talbot | antly, ''We don't propose to resist"" Lamson | then demanded admission as President of the | Senate. Nash informed him that the State | House was closed to the public by order of ! Governor Davis. s'Then demand admission | as member of the Senate"" continued Lam my orders are peremptory and allow me no l discretion. The State House is closed to all ! persons except heads and officers of depart ments and officers of the law,'' was the l Mayors response. tiff you have any commu- | nication in writing to make, will have it | forwarded"" Iamson then stepped aside and ! Governor Smith stepped quickly forward as if | about to brush away every obstacle in his | path. Chief White stopped him and Smith | Raid peremptorily, sI want to go in."" q cannot permit you to pass"" explained cn' on his s face. ""By. what ~ authority demanded Smith. s'That of Gov. Davis,' ! Nash. 'He has ordered the State | House to be closed to the public as no public | business is being done either in the Secretary | of States office, the Treasury or Council | ''Who are you ?"" asked Smith. | During the time thus consumed, the crowd | was constantly increased. Nearly five hum | dred were in the vicinity, mostly Republicans. | Nash called on the officers to clear the streets, but the fusionists held their ground, pushing | to the front as much as possible. Speaker l Talbot then mounted on the stone curbipg | about the grounds holding on by the fence, | and called the House to order, explaining that l they were as near the place of their last | meeting as they could get. Thomas Plaisted, | of Lincoln, then stood up in sleigh, of- | fered an order that with the Senate concur l ring they adjourn to meet at Union Hall at 10 I o clock tomorrow forenoon. President Lam | son put the order to the Senate. It was con- l cured in and the members dispersed slowly.

 Governor Smith said his intention was to | use no force to regain possession of the Capi tol, but seek to have his title established in | court. He believed the fusionists were agreed | on this general plan. The fusion members | were not only refused at the appointed time | for their meeting, but throughout the day. | Senator Lsmson walked from the Augusta | House to the State House early in the after | noon in company with Representative Stroul, | of Portland. On the way the latter informed | Lamson that it had been decided not to allow l them to meet, and advised to stay away. l Lamson retorted that he would pay whatever | Stroul chose to ask for the advice, but should | do as he thought best. When he arrived at | the gate Stroul was allowed to enter without | question, saying he was going after his pen, but Lamson was stopped He told the guard | ha vraa a Sanator- aiaof fr01o Soyadahno ty, that his election was not disputed, and he | held certificate. Still he was refused admis | sion and Senator Nash Barker coming up at | that moment met similar reception.

 Judge J.. Libby, of the Supreme Court is 1 of the opinion that the court should take into l the questions submitted by the | fusion Legislature If the latter so desires but | speaks for hims-f only, and does not pro- | fess to know the opinion of his associates.

 The order published in some quarters to | day purporting to come from Governor Smith, l calling upon the Portland Montgomery | Guards, Mechanic Blues and Biddeford Light l Infantry to report in this city immediately, | fully armed and equipped, with rations for | three days, is pronounced forgery. Smith | and Folsom, his adjutant general, say they | have not even taken such steps into serious | consideration. The only order issued by | Smith was that relieving Chamberlain from duty. Governor Davis, however, has the military under orders to be ready to move at moments n9tice. The Capital Guards, of this city, remain in their armory day and night.

 Treasurer White will not give up anything to the Republicans until they have secured final decision in their favor in the courts. To night he issued the following order, which explains itself: To William Caldwell and John W. Foglee,

 Clerks in the Office of the State Treasurer

 You are instructed and ordered not to honor any demands for the payment of money from the Treasury coming from or issued by au- thority of the other bogus Legislature now claiming to be the Legislature of tho State un- til you are further advised by me.

 (Signed) O. A. WHITE, Treasurer.

The Game in Baltimore NEUTRALITY-SUSPICIOUS.


Treatment",,"Especial Dispatch TO THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN,


BALTIMORE, Md, May 20, 1880.


It would be difficult to find meaner, poorer
or more uninteresting game than the Que
played here to-day between the Baltimore and
National clubs. 1t would also be hard to find
more biased crowd than tho one assembled
on the grounds to witness the contest. Not
content with cheering the homo players at
every opportunity, whether it was for an
ordinary piece of fielding or something fine,
they manifested their ugly tempers by insult
ing the visiting nine, yelling and hooting at
every player in his attempts to catch or field
a ball, aud when that did not work they
turned their attention to the umpire. Prob
ably Mr. Latham like most every other gentle
man that tries 1t, has au abundance of um-
pring in Baltimore. In both games he has
been, if anything, partial to the home club,
still that did not content the bolster
Gus spectators, who probably would only
have been satisfied by his declaring the
games in favor OF tho Baltimorcs before they
wero played. Umpires can rest assured that
they will have no pleasant task In filling that
position in this city when the Baltimore club
participate in a match If their players do
not quarrel with browbeat and try to bully
him he can rest assured that he will be bull
dozed by the rabble attending the games 1t
is only just to say that many respectable peo-
pie attending at Ncwingon park deplore
tlllS STATE Oh aHalrS, DuV are poWerlehS 10 reuu-
edy it.


The Nationals having pounded Critchley
pretty sevcrly the directors concluded to sub
stitutc Myers in the Baltimore niue and he
occupied the pitchers position, but he did not
pitch. Much has been said about Lynch's
straight-out, shoulder delivery, bot Myers
beats it ALL He did not make any prctense
of pitching. The first ball that he sent over
the home plato was thrown, aud he kept 1t up
10 the termination of the game.


1t was laughable to hear the ignoramuses on
the seats yelling out against Lynch and then
speak of ""tho magnificent pitching Of Myers""
Their ignorance could not have been more
quickly or better shown than by listening to
their comments upon the game. The Nationals
hit Myers style Of throwing for six bases, and
Lynch was batted for the same number, but
only one run was earned Brouthcrs made it..
He hit long ball almost to the centre-leld
fence for clean home run.
The errors on the part of the Nationals, as
usual, were tho most expensive, generally
yielding one or two runs to their opponents,
while those committed by tho other side did
little more than give a base. Mcclellan,
Powell, Snyder and Lynch were the only ones
to escape errors on the National side, while
Burchell aud Hawcs, of the Baltimores, had
the same good fortune.


1t is being rumorcd here, and seems to come
| from reliable source, that the Baltimore club
has released Mr.. Horace B. Phillips, the man.
ager and will make other arrangements for
| running the club.

THE MASTERS STORY.


New York, July 17.-Investigation into
the sinking of the steamer Narragansett OF
the Stonington line, by her sister boat, the
Stonington, began to-day. Smith Young OF
Jersey City, pilot for twenty-five years and
at the time of collision, master of the Nara
gansett, told the story of the disaster the
night of June 10th, $780, and of the efforts
of himself, officers and crew to save life. Ii
was the first time he had been in command.
The reason or idea got abroad that the Off
Gers did not assist in launching boats was
that they were not in uniform, being called
up suddenly and therefore were not rccog-
nized as such by the passengers.


The examination of Supt. Young was
postponed until Monday, in consequence OF
an attack of chills and fever.


Mr.. Finckls, acting chief engineer of the
Narragansett at time of the disaster, was ex-
amined, and testified that he had license
only to act as assistant engineer.


Capt. Nye of the Stonington, said at one
time he expected to heave-to and beach his
boat, it was leaking so badly.

vile special this afternoon: A miner

He demanded of a clerk revolver out Of

revolver out of his pocket, threatening every
one in the store. Policeman John Corbel at
tempted to arrest him and Baker told
him to stand back. Corbel rushed
at Baker, and Baker fired wounding him
mortally, and then rushed up the street,
several policemen following. Policeman
Stewart closed with Baker, who fired, fatally
wounding Stewart and slightly wounding
another policeman. Baker was then over
powered and jailed. Policemen are heading
large crowd, and it is probable Boxer will
be lynched before morning.

surviving principal in the recent duel, was
before Judge Iver, of the State supreme
court, at Cheraw, last evening, on writ of
habeas corpus, and was admitted to bail in
$4,000. Considerable excitement was oc-
casioned in Cheraw, previous TO the hearing
of the application, by an attack made by
son of Col. Cash upon Mr.. Pegnes, editor of
the Cheraw lSetn, who had denounced the
duel in his paper. Young Cash and his
father had both drawn their pistols, the lat
ter avowing his intention to see fair fight,

constantly occurring among them, when
Congress refuses to provide for their pro-

yet Judge Lynch is not desirable resort
for Furnishing crime. 1t is better to give

The bourbons Of tho sixth congressional
district of Virginia are somewhat excited
over the discovered fact, asthey allege, that
an iron firm in Pennsylvania has forwarded
to Mr.. FRAZER 500 to he used to forward his
interests as the readiuster candidate for
congress, this act Of generosity being
prompted by the other admitted fhct that
Mr.. FRAZER adheres strongly to the policy
of y protective tariff Whe ther this allie
cation has any foundation in fact is not
evidenced at all by its being stated in u
bourbon journal, but if 1t be true, it only
establishes the fact that American manu-
f,cturers are alarmed by the declaration of
he democratic party that it is In favor of
a tariff for revenue 0nly. What this decara-
tion means every manufacturer in the
country understands at glance. 1t is the
entering wedge of free trade, and menaces
the manufacturing interests of the United
states with more ultimate danger than any
thing that has occurred in fifty years If
the people of Virginia are truo to the in





torcsts Of their state; if they desire to ex-
pand its prosperity by developing its mines
and fostering its manufactures, they will
vote solid against party which is plotting
to straugle its struggling manufacturing
enterprises. Virginia is capable Of be-
coming one of the most prosperous manu-
featuring states in tho union. Her vast
resources in minerals her eXhaustloss
water power her commercial advantages,
her climate, her soil, and all the advnn-
tages and blessings conferred upon her by n
wise and beneiicent Creator, all point TO
this as her destiny, if the fostering influ-
ence of protective tariff is continued. 1t
is not strange, then, that the old dominion
should begin to consider and provide for
her future.


The Lynchburg Vigiaidn, which has be-
come seriously alarmed on the tariff ques-
tion, essays an argument in favor of light
duty OH foreign iron rs stimulating in
iluence under which Virginia mauuiac-
turing establishments would be builded
and made successful. That we may not be
chargeable with Misrepresentation, we ex-
tract its own utterance:


Aud now we invite the consideration Of the
people of this cong ressional district 10 few
facts relating especially to the iron interest.
We see crude ores taken from all the counties
round about us aud transported hundreds of
miles to be manufactured into iron by the
Pennsylvania masters And here the qaes-
tion naturally arises: If our ores will bear
transportation to remote points could they not
be manufactured into iron moro chcaply If
the furnaces were located where tho ore Is
found? Mr.. TUCKER and every person OF
ordinary sagacity knows that they could he,
and that the heavy duty of S2S pcr ton on
steel rails enables the Pennsylvanians to
transport our ores to their furnaces, already
constructed, when, If the duty were light, it
would nure to tho benefit of Virginia in
compelling them to erect furnaces here, where
iron can be manufactured more cheaply by
far than in Pennsylvania.


This logic should be scrutinized if it is
not too thin to hold together under such q
process. 1t occurs to us that tho heavy
duty Of S2S per ton on steel rails"" inures
10 more to the benefit of Pennsylvania
than to Virginia, provided the latter state
which is full of rich ores, had the capital
and enterprise to work its own ores al
home instead of transporting them to Penn
sylvania to find market for the raw
material. But for protection the fires o
the blast furnaces Of the country would br
extinguished. Admit foreign iron free o
duty and our manufactures would competr
with the unrequited labor of Europe ant
would assured!y die. Then Virginia woult
! find no market for its ores anywhere. They
would sleep in the bosom of the earth un
molested and rs valuelcss as so much i'm
bedded rock 1t is the protective taril
TINT stands between our manufacturing
| interests and inevitable ruin, for all eX
peri ence teaches the lesson that we cOulC
not compete with Europe and its cheal
labor, if its products were admitted free o
duty, except by reducing the standard o
labor and its compensation in this countr.
to that of the old world.


This is not wise, Meth er is it just to th
laboring classes of the United States. Thi
being the democratic policy, the workers o
this country should know it. 1t woulC
reduce their compensation to the Europeal
standard, while the republican policy is t.
afford labor its fair rev ards, and thus Sc
cure TO the rich and poor corresponding
benefits. For that reason we are oppose,
to the democratic policy and sustain tina
rof the republican party. We cannot con
sent to place our manufacturing interest
where, as a question of life and death 70
themselves, they would be forced TO cut tn
rewards of labor down to the Europea
standard, where the worker has no bette
prospect for himself and his family than
perpetual estate of extreme poverty.

ders introduced bill to abolish all the
duties on the importation of salt. Mr..
Garland introduced a bill to extend the
time for the completion eff the Texas and

the following:


Resolved, That the president he respect
fully requested, if in his Judgement not
incompatible with the public interests,
to communicate to the senate any infor-
nation in the possession of the govern
ment touching on the alleged false stat
lstics and false testimony imposed upon
the Halifax commission, and used as a
basis of their award in the matter of the
fisheries.


The bill granting pension to Herman
Netterield, but reported adversely by
Mr.. ingalls, from the committee on pen
sions, was taken up. Netterneld was
citizen scout, acting under military
orders when he was disabled. The dis
cussion of this bill was upon the point
whether scouts with the army should be
paid pensions the same as soldiers dis
abled, and was interrupted by the morn
ing hour expiring, when consideration
was resumed of the bill for the ascer-
tainment Of the amount of land located
on military warrants, and for the pay
ment of per cent. of its value to various
states named, and Mcdonald continued
his speech in favor of the bill.

tionaI Club, SO.

Tho Nntionnls for 1880.",,"outdoor sports can be fully enjoyed, although
It might truly be said that there has been
fow days during this winter when tho lovers
of ball. cricket or crcquet could not have in
tulged themselves in either Of these pastimes
to their hearts content. The mild and open
weather conduces to the belief tlat the spring
will also be forward, and that tho only dangers
to be feared Is from too much rain rather than
The cold. There being no wntor to break up,
as consequence the advent Of spring promises
10 be felt within the next month No person
watches the weather and the representations
moro steadily and closely than the ball-playcr,
especially he who has an engagement 10 play
with some club for the scason of 1850. He
anticipates by the sign of carly spring
that ho will receive notice to report
for duty sooner than he would If
1t were backward, and he feels better satisfied
when tho notification comes, because he is
then confident that the engagement will
prove n certainty. While there are so many
good ball-players idle, in search Of places, only
the cream of the profession feel secure that
they will not bo deposed The others incline
to timidity and gather remarkable courage
when placed in harness preparatory 10 playing,
for this is sufficient sign of their retention.
The National Club Of this city organized last
fall on thorough business basis und deter
mined to place representative nne In the
field that Washington might DO proud of
The association was regularly incorporated,
elected its officers, secured its constitution and
bylaws and then those entrusted with the
duty TO select the players to comprise the team
for tho season of 1880 went to work. They had
n large field from which to choose land fter oh.
serving much caro- in their selections, gathered
together the following players Charles N.
Bnydor, late of the Bostons, catcher and cap.
tain; Joseph Gerhardt, late of the Cincinnats,
second bascman Frederick j. Warner late of
tile Clcveands third baseman Stephen j.
Dgnnn, late of the Brocktons, loft fielder,
aud John Lynch, pitcher; William II. Me-
Clollan, shOrt-stop; Philip Baker, centre field;
George II. Derby, right flold; George Latham,
frst baseman, and Samuel Trott, change
catcher all of last years nine. II Is
looked upon as one of tho strongest teams in
the country belonging to either association.
A majority of these players enjoy the facility
Ofbeing able TO play in more than one posi-
lion. Lynch and Derby are the pitchers, aud
can take tho bases, while Snyder, Trott and
Baker fill the catchers position Dgnan, in
addition to out-hclding, makes good short
stop, rs docs Warner Mcclellan finds no
trouble in playing third base or tho field
Baker and Trott are capital first basemon
while Latham is known TO have done effective
work ut tho second. Gerhardt is n No.
j third basoman, and made himself a
good record during the time he occupied that
position with the Cincinnati nine last season.
while Mt the second he cannot be excelled. OF
Snydcr's worth behind the bat little need be
said, for his reputation as the leading catcher
Of the country has stood for years. and cannot
be contradicted with truth. Both of the last
two-named players are natives of this city.
Their career has been watched for yoars in
playing away from home, and their friends
have always rejoiced at their success. Now
their felow-townsmen will be given an oppor-
tunity to witness tbeii skillin handling the
sphere, and know the correctness of tho fame
earned. Warner is native Of Philadelphia

preciatlng his merits as a player, succeeded
in securing him to command tho third

comes from a semi-professiona nine. While
not having played directly with an assoca
tion or League club, still he has played against
many one of them, and showed himself tC
be valuable man for any nine. He played
with the Bostons late last year against the
Worcesters, and pounded the phenomena

THE SIXTH VIRGINIA DISTRICT.


When we venturcd suggestion in re-
gard TO tie sixth Virginia district we had
no thought of stirring up the yials of wrath
which the Bynchburg Vbginian keeps
stored away in its laboratory Of discomfort
and hate for those who offend against its
superior wisdom and patriotism. But so
IL is Its anathemas fall upon us MS the
rain upon the mOwn grass. The most
ludicrous part of its performance, however,
is where IL claims superior honesty for the
funders rs debt-paying party. This caps
the climax of aIisurdity. Nowhere in his
tory does it appear that the funder party of
Virginia has given anything like an earnest
of its purpose to pay any of the public debt
when it had control of tho affairs of the
state. The nearest IL has come to any
thing of the kind was when it robbed the
school-fund of the state that had been
sacredly dedicated to the purpose of edu-
eating its children and diverted that fund
to illegitimate purposes. If this is honest,
If this is in the interest Of right and justice,
- 'HNh ~ INV VI HoiiNg ipbho "" wv hNAiN'N
payment of The debts of Virginia, then the
funders aud their Lynchburg organ can lay
claims to superior honesty relating TO the
liquidation of the state indebtedness and
not without, for when that party was in
full power, instead of providing in any
degree for the honest payment of the state
debt it merely deprecated upon the cdu-
cational funds Of the state and left the debt
10 take care of itself Such policy will
not go fur in establishing a reputation for
superior honesty. 1t is for these reasons
that We desire to see the funder party
wiped out as mere hypocritical pretender,
and it is for this reason that the people
will in this contest rise up in their might
and relegate Mr.. TUCKER to private life in
the pending contest for n representative
in congress from that district. We SYM
pathize with such n prospect, and this is
The measure of our ofiense, which calls
down upon THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN
the condign displeasure of our Lynchburg
cotemporary. So mote it be."

About 8 o'clock last Sunday night,

ted estimated Mt one hundred
and fifty--appearcd in this town, and
Immediately sought to obtain entrance
to the parish jail. When they de-
manded the key of Sheriff Mix, no
refused to give it to them, and So
cretly transferred it to Mr.. l.. w.
Strader. The strangers learned this
fact from some unknown source, and
by threats and force obliged Mr.. s. to
admit them to the jail. They took
from the dungeons six prisoners, viz :
Harrison johnson and Perry Will
liams, under charge of lobbing and
numbering r, j. Phillips, ION the Oath
instant; Paul Aprils and Ben McCay,
implicated in said crime George Car
roll, under conviction tol the murder
Of his wife, Nov. S, 1877; and Dick
Smith, awaiting trial tor murder.
These men were marched, up Duncan
Avenue by the armed strangers, the
whole party haltinga few steps from
the residence of Mr.. Vanhouten, on
the avenue. A squad Of the stran-
gers remained on the streets, appar-
emily patroling or searching.


Some of the armed me, then put q
line on the neck of Dick Smith and
swung him up to pine sappling.
He was not shot, but died hanging.


Harrison Johnson next received tho
attention of the lynchcrs. He was
hung up by the neck, after which n
shower of lead was fired into his body
and head. George Carol and Perry
Williams were treated in like man
ner.


Paul April and Ben McCay were
permitted to escape, as it was believ-
ed they were innocent of tho accusa-
ton against them. o


Having finished their intended
work, the mob departed, leaving the
corpses on tho spot.


r. w. Read, Justice of the Peace,
was notified of the affair, antl held an
inquest over the four bodies. Sever
al young men, residing here, who
were lockers on at the lynching, gave
testimony before the Coroncr's jury,
substantially in accord with the
above statement, and the jury gave
verdict consistent With the facts in
the case.


oSome of the witnesses stated that
when Dick Smith had been hung up,
he was then let down and confessed
his guilt of the crime he has been
charged with. That Johnson and
Williams also confessed the truth of
the charge against them, but Carroll
denied his guilt.


We arc informed by q resident of
Arcola that body Of men, mounted
and armed, passed through that
place coming South, Sunday evening.
1t is supposed thelynchcrs came from
the upper part ofSt. Helena and Tan
gipahoa parishers, and from across
the State line.


Very few of our citizensd knew any
thing of the nights tragedy until
morning.


We expect to have other particu-

now fully convinced that the booted

popularity is the very element which
the Democratic party is dependent

success. Without it they could never
succeed and to c3nciliate 1t has been
their chief aim. The Colonel is an
Irishmen and a Catholic. These are no
Feproach to him. He is not aceourta-
BILE for the first, and as the latter is his
free . untramelled ckoioe he deserves
credit for making it. One half of the
Democratic party Of Wilmington and at
least one-third of it in the county is
composed of Irish Catholics. From
time immemorial they have been the
hewers of wood and the drawers Of
water of the party, and like such labor

none of this race or religion have been

party. When they were successful the
menial places in the party have al

them. They make good policemen and
occasionally they are allowed to be
elected to the City Council, but thus
far and go farther are they allowed to
rise.


Their stbree thousand votes in the
county are very acceptable to the Demo-
cratic party, in fsct they must have
them; they cannot do without them.
Col. Thomas Ford knows this and lie ia

latter refused to part with the hard earned
savings which he had laid up for rainy
day Determined to get the little treasure,
John Waibel conceived the murder OF his
brothers family, and In the dead OF night
perpetrated it in cold blood. lie PROVIDED
himself with hammer and an axe, and
stealing upon the slumbering mehbers OF
the family, strewed the floor with their
crushed and mangled corpses. Then he
burst open the bureau drawers and ran
sacked the place till he found the treasure,
and fled. He had not been gone long when
the neighbors discovered the wholesale
murder and notified the police. The sight
that met the gaze of the officers when they
entered Waibel's dwelling, was a CHASTITY
one. Mrs. Waibei had been slain on the
lounge in the sitting-room her head was
beaten and cut into an unrecognizable
pulpy mass. There were thirty eight
wounds on her skull, representing so many
blows from the axe. The innocent babe
had not been spared it was dead In its
cradle--lts skull fractured by blow OF the
hammer On the threshold leading to the
sleeping room lay the bent body OF the
husband, whose skull was split open by
two tremendous blows of the axe. Bloody
marks on the wall indicated the struggle
between the murderer and his victim, and
blood pools were everywhere. The corpse
of child three years of age was found,
with the skull fractured, in the sleeping
room asthffd child, about SIX years old,
was breathing yet, but its injuries were
such that death ensued in the course OF
few hours.


The oldest child, girl of thirteen years,
was left to tell in part the bloody tale.
She had been wounded, but not fatally.
She said that her uncle was the murderer
of the family. Police inspector Kern
learned that at 8 o'clock in the morning q
man answering the description of Walbel
had bought pair of stockings and suspen-
ders in Bender's store, in k9nigstrasse.
An expressman named Zahner told him
that man on leaving the store entered an
eating house in .Weinstrasse, where the
fare did not suit him. He inquired or
.Zahner for better place, where he could
get all he ordered. Zahner recommended
him to Bardili's restaurant in Tuebinger
strasse. Thither repaired Inspector Kern,
accompanied by Zahner, and found man
enjoying good breakfast. He was cleanly
shaved and had slight abrasion OF the
skin ON the right cheek. lie looked just
like the man the Inspector was after. On
being questioned he gave the name OF hurz,
and pretended to be business man from
Hall. The inspector said: ""that is not 90;
your name is Waibel, not Kurz, and you
are wanted for five-fold murder. You are
my prisoner"" Waibel threatened and bull
| lied; but the inspector put the handcufts
| on him and paid no attention to his protest.


He was dressed in @ suit belonging to his
murdered brother, and his undergarn.e ents
and his naked feet were spotted with blood.
He was taken in coach to the house in


which the butchery occurred, after he had


been dressed in the striped garb OF q
prisoner An excited crowd filled the
street. AS the murderer appeared they be-
came furious, and threats of lynching were
made. They rushed at the vehicle and


tried to drag him out, but strong guard
of police protected him from personal vio-
lence. When he alighted from the coach


he laughed sneeringly at the spectators


Even the coolest among them could no


longer control themselves; the outburst OF
indignation was terrific. The crowd


shouted, ""No mercy to the brute !"" 'Kill
him - ""Tear him to pieces"" !"" When the


prisoner viewed the dead bodies in the


presence of police and court officials ne ex-


pressed no regret, but looked with repul-


sive smile at the bodies of the three infants
and denied his guilt. Then he turned on


his heel, snapped his fingers and said with
a sneer, ""Pshaw, I've seen such sights
often before"" When he was placed in the


coach again he grinned once more at the
infuriated crowd. 1t was with the great


est difficulty that the police succeeded In


taking their prisoner safely to Jail, where


he is now awaiting trial."

fresh, cool breath you poor mortals in
Wilmington. am sorry for you but
can't help you out Of the heat. I am
spending my summer with my family
in Lost Cannon 10 miles from and
1000 feet above Gunnison City. In
our bed room we have large fire
place in which we build huge fire
every evening, and near that fire we
sleep under three and four blankets,
and in the morning have heavy win
ter frost and ice on the water bucket
in the porch, yet the grass grows most
luxuriantly and the mountains are
covered with the rarest flowers.


Gunnison City has grown from the
mountain camp 1T was last March, to
city. Main street is built up with
good business houses for over half
mile, and from the post Office on Main
street west on New York avenue to
the depot you can now find large ho-
tells and elegant stores for over one
mile. The court house is about finish
ed; it is a fine stone and brick build
ing. Curran's Hotel is rs feet front
ON New York avenue and the same on
11th street. The Gunnison House and
the Red Lion ON Main street, and
Myers European on New York ave-
nue. are each as large as any house in
Wilmington except the Clayton; and
so men are now at work ON the Grand
Hotel, which is 150 feet front ON Main
street and 200 feet ON Virginia avenue
three stories high of white sand stone.

orado, and he is said to be backed by
MIR. Loveland the Colorado Railroad
King, who has his eye on the Cover
nor's chair. You know that money
and editors can do it Tor any of them.
The Gunnison CityStreet Railway has
just been incorporated and Main street
is to be connected with the depot by
street cars. In word we soon will
have every thing that pertains to a
first class city. The post Office now
ranks as a second class Office.


The mines of Qunnison county are
turning out all and more than was ex-
pected of them and large number of
big strikes have been made this season

who disappeared from Evansville, Ind,
says dispatch from that city, March
2nd, were found about noon yesterday,
lying dead within 500 yards of the house
of a man named Butler, about four miles
above the city on the Kentucky side
They had evidently got belated and lost
their way, and wandered about in the
mud, wet and cold until exhausted.
Three shots were heard that night
about 9 O'Clock, in the direc-
tion they were found, and their guns
had three barrels discharged. They were
tracked to drift.pile, which they had
crossed and gone about Seventy yards
towards Buffers house, When they got
bewildered and turned on, their tracks,
and, going back few steps, threw down
their guns within five feet of the drift
pile. Ruston fell on his face in the mire,
and Knox, with heroic effort, turned his
expiring friend on his back, tenderly
placed a pillow of cornstalks under his
head, and then crawled up on the crift
and died. A faithful dog stood watch by
them probably for thirty six hours, and
when found would allow no one to touch
them until an acquaintance came up and
pacitied him. The young men bore ex-
emplary characters, and were universally y
esteemed. Ruston was Superintendent
Of the Mission Sunday school of a Cum
berland Presbyterian Church, and Knox
was also consistent young Christian.
Ruston was about ""a years old, and
leaves wife and one child. Knox was
about 81. Few events have created more
intense interest or more general sym.
pathy than is felt for the bereaved famil-
les."

CRIME.",BALTIMORE. August,"BALTIMORE, August 2, 1880.


Michael O'Hara, well known
citizen, was arrested to-day on a SER
ious charge, Mrs. Moore, about thir-
ty years of age, accusing him of hav-
ing outrageously assaulted her. She
says that on last Thursday O'Hara
came to her home in Dorchester
county. She had occasion to visit
her bedroom when O'Hara unknown
to her, followed and entered the
room. He forced her upon bed
and she tainted. When she regain
ed consciousness she saw O'Hara
leaving the room. Her husband
was absent at the time and when he
returned she told him of the affair.""
They both came to the city, where a
warrant was sworn out, and the ac-
cused being arrested was held for a
further hearing. O'Hara states that
the charge has been made for the
purpose of blackmailing.


He is about sixty years of age. On the
day in question he admits going on an
excursion 70 Dorchester county. Knowing
the Moore family be went to their house.
No one was home but Mrs. Moore. He
engaged in friendly conversation with
her and says positively there is not a
word of truth in the story told by the
woman. His friends are very much sur
prised and feel confident that he will
prove his innocence. O'Hara is a native
of Ireland, but has been in this country
for the last twenty-four years. Among
those who know himlwell he bears the r, :
pution of an inOfiensive and quiet in
dividual. He is a married man, but has
| not been living with his wife for s0ma
years. Aftor their separation he went to
the Black Hills region where he engaged
in mining, accumlating some $20,000
Last week he left bis lodgings without
| any explanation. His intention as he
says, was to buy a suitable farm and
give the uperintendence of it to MI.
Moore.


ARREST AND THREATS OF LYNCHING
When told that he was about 10 BE-
arrested and the charge stated he took
II very coolly and asked permission tt
change his attire. The officers granted
the wish. He dressed himself carefully
aud, after having finished, he went Il
his trunk and took out roll of money
amounting to $3.50. Outside of TIE
| house two of Mrs. Moore's brothers
awaited the coming of the prisoner. As
soon as he appeared they made a des
perate effort to get at him, but were
prevented by the policemen."

from assaulting white woman, but the

 In the month of May, 1875, at Crook s Canyon, in this county, Daniel Cannon murdered J. C. Clancy, (not one Dougherty or ODougherty), as stated in the EXpositor. There was no ""lady' in the case whatever. The Tow. directly preceding the killing, was in a saloon. about the sum of one dollar ID game of ""ireeze out"" The parties separated. Cannon going not to get his eff fleets for the purpose Of leaving the camp as stated, but to Dawes store, where, going behind the counter, he took Dawes pistol, and started for the salooa, Clancy remaining @, the saloon. In the meantime some one Of the miners had given Clancy pistol, telling him that Cannon lad gone for six shooter and would shoot him, and to de- fend himself. Clancy was, at this time, In an almost helpless state of intoXicatioD, s.aGding n front of the saloon. Cannon the first shot missing him, bur the second dong its fatal work. When Clancy fell the six-shooter on him dropped to the ground. He never fired a shot, nor even drew the pistol. Cannon was arrested, and barely escaped lynch!ng at the hands of the iniurated miners, not only CIancy's friends. but men who had been his own friends. All that saved him was the seeming certainty of capital punishment by law. Instead of being the friend!ess, penniless man as claimed n the Expostor, John A. Rush was secured for his defense by I retainer of s2j0 cash and the transfer of considerable mining property. Never did an attorney labor more zealously for client than did Judge Rush for Daniel Cannon. The yer l dIct of the jury, 10 tie surpr'se of everybody | who knowing tie circumstances, was for l murder in the second, instead of the first | degree. Judge Tweed, in sentencing the | prisoner for 3i years. told him that he had | escaped the gaIioHs through having a good ! attorney and 8 foolish jury. When Cannon . reached the prison he told Sherff Bowers l that ""he woIli kill some more sons Of b-s who were down on him, Tue yer diet of the people at the time was that Gan mons punishment was too light, and DO have come to light slnce 10 cause them to change that verdict. No Dne not led by fa.sehoods, will ever sign petition for Executive clemency in the case 1f Daniel Cannon.

 The facts as above are given me by two ,ye-witnesses 10 the killing, who are men we'll known and of good standing in this and vouch for the circumstances Is related, and ask you 10 publish this ln 'rder that a man guilty of murder, for which serving lis fuil scntrncC will not De adequate punishment, may not, by de- eiying thc public through the press, be uFned loose upon the community to repeat he crime, ns he has threatened 10 do.

and hang him without giving him a
chance to get lawyer""


BY this time large black heart cherry
tree, which suited the purpose admirably
had been found and Diggs was
notified that his hour had come.
A LAST FIGHT FOR LIFE.
A short rope was produced and three
of the lynchers approached him to pinion
his arme, which up to this time had
been left free, when suddenly the rufian
turned upon his captors. With a
tremendous blow he knocked one Of them
down and quickly seized another by the
throat, checking him until he was nearly
black in the face and compelling to shout
for assistance. When another of the men
attempted to loosen the fellows grasp he
seized him with his teeth by the hand
and bit him severely. BY this time the
crowd closed around him and fighting
with the ferocity of tiger, he was fore
ed to the ground and by sheer force Of
numbers was overpowered. Then his
arms were securely pinioned behind
him and he was raised TO his feet. But
the fellow was game, and darting q
look of ferocity at those around him he
almost Lissed through his teeth


""Oh,you - towards; just take these
shackles off of me and I'll show,you. what
lean do""


While this scene was being enacted
the rope had been passed over limb Of
the cherry tree, with the moose dangling.
A horse was then led under the moose,
and Diggs was lifted on his back. This
plan die not work and the horse was
stand under the limb and the moose was
placed around his neck and tightened.
The leader was about to give the order
to swing him up, when one of the
lynchers asked and obtained permission
to offer up shortprayer for, the unhappy
wretch whose soul was so soon to be
ushered into eternity.


THE EXECUTION.


The prayer being ended the leader
shouted .'Now, pull away men,"" and in
an instant the body was dangling in
space. Strange to say, he made not the
slightest movement from the time he
was hauled up until life was pronounced
extinct, which was in twenty-five
minutes afterward, death having ensued
from strangulatiOn. Some of those pre-
sent wished to discharge pistols into the
culprit's body, but this was not counte-
nanced.


Every precaution to prevent disclo-
fotr nj
was made to hold up their hands and re-
peat after the leader the following oath:
""I do solemnly swear in the presence of
Almighty God that Will never reveal
the names of those present, or disclose
what was done here this day.""


After all had satisfied themselves that
the wretch was dead, they quietly dis
persed and went back to town by differ
ent roads. Your correspondent saw the
body about one hour after the hanging,
and as 1t swayed to and fro 1t presented
horrible and sickening sight. The eyes
were wide open and staring, while the
large mouth stood agape, with the tongue
swollen and protruding between his
teeth. The Deputy Sheriff notified the
Coroner of the county, and jury of in
quest was summoned. The Coroner's
jury met about quarter to nine at the
place where the body was hanging, and,





persons, the body was cut down.


THE ooRoNER's INQUEST.


After an examination the jury came
to the unanimous verdict, ""That John
Diggs came to his death by strangula-
ton at the hands of parties unknown.


Sheriff Kelchner stated this morning
that Diggs made full confession of the
crime to him previous to the Jail being
forced. DiRgs stated that he left the
house of Mr.. Tschiffely barefoot, carry
ing his shoes In his hands. He put these
on when about ten miles from Darnes-
town. He also related to the Sheriff all
Of his movements from the time of COM
mltting the crime until he was captured.
was very reticent. He told the Sheriff,
as he told others who conyersed with
him, that he was drunk at the time.
There is general feeling Of appreciation
here at the course pursued by the Vigil
lance Committee. A feeling of security
prevails now that the county Is rid of
this black-hearted scoundrel, whose bru-
tality made a happy home suffer, and
laid a respectable lady almost at deaths
door, besides uisfigurinE her for life. The
farmers in this section of the country
had become afraid to leave their homes
for an instant while wives
or daughters were at the mercy of vii
lains under the guise of negro laborers.
Therefore general satisfaction is express
ed that this case has been made an ex-
ample of. Mrs. Tschiffely is still serious
ly i'll, but there are strong hopes OF her
recovery."

THE STRUGGLE Al THE JAIL.
DESPERATE RESISTANCE OF THE sHER-


IFF AND HIS DEPUTIEs-A HoRRI-


BILE CRIME AVENGED.


ROCKVILLE, Md, July 27, 1880.


The negro ravisher of Mrs. Tschif-
fely-John Diggs, alias Dorsey alias
Williams-was taken forcibly from
the Jail at that place this morning
at few minutes before four O'Clock
and hanged to q tree by band of
unmasked men. Diggs was brought
to Rockville about eleven O'Clock
last night by z. J. Davis, a resident
Of Montgomery, who captured him
near Mechanicsville, in Montgomery
county. After being lodged in jail
the news of his arrest spread rapid
ly, and a courier was despatched
post haste to Jamestown to inform
Mr.. Tschiffely and his neighbors.-
Meanwhile the people of Rockville
began to gather, and on every corner
could be seen knots of men convers-
ing in low but earnest tones. I'm
precautions were showered on the
head of the negro, and it soon be-
came manifest that he would never
be tried before the courts of the
State, but that a summary hanging
would be the result of these spon-
taneous gatherings.


A. COUNCIL OF WAR.


They were met by delegation Of the
citizens of Rockville and a consultation
was held. The unanimous verdict was
that Diggs should suffer death, and that
too, before sunrise. There was not the
slightest attempt at concealment, it not
being deemed necessary, as the verdict
of the entire community, man, woman
and child, ,was:- cath to the ravisher.""
In response TO an inquiry for rope a
farmer produced from The recesses of bis
pockets a new coil of rope, (which showed
that he was prepared. The next move
was to select a leader for the lynchers.
Whereupon sturdy, six-foot, wealthy
farmer responded, sayiDg:-""You need
look no further. Follow me and will
lead YOU"" At twenty minutes to four
A. NJ, the arrangements for the lynchiDg
having been complete, thirty-two stall
wart and determined men started for
the Jail, which is situated in the out
skirts of the town and is strongly built
of Maryland granite.


DEMANDING THE KEYS.


The gate was opened and the. men
entered the Jail yard. As they neared
the steps they were halted by the Sher-
i'll, who asked them what they wanted


""Mr. Tschiffely is here and wants to
identify the prisoner"" spoke the leader.


""Mr. Tschiffely can go In if he wants,
but rot until all the rest go outside OF
the Jail enclosure"" answered the Sher-
iff.


This was not what they had como for,
and the leader spoke, saying that they
all wanted to enter the Jail, and that
they demanded the keys. Sheriff Kelch-
ner told him in determined voice that
they could not enter until they had
overcome him and his men.


""Then we will do that"" said the
leaders, and turning to the men and
saying, ""Come on, boys. down with
themP' he seized Deputy Sheriff Kings
bury and in a twinkling had possessed
himself of the keys to the Jail. The
Sheriff and his deputies made furious
resistance, but the posse comitatus, as
was expected, mingled with the crowd
and soon became identified with the
lynchers. A desperate stuggle ensued,
the Sheriff and his deputies fighting like
tigers, but in vain, as the odds were
against him.


A STRUGGLE IN THE DARK.


The lynchers could not in the dark
ness distinguish friend from toe, and,
fearful of hurting some of their friends,
decided on halt until light could be
obtained. A small kerosene lamp was
soon brought and the light revealed the
presence Of Deputy Sheriff Kingsbury.


""Gentlemen,"" he shouted, 81 protest
against this thing. You cannot pass this
gate unless you do SO ever my body""


A rush was made for the brave officer,
and a struggle short but fierce ensued,
during which the lamp went out. The
mob by this time had secured the deputy,
whom they hustled toward the door, he
fighting fiercely all the while. To open
the large iron door was the work Of only
a moment. Then the leader, accom-
panied by Mr.. James Tschiffely, went
direct to the cell OF tho outrager. The
cell door was opened and light having
been procured Mr.. Tschiffely entered the
cell. Diggs, anticipating his fate, was
covering closely in ore corner of the
cell.


""Get up,"" SAID the leader, and the
affrighted wretch arose to his feet. The
light was held close to his face, and Mr..
Tschifely, recognizing the brute's slouch
hat, peered closely into his face. But
one look suf1iced, and turning, he said :
ssThat is the scoundrel."" Then Diggs'
hat was replaced and he was taken by
either arm and led from the Jail.


ON THE ROAD TO DEATH.


As he reached the yard the mob closed
in on him on all sides, and thus he was
through the lane to winding
road which led to the Darnestown road.
His captors seemed in hurry and,
as he was, their victim was

The relics of barbarism yet linger in
the State of Virginia. Among them is a
law which provides for the selling of ne
groes into slavery, or limited scrvitude,
as it is called, for the olfense of yagrancy,
under an old State law. This law was
recently revived at Lynchburg, Va, and
three negroes were sold into involuntary
servitude to three farmers for the term of
ninety days. This fact has created con-
siderable excitement. The colored peo-
pie of the community fancied that they
saw in this performance the beginning of
an attempt to reduce them to slavery
again, and they discussed the matter with
much vchemcnCe. They finally deter
mined to test the question in the courts,
and employeda Il lawyer. The case was APP
pealed, but the appeal was denied on the
ground that the action of the justice
of the peace was final. The prisoners
were then brought before the county
judge on writ of habeas corpus. They
were promptly released on the ground
that their cases did not come under the
provision of the vagrant act. This prac-
tice of selling colored men into scrvitude
does not generally prevail in the South
but one thing is very certain, it should
not be tolerated anywhere. No person
should be sold into servitudc to any indi.
vidual under any circumstances. We are
firm believers in the justice of compelling
able-bodied tramps and convicts to labor
and in that way support themselves; but
that should be done under the control OF
the public authorities and in rcformatory
institutions. Every appearance and YES.
tige of slavery should be discontinued
under our flag, which abolished the insti
| tuition and washed it out with blood. ="

Counciihave been engaged in solving
rather intricate case which involved
the loss to the city Of several hundred
perches Of stone. This stone came
from Van Buren, street, between
Sixth and Eighth, which has been in
course of grading for three months or
more, the contractor being Hugh Pat
ton. The stone, as it was quarried
out, was piled up along the street, and
those WHO observed, it, say 1t was
building stone of an excellent charac-
ter. This stone belonged to the city.


Recently the Water Department em-
ployes have been laying water pipe
along the street, and the stone they
quarried out to make the pipe trench
was piled upon and mixed with that
|'quarrled by Patton. This Water De-
partment stone was sold to Philip
Lynch, by the Water Department, for
$l2, but Lynch, instead of confining
himself to the ditch stone taken out
by the Water Department, took the
whole business, and in a short time all
of the city's fine building stone was
gone Street Commissioner Lynch
had his attention called to the matter,
and he demonstrated with the other
Lynch, but the latter insisted that he
had purchased all the stone, and con-
tinued removing it. The Street Com
missioner was instructed by one of the
members of Council to have Mr.. Lynch
arrested, but as he insisted 30 positive
ly that he had purchased the stone, the
Commissioner felt delicacy in taking
such step. All this happened about
three weeks ago, but it was only with
in the last few days that other men,
bers of Council outside of the chairmen
of the Street and Opening Streets Com
mittees had any intimation of the af-.
fair. Since then there has been a gen.
eral investigation, and the result will
be that Council, at it's next meeting
will be asked to instruct the City So
licitor to institute suit against Mr.


Philip Lynch, for the recovery of the
value of the stone taken by him which
belonged to the city. p .Nt'ui


Philip Lynch is a stone mason and
general contractor, and is also surety
for Hugh Patton, the contractor for
grading. Van Buren, street, from Sixth
to Eighth, and Seventh street, from
Jackson to Harrison. Patton took the
contract for 28t cents per cubic yard,
and got badly ''stl1ck"" ON it, Van Bu-
rem street being filled with such solid
bed of rock as to preclude the possibil-

for the punishment of crime. This is re-
garded as indispensable for the protection
and welfare of society, and where these
statutes exist it is the part of wisdom and
safety that society should surrender the
punishment of crime implicitly to those tri-
bunals and forms which the law prescribes.
This is the wisest, safest and best policy to
adopt, and the only one that can be adopted
with perfect security to justice and right.
There are times and occasions when crimes
are committed which are so revolving that
the public temper becomes excited to fever
heat, and impatience of the laws delays and
uncertainties leads to the melting out of
summary punishment by the hands of
an infuriated mob. The euormity of the
offense may seem 10 call for more prompt
and certain vengeance than is guaranteed
by the forms of law, but when the line laid
down by the statute for all is departed
from, then those who assume to discharge
its functions without authority become us
wreak their vengeance.


There have been recent occurrences in
Maryland where Judge Lynch has i'm
provised his court and pronounced his
Judgment against miscreauts with hasty
effect, under which the limb of the first
tree has become the felons gallows and
mob his executoner. The case of DIGGs,
who had confessed an infamous crime and
was executed by summary hanging to the
limb of tree until he was dead, is the last
that has come to our notice. This man was
colored, and the crime of which he was
guilty was one that called for certain ven
geance-but we doubt if disregard of the.
laws of GOD and man by IN infuriated
populace even TO secure his summary
taking Off can be tolerated without dis
turbing the foundations of society. 1t were
safer and better to have left this criminal
in the hands of the legal authorities, from
whence he was snatched, than to have
added 10 the volume Of crime and the
number Of criminals,


Many will be uncharitable enough TO
allege that if the offender had been white
man the law would have exercised its
functions without the interference of a mob.
This may be true or false-we will not
pretend to say The crime is no moro
henous in black than in white man, so
far as the law adjudges, and hence there is
no reason why white felon should share
any more immunity than black one. 1t
was but recently that ten white brutes COM
mitted an Offense in the Smithsonian
grounds, which, under all the circum-
stances, was ten.fold rs brutal aud atrocious
as that committed in Maryland, as it null
tiplied the crime by ten; and yet in this
wicked city there has been no attempt to
] take their punishment out Of the hands Of"

GRISwoLD HUMPHREY,",,"GRISWOLD HUMPHREY.

 Last Thursday morning the death of Mir Griswold Humphrey was announced, an even, not altogether unexpected, but more start ling from the fact that but two weeks before | his condition was so much improved as to warrant his riding out. The immediate cause of his death was heart affection, but he had been confined for the past six mouths with \ complication of diseases which puzzled and taxed the skill of his physicians, and from 1 which, considering his advanced age and feeble | constitution, complete recovery was hardly expected. MT. Humphrey was born at Norfolk, Conn Nov. 10, 1906, the son of Dudley Humphrey, who died May 6, 1823 exactly 57 years to I day, previous to the death of the subject of this sketch. He remained at home until his ! ninth year, when he was taken by his grand father, Captain Darius Phelps in Norfolk, in

 whose family he remained until he arrived at

 the age of 2l, working on the farm, and, dur ! ing the latter years of his minority, teaching school in the winter season. In the year 1885

 he went to New York, and formed co-part-

 nership with Israel Post, in the sale of books and periodicals in the Bowery. Was there at the time of the great fire of 1895 6, and

 was appointed special policeman to guard the

 rescued property. On making their collec-

 tions it was found that 8 large percentage of

 the debtors of the firm had been ruined by the fire, and the business not being success

 ful, the partnership was dissolved, MT.

 Humphrey withdrawing with less money than

 he had at the start. He then came to Lake,

 ville where he associated himself with the

 late Dr. A. Humphrey, in the drug business,

 and while there, married Miss Olive Jones,

 daughter of the late Horace Jones of Miller.

 opposite the Stevens House, then made va- cant by the death of W. W. Calkins, since moved to Railroad street, and now owned l and occupied by P. Lynch as tenement.

 Remained there two years, when the co-part- ! Mu Al>o !, business, which was removed back to his old stand, the store being re-modeled and en- , larged to it's present size. MT.

 HoUsE.-Mr. Acklen, of Louisiana, made personal explanation relative to the charges made in recent numbers of the New York Her aid and Detroit Post to the effect that he had, during the absence from the House of the members of Committee on Foreign Affairs (of which committee he was not member, made 8 report purporting to be the report of that committee on the s'Nicaraguan Claims"" bill. He referred to those charges as the most malicious and willful prevarications of truth on record, and offered a resolution, which was adopted, directing the Committee on Foreign Affairs to examine into their truth or falsity.

 Mr. Harris, of Massachusetts, from the Committee on Naval Affairs, reported bill, which was referred to the Committee Of the Whole, providing permanent construction fund for the navy.

 The House in Committee of the Whole con sidered two bills. One wGs for the relief or George Eyster, assistant treasurer Of the United States at Philadelphia, for money stot- en by a clerk, and it was opposed on the ground that public officers should be held responsible for losses. The other was for the relief of certain citizens of Lynchburg, and refunding to them taxes improperly col lected from them on manufactured tobacco. Both bills were ordered reported favorably,"

Tho AIbanys outaeidod and outbnttod.",,"


The National and Albany clubs finished their nrst
series Of agnes here last Saturday each club win
ming two. In the last gauo played the home team
did better fielding, with the exception Of Snyder,
than in any Of the others The honors belonged to
Baker on Saturday, he oxcolling both in the field
and at the bat, making four base-hits and captur-
ing seven fly balls Lynch did some remarkably
fine pitching and the Abnnys did little batting.
The Nationals played better together than ever be
fore this season. and It is to be hoped that they will
show good work in the future.


The Albnnys left for homo Saturday night, md
the Nationals play in Baltimore to-day aud to-
morrow.


Now that the games between these clubs arc
over a word about the umpiring cannot effect
them. Mr. Sullivan was selected because he was
believed to be impartial but his rulings In the first
three games. including the one by the Ma
tionals. were so maniiestly biased toward the AL
bauy club that many OF the spectators perceived
and openly spoke OF IT, In calling balls and
strikes he was very unfair, and ut one time he
would have been changed had not the Nationals
accepted him for the entire four games. Every
close decision went TO the visitors which was not
the case with the Nationals when on the road
playing but on the contrary the home club re-
ceivcd the decision when doubtful.
Last Saturday Pike was out at first and Lynch
plainly not out at the same base, still Mr. Sellmon
decided the other way in both instances. II Is
pretty safe to say that this gentleman will not
umpire any more games here this season. The
Nationals selected man from another city in
order to get rid OF that part partisan cry started last
games, They should dose Albany with their own
medicine. When the Nationals visit them they arc
furnished with three names from which TO select
their umpire and when Albany returns here poke
the list out to them and compel the visitors Ia
name their man.


The following is the score of the Saturday game"

and although he has been in the city but little
more than month, still he made for himself many
friends. He did not attain that success expected
Of him az ball player. and he gives way to more
experienced one. He was an amateur when he
came here, and has the material within him for n
fine player and it will require very few seasons to
develop it. Wherever he may go he will carry

his success"

A NEGRO OUTLAW LYNCHED AFTER A


CONFESSION OF VARIOUS CRIMES.",,"NEGRO OUTLAW LYNCHED AFTER A


CONFESSION OF VARIOUS CRIMES.


CHARLESTON, s. g., March 2.-On
Saturday last one-armed negro, named
Louis Kinder, committed an outrageous
assault upon white woman named
Byrd, residing near Georges Station,
Colleton county, about fifty miles from
tits city. A hunt was organized and the
villain captured about four O'Clock on
Sunday morning by a mixed white and
black posse. He was taken to the scene
of the outrage and identified by his VIC
tim. A vote of the posse was taken and
it was decided not to lynch him but to
allow the law to take its course. Kinder
was then taken to Georges Station and
placed IN the guard house under a strong
guard. On Monday morning he was
sent to Walterboro to Jail, still strongly
guarded. On their way to W alterboro
the guard were overpowered by an arm
ed force, consisting, it is said, largely of
the relatives of the outraged lady, and
the prisoner was conveyed to a secluded
spot in the woods, where he was kept
till night. About 8 o'clock last night
he was again confronted with the lady
whom he had outraged and again identi-
fed. He was again taken to the woods,
where preparations were made to hang
him. At the last moment he confessed
the crime, and also confessed to a SINH
lar outrage upon colored woman, in
Newberry, six years ago. He further
acknowledged the killing of colored
girl, near Kings Tree, last April, and
confessed to four burglaries and innum-
erable Lhefts At 1910 O'clock he was
hanged, and after firing a volley of pis-
tol shots into the, body the crowd quiet
ly dispersed.


Kinder was dangerous outlaw, who
for over year had been the terror of the
neighborhood on which he preyed, and
the action Of the vigilants is heartily in-
dorsed by both the white and the color
ed residents of the vicinity."

YOU can bet. No man toldyou you neu
without passing in his checks right on,
said William Z. Goodyear, when qleS-
toned by the reporter Of the Register
Yesterday in regard to the thrilling
times of 40. the first year Of the gold
fever in California. No man went
without his six-shooter and bowie. Why,
my man, to 90 through some streets
stretching maybe-well, let's see, say
from the corner of State to Orange
Street. without your old siX-ShOOter III
your hand. would be as much as your
precious life was worth. The man you
met on a street of this kind held MS
pistol with as little concern as you would
hold that cane going up street, SAID
he, tapping the reporters cane with his
FINGERS. ""You see every body was crazy
after gold and bound to have his rights
preserved if he had to kill men for 1t,
and it was good thing, and had the
effect of giving rise to a sort OF law
which, to be sure, was 'leetIe touSn'
vet, at the same time, man was sure
to have his belongings preserved. Why,
a man could, with perfect safety, leave
his pan of gold in full view, withouttear
of its being taken""


""How is that?n


""Because your neighbor knew that if
he touched it his life wasn't worth the
asking. Then, again, every one had
claim of their own, and they were too
much enprossed with their own business
to mind yours


""That reminds me Of good story,
and one from which you can get pref
ty good idea of the state of affairs out
there in Los Angeles at that time. A
man named DickersOn and his family
came out there and settled on claim,
which he considered his, and which all
the boys conceded to be his. He had
lived on it long time, and no one had
disputed his claim, so he, with the ad-
vice of the boys, determined to hold on
to it. Well, to get around the story
little faster, because | haven't got very
much time to talk, family named Som
ers come out there, and asked the priv
ilege of occupying a little corner OF the
claim. Well, Dick, he was a little
'skeery, but finally decided he would.
So the Somers settled themselves and
became the means Of a lively muss. Al
ter they had lived there for a couple Of
years Somers undertook to claim that he
owned the portion he had been living
on, whereupOn Dick-and he was a
trump-went to the Justice OF the Peace
about it. The Justice said he would
have a trial, and proceeded to get a
jury. Ordinarily, you know, Judge
Lynch would have settled the affair, but
Dick he wanted the square thing done,
so went in for jury. Well,
the way that jury was picked out
was a great business. 1t was: Here,
Bill, you serve and 'Halloa, Jim, you
are on the jury Well, we got q jury,
and the trial was pretty fair example
of Western courts at that time. The
Justice, not very much Of a lawyer at
the best, turned one of the bar-rooms Of
the place into a courtroom and pre-
pared for business. was on the jury,
so YOU see | know what | am telling
you. Somers he urged his claim and
got Dick pretty mad, so what did Dick
do but put his hand in his pocket, draw
a six-shoOter out, bang, bang quick as
flash, and Somers rolled over. Then
a fellow named Anderson, who was a
friend of Dicks and friend Of mine,
came in to have a hand in the muss,
and keep an eve open for Dick. But
before he could do a thing or really take
in the situation, young SOmers, a broth
er of the fellow Dick killed, drew his six
shooter and shot Anderson. He fell
back into my arms. Pretty quick he
made tremendous brace, kinder raised
himself up, and says, Look out, Bill,
I'll finish him yet, and by gum he did.
He shot the cuss right through the head.
Well, things were taking pretty lively
turn, when sister of Dicks came in
through the door, and with a fourteen
inch bowie in her hand slashed through
the crowd, covered the old man with
her body and said, Come along, old
man, this amt no place for you Well,
he went, and there were no Somers OF
any account left to press the claim. Dick
came out all right, and held on to his
claim. Yes, stree, those were thrilling
times, now you can bet""


Mr.. Goodyear told this story with an
earnestness which displayed some Of the
fire and nerve which he showed he had
still left after years Of later life in this
more peaceful section Of the country.

down to business, and Ex-senator

live In Congress- be now proceeded
with. Adopted.


Albert o. Newton, Of st Gto.ge s
nominated Hon. Edward L. Martin,
whose name was greeted with prolonged
""A M a.


Mr.. Chairman, rise to make a nom
ination, aud in doing so you will pro-
badly anticipate the name as that of the
Hon. Edward l.. Martin, of Sussex
county, who, having distinguished him
self as a good representative in the lower
house of Congress, we could not, think,
offer a more fitting appreciation of his
valuable services, than denomination
by this convention, for though rotation,
as general principle, is a safety of the
State, aud which every executive and
other appointing power should strictly
adhere to, yet some may prudently be
permit.edta retain their stations for q
second term, or even third, there are
but few of these however. I therefore,
in accordance with the usual Democratic
custom In Delaware, (for this particular
office) nominate MIR. Martin for re-elec-
ton to represent the Stale of Delaware in
the next Congress of the United States.


Wm. F. Causey, Esq. of Milford.
recently OF st. LOUIS, seconded the noni
ination of Col. Martin. He said for the |
past Twelve years he had watched the |
course of the Democratic party and Its |
leaders 10 this State. For the past decade |
entire harmony has prevailed within |
tue party ranks, and good has been the
result. We recognize In the Hon. Ed |
ward l.. Martin a faithful citizen OF
Delaware and a true blue Democrat.
[applause.l We regard The office he has
so aceptably filled as high and honora-
BILE one. No State, to-day, occupies |
higher position In the councils of the |
nation than Delaware. 70 represent |
this State is greater honor than to rep |
resent the great State OF New York. |
For the finger Of corruption has never
touched the representatives of the Dia-
mond State, and Delaware has ever been
true to the position as one of the States
of the Union.


Mr.. Causey closed with brilliant
allusion to Gen. Hancock, whose cleo
tion he predicted, while tbe Convention
greeted the name with storm of ap-
plause. He hoped Delaware would |
ioin I'm electing to Congress men in
t borough sympathy with the Nationi
con didates,


Henry @. Turner moved that Mr..
Martin be nominated by reclamation.

three sessions were held. The U. S. Minis

to Peru and Bolivia was present. Each bel
ligerent recognized the necessity for peace,
and the disinterested course of the United
States. Chile presented her terms, which
were for increased territory and the restora-
tion of property taken from Chilean citizens,
| and the Governments of Bolivia and Peru
rejected the demands. Minister Christiancy
suggested that Peru and Bolivia might have
propositions to make, and the representative
of Peru moved to refer the entire question to
| the Government of the United States for ar
bitratiop, the decision to be final, without
| favoring either party to the struggle. The
proposition for arbitration was not accepted
by Chile. President Osborn, in declaring the
conference ended, said he and his colleagues
profoundly lamented that the conference
should not have yielded the pacific and con.
ciIiatory results hoped from it, and believe
the same impression will be made upon the
Government and people of the United States
when the fact is communicated to them that
the friendly mediation of the United States
has been fruitless.

The two companies between Omaha and San
Francisco raised in cash out Of Government
bonds, lands and mortgages of their fran
chises. four or five times az much as they
necessarily expended upon the roads. These
roads thus built at the public expense, and
in some cases paid for by the public five
times over, are claimed now as private prop
erty of the companies, and the right of the
public to use them as highways is utterly de-
MED. Nevertheless, l think the claim of
these companies to take reasonable tolls

stockholders themselves at their own proper

The Democratic Aspirahts 10 tb q


Ohice-The Chances OF tho 0,iEeA


emit Candidates.


Democratic candidates for the Sher-


iffalty nomination are not numerous


this year. In 1878 they were almost as


plentiful as the illegal votes cast at the


nomination election. No less than four


teen were in the field to wit:John Pyle,


B. Frank Townsend, Purnsl ]. Lynch,
Robert C. Justis, George c. Ward, Fran.


cis I. Sawdon, Giles Lambson, Francis


Duggan, John White, James R. Collins,


Charles L. Anderson, William Barclay,


John NJ. Whiteman and Zacharish


Gemmill. Some how only one of the


above rather formidable list has enter.


ed the arena again. Mr.. B. Frank


Townsend has turned his attention


toward the office of Clerk Of the Peace;


Mr.. Robert C. Justis has done likewise;


Mr.. George C. Ward is content with


what he has gotten ont Of the Assessor


ship, and the others have been sui,a-


bly, disposed OF, or have either grown
disheartened or turned their eager eyes
upon some other object more easily to
be obtained.


This year only four candidates are
in the race, viz: PurnalJ. Lynch, OF
st. Georges Hundred, and Thomas Ford,
John NJ. Maeklsm, and Peter B. Heus-
ted of Wilmington. twill be noticed
that Mr.. Lynch is the only candidate
outside of Wilmington, - athing which
augurs we'll for his prospect on nomina
tion day to those who casually note the
field, and also for his ingenuity in con
ducting his campaign, to those who
know the diplomacy that has been ex-
ercised to keep the other candidates
out. II is bruited about in Democratic
circles that Mr.. Lynch and his managers
have ""bought off"" all those whose pop
nlarity might tend to cripple his pros
poets. According to these statements
it has not yet transpirsd that so much
in dollars and cents have been paid
each man who was likely to be an
aspirant, but it appears that in one way
and another-by promise OF political aid
here and pecuniary assistance there,
and some other acceptable thing at sot1s
other place, the country candidates all |
along the line have been summarily |
and successfully disposed of, and Mr.. l. |
stands in the proud position as the
only country candidate and in the i'm
aginary blissfulness of an extremely i
easy walk-over.


A Democratic politician said yester-
day that in doing this Mr.. Lynch was
counting on the fact that he was pepu.
lar in the country, and that in the
Sherifalty tread-mill he had, like the
small boy in shoveling snow, been
''kesping at it,; and Mr.. Lynch has
been keeping at itfor years with vim.


Possibly the only candidate who will
give the St. Georges man any trouble
will be Mr.. Thomas Ford: Tom is one
Of these folks to whom the expression
Igsod fellow"" does not do any thing
like full justice, and yet he is so sffa-
bic and pleasant and matter-of.fact to
every one that it seems amply sufficient. /
In Wilmington he will receive large
of the votes, He is yaT7
strong i9 Christisna Hundred, where at
least 6ne half of the Democrats will vote
for him. In the other hundreds
where he is well known, and he has q
large acquaintance through the county.
Mr.. Lynch will not have it all his own
way by any means. All the Democrats,
they will vote for Mr.. Ford or
not, say he would make an excellent
Sheriff.


A Democrat, who says he doesn't
care how the fight ends, remarked the
other day that he thought Mr.. Ford's
chances are equally as good as Mr..
Lyneh's. He said that of the 3,52l
votes cast at the nomination election in I
MIR. Ford would get at
east $500, and that he would undoubted
y get enough in the country Hundreds II
% enable him to hold his own.


""But what if Dir. Lynch secures a
majority of all the votes cast outside {
Il the city 7"" J
""I should smile il he did. But he +
amt do it, and even if he did Ford p
Vould have an enormous vote, consider g
ng the boost Wilmington is sure to
i've him."

mend that the principal of this school


be allowed, as q substitute, the salary


OF q prinsipal of a primary school, till


the end Of the present school year.


The report was adopted without op.


position.


The Finance Committee presented an
estimate OF the expenses of each school


for the coming year, the totals being as
follows: Salaries, $54, ,595; books and
stationery, $4,595; repairs, %, 757;luel,
S2,45S; gas, water, insurance, etc.,
1874.
The Book Committee reported that
they had received a proposition from
tie publishers of Harper's Introductory
Geography of so liberal a nature, that
by its acceptance and the introduction
Of Harper's instead Of Warrsn's, (ths
present text book, several hundred
dollars can he saved. They therefore
recommended that the proposition he
accepted. (The exchange price is 80
cents per copy.)


A long discussion ensued on lths re-
port, dnring which Mr.. Kent read an
estimate of the number Of hooks re-
quired TO be renewed in the different
schools, and argued that great loss
always accrues to the students by a
change in the text books. From his
estimate of the number of new books
required he was confident that the
change would not be an economical
one.


Mr.. Ksnnsy opposed Mr.. Kent's posi-
tion, and held that on the score Of
economy the change should bs made.


Mr.. Lynch, opposing the report of
the committee, made some personal al
lusions which might be construed TO
refer to the agent Of the Harper Com
pany (who was present at the meet
inG) and he was promptly called
to order by DR.. shortlidge and
the chair decided the point well ia
ken. For second time he was called
to order, on the ground that he was
impugning the motives of mem bers,
and was told to confne himself to the
question or quit. Again, in tue course
Of his remarks, he alluded to the mat.
ter as pet job on the part of some
Of the members, and was again
called to order, by Mr.. Kenney,
'f the book committee, very comphatic-
ally denying the imputation that it
was pet job.


DIR. Grimshaw sensibly regretted
hat in the Board the emherss do not
ieal exclusively with educational mat
ers, and further regretted that per-
Qualities had been introduced. The doc.
or argued that according to the propos-
tion to introduce the Harper's as most
# the Warren's are worn out, two diff.
erent kinds of hooks will be mixed up
n tue schools, and besides that the
hangs would cost at least $780,
he speaker also made prac
ical comparison between the
maps in the two Biographies, to
how that the Warren maps are far the
'sst, and he also thought. and doubt
ess thought right, that the people of
his city are heartily tired of this eter-
Ial Geography question.


According to Mr.. Morrow's computa-
ion nearly 100 new books will be- re-
uired about September first, and he ear. t
estly favored the change, arguing that
Varren's book, as an instructor, is far ,
nferior to Harper's.


Mr.. Lally said he understood that.
lr. Morrow in making his examination
s to the condition of the books in the &
arious schools, merely asked the
hildren to hold up their hands c
y way Of indicating the condition of :.
leir books.
Mr.. Morrow branded the assertion as 81
Use. t
Mr.. Baird was of the opinion that If
le proposed change was made the I
oard would lose not less than $3.50. ""
After long discussion MIR. Kyne, n
owed to postpone the matter until the

 UNITED STATES CONGRESS-.

 SENATE.

 The Senate spent some time in the dis cussion of a bill to grant pension to a former army scout, which was laid over. During the discussion Mr. Teller made long speech against the agreement en- tered into by Secretary Schurz with the Utes. MT. Hill, of Georgia, replied in defense of the agreement and intimated that his colleagues course was impelled only by desire to make political capital at home. MT. Ingalls,, of Kansas, said we paid $6O, ,00O, ,0O0 annually in pensions more than any other Government eX- pense except interest on the public debt. Great Britain only paid $10,000,0 900. France and Germany paid less than $8,- 100000 each. The Government could not be charged with ingratitude.

 MT. Salisbury made short speech against the bill to pension non-com- missioned army officers, and Messrs. Morgan and Dawes opposed the Secretary of the Interiors agreement with the Utes. MT. Conkling reported favorably on the bills giving consent to an agree ment between the States of New York and Vermont respecting the boundary line at Fairhaven. Passed.

 The Senate further debated the bill to authorize a retired list for non-commis- stoned officers, and the proposed agree ment with the Utes. The Senate in executive session after long discussion rejected the nominations of John R. Lynch and John $. Burton as super visors of the census in Mississippi. The joint resolution to allow the employees of the Government Printing Office hoi- days with pay was read third time and passed.

 MT. Thurman was elected to preside over the Senate in the absence of Vice President Wheeler. The chief subjects discussed were the proposed removal of the Santees from Nebraska to the Poncas' agreement with the Utes. The latter of the money to the Utes contingent upon the surrender of the guilty Indians HOUSE.

 The House discussed the Star Route Deficiency bill for some hours and con- cluded by adopting, against the rec ommendation of the Appropriations Committee, the Senate amendments by a vote of 91 to S3.

 The Springer Manning difficulty was brought before the House by personal explanations on the part of both those gentlemen, and the Illinois representa- tive called upon several members of the Elections Committee to corroborate his statement that he had never said he should vote to seat Donnelly in the place of Washburne. MT. Weaver (Nat., Ia. ) obtained the recognition of the Speaker and moved to suspend the rules and adopt his resolutions declaring 1t the sense of the House that all currency, whether metallic or paper, should be issued and its volume controlled by the Government and not by banks, and be a full legal tender; that the portion of the interest bearing debt redeemable in 1881 (about $782, 1000, ,00O should not be re- funded beyond the power of the Govern ment to call it in and pay it at any time but should be paid as rapidly as possi- ble, and that the hints should be oper- ated to their full capacity in the coin age of standard dollars and other money. The bill was defeated-84 yeas to 117 nays. MT. Townshend (Dem., III. moved to suspend the rules so as to discharge the Committee of Ways and Means from the further consideration of the bill plac- ing salt, printing type, printing paper and materials used in the manufacture of printing paper on the free-ist and put 1t on its passage. Defeated by 112 to SC not two-thirds in the affirmative.

 MT. Atkins Oem., Tenn chairman of the Committee on Appropriations re- ported the Naval Appropriation bill. Referred to the Committee of the Whole. The bill is accompanied by Q short re. port, which states that the estimate o1 the Navy Department amounted to $14, 603, ,820.45. Of this sum the Committee recommends the appropriation of $14, 1885, 797.7O, being reduction of S21S,- 023. 75 from the estimates. The Naval bill of last year appropriated $14, ,O29,. 96S. 95, or $355, ,928 75 less than the pres. ent bill. The Senate joint resolution was passed providing for payment ot wages of employees of the Government Printing Office for legal holidays. MT. Clymer Dem., Penn. moved that thy House go into committee upon the Arme Appropriation bill, which motion was antagonized by MT. Springer Dem., Ill. who desired to call up the Curtin Yocum contested election case. MT. Clymer's motion was, however, agreed to. The bill appropriates $26, 425, ,OOO, $1, POP, ,O0C less than the estimates. The bill was then read by sections for amendments.

 The House spent nearly its entire ses sion Thursday in Committee of the Whole in consideration of whether the amendment to the A my bill forbidding the presence of soldiers at the polls was in order. The Chairman decided the question in the affirmative and was srls- tained by the committee.

 MT. McCook offered resolution call ing on the Secretary of War for informa- ton regarding the alleged outrage at West Point, but MT. Aiken objected, stating that the cadet was from his dis trict and he would look after him. The proposed amendment to the Army bill regarding the employment of contract surgeons was rejected and the result was scene"" between Messrs. Sparks and Clymer, the former using language for which the Republicans proposed to cen- sure him. He ultimately, however, with drew the unparliamentary words. Mr. | Sparks, from the Military Committee, offered an additional section to the Army ! bill, providing that no money shall be paid for the subsistence, equipment, transportation or compensation of any troops to be used as a police force to keep"

 ribIe Crime -He Outrages and Then

 Shoots His Aunt.

 MANCHESTER, Feb. S.-In the neighboring town of Londonderry, eleven miles from this city, On Old Monmouth road, most shorrible crime was enacted yesterday afternoon. Frank Dillingham;, aged 20 years, outraged and shot his aunt, Sarah Dillingham;, and then attempted his own life by shooting, but failing went to neighboring store and gave himself up. The murderer comes from Lowell, Mass, and went to work in April last for E. V. Dill Hngham, husband of the woman, who is also the boys uncle. He proved to be wilful and stubborn fellow, and it was only by much urg- ing that any considerable work could be got out of him. No serious trouble occurred be- tween him and his employer, however, and on Saturday morning MT. Dillingham; left home to transact some business in Manchester and was absent all day, leaving the hired boy and his wife at home alone. Some two hours before his return the neighbors were made aware of what had taken placs, the first information being conveyed by the perpetrator of the crime himself. Immediately upon the young man giving him. self up and making known what deyilish work he had been engaged in, he was secured and several men entered the house. finding Mrs. Dillingham; stretched on the floor in the front room. her head lying in pool of blood, while her clothing was in such a condition as to tend to the conclusion that she had been outraged. A rope was drawn tightly across her neck, 50 that when it was removed it left large belt of discoloration. Life still retained it's hold freely, however, and up to two o'clock this afternoon she remains in the same unconscious condition. but it is thought she cannot live long. The ball entered near the right ear, and came out on the other side of the head near the temple. The outrager shot himself near the left temple, but his recovery is almost certain. He has been given over to the custody of the sheriff, William Clarke, who has taken him to some unknown place for fear that the terribly incensed people would take measures to lynch him, as was bitterly and loudly threatened. He has mother living in Lowell, but the whereabouts of his father is unknown. His victim is 33 years old, daughter of the late Perley Wallace, and has been married eight years. Young Dillingham; will be rsigned for his horrible crime early the present week. He manifests no remorse for what he has done and seems to await future events with out fear. The only motive that can be assigned for the deed is the desire of the prisoner to gratify his lust."

PUTED TIE COUNTY RETURNS.",,"Canvass at New Castle yesterday, was
intensified by absurd rumors 10 the eff
feet that the Board proposed TO throw
out, on technical grounds sufficient re-
turns TO elect the Democratic candidates.
This had the effect of TAXI q a number
oi Republican politicians over, eager aud
anxious, out before the count was oOm-
pleted they evidently had cause 10 feel
disgusted with some of their own In
spectols, while the extreme spirit of fair
ness manifested by the majority of the
B1ard must have made these Fl fiightened
Republicans feel very much ashamed of
their unjust suspicious.


IL was about one o'clock when the
Board started TO work, with Sheriff PYLE
presiding, and Geo. +. Deakyne and
VIM. A. KINNEY as clerks.


THE FIRST BREEZE.


While ID. }. Gallagher, Insp ctor of
the Second ward, was reading his certifi-
cate, objection was made by Harry Haw-
kins OF the Eighth ward, bpcanse he
held a printed ticket under the GER iii
cate. Then some one moved that VIM.
ii. Lee be allowed TO read GaIlagher's
certificate which prevailed, on All ave
aud nay vote by Fl TO s, and this course
was continued during the canvass, the
Inspectors being allowed the privilege
Of delegating the reading of the returns
to their clerks when they so desired.


Down at the bottom Of the ticket Mr..
Lee read 800 votes for Lewis Frank
Elidson for Levy Court Commissioner
instead of Lewis Frank Ellison a d said
it was probably clerical error. The
Republicans were shocked, as it was
their candidate, and they were T irly
amazed when Inspector Henry A. Now
land, a Democrat, moved that the mis-
lake be corrected, which motion pre-
vailed unanimously.


Proceeding the Board made a num-
Der of corrections such as crediting two
votes for ""Albert Whitley"" TO ""Albert
Whiteley,"" """"Henry I. Turner"" to ""Hen-
ry =. Turner"" and so on, the voters
evidently having used q few ""Dlack- cat""
ticko issued on election morning, in
which every name excepting Martin
Farrelrs was spelled incorrectly. In
spector Hoigland, Republican, insisted
that the Board had no right to alter the
certificates of the IDspec ors, but he
changed his mind with surprising sud

reached.


TWO BOSS CERTIFICATES.


When the Eighth ward was called the
clerk arose to read ii, and Inspector
Thomas J. James asked him If Le had
completed 1t in the room where the cleo
on was held, or not until he reached
New Castle. The clerk responded that
the certificate was in just the same con
dition as when the ell ction officers
signed IL. He then proceeded with the
reading, but on reaching the name OF
Purnal j. Lynch, Democratic candidate
for Sheriff announced that there were no
figures annexed indicating the number
Of votes received by him.


This announcement cl eated considera-
BILE excitement, and Inspector Hoagland
moved that the box be- opened aud the
other tally list examined. Inspector
Austin V. Gaynor moved to amend by
throwing out the vote Of the ward. Then
nearly everybody in the court room be-
gan talking at once, q III Babel Of 90 l.
fusion prevailed until Inspector Gaynor,
Al the request of The SIe:lff, wIthulew
his moi ion, alter which Inspector HOag-
lands motion prevailed, without opposI-
ton. The Sheriff then opened the bal
lot box and took out the other certificate.
But fresh surprise was In store.
| The second certificate was worse than
the first. II announced the vote for
Sheriff as follows:


| Purnal j. Lynch received 40 votes
Philip X. Clak received votes
received 6S4 votes
1t was awful TO view the countenances
Of the Republicans. S.me of them who
a. first said the Board had no right to
alter The certificate in any respect
we're by this time willing to go
| @ any extent, even TO opeuing the box
and recountng the ballots. Inspector
| Nowland, Democrat, however, settled
the trouble by moving that the blank
after Clark's name be filled with the
| figures evidently intended for him, aud
the motion prevailed without dissent.
| Considering the objections made by
RepublL cans at first TO any persons but
inspectors reading their returns, 1t Was
amusing 10 see their extreme ,agrrness
to ALLOW these certificates TO be read by
everybody. First the clerk read them.


Then the Inspector, b. b. Cummins,
gazed at them IN helpless disuay. Next
John IL Rodney, Esq, read them for
the Sheriff, and finally VIM. q. Spruance,


Esq, adjusted his eye-gla 'ses and helped
the frightened and trembling clerk to
read the awfully mixed up mess. 1t


was real funny to see the Republicans


worked up into such terrible fright.

what we Il Id. The other day Uric En- En-
gene Fuclfe de Collin de Bar, Vicomto
de Civry, appeared before a French inv
on charge of robbery and general
swindling. He had been arrested im
England on an extradition warrant and
before he went TO England he had nn;'
etly relieved the landlady of the mr-
nlshed apartment which he occunied l.,
Paris of considerable quantity of bor
property. He had hired the apartmant
Tor considerable sum in the fasbionab1o
quarter, and he no sooner obtained ~
session OF it than he broke omen Tho

the proprietress anG made off with them
Ills confederates in this transaction were
his own valet and stewart and other
""ofiicers OF his household"" The moor
landlady had no suspicion of her lodper
for he bore a noble French name and
was of princely origin. Hismothcr was
the daughter of the Duke of BrunswicL
His father was a French gentleman oi
extremely good descent. The poor lad
was born into every species of ELEGANT
corruption, If that adjective can ever be
applied to that noun. His grandfather
lived the life that every one in Paris
knows, went about painted up to the
eyebrows, and wearing curled perr,.g,e
while his morals were even more artif.
cially nasty than his manner of dressing
lie installed several temporary fayorites
in his household at short intervals of
succession, and the mother of Uric de
Civry was one of them. She yas
brought up in kind Of splendid Bohe-
mia. Her father took little notice of
her, being entirely engrossed with his
notice Of himself, and he made very
slender provision for her education and
training. She therefore had but little
OF tins description t. transmit TO her
son. In worldly goods she was almost
as badly off, for the old:Duke kept a
tight hold on his purse strings. She OBJ
tanned very little money from him.
though he rolled in millions; yet at the
same time, though living in his house.
she was always within sight of the great.
est luxuries that money could purchase.
Her lips, as it were, touched river of
liquid gold, but she was still athirst.
She formed mos. costly and extrayacant
tastes. and had nothing to crafty them
with. Her son was in this respect a true
child OF his mother, and in others the
true grandson of the illustrious Duke, So
that he was thoroughly well equipped
with bad qualities on both sides. and not
a single vice was wanting for his compo-
sition. He could not work, to beg he
was ashamed, but he was not ashamed
to steal. and no lived pretty comfortably
for time in Paris on his wits and his
name. His grandfather was known To
be SO rich that nobody hesitated TO trust
the young fellow, and even when the
grandfather died and left all his money
away from the family to the City of Gre.
neva, there was still hone Of recover
ing it by a lawsuit. In the meantime
Uric de Ciyry went on cheating IN the
hope that something would turn uD in
the shape of a favorable decision in his
mothers suit for the recovery of the
property. He might probably after that
have turned an honest man. That was
no doubt his intention, but unfortunate
ly before he turned honest he had to get
his grandiather's money, and before ho
could get his grandfather's money, he
ran short of ready cash, and was Obliged
to clear out the clothes presses of hi
landlady, as before stated. There was Il
hue and a cry after him, and he ran
away TO England. In England he was
not idle. He was a handsome fellow, as
may be inferred from this description Of

fare of drawing-room and ball. With
these advantages he could work as well
in England as in Paris. and he found
means to commend himself 10 the favor
of lady of the British aristocracy, and
was living very comfortably on the
pocketmoney which she gave him
when the police quietly took him by
the collar. Some sort of defense had to
be made for him as he stood in the
French dock, but il was little to the pur-
pose. The whole case was proven TO
the hilt. He had become the accom-
plice OF his very servants in the
most scandalous kind of robbcries, and
robberies were the least disgraceful

to the last, though he incidentally ad.

have been quite sufficient TO hang him

ANNIE PIxLEY LAST EVENING.",,"NFNA1 tALbh 1AbA N b6AHos r


About one thousand persons greeted
the appearance of Miss Annie Pixley
last evening at the Opera House, in
her play Of ""M'liss, or the Child ofthe
Sierras."" The play Of Mliss was
written for Miss Pixley, and she has
made such a study Of the character
that one is somewhat reminded, and
at times forcibly so, OF Maggie Mitch
ellis creation of Fanchon, tho Cricket.
Miss Pixley has all the childish aban-
don, and at times when crossed IN a
purpose, the same fiery temper Of an
untutored child that has made Maggie
Mitchell such agreat delineator of such
characters. She has such thorough
command over her voice and actions,
that at times she can display anger
and contempt in marvellous manner,
while in the next moment, when she
displays her love for those around her,
one can hardly imagine that it is the
same person. None Of hegactions has
the least appearance Of staginess, but
on the other hand her acting is SO free
from it and is given with such a truth
fulness that 1t seems even more true
than nature. Her acting while show
ing contempt for one of her fellow stu
dents in the person of Olytie Morpher
who is a rival for the affections of the
school master could not have been
equalled by any one. On the other
hand, when she gradually fell in love
with the teacher, the change in her
voice and action is somewhat wonder
full. From the fiery untutored child,
she becomes quite and submissive un-
der the gentle influence of love.


In portraying her devotion to the
school master when he is in trouble
and in rescuing him from his would be
lynchers. was as fine piece of acting
as was ever seen ON the stage. She is
also very fine singer, and upon con-
cluding the song ""Katy come in and
shut the gate"" she was rapturously
applauded, and was compelled to re-
peat it three times before the audience
were satisfied. The company that
supported her was as a rule good. OF
John Z. McDonough, as Yuba Blu, it
is hardly necessary to speak. He is
an excellent actor, and seems well
suited to the character in which he por-
trays, that of the stage driver. He is
easy in his acting and does not seem
constrained in the least. Frank Kill
day gave very amusing portrayal OF
the character of Judge Beessoinger, an
Arkansas Judge, and the audience
showed their appreciation of him by
liberal applause. The other charac-
ters were equally swell performed.


The play of Miss is one that appeals
almost Immediately to an audience. 1t
is not full of pathos, but has its funny
side as well, and there is but little
doubt that Mrs Fulford nee Miss Pix
ley, will make as great a success OF
it, as Maggie Mitchell has of her Fan
chon. She may already count herself
a IavorlJe In Wilmington."

pets In relation to the answers they
should make about the condition of the
books.


Col. Heisler also had made personal
inspection Of the condition OF the War
ren's Biographies In the schools. and
found most OF them ready for rene wal.
He said Boston had recently voted War
ren's books out aud Harpers in the
schools, and ell the teachers thought
the Warren was not a. good A the Har-
per. In conclusion Col Htisler iDdig-
nantIy repelled insinuati0n that he was
actuaie ed In this movement by any mo-
tives of favoritism. He only acted IN
he thought best for the good of the pub
lie aud Of the school children.


Mr.. Bairt argued that If the change
proposed by the Book Committee was
effected The Board would lose not less
than s450, and the studies OF the schol-
ars seriously disarraneed.
p Mr.. Kyne wanted further time to con-
slider the subject, and moved TO lay II
over until the first meeting In Septem-

On Mr.. Lally's motion the motion to
lay over was laid on the tabl@. ..g

THE GEOGRAPHY QUESTION.


There are some members of the
Board, who are determined to spend
money without due regard to the tax
payers, nnd further, which is almost
as vital, without due regard for the
scholars who attend school. 1t ap-
pears from their action last night that
about the time the pupils become used
TO a text book some members are de-
termined to take from the pupils the
books they have been studying for
about a year, and supply them with
new ones, which action has the effect
of putting them back in their studies.


1t has not been but year or SO,
since the Board voted to do away with
Mitchelps Geography, and introduce
Warren's Primary. The pupils had
hardly become conversent with War
ren's before an agent of Harper Bros.
visits the city, and proposes to furnish
Harper Brothers Geography at 30
cents per piece for one year, IN ex-
change for Warren's Primary.
The Book Committee To whom was
referred the proposition, reported a few
| meeting nights ago In favor of using
| Haiper's Introductory Geography In
place of Warren's Primary.


The report was laid over from time TO
time until the meeting last evening
when Mr.. HeisleT called 1t up. for hnal
action. In doing so he spoke at some
length In favor of the change, not on
| The merits uf the book but OH the score
u economy.


Mr.. Keni spoke against the change and
denied that it would be economy to In
Iroduce the new books, but on the coll
trary proved conclusively that It would
cost the Board over four hundred dol
lars. He had sent out blanks to all the
teachers OF the schools, aud from the
answers that he had received there
would be about 1S0 Wanen's needed
during the school year, while # Harper''
are Introduced, there would be l6Ot
needed. The Warren's cost 54 cents
while the Harper's fol the present OF
during tue change would cost 30 cents
and after the change was made, ti'
Board would have to pay 90 cents fo
them. If we cha &c now, one montl
from now we may be asked to chang
again on the score of economy, becais'
other publishers will offer us as goo'
rates as Harper's.


Mr.. Lynch spoke against the change
and during his remarks became some
| WHat pbIbouh tOt winch hO """"o So'iO
10 older twice. He closed by sayin
! that he was not going to allow pc
scheme to pass through the Board by hi
r | vote.


DIR. Grimshaw said that he regrette
exceedingly that the Board did not des
J. in education, hut in fipny bits. He wa
!, opposed to the change on the ground
economy. There was no economy In th
change, because next year the booi
1 would cost 80 cents; when the Boar
e changed from Mitchell's to Warran's
i cost $1,000. He contended that II
z Warren's were superior to the Harper
:. in every way. He hoped the Boal
. would consider the matter carefully, al
i not make the change.

VULTURE MINE, July 6.",,"not b, out of place to let your readers know what we are doing The Fourth was a beautiful morn

 ing, the Stars and Stripes foated

 defiance on the breeze, in New

 York or some other place, we did not show our colors here, for the

 good reason that we had none.

 A Imaginable, alchough serious,

 circumstance occurred here this

 morning before breakfast. It ap-

 pears that two of the boys had got

 into a quarrel about something or

 other, one of the parties being

 fighting drunk, the other sober.

 The hombre who had partaken too

 freely of the intoxicating cup, un-

 dertook too smooth down the sober

 man with a shovel, this was too

 much for human nature before

 breakfast, and the defeneeless man

 yelled out for a pistol. This so

 enraged the inebriate that he threw

 down his shovel, and rushing into

 the first house, grabbed up shot

 gun which he immediately pre-

 sented at the other man. who was still unarmed. A quick change of position unfortunately threw your humble servant between the bellig erents-at the time, I could swear that the barrel of that gun was 24 feet long, and calibre enough for a man to creep into-at this stage of the proceedings, when everybody was expecting a tragedy, a Mexi- can, the owner of the gun, came up and coolly took it away from the man, then a startling discovery was made. it had been a gun, but now it had neither

 LOCK, HAMMER NOR TRIGGER,

 And could not be made to harm a musquito-what a sell. In the evening I paid visit to the saloon of Messrs Strout 6 Peoples; they were doing a rushing business, although the boys were getting boozy. An old eccentric, who has been on a spree since the 4th day of July, 1876, had the floor; it appears, as usual, he was broke, and the boys had just made a subsorip- ton for him that he would call them all up to drink; he got the money, studdied a minute to refresh his Irish wit, then as, bold as lion he marched up to the water barrel and called out, come up and drink, if any of yes don't like water yes needen't drink it. I retired very early, in fact too early, ,or I awoke about three o'clock in the morning, and could not get to sleep again; I got up and went outside to breathe the fresh air and guess at | the time; the sky was clouded, neither moon nor stars being visi- ble, everything being still and solem. l felt a nervous sensation come over me, and almost instantly my eyes turned to the spot wLere Mexican

 HAD BEEN LYNCHED

 Only the week before. Horror of horrors! What did 1 see before me? It was too dark to distinguish correctly, and imagination magnifed the figure, it appearieg like a man twelve feet high. and coming toward me; it looked top-heavy, as it plunged from one side of the road to the other, like ship in distress; my poor legs shook beneath me with fear; my hair, which $ curly, strengthened out like ""quills upon the fretful porcupine;;"" the Lord preserve us, I exclaimed, as I dis covered his ghostship had four arms; I sank to the ground. but only for a moment, self preserva- ton being the first law of nature, I gained my feet and flew to my quarters, and closed the door. For a few moments my heart beat like the big drum in the

 PHGNIX BAND,

 Then I heard a well known voice, hic-hic- ic-fourth-hic -hic-July I had recovered from my fright, and opened the door, when I saw a compadre boarn high up on the shoulders of a swarthy son of Sonora; they had been having good time, one of them being over come, like Jacob, of old, found stone for pillow, and took a nap in the road. His roommate found him and was carrying him to bed, and my ghost vanished.

 EGG MATCHING.

 The foreman of the mine is owner of several fine chickens. A small oox stands at the foot of his bed, n which he keeps eggs, one or two lad been left in the box for some ; ime. What was his surprise yes erday to find that one had actu- lily matched out, and with its for [ ner resident chirping around quite ively. Another came out to-day, ' nd was given to a neighbor who las a hen with a young brood. Io hen had ever set on the eggs, i; nd they were not covered up. The s thermometer is at about eighty de ,rees at it's lowest in this room. 2

 The next room is occupied by f dr. T. Bedding. About a month s lgo little bird came and built it's lest on a shelf few feet from the loor, and close to his bed. The ] ,ird would not be driven away. q"

AFTERNOON SESSION.


At ? o'clock the conference rcasscmbled, and
the regular order Of business, the division Of
the conference district, was taken up aud con-
sidGrcd at great length, deep interest being
manifested in the subject This movement
was introduced in the following resolution,
which was submitted OH Thursday aud laid on
the table.


WnEREAs, It Is believed by many Of the minis.
ters and laymen OF our conference district that
the interests of the churches will be best promoted
| by division thereof therefore


Resolved, That q committee of throe ministers and
| two Hymen bo appointed to arrange Gll prolimi-
q,
| as practicable,


Rev. W. ]. Ncepier, of Dorchester, Nd,
| spoke III favor of tho movement There was
| u natural geographical division of tho distric
mado by Chesapeake bay and the Susqueh anna
river. In the event OF ""a division each part
would bo able to take care OF itself He here
submitted nm exhibit to substantiate his assor-
tion. Proceeding, he said that each would be
very respectable IN point OF numbers; zach
would havo smaller field Of labor, which
would result in better development.


Hon. Howard MeolSs, Of s.. JAmni, VI L., was
heartily in favor Of Il division; it would pro-
mote interest in the church.


Rev. d. f. Benson, Md, was in favor Of
div ision, but said that they We're not yet
aGy for 1t, especially tho churches on tho
Eastern Shore; therefore, they should not act in
haste, but should rather wait until The peo-
ple are educated up to such II movement. He
then moved to amend tho resolution by strik-
ing out the words ""to arrange all prelimiuH-
ros TO that end, and report TO this body as
| soon rs practicable"" and insert, ""to con-
sidnr tho question aud report ut tho next scs-
sion""


Row j. Il. Nichols (Md,) thought that suck
movement would carry them back 10 whore
they were several years ago, and obj aCted to
the postponemont Of the matter.


Rov, f. r. Tags hoped that the time for a
division would como speedily, but the confer
ence was not yet so large as to need ""a
division. Tho Eastern Shore churches are
not yet prepared !or such Il movement. Ho
knew OF several churches both on the East
orn and Western shore, which were no. in
favor Of II division, and ii such step wOro
taken at the present time disorder nl couiu-
sion would onsucs ilo called special att ntiDn
to tho fact that there was strength IN unity,
and not in division. Let rs wait, said he m.
til we get ready for u division, That would
be when they had grown larger and stronger


james X. Cation, of Alexandria, came in
strnctcd by his church 20 offer his voice in
opposition 20 the movement. His people In
the circuit of Virginia were strongly opposed
to u division j, r. Murray gayo notice that
no would vote against the amendment. j.
w. Charlton had u deep aud earnest cuuviC'
tion that the interest in the labor would be
promoted by division Nature has set her
seal upon the question in whichever light 1t
may be observed. On the Eastern Shore thOrO
arc vast missionary fields, openings on unoc.
cupied territory, that need churches and hat


invite and appeal to them, In the
present shape and under the ooustitu-
tion they could not answer to these
appeals, Ministers have too much travelling
to do. Divide the work aud concentrate tho
labor. There are too many easy positions in
the conference. They must have more Of the
missionary zeal and sacrifice. II they divided,
they would mako such advances on both
sides us have not been made In the last twenty
years. Ihey ought TO look At tue SUBJECT IN
tho light of interest to the churches. 1t may
cost a few pangs to separate, hut they would
soon get used 10 that The question Of diyis.
ion is only question of timo, and he believed
that the time was at hand, aud he did not
wish TO have tho question STAYED oil.
Rev. w. NJ. Strayer said there was no faction
about the matter The health Of the ministers


families has to be regarded, A point in favor
of tho division of the churches was that il
would enable the work to develop; it would
improve the president Of the conference and
his reports would give him more time for
thought, aud would enable him to 80 into his
study and give forth something new aud
crisp, aud to study the great questions sub
mitted to him. At preseut there was no com
fort or satisfaction in being president IL
were better to divide at present


Roy. Dr. l.. w. Bates, OF Lynchburg Va, spoke
in opposition to division. lie thought the day
would como when ID would be necessary to
divide, aud ho hoped that day would como
speedily. That time would come, however,
only when the conference had swelled in mem
bership to three or four times its present size.

VIRGINIA..",,"From the Lynchburg News, July Is.


An attempt was made on Monday
last, near Glade Spring, to perpe-
trate an outrage upon the person OF
a little white girl, only ii years OF
age, the offender being a negro fiend
whose name could not be learned
1t appears that the child's parents
were absent from home at the time
having left their daughter with a
younger companion to look after the
premises.


Probably knowing this fact the negri
made his cowardly assault, and wolllt
doubtless have accomplished his lnfan..
Gus purpose but for the timely arriva
Of Mr.. Buchanan, who had been attracted
to the house by the screams of the chill
dren while working IN field near by.


The black rascal had overpowered tn,
little girl and tied her hands, thus rem
dering resistance impossible. He immc

landlady had no suspicion of her lodger,
for he bore noble French name and
was Of princely origin. His mother was
the daughter of the Duke of brunswick.

notice of himself, and he made very
slender provision for her education and

A meaner or more disagreeable day for
game Of base ball than that of yesterday could
not be found If put up specially to order The
raw air sweeping across the seats and field
chilled the spectators and players, and lent
resemblance to the contest as seeking pleasure
under difficulties. While tho weather was un.
comfortable to tho lookers.on, II was extremely
uncomfortable and n great drawback to the
players. They became cold, and their hands
numbed and stiffened until they were almost
beyond use, and II was surprising that, while
in this condition, the players were able to ao-
quit themselves In as commendable manner
as they did. It was not day on which to base
judgment Of tho playing qualities
Of tho men, for none of them could
be expected to present themselves in
good form and show proficiency under such
adverse circumstances. The Brown Univer-
sity nine arrived hero yesterday and located
ut the Imperial Hotel. They are fne-looking
gentlemen, of excellent physique, and at once
produced q favorable impression. By some
mistake the gamo had boon announced for 3:15
p. M, when IL was actually set down to be
called at o'clock. This error drew many
persons to the grounds, who were compelled to
spend unnecessary time waiting in tho cold,
and when game was called there were over 400
persons present-a gratifying audience for
so unpropitious an afternoon.


The Browns"" came into the field attired In
white suits, with black trimmings and black
stockings. The Nationals wore their custom
airy dress of red aud white, in the shape of last
years uniform, the new one not having ar
rived. In consequence OF the sickness of
Derby, which has delayed his arrival, Hines
proilered services were accepted aud lie took

ut the bat, McClelland being tho first to face
the bothersome pitching of Richmond.


The visitors gained the lead at the close of
tho first innings, but lost it in the fourth, and
failed TO recover their vantage ground.


On the part of the visitors the fielding was
good, especially that of Richmond, White
Winslow aud S. Green. Their most costly
error was made by Meader and 1t yielded two
runs for the Nationals. The team played
well together, aud at the bat Richmond, Wins

the spectators watched the performance Of the
visitors, still they were more desirOus OF Sec

with the progress of the game. Snyder was II

position. McClelnnd was treated to some
warm compliments, and while one or two balls
managed to escape him, still with his custom
AIRY pluck, he faced the music and ondoav-
cred to capture everything coming his way.


Lynch looked natural in the pitchers posi-
tlon, and showed good command over the ball
for the short practice he had enjoyed in hand
ling it.


Warner did not have much to do but soon
discovered that tho hot balls he sent to the
first were too swift, and reduced their speed.
Dignan had only one chance, and that was
scarcely within his reach. Baker had one
chance and accepted, while Hines had very
little to do beyond fielding ground, which he
did handsomely to Snyder. Trott, ut first,
had the worst position for rusty man, and
was not long in finding 1t out Still he did
very well for tho first day.
