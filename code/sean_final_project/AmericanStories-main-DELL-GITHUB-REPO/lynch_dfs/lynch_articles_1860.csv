 7Hmsday-C Commencement.

 | THE United States Zouave Cadets, of Chica- go, arrived in New York Saturday morning, in the Albany boat and were received on arrival by detachment of tho 9th regiment. In the afternoon the Zouaves gave all exhibition drill in the Park, which was witnessed by ten thou sand persons The drill was ill Hardie's tactics and the Zouave drill The correctness and pre- cision of tho movements elicited warm encoml- ums from the spectators, and by the general ad- mission of the military connoisseurs present, to be superior to the execution of exercises Of the First Division.

 | A LARGE MEETING was held Tuesday night, in Union Square, New York, of gentleman, many of whom have not before acted with the Repub- lican party. Letters were received from Roger S. Baldwin, James o. Putnam, Willis Hall and Truman Smith, and addresses made by Horace Greeley, Rufus r, Andrews, Daniel Ullman and others. The meeting, a very spirited one, was mainly composed of and managed by those who supported Fillmore in 1856.

 l THE CROPS IN FRAScE.-In France, at the latest mail dates the anxiety ill regard to the crops in some parts of the country was such that the Bishops had ordered the prayers of the church for fair weather.

 JAPANESE LlBERAIIrY.-Mr. Aug Belmonte has been intrusted with the sum of S20,OOO which the late guests of the nation wished to have distributed among the police of New York Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington. But | why the police more than the Common Coun- Gil? Did the sly Japs intend in this way to mark their distinctive appreciation of the men l who persecuted, and the men who protected | them?

 1 THE American artillery has been making ex- periments with riaed cannon loaded with gun cotton. Although the tn ist is very cons;sera- ble, .he pieces can be loaded at the muzze. At l the last account they had succeeded in throwing a six-pound ball three miles with six ounces of gun-cot'on. These guns arc very light, and this, with the small quantity of ammunition required, renders them particularly applicable to moul- tain warfare especially as it is possible to fire for considerable time before the enemy can learn whence the shots are coming, since the gun-cotton makes no smoke.

 | MR. F. c. KELLOGG, of Hartford, has already succeeded in producing by artificial means about one thousand trout, which are now doing we'll. A small stream in East Hartford has been used for this purpose

 THE New Haven City Directory this year con- tains II, ,673 names, which is an increase of l,26O over last year. The Hartford Directory for 1860 has 8 s,500 names

 TIE New Haveners are talking about Ma tional Horse Show on Brewster Park this fall | LARGE FIRE IN NEW YoAK-An extensive conhagration occurred, on Monday afternoon, among some stables and shanties in one of the lower wards, by which half block of buildings were burned, and forty-three families rendered houseless. Total loss about S27,OOO.

 THE CH1cAGo Zo-AvEs are astonishing the peo. pie of New York by the elegance of their ap. pearance, and the unrivalled effect of their WOE. derful drill. On Monday, they gave a public exhibition of their skill il military maneuv,e on Madison Square, before many thousand specta tors.

A NEW ROMANCE.",,"


derful and romantic By high colorixg and eNaage-
ration. This was before the age of railroads,
steamships, and magnetic telegraphs before the
press had given to the world so many booas of
travel and VIXEN cur ideas of distant regions and
peoples were obtaired mostly by hearsay. The
author of q Gulliver7s Travels y ridiouled thispre
pcnsity, and to some extens put a stop to it. Bat
the old privilege of the traveller into distant
countries to heighten the interest of his narrktive
by making strange stories out of triiitng circum-
stances, and so emhelishing his account Of per-
sonal adventures as to cause the auditor to open
wide his eyes with astonishment, exists yet, it ap
pears, in a considerable degree. At least, he so
conclude from book inst about to be published
in New York by one Frederick Law Glmstead, de-
scrptive of the travels of that gentleman in Texas
Mississippi, Virginia, and other States qf the
South.


A foretaste of this wonderful book has been
gigen US in the shape of liberal extracts from it
in the columns of the New York Tribune and Even
ing Post. These extracts relate mostly to hdven
lures in Mississpp-to the incidents Of his journey
his moving accidents by food and field his en-
counters with the people, Of all sorts and descrip
tions-and his views Of negro slavery, as derived
sfrom personal observation. MFR. Frederick Law





have picked up all the facts and incidents that he
narrates in this volume. He has found out more
about slavery and about the South, in the course
of few weeks travel than many Of our Oldest
citizens who have lived in the South all their lives
have ever dreamed Of.


IN illustration of Mr.. 0mstead's style, md the
fertility Of his inventive powers, we give the fol-
! lowing extract, purporting to be an account of
conversation he had with Mississippi negro:
A PIous SLAVE Soon I met ragged old negro,
of whom asked the way, and at what house within
twelve miles had better stop. He advised me to
go to one more than twelve miles distant.
g SUPPOSE"" said /, a can stop at any house
along the road here, can't I2i' They all take in
Travellers""


Yes SIR if you'll take rough fare, such as trav-
elers has to, sometimes. They're all damned ras
Gals along dis road for ten or twelve miles, and
you'll git nothin' but rough fare But say massa,
rough fares good enough for dis world, amt it,
massas Dis world amt nothin': dis Is he'll, dis is,
calls it; hell to what's comm arter, ha ha Ef
you's prepared? you says. ! don't look mucf's if
/ was prepared, does l. nor talk like it nuther.
De Lord he cum to me in my cabin in de night time,
in de year 49,


g WhatN a55u
.sDe Lord, massa de Dressed Lord He cum
to me in de night time in de year As, and he says
to me- says he, "" I'll spare you five years longer,
old boy.' So when 80 cum round Thought my
time had cum sure but as | didn't die, / reckon





be saved, dough don't look much like it ha ha!
hO. ho de Lord am my rock, and lie shall not per-
wall over me. | will lie down in green pastures
and take up my bed in hell yet will not His mercy
circumwent me. Got some tobaecy, master?'


Now no one at all familiar with the style Of talk
Of the negro race in the South will believe that any
such conversation as that related by Mr. olmstead
ever occurred. He has taken his cue evidently
from the broad carfcatures of the negro race we
see in the travelling Ethiopian opera troupes. The
conversation is like that Of Bones ana Julius on
the stage, when one asks the other ""coumbus.''
It is more like the ordinary talk of negro on
Mississippi plantation than it is like CAoctaw or
Chinese. Who ever knew genuine negro that
had any idea Of time or Of distanee3 Who ever
heard one speak publicly of whole community
being set Of rascals2 Who ever knew one to say
""perwailn y or e eircumwentWi Who ever knew
one to indalge in the confusion of metaphor dis
played in the two or three concluding sentences
quoted? Mr.. 0lmstead has evidently LOST sight of
the first rule of all successful story.tellets-to keep
probability in view. 3 @
In another place this veraeious chlonicer de-
tails the difficulties of obtaining food and lodging
in Virginia, between Lynchburg and Farmville. 1t
seems that sick traveller, going along between
those points, applied for entertainment at four diff
ferent houses, and was fatly refused at all of them.
In vain lie pleaded that he was weak and faint--in
vain he urged that the night was dark and he did
not know the road. He was turned off Huccessvely
from four different houses, and surIily told to go
on his way, sick as he was and dark as was the
night.


Does Mr.. 0lmstead expect anybody to believe
this scandalous story? Can he think that his read
ers are so erednlous, that this Wholesale SANDER
upon the generous and well-known hospitality of
the Old Dominion will be accepted by them as the
truth


These are specimens of the new bPok which is
about to be given to the public, purPorting to be
descriptive of Southern manners Southern institu-
tions and Southern society. We do not suppose
Mr., 0lmstead writes this book for thu purpose of
infiaming the prejudices already too bitter and in
every instance unjust which exist ID his section
against the people and the institutions of the South.
Certainly in the present condition of affairs, polit-
ical and social, we must regard its appearance to
say the least of 1t, as ill-timed and Unnecessary
and not the least suspicious circumstance CON
nected with it is the commendaton bestowed upon
the volume by such papers as the Tribune and
Evening Post.

He was the Jack Sheppard among thieves.


When Beaumont accomplished the immor.
,alizing feat (amongst his brethren) he had
just returned from the Bagne (he galeys)
at Brest. 1t took place in the days of the
celebrated Vidocq. He actually robbed the
strong box at :he head police office, and this
box contained not only bank notes, but all
the jewery which is found, or in any way
comes into the hands Of the police. After
his return from the galleys, he frequently
called upon Monsieur Henry, the principal
officer of the second divis on of police, and
these visits were made under pretence of
making certain revelations or giving useful
Information, in the hope of becoming at
tached to the police himself


cashiers office. In going and coming,
Beaumont had keys made to fit them. This
was doubtless, great point gained but it
was not all; it was necessary to watch mo-
ment when the cashier was out, not at home,
or having left his Office, and when Monsieur
Henry, who never scarcely was absent, should
be away. Every thing turns well for those
who choose to wait patiently. Beaumont
found the long watched for opportunity, and
as he never did anything hastily, he did all
at his ease this time, and as cleverly as quiet.
ly. lie put on black coat belonging to
Monsieur Henry, dress then little worn
except by those in high Office; he walked
down stairs and went TO the nearest guard
house, asked for the officer, who took him
for some high official, and two soldiers were
sent with him, without the least difficulty.


Beaumont gravely placed them, one at
each end of the corridor, with strict orders
to let no one pass until further directions
1t WAS very daring but equally sure. When
he had made his selections among heaps of
precious things, and filed his pockets with
gold and jewels, he passed one of the sem
tnels, and said:


That's right, my friend. l am going to
the head directors. Everything must remain
as have left it until my return; l shall soon
be back; let no one pass""


But the office hours arrived, and all the
clerks, too, high and low.


""You can't pass"" they were told.


So they all went out, and walked up and
down the yard. Some, however, went
around, at last, tired of waiting, to the other
entrance.


""You can't pass"" saluted their ears again.


Then came the heads of police, and lastly
Monsieur Henry himself. who did not take
matters quite so quietly. lie ran to the
guard house. The officer knew nothing of
the rank or name of the func,ionary who
had asked for guard To release the SOL
ders from their duty, the minister Of police
had to be sent for, and they got in. If -
thunderbolt had fallen among them all. they
could not have been more dumbfounded.-
The strong box was rfed, and the ground
strewed with rejected valuables Who could
have done it? TO whom attribute the au
dacious act? All the persons employed were
under examination and suspicion, when
Beaumont was betrayed by comrade, and
condemned second time. He had stolen
several hundred thousand francs, the greater
part Of which was found upon him.

a plug of the hugest dimensions he handed
it to the applicant, who, taking out his knife,
cut off about one fifth of it, with the observa-
ton, There's tobacco enough for any man.,

indignant reply.

observed, and handing him the small piece.
he put the plug in his pocket and walkod

The Register denounces the removal
Col. Evans from the Land Office at Glen
coe. 1t says:


Col. Evans, as good an officer as there is in
the State, has been removed from the Forest
City Land Office-thus closing that concern
while thousands of pre.emptOrs are waiting to
pre.empt their lands. The sales are coming off
in a few days, and settlers are tlocking to the
office from all parts Of the district to preempt.
When the get there they cannot transact their
business. This is gross outrage. If the Of
fee should ever be open, it is at this time. 1t
seems as if the President and the Devil had
entered into a conspiracy to rob the citizens of
their h0mesteads.


Federal Offices in Minnesota are very un-
certain. Removals depend upon the whims
of men, the reports of spies, and the liber-
ality OF incumbents.


GREAT damage has been done in Mcleod
county by prairie fires. Especially is this
the case in the neighborhood of Glencoe,
several buildings, grain stacks, &C., having
been destroyed in that vicinity. Says the
Register:


The prairie was set on fire by miserable,
dangerous, misanthropical old bachelor, who
resides some two miles northwest of town.
The public we're so incensed against him that
there was danger of Lynch law, but the better
feelings of the people ruled, and he is to be
tried by civil law, which will be put in force
against him, thereby securing him from the
danger of dogs biting his heels for the next
three years.


We clip the following from the Register:


A German woman near the residence of Rev.
Henry Elliott, in Helen, this county, whose hus-
band was absent, on Wednesday last saw
huge bear make his way into the hog pen, al.
ready cooked and primed for a mess of fresh
pork. The good frau had no idea of parting
with her fat hog, and picking up sled stake,
made for the bear. Nr. Bruin, his mouth wa
tering for the breakfast that was before him,
paid but little attention to the woman, but
her hands with the stake, across the nose of the
bear while he was engaged with the hog, laid
him out-dead as herring. Such woman is
worth having. She is worthy to be the wife of
Daniel Boone-Or any one else.


Mr.. w. F. ELLIOT, of the Register office,
on returning from his labors to his residence
adjoining the village on Wednesday eve-
ming, came upon four deer, close to his house.
Unfortunately the only weapon he had was
his ""rule,"" and he was obliged to see them
scamper off without sending cold lead af-
ter them. Deer are plenty here. They
pass through our village quite frequently.


TIE Warden of the penitentiary at Still

lives of several citizens, in Calhoun county,
Florida, by shooting. The following order
of the q. S. Judge to the U. S. Marshal,
serves to explain the nature of the difficulty:

This county has been declared to be in
state of insurrectionary war by the Hon. j. S.

Of the State of Florida.

The Land Office has ordered the rules for
surveying in California to be applied to the
public lands in Arizona, by which all the
mineral lands will be omitted from the pub.
bile survey. This ruling prevents the loca-
tion of mines by private parties, and leaves
them open to be worked by any one, as they
are in California. There is no positive law
for this, but it is consistent with the previ-
ous policy of our government.


AT Van Buren, Arkansas, on the 18th,
three men named Rufus and Jackson Gov
iDgton, brothers, and son of the latter,
were killed by two brothers named Silas and
Ben Edwards. Several others were badly

existed between the parties, but the led

While trying to make their escape they were
overtaken by the constable and his posse

Body SerUant Selling HimSeif-In the Express
of Friday we published under the caption,
""Romance and Crime"" an account of the ar
rest OF a celebrated forger, named James Bu-
chanan Cross, accompanied by young, beau
tiful, elegant and accomplished female, and
servant man so nearly white that the closest
scrutiny failed to detect African blood in his
veins The negro, whose name is Robert
Burnell, alias Smith, says Pittsburg paper,
was regarded as a white man at the hotel and
it was only after his arrest that the proprietor
discovered that the individul on whom he had
been lavishng attentions for the past two
weeks was neither more nor less than slave.
His master treated him at all times as his
equal. They visited restaurants in company,
playing billiards together, and associated at a
times on terms Of equality.


1t now appears that the colored man so fiat
teringly alluded to is no other person than
""Bob Burnell,"" SO well known in Lynchburg
as the former popular bartender at the Cabell
and Norvel houses. He was purchased from
his owner, VIM. NJ Burwell, Esq, of Bedford
county by Cress, who sojourned in this city
for short time, during the summer of 1857.
He represented himself as New Orleans
broker; said he was affected with fits, and
was anxious to purchase trustworthy and
intelligent servant who would be with him at
all times. Making the acquaintance of Bob at
the Noryell House, mutual liking very soon
sprung up, and beftr he left he purchased the
negro, paying 81 eco for him. y draft, which
was duly honored by some house north, was
given for the amount. Soon after leaving
here Bob. says the party went to Paris,
where, after remaining some time, he lost his
owner, says lie searched for him several days,
but without success. He then went to the
Enboccv Of DnriS noa6a n statement
of the facts in the case to Judge Mason, our
Minister, and finally prevailed on the Judge to
employ him as servant in his family.


He remained with Judge Mason until the
death of that gentleman; was with him when
he died, closed his eyes, and shrouded him,
and returned with his remains to this country.
A day or two after his arrival in New York
city he accidentally met with his master, the
two being mutually pleased with the meeting.
Not long afterwards Cross sent him to Paris
on business he remained there few weeks
and then returned to this country. He was in
Italy some time, and in the vicinity of Sol
ferino when the celebrated battle was fought


On Thursday last Bob very Unexpectedly
made his appearance in this city. The object
of his visit at this time is to raise ST 400, for
which he is to be mortgaged. He brings a
power of attorney from his owner, authorizing
him to make this arrangement The written
instrument also directs that fifty dollars of the
money shall be handed to Bob, and the remain
der sent to Cross, at Philadelphia When it
was intimated to Bob that most persons would
be afraid to invest money in a man as white
as himself, he at once remarked that he ""con-
sidered himself a gentleman, and would re-
main the faithful slave of any one who would
pay the desired sum of money""


He processes to have the most unbounded
confidence in the honor of his master, as well
as his ability to extricate himselffrom his pres
ent difficulties. He says there exists no proof
to substantiate the charges on which he was
arrested, and that his innocence will be clear
ly established. We are inclined to think that
Bob is singular in his belief Bob further
says that ever since he left Lynchburg he has
passed for white man, and has never associa-
ted with persons of his own race. Bob is a
decided character in his way and we hope he
may succeed in his way and we hope he may
succeed in securing a good master.-Peters-

fred Buchanan, the young man arrested at a
village on the Erie railroad, on Monday,
charged with the murder Of Mrs. Shancks, was
brought back to New York on Thursday, in
custody. On his arrival, he was met by large
and excited crowd, who threatened to lynch
him on the spot, but the officers succeeded in
conveying him safely to prison. He is said to
be the youngest son of a very respectable fam.
lily Of New York. Though he makes no direct
confession, he admits that he knew the murder
ed woman, and that he was drunk the morning
the crime was committed. There are several
cuts and bruises on his hands and wrists, as if
made by broken glass bottles. This is sig.
ni6cant circumstance, inasmuch as the floor Of
the room where Mrs. b. was killed was strewn
with the remains Of broken glass bottles. Glass
was also found in the crushed portion Of the
sknll. The clothes of the prisoner are also
stained with blood.


Buchanan is but nineteen years Of age. His
eye hos a wild and glittering stare, and all his
movements are restless. His father, who keeps
a carpenters shop, corner of Broadway and
Twelfth streets, states that his son has been
long subject to fits, and that he was once in

Heenan virtually won the battle, but will be
ready to renew the struggle at an hours no

LECTURE AT THE SNITHsoNrAN.-The intro.
ductory lecture of the season was delivered last
evening to a large audience by Professor Fred.
erick Rogers, or the University of Pennsyl.
vania. The subject was Civil Engineering,
and the lecturer announced that the special de.
partment for the evening would be Roads and
Bridges. Roads, he said, logically, should be
first described. He should devote but little
time to roads, as their history is soon told.
Merely tracks, trails, or marked paths, were
used in less civilized ages. Sometimes these
were made by man, sometimes by beasts, and
we're called bridle.paths. Our common roads
are called by Europeans paths. Necessity has
not yet developed our system Of road building
so perfectly as time may.


Railroads have such numerous points of in.
terest that it would be difficult to trace them in
one evening.


In locating roads, the points must be ascer.
tanned, and if entirely level, little difficulty
would prevent going directly from one to the
other but this rarely occurs.


In engineering 1t Is necessary 10 ascertain
whether the curve required be vertical or hori.
zontal. On horizontal curve no friction is to
be overcome, more than on q straight horizon.
tai plane, or at least very little. When raising
the weight the attraction has to be overcome,
and the load lifted that distance.


Expense is to be looked at, and engineering
may be called the science Of expediency. The
lecturer then described minutely the primary
steps to be taken in the location Of roads. In
this country there have not been careful surveys
of every locality, therefore much more is left for
the engineer to perform.


We can tell by the streams as drawn on
maps what the surface Of the country is through
which it passes, whether level or hilly. A very
winding stream is almost absolutely indicative
of level surface. Where straight streams are
indicated we may expect rapids. Here the
Professor illustrated these thoughts by draw.
ings, in a manner which evinced his familiar.
ity with his subject and faculty of impsrting in.
struction.


The method of illustrating by what is called
the contour lines has recently come into vogue.
Here the Professor drew some figures, which
gave an excellent idea, not only to the expert,
but was apparent to almost any one. This
method, he said was Of great use to the en-
gineer. The illustration showing the vertical
and horizontal distances on a contour map was
very happy. The working map should be made
on this plan.


His brief yet beautiful description Of the
| Swiss roads over the Alps, among the glaciers,
and through the passes, was extremely inter.
esting.


The next lecture of the course will be deliv.
cred January I'd.

| A PLEASANT AFFAIR.-On Thursday after.
noon, the pupils of Primary School No. l, in
the third district, of which Miss Frances Ell.
vans is principal, presented that lady with a
beautiful silverplated cake basket. The pre-.
sentation speech was made by Master Isaac
Bassett, who acquitted himself admirably.
The teacher, after expressing her sincere


thanks for the generous token, requested Mr..


McKnew, one Of the trustees, to say something


in her behalf That gentleman responded in


q very neat manner, referring, before he con


cluded, in solemn and touching language, tc


the recent death of one of the scholars-ar


interesting little girl, the daughter of Mr.


James Lynch-which drew tears from almost


every eye. After which, Miss Elvans handed tc


Mr. McKnew q beautiful work-box, requesting


him to present it to Miss Emma Tucker one oftht
assistant teachers, which he did, accompanying


the presentation with few very neat and ap


propriate remarks to which Miss Tucker re.


sponded, sincerely thanking them for the pres


ent.


advice TO LADIEs-A lady complains Il

do. The gallant editor recommends her il
such o case to place herself in the lap of tn


best looking one in the crowd.

 of the present canvass. The editor is an

 original gg iisaal Douglas man, and we commend

 his patriotic suggestions to the attentive lperusal of all Douglas men

 | To cry over spiltmilk is a whim, barely ex-

 cusable in prattiing child but when indulg- cd by adults and sensible men, it is an inexcu- sable and disgusting folly and weakness. The 1 faults which have been committed are irreme- diable now, and we consult neither the duty of patriots or statesmen when we stop to criminate and recrfmimate amongst ourselves as to the causes and agencies which precipi- tated our present disasters upon us. The na- ked question now presented for the solution of every Democrat is: shall Virginia be lost or saved to Democracy in the pending contest?

 Shall the glorious flag of our party continue

 to wave in unbrolsen triumph over our soil, or be permitted to trail in the dust of disgraceful defeat! For ourselves, we hesitate not to say that Virginia must not be lost, that she must

 and shall be saved. And we call upon the ""Spartan band"" of Democracy in Lynchburgy

 with whom, shoulder to shoulder, we have

 fought an hundred battles-~and we call upon that noble army of Democratic friends in all,

 the surrounding country, who have so often

 sent up their triumphant greetings on the day

 of battle--we invoke them to gird on their ar-

 nor and march to the affray. Especially do

 we call upon the friends of Judge Douglas to

 abandon that distinguished gentleman. Did

 Judge Douglas stand the least chance to carry

 the State--did we not know that he is not as

 strong by far in Virginia as MT. Breckinridge,

 we would not make this appeal. On the com

 trary, if we believed he was as strong as

 Breckinridge, we declare here that We would fling his flag to the breeze and fight for him to the close of the campaign with as much zeal as we expect to battle For our present ticket. But no candid man will pretend to say that such is the case. No man thinks that there is ghost of chance to carry the State for any one but Breckinridge and Lane or Bell and Everett.

 A vote for Douglas, therefore, in tie present aspect of affairs, is vote for the 0ppositi0B. It can do Douglas no good ,and will do Breck- inrdge harm It will weaken our cause, without improving in the least that of Mir. Douglas. Why, then, in the name of patriotism, should any Democrat cling to the fortunes of Judge Douglas? Every Democrat at the North ought to vote for him, because there he is strong and has the best chance of success. But here, in Virginia, he has no chance, and every Democrat ought to vote to secure the State for Breckinridge and Lane, or, for that Democrat who can defeat Lincoln. Because it may be, under one of the resolutions of the Charlottesville Convention, that the vote of Virginia may be cast for Douglas, even though Breckinridge electors may be chosen. Is not this fair and patriotic9 Does any Douglas Democrat want the vote of Virginia thrown away? Do not all of them want 1t cast in the best way to defeat Lincoln? Why, then, vote for electors who confessedly stand not ghost of chance to carry the State :?

 When we resume our editorial duties Gin few days) we think we shall be able to con vince every reasonable Douglas Democrat in Vfrof .iasf ,at ft0n of dutV patriotism requires him to sustain the flag we sustain. h the meantime. we think the sim- pie fact that our ife-long enemies, the Whigs, are shouting their notes of anticipated victory in our ears, Haunting their flags in our face, and laughing in their sleeves at our suicidal liyision, is sufficient to arouse the ancient ire of every Democrat, and make us all band of brothers.

 Once more to the breach, then, Democrats, lear friends, once more"

and ex governor OF Washington territory, was
riding across the railroad track near Lynch
burg, Va, last Friday, wheu a passing train
killed his horse under him and left him sitting
on the font Of the engine. The engineer
pulled him i'll without injury in the slightest
degree.


In the heart of white oak tree, in Green.
bush, New Brunswick, recently, was found an
InCian hatchet, where it had been embedded
two centuries. The hatchet was struck in its
place when the tree had about thirty years
growth, and since then the concentric circles of
two hundred years have bonnd it i'll its place.


Ohm e. Owens, the tavorite comedian now
manager Of theater in New Orleans, recently
received a letter from a black mail correspond
ent, threatening terrible revelations through
the National Police Gazette, unless 5000 were
Immediately paid him. John chad no hesita-
ton in saying, and he said it boldly"" that
such conduct was damnable, and placed the
matter in the hands Of the police, by whom the
scOundrel was arrested.


Ezekiel Barnes, Il veteran, who died recent
ly i'll Ohio, voted for sixty-nine years consec

 SAN FrAxcIsco, August p, 1860.

 We will carry this State by decisive majority llysx t1emocracy are raliying aroun1 our banne Srbso San Diego to Liskyou. The contest will b rarns. but there is no doubt of the result. Th' 6fcction in our party is coIliincd to the leaders hTid scarcely touches the masses. 3 VIM. M. GYlN.

 Hon. I: STEVENS, Chairman, etc.

 MIssoUR 1 Senator Green and Polk, and Hon. Jas IB. BowIin, are conducting the campaisi kor Breckinridge and Lane with great vigo In Missouri. It is high satisfaction t know that these able champions have en kered so earnestly into tae fight. I The recent elections there were no test hf Iuglas' strength, and the democrats o

 FIT tatc will most willingly go for Breck

 l when convinced he is the stronges q FS1s Therc is already decided re-actS m ft.1hvor.

 ARKANSAS. E Hkckinridge is certain of Arkgssas.--- lGhe most candid of the Bell an9Douglas linen admit this. It would be ycessary for

 glas to get l3, ,Ooe votes j'ordcrt to give

 E prospect of carrying the State and g Inc man believes Dor can get hall hsfSote. When any Q, tells you Douglas

 p get l3, 1000 votes Arkansas you may Ibc sure he is sciYay tying. Arkansas will go for Breckyddge and Lane as surely las South CaroliT doos Lol3fsIANA.

 Senator SBdea, who has just arrived in Washingtor, kings much animating intel |ligcncc frow the South. Louisiana, his own State ,(will give decisive victory to Brvckinrtl lgo and Lane.

 Itis freely necessary to add that Slidell's .opinio1 is werth ten thousand know noth- sing sf Douglas Canards.

 v TEXAS. IJDouglas has no ticket in that State and tho. probability is that Breckinridge will carry it by two-thirds majority So the recent State elections indicate.

 MISSISSIPPI.

 This State is universally conceded to Breckinridge, except by a few 'shald-shall ; know nothings-rare compounds of credu lity and self-importance--a class of men we never protend to reason with.

 x ALABAMA.

 Yancey and Fitzpatrick, rival leaders of the democracy, are for the constitutional ticket, Jhc leading papers and nearly all the leading men are for the same--put Ala bams down for Breckinridge.

 GEORGIA. 4 Georgia correspondent of the Journal of Commerce Says: z You know the fact tat Douglas, Bell and Breckinridge parties exist in Georgia. Douglas will hsnlly re- 5eive ten thousand votes; Bell about tllirty . thousan9, BreclSinridge will receive the balarss. Georb ip wiET fasE at lssst one hun red and tea thousand votes h will ba seen thas BsgSls se ana Zane can beat even n fuss sekefof so Bell md Douglas fosees Is ither can naidates should get a majority sion would go into the legislature, wh .sssekinriage has .n overwhelming maj aits--an indication of the bias of the State.

 SOUTH CAROLINA. ng shees ! w days since that even t3ontr- garQaGs.a ss Fa go for Bell, if the people ua a direct ote in the matter. We don't believe Bels man can be found in the State if a Sl,0O0 reward was offered for him. Extreme ignorance could alone prompt any one to assert such an lmproo- able falsehood.

 NORTH CAROLINA.

 Gov. Ellis, Breckinridge and Lane dem ocrat. has been elected Governor by a large majority.

 The Senators, Congressmen, and all the leading democratic papers are for our ticket. Even Kenneth Rayner, the Chevalier Bayard of the whig party, has declared for Old Rip is wide awake.

 vIRGI INIA.

 Froa every portion of the ""mother of Presidcnts.'', we have ample proof that Breckinridge and Lane will carry that State. The folfawing are few among the many evidences we could cite:

 The Virginia Sentinel. published at Alex andria, makes the following statement: eve her the most gratifying accounts of the state of opinion in Farquier county. The democ racy do not intend to be divided in order to ac commodate the Bell party. -rOn Monday last Mir. Rust, Of AfkaUsts, NHu uiiuci OLHcf CllcuH- stances would have been gladly welcomed to his native county by her sterling democracy. made a speech that was so violently denunc:atory of the Breckinritige democracy, and was so clamorously applaudcd by the whigs as to disgust number of MT. Douglas most valued supporters, whose names have been stated tous. The Flag wishes he would repeat it-sthe effect was admirable.'

 The Sentinel adds that from all parts of the State it receives similar accounts.

 The Front Royal Warren county Ga zette says:

 Already have hundreds of democrats, whose first choice was Douglas, seeing where the leaders of that party arc driving them, declared for Breck inridge; and before the election we shall find hun dreds more determined to save the State from the opposition, and by their aid, we cannot doubt that victory will perch on our banner, and the glorious Old Dominion remain trlle. as heretofore ta s''' democracy and the Uinon.

on the Sd inst, Mr.. Barber, a watchman, OBJ

sluices. Mr.. Barber followed and overlook
him, and presenting double -barreled shot
gun at him, ordered him not to move or he
was a dead man. The fellow very coolly
asked him if he was tson the shoot"" and
being satisfied that he was, surrendered at
discretion and walked in advance of his
captor to town. Late as 1t was, near mid
| night, a number of miners assembled and
organized themselves into court by choos-
ing jury of twelve men, who found the
man guilty of an attempt to rob sluices and
sentenced him to receive forty lashes on the
bare back with rawhide. A Communication
of the sentence was offered the man if he
would divulge the names of his confederates,
but he persisted in the assertion that he had
none, and received the whole forty lashes.-
The trial and 'hogging were not concluded
until after two o'clock in the morning. The
wretehis back was then washed and some
stimulus given him, after which he coolly
asked the barkeeper of the public house to
which he had been taken, if he hadn't a ci-
gar to give him. He was told to clear out
and never come about the place again.


We have always deprecated the use of the
lash, either by legal officers or popular ju-
ries, believing it to be not only vitiating in
its tendencies and inbumane, but absolutely
useless for heprecention ofcrime, which ought
to be the only aeotfgetor punishment. But in
this particular instance such unusual mode
ration was observed, and the crime of sluice
robbing is one so common, SO ruinous to the
honest laborer, and the sluice robber can so
seldom be caught or convicted, that we do
not feel disposed to comment with any Sc
verify upon the practice we have heretofore
opposed. We remain of the opinion, how
ever, that fogging does not lessen the num-
claim nowadays, knows that he is risking
his life by the actor every paying claim is
guarded by night watchman-and if the
fear of death will not deter him, fear of the
lash must prove much less potent. At any
time we would rather hear of the shooting
of robber right in his tracks, than of that
utterly useless cruelty which weakens the
sentiment of humanity in those who behold
it, violates laws formed by the people them
selves, and affixes stigma to the name Of
our entire State abroad."

SPEAKING IN THE CoUNTY.-A vigorous
and exciting canvass is now going on in this
county, and meetings are held at half dozen
different points every evening. II the people
do not vote right, it will rot be for lack of eff
forts to enlighten them. Mr.. Palmer spoke at
Mooney Flat yesterday evening, and speaks
again this evening at Omega. Messrs. Belden
and Caldwell are also announced to address the
people at Washington, tonight, and McCon-
nell and Dibble speak at Red Dog. The
Breckinridgers and Lincolnites are supposed
to be doing great deal of private canvassing,
but do not exhibit the activityof the Douglas
men. The Belleveretts give themselves no un-
easiness, but knowing they cannot carry the
State 1iopoood <o Let Il. a. =
course.


MEETING AT RoUGH & READY.-Messrs.
Mcconnell and Dibble spoke at Rough &
Ready yesterday evening, in accordance with
previous announcement. An arrangement had
been made for political discussion between
Messrs. Dibble and Whiteside, but the latter
failed to come and Judge Searls and C. w.
Hill went down to supply his place. McCon-
nell and Dibble offered them the most liberal
terms, which they refused to accept but pre-
ferred to grind out their Secession arguments
to bakers dozen of hearers, after Dibble had
concluded his speech. We learn that McCon-
nell and Dibble had fine audience, and with
the exception Of one or two attempts by some
rowdies to break up the meeting, every thing
passed off well.


SLUIoE RoBBER KILLED.-We learn from
MIR. Colby, the expressman to Eureka town.
ship, that Frenchman named La Blange was
shot and killed, in the mining claims of Chas.
Haskell, near Arnold's Ranch, last Wednesday
night. He was shot by Mr.. Knifer, the night
watchman, while in the act of robbing the slui-
ces. The robber was armed with revolver,
which he discharged at Knifer after he had re-
ceived mortal wound, but fortunately without
effect man suspected of being an accom-
plice of La Blange has been arrested at Hum
bug.


The TIcKETs.-The Democratic tickets for
Nevada county have the words ""For Conven-
ton"" and ""Pay the Debt"" Those opposed to
calling Constitutional Convention can scratch
out the words ""For Convention"" and their
votes will then count against the measure. In
order to vote against paying the balance of the
old State debt, voters must write the words
""Repudate the Debt"" on their tickets. We
hope there will be no votes in the county
against paying the debt.


BOARD OF SUPERvIsoRs.-NextM Monday is
the day fixed by law for the regular meeting of
the Board Of Supervisors to transact county
business. But as the Board could not be in
session on Tuesday, on account of the election,
and will have to meet on the second Monday
after the election to canvass the returns. the

postponed until Monday the 10Th inst.

TINEs.-A correspondent of the Columbia
Courier, writing about Slate Creek, in Sierra
county, says:


Whilst am speaking of this place, I will
refer TO bloody murder which occurred at
the Slate Creek House, in 1851. The story
Is that Mcdonald, who then owned the house
one night got into game of poker with his
cook and three other men, miners in the
neighborhood Mcdonald quarreled with
the men, and cook struck him with bar of
iron, and the Others finished him. They tnen
buried him in hole about three feet square
divided his money-some four hundred dol
lars only among themselves, and departed
The cook gave out that Mcdonald had gone
below, to San Francisco, and he remained
two weeks, keeping the house as usual. He,
however, did two things from which he was
suspected. The first was, he hired man for
three dollars to fell tree in a particular di-
rection, which would have covered up the
grave of Mcdonald, but the axe was dull,
and the man desisted after a little remark
ing he would be dalUNed if he would cut
tree with such an axe. Whilst talking with
him, the man saw some blood on tile helve
and remarked it was singular to have blood
on the choppiug axe. The cook colored up
and stammered out something about chop
ping some meat with it. This incident led
to inquiry aboui Mcdonald, and some of his
friends wrote to the San Francisco papers to
advertise for him. About this time, the cook
sent some money down to a lawyer, to send
home for him. The lawyer having seen the
advertisement, instead of sending home the
money for him, came up to Pine Grove and
made statement This reused the miners.
and they determined to arrest the cook. and
the others who had been loafnr around
there. Accordingly crowd came over and
arrested the cook, but found the others had
gone home to their cabin on Canon Creek
They succeeded in arresting two others, but
the fourth resisting, and refusing to be taken
alive, was shot in his tracks. A miners
court was then held on the principles of
Judge Lynch, when it being proved, bv the

slave law-they had voted TO repeal the Mis-

Texas, and add thereby three hundred thous
and square miles of saveholding territory to
the nion-they had voted against protective
tariff laws, of which South Carolina once
complained so bitterly, and on account Of
which she was about to leave the Union
they had struggled in their respective States
to prevent the enactment of laws to shield

received at the hands of South Carolnians
For our part. we have no hesitation in saying
that we will not go with South Carolina or
with William Yancey and his followers, in
their attempts to dissolve the Union. The
star spangled banner is not yet odous to our
sight, nor do we 10y any means despair of tie
Republic. We still have confidence in the
National Democratic party. We look to
Baltimore for confirmation of that confidence,
and for a ticket which will triumph in No

Constitution"" and tie Union, and against all
who would trarple on the one or dissolve
the other As for Mr.. Yancey we leave him
to the tender mercies of the Alabama De-
mocracy-they will dispose of him."

Synopsis Of Gov. weI1er's Last Annual


Message.",,"This document was sent to both Houses on
Monday last, one week after their organization.
We make the following hasty and meagre syn
opsis Of its contents:


The Message commences with an effort to
throw upon the Legislative department the blame
for the extravaganza which has characterized
the expenditure of the public monies during the
year, by making the complaint that his recon-
mendations have received but little attention at
the hands of Legislators This effort to shirk
responsibility will prove futile. If the extrava-
gance is the result of laws passed during his
adminstration-and such is the case--then he
is responsible Certainly if the annual expend-
itures had greatly fallen off during his term, he
and his friends would justly have claimed the
credit thereof for his administration.


While admitting that the expenditures were
greater during the year than they should have
been, he states that the Treasury is in pletho-
ric condition. The amount of money received
into the Treasury from Jan. lst, 1859 to Dec
l5th 1859, was Sl,l7OS35 O3. Expenditures
during the same period, S9l6,ls2 %. These
figures exhibit an excess of income over expen-
di.ures of S254,652 81. From the 18th of Dec
1858, to the 18th of Dec, 1859, the income was
Sl,l95, ,44o 13 the expenditures for the same
period being SLIGO, ,929 I4-leaving an excess
Of receipts over expenditures of S34,5ll SO.


This is the exhibit as made by Gov. Weller
We must confess that it is not such an exhibit as
the country had right to hope for. His fig
ur-s, we are assured, do not embrace the month
ly expenses of the State Prison, nor the annual
interest of S296, 000 These two items added to
his figures, and it will be perceived that, under
a cash system, the expenditures for the year
have greatly exceeded the income. During the
year 1856, the first of Gov. Johnsons term the
expenditures amounted to 81 ,O3o,9l2 10. But
government expenses were then in part paid in
scrip worth from sixty to eighty cents on the
dollar During the year ending the 3lst of Dec,
1887 the expenditures were S699, ,s03 94-being
S452, ,430 Is less than the receipts for the same
period. Thus perceive that during the last
year of Gov. Johnson's administration, the ex-
penditures were 5000, ,se3 81, while during the
last year of Gov. Weller's administration, the
expenditures have been over half million more
That is to say the expenditures of Weler's last
year in office were just about double those Of
Johnson's last year. This is certainly an ex-
hbit not at all creditabie to the party or the
administration of Gov. Weller, and the Democ-
racy of the present Legislature will be deserving
of severe reprobation if the current and ordinary
expenses of the government are not greatly re-
duced during the present year.


A revise of the Revenue Law is favored as
we'll as a reduction of the cost of collecting the
revenue


A geological survey of the State is deemed
wise.


The marriage tie is believed to be too easily
loosed.


lie still believes that a law regulating primary
elections should be passed. He is very careful,
however, not to give any intimation as to how
such law could be framed that would not de-
teat the whole object or PRIMARY elections. The
fact is, Gov. Weller knows that this recommend
alton is an impossible thing. He knows no such
law as he recommends can be framed. If 9TH
erwise, why did he not suggest the main pro,i-
sions of bill which would accomplish his OBJ
ject, and at the same time exclude Republicans
from the right to vote in Democratic primary
elections2 Why? Because he could not.


Laws to protect religious meetings and COM
pell Boards of Supervisors to put up gnide-
boards at points where roads cross or diyerge,
are demanded.


Recommends Lewiston of the 5tate into Con-
Rressoaal Districts.


Thinks law to prevent the adulteration of
wines and brandies should be passed.


Advocates repeal of the law creating the
Office of State Registrar.


Recommends that the Convention question be
again submitted to a vote of the people.


Faycrs the building of a State Capitol.


Thinks the gaming law should be modified.
Its great severity defeats its execution.


The origin of the Pit River India difficulties
is given. Some 200 Indians were killed and
$50 removed to Mendocino Reservation.


Total number of children under Is years OF
age, 1876, being an increase of IL, ,ssS over
the number Of the previous year.


""The amount of swamp and overfowed land,
surveyed and approved by the Surveyor Cen
eral from the passage Of the Act of 1855, until
the 18th of December last, is FIVE hundred and
sixty acres; the aggregate proceeds from this
source is Sl35, ,232 6l.


While the State had possession OF the State
Prison-thirteen months and one half-but 81
conyicts escaped while the number reported TO
have escaped during the three months subse-
quent to the passing of the Prison into McCau-
ley's hands, is sixty -ninel He denounces, the
present system as Infamous, and warmly urges
the establishment Of Branch Prison at Folsom
or some other place.


The criminal laws have been executed during
the year. Judge Lynch has nevertheless occa-
sionally compelled an execution of his man
dates


The great number of homisides is attributed
to the practice of carrying deadly weapons. But
as, under the constitution, all persons may bear
arms, be thinks it useless to encumbsr the
statute books with dead-letter laws against the
practice. We think the Governor is little
lame on the constitutional argument, tut his
conclusions are correct. Carrying concealed
weapons, and carrying them publicly, is, we"

A dispatch of Sept. 20th, from Newark, N.
j., says: A heavy rain storm at eight O'Clock
this morning flooded the city, filled cellars
and easements, and drove the people from
their breakfast tables. 1t destroyed furni-
ture, property and eatables to the amount of
5000 at least. Engines are now pumping
the water out. Several places were struck
by lightning. No one was killed.


The announcement is made that Mclean,
our Minister to Mexico, will leave this city
to-day for Washington, preparatory to taking
his departure once more for the scene Of his
diplomatic labors 1t is understood that he
goes prepared to carry out the new policy of
Intervention for pacidcaticn to which our
Government has recently agreed.

in and around the Cooper Institute, New
Y ork, a night or two since. Addresses were
delivered there 10y Joshua j. Henry, wEo
presided; Mayor Wood, Gov. Morehead. OF
Ky, John Cochran, Eli T. Norton and others.
A series of resolutions, providing for a union
upon an electoral ticket, to be selected by
the President. The meeting adjourned to
join in a torchlight procession for the most
part composed OF Bell and Everett men from
Brooklyn, Jersey City and other neighboring
cities, which perambulated the principal
streets of the city till very late hour. The
display was very fine one, and a very large
one.


Gordon, the murderer, whose escape from
Denver in the Pixies Peak region, and his
subsequent recapture have already been
noticed, had an examination on Monday last
at Leavenworth, which resulted in his dis
charge for want of jurisdiction. An attempt
was Immediately made to lynch him, but he
was saved by lodging him in Jail A party
of his friends subsequently undertook to re-
move him from the place, but they were sur

the authorities again saved him, and he was

Disunion is still rampant, but does not speak
with its former emphasis. Secession is GER

secede at present, and in any event, he don't

Mr.. EDIToR:-Our city has population
of about 5000, of which number four hun
dred or more are of that race who are fit
only for slaves, according to the sentiments
of OConor, that noted lawyer, or liar, as it
is sometimes rendered But, despite the
social, political, and intellectual obstacles
that oppose them, they are exerting them
selves with what means they have land
with good degree of success, too to rise
above that which would crush them, and to
urge their way onward and upward until
they attain to that eminence where they
will be able to demand and obtain that
which is their right as rational and intelli-
gent beings.


There are two colorcd churches in this
city, one of the Methodist, and the other
of the Congregational order. The ministe-
rial Office of the first is filled by Deacon
George A. Rue, who is man of very fair
natural abilities, and his labors have been
productive of much good to the church,
both in a spiritual and temporal way. The
house in which he dispenses the Word OF
Life is a frame building, erected and conse-
Grated for the religious services of the A.
NJ. E. Church in this place. 1t will ac-
commodate about four hundred people, and
is usually full once on the sabbath Siren
uous and successful efforts are now being
made for the liquidation of the remaining
church debt, which has been standing for
some time. One of the recent efforts for
this object was the getting up of an exhibi-
ton, which consisted of declamatory and
musical exercises, by upwards of twenty
FIVE young persons from FIVE to fifteen
years of age The exercises were admira-
bly, conducted, under the direction of Mr..
Mccullough, the principal Instructor of the
participants. The aptitude and acquire
ments displayed were highly commenda-
able, both to pupils and teacher. A large
number of persons, white and colored, Of
both sexes, attended the exhibition, and
gave frequent signs Of being very agreea-
bly, entertained The children, for the
most part, were dressed with good taste,
and presented fine appearance. Indeed,
the exhibition, on the whole, was unusual
ly interesting-so much so that many ex-
pressed desire to witness it de aeooO.


The Congregational Church in this
place is under the pastoral charge of Rev.
Benjamin Lynch, who, as speaker, has
an earnest and peculiar style of delivery,
which seems to arrest and hold the atten-
ton of his hearers; and though his labors
do not seem TO be crowned with as much
success as is desirable, yet he is sowing
good seed, which, if it do not fall by the
wayside, will in due time spring up and
bear fruit to the honor and glory of God.


Next to our churches, the most import
ant institution we have among us is a lit
erary society called the Banneker Lyceum.
This society has been in existence but a
short time. 1t was originated and is con-
Quoted by very intelligent and efficient
club of young ladies, who deserve much
praise and credit, not only for embarking
in so laudable an undertaking, but also tor
the very able manner in which the affairs
of the society are managed. Of late there"

The river is now in fine boating order A rise
Of eight feet is reported at Shreveport, with a
prospect of a further rise from above; while at
Alexandria the rise is twelve feet. The weather
has been intensely cold. Heavy frosts visit as
nearly every morning.


From the Caddo Gazette OF the sth we extract
the following:


Since orr last the river has continued to riae
and is now in fine boating order. Large packets
arrive At onr wharf DALI. and give to our levee
quite an animated appearance. Two magnificent
packets, the Gen. Hodges and De Soto, have come
into our trade, affordng extensive accommodations
to shippers and the travelling public. Permanent
navigation IS now established, and both up aHd
down freights are maeh reduced.
The receipts of cotton at this place have been
greater during the past week than they have been
during any ONE week of the present season.
Wagons daily crowd our streets, and although
money matters are still very tight, yet our busi-
ness is gradually beginning to assume its old ap-
pearance.


we would advise planters to send in their cotton
without delay. The roads are now in good order,
freights moderate, and our facilities to meet all
their wants unsurpassed. 0nr merchants are sell.
ing off their stocks at reduced prices in fact
Shreveport is still the best place to come and
trade at.


We have had curing the past week rather
severe spell of weather-it having been clear
cold and frosty. 1t has remained dry overhead,
however, giving our planters tolerably fair op-
portunity to get out tie remainder of their cotton
week more Of such weather would help rs very
materially.

On Saturday night last the Cora Anderson

BROWNSVILLE, August, 9, 1850.


M. Edaoi.-At the State and county election
which took place in this county last Monday, the
9Th the following officers were elected Stephen
Powers, for Chief Justice; W. W Nelson, for Dis
trict Clerk: j. Bartelon, for Sheriff II. II. Klaha
for County Clerk; Lewis Cowan, for Collector and
Assessor; n. J. Alexander, for Treasurer and
Julius Eerbaum, for Coroner. Alexander Wer-
brilli. Eben Cob, Ilkin Moses and Moses Barclay
were elected County Commissioners. Most of the
successful candidates elected by large ma jori
ties for this county being thoroughly Democratic,
the candidate who receives the support of the
leaders of that party is sure to be successful.


In regard TO State officers, the nominees Of the
Democratic State Convention were returned with
out opposition. The Houston ticket, with McAdoo
and Smythe upon it, did not get more than twenty
out of the five hundred votes that were cast, and
many Of those were given by gentlemen who ex-
pressed desire to help it to something of vote
rather than to an election. The election passed
off with the utmost order and decency, and / have
heard complaint so far against the result as
having been unfairly obtained.


A great ratification meeting in favor of Breckin-





with it the same people who voted the Democratic
ticket last Monday. There is no other sentiment
i in this community to-day but earnest desire to
see Brechinrdge elected and if not him, then Bell,
for Douglas and Lincoln have no friends that
know of in this section. The Rio GTande has been
accused of abolitionsm so long that half the
Northern politicians are Of opinion that we are
their allies against slavery; but shall undeceive
them in the next election, as this people are
thoroughly Southern and constitutional We in
tend to live up to the contract which we have
made with the North, and we intend to do nothing
more for the system we have heretofore pursued
Of compromising away our rights to quiet the
bullyism Of ngger equality tauatiesm is not the
true plan to be pursued. If we have rights, let US
maintain them; if we have none, let us abolish
the Supreme Court which says we have. This
understand to be the platform on which Mr..
Breckenridge stands, and ! believe Mr.. Bell occu-
pies the same honorable and lofty position.
We have recently had an increase of two new
steamboats, on the Rio Grande river and there is
prospect Of more yet. The elegant little steamer
Mexico which ran between Corpus Christi and In
danola, has been put on the Rio Grande and is in
1 tended to run between Brazos Santiago and
| Laredo, whenever the water will permit. The
steamboat company which has heretofore done all
the freighting on the Rio Grande has also bought
and placed in the trade and beautiful little
| boat the Mustang, intended to ply between
! Brownsville and Laredo. These Improvements, it
| is to be hoped, will increase the trade of this
| place by lowering the present extrayagant rates
of freight in this quarter. The Mexico is oppo-





Her occupation will be to reduce the rates; but
have always noticed that some compromise was
| come to soon where the opposition was limited
and l suppose the Mexico will soon find her profit
| in some arrangement with the other boat. No
| body can blame her either, for all men pursue
| their own interests and | do not see why steam
| boatmen should be denied the privilege. | simply
complain that the people do not help themselves
in such cases instead Of doing as they do that is,
assisting the opposition to run itself out. 1t is to
the interest of this people to lower the rates of
freight and fare, and if they would pay reasonable
terms to an opposition boat, Notwithstanding ruin
ously low rates could be had, the result would be
that opposition could maintain itself: but instead
| of doing so, no sooner does competition come
along than they encourage both parties to reduce
| prices and if the old monoposts carry for rac-
ton less than the opposition, away they go with
their patronage to the one who does the work for
the least pay. The result is that the opposition
boat, instead of decent patronage, finds itself
duced to the necessity of begging for freight at
runous rates, of being called eXtortionists and

charging high per centage on their risk, labor

am informed that great many settlers ar,
now moving into the county and taking up resi-
dences in our midst. The great fertility Of this
valley, and its superior advantages for stock-rais
irg, make it one Of the most desirable location
for settlers wishing homes that can be found in tn
western country.

Taken from The Jail and Hung.-0n Tuesday
morning last our usually quiet community was
thrown into intense excitement by the discovery
that the jail had been broken open, and prisoner
Columbus Nutterfield-was missing. Immediate
search was made by our citizens, and he was found
suspended to tree little east of the town, dead.
Justice Oliver Immediately summoned Coroner's
Jury, who took down and examined the body and
returned the following verdict:


""It is the opinion of the jury, from the evidence
received, that the deceased came to his death by
violence, and that by hanging, by persons unknown
to the jury


The following paper was found upon the body,
placed inside his waistband - evidently written
in disguised hand--and which we present ue5'-
batim:

Horse thieves


We the Vigilence Committy Of Shelby Co 1lls
do here by declare to avoid troblin our Courts
- MANY GITIzENs.n


Mr. Nutterfeld, it seems, was under arrest for
stealing horses from VIM Mddlesworth of this
county, and had been confined in our jail awaiting
trial since November last. By his evidence before
a vigilance committee, soon after, obtained by
threats of violence and hanging, he implicated +.
W. Bacon, Of Princeton, ILL.,, who was also arrest
ed; and upon his (A.'s} evidence at the trial of
Bacon, in Macon county, in July last, he cleared
Baeon-clearly showing that he swore falsely be-
fore the committee. Nutterfield had in ALL stolen
four horses from Mr. Middlesworth, and in attempt
ing to steal two more he was shot at and wounded
but managed to escape and was at large until his
arrest last fall, as stated above. In his confession
before the aforesaid committee, he gave nforma-
ton where the horses could be found, and we be-
lieve three of them were recovered


By whom he was lynched, of course, is unknown
except to the perpetrators and we are authorized
to state that citizens in and around Shelbyville
regard the act as an atrocity against our coInmn-
nifty and against humanity-that they believe Nut
entitled to fra by our courts and beays W. ths
law would have convicted him of his crime.


The deceased we understand, belonged in BID
reau connty-whether this be SO, or whether Nut
tertield was his real name, or not we cannot say.
He was about Is years of age.

The last instance of the ""irrepressible
conflict"" which we shall relate occurred in
marble palace in Broadway-no less a
place than S--t's immense dry-goods
establishment. The Herald"" announced
the other day that the principal of that es-
tablishment had recently been obliged to
diccharge fifty clerks in consequence of the
great falling off in his Southern trade. The
Tribune"" suggested that these clerks were
probably in the city retail department,
which had fallen off in consequence of the
active part which MIR. St had taken
in the recent Union meetil 3. The ""Post""
announced that so far from the Southern
trade falling off in that house it had been
obliged to add some forty clerks doubtless
all sound on the goose) to the Southern
department, in consequence Of increased
orders from that section. Here is just such
dust and contradiction as would spring
up from an 'irrepressible conflict"" We,
being, anxious to get at the exact truth on
the subject, sent our reporter, who brought
back the following statement, which may
be relied on:


Mr.. St, the principal of the house,
is, like Charles O'Conor, John Mitchell,
and Thomas f. Meagher, a Celt-and read
headed at that. Their real affinity with
the shareholders lies not in their greed for
gold, but in the servile blood which courses
through their veins Unlike the nobler
men of their race, the Burkes, OConnells,
and Currans, they cannot rise to the atmos-
phere of universal emancipation. So Mr..
S-t's establishment has been for
years plantationon Broadway. He car
ries his drivers whip on the end of his
tongue, singing with his coarse vitupera-
ton as deeply into the souls, as the negro
driver would into the bodies of his SER
wants. In the upholsterlng department
was worthy, upright, and excellent clerk
who had hold his situation some six years
He had borne Mr.. st as he might un-
til a week or two ago, when, probably, he
had been reading the Gospel according to
John Brown; and when, in one of his
driver moods, Mr.. St lighted OF
him with language SO abusive and insult
ing that the clerk, in a moment of frenzy
clenched bis fist, drew it suddenly away
from the side of Mr.. S---t's head, and
the merchant millionaire lay sprawling OIL
his own marble floor. The forty odd clerks
of the department who witnessed this scene
did not seize hold of their audacious broth
er and lynch him. Far from it-somt
even went the length of an ""irrepressible
sn;cker"" Next payday they were all dis
missed Their treason"" was promptly
punished.


Fearing that Mr.. S--t's modesty
will prevent him from publishing this glo
rious Union meeting in the South, we hope
it will ""go the rounds"" that his distinguish
ed merits may be duly appreciated and re
warded Who knows but that he may yet
have the honor of monument at Harpers
Ferry, with an inscription written by Gov
Wise. Virginia, the dear old nanny, the
nursing mother, who recently welcomed tc
her withered paps the darling babies who
screamed SO at their ""teething"" in Pbiladel
phia, can surely afford to adopt Mr.. A. L
st as worthy son."

An Irishman, named Dunn, who lives next
door to Capt Delays big cannon having dis
covered, on Thursday last that he was minus
sum of money, amounting to seventy odd dollars,
and suspccting that his little daughter about ten
years old, had appropriated it, proceeded to in
ilict upon the poor creature most cruel beating,
to compel disclosure of the place where, 1t was
assumed, she had concealed the money. His
wife, who interiercd in behalf of the child, had
an eye beautifully"" blackcned for her pains.
The screams of the little victim, who was even
dangerously hurt attracted the observation of
citizens, who terminated the shocking scene by
taking the tender father before magistrate, by
whom he was sent to jail for six hours. When,
that night he was released il is said that he was

excitement to tear TO pieces the argument of
Ashley, which melts away as his touch like frost
before the sunbeam. Every one looked surprised.
His logic was at once brief, and so lumnously
clear that the rudest peasant could comprehend


il without an effort,


Anon he came to the dazzling wit of .he poet
lawyer, Pike. Then the curl of his lips grew
sharper, his smooth face began to kindle mp, and
his eyes to open--dim and dreury no longer but
vivid as lightning, red as fire globes as glaring
i rs twin mctcors. The whole soul was in his eye,
and the fall heart stream""d ont Of his face. In
five minutes Pixies wit seemed like foam of folly,
and his finest satire horrible profanity when com,
pared with the inimiable salies and eXtermina
ting sarcasm Of the stranger, intersporsed with
jests and anecdotes that filed the iorum with
laughter


Then without as much as bcstowing an alu4ion
upon rrcntiss h turned round short at the per.
iGred witnesses of Hopkins, tore their testimony
into atoms and hurled into their faces such in
Vcctives that all tremhcd as with ague, and two
of them actually fed in dsmay from the court
house.


The excitement of the crowd was becoming
tremendous, Their united life aud soul seemed
to hang upon the burning tongue of the stranger
He inspired them with the power Of his own pas
sions. He saturated them with the poison of his
own malicious feelings. lie seemed to have sto
len natures long hidden secret of attraction
He was the sun to the sea of all thought and
emotion, which rose and tell, and toilcd in the
billows as he chose. But his greatest triumph
was to como.


Ills eyes began to glance furtively Mt the as
sassin Hopkins, as his lean taper fingers assumed
the same direction. lie hcmncd the wretch with
II decentralization of strong evidence ani imprcg
nabc argument, cutting oil all hope Of escape.


He piled up large bastons of insurmountable
facts. He dug beneath the murderer and Sian
derer's feet bitches of dilemmas, snoh as no
sophistry could overlap, and no secrets OF nge
nuity cvadc: and thus having, rs one might say
impoundcd his victim, aud girt him about like II
scorpion in circle Of fire, he stripped himself TO
the work Of massacre.


On then it was vision both glorious and
dreadful to behold the orator. His actions, be-
fore graceful the waves of golden willow in
the lrcrzp, grew impctuous as the motion of an
oak in hurricane


His voice heoame a trumpet filled with wild
whirpools, dcafcning the ear VITA the crashes of
power, and vet intermingled all the while with
sweet undprsong Of the sortest cadence. Ills fac
was as red rs drunknrd 's-his forehead gloweu
like a heated furnace his counteunnce was hag-
gard like that of mouiac and ever and anon
he flung his long and bony arms ON high, as it
graepinm after thundcrbOlts.


lie drew picture of murder in such appalling
coors, that in comparison he'll itself might be
considered beautiful He painted the slandcrcr
so black that the sun seemed dark at MONDAY,
when shining such an accursed monster, and
then fixing both portraits on the shrinking Hop
kins he fastened them there forever. The agita-
tiOn Of the audience amounted almost TO mad
ness.


All at once the speaker dcsGcndcd from his
perl0us height His voice walled out for the
murdered dead, and liying--the beautiful Mary.
more beautiful every moment as her tears flowed
iastcr--till all wept and sobbed like children.
He closed by n strange eXhOratOn to the jury,
and through them to the bystandcrs. He advised
the panel after they should bring in verdict for
the plaintiff not to offer any violence to the de-
fcndant, however richly he might deserve it, in
other words not to lynch the villain, but leave
his punishment with God.


This was the most artIul trick of all, and the
best calculated To insure vengeance.


The Jury rendered verdict Of twenty thou
sand dollars, and the night afterwards Hopkins
was taken out Of his bed by lyuc'ers, and beaten
almost to death.


As the court adjourned the stranger made
known his name, and called the attention Of the
public with the annoUnccment--Ioh Taylur will
preach this evening at carly candle light


The crowd all turned out, and Taylors sermon
cquaed if it did not surpass the spendor Of his
forensic effort This is not eXaggeratiOn. !
Lu Vn list n nd al Ia
Dewey, Tying and Bascom-but never heard any
thing in the form Of sublime words even remotely
approXimating to the eloqnencc Of John Taylor
massive as mountain--and wildly rushing as
a cataract Of fire, And this is the opinion of all
who have heard this marvellous man.


Crazy FOR a SfxPENcB.--James Truesdell
gentleman Of some seventy years, living in Lib. /
erty, Penn, has been for twelve years past in
dustriously engaged, when the weather would
permit. in digging over small plot of ground
near his dwelling, and carrying dirt and stones
to pile. He has thus labored, taking one stone
or a little dirt at a time, until the mound has
reached height Of thirty Or forty feet, and is
much larger than his house. lie gives as Il rea-
son for hi1 tabor that he is searching FOR six
pence he once lost in bis garden When offered

billiards or anything else, saw chance to make


few dollars for himself out of this excitement SO
he got up what he calls a Billiard Tournament
(curious phrase in that connectionl and offered a
gold-mounted cue to the best player. The playing
commenced last Monday, and will be finished this
evening. On tomorrow, the Ladies' Day. Phe.
Ian plays the winner of the cue. The ""tourna-
mentn has drawn together all the best billiard
men hereabouts. and the playing is declared to be
the best ever seen here. The best runs (carom)
made so far are as follows: Temann, 1856; Lynch,
i62 and 127. Dudley Kayanagh is considered the
best player around the table, while Temann has a
wonderful knack Of nursing the ball. Victory lies
between these two players, and the betting leans
towards the former.


There was little furry among the gamblers in
Wall street and the gamblers up town the other
day. A note broker, rapid youth named Hurry
rushed into the office of Quick Il II L'Hammedieu,
bankers, and asked them if they had note for
$4,000, as he had customer for such an article.
They gave him the note, and he Immediately sold
it and pocketed the proceeds He then went up
town and commenced playing faro and succeeded
in losing, at three wellknown houses, about $3500.
The defrauded bankers sent detective after Mr..
Hurry, and he was found living at an uptown
hotel under an assumed name. He disgorged, and
then complained against the faro bankers with a
view of making them do the same thing. They
seemed quite ready to do so, when police mags-
trate insisted uponh holding them for trial. and max
ing Hurry give security to prosecute. The amount
of bail, however, is very small, only $500. The
gamblers will probably pay that, and leave for
Southern tour until the affair blows over. The law
here against gambling is very severe in its penal
ties, but nobody ever pays any respect to it.


No gentleman of the faro persuasion has ever
been sent to the State Prison, though Mayor Tie
mann tried his best to introduce several of them,
including the late lamented Patrick Hearne, Esq.,,
to that cheerful institution. They all pleaded
guilty. and through their counsel the distinguished
defender of marital rights, the Honorable Daniel
E. sckles, (by the way Mrs D. E. s. has just pre-
sented her lord with pledge of mutual atfacton)
said they wouldn't do SO any if they could be
let off I"" this once"" So the Court told them to
go away and be good boys; of course they imme-
diately ratified their checks as bravely as ever.


The Rev. Dr. Tying, Clergyman Of whom you
may have heard, has got himself into bad scrape
with Ball Black. Tying is slashing preacher,
and when he gets the steam up, don't mind much
what he says. With several others, Tying has got
up a society to convert the heather of this city.


They need it quite as much as the CannibaI Island

proof of friyolity and wickedness that Ball &
Black made enough out Of the ladies who hired
diamonds for the Prince of Wales ball to pay the
rant af their nav uI,ar. ola ,-aa. IN

his assertion had foundation in fact, and asked
for his authority, which he declined to give Up to
this time Tying has not had the pluck to confess his
error and much scandal has been brought upon the
cloth BY his conduct The seofers make merry
over the whole thing, and say that Tying is tile
advertising agent Of Ball & Black.


MIR. Thornton Hunt, son Of Leigh Hunt. and a
very well known member Of the London press,
arrived here recently. Last week Cranston gave

says the Ben Lews, FROM Memphis for St
Louis, exploded an4 burned within sipbt Of
caro- at about o'clock this morning, The
loss Of life has been great, but at this hour
we are unable to give full particulars. The
Ben Lewis left here at about half past twelve
with a good passenger trip. There could not
have been less than two hundred persons on
board in all. The Lewis appeared TO be en-
deavorlng to make quick trip, and is said
to have been very hot when she left here.
The explosion took place few minutes after
one o'clock, just as the boat was MAKING tbe
turn at the junction of the rivers to 90 mn
the Mississippi The shock was very heavy,
much like that of an earthquake' iarring
every house in town. Directly after The ex@
plosion the most heart rendering and agoniz-
ing screams and cries for help could be dis
unctly heard. But they were soon ouieted
and ana not break out again until the boat
commenced burning, which was within fifteen
minutes after the explosion.


Two steamers and several skiffs Immediate
~ started out to the assistance of the passen-
gers. The Bay City, though she had up
steam, and though her captain was specially
lmportuned and begged to go to the scene Of

this morning. The Lake Erie brought about
thirty of the survivors, the Mononqahela
three, and the Sunny Side large crowd

The boat was torn in pieces by the explo-
sion, all forward of the wheelhouse. After
burning to the waters edge, she sunk. From
the best information we can obtain at this
hour, but few were lost, not over six or eight,
though some say that persons were on the
burning boat just before she sunk.


Another dispatch from Cairo of the same
date, says:


A number of lives are known to be lost.
Capt. Manson is among the missing. The
body of Mrs Williams (of ST. Lopis) has been
found and brought up here. Two of Mr..
Williams daughters were saved, but he has
lost two children. Two or three of the
wounded at the st. Charles Hotel will proba

Some of the passengers of the Lewis who
were picked up out of the river, took passage
on the Bay City for st. Louis, and were put
off on the Missouri side by the Captain be
cause they had no money. A crowd of peo-
pie started out this morning to lynch the
Captain of the Bay City, but were persuaded
not to do SO. The indignation felt on account
Of this treatment of the unfortunate victims is

-WE learn from the San Francisco Evening
Mirror that J. G. McKibbin will soon commence
a stumping tour of the State for Douglas and
johnson.


Why SENATOR GREEN SUPPORTS BREcKIN-
RIDGE"" Isupport John G.. Breckenridge because
he has never Travelled up and down the river on
the decks Of steamboat, adv dvocating his own
election to the Presidency ; he has never descen-
ded into beer saloons and drank lager in order
to gain popularity with the vulgar rabbe.""


-PREFERs LINC0LN.-The Providene R ~
Press, Douglas paper, speaking of the friends
of Mr. Breckenridge, says: ""Coaliton with
them therefore must be too repulsive for honest
Douglas men to indorse, even to defeat Linooln,
whose stra ght- -forwardness has the hearty in
dorsement of Douglas himself""


-IT is an unaccustomed sound for Demo
Gratis to hear their party friends abused and Will
fled as Mr.. Douglas is doing, while he has no
word of condemnation for Lincoln. He is doing
faithfully the work of a Black Republican ennis
sary. He ntters no untruth. The defeat of the
Democracy, and the triumph of Lincoln, are OBJ
jects which cause him to stump the country. In
none of his speeches has he uttered a sentiment
against Mr. Lincon-in all he has shamefully
and falsely assaled the man whose support he
but recently sought-RichmOnd (Va.) Inquirer.


THE statement that Mr.. Dallas, our Minis
for IN I'm 0Jand bad announcad bimsolf In e, Won
of Douglas, is said to be false. Very necessary,
we suppose, that Mr. Dallas, in England should
declare in favor of somebody, and yet hardly
advisable that he should say Douglas. A press
ing invitation to visit the American continent
might follow.


---SToP THE FALsEH0oD.-TI latest and big
gest and most mpudent fasehood originated aud
circulated by the frightened Douglasites is, that
Chief Justice Taney is in favor of their IDOL and
approves of his construction of the Dred Scott
decision The idea is preposterous. Judge Ia
ney is profound jurist, consistent Democrat,
and an ardent supporter of Breckinrdge and
LanesL.Mountdn Democrat.


On that point there seems to be a standing
dispute. The Douglas journals in this State long
ago came to the conclusion that Taney was with
them, notwithstanding which the Breckenridge
papers pronounce it unblushng falsehood We
are anxious to know to which idol fancy posi-
lively adheres.


SENATOR GwIN says, that if the election of
President does not go into the House, Lincoln
will be elected but if it go to the House,
Breckinrdge will have it.


-THE N Y. Herald has correspondent who
comedies the eight electoral votes of MARYLAND

the White House easy chair, and still another
who honestly believes that the Bell Everetts will

Mr.. Cox, who was so seriously injured by fall at
the Norveii House, Thursday night. Hedied ahout

his falling down the steps, striking his head severe
blow, by which the sknli was fractured. He was
employed as assistant at the Noryeil House, and
had been to escort guest to his room when the
accident occurred.


A man whose name we are informed WAS Martin,
was found dead at Sandyhook, Saturday morning,
having died the night before. It supposed that
he came to his death by freezing. An inquest was
held by Justice Knight. The deceased resided, we
learn, near the Appomattog line.

contemporary of the San Juan Press, Wm.
Bausman, Esq, took a decided stand the 9TH
er day, at San Juan, against the execution
Of mob law upon a Mexican who had stabbed
(perhaps fatally,) an American named Fisher
The crowd were determined to hang the
Mexican at once, without Judge or jury, when
Mr. Bausman and others, by well timed adj
dresses to the excited multitude, succeeded
in staying their wrath and preventing the
dragging of the prisoner from the hands Of
the law.


We are glad to record such efforts in the
behalf OF law and order. 1t is far more pop-
ular to side with the multitude, and when
man, whose position might well tempt him
to take the part of the mob, for the sake of
the popularity it would bring, throws him
self in the path Of the infuriate seekers or
avengers of blood, and saves from violation
the majesty Of the law, he deserves well Of
his country, and is entitled to the respect Of
all good and true men.


We are proud TO see men of influence tax
ing their stand against lynch violence. There
has been far too much of it in the mountain
towns, and the fame of it has disgracod our
State. 1t is time for it to stop."

whatever we happened to see. Wa have
not the time to systematize our account, and
will therefore give things as they come.


The first object that struck our attention
singular coincidence was large number of
bottles of wine, native to California; also
California made peach brandies. These lat
ter were manufactured by c. Covillaud. He
also had an exhibition Of red and white
wines and sherry. Judging from the looks
of these articles they are of rare quality
Indeed we have several times tested Mr.
Covillaud's wines and we believe them tol
equal any ever manufactured in any country
Mr.. jacobs, of San Francisco, had Los Ange-
les wine and native brandies. a. 7. Smith,
of Sacramento. had red and white wines
Antoine Christian, cf Yuba county, exhibit
ed wild grape wine. Mrs W. P. Thompson,
of this city, also has on exhibition red and
white wine, one and two years old. 1t looks
remarkably well. Jacob Geiss, of Marysville,
has ale and porter of his own make. We
can tell whether it is good or not when we
come to test it, which we expect to have the
privilege of doing shortly.


The next thing we noticed was some packs
of French merno wool, sent in 10y NJ. Mar
euse, one fleece of which weighed 81 lbs.


Next we came to fifty bottles of garden
seeds, of every variety. We did not learn
who put them in.


| Il ha of
fectioncry. A very noticeable feature of this
was the Temple of Liberty, made out of can
dy, and three feet and half high 1t is
quite an imposing looking miniature struc-
ture. 1t is the work Of Snyder Zimmerman
Il Co., of this city. A Christening cake and
Swiss cottage in the rocks were gotten up by
Mons. Peri and the work is fine, skillful and
tasteful a champion wedding cake, by
Peri, weighing As pounds, is also a noticeable
thing. Mr.. Qualey's exhibit Of confection-
cry, &c, is good


We noticed some very beautiful light
bread-two loayes of equal merit Which
one of them is entitled to the premium it
would be hard say. They were made by
compile of handsome young matrons in this
city.


The point in the Pavilion occupied by the
Italian bees of S Kennedy IL Co., of this
e city, is one Of considerable attraction The
e working Of these bees can be distinctly seen
in their glass hives. The Italian bees are
e mingled with the Others but may readily be
distinguished by the gold band just back OF
their wings 1t is sal that these bees will
e make two pounds of honey to one of the
common. They have longer proboscis and
r can reach honey in flowers not accessible to
ordinary bees


, Mr. Tucker, of San Francisco, has on exhi-
bition a splendid lot of silver plate and ware


DR.. w. p. Thompsons cabinet in the
southern end of the building, is a decided
5 attraction, and contains a large variety of
curosities and valuables. Among these is q
granite mortar, of small size, which was
t found forty feet below the surface, at Lynch.
] burg, Butte county, q few months ago. He
has black variegOted marble, of fine quail.
ty, from near Downieville also variegated
marble from Suisun, which resembles res
: inous pine; petrfed live and white oak
from kennebeck Hill, near San Juan also
= fossil wood of manzanita from the same place,
so feet under the ground a portion of the
petri6ed tree, near Pyramid Lake, which
measures 6G6 feet in length, as stated by Ste.
vens Totman and others; micaceous oxide of
iron from the Iuba black oxide of iron,
slightly magnetic; carburet of iron from
Sierra; ignite-out-eroppng of coal-an
excellent material for jet jewelry; pure as
bestus from Amador-vareties of the same
from Yuba, Sierra and Nevada; tripoli from
La Porte gold-bearing conglomerates from
all the Northern Districts cinnabar from the
New Almaden mines; felspar from the
Guba river; petrifed cedar and bark from
Timbuctoo; obsidian from Shasta county :;
agates from Humboldt county numerous
specimens from Washoe; sulphuret of lead
from Oregon Guch and Browns Valley
soda from Soda Springs in Washoe; copper
from Whislley Dggings in Sierra county ;
specimens from the Coral Cave of Ell Dorado ;
petrifed teeth from Black Rock, in the Utah
country, of size larger than those of the
modern OK, and variety of things too nu
merous to mention.


Wm Abbot, of ""A d street, Marysville, has
a very attractive display of Kerosene lamps
&c, and new kind of stove called the
Erovapor, which supersedes the necessity of
coal and wood. 1t is a treat to see how
eharmingly the patent works


The leather from the Pioneer Tannery of
Valentine Kreese & Co., Marysyille, Is a
credit to the State. We notice a superior
specimen of harness leather from tho tannery
of G. A. Hoelcher IL Co., Feather river. 1t
is the finest heavy harness leather we have
yet SEEN


G. Armstrong has fine display of boots
and shoes


We saw some beautiful blankets from the
San Francisco wooden factory. One of them
is Mackinaw 81 by 6S inches, and weigh
ing 81 pounds.

 ""James, the novelist, has abandoned the Consulate at Venice, and is coming back to Richmond, Virginia He went there to gather materials for novel of Venetian history, but finding that the streets were all canals, and that he could not introduce that solitary horseman of his, abandoned the place in disgust

 The Mobile Advertiser relates the fol- lowing singular facts:

 ""DEArH OF ANOTHER CATHOLIC BISHOP. The last year has been peculiarly fatal to Bishops of the Catholic Church in this country. The death of Bishop Portier, of Mobile, of Bishop Lynch, of Savannah, and of the Bishop of Philadelphia, has been announced, and to-day we have to add to the number the name of Bishop Miles, of Tennessee, who died, as we learn by telegraph, yesterday at Nashville. At the time of his death he was seventy years of age, and had performed the duty of Bishop twenty-five years""

 The Upshur (Texas) Democrat says:

 ""In North Carolina the opposition to the democracy are organizing under the name of whiggery. In some of the States they are organizing under the name of the opposition. In our own State, the oppo- sition style themselves national democrats. '

part of the new railroad bridge was injured, some
of the rafters of the Presbyterian church were
blown off, and the Catholic Church of this place
was injured badly. The damage upon the Pres

sented an unusually busy appearance to-day, for
the members and other persons interested In
their deliberations have been arriving to be
present at the opening of the Legislators to-
night That body is now in session. I,s delib
erations will be principally confined to the
ordinary business of the State, and no direct
action can be taken regarding the secession
movement, for the Legislature has already gone
to the extent of its jurisdiction in having issued
the call for Convention.


The Legislature, however, has just read, for
the first time, bill to arm the State, and 10
raise 100000 for that purpose.


Out Of the one hundred and sixty.seven mem.
bers, there is not q single man who is known to
be co.operationist; every one is in favor of
unconditional secession. ~ '.LEgTu.


The State is making active preparations to
resist any demonstration on the part of the Fed
eral Government. Tenders Of aid from other
States continue TO come to the Governor, and
so strong and so universal is the feeling, that
the moment the command shall have been given,
seventy thousand soldiers within her own bound.
aries, from the mountains to the sea, will come
forward to the defence of South Carolina, and
they all would sooner die, or see the State q
subjugated province, than passively submit to
Q continuance Of Northern encroachments on
her rights. .....i i..r. ....


The Governor will send in his message at one
o'clock tomorrow. He will recommend That
the Legislature should, to some extent, foster
and encourage direct trade with Europe and
the continent, by taking upon itself part Of
the losses that might flow from the establish
ment Of such direct trade. To this end, the
proposition of some citizens Of Charleston to
| establish line of steamers between that port
and Liverpool is favorably thought Of
In the event of traitors arising within the
State after she shall have asserted her sover.
eighty, it is probable that he will advise some
| legislation in more particularly defining trea-
son to the State, and settling the punishment
for that offence. 1t is believed that he will
recommend that law be passed Furnishing
summarily and severely-perhaps with death
any person who circulates incendiary docu.
ments, avows himself an aboltionist, or in any
way endeavors to incite the slaves to insubor
dination or insurrection and that South Carroll
ma shall bind herself to take fifty thousand
dollars worth Of arms annually for five years,
from Major Ripley in accordance with the
proposition of that gentleman; and that a
negotiation be entered into between South
Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama, to fix upon
a site for the armory.


MESSAGE OF GOV. GIsT, OF SOUTH CAR
LIMA.


Columbia, Nop. Ex-Governor Gist, in his
message to the Legislature devotes many
pages to the consideration Of local State affairs.
He says, in view of secession, it becomes doubly
important to have direct trade with Europe,
and advises the State to foster enterprises for
such purposes, by giving guarantees Of five per
cent. upon Investments. Referring to postal
matters, he says he is authorized by the post
master of Charleston to say that, so soon as the
State secedes, he will sever his connection with
the Federal Government, and obey the call Of
the State, and make his offer of services. This,
together with the resignation of the postmas-
ters generally, will enable the State to be un.
embarrassed in establishing for herself postal
arrangements.


He suggests, as q temporary expedient, the
use of Adamss Express. He also further sug.
gests, as probable, that arrangements can be
made between South Carolina and the Federal
authorities for given time, until other States
secede, and Southern Confederacy shall have
been formed


If the Federal Government insists in consd
ering South Carolina in the Union after the
ordinance of secession shall have been adopt
ed, the present postal arrangements must
cease, and another, under State authority, be
substituted.


The Governor next advises the prohibition
of the introduction of slaves from those States
not members of the Southern Confederacy, and
particularly the border States. He says, lei
them keep their slave property in their OWL
borders; and that the only alternative left them
will be emancipation by their own act or the
action of their confederates. The Governor
hopes, however, that all the slave States will
unite in Southern Confederacy.


He advises the passage of the most ample
and stringent laws against abolition incendia
ries, to supersede lynching, deter violations and
make the enforcement Of the laws reliable and
severe. D.l.


The Governor refers to the action of South
Carolina in sending Mr.. Memminger to Vir
ginia, and his failure to obtain cooperation in
Southern conference except in Mississipp
and Alabama. He says that all hope of con
certed action among the Southern States is
lost, and there is but one course left to South
Carolina, consistently with her honor, interest
and safety; and that is, to look neither to the
right nor to the left, but 60 straight forward tc
the contamination Of her purposes.


1t is too late now to receive propositions fol
conference, and South Carolina would be want
ing in selfrespect to entertain proposition
looking to the continuance Of the present
Union.


The Governor entertains no reasonable doub
but that Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Flori
da, Texas, and Arkansas would Immediately
follow South Carolina, and that the other South
ern States will eventually complete the galaxy
He says that it is gratifying to know that if q
resort to arms should be necessary, we have 6
tender of volunteers from all the Southern ant
some Of the Northern States to repair prompt,
to the standard Of South Carolina, and share
her fortunes.


He concludes his message thus: ~ canno
permit myself to believe that in the madness o
passion an attempt will be made by the presen
or the next Federal Administration to coerct
South Carolina after her secession by refusing"

4 ST. LouIs, Oct 3.-The Republican publishes q
speech, delivered yesterday by Major jackson,
Governor elect, who recently spoke in the Breck-
inrdge State Convention, and has since been claim
ed by the Breckenridge men as in favor of their
4 candidate. Therefore, committee of Douglas smen
was recently appointed to inquire whether he in
tended to support Douglas or Breckinridge Jack

i by stating that he was never more anxious to be

the election that believed Douglas the nominee OF
| the Democratic party. Sc now believe.
4 Mr.. Jackson spoke Of his efforts to secure har.
| monious action between the Democratic Central
| Committee and the Breckenridge Convention, re-
GREETING his failure, and challenging any Breckin-
ridge man present to say that he (Jackson uttered
| any remark in the Convention indicating that he
had changed, or designed supporting Breckenridge

He then gave hisreasons for supporting Douglas,
say am for Douglas that it is my duty to support

| opinion that Douglas was the regular nominee from

ridge paper, and the statements OF General Clark,
who until the last opposed Douglas in the Conven-
4 tion, and if ! live till November will vote for him
and have never said intended doing anything
1 else.n


CHANGES TO BELL.-We learn from cores
4 pondent of the Savannah Republican that at the
4 conclusion of Col. H r. Jacks0ns speech in La
| Grange, three Breckenridge men changed for Bel
| almost solely ON account of Jackson's unfounded
charges of unsoundness against Bell. The honest
people are disgusted with such recklessness on the
| part of Breckinridge's supporters. We hear that
Senator Toombs converted two hundred from
4 Breckinridge by his speech in Savannah last week
but we believe he drives them from Breckenridge
everywhere he goes. Augusta Chronicle.


The Cameron Sentinel is considerably deluded
4 if he thinks everybody is going for Breckenridge.
| We do not know man who was for Houston at
his withdrawal but who is now for the Union
ticket, while upon the other hand, we know num-
| ber of men who were for Breckenridge four weeks
ago that are now for Bell, and large number who
| do not know how they will vote.

While the Hon. John c. Mason was replying to
Mr.. Breckenridge, last Tuesday, a Mr.. Jas. Young,
hoping to embarrass him put the question to him,
aWho are you for if Douglas goes off the track =
Mason told him that he was ready to answer that
and every other question that he had no conceal
ment from his fellow-ctizens Of his views, and was
bold to announce them, careless Of consequences.
He said, that in such IN unlikely event Douglas
withdrawing, he should be for the next strongest
man to beat Lincoln and, believing that man % be

Douglas was caught in the trap we set for him, the
| tide has turned against him.


Norfolk Argus, Friday, Sept. a.
The Petersburg (Va.) Democrat administers TO
Lamb the following terrible rehuke:


Docs Mr.. Lamb dare to insult the people of Vir-
ginia by ayerring that his query to Judge Douglas
was prompted by no desire to clear up an obscure
subject, no desire to open the eyes Of the South,
no desire to arrive at an intelligent resolve as to
his duty and the duty of the people, no desire to
warn us of impending danger-by nothing but
wish to trick Judge Douglas into an admission
prejudicial to his interests-that his act was
TRAP, and his motive only to injure Douglas
Does Mr.. Lamb consider this fair, honorable, up
right, manfu, straightforward! VIII the people
of Virginia sustain it The question we are sure
is needless. Wherever the facts are known,
wherever this paragraph from the Argus is copied,
and we trust it may be everywhere copied,
wherever these words are read to the people, and
we hope they may be rung from every stump in
the State, the frank Virginia character will rise up
In manly reprobation Of tue act, to which no
sharpness of invectiVe could add drop of bitter.
ness. Let it everywhere be told, the hospitable
welcome with which Douglas was met on first
reaching the soil of Old Virginia, was THE TRAP
OF A BRECKENRIDGE ELEGTOR.


THOSE QUEsTI0Ns.-In reply to the question of
Gen Blow at the discussion on Friday night, Mr.
Lamb said that he had fulfilled his promise and
propounded the questions to Mr.. Breckenridge,
which he had put to Judge Douglas in Norfolk,
but that Mr. Breckenridge had declined answering
them. Norfolk (Va) Herald.


Gen. Mson stated in his speech at Sussex
| Court House astweek that he had the happiness
to inform his auditors that the vast majority of the
Democrats of Norfolk city, Norfolk county and
| Portsmouth, were going to vote for Stephen A..
1 Douglas and Herschel "" Johnson


Everybody who knows Gen. Millson, will con.
cede that he is one of the most conscientious and
| reliable public men in the country, and would

Norfolk District, that he will secure a majority
vote Of his party in the very city where the Lamb

We are indebted to Langton & Co. for the
Territorial Enterprise of July 2lst. From it
we gather the following intelligence;


TAKEN CAPTIVE BY THE INDIANS Through
letter dated July 81, received from Mr.
Rogers, commonly known as ""Uncle Billy
now Agent of the Indian Farm at Ruby
Valley, we learn that the Indians at the time
of the their attack on Dry Creek Station
carried away squaw belonging to the Sho =
shones. This woman having escaped from
her captors returned to Ruby Valley on the
29th of June, reporting that the Pah Utahs
had two white women in their possession
One of these she represents to be rather
large and fleshy, the other more thin and del.
icate. The larger woman had small child
""a boy-wth her. She says they were ta-
ken prisoners near Carson Valley, and one of
them was called Mary Mr.. Rogers supposes
they are now in the vicinity Of Rees' River,
near the Humboldt. The Shoshones in the
neighborhood of Ruby Valley are peaceable
and quiet.


REMOVAL OF TRoors.-On Friday of last
week Capt. Stewart received orders from
Gen. Clark to vacate his post at Pyramid
Lake and retire to the Big Bend of the Car
son. This order Capt Stewart at once pro-
ceeded to execute. The entire command are
now IN their new quarters on the Carson
The removal of troops from the reservation
at Pyramid Lake is probably in anticipation
OF carrying out the policy foreshadowed in
the proclamation of Major Dodge of restor,
ing the Indians to their possessions at that
place.


Everything remains quiet in the country
about Pyrnmd Lake, no Indians having
shown themselves in the vicinity of late.


ARRESTED. Friday, U. S. Special Marshal
Bailey came into Carson City, having in
charge Sam Brown, whom he had arrested at
the upper end of Carson Valley on a charge
of murder, in killing II. L. Bilbo in March
last. There was some talk of lynchng Brown
on his arrival, which led to the Marshals
taking him to a secure place outside the
town.


MIsTAKE.-The rumored finding of the
remains of seven white men between Carson
River and Pyramid Lake, turns out to be
mistake or a hoax.


A FEW days since, at Carson City, F. Gray
was shot during an alteration, by II. B. AL
len, and dangerously if not mortaly wound
ed.


VIRGINIA DlTom.-An immense project is
now on foot for supplying Virginia City with
water, and which, if executed according to
the design of the originators will involve the
expenditure of nearly a million of dollars.
The plan contemplates taking the water of
the West Fork of Carson River at point in
the canon about five miles above Woodford's,
I mile below Hope Valley, and bringing it
along the side of the Sierra, keeping as high
up as possiblee, so that it will be quite on
the top of the mountain when opposite Car
son Carson City, which place it is proposed
to supply as well as Virginia City. Across
the gap between the Silver Range and the
Sierra leading into Washoe Valley the water
is TO be taken in a number of iron tubes,
sufficiently strong to bear the immense pres
sure incident to column of water several
hundred feet high. Once over this depres-
sion. there will be no difficulty in carrying
ditch into Virginia. This company has
been organized under the laws of California
and having fully secured their privileges, and
completed their arrangements, will commence
the preliminary survey, in two or three
weeks."

from Lynchburgh, in the Richmond Dispatch
says:


A gentleman who resides near Boynton.
Mechlenburg county, Virginia, has aspired
to a new science-that of controlling the
clouds in order to cause it to rain at will.
With the view of attaining this end he has
built Il rain tower"" which novel structure
is said to be about thirty feet in diameter at
the base, which size it retains to the hight
of lorty feet To this hight it contains four
tlues, each seven feet in diameter. The mum.
Der of flues is then reduced to two, which
run up twenty feet higher, the top of the
structure reaching an altitude of sixty feet.
The whole concern was erected at a cost of
about 81 900. The moduS opcrdndi of caus-
ing rain TO fall as follows: The fiues are filled
with dry pine wood, which is set on fire,
and which is kept up until the disired effect
is produced on the elements. His theory is,
that the great heat produced in the air above
the tower, will cause the clouds to concen-
trate over it, when plenty of rain will tall
in that vicinity. The originator of the novel
idea is said to be a firm believer in the prac-
ticAbility and utility of his invention. not
withstandng the fact that after repeated
trials, during which he consumed hundreds
Of cords of wood, his tower failed to produce
the desired effect on the unpropitious ele-
ments he having been q great sufferer from

THE FIRE EATERs.-A few weeks ago ex-


Speaker Orr, of South Carolina, addressed a


letter to the Hon. Amos Kendall of Wash


ington, asking him for an exposition of his


opinion upon the question of Southern seces,


sion in the case cf the Inauguration of Re-


publican President Mr., Kendall replies in


a manner that must be anything but salts.


factory to the Southern Hotspur. The ex-


Postmaster General not only expresses his


dissent in toto from the secession doctrine that


the Inauguration of Mr.. Lincoln would be
Just cause for secession, but he goes further
and tells his friendly querist that any attempt
to break up the Union upon such frivolous
grounds would be put down 10y force. In
this connection he refers to the time of PRESS
dent jackson. when one hundred and tiftv
volunteers rendered their services
to Government to aid it if necessary, in put.
ting down the secession movement of that
day, and tells the eX-Speaker that should
like occasion occur, two hundred thousand
volunteers would spring to the aid of the
President, no matter by what party he may
be elected


Mr.. Kendall then enters into an exposition
OF the disastrous consequences that would re
suit from an attempt at secession, and show
ing that it would involve the utter ruin of
the South. The Union, he says ""s too pre-
cious to the people it protects, to be broken
up even should Black Republican Presi-
dent be elected next November, aud should
the attempt be made, a united North and
three'fourths of a divided South would spring
to the rescue""


MIR. Kendall repudiates the Southern doc
trine that Congress can legislate for the pro-
lection of slavery in the Ter ritories as fraught
with inevitable peril to the institutions OF |
the South, for should the principles of legis-
lative interference become the rule of prac-
tice in our Government it would he found in |
the hands of a Republican administration to
involve the power to destroy as well as to
protect. The letter closes with an earnest |
call upon the patriotic men of both sections |
Ct the country to unite for the triple purpose |
of preventing any attempts to dissolve the |
Union in the event of Mr.. Lincolns election. |
Of checking the Republican party while in |
the ascendant and expelling it from power at
the next election.


Sucfare a few Of the prominent points of
this very remarkable letter, from very re-
marka6le man. Its sentiments could not do |
than excite the passions of the un-
reasonable men whom it was intended to in
struct and warn, and therefore it is not sur
prising to hear, as we do from Washington.
that the tire-eaters feel great Indignation
toward Mr.. Kendall and denounce him as an
Abolitionist. We do not hear, however. that
they propose to lynch the venerable Jack
sonian for the unPalatable truths he has told
them"

BROWNSVILLE, Angus",,"BROWNSVILLE, August Is, 1860


NI. Ed30r-The great Democratic mas meeting
came off with flying colors and the Rio Grande may
now be considered g all right OBJ the goose"" On
Friday, the llth inst, Market Hall was thronged
with the people, and so strong was the tide that
the ladies' even came out IN numbers. Judge
Scarborough was called to the chair, and flanked
with Vice-Presidents, Secretaries and committees,
the meeting considered itself organized and pro.
eeeded to business. The speeches were good and
the applause fresh and exciting, for one half Of the
Democracy had turned out to make the other half
show its hand.


The Committee on Resolutions came in and re-
ported, finally the following series of '' settlers""
The preamble set forth that the present election
was equal to crisis that il involved the integrity
of the Union; and that the nation could only be
preserved on the principles Of States Rights and
strict construction. Resolution first approved in
the broadest terms of the secession of the Texas
delegates from the packed Convention at Charles
ton and at Baltimore. Resolution second declared
the nomination Of Breckinrdge and Lane TO be as
good as any that could have been made. Resolu-
ton third declared that the election OF Lincoln and
Hamlin would mean nothing less than :"" immediate
subsection, degradation and slavery to fifteen
States of this Union I"" that tie Union cannot be
preserved unless the rights Of the States be re-
spected; and that there is no States Rights party
but that of Breckinridge and Lane and the fourth
(weakest Of ally approved the administration of
James Buchanan.


On the above platform, which is quite as ortho-
dox as could be desired, the orators took their
stand, and Cameron county thus stands committed
(for she votes 400 Democratic votes to 20 of all
other kinds) either to resist The election of Mr..
Lincoln or else to submit to degradation and
slavery @@.


My previous letter had SO nettled the fshy DEM
ocrats and questionable Southerners, that in full
meeting resolution was moved and adopted to
publish the proceedings of the meeting in the New
Orleans Daily Crescent, in order to assure the
editor of that paper that Cameron county was not
freesoil in her affections | sincerely approved
and applauded the motion, for know you feel in.
| terested in the subject.


| However, since the meeting, the people, or a
| considerable crowd of them, have thought over
| the resolutions, and they do not like to be com
mtted thereto. They talk of boiling the platform

says the Ben Lews, from Memphis for St..
Louis, exploded and burned within sigbt of
Cairo, at about o'clock this morning. The
loss of life has been great, but at this hour
we are unable to give full particulars. The
Ben Lewis left here at about half past twelve
with a good passenger trip. There could not
have been less than two hundred persons on
board in all. The Lewis appeared TO he en-
deavoring to make quick trip and is said
to have been very hot when she left here.
Inc explosion took place a few minutes after
one o'clock just as the boat was maxine the
turn at the Junction Of the rivers. TO 90 nm
the mississippi The shock was verv heavy
much like that of an earthquake' iarring
every house in town. Directly after The ex9
pioslon the most heart rendering and aponiz-
ing screams and cries for help could be dis
ilnctly heard. But they were soon ouieted
and did not break out again until the boat
commenced burning, which was within fifteen
minutes after the explosion.


Two steamers and several skiffs immediate.
~ started out to the assistance of the passen.
gers The Bay City, though she had IN
steam, and though her captain was specially
l!nportuned and begged to 90 to the scene Of
The disaster, refused to do so, the captain saw.
ing that he did rot choose to risk his boat
lhe sunny Side came down from St. Louis
shortly after the boat commenced burning
and rendered very valuable assistance.


Ihe Sunny Side, Lake Erie and Mononqa.
hela returned from the wreck at three O'Clock
this morning. The Lake Erie brought about
thirty OF the survivors, the Monongahela
three, and the Sunny Side large crowd.
All were picked up out of the water.


The boat was torn in pieces by the explo-
sion, all forward of the wheelhouse. After
burning to the waters edge, she sunk. From
the best information We can obtain at this
hour, but few were lost, not over six or eiyht
though some say that persons were on the
burning boat just before she sunk.


Another dispatch from Cairo of the same
date, says:


A number of lives are known to be lost
Capt. Manson is among the missinc The
body OF Mrs. Williams (of St Louis) has been
found and brought up here. Two of Mr.
W llliams' daughters were saved. but he has
lost two children. Two or three of the
wounded at the st. Charles Hotel will proba
7j ~ '''''''' '''' al


Some Of the passengers of the Lewis who
were picked up out Of the river, took passage
IN the Bay City for st. Louis, and were put
'tf on the 'lissouri side by the Captain be
cause they had no money. A crowd of peo-
pie started out this morning to lynch the
Captain of the Bay City, but were persuaded
not to do so. The indignation felt on account
Of this treatment of the unfortunate victims is
very great"

NEW HAVEN. Januury 3l Ise(",,"A'A"" AAA'H>, oSshuaiy loOV.

 Dear Enquirer: Possibly the people of Rich mend, Va. are in some doubt about the precise degree Of affection entertained by the citizens of New Haven. Conn. for the Union in general and for them in particular. Their papers had hardly ceased replying to the indignant remonstrances of the Fair Hayeners against the Virginia oyster tax, with the bland suggestion to their Governor to do""ble it, and thus chastise the abolition Tan Hees-not by scorpions exactly, but through those more am!able bivalves when the report Of the New Haven Union meeting reached them full of genudexions and prostrations, and oscula tions of the claws of the American Eag'e, Thi. unexpected return of good for evil,-that the same coas of fire which had been hungrily kindled foa the cxorbtant oysters should be mildly transfer red to their own "" toasted heads-seems to have struck them all of heap"" with astonishment And recently one of our conservative"" citizens desiring to visit that city on business, and having natural desire to be lynched as an abolitionst as few times as possible on the route, procured as passport, the resolutions of the Union meet ing engrossed on parchment and thus equipped tremblingy journeyed to the metropolis of the Old Dominion. Arrived there, he waited on the Governor with the parchment-desirin as it seemed to save his own skin by that of one of his brethren,-with the remarkable statement that he had been delegated by the citizens of New Haven to communicate the sentiments +o bo of Governor condescended to be propitiated--I may even say gratfed at the circumstance hay ing sent the scroll to the legislature possibly as hint that the Yankees would bear little more squeezing on those oysters.) that august body in vited the Yankee to address them. His speech, we are given to understand, was quite an intel lectual feast to the F. F. V.'s being as soft as cotton, and sweet as sugar, and oily as darkeys, and stuffed plentifully with such raisins as Southern Rights"" Abolition Frenzy"" ;"" John Randolph, &c., &c.,, and doubtless would have had immense influence, if it had not been pre- ceded by rabid harangue on the other side by the delegate whom South Carolina had sent to Richmond to invite Virginia to dissolve the Union; suffice to say that our ambassador got away from the city with no broken bones, leav- ing the impression there that New Haven was ready to trucke to the slave drivers to any extent

 But the next day removed that delusion The Richmond Young Mems Christian Association which had sent circular to various other Asso citations, inviting them to pray for the safety of the Union, received reply from the Association in New Haven, intimating that though they were quite ready to pray for the Union they didn't want the disunionists to lead the prayers ; and expressing their intention to take their own time for fasting for national sins viz. our national Fast day. Directly in the heels of that letter came another from the minority expressing their regret that the majority had been so cohtnma- cious, and also their own personal willingness to abstain from food till their bones ached if it would afford any qualification to their Southern. brethren.

 After all these conflicting evidences what will the virginians think of us?

 There having been recently expressed some dissatisfaction with the preaching of Rev. Dr. Dutton of the North Church, meeting of the Society was held Monday evening to decide what should be done in the premises. The vote stood for retaining him 62; for dismissal g blank 4.

sent Legislature will so amend the Constitu-
tion as to confer upon local magistrates more
extensive prcrogatives than they at present
enjoy. In our opinion the jurisdiction of
justices of the peace is quite too limited. If
it were increased to $500, large class of
cases could be economically adjudicated that
now have to be carried 10 the higher courts
at an expense vastly dsproportioned to their
Importance. Much costly litigation would
thus be prevented, and an equitable resort
opened to many who cannot afford to test
their right against aggressors. In great
number of instances the decisions of a JUS
tice, particularly in mining cases, would be
more equitable and satisfactory to Etigants
than those Of a higher tribunal removed
from the locality of dispute and ignorant of
local regulations.


Another effect of extending the jurisdc-
ton Of justices would be, to make the office
one of more value to incumbents, and con-
sequently insure its being -oftener filled by
competent persons. In the rural, and most
of the mining townships, it is of much i'm
portance for the preservation of peace and
order that the local magistrate should be an
officer of more consequence than the present
justice, whose meagre fees are insufficient
to support him, and deter him from taking
active measures tO sccura ohpdienca tn law
because the expense will mostly fall upon
himself and his assistants the constables-
Not unfrequenty the justice of the peace is
the most worthless man in the community.
Good ntured barroom loafers, iliterate and
Incorporate, are sometimes thrust into The
position, because no better persons can af-
ford 10 take it. Hence the law is brought
into diSreputc with the Ignorant and local
vice fourisheS, as the result of mean econ
omy. The inefficiency of local magistrates
is the principal cause of much of the lynch
ing which still disgraces our State. We be-
ieye the measure suggested would 90 far to
remove it, and that alone is ample reason
for its adoption.


Ifjustces were allowed jurisdiction in all
cases where the amount does not exceed
S500-though we think the limit might
safely be extended even ftrther-the county
and district courts would be much relieved,
and courts of session might be abolished al
together."

NEVADA ITEMs.-We condense from the
Democrat as follows: The Irishmen of Ne
vada and surrounding townships have de-
termined to organize mutual benevolent
association.


Three thousand tons of rock were crushed
at the mill of the Oriental Mining Company,
up Deer Creek, during 1852 and yielded
about 100000. The cost of quarrying,
hauling and crushing the rock averaged
about $l3 a ton. 1t was mostly from the
Lecompton Lead, which pays from SIS to
$40 ton, and has paid its proprietors since
it was opened in the spring of 1853, a net
profit of 100000.


The receipts of the city government for
six months preceding the lst inst were
$500; expenditures, 1886 so.


Speaking on the railroad topic our cotem :
porary thinks the amount Of freight that
would be brought to Nevada and Grass VAL
ley could scarcely be less than 1900 tons per
week, which at $40 ton, would amount to
S624,000 per annum. If we estimate the
business OF Placer county at two-thirds that
of Nevada the road would pay for itself in
less than three years.


Grass VALLEY.-The National strikes a





would pay 20 per cent. per annum, admit
ting that it cost two millions and Il half DOL
lars.


The turnpike connecting Grass Valley and
Nevada has paid more than five per cent per
month on cost


Two Indians were probably lynched at

$4,000 or $4,000. Below the deepest
ground yet worked there is thick stratum
of clay and one of quicksand, under which
it is thought good diggings may be found.
Whether this be so or not deep tunnel is
needed for draining and washing ground that

The Morristown (Tenn) Intelligencer contains
the following particulars


We have rarely heard of more diabolical and
fendish outrage than the one perpetrated yester-
day, eight miles above this place, and two miles
from Russelyille, in Hawkins county. 1t seems
that man, or rather demon, by the name of
Joshua Ballard, armed himself with scythe blade,
and started from his home with the intention of
numbering some person. The first man he en-
countered was Mr.. Bewley, but it appears Bew
ley escaped without material injury.


He then went to the house of Mr.. Horner, and
told him that he intended to kill him, and COM
menced cutting him with the scythe blade Horner
received eight severe wounds upon the head and
other parts OF the person. We are informed he
cannot possibly survive. Ballard then went to the
house of a Mrs. Robson: she saw him coming and
closed the door. Ballard, however, broke the door
down, went in, hauled her from under the bed, and
inflicted several wounds upon her; she, by some
means. escaped from him. Not satisfied, he com
menced upon two of her children, inflicting seve-
raj gashes upon their bodies.


BY this time several of the neighbors collected
to take him, but Ballard swore he would not be
taken, and started in run for his home. He was
hotly pursued, however, and barely reached his
house and secreted himself in the cabin loft, when
he was fired upon through the cracks between the
logs. There was bag of cotton in his loft which
he used to Screen himself from the bullets and Ou1
informant gentleman of veracity, says that some
seyentyiive shots fired before he was killed
He stood and cursed his pursuers till he fell dead
| His mother also stood in the yard during the time
| swearing she would send the whole party to h L
| before she was done with them.


| It appears that Ballard was desperate charac
ter-addicted to strong drink and all kinds of dis
| sipation. He was the champion of the neighbor
| hood and most men were afraid to encounter hin
/ single-handed. We saw him engaged in a row
with the Irish in this place, some five years ago
and he made party Of about twenty leave tht
| street. We are opposed to lynching man, but il
| this case there was, it seems. no alternative,"

Nevada Journal, letter from Col. Whitman
to his son, dated June 2nd.


1t showed all day June lst, at Virginia
City. Nothing remarkably new in the way
Of discoveries. The town was growing sensi-
bly, duller Many were leaving, and Indian
troubles deferred people from coming in. Pro-
visions high and scarce. A vigilance COM
mittee was about organizing to lynch a
butcher. but it was promptly nipped in the
bud.


In reference to the war, the Colonel says,
unless help in the way of provisions, etc, is
furnished by California, the volunteers must
disband and the whole fighting he given up to
two hundred regulars on foot, in which event
he fears depopulation of the Territory, as
the signs of long and bloody war are i'm
minent. Unless the American troops can
meet the savages in few days and give
them a severe lesson in a great battle, the
worst is anticipated When leaving Virginia
City, Col Hays told his troops that unless
they were willing to live on meat for some
time, the road was open to Carson City and
they were at liberty to take it. Not man
left."

In the afternoon again repaired to the Crtho-

hearing Archbishop Hughes, who read portion
of scripture for the basis Of few remarks relative
to the present troubles which environ the Pope.
He was listened to by crowded and attentive
congregation. He appears to be considerably

physical disability, was compelled to occupy

publican, who was delegate to Charleston
and Baltimore, and who did not, we believe,
secede, though he subsequently supported
the candidates of the boilers, thus gives bis
convictions of what he considers the duty of
the Cotton States-which is to withdraw
from the Union-and of the dishonor that,
in his opinion awaits the South if they re-.
main. Mr. GLASS says:


We honestly believe the Cotton States ought
to 60 out of tbs Union just as soon as they can
get out. And we believe so, not merely be.
cause of the political grievances which they
suffer, but because if they do not 60 out, after
their threats and declared purposes, they will
not only disgrace themselves in the eyes Of the
world, and make themselves the laughing stock
of the North, but they will reflect dishonor upon
the whole South and Southern character. These
States cannot now retreat from the position
they have deliberately taken, even if they de.
sired to do so. 1t is secession or dishonor with
them.


That seems to be, we regret to say, the
prevailing sentiment at the South."

The BILLIARD DTouRNAaEsT.-The great series Of
games played by the most expert billiard players
Of the United States was continued yesterday ON
Phelan's tables in Fourteenth street. There were
hundreds of professional billiard champions from
all parts of the country present, besides largo
number Of New < ork gentlemen, patronizsra n the
play. The first game was between Messrs. White
and Lynch. The lead was won by nv. White, aud
there were twenty-ninc runs MAIDS before the gsme
of five hundred up won. He had scored three
hundred and fifty-one, however, when his competi-
tor had run up his five hundred. On one ran Mr..
Lynch neared the extraordinary figure Of I62.s The
highest number made by Mr.. White was forty three.
The average of the playing was not very easra-
ordinary. 5sa s5 M
The second game was much more interesting
than the first. TWAS between Mr.. Tefnan and Mr.
Geary Twenty-seven runs were made before il
his second run Teman made 1877, and on his fourth
1856, exceeding anything that has been done since
| the tournament commenced. He then played
carelessy the rest of the game, and succeeded In
beating his opponent easily by 224 points. Geary
made one run Of Go, Whchwas by far the best
specimen of his dexterity which he displayed.
The winners were both applauded but Meman re--
eeived by far the greatest amount of paudiis.


Monsieur Berger, the celebrated French. player,
and Mr. Phelan, the American champion, were both
present. and took lively interest in the progress.
of the play. Tieman and Eapanagh have eachi
come out victorious from three games, and they
| play off to-day for the prizes. the second best
player being also to receive prize similar to the
one to be carried of by the best. MIR. Phelan will
play with the winner on Thursday before
| ladies and gentlemen, and thus close the tonrna-
ment. New York Herald of Wednesday,."

charge of the polite driver, Mr. Lynch. 1t
didn't take him long to find the DEMOCRAT
office, after he got out of the stage, and he
came without stopping to get shaved or
shampooed. A little shaking Of himself got
him pretty well cleansed of the dust, and he
presented very respectable appearance
But in any style in which he could have
come, he would have been welcome He was
greeted on his arrival with one universal
shout from the compositorial fraternity.
while the door of the sanctum sanctorum,-
rare circumstance, was thrown wide open
for his admission. Bill wagged his tail until
it was numb, and his eyes spoke volumes. 1t
was some time before the excitement subsi-
ded, but it did finally, and ended in a calm
feeling ofinward satisfaction all around the
office, in the knowledge that Bill was at
home and was happy.

1t is emphaticay denied on behalf of Heenan
and Sayers, that either party desire the battle to
be considered drawn, and it is still claimed for
each that he could have won in few minutes
more had the fight been continued.


George Wilkes, of New York denies, in let
ter to the London Times. that the referee stop
ped the fight at the request of Heenan or his
friend, and asserts that Heenan virtually won
but Will be ready to renew the struggle at an
hours notice. and will accept of no other trophy
than the belt which he came to win, and which
he honestly believes he did win. He believes he
can win it again. and will not leave England till
he brings the late contest to new and due con-
cluSion.


Considerable sumsof money had been collected
at London and Liverpool for Sayers, who was to
attend at the Stock Exchange on 2lst, and be pre-
sented with hundred guineas
Nothing had been determined on respecting the
measures to be taken for settlement of the affair
between Heenan and Sayers.
The referees decision was to be made the next
week. The friends of both parties declare their
anxiety for another meeting. Heenan strenuously
claims having won the fight. Sayers friends are
equally sangune.


1t was thought that strong steps will be taken
by the authorities to prevent another hostile meet

field. The little girl was dropping corn for
her father when she discovered the segen
disguised men at the end of the row waiting
for them to approach. Informing him, the
father turned to flee and was shot down. The
party then took person named Taylor, also
at work in the field, carried him into the
woods and hung him to a tree and then fled

The idea of appealing from the decision of a constitutional convention of a State-the highest embodiment of sovereignty known to our forms of law to the Supreme Court of the United States to determine whether slave property shall be admitted or prohibited, is an absurdi,y. And yet Judge Douglas construction of the Kansas bill involves this very absurdi- ty, for i, places the power of State, and that of Territory on this subject, on an equal footing. The organic act goes fur ther, and declares that when legal ma l ljority of the residents of either Territory form Constitution, then they may either recognize or exclude slavery, as they may elect It gives the people the ultimate power to decide this question, and fixes the period and defines the time when they may exercise this right In the mean time, it places the rights of shareholders in both Territories subject, as we have al. ready observed, not to the Territorial leg islature--not to the Lynch law of the grab game of squatter sovereignty, but to the courts, acting under the general principles of the Constitution and American public law.

 The contemporaneous history of this measure shows that this was the construc- ton assigned to it at the time of its pass age by it's supporters. Almost every sup porter of this measure who participated in it's discussion, avowed 'that the extent of the limit imposed by the constitution on the Territorial Legislature"" and per consequences the right to hold Slaves during it's Territorial condition, was made depen- dant. not upon the Legislature, but was explicitly made subject of Judicial de- cision. go further and assert that every Southern man who supported this measure declared that if such unlimited power was intended to be conferred on the Territorial Legislature as Judge Douglas now assigns to it; it could not receive his sup port. Gov Brown, of Mississippi, in the discussion pending this measure declared: :"" If thought that in voting for this Bill as it now stands. was conceding the right of the people of the Territory, during their Territorial condition to exclude slavery, would withhold my vote."" MT. Barksdale, of the same State, warm supporter of the Bill, in the same discuss sion declares Il deem it proper here to declare that if non-ntervention means, as some here contend, the abandonment of any duty by the Federal Government, to avoid the hazard of performing it, ] scorn and utterly reject the doctrine. H IS only acceptable 10 me and there repre- sent as principle ayhich is 10 contne the Federal Gopernment to the great object for phich it was instituted not to fetter ats arm, so that H cannot hold its protecting shield over epery citizen of the United States, aohether found within the Territory subject 10 Federal jurisdiction, or upon tte high seas, schere federal jurisdiction alone could avaI him. With this interpretation of the doctrine of intervention 1 &C., cept it.

 ~ * x But if on the other hand the doctrine of squatter sovereignty be the true one, that is to say if the terri tories belong to the few or many who chance first to reach it, we have nothing to delegate"" MT. Butler, of South Car oina, says, II am perfectly willing to

 leave it under the constitution to be deci- ded by the law tribunals of the country. | If in the process of settlement the people of these Territories shall be prepared tc take upon themselves the attributes of a sovereign State, they can then certainly either admit or exclude slavery. l pre-. sume that will not be denied by any one

 During their growth and before they be- come State, can they assume to exercise power which Congress itself cannot confer upon them? They can have nc deriyitive power on the subject from any act of ours k | Congress has no constitutional competency to legislate one way or another-eilhe

 to introduce or prohibit slavery in tht Territories. Territorial government ha! no deriviiive authority 10 do so from any act which Congress can pass. MT. Daw' son, of Georgia. says: ""I am perfectly willing 10 leave this subject to the Court: under the constitution"" Gen. Cass says 1"" The power of the people to leglslalt upon their internal concerns IS clearl, given in this bill, if the constitution per 1aifs it. If the Con. \ stiiution does not permit it hey have no got it."" MT. Hunter, of Virginia, says The bill provides that the legislatures Q these territories shall have the power tt

On examining the wound of Anderson, it
was found that the ball had struck about
four inches below the left nipple, and meeting
a rib, glanced round and lodged near the
spine, without entering the cavity of the
chest The wound, though a severe one, is
not considered dangerous, though from his
splitting blood, indicating internal hemor-
rhage, it was at frst thought to be SO. Tn
der this impression the feeling against Luf-
kin, for the time intense. On his reaching
Carson City in charge of the officer, there
was disposition on the part of some of the
excitable to lynch the prisoner. No attempt
however way made to take him from the
officer He has since been let out on bail.
On Thursday morning the ball was cut out

the wound by no means serious."

from Col. Whitman to his son, dated June
End.


1t showed all day June lst, at Virginia
city. Nothing remarkably new in the way
of discoveries. The town was growing
senSibly duller. Many were leaving and Indi
an troubles deferred people from coming in.
Provisions high and scarce. A vigilance
committee was about organizing to lynch
a butcher, but it was promptly nipped In
the bud.


In reference to the war the Colonel SAYS,
unless help in the way of provisions etc. is
furnished by California the volunteers must
disband and the whole fighting given up to
two hundred regulars on foot, in which
event he fears depopulation of the Terri
tory, as the signs of long and bloody war
are imminent. Unless the American troops
can meet the savages in few DAYS and
give them severe lesson in a great battle,
the worst is anticipated When leaving
Virginia City, Col Hays told his troops
that unless they were willing to live on
meat for some time, the road was open to
to Carson City and they were at liberty to
take it. Not man left.


great battle was expected to come off
on Sunday last. The Col says Nevada
and Sierra came nobly to the relief of their
brethren IN Utah; Sacramento did some
thing, but not more than enough to pay for
stolen horses. San Francisco, with mil
lions at stake had done nothing."
