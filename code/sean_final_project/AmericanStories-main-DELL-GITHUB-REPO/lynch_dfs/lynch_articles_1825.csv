On the birth day of the General, t""o donations
were presented to him in the drawing oi the
President, and in presence of the large and disin-
guished assemblage of gentlemen who had been in
Ivited BY the President to dinner that day.
The first was miniature portrait Of Colonel
HUGER, OF South Carolina, the gallant American

the liberation OF Lafayette from the dungeons OF

the City of Charleston 1t is OF the larger size,
most superbly set in gold and gems, with suitable
inscription, and was transmitted BY The hands Of
MIR. Proleau, of Charleston.


The second donation was the splendid volume

&C. of the city, the Generals answers The resolution
Of Congress, the Presidents invitation, &C. &C. We
had seen this work mentioned in the New York pa.
pers but had no Ilea il was worthy Of admiration.
The volume is large folio, superbly boand and the
penmanship and decorations most beautiful. 1t was
brought on by Messrs. CUcdpry aud .NortoR, and
presented to the General accompanied by hand
some address, on the part Of the city of New York.
by the former gentlemen.


In noticing the incidents occurring during the
last visit o the General to the Seat al Government,
and the private hospitaes shown to him, il wonld
be unjust not to mention the large and splendid Din
ner Party given to him BY the Postmaster General


.Nat. Intell.

The Orleans letters of that date stale that the cny

7_1825-11-10_p2_sn85042523_00271740244_1825111001_0468,"The Wilmingtonian, and Delaware advertiser.",01,1825-11-10,p2,TIE WESTERN LAKES.,,"one OF his lectures.


THE WESTERN LAKES.
We extract the following account OF the
great Western Lakes, from an essay publish
ed in the New York Statesman g.
1. The Ontario is 1870 miles long 40 miles
wide, 500 feet deep; and its surface is com
puted at 2is feet above the elevation OF tide
water at Three Rivers, 270 miles below
| Cape Vincent.
9. Erie is 2To miles long, 60 miles wide,
900 feet deep; and its surface is ascertained
to be SOS feet above tide water at Albany.


5. Huron is $50 miles long, 100 miles aver
age breadth, 900 feet deep, and its surface
is near sos feet above the tide water.


A. Michigan is 400 miles long, SO wide,
depth unknown; elevation the same as HUI
ron.


5. Green Bay is about los miles long,
20 miles wide, depth unknown; elevation
the same as Huron and Michigan.


6. Lake Superior IS 4s0 miles long, 109
miles average width, 900 feet deep, and ITS
surface is 1O48 feet above the tide water.


Hence il is easy to calculate that the bot
tom of Lake Erie is not as low as the foot OF
Niagara Falls; but the bottom ofeach of the
other lakes, it will be observed is lower than
the surface of the ocean.


Lake Superior is the head fountain, the
grand reservoir of the mighty volume that
fills the rivers, expands into lakes, and roars
over the cataracts of the Niagara, ST. Law
rance, &c. After making a semi-circle 81
FIVE degrees to the south, accommodating
and enrichng one of the most fertile and IN
tcresting sections of the glob"", it meets the
tide distance Of 5000 miles from its source,
an 500 from the extreme point OF its entry
cn the Atlantic coast.


Mach Ruce.-Yesterdav the great match
race was run at the Union course, (E. ~
between Gen. Wynn's bay mare fNriH@,
by Sir Archy, ) years old, and Mr.. Lynch's
grey colt .frici by Eclipse, ; years old, 9
mile heats, $50, 600 aside Great confidence
was manifested in both horses, and the
friends Of each were never more positive.
Many believing in the fleetness { Ariel, Of
fered freely on her side the first heat, ana
the result showed they were not mistaken in
their calculations. She won the first heat
but lost the race.


At starting she took the lead and was
followed by FlirtIlla in handsome gentle
gallop all the first mile round, To the Judges
box, when She made dash, passed her an
tagonist, and the remaining two miles were
/
with the exception of the race between II
clipse and Henry, as was ever performed
on this or any other course in the United
States. Ariel won the heat by about half
her length. Time Of running the first mile
in this heat pm 12s.--thc other two miles
were performed in 3m. AIS. which is an aver
age of I'm. So 1-2s to each Of the last two
miles of this heat; which IS unprecedented,
with the exception above stated. Although
they were SIN. 59s. in ruaning the whole
heat. it is believed, if both horses had been
put any where near the top OF their speed
from the start, it would have been done in
shorter time than we have on record.


The second heat Flirtilla pursued a differ
ent policy, and went to her work in gaol
earnest from the score. SAc took the lead
and was suffered to run on great way a
head by the rider of Ariel, SO that when he
made his effort to close up the gap it proYcd
to be little, and but a very little too late.
The last qnartcr of a mile she gained upon
her antagonist every jump, and lost the heat
by only head. So close was it, and with
such astonishing rapidity did she pass Fir
tlla just upon the line OF the coming i'll point,
that strong doubts existed until it was pro-
claimed from the Judges in their box, which
had gained the heat. Time Of running this
heat 5m. 5i l-2s.


Confidence now began to be impaired in
Ariel's ability to win the race, and two toI
one were offered and taken on FlrtillA for
the third heat, and she did not disappoint
her backers. In this heat, as indeed in the
other two. she showed great bottom,
strength and speed. She went off in full
blast, relying upon her bottom, and left
Ariel far behind, and won the heat BY about
half a distance, or 80 yards. Time of RUM
ing this heat SIN. SIS. Each horse carried
weight according to age-Eirtilla ll3 Id.
and Ariel 81 lb,-.N Y. Post Noe. S.
