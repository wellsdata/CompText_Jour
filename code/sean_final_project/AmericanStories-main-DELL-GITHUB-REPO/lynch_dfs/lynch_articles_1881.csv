 It has been discovered that rich coal beds underlie the busy little town of Morrilton.

 All the furniture of the gambling house at Hot Springs, was gathered Tn the street and burned on Thurs. day.

 L. Washington. . mill hand at Alma, was killed on Thursday by James Embry, discharged employ ee whose place he had filled.

 Josephine Williams, lunatic temporarily confined in the jail at Helena, was kicked to death by Temple Russell, q cell-mate, on Thursday.

 Gov. Churchill has issued a pro- clamation offering reward of $500 each for the arrest and conviction of the parties who assassinated Mar shal w. D. Patton and Deputy Sher- if Mount at Fayetteville on the night of July 3. Tue double murder grew out of feud of sixteen years stand ing and which thus far has resulted in the death of six persons. The tragedy has stirred Washington county as it was never reused be- fore and it is feared that matters can not be adjusted without further bloodshed. A large number of ar rests are contemplated and owing to the excited state of public feeling it would be dangerous to confine the parties m the jail at Fay etteyille, as lynching would be like Iy to speedily follow. It ia under stood that the state authorities will not rest until the vendetta is com pletely wiped out."

The deed was committed yesterday evening.
The child was cruelty larcerated. The mother
discovered the atrocity ar late hour, and thu
child divulged the name of the villain, who
was shortly after arrested by the police. Az
n late hour large crowd assembled around
the jail, and rope was prepared for hanging
the criminal. Chief Barry was requested to.

Suspecting their design he refused, and set
guard on the jail. This afternoon Cook. step
father of the child, was in the Police Court
armed with revolver. AS he had expressed
his intention to shoot the prisoner he was
watched and disarmed. Shortly after enter
ing the Court-room the prisoner plead guilty
to the charge, and was bound over in s., 600
and then hurried back to prison. Outrases
of similar kind are getting too common,
and from present indications Hoyt is very
likely yet to be summarily dealt with by
Judge Lynch."

nothing found in it to warrant change
of judgment. Mr.. Lynch has not been
washed whittier than snow but has been
adjudged just little guilty. The gen.

SACRAMENTO, Jan. 2O.-Murder

lowing the relatives of the victim
to take the life of the murderer,
was introduced simply for the pur-
pose Of giving opportunity for
satire on the present feeble at
tempts Of our judiciary to adminis-
ter Justice. The discussion went
further than that and took the form
Of an earnest protest against
the eickening seDtimentality
which allows slayers of men

Quite extensive fires have ragged
for some time past in the neigh

posed, carefully guarded against
any possibility of danger by clear.
ing off the ground fer oonsidera-
BILE distance. a sudden whirlwind
arose and whirled the burning en-
bers for some distance. The grass,
being as dry as finder, took fire and
burned for a space of nearly fifteen
hundred acres, utterly divesting
that portion of the ranch of its
luxurlant dry feed. Col. Baker,
by mploying u large force of la
borers, succeeded in checking
the flames. For sons days
past fierce fires have been de.

mas, which Is located above the
mouth ofthe Azusa csfion. At
times, at night, the scene has been
picturesque iI the extreme, dense
volumes of smoke being illumined
by fitful tongues of fire, the whole
remark ably resembling a volcano
in course of eruption. Thus far the
destruction has been localized, the
San Gabriel valley escaping the
visitation. Certainly measures
should be taken to secure immun.

The Coroner's Statement Of


the Murderer.

ESPECIAL BY TELEGRAPH TO TIE rrcoHD-uslosl",,"ORoEILLE, September 27th.-A terrible
murder was committed at the Espy place,
on the Forbestown road, about twelve miles
above here, last evening about o'clock. j.
B. Espy had been in town during ths day,
attending the obsequies of the President, end
on his return home was accompanied BY
James S. Andrews, young man of %,
son of james L. Andrews, living near
his place. Arriving at home, and while
they were unhitching the horses, gun was
fred. and young Andrews, exclaiming, ""Oh.
my God :"" fell dead. By the fash of the gun
Espy recognized 4. r. Sproul, who had been
working for him, as having fred the fatal
ahot, and believing himself to have been tie
intended victim, Immediately fed to a neigh
boris house and gave the alarm. The neigh
Dor at once came to town and procured
warrant for the arrest of Sproul, and just as
the Sheriff was ready TO start policeman
Parks arrived at the jail with Sproul, who
had come to town, and finding Parks on the
street gave himself up, saying lie had shot
and killed Espy. When told who he had
killed he staggered against the wall of the
jail, and was entirely overcome. The Cor.
oner is now out holding an inquest, and no
further particulars are yet received. Sproul
has a wife and three children. Espy is also
a man of family Andrews is q single man.
Domestic difficulty is supposed to have
prompted the shooting, though nothing is yet
definitely known.


SECOND DISPATcH.l


ORovILLE, September 27th.-The Coroner's
inquest on the boiy of James Andrews shot
by E. r. Sproul, found that he had been shot
twice with double-barreled shotgun-once
under the left arm. close up, and once in the
right side about the tenth rib-either wound
being fatal, and that the shots wers fired by
E. r. Sproul, with intent to kill j, B. Espy.


STATEMENT OF THE MURDERER.


Your correspondent had brief interview
with the prisoner this evening in the Jail, and
he expressed an entire willingness to tell the
entire story of his wrongs and the shooting.
A brief statement Of his story is that he has
been for some time in the employ of Espy
az his summer ranch at Franklin
Hall. in Plumas county that last
winter he arranged with Espy
to keep his family at the home
place, where ths shooting occurred, he to pay
monthly stipend for their keeping during
the winter, while he was away at work to
earn living for them that at this time and
place Espy succeeded .in se5ucing his wife
that last spring she returned to him tSproul)
to Franklin Hill, where they have since re-
sided that only week ago he first discov-
cred his dishonor, and that he then told Espy,
who vas then there, 10 never again speak to
him or his wife, or he would kill him on
sight; that day or SO after he discovered by
an Intercepted letter that his wife and Espy
had arranged for a correspondence under as-
sumed names that thi5 50 maddsned him that
he at once started on foot for Espy's place
about seventy miles away, with the full in,
tent to kill him on sight. He arrived ct the
place after dark, and by inquiry of neigh
Dor had learned Espy's whereabouts, and
that be was shortly expected home He
posted himself by the stable. and shortly the
wagon drove up, and the person driving got
out and unhitched the team, and then stood
waiting for some time before putting the
horses away that when he started TO do So,
he (Sproul) stepped out and fred at him
twice, and he fell, and that he then started
for town to give himself up He said he had
no idea of trying to conceal his crime that
he desired to have met and shot Epsy in
broad daylight. He is very much affected
over


HIS FATAL MISTAKE,


And breaks down in conversation when al
luding to it, It appears that Espy was
warned of his intent, and that when he and
young Andrews got within about 200 yards
of his place he got out and allowed Andrews
to dive up to the barn alone, though Espy
claims that he told Andrews why be did so,
and Andrews replied that he had no reason to
fear, as Sproul had nothing against him.
The shooting occurred about o'clock P. N.
Sproul does not attempt to deny or palliate
the offense, except to regret his terrible mis-
take in the darkness.


The prisoners preliminary examination is
set for next Thursday.


The funeral of Andrews will take place to-

Democrats on the ground that it was a part
of the so called ""MahOne bargain and they

him uncOn1irmed.


THE open session of the Senate on the 2Sth
lasted only half an hour, when the doors were

undecided contest over the nomination for
the Lynchburg Post office was resumed. Mr..
Hill (Ga.) spoke in opposition to confirmation

and others at great length, the political feat
ures of the case and Importance attached to
its probable bearings upon the. result OF the

| expressed and distinctly emphasized.
| Speeches were interspersed with number OF
| roll calls and motions to adjourn and other
dilatory proceedings. The Democrats offered
to go on and confirm all of the nominations
unobjected to, leaving the others to be set
tied afterward This the Republicans re-
fused to do, and the contest was continued
until 2 80 a. m, when an adjournment was ef-
fected, leaving the question still undecided.

people will become dangerous to the perpetu-

motion, which was unanimously agreed
| to, and the Senate proceeded to con-


firm large number of other nominations.


While the doors were still closed, but after


the transaction of executive business, com


mittee appointed to wait upon the President
reported that he had nothing further to COM
municate, and a motion to adjourn sine die

ginia and Mississippi afford an impor
tant study Of the political situation in
the South. The Republican opposi.
ton has become SO Insignificant and
the Democratic majorities SO large
and unwiel that they can no longer
hold together. Want of ou tside
pressure, the constant fading away Of
the war Issues. and internal rivalrfes
and iealousies operate together to
disrupt the Democratic party. The
process Of this falling to pieces of q
great party welded together by ties Of
long association, by once common
purpose aud interest and b. a party
discipline the most rigid aud dictate
rial known to our history, must neces-
sarily be slow. But the dissolution
is progressing nevertheless.


CFor All illustration let us look at
the Mahone movement in Virgins,
the fierce fight between the BArks-
dale and Lamar faCtiuns in Mississippi,
the outspo ell opposition Of the Vicks-
burg Herald to the fraudulent usur-
patton OF MIR. Lynch's seat in Con-
yres., and in our own STATE to the
large Greeuack detection from the
Democratic party, under the able
| leadership OF Col. Lowe.


1t all means that the crack Of the
party whip will soon be no more
potent iu the South than in the
North. The name Democrat is los
ing its magic spell. Times have
changed and interests conflict and
men are forced to be governed by
kStern realities. The great public
questions which Southern Statesmen
4
held swallowed up all ether issues
and called for the united support
without regard to personal sacrifices,
have been removed. Men may now
follow their personal fortunes and ex-
ercise their judgement in public af-
fairs without being stigmatized as
traitors.


As between the two wings of the
Democracy the duty Of Republicans is
plain. The party proper clings des-
Perately to the past-the reactionist>
put that past behind them and ad
dress themselves to living issues. They
boldly advocate a free ballot and Il
fair count. They are willing to ex
tend equal political rights to all men.
While these are questions before the
public minor issues of currency may
be overlooked and coalitions he form
ed for the accomplishment Of the more
Xilal objects.


by pursuing this course Republi-
cans will be striking the most effective
blows for the principles Of their par
Pfy. Those Republicans in Virginia
who contend tor separate ticket art
fighting the battle Of the 3ourbons.
The wise and sensible course for Re-
publicans in Virginia is to support
the MahoDe movement, and the same
is true OF their brethren throughout
the South wherever like situation
s>presrnt= Itself."

lynch-law since the acqui.tal of Neal


as q punishment for crime when juries


fail to meet their expectations would


stop and think over the matter little


they will find that theSe is something


radically wrong in the law that makes


death the only punishment for the


crime of rape. As to the business of the


punishment for the crime there can


hardly be two opinions, for above all


the characters loathed on earth the
ravisher is the most execrable. Unlike
other crimes, however, the testimony to
convict a ravisher generally rests un-


supported upon the testimony of one
person. There may be corroboratng
evidence in many cases, but as mat
ter of course in the most dastardly and
outrageous cases the whole case rests
upon the testimony of the prosecuting
witness. In murder there are degrees
of runishment--murder in the first de-
gree, second degree and manslaughter.
Should the evidence not warrant IA con
yiction for murder in the first degree, Il
jury can fall back upon the second de.
gree and II even that is thought too |
severe they can fall back upon man
slaughter, as they did in the Carberry
case. Had there been no intermediate
ground upon which to stand Carberry
would have been running at large to-
day with the blood Of Adams, his vic
tim, crying aloaa for justice.


In the case of Neal, though the jury
and everybody outside of it agreed that
he should be punished to some extent,
there were many ami amongst them the
jury who thought that capita punish
ment was too severe as the Jury hal
doubts as to the extent of his guilt in
the crime with which he was charged.
Had there been grades of punishment in
case of conviction for the crime of rape
Neal, instead of reveling in the sweet
blessings Of liberty far away from dan.
ger, would be ianguishing in a telon's ,
cell either for term of years or for life.
Men like Neal should not be RAINING at
large though he has already undergone
q torture of suspense between life and
death which is almost worse than death
itself But the law is positive, There
is but one punishment for the crime of
rape and that is death. We frankly
say that where the crime is clearly
proven the punishment is none too
severe, but IN case of rape where there
is bat the one solitary witness, who is
to determine wheeler the testimony is
true or Use the life of 30 man is
safe if some disappointed, revengeiul
woman should take u notion ~ charge
him with n criminal act and back it mp
with her unsupported testimony. These

Mr.. Rodney said he knew little about
e the matter, but he thought that it was


Il duty of Council to its members and
their constituents to push the investga
ton and not let the matter rest where
1t Is. He added that the name of the
9 street commissioner and other officials
, had been connected with ruuOrs of
f scandal and malteasance in Office ever
, since he had been in Council and
, thought it was high time they were set


u: rest


Mr.. Bailey then moved to amend Mr..
Carmchael's motion by adding the To-


towing.


, Resolved, That the report te referred
back to the committee with directions
, to hold their sessions in public az far as


possible take the testimony of witnesses


under oath, and to investigate all char


gts that may be brought against the


street commissioners for malteasence in


Office.


Mr.. Sharrley then vacated the chair


and Mr.. Mention took his place.


Mr.. Carmichael said that Gardner had


refused to give any testimony unless


the committees were qualified under


oath, 'Ga-dner is backed up by the


press. On"" paper at least, which had


called Gardner all kinds of bad names


mp TO the time Of making his charges


against Lynch had now taken him un-
der its care, and is making political
capital ont Of the investigation.


The speaker then sent to the clerks
desk and had read u portion Of an edi-
torial which appeared in the kErrBLI-
cas- yesterday under the head ""a
Change Needed""


Mr. Bailey said he had no political
aim in demand'nga a rigid investigation
and said he didn't and had never
seen, nor bad any communication with
Gar,iLer.


Mr.. Rodney also spoke to the same
effect


Merris Taylor said he was sorry the





closed doors, and thought the attempt
ed investigation farce. He was will
ing, however, to accept the majority re-
port.


President Sharpiey said he was not
in favor Of adopting the report of the
majority; that Council could not afford
to let tho matt er drop. They must in
veStigate the case, and il Mr.. Lynch |
is proven guilty, let him fall, but it not |
guilty let him be vindicated before the
public. The gentleman had no conf
dence in the evidence ofa mau who had |
to be sworn to tell the the truth, and il |
he could not tell it without being put
under the sancitity otan oath, that man
would not hesitate to perjure himself if
he could advance his own interests by
so doing. AS for Mr.. Gardner the speak.
er would be very 10th to accept his te,-
timony, sworn or unsworn, unless it
was well supported. Tie Street com
missioner is the creature of Council
and to Council he is responsible for his
acts.


During the delivery of these remarks
Mr.. Lynch was standing outside Of the
railing, in the rear of Mr. Sharpley and
betrayed his agitation by the nervous
twitchings Of his face.


Colonel Il. II. Taylor thought Mr..
Bailey's resolution WAS little ""too
steep in allowing the committee to in .
vestigate all charges against the street
commissioner. ltis not the rule to in
dict man on general charges, he said
MAKE the charges specific and try the
man fairly urged the speaker. Colonel ,
Taylor concluded his remarks by an al !
fusion to the editorial in yester,ay'1 ,
He said: This is a ll't.
paper to teach any one morality. ~ {
II nice newspaper that allows one ts $
editors to come to ""A city official a., t. {

was a percrptible ir among the mem. :

bitter speech, some one commenced to

 Terrible saooting Adray.

 HASEwELL. KANSAS, September 2S.- 4 terrible shootiIg 2 affray occurred just at noon to-day. The fracas began at a dance house. After several shots, three cowboys, Bill Mill, Allison Carter and Al. Chaplain came out with mounted horses and rode up the street firing their pistols to the right and left promiscu- ously. They rode down the street agaiu on the south side of the walk firing into the doors and windows. When nearing the west end of the town Mayor \. l.. Hughes opened fire with a shotgun. Chaplain was shot in the face, but rode on until Mills horse was killed and Mills seriously wouded in the back. Carter and Chaplain then turned back and con tinued shooting at Hughes and the crowd. Miss Golfer, who was passing, was shot in the forehead and instantly killed. Chaplain then took Mills on his horse and the trio left for the territory. Mills was SO badly wounded that he was left on the prairie just across the line. \ posse of citizens followed Chaplain and Carter and captured them several miles down in the territory after a stub born resistence.

 The Star Route Frards.

 WAsIINGTOy, October The Star route ring is demoraiizcd. They feel that lightning is about to strike them, but don't know just how or where 1t VIII hit Postmaster General James and At- t0rney General NcNeagh have evidence enough, they are satisfied, to convict, and there is to be no delay in the prose cution. This morning a conference was held at the Arlington Hotel between James McVeagh, Geo. Bliss, B. Brewster and others, who represent the prOsecu tiun. Bliss submitted an indictment, which he had carefully drawn, against Brady, Dorsey, McDrew, ex-Chef Clerk French, Salisbury, Gilmore and other Star route contractors and beneficiaries of the ring. Bliss stated that he would pledge his professional reputation on the conviction. James and AlcNeagh approved the action of Bliss, and these indictments will be placed inn ediately in District Attorney COrkhilrs hands for presentment to the Grand Jury. It Is | the intention of the prosecution to ask this Grand Jury to take hold of the case 1 immediately upon meeting next Mon day, but as Corkhill insists upon pre- l senting the Guiteau case first, that will | will have precedence. Several persons | implicated have confessed and given away the operations of the ring. The | prompt and determined stand of the Pres | ident in favor of a vigorous prosecution has demoralized and damaged tie ring leaders, who had kept the weaker silent | by assuring them, if Arthur was Presi- | dent, the whole matter should be i'm ! mediately quashed as soon as 1t was proper after the death of Garfield. Jame: and McVeagh had an interview with th' ! President about the star route matter The President had already declined fol | the time being to accept resignatiUns o | the Cabinet and had requested them tC continue in the discharge of their duties ! just as they would have done lad Presi dent Garfield survived President Arthu assured James and McVeagh that there must be no mistake as to his purpose to wards all persons who had been gulty O ! frauds towards the Government.

The FIVE jurors sworn yesterday were early
in attendance.


The Court was formally opened few min
utes after 10 o'clock, and Immediately after
wards counsel in the case and the brother
and sister Of the prisoner entered.


After the lapse of few minutes Guiteau
was hurried into the Courtroom in the GUS
tody of half dozen policemen and Deputy
Marshal. His handouts were removed and
he shook hands with his sister and brother,
and took the seat reserved for him between
them and his counsel.


Scoville then s ibmitted al affidavit, and
made application for an order for an addi-
tional number of witnesses, which order was
made by the Court.


The additional panel of seventy-fve, sum-
moned last evening, was then called, most Of
the persons responding when called.


Guiteau manifested less nervousness and
excitement than yesterday, although in his
whispered conversation with his brother he
was quite demonstrative and earnest in his
manner.





first juror called. His answers showed him
to be not disqualified from service, but the de-
fense challenged him peremptorily, being the
fourth Eoeremptory challenge.


The next was man named Lynch, who
had decided opinion that Guitesu ought to
be hanged or burned. He was Of course ex-
cused, as was also the next, named Bailey,
who declared his belief that Guiteau was
crazy.


The next was colored man, remarkable
for frilled shirt front and dramatic post
ure and manner, who related the history cf
his past life, and then was pereuptorily chsl-
lengeo by the defense.


In fact, it is understood that Guiteu is re-
solved not to have colored man on the jury.


The next was an Irishman named Michael
Sheshan, with very pronounced brogue. who
had no opinion on the subject OF Guiteau's
crime, except that he thought the man out of
his head. He was sworn in as the sixth juror.


William Talbot, an iron-worker, having
answered all questions to the satisfaction OF
the defense, saying he had never bothered his
head On the question OF Guiteau's guilt, was
challenged peremptorily by the prosecution.


Several others in succession were excused
on their statements that they had firm end
decided opinions. One believed that Guiteau
ought to be hanged, and another would re-
auire convincing medical testimony to change
his opinion.


A long-faced young colored man named
Foster declared that he was perfectly free
from any prejudices in the matter, but he had
mentioned the murder OF Garfield tc several
parties as quite a serious accident. He was
challenged -peremptorily by the defense.


Samuel T. Hobbs, a native OF Maryland,
plasterer by occupation, was sworn as the
seventh juror.


G. w. Gates, young machinist, native
of Washington, was sworn as the eighth
juror.


After that, for about an hour, every man
called confessed that he had formed firm
or decided or unalterable opinion on the
question Of the prisoners guilt. and was ex-
cused.


There was one exception in the person of
celored man named Ralph Worneley, plas-
terer by occupation, who thought he could
render fair verdict, and said he had not read
more about the case than he did in ordinary
cases of that kind. He did not believe every
thing he read in the newspapers, bee luse they
had published things about himself that were
not true. He could not say whether the
President was shot by the prisoner until lie
would hear the testimony. Of course if an in
sane man did the shooting, he would be as
guilty as anybody else. The crazy part of
the business was something else. No sensible
man could have done such thing.


After consultation between council, the
prisoner and his brother, Scoville said the de-
Tense would accspt the juror, and so Worms.
ley was sworn as the ninth juror.


The list of seyenty-fve talesmen having
been exhausted, the Marshal was ordered 10
summon another list of sevsnty-iYe for to-
morrow. and theiCourt adjourned.

novel feature of this boat is the submerged
gun, which discharges a torpedo with un-
erring certainty through the water 400
feet in three seconds, with twelve pounds
of powder. Yesterdays experiment was
pronounced success by al who witnessed 1t.
1t was the sd time the gun has fred the pro-
jectile, and ct no time since the boat has
been put in working order has it failed with
the same charge to throw dummy torpedo

French officers were especially inter
estsd in the experiment, and though
they at first pronounced it an impossibility
to operate gun constructed on such princi-
pies and with submerged muZzie, success

the theory had proved correct and astonish-
ment was depicted in every line of their
countenances when they saw the projectile
rise to the surface beyond the target after
having traVersed the distance from the muz-

OF the unfortunate man, and asked il
he Knew anything about how Lewis
camo to be killed. In q faltering
voice, he said no. The wife WAS
then sent for, but she, in cool and
Indifferent manner, refused to go
and see the body of her late husband.


It was not long ere q large crowd
had collected near tha place whore
the body was found. Neither did
much time elapse before rope was
brought, the presence of which had a
very depressing effect ON Jennings.
Jennings was accused of committing
the foul deed, but denied it strenu-
.ously..


Soon one of the crowd pulled off
his cont and boots and with one end
of the rope In his teeth commenced
to ascend tree closely. Jennings
knew what that meant and broke
down. Being assured that if he
would confess his crime, he would be
Prosected, he owned up that he had
killed Lewis with club on 'Satnr-
day morning while he WAS digging
some potatoes for breakfast and that
he had dragged the body to the place
where it WINS found.


Mrs. Lewis being acquainted witt
the fact that Jennings had owned up,
confessed that she also was q party
to the terrible crime. During his
stay with the family at Canon City
he had been crimiaally intimate with
Mrs. Lewis, and, thut while there,
the woman aud her paramour laid
plans for tho disposal ofthe husband.
They induced tie husband to dis
pose Of what little property he had
at Canon City and remove to New
Mexico, where they thought the sur
roundipgs would be favorable to
their heillsh plot and find justice
asleep.


Both the woman and her paramour
were taken before Justice Harris and
an examination had.


He was committed to Jail to await
the action of the grand jury, ,she being
held under bond i'll the sum of 81, 900.


The sheriff. Nose Blanchard, had
considerable difficulty in keeping the
excited crowd from lynching the
murderer, but he called some specials
to his assistance and told the crowd
that Judge Lynch had ceased to hold
forth tlrre aud that heuccforth the
law must deal with criminals.


TlIe-sleriff Succeeded in getting the
P'aSOhSA "" Via y0i.


Mrs. Lewis, on her way to the ius-
tice's Office threatened to kill the
sheriff. An investigation proved
that she had pistol hidden away in
her dress. She is described as good
looking woman about thirty-five
years of age.


The murdered man was well
thought OF in the community and
seems TO have been an honest and an
industrious citizen.


The children. the oldest of which is

er's crime and refuse to recognize
her.

 The murderer now states that he knows who was in the Weldon Nc Clurg-Hite murder two years ago and old heads planned it and car ried it into execution. He shot Mrs. Terrell on account of an old grudge. The impress sion is that he murdered Mrs. Terrell to pre- vent her confession concerning the Temple tragedy."

 LYNCHBURG, Va, June II. To the Editor of the JOURNAL AND COURIER:

 Tennessee being three times the length of your State, from the west to the eastern ex- tremity, gives ample time and opportunity fer observation. Nashville, Chattanooga and Knoxville are the points of great interest Bristol, the city of division between Tennes- see and Virginia is place of no small note, not as regards it's size but for situation. The south side of the main street is in Tennessee, while the north is in Virginia. Hotels are on each side of the line. There are three denominational colleges and as many churches I had almost neglected to men tion that on the way thither I saw Morris town, which is growing up as point soon to be connected with the system of North Caro- lima railroads, now near completion. I will not pass over the town of Greeneville. Here my attention was turned towards the monu- ment of the late President Johnson. It stands a knoll of prominence in plain sight from the railroad The spot was by himself selected for family lot and pur- chased by him for that purpose. The monu- ment is of white marble, quite elaborate, and capped by the American Eagle. The identi- cal spot where he began business life is still U rods is the house of the Mrs. Williams who endeavored to conceal the rebel General Morgan in the early part of the-war, but in vain. He was discovered and while fleeing through the garden was shot,

 Jonesboro is the oldest town in Tennessee The very place where General Jackson held his court was point of no small interest From Bristol the ride is one of many attrac- tions being on the west side of the Ale ghany range of mountains, and on the east of the Cumberland, the Blue Ridge being in plain view. Numerous are the resorts, the Blue Ridge House being the most beautiful of all directly on the line of the road, although some interested people endeavor to keep you in their own locality. The White Sulphur of Montgomery county may be the most popu- lar on this route. It is easily reached by few miles from Big Tunnel on narrow gauge road. There are accommodations for five or six hundred people. The entire range is full of watering places. There is one with in a few miles claiming to be the highest habitable east of the Rocky Mountains.

 t'Lynchburg."" Have you heard of Lynch burg? I thought had. But to see it! You arrive four-horse omnibus claims you as a guest of the Arlington Hotel. You pass the Lynch and the Norvell Hotel, 8 bus in waiting for each Why four horses, there is no need to inquire. Look at the hills. Such city I nev, dreamed of. Hills and hills upon hills four horses to draw the street cars up; and when up to the highest, to the water reservoir, and to Helbig's Garden, I counted the peaks of forty summits of Alle- ghanies, Cumberland and Blue Mountains in sight. Lynchburg is city about one hun dred years of age, city of hills on either side the river; hills all around; none of them of great circumference, but all of great height all apparently too steep for habita- tion; but tuey are inhabited at least one is crowded with nearly twenty thousand souls. Entering house at the basement you go into small garden from the second or third floor you walk up the hills. Starting from the foot of the street at the river for the court house you will probably be obliged to ascend by flights of stairs. or over rough, untrav eled roads. After passing Church street two or three are graded for travel by carriages. Court street is occupied by the best resi- dences. The water supply comes from one of the hills about one mile distant and one hundred and fifty feet higher. Water is raised by the power of the James river. On this hill is the park, Helbig's Garden, where the four horse street cars take you for five cents in comparison it would be about equal to a ride to the top of East Rock. The Orphan Asylum and grounds were gift from MT. Miller, who olso left fund for it's support The same gentleman gave the waterworks to the city. How did Mir. Miller make his money? In tobacco. Tobacco Is the business of the city. Tobacco is to Lynchburg what cotton is to Augusta and other southern cities. It is brought into the city for sale in the same kind of wagons from all the vicinity, even from forty miles dis tant. The thirty or forty large warehouses are everywhere conspicuous.

 A walk through the market, together with walks and observations made in markets all through the South, fully convinces me that what 1 am so often told is true, viz, ""We can get no better beef; we can get no better mutton"" Why?

Good beef will go when well paid for, and northern hotel keepers know how to get It by paying for it. Eggs seem to be plenty. Chickens abort the size of pigeons are the favorite dish in that line I inquired why they are killed so young.

I didn't wonder at the low price named. Cows and calves exposed for sale in this country are too poor and too young for the table. The whole of the trip since leaving Memphis, or rather the whole face of the country and the good fields of real clover cause northener to wonder why the men are an independent race.

duty of the Virginia Republicans to support the
Lynchburg nominees seems to us plain, ana we
are glad to learn that with few exceptions they
are heartily engaged in the canvass in their be-
half. We respect the honest opinion OF men
who, like General Wickham, think an effort
should have been made to elect straight Ke-
publican ticket. Perhaps they are right, but
that is n matter of the past. The effort was not
made because ""a majority of the party believed it
would fail, and thought that great practical
good could be achieved for the Republicans of
Virginia and the whole South by securing the
success of the Anti Bourbon movement led by
Malone. Now the only question is whether
the BOurbOns shall be given a new lease OF
power and the opportunity for breaking up
the Solid South shall be thrown away by the
action or non-action Of the Republican voters
of Virginia, or whether they shall join the
Liberals who have abandoned the Democratic
party and by so doing win great triumph for
their own principles and rights. There ought
to be no hesitation here. The road to victory
is broad and plain. If the Republicans give
the Lynchburg ticket their IS, 900 votes of last

Gloss of this month. He will remain during
the winter in Washington, and devote him
self to preparing to attend the next National
Convention. His elegant house in the neigh.
borhood of Castle Stewart is nearly com.
pleted. The site is beautiful one, in the
extreme northwest of the most fashionable
portion of the city. The building when com.
pleted will have cost its owner SS0,000. The
material is handsome, dark-red brick,
with fanciful stone carvings The

five thousand dollars probably, will be spent
in its furnishing. When completed, as it
probably will be by January 1st, the resi-
dence will be ore of the centers of fashion
and intellect of the Capital. Mr.. Blaine is

as bold as in politics. One of his greatest
sources Of revenue has been from lucky vent

knowledge of that State, and his intimate
acquaintance with its leading men, have en-.

sums at his disposal as to secure him large
fortune. He is now one Of the leading specu.
lators interested in the coal mines Of West

seemed so feeble, is now upon the mend. His
eye is bright and clear, and the deadly pallor
of his complexion is being replaced by bet

A MURDER CONFESSED.",,"The Deed ssInspired by the Devil''-
Christiana Taylor, the Negress,
Acknowledges killing the Fisher
Children.


WASHINGTON, August II, 1881.


The mystery surrounding the tragedy
at the village of Queenstown, reported
in the Herald of Sunday last, was solv-
ed this afternoon. Christiana Taylor,
an old negro woman who was arrested
for the murder of the little boy and gnl,
aged three and six years respectively, on
the farm of Joseph Fisher, on the Bun
ker Hill road, near this city, on Satur-
day last, confessed to-day that she com-
mitted the deed. She has heretofore
denied all knowledge Of the crime.
This afternoon she sent for Captain Yer.
non, of the police, and Mr.. Archibald
White and 10 them made the following
confession: ~ was going along the
path. 1t was not God Almighty, but it
was the devil that put it in my head TO
kill them. l could not help killing them.
l did it, not with the axe nor the wash
board, bu. with piece of wood, as big
as my arm and about eighteen inches
long. The children were running about
the yard of the house. struck the one
with the long hair first, but l don't know
how many times l hit her. l saw the
axe IN the woodpile after hitting them
with the stick. What killed them for
l don't know the devil got into me so
that could not help doing it. picked
the stick up in the road. l never told
any one about ii but you and Mr.. Arch
While. believe it has worried me
some. have told the truth to you,
white people. l. is the truth from my
heart. threw the stick away down by
the woodpile.""


At the conclusion of the confession
Christlana was removed to the jail. On
the way down she seemed deeply de.
pressed and talked but little. In reply
TO a question by Police Lieutenant
johnson she said:-""I could not help Ii.
hit the girl three times, when the boy
caught me about my legs and screamed,
and then hit him on the head. l do
not know how the Christmas tree came
to be by the side of the dead children


DISAPPEARANCE OF THE WEAPON.


A thorough search was made this after
noon for the stick of wood, bnt no traces
oflt could be obtained. It Is supposed
that If she did use stick as her weapon
tt was used the night of the murder In





the stove all of Saturday night. 1t is
claimed by some, particularly the color
ed people, that the woman is insane, and
the testimony of Rose Taylor, her
daughter, is literally quoted. Rose In
her testimony before the Coroner's Jury
yesterday said:-""M other sometimes has
giddy spells and behaves strangely.
When she came back from Fishers house
Saturday she said, in very excited man
ner, THE Fisher children are dead and
we must leave and directed me to 90
at once for ny nephew, who works for
Mrs. Lynch. Often when she has the
spells she threatens to knock us down
with a siick of wood"" The colored peo-
pie living in the vicinity OF the house
OF Mr.. Fisher have manifested conside
able feeling concerning the murder, and
have conRregated Rightly i'll the neigh
borhood of the police station where
Cbrisfiana and Rose were confined.
While they were not ready to believe
that ChristIana committed The deed, yet
they were anxious that the petpetrator
should be brought to Justice Rose will
be detained as awitness to appear before
the Grand Jury, which meets Septeu-
Der IL. A singular fact in. connection
with this case is that there Ia not liy-
Ing witness to her having committed the
crime. When the Coroner's ry yester-
dsy was ready 10 make up It's verdict the
testimony, although strongly Gil cumstan
tial, was OF such a character that the
verdict had to be worded in the fol wing
language: jury are unable to say
positively by whose hand the deed was
committed, but from the evidence ad-
duced the suspicion points strongly to
Cnnstiana Taylor as the guilty pa ty."""

The Life, Character and Death Of Our Lament


ed President.",,"| II is fifty years since the eyes Of James A.
Garfield opened and looked out for the first


time from the log cabin to the tall forest trees


Of Cuyahoga county, Ohio. Some weeks ago


it occurred to Prof. Copley that if the Nation


makes holiday out of Washington's birth


day, il would not be out of place for the


schools TO celebrate in an appppriate manner


the anniversary OF the birth Of the late Pres
| ideDt. Accordingly it was announced in a
| teachers meeting and arrangements made,


and SO it came TO pass that last Friday, for


about an hour and a half, every school in
! Wichita studied the life of Garfield. Now,
there are sixteen school rooms in Wichita


and il was impossible TO visit all and witness


the exercises which took place in each one.
| We shall give what happened in two or three
| rooms as samples of what took place in eve-
ry school room in the city. To Prof. Copley
himself are we indebted Tor all the other
| facts and details which will be found not on
ly of interest to teachers and scholars, but


we hope to every parent in the city:


At the Fourth ward building every room


was decorated with flags and eyergreens,
some with mottoes and some with wreaths,


and in every room hung picture Of Garfield.


Passing upstairs we came, first, upon a re-
lief map of North America, drawn and mold


ed by Frank Redfield and Arthur Dyer. By


the way, this relief map business is some


thing new for Kansas schools and we believe


Prof Copley brought the idea back with him


from his visit the past summer to the Boston


and Quincy schools.


In the high school room We noticed some
Ohio, by Willie Van Zandt and Eddie Mead,
each one showing Mentor; one Of Washing
ton City, by W lille Oliver, showing where
Garfield was shot, and the White House, and
the prison where Guiteau is confined; one
of New Jersey, by Frank Bidwell, showing
Elberon; and most interesting of all was
ground plan of the Garfield home at Mentor
Fisher, a relative Of the family and a visitor
at the house during the summer of 1880.


Miss Wood, the principal of the high school,
was absent on account of ILLNESS and Prof.
Copley himself had taken her place. The
following is the programme of exercises:


Reading-Garlield's record, Julia Barwise;
essay-Garfe!d and Lincoln, Byrney Slosscr;
poem-After the Burial, Clara Lynch; bio
graphical sketch-Gsrfield, Maria Dimes; po-
em-Memory. Nettie Miles; reading-Reso-
lutions from Wichita, Anna Leichhardt;
song Columbia the Gem Of the Ocean, the
school; poem-Garfield, Mamie Mead; read
ing-Masonic Connection, Willie Oliver;
reading-Why should they Kill my Baby!
Artie Smith the question-and-answer draw
er-contest led by Prof. Copiey; presenta-
ton speech-Mattie Lynch song-Ho! Reap
crs of Life's Harvest, school.


The sketches were well prepared, the one
by Miss Dimes deserving especial mention
for its symmetry and the plain, straightfor-
ward manner in which the story Of Garfields
life was told. The reading by Anna LEIGH
hardt and Mamie Mead was especially good.
But the speech by Matte Lynch, presenting
to the school from the A class an elegantly
framed picture of Garfield, was really clo-
auent and fairly merited the round OF APP |
plause which followed it. The question-and
answer contest was an exciting race among |
the pupils to see who could ask the most |
questions about Garfield which no one else |
could answer. The game was kept up over |
fifteen minutes when Jesse Stone was de-
clared the winner, with Mabel King and
Frank Bidwell tie for the second place.


In Miss Kings room the decoration was
very complete. Pictures of Garfield and Lin
.oln wreathed with eyergreens and surround
ID by festooned flags were at each end oil the
,oom while the blaekboards were covered
With beautiful maps. The best maps were
lrawn by Albert VanZandt, Del, Craddock,
Belle Wells, Libbie Butler and Winnie Good
10. The following is the programme in Miss
Kings room:

zltion ofthe State moved toward the pres
ent coalition with the Roadiusters. 1t is
story ofnarrow and selfish conduct on the
part ofa few who had other uses for n
Republican party in Virginia than the
defeat of Bourbon prescription and in
tolerance, and gives an interesting his
tory Of the straightforward and resolute
policy ofthe party in dealing with craft
and treachery. The fact is that the coali-
tion between the Bourbons and some of
the Straightouts is as obvious as General
Wickham's recent letter advocating the
election of the Bourbon ticket can
make it. Dezendorf has been dragged
along by events into a situation from
which he has felt called upon to publicly
deny his sympathy with Wickham in the
latter's advocacy of the Bourbon ticket,
while Jorgenscn is lost in silence as pro-
found as that maintained by him in 1870
The best and ablest of the Straightouts--
Major Yost-the editor of the Valley Vir-
gjBjdn, says in his paper Of the lst instant


The convention that nominated the ticket
which he proposes to support was practically con-
trolled by ReadJusters. and the platform adopted
is even more obnoxious than that ofthe Readjust-
crs, In that II cndcnvors TO deceive the public by
high-sounding terms about State honor, while II
cmphatically declares against making proper pro.
visions for maintaining that sentiment. Had
high purpose been declared to meet the obliga-
tions of the State as they stand the convention
would have dissolved into two factions and failed
in the nomination of q ticket. To reconcile the
rcpudiating element the putative author Of the
Barbour bill-n measure denounced as unconsu-
tutional by some of the very men whoparticipatcd
as delegates in the convention, and vetoed
by the present Democratic Governor, OF that
wing, because 1t was, in his estimation, uncon-
stitutional-was nominated for lieutenant-gov-
crnor This gentleman has never recanted his
views OF the debt question or OF the bill which
bears his name and only accepted the nomination
because the Conservative Democratic party had
come down, or up, to his standard of the States
duty to her creditors Not only Is Mr.. Barbour
Readjustcr, as to the States debt, of the most cX
trcme type but one OF his favorite theories, as
editor of the Richmond Enquirer, shortly after the
close of the war, was to rcadust private debts in
accordance with the losses sustained by the war.
In fact, the convention that nominated the ticket
which General Wickham announces his intention
to support was controlled by the Rcadiuster ele-
mcnt in II, represented by Mr.. Barbour and DR..
Mofrett, hclattcr whom voted in the Legislature
for the Riddlebergcr bill.


The above shows where Major Yost's
inclinatons He believed in straight
Republican ticket against all comers, but
he sees no reason why Bourbon ticket
should be accepted in lieu of one, ospe-
cially when, as he shows, there is an en-
tire abandonment by the Bourbons of
the rigid debt-paying position which was
in Straightout estimation the only re-
deeming feature of their pretensions.


1t cannot be too often repeated that
the Bourbons of Virginia appeal to the
extreme debt-paying and hard-money
element of the North formoral support for
Governor of Major JOHN w. Daniel, who
delivered an elaborate speech on National
finances on the 18th of August, 1873, at
Lynchburg, in which ne warmly advo-
Gated the following propositions:


First-Abolish national banks.


Second-Abolish the tax on and reuiUe
state banks


Third-Substitut Treasury notes for
national bank currency. ,.....""


Fourth-Nlake greenId,ks receivable
for all debts, public and private (including
interest on the public deJD.


Fifth-Repeal Of resumption act.


p Sixth-Pay all bonds of the United
States in paper instead of coin.


1t is to elevate man of these views
that the Northern Democratic papers ap-
peal to Northern Republicans to beware
of the leaven of reputation.


The Virginia address is valuable as
a record of the Republican party for the
year. The bogus handful, since largely
diminished by dcsertions to the Coalition
camp, went through the motions of APP
pointing state central committee, and
may hope through that to be able to get
into the vestibule of the next National
Convention with set Of Bourbon Repub-
licaE patriots headed by General Wick
ham and certified by the Bourbon candi-
date for Governor to be us virtuous and
chaste Republicans as though they had
never committed political adultery with
him and his party. But they will
find that the prospect of even
that degree of usefulness will not
restore any of their lost political inilu-
ence. There will never be time when
the bogus assistant Bourbons Of Virginia
will be able to dignity any of their kind
with the well-known powers and per-
quisites of contestants in Republican
National Convention. The best way for
them all is to quietly slide back into the
Republican party and obey its decision
in favor of CAMERON, LEWIS, and BLAIR,
always remembering that General Wick
ham has promised that after he has fin
ished serving the Pharaohs this year he
will become a new Moses, to lead out of
bondage those whose bonds he is now
trying to fasten anew.

Let every citizen who can render him information Or assistance come forward and the end of what now looks to be bad and bloody war, with well armed Indians, wil bc of short duration and without casual ities on our part.

tail OF three. A committee OF seven depositors
was appointed to-day to carry on the confer
once. and n compromise will in all probability
be made before long. Mr.. Cosine. one OF tho
heaviest depositors. addressed the crowd last
night and said that IL they lynched Daniord
they would not get ten cents on the dollar but IL
they acted like sensible men they might get
most Of their money.


This is the feeling OF the heavier depositors.
but the men who have little At stake. urged on
by the rough element outside. are anxious to
lynch him. A party OF men came over from
Hunnewell to-day. and rode through the town
armed with revo!vers and Winchesters. For a
time IL looked as though they would take Dan
ford and hang him. but after long expostulati on
by the better element In Caldwell. they re-

the consequences that were sure to follow
the success OF the repudiators in the recent
election. The non-taXpayers, the adven-
turers, the destructives, and the enemies OF
good government thought they were doing
q fine thing when they united under MA
HOMES standard and made common cause
against the payment OF al honest debt, con-
tracted before the civil war, and for every
dollar Of which the State received full value.


This combination succeeded, but, before
a reaction has set in which might easily
have been foreseen. Two large companies
engaged in manufacturing iron and steel ut
Lynchburg are said to have stopped work
because OF doubt as to the future. Consider
able capital from the North is invested in
one of these concerns, attracted there by
natural advantages and by tile prospect OF
good returns. All property has been depre-
eiated by MAHoNE's success. Enterprise Is
arrested. credit is impaired, and immigra-
tion is checked. These are the resources
upon which the prosperity OF Virginia de-
pends, and without which the State must
relapse into a condition like that immedi-
ately following the civil war.


Although the followers of MALONE have
less to lose than the debt payers, they must
suffer In common with the mass of the COM
munty from the evils for which they are
responsible Most Of them are dependent
upon physical labor for their daily bread.

It is understood that the president has decid-
ed to recall Gen. Longstreet, minister to Tur-
key, and appoint him United States marshal for
Georgia. The nomination to the latter place
will probably be sent to the senate in q dav OF
two.


President Garfield has decided not to recall
Gen. Longstreet from Constantinople. The
slate for the federal Offices in Louisiana, which
was presented to the president, and which in
cluded Longstreets recall, has therefore been
changed.


Secretary Blaine has decided not to give let

discriminate letters of introduction are subject
to abuses

The appointment of Thomas M. Nichol to

to begin to cope with the difficulties of this
most trying place.


The United States marshal of Jacksonville,

An associated dispatch says:-A close friend
of Secretary Blaine said that the nomination of
Robertson will not be withdrawn under any
circumstances. While Conkling and Platt dis
like the nomination, the reports of their waging
war against the administration are exaggerated.
Opinion in high official circles is that there will
be no row insi,.e the Republican party.


A close personal friend of Mr. Conkling's
says that neither Gen. Grant nor Senator Conk-

staff duty in Washington and New York, a re-
port that the new secretary of war is about, to
issue an order limiting the time such officers
shall serve in cities, so as to give other officers
equal privileges in performing duties at pre-
ferred posts. 1t is the good fortune of some to
have been permanently on duty there for twelve
years, while officers Of the same department
have been exposed to the hardships of frontier
life 1t is understood that the adjutant general
is of the opinion that such favoritism is sub
versive of military dicipline, and. ought, there
fore, to end without delay.


The Washington air is full of rumors of dis
satisfaction created by appointments. 1t is

would not enter the White house again while
Garfield was president His hatchet was dug
up. and he was after scalps Of course, ac-
cording to another story, Conkling and Platt
have their war paint on, so to speak, and Wayne
MacVeagh is incensed at the nomination of
VIM. E. Chandler, will not be comforted, and
threatens to leave the cabinet in q blaze of fire
if it be confirmed But all these things may
be contradicted next day, and must therefore
be taken with many grains Of allowance.
A few weeks ago William W. Brennan, mem
ber of the New York assembly from Franklin
county and chairman of the ways and means
committee, committed suicide by taking poison.
The evidence gives some great weight to the be-
lief that Mr.. Brennan, who was man of pc
culiar sensitiveness, was wounded in spirit
more deeply than he could bear by the accusa-
ton of Vice President Wheeler, who had been
Brennan's benefactor, that he had been bought

ed overtime for Mr.. Lynch, but he had


paid him out of his own pocket.


Mr.. j Frank Ball, City Auditor, read


q statement, which showed that from


March 23i, 1874, to March lst, 1881, the


sum OF f225. 80 had been paid into the


city treasury, for dirt sold from the

Nathan Jennings sworn. Sometime

dirt. | called on Mr.. Lynch and he re-


fused to let me- have it, rs he said that


he had no right to sell or give it away,
and further that ali the dirt they had
was needed by the city for filling in
streets | felt somewhat offended at
him, as be was a neighbor and |
thought that he might let me have it.
Patrick O'Connor, was next called
and sworn. l am employed on the
street, and l never knew Mr.. Lynch
to sell dirt to any one. Sometime ago,
my son wanted some dirt to fill up his
yard, and asked Mr.. Ly nch to sell it to
him; this he refused to do, but Patrick
Gardner sold him two loads, and came
on the next Saturday for the money.
Patrick Gafdner had the witness re-
called, aud was cross.examining him,
when Patrick O'Conner, Jr., who was
standing outside the railing, commence
ed talking in loud tone of voice, and
Informed Gardner that Ee would not
allow him 10 contradict his father, and
commenced to give q statement about
the dirt, when he was called in and
upon being placed Oh the Aitness
stand, testified that he was the man
that got the dirt. He said that last
Spring having filled up his yard, he
wanted some dirt to top off with, and
went to Mr.. Lynch and askeu him TO
sell him some, which he refused to do.
Shortly after he saw Gardner at work
with his gang, sweeping the street, and
and he asked him about it, and he OF
fered to sell him all he wanted at SO
cents load; thinking the price too
high he only ordered one load, but
Gardner sent him two, and on the en-
suing Saturday called on him for the
and demanded 81 which he re-
fused to pay, as he had only ordered
one load. He was never called on
again for the money, but he stated to
the committee that he was ready at
any time to pay for what he had or.
dered.


Francis Kelley, sworn. Have been
foreman of IA street gang ever since Mr..
Lynch has been in office, and l have
never known him to sell any dirt toany
one. |


On being cross examined he said that |
he never had any orders from Lynch to
sell dirt, and then stated that once
while at work on French street, a man
came to him with a note which he
could not read, and said that Gardner
had sent him, and he allowed the man
TO take a wheelbarrow load Of dirt.


Gardner here interrupted the witness,
md said that he was working on Madi- |
son street, and the order came to him ]
from Lynch, that the dirt was for Mr.. |
Pusey, and that which he had was not
suitable, and he sent the man with the
order to Kelly.


Mr.. Lawrence addressed the commit.
zee and said that Gardner charged that
ne had paid money at different times to
Lynch for dirt, that he had sold by his
orders, but thus far he had failed to
produce any evidence to substantiate
,he charge, and he thought that Gard
ner should be made to prove that he
had paid money to Lynch.

cessity of having Mr.. Pusey summoned

banks of the river up to the lower point of


the Island, where the effect of the gorge was


unmistakeable. Here large masses OF ice

ice separating him from the main land did
not appear this morning to give much en-
couragement. The pack of ice along the
edge of his Island showed his escape to be
a very narrow one


About the first of the excitement, while
crowd was hurrying to the river, near Wet
zel's store, rumbling roar was heard from
the head Of the street. Everything was inky
blackness, the people were in just the mood
for panic, and as the cry rang out 'Here it
comes - scattering occurred in which some
ground and lofty tumbling was witnessed.
One young gentleman struck his toe against
a piece of board frozen in the ground, and
extended himself at full length. This, CON-
bined with the nearing noise, completed the
scare, and, picking himself up, with never a
look to the right or to the left, he vanished in
the blackness of the night, and it is reported
this morning that he has not been seen yet
The crowd, after retreating some distance,
stopped to await further development; the
rumbling came nearer and nearer, and at last,
just as another break was imminent, wagon
rounded the corner drawn by pair Of de-
jected looking cayuses, the driver sitting as
calmly and sleepily on his seat as an old
farmer on his way to town with a load Of
butter and ""aigs.""


The firm of l. G.. Baker & Co. had num-
ber of wagons on the river bank. While the |
excitement was at its height, and wher fears
were entertained that the huge masses Of ice
would be thrown on the banks, and destroy |
everything that chanced to be exposed, two |
Of the clerks, with the sheriff and constable, |
started to get the wagons back. The tongue |
Of one Of them lay near hole which had |
been cut in the ice, and which was about |
two feet deep and level with water, and one
Of the clerks, in attempting to attach q chain
to the tongue, stepped into the hole. John
got out pretty lively, wet to the knees, but
said nothing to the others, who had not seen
it. Then AL. came with an ak to get the
tongue loose, and, stumbling, fell over the
tongue, into the hole, emerging therefrom
with the idea strongly impressed ON his mind
that the water in that particular hole was at
least four feet deep. What became of the
ak report saith not. The sheriff was the
next one who tackled that wagon tongue,
and he went for it with characteristic energy,
but quickly retired with the water running
down his boot legs. The constable, all this
time, had been behind the wagon, prepared
to throw all his weight in the scale when the
pushing part came in, but, finding that things
didn't seem to be working right in front,

about the case of Guiteau in such way as
to indicate the belief that he may escape
justice after all, through some absurd
technicality about the place in which his
victim died. It will be just as well for the
press to declare the undoubted determine
tion of the people in this connection at
once. The death of the assassin is de-
manded imperatively. Nothing whatever
must be allowed to interfere with the
execution of justice upon him. The gen.
eral desi1e is thst the laws should be main
tanned, but if they are to be used for the
defeat of justice in this case the public
will not be bound by them. The death of
Guiteau is determined on. L will be best
for all considerations that he should be
hanged il accordance with the sentence of
Court. But if there is any serious
attempt to save his neck from the gallews
BY using pettifogging quibbles, the re.
spect for law which is so deeply rooted a
sentiment in the American character will
not prevent the nation from favoring the
lynching of the murderer."

 will be lynched or shot through the window

 of his cell. He has for this reason wanted

 iron shutters put over the window, and has

 upon which to suspend the blanket for 8

 screen. The report that an order was issued

 to remove Guiteau to the United States steam ship Passaic is denied, but the Passaic lies

 near the wharf at the navy yard and tug

 with steam up is constantly in the vicinity

 and is evidently kept ready for some emer- gency. Early this forenoon the United States steamer Despatch was ordered

 to get up steam at once. The officers were questioned as to the reason, but replied that it was unknown to them. Many believe that Guiteau, in case of emer- gency, will be placed upon the boat and taken to Fortress Monroe. Others think the Despatch will take the assassin on board and go several miles down the river and drop an- chor out in the stream. It is reported that the strength of the jail has been tested with a view to ascertaining its power to resist an armed mob. One of the rumors was that large gang of roughs from New York, Phila- delphia and Baltimore were en route for this city for the purpose of lynching Gulteau. Telegrams were sent to the railroad officials and police authorities of each city, and the report was not corroborated. Arrangements have been made so that notice will be given by the police to the officials in Washington of any departure of large bodies of men for this city. The general belief is that if such an attempt is made the lynchers will separate in small parties and come by different routes. The jail building is of unusual strength, but any attempt to break into it will be met by military resistance. At o'clock this after noon the jail officials were notified if they needed assistance to call upon the United States marines. The latter are under wait ing orders for any emergency, and no marine is allowed to be absent from the barracks.

 GUTTEAU's APPETITE NOT AFFECTED. Assistant Postmaster General Tyner was met tonight while coming from the White House. He said the@President was better and was hopeful of the best result. All was quiet about the jail this evening. Guiteau remains in the same cell he has occupied the past four weeks, and spends much of his time in writing his biography. He has not worried sufficiently to affect his appetite and affects contentment. He has limited knowl- edge of the Presidents condition, but pro-"

Boynton-''Somewhat At one time this afternoon I did not expect him to live through the night. The indications were very bad indeed. The pulse ran up to 11S and staid at 106 for some time since then. As said before, there has been an improve ment which seems to continue. There is an other thing that looks a little better, and that is that the Presidents mind seems clear CT to-day. We do not usually expect mans mind to improve when he is physically on the downward track""

 AN OFFER OF BLOOD FOR TRANsFUs1oN

 General Swain telegraphed his wife this evening that he had lost no hope since. Col onel Rockwell telegraphed Collector Robert son of New York that the President was very low, but he had not abandoned hope The mails and wires still bring communications of all sorts. One message today was from the national peace conference at Mystic, Ct, con- veying expressions of sympathy and prayer. One correspondent wrote that he was large and healthy and willing to give some of his blood for purposes of transfusion. Dr. Rey- burn was standing by when this conmunica- tion was received. He promised that the offer would be submitted to the surgeons, but did not think transfusion of blood practicable in this case.

 DEEPENING GLOOM AT THE WHITE HOUSE,

 The evening bulletin did not reassure the inmates of the White House, the old cry of holding his own"" proving more and more unsatisfactory. Much comment was caused by the failure to mention the gland in the bulletin, since the physicians have declared the gland to be the most important feature of the case The figures were evidence that there had been no material change in the general condition. The administration of food and enemata is looked upon as a farce, since no nourishment seems to be assimila- ted On the whole the early evening opened gloomily to those outside the sick room, and those inside seem to have few words of en- couragement to offer.

 1.-THE BRIGHTEST FACE OF ALL

 The Cabinet ladies spent the evening at the White House. Mrs. Garfield occasionally en- tered where they were, but spent most of her time in the sick chamber, and; as one of those present expressed it, Mrs. Garfeld's face was the brightest one present"" The Cabinet officers remained in the Cabinet room in con- and were occasionally visited by the doctors and Swain and Rockwell. Swain says he believes the President will re- of the Cabinet is that the hope is slight. The Cabinet left the White House shortly after 10 o'clock with saddened faces. The Attorney General said, ""There is no material change, but he is certainly no worse"" Secretary Kirkwood said, ''It is but 8 shade, but it is on the right side"" Post master General James remarked that matters were still grave and critical ''Can you give us a word of Encouragement ?"" said reporter to Secretary Windom. ''Well,"" he an- swered, ""a very little, just very little; but we have to be content with little bit now"" Secretary Hunt said: Mot much not much; he remains just about the same"" Secretary Lincoln said: 'There's little ground for Secretary Blaine said: ''You will see about all have to say in my despatch to Minister Lowell, which is a little fuller than usual and gives my opinion. I can say, though, that to see the pulse run- hing from no to 13O where the patient is as smaciated and debilitated as the President gives little ground for hope""

 THAT RAY OF HOPE WIDENING.

 Dr. Hamilton, who came out of the White House about the same time as the Cabinet, was asked if the shade of hope to which he had referred earlier in the evening had broadened. 'Just little,"" was the response.

 FEARS AROUSED BY THE ENEMArA.

 The resuming the administration of ene- mata causes widespread comment. The fact that whiskey is used with them is recognized IS an extreme resort. Two were given yes 5erday and two today, the second one just after the evening dressing. It is believed the system cannot long sustain this intensi- lying injection. Among the telegrams re- ,eived to-day are several from eminent cleo sricians offering their services for the recu- oeration of the Presidents vitality by means of the electrical fluid The doctors are of opinion that his present condition would not admit of even comparatively slight shock The streets at this hour (1O o'clock) are as crowded as during the early part of the even ng The throng around the bulletin in front of the White House was hardly dimin- shed. Every person coming out of the White House grounds is eagerly questioned 'or the l4test news and the information is passed from mouth to mouth.

violation of the person Of a young

his victim IN clstcrn. The water
beng too shallow to drown her,
the negro slipped down the chain,
and chucked her head under until
she was drowned. IIo then en-
deavored to climb up the chain to
the mouth of the cistern, but this

was, so to speak, caught in his own

drawn up, and with a rope and a
convenient limb, short worf. was
made with the rapist. All this is
described in language and cxprcs-

treatment of bad cases of disease,"

Lynch says he used his influence in the
party as a menacing club over the heads
of the city officials. Patrick Gardner
controlled more than hunurt,i

for the Democracy when it was a
forlorn hope. He took hold of the
ballot boxes at the Inspectors election
and in the twinkle ofan eye he made A
Democratic majority of 81 come out OF
the box when 1t should have been 81
the other way. Pat was patted upon
the back by the Democracy. He vas
called good fellow. His praise was
heard throughout the Democratic

that he, John Collins and Owen Mona

not consider himself discharged but told
him of something Of the kind of work he
did for the Democratic party-how he
had carried the Third ward when no
others could do it, ard he ietied the
Democrats to turn him ort. A

IN VIRGINIA..",,"Many new furnaces have been built
and large tracts of land aboundlng in


all the materials entering into the max.
iLg of iron have been bought up la
Southwest Virginia and elsewhere by


Eastern capitalists, who have discov-


cred that iron of the best quality can


be made in Virginia at one-third less


cost than in Pennsylvania. The Rich


mond and Allegheny and the Chesa-


peake and Ohio Railroads penetrate


this iron region. Col. John G. Stevens


of New Jersey, in his report ON the


Richmond and Allegheny Railroad,


made in December last, set forth, from


personal observation and investigation,


the advantages existing in the valley


Of the James river for the manufacture


of iron AMI the cost of iron making.


He described the iron belt and the


character of the ores, extending from a


distance Of one hundred miles above


Richmond almost continuously to Will


Hanson. He estimates the cos. of


making one ton of iron at three differ.


ent points along the belt. At RiverA


vile he puts it at 1881, at Lynch-


burg at $13 40, and below Williamson


at $11. .35 /; while from the best informa-


ton he could obtain he places the cost


of making IRON on the Lehigh, Schuyl.


kill and at Pittsburg at $40, $19.50 and


$21.50 per ton, respectively. At an


average of $50 per con, the cost of


manufacture at the latter points would


therefore be $3.50 per ton more than


on the James river. He adds ""This


large difference in the cost Of produc-


ton between Pennsylvania and Vir-


ginia will Of course turn the attention


Of the iron masters of the former State


t. the latter; and it is very possible


that a large part of the increased pro-
duction needed annually will be sup
piled hereafter from points in the
vicinity of James river. OfcOurse this
opinion relates not 80 much to the
present as to the near fuluTe. But the
success of the iron masters in Wythe
county, where there are fourteen fur
naces, now in blast or soon to be put
in operation, which it is estimated will
turn out from wenty to thirty thousand
tons of iron during the present year of
a market value at present prices of
more than q million of dollars, will
tend TO encourage others to enter upon
the manufacture of iron on a larger
scale and backed by q more ample |
capital."

CITY RENTS.",,"If those who took counsel with
one another few nights ago and
resolved not to pay the advance
rent which some house owners are
asking succeed in bringing the land
lords TO terms they will have accom-
plished a good thing for themselves.
Their action is perfectly lawful; no
one can compel them to give any
more than they see lit. The anti
advance party are exceedingly mod
est and moderate in their demands,
however, compared with the foreign
socialistic gang, who declare that all
rent is robbery and that every land
lord ought to be lynched. The
craKy theories of the latter are Of
course not worth considering. An
agitatlsn of this character is spec
tally mischievous in a city like New
York. Houses are the same as
everything else-ths more OF them
we have the cheaper they are. A
large portion of this island has not
yet been built up, and there is an
immense region beyond its limits
which lis being brought nearer and
nearer to us every day by railroad
and other connections. To put
dwelling houses suitable for all
classes on these squire miles of land
would be an advantage to the
whole community; but to do so re
quires capital and good deal of it.
Under such circumstances Is it not
the utmost folly to wage sort OF
war upon capitalists and compel
them to put their money into bonds
or stocks or some other species OF
property that cannot be made the
sport of demagogues and crazy fana-
tics? Agitations like those kill
more frequently than they cure."

 ,n heart).

 I'd The report was circulated this mornin lg that the assassin Guiteau had been taken IS Fortress Monroe on a gunboat to avoid tn .u risk of jail delivery This, however, prove l. to be false. The guard placed about the ja l. and at command was fully sufficient to guar 8. against any surprise. The prisoner slep y well and rose early. He eagerly inquired fo t. the morning papers and upon learning tha n the President was not dead remarked, ""H y will die he must die"" He ate igh r breakfast and sat down in one end of hi e cell without apparently desiring to tall a longer with his guard. All attempts on tht j. part of reporters to see the prisoner are fu s tile, the district attorney having given orders s that no one shall be admitted. The judicia : hearing held last evening is thought to have - developed something in regard to alleged CO l conspirators. The detectives working I up some clue, although without much con 8 fdence. The papers leftsby Guiteau for the press, but which the district attorney re- , fuses to disclose, are said to have some bear , ing on this point.

 The Washington Post says:

 While it is to be regretted, still the conclusion is

 irresistible that conspiracy existed to assassinate

 the President and Guieau of the instruments

 to put into effect The tenor of the letters

 shows that he claimed to be stalwart supporter of

 rant and that wing of the Republican party, and

 that the present political administra-

 tion disrupting the party and the only way to

 check the h""if-breeds was by destroying the Pres-

 dent. While his letters do not the persons

 connected with Guiteau in the damnable plot, still

 their connection is sufficiently strong to lead to

 hope that clews have been given by which can be

 traced the would assassinaors and lead to their | apprehension Chief Brooks of the government

 and the entire detective force of the city

 bending their energies to that end and expect to show | some good result from their labor""

 This idea however, is not shared by any

 other paper, nor indeed by any men of

 prominence who have been heard to express

 an opinion.

If it announced favorable change there could be heard on every side fervent utter ances of thanks. Men and women of all conditions, from the highest to the lowest fSrowded upon the lines marked by the sol ders, who strode silently before the gates TAere was no disorder. None attempted to dislQte the authority of the gate keepers 1 All Amed oppressed with the great sorrow, l and iAone spoke in high key dozen faces were turned towards him deprecatingly. | Hundreds of men neglected all other business | to cling So the iron railings in front of the | White HAnse.

 Secretary Blaine replied thanks of President and Mrs. Garfield for her peated expressions of sympathy and interest. h. condition of the President much improved and his full i.i1''O''' Ai' ~'O-'''' -'''

 Treasurer Gillian, who is an intimate | friend of the President, states that the Presi 1 dent had been warned the day before the | shooting that he was in great danger, but would not believe 1t. Some comment has been caused in police circles by the appear

  detectives. They were asked1 If they were here on business connected with the attempt ed assassination but refused to disclose their mission. The mother of the President having been notified of her sons continued improve ment will remain at Mentor and await fur ther developments.

 The President lies in one of the pleasant est rooms of the White House, what has al ways been known as the southwest chamber, Presidents Lincoln, Johnson, Grant and Hayes occupied it as a sleeping room, as does President Garfield, hence it Is sometimes des- ignated ''the Presidents room' It is of course on the second floor and is entered from a large hall. Adjoining it on the east is the library where the physicians finger and beyond which is the Cabinet room. On the south side are two large windows, and on the west door leading to small dressing room. The bed stands with the head against the partition of this dressing room. The bed stead is of walnut with a birds-eye maple | finish and the other furniture is of the same | style. A large dressing case stands between the windows and washstands opposite the foot of the bed and few chairs are appro priately distributed. The ceilings high | and the walls lined and an elegant chandelier hangs over the foot of the bed. The carpet is a neat figured body Brussels, and the drapery of the room is of light drub silk.

 THE AssAssN-A LADY vIsrroR-THEoRIEs

 ABOUT HIS MENTAL CONDITION.

 WASHINGTON, July 3.-Attorney General hcVeagh has remained firm in his determina- tion that no one but the chief of the secret service department should sec the assassin and hence the jail remains closed to all out siders. During the first hours of his con. fnement he was greatly excited and seemed to fear that he might be lynched, but to day he is taking it more philosophically He has frequently asked the officers what is the news from the White House and they would reply that tho last news they heard from there was worse or better as the-case might be. To this he would make no response except when the answer was better, when he would put a Respondent look, and when the answer was worse he appeared to smile. He has made inquiries of the same character much more frequently this afternoon and the answer has generally been that the President was improving. He has been rather des- pondent He took the usual prison food to- day aud swept up his cell quite well as his fellow prisoners No one has called special ly to see Guiteau up to this time except n lady whose name was not ascertained"

 attempt that morning about o'clock

 to lynch Cal Emory, the murderer, who is confined ill jail at that place. The action of the governor in committing the death sentence of Emory to twenty one years in the penitentiary is geners ally condemed and the attempt above

 mentioned was not wholly unexpected

 here where the details Of the fearful crime with which he IS charged are so

 well known. The public, so far as our information extends, is of one opinion, and that unfavorable to the governor, for his utter disregard of the verdict of courts and juries as evidenced by his wholesale clemency to criminals or every class. Should this continue peo- pie will be forced, in self defence, to take the law into their own hands and such occurrences as was attempted at Dover last Friday night may be ex. pected to become frequent in all parts of the state.

 LATER.-Since the above was put in type the determined band of lynchers, after two intellectual attempts, made the third one and succeeded in their designs. On Monday night about I2 o'clock the jail was forced open and the guards overpowered. One of the lynchers attempted to descend into the cell where Emory was confined, but was beaten back by the prisoner who was rendered frantic with fright. Emory was then shot through the head and a fellow prisoner made to adjust moose about his neck by which he was drawn up through the aperture and taken from the jail and hanged to gallows. It is thought he was more dead than alive when hanged. The lynchers left the body hanging where it remained until the arrival of the coroner which was late Tuesday even ing. The lynchers were from Frank, lin county and came to avenge the death of the woman murdered by Emory."

on Monday evening last there was nearly
full attendance of members. The Pres
ident being absent, Vice-President Muir
ray presided. The report Of the committee
on General Arrangements for the recent
public entertainment was submitted and
adopted. On motion of DIR. Kennedy a
vote of thanks was extended to those who,
though not members of the society, gave
their valued aid at the recent entertain
ment. On motion, the names OF miss ' !.
Lynch, of Mount Pleasant, and Miss May
Emory, of Wilmington, were elected hon

Biggs moved that a committee be ap-
pointed to purchase a piano, and the dis
cussion of that question took up good
part of the evening, the opposition taking
the ground that the purchase of piano
should be deferred. The matter was re-
ferred to a committee, who will report at
the next meeting. 1t was decided that the
meeting, on Monday evening next,should
be the closing one of the season, and that
the fall meetings should begin on the first
Monday in October, by which time, it is
expected a cosy room will be procured for
the future meetings of the society. The
election of officers will take place at the
next meeting, and, on this account, espe-
cially, a full attendance of members is de-
sired. Previous to adjournment, the Ly-

kindness of Geo. e. Dearborn, of Phila-


delphia, a fine Mathushek piano was


placed in the hall for the occasion. The


decorative committee, headed by Mr.. w.


p , Rieys, ssey, made the stage look almost like


a flower-garden. Over the centre of the


stage was suspended graceful arch, bear


ing the inscription, IRVING LYCEUM,


in beautiful gilt Letters. From the ends of


this arch were suspended hanging baskets


filled with sweet flowers, while from the


centre hung little singing bird in its


gilded cage. The decorative committee


are entitled to much credit for the tasteful


manner in which they did the part as


signed them. To Miss Sylvia Wright is


due the credit Of the arrangement of the


graceful inscription upon the arch.


A large and appreciative audience came,


filling nearly every part Of the hall. The
reserved seats having been all eagerly
taken before the doors were opened, many


who came late were unable to procure de-
sirable positions. The entertainment
opened with spirited glee, ""Chiming


Bells"" after which Rev. Mr.. Alexander,


President of the Lyceum, delivered the
opening address in which he referred


briefly to the origin of the society, its OBJ
ject and its ultimate aims. His remarks
were listened to with much interest, and
their reception by the large and intelligent
audience shows that there is much public
interest in the Lyceum felt in this COM
munity. Miss May Emory, skilled mu-
sician, of Wilmington, who kindly vol
unteered to assist the Society, delighted
all with fine instrumental solo, enid
summer Nights Dream"" by Mendels-
sohn, at the conclusion of which she was
enthusiastically applauded. A quartet,
Old Farmer John,' sang by Miss Belle
Pennington, Mrs. R. L. Price, DIR. Ken
edy and Rev. Mr.. Alexander, came next
on the programme, after which Mr.. NJ. B.
Burris delivered ""Aunt Hannah's Views

ing much applause. Miss B. Pennington,
always favorite with Middletown audi
ence, sung a beautiful solo, ""The Wood

received. As a songstress this young
lady never fails to do we'll. ""Searching

Want of space will not per-
init us to give this effort all the praise it is
entitled to. The instrumental duet by
Irving and Martie Walker was exceedingly
well rendered, and received a full mea-
sure Of applause. The speech of Sergeant
Buzfuz, from PickWick Papers, recited by
Mr.. w. Z. Wright, with tableaux repre-
senting Court Scene, was one Of the finest
efforts of the entertainment. In his i'm
personation Of the pettyfogging lawyer,
Mr.. w. was extremely natural and easy
in his manner, and won much applause.
A duet, ""O'er the Hill; Ger the Dale,''
by Miss v. Lynch and Miss S. L. Downs,
was fine musical effort that elected much
praise. Miss Mollie Burris, in appropri-
ate costume and with Miss Sylvia Wright
as 60 Niece Hannah recited the ""Quaker
Widow"" by Bayard Taylor, in a natural,
easy and praiseworthy manner. The COS
tuning was admirable. Miss May Emory,
who possesses a sweet and highly culti-
waited voice, sung beautiful solo, ""She
down the Mountain Side,''
which so pleased the audience that they
insisted on a second appearance, and No
Sir seemed to please them still more.
Next, the bald-headed local editor of the
read an original essay Cin-
tended to be humorous), entitled ""How
Raised the prize Pumpkin, during the
reading of which there was a painful 81
lence, and those who dropped off into
sweet slumber were kindly not disturbed
until the conclusion Of the piece. The
solo by Miss V. Lynch, ""At the Wicket

fails to delight, and on this occasion she
certainly gained new honors. She was
encored and sang Killarney Next in

B. Burris in manner that kept the audi

lady and gentleman who enacted this bit
of pleasantly certainly possess rare dramat-
ic ability. The closing quartet, ""Good

Belle Pennington, DR.. Kennedy and Mr..
w. n. Wilson, was fine effort that has
been warmly praised.


The Lyceum certainly ought to be
pleased with its success in its initial public
entertainment and it will doubtless be
able to do even better next time. The
net receipts were very encouraging. In
conclusion, the local editor wants to say
something about the bouquet he received
at the close Of his effort. 1t was small
bouquet in very large bandbox. The


flowers were sweet and pretty, but he
appreciated the bandbox more. A band

THE COUNTY PRISON.


The county prison, with the excep-
tion OF the vagrant department, is in a
credltSbls condition. Prisoners confn
cd for long periods OF time have as
much opportunity for reouperative ex
erciSe as is consistent with law and the
rules Of the prison, while the restraints
which are necessarily imposed upon
the bad passions and immoral tenden-
ces OF many who are sent there, must
undoubtedly exercise, iu some degree,
a sslutary.iunuence upon them. Va
grahts are becoming by far too numerous
in Jail. Many Of them, from sheer
laziness seek our prisons 10 order to be
taken care OF, without any effort on
their part TO help themselves, unless it
be by petty stealiug. Ii law could |
be enacted TO compel them to work |
out the expense they entail upon the
county, there would doubtless, be few
er of them in prison. II, however,

ces5ary ts provide some means of ven
tilsting the cells allotted to them, for
at present they are in no condition
even for vagrants to remain in any
length of time. The impurity OF the
atmosphere about them reaches up in


to the dwelling of the Sheriff, and is
at times foul enough to invite disease

shOald consider himself a s0lf-enroled


protector OF the chastity OF woman.


For the first time in the judicial his

scented OF a thus far successful attempt


to urest from the hand OF our laws a
hlthy eulprit who had been fairly tried,


souscientiously sdjudged and legally


convicted OF the horrid crime OF rape


upon respectable woRan, living With


in the borders of New Castle county.


Hitherto no attempt had ever been


made thus to abrogate the laws OF our


State, laws upon which the great mind


OF tbe laneuted Clayton is impressed,


and which have received the sanction


and support Of every distinguished


Judge who has administered justice in
Delaware from the adoption Of cur
State constitution TO the present time.


suscsss in this effort will be dangerous


to the peace and order Of the commu-

to supercsds the statutes, which may


no longer be effective in the dispense
ton Of justice within our borders, by
the code of Judge Lynch. THIS cruel
judicial excrssoence, rifs as II is with
: disorder, bloedshed and death, may
) become the foremost arbiter OF out
criminal code, when 1t shall be known
that the barriers of State justies are
broken down by Federal interference

not yet ready TO place the governing
power OF their State in unauthorized

LcoSE MANNER IN WHICH EEGRoES RE6ARL
MARRIAGE.


While in the pursuance of its duties
| the grand jury has observed that there
is a growing tendency on the part OF
' negroes to disregard all the obligation:
of marriage, as defined by law and Gus,
: TEN, and in their habits to resemble
D more nearly the brute creation thar
. human beings. Cases are numerous in


the grand jury room, where parties


under examination admit these habite
and look upon them as matters OF course
with the race. This unlawful and in,
discriminate cohabitation affords sug'
gestiVe theme for moralists, especially
g in view of the fact that these people
q have been endowed with the right to
: exercise unqualified citizenship, and
Q are regarded by many persons as heirs


presumptive Of political power. 1t Ii
Q not the most direct nor safe method ol

MIR. Labouchere recently said in an article
In Truth on the London stage: Actresses
live In world Of their own. They generally
exaggerate every sentiment. Their real life is
tinged with their theatrical life and high
wrought melodrama becomes a second nature
to them Few of them have perfectly sane
notion Of existence; they exist in the feeling
OF the moment. They are generally incapable
OF taking an interest in the ordinary occupa-
tions of their sex; at one moment they are in
the widest spirits, at another in the depths Of
despair, and those with whom they come in
contact are in their eyes alternately either me-
lodramatic villains plotting their destruction,
or those angelic beings that have no existence
out of plays. If they are asked why they love
or they hate, they insist that they are endowed
with peculiar instinct, and this instinct,
which most people would call unreasoning
caprice, they exalt as something far superior to
practical intelligence, and glory in being its
submissive slaves. There are certain auali-
ties which go to make an actress and most of
them go to make lunatic. All actresses are.
of course, not necessarily mad, but if were on |
a Jury empanelled to try an actress for murder |
should approach the inquiry with the feeling |
that nature had probably not been lavish to |
her in that harmony of intellectual powers |
which produces moral responsibility""

How the outside world must pity Arizona and its residents, but imagine We can stand it.

 On Tuesday morning about or 3 o'clock Gen. c. c. Batterman, late of Virginia City, passed from our midst and went to join the innumerable cara van beyond our ken. He has been in Auzona but short time and as super intendent of the Head Center mine During his brief stay, he made him. self exceedingly popular and beloved by many. He had lately built himself a house at the mine, his wife had joined him, and he anticipated a pleasant stay in Tombstone, but it was willed other wise and his kindly heart was stilled for ever. Heart disease was the cause of his sudden death. Yesterday his funeral took place, under the auspices of Cochise lodge No, q, l. O. c. F., which the Gen eral had lately organized and almost their first official act was to bury him. The funeral was the largest l have seen during my residence in Tombstone, and spoke volumes for the popularity of a good man. Hic iacet will be written above him and the great selfish world move on as ever. Such are the uncer- tainties Of tLis life Of ours.

 There was a rumor last evening that .F efa H.v .rRI hn4+F.rs, nOtOristy had been lynched at Benson, but the news was too good to be true and was cOntradicted by the arrival of that worthy here last night in charge of an officer, booked on @ charge of assault to murder, and he now Yeposes calmly in our jail pending investigation.

 Judge w. Earll, of your city, Is still confined to bis room with a broken arm, but the Doctor says he will be around in a few days. His son Fred, we'll known in Tucson, has been visiting him for a few days.

 Nj. Gray returned yesterday from his visit to the scene of the late murder, and reports everything quite. The wild rumor of the vast crowd of determined men going out to avenge the dead men is all bosh. There were eleven men in the party and the object of their trip was to bury the dead-this accomplish ed they returned-had they encountered the murderers 1t Is possible summary vengeance would have been meted out to them, but the idea of doing any thing lawless was ridiculous and the creation of some idle persons fancy.

 Mir. Lang. one of the gentlemen of the party, took seven men for the pur6, of driving in his cattle, as no less 'lCS l- u Der could do the work. Mir. Gray pas0 ed here on his way home, and IS expect ed here to-day; so endeth the first chap ter.

 Our Hook and Ladder boys exercise every little while, and have got SO they can handle the machine very well. News has been received stating the Fire Con- pauy's hose and cart was lying at Ben son, and 1t will soon be here. but unless the water company make more rapid progress in getting the fire plugs in po- sitiOn and water turned on, the hose and cart won't prove Of any very great bene- fit in case we should have another fire,

 The news from the bOnanZas this week Is more encouraging than last by reason of the fact that the water has gone down SD the mills are running ahead as usual and the customary amount of work IS now being pushed ahead, and the ore teams now piOd along freighted with bullion-producing rock.

 THE GRAND CENTRAL SOUTH

 Just now comes to the front with a good strike and consequently claims the most attention. Dr. Gardiner the superin. tendent feels justly elated over the sue. cessiul workings of the past few weeks The south shaft is now down about fifty. five feet and 1t was here the new strike has been made. From the top to the bottom of the shaft the ore vein is din tinct and promises we'll The vein has now widened out to over four feet and the ore theretrOm runs as high as SlJt per ton and lower. The east ledge long looked for, has at last been discovered and sinking commenced thereon. They have a good ledge here also and quartz vein. The knowing ones are elated Oyel ! this latter discovery because 1t demon strates that they are combinations Ot the Grand Central and hence liable to bt very rich. The main working shaft, as well timbered a piece of work, by the way, as one would wish to see, lie: ! about midway between these lodges, anC uiis will develop well when drifts art run and general work commences. Al | the present writing the prospects of thi! property are most flattering and 1 onll | hope that time and development will no ! disappoint the expectations of its fortu nate owners and genial superintendent

Work was commenced Il | April last, immediately after the incor poration. and pushed rapidly ahead. visit to the property shows the shaft nov 1 down 1JG feet, and three shifts at work ! The shaft is near the East Side line, an, l in its descent has cut three lodges, car rying ore ranging from $500 to SlO0 pc ton.

those who worked upon the streets who
never knew of Mr.. Lynch selling any
dirt, or receiving any money for dirt
sold by anybody else. This class of
witnesses could have been prolonged
indefinitely and still not prove the in

that of Patrick Gardner who positively
swears that he sold dirt by orders of
Mr.. Lynch and paid him more than
half the proceeds. 1t is unfortunate
for Mr.. Gardner that he has no corro-
borative testimony to SUPPORT his
sworn allegation. After all it is re-


duced to mere question of veracity


between Mr.. Gardner and Mr.. Lynch,


much of the testimony adduced last
evening being of no account. Both Mr..
Lynch and Mr.. Gardner are honored
and trusted mem bers of tie Democratic
party and as that party only honors
its most trusted members both Lynch
and Gardner have been held in high

the case Of Dockerel, young bully Of
the Grassy creek region. A year and
a half ago he murdered an inottensive
man named Carr, who had rebuked
him for talking slightly about a girl.


His next victim was Brown, for being
instrumental In disclosing the fact of
his first crime. Cliff then hid himself


during the day and amused himself
by riding the horse of a neighbor named
Greer during the night. Greer COM
planned Of this to Cliffs father, and
the next night Greer was called out of
his house by Cliff who informed him
that he was to die Immediately Greer
begged for mercy, but got the first shot,
and killed Cliff instead of being killed.
Public opinion sustained Greer but
Cliffs father resolved to continue the
tend by killing Greer. For six months
Greer kept out of danger by never
leaving his house. At last he ventured
into his corntield, and was shot by
Cliffs father from an ambush. All
these crimes were committed without
the interference of the authorities and
now if the old man Dockerel is punish
ed it will be by lynchers."

M., DeceGter 2S.- The notorious gang Of-Oulldws, com posed of about 9 men, who, under the leadership of Billy, the Kid have for the past six months Overrun Eastern New Mexico, burning and committing ether deeds of Outlawry, was broken up last Saturday morning by the killing of two and caFrufIng Of four others, including the leadFr. The prisoners were lodged in the Las Vegas iail, and threats of lynching them were prevalent,-but the vigilance of the captors, Deputy SbeSf Garrett and others, prevailed. Yesterday afternoon Garrett and the other cap tors boarded the train with the prls- oners for the purpOse'Of taking them tO Santa Fe.. Sheriff Romero remOn- strdjcd against taking Rudabaugh, one of the prisoners, who killed a Las Vegas Deputy Sheriff, to Santa Fe, but to no effect. He then went to the depot with a posse of 35 men and made a formal demand for the prison CTS, but was told that if he wanted the prisoners to come and take them. The DutIAu Lilrn eLtAl DHEl AAGAA NL lAAC NA- zine to cC- he engineer, and the balance oI ue oheIiifs posse crowded about the train platforms, which were also occupied by additional guards pressed into the service by Garrett and nearly all the windows in the cars were used as port-holes for rifles. Somebody suggested Co take the pris- Oners now. Stewart, of Garrett's party. said: 'The instant the first snot is fired we will unloOse every man and arm him."" For a while a fight seemed imminent. Chief En- gincer Robinson appeared and de- manded that the train be allowed to proceed, and the master of transpOr- tgtiOn said if the train was not allowed tO depart he would arm all the railroad men and take it out. Detective J. F. Morley. of the POstOilice Department, jumped into the cab with pair of six-shOOters and told the engineer 10 let her go. A conference had just concluded. X compromise was et- fccted by which 1t was agreed that the Sheriff and two men should gO 10 santa Fe with the party, and if the Governor agreed, tO bring Rudabaugh back 10 Las Vegas.

He is quarantined from anyconnection with the outside world even more effectually than the President is. He gets his meals delivered to him by very mute messenger who under orders returns cast-iron 'I don't know"" to every question put by Guiteau. Five times he has been taken out into the office of the warden of the prison and permitted to narrate the story of his life. This he is perfectly willing and even anxious to | do. When started on his story he keeps on talking until the next meal-time ar rives, and when he goes away to get meal his victim escapes. Thus far he has talked only to those coming from the office of the District-Attorney He has secured no counsel and beyond visit from his relative, MT. Scoville, he has net seen an acquaintance since he was lodged. He has one of the lower interior cells, and despite his profane protests against the deprivation he has not been permitted to read the newspa- pers. A Bible is the only book in the cell and this he is devouring, at times reading on for hours at stretch. He complained to the District-Attorney at the last Evisit of that official to the jail that he was suffering for want of exer- else, and asked that he permitted to have the run of the jail. Colonel Cork hill offered to bring down h1s carriage and give Guiteaua ride on the outskirts of the city, but this offer was quickly declined by the prisoner, who in his cowardly conceit imagines that there is crowd without the jail waiting to make short work of him. He has been very consistent in his statements, as his | fine memory anahles-hina to recall l names, dates and places with readiness, and while he has been allowed to talk his story over nearly half dozen times, has not tripped or deviated in one single instance. All that he has said has been taken down, and he has been led to be- lieve that hls yarn has been set forth to the public, and several times he has asked the keepers whether all the peo- pie were not talking of him! But he got only the regulation ""I don't know !"" from the keepers. -'tF'

 Guiteau has insisted from the start that he himself conceived the idea of shooting President Garfield and that nobody else had any previous knowledge of the act. The more the officers of the District Attorneys office study the man,

 the more they are convinced that he is correct in this statement, since his ego tism would not permit him to share the | glory he thought he was earning with another. He insists, too, that he was inspired to perform the act and that | the inspiration came few days after resignation of Senator Conkling. He has found out that the President is not dead and seems disappointed that the shot was not fatal. He appears lively enough in exchanging the common salutations with the officers, but 1t is ap- parent that he regrets that the Presi- dent has lived so long. He says his trouble is the pain which he has caused, for he desired that the shot should have proved fatal. At first he seemed inclined to the opinion that the first shot he fired l struck the President in the arm and the second one in the back. He is not now so certain, for he remembers that the l first shot was fired horizontally and the President raised his arm, slightly turned and Hooked scared"" He likes to talk of how he would reorganize the Govern | ment and makes up cabinet slate with the greatest readiness and is never so happy as when he IS talking of politics.

 There have been large number of let ters sent to the jail intended for and directed to him, but they are not de- livered to him. A number of postal

 cards contain threats and others have jeering remarks. No steps have yet been taken towards bringing him to trial, and nothing will be done until definite report on the condition and prospects of the President has been received. A guard of soldiers still remains at the | jail, and an extra force of police as we'll. Tn case of the sudden death of the Pres ident, immediate precautions will be taken for the safe keeping of Guiteau, as there is 8 fear that a company of Marylanders and Virginians might apply | lynch law to his case. He is not suffer- ing at all in his new quarters. He eats every meal with avidity, andis gaining flesh under confinement."

At o'clock this

 morning she arose from her bed and made her way to an adjoining room unattended. A single window opens upon the yard from

Leatherwood, Councilmen Alex. Le- vln and Albert Steinfeldt, ex-COun- cilman C. R. Drake, City Attorney Ben. Morgan, Larkin 5. Carr, Jas. Auld, l.. c. Hughes, W. Cole and Chas. Lynch. That the repast was of the best goes without saying, as Mr. Cars reputation as an enter tainer is more than Territorial. The first toast of the evening was The President of the United States"" pro- posed by NIT. Aud, and responded to with patriotic enthusiasm. The other toasts of the evening were as follows: Queen Victoria ""-RespOnded 10 by Jas. Auld. '' The German Nation By Alex. Levin. |"" Mexico By Mayor Carr and Albert Steinfeldt.

 "" Our Mayor By the host. Our ex- Mayor By ex-Mayor Leath- erwood. Tucson By Ben. Morgan. Sc The Press By W. Cole ""Our Lawyers By L. c. Hughes 1.-The Pioneers of Arizona By Larkin W. Carr. ""'Our Merchants By Albert Steinfeldt. The Ladies By Chas. Lynch. |"" Our County Officials D. By c. k. Drake The Mines Of Pima County By Ben. Morgan and c. R. Drake.

 The occasion was noteworthy from the fact that all but two of the persons present are pioneers of Ariz0na-pio- neers who came tU Arizona when the coming was almost the event of life; when the nerve and energy of the strongest type of man was necessary to remain in Arizona. The pioneers seated around Mayor Carr's generous board have all in the past been prom

 inently identified with Pima county's progress, and all did much 10 lay the foundation of what we believe is des- tined to be one of the brightest stars in our nations galaxy. The presence of Larkin W. Carr, brother to the host of the evening, who recently re- turned to Arizona from a somewhat extended absence, Occasioned a rich flow of ""reminiscences from the old timers"" present, and the recollec- tion of ante-railroad days evoked by his presence would furnish the best possible material for history of the Territory. In hls eloquent response to the toast, Tucson"" MT. Morgan re- called the prediction made in his speech a year ago on the occasion of the railroad celebration in thIs city. Those predictions were then consid- cred by many 10 be wildly extraya- agant, but the events of only q twelve month had proven them 10 be far be- low the mark. In responding 10 the toast in his honor, Mayor Carr said that he felt in the fullest sense the importance of the coming year to Tucson, and he would endeavor 10 the fullest degree in his power to prove himself worthy of the honor which it's people had bestowed on him. Ex- Mayor Leatherwood said he recog- nized that new era is upon us. The old pioneers had had their day, but he believed he was not claiming too much for them in saying that they had laid good and strong the founda- tions on which the prosperity of Pima county would be laid. Councilman Stienfeldt gave a brief review of the growth ol Tucson's trade, and gave strong reasons why the future might be expected to bring with it glorious results. L. c. Hughes recalled the fact that one year ago in the columns of his paper he predicted that the bull lion output of Pima county in 1880 would reach the sum of two millions Of dollars. His prediction had been re- ceiyed with marked incredulity, and yet the statistics of the year just end en showed a bullion output of over three millions. He wished to make ahother prediction now-that Pima county in 1881 would give to the world more than twelve millions of dollars in precious and other metals; and he gave the facts on which he based his prophecy. NIT. Aud, in reply to the toast of Queen Victo- ria, '"" thanked the gentlemen present for the hearty manner in which they had responded. He was proud of his native land, and was proud of the lady whom all Britons loved and respected.

Heretofore, under appeals such /
as are now being made, melting
the cOl0rcd laborcfs to regard the .
white planters MS their enemies,
we have realized that reason is
powcrless. We earnestly hope +
that this realization, and the hope.

the ablcst aud best men of our
community. We do not believe
that 1t viii; but will know wheth.
er this hope is baseless after next

ments which we publish.


We urge upon the planters of
the county that they attend and
cooperate in these meetings.
There is cause for Just complaint
mt the apathy displayed by the
land owners in the pending elec.
ton; wherein they are chiefly. of
all classes, interested. They should
not forget the era of reconstruc.

all honest white men against the

came u question of c0ntiscation or
revolution that ii was possible to
organize effective resistance. In
this Ben King movement we see u
repetition of the first step in the
establishment of ,earpct.bag GOV.

OF home material, equally mprin-

On the adoption of the report of the

according TO the resolution offered
some time ago by the gentleman from
the Seventh ward, (Mr. Bodney), all
charges were to be investigated. He did
not know whether the committee sent
for any one but Gardner and q few 9th
ers who worked on the streets, or not,
there were other charges against the
commissioner es Is well known. One OF
the charges is that the commissioner
hauled stone from Stallcup Run sewer
and built wall in front Of his yard. The
charges were preferred by Robert Brown
the contractor. He, (the speaker), also
brought charges, mot directly in Council,
but before q committee, one OF which
was drunkenness, to sach an extent that
the man al times was totally unit for
duty. The committee did not sustain
his charges. Now there were new ones.

would have investigated any charges

Mr.: McMenamin said that the Com

man from tie Eighth ward had Just said


that the committee might cover up the

Why did he not 60 before the commit
tee and make his charges, and not come
IN at this late day. 'ls
Mr. Adams said that 10 sieDing the
raport.he was governed entirely by the
evidence, and the committee could
make no other report.
MI. Moore said that he had refrained
from signing the report until the char
acter Of the man making the charges
had been explained to him, and he then
gave Mr.. Lynch the benefit of the
doubt. i.s.,:.,


Mr.. Rodney said that he could not
vote for the report until he had heard
the evidence.


K. II. Taylor said in order that the
gentleman from the Seventh Ward
might not dodge the question he would
meve to Icy the report over one week.
Merris Taylor said he thought the
matter could be settled tonight. The
committee went to work aud inYesti-
gsted what chsrg.' were properly pre-
sented to them. They did not stop to
listen to blatant charges made by tbt
who did not have the moral courage to

known and can be settled this evening.

The Mayor presented q commuiiica
tion from Col. William Ludlow, saying
that the government was now ready to
go on with the improvements to the
Cbristiana, and asking fol- such charts
and drawings as the city were In pos
session Of. After the letter was read, Mr..
Rodney offered resolution directing
the Engineer Of the Surveying Depart
nient to furnish such maps to the Mayor
that they may be sent to Col. Ludlow.
The resolution was adopted.


Mr.. Paynter stated that some time
ago an analysis had been made of the
Brandywine water, which was found
In q bad condition. The Water Com
mittee did not desire to be held res
sponsible for it. He would therefore
move that Chief Engineer McIntire be
allowed 10 address Council upon the
matter. Adopted.


Chief Engineer McIntire stated that
he had in his possession the result of
two analysis, one by Prof. Leeds, of
Brooklyn, and one from J. 81. j. Bush,
of this city. Both of them showed the
water to be in bad, condition. He
would recommend that the water be
analysed at different points from the
city pump to the limits of the State. -
1t would ast something to do it, and
he did not know how the COMMITTEES or
the Board of Health felt in the matter
but it was due to the citizens that
something should be done. The
Brandywine naturally is pure stream
and this present matter is unnatu-
raj.

lysis of Profs. Iced and Bush be re-

The escape of this man Floyd from the mcritcj punishment for his crime is an outrage on humanity and a travesty of justice.

 The circumstances of the crime are briefly as follows: The victim of the murder was quietly seated in the door of his room, when Floyd, crazad with li- quor, passed along the street. When opposite where Bernard was sitting, he turned, drew hls revolver and shot him dead

 We have Do hesitation in pronOuncing the verdic5 and the sentence ID this case a mockery ot justice. It is certainly a poor guarantee for the safety of human life in this Territory. If crimes Of that character can be committed il this coun- try with such impunity then no mans life is safe. The fact that the victim was old and poor, and had outliyeI his use- fuluess, if he eyer had any, makes no difference with the merits of the case. In fact we do not believe thar the mur- derer had any animosity towards his victim. He simply aimed at humanity and Bernard received the baH and fell dead. It was sl>t-Simed at the secun- ty.s~----ri-d might have been the most prominent citizen of Florence who became the victim. In the person of Bernard the life of every man in that community v assaileI and endangered, and on the grounds of public policy different punishment should have been meted ont.

 An attempt was made by the outraged people Of Florence to lynch the murder CT, and in view Of the results Of the trial it IS almost a matter Of regret that tl.e intention was not carried out.

 There is something radically defective about laws or their administration when such a disparity between the crime and its punishment exists. If the verdict and sentence was all that the law made possible, then the law should be changed If, on the other hand, it is the admins tration os justice that is at fault it is high time that it was changed.

 Human life is or sLould be sacred and 1t needs stronger guarantees than the verdict and sentence in this case give il. 1"

It is broad held and one which needs attention. and no part of it more than the jury system. In its inception the jury system was un- doubtedly protection to human rights, but at present the tendency is to ex- clude all intelligence from iuries and commit the trial of important cases ef- fecting the well being of society to a class too ignorant to read and too unin- telligent to form an opinion. To that condition has the palladium of our liberties"" degenerated. Itopens the door to the grossest abuses, and when wealth and cunning combine, justice is almost powerless. It is impossible to-day any where in this country to secure all intel Egept jury who have not read some thing Of every important occurrence in their locality and formed some kind of an opinion in relation to the case. They must be excluded from a jury and only those who are ignorant and uninformed are considered competent to hear and decide impartially of the evidence. What travesty of justice. what mock cry of common intelligence! That ras- calls are able to escape deserved punish ment by bribery and chicanery is not strange, but it certainly proclaims the marked defect in the system or practice. It is not what Roman jurisprudence made the jury system and not what it should be now. Better the judgment of one intelligent man than panel of either knanes or fools. In the rural dis tricts this defect Is not so noticeable an evil, but in the large cities there is a reg ular vicious and ignorant class whO are professional jurors, and justice has largely become question of money. One of the evils resulting from this is the growing disposition in so-called or derly communities to resort to lynch law rather than give the criminal the chance of escaping in a trial before jury of lis peers. This produces gen eral demoralization, and it is high time confidence is restored in the processes of law. These defects should demand the attention of our jurists and some remedy be provided. Take the case of Guiteau. Of his guilt there can be no question, yet his punishment by due pro cess of law is by no means certain. There is no doubt but what he would be killed if set free, but there should not be any question as to the result of the trial We do not think that tEis defect Is in the principle of trial by a jury, but in the practice which has gr5J's Town i, ii1 os- tensloly to secure an impartial hearing, ol eAciuuIg as far as possible, those

 sno have any knowledge of a case or have formed an opinion. This excludes all but knaves who are willing to claim ignorance, and genuine fools, when the case is important enough to make rigid inspection of the jury. The Guiteau case will be watched with interest, for it will show the evils of the present prac- tce as no other important case has."

 c. J. Dare, a courier, arrived in Pres colt this morning from Flag Stan, bear ing dispatches to Mrs. J. 4. Bryant of the wOunding of her husband at that place on the I7th, while in the discharge of his duties as Deputy Sheriff. An in terview with Mir. Dare eicited the fol- lowing particulars:

 A man from San Bernardino named Miller, alias Grizzly, had threatened the life of railroad contractor King. who swore out a warrant for the arrest Of Nil Ter and placed the same in the hands Oi J. A. Bryant, railroad contractor aud Deputy Sheriff. A man by the name os Holmes, a Deputy |. $. Marshal from Albuquerque, armed with Remington rife, accompanied Mir. Bryant in mak- ing the arrest of Miller. Bryant read the warrant and commanded the &C., cused to surrender his pistol, winch he pulled, shooting Bryant twice, one bal passing through the breast and the other through the abdomen. Holmes, the as- sistant, was posted behind d tree, and like a coward allowed his brother officer to be murdered. The assassin. after mortally wOunding Bryant, took his arms, and then demanded of Holmes bis gun, which the valiant [. $. Marshal threw to him, and begged mercy at Lis hands. Miller, after coming of yictori- Ous, mounted a fine horse and started of into the mountains, waiving his hat at the enraged people of Flag Staff, who followed in hot pursuit. The Deputy Marshal also left 70 keep from being lynched by the citizens, who were right ly incensed at his beastly cowardice. It is thought that Miller will be captured. and 1t is to be hoped that he will never be brought to the county jail for safe keeping. Tie him with a stout piece of hemp is our advice. Mir. Bryant was not dead when the courier left, but he cannot possibly survive. He was an honest law abiding citizen, with an ex- cellent wife, and to be thus ruthlessly shot down while performing his duty seems too bad.

 Flag Staff has a reputation for rowdy- ism equal to that of any place on the and the sooner those blood-in- their-eyes heroes are killed of, the bet ter for the place and the whole country. We repeat if Miller Is captured don't bring him to Prescott."

AZ Proposed Routes.",,"AZ PrOposed Routes.


City Council started out ate O'Clock
yesterday morning, W view che various
routes To the river mentioned In the re-
port OF he special committee presented
on last Thursday night. Seventh street
route was first inspected. .--


AT the jackson d Sharp Companyss
car works Council was met by Mr.. Job
Il. Jackson, who protested with ell his
power against Seventh street being OBJ.
ened through the company's works.
He said the opening oftbe street would
not only interfere seriously with their
car building operations, but would de-
stroy their sbip-buiiding business CON-
pletely, by depriving them Of land now
occupied for the storage Of ship timber.
Ship-timber, 1t Was explained, has 70 be-
scattered over a large ground surface.
TO pile it up would cause great loss and
Inconvenience, as In order 70 procure a
desired piece, workmen might be com,
PEELED TO tear down 1000 feet of other
lumber.


The street, just after 1t enters the
Jackson 81 Sharp Oompany's line, was
measured land found 10 be 12O feet
wide. 1t seemed to be the general i'm.
preston tb al 90 TO 50 feet won Id be am
ply sufficient for tho avenue should this
route be decided upon.


From the ship-yatd the Council pro-
ceeded down the marsh road and across
The meadows, In accordance with the
projected route, to point on the Bran
dywine in line with Foarth street ex-
Tended, where IL Is proposed TO construct
the bridge necessary in this route.


The carriages were next driven over
Eleventh street bridge and down the old
light bousecroad, which, at present, is
the OIL ly means Of communication be-
tween tho city aud the river front, north
of the Christiana. Here about an hour
was spent examining the site Of the pro-
posed wharf on the end Of Fourth street
extended, and looking al the extensive
operations Of tho National Dredging
Company in this vicinity. A tramway
has been constructed extending more
than tho sand feet from the river
bank, by means Of which The mud
brought from Cherry Island nals Is con-
veyed la dump ears aud distributed over
the low ground lying back OF the river
bank. About twenty acres Ale already
filled up nearly level with the bank, and
The work is still gong on. An electric
light is used aud operations are contin-
red steadily, day aud night.


From the river front the party drove
to the residence of Councilman David
X. Smith, OF the Ninth Ward, where
that gentleman threw open the doors of
his spriny house and treated all hands TO
all the rich new milk they could drink.


Having flushed the north routes the
south routes, by way of Christiana Av
enue, were next gone over. Most of the
carriages we're ha ed en the bluff at
the residence IF Lucas Alrich, but Coun
Gilman George Abele drove his wagon
clear over o the river bank, folio we'd by
street Commissioner Lynch aid Coun-
Gilman Townsend, la the formers car
risge. The road from the bluff TO the
river bank 10 far from flushed, bat still 1t
can be driven over with comparative
ease.


Council remained on the south side
for about TWO hours, during which time
the party wss treated to straw berrI Ies, ice
cream, and other eiIeshments by Mr..
Lucas Alrichs. Afterwards, On Invita-
lion OF Capt. Y. B. Cotton, Of the Ma
Iional Dredging Company, brief trip

Council met at the City Hall, in the
evening, but without trausaeting any
business adjourned until Tonight, when

was on. The grievance of the Eight


Ward gentleman is not of long stand
ing. Some time ago when the REPUB


LICAN agitated the matter of cleal


streets, and urged that the Street Com


missioner increase his force, it was as


certained that Mr.. McMenamiE was th,
power behind the throne, and he mus
first consent to such an increase


In fact it was found that Mr.. McMen
amin ruled the Street Commissioner
with rod of iron. Finally the street
cleaning force was increased. Since
then it has leaked out that Street Com
missioner Lynch had mortally offended
Mr.. McMenamin by doing something
he did not want done. The Eighth
ward wrath WAS nursed. On Monday
night Mr.. McMenamin called a caucus
of Democratic counCilmen. The caucus
endorsed Mr.. Lynch. Still the Eighth
ward wrath was nurSed, and so ut COun-
ell last night Mr.. McMenamin, after the
small boy styleuf, f,if-you-won't-do-this.I-
won't.play, resigned from all commit
tees as stated. The action took every
one by surprise.


Col. Taylor was in the chair at the
time. He called Mr., Mention to preside
and took the floor.


Mr.. Blake heartily moved that the
resi- snation be accepted.


Col. Taylor objected. Mr.. McMena-
min was bound to share the duties and
labors of Council, and it would be un-
fair to other members. He hoped the
would not be accepted. 1t
was like the Conkling business. The
Gentleman from the Eighth ward, be-
coming angerei at one committee, re-
,ignS from all.


Mr.. Rodney desired to have an eXpla.
lation from Mr. McMenamin.


This brought Mr. McMenamin to his !
Get. He never speaks loud, and on this
occasion excitement made hiStOne more |
ndistinct All the members crowded |
round him to catch every word. His
grievance was the action of, the caucus
# Democratic members held to consider
he trouble between him and the Street
Commissioner. If Council would not
uStain him rs Chairman of the Street
he wouldn't serve on that or
ny other committee.


At this point Mr.. Blake withdrew his
lot4ou TO accept the resignation.


Merris Taylor moved to lay over two
lonthS, by which time new committees
Ould be formed.


Mr. MClenamin here emphaticallY
eclared that the resignation might be
ccepted at once,as he would have moth
x more to do with the committees.


Mr.. Paynter thought the resignation
lght to be accepted so that the vacancy
luld be filled, because it would not do

 The Democratic ward primaries were held last evening,-always an occasion of great interest in the Democratic camp.

 the Legislature, and Democrats are confident they will have 8 walk over. The battle

 waxed hot this year, as last, over the ques- tion who shall be town registrar, the contest lying between the present town or general registrar of voters William O'Keefe, and Daniel GiIhuly, who was Mir. Keefe's oppo-

 nent last year, developing considerable

 strength and enthusiastic cheering in some of the battle wards.

teen year old daughter Of man
named Stroud, told her father that
as she passed Mexican wood
camp, she was insulted by Mexi-
can boy. Her father raised mob
of a dozen meb, went to the Mexi-
can camp, took the boy, tore off
his shirt and made nine Mexicans,
among whom was the boys father,
take knotted raw hide thongs and
give the boy five blows each. The
father begged off with two blows.
Having accomplished their heliish
purpose they left. The Mexicans
started to Sonora, and when they
got about thirty miles the boy died
and was buried near the line. The
people of Ramsey's Canon are in a
panic for fear the Mexicsns will
come back to retaliate, and have
got up petition asking the Sher-
lff's protection. No arrests have
been made. The girl now denies
the first statement, and says she
merely got the story up for fun.
A Mexican named Pesquiera, who
started for Sonora on Tuesday,
with companions, carrying $1,000
to General Pequeira at Cananop,
about seventy-five miles from here,
was robbed by four men about q
mile out of town.

THE SENATORIAL DEADLOCK 9h


The Senator has got in deadlock over
tbe appointment of Mahone's man,
Strather, to the Lynchburg Postm aster-
ship. The Democrats will filibnster
against It, if it be pressed, until after
The Virginia campaign is ended. 1t is
not likely that it will be pressed, but
President Arthur will be induced to
withdraw the appointment and reapnoi.t
his friend when the Senate adiourns.
This, it III urged, will emphasize his
alliance with Malone and have good
ehect III the present canvass. III he does
not withdraw the nomination the ses-
sion will last for several days yet.


Governor Morgan sent dispatch to
President Arthur to night, comnliment.
ing bin On the appointment Of such a
good man as Judge Folger.
;. The impression prevails here TO night
that George Bliss has privately informed
Arthur that there is no case against tbe
Star route thieves, and that on the sno-

is urging james and MacVeaeh TO re-
main III the Cabinet ard prosecute the
cases, and thus bring them into disorace
by inevitable failure."

Somewhere about July 21st, 1881,
three or four tons of coal were dumped
on the pavement of Mr.. l.. P. Lynch,
our genial Street Commissioner. That
part was all right, as he had a perfect
right tc buy the coal. but when the
man brought the coal, he said be would
charge fifty cents for carrying it in, as
he would have to go through the house
before he got to the cellar. Mr.. Lynch
would not pay it, and so the coal lay
there until he sent two men who have
been regular workers on the streets,
and under the employ of Mr.. Lynch.
to put the coal in! and they worked
half day there. Now, the question
arises, does the city pay these men for
putting coal in the Street Commits
sioners cellar, or does Mr.. Lynch pay
them out Of his private purse? Per-
haps Mr.. Gardner can enlighten us on
the subject. INvEsTIGArOR."

is not correct why hold the investiga-

reporters from the room? Mr. Lynch
should protest against an investigation
with closed doors. He has declared
that he is not guilty Of the charges laid
against him by Patrick Gardiner. If
this is SO he has nothing to fear from an

to-day, the term Of Postmaster Wilson, of
Lynchburg, Va, would have expired, and,
as he would then have served twelve
years, he could not have complained of
persecution or prescription if the Presi-
dent had seen fit to appoint new man.


But the Post-Onice Department had re-
ccived from special agent report that
Wilson had, between quartcr-days, failed
TO keep the Government funds separate
from his own, and, although he settled on
uuarter-day, he had violated the law
meanwhile by the irregularity mentioned,
and it was not his first ohense.


Upon this showing the President nomi-
mated Mr. Strathan to be postmaster of
Lynchburg in place of Wilson, TO be re-
moved for cause. II is understood that
General Malone recommended Mr.. STRAIT
han. His colleague, Senator Johnston,
became the champion of Mr. Wilson, who
is said to have been anxious to retire.


Mr.. Wilson is wounded eX-Union
soldier, and has always been one of the
strictest sect of the Republicans He is
of Northern birth. He is probably a
man of honest and upright intentions,
but violated the law in the respect men,
toned above. No loss came TO the Gov
ernmcnt, but that was because he was
able to make his quarterly settlements
after having treated his own and the pub
lie money as one common fund.


Despite Mr.. Wilson's disnclination tc
make struggle under these circum
stances, the Bourbon Senators, under Sen
ator Johnston's lead, not only objected tc
the confirmation, but Glibustered over it
They demanded TO know the cause. The
official report against Wilson was pro-
duced, and no fact therein was contro
verted Still they bitterly opposed the
change.


If President Arthur had appointed q
good Bourbon Democrat, or an equally
useful Republican assistant Bourbon
Democrat, and if there had been an op
position by General Malone, aided by tho
Republican Senators, we should have
heard no end of complaints on the Demo
cratic side that the Republicans wer,
trying to keep Radical carpet-bag THE
in office. They would have had nc
ground for the last epithet, but the irregu
larity not denied would have furnished
them all the basis they wanted. Afte
the Administration Senators had insisted
upon the confirmation long enough tc
give the Bourbons the necessary amount
of rope with which to hang themselves
politically, the case was allowed to drop
for the reason that the President coulc
suspend Wilson for the remaining weel
of his term without the consent of tn
Senate, and could place the post-ofIice i"

Virginia.",,"NO better Illustration can be de-
sired of these views than that offered
by the State of Virginia. Her CIT
lzens were certainly to be pardoned
tor their enthusiasm, over the York


town pageant. The Revolution was
consunmated upon her soil, and
she has a natural pride in all its
""reminiscences. But what a monu-
ment is that great State to dav of
the scourge of the war-ldeas. Set.
tied early as colony, favorably sit
uated in regard to Climate; and with
varied and boundless resources, SID
is nevertheless poor, incompetent,
and backward in all the elements of
public prosperity. If it be said that
these calamities are due to slavery,
we reply that slavery is only chronic
and subdivided war. Slavery and
war are kindred agencies, grown up
together in common barbarism,
and both are espotisms of violence.
Their one idea is the brute force
control of men--in war for the de-
struetion of life and property, and
II, slavery for better ends. 1t was
the cherishing of ideas eomfi7on to
slavery and war that drew Virginia
with such facility into the vortex OF
domestic war 1t was declining
miIitancy febelling against growing
iudustrialism. How intense was the
barbatic spirit Is seen in the persis-
tence of oUsoi@t- war usages.
Where militant ideas are ascenoai,t,
as in Germany and France, dueling
is habitual And so, at the very
height of the Yorktown celebration,
one of Virginia's ""captains,"" who
had got National reputation as
candidate for an office in the United
States Senate, was principal in two
duels in single day; and when he
returned to Richmond the same
evening, instead of being ""publicly
f1ogped by i1igger;"" as he ought
to have been, he received an sen
thusiastic reception"" Will the
honor of its ""chivalry"" save the
State from the disgrace of repudia-
ton?


Militant ideas being opposed to
business ideas, Virginia prese nts a
case of arrested development. The
worlds benehcent work is mainly
done by private enterprise; Virginia
ideas have not favored this; and so
she has been left behind in the rase
of State development. Legislation
has been invoked to bring out her
splendid resources, but there has
still been wanting that vigor of
private effort which can alone give
effect to Legislative measures. This
is well shown in the history of one
of her great public works. The
project of opening commercial com


munication with the West was early
entertained by sagacious Virgin
ians. The distance Of the Atlantic
from the Ohio River through the
valleys of the James and Kanawha,
which almost connect at their head
waters in the Alleghanies, is shorter
than by any other route. 1t was a
favcrite idea of Washington to open
this communications ,and he strongly
advocated bill, passed by the Vir-
ginia Legislature in 1884, for the
improvement of the James River,
with a view to developing West
ern water communication. This
project was worked at in an ineffec-
tual way for number of years, and
in 1892 the James River and Kama
wha Company was chartered to
construct canal up the James Val
ley, and this was opened between
Rchm ond and Lynchburg in I84o


It was further extended to Buchan-
| an, a distance of one hundred and
| ninety-seven miles from Richmond,
in 1851. Some further work was
begun beyond this point, to secure
an avenue for through Western
trade, but the sections beyond were
not completed. The work as far
as constructed was inadequate, only
very small canal boats being avail
able; and SO, in 1873, Congress was
| urged to assume, enlarge and ex-
tend the work, which, in this era of
developing railroads, it wisely de


clined to do. And then after a
hundred years of State efforts and
the expenditure of ten million dol
lars, the undertaking completely
broke down, and the dilapidated
and useless canal property was Of
fered to anybody gratuitously W ho
would take itand pay its debts.


A couple of years ago a private
company of Northern capitalists
came forward and took the concern
off the hands of the State, and pro


posed to see what could be done
toward carrying oHt the original
plan. They organized the Rich

Company, and, under the stimulus
of intelligent business enterprise,
and without dollar of State aid,
two hundred and fifty miles of solid
road bed, laid on the old tow-p path
as far as it went, with heavy steel
rails and numerous iron bridges,
were constructed through the valley
of the lanes River to its head wa
ters in the Alleghanies in eighteen
months. Seventy miles more will
soon be built, connecting the new
line with the Ohio Central, which

lawyer by name of D. NJ. Smith, living in this

sence of Mr.. and Mrs. J E. Martin, who had
gone on the excursion to New Orleans, to in
yeigle their little daughter Jessie, aged twelve
years, cousin to the young man, to his room
and there ravished her.. Major Butler, wish
ing to use the room for some
purpose, went to the door and tried
to cutter, but failing, his suspicious were ar
reused, and he watched the room and saw the
Young man and the girl come out. To-day he
told Gel. Lincoln, the girls uncle, and upon
an examination the girl confessed everything,
and stated that Smith. had threatened to mur-
der her if she told. Smith, finding that he
was suspected, fed to the woods, where he
was found and captured by indignant citizens.
He is under strong guard, but It is feared he
will be lynched before morning. The parties
are of the best people IN the community."

Of Q 2e0a atuster,",,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.-The execu.
tive session of the Senate to-day occu.
pied nearly six hours, including a
recess Of one hour. The nominations
of Judge Folger, to be Secretary of the
Treasury, the denomination Of Mr..
James, AZ Postmaster. General, the
nomination Mr.. Hatton. to be First
Assistant Postmaster. General, and
several other less Important nomina-
tions, were promptly confirmed: every.
thing was running smoothly, and some
Of the more sanguine Senators express
ed a hope that the Senate would he
ready 10 adjourn to-morr, "" sine die.


This cheerful prospect was suddenly
clouded, however, when q majority OF
the Committee on Post Offices and Post
Roads reported favorably upon the nom.
ination Of Mr.. Statham TO be Postmas-
ter at Lynchburg, Va. Mr.. Statham is
the gentleman whose confirmation Gen.
Rsrly and other patriotic Bourbons are
anxious TO defeat, because he has left
their ranks and allied himself with the
Liberal movement. Senator Maxey, Of
Texas, who is q member Of the Post
Office Committee, presented a minority
report against Mr. Statham, and sup
ported 1t in a vigorous speech. Senator
johnson Of Virginia, Senator Voorhees,
Of Indiana, Senator Bayard and others
spoke on the same side. and argued in
favor OF the retention of the present in
cumbent, who has held the office dozen
years, and whose present term Of office
will expire twelve days hence.


The ouly objection urged against the
appointment Of Mr.. Statham was his
youth, he being, 1t is said, only twenty
three or twenty four years old. II is
understood that Mr.. BayArd is the Sem
ator who thinks MIR. Statham too
young to be a postmaster In the
course of The discussion Senator Ferry
caused to he read u report of Colonel
Parker, Chief Post Office Inspector, ac-
cording to which il Is understood that
the res ,ut Postmaster at Lynchhurg
was tuuni to be short III his accounts
las, spring some 81 5000 He made ths
amount good, however, and IL consider.
~ ion OF his services as a Union soldier,
President Garfield decided to give him
another trial


In september last, an examination
of the Office by an Inspector of the Post
Office Department showed that the
Postmaster was again short over 5000,
On the 3rd inst. this amount was made
good, but the Pos,ma@ters sureties
were informed by the Department tnat
the Postmaster was delinquent aud
that they would be held responsible
tor th"" funds Of the office LItli further
arrangcmtnts could be made.


In the face of this Official record. it
is said. that Senators Bayard, Voorhees,,
johnson, MaXey and others persisted in
defending the Postmaster against the
accusation that he had been in default,
and they, AZ well as all the other Dem
ocratic Senators, expressed de.ermi-
nation TO oppose to tue last the contir-
nation of the man whom President
Arthur has nominated as his successor,"

Mr.. McMenamin sent up 10 the clerks
desk copy Of last Fridays Euery Eoe,,-
ing, and had read Nn article rejecting
upon his management Of the Street De-
partment, and also his difficulties with
Street Commissioner Lynch.


M. McMenamin was given permission
to make q personal explanation. BE said
that he bad managed the department to
the best interest Of the citizens, and he
felt that the tax payers would sustain
him. he referred is no unmeasured
terms to Street Commissioner Lynch,
said that official had frequently abused
him, and he furthermore, said that all
the charges that had been brought
against Mr. Lynch, were true, and he
had the proofs.


He continued his remarks at some
length, aud closed by saying that some
time soon he would present to Council q
schedule of work done under bis former
administration, and who was cause of It,,
He also said that 1t had been charged that
he had qharreled with the members OF
the Committee.


He appealed to Messrs. Townsend,
Smith, aud Robinson, as to whether he
had or moi, and those gentlemen one and
all said there had never been any
quarrels among them.


MIR. Carmichaell introduced an ordin-
ance dividing the city Into nine police
districts, and making four police for each
district.


Mr.. Townsend introduced two ordi-
nances for the relief of Jacob Pusey,

purchases of twenty-one undeveloped silver
mines in New Mexico. This association en-
ployed a man by the name of Gillette to de-
yeloo the mines Gillette is the man who,
under Mackay, brought out the great Com
stock lode. Two weeks ago Gillette wrote a
letter to this city detailing such wonderful
results from the developments OF one especial
mine and promises of others as to throw the
association into a perfect panic of JOY.
Bonanza Mackay was in the city at
| the time, and he was consulted about
Gillette's report, and said it could be relied
upon to the uttermost. Upon this the whole
party took with them some $4,000 to facili-
tate the discoveries made, and set out for the
field of fortune. The one mine especially re-
ported upon by Gillette is alleged to be richer
than the famous Comstock. Some parts of
the vein exposed nearly pure silver, one ton
assaying as high as $4,000. This extra
ordinary prize in the lottery of mine-drawing
has set the whole town to talking. The day
before yesterday Colonel Ingersoll sent a
characteristic dispatch declaring his good
fortune. Before he went away he arranged
that if everything was as Gillette had repre-
sented it he would telegraph back the name
of some great infidel. This dispatch, when
it did come, was Bruno, VoltaiIe and Spinoza,
showing that it was three times better than
represented. Since then, later advices say
that three or four others of the twenty-one
mines are very handsome investments Per-
emptory orders have also been telegraphed to
sell none of the stock in any one of these
mines for any money.

No wonder that disrepu- | table divorce lawyers thrive in Kansas City Guiteau, the assassin of the President, stands in constant fear of violence and be- ieves that he could not now appear in pub lie except at the risk of his life. He is very cool in his demands for comfort and liberty within the prison. Tuesday he asked to have the rules modified in his case, and proposed to apply to the acting chief justice of the Supreme Court of the District for modification of the rules. He says he thinks he>h has done nothing which should cali for a vigorous enforcement of the rules. He asked also to be allowed to exercise about the jail at his own convenience to have three daily papers which he named sent to him to be allowed to receive all visitors freely to have his letters mailed and all addressed to him delivered. and to be allowed to receive his meals from outside. He still insists that in shooting the President he was actuated by proper motive, that is, the safety and de- iverance of the Republican party. The AL bany Loao Journal discusses the subject of his insanity in the following interesting way:

 In the history of his life, so far as it has been disclosed, up to the time of his crown ing villainy, there seems to be nothing indi- eating that his intellect was so disordered that he could not tell right from wrong, and was not responsible for the commission of a criminal offense. When the circumstances of the attempted assassination are considered, the matter becomes more doubtful. In favor of his insanity is the apparent absence of ad- equate motive. He has been described a disappointed and angry ofhce-hunter, but there seems no proof that he was either dis appointed or angry. He does not seem to have complained of his failure to get office, at least, he seems not to have expressed any great degree of anger about it, and toward the President he expresses no malice, but only kindness and sympathy, and avows that his deed is intended to bring about change of administration and for the political good of the country. He expresses great sympathy

 

 that he is directed of Heaven, and carrying out the decree of God He commits the act publicly, with calmness and firmness. Add to l this that he did not attempt to escape. Great 1 stress will justly be laid on these latter cir ! cumstances. It was quite possible for him 1 to have done the deed secretly and to have 1 escaped. at least, temporarily. All this, how ever, is not inconsistent with 8 capacity to judge between right and wrong. And here | come in two very significant circumstances. l He made his preparations in the expectation 1 of going to jail, and he evineed fear of being | lynched. This would indicate that he was | conscious that he was committing an act that | was held morally wrong and for which he was | likely to be punished. It is evident from this l recital, that if he had committed the assault l upon an ordinary individual, in revenge for l the seduction of his wife, daughter or sister, | a jury would have no hesitation in finding 1 him as mad as a March hare. But an unpro- | voked assault upon the President is very different thing in the public mind The man | and the deed and the state of mind are the | same, but circumstances alter cases,' in 1 practice."

dwelling houses here of Ii. A. Grisw0ld
and A. q. Hppson were entered by bur-
glars last night, and yaiuables amounting
TO over $1,000 were taken. Two suspl-
cious-l ookinR men boarded asouth bound
tfsin at Comstock's, seven miles distant,
at o'clock. and an order was telegraph

Two officers who attempted to arrest
them there were shot, and 1t IL feared
htat one of the officers is fatally wound
ed. The silverware, jewelry, watches,
etc, stolen, were found on the tram.


The train was crowded with passen-
gers who had no idea who was with them

man and anythiog but coward, as the
result will show. He walked up to one
of the men and deliberately pulled the

ugly wound In the neck. Post quietly
returned the compliment, amid the Wild

the man in the forehead. Meanwhile
his companion had hei from the car and

The companion while running was shot
In the neck with musket by farmer

Both prisoners were taken to Ballston


and lodged In Jail. The property taken
at Whitehall was all recovered and Is
said to be valued at $1,000. A despatch

\ Mob Attempts to Lynch a Mur- derer in the Hands of Sheriff J. P. Gabriel-A Determined and Successful Resistance.",,"On Sunday last rullian, who gave his name as J. H. Floyd, shot and in- sIantly killed American Charley, a well known citizen of Florence. The deed was committed in cold blood, and under such circumstances as to rouse the spirit of summary venge- ance iu the people of that place, and they immediately organized with the intention of lynching the murderer.

 Sheriff J P. Gabriel, who had the prisoner i'll charge, anticipated the movement, and in broad daylight yesterday took Floyd 10 Casa Grande, en route To Tucson, for safe keeping. He was followed by a party of de- termined men from Florence, who took him by surprise and at a disad- vantage, and with leveled guns at his breast demanded of him the prisoner. Without filnching or exhibiting any fear whatever, the brave officer de- lied the crowd and refused 10 comply with their demands, and with sheer superiority of courage kept eight or ten men from accomplishing their purpose. After time he secured other assistance, and the crowd with drew for consultation. All night and until the train from the west reached Casa Grande, Sheriff Gabriel main tained his vigilance, and at last sue ceeded in convincing the crowd of the folly and uselessness of their efforts, just as the train rolled up to the de- pot. The prisoner was quickly trans ferred on board and reached this city in safety this morning and was con- signed to dungeon in the county jail.

 While there would doubtless have been a merited justice in the swift retribution intended by the indignant citizens, yet when an officer of the law has a plain duty to perform he should be aided in its discharge by all good citizens, however repugnant to their feelings such assistance may be, for when wholesome laws are held in contempt the life and property of every citizen is thereby more or less jeopardiZed, and license for other laWlessness tacitly recognized."

On motion, the following rssolu-
tion was adopted and the Secretary
instructed to telegraph 1t to Gen.
Stoneman:


At . mass meeting Of citizens of
Los Angeles county the following
resolution was passed:


Resolved, That General Stone.
man be authorized to urge upon
Congress the making of Wilming.
ton Harbor, California, a port Of

For statistics see memorial.
Mr.. Spence stated that the bust.
ness for which the committee de.
sired the endorsement Of . public
meeting having been completed, It
would be In order to organize b
mass meeting to consider the qusS-
ton Of State division.


A mass meeting was then organ.
lied by the election of e. F.Bpencs
40 Chairman and r. g. Lynch,
Secretary.


In response to q unanimous call,
DR.. Widney made q brief state
ment of the harbor Improvement
at Wilmington from their COM
msncemsnt and Of the endeavors of
the committee to secure larger ap-
propriations from Congress, and in
this connection proceeded to dis
cuss the further purpose for which
the meeting had been called. We
give . synopsis of the speech. He
said: The government commenced
the work of improving Whining
ton Harbor with liberal appropria.
tions. After the first few years,
however, when the work began to
prove q great success. the amounts
appropriated grew rapidly less, un-
I'll now, with the work nearly fn-
ished, with commerce suffering
from the delay, and with the ship
ping Of this, one Of the most Inn.
p0rtAnt points upon the Pacific
Coast, each year endangered for
lack of proper shelter, 1t IL imp0s-
sible to secure enough money to
even carry on the work slowly.
Why. 10 this? For this reason:
At hrst there was no opposition to
the prosecution Of the work. The
southern railroad system had not
yet been constructed. The Ques.
ton of shorter lines and lower
grades to the East, below the snow
line, had not yet attracted atten-
ton. But now that Southern
transconkinental lines are rapidly
approaching completion; it Is dis
covered that the ports Of Southern
California will be able to control
the trade of China and of the Is-
lands and the American coast
south. When this became appsr-
ent San Francisco, which has hith-
erto held this business, became
alarmed. She saw there was dan.
ger Of losing q portion of her trade.
She cannot check the construction
of these new transcontinental lines,
neither can she take away the ad-
vantage which Southern California
has in the easy grades and low
passes over the Sierras and Rocky
Mountains. The only thing left is
for her to try ard check the i'm.
provement OF Southern California
harbors. If she can keep commerce
from utilizing these harbors 1t
must come to her.


We may expect hereafter to
meet this opposition whenever we
ask an appropriation for harbor
improvements. Not open opposi-
ti0n, hut secret. This year We
asked for 100000. We receive
$4,000.


Another point: Our railroads are
to y 0srtain extent dependent upon
the State Legislature. Railroads
have great capital at stake. They
cannot afford to quarrel with Leg
lislatures. The Legislature con-
trolls the railroads. But in this
State San Francisco virtually con-
trolls the Legislature; che. controls
the whole system of railroads and
lcompels them to run In her
instant. Our roads. here in South
rrn California, are so made tribu.
tary only to her. We have all
seen 1t for years. They have
passed through our lands only to

Cured on the 2lst inst. at Orange, texas A gang
of desperado""s, called after their leader the Dolno

an ambush and shot him, so that possibly he will

cyil-doers were captured and shot then another
was taken ana hung; then another and yet another
was arrested and locked up, but the citizens not
satisfied with this took them out, and they too were
put to death. Such, succinctly told is the story of
the Orange, Texas, lynching. Everybody knows

CONCLUSION.


The reception began at o'clock, and con-
tinued until an early hour this morning In
all its details it evinced good management.
All the police arrangements and fittings of
the rooms fer the purposes of the reception
were under the superintendent of q. z.
Dodge and Mr.. Craft, and were so complete
that nothing was felt to be wanting in those
departments. The music OF both orchestras
was the subject of complimentary remark,
while the manner in which the floor commit
tees discharged their duties was unexception-
able


The costumery of the ladies last evening
was in many cases very rich. Full dress
trails, demi.trais and short dresses were
about evenly divided. Comparatively few
low. cut corsages were noticeable. The dem
ocratic character of the occasion was fully
manifested by the variety of costume and the
entire absence of any embarrassment on the
part of the ladies in plain evening and walk
ing costumes when side by side with those in
full dress Of the richest character The as
semblage, indeed, presented an exceedingly
varied view from any of the galleries.
as regards costumery, and the plain black
silk or wooden garbs were quite as
numerous as the brocades, colored silks and
ballroom dresses. The effect was heightened
by the consequent contrasts, while as for the
gentiemen's dress. its uniform black was
agreeably broken by the snowy uniforms of
the many military officers present.


A DUMMY HooDLUM.-There is shooting
gallery on j street which has sportsman
dummy standing in the front door of the
establishment for the purpose of attracting
those who occasionally try their skill in that
direction. Ordinarily this dummy which is
very good and natural one, by the way,
with gun in one hand and holding out bird
in the other, stands motionless, and does not
even turn his head during the day. but yes
terday it got upon bender. and exceeded the
bounds of propriety towards ladies passing
by. The wife of well-known business man
on street was out shopping, and as she
passed she looked up and, mistaking the
dummy for some cheeky, bold fellow standing
there and staring at her, she turned her head

WASHINGTON, Oct. 14.-Now that


Senators have had brief opportunity

OF their comments about the result are
exceedingly queer. Neither party


boasts of an absolute victory. The Re-

the Democrats have the Presidency of
the Senate, won, as it was, by denial

OF the dissatisfied Senators, W no is still
unreconciled, tells his Republican
friends today that they can make a

drawing comfort from the very appar-
ent fact that assassination Las been

the incumbency of Senator Davis, for
they say, There are no Gui ieaus in his
party, and tn. widest Democrat or
Republican crank would never commit

""He is an important part of the Gov

to-day. Gle may he called the Ma

useful direct purpose hi imse!, but he is
in n position to keep the whee. from

W hen the nomination OF Senator Da.

the Democrats to oust him, and thus

however, have no reason to hold their

said he believed he would nominate
Anthony, and soc how the Republicans
would vote. 1t is entirely probable, if
such a nomination is made, but Senator

OF voting in the negative.


On Monday next the Senate will un-

be nominated who was not objection

voting, thus allowing the Republicans

There are also several Republicans who

cases pending before Congress which


have been referred to three sub.commir
tees of the Committee on elections. o
these nineteen contestants, seventeen o


them are Republicans, and only one


Democrat, Anderson, of Maine, agains


Reed. The latter WAS elected by ma


jority of only III in total poll of near


ly $4,000. The other contestant is


Greenbacker from Iowa, who is con


testing Mr.. QUITS seat. The latter was


elected by a majority of only 96 in a


vote of nearly 5000.


OF the seventeen Republican contest


ants, three of them will most assuredly


be awarded their seats at a very early


day. Lynch of Mississippi, the color


ed inan who is contesting Chalmers


seat, will probably be the first admit


ted to his seat as his claim ris so clear
that even Democrats blush to make any
opposition. Chalmers claims to have


been elected by a majority of $500 in a
total vote of IA 565, in district which
gave him two years before through his
peculiar method of shot gun electioner-
ing 49, s3 votes and Lynch u, 1856, beinga
publican majority Of about 900 on a
full vote and fair count, but for three
successive elections Chalmers has
managed by some means or
other to have himself returned
as the member from that dis
trict. The other contestants who are
almost sure to get their seats are Mr.
Lowe of Alabama Greenbacker, and
Mackay of South Carolina, a Republic
can. Mr. Lowe was defeated by
W Wheeler by only 43 majority in total
vote of %, 1000 The election In that dis
trct was the baldest kind ofa farce,
not coming within 5000 votes
Of an election on an honest count of the |
ballots. The case of Mr.. Mackay is a |
peculiar one. He has the most indubit-
able proof of his election by 1900 major
ty but by the most shameless fraud |
md miscounting, his sopponent O'Con-
Tor was returned by an. alleged msior-
ty of nearly 20o0 Since the return,
Mr.. O'Conner died, and at a special
election Mr.. Dibbrell was elected ell
irely by Democratic vote and very
,mall vote at that, the Republicans
md many Democrats refraiDing from
yoting. The cases mentioned will be
more easily solved than the others.
There will be abundant proof of frauds
n other cases, but the majorties of the
Democrats holding certificates Of eiec-
ion, are 100 large for the contestants TO
lope to unseat them. II is none the less
he duty however of the conte stants

ing STORY.",,"Ing story.


1t is not at all likely that Mr.. Nc
Mcnamin, eX-chairman of the Street
Committee and would-be Street Com
missioner, will resign his seat in Coun-
Gil, although such action on his part
would undoubtedly be exceedingly ac-
ceptable to that body. But it is certain
that Louis p. Lynch will hereafter be
Street Commissioner. The inside his
tory of the trouble between Street Com
missioner Lynch and Mr. McMenamin is
interesting, and a better time to relate it
than now could not be selected.


Mr.. McMenamin, when he was
elected to Council in 1879, demanded
through his friends that he be made
Chairman of the Street Committee. The
scandaluuS extravaganza Of the Street
Department when he was in Council
before and held that same position, was
still fresh in the public mind Hence
it was with serious foreOodingS that he
was given the chairmanShip in ques-
ton. The understanding was that he
would redeem himself, that he would by
proDer action recover the confidence Of


the public. that he would, in fact, make
the Street Department as far above the
average in the eyes Of every body in the
time to come, as il was below the aver
aye when he lad been at the head OF
that department before.


! No sooner was Mir. McMcnamin pla-


ccd in his old position than he took the
whole charge of the Street departments


Mr.. Lynch was no longer street Com
missioner ; he was simply Il figure head
The gentleman from the Eighth ward


was Street Commissioner III fact, ana


dictated and directed things, while Mr..


Lynch had to take the blame. For
some unknown reason the chairman OF
the Street Committee conceived a deep
dislike for Mr. Lynch, and the bed of
thai gentleman has not been one OF
roses by any means for long time.
The arrogance of the chairman has be-
come proyerhial among the members OF
Council, and many Of them have in
times past, advised Lynch 10 assert the
authority which was really his, and re-
fuse to submit to Mr.. McMcuamin die
tatiOn.


Finally when the howl was raised
over the dirty streets about Il month
ago, and the fact that Mr. McAlcnamin
and not the Street Commissioner was
to blame for the bad sanitary condition
of our highways, became apparent, Mr..
Lynch was urged to increase the force
Of men despite Mr. McMenanin's false
ly economical O-icrS to the contrary
The matter at length came up III the
Street Committee, and the Street Com
missioner WAS ordered To employ as
many additional men aS llr saw tit.
This he did, and in a little while
the pest breeding districts were thor
oughly cleaned, But here was insubor-
dinaton which to Mr., MtMenamln was
n mortal ottensc. Shortly after this the
Street Commissioner proceeded to use
his own judgdmcut in matters of the
lu this lie was supported
by Messrs. AbeIe, Townsend, Robinson
and Smith, Mr., McMcnuuin alone dis
scnting. Here was more lusub0rdma-
ton, which in Mr.. McManamin' eyes
made the otfruSe duublN terrible.


Now, Mr.. McMenamiu was strongly
in favor of Mr.. Francis MrCloSkcy being
Lynch was elected, and it is believed
by many that be still desires to Sc"" Mr..
McCloskey III that position. Whether
this had anything 10 do with Mr.. Nc
Mcnamiu'S 5 next step is unknown. The
next step' was radical and sur
prisiug one. Il was simply an effort to
have Mr.. Lynch removed from the office
of Street Commissioners Council can
remove the Street Commissioner for
""cauSr' The cause i'll the present i'll
stance was really not allowing Mr., Me
Menamin to be Street Commissioner
of course there were other trumped up
Charges against Mr.. Lynch.


At the caucus of the Democratic Coun-
cilmcn held last Monday night 10 con-
slider the charges, none of the complaints
were proved. They all fell fiat. The
Democratic members considered II Il
good joke and laughed, Mr.. McMcna-
min did not consider il a joke and got
mad. He got So mad that he concluded
to 20 even further than this. He tried
to bulldoze the Street Committee. To
these gentlemen he said, ""If you don't
sign a report prcterring charges against
Lynch, I'll resign from the committee.
This awful threat, so appalling to con-
template and So tar reaching in its eff
feet, had not the desired result. The
charges We're not preferred in Council,
and Mr.. McMcnamin got madder still
and resigned.


This is the whole story in brief. Coun-
Gil is now wanting Mr.. McMenamin to
resign. 1t is not to be expected that he


will do SO, but that he will continue to
hold his seat without doing any Of the


work. 1t may he that the trouble will not


lead to such a desirable thing as Mr..


McMenamin resigning, but it will re-


suit in the Street Department being in
the proper hands, and this the public


regard as something gained.


One little circumstance which hap
pened some time ago, and which was
known in this office ut the time, will


clearly show the animus Of Mr.. Nc
Menamin. Shortly attertaking charge
of the Street Committees affairs he is
sued an order that no Department adj
vcrtising was to be given TO the REPUB
LICAN. This was prompted 10y person
al dislike.


On one occasion an important matter


which was important for the people t'
| know was advertised i'll these columns


as well us those ofthe other city papers
| Mr.. McMenamin objected to the bll


and made strenuous effort to c0mpe
Mr. Lynch to pay it out of his pock

ROBERT WILLIAMS, residing near
Whitmell, Va, quarreled with his wife the
other day, and she complained to a magis-
trate, who issued warrant for his arrest,
appointing Williams own son special con.
stable to execute the warrant. Arriving at
the house, young Williams found the dead
body of his father lying in the yard, the head
nearly severed from the body, and a bloody
AK beside it. Two daughters, missing when
Mrs. Williams returned, have been charged
with the crime, and warrants issued for
their arrest.


The Prefect of Constantine, Algeria,
has received dispatch announcing sixty
one persons burned to death in one day by
forest fires. Many persons were wounded,
and 6s2 dwellings destroyed. The value of
cattle, grain and other articles devOured by
the flames is 100000 francs.


THE poisoning of the O'Leary family
in Cincinnati is ascribed to the eating of
canned mackerel. It is supposed that
acetate of lead or some other salt of lead had
been formed in consequence of the mixture
of lead with tin used in manufacturing the
sheet tin from which the can was made.


A DISPATCH of the 11th in reference
to the recent Missouri train robbery says ::
The names of the parties so far
arrested are: Matt and Creed
Chapman, John Burger, VIM. Murray, An
dy Ryan, John Land, James Wilkerson,
Charles Fisk and William Stillwell.
Posses are coming in and the gen.
eral belief is that the search will be aban-
doned for the present. The prisoners stout
ly maintain their innocence and previous
reports OF confession are contradicted. A
report not authenticated prevails that some
of the missing property had been discovered
in cave near the scene of the robbery.
Land and Wilkerson are supposed to be
leaders of the gang.


THE strike of the cotton-handlers at
New Orleans eliminated in a serious riot on
the 10th. The Mayor, finding his police
force insufficient to quell the disturbance,
has called upon the Governor for troops.


REPORTS have been received of the
robbery Of the village of Bates City, seven
miles east of Blue Cut, the scene of the re-
cent train robbery on the Chicago & Alton
Railroad. Two men, heavily armed and
wearing masks, rode into the town, viii
lage of about $50 inhabitants, and drawing
and firing their weapons began an indis-
criminate pillage of the place. The inhab-
itants, it is said, offered no resistance, and
the robbers after securing their booty re-
tired.


A HEAVY storm visited Danville, Va,
on the 11th. Trees and fences were blown
down, also the Confederate Military Hospi-
tai, injuring several colored people.


Two freight trains on the Little Mia
mi Railroad collided near Cincinnati on the
10th. James Simon, fireman, was killed,
and the locomotive was badly wrecked.


A DISPATCH from Washington says:
Sergeant Mason, of Battery B, I'd Artillery,
relieving the guard at the Jail on the 18th,
shot at Guiteau through the window of his
cell and came near killing him. The ball
grazed his head and was imbedded in the
cell wall. Mason was promptly arrested,
taken to the Arsenal and incarcerated.


AT Hot Springs, Ark, the other day,
a colored boy committed an assault on Mrs. j.
w. Parker, lady nearly seventy years Of
age. He was arrested and lodged in Jail.
Next morning party of masked men re-
paired to the prison with a view of lynching
the culprit. The colored people got the news
aud were hid in the woods. AS the
masked men approached the colored men
fired upon them about one hundred shots.
A few sshots were fired at random by the
white men, who were compelled to with
draw. About one-half of the colored men
broke and ran. One white man was
wounded."

to Shakespeare for trial, which Judge Lynch
proceeded to execute in his own peculiar

A DARK DEED,",,"A DARK DEED.

 The inhabitants of Rhode Island are much disturbed on account of crime committed in Scituate in that State last Monday night and they have good reason for the indigna- tion which they feel for 8 more fendish piece of villainy is not often recorded.

 Dr. William H. Bowen, of Seituate, has been fearless and determined in his opposi- tion to the illegal liquor traffic which has been extensively carried on in his neighber- hood. little over three years ago there was notorious place kept near his resi- dence, which, in a short time, became unen- durable. The doctor went to it's proprietor,

 and in an open and manly way asked him to discontinue the business, stating that, if ne- cessity compelled, he should resort to legal measures. A pledge was received that the nuisance would be stopped, but there was no outward sign of abatement, and stage was reached where it was necessary to enforce the aw petition was signed by over one hundred citizens, requesting the town council to investi- gate the matter. On the strength of the petition writ was issued and the keeper of the place was arrested. About that time Dr. Bowen lost two cattle by poisoning. On the serving of another writ on the liquor seller two car- riages were found cut and damaged to the extent of two or three hundred dollars. A few months after this the spokes of his bug gy were sawed off. The doctor has also re- ceived, from time to time, anonymous letters threatening injury, which were placed under his office door and about the premises. But he has not thus been deterred from efforts to stop illegal rumselling, and one of the rum sellers whom he has helped convict is TOW serving out sentence in the penitentiary

 Dr. Bowen's enemies were not content with poisoning his cattle, damaging his car- riages and threatening him. and last Monday night they took a horrible revenge Dr. Bowen was away from home and the occu- pants of his house were Mrs. Bowen and her four children, her father-in-law and lady visitor. Mrs. Bowen retired quite late and about 12 o'clock awoke with the conscious ness that the building was on fire. She inn mediately awoke the others, and with some difficulty all made their escape It was found that the fire had originated in some combustible substance placed under aportion of the building which was used as wood shed. An alarm was given, but it was im- possible to secure sufficiently speedy and effective assistance, and the entire destruction of the building was accomplished in about three-quarters of an hour. Of it's contents nothing was saved but few articles of fur niture. Underneath Mrs. Bowen's bed room there was more fire than anywhere else, as though it had been the intention of the in- cendiaries to make sure that she should not escape terrible death. When she sprang out of bed the floor of her cham Der was so hot that it burned her feet. The methods adopted seemed to indicate a desire to burn the family with the house. Some half or three-quarters of an hour after wards 8 second alarm was raised, as it was found that another fire had started in the barn. This was subdued before much of any damage had been done, as water and help were now in readiness. The cause of it was immediately apparent. An incendiary ap- paratus had been put there and covered with hay. In the interior of 8 half barrel an al- coholic lamp had been placed partially GOV cred with pieces of board and surrounded with cotton, and near this was a clock-work arrangement so contrived as to run certain length of time and then ignite the lamp and the cotton. The clicking of the mechanism had been heard some time before by 8 person sitting in the doorway, who inquired if the doctor kept clock there. The window of the barn was found open. There were two or three nice carriages in the barn. The incendiary had fastened together the wheels of one of these with wire and blocked those of another with rail, evidently with the pur pose of impeding their removal

 Such crime as this, involving if not contemplating, the possible burning to death of several innocent persons, including women and children, is startling. It gives us 8 glimpse of almost incomprehensible wick edness. If the application of lynch law is ever justifable it would be in the case of the villain or villains who set fire to Dr. Bowen's house. Unfortunately it is not yet known who did it."

and commenced their Investigation by
calling Patrick Gardner IN to give his

insisted that every member of the

no power to administer oaths, but
Patrick said Squire could easily be
procured for this purpose. Mr.. Car

taken an oath as members Of Council

refused 10 open his mouth until his
request was complied with.

way of relieving the people Of his State from the

1t Is natural that the masses of the people of

appearance in public life hehas been the steadfast
friend of the loboring man, and the uncompromis-

With Malone at our head we can win The peo-
pie look TO him In this great crisis. They believe
that his influence will bo excrted to secure Inst
ing peace and harmony 10 our too long cstranged
sections and races. lie is firm in his advocacy for
the protection Of the rights Of the weak whenever
they are threatened by the strong. In word, the
people love Malone, and will follow his lead,

f>cxpress his opinion in regard to his government
both national and local, by means Of the ballot
box free from intimidation. Then, and not till
then, will immigration and capital seek Virginia
to develop her resources. Not till then will white.

 The way to stop lynehipg is to execute the law with prompt and unsparing hand. It is about time that we, in Arkansas, should rise as one man against the crime of lynch law which now disgraces us. The thing which disgraces us just now is not lynch law; but the CRIME THAT IS BEING PENETRATED, AND THE FAILURE OF OUR COURTS TO PUNISH THE CRIMINALS IS disgracing us, and is FORGING us to resort to lynch law: for, you must remember, SELF REPRESENTATION is the first i'm pulse of our nature, and when we find that we cannot rely upon the courts to protect us from assassins and murderers what else are we to do but to use the inherent right, which God has given us, to protect ourselves. It is desperate remedy, but it seems we shall have to choose between it and the wholesale destruc- tlon oi human life by the outlaw. As for myself think that it infn- itely better for society, and far less disgraceful to the State, for the bet ter element in any community to take such criminals as the murdercrs of James, or the assassin who at tempted to take the life of Garfield. and swing them to the nearest limb, than to trifie with Justice under ths pretence of sustaining the majesty of the law, as has been done in the former case, and as will in all proba- bility be done in the latter.

 Rev. Fred D. Power preached g sermon the other Sabbath in Wash. ington City in which he made refer ence to the shooting of the President, and said:

 First of all l would mention a failure to meet the ends of justice by prompt and rigid execution of the law. Let man feel that his forced entrance into the house of another is to be met with speedy punishment, with imprisonment for life, and we will have fewer burglarios than are now recorded. Let aman feel that the mere act pointing a pistol or a gun, or any any other weapon, whether it be loaded or unloaded, at the heart or person of anyone in fun or in earnest, will bo met with heavy fine and imprisonment, and VIC will have fewer men and children shot down through alleged ignorance than at present. Let men feel that human life is sacred thing-sacred above property, above position. above any other influence; for the destruction of which no plea of in sanity. no plea of drunkenness, no plea of wounded honor can justify man. Let men feel that human life is so sacred that the attempt to take it is crime, punishable by impris onment for life, and that the taking of tt will lead to speedy and certain stretching of hemp.

 From thls VIC may see why lynch law is being resorted to. Men of murderous inclinations MUST be made to know that human life is sacred, and that sure and swift pun ishment will follow the taking of it, and if the law as administered by our courts won't impress this fact, there is nothing left but for the peo- pie to do it themselves in self de- fense.

 ""The majesty of the law"" is good phrase, but it does not amount to much If it affords us no protection from the bullet or the knife of the assassin. ""The majesty of the law"" would command more respect from the people, if the Judges on the bench, the attorneys who form a portion of the courts, and the exec. utive officers would cease making it it synonym for subterfuge by which criminals escape the just pun ishment for their crimes. How can people put any hope of protection in the law, when they see it's ADMINS TRATloN BY THE COURTS engineered in such a way ONLY as to inure to the pecuniary benefit of the court officers and lawyers and so as to delay and baffle in every possible way the punishment of criminals, and, finally, when they see Judge, jury and attorneys, join in and sign petitions for pardon and respite, in the few cases where convictions are made?

It strikes down ths possibility of long Imprisonment ol confinement without first a receurs, at law.

 But, in case the accused be guilty then it becomes . matter of interes to the people that he should have th' same speedy hearing-that the law should be as expedite in his punish ment as in the release of the inno cent.

gentlemen were employed By Father Killeen, the
pastor of ST. Mays Roman Catholic Church. to
tend bar on board the barge John Nelson on
Father Rillcen's church excursion to Bicgens
Grove on Thursday. On that day the chief OF po;

James Russell to duty on the La TOurette House
wharf from which The barge-load of excur-

to watch for any breach of the law.
The policeman reported that sixty kegs of lager
beer were taken OH board, and that drinks were
sold while the boat lay at anchor in violation OF
the city ordinance regulating the sale ofiquor. In
accordance with this report three charges were
made out against Councilman Reilly, three against
Joseph Ross, and one each against Bernard Nc
Guire and John Clark. This is regarded IN Bay

been conspicuous in the prosecution Of violations
of the liquor laws There is much excltemen,
among all the residents. Councilman Kelly, who
was one OF the excursionists, and who got black
eye while in New York waters, said:

i. the lynching business ? Last week
the RECORD published the particu-
lars of the breaking open of the Gala
boose by mob and the emasculation
of n prisoner, who was charged with
a nameless offence. This week we
have to chronicle an attempt at hang
ing another tramp On general princi-
piles because he was loafer and a
nuisance. II is said that harmless
dogs learn TO kill sheep by getting a
taste of the blood. Whatever may be
said about the first affair this last at
tempt at iynching is an indication of
a growing spirit of lawlessness that
may lead to serious results if not
checked at once. 1t appears tina,
there was no charge against the last
victim for which he could even be
arrested. To lynch such man or
even to play at lynching under such
circumstances, merely to afford fun
for the boys, is too serious a matter
TO be tolerated in this community.
The laws are quite competent to take
care of all criminals in this county,
and the laws should be respected."

take care, boys, or you may strangle

An Appeal from the Home Rulers.
UNEAsINESS IN THE LEAGUE AT


DUBLIN

Davitt's Arrest Still the Exciting Topic.",,"NEW YORK, Feb. GA London despatch
says that as soon as the Irish members had
been suspended, a meeting OF the party was
held, and after discussion decided to issue
manifesto to the Irish people, asking them to
remain quiet and not to allow themselves to be
forced into a conflict with the armed forces of
the Empire. During the night Mr.. Paruell re-
ceived several communications from Liberal
clubs throughout England condemning the ac-
ton of the Speaker and hoping that the agita-
tion in England against coercion would be car
rled on vigorously.


DUBLIN Feb. 5.-Great uneasiness exists in
the ranks of the Leaguers at Dublin. 1t is ex-
pected that the Government will pounce on all
the officers of the executive, seize the offices at
Dublin and disband the League by proclama-
tions.


In view of the League being forcible dis
solved, great vigor is being thrown into the
work of organization in the Ladies' Irish Ma
women"" was yesterday issued by Anna Par
nell, Clare Stretch, Mamie Lynch and Harriet
Byrne, the four honorary secretaries. The ad-
dress declares that the time has come when all
law will be suspended in Ireland, and when in
all probability the trusted leaders and organiz-
ers of the League will be imprisoned, and calls
upon the women of Ireland to do their duty
while their countrymen do theirs. 1t says
'They do not shrink from danger, and one of
the noblest of them, Michael Davtt, has al
ready been reconsigned to convict's CELL""


The address thus concludes:-""F your
selves into branches of the Ladies' National
Land League. Be ready to give information
of evictions in your districts to collect funds
and apply those which have been intrusted to
you as emergencies may arise. You will prob
ably have to administer money collected in
Europe and America where millions of our
race have been exiled by the inhuman land
laws""


Among the great mass of the Irish people
the arrest OF Mr.. Davitt is condemned as cow
ardly and arbitrary Even his worst enemies
think that the Government has made mis-
take and should at least have brought him to
trial as the conservative Government did. 1t
is generally supposed that his extraordinary
speech at Boris, Tipperary, last Sunday, ex-
hausted the patience of the Government.


LONDON, Feb. 5.-The Times approves of
Davtt's arrests and says Davitt has been an
active agent Of sedition, verging on treason,
and that he is an adventurer acquainted with
the springs and methods of the Fenian con-
spiracy. point had been reached in the
crisis of affairs when it was absolutely incon-
sistent with public safety that the demoraliz-
ing spectacle of triumphant lawlessness, fur
nished by Mr.. Davitt, could longer be tolerat-
ed. 1t is quite impossible that any Govern
ment could shut its eyes to the latest step in
rhe march of disaffectiop. Unless those whose
business it is to watch the movement are much
mistaken, the design which now commends it.
self to the agitation is to transfer the theatre
Of intimidation and violence from Irish to
English soil."

 -Sandtown isn't quite dead yet. A shoot ing affair is reported from there, as follows |: According to report, Mrs. Julia Johnson, daughter of Mayor Hall, has repeatedly threatened to shoot some of the Boinay boys for faneied grievances, and last Saturday night she attempted to carry her threat into execution. As Alexander and August Boinay were coming toward the depot to summon the doctor for their father about g o'clock Saturday night, they were hailed by Julia as they passed her house. Both stopped short, when instantly she fired a revolver, the ball passing through the muscular partof August's left arm. She then ran up stairs and fired again through the window, the bullet this time missing the boys and grazing the cheek caused the disturbance. August returned to the house and Dr. Camp was called Julia was arrested the same night, and placed un der $20O bonds to appear for trial before Justice Bennett next Monday at o'clock. The trial will be interesting, as it is said that Julia claims Alexander Boinay as her lawfully welded husband, and Aleck. is determined tc investigate. She has husband. Jim. John son, living in New Hartford, and if she sub stantiates her claim to Aleck. she mus necessarily expose herself to charge o bigamy.

that, notwithstanding the high
pulse shown by the noon bulletin,
the President had very favora-

pulse was an Indication OF weak
ness resulting from the operation
and from the diminished quantity
of food given him yesterday

last longer than tomorrow.
Already his pulse has fallen six
beats since the noon bulletin and

 The Political! Pot Boiling.

 WASHINGTON, March 23.-The nom- inatlon of Robertson, who male such hard fight agains, Grant and Conk- ling in New York last fall, for eel. lector of the port Of New York, ere ates surprise and considerable com ment. Other nominations today, like Chandler, Merritt and Phelps. had the effect of removing the feeling among some Republicans that the President was yielding 10 the stall warts. The collector of New York can. yield more political power than any other government officer in the State. COGkiing, it Is stated, greatly preferred not tO have this power in the hands of the man who opposed him as strongly as Robertson, but it Is not believed Conkling will oppose his confirmation. The action of the President In dividing the patronage between both factions is regarded as desire to harmOnize the party in New York. Merritt, the present col lector whom Conkling fought SO hard several years ago, goes as consul gen. eral Co London.

 Since the executive session adjourn | ed this afternoon it is rumorvd that ] Conkiing and his friends are very In- ! dlgnant at the nomination e Pnber'- son, and threaten 10 oppose LIs coa- nrmatiOn.

General Taylor was inaugurated on
Monday. March 5th. He was escorted
from Wizards Hotel by an imposing
procession. headed by twelve volunteer
companies. The President-eect rode in
an open carriage. drawn by four gray
horses, and he was joined at the Irving
House by President Polk. who sat at his
right hand. One hundred gentlemen,
residents of the District of Columbia,
formed IL body-guard, and kept the crowd
from pressing around the President 5
carriage. Then came the Rough and
Ready clubs of Washington, George
town, Alexander. and Baltimore. with
banners, badges. and music. while the
students of the jesuits' college brought
up the rear.


The personal appearance of Gen. Tay-
lor, as he read his inaugural address from
a platform erected in front of the eastern
portico of the Capitol. was not imposing.
His figure was somewhat portlv. and his
legs were short his thin, gray hair was
unbrushed: his whiskers were of the mill
tary cut then prescribed his features
were weather-bronzed and care-furrowed,
evident, however, that he was popular
favorite. and when he had concluded
the vociferous cheering OF the assembled
thousands was echoed by the firing of
cannon and the music of the bands.


The inaugural message showed that
General Taylor regarded the Union as
III danger, and that he intended to use
every possible exertion for its prcserva-
ton. Mr.. Calhoun had requested, through
Mr.. Clayton, that nothing should be said
in the inaugural on this subject, which
had prompted the addition of aragraph,
in which tee incoming President declared
that a dissolution of the Union would be
the greatest of calamities, and went on
to say. Whatever dangers may threaten
it, shall stand by it. and maintain it in
its integrity. to the full extent of the
obligations imposed and the power con-
ferred upon me by the constitution


There were three Inauguration balls at
night-one in temporary building an
nexed to the City Hall, one at Mr.. Rives
Jackson Hall. and one at Carusi's saloon.
President Taylor, accompanied by Colo
mel and Mrs. Bliss, attended them all,
going last to the ball at the City Hall,
where the Diplomatic Corps were pres
ent, wearing their court suits. The
Count &c Bodisco Wore the uniform Of
an imperial chamberlain, with the insig-
MIA of number of orders of knighthood
while his beautiful wife appeared in the
dress which she had worn when she was
presented to the Gar, the year previous.
1t was of white satin, embroidered with
gold. and over it she Wore crimson vel
vet ""polonaise. with a sweeping train.
also embroidered with gold. while her
crimson velvet head-dress was resplend-
ent with diamonds.


When the bachelor ex-Secretary of
State came forward with number of
his fair friends, to present them to the
President, General Taylor remarked
""Ah. Mr.. Buchanan, you always pick
out the prettiest ladies' why. Mr..
President"" was the courtly reply. 50
know that your tastes and mine agree
in that respect Yes"" said General
Taylor: but have been SO long among
Indians and Mexicans that hardly know
| how to behave myself. surrounded by so
many lovely women.


President Taylor, although South
| erner by birth and slaye-owner, took
prompt steps to thwart the schemes OF
Mr.. Calhoun and his fellow conspirators.
Military officers were promptly ordered
to California, Utah, and New Mexico,
which had no government but lynch law
and the people of the last-named province.

Meeting Last Evening-The Cause
OF ImPuE tiles Ia our Drinking
Water to be Look ed Into.",,"In the absence of the President DR.
Draper was called to the chair at the
meeting OF the Board of Heath las,
evening""


The session was a lengthy one, but
was not of much Importance. A NUN.
Der Of nuisances, which have been on
hand fCr some time, were disposed of.
The collection OF garbage is now brirg
done without much trouble, under the
new contractors there being no com
pl.ints against them, which is some.
thing unusual.


Messrs. Springer and Draper were
appointed a committee to investigate a
nuisance at Twenty second and Tatnall
streets, in the shape of pond of
water on the property of Thomas
Mousley.


The late garbage contractor Of the
second district having thrown the con
tract for the above district up, the bal.
ance due him by the Board was audited
so that Mr. FoIsythe did not get any
thing. He was required to pay for the
advertising proposals for the removal
nf garbage for the second district, which
he had thrown up. After this was paid
a balance of IS remained, which was
ordered to be paid by Executive Officer
Underwood to the proper officials for
horse tax !; Mr.. Forsythe owing the
city for this tax.


The Secretary of the Board reported
that the expense for filling in the lots
between soeond and Third streets, east
of jackson street, belonging to Mr..
Benjamin G. Pole, OF Philadelphia,
which Was bore by the city, has not
been liQu,dated by the owner up to the
present ume. The Board instructed the
Secretary 10 again notify the owner,
that if the money was not forthcoming
soon the Board would sell his lot
A number Of nusances were reported,
among which the attention of the Street
Committee of City Council was called
to the filthy condition Of the cutters a.
Sixth and Poplar streets. These gut
ters weee reported by Executive Officer
Underwood, whereupOn the members
all joined in a discussion about the way
the streets and cutters are cleaned by
the Street ComIniSsiOner,and Mr.. Lynch
was handled rather roughly.


Only one case OF Sllail-pDX was re-
ported by the Secretary since the last
meeting, and only three flags displayed
throughout the city.


1t is the intention of the Board at its
next meeting to take definite steps
towards making a thorough survey VI

FALLEN AMONG THIEVES.


From the London World.


Jack Brittleby, Lord Bareleigh's fiftl
son, was on the verge of of general smasl
up when he encountered. at the Cercle d,
Ia Mediterranee, at Nice, Lazerus B
Spadge, the owner of silver mine al Ne.
vada. This Spadge was downright cad
but money flew off his finger-tips like
sparks off grindstone. He had made
been hostler, bruiser. convict, soldier
keeper Of liquor bar, and finally mining
tramp. He had left England at the age al
fifteen on an emigrant ship with his par
ents; at twenty he was fighting as private
on the confederate side; at twenty two he
had deserted, and was a lieutenant in the
federal army; at thirty he was in Sing Sing
under sentence of five years for murder
and robbery; at thirty five he was in the
insurance line Of businesss,' that is to say
that he bought ramshackle houses, filed
with grSmcrack furniture, Insured them fol
ten times their value, anttthen set fire to
them; at forty, after new term in goal, he
was keeping the liquor bar ct Jim's Gulch,
but had to fly suddenly to escape lynching,
on account of two travellers having been
found dead behind hist iemises with empty
pockets. At folty-one having bought a
claim"" (supposed to be ""lsed up ~ from a
despondent Irishman for bottle of whisky
he had Struck silver the same dav (Which
led by-the-bye, to his being obliged to shoot
the Irishnan. who wanted to cry off from
the barga5n), and now, at the age of forty
three, he was back again in Europe. travel
ing like prince, with fortune estimated
at million dollars year.


Lazarus B. Spadge was not one of your
lantern -jawed, goat.bearded Yankees, who
twang speech through their nostrils, as if
they had learned TO talk by listening to a
banjo. Ee did speak with slight twang,
and used slang that was often. quite incom-
prehensiBle; but on the whole he had pre-
served many of the characteristics of his
Anglo Saxon blood. He was tall, stout,
broad sheuldered fellow, with fsinging of
orange whiskers and beard round his face,
and clean shavel upper lis,. He dressed
in tight sEtting, horsey clothes, the result of
his early profession as hosaer ,and he looked
somewhat like jolly stage-coachman Of
old days. He always wore a white hat and
long, whity- brown top-coat The corner
of red silk handkerchief peeped out of
his breast pocket, and his hands were Gov
cred with dogskins Tie French gentle
men among whom he had been spending
his money most freely in Paris and at Nice
looked upon him as a fine specimen of the
American Milford"" though he disguised
them somewhat by chewing Virginia tobac-
co and expectorating on carpets wall papers,
polished steel fenders-anywhere in short.


Jack Brittleby had little taste for card
playing, but he had come to Nice as last
desperate venture, thinking he might by
some hazard pick up enough at Monaco and
the Cercle to carry him throagh the next
season. If the truth must be told, he was
not without SOME ugly desire of trying a
neat trick which he had learned of Lon
don conjurer, to insure two or three safe
deals at baccarat He was fairly on his
beam ends, poor wretch. His father, who
was impecunious, had sworn not to give
him another sixpence beyond his $500 a
year, SO that Jack was only holding on to
his commission in the Hussars by the skin
Of his teeth. The particular hobby that
had brought him to grief was plunging on
the turf


Lazarus B. Spadge had been holding the
bank at bac. one night, when he heard
some one behind him say: ""Here's Brittle
by"" He gave slight start, but went on
making any amount of money, then passed
the bank, and slouched mp to Jack, who
had not yet commenced play, but was sit
ting in an armchair. chewing o toothpick,


""Guess you're Mr. Brittleby?.

ever got was from your fathers under
keeper. Joe Barberry. Darn him!--a bully
chap he war for setting night traps to catch

| These are pleasant recollections,'

aCome and have dlink,"" said Mr.
Spadge, drawing out gold watch resem-
bling small warming pan. ..Guess you'll
have time enough to play by-and- bye

The result of the little wet"" which Jacl
and Lazarus Spadge had together was tina


they became good friends. Jack would


have sworn amity to the devil at tha


moment, it he could have seen chance o


fleeing him. He played at bac. for


couple of hours, and lost e2oO. all tn
money he had, except e2O note to carr,

in question told how Mr.. McMenamiI


had played the dictator on the Street

When it had been read Mr.. McMena-

was varied and quite remarkable for

Mr.. r.Paynter-W What is thegentleman' s

the next House to bare majority. The
membership of the House is 293. OF this
number 137 are Democrats and four Green
back Democrats, 147 Republicans ard FIVE

1he Star Route Cases-Defendants Dis-


charged.


WASHINGTON, November 10tb.--In the
Cfiminal Court this morning Judge Cox rem
dered decision in the star route cases, dis
eussing principally the question as to the in
famy OF the crime charged. The conclusion
arrived az was that the crime was Infamous,
ana ths accused should have been proceeded
against by Indictment He therefore sns-
tanned the motion expelling the information
from the files of the Court, and ordered the
discharge of the defendants.


SECOND DIsPATCH.l


WASHINGTON, November l0th.-Fey in
Washington are surprised at the decision of
Judge Cox, who grants the motion to strike
OFF the information against the star route
conspirators and the discharge of the defend
ants. The Courtroom was crowded, the
audience being very largely composed of
friends of the accused. As soon as the Judges
decision was made, VIM. Z. Cook, assistant
to the AttorneyG General, read statement,
which he had evidently prepared in anticipa-
tion Of the result. He denied the statement
of District Corkbill that the Attorner. Cen
eral had been consulted by him in regard to
the adjournment Of the Grand Jury.

Louisiana and Texas, he says that connection

Shreveport to the junction of the Southern

There is enough difference between

when added to the interest on the money and

Pacific coast from Los Angeles down through

A Diabolical Outrage Candidates for


lynching.


SPRINGFIELD (Mo.l November 10th.-A
most diabolical outrage was perpetrated on
Monday night at Seymour, Webster county,
a new railroad town on the Kansas City,
Springfield and Memphis line. A large
number of people were gathered there, living
in tents and huts, awaiting the erection OF
houses. In one Of the tents lived newly
married man named McLane. During Mon
day night Henry Carter and Frank Brown
entered che tent, and while one of the ruff
fans held revolver st McLsne's head the
other ravished McLsne's wife. They then
changed places, and the other villain per-
formed the same yils act. The alarm was
given Immediately. and large party started
in pursuit. Brown has been captured, and
Carter viii no doubt be taken. Judge Lynch
is likely to settle the case.

 ment Over the Afair-Much Feeling

 Against the Murderer.

 BANGOR, June 28.-The farming town of Parkman in Piscataquis county is greatly ex- ci ted over the murder of Alvin Watson Sun- day night. Watson was single man, 27 years old, of very inofensive disposition. He had lived alone in his house on the road to Wellington. He was a farmer, just eet- ting on in the world, and though his life was solitary, he looked forward to taking & wife to his home Yesterday morning at o'clock his corpse was found by the neighbors lying on the ground about fifty feet from his house, weltering in blood. There was severe wound on the mans throat which severed the jugular vein, and on his side were cuts made by a sharp knife, numbering in all forty-nine wounds. Suspicion at once point ed to Byron Chadbourne, deaf and dumb youth of twenty years, as the murderer, for on Sunday evening he was seen going toward Watson's house at about o'clock mute at first denied, but subsequently con- fessed that he did kill Watson. He showed the knife with which he did the deed and went through motions descriptive of his method of doing the work. He is very cool about the whole affair. There is strong suspicion that the father and mother of the mute were implicated in the act. Watson had no enemies and had 8 large number of rela- tions in all the surrounding towns. It will not be an unexpected event if within the next twenty four hours there shall be an at- tempt to lynch the murderer, for the people of the whole county are in fever heat of indignation and excitement There are many resolute and impatient young men who long to avenge the cold bIooded murder of one of their number, but wiser heads may prevail to let the law take its course. Deputy Sheriff Martin, of Guilford, has the murderer in charge and will take him to Penobscot jail at Bangor tomorrow, for there is no jail in Piscataquis county."

Exciting Scenes at a Lynching.",,"Exciting Scenes at a LynchinE.

 CHICAGO, Oct Especial despatches from Bloomington, H., give graphic details of the Iynching there on Saturday night of Charles Pierce, the imprisoned horse thief who shot and killed Jailer Franks while the latter was conveying him from one cell to another in the jail The despatches say that some of the best citizens were in the front ranks of the lynchers. Leading business men cheered and encouraged the lynchers, and women waved their handkerchiefs in appreciation For two hours the sheriff, with all his force, the police force and other officials, stood at the jail door and fought and pleaded with the infuriated crowd. When the murderer was raised the first time, Officer Bailey, of the police force, imperilled his life by break ing through the crowd and cutting the rope, letting the body fall. Upon attempting to repeat this act of bravery he came near being killed. The officers called out the fire de- partment to quell the riot by throwing water on the crowd. When steam engine arrived on the ground cries of ""Cut the hose!' con- yinced the firemen that it would not do to un- dertake to carry out their instructions, and they retired. The ringing of the fire bells called hundreds more to the scene, and added to the excitement When the lYnching was imminent despatches passed between Gov ernor CulIom and Lieutenant Governor Ham ilton, and the latter was directed by the gov ernor to call on the militia to protect life and property, but it was known that the militia could not be assembled Senator Fifer, for merly State attorney, and R. B. Porter, State attorney, did all they could to quiet the mob, promising that the murderer should be tried and punished but their pleadiRgs and prom ises were booted at. stJustice and the courts are farce"" 'sWe have seen too much of court quibblings,"" "" and other similar remarks were shouted at the officers by the mob, who persisted in their purpose of lynching Pierce and then dispersed."

CRIMINAL HEARTLEssNEss.


DETROIT, March 1.-THE body of boy 6
years old, son of James j. Craig, florist of this
city, was found in an alley near his fathers
residence this morning. He was last seen yes
terday evening playing. When found the
body was stretched face downward with a
stick of candy grasped tightly in one hand.
The body had the appearance of having been
run over by heavy wagon and then taken
and left where found, as the child's shoes were
free from mud. The case seems to be one of
criminal carelessness on the part of some driv-
er in the first place and then cruel heartless-
ness in the attempt to cover the first crime.

One day last week two men named

the horse could be found. Mr.. Maer,


having important business III another

In the meantime he told them to can

horse, who was then in the city attend

went to see Mr.. Eecks, told him OF
their knowIed ge As 10 the whereabouts

Albany stated that he was after the


money, when he met Lynch, who was
Intoxicated at the time, aud was toiu
Dy Lynch that he would soon get his
money, AS he had Il iine team which hc
was about to dlspOs. Of. AZ this point
""A lbany became iuiert sted and began
10 ""quiz' him, and immediately went
To PHiiadel phla to procure the reward
by giving tDe desired information con-
cerulng me stoieA properly.


The case WAS put iuto the hands of
the Society's counsel, who procured the
owner, and those who could identity
the horse, together with The two III.
formers and came to Wilmington yes
terdav. Upon arriving here, the case
was put into the hands of The Chief of

having purchased it from Mr.. Lynch
some time back, paying a good price
for il, but not knowing or thinhing for
u moment that 1t was a stoten horse.
The horse was given up to The otiiceIs,
who brought it TO the Delaware house
stables, where it was identified by the
owners.


Thus the horse was procured, and the
OF Y thing that reuaintd to be done,
was the capture of the thief or thieves.
1t was thought by one Of the par y, that
the two intormers knew ""a little too
much"" about the robbery, and their ar.
rest was ordered. They were given a
preliminary hearing last light before
the Mayor and the foregoing facts were
ELECTED from the witnesses and the
horse fully identified. II. G. Turner,
Esq represented Mr.. Specht, who had
purchased the horse.


David Picke \, a resident Of this city
was called and testified that Albany,
one of the prisoners in the dock, came
10 the house here Lynch boarded, and
told him that he had better "" skip at
once, or he would be arrested. Lynch
took the hint and Immediately made
himself scarce.


In view of this fact, and also from the
informers knowing so much about the
whole business, the Mayor held them
until the Pennsylvania authorities took
such action in the matter as is usual in
such cases, and they were committed
into the hands of the chief of police.


1t was $ atel by one of the gentlemen

that they are both in league with the
one that stole the horse, but worked
their plans too well (?) for their own

perhaps three, for no doubt they will

Mr.. Carmichael, chairman OF the spe

charges against Street Commissioner
Lynch, submitted the following report
and moved for its Adoption:


CITY HALL, Wilmington, Oct. 6, 1881
To the members OF City Council;
GENTLEMEN-Yourc com mittee would
respectfully report that having thor
oughly investigated the charges pre-
lorred by Patrick Gardner agains,
Louis P. Lynch, and heard al the
witnesses who have been produced
knowing anything about said charges,
they do hereby fully exoneraa the said
Louis Z. Lynch from any malfeas IN ce
in office Or completely in detrauding
the city, and that they find nothing to
against him, except that he has not ex-
ercised u sufficiently careful supervi-
sion over the acts OF some OF his EN-
ployecs, and that he failed to report to
the city auditor for collection a sale OF
dirt made to John Dunn.


JAMES CARMICHAEL,


Gno. 4. BARNHILL,


}. V. LAWRENCE,


JOSEPH X. ADAMS,


+. Z. MOORE.


Quite discussion was entered into
after the report mad been read.


Mr.. McMenamin arose and said that
he was not satisfied with the report
of the committee, rs they had failed to
investigate all The charges against Mr..
Lynch, citing the charges made against
him two years ago by MIR. Brown, and
his conduct in connection with 5 S.allcup
sewer, and also had failed to prove the
charges against him for drunkenness,
while on duty, and was on the point OF
mentioning another charge brought
against him when Mr.. Taylor arose to
point OF order, which was sustained by
the chair. Mr.. McMenamin then said
""that the committees may come IN here
and cover up the Street Commissioner
and his dirty work, but the pubic will
not. Mr.. Rodney asked for au expla-
nation of the paper.


Mr.. Carmichael referred him to the
long report of the testimony which had
been received at the different sessions
OF the investigation and which was sub
mitted with their reports.


Mr.. Moore arose aud said, as
member of this committee, 1 Was un Ter
the impression thar after we had ex-
amineu the charge brought against
Lynch by Gardner, Mr.. McMennmin
would prefer his charges, but he failed
to do so, and signed the report, buo
with great reluctance, On account Of
the two words fully exonerating.""
Col. Taylor said he was opposed to M r.
NcMenamin trumplng up charges,
which had been thoroughly investlga-
ted by Council two years ago, iu which
Mr.. Lynch was vindicated.


Mr.. Adams stated that in his opinion
they had no evidence that could con-
vict Mr.. Lynch.


MIR. McMenamin said rather Curtly
""You have shut Inc up iii Council, but
you cannot keep the charges | make
against Lynch out Of the public prints.
The press and the public will sustain
me-""


Other members Of Council spoke on
the subject, but space will not permit
IN to give their remarks.


Col, Taylor moved that the adoption
of the report be postponed one week, but
the motion was lost.


The President then called the yeas
and nays on the original motion, to ac-
cept the report which was adopted,
all the members voting in favor of the
adoption of the report except Messrs.
kenney, McMenamin and Rodney, the
former being absent and the latter yot-

wILMINGTON'S FOUL STREETS.

The Cutters still Reeking With
Filth-Indignant Citizens,",,"HAS the street cleaning force been in
creased ?"" asked a REPUBLICAN re-


porter of Street Commissioner Lynch,
this week.


""No we have about the same num-


ber of men employed, was the reply.


""Who is responsible for this, then;
the streets all over town are in such a


bad condition that the force should be
doubled >""


The Street Commissioner shrugged


his shoulders. ""You reporters, "" said he,


'are dangerous lot to talk to"" And
that is all he would say.


And il is n fact that the condition
OF the streets is worse than it was a
week ago when the REPUBLICAN began
to make war upon Chairman McMena-
min, and the garbage and ash contrac-
tors for their neglect in cleaning the
streets. The same plodding, deliberate
force OF Supcranuated sweepers is con-
tlnued without 4 single addition, and
the complaints of the citizens from all
parts of the town have no more effect
upon the head of the Street Committee,
than the demand that he be more
economical when economy was needed.
When it is question Of peStilenCe or
health he is on the side of the former.


\ look around town shows that the
situation in Wilmington is a terrible one
In all parts of town the thoroughfarcs
are foul with dirt that fills the atmos-
phcre with foulneSs. PeStilential cutters
abound in almost every square, and
in the poorer locations where
SquaIor rcignS are numerous.


A person who walks down east
seventh street cannot help noticing the |
filthy condition of the street. The |
cutters alone are bad enough. They |
are thick with dirt and the water emits |
a foul odor. But the very street itself |
from curb to curb is paved with filth.
II is not al all remarkable in view of |
he condition this thoroughfare has
Deen in for long time that more small
ION eases have originated here than in
my part of town. And il is not at all |
that six new cases We're dis
'ovcred in the neighborhood ON Mon
lay.


The citizens of this part Of town are
growing desperate in view of the awful
ituation in which they are placed by
IN incompetent street department, and
ak of taking up subscriptions to clean
he streets.


Another street, this onciS in one ofthc
'est parts of town; Ninth, from
'hiplcy to West, and all the thorough
ares in the vicinity are in a more or
ass filthy condition.


There is II nuisance in the shape Of n

the ice for Judge Lynch to decide on
criminal matters. We can't say that
we approve of the proceedings. not
withstanding the victim may have got
his just deserts, but to hang a man
right from under the wing Of the law,
does not look at all prudent. If it
had been some distance from justice

look little bad. In the spring of

Under-Sherihf Clark takes the man
out Of the cage and stands guard over

proves to be an armed mob. We do

M. Carmichael moved the adoption
OF the majority report and said Mr.. Moore
had not offered single objection to the
course pursued by the committee during
Its sessions, and when asked II he bad
any suggestions to offer as to the best
course TO be pursued, said he had none.


Mr.. Moore seemed somewhat taken
aback at this, and rather laBely replied
that ""after he found Lynch was not to
be admitted into tho room he thought 1t
time 10 keep quiet""


""But,"" said MIR. Barnhill, ""the gentle
man did not ask for Lynch's admission
into the room until after Gardner's de-
parture."" Mr.. Barnhill said Gardner on
ly renamed In the room about minute
and half and wanted all the committee
to be sworn before he would 20 on with
bis testimony.


Mr.. Lawrence said Gardner appeared
before the committee as dictator and
demanded that the committee be sworn.
He said he thought the committee could
believe Gardner's word, and If he could
not speak the truth without being sworn,
bis swearing would not make much diff
Q ence. Mr.. Lawrence further said he
did not hear Mr.. Moore make any COM
nlaint about sitting with closed doors.
z u. Rodney thought Council owed IL
10 themselves and the public not to al.
low The charges to rest against the Street
Commissioner.


Mr.. Bailey moved that tho report be
recommitted to the committee, with in
s.ructions 10 continue the investigatio, &,
have tie witnesses sworn and admit the
reporters of the press.


BY suggestions Of Mr.. Rodney and
President Sharpley, Mr.. Bailey's motion
was twisted into the shape of the follow.
ing resolution, which he offered:


ResOtued, That the report be referred
back TO the committee with directions to
hold their session In public, as far as
possible take the testimony OF witnesses
under oath, and to investigate all char ges
that may be brought against the street
commissioner for malfeasauce in Office.


Mr.. Carmichael referred to Gard ner's
course before the committee, and said
these efforts to have the investigation re-
opened looked a. II the movers had been
in conference with Gardner and were
'acking him up. He said Gardner was
being backed by some of the newspapers,
one OF which only few months ago, was
calling him all the bad names it could
think of. Mr.. Carmichael then alluded
to an editorial in yesterdays Republican
IN which the public and private actions
Of city officials were scandalously crit
cised, and sending the paper to the
Clerks desk had the editorial read.


Mr.. Rodney said be did not know Pat
Gardner, but II the Investigation Is con-
tinued and he persists In refusing 10 tes-
tify until the members Of the committee
Care sworn 1t will be) vindication OF
the accused.


Mr.. Merris Taylor said he was sorry
.he committee sat with closed doors
When Gardner left them, after making
bis absurd demand, he had an interview
with reporter, and the next day was
aired In some OF the papers as a witness
who wanted to be sworn before giving
bis testimony, but was refused this
privilege by the committee. Had the
representatives of the press been pres
ent at the meeting, this lying statement
could not have been made public. MIR.
Taylor favored the adoption of the COM
mittee's report.


Mr.. Robt II. Taylor thought the reso-
luton little too sweeping it should be
more specific ~ to charges against the
commissioner. Continuing Mr.. Taylor
referred to the Republican edi-
torial which had been read from the
Clerks desk and said: This is a nice
paper to criticise anybody's morality ;
why, Mr.. President, know that one Of
the editors Of this papers came to q city
official and tried to bribe BIN by offer.
ing him percentage on all city printing
ne would give them. These are nice
people to teach morality, inoeed.""


Mr.. Taylor said city officers had the
same rights ss other citizens, and that
newspapers could justly critIciss their
public acts, but not their private doings.
He said there seemed to be some talk
about an affair that happened In the
Water Observation-Disclosures and cheese
at the pump house. ""Why not investi-
gate that. We were all there, and even
this bribing editor took his crackers and
cheese with the rest.


A vote was then taken on Mr.. Bailey's
resolution and 1t was adopted, by the
following vote


Ayes-Messrs. Bailey ,Barnhill, Moore

ton, Paynter, Robinson, Rodney, Talley

Mr.. Carmichael asked the City Solici-
tor If Squire could come to the COM
miltee room ard swear witnesses. The
Solicitor replied in the negative, but
said he could take their affidavits.


Council then resumed the consider
alton Of other business, but afterwards q
resolution offered BY Mr.. Moore author
iziDg the committee to employ . Justice
Of the Peace and clerk was lost.

At the meeting of City Council, last
night, all regular committees were
continued on the business in their
hands, and the first report received
was from the special committee ap-
pointed to investigate the charges
made against rect Commissioner
Lynch, which was as follows.


WILMINGTON, Sept. IA, 1881.
To the President and Members Of the


City Council:


GENTLEMEN-Your committee ap-
pointed at the last stated meeting
upon the application of Louis p.
Lynch, Street Commissioner, to inves-
tigate charges of malfeasance in of
fee made against him by former
employe of the Street Department,
through the medium of the daily
newspapers, beg leave to submit the
following report


That y0ur committee met and duly
organized on Monday evening, Sep
tember 10. 1881, and adjourned until
Tuesday evening, September 13, no.
tice being given to l.. P. Lynch and to
Patrick Gardner, by whom the said
charges we're made, as 1t is alleged, to
appear before your committee al that
time that at the said time the said
Patrick Gardner appeared before your
committee and refused to make any
statement unless your committee
should be first sworn, and that all evil
dence taken in the matter should be
given under the sanction Of an oath.


Your committee do not feel that
they have any authority to administer
oaths or to compel the attendance Of
Witnesses by compulsory process.
Your committee cannot, tn refore,
take any testimony in the case other
than by the mere voluntary s'ate-
ments Of the parties. The said Pat
rick Gardner having refused to make
any such statement, your committee
cannot, therefore, go further in the
case because, without such statement,
we cannot know what charges are
made agains. the Street Commissioner
other than what has been published
in the daily papers ofthe city, and your
committee is not informed by the said
Patrick Gardner whether he made any
of such charges as he is represented
in The said newspapers. Your com.
mittee would, therefore, ask to be dis
charged from any further consider
alton of the matter.


JAMES CARMICHAEL,


GEO. T. BARNHILL,

Jos. K. ADAMS.


Your committee, however, beg
leave to make the following sugges-
ton by which an investigation into
said charges can be legally and pro
perly made. That by the application
of the Street Commissioner it appears
he is charged with maifeasance in
Office, which under the laws of this
State, is an indctable offence either
the employe re erred to in the petition
of the Commissioner, or any other
ci,izen can 60 before either the Mayor
or any justice of the peace, and upon
an affidavit filed, have a warrant
issued for his arrest. Upon hearing
of the cause, witnesses, both for and
against the party charged, can be
heard in an open court and upon oath,
which your committee understand, is
asked for by the said Patrick Gardner.

The fifth member of the committee,
Mr.. Z. q. Moore, not coincidisg iD the
above views, presented q minority re-
port, as follows:


WILMINGTON, Sept. 10, 1851.
To the President and Members of the


City Council of Wilmington:


GENTLEMEN You see by the report
of the committee Of investigation that
my name does not appear. l will, how. i.
ever, give my reasons for not signing
the report. In the first place, do not
think it was an Investigation, fro m the
fact that the committee undertook to
examine witnesses without having some
one 10 administer an oath. The major
| ity OF the committee claimed that we
had no right to employ justice of the
peace, from the fact that Council had
not appropriated any money for the COM
mIttee to expend. In the next place,
they wanted to do the Investigation with
closed doors, which l was very much
opposed 10, from the fact that we were
as much the public servants on that
committee as when we are in the Coun-
Gil chamber. Therefore, If we work in
| q committee of Investigation with closed
doors, why not close the door OF the
| Council chamber from the public? II
we have the right In the one case, we
certainly have right in the other. Mr..
Garduer would not be examined with
closed doors and asked for public In
vestigation and let the witnesses be
sworn. He said he would be ready and
willing TO give his evidence and prove 1t.
| was willing TO meet him on those
grounds, for believed he was in ear
nest and honest In what be said; and
again, they undertook to examine Mr..
Gardner without allowing Mr.. Lynch to
| come into the room to face the witness,
which l think was wrong, tor all inves-
| legations which have ever seen or
heard tell Of the accused had a right
| either by counsel or himself to cross
| examine the witnesses, but Mr.. Lynch
was not invited. l asked fer him, aud
| the other members OF the committee
gave me to understand that he could
not be admitted. These, gentlemen,
are my reasons for not signing the ma.
j,rlty report of the committee. You
may do as you like about d scharelng

purchases of twenty-one undeveloped silver
mines in New Mexico. This association en-
ployed man by the name of Gillette to de.
velop the mines. Gillette is the man who,
under Mackay, brought out the great Com
stock lode. Two weeks ago Gillette wrote a
letter to this city detailing such wonderful
results from the developments of one especial
mine and promises of others as to throw the
association into a perfect panic of joy.
Bonanza Mackay was in the city at
the time, and he was consulted about
Gillette's report, and said it could be relied
upon to the uttermost. Upon this the whole
party took with them some 5000 to facili-
tate the discoveries made, and set out for the
field of fortune. The one mine especially re-
ported upon by Gillette is alleged to be richer
than the famous Comstock. Some parts of
the vein exposed nearly pure silver. one ton
assaying as high as $4,000. This extra
ordinary prize in the lottery of mine-drawing
has set the whole town to talking. The day
before Yesterday Colonel Ingerson sent a
characteristic dispatch declaring his good
fortune. Before he went away he arranged
that if everything was as Gillette had repre-
sented it he would telegraph back the name
of some great iDfdel. This dispatch, when
it did come, was Bruno, Voltaire and Spinoza,
showing that it was three times better than
repreSeuCeu. OlHCe Lu6u, idtcr auFlCcS say
that three or four others of the twenty-ene
mines are very handsome investments. Per-
emptory orders have also been telegraphed to
sell none of the stock in any one of these
mines for any money.


Another Version"" Threatened.


New YORK, June 17th.-The Churchman
of this week says. 1--WE are to have still
another version of the New Testament, to be
known as THE American Version and
what is more it is to be copyrighted under
that designation"" As to the particular rea-
sons for its publication, the Churchnan says {:
""The fact that the readings and renderings
proposed by the American Committee of
Revision have been published in a separate
list, such of them at least as were not
adopted by the English revisions, has vexed
the minds of some people who cannot bear
| that anything American should be made to
take back seat, and certain others who are
not willing to acknowledge that there can be
any appeal from the judgment of the Ameri-
| can committee""

of the office are imposed upon Chief Clerk
Power, who has been diligent in unearthing

The Coming Race Between CoIu.nbia

 .,.a ...1-rr,n... Hnlo 6,..arur",,"The Coming Race Between COIumhia

 and Harvard-The Yale Crew.

 The Columbia College crew arrived in New London yesterday morning. They row the Harvard crew on Monday, the 27th. They have quarters on the west side of the river

 opposite Harvard's quarters They are in

 good condition, with the exception of Reek-

 hart, who is suffering with poisoned hand.

 Clarkson, who was substitute, was compelled

 to give up on account of strain and swell

 ing of the right wrist. The men have been

 pulling in good form, the defects being such

 that they may be easily overcome. The crew

 is as follows

 A. Moore lbowl, weight 16o pounds, age 20 years

 Charles Eldridge, ds 5o l5o rounds 91 & aa years. J. T. Lynch, 176 pounds, q years.

 A. H. Van Sinderen, ITS pounds 2f years. H. R. Muller, 163 pounds, 20 years.

 J. A B; cowles (strokel m 1s2 pounds s2 20 year years D. Porter tsubstitutel, 166 pounds, 2l years The Columbia freshmen, who are to TOW

 the Harvard freshmen at Cambridge on June 3Oth, will leave for Boston on Friday next

 They are pulling from eight to ten miles a day and are in good condition.

 The shell which will carry the Columbias in the race is 8 new paper boat and perfect model of what racing boat should be. The crew are in fine condition, and while they are not so heavy as the Harvards, are tough, sin ewy looking men, with lots of grit and stay ing powers. They are not over confident of success, but are sure of giving the Cambridge eight close pull. The time of the race is not yet definitely determined but it will probably occur at haf-past ten or eleven o'clock a. m. on Monday the 27th Moore, Columbia's bow oar, although un- finished in style, is regarded as a strong pull Ter. Eldridge was the substitute of the Hem | ley four, and is the captain of the eight. Reckhart is freshman, and is to row in the race of the freshmen eight on the 30th inst. Lynch is regarded as another good man. He rowed in the freshmen crew of 1880. Mont l gomery is senior, who has participated in several class races, while Van Sinderen is the tallest of the crew and the most reliable. Muller has rowed starboard in other races. Cowles was the freshman stroke last year. He is light oar, but possesses fine form and l indomitable pluck.

 R. c. Watson, of the class of '69, has the Harvard crew in hand, and under his guid- ance and instruction they have been in prac- | tice since October 1. They will leave Cam | bridge for New London on kFriday, and will hardly get settled in their quarters before Sat- urday Their late arrival will give them only | that day in which to pull over the course, for on Sunday they will not row for sentimental

 reasons, and on Monday physical reasons | will keep them of the water until they go on for the race itself. They will bring two shells, 8 paper and cedar, and their little steam launch, the latter craft that is supposed to

 be capable of turning in circle no larger

 than three-cent piece and so swift that mo- body has yet been able to reckon its speed. | The personnel of the crew appears in the fol-

 lowing table,"

LYNCHBURG, Va, August 1.-The
Coalitionists adjourned this morung at
2 o'clock, sine die, after having eDdors-
ed the regular Readjuster platform. A
majority of the coalitionists left for
home this morning.


The ""Straigh.out"" convention reas-
sembled at 9 o'clock this morning. The
platform was read and, after much dis
cussion on the debt plank, was adopted
by vote of St to 32.


Ross Hamilton, leader of the Neck
lenburg delegation, upon the adoption
of the platform, said that if his deiega-
ton, remained after the adoption of the
platform they would grossly misrepre-
sent their constituency. They would
therefore, he said, retire. The action of
Mr.. Hamilton and his followers was
severely critlzed by the President of the
Convention


A committee on nominations was then
appointed. j. W. Cochran, colorcd, OF
Rockingham, was appointed chairman
OF the State Central Committee and ex-
otticlo chairman of the State Executive
Committer and A. Splitter, of Rich
mOud, was elected Secretary of the
State Central Committee and ex o!ficio

pies OF the Republican panty, none is OF
more vital importance to the welfare
and interest OF The country III al. It's
parts than that which pertains to tue
sInctlty Of Government contracts. IL
therefore, becomes the special duty and
province OF the Republican party OF
Virginia to guard and protect the credit
Of our time honored State, which has
been besmirched with reputation, or
received, with iii strust, by the gross


nlalnanasement of various factions ct
the Democratic party which nave CoL-
trolleu the Legislature of the State.


Resolved, That the Rcpubli can parry

The Committee on Nomination re
ported to the convention the names Of
General W. G. Wickham, of Richmond,
for Governor; Mayor S. NJ. Yost, OF
Staunton, for Lieut.. Governor, and
Judge Willoughby, of Alexandria, TO;
Attorney General.


The report of the Committee was un-
animously adopted.


General Wickham and Major Yost
addressed the Convention, desllning the
nominations, but entreated the Kepub-
lican party to make firm stand, and
abide by the decisions of the Cenven-
ton.


The Convention then decided not to
make any nominations, as they deemed
il inexprdient, but concluded, with
great unanilnity, to hold fast to the
principles Of the Republican party, ig.
noring any and all propositions for a
readjusment of the debt, either Ma
t4On2 or State.


The state Central Committee was in
structed to issue an address setting
forth the actions and principles Of the
Convention.


AT 1.3o p. IN. the Conven: ion adjourn
ed Slnt die.


1t is generally believed that the re-
suit of the Convention will hold intact
the Republican organizations of the
state, and the Mahoneitos will have few
followers in the Straightout ranks.

HOspital-An Interesting Sess ON.",,"


sClerk Pennington entered upon his
duties at the regular meeting of Coun-
Gil last night and read through the min
utes with a voice like chain lightning
which excited favorable comment from
the members Business was rapidly
gotten down to and the Street Commit
tee was called. The report of this COM
mttee kicked up a little breeze.


The first was upon the petition ofthe
Board Of Health asking that the filthy
gutter at Ninth and Monroe streets be
abated. The report was to the effect
that the nuisance cannot be aoated TIL
the curb is set and the side walk brought
| to grade. Mr., Rodney objected TO the
report which he said was remarkable
one and was another illustration of the
way the Street department had been
going 10 the dogs for a long time. The
gutter would have to be fixed and Coun-
ell alon. had the power. He moved
the matter he referred back to the Com
mittce with instructions TO report some
thing practicable. The motion was lost
and the renor. was then adopted.


/ Close following this came an adverse


reuUrt from the same committee upon
the resolution Of Mr.. Rodney, referred


to it at the previous regular meeting,


asking rhat the paving Of DUPONT
stree, BE- comp p'ete,l, Here was some
thing ESQ. Mr.. Rodney said in OPP

paved point. Th"" work hau been Or
,lered done and sropr.u when nearly
finished. Mr. Rodney showed that the
failure 70 cvtnplete the work was WITH
out reason.


Messr>. Talley and Menton spoke in
tie same strain and Mr.. Rodney in
another speech again went for the street
committee saying be had hoped tc see
a chance when il was reor9anized but
the sane disposition existed as ever to


miSlnanage things and let highway mat


ters work or their own salvation. TN

port was postponed for two weeks.

IS AN EXTRA SESSION NEEDED",,"IS AN EXTRA SESSION NEEDED.

 It is reported that President Garfield does

 not see any necessity for an extra session of

 the Forty-seventh Congress, and that he will

 not call one unless something occurs to make

 such 8 call imperative. The chief argument

 for extra session is that provision should

 be made for refunding the five per cent.

 bonds redeemable after May 1 of this year,

 and the sizes, redeemable after June 30,

 about $462, 1000, ,O0O of the former and $265,-

 COG, ,00o of the latter. The saving that would

 be effected in one year by refunding this

 amount at three per cent. would be about

 seventeen millions, or at three and a half

 per cent. thirteen and half millions. If an

 extra session now would only bring about

 refunding six months earlier than it could be

 accomplished by waiting for the regular

 session next winter. the saving of half 8

 years interest would pay the cost of the

 session two or three times over. But part of this saving can be made without the aid of Congress. The secretary of the treasury can spare from the surplus income and the balame in the treasury fifty millions or more to pay so much of the maturing debt out flR4G, ana ne mas uHCoE tuo 1dsG dC1 authority to issue two hundred and fifty mil lions we believe, of four per cents. He could thus fully dispose of the maturing sixes and reduce the amount of the fives to about $42O, COG, ,OOO, on which half years saving by new three per cent. bond would be less than four and a quarter millions, against which might be-offset the expense and the political inconvenience of an extra session.

 Another reason urged in favor of an textra | session is the desire for investigations by congressional committees of the methods whereby several Bourbon congressman were returned elected in the face of overwhelming majorities against them. It is argued that if l the inquiries in the southern contested-elee ton cases could begin in May decisions might | be hoped for before adjournment, and | Lowe, of Alabama; Lynch and Buchanan, of 1 Lee, of South Carolina; Stovall, | of Virginia, and other Liberals like them | would have their seats, in place of the men | they defeated at the polls. This, it is urged, is most essential to the safety of the organ ization of the House. On the other hand, it f is argued that an extra session would not en- able the Republicans to forward the matter of investigating the southern election frauds, | and that nothing substantial could be accom- plished by them. One thing is certain, and | that is that the people are not anxious for an | extra session."

children was resumed at the Second Precinct Sta
tion atnoon yesterday the following members ofthe
jury answering to their names when called by the
Coroner: James McNabb, jr, W. II. Haney, John
d. Lord, Albert G. Benson, Louis Behrens, and
Francis Ochsenriter.


The first witness called was Rose Taylor, the
daughter OF the woman accused Of the murder,
and her testimony was not of the positive charac-
ter 1t should have been. She would say yes to any
question asked no matter how II might affect any
previous assertions She WINS o trlHe nervous,
which was accounted for by her having been raised
In the country and never before subjected to 20
many inquisitorial glances Her testimony was
substantially as follows: 1.-THE first time my
mother went up to Mr. Fishers house Saturday
was between three and four o'clock. She was gone
about an hour and half The second time she
went away was after Mr.. Fisher came home, about
six o'clock. We were sitting In the door Of our
house when Mr. Fisher came up. This time she
stayed about quarter OF hour, aud soon after he
drove back toward the city.


SOMETIMES MY MOTHER HAS GrDDy SPELLS
In the head which last two or three days. Some
times these spells make her cross, and she threat
ems to hurt us with anything she can lay her hand
on. She says she don't get angry often, but when
she does It would be best for you TO keep out my
way, for If you don't stop nggravating me will
lay you out with the first thing get hold Of





When she came down from Mr.. Fishers the second
time she said 'Mr. Fishers two children are
dead, and we must get of the place. When she
sent me after my nephew l thought she wanted
him TO go up 10 the house after his mother. On
our way down told the boy that supposed we
would have to leave Mr.. Fishers place, as the two
children had been killed. l did not see any one
about the place except the hands who belonged
there. The first time she came back from Mr..
Fishers after leaving the washboard she walked
little faster than usual. She was walking very
fast, and when she got home


SHE SEEMED TRIPLE EXCITED.
wentup TO Mrs. Lynchs as soon as Mr.. Fisherleft
for the city again. She sent me after the boy. Be-
fore that he always came home by himself ! told
him to come quick, that his grandmother wanted
him. As Mr.. Fisher was going out of the gate he
said something that did not understand. My
mother said we would have to get away that
night


Harry Brown, who lives with Mr.. Fairtnx, just
outside the District line, testified that he knew
Rose TAYLOR. She was not working at Mr.. Fairfax's
Saturday. The Wednesday previous she was there.


Emma Green sworn: ""she lived in the rear of
Asbury Mission Church. Had been to Christiana
Taylors house once, aud knew her. The 3Oth Of
May stopped ut her house to get water. She
asked me If that was my child had and told
her no. told her had raised 1t since II was u
month old She said, what 90 you want to bother
with other peoples children for when you've got
none of your own Take II and throw 1t down the
stone-pile there and


KILL 1T AND SELL THE CARRIAGE.


Nobody will ever know anything about it, She
said this IN the presence of my mother. When my
husband returned from the spring told him what
the old woman had said, and he said she must be
witchifed old fool""


Ephraim Barnes recalled: ""He assisted In hitch
ing up the horses Saturday when Mr. and Mrs.
Fisher went to town. They left the place in sepa-
rate wagons, but both teams started together, one
behind The other. He was in front, with the
double team, and she had the single. When they
LEFT had not been away from the house over FIVE
minutes. Did not sec a man pass over the field in
his shirt-seeves, and II such thing had occurred
must have seen 1t. Nobody passed through the
field except the old woman""


Lieutenant James Johnson testified that 4"" on the
morning of the Sth instant the old woman said she


WOULD TELL ALL ABOUT THE MURDER,
If he would let her co. Since then she has not said
anything ON that score, and when come to the
point she flies off OH something else She says the
man she saw up in the pines that day had on
yclowlsh dress or overalls. When she was going
to the house he hailed her He was a copper col
orcd man. She went out In the pines to look for
him, but could not find him.""


The room was then cleared for the jury, which,
after lengthy discussion. returned
THE FOLLOWING VERDICT
That the said Joseph and Lizzie Fisher came
to their death between the hours Of eleven o. IN.
and six p. m, August g. at their residence Dundas
farm, on the Bunker Hill road, from injuries to
the head The jury are unable to say positively at
whose hands the deed was committed, but from
the evidence adduced suspicion points strongly
to Christiana Taylor as the guilty party""


The accused was locked up at the station last
night, but will probably be sent to Jail to-day,
with her daughter, who is held as a witness
| for the Government While the inquest was In
progress DR.. Hartgan made another examination
of the AK found near the children, and discovered

fine hairs had adhered A more minute micro.

The murderer cooIly closed the knife, placed it his pocket and walked down the street, passing through the crowd, which seemed terror stricken Stop. ping on the sidewalk, he turned, and seeing that his right hand was bloody and bleeding from cut, he shook 1t, sprinkling blood on the sidewalk. He then entered the Richbuyg House washed his hands and walked toward the depot, when he was arrested by two men and taken to magistrates office The pop ulatlon, as the news spread, became wild with excitement. Men and women rushed on the street crying, Hang him ID ssShoot the wretch!h !h One excited woman offered to furnish the rope for hanging him. The magistrates office was surrounded all the af- ternoon, and at this hour it is rumored that the prisoner has been taken from the officers and iynched. This report, however, has not been verified.

 KANSAS C1TY. Sept. 13.-George Bannister, was arrested yesterday for disturbing public worship at a church in the neighborhood of the recent Blue Cut train robbery. While the minister was preaching Bannister jumped up and began firing off a pistol and hurrahing for the train robbers. He escaped at the time, but was arrested yesterday, and from his actions it is believed that he has betrayed himself, and he will probably be held as one of the participants in the train robbery.

 There are no other developments in the matter to day. The grand jury will be in session next Monday and the cases of the ar rested men will then be brought before them

 CHICAGO, Sept. 13-A special from Inde- pendence, Mo, to the Daily Neaos says the prisoners heretofore confined at that point charged with compGcity in the Chicago and Alton train robbery were this forenoon quickly but quietly removed to Kansas City. It is supposed this was done as preventive measure, as there is much feeling aroused in Independence in favor of lynching the more strongly suspected members of the gang This would certainly be done if there was a little more positive proof of guilt. A vigi lance committee is being organized by the business men and substantial farmers. The pursuing parties have not as yet been heard from and their whereabouts is unknown."

The Post congratulates itself that the
Bourbon minority in the. Senate has
taught the Virginia anti-Bourbons that
the Presidents nomination for Office can
be defeated by filibustering. But the
lesson is boomerang. The refusal of
the Bourbons in the Senate to allow vote
to be taken on the Lynchburg post-ofiice
nomination was an admission by them
that they could not defeat the nomina-
tion in any other way than by dilatory
motions. This will at the regular session
bring to test the question of whether the
President can nominate and, by and with
the advice and consent of majority of
the Senate, appoint officers to transact
the public business, or whether minor
ity can, by delay and revolutionary
methods, harass the President into COM
plying with their demands.


Says the Washington correspondent of
a New York daily:


It is ntimated in Democratic circles that the
President may go just little too far in his efforts
to please Mr.. Malone, and that next session his
Administration might need the assistance ofDemo-
cratic support.


This furnishes q perfect explanation
of the policy of the Bourbon
Democracy rs exhibited in the re-
fusal of their representatives in
the Senate to allow vote on a contested
presidential nomination. The President
is to be intimidated by threat of Demo-
cratic opposition to his Administration
unless he abandons his friends. When
he desires to fill vacant place in Yer
mont or Iowa of course it will be smooth
sailing for any nomination he sees fit to
make. But let him beware how he in
vades the Solid South. Let him under
stand that if any people there raise the
standard of rebellion against the old
Bourbon dynasty he must not dare to
select one of them for u post-oflice. He
can take Republican vouched for by
Bourbons as respectable because harm
less, but ifany who have been confederate
Democrats attempt to escape from bond
age they are to be treated as fugitive
slaves and surrendered to their masters
on demand.


Malone must be treated as an outlaw
by the President, as he is by the Bourbon
Senators, because he has burst the bonds
and led corps ofthe Democratic army to
q patriotic position. The President is
notified that the public business shall
stop in the Senate unless Bourbons are
nominated by him for Office in Virginia.


To all of which the President might
we'll reply: ""There can be no other pub
lie business cqualing in Importance the
settlement of the question whether the
Democracy ought to control the selection
of subordinates of President chosen in
opposition to them, especially when in
order to do so they are obliged to sup
press majority in the Senate by reyolu-
tionary distractions""


The Bourbons have no more excuse fol


antagonizing good men nominated by the
President for Office in Virginia than il
Vermont. That the nominee stands by
Malone in the support ofthe Administra
ton in Virginia is no better reason fol

 Washington Buried i'm GrIeE-The News Given to Gufteau-NO Emotion Ex- hfbited by the Assassin.

 | WASHINGTON, Sept. 2O.-Morning broke over this quiet afflicted city and found evil throughout it's length and breadth and ex- pressions in various ways by festoons and columns of crape and flags at ha1f-mast. The business houses are all closed and an anx- | ious reverent quiet conversation is to be heard on every hand. The display of mourn | ing has scarcely ever been equaled here, and the taste and skill with which it Aas ar- ranged is unexceptionally effective. One de- monstration of an incendiary character was | presented about o'clock this morning by l drunken street peddler and sword swallower l who delivered vigorous appeal to large au- l diences to follow him to the jail and lynch the assassin. The man proposed to arm any number of men who would accompany him and hinted darkly at vulnerable points of the iall. He was arrested and locked up. An unlucky individual narrowly escaped the fury of the crowd at about 10 o'clock this morning, which was excited by the fippant remark he had made upon the absorbing topic. All the the theaters have closed for the week on account of the death. A swift, quiet and immediate tribute of respect to the dead chieftain is this beautiful evidence of the nobility and common sense respect so particularly American It is understood fact that no theater in America will be open until after the funeral of the Presi- dent. All the government departments are closed to-day. This was decided upon at consultation to-day of the assistant secre- taries of departments and the heads of bureaus. It will be determined tomorrow whether the departments will remain closed longer than one day. Secretary Windom telegraphs that he will return tomorrow. To-day such correspondence was sent out from the departments was written on mourn ing paper. This will be used for six months. When President Lincoln was assassinated the mourning clothes during the subsequent six months. It is very probable that this GUS tom will be observed on the present occa- sion. The Executive Mansion seems to at tract more attention to day than at any time since the removal of the President. A large throng of people float about the lawn and the gates are surrounded by curious persons. fire engine was engaged during the fore noon for washing the front and sides of the mansion The flags are at half mast and the mansion is heavily draped in the habiliments of woe Sergeant Dinsmore and the late Presidents nurse Steward Crump expressed themselves thunderstruck when the news received. It came to them almost on the heels of very hopeful telegram from Dr. Boynton.

 The news of the Presidents death was re- ported to Guiteau this morning He had an intimation of the fatal termination of his work by hearing the bells tolling last night. hl1fv nf den Crocker approached his cell. Guiteau came to the door and exclaimed. General what news from the President ?"" q hesita- ted to answer"" said Crocker, 'sbut he re- newed his request, saying, ''You have some news General, am sure of it. What is ?' Unable to retain myself further. said, Well, the President is dead he died last night. Guiteau received the news calmly. His only remark was: ''Poor fellowi am glad he is out of his misery"" He then went to the back part of his cell. There is a crowd about the jail, but it is not demonstra the jail are apparent. Those sitting and standing on the hill around the prison appear as mere curiosity seekers.

 Everywhere the city is draped in cambric weeds of woe and all flags have been at half mast. Where bulletins have been dis played pictures of the late President now ap- pear framed in the deepest black. Though

 

 been no disorderlv demonstration, and, as far as can be learned up to late hour, no effort at mobbing the jail where Guiteau is confined. The jail has been surrounded all day more or less by multitude of anxious idlers, but no mention of any disorderly pro- ceedlngs was made. The general feeling prevalent is that of the deepest sorrow, and instead of violence the people seem to have lost all revengeful feelings towards Guiteau now that their beloved President is dead.

 PREPARATIONS AT THE WHITE HOUSE.

 At the White House it was busy day. As sistant Private Secretary Pruden and his clerks arrived there early this morning and awited the news from Long Branch. A te1e- gram received from Private Secretary Brown shortly after 10 o'clock, gave notice that the Presidents remains, escorted by his family, the Cabinet and others would arrive to-mor- row. Immediately steps were taken to re- ceive them. All the rooms formerly stripped of their furniture were put in order again, the carpets were laid and by tomorrow morn ing the mansion will be in thorough order. Before noon the mourning drapery within and without was in position. In the clerks office much work was performed also. Official letters closing up the affairs of the late Pres Ldent were written upon paper edged in black. The documents, books and papers belonging to the dead chief were collected together and packed for shipment to Ohio. All the per sonal effects of the family were packed also. Mrs. Garfield and family will occupy their old apartments until after the funeral his arrival here tomorrow, but he will move into the White House next week. It is expected that the military honors to be paid to the dead President will be quite imposing. The officers of the army and naxy all of the United States troops now in the District and the local militia are under orders to meet the remains tomorrow to act escort to the White House. An order was issued from the War department tonight di- recting every post, station, fort and arsenal throughout the country to hold appropriate ceremonies in memory of the late President that the flags be kept at half f-mast, that thir- teen guns be fired at dawn of each day for thirty days, and afterwards at intervals of thirty minutes between the rising and setting of the sun 8 single gun be fired. At the close of the day 8 national salute of thirty eight guns will be fired.

 A similar order was issued from the Navy department, Officers of the army will wear badges of mourning for six months. The guards of honor from the army to escort the remains from this city to Cleveland Ohio, will consist of nine General officers and twenty nine picked men. There will be an equal number of officers fromst navy.

 AN EXTRA GUARD AT THE JAIL.

 The guard at the jail has been increased Considerable anxiety was expressed here over rumors with reference to a car load of roughs from New York, Trenton, N. J., Phil adelphia and other points who were coming here to lynch Guiteau. These rumors were circulated all day, and as a result the depots were surrounded by crowds of people and special details of police. The only party of roughs who came here with incendiary pur poses was the party from Baltimore who came here last evening under the command of man named J. Logan They are still here.

The steamer War Eagle, of the Up
per Mississippi line, bound down from ST.
Paul with a large list of passengers and
freight, on the night of the 4th came into
collision with the drawbridge at Keokuk
and was hopelessly disabled. As the boat
struck the bridge pier the latter
gave way, and then with terrific
crash, an entire span toppled over on the
stricken vessel, crushing large hole in her
side, through which the water poured in a
vast flood. The passengers were hastily
gathered together upon the hurricane deck,
and many climbed from the boat upon the
bridge. The boat soon afterward swung
clear from the bridge pier and foated down
stream with the current a few hundred
yards, when she rounded to and was made
fast to the bank, and the passengers were
safely transferred to terra firma. First re-
ports regarding loss of life were contradic-
tory, but it was thought at least two or three
were drowned.

""rhe day after the funeral the grave
was opened and the caSket cover re-.

read juSted the hands, closed and lower

A few days later friends persuaded the
husband to have the remains examined
again, which he did, and again found
her hands lying at her side and, also,
her hair dishevellcd. Still there seem
ed no signs of life, and the third time
the body was covered in the grave. by
this time the excitement began to inten-

fourth day artur the burial, the body
was again exhumed and again the evil

Her husband was leading member in the Second Presbyterian Church here and a leader in all good works After her death he appeared greatly distressed and more pIOus than before. This morning the Virginia Mlid- land train brought another st anger to the city, and he, alighting from the ears, approached a policeman and introduced himself as John Waite of EsseXvilie Michigan.

he exercised that right No doubt he


saw the question in different light


from his other four brethren on the

by Mr.. Edmunds and other Republican Sena-

having been executed. they said by reading it |
in the Senate Chamber in the hearing OF Sena- |

tho issuance OF much more stringent order. |

PASS INTO THE HANDS OF READJUsTER.",,"fBY TELEGR ATH TO THE TElBUNEl


WASHINGTON Oct, 27.-Tbe executive session Oh
the Senate to-day occupied nearly six hours lncnd-
ing a recess of one hour The nominations OF
Judge Folger to be Secretary of the Treasury, the
denomination of Mr.. James, as PostmaSter-General
the nomination of Mr. HaitOn. to be First AsSls'an
Pos master-General, and several other less inpor
tant nominations, were promptly conlrmed every
thing was running smoothly, and some OF the more
sanpuine Senators expressed hope that the Scna'e
would be rea ly to adjourn Tomorrow sine die


This cheerful prospect was suddenly couded, how
ever when majority of the Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads reported fayorably upon the
nomination of Mr. Statham to be Postmaster at
Ivnchburg Va Mr. Statham is the gentleman
whose confirmation Genera Early and other pa
triotic Bourbons are anxious TO defeat becau'e
he has left their ranks and allied himself
with the Liberal movement. Senator MaXey, of
Texas. who is a member If the Post Office Commit
tee, presented minority report against Mr.. Stat
ham. and supported it in n vigorous speech Senator
Johnston of Virginia. Senator voorhees,, OF lndiann,
Senator Bayard and Others spoke on the same side,
and argued in favor of the retention of the present
incumbent who has held the office dozen yea :,
and whose present term of Office will expire
twelve days hence.


The only objection urged against the appointment
q +.
only twenty-three or twenty-four years old. 1t is
understood that Mr.. Bayard is the Senator who
thinks Mr.. Statham too young to be a postmaster.
In the course of the discussion Senator Ferry
caused to be read report OF Colonel
Parker Chief Post Office Inspector. accord
ing TO which it is understood that the present
Postmaster at Lynchburg found to he short IN
his accounts last spring some ~ 300. lie made the
amount good however and in consideration of his
services as a Union soldier President Garfield de-
cided TO give mm another trial. In september
last an examination of the Office by an inspector
of the Post Office Department showed that the POST
master was again short over -, 900. On the 81 inst
this amount was made good, but the Postiu1strrs
sureties were informed by the Department that the
Postmaster was delinquent and that they would be
held RESPONSIBLE for the safety OF the fun
of the Office until further arrangements
couId he made In the face of this
official record it is said that Senators Bayard, Nor-
hces. Johnston, Maxey and others persisted in de-
Tending the Postmaster against the accusation that
he had been in default. aud they, well as all the
other Democratic Senators, expressed a deter
mination to oppose 10 tho last the confirmation OF
the man whom President Arthur has nominated a.
his successor.


In the speech sto-daythc Democratsb betrayed their
motives by renewing, with considerable bitterness,
their assaults upon Senator Malone and the Anti
Bourbon party in Virginia. The Republican Scna-
tors said very little bccause they were anxious
TO have vote reached but their oppo-
nents succeeded in preventing that to-day
bv talking until less than quorum Of
the Senate remained. The struggle will be re-
newed tomorrow. Some of the Democrats declare
that they Will flibuster to any extent - prevent
the confirmation Of Statham before the election in
Virginia shall take place, ana some OF the hepnbli,
fine first Monday in December rather than iOrcgo
the attempt TO confirm this nomination.


Some talk is heard among Republican Senators
to-uipht in favor of a caucIis to consider what
course shall be taken. There is every probability
that Mr.. Stathams nomination viii be confirmed
when a vote is takn The office itself is Of no great
Importance, but the Democrats are 80 afraid of the
political effect Of a change at this time that they
appear to be willing to go to any length to pre-
vent IL."

The rumora in regard to the proba-
bility of securing the conviction Of
Guiteau are very disquieting. is said,
aud apparently in all seriousness, that
the laws Of the District of Columbia
are so framed as to prevent the indiet-
ment Of the assassin on any more serious
charge than that Of an assault. It is
further alleged that inasmuch as the Presi.
dent died IL another part of the country ii
may be found impossible to bring Guiteau
to trial either in Washington or New
Jersey. 1t is time that the public mind
was set at rest in this connection by some
authoritative statement of the facts. Ur.
fortunately there have been 80 many eva.
siops of justice OF late years in murder
cases that it is impossible to feel any as.
surance that there will not be a similar fail.
ure in this instance. Itisindeed improbable
that any Of the ordinary shifts of the law.
yers can hberate Guiteau The danger
lies in the defects of the laws, if it exista
anywhere. It may be impossible to find
twelve men in the United States who
would aequit him on the plea Of in.
sanity If ne was charged with murder.
But the danger which threatens is that he
viii not be brought before such jury OF
that if brought before jury he will noS be
charged with murder. Should any such i'm.
perfections IN the law be found to impede
justice in this case, very difficult problem
will be presented to the people. OF couras
it will be argued that respect for the law
IS necessity of civilized government. Bu;
ii the law is SO badly framed as to help the
criminal instead of to protect society, il
would be neither reasonable nor expedient
that it should bs treated with respect. A
blind respect for law as law, without any
regard to its results, has been inculcated
time and again IN the interest of the worst
despotisms. 1t is in fact of piece with
the pernicious requirement that "" the
powers that be should be submitted to
on the pretense that they are "" ordained
of God"" We want neither divine
right OF kings nor a divine right of laws.
The law must be deserving of respect before
it is respected, and law which should cheat
the gallows of Guiteau would deserve the
contempt and adherence of the American
people. The escape of this assassin by
legislative bungling would moreover have
the most disastrous effect upon public senti-
ment. In the FIRST place it would operate as
an incentive to similar crimes, and thus
put the lives of our most prominent men
at the mercy of every knave or fool who
might fancy thai he had a grievance. In
the nexs place ii woald create such geu.
eral contempt for criminal legislation az
would issue in the resort TO lynch.law at
every opportunity. In fact nothing but
evil could flow from such failure of
justice, and it is therefore to be hoped that
the authorities at Washington viii be able
TO see their way clear to the indictment
and trial of Guitean on charge of murder.
and with as little delay as possible."

recognition took place, Guiteau saying:
""You are the man who wouldn't let me 60
through the jail some time ago."" The only
other remark he made before being placed
in his cell was that General Sherman would
arrive at the Jail soon.


The jailors state that they have seen him
around the Jail several times recently, and
that on one occasion he appeared to be
under the influence of liquor. On one of
his visits, subsequent to the first one men,
toned, these officers say that Guiteau sue

scaffold from which the Hirth murderers
were hanged.


One of the letters referred to, showing
clearly that the intention of the prisoner
was to murder the President is as follows:

CHARLES GUITEAU.
The statements referred to as being adj
dressed to Byron Andrews are retained by
the police authorities. They are contained
in a lengthy document, covering apparently
about thirty pages of letter paper and writ
ten in heavy course hand. In addition to
those above referred to there is letter ad
dressed to Vice President Arthur, in which
| Guiteau informs him of the assassination o.
President Garfield, and that he Arthur
was by this act made President of the
United States. Guiteau then proceeds tt

Coulsburg for Secretary of State; Levi P
Morton for Secretary of the Treasury; EN-
ory A. Storrs. of Chicago, for Attorney Gen
eral, and John A. Logan for Secretary o
War; He further says in this letter tina
Postmaster General James is doing so wei

Navy and Interior are not of much account
and it does not make much differenc
whether any change is made in them or not

the prisoners letter, is the Washington cor

Upon hearing of the shooting and the allu
sion made to him in the prisoners papers
Mr.. Andrews reported to police headquai
feet that he never heard of nor met Guitea
until he saw him under arrest to-day.
The excitement was so intense that fear
we're entertained by the authorities that
attempt would be made to lynch the prlt
oner, and it was decided to remove him t
the District Jail. Application was made fo
military assistance TO be ready in case 9

Secretary Lincoln, General Sherman order
ed out three companies of United States al
tilery from the arsenal, one company bein
mounted as cavalry and two serving as il
fautry. One mounted and one foot com
pany were stationed about the White Hous
and grounds and one was stationed at til
Jail. The District militia were also ordere
to hold themselves in readiness, and re
mained under arms at their armories all day
After the President had been made a
comfortable as possible in his chamber a

Mrs. Garfield, which was the first one sen
after his arrival 1t read as follows:

 Both branches of the General Assembly met at 12 o'clock m. to-day, and proceeded to dispose of the business before them, which consisted principally in the reference of peti- tions and bills for public acts. The atten- dance of New Haven members of the 'GThird House"" was not as large to-day as usual, al- though there were few representatives of this body present both from New Haven and East Haven. They were principally inter ested in the proposed law regarding the ex- pense of building and maintaining bridges between adjoining towns. and providing that the expense shall be borne pre-rata, according to the grand list valuation of towns. Of course East Haven is anxious to have the proposed amendment become law, and New Haven is equally anxious that the law shall remain as it now is which divides the bur- dens equally

 SANTA FE, Feb. 1.-Sherif Armayo, upon receipt of news that a man named Escalisteo Piuer had been implicated in the murder of Colonel Potter, who was employed by the Interior department to collect mining statis- tics for the census bureau, sent two men and arrested him at Isleta, fifteen miles from Albuquerque. He denied any. knowledge of the murder and felt affronted at the sheriff when he stated that which he said had been related to him by one of the D arties to the murder. He was placed inrjail and securely guarded as it was determined to lynch him on the following day. The sheriff with six armed men, and accompanied by F. c. Van Zandt, Colonel Potter's intimate and faithful friend, started for the place where the body of Colonel Potter was left. About twenty five miles from Albuquerque they left the road and following the trail came upon the body and two horses, one Colonel Potter's, the other one of the robbers. A pile of ashes and half burnt brush was designated by Els calisteo as containing the remains of the murdered man, and search being begun few bones, some scraps of clothes and a num- Der of peculiar buttons were found. The latter were identified by Van Zandt as be- longing to Colonel Potter.

 Colonel Potter drew his weapon and shot one of his assailants in the arm. The second shot took effect in Potter's breast and his re- turn fire killed the horse of one of the rob- bers. Potter's horse then fell dead from a bullet, and few seconds later was followed by his unfortunate master. The bandits af- ter ridding the body of all but the clothes they being too bloody to safely take, covered it with brush which they fired in order to de- stroy all trace of their crime. Further in- quiry elicited the fact that the assailants of Colonel Potter were burrowing in the noun tains not far from the spot of the murder, and the party at once SUIT ounded the1r house, effecting their capture, and by the same means that had been employed in the instance of Escalisteo produced confrma- tory confession from them, with additional information that the robber who had been wounded by Potter was no less a parsonage than Marine Leyber. He had been known to have presented watch to Pinhetton Mira while being absent month ago at Bernalsto on charge of murder and theft. This watch answered the description of the one worn by Colonel Potter, and the fact of Marines ap- bearing at the same time. with a wounded arm, which on inquiry he ascribed to fall from his horse, convicts him in the mind of all men as one of Potter's murderers. The watch was traced from the hands of Mira to 8 pawnbroker in Albuquerque, but the case had already been melted when demand for it was made by the sheriff."

met Thnrpday morning. there was . rumor
that he fnal adjournment would be reached
today, and the adoption Of resolution ior
the payment of extra compensation to the
pages and other employees, served to
strengthen that impression.


On motion of MIR. Ingalls,, resoiuf1on
vas adopted continuing the recess Of the
Senate by the authority conferred upon u for
the committee on judiciary to examine the
subject of bankruptcy, and desiring the COM
mittee to report in December.


Mr. Allison offered a resolution authoriz-

ordered as to the disbursements of the con-
tingent fund, aud other expenses of the vari-
Gus departments of the Senate. Laid over
for the present.


Mr.. Morrill, offered a resolution directing
the committee on public buildings and
grounds, TO inquire into the expediency of pro-
vidinz some means for the immediate re-
moval of the depot and tracks of the Balti-
more & Potomac railroad. and for the remov-
al OF the Baltimore & Ohio depot in Wash
ington Laid over for the present


On motion the authority conferred upon
the committee on public lands to inquire into
the condition of the Land Office, was con-
tinued for the recess.


There was laid before the Senate COM
munication from Gov. Colquitt of Georgia,
rendering to the members of the Senate, the
cordial invitation of the officers and execu-
tive committee of Cotton Exposition, to visit
the exposition now being held at Atlanta, Ga
Laid on the table and ordered printed.


The Senate at 1925, went into executive
session.


The Senate remained in executive session
until 5 so, when the doors opened and the
Senate adjourned until tomorrow.


Shortly after going into executive session,
the Senate took a recess for one hour. to en-
able the various committees to consider the
nominations received this morning, and re-
port today.


The Senate before the recess was taken,
confirmed the nomination of Charles Seaton,
of New York, to be supervisor of the census


Folger, James and Hatton were confirmed
without debate or opposition Immediately
upon their being reported back from the
committees to which, as a matter of form,
they had been referred.


The days session was prolonged, however,
until six O'Clock in the evening by an ami
mated contest over the nomination of Clifford
Strathem, .'readjuster'' of democratic ante
cends, postmaster at Linchburg, Va, vice
republican incumbent, wose term Of office
expires on prox. His confirmation was
earnestly opposed by the democratic senators
on the grounds that Wilson was a gallant
Union soldier, severely wounded in the
war; that business men are entire
ly satisfied with his administration as
in the postoffice. and that the proposed ap-
pointment of Stratham, an active supporter
of Senator Malone, is an admirable attempt
to influence the issue of state political con-
test by Federal patronage. 1t was replied
by the chairman of the postofice committee,
(Ferry), that the recent investigations by
special agents of the postotfice department,
show that Wilson has been short in his ac-
counts at three different periods. That his
use of government money for private pur-
poses, subsequently made good the amount,
was gross dereliction of duty, if not an
actual defalcation, and fully warrants his
displacement. That Stratham's appointment
is recommended with great unanimity by the
republicans of Lynchburg. and that the
objection based on Federal interference with
politics is slander and unworthy of considera-
ton.


1t is believed by many that similar resist
ance to final action on this nomination will
be extended to the democratic members of
the Senate until the close of the present ses-
sion, unless in the meantime it shall be as
certaned that Senator Davis will vote with
them. which event Gf party lines are per-
sistently maintained in regard to it) the NOM
ination will be lost by tie vote."

 Steamboat Accident

 RocK ISLAND, H., October 27.-The steamer Jennie Gilchrist left here this evening with l3 passengers and 16 men of the crew on board. After passing the bridge about a mile, the engineer dis covered that the cam rod by which the wheel reversed was broken. The ma chinery stopped and the boat began to drift helFlessly down the current towards the bridge. The passengers and crew were theoretically notified of the accident and great confusion and excitement fol- lowed, during which the pilot abandon ed the wheel-house and attempted to save himself Every passenger was wild with terror and perfectly helpless, and the crew, with the exception of several officers, were said to have been drunk In the meantime the steamer struck the stone pier of the bridge Just as the

  lision, great quantities of steam escaped, scalding n number of persons horribly. After striking, tlle steamer swung around and tloated clear, but Tn sinking con- ditiOn. Eight persons managed to take refuge on barge and were saved, The alarm was quickly given and the steamer Evansville came to the rescue. A num- Der were taken of, but seventeen per sons are missing who have doubtless perished. It Is claimed that the acci- dent was entirely due to carelessness and liquor. The names of those lost have not been obtained.

was contemplated ~ possible. and that they
were expected 10 forward II satisfactory settle
mcnt of tho quarrel between the two
republics without hurting the feelings or
alternating the friendship of either Their in

due 70 their utter lack of fitness for the busi

The death of General Fitzpatrick was of course
not known at the time the letter to him was
written, but its publication is essential to a
knowledge OF the view taken 10y the State De-
partment of his course. which was partisan TO
excess, and calculated to make the Chilians
think the United States did not know its own
mind or was dishonesty ready 10 blow
hot and cold upon the same question from
its mouthpieces at Lima and Santiago.
General IIurlbut il ccnsurcd for nearly every
tiing he has done since hG set foot in Peru.
He is told that he had no business answering
Pierola because he was accredited 10 Cadrron
and had nothing 10 do with a rival Govern
ment; that he had no right to carry
on diplomatic correspondence with Admiral
Lynch the Chilian commander because
he was Minister 10 Peru and not TO
Chill; that he seriously msrcprcscntcI the
part of his instructions only, and omitting the
portion which contemplated ccsslon of terri
tory as n possible necessary result of the war +;
that hs intimatiOn that he was accredited to
CalderOn because CalderOn would not consent
TO n cession of territory was gross bunder
that his telegram to the American Minister 10
the Argentine Republic suggesting that that
Rcpublic send a Minister to Peru was an mex
cusable error, from the fact that IT had the
appearance of seeking to form combination
hostile to Chill and that his negotiations for
n naval station in Peru were inopportnue and
calculated to increase Chilan distrust.


A longer list of grave mistakes was. we
imagine, never laid at the door of
Minister of less than six months
service In fact, everything General Hurbut
has done in Peru seems to be blunder We
should be tempted to ask why he stays at
Lima if we were not informed by Mr.. Blaine's


letter that his functions are practically sus-


rended and placed in the hands Of the special
Jiplomatic commission now on its way to Peru

 A banking house of Lynchburg, Virginia, has issued a circular concerning the public debt of the State which is attracting the atten- ton of bondholders and others. This house takes the ground that the success of the Re adjusters makes the repudiation of large part of the debt inevitable. The Riddleber- ger bill, they believe, will be 8 law before the close of January, 1882, at least in all it's sub stantial features. Their circular states that the following will be the scale of funding the present debt: The per cent. consols, with tax-receivable coupons, now selling at 77, will be fundable into per cent. bonds at 53 cents on the dollar; the 1O-4Os, with tax-re, ceivable coupons, now selling at AZ, will be fundable into 5. per cents. at B cents on the dollar; the ''peelers, :"" without tax receivable coupons, now selling at Al, will be fundable at 66 ? cents on the dollar; the past-due speeler"" coupons, now selling at 26, will be fundable in per cent bonds at 60 cents on the dollar, whilst the unfunded debt will be funded at one-third of principal and 40 per i. nn II. .Iyo. value of the new 3s, Messrs.

were fearlessly maintained by their new
white friends, and the Bourbon Democ-
racy went down before the Liberal
movement. The temporary separation
of the races in the presidential campaign
caused no alienation. The defiant atti-
tude of MALONE toward the Bourbons

lied all of his supporters of 1870,
as well the white Readiuster Democrats

| State convention of the colored men de-
clared him their leader and sent depu-
tation to the President with the informa-

! Republican element of the State is for
the Readjusters. A few hide-bound parti-
sans, calling themselves Straight-O Out
Republicans"" have strained every nerve
TO carry the elections for delegates to the
Lynchburg convention who would be
hostile to the Readjuster ticket. They
have succeeded in clecting few regular
delegates, but it long ago became appar-


ent that the Republican party was over
whelmingly in favor of coalition with
the Readjusters by indorsing their ticket.
The Straight-Out faction has resorted to
the tactics familiar to all who have seen
the organized work of disorganizers.
These have cropped out in boiling from


local committees, separate elections of
pretended delegates by the little squad of
-Coalitionists to be found in most
counties, and, finally, arlear intention to
hold n convention of their bogus dele
gates at Lynchburg on the same day of
the regular convention of the party. If
those counties only in which the Coali-
tionists have prevailed are to be con-
tested, and if the contestants are TO be
ruled out from voting for a chairman, then
the few uncontested counties in which
the Straight-Outs have prevailed will do
all the preliminary voting, by which the
organization and the settlement Of con-
tests are to be decided. But if The


Straight-Outs find contestants fer heii


seats also, then there would be no un-
contested delegates to do any voting
at all, and the two factions would from
the outset separate into two bodies.


mittee, in calling the convention to order
and putting the vote on temporary Or
gani zation, and in forming the commit
tees, has great power. 1t is to be pre-
sumed that he will use it to ascertain the
will of the delegates well known to be


regularly elected. This he can only do
; by making up a list of such delegates
, ign oring, of course, irregular claimants
! chosen by unauthorized constituencies
II would avoid much confusion if this


were all determined in advance. This
could easily be done by the
preparation of true list of delegates, UNI


der the authority of any members of the
State committee, and the submission OF
the same to the chairman, to be revised
and corrected by him. If he disapproved
because sham contests were not recog-
nized, then the regular delegates could
consult in advance and be called to order
by some member of the State committee
in whom they had confidence. Only by
confusing tricks and desperate methods
can the insignificant minority of Virginia


Straight-Out Republican Bourbons even

 WASHINGTON Oct. 3O.-The special session of the Senate called by President Arthur to begin on Monday, Oct. 10, came to an end yesterday, with the contest over the postmas- tership at Lynohburg, Va, which had as- sumed character that seemed to threaten a deadlock, left unfinished. There had latterly been growing a spirit of impatience among the Senators over the long drawn out session which at its opening promised to be brief and unimportant, and it had become plainly evident that however anxious some might be to hold out in their views on the vexed ques- tion, many of the Senators had resolved to force final adjournment. Among the Re- publicans especially was the desire for ad- journment overpowering, and accordingly the Republican caucus held yesterday morn ing instructed Senator Ferry, chairman of the Committee on Postoffices and Post Roads, to invite Senator Mahone to foin with him in request to President Arthur to recall the nomination of MT. Stratham for postmaster at Lynchburg. The President, on.the re- quest being made to him, positively refused to accede, which being reported to the Sen ate, motion by the Republicans to lay aside consideration of this case was adopted and the Senate proceeded to confirm other nomi- nations. At 40 Senators Sherman and Bayard as committee reported to the Senate that the President had no further communi- cation to make to that body and adjourn ment sine die soon followed Of the nomina- tions considered by the Senate all but

 five or six were confirmed. Those of importance objected to and not confirmed are MT. Stratham for postmaster at Lynch burg, Va. Jacob Steinmeyer for postmaster at Jefferson City, Mo, and Pay Inspector Watmough for paymaster general of the navy It is generally believed, however, that Presi- dent Arthur will remove Wilson, the present postmaster at Lynchburg, and appoint Strat- ham in his place. Wilson has been derelict in his accounts of late, having been backward in making returns of moneys due and the Pres ident has therefore power to remove, which it is conceded he will do at once. In this view the Democrats can hardly claim vic tory in having succeeded in their purpose of defeating the confirmation of Strathana. Its influence on the political campaign in Vir- ginia which will be decided next week. can- not yet be determined, but it will be watched with interest by all who have followed the politics of the Bourbon State.

 More than half the Senators started for home last night, among them Senators Flaw ley and Platt. Vice President Davis started for Illinois tonight, happy as ever in his life. Senator Brown, of Georgia, is still with hic for11i1y xriI1 the recess. Senators Call, Crockett and Fer ry left to-day. Senator Allison goes West to morrow and will return about November 15. Senator Conger will keep his family here and go home for few days. Senator Hampton will make a speaking tour in Mississippi during November Senator Ma hone keeps his headquarters here for the present. Senator Bayard will go homo to- as will also Mir. Sherman Ben Hill will go to Philadelphia before going South. Senators Miller and Lapham, of New York, will remain here day or two. The number of Senators remaining here all through the recess will be less than dozen

 The few Senators remaining in the city con graduated themselves and think the country should be congratulated on the fact that the special session of the Senate was so soon concluded and that without serious differ

 nee. Beyond the election of President pro tzno and the confirmation of the Presi dents appointments little was done and there was not much to be done. The committees are also to have an earnest consideration during the recess and the redemption of the flats is expected to be pushed strenuously before another adjournment. With the de- parture of most of the Senators and the President also affairs at the capital may be expected to become very quiet. President Arthur ex- poets to go to New York on Wednesday eJox of4 remain until after the State election Before he goes he has some official matters to attend to, principally the issuance of commissions It is also expected that he will appoint his nominees for postmasterships who died with the Senatcs session. Among these is that of Stratham of Lynchburg, whose name caused such fight in executive session

 Cabinet gossips have ceased from troubling MacVeagh, who is in New York, being still Attorney General, but Solicitor General Phil lips is doing his work and will probably con tinue so to do until the Star route matters end and Howe can be appointed. Lincoln, James and Hunt are expected to stay right along, though the latter may be replaced by Senator Sargent in December so that MT. Kirkwood, for whom the Iowa people here now are fighting, may be allowed to remain. Blaine expects to be succeeded in December by Frehnghuysen. Thus do Cabinet matters stand according to general belief.

 The Democratic resolution for the investiga- ton of several departments of the govern ment pressages busy wintersession Among other matters foreshadowed by this session is the expected contest in regard to the alleged Italian brigand Esposito, whose course Sena- tor Kellogg will espouse, and who claims to have the best citizens of New Orleans with him against his unprecedent arrest and nal treatment. Senator Kellogg says the case is infamous and shall be sifted to the hotf0Dn Tha cr1h T1li are to sit during the recess on bankruptcy mat ters. The Potomac river improvements committee will also have an extensive hear ing.

 On account of the absence of Messrs. Bliss and Cook, special government counsel for the Star route matters, it is impossible to say if ar gument will be made before the criminal co urt to morrow. It is expected, however, tn at the defense will call the case up, and tn at day will be assigned for argument,

 THE FOREIGN PRESS.

 The entire provincial press of Itally irrespec- tive of party, expresses deep regret and sympathy with the United States.

 Ia France protests against Russian newspapers comparing the attempt on Garfeld's life. which was common, low crime, to political attempts at

 The Liverpool Post says. The world holds it's breath at the development of the fatal homicidal maniac which has in so many directions en, life We learn from this dire event that lands where the popular voice selects their rulers are as accessible others to this foul contagion In the present case there appears to be no excuse or theory forthcoming We may be sure even O'Donovan Rossa will not attempt to boast fthis deed. Abraham Lincoln's assassination might be considered the degraded outcome of the civil war, but none but lunatic could grudge Garfield his wellwon laurels.

 The leading Russian newspapers express con sternation at the attempted assassination. The Go0s says it believes the act was due to personal vengeance, but should the facts show political reasons it would be necessary to again bring into prominence the question of the adoption of meas ures against the attempts of political assassins.

 The Toronto Globe, in an article on the shooting of President Garfield. says such deed can not be without far-reaching and most potent results. In one respect it is of infinitely greater consequence than was the murder of Lincoln, for his life's work was virtually done-Garfeld was at the threshold of his work when the madman, Guiteau, assaulted him. Were it not for the fact that Gui-

 eau is clearly irresponsible for his acts if 1t were possible to assign great political importance to the assassination, we should tremble for the fu- ture of the republic but while everybody will be chilled with horror at the senseless deed every body will soon recognize that Garfield's death will prove nothing but the depth of mans weak ness and brutality.

 The Vienna newspapers agree in regarding the crime as unpolitical, although it may be indi- rectly the outcome of Garfeld's opposition to the corrupt rings, All paoers speak eulogistically of the Presidents personal qualities.

 The Manchester, England, Gudrdidn dismisses the idea of political conspiracy in the United States, and says American politicians have not come to the point of employing assassins. It seems quite sufficiently made out that Guiteau was nothing more nor less than disappointed If President Garfield dies 1t will leave q gap hard to fill.

 GuITEAU's LUNAcY.

 Guiteau is still kept closely confined, nobody Is allowed to see him except officials. All stories about accomplices and about men having been seen with him have been proved to be false. All have been traced to irresponsible parties seeking It Is plain and can be accepted as a final fact that the assassin acted alone and never communicated by even hint his purpose to any one. Detectives who have visited him in prison say he is crazy The people generally will not ac eept this theory and M there is a general demand Should the plea of insanity be set up 1t would cause great indignation here. especially if there should be any signs of Guiteau escaping punish ment. There is talk of lynching should the in sanity dodge be played.

 Guiteau the assassin, figured in Hartford during the Moody and sankey revival, four years ago sitting on the platform with the speakers and local clergymen.

cured under all surrounding circum-
stances. And this is exactly The case
with the City Council since the Demo-
crats have had the control of that body.


1t has done the best for the interests of
the city that it could do amid conflict
ing interests. In many Instances
where the members of the Democratic
party might perhaps have come to
different conclusions they were op.
posed by the Republican members not
because the measures were not proper,

our readers infer that we are blind to
errors, or that all of the actions taken


by Council were precisely right. But
We think that the present Council
nave made as few errors as any pre-
vious one. In fact it has had more
difficult matters TO contend with. and
70 FAR has done so well that there has
been no real objection raised to it's acts
where at the Sc me time modes were
pointed out and made to appear better

The Republican for over two years
founded its greatest objection to the
Democratic Counci on the measure of
economy which they adopted, the de-
crease OF the tax rate. 1t declared
over and over again that it was i'm

cost OF building a road to the Dela.

and enlarging others, and opening ana

increase Vi the tax rate. But the fact |
that the Democrats have conducteo
the city government for two or three |
years on q tax rate which our neiehbor
declared TO be entirely too low becanse

PLATFORM.


The Republicans Of Virginia. by their duly ap-
pointed delegates, in convention assembled. do re-
solve;


Flrst-That the Bourbon Democratic party of
Virginia, by Us most recent official utterances has
shown that II Is still ase TO Its professions respect.
Ing the credit Of the State ana that II again seeks
10 deceive both the people and creditors by means
of fair promises, which past experience teaches us
Il never intends 10 mG


Second-That the Bourbon Democratic party of
Virginia Is now ever IN lis past history, opposed
10 the true Interests and welfare Of the people,
opposed to free and fair elections, and an honest
count, ms evidenced by their determination TO up.
hold the uurepublican and undemocratic law
which requires the payment OF the capiRtion tax
as prerequisite to the exercise of the right Of
suffrage and opposed TO free schools for the edu.
cation of the children Of al the people


Third-That the anti. Bourbon or Liberal party
has shown by its acts, since II obtained con-
troll Of the Legislature and partial control Of the
State government the sincerity Of its professions
in favor Of the faithful collection and honest ex-
pendlture of the public revenues as designed by
the constitution and laws Of the State in favor OF
fair and free elections; In favor of impartial
juries and the impartial execution Of the laws,
and in favor Of public education.


Fourth-That in view OF this condition of fpoliti-
cal affairs, and Nbntlng no part Of our determina'
tiOn TO deal justly with the creditors Of Virginia,
and 10 labor 10 pay every dollar that she honestly
owes, we deem 1t incXpedicnt and unwise to make
separate party nominations for States Offices and
we declare in favor Of hearty cooperation with
all other citizens in support Of the candidates
nominated by the anti. Bourbon or Liberal con.
yention held in the city Of Richmond June 2 and
3, 1881.


Flnh-That, as Republicans, we earnestly invite

 that We observe the growing popular ity of Judge Lynch in our State. Ills

 visits are becoming so frequent as to excite solicitude in the breast of all

 good citizens. Week before last his terrible power was exevted upon a

 victim in Jackson county. and also in Yell county his swift judgement

 was visited upon two. We are not thoroughly posted as to the details of the crimes charged against any of the parties, but do not think from our information that they were of that aggravated form which somehow or other it meets wilh partial public ! favor to visit with such swift and condign punishment outside the ! forms of Jaw.

 It has never been cradicatei from the minds Of the people to wrcak vengeance upon certain base and wicked crimes committed in their midst, but in our country the exer- ciss of this frightful power has been principally confined to the few cases that shock public morals and ont. rage the principles of virtue. The cases before us are exceptions to this rule. They fell in the line oi mur- der--a crime which is dark and wicked, t is true, but one which has always been accorded hearing and final adjudication in the courts, and we know of nothing in any of these cases that would take them out of the line of crimes of this sorJ. The inquiry then arises, what is the mat ter, and where is the trouble?

 Is toe fault with the people? We are 10th to believe it. They have possibly allowed themselves to some extent to be thrown into state of solicitude 5y the tardiness of justice in our courts in which they have come to think that public safety hes in their dealing out to criminals that which lies in the jurisdicton of courts to give, but which they have been so prone of late to escape What the people want, and what they demand. is that CRIME SHALL BE PUNISHED. And we look upon these oc- eurrences not so much as a spirit O. mob law, as ar attestation of this def mand. The heavy cost of criminal prosecution, the en dless delays of justice and the final escape of the criminal, have conspired to make justice byword aad punishment for crime . mockery. In this state of the case, much as we may regret it, it IS not surprising shat occasional. ly the feeling should show itself be- yond the limits of prudence, to GU force obedience to the demand that the law must be enforced.

 It's an unpleasant sentence to write in which responsibility tor this state of feeling is placed anywhere, and especially with those in whose hands is the administration of law. We think, however, that VIC take no risk in the proposition that with vigorous, speedy and certain execu. tion of the law, our eyes would never have seen the particulars of these occurrences"

ed upon the principles of Unity,
Friendship and True Christian Char
acter. Their number in the United
States and Canadas run up into the
millions, while their treasury receipts
footed up last May about $Ia,75o, 900.

The seventeenth of March, St.
Patrick's day, is always gala day
among all ""true born Irishmen,"" and
more especially by the Hibernia So
ciety. They most always celebrate IN
a body by making parade during the
day, and in the evening with ball OF
other social entertainment of some
kind.


On last Thursday evening, per invi-
tation of the Society of the Ancient
Order of Hibernia, we visited the Elk
Mountain Hotel, land when ye reporter
and his compagu0n arrived about eight
O'Clock in the evening, he found the
seats at the tables in the spacious dining
hall nearly all occupied, and we were
compelled to remain in the Office until
]. M. McCormick's left optical rested
upon our hungry countenance. He
thereupon invited us in, stating that
there was always room for more, and
seated us among what to all appear
ances appeared to be lot of bonanza
kings or New York capitalists, but on
second look we recognized nearly all
of them as familiar faces, and among
them we noticed men of all the differ
ent avocations of life that 60 to make
up busy and thrifty mining town, as
for instance there was the miner and
mine owner, the lawyers and doctors,
the merchants and mechanics, the
mine brokers and spectators, all very
busily engaged in manipulating lot
of dinner dishes, while the contents
grew beautiful and rapidly less.


After becoming reconciled from our
gaze upon the assembly long enough
to be waited upon, bill of fare was
place before us and at the same time
we said ""no"" to an inquiry as to
whether we would have soup. In the
meantime we read the menu through
from beginning to end, and then
thinking that we did not know any
more what we wanted than before, we
told the waiter to bring us something
to fill up hungry man. The waiter
took in the situation and brought us
supper that would have done credit
to metropolitan hotel.


The supper being finished the guests
were supplied with sufficient amount
of glassware, when the champagne be-
gan to pop. The balance of the
evening was spent in drinking toest,
speech-making and singing. Every
body seemed to enjoy themselves in
manner that was commendable to the
occasion, especially after they had
been drinking wine about half hour.
Charley Brann made speech referring
to the jollity of the occasion said that
while we were enjoying all the bless
ings Of life apparently, the brother
countrymen Of the Hibernia Society
across the sea were suffering want and
oppression. He also spoke of the
tyranny of Alexander H., Gar of Rus
sia, of whose assassination we had lust
learned by telegraph. He then re-
ferred to the glorious liberty of this
country, and that on these OCCASIONS
of enjoyment and revelry we should
not forget to respond and aid the sut-
fering brethren in foreign land.


Speeches and songs were also in
dulged in by Messrs. Maloney, Lynch,
Connolly, Deacy, Stevens, Selig, and
a number of Others. Mr.. Heilegers
sang an Irish song in German, while
Dick Roelf sang a German song."

He Turns the Tables on His Accuser
Before the Investigating Com",,"ShoA 2Co uSuiuot IoITe6J commissioner
Lewis p. Lynch, held another meet
lag last night, which resulted LARGELY
to the benefit of the accused official.


Martin Glenn, a street Departs
ment empl0ye, testified that he help
ed the Street Commissioner for a few
minutes early one morning last win
ter, to shovel snow from bis pave
ment. The service, however, occupied
but fewImlnutes and he did days
work on the streets as usual.


Patrick Gardner, who was present
attempted to question this witness,
but Glenn curtly ard positively re-
fused to have any thing to say to
him.


Charles Stewart, of No. 705 West
Front street, testified that as Front
street was being cleaned, last spring
he applied to the man who was point
ed out to him as the ""boss,"" and
bought several loads Of street dirt
from him. The man wanted fifty
cents load, but be declined to pay
this price and offered twenty-five
cents, which offer was accepted. Mr..
Stewart said he did not know the man
he bought the dirt from but it was
not the Street Commissioner.


Jacob Pusey testified that he asked
Mr.. Lynch for some dirt, one day,
saying he would haul it away at his
own expense. The Street Commis.
sioner told him he csuld have what
he wanted,and he took several loads.
Nothing was said about money, and
he offered no pay for the dirt, as he
did not consider it was to be paid
for.


The Street Commission freely
admitted that he allowed Mr.. Pusey,
to take the dirt as it saved the city
that much expense of hauling.


Patrick Ryan and Michael Daley,
Street Department employees, said
they never knew the Commissioners
to sell the street dirt. Mr.. Daley
volunteered the information that he
had worked under other Street Com
missioners, and never knew any of
them to get as.much work out of the
same number of men as Mr.. Lynch
did. He also never saw Mr.. Lynch
come around among the men in any
way affected by drink, and that he
believed HIM to be an honest man.
In his opinion there was a great deal
said against Mr.. Lynch that was en-
tirely false.


John Carney, John Baker and Owen
Marlowe, gave similar testimony. The
latter said that Gardner told him on
- hat he l.;
days wages II he would swear to a GER
tam thing, Shut he replied that he would
not d--n bis soul for the likes of Gard
ner.""


Being pressed to tell what the seer
tain thing"" was, Owen said Gardner
offered him $5 if he would swear that be
saw Lynch sell some street dirt. The
offer was made at Third and Orange
streets.


Gardner vehemently denied this ac-
cusation and said Owen was perjarer,
but Owen stoutly insisted upon the Truth
of his testimony.


Thos. Dougherty said he never knsw
Lynch to sell any dirt, but he saw Gard
ner sell q load one afternoon, and get
fifty cents for il.


This witness went on to state that
Gardner had borrowed about twenty five
cents from him, and never repaid it,
which allegation Gardner vebemently
denied, saying that Dongherty was
""swearing black and blue"" ""On, mo-
body'd believe your oath,"" said the wit
ness, ss,contempluonsly,as be left the Coun-
Gil chamber.


Hugh Mcguire and Neil Mooney, also
said they never knew Mr.. Lynch TO sell
any dirt.


David Whiteraft, who drives cart in
the Street Department, SAID he bauled
dirt to the Swan Hotel, Hunts dog
pound aud the Delaware House,at Gard
ner's order. He finally refused to haul
any more to the latter place, whereupon
Gardner got mad and swore at him.


81 don't deny that, gentlemen"" said
Gardner.


""You can't deny 1t, said Whitcrsft,
""for you made me haul il;you know you
sold It,""


At the request of the committee the
Street Commissioner made a statement,
under oath. AS he was being sworn by
Esquire O'Neill, he remarked, 81 know
the nSture OF an oath, and that's more
than that man does"" indicating Card
ner by a motion OF his hand.


Nr. Lynch was first asked il he had
ever received any money from Patrick
Gaidner tor the sale OF dirt.


""Not one cent, SO help me, God"" was
the reply. He then said the only money
| he ever received from Gardner was what
the latter borrowed oi him occasionally.
| He never knew Garduer to sell the
street dirt. .bnt when 1t was reported that
he was selling 1t, Gardner derided the
accusation and wanted to swear to his
denial. He said be gave John Dunn an
order for several loads of dirt and told
him to pay the Street Commissioner. He
never got cent of the money Dunn
p aid to Gardner.


Mr.. Lynch said that on account oi
the trouble and slight RECOMMENDATION to
the city, he had always Except In the
case of Mr.. Dunn, who was very per
sistent IN his application) refused te
sell the street dirt, but he always al
lowed parties who would haul it away

Attempt TO Hang Man Because he
Was Poor and Out of


Money.",,"A mob of self constituted vigilantes
elated with the Immunity allowed
them in the case of emasculating q
lecherous tramp, whose punishment,
although barbarous and illegal. was
regarded by all as just, seem to have
usurped the functions of the legal
authorities and have undertaken to
run the town on the code of Judge
Lynch. Last Monday night this mob
seized an unfortunate man named
Daniel Hamlin,, hailing from Boston
Mass, who y as charged with no
crime or offensc other than that he
was out of work and out of money,
put rope around his neck and gave
him couple of hoists on cotton
wood tree. They then asked for his
past history, which he told in such n
simple manner that they concluded to
town. This he did, but being con-
scious of having committed no crime,
he returned the next day to see if he
could recognize his prosecutors. As
they were masked he was unable to
do SO. This is simply an infamous
outrage on an unfortunate man. In
relation to it the Reporter of this city
makes the following serious charge
against our chief.o police:


THAT the policeman was fully cog
nizant of this affair before and at the
time it happened we can substantiate
beyond a doubt, as we have the state
ment OF several men who will affirm
that the above officer came to them on
Monday evening and said, 'Don't go
to bed yet and you will see some fun, Z""
telling them what was going to be
done""


Our city authorities owe 1t to
themselves. and to the fair name and
credit of the citizens whose lives and
property are in the keeping of the po-
lice, to probe this matter TO the bot
tom and let no guilty man escape.
The charge OF the Reporter is direct
and positive. and there is no escaping
the issue."

 The Dardanelle Arkansian, after giving detailed statement of the lynching of J. F. Holland at that town, says:

 With these facts we do not believe any citizen of Dardsnelles had any hand in the matter, and scarcely think any of our county had any part or lot in the affair, because very few knew of the coming of the pris- oner and no time was had to organ ize to do the work here""

dizementwhichis strikingly at variance with
the professions put forward by her when
she went to war with Peru. She has her.
self destroyed the Peruvian Government,
and in doing so appears to have thrown the
country back into almost state of nature.
Society seems to have dissolved as well as
government, and thus an excuse is evolved
for the rearrangement of the Chilean pro-
gramme, which now takes the form of
scarcely disguised purpose to annex
Peruvian territory in masses, if not to
seize the whole country. 1t is of course
very difficult to get at the rights of such
matter, but the action of Admiral Lynch
in overthrowing the Calderon Govern
ment can only be regarded as indicating
purpose to discountenance any effort to
establish stable Peruvian Government,
save on the condition that it is willing to
indorse Chilean annexation. As has been
remarked by an Eastern paper, this
is pretty much the same as though
Germany had refused to allow France to
establish Government until one could be
found that would sanction the surrender of
Alsace and Lorraine Chile has the power
to enforce her terms, odious as they may
be to the conquered nation. It is true she
is exercising right such as no belligerent

has ever assumed the right to exercise be-
fore, and that it is a cruel and most bar
barous programme. But unless the United
States interferes to save Peru from being
utterly crushed by her half-savage con-
queror, it is only too clear that the present
state of anarchy in Peru will be made the
justification for the military occupation of
the whole country. As to the anarchy, it
is perhaps after all not very much more
serious than what hefell some of the re-
moter parts of France during the latter
part of the war with Germany. At all
events when an enemy destroys the Gov
ernment of country, and refuses to per-
NIT new one to be set up, he at least is
estopped from pretending that the resulting
confusion has no connection with his own

 -Tronson and Fritz, of Red Hook, N Y. have opened shad market under the Stevens House, next door to Ovid Gillett's, and with peddling wagon on the road, make the shad fly, (6guratively, of course.) If our people don't get all the shad they want this season, it will be because there isn't enough in the Hudson river

 1t may not be generally known that there is public bath room in town; but there is, nevertheless at the Stevens House con- veniently arranged bath room, with all the necessary fixtures, hot and cold water, etc where baths can be had for 25 cents, and as it is great convenience it will undoubtedly be extensively patror.ized during the summer months.

 Mrs. W. A. Mackey was agreeably sur prised last Thursday on receiving from the express office package, which was found, on opening, to contain magnificent silk dress, trimmings, etc. complete.

identify the goods and prisoners. Hen
Erickson at once stated that the goods
were not his. Lynch said he was not
sure whether he could identify the men
after he did see them, but went to the
lookup and looked at them carefully.
He said the only resemblance WIS the
light pants the two men wore. The
men were locked up late to-day in the

reward of one thousand dollars has
been offered by the Council of McKees-

from Little Rock, Ark, says that infor-
nation has been received of the lynch-
ing of four negroes implicated in the
murder Of Miss Mary Ishmael, near

gang of masked men, variously esti-
mated from two to three hundred. The
lynchers sprang out of the woods, sur
rounded the building where the negroes
had been temporarily placed, Overpow-
cred the guards, and taking the pris-
oners hanged them to a tree near by
and dispersed as silently and as quickly
as they had gathered. 1t is claimed
that prior to the execution the negroes
made full confession, giving a de-
tailed account of the crime, alleging
that Miss Ishmael was killed for re-
fusing to disclose the hiding-place of a
large sum of money which her father
had received a few days before the
tragedy occurred The lynching has
intensified the excitement in the neigh

was a beautiful girl of IS, and had been
left alone in the house during the alb

found dead and her body horribly

It would require ths President to be almost completely wrapped l up in wires and would take long time tc get the desired effect; and even then it could not be regarded as certain in its operation.

 A DECISIVE BULLETIN IN PROSPECT.

 Dr. Bliss said this afternoon that if the President kept in the condition he is now ir for three days longer, they would issue ar official bulletin declaring that his recovery is | almost certain. To-day was the first time that it has been officially declared that the l President re1ished his food and it is true I and besides, it is regarded as most encour- aging.

 1 TESTING GUIrEAU's STATEMENT. Had Guiteau shot the President at church, as he first intended, he could have put the pistol to his head from outside of the win | dow. An examination was made of the place to-day, and it was found that Guiteau could have gotten within three feet of where the President usually sat. Sticking his arm in | the window his face could not be seen by 1 anyone in the church.

 | ENCOURAGING NEWS FROM THE SICK ROOM. He fell asleep early tonight and was rest I ing quietly at midnight. The Cabinet off, cers spent the evening with Mrs. Garfield as usual Dr. Reyburn encouraged them with the statement that the President was practi- l cally past all danger and gave them some in | teresting facts in the case. Among other things he described the new tube which had been inserted in the.wound. It is of rubber, three-elghths of an inch in diameter, bore one-quarter of an inch. It has been inserted three and and half inches within, showing ] that the wound is probably healing and may yet break. If an abscess should be formed no danger could ensue. If not the tube might be drawn in further. In that case it will not be disturbed, but the physicians have no intention of forcing it in further. 'The tube"" says Dr. Reyburn, ""is doing its work nicely. The blood that has not come from the wound is being absorbed in kind and pyamia is not thus at all expected. Tapping on the patients liver now reveals the fact that the suppression of blood in that organ has ceased"" Dr. Reyburn, speaking of the the- ory that the liver was not lacerated, says he cannot conceive how under the circumstan- ces the liver could have escaped injury. He does not care to enter into 8 discussion of thls feature of the case, being satisfied to know that the case is well in hand and the President is recovering. At midnight the President was still asleep and was passing good night.

 AN EYEWITNESS DESCRIBES THE SHOOTING.

 Senor Cammacho, minister of Venezuela, resident at Washington, went before the dis trict attorney and gave his version of the shooting of President Garfield. He said: ''I was standing within a few feet of the Presi- u. l saw Guiteau before the first shot was fired. He stood directly behind President Garfield and close to him. The pistol was pointed squarely at his back and the muzzle was but few inches away, so it could not possibly miss him. I looked at Guiteau's face. His teeth were clinched and his mouth closed firmly. His eye was steady, and his face presented the appearance of a brave man, de- termined upon desperate deed. When he fired, the President was struck and quivered all over. His eyes closed partially and his joints relaxed. He began to fall forward, and was half down, when Guiteau fired again. I don't think it was over two seconds. The ex- pression upon Guiteau's face had now changed. His calmness had disappeared, and he had the nervous expression of man lest he had failed and wanting to make sure that he had not. He fired wildly this time, and with hurried movement, unlike his previ- ous deliberation. It was the first shot that took effect, the second shot passing over the President as he falling Then some one cried Lynch him. Now the man was a coward. All his determination deserted him; his face blanched like that of corpse and he looked wildly about in terror to make his escape. He trembled with fear; his eyes rolled from side to side, as if he knew not which way to turn. In moment he was seized by several persons, and I saw him no more""

A snacia dasnaIch from Pakin Ill",,"An Illinois Runian Fastens Boy


to the Rails to be Run Over.


A specia despatch from Pekin, ILL.,,
says:


Willie Cantrell, the thirteen-year old
son Of the section superintendent on the
Indiana, Bloomington,a and Western Rail-
road, was sent to a field this afternoon
for potatoes. As be was on his way
home he was met by middle aged man
with blue shirt and smooth face. He
seized the boy, threw him down, aud
with rope tied him to the rails. The
man then secreted himself short dis
tance away. The road here is curved
and has heavy grade. The passenger
train due at 3.42 was upon the boy be-
fore it could be stopped. He was struck
by the side Of the pilot, which broke his
ribs and one foot. As soon rs the train
had passed the murderous ruffian ran to
the boy, evidently expecting to find him
cut In two. But the lad had twisted
himself to one side, and escaped with the
above-named injuries. The man cut
and threw away the rope chat bound
young Cantrell, and then made his es.
cape through corn field. The train
was backed up, and the boy was found
In the ditch, moaning piteously. Several
passengers saw the man 60 up to the boy
after the train had passed over him, and
witnessed his flight. Policemen and
several parties are hunting for the brute,
with the intention of lynching him."

true statement of what occurred in the ward
meetings last night. II remains to be seen whether
you will indorsc the great outrage which your
supporters would inlict upon the Republicans of
Petersburg by having them msrepresented at the
Lynchburg State Convention by delegates opposed
to coalition. You have been here several days;
you are well acquainted with the feeling of the
Republicans Of this city and there is not the least
doubt but that fully eighty per cent. of the Re.
publicans of Petersburg are in favor of sending
delegates to the State convention who will vote
for coalition.

 l Mrs Sarah V White, matron of the ladies waiting room at the depot, then told hel 1 story of the shooting. She saw Guiteau firs second shot The Presidents legs gave l way and he sank down, not falling length wise. She saw Guiteau in the depot half ar hour before the President entered. On the cross examination witness said Guiteau

 walked up and down for long while in the gentlemen's room and always looked into the ladies' room whenever he passed the doors. He seemed to be waiting for some one. He wore slouched hat and it was on his head as it was few minutes ago. Guiteau then put

 his hat on in the way he usually wore it. Witness said, 'sThat's the way"" and Guiteau nodded his head in assent Witness looked carefully at Guiteau and said she did not get good look at him until after the first shot was fired and plainly saw him fire a second. She did not hear him say any, thing. She heard nothing but the cry

 ""Catch him Catch him ID s""That's the man."" Witness pointed out the relative po- sitions of the President and assassin by the aid of 8 diagram.

 The next witness was Robert A. Parks, ticket agent at the depot. While Parks was testifying Secretary Hunt entered and was given a seat beside the judge. MT. Parks testified to having had his attention called to the prisoner in the depot by the noise of the first shot, He distinctly saw Guiteau fire the second shot and said Guiteau then handed him letter saying it was for some general.

 Witness with the assistance of two officers stopped the assassin in his flight. Witness saw the Presidents legs fail him and saw him fall forward at a glance, and then devoted his attention to stopping the assassin. He met Guiteau face to face at the door between the ladies' waiting room and the main wait ing room. On the cross examination witness said there was nothing to have prevented Guiteau from escaping by the B street door if he had made an attempt, but he seemed to desire going the other way. Guiteau again put on his hat, and after he had pulled 1t down near his eyes at Parks request the lat ter said that was the way he then wore 1t. Witness could not recollect the name Of the general Guiteau said the letter was for. The assassin being excited spoke indistinctly at the time and witness heard him say noth- ing else except that he wanted to go to jail Witness kept his hold on Guiteau until officer Kearney took hold of him in the main wait ing room. Witness had not seen Gulteau be- lore the second shot was fired.

 Judson W. Wheeler, the next witness, tes- tifed that the first shot was fired within few inches of his face He say the shooter and was certain it was the prisoner. He saw Gu1- teau advance step or two and fire the sec- ond shot and then saw the President fall. The first shot was fired so close to the face of the witness that he swallowed some smoke emit ted by the pistol, happening as he did to make an inhalation at that time. On the cross examination of eye-wltnesses Scov1lle asked carefully as to how the prisoner looked and acted how the pistol arm was held, which way he ran, who caught him, how he was taken hold of and when and where. Wheeler said he.noticed nothing peculiar about the assassin except that he was very excited and was very anxious to get to the door.

 George A. Adams, president of the Eoen ing Stdr company, Washington, next told what he saw of the shooting It was a short story, including the entry of the President and party to the depot, the firing of the sec- ond shot and the flight of the assassin. On the cross-examination witness said he dld not think the assassin seemed very anxious to get away He did not hear him say any thing except. 'sIt is all right"" He said that several times. He seemed to say this to keep the people quiet. He did not appear much excited He saw no pistol or letter in Guiteau's hand

 Jacob Smith, janitor at the depot, testified that he saw the prisoner standing near the door of the waiting room before the President came in. He saw Guiteau fire the second shot, and was the first one at the Presidents side after he fell. The President said nothing Witness thought he was un- conscious. He distinctly saw Guiteau start toward the B. street door, but turned after he saw Officer Kearney there. He heard the prisoner make no remark. Witness noticed that he was very excited and anxious to get away, but did not notice anything more pe- culiar about him. Witness seemed positive that the President neither turned around or began to fall until the second shot had been fred He did not see Secretary Blaine by the President when he reached him. Blaine went out one door toward the ticket office as the witness entered by the other. At 2:5O the cross examination of Smith was conclud- ed, and the court adjourned until to- morrow 

 The court had been so crowded that it was some time before it could be cleared Mean while Guiteau was kept in the Marshafs room. At least five hundred people gathered before the door when the van was opened. Walking nervously between the two marshals the prisoner ran his daily gauntlet of hoots and misses, and as the door closed with bang, the crowd set up yell that continued till the van disappeared. This feature of the day is a most trying one to the prisoner His face as he walks through the crowd is ivid with fear, and he is heartily glad when he gets inside the van. This scene was in- tensified to-day perhaps on account of Gui- teau having stated in an angry moment in court to-day that he would make a TOW be- fore the trial was over. Such row would not be unexpected by good many, for there are numbers of people who come to the court room daily. expecting to see Guiteau shot. The reported arrest of an alleged conspira- tor with Guiteau was fatly denied too early this morning to cause much excitement Colonel Corkhill refused to say whether he had had any correspondence with Chicago people on the subject, but he did say the story as published was all news to him and that he did not believe word of it. This evening he said he understood that the whole story was a hoax, which was about what he thought in the first place. The de- of justice has had no information whatever in regard to the alleged conspiracy discovery and have not placed sufficient cre- Hence in the report to have 1t investigated. l Colonel William O.

| Wftnssses wh % swear that they
Bought street Dirt from Patrick
Gardner.


Last evening City Councils special
committee to Investigate the charge
Of Patrick Gardner, late foreman OF
the street cleaning gang that Street
Commissioner Lewis p. Lynch was
guilty Of selling the street dirt and
selling the proceeds, met again to
continue the examination Of wit
nesses.


Mr.. John Dunn, proprietor of the
Swan Hotel testified that he bought
street dirt from Street Commissio
Lynch; he went to Lynch's Office, on
Sixth street, ard Lynch gave him a
written order on Patrick Gardner.
He paid Gardner Eve dollars and the
latter gave him a receipt. There
were fully ten loads In the amount he
got. Mr.. Dunn said he did not know
Mr.. Lynch, and applied to the man
who was pointed out to him as the
Street Commissioner. He thought
the Office he went to was on Sixth
street, but was not certain. He said
when he arranged with Lynch for
the d rt he agreed to to pay rs cents
load for 1t.


Mr.. Lynch being present, asked
Mr.. Dunn If he did not tell him
when he got ready to nay for the dirt
to pay the City Auditor. Mr. Dunn
said he could not say whether be did
or not, but he admitted that he did
not pay Lynch and that Lynch never
asked him tor 1t.


Mr.. Hayes Chandler said be bought q
load OF dirt from man on the street
last March. He did not know who the
man was, but one of the other men said
1t was ""the boss"" Being questioned BY
Mr.. Lynch a. to whether be was the
man who sold him the dirt Mr.. Chandler
said be wss not. The man he bought
from was not In carriage but was on
foot.


Mr.. Taylor, gardener for Mrs. Jones,
Eleventh and Market streets, testified
that about last May he purchased six
loads Of street dirt from Patrick Gard
ner. He made arrangements with
Gardner, who charged him fifty cents q
load. He paid Gardner but took no re-
ceipt.


John Collins aud Martin Grant, two
street employees, who, according TO
Gardner's statement, shoyeled snow
from Lynch's pavement during the time
they should have been working for the
city, were directed to be summoned 10
appear before the committee, and also
Henry Alexander.


Patrick Gardner was called by Mr.,
Moore and asked II he was still In the
employ of the city. He said not, as he
was discharged by the Street Commis-
sioner, together with John Collins,
owen Monahan aud three others. The
reason assigned for his discharge was
because he would not stay with the men
at their work.


Mr.. Lynch denied having discharged
Gardner, and said John Collins was
still at work.


Col. II. s. McComb testified that last
spring he saw some nen gathering the
dirt from Market street, aud asked IL he
could get some of 1t. The man he In.
quired Of directed him to another man
designated as the ""forsmau,"" whe con-
tracted with HIM at once for SIX loads.
The DIRT was delivered, and the money,
three dollars, paid at his Office. A re-
celpt was taken for the money and the
receipt was signed by . man named
Gardner.


Mr.. Moore, of the committee, moved
that City Auditor Ball be summoned
before the committee and testify 10 re-
gard to the amount of money for the
sale of street dirt turned into the City
Treasury during Lynch's term of office
a. Street Commissioner.


Mr.. Barnhill moved to amend by ex-
tending the time Of this examination
TO ten or twelve years back, so as to
cover the terms of previous Street Com
missioners. This amendment prevailed,
Mr.. Moore alone voting against 1t.


Just before adjournment Mr.. Lynch
made statement to the committee,
speaking In bis usual tragic manner and
""before God and his holy
angels that he was innocent of this foul
charge"" He intimated strongly that
Pat Gardner was . perjurer, and Pat
angrily replied, but tile wranele was

 The ''goddlemity"" young man has struck town on his way to his summer retreat, He attended market yesterday and examined the calves as the rustic farmers drove up with | them to be critically and carefully inspected. The young man was struck with the piteous. ness of the calves moan, and ventured to ex- postulate with the farmer on his apparent | cruelty '!I say, you sir, cawnt those de- | fenseless quadrupeds be unloosed and be per mitted to enjoy absolute freedom from re- stricton?"" The farmer said, ""Not so,"" dis dainfully, and the young man. afto1 much cogitation and reflection, determined to in- dulge in a theory and present the principles of the new departure in education. He en- quired the price of the calf, short horned, Kentucky Durham bull calf, and on pay1ng the price, proceeded to unloose the cords that to his mind so cruelty bound him. He un- tied the first knot that was made through brace in the wagon box and passing the rope through the loop formed to cross the calf's hind legs, gave full play to the animals limbs. A switch of the tail, sudden contraction of veal muscle, and then both legs stretched as from a cramped position, and the young man oh, where was he He returned to the dust that was part of his physical being, and while he bit it not, he found great relief in rningling with it and clawing it. It was then rude shock. He limped away, and the calf ! was retied and shipped by the cruel, too, | too cruel farmer to the great city whither the young man went to eat veal pot pie.

 Rev. J. W. Macomber, in the absence, of w. A. Mackey, who was detained at home by sickness, occupied the pulpit in the M. B. Church in this town last Sunday. The text for the morning sermon was found in Acts z, part of 59th verse: 'And they stoned

 Stephen"" The subject said the speaker, will

 be the death of Stephen, the first Christian martyr. Stephen, elected deacon in the

 New Church, went forth to dispense the

 charity at his disposal he made so great a

 commotion that his enemies sought to perse-

 cute him, and brought false witnesses to &C.,

 cuse and convict him. But Stephen quotes

 the Scriptures so ably, and pours forth such

 a stream of inyective, that they were over-

 whelmed, and were so incensed that they

 brought about his death. He was slain by a mob, tried by what is now termed Lynch

 law. Attention is called to two or three cir cumstances in this affair. First, the support and comfort which the holy man, Stephen, re

 ceived in the hour of his death. No frienC

 was by his side to assist and to pray for ane

 with him; he was alone, save that Christ wa!

 with him.

 It is not known if Stephen saw Christ 1T

 the flesh, but he knew of Him, and could re

 cognize him as standing at Gods right hand It was an evidence that Christ had risen iron [ the dead-Stephen saw Him and called Hin by name. We can learn from this that i e times of peculiar trials, Jesus affords pecu t liar support, especially so in the time of deatt Payson, though great and good man in hi n life time was beset with doubts and fears ! but, in death he said,: II seem to be swim S ming in a sea Of glory, and know my hay q piness has begun"" And he died shouting V Peace, peace, victory""

 The prayer in which Stephen commits hi

 soul to Christ teaches us, continued tn Il preacher, three things: First, that man ha l. a soul; second, that the soul is distinct fror t the body, and third, that the soul at deat t goes into the presence of Jesus.

 It Matter is inert; It cannot act; it cannc

 think; the soul is the motive power. Ste e phen gave not that which! perishes, his body q but his soul, to Christ. Stephen knew tn if afters death, and he said Receive my spi l it."" take that which cannot die This praye is another and unshakable proof of the

 vinity of Christ. It is an evidence of th

 fact that religious worship was spaid to Jesu o1 at that time. Christ permitted it, and the di D. ciples practiced it. Did Stephen worship tn; d which was unlawful? Did he fall down an D. call on an angel? Did Christ receive the hon st age of men simply as man? No. it was g It God that he received Stephens worship.

 Stephen prayed for This prosecutors, ""Lort T. lay not this sin to their charge"" Eve ,- asChrist prayed on the cross for his murder r. ers so Stephen prayed in the same spirit Tn D exhibits the infinite mercy of God, who coul d put 1t into the hearts of men to pray ft D those who are seeking their death. God ar wrath..is terrible, but His mercy is great, ar

 He uses it to soften mems hearts toward

 their enemies.

 Stephens prayer was designed to be al - swered it was not made in vain. In u - crowd which stood about those who we q stoning Stephen was Saul, who went fro d that scene breathing out threatenings ar of slaughter against Christians. Stephen e prayer went to heaven, and Jesus met Saul C

 His way to Damascus, and convicted and col

 verted him. If Stephen had not prayed, u or Christian Church had never known Paul. It is said in the record that Stephen "" Fe le asleep"" Such is the Christians final hou 7s Jesus sustains and soothes the aching hear II PeacefuVness characterizes the death of u Id Christian. He sleeps as ore who expects, IT he lies down at night, to awake in the bright' y dawn.

 We may remark, in closing, said the spea h CT, first, that the history of the martyrs a n lords us no mean evidence of the divine o d igen of religion. The blood of the marty M is the seed of the Church. To-day persecl .o tion is unknown; men worship God in ire h dom, and are protected by civil law."

popdent says


A CORRESPONDENT of the New York


Tribune, writing from Virginia, gives


the political condition of the State az


1t relates to the two parties striving for


the mastery. The following is an


extract:


There are enough of the white Rea /
iusters of education and talent tor


stump speaking to make dashlng


campaign in every county OF the state,


and enough more TO form LEGAL or


ganizations, guard the polls aud pro-


tect the negroes in their right to ""a
| full vote and d fair count. In some
counties, too, particularly in the long


wellge called the Southwest, Manoues


white followers actually preponderate
over the Bourbons In the rich agri-
cultural counties of the ""Valley,"" the
two elements are in about equal force.
In the Piedmont section and the Tide


water region the general rule is that
the white Bourbons largely out-number
the white read listers. Not to attempt
to draw the line between social classes
too accurately, Mahone's forces may
be said to embrace, first, a few active, tai
ented liberal minded politicians inevery
county; second, a large proportion OF
the small farmers in the mountain dis.
tricts and third, the negroes almost in
a body: while the Bourbons comprise
all that is lett of the Democratic party
after the Reailuster detection, and
few blacks fere and there, who have
yielded to some peculiar pressure. The
arithmetic Of the situation decidedly Ia
vors the Anti i-Bourbons. Last gear
Mahone's friends threw 81 900 votes for
his electoral ticket. The Republicans
gave $1,000 for theirs. Now $1,000
plus $4,000 makes llb,0 whereas the
Bourbons only mustered 9d,00o. Ihe
campaign Malone is making proceeds
on the assumption that thirts-one thou
sand Read justers are all faithful sun,
and that the eighty tive thousand Re-
mlblicans can be transferred to the
Lynchburg ticket with a loss OF per
hans ten-tbousand, ana that this loss
"" Ill be more than made up by converts |
from the Buurbous. On the other hand
the Bour5 ons claim that they Will get
at least third Of the negro vote, and
deny that Malone has captured any OF
their vote OF last year.


With such difference in the calcu-
lations of the two sides one must turn
f ,r light to the logic OF the situation
| am bound to say that this is decidedly
on the side CT the Malone party. the
Liberal movement. 1t is mole aggres-
sive than ever; it is better organized; il
has more strong, energetic leaders II
has spread TO counties where it had no
hold year ago. To the careful obser-
yer of politics new movement Is like
the tide on the sea shore-.on can
soon tell whether it is rising or reced.
ing. Anti -BourboniSm in Virginia Is
plainly on the rise. Everything points
TO this conclusion; nothing points the |
other way. As growing movement II
must eventually make larger inroad |
on the Democratic vote than II did a !
year ago The Republicans who are
ly negroes. They have many strong |
reasons for voting for party which
.vors free schools and fair ballot,
and no reason at all for supporting the
party which has done its best to make
of them ""A race OF seris with only a
nominal and valueless right to vote.
Why should they not come to the ad
ofthe Anti Bonrbons Tuey have no
ticket of their own. Their State Con-
vention divided-1he majority indors-
ing the Mahene ticket and the mlnori.
.y deciding to put up no ticket against
it. think it safe in an estimate OF the
result this year to assign the Malone
ticket at least $4,000 white votes 1t


would not be safe, however, to make de-
finite figures as to the disposition OF the
old Republican vote. The surface indl-
cations 90 to snew that ali ui il except
= few s-ragglers will be thro wn for
Cameron and Lewis."

Large Attendance and Deep Interest Mani
fsstsd-O Committee Appointed to Draft .
Memorial to Congress.",,"Memorial to Congress.


Pursuant to call published in the
daily pa pers, a large number of the


leading citizens Of Los Angeles


met at Turn Verein Hall last night
to unite In a petition asking Con-
gress to increase the appropriation
for the Wilmington harbor. The


meeting was called to order by
Councilman B. Chandler, who an
nounced DR.. j. P. Widney as
Chairman.


On motion, r. s. Lynch was
chosen Secretary.


DR.. Widney, on taking the Chair,
stated. the object of the meeting,
and said that he had watched the
progress of the work of improving
Wilmington Harbor with great in
terest for several years past. Now
that the great work has progressed
to that stage at which, In the opin.
ion of the engineers in charge, 1t
needs but q comparatively
small appropriation from the
government to assure q
commodious and permanent har-
bor, he hoped that the united &C.
ton Of our citiseus would have
such m effect on Congress as to
accomplish the purpose desired.
Before resuming his seat, DR.. Wild
ney called upon any gentleman
present who had anything to say
upon the subject to come forward.


General Banning, In response to
repeated calls, came forward and
made short sDeech, In the course
of which he said the improvement
Of Wilmington Harb0r was the
great OBJECT of his life, having
worked earnestly for the accom-.
plishment. OF that purpose for near
~ thirty years. In 1852, the Gem
eral said, he expended the sum Of
81, all the money he then had, in
the purchase of some boards with |
which he built the scow In which
he explored what has been called |
In derision ""Banning's Hog Wal.
low"" and ""Banning's Slough"" and
then 1t was that he came to the
conclusion that, at . comparative.
ly light cost to the government, q
barb0r could be made that would
be OF incalculable value to this
whole section. For the purpose OF
securing this expenditure, he made
three trips to Washington City,
securing at the FIRST an appropria-
tion of 100000, at the second
$75, 600 and at the third $50, 900.
Now, the great necessity, Ee said,
is to get the channel over the bar
deepened. This will cost probably
$20O, 900. AS 1t is, the steamer
Newport comes into the harbor
every trip and discharges at the
wharf. The Anc0n, also, comes in
on favorable tides, but the Orizaba,
although not SO large as the Ancon,
has never yet been inside, for the
reason that she draws more water
than either Of the others.


The General then branched of |
on the lighterage question. The
lighters, he said, would continue |
to be q necessity until the difficult
ty at the bar was removed. He
could not afford to do the work for |
nothing, but did 1t as cheaply as
he could and as somebody would
have to do the business, he guessed
he would continue at it until the
necessity was done away with.


In regard to the railroad, he said
that he had been one Of the origi-
nal aaovors In tho Los A AnQalas and !
WILMINGTON road. The original
scheme em braced an extension of
the limo to Rattlesnake leland, the
right Of way for which he had 80.
cured through A. Glassell, Esq, at
an expenditure Of $500. He still
thought that extension would be
of great benefit to Los Angeles.


In reply to q question AS to how
much money, judiciously expend-
cd, 1t would require to dredge the
bar to sufficient depth, the Gen.
eral replied that he thought
$1,000 SO expended would give 3
channel ""a feet deep over the bar.


The General was here asked
about the railroad extension re.
GENTLY commenced by him.


He replied that the work was
being done on his own responsible
ity, but that he had desisted to
await the action Of the people here.


Mr.. Spence stated that the OBJ
ject Of the meeting being to peti.
ton Congress for an increase of the
appropriation for Wilmington
Harbor, he would move that the
Chair appoint communities Of
five to draft memorial to Con-
gress asking an appropriation OF
$500. 900 for that purpose.


The Chair appointed the follow
ing COMMITTEES; e, #. Spence, p.
Raining, w. Woodwork, d. Cohn
and Supervisor Harmon.


On motion of General Banning,
the Chairman and w. H. Perry
were added to the Committee.
Mr.. Perry thought the Commit.
tee should be enlarged and in.
structed to confer with Col. Mem
dell, who Is familiar with the en-.
tire subject, before taking action.
He said that during q recent visit
to San Francisco he visited Col.


Mendsll and was shown maps Of
the soundiDgs of the bay, copies of


which are being prepared and will
be transmitted to this city in a
week or ten days.

resolves "" that THE. CONSERVATIVES DEMO-
CRATIC PARTY PLEDGES ITSELF, AS PART OF
ITS POLICY, NOT TO INCREASE THE PRESENT
RATE OF TAxAuoNw


We had feared that in their too utter
honesty they might raise the taxes. We
knew, as all the world knows, that the
present rate of taxation runs the State
behind something more than million n
year, and that the present rate of interest
on what is recognized by Bourbon legis-
lation as the public debt has TO go un-
paid. There seemed but one way to cure
this wrong on the creditors, and that was
for somebody to pay the interest. AS the
present rate of taxation fails, as already
remarked, to meet the exigcncy, that rate
had to be increased, or some kind friend
would have to pay the deficit. That
friend has been found. It is the Con-
servative Democracy. No more repudia-
ton and no increased taxation. They
will pay more, but will not call on the
people for the additional sum they agree
TO pay. Then, of course, they intend 20
pay it themselves. Generous souls!


The Conservative Democrats of Vir-
ginia omitted all mention of the whip
ping-post and the capitation tax as in
struments of disfranchiscmcnt of voters.
So far as they have the power they will
maintain both of these Bourbon monu-
ments of tyranny and defiance of the
Fifteenth Amendment. They will con-
tinue to forever disfranchise any voter
who may be convicted of any public
otlcnsc, however slight, and punished by
the whip, thereby making it possible in
any ncgro-hating community to make a
wholesale disfranchisement of the blacks
upon pretense that they have stolen
melons and made assaults.


AS to the copitation tax as Quali6ca-
tion for voting, it is plain and deliberate
violation of the conditions upon which
Virginia was readmittcd to the Union.
The act of Congress admitting the State
was accepted by the people of Virginia,
and their honor is pledged to fulfill its
conditions. A reference to it will show
that the State re-entered the Union on
the express condition that she should
never deny the ballot to any qualified
citizen except for crime. The Fourteenth
Amendment provides for reduction of
representation where the suffrage is re-
stricted for other causes than crime, and
a State which has not agreed to the con-
| trary may make such restriction and pay
the penalty in reduced representation ;
but Virginia has tied her hands against
any tax qualification for voters by assent
ing to the act of admission.


On Wednesday the Republicans will
speak. The delegates to their State con-
vention have already been chosen. II is
well settled that the Liberal ticket of
Cameron, Lewis, and Blair is to be in
dorsed. There will be u cluster of bogus
delegates at Lynchburg, pretending TO be
claimants of seats, but only intended to
serve the purpose of confusion and mu-
tiny. OF course they will bluster, and
wrangle, and worry, and most likely
there will be bullying and buying by
Bourbon Democratic emissaries on the
outside: but they can do no harm to any
but themselves. The issue in Virginia
is between law and order and free
dom Of elections on one side, and reac-
tion, reprisal, and revenge on the other.
The Bourbons want to get even with
those who prevailed in the war. Under
confederate leadership they will be beaten
by a.unon of Liberal Readjuster Demo-
Gratis and Republicans. 1t is to be hoped
that egitimately- elected delegates to the
Lynchburg convention who are opposed
to coalition will not give any countenance
to disorganizers who present credentials
having no claim to regularity. Let every
thing be done decently and in order.

In q speech favoring thepayment of the
national debt in greenbacks, delivered at
1878, Major Daniel, the Bourbon candi-
date for Governor Of Virginia, said: THE
bondholders of the. e.United States, through
these transactions, were aggrandized in
three ways: First, by getting the enor-
nous sum of 81 on, $4,000 for nothing, save
the risk they took upon the survival ofthc
country; second, by getting interest in
coin, and third, by obtaining exemption
of this immense property from taxation.
For be it remembered that United
States bonds are exempt from taxation,
and that those best able to bear them share
not at all in the burdens to be borne""


In the event ofthe success of the Bour-
bon ticket, Major Daniel will probably
succeed the Hon. John w. Johnston in
the United States Senate.

 It was a sad and mournful congregation that gathered yesterday morning at the Church of the Sacred Heart to pay the last tribute of esteem to their departed friend and pastor, the Rev. Stephen P. Sheffrey. On every face in the vast throng, filling every seat and every available inch of standing room even to the vestibule, rested an express sion of sorrow, and it was evident that the shadow of personal loss was upon the as- sembled mourners, and the solemnity of the occasion was still further revealed in the sombre drapings of the church and the altar In the center aisle, directly in front of the sanctuary, rested the heavily draped casket, covered with black broadcloth and mounted with silver trimmings, fanked on either side by lighted candles, and near by were several tables filled with beautiful floral tributes. Among these were large floral column, presented by the Ladies' Sodality; the choir presented a harp on which was the word 'Hope""; St. Vincent de Paul society floral chaice on which was outlined at the base the words Our Pastor""; the Angel Guardian so- ciety a wreath the Sacred Heart T. A. B. society an anchor with the words sOur Pas tor"" on it. There was also floral tribute from Thomas F. Stackpole, and the altar boys floral testimonial was 8 magnificent bouquet and another floral offering.

 The remains were removed to the church from the pastoral residence early Monday evening, and during the night and before the services yesterday morning were viewed by thousands. Delegations from the societies connected with the church watched by the remains during the night, as well as several of the clergymen. The services yesterday began by the chanting of the office for the dead by the clergymen present, led by Rev. Fathers Dougherty of Mystic, Pagan of Naugatuck, Kelly of Windsor Locks and Gaffney of Thomaston. This was very af- fecting ceremony and was closely followed by the congregation. Immediately after it's conclusion the solemn high mass of requiem was celebrated, Rev. Dr. Carmody of New Britain officiating as celebrant Father Fleming of Portland as deacon, Father Fitzsimons of New Hartford as subdea- con, Father Slocum of St. Patrick's church master of ceremonies, and Father OI Luc 0dCrcO Il6dIt dob15l- ant master of ceremonies. During the interim before the mass H. Rowe Shelley played beautiful funeral dirge from Gull mant. Schmidt's mass was sung by the united choirs of the Catholic churches, rein forced by Misses Gaffney, of Dwight Place church, and Roberts of Center. At the offer tory Miss Kittie O'Donnell sang in a very feeling manner, Sweet Spirit, Hear my Prayer"" This was favor1te hymn of the deceased, and the deep pathos that thrilled the singers voice made marked impression on the congregation. After the sermon Miss Lizzie c. Gaffney sang Passing Bells"" her beautiful voice expressing very forcibly the sadness of the music. During this piece the church bell was tolled, making beautiful effect. The accompaniment on the organ was by H. Rowe Shelley, who also played several dirges during the services, the general direc tion of the music being in the hands of George Feist, organist of the church.

 The sermon was preached by Rev. H. Kin nerney, pastor of St. Joseph's church, Paw tucket, R. l., and was an affectionate person. al tribute from one who spent his college days with the deceased, and who knew and loved him for his fine qualities. The text was from Thessalonians, 4th chapter, 18th verse And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that are asleep; that you be not sorrowful even as others who have no hope"" He said in the midst of life we dE6 Ut bu0 DOEIdlS Ol u0dbn. AO-udJ buO Catholic heart of this city mourns the loss of the d, ceased. It is not an aged father, or widowed mother, or loving brother or sister that we mourn over. It is one greater who is dead one who preached death one who has stood before the people showing the way to heaven. It is not common man who is dead, but priest of God, who possessed the power of God himself toward men; one whose hands were annointed and who was of the royal order of the representatives ofJesus Christ on earth. Yes 8 brother priest, a friend of boyhood is dead He was a loving brother and son and a friend of all He lived only 8 short time, but that life was 8 grand, noble one. The character of the de- ceased-his gentleness, his purity, his faith fitness to the duties of his station-was de- picted in glowing terms, and words of conso- lation to the aged sorrowing mother and af- dicted brother and sister were spoken. It was fine effort, and especially affecting as a tribute of personal friendship.

 After the sermon Very Rev. Father Hughes, of Hartford, pronounced the dissolution, af- ter which an opportunity was given for a last look at the remains, of which many availed themselves. The casket was then closed and the remains were borne to the vault that had been prepared in front of the church, where they were laid at rest. The bearers were Rev. Fathers Rogers of Stamford; Rogers of Rhode Island Mulholland of Fair Haven; Gleason or New Mllford Lalor or New da- ven Fleming of Portland.

 Among the clergy present were Rev. Fath- CT Fitzpatrick, who sat in the sacristy, where he was visited by many of his brother clergy men who were glad to see him so much 1m- proved as to be able to attend the services. Other clergymen in attendance were:

nouncement of the death of Col
John W. Forney the HERALD con.
tained an editorial giving the par.
ticulars of the arrangement Of
those two old friends, For.
ney and Buchanan. We stated
that we had derived our facts from
personal sources. Yesterday we
received a copy of the Sunday
Globe, OF Pittsburgh, dated Decem.

more detail the facts we had hint.
ed at. The gentleman named be-
low was the father Of the editor OF
the HERALD, and we had heard,
while hoy, substantially the
same story from his lips:


The death of the veteran Journal
let and politician, John w. For.
ney, during the week, Is very gen.
orally regretted by all shades OF po-
litical opinion and by the profess
sion of which he was such con-
spicuous ornament. 1t will be re-.
membered that Forney was an en-
thuslastic admirer of Hancock dur
ing the last Presidential campaign
and wrote and spoke eloouently in
his favor. During the campaign
he spoke in Old City Hall at big
ratification meeting, but be was
not in good voice and seemed to
disappoint the audience, which
shouted vigorously for old &c C,ck.
eye"" Butler. Forney was vscillat-
ing as q politician but was in Gull
ture and literary ability far beyond
the average latter day Estates
man""


IT feel as though I had twenty
years OF life before me YETI said
Colonel John w.. Forney to a re-
portOrial friend a few weeks ago.
But man proposes and God dis.
poses. Overwork and neglect of a
bad cold did the work.


His break with Buchanan, after
contributing so much to his cleo
tiOn, was one of the most dramatic
episodes Of that stirring period.
Pennsylvania was considered close,
and everybody thought much was
dlfe to Forney for his exertions in
carrying it in October. Novemb Der
brought the official aunouncemen ent
that Buchanan was to be the Pres
ident, and then the struggle COM
menced. Major David Lynch, of
Pittsburg, an old friend OF Buchan-
an's, went to Lancaster and stage ed
with Buchanan for several weeks.
1t was during Lynch's visit to Bu-
chanan that the Forney trouble
began. When Forney went up to
Lancaster the first time after the
November election, Mr.. Buchanan
said to him: ""Well, now, Mr.. For
ney, the election is over, and sup
pose you have settled in your own
mind what l can do for you""


""Sir,"" said FOrney, ""there is just
one thing 1 want, and that Is to be
the editor of the organ"" (then the
National Intelligencer).


Buchanan eeemed embarrassed
for q few seconds, and replied:
""Forney, L cannot give you that;
have'already made up my mind to
give it to Mr.. Appleton"" Apple.
ton had been Mr.. Buchanan's Sec
retary. The refusal OF Buchanan
to let him have the paper of
course struck Forney with aston
ishment. ""WelI, then, Mr.. Presi-
dent"" said Forney, II don't want
anything""


""Mr. Forney,"" said Buchanan,
II had and have my mind made
up to Offer you the best paying po-
sition within my gift, viz, Consul
to Liverpool""


II do not want it,"" said Forney.
II do not want to be buried alive I""
Nevertheless the offer had fattered
him somewhat. The salary of the
Liverpool Consulship was made
up by the fees of the office, amount
ing to some $25, 1000 per annum,
aud it had generally been given by
the Presidents to their closest
friends.


""Go,"" said Mr.. Buchanan, ""and
consider the matter, and come
back In o week and tell me what
you think of it,"" Forney went
back to Philadelphia and at the
appoi nted time again appeared at
Lancaster. BY this time Buchan-
an was getting a little uneasy at
the situation. He honestly wanted
to serve Forney, but found from
the moment of his election great
difficulty in ieconclling other
friends to his proposed advance
ment of Forney. The South had
sent up protest after protest
against him. fo0mbs aud Howell
Cobb were bitter on Forney, and
they had persuaded Benpett 10
open the columns of tie New
York Herald on him.


Major Eynch was still at Wheat
land when FOrney came out, aud
at the request VI Mr.. Buchanan
stayed to witness the interview,
""fOr,"" said the President, ""I am
afraid We will have trouble with
him."" Forney came, and said he
wanted either the organ or to go into
the Ca binet as Postm aster-General.
Mr.. Buchanan said he could not
appoint him in his Cabinet nor
give him the organ, aud Forney
returned to Philadelphia. BY this
time the trouble had got noised up,
and friends began to interfere. The
Legislature was Democratic by
two majority, aud it was proposed
that the whole force Of the new ad.
ministration should be exsrted on
behalf OF Forney to succeed Cam
eron. About Christmas time For
ney again went to Lancaster, and
1t was arranged that Mr.. Buohan-
an was to write o strong letter fa-
voring the election of Forney to
the United States Senate. The let
ter was written and put In the
hands Of Major Lynch, who went
to Harrisburg to work the matter
up. 1t failed. Cameron retained
his seat In the Senate through the
votes of three Democrats. whom it
was declared he had purch Rsed.
But Forney kept quiet. A purse"

Lynch is understood to have acted under orders
from Santiago.

II Is done out of defiance to the United States on
account Of the attitude assumed toward the
Chlians by General Hurlbut There are surmises

Chilian commander or government Others
Say tnat the new =, government OF Mr.

and, although exceedingly roticent IN the matter
arc understood to be unanimous In asserting that
Mr.. Hurlbuts action has complicated affairs to
such an extent that no one Is competent to

OMAHA, April 1Sth.-The Mis-.
souri, river is again rising. 1t has
risen at this point about two and q
half feet since yesterday morning
and is beginning again to overflow
the bottom lands in this vicinity.
It is believed that the rise is caused
by the warm weather of the last
three days, melting the snow in
Northern Nebraska and Northern
Iowa and that the tributary
streams are running over their
banks. The report from Sioux City
is that the river rose there two feet
since last night and is still rising.
No reports from Yankton. The
river is not high at Fort Sully.
Logan valley, in the northern part
Of Nebraska, is being inundated by
the sudden rise Of Logan river.
This region is q rich farming coun-
try and some considerable damage
will be done. Several railroad
washouts have occurred and tsle:
graphic communication has been
cut off. Lumber men fear that the
Missouri river will rise to its former
recent height and this afternoon
they were busy in putting booms
around their yards to hold their
lumber.


Steps are being taken in Omaha
to send relief to the sufferers from
floods in northern Nebraska and
Dakota. The Finance Com mmittee
to-day raised nearly $4,000 cash, of
which amount Samuel J. Tilden
contributed $3.50 by telegraph. The
committee expect to double the
amount already raised. Clothing
has already been collected and for.
warded and more will follow.

 The Rev. sank down on his chair, his eyes rolled, his breathing was labored, and he suddenly tainted away and dragged Napoleon Shrewsbury with him to the floor. During the excite ment eight or ten persons received the contents of the water-pail. Melon rinds flew about in perfect shower, and 8 cantelope, which struck Ten Thousand Collins between the shoul- ders, broke open and extinguished three lamps, and knocked down the grub-hoe with which Washington crossed the Delaware. Brother Pen. stock finally revived and bound wet towel around his head, and Colonel Hi Hi Smith arose to make a statement. He was intimately acquainted with the pecuniary resources of Brother Pen. stock. His earnings the past year were exactly $483. .29. His expenditures were exactly $483 25. The balance on hand was therefore only four cents. This year the balance would be closer still, and even in the best year to come there was no hope of a great increase. Giving four cents as the average yearly balance and it would take Brother Penstock about 25O, 900 years to pay his fine and secure his restoration to membership The speaker hoped that mercy would prevail and the fine be withdrawn. After brief consultation with Sir Isaac Walpole and Waydown Bebee the Presi. dent arose and announced that he would remit the fine and costs, and thai the members narrow escape from beng killed stone dead would be great moral warning to him throughout the rest ot his days.

 Judge Harrison opened the meeting with spirited address which was frequently ap- plauded.

 Following Judge Blydenburgh delivered an

 address also warmly received.

 Judge Samuel A. York was next called out and spoke of the issues which had been

 treated also by the gentlemen preceding him. He spoke of the entailed estates and the diff | culties hampering the occupants of the soil. The landholders were not in sympathy with

 the occupants of the land, but pushed them | caring only to get their rent. Americans

 sympathized with Ireland. They loved free

 dom and wanted freedom in Ireland. All de- | sired the utmost freedom that was consistent ] with the public good. We believe every la- borer should have chance to rise. As 8

 mere question of State policy alone it is the ! best policy. Take our country. Place the l lands under great land owners. Suppose all | the land in towns around New Haven to be | owned by one man in New York, another in Philadelphia, another in New Orleans. What ! condition of affairs would result? Should we ! have prosperous villages and communities growing up all around us? No. It seems to

 me the people would gravitate to 8 part of 1 the world where they could get fair show.

 In the last 250 years Ireland has not been | treated as she desires to be and has suffered

 great wrongs, and it is no wonder that man ! like Parnell (applause) seeks to help his | countrymen to obtain that liberty we ali prize.

 MT. Harrison introduced Mir. Michael Egan,

 of Fair Haven, as the next speaker. MT. Egan before proceeding to address the | large assembly, took good and deliberate \ drink of water This act awakened applause ] and laughter and Mir. Egan settled down to

 business with everybody in good humor. He

 said Ladies and gentlemen, do not see why

 am called to speak where there are trained speakers and lawyers Gaughter.) I re- member, Mir. Chairman. that when I was

 boy had to leave school and go to work to help pay the landlords who went over to France or Italy and had good time spend

 ing the money had earned and ought to

 have been educated with. (Great laughter

 and applause. Gentlemen, it is true that Eng

 land has done everything to crush the Irish race and deprive them of what justly belongs

 to them. We all know that Ireland used to

 be great country for learning and that the

 English broke up all that system and

 hunted the schoolmasters like wild beasts

 We all know there was time when if man

 sent his children across to France to get

 them educated he had his property taken

 away from him; also that children were off, fered bribes to tell of their fathers, were of fered their fathers property to tell against them, and thus did England try to divide families and break UT harmony in families. Mir. Egan now related a story where an

 Englishman who heard an Irishman tell of what he had suffered, and the reply the Eng

 lishman made. The Englishman asked why did they shoot landlords. The reply was that they did not shoot any but the very worst. The Irishman then said had first cousin who went and reclaimed a waste piece of bar ren land, taking it away from the sea. He made fine land of it. He mar ried wife who brought him e4oo. This money he put into the land and i'm

 proved it. By and by the landlord came back from his travels and big hotel bills, and looking at the land says, what nice land you have made. That is my land. What says the poor man, your land? You can't mean it I took it from the sea. Oh, the land lord says, that is nothing, it is my land and he took it. and the man had to leave it and all his wife's money sunk in it, and he went poor and hungry and broken hearted. Didn't

 he shoot the landlord asked the English man. No, replied the other who was telling it. We'll, said the Englishman, he ought to

 have shot him. That's all I've got to say. There are few who hate to commit murder more than an Irishman. But suppose your

 crops fail and you have only what will keep

 your hungry children from starving, would

 you give it to the landlords? (Many voices

 shouted no emphatically.) Well, that's what

 Parne1 (great applause) is trying to do, try

 ing to give bread to the hungry and just rights (Great applause.) MT. Egan pro- ceeding said England must yield something to Ireland. The Boers are boring her on one side and our folks on the other. Great ap

 plause and laughter.) I said some time ago that would never die till Ireland is free. I believe as much as I stand here that Ireland will be free before I depart my life. (Ap- plause.) Now I ask you to subscribe some thing to- night to help on this agitation in Ireland You know money is necessary. All these people out of employment must be supported. America will help them. We helped fight for her, and thank God for America, we will fight for her aga1n, and may America grow every day more and more. With few other words the speaker closed

 stirring address next followed from MT. Parsons, of the Register."

Meeting Of tho Committee Last
EveDinE-LJnch and Gardner
nake . speech.",,"The committee to investigat thu
charges against Louis 2. Lynch,
Street Commissioner, brought by Pat
rick Gardner. which have been agita
ting the public mind for some time past
held meeting last evening in tile May
or's room, at the entrance to the Coun
Gil Chamber. The room was scarcely
large enough for the committee, wit
nesses, visitors, &c, but they managed
to get into the room, by occupying eve
ry available space.


The parties who purchased the dirt
from Mr.. Lynch, after being duly sum.
moned. appeared before the committee
and told what they knew aboutit. Mr..
Dunn was the first witness called, and
showed the receipt he received from Mr..
Lynch, for dirt bought and paid for by
him.


After being cross examined he stated
that Mr.. Lynch had never personally
asked for nor received any money from
him, but that the whole transaction
was done by Mr.. Gardner. 1t seems
as though by Dunu's statement tina,
no one but Gardner had received any
money for dirt sold, and the question IL
mysterious one. Mr.. Lynch asked
Mr.. Dunn number of questions in the
way of cross examining him, ""a. ing
that he intended to ""speak the truth be-
fore God and the angels in heaven, y
which phrase he used several times dur
ing the examination of witnesses. Mr.
Hayes Chandler, a man by the name
Of Taylor and Col. McComb, all testi.
fed as having purchased dirt from Mr.
Gardner. AS no one hut Gardner seems
to know anything about Lynch trans
action in the matter, he (Gardner) will
have to prove that Mr.. Lynch real y re-
ceived part of tho money for such dirt
sold. This closed the testimony, AZ q
number of the witnesses were not pres
ent.


Mr.. Lawrence then made u spicy
speech, requesting that the entire nam
Der of witnesses be sum mOned at once
that there might be no more delay.
Gardner sat very uneasy in his chair
during the evening, fearing that he
would not be called upon to testify,
and when member OF the committee
arose to ask Mr.. Gardner some ques.
tions, he (Gardner) Jumped Iup, over
joyed at being again called upon to tes-
lity. The member of the committee
then asked him 'if he was working
for the city at the present time"""" 81
am not"" ""Were you discharged? .""
81 was"" ""By whom? % ""By Mr..
Lynch"" Scarcely had this answer eft
PITS lips, before Mr.. Lynch was upon
his feet, and he Indignantly denied..that
he had discharged Gardner. They
stood facing each other, with murder
GUS intent in their eyes, and words
waxed high for a short time, but
through tie efforts Of the committee,
order was restored.


A motion was made authorizing the
City Auditor, j. Frank Ball, to produce
in evidence the accounts of the Street
Commissioner.


There being nothing further the in.
vestigation was about to be adjourned
until tonight, when Mr.. Lynch hastily
arose, aud made short speech, thai
sent chill through the hearts of the
committee, as we'll as all present. He
stood before the table, whereupon lay
the Bib,e, and with hand and head
uplifted toward Heaven, he said thai
he only expected to dwell here below fol
a short time, and that he desired tt
leave his wife and children a gooC
name, finally ending his speech by say
ing, Before God and the angels in
Heaven he was as pure and innocent as
themselves"" ana further that any man
was a perjurer who would seek to sully
his name by accusing him of cheating
the city. This was meant for Pat. and

lNew York World.l",,"6eu. Cn6ltucrS duSWST "" tie pCtAliou
of Mr.. Lynch, who seeks to unseat
him. It is q calm, clear rnarshalling
of the facts in the case, under the
light and leading of Republicans
and of precedents established by
Republican judges, and it disposes
completely of the pretensions of Mr..
Lynch, excepting for those who hold
that what is accepted as evidence and
law in other States ought not to be ac-
cepted in Mississippi. Gen. Chal-
mers, in reply to the charge that the
election commissioners in rejecting
2,O49 ballots acted fraudulently, shows
that one of these rejecting commits
sioners was leading Republican who
could have no motive for cheating his
own party, and that the acts of all of
them were upheld, not by jury of
Democrats, but by Republican Fed
eral judge after full Investigation un-
dertaken at the instance of Gacai
Chalmers contestant AS to the n-


datory or merely directory character
of the statute involved in the case,
General Chalmers quotes Republican
authority to the effect that ssit is quite
clear, where the statute distinctly de-
clares that ballots having distinguish.
ing marks upon them shall not be re-
ceived or shall be rejected, that it
should be construed as mandatory and
not merely directory"" This point
once made, General Chalmers then
proves that each one of the rejected
ballots had marks upon it


""Four in number, technically known
as, first, flush dash; second, a mon
key dash; third, head dash fourth,
a monkey dash larger than the second.
These dashes are not type, but are
found in sample books of printers dis
play material along with eagles, flags,
and all such devices intended to
attract attention.""


He proves that his contestant, Mr..
Lynch, sexamined and approved these
tickets before they were distributed aud
knew the marks were there. The
voters knew the marks were there, for
some who could not read, when asked
how they knew the Republican ticket,
pointed to those marks, thus showing
that these tickets were not only dis.
tinguishable but were distinguished by
those marks, and that men who could
not read had been instructed that those
marks indicated the Republican ticket.
Again, the Republican supervisors at
the polls wrote down how each man
voted as his ticket Was handed in,
which could only have been done by
some mark understood by them.""


That IIr. Lynch had precise and
predetermined interest in this marking
appears from the evidence, which
shows that she could have procured
unmarked tickets in Jackson for his
district at 81 per thousand, and yet that
he paid $4 per thousand in Vicksburg
for these market tickets""


The sssuch little one"" plea General
Chalmers meets unanswerabIy


cit is urged that this construction of
the law should not be enforced be-
cause it throws out such large num-
Der of Republican votes. The princi-
pie is the same whether one vote or
100000 be effected by it. The whole
vote of Wisconsin was once rejected
because a snow-storm prevented her
electors from assembling on the day
appointed by law for them to vote. The
whole vote OF Arkansas was once re-
jected because the seal of the State was
not affixed to the certificate of the elec-
toral vote. And the vote of Georgia
will probably be rejected because her
electors failed to vote on the day pres
cribed by law""


Every honest member of Congress
should read General Chalmers whole
paper with close attention. 1t makes
it plain that the marked ballots in ques-
ton were intended to be used as a
means of exercising moral coercion
upon those who cast them. The inev-
liable inference from this fact is that,
without such marking and the moral
coercion secured by it, these ballots
would have been cast for General Chal-
mers, who winds up the discussion by
good reminding his adver-
re- h,l Of 10 IF tooi
was copied from the laws passed by the
Republican party in Ohio and New
York, and no man has any right to
say it was adopted for good purpose
in Ohio and for bad purpose in
Mississippi, or that it should be enfor-
ced in one State and not in the other""

 WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S.-Immediately upon

 the closing of the doors for the executive

 session of the Senate this afternoon Senator

 Edmunds called for the order on the calen-

 dar, which was the nomination of Stratham

 to be postmaster at Lynchburg The Demo

 crats at once began dilatory motions to pre-

 vent 8 vote being reached, so no business

 was transacted. The Republicans insist on

 the order of the calendar and seem determin

 ed to put in Mahone's candidate This is, as

 alleged, in pursuance of the bargain last

 spring. The Democrats stick to the unjust

 ness of unseating the present incumbent and

 swear that they will not let vote be reached

 before November 8, the day of the Virginia

 election. The debate was opened by

 Mir. Hill of Georgia, who, in opposi-

 tion to the instructions of his physi-

 clans, spoke for nearly two hours

 Nr Morgan followed with dissertation on

 ROAAOASo

 Messrs. Logan and Voorhees had spirited bout over their relative devotion to the inter

 ests of the Union soldiers MT. Hoar also

 spoke at some length and number on the

 other side more briefly. About p. m fiji

 busterlng began and the want of a quorum

 was developed A call of the Senate was or

 dered with directions to the Sergeant-at-

 Arms to request the presence of absentees,

 which had the effect to leave the Senate with

 but bare half dozen of Senators in their

 seats. As an incentive to attendance an ele-

 gant lunch was spread early in the evening ln the room of the Committee on Appropria- tions. At about o'clock by common con sent business was suspended and an hour was spent at lunch. After p. m. the debate grew desultory, only about forty-fye Senat- ors being present. The proceed ings were now only enlivened by motions to adjourn, which there is little likelihood of being agreed to for some time cd, will be held at the first opportunity. Con lecture assigns as it's cause an effort to hold certain Senators who are tired of delay and threaten to go home unless final adjournment is reached speedily. All combinations here 5ofore made, including Folger and Hatton, will be certified by the President. Just after ten o'clock Democratic Senator came out 1 and said there was but little prospect of ad- 1 journment tonight and final adjournment | would be very unlikely for a week or two At 1O:45 p. m. the lantern in the dome was still burning, showing that the Virginia cam paign was still being prosecuted in the Senate | chamber.

 Postmaster General James was sworn in l to day under his new appointment, as was | also First Assistant Postmaster General Hat I ton. The latter goes to Iowa for 8 short 1 time before assuming his duties. Judge Fol | ger IS expected to take charge of the Treas l ury about November 1st. 1

 fhn ;,4;o TIT ance Union convention to-day, Senator Blair 1 of New Hampshire, who had been asked to | speak to the convention on his proposed pro- hibition amendment to the Constitution, said l that when member of the House of Rep cesentatives he introduced resolution pro- posing an alteration of the Constitution up | on the liquor traffic. That ame ndment has 1 been regularly introduced in every Congress since that time, and will be introduced in 1 every Congress as long as he lives. The l amendment referred to provides that ''from l and after 1900 the sale of spirituous and alco- i hollc liquors, except for manufacturing, sci l entifc and medicinal purposes, shall be pro hibited in the United States"" The Senator 1 had been criticised for not including malt I liquors in his amendment, and his measure had been styled by his good temperance friends an eyasive and temporary one He did not mean to evade anything He did not think it polite to ask for the adoption of the i

 

 such an amendment as he proposed was passed by Congress, one prohibiting the man ofacture and sale of all kinds of liquor could be passed later on. ''H will take,"" said the l Senator, ""ten years to push such a measure through Congress as I have introduced It would take twenty years and perhaps fifty years to pass one more extreme in it's charac- ter"" In conclusion the Senator said: q am unqualifedly in favor of giving the bal lot to every human being as soon as they achieve their majority"" He advised the la- dies to insist upon their right to go to the primary elections and vote and make them l selves heard. He advised them to organize 1 an independent party if they cannot get their 1 rights from one of the great parties. Upon l this the women were jubilant and sang ''Blest l be the tie thet binds"" and wanted to escort l the Senator in body to the Capitol. This 1 honor the Senator n1odestly declined, but he 1 was late in his seat as it was.

 The opinion of Attorney General Mac l Veagh, published today, upsetting the de- | cision of Judge Lawrence, of the Treasury, i in the matter of whether the appropriation 1 of $175, 1000 for artificial limbs should be ex- pended by the War or Interior departments l has caused quite stir in official circles. MT. 1 Lawrence, who is said to consider his decis- | ions lnfalhble. decided against the Secretary of the Treasury in favor of the Interior depart 1 ment MT. MacVeagh reverses this and leaves | the matter in the hands of the War department | according to the Secretary of the Treasury's l former opinion. In commenting upon the | matter the Attorney General says he cannot | see how the opinion of 8 subordinate officer | in any department can be binding upon the | head of that department until force is ex- pressly given to his decisions by plain and | law and he cites also Richard | son, J., 16, Court of Claims, as follows: Comptrollers much subject to such regula l

 lions and general directions of the Secretary of the Treasury, and much bound to obey and be gov l erned by them, all other subordinate officers in the Treasury department

 The First Comptroller is naturally annoyed at this and will no doubt take occasion in some similar case to say word in relation to tha nnafter"

in many States is largely due to the fact
that in their criminal courts trials do
not try and convictions do not convict.
When the rich and the poor fare alike in
all the so-called courts of justice, when
social influence fails to tell on the rulings
of judges or the findings of the juries,
when supposed criminals, without regard
to previous standing, are promptly in
dicted and arraigned, fairly tried, and, if
found guilty, punished as the laws pre-
scribe-when, in Short, the courts COM
mand the respect of the people rather
than inspire general contempt, as is the
case with too many of them now, we
shall have done with lynching. Mean
time we are in favor of the courts trying
to vindicate their title to respect by bring
ing all lynchers to justice."

tionsl points were suggested to be
embodied In the memorial when

DR.. Widney stated that he had
written to Col. Meudell for data in

quired, their cost, ETC., and thought
that it would be we'll to await his
reply before the final preparation
OF the memorial.


In regard to the amount required
for the work. necessary to be done
this year. Gen. Banning stated
that Col. Mendell, the last time he
was at Wilmington Informed him

necessary In raising the sen wall so
as to confine the outflow Of water
to the channel, and the remainder
could be profltsbly and econom-
ically used In deepening the chan.
mel across the bar.

and suggestions as to the memorial,

faith OF the Presidents devoted wife in his recovery
was not misplaced Much faith was also put in his

the Presidents recovery to the point at which it
stood before the recent relapse.


There were evidences everywhere uptown
yesterday that the weight of anxiety that
rested SO heavily during the closing days of last
week had been removed Many argued with them
selves that as the President continued TO gain. he
would be out of danger. They were SO overioyed

pnnetins az hotels and telegraph offices were
sought as they have been every day during the
weeks since the shooting, but it was to learn how
much the gain had been. The nervous haste that
characterzed the crowd Friday and Saturday was
not seen. Significant shakes of the head and the
expression OF fears for the worst gave way TO excla
nations of confidence that all would yet be well
Thai there were unfavorable changes in his con-
ditiOn reported in the evening gave still greater
grounds tor encouragement.


There was the usual number of persons in the cor

the account, as published in the Ntaus-
Democrat, Of the shooting of James
Lewis, better known as ""Arizona
Bill"" whom everybody in camp
knows we'll, and a man called ""Fren-
chy,"" at Crested Butte, last Friday,
by town Marshal Hayes.


DR.. T. ]. Forhan, of Irwin, is in
attendance upon Lewis and reports
him doing as we'll as could be expected,
with the chances about even for his
death or recovery. Bill received
three rounds; One ball entered the
right hip passed nearly through and
was cut out an inch below the skin on
the left hip. Another entered four
inches to the right of and a little be-
low the navel, passed through the ab-
domen and came out four inches to
the left of the navel. The third shot
entered the right hip ranged down.
ward and passed out just below the
bend ofthe groin.


Frenchy was shot through the right
lung, the ball passing entirely through
the body. He died IL hours after
wards from internal hemorhage.


The coroner's jury found in his case
the verdict that: ""Frenchy came to
his death from the effects of a pistol
shot, fired from pistol in the hands
of Marshal Hayes, while in the dis
charge of his official duty""


DR.. Forhaa reported considerable
excitement in Crested Butte Sunday
night, and that fears were entertained
that an attempt would be made to
lynch Hayes. He was taken to Gunni-
son City. Arizona Bills wife and
children, arrived in Crested Butte
Monday night and are now in atten-
dance upon him. DR.. Forhan states
that he tried to obtain the particulars
Of the origin of the shooting,
but the reports were so conflicting
and the excitement so great that he
could not get truthful account of it.
The statement published in the Nfys-
Democrat is that Bill made his boast
that he would run the town that night,
and that the town Marshal said that
he wouldn't. The verdict of the Cor
oner's Jury seems to sustain the Mar
shall in his action."

Court House IN Jersey City Yesterday morning,
drawn there by the announcement. made two weeks
ago. that the officers of the broken Mechanics and
Laborers' Bank would be sentenced. The defend
ants, John Halliard, president James w. Donelan,
cashier, and Thomas C. OCalaghan, ex-Assembly-
man, Patrick Sheeran, ex-Aldeman Jeremiah
Sweeny and Adam J. Dittmar. arrived at the Court
House earv but did not show themselves at first.


At II o'clock Judge Garretson and his associates
took their seats on the bench and the defendants
called. Ex-AttorneY General Gilchrist made
an appeal in behalf of Halliard. He followed by
ex-senator Gilbet, who pleaded for Sweeny and the
other directors he intimatng that the chief respo


sibiity for the banks failure rested with alllard


Gilbert Col made an earnest appea for all the de-
PENDANTS except Hallard and then the judges retired
for consultation. In about an hour they returned,
and Judge GarretsonprOnounced the sentence or the
Court. He SAID that no case had been tried while
he had had place on the bench which had given
the Court more trouble. The defendants were con-
ycted of msmanagement OF bank, ana OF con,
spiracy TO delraud its depositors. The Court dld
not feel disposed 10 question the verdict Inc trlal
fair and impartial; the finding OF the jury was
in accordance with the testimony and 1t met with
the approval of the Court. The evidence
showed difference in the degree of crime on the
part of the Defendants which would exert an lniti,
eDce on the Judgment of the Court. John Halllard
was the president of the bank, ard had the absolute
control that officials of the same standing nave IN
similar institutions. The bank was carried on until
eyes to his responsibility. When Donelan was made
secretary, he called the attention Of the directors
TO the deficiency IN the banks funds, ana Halllaru
was called TO explain. He made statement.
but In the opinion of the Court that statement was
false. 1t was then resolved to keep the insolvency
of the bank secret and to continue business, al
though Halllard know at the time that
the bank could not be revived Donelan
and O'Callaghan knew of this agreement
to continue business, and induced people to
put money the bank and prevented Others from
drawing their money out. Sheeran and Sweeny
knew of the agreement. and eXerted themselves 10
strengthen the institution. The Judge then sem


fenced ailiard State Prison for eighteen months,
fined Doneian and OCallaghan $500 each and
costs, and sentence suspended In the cases OF
the other directors payment OF costs. Ihe
general opinion in Jersey City is that the sentences
are very light.


The Mechanics and Laborers' Bank was organized
in 1869, and failed on November 2, 1873 with
deficiency of nearly 100000. The depositOrs were
all poor people, many of whom had been lnIuced to
put their savings in the bank because the officers
were all Catholics and prominent in church
circles. The failure caused great distress,
aud so much indignation was aroused among
the deposItors that at time 1t gas feared
that the officers would be lynched. The defend;
ants indicted Tor conspiracy to defraud ana
convicted. Before being sentenced they appealed TO
the Supreme Court, which after a years cOnsldert-
ton decided not to interfere with the case hal
lard was taken into custody Immediately after
sentence was pronounced, and removed to the
County Jail. The Others have not paid their lines"

Mr.. Blake called up for third read.
ing his ordinance recognizing the Fire
department. The only matter of dis
pute In the ordinance was the second
section, which provides for the division
OF the city into two fire districts, as fo.-
lows:


The Friendship, Phoenix, Delaware,
and Water Witch Steam Fire Engine
Companies shall respond to all fire
alarms sounded upon fire alarm boxes,
No. 2, 8, IL, 1915 1S, 21,27, and 32,and
Snail Dc taken TO Db .thinthe First Fire
Alarm District. The Reliance, Fame
Hose, Washington and Weccacoe
Steam Fire Engine Companies shall
r spond to all tire alarms sounded upon
fire alarm boxes, numbers 13, IA, IT, %,
""a, rs, 20, 81 and ""a, and shall be taken
to be in the sacond Fire Alarm District.
In case of second alarm being sounded
from any one of the fire alarm boxes, it
shall be taken as a general alarm, and
the entire Fire Department shall respond.
No company shall 60 out of lis district,
except In case Of general alarm being
sounded.


In support of this section Mr.. Blake
spoke ri considerable length, referring
particularly to the original petition for
the district system and the subsequent
remonstrance which some of the peii-
TONERS signed. He knew of one large
manufacturing finn the senior member
of which signed the petition for the dis
trict system, while the junior member
signed the remoIlstrane3 ). Mr.. Blake
claimed that in urging the district sys-
tenn he was actuated solely by a desire
to improve the fire department, which
only needs system aud discipline to
make 1t the best in the world. The
district system, be claimed, would save
money to the companies and give the
people increased fire protection.

A couple of years ago the HER.
AID gave an account of a search
for hidden treasure in this city, the
whereabouts of which had bsen
communicated by an inmate of the
States Prison. Among the search.
ers was Walter Salter Manning. u
sometime Angelefi,, afterwards
known to fame as a member Of the
Gulf of California Oyster
Canning Company, original.
ed by Archibald B. Nc
Caw, who had also been resi-.
dent OF Los Angeles, figuring here
IS q Puts aud Calls broker. The
searchers delved for several.nights
in the neighborhood of the Catho-
lie cemetery without finding any
thing and were finally arrested by
the Chief Of Police (Harris, we
believe) as suspicious charsct ers.
1t appears that tho searching fever
has again broken out, the new
sesrchers having derived their in.
formation from u source similar to
that of the first party-a sometime
States Prison bird, who departed
this life some years ago, but who,
before starting for that undiscov-
cred country from whose bourne no
traveller returns, communicated
the secret of the hidden treasure to
u pard. This time, however, the
locality OF the cache was changed
to the eastern bank Of the Los An.
geles river where, last Saturday, q
party was seen turning over the
earth as though they expected to
strike 1t rich, but who, like their
predecessors in the same field,
were doomed to disappointment,
the only difference being that they
were not subjected to arrest as sus-
picious characters.

 Sheriff John Behan and Williams left Paul, with four others, ct Red fields ranch, about fifty miles down the San Pedro, Saturday morning, at 5 o'clock. They had then captured one of ihe robbers at the ranch. The prisoner was turned oyer to Sheriil Behan, and in order 10 avoid exciting the people and having premature lynchlng. the prisoner was given his arms aud directed to conduct him self as though he was free.

Iu the meantime the rest of Paul's party are in hot pursuit Of the other three rob- bers, with good prospects of over- hauling them, their trail being tolera- bly distinct, and they being overcome with fatigue. Williams will leave Tombstone Monday morning with a party Ot mounted men 10 assist in the pursuit and capture of the robbers.

 The Connecticut militia arrived home yes- terday, the special train bringing them reach ing this city at half-pas six. After the Foot Guards had been landed, the train proceeded to Hartford, where a reception awaited the First regiment The Foot Guards were es- corted from the depot by the city battalion of the Second regiment, Ave companies, Captain Tiesing in command, and headed by the American band, the procession making fine appearance and dense throngs of people being out to witness the reception. A bril- liant display of fireworks added to the scene The Foot Guards were looked for as the lions of the occasion and the command was evi- dently in fine trim, and reflected credit upon themselves as they have done throughout their notable trip. The members of the diff ferent commands of the Second were sum- moned to assemble at their respective armo- ries by the military alarm-15 strokes on the ! fire bells-at about three o'clock. The re- sponses were prompt and soon from all di- | rections soldiers appeared, some attired in ! uniform, hsstening to the armories. There l was quick work done in many cases Ill re- porting to the armories-

 The train bringing the First regiment and the Foot Guard left Harlem | river at about p. m. The troops arrived at | about half-past nine at Harlem iver. The | delay was no fault of the railroad company, as the first news they had that a train was wanted was at 10 o'clock, when the troops | were already at Harlem river. A telegraph I L. notify the railroad, but in repeating it it was | sent to read ''one'' car instead of ''ten,"" as the despatch was first transmitted. The rail- road authorities made up train in the short est time possible for the boys.

 fore arriving in Jersey City Colonel Barbour read in a morning paper of the death of his ] mother in-law, and left the regiment there, ] Lieut. Col. Cone assuming command. At 1 New York, through misunderstanding, the I train was not made up, although it was tele- graphed for Thursday by Quartermaster Cheney, and supposed to be in waiting, and the wait till three o'clock came In coming up long freight train was overtaken and | this caused the delay.

all respect for law and the appliances
CO., justice, Asan illustration Of this take
the case of Ed. Williams, of Wisconsin,
one Of the alleged murderers of the Col
man brothers, A telegram of the 10Th
instant says:


Williams was caught in Hall County, Nebraska
last Saturday and conveyed 10 Durand, where
he arrived yesterday. In court this afternoon he
pleaded not guilty to the charge of murder The
courtroom was crowded and several men were
outside. Williams had scarcely entered his plea
and asked for time TO procure witnesses when u
moose was thrown over his neck. Those inside
the courtroom showed him TO a window, while
those outside pulled the rope, and he was dragged
some forty rods to a tree and hanged until he was
dead.


There is no excuse, no possible pallia-
tion of such outlawry. If organized So
Ciety is better than anarchy, if law is
better than license, if there is to be any
respect for the rights Of person and prop
erty, if we are not to plunge into chaos,
such proceedings as that murder ut Du-
rand must he stopped. The alleged out
law was sure of a fair trial if the mob had
spared him, aud he would undoubtedly
have been lawfully hanged in due course
Of time and justice


But Wisconsin has good company in
Ills disgrace, A telegram from Athens,
Ohio states that fact has come to light
in relation to the lynching of Davis, the
outragcr, there on Sunday night which
makes that affair all the more disgrace
ful. II seems that when Davis was taken

neck he was asked TO confess. lie in

who have two-thirds of those white Re-

Let us throw out few suggestions. If
a few white professors of Republicanism
could 18th the aid of few hired negroes,
get majority of one in the Lynchburg
convention, they could make a straight
ticket and a State Central Committee.
The Democrats would cheerfully defray
the campaign expenses; and this divis-

discourage many Readjusters, who might
relax their efforts. The Bourbons could
continue to control the State government

happy neighbor, the Erenjng Star, over the
ridiculous fiasco of its Straightout friends
in Virginia gives us much concern. 1t
says that Wickham, Jorgensen, and
Dezendorf fully appreciate the weight
of the Readjuster proposition. They
know that the success of ticket upon
such platform means the paralyzing of
all the material interests of the State for
the reason that capital will not enter a
State which repudiates her obligations""
From which it would appear that the
gentlemen aforesaid must defeat the
naughty Readiusters. But the Lynch
burg correspondent of the New York
Tribune says that some of these leaders
from whom the Star hopes so much
are surrendering. General Wickham
could have been the candidate
of the Bourbon Democracy for United
States Senator in 1879, when General Ma.
hone was elected, if the negro members
of the Legislature would have voted for
him. But the honest blacks scorned the
alliance. From this it would appear that
General Wickham's happiness in life does
not depend so much on the defeat OF the
Bourbons as it does on t.fe defeat of the
Readns.ercc. fAs for Messrs. Jorgensen
and Dezendorf, it is of much more conse-
quence to themselves what they shall now
do than it is TO the coalition which has
been formed in spite of their most ener-
getic efforts. The election is not likely to
be affected by anything that can be said
or done by the rump Of the Straightout
rump, which disbanded so ingloriously at
Lynchburg on Thursday. There was not
enough of it left to makeits surrender an
object. 1t will behave better if left to
itself than it will if it is resuscitated by
any recognition for treaty-making pur-
poses Some of it was but the hatulence
with which the party had been inconve-
nienced, and, having passed of, it need
not be recalled.


So far from there being any ground for
the Stars apprehensions that capital will
be kept out of Virginia by the Rcadius-
tors platform, that usually shrewd journal
ought to see that it is because of the bold
stand of the Readjusters for progressive
policies that capital has already been en-
couraged to come into the State. The
Bourbons have repudiated all along, and
still do repudate. They do not pay the
interest on the debt, and they therefore
have put the State in the attitude Of
bankrupt. They have not, then, been
modest, and asked the forbearance of
their creditors; they have not proposed
any scheme by which bondholders could
have certainty of something; but they
have turned their empty pockets inside out
and clustered about being willing to oWe
and scornng reputation, while failing to
pay the interest. 1t is precisely because
the Readjusters meet the situation and
make the way straight and clear for
paying three per cent. on the twenty
millions which they claim is the just in
debtedness of the State and because old
moss-backed, reactionary Bourbonism is
being fought by eX-confederates and
blacks combined, that capital fearlessly
enters the Old Dominion. We rejoice at
the awakening in Southern breasts of the
emotions of national patriotism. We
pity the Republican who does not COM
prehend the magnitude Of the grand Lib
eral movement in Virginia. We regret
that so many Democrats in that State are
joined to their old idols. There is no
Straightout bigotry in The NATIONAL
REPUBLICAN,, no sorrowing because our
countrymen in Virginia who were once
enemies are now friends.


Republicanism is simply organized
opposition to political tyranny, as it was
organized opposition to rebellion and to
slavery in the years that are past, When
il can find men who are not Republicans
willing to join in the crusade for national
progress it gladly drops its distinctive
name, forgets past quarrels, and moves
along with its new friends. If the
Star will open the windows of its Straight
out house and let in the fresh air and
bright light twill soon cease to hold the
stirrups of the Virginia Bourbons, and
will laugh at the idea that il now enter
tains of what debt-payer is. The Re-
adiusters will make the debt Of Virginia
worth much more on the street in New
York than it now is, because they will do
all they agree TO do.





THE Hon. Sitting Bull is reported as


Al"
36_1881-08-13_p1_sn86053573_00211101933_1881081301_0152,National Republican.,01,1881-08-13,p1,,,"
Dakotah. The fact that he is taking in
fresh ammunition and guns"" at his
camp"" would seem TO indicate purpose
on his part to make prisoners of the
soldiers Of the garrison. If he can rally
the young bucks at the agency, wherein
he is guest rather than q prisoner, he
may yet vindicate the Indian cause and
put forth ""straightout ticket"" Settlers
along the Missouri River in the Standing
Rock region are alarmed, and have made
appeals for an increased military force at
Forts Yates and Lincoln. The officers at
Fort Yates are said to regard their force
asentirely to withstand an out
break If one should be attempted by the
Indians. 1t may be very unjust TO Mr..
Bull TO suspect him Of evil intentions.
But power is greatly respected by his
kind of red men.


A PROMINENT and leading gentleman,
writing from Loudoun County, says ""The
great speech of Captain Frank Blair at
Leesburg, Va, last Monday has been the
topic of conversation throughout the
county during the week."" He says a
great many farmers and business men
throughout the counties of Loudoun and
Fauquier who heard the speech and have
since read it in THE REPUBLICAN, say it is
the clearest and most forcible presenta-
ton Of the issues in the State between
the two parties that has been given. He
says; From the lights now before us the
speech of Blair has done great good for
our cause in these counties. have heard
several reliable farmers say that they will
no longer hold on TO the old ideas of
Bourbon Democracy, They want free
schools, hard money, good times, and no
more quarrels between sections"" This is
but one of many such letters that are be.
ing written from the Eighth District.





If there is anything more clearly set
tied than another IL is that the United
States will not be a safe base of opera
tions for assassins of the heads of
nations. Hartmann and Grove are fell
lows Of Booth and Guiteau. The letter
Of Secretary Blaine in response to the inn
pertinent demand of EIartmann's attor-
ney TO know whether or not his client
would be surrendered if demanded by
the Russian government was eminently
proper and sufficient for the occasion.
The State Department does not listen to
appeals from alleged conversations of un-
der secretaries. 1t is to be hoped that
whenever an assassin seeks refuge in this
land, and his extradition is sought by the
government he has offended, our own
Government will not hesitate to surren-
der him, as it may do without as well as
under an extradition treaty.





The celebrated debt-paying, one-horse
rump convention of assistant Virginia
Bourbons, which could not get anybody
to accept its nominations at Lynchburg,
adopted resolution in which they said
West Virginia never contracted to pny any of the
Virginia debt The Straightout Republicans,
while paying tho whole debt"" ought not to be
mean enough to withhold that one-third which
West Virginia Debt. Payers repudiatc. Upon re-
Election they will pay II all.





ONE A. NJ. Perry has written letter TO
the editor of this paper which is indecent
and senseless. His name is not in the
Directory, which leads us to think he is
either"" tramp or n crank.

 Arrest.

 CHICAGO, Nov. 17.-A mysterious man was arrested at Kensington, a suburban town, and jailed. He gave several fictitious names. He claims to have come from Canada. When searched he was found to have mass of cor respondeuce between Charles J. Guiteau and many pro ninent people throughout the coun- try. The correspondence discloses the all legged fact that 8 widespread conspiracy ex- isted previous to Garfeld's assassination and that Guiteau was only one member of the gang who had plotted and planned for months to remove the President. The police of Kensington refuse to give details of the arrest of the suspicious character, but have him in safety in jail Colonel Cork hill was communicated with by tele- graph this evening and answered to hold the prisoner by all means and forward to him the correspondence.

 A special to the Chicago Herald from Washington this evening says the alleged cause of the rupture between MacVeagh, Corkhill and President Arthur is said to be because the former expended the entire amount of the contingent fund at their dis posal in efforts to discover the supposed con- spiracy which has thus accidentally come to light in Kensington."

 The Cour. Martial.

 lSurciiL io tne CITIZEN

 CAsiP THOMAS, Auzoua, November c. The holding Of the court martial to tr, 

 the Indian scouts, at Fort Grant, excites considerable surprise here, AS most ol the witnesses are at San Carlos or here, and the Government would be saved great expense if the trial was held here. It Is held by some who are good authOri- ties that the military court has not got jurisdiction, as the Indian scouts do not occupy the same position as regularly enlisted men, and the same laws do not apply to them.

 Paymaster Witcher commenced pay ing the troops to-day, and there will be lively times tonight.

 Major Worth and the otherofIicers de- tailed for the court martial at Fort Grant will leave tomorrow. The command of the post will devolye on Major McLel- Ian. Clark's San Carlos scouts have ar rived here.

 The report that General Mckenzie was appointed to the command in New Mexi- co immediately on his arrival there gives | ElC onttsrra, cay'n.

 The court martial of the Indian scouts, which commences on Thursday at Fort Grant, will be very interesting. Colonel Tifany's records at San Carlos will play an important part, and strange develop ments may be expected.

 A Shooting Array.

 TRUCKEE. Cal, October ""A fatal shooting afTray occurred in the Chinese ] quarter last night. The trouble had its l origin several weeks ago. The proprie- tor Of the American hotel discharged his Chinese cooks and replaced them by a new crew. The new men were stran- gers in town and this raised the ire of the old crew, and the new crew were ! warned to leave their positions under penalty of getting into serious trouble. They declined to heed the warning, and after they quit work last night they went to Chinatown. and were sitting talking when a shot was fired at them. They immediately drew pistols and com ! meuced shooting. In a few seconds a large crowd of Chinamen gathered on 1 the scene and the shooting seemed to become general among the crowd. There was at least thirty shots fired. After the shooting had ceased it was found that the head cook of the American hotel had been killed; another Chinaman was shot through the arm and received bUl- let in the left side of his body, and a third one was shot through the back of the neck. Up to the present time but one Chinaman has been arrested. More arrests will undoubtedly follow. The wounded men will recover.

A Former Citizen of this County Foully


Butchered.",,"Butchered.


The following associated press dis
patch was sent out of Santa Fe dated
the 18th inst. :se.


Tho New Mexican tomorrow will
contain an account of horrible MUIR
der which was committed on the
eighth, on Animas river, Rio Arriba
county, New Mexico, about twenty
miles above Pennington. A family
named Lewis moved into this coun-
try from Canon City, Colorado. They
were accompanied by a man named
T. H. jennings. 1t seems that an un-
due intimacy has for long time been
existing between Mrs. Lewis and
Jennings. Between the two a plan
was arranged by which the husband,
Lewis, should be murdered aud the
guilty pair go back to Missouri and
be married. The plan was carried
INTO execution on the eighth instant.
Lewis was killed by Jennings, his
body hid in the bushes during the
day and buried at night in a hole
alongside an irrigation ditch, and the
water run over the ground in order
70 eradicate all signs of the crime.
The absence of Lewis was noticed
and Sheriff Blanchett at once set to
| work to- investigate the matter. With
skill equal TO that of an experienced
detective. he managed to find the
body and fixed the murder on Jen-
nings. A party was formed to lynch
Jennings, but by the great influence
possessed by Capt. Haines and Sher-
i'll Blanchett, this was prevented.
Jennings, upon the assurance of these
gentlemen that he should not be
lynched. made full confession, stat
ing that the woman was the cause of
the entire matter, and upon promise
of marriage from her he committed
the deed. After the coroner's in
quest an examination was held be-
fore Captain Haines, justice of the
peace. at which the woman also con-
fessed to being implicated in the MUIR
der. Both of the prisoners were
committed, and viii be taken to Sicr-
ra Amarillo TO be placed in jail.


Jesse Lewis, the murdered man,
was well-known in Canon City and
counted his friends host. Himself
and family lived for several years up
on ranch on Four Mile creek. Some
two years ago, we believe, he became
interested in property in New Mexico
and Jennings was a partner in the
business with him, and had lived
with him here as hired man. About
six months ago Mr.. Lewis moved his
family down to their new home. He
was nephew of Mrs. Geo. t. Phillips
of this city, aud man respected and
liked by all who knew him. His wife
is a neice of j. j. Minor, Esq, and
lived in his family about six months
when they were residents of Sioux
City, Iowa. She was never liked by
many and bore an unenviable repu-
tation for her violent and ungovern-
able temper. The first news of the
horrible crime received here was on
Sunday night i'll letter from the
woman to Mr.. Minor, begging him
to come for her children as she was
in Jail, and a letter to Mr.. Phillips
from w. 3. uaines, Esq, the Justice
before whom the criminals were ex-
amined. No particulars were given
in either letter. Mr.. Minor left for
the scene on Monday.

| IL.George William Burdett was born


May 28th, 1842, in Licking county.


Ohio, from thence removing to Iowa.


OF his early life we have no record,


which must nave been one of toll and
seems to have occurred for


gaining an education, a lack of


which he constantly remarked his


children should not suffer. Leaving
Pleasan:ville, Iowa, he reached Colo


rado in July, 1860, and went at once


to the mines at Hamilton, Fairplay


and Breckenridge, where he followed
mining several seasons, and hunting


during winter. He was at one time


a companion of the somewhat noted
Il ""Buck skin Jo }"" for whom the famous


Buckskin town and mine was named.


His selfpossession, nerve and repu--


tation as dead shot soon brought


him into notice and for several years,


wi hen there was q particularly troub-
lesome job on hand lie was the one


selected, or most usually the one vol
unteering, to do it. Whether in the


mountains or valley he was terror


to evil doers and his indomitable
courage contributed not little to


the preservation of law and order,


and consequent public security in the


exciting early days of this state. In


1861 he, with another man, pursued


and captured, near Denver. some men


who had committed bold robbery of
many thousand dollars at Brecken-
ridge, turning them over to the
authorities there and protecting them
/ from the violence of an excited mob,


bent upon lynching ,them-no easy
task in those days. Later, in the
winter of 1852, while hunting with
; Henry Coy, well known to the old
settlers here, he came to the camp of
!. a man with a family who had started
= hunting with Mexican employe in
> the morning. Late in the day the


Mexican returned saying the other
c man was following a band of elk.
9 His movements seeming suspicious,
G Burdett and Coy took the back trail
. through the snow and in due time
), found the white man murdered,
= thrown into a ravine and covered


with brush. Returning to camp they
n found the Mexican had skipped out,
y and though in the night, they at once
e took his trail and overlook him at a
Z. Mexican settlement on the Green
r horn. They started with him back
l. TO camp intending to bring him to


Canon, but being footsore from wet
feet and long travel the Mexican mar
! aged to take the lead. As long as
~ they could they followed on, but at
= length from fear of losing him they
Is called him to stop but he, thinking
,s himself secure, started to run when

h three and four hundred yards, shot
him dead in his tracks, where he was
left. One of our old settlers recol.

/. but il the contrary prevailed it need
: ed no long apprehension to appreciate


the fact. His manly integrity, love


of justice and truth, honesty and


straightforward purpose, to the ex-
tent of his ability, could not be
doubted. La 1854 he was one OF the
foremost of party pursuing the SO.
called guerrillas, headed by Jim and
John Reynolds, making the night at
tack ON their camp, utterly surpris-
ing and scattering them and essential
ly contributing TO their final capture


which soon followed. He also ncted


as guide and scout for Capt. Kerber's


company of the First Colorado cayaI-


ry, which was stationed at this place
for some months of that year. He
was one of the most active members
in that summer of several parties on
the trail of the murderous Espinosas,
who marked with blood their devious
! way through this section, and were
finally brought TO bay on High creek.
J a few miles north OF Canon, where


one was killed and the other driven


out of the country. In all his nunier-


GUS expeditions he rarely received


even his ordinary travelling expenses,


always ready when duty demanded


but modestly making no demands


for well doing. In 1857 he was mar


ried to Miss Fanny Griffin, happy


union in all respects and by whom he


had two daughters, now nine aud
twelve years old. Latterly he has


been in the employ of the state as


guard at the penitentiary position


not admitting OF much mention but


where on several occasions he has


done Yoeman's duty. in preventing es-


cnpes of prisoners and retaking those


that through others carelessness had |


gotten away. Burdett has gone-the |


first OF our Fremont Pioneers to cross


the dark river. If he has done evil


let 1t be forgotten, but let his men,


ory be cherished and ever kcpt green


for any good he had, was or has been |


in the life called away in its prime."

CHICAGO, Jan. ""A wholesale, cold-blooded
murder occurred mile south of Otis, Ind,
Friday night. James Augustine and family
lived in that place, and had considerable
property, with generally money in the
house. During the afternoon, Henry Angus
tine, nephew Of James, came from Chicago
and tried vainly to get them to drink from
bottle, which proved to have contained pois-
oned whiskey. About II o'clock at night, he
got up from his bed, sought the bedroom of
James Augustine, and levelfng a revolver, be-
gan firing. Mrs. Augustine was SO badly
wounded that she died to-day. James Angus
tine was shot in the breast and will probably
die. Henry ran from the room after firing
several shots. The sons, hearing the firing,
came down, and Christian Augustine demand
ed Of Henry, whom he met in the kitchen,
what he meant Henry replied with a bullet,
killing him instantly. He gave parting shot
at the younger brother, James, which only
made slight flesh wound, and then coolly
went to his uncle's room and demanded ad-
mission, assuring them he was all right and
wanted to help them. James, the son, got the
revolver from him, put him in the kitchen and
locked the door. Henry escaped, barefoot and
hatless, and has not yet been captured Lynch
ing will probably follow his capture."

The Tragic Farce at wash fngtons


Everybody appreciates the position of
Judge Cox. Like everybody else, he is
aware that Guiteau is guilty and has
absolutely no defence, and simply be-
cause Guiteau has no defence he Is more
careful to give him every chance and TO
avoid all appearance of harshness TO-
wards him than II IL were doubtful
whether Guiteau was the wilful mur-
derer of General Garfield. This is a
very proper feeling 80 long as 1t is not
suffered TO thWart the orderly admin
stration of justice. But for low three
days Guiteau has not only been intensi-
flying the public detestation of him
which in itself may moi be bad thing
but he has been obslructing the ad-
ministration of justice, and his actions
have tended TO bring Judge Cox's court


nto public contempt. No judge Is
called upon to stand this, even from so
pitiful q wretch as Guiteau. Moreover,
no judge is justified in making threats
which he does not mean to execute.
Judge Cox has for these three days been
threatening to put Guiteau out Of court
II Guitesu did not behave himself. At
ter Guiteau had once misbehaved HIM
self with impunity, the threats only
seemed to make him more impudent,
and yesterday he actually defied the
Judge to put stop 10 his Interruptions.
1t has the semblance Of injustice, no
doubt, to try man In his absence, and
this is probably the [eason why Judge
Cox has not before this executed his
threat. But II Guiteau were restrained
say with q gag-from interrnpting
the proceedings of the court, or put into
the custody of bailiffs instructed to tap


him on the head whenever he opened
his mouth to address the Court, but to
allow him to make suggestions TO his
counsel, the en- s OF public justice aud
of public decency would beth be served.
The trial of Guiteau emphasizes the
| complaint which almost every trial for
murder justifies OF the absurd dilatori-
ness of The ad ministratlon of justice In
| criminal cases. This Is sometimes des-
| cribed as q weakness of the ""Apglo-
Saxon race"" In fact, however, our
practice is very much worse than the
English In this respect. The indictment
there follows the capture more quickly,
the trial the indictment, the conviction
The trial and the execution the convic-
tios. An English criminal trial Is much
shorter as a rule than a criminal trial In


this country. Guiteau's trial would not


last more than week If his trial were
10 be had IN England, and his execution


would follow within fortnight of his
conviction. Let alone The absurdity of
taking up weeks of what is supposed TO


be the valuable time OF court in case


which has already been virtually tried,


and Of maintaining Guiteau at the


public cost,L exemplary effects of pun


ishment, for which only, according to


some jurists, we are entitled to infllct


punishment, are weakened with every


needless day that elapses between the


crime and the punishment.


If Guiteau had been hanged and


served right by mob ON the day of the


murder, the lynching would have been


disgracetui, of course, to the people of


Washington, but it would have had q


wholesome effect upon persons who


were considering whether or not they


should commit murder. 1t is not neces-


sary to lynch a murderer in order to


punish him so promptly as to strike ter


ror into other evil doers. The Pressi-


dent has been dead for two months. 1t


Is reproach to our administration OF


justice that his murderer should still be


alive. And IL is not by reason OF any


defect In our law that his murderer ID


still alive, but merely by reason of q


habit of dawdling which seems TO be
common to all our courts. They seem
TO proceed upon the assumption not only


that it is better 10 do justice deliberately
than to run the risk Of doing injustice


hastily, which is entirely true, but thai


so long as justice is done 1t does nsl


much master whether or not it Ii


promptly done-and this Is entirely
false. Granting postponements fol
frivolous reasons, permitting the exam
nation of superfuous witnesses or OF
! ! witnesses on superfuous or irrelevant
points, and the like, are matters within
the discretion of the court, and it Is tht
Judges who are TO blame for permitting
them. In this case 1t is already prove,
that Guiteau shot Garfield, and the
> prosecution has shown express malice
. The prosecution in fact has already
, made out its case. The only possibl
T defense Is insanity. The attempt t.
! show malpractice would be simpl
s t,ifling with the court. After reasons
= BILE number of witnesses upon the poin

MENoMoNIE, Wis, Nov. 17.-The crowd
which for the past few days have been watch
ing for the arrival of the desperado, Ed. Will
liams, were this evening gratlfled with view
of him. A large crowd, somewhat noisy, had
collected st the depot on his arrival, but on
account of the extra precautions taken by
Sheriff severson, no serious attempt was made
to rescue the prisoner, although some few
cried ''lynch him ~ There will, probably, be
no attempt made at lynching, as better coun-
sci seems IS to prevail. He will
be taken tomorrow to Durant, the
scene Of the tragedy, where great
excitement is said to prevail. Sheriff Sever
son, in view of the situation, has placed very
strong force to guard the Jail tonight. The
prisoner now acknowledges himself to be
Ed. Williams, and was recognized by his ac-
quaintances at Hersey and Familiarity called
ED. ;"" while none he seemed to recognize and
answer to as matter of course. There is not
the slightest doubt that this is the genuine
Ed. Williams, and that it was his brother
Lon with him who escaped at the ignorance
and stupidity of the Milwaukee officials
who insisted upon the confinement
of the man, Kuhl, against the advice of the
people of this section, who were better ac-
quainted, and great satisfaction is expressed at
the course of Sheriff Severson in taking an
early position against the movement."

At the entrance of the engine house
were gas jets blazing forth In myriad
sparks Of fire the word ""welcome."" Ush-
cred Into the capacious parlor OF the
building, the guests were greeted BY the
smiles and presence Of many Of Harris
burg's fair daughters, who had arranged,
under the supervision of Mrs. w. p.
Coulter In the centre of the room large
banqueting table, flled with everything
that possibly could be found In season.
Adorning the centre of the table was q
very handsome pyramid of fruit, arrang-
ed by Mr.. a. Laubenstine, of Dan Ba-
cons establishment, but presented by
Mr. John Banks, member Of the com.
pany.


William O. AcF Adden, Esq, then well
coined the visitors in an address, the
tenor of which and the manner of Its de-
livery could not fail to impress those
from his heart, and that he but echoed
the suppressed feelings OF bis fellow
members. He referred to the happy
visits each had made to the other, the
friendship those visits had engendered,
and hoped that the present visit wouli
only tend to augment the feelings that
should and he knew would always exist.
Ex-State Senator Sharpley, now presi-
don't Of the Wilmington City Council.
responded for the guests. de spoke
feelingly Of the manner Of their recep-
ton, OF their past association with the
Friendship, Of the handsome group pict-
ure they had received, and then, turn.
Ing bis attention to the edibles that so
temptingly lay spread before them, face
tlously remarked upon the ""g0od stay

were lengthy and repeatedly applauded.
The guests then did ample Justice to
Of Mr.. and Mrs. Traub and daughters,
Frank II. Lieb made neat speech, in
which he presented the Wilmington boys
with very elegant vase of wax flowers.
Mr. Sharpley responded In his usual
pleasing and happy manner, and knew
that when the gift was p &C I'D In the COL
lection Of tokens from this city, that the
names of the donors would not soon be
forgotten.


During the balance Of the evening tho
guests were shown through the city and
then escorted to their quarters at the
Jones House. This morning they accom-
panied the Friendship boys on their
third annual excursion to Mont Alto
Park, which was participated in by
very large number of our cltizsns."

 On the cross examination witness said he had often seen this buggy he had mentioned and knew it as Mir. Malley's carriage I have seen brown and black horse both hitched to the same carriage; think should recog- nize the horse if should see it again.

 In reply to Judge Blydenburgh, witness said if ten thousand witnesses should say that that buggy was out to Woodbridge at that time it would not shake his belief.

 The next witness was Charles s. Barry. He testified as follows I am car driver on the Fair Haven and Westville horse rail- road ; I remember Friday, August 9th i; I was driving car No. 22 that week; I know James Malley. jr., by sight have known him four or five years I cannot say positive ly whether I saw James Malley, jr., on Thursday or Friday except from conversation with MT. Hull, the last witness on the Sat- urday that the body was found, however, 1 fixed the time as Friday.

 Witness then testified in corroboration of the previous witness about seeing James Nal ley, jr., drive up Whalley avenue at g rapid rate, and as to the description of the horse and buggy, and also as to the time he stopped in front of his fathers house and the direc- ton he took on leaving. He continued in confirmation of Hull's evidence.

 On the cross examination witness said he now felt quite positive that the time he saw James Malley, jr., was on Friday evening in- stead of Thursday evening.

 The next witness was Mary Ann Lynch. | She said: I have been called Minnie Lynch since was 8 little girl; she said she some | times took the time of the clerks at Malley's | store in place of Miss Kennedy. The time book was produced; she said she took the time on Wednesday, August 4; James Nal | ley came in that morning at 7:45, went to | dinner at 12:45, and came back at o'clock; | on Thursday he came in at 7:45, went to din | ner at HAS, and returned at 2:35; on Fri day, August 9th, he came in at 7:45, went te | dinner at 1920, and returned at 2:15; or l Saturday he came in at 7:45, went to dinner l at 1 o'clock, and returned at 2:1o.' Ths

 cross-examination did not reveal anything O

 importance.

 It was now 4:30 p. m., and counsel for th'

 State announced that they had no other wit

 nesses They also stated that they woult

 probably be able to close the rebuttal evi dence today (Tuesday) at neon, provided tn

 cross examinations were as short as those o

 the previous witnesses on the rebuttal ha'

 been Should this be the case the sur-rebut tai may commence this afternoon, and pre-

q much better attendance at the fair,
this afternoon, the number present pro-
badly exceeding two thousand. The
racing was also better and the exhibits
In more attractive shape.


In regard to the latter the ladies' de-
pariment continues to be the chief obs
ject of interest, and Is decidedly the
haudsomest and NEST entertaining fea-
ture Of the fair. 1t is both practical and
ornamental. The vast array of pre-
served fruits, jellies, bread, cakes and
pies show the emlnently practical minds
of the ladies making these exhibits,
while the ornamental ls evidenced BY
numerous articles Of embroidery, fancy
needle work, crocheting, etc. All the
exhibits are tastefully arranged, and the
whole effect Ii beautiful.

THE RACES.


II was only few minutes after one
when the races commenced, but 30 mis-
erably were they managed and allowed
TO drlg that 1t was after six o'clock when
the last heat was trotted. These delays
are provoking at any time, and particu
lsrly so when 1t is clearly apparent they
could have been avoided. 1t is sxasp or.
sting to the people whose presence and
money make the fair financial success,
to see the judges leisurely sitting back,
feet cooked up and cigar In mouth, ap-
pareutly unconcerned whether the next
heat was called on In halt q minute or
half an hour. And yet this was the case,
yesterday afternoon, and people who
felt impelled to leave on the 5.35 train
north, only saw the first heat of the 2.33
race--the best trot of the dav-and had
not Sherman Morgan taken this race In
three straight heats It probably weuld
not have finished until morning. And
yet, BY prop ,r management, all the races
could have been finished by half-past
five O'Clock.


1t may not be out Of place, In this
connection TO suggest that the manage
ment make some improvement In the
arrangements for publicly displaying the
time of each heat. The miserable little
blackboard ON which 1t is illegibly
chaiked is played out farce, unworthy
q trotting course of fifty years ago. One
half Of the people cannot Gee the figures,
and rs but few understand correctly
when 1t Is Announced by the Judge, the
bulk Of the spectators are frequently kept
for some Tins in Ignorance of the most
important point In the race.


The first race, this afternoon, was the
2 80 class, for Peninsula horses, In which
there were SIX starters. Four heats were
trotted, Olivette, entered by G. II. -Adair,
Of Bell Haven, Va. and VIM. II. Arm
strong's Davy Copperfeld, from FAIR
Hill, Cecil County, taking the next
three heats straight. In this race the
horses kept we'll together, and the con-
test was pretty and spirited.


Las race, which, in > main oints was
similar to the first race. Elwood r. took
the first heat In good style, but the Phil
adelphia gray mare, Lydia K, teok the
next three in good style and regular or.
der. Keystone Maid, entered by VIM. K.
Stockley, of Wilmington, made . poor
showing 10 this race, and yet did some
very good trotting. She would not come
up at the start, but On the first quarter
would pull up with the rest, make q
good struggle for lead, break badly and
fall to the rear again. This was her con-
duct In every heat, aud she brought up
the rear In three hea'c..and cnly succeed
ed in getting flfth position. There Is
evidently more In this mare than was
brought out of her yesterday.


The 20 race was the prettiest dash
of the fair. There were Only four star
ters-SheIman Morgan, the favorite
Dover stallion, Budd Doble's Membrino
Charter, John Rideys bay gelding
White6eld, and Roy Gould, . bay mare,
entered by Gel. Z. w. Conoyer, Of Mid
dletown, N. J. There was considerable
talk about the Gould mare, and betters
put their money on her quite freely, but
although she won the poll she was dis.
tanced In the first heat, which Sherman
Morgan took in good style In 1854.
Doble and Whiteield tried hard to win
this heat but Sherman never lost the
lea ne took from the start, and threw
d. their eyes all the way around.
4 second and third heats were ex-
citing only In respect to the struggles Of
Charter and Whiteield for second posi-
tion, as 1t was only ordinary amusement
for Sherman Morgan to keep the lead
each time. The Dover horse was hand
somsly applauded at the end Of each
heat. Below IS summary Of each race.

horses owned on the Peninsula with no

soon take a step which is of highest
importance to the people of the United
States. Having failed in reconstruction
by reason of the halfheartedness of a
large element of most pretentious Repub-
licans in the North, the way has been
cleared for restoration. The latter is
much more desirable, but seemed impos-
sible at the time the former was at
tempted.


The spirit of national patriotism is
growing in the South. The leadership of
Malone in Virginia has separated the
Progressives from the Bourbon De-
mocracy. The authority of the Nation
and the rightsof the people, black as well
rs white are being upheld by men who
have all their lives been Democrats, but
who declare that Bourbonism shall rule
no longer. The black men of Virginia
must see to it that these friends are not
driven away from them. They must
strengthen their hands and frown down
the efforts of few designing men to
sacrifice the substance of an anti-Bourbon
victory for the shadow of straight Re-
publican ticket.


BLACK MEN OF VIRGINIA. If you follow
the lead of men who are being caressed
and petted by Bourbon Democratic lead
ers you deserve to lose your liberty, and
you will lose it. There is no tenet of the
Republican faith left unfulfilled except
the enforcement of your political rights.

out in Virginia in 1877, and made no show

 TOMBSTONE, March 2l.-Wi.iams, the agent for WelIs, Fargo & Co.,. who was out with the party pursuing the stage robbers, returned last night, leaving five men, including Bob PaUl and the Earp brothers, stIii on the trail of the robbers. At one time the pursuers were campcd only one and a half miles from the murd,rer-. One of the horses belonging Go the robbers was taken aud brought in. The robbers are three in uJGnhcr and the determined efforts of the pursUeI s will doubtless Oycrtake them before they quit the trail After attacking the stage the robbers left the Sau Pe- drO Valley and went toward the DTa- goOn mountlins. They then returned by q most tedious ZiZ-ZgE route Go the San Pedro, about 60 miles below the scene of the robbery, crossed the river and left in The direction of the Santa Catalina mountains. Rewards amount ing to about Sl400 are offered for tine capture of the robbers. Their names are known

 Furiher-Sherif Behan and Mar shal. Wells, Fargo & Co.'S agent, re- turned yesterday from the pursuit of the stage robbers, bringing Lew King, who is known 10 be implicated in the affair, but who was not an actual par ticipant in the attack on the stage. When Behan and Williams left De- tective Paul and hIs four companions they were 15 miles from here in the San Pedro Valley, and about ten hours behind the robbers who are al- most certain to be caught It is inti- mated, though not auihoutively known. that the authorities here have in their possession positive Iniorma- tion which identifies the four road ! agents and their silent GCCOmplices, numbering nine nien in all, and that arrests will be made as soon as every thing is ready, meanwhile it Is cer- tain that several men around town. among them one who was a partici- pant in the preliminary pursuit, are under surveillance. Paul and his party captured one Of the robbers horses, which had broken down. King was supposed 10 be on his way tO join the fieen@ robbers with intel hgence of the pursuit, ammunition, etc. as his pockets were full of cart ridges, and other articles we,e cap tured. He Is in 10 danger ot lynch ing.

Another Important Revelation

A Private Session of the Jury Last

 Night.",,"sporting man of Boston, who was in the grove at Savin Rock on Thursday and Friday even ings, August and 5. and saw the transac- tion on the flying horses when young lady, | presumably Jennie Cramer, manifested signs | of dizziness and asked piteously for the fly | ing horses to be stopped. Further than that l it does not appear that he knows anything about the tragedy, though at first it was thought he might know something about it. l He was in West Haven yesterday, saying that he was waiting for the jury to call him if they wanted him. He said he wanted to get away, having something to attend to, and could not stay around much longer. He was going back to Boston and would leave his address and if they wanted him they would know where to find him.

 However, the jury did not meet, and there was considerable speculation as to when they would meet. Members of the jury were seen and they thought the jury would not meet again before the latter part of the week, though one juror half ex- pected summons would be out for meet ing to-day or tomorrow. The jury have more evidence to hear, and they expect to wait until they hear the report of Dr. Chit tenden as to the results of his chemical anal ysis The jury maintain reticence as to the exact causes which led to the decision to have chemical analysis made BLANCHE DOUGLASS. No end of inquiries are still made by peo- pie visiting the Rock as to where the stick with the rag on top is, which marks the spot where the body of Jennie Cramer was found, and numberless inquiries are made as to which is the house where Blanche Douglass is detained a prisoner. Rumors were rife yesterday again that she had been transferred to quarters at the jail, but up to o'clock last evening she had not arrived there and no expectation of receiving her there was then entertained. A ripple of excitement was created yesterday by the return to West Haven of James Reilly, Blanche Douglass lover. He came yesterday morning from New York, brought up by man, Walter Travers, whom Deputy Sheriff Peck had despatched to New York for the purpose. What object was in view | in this maneuvre was not exactly divined, but it was surmised that it was in pursuance of plan to give Blanche one more oppor- | tunity to tell sthe truth, the whole truth, | and nothing but the truth"" or else go to | durance vile. How much value is to be at | tached to Blanche's testimony is puzzler to l many people, and since the new testimony ! of last week showing that she did not tell the truth to the jury at that mysterious mid night session with her, it is felt that not ! much dependence can be placed upon her l statements. The State Attorney, MT. Doe- little, when asked as to whether it was best to send her to jail, replied that if sending her to jail would bring out 8 new story from her, the new revelation would be open to the same doubt that attaches to the others. Many people are convinced that she could tell great deal more if she was 8 mind to, and this view is made stronger as the testi- ! mony of MT. Mattoon and Mrs. Miller shows that she was untruthful in saying that she never saw Jennie Cramer alive after that Thursday noon According to those wit nesses, she was with Jennie many hours later on that Thursday than she said in her sworn evidence. - MORE LETTERS.

 Sheriff Peck received a letter written in German yesterday, which stated that thou sands of people believed that the jury was 8 bought complot, :"" and that ''the State as well as the jury, deserved lynching, the same as is extended in the West; that the general belief was that the Malleys killed the girl"" and signed z. Another letter was written in lead pencil, and read

 WEST HAVEN, August 27tb.

 Mrs Peck:

 The Woman detained at your house with so many Aliases to her name is deceitful and treacherous place her. when She free and there not much doubt but what She will be; for Sorry to Country then She will Laugh at you all, and tell you game; wee would be Afraid to have So dangerous a person under Our roof why her very mode of Hveing Ifs enough for you to fear. if nothing Else being ! Common prostitute. now take the advice of your we'll wishers, and have her safely lodged in jail till

 the sentiments of the People THE FLYING HORSES.

 Yesterday forenoon Harry Ford, the black moustached man, went to Chief Webster's office, accompanied by MT. Richardson, of Waterbury. Mr. Richardson's story is that he was at the shore that Friday night, August 5, with Harry Ford, to amuse himself, and that he saw Sheriff Peck and fell in with him, and walked with him in the grove. He was attracted to the sheriff because he saw he was an officer and because he looked like friend of his Joe Peck, and he stepped up to him and asked him if his name was not Peck; they thus became acquainted lit tie, as he said for companion sake. ""When I was near the flying horses there was no one on them. There were four persons that saw sitting on 8 bench in the grove, two ladies and two gentlemen. never saw them before, and would not be able to identify them again. I was not on the flying horses that night. I never saw Jennie I Cramer alive. I saw the body on the beach the next morning A lady whom I did not before. I said that had not. never had seen the lady before, I know that there was conversation testified to about what I said that morning. but the woman was mistaken. |""

 ANOTHER STORY.

 Henry O. Allen proprietor of the printing establishment in Garfield building, is reported to say that he saw James Malley, jr., and Jennie Cramer in carriage on Chapel street, on Friday evening, Aug. 5. It was going rapidly. He was quite positive it was Jennie Cramer as he had known her by sight good while, but was not so positive as to James Malley, jr., but thinks he could tell if he should see him whether he was the man or not.

 The New York Tribune, commenting upon the jury in the case, says: ""In the Cramer investigation, for example, the Con- necticut jurymen have assumed the charac- ters of detectives, and have followed up fam cied clues and worked out theories born of personal prejudices, until they have devel- oped themselves into prosecutors and have become united for the simple duty which the law imposes on them of discovering by what means the unhappy woman came to her death. Their investigation is an elaborate trial of the two young men and one woman who are suspected though not absolutely charged with killing the poor victim. At the rate they are going on we shall not be sur prised to hear of their bringing in verdict of guilty and the coroner pronouncing sentence of death.""

BALTIMORE, Sept. 21.--A special


from Washington TO the American says:
Gas stated in these dispatches last
night, the guard at the Jail was incraas-
ed. Increase was made on order ofAd-
ljntant-G General Drum. The latter stat.
ed this afternoon that the present guard
was, in his opinion, sufficient. He did
not fear any attack upon the jail. On
tee question of guarding Guiteau, a
new point has been raised. The Jail is
the property of the United States.
Under the law the army can be called
upon to guard the Jail with all it's con-
tents, which include Guiteau. But u.
8. troops can not be used te guard Gui-
teau after he is taken from the Jail.
The posse coIlitatus clause Of the Army
bill, passed two years age, forbids such
use Of troops. While Guiteau is in a
U. S. Jail he can be guarded by U. S.
troops; but ust as soon, however, as he
is taken from the jail lie must be hand
ed over to the civil authorities; and upon
them devoIves the duty of protecting
him. Under the posse comitatus clause
of the Army bill, military jurisdiction
will cease when Guiteau is once taken
outside he walls of the Jail by the civil
authorities.


GUlTEAU WAS NOT INFORMED
of the death Of the President until Jhis
morning. The news was impaired to
him by Warden Crocker. The latter,
believing that Grliteau suspected some-
thing, visited the assassin's cell well
General, Guiteau asked, pressing his
tace against the iron bars of his door,
What news from the President q
Crocker lodged reply, and Guiteau
said: ""You can't fool me, General;
there is something up. Crocker then
said well, the President is dead
rs that SO? cried ont Guiteau, with
some excitement: when did he die?'
Last night. We'll, was the answer,
the whole matter is in the Lords
hands. l have felt grieved because the
President suffered so much, and l am
glad that his suferings are all over. l
hope that God has saved his soul. l
have been praying for it. AS for me,
have carried cut the Lords will
Guiteau then retreated to tie rear of
His CCll ttlltl ltlu5Cu W toilN CloC ALoACs
About 8 o'clock this afternoon, how
ever, he became nervous and prayed a
great deal, and, calling guard, asked
if there was any probability of any
attack by mob upon the Jail. The
guard assured him that he was safe,
and when the latter went away Guiteau
began to sing a hymn in deep bass
voice that resounded and echoed
through the corridors of tie Jail. lie
sang for half an hour, and then took a
seat at his table and resumed writing
upon his life.


RUHORs OF LYNCHING.


""Consdera lie anxiety was expressed
here to day over various r+mors with
reference to car loads of roughs from
New York. Trenton, New Jersey, Phila-
delphia, Baltimore and other points,
who were coming here to lynch Guiteau.
These stories circulated all day, and as
a result, the depots were constantly sur
rounded by crowds of people. 1t also
stated that the greatest number would
arrive here at the Baltimore and Poto-
mac depot at 4 O'Clock. There was a
large assemblage of people at the depot
to meet the train. The train was de-
iayed about 40 minutes, aud those who
waited had the pleasure of seeing a
small party Of Ladies and gentlemen
file quietly through the gates into the
depot. The only party of roughs who
came here was the party from Balti.
more, who came over last night under
the command of ""a man named Long.
They are still here. The front of the
jail was draped in mourning this after
noon.

Everything at the jail is quiet this

TO he engaged in writing his reflections

who have examined the statutes that

accounts for the fact that the few local

as to the recently inaugurated policy
of that party. Toy have not yet
heard that the parry has latterly taken
the ''rebel sympa hizer"" under its
wing, and the old cry of confederate
Brigadler has become popular with
the party. In fact it is free passpor,
to the good will of the party. These
Kentuckians possibly have not heard
that at Lynchburg, Va, a one-armed
and one-eyed Union soldier, h wing
lost both his arm aud eye in fighting
the battles of the Uuion, was thrown

fhe zeal of Virginia Bourbons TO pre-.
vent their State suffering ut the hands Of Read
justers appears highly commcndable especially so
when we consider that many who are absorbed in
regard to the payment of the State debtor rather
In the promise to pay-haye never condescended
to liquidato the claims held against themselves.
This utter contempt Of private affairs and jealous
guardianship Of the public veal is magnificent
example of unsellsh patriotism But the intense
interest manifested by Democrats in every section
of the Union in behalf of the Republican party OF
Virginia is probably the most remarkable event OF
this eventfu year. One would suppose that the
Bourbons had not time to spare In looking after
the interests Of other political organizations con-
sidcring the sad condition Of their own. Perhaps
they are convinced that their party is too nigh
dead to inspire any hope Of rcsuscitation. What
ever may be the cause this nervous anxiety for the

The disparity of numbers in this fight was
very great, but notwithstanding this fact

IFRoM SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE TRIBUNE.l


PETERSBURG, Aug. 14-The weather in Virginia
hot, but not much hotter than Virginia politics.
On every side one hears among the Bourbons ex-
pressions of disappointment at the action of the
Lynchburg Convention They had been led to be-
eve by of their Republican allies that the Re
publican organization in this State could be turned
into machine to aid the election of the Bourbon
State ticket with the remote hope of electng Re-
publican United States Senator by trade with the
Bourbons. The result is a disappointment both to
the Bourbons and to certain Republican leaders,
who, strangely enough, appear to be anxious
to enjoy monopoly of political patronage than they
to secure free and fair elections.


The outward result of the Republican bolt at
Lynch5urg on Wednesday vsibly dampened the
enthusiasm of the Bourbon ratification meeting on
Friday evening. There were outward demonstra-
tions of enthusiasm, for Lynchbnrg is the home of
Major Daniel. He had just returned there 10 as
slime, somewhat prematurely, the character of
conquerng hero All day long preparations
making for the evenings performance. As usual
with Bourbon political displays in the Sonth
in small cities, the military feature prominent.
The Lynchburg Home Guards, fully uniformed and
armed, led the column which marched and coun-
termarchcd through the steep and narrow streets
before the speaking began, and afterward they
occupied front seats in the pleasant Opera House
where the meeting held. Following them IN
the procession came the Lynchbnrg Artillery, con-
sisting of two pieces which kept up an irregular
firing for several hours. Lynchburg has six volun
teer fire companies, and these also turned ont in full
form TO beautify the occasion Many of the husi-
ness houses on the main street or less
decorated and Illuminated, and there sporadic
discharges of rockets and Roman candles in several
parts of the town. The population of the city turned
ont in a body to witness the gorgeous spectacle.
ne HnuSe vas uppn Nj
thusastic audience. The capacious stage of the
theatre was thronged with the beauty and fashion
OF Lynchburg, and from the number of ladies pres
ent in the parquet and boxes a stranger might
have thought that the audience had come TO hear n
popular opera After certain tedious speeches by
local orators and the adoption of long string of
Mandatory resolutions, Major Daniel was introduced
TO the audience. Considering that he was on his
native heath, and that the occasion which,
if any could should have inspired him, his speech
was a fiat failure.


THE SENTIMENTS OF MAJOR DANIEL.
He began by saying that - Malone never spoke a
truer word than when he said to some Republican
friend in Washington that the debt question had
become secondary issue in Virginia. He then
touched lightly the debt question: and in that
spect evInced something of a desire to capture
Readiuster votes. He denied that he was opposed
to free schools and declared with great posit
that elections in Virginia have been free, fair and
|
been settled by the adoption of the constitutional
| amendments. He did not, some Bourbons are so
ready 10 do, declare that he was in favor of the
amendments, but against their enforcement for he
made with fine rhetorical flourish solemn promise
that 50 far aS he is concerned no tissue ballots
! or pud ing tickets y shall be used in the coming
political campaign. If such agencies have not been
used hitherto to procure Bourbon success il is diff
cult 10 understand why the speaker considered such
promise necessary. 1t was noticeable that the
thusasm of the audience perceptibly cooled when
ever the orator made any allusion to free and fair
elections. Indeed the audience preserved its wild
est enthusiasm and applause for Jubal Early, who
described himself as an unreconstructei rebel""
The ex-Confedcrate General, whose preiudices
against the Yankees have been inveterate and IN
ncible ever since Sherilans army interviewed"" !""
him and his followers the shenandoah Val ey seven
teen years ago. appeared to be filled with vicious as
well as political enthusiasm but his friends dec ared
that his speech not more Incorporate than usual.
General Early eulogIzel Major Daniel. who, he de-
clared, had won his right TO the confidence of
! Nirgnians by the fathfulncsS with which he had
strug gied under that gorious leader, Stonewall
Jackson for the honor the glory aud the welfare of
| NIrlina.'


This declaration received with rounds of ap-
plause, which fairly shook the building. Another
of General Eary's periods evoked loud applause and
much laughter. 1t was when he expressed the hope
| that they have fumgated this house since the mig
ger Convention vacated it,"" The ""nigger Conven

AN ANTI BOURBON MEETING.

Western Railroad, thirty mics west of Peters
burg. the correspondent of THE TRIBUNE yesterday
attended an Anti-Bourbon political meeting de-
scrbed in local phrase as Il barbecue This meet
ing held in the open air under the spreading
branches of a small grove of oaks. The audience
was composed entirely of people from the sur

five hundred people, all men who work
with their hands, had thus travelled from two 10 a

nomination Mr.. Hatton. 10 be First

several other less important nom,na-
tons, were promptly confirmed: every.
thing was running smoothly, and some
OF the more sanguine Senators express
ed hope that The Senate would be-
ready to adjourn to.morr> "" sina die.


This cheerful prospect was suddenly
clouded, however, when a majority of
the Committee on Post Offices and Post
Roads reported favorably upon the nom.
ination of Nr. Statham to be PustInas-
ter at Lynchburg. Va Mr.. Statham is
the gentleman whose confirmation Gen.
Early and other patriotic Bourbons are
anxious to defeat, because he has left
their ranks and allied himself with the
Liberal movement. Senator Maxey, of
Texas, who is member of the Pos.
once Committee, presented minority
report against Mir Statham, and sup
ported IL in vigorous speech. Senator
johnson of Virginia, Senator Voorhees,
OF Indiana, Senator Bayard and others
spoke on the same side, Nand argued in
favor OF the retention of the present in
cumbent, who has held the office dozen
years, and whose present term of office
will expire twelve days hence.


The ouly objection urged against the
appointment of Mr.. Statham was his
youth, he being, 1t is said, only twenty
three or twenty four years old 1t is
understood that Mr.. Bsyard is the Seu-
ator who thinks Mr. Statham too
young to be postmaster. In the
course OF the discussion Senator Ferry
caused to be read u report of Colonel
Parker, Chief Post Office Inspector, ac.
cording to which it is understood that
the Eres mt Postmaster at Lynchburg
was found to be short in his accounts
last spring some 81 5000. He made the
amount good, however, and in consider
a'ion OF his services as IA Union soldier,
President Garfield decided to give HIM
another trial.


In september last, an examination
~ Wv '''N' "" hh 'hrl'N''i vi WV ! ''t
Office Department showed that the
Postmaster was again short over $1,000.
Ca the 3rd inst. this amount WAS made
good, but the Postmaster's sureiies
were informed by the Department that
the Postmaster was delinquent and
that they would be held responsible
tor the funds Of the office until further
arrangements could be made.


In the face of this official record. it
is said, that Senators Bayard, Voorhees,,
johnson, Maxey and others persisted iu
defending the Postmaster against the
accusation thar he had been IN default,
and they, az well AS all the other Dem
ocratic Senators, expressed determi-
nation to oppose to the las, the contir-
nation of the man whom President
Arthur has nominated as his successor."

setting aside its own laws, even to punish
SO atrocious a crime as that which Guiteau
has committed. 1t is bound by the very
principles of its existence to give to the
world in this supreme hour an example Of
passionless justice. The assassin must be
tried with all the forms of law. He must
be accorded the privileges which are ex.
tended to all accused persons. And though
it may be true that his wretched life
would be forfeit million times over if the
people were to express their resent
ment toward him without restraint,
it must be remembered that the sacrifice
OF this worthless villain can avail
nothing, for that the evil is done
and is beyond remedy. Nevertheless the
country demands that justice shall be
executed upon him. His case is not one in
which the audacious subterfuges which
have SO often saved murderers from the
gallows viii avail. It is not too much to
say that failure to convict him of murder
in the first degree would almost certainly
be followed by a deplorable resort to
illegitimate methods of vengeance. There
is of course no possible defense for him
which ca- justify hisacquittal. He deserves
to be hanged, and he must be hanged !;
and if he is not sentenced to death
legally and promptly it will be i'm
possible to maintain any public sen.
timent against lynching him. 1t is not
question of satisfaction for the crime he
has committed. OF that there can be no
question. The sacrifice of all his genera
tion would not compensate for the loss Of
President Garfield. But he has committed
amurder a which is very much worse than
an ordinary murder, though the law knows
no distinction of the kind, and it is neces,
sary that he should be destroyed as one de-
stroys venomous reptile. The law Off
GERS viii, il they are wise, hasten on
his trial. There should be q marked ex-
hibition of promptitude in such case


1t will of course be impossible to
find the kind of jury so diligently sought
by counsel for the defense in ordi-
nary murder cases, for public opinion
will not permit the impaneling of dozen
idiots, aud no twelve men of any other
kind can be found who have not expressed
an opinion on the case. Such difficulties,
however, must be set aside. The man must
be tried, and the fact that the verdict will
be foregone conclusion will detract in no
way from the significance of the proceed
ings. Were it'possibls under the circum.
stances drumhead Court. martial would
be the most satisfactory way of disposing
Of the scoundrel, but since the Courts have
cognizance of the case it only remains to
insist that they permit no delays in the
judicial determination of this most mis-
chievons yet insignifcant vermin."

on the Boulevard Montmartre, Paris, one
night recently, which gave rise 10 a very
amusing incident. An American. recent
"" arrived in France. who saw Iannois
throw the corrosive liquid at Marie Du-
bois, at once rushed to the spot, protest
ed against Lannois being handed over TO
the police, and called upon the spectators
20 assist him in hanging the aggressor to
the nearest lamp-post. As no one in the
crowd seemed anxious to second this
impulse, the American ran into a neigh
boring shop himself and bought two
wards of rope On his return he found
Lannois in the hands of two policemen,
to whom he repeated his proposal, and
began TO make running moose in the
cord. The impetuous Yankee was with
difficulty made to understand that the
expeditions law of Judge Lynch is not SO
generally applied in the Paris Bouleyards
as in certain outlying districts of the
great Republic."

Would it not be better for Mr. A belle,
chairman of the Street Committee and
Mr.. l.. =. Lynch, Street Commissioner
to attend to the cleaning out Of the traps
placed III the several CUTTERS of the
streets as they are all full of dirt since
the recen; rain. If raiE would now
occur, the dirt would all be carried into
the Christiana river,al.d the city would
lose all the benefit after the construc.
ton of said traps at over twice the cost
they might have been built for had they
been let oIt by contract, rs required by
a city ordinance, instead of being let tC
a well known worker in the fold of the
unterrifed by the day. From present
appearances the only way to attract
them to any locality is to erect beer
saloon near where you would have
them to be found. Now it strikes the
writer that it is bad enough to have
officials that drink to excess without
the city furnishing them horse and
carriage to go from place to place on
these excursions.


Things ar"" coming to a pretty pass
when even ""Pat"" Gardner can no lon
ger put up with the doings of these two
city officials. Is it not high time our
City Council is eX tmining into the mat
ter, or are they 50 full OF redistrcting
the city roads to the river, that they
cannot take time to correct this abuse

alsas Bg-Nosed George, one Of the Elk
Mountain murderers and infamous road
gent whose Is under sentence TO be hanged
April I'd. attempted to break Jail this morn
ifg at Rawlins. He got his shackies OH,
with which he attacked the jailer when he
entered the corridor to lock the prisoners in
their cells for the night. The jailers wife,
hearis.g the conflict, had presence OF mind 10
lock the outside door, locking the jailer IN
with the prisoners. An alarm was then CIV
en- and large number of citizens fastened
to the Jail and released the jailer and Sc
cured the prisoner. He will be double
ironed and strictly guarded until the day OF
his execution. This action of George is sur
prising, since he has always manifested
contrite spirit and didn't desire trial, plead
ing guilty to the indictment and desiring 10
be hung. When sentence was passed nc
went like child and broke down complete
ly, and said his health was failing. In coh-
seuucnce of these facts he has gained much

made and all desire to see him suffer death

q distance of more than five hundred |
miles, and at some points is not more
than dozen miles wide. A Democratic
Legislature, governed solely by partisan
considerations, gerrymandered"" the
State and created this long and narrow
district lhence the name Shoestring),
with view to including therein, so far
rs possible, the colored voters of the State.


The bottom lands of these counties are
unequaled for productiveness, and here
cotton grown in the greatest abundance
and perfection therefore most inviting
field is presented to the industrious
colored laborers, who constitute almost
the entire population of the district. The
colored voters therein exceed the white
by at least fifteen thousand


The Democratic legislators well under
stood this, and the district, when formed,
was known and conceded by them to be
""hopelessy Republican""


The object of making such congress
sional district is apparent. 1t was simply
to consolidate the colored vote into one
for the purpose of affording the Demo-
cratic minority better opportunities in
others. Fraud and violence were soon
after inaugurated at elections and prac-
! ticed with such marked success us con-
trolling elements that General James
| X. Chalmers was most unexpectedly
returned as Congressman-elect from
that Republican district, and was seated
| bya Democratic House of Representatives
in 1877. Claiming to have been again
elected, he was admitted to q seat in the
| Forty-sixth Congress, and he has there
fore served four years in that body. No
unprcjudiced, disintcrested, and well-in-
formed person will presume to assert that
he was ever elected by the free expression
at the ballot-box of the voters he falsely
claims to represent.


Public discussion has prior to the late
election been absolutely prohibited in
his district; terrorism has prevailed from
one end of it to the other and the most
glaring and outrageous frauds have been
Systematically perpetrated in the Bour-
bon interest At the risk of being charged
with shaking the bloody shirt"" we beg
leave to remind the present House of
Representatives that widowsand orphans
mourn the lossof husbands and fathers
who were cruelty sacrificed for opinions
sake in the Bourbon manipulation of the
""Shoestring District""


Chalmers again, with unexcelled eff
frontery, presents himself rs the men,
Der from that district, notwithstanding
the fact that Hon. John II. Lynch re-
ceived large majority of the votes octu-
dliy cast and counted ut the congressional
election in 1880. Bulldozing and fraud
having proved inadequate in this in


stance, he now claims seat on
the most flimsy of technicalities-so
flimsy, indeed, that many of his
hitherto Democratic supporters re-
fuse to sustain him in his preposterous
pretensions. The Vicksburg Herald, the
leading Democratic paper of Mississippi,
frankly acknowledges that Mr.. Lynch
was fairly elected, and that he ought to
be promptly seated. The Memphis AUa-
lanche and appeal and New Orleans Times
take the same ground.


As an indication of the political COM
plexion of the district referred to we in


,i.---.'v""1'--- a. A."" danlared result OF
the late State election in the counties ol
which it is composed.


With the election machinery all in the
hands of the Democrats and ingeniously
arranged in such manner as to enable
them to return majorities to suit their
own purposes, the official returns, pro-
claimed by Democratic secretary Of
state, show that King, the Republican
nominee for Governor, received Il ma.
jority of about twenty-five hundred ovel


Lowry, the Democratic candidate


and that King carried seven o.


the twelve counties. Many bal
lot boxes were thrown out on
: various pretenses, all save one in Bolivar
County, and Kings rightful majority was
by this and other unlawful means, greatly
reduced but even Democratic effrontery
was not equal to setting up q claim tina
the district was carried by that party


1t will be remembered that the fimsl
pretext upon which Chalmers now
I. claims seat in Congress is baseC


solely on the undsputed fact tha


upon some of the tickets voted for Mr.
Lynch plain printers dashes appeared
between the names of candidates. Thes,
simple dashes, placed there by the prnte


as matter of taste, it is falsely pretended


were ""dcvices"" and contrary to Stat,
, law; and therefore over two thousanC
votes cast for Mr.. Lynch in Warrci
County alone were arbitrarily thrown on
after they had been counted, thus re
, versing the result known to have beer
reached. Upon this palpable fraud Chal
} mers bases his claim.


, We are fully persuaded that the Hous

of the matter and promptly award MI
Lynch the seat TO which he is clearly en-


titled.

 Il infer, from the fact that the officers of the V. S., do not intimate in their annual report, as has hitherto, been, their custom, what special work they contemplate for an other year, that the matter is as yet undecid- ed, and would like to make a. suggestion to them. Since the Burgesses have removed the fence from the west park, opening it to the people. the V. l. s., could not undertake any. thing which would be more acceptable, ol confer greater comfort dpou the public, thar to lay concrete walks through it. In my opinion there should be two of these walks laid diagonally; one from the corner o Meadow Street to the corner of North Street the other from the Court House corner to tn, northwest corner of the park. At the point o intersection Of these walks, central of tn, pask circular space, say. thirty I feet in di anaeter, should be eoncreted. and comfortabl, :, seats arranged around it, The above, walk .a would prove great convenience to larg, numbers of people and save much time now reQuired'in making the long circuit; while th, ceptre circle and seats would be a. great com fort on summer afternoons and evenings, es- pecially as we have so few shady and pleasan resting places for pedestrians.

tated crowds of people now in the
streets, when Mr.. Lincoln was found
to be as well cared for as possible, the
provost marshal drove rapidly to the
houses Of Messrs. Seward and Stanton.
the secretaries of state and war. who
were reported also to have been
assassinated. AT the first place an
excited and angry crowd Of loyal
citizens were found, and the informa-
ton obtained that Mr., Seward was
then Though just recovering from in
Jur1es received in a carriage accident)
bleeding and almost lifeless from the


blows of an assassin's knife. His
son, too, in the attempt to save the
father, had been struck down, and


both were lying insensible in an upper
bed chamber. A man wearing a con-
federate uniform was met Immediately
opposite the house, and, being ques-
toned, said he was a paroled prisoner.
His gray Jacket was instantly torn
from him and thrown into the park,
and he ordered on his way. In the
agitated condition Of the crowd it is


likely that, in a moment of blind fury,
which then prevailed on all sides had
he not quickly obeyed the provost
marshal's orders he would have been
lynched on the spot. This ex-confed-
crate soldier has never turned up to
tell his story, and among a great
many doubt still exists whether he
had any connection with the man
Payne, who attempted to kill Mr..
Seward and his son William. Why


he was there at that particular time
has never been accounted for in the
minds of the officials, but certain it is
he knew of the fresh tragedy when
he was on the verge of being assailed.


Dispositions for further safety having


been made, the provost marshal went
instantly to the residence of Mr.. Stan
ton, secretary Of war, and thence to
where Mr.. Lincoln was lying, whittier
the former was reported to have gone.


Upon arrival there it was found that
the unlnjured members of the cabinet


had arrived at Mr.. Lincoln's bedside,


and consultation was had and a cabi-


net session Immediately resolved on,


which was held in a back parlor ad join
ing. Mr.. Lincoln was fast nearing


death. After the meeting, Mr.. Stan
ton, to whom the provost marshal


reported for orders, directed the latter
to proceed Immediately to the Kirk
wood house and escort Mr.. Andrew


johnson, vice president elect, to where
the remaining representatives of the
administration then were. Mr.. John
son was found in his room in his shirt


sleeves, sitting with friend, Mr.. Far
well, who had long been on terms of


intimacy with him. The evening
was warm and oppressive. Both
seemed. to be in {; meditative and


silent mood. On being ushered in by
Mr.. Browning, private secretary to
the vice president, the provost marshal
announced the wishes and request of
the secretary of war that Mr.. johnson
would proceed to the house on Tenth
street, where the members of the
cabinet were assembled. Mr.. John
son quietly assented, and putting on
his coat announced to the provost
marshal that he was ready to accom-
pany him. When on the street the
latter asked whether it would
not be advisable to have
guard accompany him as precaution.
In the excited condition of affairs a
hidden danger was supposed by every
one to be lurking in close proximity,
one knew not where. Such was the
unhinged condition of every thing
among the populace sense of insecur.
lty existed on all sides. No one could
tell where new calamity might be
found. To the provost gaurd Mr..
johnson objected. He was then
requested to ride in the buggy of the
provost marshal, as it would be more
safe than moving through the crowd.
where another assassin might be found
who would plunge knife into the
back OF the vice president and easily
Kill him, thus carrying out apparently
the plan of leaving the government
without it's head. Again Mr.. Johnson
objected and said he would prefer
to walk. A whispered conversation
was then held with him on the steps
OF the Kirkwood house, intimating
the great danger possible and urging
provision for safety. Mr.. johnson
was steadfast in declining to go other
wise than alone, but asked the provost
marshal ifhe had any weapons. TO
this he replied that he had a Colts
navy revolver, and reaching to his
breast pocket proposed to give it to
Mr.. Johnson. He said s:No, do not
want it, but as you have that means
of protection it will do should any
thing happen Then taking the
arm Of the provost marshal he pro
ceeded coolly to walk toward Tenth
street by way of Pennsylvania ave-
nue.. Both Imen elbowed their way
through the crowd, with his protector.
and the remaining head of the gov
ernment was jostled about here and
there among the throng. The provost
marshal says he had a great appre-
hension lest Mr.. Johnson should be
recognized and some desperate at
temp his life while in his company.
1t was with a great sense of relief
that, having elbowed his way through
the dense crowd on tenth street above
and below Ford's theatre, he safely
reached the house whene Mr.. Lincoln
was dying, and conducted him to the
room where Secretary Stanton and
the rest of the cabinet were. and the"

DEAR SIR Yours just received
We have no telegraph and no papers.
You will find correct account in
the Santa Fe Daily New Mexican, or
weekly. The facts of the case are
about this:


Mrs. Lewis had fallen in love with
Humphrey jennings. Jennings pro-
posed to kill j. Lewis but the wife
seems to have objected at first
Lewis knew there was something
wrong and had agreed to allow them
to go to Missouri and to allow a di-
yorce. He tried to sell team to OBJ
tain money to send them to Missouri,
but had not succeeded. Early on
July 9TH Lewis went down to water
his garden. Jennings followed him
down, knocked him ON the head with
club, and then shot him, breaking
his neck. He left his body lying in
the bushes all day and went up and
told Mrs. Lewis. At night he buried
him in a hole by ditch and ran
about two feet of water in the hole
over him.


Lewis was soon missed by neigh
bors and search instituted. Mrs.
Lewis used every endeavor TO mis-
lead, but the body was at last found.
Humphrey Jennings confessed and
after a little time Mrs. Lewis did the
same. Sheriff Blancett used every
effort and prevented tho lynching Of
Mrs. Lewis and Jennings and they
are now safe In jail at TERRA Amaril-
Ia. Yours Respectfully,


w. B. HAINEs,


j. p. and Capt. of Militia.

 would be restored to the Department of Missouri, as desired by General

 Pope, and Arkansas would again be- come a part of the Department of the 1 south. This is said likely to happen in any event, and the Department of Arkansas and the Division of tie Gulf

 LYNCHBURG, Aug. 1.-The straightout Republican convention met in Holcomb Hall this morning. The hall was crowded, many readjusters being present in the galleries. The committee on resolutions reported a platform which assumed the whole indebted ness of the State, whereupon several dele gates who were opposed to this withdrew. A chairman of the State Central committee was then elected, J. W. Cochran, the present in- cumbent, being chosen by standing vote of sixty nine, no one else getting any votes for the position. He was then made chairman er-oficto of the Executive committee, the po- sition how held by General W. c. Wickham. The committee on nominations announced the following ticket For Governor, General William c. Wickham for Lieutenant Gov ernor, s. M. Yost, of Stanton; for Attorney General, Judge Willoughby, of Alexandria. A committee was appointed to wait upon Messrs. Wickham and Yost, who were in the ely, and inform them of their nominations. This committee returned accompanied by the gentlemen. General Wickham made vigor- ous speech, in which he arraigned the coai- tionists as enemies of the Republican party. He concluded by declining the nomination, saying that he was constrained to do so for personal reasons. MT. Yost followed and declined the nomination for Lieu tenant Governor. He said he was satisfied that the reasons which prompted General Wickham and himself would be appar- ent and justifable. MT. Poindexter said he was straightout, but thought it was child's play to put up ticket after the declinations of the gentlemen whom the convention had chosen The convention then decided not to make any nominations, as they deemed it inexpedient. but they concluded with great unanimity to hold fast to the principles of the Republican party, ignoring any and all propositions for 8 eadjustment of the debt either national or State. The State Central committee was instructed to issue an address setting forth the actions and principles of the convention. At 1:30 the convention adjourn ed sine de. It is generally believed that the result of the convention will hold intact the Republican organization of the State and the Mahonites will have few followers in the straightout ranks.

CHICAGO, October Especial des-
patches from Bloomington, H., give
graphic details of the lynching there
last night of Charles Pierce, the i'm
prisoned horse thief, wro shot and
killed Jailer Franks while the latter
was conveying INN from one cell to
another in the Jail. The dispatches
say that some OF the best citizens were
in the front ranks of the lynchers.
Leading business men cheered and en-
couraked the lynchers, and women
waved their handkerchiefs with ap-
probation. For two hours the sheriff,
with all his force, the police force and
other officials stood at the Jail door
and fought and pleaded with the iaiu-
rated crowd. When the murderer was
raised for the nrst time, Officer Bailey,
OF the police force, imperiled his lite
by breaking through The crowd and
cutting the rope, letting tho body fall.
Upon the attempt to repeat this act OF
bravery he came near being killed.
The officers called out the Fire De.
partment to Quell the riot by throwing
water on the crowd. When a steam
cD6 'AS ""iAAVOo oh uiO kiouHo Stioo Va
''cut the hose !"" convinced the fremen
that it would not do to undertake to
carry out their instructions, and they
retired. The ringing Of fire bells called
hund. eds more to the scene and added
to the excitement. When the lynching
was imminent dispatches passed bes
tween Governor Cullum and Lieuten~
ant~Governor Hamilton, and the latter
was directed by the Governor to tell
the Sheriff to cali ON the militia to
protect life and property, but it was
known that the militia could not be
assembled. Senator Fifer, formerly
State At orney, and r. b. Porter, State
Attorney, did all they c.uld to quiet
the mob, promising that the murderer
should be tried and punished, but their
pleadings aud promises were hooted
at. ""Justice and The courts are a
farce"" ""We have had too much of
court quibblings,"" and other similar
remarks were shouted at the officers
by the mob, who persisted in their
purpose of lynching Pierce and then
dispersed."

PHOENIX, A. t., Sept. 8.-There
is much excitement here and at
Globe. Two men were killed and
one wounded by Apaches near
Reno. The settlers have gathered
at Green Valley, Reno, Wild Ridge
and Mcdowell. The militia are
organizing everywhere. The mill
itia are calling for arms, and the
acting Governor has telegraphed
the Secretary of War for arms and
ammunition at once. The civil
and military authorities are in the
fullest accord. The chiefs of the
Pimo and Maricopa tribes near
Phoenix offer to provision them
selves and lead their bucks against
the Apaches. The Papagoes are
also anxious to fight the Apaches.
The military are moving every.
where. A great meeting was held
here last night to organize the
militia. One company of cavalry
is now hurryipg to Globe. Acourier
from Mcdowell reports all quiet at
Apache and Thomas. The Indians
are probably scattering In small
bands. The settlers can't wait for
authority, but will kill them on
sight.


Apache NO San Carlos.


CAMP THOMAS, Sept. 7.-Apache
is safe and San Carlos quiet, but
there are two hundred and sixty
bucks belonging to the White
Mountains who are reported by
the agent rs hostile. They have,
30 far as known, killed two men in
Tonto Basin, where Brice has four
companies with more on the road
coming to him. The agent says
that yesterday there were but six
or eight not in. 1t is belived here
that most of those out on passes
have tried to get back. Citizens re-
port parties of Indians coming
down the north side of the Giia
and that they offered no violence,
though IL is charged that some
horses have been run on towards
the agency. But this is probably
only y scare. Troops are arriving
here and on the railroad.

His forehead evidently struck the bridge or run, as it was crushed in and his left arm was crushed at the shoulder beneath the car wheels. The flesh was also torn from one of his hands. The remains were taken to Bishop $ Cullinan's undertaking rooms, and shortly after jury of inquest was summoned to meet before Justice Pinkerman. As the attendance of some of the witnesses whom the jury wished to hear could not be ob- tained to-day the inquiry was postponed to Thursday at 9 o'clock. The Fdrmer says :: ""None of. the witnesses summoned are eye witnesses of the affair, and if there is anyone who saw the whole affair they are requested to come forward and notify the acting coro ner The verdict will probably censure some one for not removing the run, as it has not been used for months, and is an institution highly dangerous to brakemen.

following suggestion:


That the democratic state central COMMITTEES
be convened for the purpose Of recommending
to the COuHty central committees uniform &C
tion ip reference to the fall county elections
We notice that in some counties the commit


tees are preparing to call conventions 10 nom
mate candidates for county offices. Oihel


counties are taking no action The impor


tancc Of uniform party action throughout tht


state cannot be ovcrcstimaed The state cen


trail committee should decide what the duty OF


democratic county committees Is IN the emer


gency that now presents itself.


| Instead OF decision o. the question b. the


Democratic State Central Committee, whose
opinion would be worth about as much as a


toot from tin whistle, why rot take the nee


cssary steps to have decision from the Su'


preme Court Several county clerks have al.


ready announced that when the proper time


comes under the election law which 1t is ar


gued the last legislature unCOnsiitutIonally re.


pealed, for calling the election next fall, they


will refuse to issue such call. There seems to


be no doubt among lawyers that proper man.


damuS case can be made up in time and de-
cision obtained from the Supreme Court, di-


reCting such clerks to Issue the call IN ques-


ton, if the court hold that such is the legal


requirement. or advising him that the call


need not be issued


The FREE TRADER has heretofore ventured
the opinion that no such call IS necessary nor
is it convinced to the contrary by the argu


ment 0i so astutc n !ayman ~ Mr.. Andrew


Lynch. The only point Mr. Lynch makes In
his article on the subject IN Thursdays OF
tawa Rcpubhca1, is tha, the law of the last
legislature repeating the law providing for an
election this fall Is unconstitutional THIS is
at least an admission that If such law Is con
stitutlonal there can be no election, and in that
respect differs with Attorney General McCar.
thy, who maintains chat the elections can be
held whether the law in regard to calling it,
&c, Is observed or not But the repeating law
is constitutional. The constitution says the
Legislature shall pass such laws as shall be
necessary to give effect to It's PROVISIONS. BE.
fore tho constitution was amended the lecisla.
ture, pursuant to its bohest, made the ueces
sary provision for holding the election In 1881
but the constitution having been so amended
as to change the time of holding the election
to 1882, the legislature, in obedience to the
new bchest, changed the law to conform to the
new constitutional provision What else could
it do? II certainly could not provide that one
election for officers whose terms by the consti-
tuition were fixed at two and four years should
be held in 1881, and another election 20 super.
sedc these officers IN one year should bc held
in 1882. The legislature took the constitution
as they found it--as they were sworn to obey
it-and complied with Its provisions strictly
and literally.


What though it did lead to u mudde in
making no provision for the ,ntcrregnum of
one year between the expiration of the terms
Of the present officers and the commencement
Of the new officers to be elected in 1892 That
was the affair OF the trainers of the cons,itu
tlonal amendment, not o, the legislature The
former doubtless reasoned that the case was
'""""N'N""t'y ,''S'oi oy tuC COustltutlOIdl pro
vision, which was left untouched, tha! the
present officers should hold over until their
were elected and qualified; and the
Legislature evidently entertained the same
opinion. But If both were mistaken, and the
officers In question can net SO hold over with
out warrant of some express constitutional
provision there is another constitutional pro.
vision as well as a law to cover the case. The
constitution does confer upon the Governor
powers to ill all vacant judgcsLps by tempo
rary appointment until the next regular eec.
lion, and upon the various county boards to
hll in the same way all vacant county offices.


Let us, then, have decision or dictu,n
Df the Supreme Court on these points Must
there be an election this fall? and if not, how
are the offices which become vacant on the
expiration of the terms of the present officers
70 be filled? DO they hold over until their
successors are elected in 1882 and qualified, or
must their SUCCESSORS for one year be appoint.

THE PEOPLE. e~ as i
of Lyrchburg of both colors are
noble race. They are hospltable and
generous. As far as / was able to
learn there is not much hotel and
boarding house accommodations for
the colored traveller but the colored
people of that city will not allow any
respectable colored man or woman
on hi, or her travels. to suffer for
want of decent board or lodgings.
They will open wide the doors of
their private houses and accomodate
them. 1t is shame that this should
be necessary in any city where there
is public hotel in this free country
But it will be so till the colored peo--
pie learn to demand and sustain one
another in standing up for our rights
The civil laws of this country give ua
the right to be accommodated at any
public hotel or inn or demand Of the
the proprietor the reasons why. We
should form associations throughout
the country for the purpose of SUNG
any hotel or inn keeper fol refusing
equal accommodations to any decent
and respectable colored person..
Were this done, these keepers would
soon get tired of paying FIVE hundred
dollars fine once or twice O month and
would find it to comport much more
with their interest to stop their
: foolishaess "" and discard all distinc-
tion IN account of race or color as
the railroads h0gA dvna where this
1nnuence was brought to bear upon
them. The white people OF Lynch
hurg as far as | could see are polite,
considerate and kind Many foolish
distinctions kept up In Richmond are
discarded there. For instance no
colored lady or gentleman, no mat
ter how decent they may be IN person
or manners can go to decent and
first class soda water fountain in
Richmond and be served. / saw no
such petty and foolish distinctions
in Lynchburg / cannot speak in too
high terms of the politeness and
kindness of the colored people of the
hill city. They are noble people
and deserve great praise for the cred
it which their general good conduct
reflects upon our rece They are in
telligent, refined, thrifty and enter
prising. They are getting hold OF
property, real and personal and are
holding on to it. In doing this they
are doing the thing that will be sure to
make them felt in the community.

them, especially their churches, at

 LYNCHING OF EMORY.",,"Below we present few paragraphs selected at random from our ex- changes, showing the spirit in which the lynching of Emory has been received by the press. It will be observed that the sentiments ex, pressed indicate no disposition to ap prove mob violence, but desire to mete out to criminals of every class a mode of punishment commensurate with the crimes committed by them. It will be interesting reading to Edi. tor Blackburn and other apologists for a slack method of administering justice by the powers tha. be.

 Had the governor allowed the law to take It's course the maa would have been hung by the sheriff in stead of mob and met the fate he so richly merited.-Log Cabin.

 We regret to hear that he was hung illegally. Mob law is always to be deplored. But it is what we expected to result from the injudi- cious use of the pardoning power.- Ozark Democrat.

 The News has no comments to make condemnatory to the act, for while we think that law and order preserved in legal way, yet we are willing to see all men who commit rapes, hung without judge or jury Atkins News.

 Governor Churchill commuted his sentence to 2l years in the peniten tiary, but an outraged people could stand no such an imposition upon them, and took the case into their own hands. We do not believe Tn mob law but if there ever were cases in which it IS justifiable this is cer- tainly one of them.-Van Buren Graphic.

 Our people do not favor mob law but the general sentiment is that Emory got his just deserts. The friends of the poor woman he out ragged and then murdered and to conceal his helllsh crime threw her body Tn Mulberry creek to rot, are not alone in feeling that they could not allow this wretch to escape the death he deserved through executive clemcncy, after he had been lawfully tried and condemned. Mob law should be frowned down, but there is a point when popular feeling be- comes outraged to such a degree that it demands life for life and the hand of justice cannot be stayed. A feeling is getting abroad that it is scarcely worth while to try criminals and burthen the counties with ex- pense since the decisions of the court are set aside so constantly on small pretext. The courts must be respected more by the Governor if he would have the people respect order, otherwise Judge Lynch has only begun his work.-Independent Arkansian."

Emory was tried by good and competent jury and sentenced by a just judge to.sufier the penalty of death for com mitting two crimes, each of which is punishable by death. The supreme court affirmed the finding of the cir cult court, thereby admitting the guilt of the accused, but in the face of this decision joined in a recomen. dation to the Governor for com mutation of sentence to twenty one years Imprisonment. This recon mendatlon and other considerations secured for the condemed man the clemency asked for. The friends and relatives of the murdered and outraged woman in Franklin county, feeling convinced of the guilt of the man, determined .o avenge the wom ans wrongs by inhicting the penal ty of death. No one will deny that the incentive to the act was very great. There is no evidence that a citizen of Pope county participated in the lynching. The man was con fined in our jail, because he had been tried Tn our court on change of venue from Franklin county. Nc stan can possibly rest on this coun- ty. It is unfair, unreasonable and base calumpy to charge so."

Dirt.


The Lynch investigating COM
mittee met IN the City Council Cham
ber, last evening, and held public
session, but Notwithstanding the
notoriety given this affair by the
newspapers, not more than twenty
persons assembled to hear the evl-
dence George W. Humphrey was
elected Clerk to the committee to
take stenographic report Of the
evidence.


Patrick Gardner was called, and
without hesitation or demur took the
oath, which was administered to him
by Esquire O'Neill. Then Patrick
gave his testimony, which, in sub.
stance, was as follows:


That Lynch, had told him to sell the
street dirt at Fifty cents a load, and
divide the money equally. He sold
ten loads to John Dunn, proprietor
of the swan Hotel. Some time after
wards Lynch asked HIM if he had
collected the money from Dunn, and
he said not, but went then and got
the amount due, SIS. He handed this
money to Lynch who CAV him back
two dollars afterwards sold one
load to man on Ninth street be-
tween Washington and Jefferson,
and gave the money to Lynch, sold
six loads to Col. Ii. S. McComb, for
So, and gave 50 to Lynch. Also
sold six loads to man on Eleventh
street, near Market. Mr.. Stewart,
living on French street, bought eight
loads, but insisted on paying but
twenty five cents load, or 50. He
gave Lynch the So and Lynch gave
him quarter.


The witness further stated that he
sold more loads of dirt than he emu
merated, but he did not remember the
names Of the parties. He never sold o
load of dirt to any one without
Lynch's orders. The dirt bought b y
Dunn, he said, was delivered on
Lynch's written order, which Dunn
gave to him, but he did not know
what he afterwards did with the order.
Tho committee having finished with
0oiuu0iy uiis AyhSh 0uutoooou hih
and asked him If when charged by the
Morning Nesos with selling street dirt
he had not positively denied it and
expressed a willingness to swear to the
| denial.


sNo,"" said Gardner, s.outly. Gard
ner then addressed the COMMITTEES
again and said that Patrick Sullivan,
Of Third and jackson streets, bought
two loads of dirt and John Collins col
lected the money. Collins gave wit
ness the money at the same time say
ing, ''Be sure to give me half dol-
lar, or I'll raise hell"" Gardner said
he gave Collins half dollar and the
other half to Lynch. ""Didn't give
ye half dollar right on your own
pavement in front Of your own dooIp""
he said, turning around and facing
Lynch ""you can't deny it. defy
him to deny it. Concluding, Gardner
voluntarily informed the committee
that after heavy snow storm last
winter Lynch sent him, john Collins
and another man out to his house to
clean the snow from his pavement.


81 want to know"" said Gardner, ""ii
he has right to do this""


This closed the evidence and, after
directing the Clerk Of Council to sum.
mon as witnesses the parties to whom
Gardner says he sold the dirt, thu
committee adjourned until 7.30 o'clocl
this evening."

 WASHINGTON, Oct. 27.-Considerable com

 ment was caused to-day by the fact that two New York names were sent in for Cabinet l places This is explained in that that oi Postmaster General James was simply to cover legal point with reference to the ex- piration of his term within certain time

 after the death of President Garfield h the case of Secretary Stanton 8 similar point | was raised by Republicans on the ground I that he could serve thirty days after the ex- 1 piration of his term of four years. Since | then the law has been repealed except that section of the revised statutes referring to Postmaster Generals. Judge Folger was

 in town to-day. He personally accepted the Secretaryship of the Treasury, but will not qualify until next week. Meanwhile he has ! returned to New York to settle up some busi- | ness, and Judge French is still acting Secre- tary Howe's name is not now expectad to ! be sent in for Attorney General this session. The President has sent in all General Gar fields nominations and is said to have waited for Senate committee this evening to in form them that he had no further business for them. In that case Solicitor General Phillips will probably act as Attorney General until December if MacVeagh must retire. It is also said Howe is not anxious for the place until the Star route matters are fixed It is deemed not unlikely that Windom may get unanimous consent to qualify to- morrow so he may be made useful on com mittees that will sit during the recess. Win dom does not ask this personally.

 During the short time the Senate was in session the passage of certain resolutions regulating the pay of pages and employees gave an indication that the Senators were hoping for final adjournment to-day, and when, after being in session long enough to refer nominations just sent in a recess of an hour was taken to enable the committees to examine cases so referred, the impression was general that the Senate would close it's labors before adjournment. After the recess the prominent nominations were confirmed promptly and without dissent. contest then sprang up on the nomination of Stratham to be postmaster at Lynchburg, Va, the Democrats fighting for Wilson, the present incumbent who was obnoxious to the Republicans on account of having sold out the Republican party in the last election. Finally at o'clock so many pairs had been made that the Senate being without a quor- um was compelled to adjourn, leaving the fight open until tomorrow. Both parties express determination to stick in the Lynch burg case and if they persist in this the ses- sion may be prolonged until after November 8, or an adjournment may be had without disposing of any of the pending the regular order on the calendar and will endeavor to force the confirmation of Strat- ham, who has votes enough if they can be reached. Malone is quite indignant to night at the action of the Republicans who paired and thus left the Senate without 8 quorum. protracted session tomorrow is probable.

 Ex-Governor Jewell of Connecticut, chair man of the National Republican committee, left this city tonight after consulting with Senator Malone regarding the approaching election in Virginia. He endorses the Read juster movement in the State and promises to secure the $35,O or $4O,OOO necessary to pay the poll tax of destitute colored voters. It is said that besides this Jewell has consent ed to efforts to induce Congressman Dez- endorf to follow in Jorgensen's steps and SUD- port the Readjuster ticket. Jewell and Dezendorf had long conference tonight at the Arlington, at which time the situation was fully discussed. After it was over Dez- endorf said: 'tSo far as Governor JewelIs mission relates to me it has been failure, but this is not my fault nor the fault of my friends. A proposition has been made to me to see if something could not be done to harmonize the Republican party in Virginia by the consolidation of the two Republican committees. There does not seem any disposition except to require the absolute surrender of those Republicans who feel that they do not desire the election of Daniels, and who think that the policy now pursued is the surest way to secure that re- suit. ''You will not therefore become 8 Re adjuster ?"" .'No, sir; my position is that of Republican who is not opposed opposed to the illiberal policy now being pursued in Virginia which will destroy the Republican party there, and in my judg- ment result in the election of Daniels and Democratic United States Senator, a result which I am end always have been opposed to and which I will not knowingly do anything to further"" s'Then you think Daniels will be elected?"" sI do because the course that has been pursued has driven away many Re- putlicans who might under other circum- stances and notwithstanding their prejudices have been drawn to the support of the Cam eron ticket""

 Reports made by manufacturers to the Di- rector of the Mint show that during the year ending June 30, 1881, they consumed about SIC, O,OOO, ,0O0 of gold, of which over $3, OOO,- 900 was United States coin and SC, ,OOO, 1000 fine bars The consumption reported by the"" or SllV6r WAS or the Valu0 or of which less than $1OO,OO0 was United States coin.

 Among the nominations sent to the Senate to-day were 8 number of army promotion and postmasters, also Hiram J. Ramsdell, of the District of Columbia, register of wills for the District The Senate in executive ses- sion confirmed the following nominations Charles J. Folger, of New York, Secretary of the Treasury Thomas l.. James, of New York, Postmaster General, vice Thomas l.. James resigned; Frank Hatton, of Iowa, first assistant postmaster general, vice Tyner resigned; Max Frost, register of the land of fee at Santa Fe; Frank M. Eastman, Dis trict of Columbia, United States attorney for Montana Charles W. Seaton, superinten- dent of the census.

 To-days sessions of the Woman's National Christian Temperance Union were devoted to hearing and discussing reports. Among the matters submitted was letter from Governor St. John setting forth the progress of the prohibition movement in Kansas, the conse- quent happy and prosperous condition of the State and expressing the opinion that if the question of returning to the old license sys- tenn was put to 8 vote it would be defeated by 75, ,00O majority, and if women could vote it would be buried beyond all possibility of resurrection The executive committee has appointeda committee to wait upon Senator Blair, of New Hampshire, and invite him to tell the convention his object in offering prohibition amendment to the Constitution of the United States, and particularly ''why he excepted malt liquors from his amend ment, and did not go the whole figure""

 Postmaster General James gave a dinner at the Arlington tonight to the following distinguished guests: Presi- dent Arthur, Vice President Davis, Secretary of State and Mrs Blaine, Secretary and Mrs. Lincoln, Secretary and Mrs. Hunt, Secretary and Mrs. Kirkwood, Senator James and Mrs. H. G. Pearson Slaughter of Mir. James, wife of the postmaster of New York; Mrs. Jones was also present. The dinner was an elabo- rate affair and the floral decorations were ex- ceedingly fine.

arrested to-day and brought to this city on the
charge of receiving deposits after they knew
the banks to be insovent and must close. Over

prevails among the losers.

The Caldwell men have taken Danford and
Smith from the officers by force and are hold

At Hunnewel the cashier, Mr.. Bowers set

real estate, etc., and paid up within $4,000 OF

but the depositors refuse to SETTLE A heavy
guard watches Smith and Danford day and

feeling is greatly aggrava' ed by the fact that

LYNCHBURG, Va, Nov. 4.-Lynchburg like all

to divided counses and inefficient canvassing on
the part of the Liberals. 1t is the home of Major

The attention of party managers during this cam

About $50 o'clock Saturday evening three
discharges of revolver following each other
in rapid succession were heard in the county
Jail. Then the people on the street began to
cry, ""Police police y and run toward the
Jail building, at the corner Of Center and Mar
ket streets. Immediately rumor prevailed that
the prisoners had obtained pistols, had killed the
Sheriff and Jailer, and were making their es-
cape. The fact was, prisoner named Charles
Pierce, horse thief, had murdered Teddy
Franks, the County Jailer. Franks while
changing the prisoner, Pierce alias Hewlett,
from one cell to another, was murdered III cold
blood by Pierce, who seized the jaier's revol-
Yer from Franks hip pocket shooting him
three times and killing him instantly. The
third shot, large ball, went clear through the
body.


Within a few moments after this tragedy
had occurred. large number of people had
gathered in front Of the north door of the
Jail, within which the body OF Teddy Franks
was lying stark in death. Walking among the
people, you could hear msn say: ""This is too
bad This comes from the failure of our
courts to punish crime. He ought to be hung""


Don't stir up mob ~ law-and-order man
would say. ""Let the law take its course""


''The law be cursed"" was the reply.
'There Is no law against murder and other
crime IN Mclean county. He ought to be
hanged""


Then some one cried ''Let us take him
out !""


Cheers followed this. and other voices cried
81 Take him out ~


After an hours excitement, a rush was made
and the work OF breaking into the jail was
commenced


For Two hours the mob worked at the Jail
with six sledge hammers and battering rams
made OF great pieces of timber.


Sheriff Alor and his deputies and the city po-
lice soon ascertained that they could do nothing
to restrain the reckless men and boys who COM
posed the assaulting crowd. Fully 5000 per-
sons were in the bowling, yelling multitude. At
last the mob gained admittance To the jail,
secured the murderer of Franks, took him TO
tree on Market street, near the northeast
corner of Center and Market, put a rope
around his neck. threw one end across branch
! and pulled the culprit up. One of the mob
climbed up the tree and out upon the branch
to which the murderer was hanging, and, amid
the cheers of the delighted people, pulled the
hanging body up three OF four feet and let it
drop


Pull him up higher :"" the crowd would
ery The man on the branch would comply
with the request and let the body drop with
a dull thud, while the savage crowd would
cheer and laugh. The knot had slipped behind
the head OF the corpse, and the head was
| thrown forward. The eyes stared and the pale
face turned from side to side, q spectacle which
the maddened crowd seemed to enjoy. It
cheercd and yelled and shouted ''Theres law
for you !"" ''Curse the courts ~ was cried
! here and there.


! At last the man on the branch caught the
rope, slipped down it., threw his legs around
! the neck OF TIE corpse and jumped TO the

this feat. 1t cheered and yelled and shouted.
! About that time rain began to fall, though the
! great crowd fingered about, wading III the mud
and. by streaming gasliSht, viewing the dan

When the murderer was raised the first time.
Officer Bailey, OF the police force, imperiled
his life by running in, cutting the rope and let

to repeat il he came near being killed. A large
number of people climbed on top OF a shed to

crashing 10 the GROUND. Strangely, none were
seriously hurt. After thirty minutes the mur-
derer was cut down and the Coroner took

The ynchers had keg of gunpowder ready
with which TO blow up the jail # they failed to

All day Yesterday Sunday the wrecked jail
and the building in which lay the remains OF
| the lynched man were he center Of attraction.
! Thousands visited the jail, looked at the
| wrecked doors. windows and brlckwork, at the
/ terrible blood stains on the floor and on the
countcrpane on which Franks died, and which
| was saturated with the bright and vivid
crimson of arterlal blood. The remains OF
Pierce lay IN box of ice at the undertakers,
and constant stream passed in at the front
door and out at the back. The fatal rope was
around his neck The face was livid with coag-
ulated blood, which extended down to the CEN
] ter of the chest, yet the face wore a peaceful
expression. Many ladies tainted at the sight.
At least 5000 persons viewed the remains.
A card was tackled ON the elm tree, on
which the following was written

first justice, murder, ever was done in Mclean

While all deprecate the method by which

regret whatever that the murderer met his
death."

William G. Pownall and Miss Lizzie
Wells, both of them deaf mutes, were
married in the church OF st. Peter and
st. Paul on Second street, Brooklyn. at
7 O'Clock last evening. The groom is a
member of the firm of Harvey & Pow
nall, art stained glass works, 469 Hudson
avenue, Brooklyn. He is well-to-do, a
man of education, and not more than
% years old. Soon after his arrival in
this country from London year or two
ago he became a teacher of class OF
deaf mutes in st. Francis Xavier's Sum
day school In this city. One of his
pupils was Miss Wells, with whom he
thus became first acquainted. She was
able to hear and speak until she
was five years old. She then had fall
that destroyed her hearing, and upon
Her parents subsequently sent her to be
educated in the Buffalo deaf aud dumb
institution. Last May she removed from
this city to Brooklyn and became a
member of Father Malone's church of
st. Peter and st. Paul


About $50 ladies and a sprinkling Of
gentlemen had gathered in the church
yesterday when a carriage drove up con-
tanning the bridal couple, Miss Agnes
Lynch, the bridesmaid, and Mr.. Thomas
i. Grady, the groom's best man. The
last two are not deaf mutes. They
walked before the bride and groom up
the aisle to the music of the Wedding
March.


In front of the chancel the leading
couple divided and the bride and groom
took places between them. The bride
was dressed in a travelling costume of
ccru silk trimmed with amber. Ecru
feathers swept over her hat, which was
also trimmed with silk and satin of the
same color. She wore diamonds. She
has fair complexion and dark brown
hair.


The Rev. NJ. p. Costin, S. j., of st.
Johns college, Fordham, assisted by the
Rev. Father Gallagher, of the church OF
st. Peter and st. Paul, performed the
ceremony. He has taken much interest
in deaf .nutes and has incidentally ac-
quired knowledge of the sign language.
Not word was spoken during the cere-
mony until Father Costin said the Latin
prayers in closing. 1t is supposed to be
the first wedding of deaf mutes solem-
nized in the sign language by a clerg.
gyman in the diocese.


When Father Costin spelled out with
his fingers the words, ""Wilt thou take
Lizzie Wells, here present, for your
lawful wife according to the rite of our
holy mother, the Church,"" Mr.. Pownall
shut the first three fingers Of his right
hand and extended it before him with
the thumb and little finger held out
straight. The position of his thumb
and fingers represented the letter Y but
the motion of the hand increased the
significance to YES"" which in his case
took the place of the ritual words, 81
will"" Then the same question was put
to the bride. who gracefully replied ia
the same way, and at the same time
bowed her head in assent.


Next, Father CostiR began to signify
the words:


81, William S. Pownal, take thee
Lizzie Wells, for my lawful wife, to have
and to hold from this day forward, for
better, for worse, for richer, for poorer,
in sickness and in health, till death do
us part""


He expected that the groom would re-
peat them after him clause by clause,
but the groom, who evidently knew the
passage by heart and who is very dex-
ferrous In the use of the sign language,
took the words out of Father CostIn's
mouth, if the expression may be allowed,
and completed the declaration. The
priest soon stopped making signs with
his fingers, and contented himself with
bowing assent to show that he under
stood the words spelled out to be accord-
ing to the ritual. When it came to the
brides turn to make the corresponding
declaration, she also ratified it off ahead
of the priest with similar fluency.


Father Costin said in silence:


81 unite you in matrimony in the
name of the Father, Son and Holy
Ghost""


The ring having been blessed and
sprinkled with holy water from an urn
the groom received it and, holding it in
his left hand, said with his right:


with this ring | thee wed, and |
plight unto thee my troth.""


Then with his right hand he put the
ring on the brides finger.


After the ceremony the bridal party
was driven to the brides home, log
South Second street. Last evening the
bride and groom, accompanied by the
brides sister, started on tour to Sara
toga.


Among the many handsome presents
displayed at the brides residence were
large and very valuable diamond cross
and a gold-lined solid silver service o
twelve pieces."

canoe and his vote noexcephonal value, he would
doubtless have been len to carry on his local con-
test without material aid from without


Which is equivalent to accusing every
Republican Senator of low intrigue un-
derthe guise fprinciple. Again we oquote;


With the help of his vote the Republicans were
able to constitute the committees of the Senate,
and had the hope of carrying measures of impor-
tance which without It would be certain of defeat.


And so the Times would have us believe
that because General Mahone's vote
could give the committees of the Senate
to the Republicans the latter consented
to deliver their party over to him in
Virginia, when under other circum-
stances abe would have been left to
carry on his own local contest"" without
Republican support, and therefore against
its opposition.


The Times says:


An alliance with the Republicans would be
especially valuable to him, inasmuch as they had
control of the national Administration That he
sought the alliance and was willing to contribute
TO II his vote In the Senate Is not TO be wondered
at, for General Malone is n calculating politician,
and owed his scat in the Senate to vigorous con-
test with the regular Democracy in Virginia.


This is mere rehash of the speeches
of Brown, Hill of Georgia, Morgan, Call,
Voorhees,, and others made at the spring
session of the Senate. 1t charges the
""bargain and corruption upon Republi-
can Senators which they so Indignantly
denied. If""an alliance with the the Re-
publicans would be especially valuable to
him"" (Mahone), as above stated, the al
lance was none the less valuable to the
Republicans, as also above stated. If he
(AIahone) sought the alliance and was
willing to contribute his vote"" it is plain
that the Times intends to be understood
that the Republican Senators also sought
the alliance"" and contributed their in
fluence with the Administration. If his
course in the Senate ""is not to be Won
dered at, for General Malone is calcu-
lating politician"" then the course of the
Republican Senators is also to be ac-
counted for on the ground that they, too,
are calculating politicians.


To all of which the true reply so often
made is this: There was no alliance on
the basis Of any previous understanding.
General Malone triumphed over the
Bourbons in Virginia, and was chosen to
the Senate. He opposed them in that
body rs he had done at home. The Re-
publicans were also opposed to the Bour-
bons. The defeat of the latter being the
work in hand, the Republicans and GEN
eral Malone acted together for that pur-
pose. The defeat of the Bourbons in
Virginia being also desirable, the same
forces continued 10 work together to that
end. The Republicans did not buy Ma
hone, nor did he buy the Republicans.
Whoever says there was any condition
precedent to their cooperation is SLAM
derer and the truth is not in him.


The Times then discusses the debt ques-
ton, and concludes that the creditors
have more to expect from the Readjusters
than from the Bourbons. 1t fails to say
distinctly that it prefers the success of
the coalition ticket but leaves such a
preference to be inferred.


1t then proceeds to foul its own nest in
the following characteristic manner:
| In the methods by which aid is given to Malone
| and his supporters In Virginia there is nothing
new or unfamiliar, but there is much that is open
| to criticism. The public service of the United
States and the patronage of the Government ought
not TO be used as q power for carrying elections
in any State, and 1t would not be SO used II that
service were conducted according to sound sys-
TEN as to appointments and removals. The Lynch
burg postmaster was undoubtedly removed for
good cause Tho removal having been made under
our present system, the appointment of his success
sor was sure to have n political significance and
| influence one way or the otlier, and the Admins
| tration having given its sympathy to Malone, II
| was natural that such favor as this appointment
might indicate should be bestowed on his side In
| the contest. There ought to be no connection be-
| tween the Federal appointment and the State con-
test but in the present condition of politics II
was inevitable, and there is no doubt that the sup
port Of the Administration counts for much in the
| Virginia contest.


This is the reductiO dd abSurdum of the
civil-service machine reform crankery
A postmaster had to be removed for inn
proper practices, His place had to be
filled. Every person eligible for the
place was on one side or the other of the
State contest. One side must have
seemed to the President right and the
other wrong. He selected citizen who, as
q voter, was on the right side. This is
not so very vicious. Statham is as good a
postmaster rs any Bourbon would be.
If Bourbon had been appointed that
would have been using the ""patron-
age"" on that side. How can the Times
abolish ""sides"" or make the people re-
frain from taking sides? How can good
and competent men on the right side ol
party divisions injure the public service
by being designated for office? How
tedious is such ridiculous and meaning.
less cant. The Times thus concludes:


Moreover, the contributions for the expenses o
the canvass, which are made heavy by the capita
ton tax, are probably not induced wholly by de-
sire to promote the cause of equal rights, aud 1t 1:
to be feared that they are raised in some measure
by process closely resembling political assess
ment. All of which merely affords new illus
tration of the workings the fundamental vice OF
our political system, which are exhibited ON Il
much smaller scale and excite far more attention
and reprobation than in former times, This fact
at least is symptom of progress in public scntl-
ment


Aminidab Sleek could not shuttle anG
whine in more approved form. How dc
contributions resemble assessments? Does
the Times man ever attend church /?
so, does he ever put quarter in the ""con
tributon"" plate? Is he, therefore, as
sessed?"" Is it immoral to pass the plate

road extortion, showing how he arrived at
the marvellous results commented upon in
INV former communication, he made an addi-
tion of sos, OO0 900 to his former estimates
for the item Of robbery committed on local
freight. which had been omitted in the report
of his speech before the Anti-Monopoly
League on February 2lst-thus really esti-
mating the total robbery at $500. .0O0,O 600
during the year. The robbery of course
would be somewhat less in years in which
business was not SO heavy as in $780,"" After
a satirical allusion TO Blacks confession of
the inaccuracy of the figures which he
Black gave in his letter, he says: . pro-
pose to show conclusigely that railroad mo-
nopolies have not only been more moderate
in their exactions than he had supposed, but
that they have committed no robberies at all.
Yes, more; that they even have not been
repaid for services which they have rem

again to use the statistics for 1879, as those
for 1880 are not yet published, and call
special attention to this fact so that another
case of ""suppressio veri may not be made
out against me- Those who have latest in
formation can readily make the correction.
OF the 2. 424, ,000, 600 bushels of grain raised
in the United States, 79, ,271, 600 found their
way to the Atlantic ports. OF these, GO, ,OO0,-
900 were carried by canal, the remainder by
rail. About 80 per cent. of the grain which
arrived at the seaboard was exported in 1879:
An increase of five cents on this portion of
grain amounts to $1,000, 600, and the total
earnings from the exported grain carried by
railways east of Chicago to about Sll,-
900, 600. Surely these amounts cannot be
looked upon as tax by the people of the
United States. It is the sum collected
by the people from the consumers of
American grain in foreiyn countries,
the railroads acting only as collectors.
Of the amounts collected, 60 per cent. is paid
for the working expenses OF the roads-to
their operatives; to the wood-chopper VINO

ing on the track; 20 mechanics, engineers and

facturers, who furnish material to the rail-
road and laborers; TO manufacturers en-
ploves: to miners of coal, and to butchers.
tailors and merchants who supply food and
clothing to all these people. All get share
of the Der cent of the money collected from
the foreign consumer for transportation serv-
ices rendered him by the railroads OF this
country. There is go much wealth added to

choice, AZ. Cameron 80. Keyes ""a, Dixon l6,
Williams 4, Hazelton 3, Price 6. Scott l,

Williams 81, Hszelton z, Bingham l. By a
vote Of 81 to Al the caucus adjourned till
evening, the Cameron men opposing an ad-

PeriIs of the Sea.


NEW York, March 9Th The Tribune
saws: Incoming vessels report exceptionally
severe weather. Pietro Sala, the sole su, :
vivor Of the bark Adjuee, was subjected yes
terday morning at the Italian Consulate to a
prolonged examination as to the details Of
The di ,aster. His statements were taken
down Ia writing, Co which he affixed mis-
signature. The proceedings were conducted
with the greatest privacy, but Tribune re-
porter learned that many of Sala's answers
were not in harmony with the account he first
gave. The italian bark Guiesseppe Capuro,
from this port for Bordeaux. with cargo of
265, 107 bushels of wheat in bulk, October
10th, has not been heard from since, and it is
feared she is lost. She was commanded by
Captain Ansaldo, and had crew of fourteen
men. The italian bark Ire is missing. She
sailed from this port for Trieste with cargo
of oil September 21ss, commanded by Cap
tain Iongobardo, with crew of fifteen men.
She was formerly the American brig Mary
Goodell.


Horrible Murdcr-Trespass Trial.


ST. LOUIS, March 7th.-The Republicans
Little Rock special says: A horrible murder
is reported from Jonesboro, Craighead county
Ben. Ishmsel went to mill few miles from
his home, leaving his daughter Matte, aged
II. in charge of the house. On his return he
found his daughter dead on the floor in a
great pool of blood, her body being most
horribly gashed and bruised with an ak or
club. The object of the murderers was rob-
berry. as Ishmael is wealthy. The house was
rausacked, but no money obtained. A num-
ber of negroes have been arrested, and it is
thought that judge Lynch may take hand
in the matter.


The trial of Payne, for unlawfully invading
Indian Territory. has began at Fort Smith,
Ark, before the United States Court. Able
counsel appear on both sides.

NOTES.


Mrs. Caroline NJ. Franklin, wife of Com
modore Samuel E. Franklin, U. s. N,
died, aged 80, on last Saturday afternoon,
at the Park Avenue Hotel, New York city,
where she had been under medical treat
ment many weeks for Bright's disease.
Her devoted and deeply -bereaved husband
met and married her twelve years ago IN
San Francisco, where she was residing
with her father, General Erasmus d.
Keyes, U. S. A., retired. General Keyes
is still resident of California, where he
has large business interests. He visited
this daughter and son.in.law in April last
at their pleasant home, newly built and
furnished, in northwest Washington, near
the British Legation. Mrs. Franklin
was q devout Catholic lady, of sweet
ness and force of character. She
leaves no children. She was a
second wife of Commodore Franklin, who
is brother of General VIM. B. Franklin,
prominent in the war, but who resigned
his commission to engage in the Colt rifle
manufacturing interest at Hartford, Conn.
The two brothers look much alike. Gen.
eral Franklin was last year prominent in
the Hancock campaign, and is an intimate
personal friend of that gentleman. Com
modore Franklin was in command of the
Franklin, the flag. ship of our Mediterra-
mean squadron, that brought home Boss
Tweed from his escapade to Europe. He
is popular man here, and in his loss has
the sympathy of large circle of friends IN
civil, military and naval life.


GUITEAU,


The assassin, displays the frivolity of his
character even in the supreme crisis of his
fate. His case scarcely excites interest,
from the utter insufficiency of his death to
atone for the death he caused. His last
effort to raise money for his defense is a
demand on photographer Bell, who took
his picture in prison. He writes: You
know you have been supplying the country
with them, and it is right that you should
pay me reasonable royalty. What will
you give to settle without trouble or ex-
pense ?"" Mr.. Bell at latest accounts had
not been intimidated into hquidating with
him. Should there be such an impossible
event as Guiteau's escape from conviction
by jury, he would be quietly but promptly
lynched. A band of colored men threaten
to take it in hand should there be any flaw
in the white mans justice. My colored
maid, an old Washingtonian servant, who
has all summer taken the national burden
very much to her individual heart, says
""Dey'd better glib him ober to we culled
wimmen. We'd take care of dat brudder.
We wouldn't leave enough of him to hang.

seeand comprehend the magnitude of the
blunder he has made in separating him
self from the great mass of his party in a
crisis like the present. The result of
the Lynchburg convention showed that
the great majority of the Repub-
licans Of Virginia are opposed to
the Straightouts' policy. The true,
honest, practical Republicans of the
Old Dominion see plainly, as they think,
that they now have chance to secure
forever for themselves and their children
the free, unrestricted right of suffrage; of
voting as they please, and of having their
votes honestly counted. So seeing and
so feeling, they have thrown aside all other
considerations, personal or political, and
have determined to unite with any and
every man who will aid them in securing
these inestimable rights. And 80 firmly
have they resolved upon this that neither
power, person, norposition can deter them
or cause them to swerve from their reso-
luton. Such being the case, it is useless
for General Wickham or General Anybody
Else to attempt to turn them aside from
their PURPOSE"

brutal murder of Mr.. and Mrs. Gogle.
whose refusal to permit him to become
the husband of their young daughter
daughter had provoked his rage, was in
part the result of fear that he might
escape Justice if granted trial in court.
This fear was caused by the escape from
the gallows Of Allen c. Laros, whose
plea was insanity. This fact emphasizes
the declaration that the relation of insau-
ity to crime needs more exact definition

execution of maniacs while denying mur-

plea OF insanity is 4 problem which the
operation of Our courts does not solve.
1t is lamentable that such a State as
Pennsylvania should be the scene of an
execution under lynch law. the first in
stance of which is said to be the hanging
ot Snyder. bnt the neig ghbors of the mur-
dered man and woman were unwilling to

 From the London Spectatorl",,"| There is, so far as we can see, no possible method of preventing repetition of such crime short of locking up the sovereign in a well guarded prison. The bowling has per manently beaten the batting. Modern science has applied itself to the work of destruction, and there is no longer any possibility of pro- tecting life for which resolute enemy is | willing to give his own: The of the knife can be prevented, for it presupposes contact; and what with guards, rapid driving, and in cessant watchfulness, contact between a sov- ereign and an enemy can be rendered nearly, if not quite. impossible. The sovereign can be armed, too and can make as good fight for his life against the dagger as any other soldier. Even the use of the rife can be pre- vented, partly by armor, partly by mailed carriages, and partly by the constant interpo- sition of attendants between the sovereign and any point from which he could be threat ened. It used to be said of Napoleon, he drove up the Champs Elysees, that it was inn possible to ''cover'' him with stick, and that was very nearly though not literally true. No man along the. line could have drawn a pistol without some Corsican seeing him. The movements of guards distract the marks man, who, though he does not care whether he kills the innocent or not, does exceedingly care not to miss his aim.

 But neither these precautions nor any other are of avail against one or two men throwing in succession bombs powerful enough to blow

 

 always points at which cavalcade really en- ters pass, or approaches some foreseen angle, and assassins stationed at the side have only, as it were, to pitch cricket ball tolerably straight to change the succession to a throne. If the murderer knows how to measure dis tance, the speed of the carriage is useless, the iron plales give way, the guard are destroy ed like him they guards, and the sovereign is slain as he would be slain if shell reached him in the midst of armies. Of course, if by any chance he leaves the carriage, the chances are increased by his immobility. The only conditions required that the assassins shall be careless of escape, that they shall have bombs, and that they shall just have nerve enough at the moment to pitch straight; and none of these conditions can be absolute ly prevented. True courage is hardly re- quired, only kind of resignation, very con- mon in some races, especially among women. Few of the assassins of recent days have car ed to escape. Hodel made no effort, nor did Solovieff, nor, till her acquittal, Vera Sassu- itsch, nor is there yny method of shaking their nerve. They risk always one of the most horrible of fates-lynching by an excit- ed mob, which breaks their bones. Horrible punishments, even if modern feeling would allow them, would not do it, for you could not go beyond breaking on the wheel or burning alive, both of which have been tried, the one in France, the other in the southern States of America, and both have failed. The

 

 commit suicide, and on man raised or lower ed to the suicide temper, threats of infict- ing torture have no effect. He will only kill himself, and so bafhe inquiry into his motives and resources. Nor is 1t possible to contine the use of explosives to known persons. Laws to that effect only drive the criminals to learn chemistry for themselves-that is, in- vest them with new power of keeping their own secrets. Any student of chemistry can make gun cotton or nitro -glycerine and pow der is an article which must be manufactur- ed, and if manufactured can be stolen. Granted a few resolute conspirators, with one man of education among them and some little command of money, and no conceivable laws or rules of police or detective arrange ments can prevsnt their making and carrying and throwing bombs, which are as dangerous to the victims as hostile batteries only fifty yards off. Science has armed the assassin. and governments, with all their endless re- sources in men and material, are almost as powerless as if their opponents could wield the lightning or direct the course of earth
