 Two rebel gun boats captured, three were sunk. The people of Norfolk and Portsmouth are panic-stricken.

 | CAIRO, Feb. II. A detachment of cavalry, 25o strong, had an engagement with the rebels Sunday, ' miles east of Fort Henry on tine road to Fort Donaldson. Five rebels were killed, and 30 prisoners were taken, with 30 horses. One Federal was wound ed.

N. and caused great excitement. Rebel force on Island is supposed to have been about 5000 efi- cient fighting men. Gen Wise was N at Nagas Head. and was not present during the engage ment!! When the situation became dangerous he was removed to Norfolk.

 All rebel gunboats but one, taken. One es- capped up the creek. and probably also destroyed One report says only 70 and another that 25 con- federate troops escaped from Island. General Huger telegraphed to Richmond that only 50 on to be no bright side story for Rebels.

 Richmond Exansiner this morning in a lead ing editorial, says ""the loss of the entire army on Roanoke Island, is certainly the most pain full event of the war. Intelligence yesterday by Telegraph is fully confirmed. 2,500 brave troops on one Island in the Sea exposed to all the force of Burnside's Fleet. They resisted with most determined courage, but when l3O00 federal troops were landed against them, their retreat being cut of by the surrounding element, they were forced to surrender""

 The following dispatches on this subject were taken from the Richmond papers of this morn- ing Norfolk, Feb. llth, latest news states the. capture of Gen. Wises son. He vas shot through the hip. and disabled through his wound though not mortal. Major Lawson and Lieut..

 3d dispatch received at Richmond at midnight as follows: Courier arrived this F. M., at 4 o'clock, and brought intelligence that Elizabeth City was burned this morning by the inhabitants. During the confagration the federals landed all their forces.

The citizens finding re. distance in vain, evacuated the place, and set fire to the town. We have to record the capture by the enemy of all our fleet, except the Fanny or Forest, our informant is not certain which.

 All southern papers received to day. are unan- imous in admitting complete victory to our troops, and in saying that the loss of the island is very serious

 Prisoners numbering at least 1000 will be here (Ft. Monroe) in few days Steamer with official dispatches from Burnside is hourly ex. pccted.

After the capture of Fort Henry, the Lexington. Couisto. ga and Tyler gave chase to rebel gunboats, but did not overtake them. Gunboats went to Flor ence, Alabama, head of navigation, 25o miles from Paducah. Everywhere along the river they were received with astonishing welcome by mum. bers of Union families, in southern Tennessee and northern Alabama. Our old flag was hailed as Redeemer, and hailed with shouts of joy.- Capt. Guynne, of the Tybee, accepted 30 men for service on board the gunboat and he could get enough to man the whole feet.

 The people of Florence, Alba, were so delight ed at finding the Stars and Stripes once more their portion that they prepared to give the off, cers ball, but they could not remain.

 to report himself for duty at once. The court of inquiry ignored the charges against him as | soon as they were received. Recent develop | ments disclose embez1lements in the county 1 collectors office to the amount ot $50 ,000.- 1 These frauds have been committed by ;. D. l Axtall. chief clerk, and extended back through a series of years.

 MEMPHIS, Jan. lO.-Generals Pillow resg nation, 1t is reported, will not be accepted by President Davis. Rumors rife that he will soon receive q major>genarars commission. Gen eral Lee has prohibited all newspaper cores pondence from the camps on the southern coast. Northern papers mention the arrival at New York of l00OG stand of arms.

 MEMPHIS. Jan. 1l-A special dispatch to the Appeal, from Columbus the 10th, says northern papers of the 7th have been received there. dispatch from Halifax, dated the 9th inst, nOunces the arrival of the steamship Bohemian at that point with later advices from Europe, which say that cotton has advanced half penny-no provisions or breadstuffs are being exposed to market. Anson Burlingame, the Massachusetts abolition minister to China, had arrived at Canton. Great excitement prevailed at Lisbon, Spain, in consequence of the mys terious di5interment of the Kings body, the cause of which has not been explained.

 The Orleans Princes in America have been ordered home in consequence of foreign com plications with the t. S., which is quite signif cant France sends endorsements to the squad ron recently dispatched to Mexico by Span.- Great Britain demands indemnity from that government fer certain outstandng financial claims She also sends squadron of obser- vation to the American coast, probably to look after the blockade.

 The steamer Vanderbilt arrived at New York on the 9th inst, from Port Royal, carrying, as she alleged, $500 bags of cotton, which was unginned and probably impressed.

 Adgices from central Kentucky, state that the pontoon bridges recently built by Gen. Buell. over Green river, have been swept away by high water.

The barracks of the l7th Illinois re- giment were burned at Cairo on the 9th inst.- The pistols, sabres, arms and clothing of one entire company were entirely consumed in the conaagration. Twelve federal gunboats and B mortar boats have arrived at Cairo with large reinforcement .! troops. The crews of these boats have been assigned to service, and mus tered into the immense army, of which 1t is the evident purpose of making an early advance in some direction. Adyioes from taducah as late as the 9th inst. are received, and say that pilots have been impressed into service in the con- tempIatad movement of the federal fotiIa up the tennessee river. All quiet here. RICHMOND, Jan. 9.-The proceedings of Con- gress are unimportant 50 far as known. There vas heavy firing l2st. nigh. at Ac4aia Creek The Yankee vessels engaged our batteries-no- body hurt on our side. Nothing is showu of the damage to the tederals. The Green Briar raid is co needed to have been made by Yan- hee plunderlng party who took eff horsos, oat- tie and other property. The Yankees, 1t Is be HeVed, have escaped to Onl0.

 The Lynchburg Republican has intelligence from Winchester that there has been some little skirnishing with only few casualties. The coniederates have burnt the bridge over Capon river and destroyed dam No. 6, on the Chese> peake canal, and bridges on the Baltimore and Ohio railroad They then returned in the di- rection of Winchester, The confederates lost on this expedition about 10. On Monday about II miles below Romsey, the contederates in small force were attacked by 4000 Iankees.- We lost , or killed, few prisoners, two can- non and 3 baggage wagons. The enemy de stroyed the property of several southerners in that region. We captured in one of our expe- ditions, two cannon and three or four thousand dollars worth of clothing and military stores.- Among others, Capt. Alexander qf an Arkan- sas regiment in letter from Camp Alleghany, dated the 9th, says no attack has been made on that camp or at Monterey. The enemy, after the defeat at Huntersvllle, double quicked away. NORFOLK, Jan. ll.-Eacharie, of New or> leans has been..released by the Yankee govern ment, and has arrived.

There is an upward movement in gold-exchange ll5. The Herald says Wall street has coRspired to defeat the plans of the government, and that the treasury will be with out a cent in another week. The Philadelphia banks refuse treasusy notes, aud the public be- gin to cry, down with the banks! and calls are made for national currency. The steamer Canada reached Halifax on the 8th January, with more troops and artillery and nine hun dred tons of munitions. The Hibernia is 10 follow her up with more troops. The London Times stands aghast in contemplation of the tremendous and magnificent vegetation of the Yankee debt. Prussia has addressed her min ister at Washington, condemning the arrest of Mason and SlGell.

 NASHVILLE Dec. 24.-The Bowling Green correspondent of the Union and American oE inc 23d. says federal Gen. Buell., with formid- able force, estimated at notlesS than 45,0OO, and bv many at 60,000, has been for several days 

 Unusual preparations to repulse the enemy are making, showing that a terrible conflict IS i'm pending. A force of not less than 60,000 com posing the advance of Buell'g army, has crossed Green river, and now within five miles ot our advance under Hindman, who is at Cave City, It was reported afew days since that the enemy had retreated across Green riyer-the report was partially true, Hindman changed his pickets from the front of the enemy, who imagined flank movement was being made and fled in the great est disorder, leaving behind them their tents, wagons and baggage in the flight. Ii IS repor- ted that the federals retreated at double quick. The federals returned on the following day, the 20th, and are now within 90 miles of Bowling Green. The entire force recently at Louisville has been moved to Green river where there arc not less than 35,000.

 Every appearance indicates speedy open i1g of the winter campaign. A federal officer arrived at Bowling Green on the 2lst with a spy glass making observations of the different Notifications. He represented himself aS de- ser;er from the 10th N. '. regiment, and that he had made his Way from the Potomac. IL Is supposed that he belongs to Wllllch Indiana regiment, which was pat to flight few days since by the Texas RangerS-he will be sent to Richmond. A gentleman who left the Ohio

| Tm ENGLISH PRESS AND THE New YoRx He
RALD.-The mails received by the Bohemian and
the Kangaroo show marked abatement in the
English war fever. Perhaps one of the strong
est evidences of this is the disposition mani
tested by the London journals to lavish upon in
dividuals and journals on this side the abuse
which had before been SO literally bestowed on
US as nation. The New York HERALD Of
course, comes in for its share of the vituperation
thus freely indulged in. ""Despicable paper""
""viperous print"" and ""dirty tool"" are amongst
the mildest of the highly seasoned epithets ap-
piled to it. The leading journal Of America,
and the newspaper of the largest circulation in
| the world is described as on q par with the
/ publications that emanate from Holywell street.
Where are the good manners of the writer's that
formerly used to lecture the press Of This
country on the proprieties and amenities Of
journalism!


When the abolition of the newspaper stamp
duty was first broached, the isr was expressed
that il would have the effect ef degrading the
character and tone of the English press by In
Producing into it class of writer's of low asso-
Citations and habits. The result HAS amply justi-
fed the prediction. Judging by the language
held towards this country, its institutions and
statesmen, it is impossible not to arrive at the
conclusions that it is now managed by q set Of
pothouse journ alists and penny-a-liners without
the least of principle or self-respech Butwhat
is most amusing in the Billingsgate which has
been showered upon the New YORK HERALD and
it's proprietor i the funny inconsistency and
extravaganza of its averments. We are told on
the one hand that we have been the means Of
provoking all this ill feeling between the two
countries, and on the other that our influence
is ""infntessimal."" It is through us, neverthe-
less, that Northern men are induced ""to torture
their prisoners Of war, to threaten to murder
the wounded, to seek to block up the highways
of nature, to plot to foster new slave trade,
and to aim at lynching England into new code
of ofinternational law"" We did not know that
our influence went to,quite this extent; but the
future historian will no doubt accept the fact as
thus stated All that remains for us to ask of our
transatlantic contemporaries is, that they will
do us the similar justice when they find the sur
render of Mason and Slidell by our government
anticipated and advocated in our columns
week in advance of the fact.


TALK AND AcTIoN-After all the excitement
and defamation of the British people, the va
poring of their newspapers the special councils
of the Cabinet. the opinions of the law advisers
of the Crown, and British indignation generally,
in consequence of the seizure of the rebel en-
voys, the insigniicance of the action taken in
the matter contrasts amusingly with the loud
and hostile demonstrations which followed the
first announcement of the intelligence which
affected them to- such a wonderful pitch Of
fury. What is the actual result Of all
the indignation meetings and other express
sions of popular, legal and diplomatic
opinion, by which the world was led to believe
that war between England and the United
States was imminent? Simply that ten thou
sand men, or less, have been sent to British
North America. Now, supposing that circum-
stances had led to declaration of war, of what
use would such a force as that have been, either
in defending or invading? We could have
poured more than that number into Canada in
week. But, fortunately Great Britain will
have no particular need of them so far as the
United States are concerned, and therefore the
effect of the homeopathic instalments of troops
will be just as good as if she had sent the whole
army, including the two majestic guardsmen
who protect the portals of the Horse Guards in
Whitehall, and who are notoriously the admi-

there was small rebel force Of cavalry about
seven miles north Of fredericksburg. Also.
that there was force consisting Of about 6, 900
infanty and about 1000 cavalry, and come ar
artillery, at Warrenton. II is said that Gen.

The Norfolk correspondent Of the Richmond
Dispatch, dated Feb. TO- gives the following de-


tails Of the recent victory of the gallant Burnside
\ and Goldsborough at Roanoke Island:


| With inexpressible sorrow announce ths fall
of ROdnoks Island, after spirited and heroic
l sistance by our brave troops. This occurred be-
L tween IL and 2 O'Clock on Saturday, and the
1 news received here with every indication Of re-
i gret and indignation. We gather the following
| particulars from young man from the Rich


mond Blues, who participated in the fight, es-
capped In a small boat and rowed to Nag's Head,
| where he was taken up by one of our gunboats
| and brought to this city. He is an Intelligent
| lad, and believe a son of your postmaster The
/ enemy's ships, he says, opened Are our bate
ries at Roanoke Island, about 7 O'Clock In the
| morning, and kept up an incessant FIRE until
| O'Clock In the evening doing, however but
i little injury to the Island About O'Clock the
| next day (saturday) the Hessians were allowed
i to land on point TO the east Of Roanoke Island,
| where they marched upon that point


The booming Of heavy cannon in the distance
| heralded the enemy's eppToach. Our brave troops
| prepared to meet them. suppOsag their numbers
| TO be about i've thousand. Gradually the sounds
came nearer and nearer, and the shell came thick
i and last over cur intrenchments. Confident Of
Il their own strength, our troops moved rapidly
i forward, when, in a few mnntes, the ball opened
| and the teri. hc contest ensued. Bravely did
boys stand up TO the overwhelming forces Of the
Il enemy, ind not till every man was dead or
1 wounded did they leave their stand Nothing
Il remained but retreat, which our men did, con-
Il stan:ly turning and giving them a shot Finding
1 II useless to hold the island under such over
/ whelming numbers, the order to retreat from the
Il island was given, and our remaining troops re-
tired, leaving their strongholds in the hands Of
the enemy.

 PARsoN BRowNLow ON SECESSION

 Wecopy the following extracts of the speecl

 of Parson Brownlow, of Tennessee. made in In

 dianapolis, Ind on his way east. It gives ,

 frightful, but not overwrought picture of tn,

 barbarism of the Southern Confederacy:

 Gov. Morton introduced. Mir. Brownlow. wht

 spoke at length of the causeess character of thu

 rebellion, and it's disastrous effects, and was fire

 quently cordially cheered by his large audience

 He gave an account of his ancestry, and showed

 how they had all been engaged in the service o

 the country, and always true to its flag and prln

 ciples He said he had been called a traitor b,

 R. Barnwell Rhett, of South Carolina Rhett,

 said he, was named R. Barnwell Smith, but tn,

 Smiths being all tories during the Revelation, b,

 was allowed by legislative act to call himssl

 Rhett. He call me traitor,' said the iron ole

 Parson indignantly, when his illustrious ances tors were hunted by Marion through all the mos quite swamps of South Carolina lUproariou' cheers and laughter.) He commented ct con

 siderable lengthon the rebellion. and its lead CTS, and declared. with great emphasis, that 'i il | the issue was to be made between the Union

 without slavery, and slavery without the Union he was for the Unlon and let slavery perish.-

 Great applause.) Let every institution die first and the religion of Jesus Christi he was for the Union.' Tremendous cheers.)

 In May last the South began 10 pour stream as hot and ugly as Hell itself from the Gulf States through Eastern Tennessee, towards Richmond and Manassas, and Norfolk and Lynchburgh. in the shape of rebel soldisry armed with side knives and tomahawks, drink ing gallons untold of bad whiskey, and boosting largely and savagsly enough of the things they should do in Washington. Iaughter.) had an old banner, the stars and stripes, floating from the top of my house, on Main street, in Knox vile, Tenn, in conspicuous part of the city, They began to come to pay their respects to us frequently q regiment at time. Whole reg. inents of wharf rats, from New Orleans and Mobile, as ugly and disgusting as they were vii clous, would come at one, now and then, to give old Brownlow turn, as they expressed it,

 They would en masse come across the river on the bridge, surround my house, yell, throw stones, blackguard my wife and family, dare me to come out of doors, and TOW and then accep ted their invitations and made them the best bow could. l have, time and again, gone out aud given them very frankly and unreservedly my settled opinion of the whole concern, from Jeff Davis down, assuring them that my scorn and contempt for them and the Southern Con- federacy was unutterable, and then, making them the best bow could, would go back into the house and leave them to groan and yell around the house till they saw proper to quit. This course they have steadily kept up all the year. And yet all this. time was reading in the papers of Charleston and Savannah and Richmond that the Confederate army was composed of the flow CT and promise of the Southern States. l told my wife that if those miserable, God-forsaken whelps that were screaming like devils around our house almost half of every day were the flower of the Southern Confederacy, my prayer would be--God save us from the rabble.

 On the 9th day of November last, We had an election in the Southern States for President and Vice President of the Southern Confedera- cy, with only two candidates in the feld-Jef Dayis and little Alex. Stephens of Georga.- And when we, of Eastern Tennessee, came to vote at that election, we did not vote at all, but we positively and utterly refused to have any thing at all to do with it. The Sherifs, who were Union men, refused to open the polls. or to hold an election, thus giving the candidates tke cold shoulder, and manfestlng our contempt for the whole concern And gentlemen, you cannot fail to be surprised when announce to you the fact that the great State of Tennessee, casting net less than 10000 votes as her ordinary vote gave Jeff Davis and his colleague in villainy 8 miserable vote of 25,OO0. These two men are to day holding their offices by the vote of a mis- erably lean minority of the people of the State of Tennessee. Tennessee was driven out of the Union at the point of the bayonet. The miser- able rebel soldiery were stationed at the polls, wherever poll was opened, with orders to pre- appear from depositing his vote.

 We had thousands of good Union men, men of good .lporals, members of churches, Metho- dists, Baptists and others who had no desire to be involved in difficulty, who saw that nothing could be accomplished by attempting to exer- else their rights, and who said to themselves we will stay at home and let the thing go by de fault Let me tell you ladies and gentlemen, if 1 know anything at all of any State it is the State of Tennessee, and want you to mark well and treasure up in your minds the prediction l am about to make to you. l predict to night that when Governor Johnson shall appoint a day (which he will do before long) uponsWhich the people of the State of Tennessee shall decide at the polls whether they shall come back again beneath the stars and stripes, when Confederate bayonets shall be driven completely out of the State, which they will soon, the Volunteer State will come back into the Union by ma jority of 50O0O votes. (Cheers.)

 There is also at this very time, powerful Union sentiment in each of the other Southern States. These Southern traitors may talk to you about the unanimity of feeling in regard to the war, but let me assure you that it is all false There IS no unanimity in the Southern States. Louisiana never voted herself out of the Union. The wretches who were in power there snug gled the vote. The truth is that secession was lost in Louisiana Georgia barely went out of the Union. Alabama was forced out through the treason of Jerry Clemens and others. The old North State will gladly come back again. The old Dominion what shall say of her God bless her while he curses her leading politicians Virginia is about ready to come back. She is just about sick enough now to be willing to take medicine.

 But whilst it is true there is no unanimity in the Southern Confederacy in regard to the war, there was one remarkable instance of unanim ty that occurred in Tennessee just about tbe time that We people of the eastern portion of the State refused to vote. By strange freak of na- ture, or Providence, or something else, all the railroad bridges between Bristol and Chatta- nooga took fire all at once and burned down one night about eleven o'clock. l was not concern ed in the matter. and can't say who did it. l thought to myself that the affair had been most beautifully planned and executed, and enjoyed it considerably in my quiet way.

The rebels lost vast number of officers, including Generals, g Colonels, 10 Majors, and 57 Cap. tains, killed or taken prisoners.

 IKE WAR IN Nrw MEuco.-The Santa rs mail, with dates to the 2Sth ut., arrived st Kan. sas City on Saturday. The Texans had reached Mesilla with Eve pieces of artillery and seven wagons. It is said after stopping at Fort Fill more to recruit their exhausted energies, they will continue their homeward bound march. Gen. Sibley is reported to be at Fert Bliss, far in advance of his command, taking care of him. self ,

 Fort Craig advices to the 24th ult., state that early on the morning of the 23d, Capt. Tilford, whe was stationed with 35 or 40 men on the east of the Rio Grande, ! miles below Fort Craig, received summons to surrender from c band of two hundred Texans supposed to be struggling bands of guerrillas of Sblsy's com. mand. He refused to do so, and immediately gave battle and fought three hours, when he re- treated to Fort Craig with loss of three wound ed. Three of his men were drowned while cros- sing the river. The Texans loss is not known. Two companies of Colorado volunteers were immediately sent in pursuit ofthe Texans.

 Another triumph is recorded for the army of Gen. Mitchell. An expedition under Gen Neg ley has followed up considerable body of the enemy under Gen. Adams, and driven them to bay at Chattanooga where the rebels were ut terly defeated and routed, with the loss of their baggage wagons. ammunition and supplies. Still more important events are expected from Gen. Negley's expedition.

 The Boston Traveller of last week has the fol lowing statements:

 The following document was furnished to us Ihv Mr. Henry Martin, one of the returned priso- ners from Salisbury. N. O. As the prisoners, before starting, are thoroughly searched for con traband papers, Mr. Martin conceived the idea of hollowing a piece of wood, in which he placed the letter, and used it as cane, escaped de' tection.. The letter was written by Union oil- cers imprisoned at Salisbury, and is the sub. stance of information obtained from prominent Confederates and Union men. Of course the march of events has somewhat changed the as- spect of affairs since it was written:

 jaga SALISBURY, V. C., May. 26.

 ""One of the best engineers inthe Confederate army said to me not long ago McC Clellan came to the peninsula, and in one hours recennois' sance discovered the weak point of our Works-

 He set about turning that point, and came near taking our whole army. He saw at glance | what Magrudsr and Johnson had failed to see m year.

 men had entered the army from that place, be-

 cause they must do it or go to prison, and as our government refused to exchange their soldiers, they felt sure they would be left to rot in dun

 lion as this. A few leaders stirred up the people, ignorance and whiskey set the ball rolling, and the leaders could neither check nor control it, Moderate men were trampled down; candor was called disloyalty to the South; caution, treach- cry unanimity Q leaning to the North

There are said TO be several Union traitors in this place.

Within the past three months large number
Of slaves have been sent further South and sold
to new masters; and the scenes In the auction
marts have been often narrowing to witness
families being separated without the least re-
gard for humanity, or that kind 6f external de-
cency which the slaveowners frequently affect TO
observe.


A week or two since, large and rather in
telligent mulatto Was taken from his wife and
children and sold TO Texas planter at James's
mart. He, poor fellow, was greatly depressed,
and seemed for q time unconscious Of every
thing passing around him. At last he aroused
himself from his introspectiou, and asked IT he
had been sold, and to whomS The name of the
planter was given, and the location of his plan
tation. ~


An expression of agony, succeeded by cloud
of despair, passed over the mans face but with.
out speaking, he walked quietly into the middle
Of the street, and before any one could divine
his motive, or anticipate his intention, he drew
u pistol, which he had concealed upon his per-
son, and placing the muzzle to his forehead,
pulled the trigger.


The upper part of the muatto's head was
fairly blown off and he fell msngled corpse
in the midst of the crowded thoroughfare.
The bondsman was free. Suicide had saved
him from Slavery.


The crowd, ever curious, but rarely sympa-
thetic especially when negro is the sufferer or
| the victim, gathered for Q moment about the
body; but no one piticd, no one bestowed more
thought upon the heart-broken, selfslain hus.
band and father than II he had been butcher.

A few asked, ""Whlt the devil was the matter
with the niger ?"" Others observed: ''The id
nigger must have been crazy !"" and the Texas
planter swore roundly-saying. ""D-n the
cursed darkey. 1 could have sold him for two
thousand dollars. I'm just so much out Of pock-
ct. If he'd come to life again, I'd give him
forty lashes."" ,..


But the crowd went hurryng on, and the ne.

Home Appreciation of John d. Floyd.
Considerable amusement has been furnished
us on the fotilla by an old copy of the Rich
mond (Va.) Examiner, containing an editorial
on John b. Floyd, in which he is mentioned as
| ''the hero of thirty battles"" never knew q
Richmond paper to be Willingly guilty Of a
joke of any sort; but that appellation applied
to the notorious fugacious thief must certainly
have been intended asa jest. Floyd-who not
only never had any martial success, but ran
away from fight whenever he had an oppor-
! tunity--the 'hero of thirty battlesp' Is not
this exceedingly drolls


Speaking of Floyd reminds me Of what o
getlemen from Memphis, now on his way there,
told me of the unprincipled ex Secretary's rep
utation in the vicinity where he lived for a
number of years. My informant was travelling
to Lynchburg, Va, and discovered that Floyd
was on the cars. After arriving at the hotel,
he found that the distinguished son of the
South"" as the Rebel journals have dubbed
him, was also stopping there, and he noticed
during the day, that all the persons who called
on or conversed with him were of the most
| unprepossessing appearance, and disgustingly
| coarse and profane in speech. The gentlemen
| remarked to the proprietor Of the hotel, the
| singularity of Floyd associations, and wonder
ed that so important parsonage should not
| attract better class. aa-
'The reason is Sir"" replied the landlord
''that Floyd is known here. He lived in Lynch.
burg number of years, and a greater scound-
rel never escaped the penitentiary, where he
| ought to have been long ago. There are hum
| dreds Of men in the Richmond prison who are
| honest compared with Floyd. Everybody de-
| spises him in this city and county. He never
had transaction with any one, whom he did
| cheat or attempt to cheat.


| sHe is an infamous liar and william, and nev-
er was anything else. He could not obtain
credit for five dollars unless he would leave his
| watch as pledge; and if he did that, would
| believe the watch stolen. He has swindled hun
dreds of people in this town, and he will do
more injury to our cause-I am strong advo-
| cate of Southern Rights-than q dozen of our
| best men will do it good. COnfound him,
hope the Yankees will catch him and hang
| him; for he deserves it.""


On further inquiry, the Memphis merchant
| learned that the opinion the hotel-proprietor
| had expressed Of Floyd was general, and that
| he was as much despised as pickpocket or
| thimble-rigger. Floyd himself looked quite
| venerable, bat looked care worn and premature
| ly old, with stoop in his shoulders (as if he
had been trying to carry small portion of
| what he had stolen on his back) and very


unprepossessing manner. He was generally
! quiet in manner and reticent; corroborating the
| idea that great scoundrels are usually silent,
| for fear of exposing their principles or mis-
deeds.

the people, though deceived at fret By the press,
have, from interviews with the wounded soldiers
learned what was 60 carefully sought to be con-
cealed. There is no doubt that Shiloh has been @
terrible blow 10 the enemy, and one from which they
can hardly recover.


LIBERTY OR DEATH!


Within the past three months large number Of
slaves have been sent farther South and sold 70 new
masters; and the scenes in tie auction maE.s have
often been narrowing 10 witness-familes being sep-
arIted without the least regard for humanity or that
kind Of external decency which the slaveowpers fre.
quenily affect To observe.


week or two snce large and rather intelli.
gent muatto was taken from Lis wife and children
aud sold TO Texas planter at Jamess mart. He,
poor fellow, was greatly depressed, and seemed for
time unconscious of everything passing around him.
At last he odsed himself from his ntrospeciop, and
asked if he had been sold, and to whoml The name
of tir planter was given, and the location Of bis
plantation.


An expression Of agony, succeeded by cloud OF
despair, passed over the mans fice but without
speaking, Re walked quietly into the middle of the
street, and before any one could divine his motive,
or anticipate his intention, he drew pistol, which
he had concealed upon his person, and placing the
muz7le to his forehead, pulled the trigger


The upper part of the rnulattos head was fairly
blown off; and he fell mapged corpse in the midst
Of the crowded thoroughfare.


The bondsman was free. Suicide had saved him
from Slavery.


The crowd, ever curious but rarely sympathetic,
especially when negro is the sufferer or the vic
tim, gathered for moment about the body; but ro
one pitied no one bestowed more thought upon tue
heartbroken, sefslan husband and father than if he
had been butcbered OK


A few asked, ""What the devil was the matter
with the niggerl"" Others observed: ""The id
Niger must have been crazy"" and the Texas
planter swore roundly-saying, ""D--n the cursed
darkey. I could have sold him for two thousand
dollars. I m just so much ont Of pocket. If he d
come to life again, d give him forty lashes.""


But the crowd went burying on, and the negro,
and tie great tragedy, deeper and grander aud more
awful than ""Othello,"" were forgotten; and the be-
roic martyr was hauled away like poisoned dog.
| HOME APPRECIATION OF JOHN b. FLOYD.
Considerable amusement has been furnished us on
the fo,ills by an old copy of The Richmond (Va.)
Examiner, containing editorial on John Is. Floyd,
| in which he is mentioned as the hero Of thirty
battles"" | never knew a Richmond paper to be
Willingly guilty Of joke Of any sort; but that ap-
rellation applied to the notorious fugacious thiei
must certainly have been intended as jest. Floyd
who not op'y never had any martial succese, but
ran away from ight Whenever he bad an oppoItu-
uity-the ""hero OF thirty battlesw Is not that ex-
ceedngly droll'


Speaking Of Floyd reminds me Of what gentle.
man from Memphis now on his way there, told me
of the unprnciped ex-Secretary's reputation in the
vicinity where be bad lived for number OF years.
Ny informant was travelling to Lynchburg, Va, and
discovered that Floyd was on the cars. After arriv-
Ing al the hotel he found that the distinguished ana
devoted son of the South"" ms the Rebel journals
have dubbed him, was also stopping there, and he
noticed, during the day, that all the persons who
called ON or convened with him were of the mos,
unpr.posses.ng appearance and disgustingiy coarse
and rrofano in speech. The gentleman marked TO the
proprietor Of tie hotel the sipgu'arity OF Floyds
associations, aud wondered that important per-
sonace should not attract better class.


""The reason IL, Sir replied the landlord, that
Floyd is known here. He lived in Lynohburg a
number OF year, and greater scoundrel never es-
csped the peniieniary, where he ought to have been
long ago. There are hundreds OF men in the Rich
moud PRISON who are honest compared with Floyd.
Everybody despises him in THE city and county.
lie never had transaction with any one, whom he
did not cheat or attempt 20 cheat.


""He is an infamous liar ard villain, and never
war anything else He could not obtain credit for five
dollars unefs he would leave his watch as Il pledge

CAUSE OF TIE CHANGE OF PROGRAMME.


The change Of programme 10 which l have

Gen. Popes splendid army up the Tennessee. Ar.

CAMDEN, Sept. 27.-We have the following by",,"portion of our army has crossed the Potomac, but letters from Winchester to the Dispatch say our army crossed without losing man or any commis sary stores. Gen. Sumner and another Yankee General sent flag of truce after the battle, asking permission to bury their dead. Our loss is 500O, that of the enemy about 000. The Enquirer says Maj. Gen. Anderson was wounded; Gems. Wright, Lawlon. Ripley, Almsled, Ramsey and Cummings, slightly wounded Gems. Stalke and Bunch killed; Gen. Toombs slightly wounded

 MOBILE, Sept. 25.-A special to the Advertiser and Register, dated Charleston 22d, says that the whole of our army has not crossed from Virg mia, but that Lee with the bulk of his army is in hot pursuit of Mcclellan He came up with him on Friday and continued pursuing towards Frederick Yellow fever is raging at Wilmington, N. c. The mayor teegraphed to day that it is epidemic.

 RICHMOND, Sept. 24.-In the Senate--Oldham, of Texas, submitted series of resolutions, de- claring that provost marshas had no authority whatever over citizens not belonging to the army, which referred to the committee on the judi ciary.

The military exemption bill was discussed until adjournment.

 RICHMOND, Sept. 24.-Lynchburg dates of to-day say that the Yankee column recently routed by Jackson near Sheppardstown, was commanded by Burnsides. Four brgades of the enemy rushed across the river, when Jackson, precepitating his whole force upon them, they were Literally moved down. So many were killed that the stream almost damed up with their bodies. About l5, ,000 prisoners were taken, and of the whole force, esti mated at 20, 900, it is thought not more than 900 escaped.

 NORTHERN NEWS.

 DEs ARC, Sept 25.-W take the following from the Memphis Bulletin of September 24th:

 WASHINGTON, Sept. l8.-There is nothing later than the dispatches of Gen. Mcclellan, dated this morning. It is conceded that the victory is splendid one, as it is completes and that the ene-' my will be utterly demoralzed, before he can reach place of safety.

 WASHINGTON, Sept 2O.-Our loss in the recent fight is estimated at fifteen thousand in killed and wounded. We have captured about 10000 priso- oners; all the Butternuts, with whom have con- versed, express themselves perfectly satisfied at tfe change which has come over the spirit of their dreams. They appear aware of the fact that they are in 8 very tight place, with poor chance of escape. Most of the rebel prisoners excuse them- 

 ing that the d-d Jeff Davis conscrpt got them into the army. The 2nd Wisconsin went into the fight yesterday one hundred snd fifty strong, and came out with fifty nine. The officers report is nineteen killed. 63 wounded and missing This splendid crack regiment of the west which came to the Po- tomac neary'eleven hundred strong is reduced to fifty -four fighting The force of the rebels engaged in the last battle is believed to be not less than one hundred thousand. They were command ed by Jackson and Longstreet In the fight of last Sunday, the rebel loss eleven hundred killed, and five hundred prisoners taken. The rebels are still visible the opposite shore in force They have posted large amount of artillery to prevent our forces from crossing the river. The officers of this army are unanimously of opinion that Hooker for his galantry and bravery should be made Brigadier General, in the regular army, in the place made vacant by the death of Mansfield

 Just before the war broke out, and before Lincoln's proclamation was issued, a young Vir- gnian, named Summerfeld was visiting the city of New York. where he made the acquaintance of two Misses Holmes, of Waterbury, Vermont.

 He became somewhat intimate with the young

 ladies, and the intercourse seemed to be mutual

 ly agreeable. The proclamation was issued, and

 the whole North thrown into blaze of excite

 ment. On visiting the ladies one evening, at the

 hour of parting they remarked to Summerfeld

 that their present meeting would probably be

 the last they must hurry home to aid in making

 up the overcoats and clothing for the volunteers

 from their town. Summerfed expressed his regret that they must leave but at the same time especially requested them to see that the over- coats were we'll made, as it was his intention, if he ever met the Vermont regiment in battle, to kill one of them and take his coat.

 Now for the sequel. Virginia seeded The Second Vermont Regiment portion of which was from the town of Waterbury, was sent to Virginia. The battle of Manassas was fought, in which they were engaged. and SO was Sum- merfeld. During the battle Summerfeld mark ed his man, not knowing to what State he be- longed the fatal ball was sped on it's errand of death the victim fell at the flash of the gun. and, upon rnshing up to secure the dead mans arms, Summerfrld observed that he had fine new overcoat strapped to his back, which he de- termined to appropriate to his own use. The fight was over, and Summerfeld had time to ex- lmine his prize when, remarkable as it may ap- pear. tho coat was marked with the name of Thomas Holmes. and in the pockets were found etters signed with the names of thesssters whom had known in New York, and to whom he had made the remark we have quoted. in which the dead man was addressed as brother. The evidence was conclusive-he had killed the brother of his friends and the remark which he had made in jest had melancholy fulfillment We are assured this narrative is literally true. Summer6eld now wears the coat, and our nfor- mant states, is not little impressed with the singularity of the coincidence."

The Manassas Kvacuation-Whcn IL


Began.",,"


Some of the newspaper correspondents have
been saying that the evacuation Of Manassas
commenced three or four weeks before Sen.
Mcclellan discovered It. He began bis advance
on the 9,b instant, and q letter picked up within
the cnrenchments, dated Camp Pickens, Ma
nassas, Virginia, 9Th instant. states precisely
wien the evacuation begun. This letter, which
we have In our possession, says:


see none Of the Richm md papers
have published the facts herein communicated,
and, therefore, think they are prohibited doing
so; and. for this cause, would guard you
against making them public The evacuation
Of Manassas Ia at this moment In process Of &C.
complishment. This process has been carried
on for the last week, and ct last II seems that
the store Of Government provisions and ord
nance has been touched


The ladies were ordered TO retire beyond
Culpepper Courthouse Q week ago; then tie
sick soldiers we're sent back; and since and
now all the cars have been employed In trans
porting Government stores, except the ps1en-
ger cars The large hospital, built here last
autumn, 10 being cleared Of sick men, bedding
and other furniture, which are sent TO the rear
We know not where. Large quantities Of ord
nance, quartermaster's, and commissariat's
stores yet remain, and we opine that the pro-
posed evacuation cannot be accomplished In
fess than three weeks, and even then large
quantities Of baggage will necessarily be de
stroyed. We were 40 fortunate a. TO obtair
transportation for our private baggage tt
Lynchburg. We are ordered TO be prepared
fer field service at any moment, and to sepa
rate from the heavier baggage such tents, cook
ing utensils, &C., rs are necessary Tor taking
the field in the very lightest order.


withstanding these facts, the fortifcation'
Of this camp are being made more secure BY 9
fatigue party Of thousand men constantly a
work from the rising to the setting Of the sun
This seems to contradict the Idea Of evacuation
and the suffers, who have large stores here, re
poe hope thereon. But we suppose this Is done
only to protect us against an attack before
evacuation can be completed. This seems tc
be secret with the Government, aud 1t is o.
the utmost importance that the enemy should
know that we are iortifying Manassas, and i
Is Of the utmost Importance that be should b.
ignorant of any intention on the part OF ou
General to evacuate bis present line. Our arm!
is weaker now than II ever was before, ant
than l ever expect It to be 10 future. TbOs
who have re-enlisted and gone home have, Ii
my Judgment, displayed less patriotism thai
those who remain and refuse to re enlist 70
they have thereby literally exposed the arm.
to a sacrifice; but, thank Heaven, II has no
been sacrificed yet, and we trust that volun
teers will yet come to its relief ere the invader!

 RICHMOND, Sept. Q.-Lynchburg dates ot to-day say that the Yankee column recently routed by Jackson near Sheppardstown, was commanded by Burnsides. Four brigades of the enemy rushed across the river, when Jackson, precepitating his whole force upon them they were literally moved down.

 NORTHERN NEWS.

 DEs ARC, Sent 28-W take the following from the Memphis Bulletin of September 24th

 WASHINGTON, Sept. l0-There is nothing later than the dispatches of Gen. Mcclellan, dated this morning It is conceded that the victory is q splendid one, as it is complete; and that the enc my will be utterly demoralized before he can reach place of safety.

 WASHINGTON, Sept 20.-Our loss in the recent fight is estimated at fifteen thousand in killed and wounded. We have captured about 10000 priso- oners all of the Butternuts, with whom have con versed, express themselves perfectly satisfied at the change which has come over the spirit ot ther dreams. They appear aware ot the fact that they are in very tight place, with a poor chance ot escape. Most of the rebel prisoners excuse them- selves for getting caught in bad company, by say ing that the d-d Jeff Davis conscrpt got them into the army. The 2nd Wisconsin went into the fight yesterday one hundred snd fifty strong, and came out with fifty nine The officers report is nineteen killed, 63 wounded and missing This splendid crack regiment of the west which came to the Po- tomac nearly eleven hundred strong is now reduced to fifty four fighting men. The force ot the rebels engaged in the last battle is believed to be not less than one hundred thousand. They were command ed by Jackson and Longstreet. In the fight ot last Sunday, the rebel loss eleven hundred killed and five hundred prisoners taken. The rebels are still visible the opposite shore in force They have posted large amount of artillery to prevent our forces from crossing the river. The officers of tliis army are unanimously of opinion that Hooker for his gallantry and bravery should be made Brigadier General, in the regular army, in the place made vacant by the death of Mansfield

 FREDERICK, Mp, Sept 20.-A gentleman who left BoonesbOro last night says that the firing was between ours and the rebel batteries across the river-the latter endeavoring to prevent our pursuit, at the river banks; many conflicting re- ports were received here, during the day ot skr- mishing with the rear guard of the enemy who were in full flight for the Potomac

 A gentleman who left McClellan's headquarters before the general started was informed that at o'clock Burnside had crossed the Potomac, and was harrassing the rebels rear. The latest reports re- ceived are that the rebels forced to destroy large portion of their trains and spike and aban- don much of their artillery to prevent their falling into our hands closely were they pursued by the union army. Mcclellan rode out towards the front at II o'clock, and was loudly and enthusiastically cheered, by the troops as he rode along.

 HARRISBURG, Sept. 20-Accounts of the battle of Sharpsburg don't give any satisfactory result to the public I was on the field and saw it all. It was a splendid triumph McClellan's modesty has pre- vented him from telling the people what the army has really accomplished.

 HARRIsBuRG, Sept. Ex-Governor Curtin is still at Hagerstown. A feeling of perfect security is now felt in official circles. Quite a number of wounded have arrived here and at other points on the Cumberland Valley road.

 The news of McClelans great victory achieved to-day was received with great rejoicing. The troops here are urging to be sent forward that they may yet assist in the great work.

 BALTIMORE, Sept. l9.-I'he body of Gen. Mans field arrived here to-day, and is being embalmed.

 The S7th Ohio three months men from Harper's Ferry, passed through here tonight for Phadel- phia, on their way home.

 PHILADELPHIA, Sept. 20.--The Press of this city publishes a special dispatch dated Middletown, Md 18th, giving particulars of the reoccupation of Harper's Ferry by Gen. Burnsides corps. The rebels rereated leaving, sl the cannon and stores behind, and several hundred of Gen. Mills men who had not been paroled. The fedcrals crossed into Virginia on the bridges which were unnjured and pursued the rebels as far as Martinsburg.

 BALTIMORE, Sept 20.-A dispatch has just been received from a special army correspondent of the Baltimore EAmerican, from keesviile, via Fred erick, ss! Sept. 18th, saying that the rebel army retreated during Thursday night towards the Po tomac river. McClean's army all in motion at an early hour this morning prepared to renew it's offensive operations against the ehemy. By lO o'clock every road was crowded with our troops and trains moving towards the Potomac, across the Antictam Creek bridge. Twelve hundred rebel prisoners arrived here this morning from Frederick, captured by Mcclellan; they are now embaTking for Ft. Delaware; another train is on the way; the prisoners are dressed in all manner of garbs and are very dirty and ragged

 HEAD QUARTERS Army Of the Pot0Ipac Satur- day morning. Sept. 20.-The rebel army have sue ceeded in making their escape from Maryland.- They commenced to leave aboutdusk on Thursday evening, and by daylight yesterday morning were all over except small rear guard.

 They saved all their transportation and carried off all stheir wounded but about 300. Between three and four hundred rebel stragglcrs were taken during the day by Pleasanton's cavalry, who took the advance. Nearly every hoSse in Sharps burg was struck by our shells-two were burned. The citizens who remained escaped injury by stay ing in their cellars The name given to this battle is the Antictam. After our forces occupied the whole field, the rebel loss was found to be far greater, particularly in killed than at first suppos ed-full 2,500 were found lying on the filed, while 4 larger number had been buried the day before by their friends Their loss is in killed and wounded not far from IS to 200OO. The rebel Gems Rip ley, Walker and Hays were wounded, and Clark killed The rebels On Thursday night burned the railroad bridge and several houses at Harper's Ferry. The citizens of Sandy Hook were fleeing to the country on Thursday night to escape from being impressed into the rebel service and carried into Virginia. Large details of men were made this morning to bury the remaining dead which had become offensive.

 Drs ARc Sept. 28th--We make the following summary of news from the Memphis Bulletin of the 24th. ' It is reported via Cairo that RJsen- crans has achieved brilliant victory over Price, at Iuka Mississippi, and that Rosencrans was pur- suing Price's panic stricken army"" The first re- port says Confederates lost five hundred killed and wounded one thousand prisoners and thrty-six pieces artillery, and that federals lost four hun dred killed and wounded. The later accounts say that the probable loss both sides, killed and wnnnded was 500. That the federals cap tured 300 prisoners, and were in pursuit, and would probably capture Confederate artillery. Also, that Confederate Brig. Genl. Little was killed, and Brig Genl Whitfield wounded.

 The lady who brought the paper from which the above is taken, says, before she left Memphis re- ports conflicting with the above came in, but it seems all she could learn of 1t that Price cap tursd 2000 prisoners! There has recently been delegation of men from Kentucky and Indiana, at Washington, urging on the administration the creation of a grand army of the north west. to be under command of Governor Morton of Indiana. They nIndpp their section to crush ont the rebel"

The Battle u, EcmIer's will.


The fight, Saturday last, on the Potc-
mac, between General Jackson's corps and
Il column of the enemy, took place in the
immediate vicinity OF Bolelers Mill, by
which designation, the battle will probably
be recorded. 1t WAS another Balls Bluil
affair, as we learn from various sources.


The Lynchburg epubIican, Of yesterday,
has some interesting details Of the bntle.-
1t says that on Saturday morning, General
Jackson, who still held the north bank Of
the Potomac near Shepardstown, became
aware that a heavy column, commanded 10y
Burnside. had arrived On The opposite bank,
and was preparing 10 attack him. General
}. concealed his troops as well as possible,
so as 10 show hut II small force, leading the
enemy to believe their capture would be an
easy matter. A battery Of four pieces was
placed on II lill in close proximity to the
river, but the ariillelists were ordered 10
fire only one round, AID then abandon thei'
guns The ruse Lad the desired effect
-Four brgages Of the enemy rushed across
the river, and towards the guns, when
jackson preripi'ated his whole force upon
them, as with the power OF an avalanche.
The enemy We're literally moved down, aud
their entire body nearly annihilated. Out
informant states lat the slaughter was tue
most terrific ever known, in so short space
of time. NJ ny Of the poor wretchcs en-
deavored to regain the south bank of the
river, but were slain in the attempt, and we
are assured that SO great was the number
of the dead, that the stream was almos,
damned up by their bodies.


About 1900 prisoners were taken, and OF
the whole force, estimated at ten thousand
not more, it is thought, than two thousand
es aped.


Our own losses are represented to be
very inconsderable, but the extent was not
precisely known. 1t was supposed, row
ever, that two hundred and fifty, killed,
wounded and missing, is IA large estimate.


Thus has the inyincible Stonewall and
his brave band added another imperishahIe
leaf to the already lustrous chaplet which
encircles their brows.


A man who came into our lines, on
Monday, in. this Department, says he
heard rebel officer, who was collect
ing conscripts, say, that General b
marched 10000 men over the river
and surrendered without firing a shot,
but that while the rebels were in the
act of taking them prisoners, General
Mcclellan completely surrounded
them, and cut Jackson's army to pieces,
and wounded jackson. The itch.
mond Eaaminer, Of the 25th makes nc
mention Of the ""Great deteGt Of Gen
Bmmside,"" from which we infer that
the rebels, who thought they had cap
tured Gen Burnside, were very much
in the condition of the man who cap
tured Tartar, who was too strong fol
him. He was anxious to take the Tar
tar along, only the Tartar would no
allow him to. So in this case, they
would like to have taken Gen. Burn
side along, only he, the General, woult
pot allow it."

mors were rife yesterday forenoon that riot
had broken out in Camp Lincoln, the suffers
tent destroyed, his goods stolen, and one man
killed. On enquiry at the camp we found the
following to be the facts:


The sutler at the camp, Mr.. ID. S. Jones,
owing to the scarcity of change, and inability
to procure postage stamps sufficient to supply
the place of change, has been obliged to issue
tickets in lieu of the same. Those tickets he
has promptly redeemed when they have been
presented to him by the dollars worth. Yes
terday morning one of the soldiers insisted
upon having the silver, and upon being refused
kicked up row. Taking advantage of the
absence of many of the officers, some fifty
men broke into the suffers tent and stole
money and goods to the amount of about
$500, and then demolished the tent. All of
the officers and the great body of the men dis
countenanced these outrageous acts, and when
assistance was called for to disperse the mob.
it was promptly at hand. The company from
Lewiston, with some others, soon drove the
rioters away, but no one was killed or injured


A meeting Of the officers, regimental and
line, was subsequently held. 1t was called to
order by Col Lynch. Col. Virgin was ap-
pointed Chairman, and Capt. Horace c. Little
Secretary. After some remarks from different
officers, a committee, consisting of all the
Field officers and Captains Little and Prince
of the 23d, Captains Doughty and Harris of
the 25th and Cantains Snow and Plummer of
the 2Sth, were appointed to investigate the
whole matter aud report the names of the Of
tenders, who will be properly punished for
their riotous conduct. Measures have been
taken to prevent any like proceedings from
occurring at this camp."

Upon inquiry the police ascertanod that the regular

Como days ago. and that the Of the engine had been
conHded 10 the fireman, william Ford. There was a
scarcity Of water in the boiler tho time OF the expo
ton and the disaster sed by the sudden intro
duction OF cold water. great the that
che brick work around the boiler thrown the entire
Sength OF the cellar floor through the windows
enc street. Many windows in the adjoining buildings
were shattered and in places the shock experienced
was like that OF an earthquake.


The building not occupied by Singer h Co. but
merely rented for manufacturing purposes. The
team power however, der the control Of Messrs
Suger Co., and with them rests the responsibility Of
employing Ford engineer. The loss sustained by
che explosion Of the boiler and the displacement OF the

Mr.. George r. Mckenzie, who is employed as Singer l.

warrant the apprehension Of the agent who
quirsd to give bail in the sum Of $500 TO answer.

icy is experimental, and the Louisville Journal
thinks the President has evinced the highest ele
vaton of character, the largest and most states
manlike sagacity, 10 carrying forward this exper


pent to its final and decisive test


More than one year has elapsed since the Star
Of the West was fired upon, and Fort Sumter re
duced by rebel cannon. A million men have
been called 10 arms, and not less than one hund
red thousand of the bragcst and best citizens OF
the Republic have been sacrificed in defense Of
the Government How costly the Offering


What price was Ellsworth's, young and braycY


How weigh the gift that Lyon gave,


Or count the cost of Bakers grave p


Hundreds Of millions of treasure have been
expended in attempting to possess, hold and 90
cupy the forts navy yards, mints and other prop
erty belonging to the United States. The lying
charge that the war was prosecuted by an aboii-
tion President to destroy slavery, subjugate
States, burn towns, lay waste the country, and
murder and rob the inhabitants has been every
where refutrd by the advance Of the Union ar
mics. in excluding fugitive slaves from the lines,
protecting all kinds Of property, and treating
prisoners with kindness and the people Of con-
quered districts with the highest respect. No
traitor has yet expiated bis crime on the gallows
Pirates that swarmed the seas have been treated
as prisoners Of war, and even some Of the lead
ing conspiraiors have been released on parole
from the comfortable national bastiles on their
simply taking the oath Of allegiance, bich in
almost every instance they have not failed to vio-
late. How has all this kindness been requited
What has been the effect Of such policy? For
bparance has heen considered evidence of cow
ardce and pusilanimiiy protection OF property
repaid by the general confscation or destruction
of property Of loyal citizens. The toleration Of
rebel sympathiyers in the loyal States has been
rewarded by the exiiing. imprisOnipg, lynching,
or assassination of good Union men in the revolt
ed States.


Faithful history must record atrocities and
outrages perpetrated by the rebels in this con
test that would cause a blush to mantle the cheek
of New Zealand cannibal. At Manassas the
wounded we're bayoneted while pleading for mer
cy. One of the many instances which are well
authenticated, will suffice Louis Francis, of the
New York Fourteenth swcars before the Com
mittee--""I was attacked by two rebel soldiers
aud wounded in the right knee with the bayonet.
As | lay on the sod they kept bayoneting me un-
ill received fourteen wounds"" Ambulances
were fred on, and surgeons while attending to
the wounded. Many of the dead were buried in
trenches with their faces down. mark of indig
nifty. Graves were often opened to get the skulls
for ornaments. Savages and negroes have
been armed against the Government, and Mt Pea
Ridge our wounded were permitted TO be scalped
without rebuke, by these merciless wretches, and
scores of our men have persisted by partskng of
poisoned food left by t6e retreatpg rebels
Flags of truce have been employed to decoy our
men within their reach, aud then flung down and
the black flag displayed, followed by an indis.
crimnate slaughter Need we add TO this dark
catalogue Of barbarites the throat cutting of the
sick and wounded at Shiloh, as they lay in their
tents, the disregard Of age sex, the banging of
Union men by rebels in their diaboical fury and
the doleful tales of Southern prisons.


The committee on the conduct Of the war say
in their report. That every step Of this mon
Strous treason has been marked by violence and





depravty we gladly turn. The humane policy
Of the President must evidently come to an end.
All the rigorous measures known TO national law
must be employed 10 preserve the Government
from destruction. A Con5sca;ion Bill has at last
passed Congress, to punish traitors by depriving
them Of their property. The President refused
to fix his signature until the Bill was changed so
as not to apply to past acts. And yet the trea-
son .sympathizing papers Of this State contin-
tinually calling him the abolition"" President.


Gen Rosseau in a late speech at Louisville,
Ky, ian extract from which will be found on an
other page of this paper) said "" If we fail to
restore the Union the everlasting nigger' will
ha the cause of the failure. Standing before
the eyes Of the secessionist, the negro hides all
the blessings Of ouF Government, throwing a
black shadow on the sun itself If it had been
any other species Of property that stood in the
way, the army, provoked as it Las been, would
willingly have seen it's quick destruction.

ger of continuing it much longer and tell you
ght that if this war continues a year from

1t is evident from the signs of the times that
terrible storm is fast gathering which the conser.
vative President and Cabinet will be unable to
control, and if the traitors persist In waging this
desolating warfare, decimating the loyal popula-
tion, and putting nearly every family in the land
in mourning, ii will ere long burst like tornado
over their heads burying sIaUery treason and
the negro Coufederacy in one common grave OF
infamy and ruin.

an address before the Unitarian convention, In
New York, which is replete with noble send-
msuis, hishtoned principles, aud patriotic ut
terauces. We are sorry to see II msrred BY
what appears 10 us to be some very striking
defects. The following Is the portion OF the
address 10 which we allude


THE SOUTHERN CHARACTER.


No candid mind viii deny the peculiar CHARM
Of Southern young men at college. or Southern
climate, Independent Of servile Institutions,

spirit and manners, will not here consider.
But one might as well deny the small feet and
hands Of that people ss deny certain inbred
habit Of command; u contempt Of life III de.
fence Of honor or GLASS; talent for political
life, and An easy control OF interiors. Nor is
is real. II showed itself in Congress early and
always by the courage, eloquenoe, skill and
success With which II coutrolled msjOrities. II
showed itself In the social life Of Washington,
by the grace, fascination and case, the free and
charming hospitality BY which II governed 80
ciety. Hnow shows itself In Englandand France
BY the success With which II manages the courts
and the circles Of literature and fashion In both
countries. 1t shows itself In this war In the
orders and prociamationsc = OF its generals, ~

favorable care Ms II 10 able TO extend to Its own.
It exceeds us at this moment In the possession
Of an ambulance corps.


think the war must have increased the re.
spect felt by the North for the South. It's mi
raculous resources. the bravery, Of Its troops,
their patience under hardships, their unshrink.
ing hrmness 10 tho desperate position they
have assumed, the wonderful success with
which they have extemporizsd manufactures
and munitions Of war, and kept themselves In
relation With the world IN spite Of our msenia
have risen from defeat and the courage they
have shown In threatening again and again our
capital, and even our interior, cannot fall to
extort an unwilling admiration and respect.
Well ia General Mcclellan reported to have
said (prlvately) as he watched their obstinate
fighting ~ Antietam, and saw them retiring
In perfect order in the midst Of the most fright
full carnage ""What terrific neighbors these
would be! We must conquer them, or they
will conquer us""


The Doctor falls into very common error,
which has existed among very large class Of
Northern politicians and civilians for long
time, viz conceding to the South that they
belong to q superior race. The Sou,h itself
his set up this claim, and the North has heard
the brag and buster so long that It is ready
TO admit that il Ia all true.


What the good Doctor, In the kinduess Of bis
heart, claims for this people, and what they
claim for themselves, is all sham and pre-
tence.


They are not superior race, any more than
the Chinese, for they. as we'll as the Southern
ere, have small feet. Admit all that DR.. BEL
lows says to be true about their young men
and yorng women, and the graces Of some
of their statesmen, politicians, and litera.
ry people, still the large preponderance Of
Southern society is quite the reverse Of all
this. A more brutal, clustering, bragesrt, bar.
barous people, taken as whole, cannot be
found anywhere in the civilized world.
Witness their bloody and murderous assaults
upon Northern men in Congress, their Lynch
ings and burnings Of people for opinions sake
their killing OF school masters, and lmprison-
ment Of women for teaching children to read
the Bib!e What other people, DR.. Bellows
ever dug up the bones Of Its enemies slaugt
tered iu war. aud made these bones into drink-
ing CUPS and ornament, for household be.r-
looms to their children.


The whole history Of the South Is full Of bar
bsrities Of this kind, Of deeds that should shame
la half civilized and even uncbristian people
Slavery It Is that has made them what they are
sud given them this easy control Of info iors,
Of which DR.. b lows speaks in 60 conciliatory
0 manner.


Mat. Ward and Preston s. Brooks were o
this rsiasd clsss-ths men Of small hands
and small feet"" the very flower Of this boastet
chivalry


Out upon puch twaddling aud toaJyiug tt
Southern barbarism and brutality, say we.


We do not deny to the South courage sor
of commendable desperation in fght-grea
power Of endurance, and an indomitebls will
to bold out and to establish their own inde
, pendcDce Of the North. We can admire tbei,
heroism and bravery, though displayed In
bad cause, and can take pleasure in the though
that these people are Americans, whose father,
fought with ours to establish the glorioul
Union which they, the sons of thess men, would
now destroy.


We admit, moreover, that there Is one quail
ty or virtue in which they are our superiors
They are not toadies; they do not fawn ant
fatter for the sake of power. They Away
speak out what they think, and have certain
manly way ofuttering just what they please.


10 this they have been our superiors hereto
fore; but the race o! dough-faces is dying out
and we trust hereafter that other aud bette
qualities will predominats In Washington, ant
lend full as much of grace to society here q
was witnessed under the old regime


We are sorry that DR.. Bellows should inter
polats into SO eloquent and noble an addres
this mistaken appreciation Of Southern charac
ter.


The idea Of fsuperiority Of races should, unds
tho light of Christianity, vanish from the mind
of all right thinking men, and the fact that
man Ia . man be sufficient to commend him t,
consideration and esteem:

VIM. II. Aspnwall Esq, of New

disinterested patriotism to greedy con-
tractors and spectators who are thriving
of Of the needs and eXigehces of the
Government. As the agent of the War
Department in purchasing arms abroad
al IL stipulated price he received profit
Of $4,000 The whole of this sum he
has returned to the Government, dccln-
ing to receive any remuneration or to ac-
cept any profit from the operation. The
Secretary of War has appropriately ac-
lnowledged the receipt of the money and
the patriotic spirit which induced its re-
turn.

The advance of General Popes arm

The point has been regarded as one 4
great Importance to the Rebels, and
was supposed that the possession Of

and the occupation Of those two point
by our forces would sever the railroa

NoHfoLR, Monday, February 10, l6G2
! dispatch was received at Richmond at mid


uiVbt stating as f0ll0Ws
y courier arrived here this afternoon at 4
8 o'clock, AMI brought intelligence that Elizabeth
, City was burned this morning hy the iuhyhtauts


During The conhagrition tue Federals landed


large force. All our guntoMs excepting one


were captured by the enemy.


Gen Wise has not yet arrived at Norfolk.


The following very latest we copy from
t6-lays Aort0ik DdY B5ot


coufler arrived here yesterday afternoon
about 3 O'Clock. from which We gather tue fol.
y lowing information The enemy advanced in
y :, full force upon Elizabeth city yesterday about
y. u'cllck, aud began attack upon that place.
i The citizens hniing resistance vain evacuated
n the place, but before doing so set fire u the
u town, and when our informant left it was still in
- flame. We have also TO record the capture by
n lhe enemy Of nil our hlte feet except the
4 Fanny or Forrest, our informant is not certain
a which This euded the enemy and made mp
~ Pasquatauk River


She was pursued, however, and fears are en-
= tertainel that she was captured. II is sud that
y before our boats surrendered they were allan
"" douel, aud that their crews succeeded in making
""a their escape. 1t We are nla loss to conjecture
~ why the boats were not fred before they were
"" abandoned The disaster to our little ieet is
=, attributed TO the fact that having exhausted
, their supply Of coal and ammunition they pro-
- ceedea to Elizabeth city for the purpose of OH
- tanning supply. Every effort was made to
y, obtain coal but without success. aud the boats
= could nut, therefore, return to the Island aud
- tend any assistance whatever 70 our forces.
=, All tie details US published with reference to
:, :, the capture Of Roanoke Island are confirmed by
!, the Courier, who represents our loss at 300
, killed and wounded and that Of the enemy not
y less thar 600 killed.
Z, Great havoc was made among the enemy while
Il coming up the road leading to the Fort Our
nj forces brought to bear upon them two 81
no Founders, and at every fire their ranks terribly
j thinned. The places of the fallen, however,
Ia were quickly filed


N The Park Point Battery was manned by the
es Richmond Blues, and most nobly did they de-
n fend it. During the conflict they were attacked
,t by whole regiment of Zouayes, and though
~, completely OverpoweTed they stood their ground
H. They did not yield foot until all but seven Of
Il, them had fallen bleeding to the ground.
:. There is good reason to believe that had Col.
as IIennngsen with his artillery been on the
nj island it would not have been forced to surren-
= der.


be The lack of field pieces was sadly felt, and
of had they been At hand perhaps the enemy never
nd would have been able to have landed their
. forces


at Col. lIennngsen had ORDERS we understand,
in to report at Roanoke Island, but by pome mis-
in understanding he mistook Elizabeth City for his
he place Of destination.

cite the rebeon; and, if this be true, she should
have the benefit of the compensatory fact, that
she is no laggard in paying the piper. In addition
10 all sums previously voted, a new tax OF One
Million Light Hundred Thousand Dollars is about
to be levied in that State, of which 500, 600 is
for the National Tax assumed by the State, and
$500, 900 for reimbursing to the towns their al
lowances to tho families Of volunteers. Fourteen
municipalities, by the new bill, will be called mp
on 10 pay over one million Of this new levy; and


viii bear the burden probably with greater ease


than many small towns whose proportion is nomi-
nally Insignificant Mg. Speaker Bullock, who
made On elaborate address upon tie last bill al-


funed that Massachusetts, was not only wiling
but able to pay even more than the sum above
mentioned; and he mathematically proved what
he patriotically affirmed. There does not seem to
have been any oppositon-in that Legislature, at
least, Tax-bills appear to pass as matters of
course. So much for Massachusetts. Other
States OF larger or Of smaller resources have muni
fcently responded to the demands Of this perlous
day. There is nothing strange in this. The
shrewdest and least liberal fnancier understands
that without internal peace and political stability,
property is worth nothing, and monetary security
out Of the question. Great capitalists compre-
hend this, and supply great loans without grum-
bling; but II is the smaller demands mode upon
men of moderate means which, after all, swell the
the aggregates of the tax.bills, md which would
most naturally provoke popular dscontent. The
London newspapers long ago, with admirable FORE
sight, predicted that our populations would not
bear taxation; and these cockney Jeremiahs CON-
pacently waited TO hear Of the lynching Of col


ectors, and the stonning Of sub-treasuries by the
mob. 1t is unfortunate for their prophetic repu-
tation, that thus far there has been no popular
outbreak, and, above all, no popular clamor. No
people ever paid taxes, or prepared 10 pay them,
with 80 much alucrty. II il wonderful how,
through oil dscouragements and reyerses, the con-
idence Of our masses in the Government has
beer preserved. 1t IS the finest Illustration of the
benign workings of democratic institutions which
can bo found in history. Imagine Ireland, largely
occupied by rebels, bent upon the dismombeunont
Of the Empire and already partially and for time
nccossial-and where would bo the Funds in
Londoni Take another illustration. All English
literature of certain hind is full Of the most i'm
Fortunate complaints against taxation. Growing
there has almost risen to the dignity OF science
Men have made themselves famous by their
skill in lamentation-tho political weeping der
wishes Of the hudingr, Parliament, and tho news
papers. All the British patriots have been gram-
blera and most Of the grumblng has been ngainst
taxation.

American people submit TO burdens, which GER
tainly are not light, is to bo found in their alice

Dispatches transpirng with the War Depart.
ment state nothing more than that Bragg had
fallen back from his former position distance OF
f6siy miles, for the purpose Of securing snbsis:
tence. The combination of the Unionists having
been strongly reinforced, rendered the move
absolutely necessary.


It is surmsed thai Rosecrans had commenced
n strategic movement to form junction with
Buell. and cut off our army entirely.


Southern Var Esus-- Tie Retreat Of Bragg.
Tho Richmond Enquirer. of Oct. 81. says :.
The last we hear from Bragg's army he was at
London. Kentucky, falling back in order toward
Cumberland Gap. Bnell has a very large army,
and attempted to flank Bragg while at CAMP
Dick Robinson. which was prevented by this
retreat Buell. is yet endeavoring TO flank him,
and there may be battle any day. =.
fhe report Of the taking of a large number Of
prisoners from the Federals at Perryville proves
untrue.


From Lees Army.


""We have reports from Winchester that por.
tton of our army are advancing on to Charles:
town. Virginia, which is occupied by the enemy
in force We scarcely think that Charlestown
will be the theatre Of any great battle. A. skir.
irish has occurred at Warrenton. and another az
Kernstown within the past few days.
From Rsstern Vrgiaid,


General Echols, who at present commands
the Confederate forces in Kanawha Valley, has
issued an order urging farmers. to como 10
Kanawha for salt and bring forage for the army.
The attention Of the people is called to the above,
to comply with the requests of General Echols,
and at the same time TO promote individual
comforts.


The R'treaf Of Priee-slanghier among the


Rebels at Cypress Creek.


We learn from Jackson. Mississippi, that the.
bridge across Cypress Crsek WAS burned by the
enemy, and our forces were not aware Of its des-
truction till they arrived at the creek. on their
retreat. They were there forced to run down
the creek, and cross at the mill dam, where the
eiremy had a commanding position.


The slaughter of our troops at this point was
very heavy. The oversight consisted in the
neglect to destroy the railroad lesding from
Cornth 10 Columbus and Cairo, which enabled
the Federals to run reinforcements during the
entire night previous TO the retreat.


Flag Of Truce Boats.


On the 18th inst the Commodore run aground
above City Point, and detained the John A. Wars
ner one. day to tow her off. In Justice 10 the
officers and pi OTIS Of the John A. Warner, We
must say she has never been aground while run.

She takes up the following Rebel officers:

 berland Ford, which confirmed report of surround

 ing of the federals at the Gap The letter further

 stated that, on the l5th mail bag from Morgan s

 army to Buell., was captured. informing him of the dangerous situation of his command, and further that he had in camp only twelve days hafrations, | and asking that he be reinforced or diversion be 1 made in his favor The Republican vouches for | the credibility of the statement. Intelligence | has reached here that. on Monday or Tuesday last light came off at Denmark, Tenn, between a federal force and the cavalry regiments of Cols. | Jackson and Pinson. The engagement is said to have resulted in drawn battle, the loss on our side being one hundred killed and wounded That ot the enemy is not known. Our troops brought oil two hundred prisoners and two pieces of can non. We learn that some days since party of

 Capt. Blythe's rangers, in the Mississippi bottom, ambushed troop of federas, killing 9 or 30 and losing none.

 The following editorial in Argus:

 ""Ihe federal forces were withdrawn from Acquia Creek nearer the main army. This is done to fur ther complete the work of concentration long since commenced. Jackson and Longstreet are repre-

 sented making for Harper's Ferry where the Poto-

 mac can be easily crossed. We much doubt that

 Gen. Lee will dispatch over the line of the Poto

 mac into Maryland any considerable body of troops.

 He might thus considerably augment his forces in case of being compelled to retreat His situation with the Potomac in the rear would be any thing else than pleasant A large force is reported as having crossed at near Point of Rock, but the same dis

 patch making the announcement also chronicles the recrossing of the greater portion of them.- Late dispatches annou16e Cincinnati, Covington and Newport as not captured; but no two authori

 ties agree in fixing the whereabouts of Gen Smith, From IA to 100 miles distant, is the latitude in dulged by telegraphers, and whether the blow is nod at Or I.oui Ila ab1 to decide. The Falmouth rumor would indicate the former as the destination

 NEW YORK, September 1.-The bark Prentss Hob, arrived from Mantanzas to-day, reports an

 ron-clad war steamer arrived at Cardenas on the 18th ult., flying pictorial rebel flag. Our consul at Havana, Gen. Shupler, placed dispatches aboard

 the bark to be delivered at Key "" est, but although she lay off Key West eight hours with signal of distress hyng no notice taken of her, and the dispatches were mailed from this point.

 The pirate has already captured several mer- chant vessels, although they were heavily armed. In her cruise off the Bahamas her commander told the authorities she was rebel war steamer without a name. She is undoubtedly the '' 'Oveto'"

Philadelphia Inquirer writes Feb. 9th:


BY a hag Of truce, to-day, I learn that the BON
bsrdment Of the works on Roanoke Island con-
tiuued during yesterday. About noon, Com.
Lynch got his Mosquito fotIlla under wav, and
came down Currituck Sound TO assist his Rebel
friend Gen Wise, on the Island.


The Federal gun-boats then directed their Ere
upon the gun-boSts commanded by Lynch, and
at five O'Clock yesterday afternoon three Rebel
gun boats had been sunk, two were captured, one
OF which had Commodore's pennant flying du-
ring the action, and the rest dispersed In every
direction.


The firing ceased at dark last night, aud was
recommended with increased vigor and effect this
morning, and kept up until Ebout eight O'Clock,
when it's supposed the Rebel forces on the Island
surrendered.


fireman on board the Selden said that the
Federal troops had been landed in large numbers
on Roanoke Island, and the Stars and Stripes
could be seen at Elizabeth City hyiHg over the
Confederate batteries. II was rumored in Nor
folk, this morning, that three regiments had been
recently sent 10 Roanoke Island, and that there
was no chance for escape, the probability was
that they weI all captured.


The Rebels acknowledge that the only obsta-
cles of importance TO retard General Burnsideis
march inland and upon Norfolk, will be the
natural ones Of svamps, marshes, sickness, &c.


The rebels feel theiT recent defeats very sen
sbly and are growing desperate In theirfear."

London, at meeting held in that city some weeks
since. 1t is worthy the careful pcrusal of ev-
cry candid mind


Mr. Chairman You are an old friend of mine
and knowing me so well | am surprised that you
cali me up on street railways when the American
question is on the table | admit that am good
for speech on that or any other topic, but TO-
nicbt intend to sink the shop and talk the Sen
ate chamber suffice il to know that my success
Is complete. have run the gauntlet, with all
kinds of weapons aimed at me, but have passed
the Manassas Gap of English conservatism and
introduced carriage for the people with colors
1yipg and lots of money still in the treasury
But no more of that let me talk on America
thank you, Mr.. Wood, and you, gentlemen, for
your good wishes for peace You say England
is with us, and has been from the first. ] say
yes, yes-and the question is, how much plain
talking can you stand from man who loves his
wife. his children and his God, but who loves his
country more than all-for a man without
country is unworthy is unworthy of wife and
children, and poor God forsaken devil, he had
better die-and this, gentlemen, is what England
has recommended.


England's neutrality has already cost five thou
sand lives. She has made great mistake, and
three months hence she will acknowledge it,
viii you let me speak my mind Now beg Of
yOu gentlemen, not to get excited when tell
YOU a few startling facts to prove how unwise,
how ungenerous, how dangerous has been Eng
lands so called neutrality on the American ques-
tion.


Eneand's sympathies are with, and have been
with the South, not out of hate to the North but
because she wished to see us break in two. When
q man is very i'll it is, to say the least of it, in
very bad taste to 90 and order all your mourn
ing, for perhaps he may get we'll again, and how
surprised would he be to see the notices of his
death which were prepared. Eugland's neutrali-
ty consists in standing on the platform and cheer
ing the rebels on.


The Cabinet would declare war at once if it
dared and | am not sure bnt what the Mexican
intervention is war in disguise. Read the speech
es of members of Parliament to their constitu-
ens. You find them secession to the backbone
Is there any question about Lindsay's language,
or Captain Jarvis, or Bulwer Lytton. like the
latter for his frankness aud honesty. lie is no
hypocrte. He talks as he thinks-says he hopes
the country will not break in two, but in four
pieces 1t is already too powerful, and its growth
should be checked. England's neutrality con
siss in giving all her sympathy to the rebels.


Ere many months you may have revolution in
this garden island-the revolution that arises
from a starving population-for is there not un-
mistakabe signs of corn famine in Ireland ard
cotton famine in England? Suppose such to
happen, and class should be arrayed against





lea to Join the rebels, and cry justly for the dcs
truction of this proud nation, as England is con
tinuing to cry for Americas ruin? Here are the
facts | wish to make known.


The South has always been The enemy of Eng
land, as the North has been her friend. Every
act of hostility has emanated from that quarter.
Look along our hisOry's page. What was the
Non Intercourse Act previous to The last war, but
a Southern institution? Was not the Embargo
Act and the war of 1872 itself Southern insti-
tuition? The whole North was against it, and the
Hartford ConventiOnies, to this day, are subjects
of dersion by the Southerners for the sympathy
New England showed for Old England.


What was the High Tariff Act, the twenty five
cent-a-yard duty on cotton goods of 1916, but
Southern institution? All New England voted
against Cahoun's American system. 1t was the
same in 1920 and 1924 but the South having
passed their high tariff, the North showed its en-
terprse by putting up cotton mills, and it was
not for some years after (lS28) that the North
voted for q protection Then Calhoun, in 1882,
wanted to kill the banting he had created in
1917, aud because he could not succeed, started
his hell born notification cry, which was so sum
marily stopped by General Jackson. What was
the Mexican war but a Southern institution to
get new slave lands? What were the fllibuster-
ing expeditions against Cuba but Southern insti-
tutiOns? Where did Lopez hail from? Where
Walker? Where did Lynch law, the Bowie-knife



not reputation purely Southern institution
The Wings were with England, but the Demo-
Gratis cheered the Russian arms These are all
Southern Institutions, and certainly negro slave
ry is not an institution of the North.


Where then does England find food for sympa-
thy with the traitors in this hell born conspiracy
Was it the North or South that sent contributions
to Ireland in her distress Was it the North or
South who put their flags at half mast on the
Ih % II IaoI-o All fnlI- anil
who received the son of your Queen with open
arms, but the proud children of our northern
country? Boiling over with good will to Eng
land we took the Prince and embraced him, be-
cause we loved this old land and its mighty asso
Citations. We loved your Christian Queen and
showed these things in the warm and honest re
ception we gave her sou All this was in the
North, but when he crossed the border into the
slave country he FASTENED away quickly for fear
of repeated insult. Yes, gentlemen, it was in
capital of the so-called Confederate States, Rich
mond, that the Prince of Wales feared the action
of the mob, and saw for the first time that he was
not welcome in the land where once his ancestors
ruled


You cheer one side continu-
ally and hiss the other, and call it neutrality
However it has taught Americans one lesson
not to put their trust in princes, but to rely on
her own strong arm. 1t has opened their eyes to
many things, but none more important than this
namely, that England may war with Russia,
France with Austria, and all Europe may be bla-
zhg away with the flash of musketry, the clang
OF armor and the sound of cannon, without
America being affected


But when America, desirous of showing off
hermlltary nature, gets up little national sham
fight within her own borders in three months
time, with million of soldiers, fires million of
rifles discharges million of revolvers, and has
her artillery booming an every hill say, when
q


war, get up grand review, and kill thousands
of traitors on the Champs du Mars of the Poto-
mas. all the world tremblingly stops to gaze, and
all the worlds commerce becomes deranged. Eu-
rope may fish, but America cares not. America
plays with the firearms to keep her hand in, and
Europe is pale with fear, for it has come to pass
that the commerce of the United States with Eu-
rope sums up each year one hundred millions of
pounds sterling Stop this commerce for twelve
months, and millions here are thrown out of EN-
ployment

 Details by a Participant",,"The Battle at M'Dcwell' ll's-Interesting Details by Participant. correspondent of the Lynchburg Republican, dating at 'Camp in Pendleton county, two miles east of Franklin, May l2,'' writes: On Monday, May 5th, we left camp at Valley Mills, Augusta county miles north of Staunton, with five days ratons, without tents and baggage save blankets, under the- command of Gen. Ed ward Johnson, and the next day the advance guard under Col. Lecher fell in with the outposts of the enemy-one cavalry company and body of intan- trv near the forks of the Jennings Gdpand the Plrkersburg turnpike roads, 2 mesfIom Staunt 'n. Lecher fired upon the enemy, killing three, wound ing several, and taking one prisoner. About this time 'Od Stoneyxll' passed up the load and had a consultation Nth Gen. Johnson Soon after the consultation Johnsons army pushed up the road in pursuit of the enemy towards Shen- andoah mountain, followed by Jackson's When when arrived at the foot ot the mountain, on the east side we found regiment ot Yankees had been camped there. but left on hearing of our ap- pearence leaving behind all their tents, clothing commissarS' stores and number of small arms, most of which they broke the stocks of but several cases were left unopened and in fine order. After scouting the m untain throughly, we found that three regiments had been camped upon the top, but upon our approach had made nasty re- treat.

 When we arrived upon the summit we could see the enemy in hasty retreat the east side of Bull Pasture Mountain about five miles i'll advance. 1t being late ill the day, commander thought 1t prudent to halt and go into camp for the night At sunrise the next morning We were again on the line of march ill pursuit o the enemy; when we arrived at Bull Pasture Mountain We ascended to its summit. when Ashby's scouts reported that the Yankees had placed four pieces of artillery on the road leading into Mcdowell, on the west side or the mountain, where the road passes through narrow gorge. The heights commanding Monte rev were also in possession ot the enemy with ar tiery planted.

 The Lee ,tterv, of Lvnchburg, was selected to % in advance with it's rife guns but after reaching the summit of the mountain they were ordered ok -Gens. Jackson and Johnson deciding that no po- stion could be obtained

 Johnson's army [that is the intlntry) was placed upon the top of the mountain Alter the generals had reconn.itered for several hours, 1t becoming late they concluded to postpone an attack until the following morning; but the enemy receiving reinforcement, made attack upon Us about i've o'clock Afcer a desperate fight, which lasted five hours we drove the ehemy from the hed During the engagement Gen. Johnson came near being captured. Gen. Jackson, not knowing his position. gave orders for the filth Va. regiment to fall back, but the Richmond ,GAves, Capt. Al friend seeing the peTilouS position of their brave commander Gen. J. disobeyed orders and charged upon the enemy, thereby saving him from the Tan kees' clutches.

 Our loss is estimated at about 300 killed, wound cd and missing About one hundred of the num- Der were killed and mortally wounded. During the battle Gen. lohnzon's horse was kill ed under him, and the general received wound in the ankle from ball passing through the small bone of the leg, but l am happy to state that the wound, though quite painful, is not of . serious nature.

 The l2th Georgia regiment did most of the fight ing, and snfTeFed very severely. They lost l82 killed, wounded and missing, among them were many brave and gallant officers. One company of the 2th Georgia lost all ot its officers save the 4th corporal.

 There were only two brgades Of three regiments each both of Johusons army, engaged i'll the fight The first was commanded by Co., Y. q. Conner Of Georgia and the second by Col. Win. C. Sc""'', oi Virginia, of both of whom Gen. Johnso4 sDeak3 in

THE SITUATION.


The rebel batteries on the Virginia side Of the
Lower Potomac make demonstration occasionally
On Saturday night, while Gen. Sickles was review
ing his brigade, on the Maryland side, shell ex-
ploded within few feet Of his position, and on
Monday night the Cockpit Point battery threw
several shot and shell, with what intention or with
what effect it was not known.


General Shields left Washington yesterday to
sake command Of the late General Lander's brigade
on the Upper Potomac. Nothing of Importance
has occurred in General Banks division. Nearly a
thousand barrels of -four, belonging to the rebels,
together with woollen factory, owned by man
OF the ominous name of Davis, well stocked with
cloths. Were seized at Charlestown, by General
Banks troops.


The official report of the occupation of Nash
vile was received at the Navy Department yester.
day from Commodore Foote, as reported to him





General Nelson there without opposition. The
captain of the steamer who brought the despatch
TO Commodore Foote says that six miles below
Nashville there was q battery on q high bluff,
which had mounted fifteen guns; but several
Of them were thrown into the river be.
fore the boat arrived. He also reports
that q strong Union feeling was manifested
In and near Nashville, and that Governor Harris,
after vainly attempting to rally the citizens and
Others, left on Sunday morning for Memphis The
gunboats are the terror of the people of Nash.
vile and at points on the Cumberland, and that,
supposing the gunboats would proceed immedia
~ to Nashville, they retreated, panic stricken.
E The burning of Columbus by the rebels is con-
frmed by news from Cairo, which represents the
appearance Of terrible conAagration there on
Saturday night. There seems to be little doubt
that the rebel forces have gone to Island No. 10,
below the town, and are there planting batteries
to command the river.


Dispatches from Louisville state that railroad
communication between that city and Nashville is
now perfect, except about ten miles over creek
north Of the latter city, damaged by o rise Of
water. which would be repaired to-day.


Our news from Fortress Monroe is inter esting
General Wool and General Cobb had ano ther in.
terview of Craney Island Saturday last relative
60 general exchange of prisoners. There ap-
pears to have been some unexplained delay in
sending down the expected released prisoners by
General Huger. The steamer Express went up the
James river on Friday to receive them, and again
on the next day, but they did not arrive at the ap
pointed rendezvous. The commanding officer of
the rebel steamer jamestown stated that he had
no knowledge of any prisoners being ex-
pected, although the Express was sent up
to take y on board on the strength of informa-
tion furnished by Gen. Huger. The time of their
arrival is, therefore. considered uncertain in con-
sequence of these two dsappointments. 1t is not
positively known whether Col. Corcoran will form
one of the number when they do come.
The rebel steamer Nashville, which has been
lying up long in English ports, and was SO keen.
ly watched by the United States steamer Tuscarora
has succeeded in getting safe across the Atlantic,
and, as we learn from Norfolk, arrived at VIII
mngton, N. c., on Saturday, having run the block
ade at that place.


Our news from the Southern papers, which we
publish to-day, is rather important. The Lynch
burg Virginidn says that the rebel forces at Cen.
treville had received orders on the 2eth ult to
send all their sick to the rear and prepare for
marching orders. The women and children are
said to have been sent away.


The Norfolk and Richmond papers announce
thc landing of large force Of our troops at New.
port News, and they predict an immediate attack
on Pig Point. JEFF. Davis has placed Norfolk
Portsmouth, and the vicinity within ten miles
around, under martial law, by special proclamation


The Savannah Republican not only admits that
the communication between Fort Pulaski and sa
vsnnah Is wholly cut of, but declares that the
Unonists have erected three batteries on the river
In the form Of triangle, which it is impossible for
any vessels in the rebel service to pass.


The Atlanta (Ga.) Commonwealth says that our
troops hold Nashville, and that General Johnston,
who fell back to Murfreesboro has only one hall
Of his original force there, and adds that
IL Is doubtful whether he will make stand
et that point or not, but comedies that"

Rebels on the right. Being three times repulsed
they retreated, previously firing a farmhouse and
outbuidings between the lines, which Lad afforded
cover to our daring sbarp-shooters. The enemys
loss IL known to have amounted TO l6; il msy have
been more. Our men kept the woods and escaped
without injury. A fourth attack, intended for our

point the picket-line is no more than FIVE hundred

enemy sailed forth in strong force cleared the PITS
and advanced to our lines, initiating the iDcendiarism
of their comrades On the left by firing farmhouse
and outbuildings. They were finally repulsed, and
driven back with indefinite slaughter. Our Losses

The 25th Maine regiment was organized
yesterday afternoon, at Camp Abraham Lin.
coin. Col. John Lynch presided and the fol-
lowing officers were elected:


Francis Fessenden, Portland, Colonel.


Charles L. Shaw, 1t. Colonel,
Alexander M. Tolman, I"" Major.


We think this regiment has been peculiarly
felcitous in its selection of officers. Col. Fes-
senden is Captain of the 18th u S. Infantry,
and has smelt and felt powder during the war.
He was wounded at the battle of Shiloh. He
is son of Senator Fessenden. 1t Col. Shaw
has been on the staff of Major General Virgin
for some time, and was elected Captain of Co.
A, Portland Battalion. Major Tolman has
been very active in recruiting for the nine
months service. He was elected Captain of
Co. b, of the Portland Battalion.


The election of 1t. Col. Shaw and Major
Tolman leaves Co. A, in command of Lieut.
Jones, and Co. b. in charge of Lieut. Prince.
The 9th Regiment was organized by the
election of the following-Col. Lynch presid-
ing:

Messrs. Editors Perhaps a few lines from
this place may not be altogether uninteresting
to you, or to the readers of your most excel
lent paper, the Portland Press. A number of
copies of the paper are taken here, and as far
as we know, it is universally admired but to
the subject of our communication


Last Sabbath was rather an eventful day to
the worshipers at the Brown-house, SO called,
in this place. Many of the people who wor-
ship in said house doubtless design to be spir-
itual worshipers, hence they want only the Cos
pei preached to them, they do not wish to hear
politics, tcar, or any thing else but the gospel; !;
well it SO happened last Sabbath that the Rev.
Mr.. Boardman of Pownal, occupied the desk in
the Brown-house, and either not knowing the
character of his congregation or mistaking his
subject for the gospel, or for some other reason,
or reasons, preached in the afternoon sermon
for the times, what one of his hearers called
lynch law sermon, but what would simply pass
for a war sermon. Now judge you of the
speakers CONSERVATION when as he was proceed
ing WIN MS DISCOURSE as ne WOulu IN MS own
desk at home, one after another arose and
left the house, and many of them, from their
hurry and hustle and their blood mantled
checks, showing unmistakeable signs that they
were not faint, until as it is said, the entire au-
dience-deacon and all-with the exception
of some three men beside the minister had dis
appeared. But the surprise did not cause him
to discontinue his discourse, for the good par
son, doubtless feeling clear conscience proce-
ded to the end of his discourse.


Now Messrs Editors there are many of us
here who are right glad that the Rev. Mr..
Boardman preached as he did and now that the
ice is broken we trust that the Rev. gentleman
who has recently come among us will do his
whole duty to his flock, for it is notorious that
some of his hearers are any thing but union
men at heart.


Should this alone meet the eye of the Rev.
Mr.. Boardman he will take notice that that
sermon was appreciated by some who were
not present. w."

On the morning Of the 81 instant,

everything that would afford cover,
and who poured a naerciless fire from

confusion by the grape and shell from
the gunboats. The rebels manifested
great bravery, advancing to within
three rods of our boats, but of no avail.
A rebel colonel, in the act of leading
his men to a'eharge. for the purpose of
capturing gunboat, was shot by a
sailor, and his regiment scattered by
the well-directed fire Of grape. Sew
eral desperate charges were made, in
one case the rebels had laid hold of
the rail, to throw themselves on the
boat, when sailor made free use OF
his axe, and sent.the mutilated assail-
ants back, bowling over the loss Of
their fingers. With the aid Of pike and
axe, the rebels were driven from the
sides of the boats while the reserve
sent their compliments to the skedad-
dlers, in the form Of shells, etc.

whistling of two or three thousand bull
lets. Acting Master Lynch of the
Perry was also killed


While this hot work was going on
a regiment of rebels was seen march
ing to a narrow bend in the river,
about a mile and half below the
battle ground, and telling trees across
the river to obstruct the return of the
boats, which they now counted on as
an easy prize. As the attention Of the
rebels seemed to be given to this point,
Capt. Flusser determined to crafty
their wishes, by meeting them where
they most desired, having previously
determined to blow up every plahk,
before the stars and bars should eve

Accordingly orders were given to re.
tire and engagethe enemy in their new

opened a howitzer fire upon the am

away as though they were but chaff

THE N0RfHKRN DRAFT.


We received last night advlces from the
North, which, though not 20 late a. that we
publish In another column, brings news Of an
Important character. The North hss at last
settled the question Of immediate drafting, and
the Secretary Of War has Issued an order for
six hundred thousand more men TO crush the
rebellion three hundred thousand to be
raised under the recent call Of Lincoln, and
three hundred thousand more BY drsft Of the
militia. The order appears ofhcially 10 tho
Northern papers, but the circumstances under
which We Issue this mornings paper forbid its
publication.


This action Of ths Government st Washing-
ton had created the widest excitement 10 the
North, and the war feeling had greatly sub-
sidsd In IL enthusiasm. Tho opposition to the
order was not 10 be disguised. This order for
draft will cause an immense reaction in tho
popular mind Of The North, and We shall await
The next nsvs from the North and Northwest

\ RABBIT on 4 BATHS FIELD-Ax lxol-
DENT OF THE FIGHr AT MELvEEx HuL.-A
full grown rabbit had hid itself away in the
copse Of fence, which separated two fields
near the centre. and most exposed portion of
the battle ground. Rabbits are wont 10 spend
the day almost motonless, and in seeming
dreamy meditation. This one could have but
little rabbits think when choosing
lis place Of retrea: at early dawn that ere it
was eveniide there would be such an unwonted
and ruthless disturbance, During all the pre-
paratlon for battle made around in It's lair
throughout the forenoon, it nevertheless re-
nained quiet. Early, however, 10 the after
noon, when the rage Of battle had fairly begun.
and shot and shell were falling thick and fast
IN all directions q she'll chanced to burst so
near the rabbits hiding place. that he eidently
considered it unsafe TO tarry longer. So
frightened almost to death. ont he sprang INTO
the open field, and ran hither and thither with
the vain hope Of finding a safe retreat
Whichever way it ran, cannons were thunder
ing out their smoke and fire. regiments of men
were advancing or changing position, horses
gaoping here and there, shells bursting, and
solid shot tearing up the ground. Sometimes
it woald squat down, and lie perfectly still,
when some new and sudden danger would
again start it into motion. Once more it wo'd
stop and raise itself as high as possible on IFS
hind legs, and look all round for some place of
possible retreat


At length that part of the field seemed open
which lay in the direction opposite from where
the battle ragged most fercely Thither it &C
cordingly ran with all its remaining speed. Tn
observed by it. however, regiment was in
that direction, held in reserve, and. like Wei
iinston at Waterloo, was lying fat on the
ground, in order to escape the flying bullets.
Ere the rabbit seemed aware it had jumped
into the midst Of these men. 1t could 90 no
further. Int presently nestled down beside

As the man spread the skirt OF his coat over
tie trembling fugitive, in order to insure it all
the protection in his power to bestow, be 10
doabt feelingly remembered how much himself
then needed some higher protection, under the
shadow of whose arm might be hidden his own
defenseless head from the fast multiplying mis-
sies of death scattered in all directions


II was not long, however, before the rcgi-
ment was ordered up aud forward From the
protection and safety granted, the timid crea-
ture had evidently acquired confidence in man
as the boys are wont to say. "" had been
tanned"" As the regiment moved forward to
the front Of the battle, it hoped along tame
seemingly. as kitten, close to the feet of the
soldier who had bestowed the needed protec-
ton. Wherever the regiment went during all
the remaining part of that bloody day and
terrible battle, the rabbit kept close beside its
new friend. When night came on, and the
rage of battle had ceased it fually, unmolested
aud qnietly hoped away, in order to find
some one of its old and familiar haunts.

the sages of that ancient age discovered. and
proclaimed the fact, that there is God who
judgeth in the earth, and, though hand join in
hand, the wicked shall not go unpunished. The
man who to-day, Goliah like, yaunteth himself,
boasts of his prowess, and treads with lordly
step over the heads ofprostrate victims, ,tomor-
row bites the dust. The man who stands ready
to-day TO strike down him who dares broach a
new thought, or propose new measure, is to-
morrow set upon by dogs, torn in pieces, and
his body left to rot upon the dung-hil He
who to-day stands ready TO assist in putting to
ignominious death those who offend against
his taste, his prejudice or his whim, tomorrow
may find Judge Lynch adjusting the rope
around his own neck. Many man who has
lighted the fires of martyrdom with his own
hand, to consume the bodies of those deemed
heretical, has found himself roasting at the
stake in the blazing faggots. This common
change of tide in the current of popular feel
ing, seems to have taken place near the ""sa-
cred SOIL"" and some of those who but little
while since were thrsting for blood and would
not listen to petitions for mercy are now made
to realize how sweet ''the quality of mercy"" is,
and that ""it becomes the throned monarch bet
ter than his crown"" We copy the following,
by way of illustration, from ""Carlton's"" cor
respondence Of the Boston journal, which he
gives under the head of 9retribution


You remember that John Brown had an ac-
complice by the name of Cook. who was cap
tured among the Pennsylvania mountains and
delivered oter to Gov Wise, and suffered
death. The man who arrested him was Fitz
Hugh Miller Of Chambersburg. Yesterday |
saw seventy-four rebel prisoners marched into
that town guarded by the United States troops
At the head of the party marched man with
downcast eye, sun-burned, dusty, dressed in a
suit of gray, with a feather in his hat-the
same Fitz Hugh Miller, captain in the rebel ar
my.


The Dutch blood of the citizens, usually as
calm and steady in its flow the rivers of
their Fatherland, came up with a rush. Hang
him! Down with the traitor! Kill him! y min
gled with words not recommended by them
al law, were uttered. The excitement became
wild. Men, women and children rushed to OBJ
tain view Of the fellow-to obtain possession
OF him. The guards quickly put down the
demonstration by charging bayonets; that
alone saved the fellow from dangling by the
neck from one of the trees in the square.


Miller evidently thought that the hour of
retribption had arrived. He cowed before the
demonstration, and showed himself an arrant
coward. would not give two cents for his
chance of continuing this life If released to-
night and left to the mercies of the populace.


great change has taken place in the opin-
ions of men In this section. They have had a
big scare, have felt little of secession, of sla-
very, have lost few hundred horses. passed
sleepless nights, through fear been forced to
fee. They are waking TO the realities of war,
and are ready to put down secession and sla-
very also, without caring much about the man
ner Of doing it. The public pulse beats not as
1t did in the days of John Brown."

the female portion of our population, many
of whom are left destitute by the absence of
their male friends or relatives at the seat Of
war. Notwithstanding the immense sums
expended by the City Council to aid the fam


lilies of volunteers, crowds of deserving crea'
lures still suffer beyond expression; and the
worst of it is, that while the bold and worth


less never fail to push forw and claim a
share of the funds, the modest and retiring,
who ought to be the first to have relief, stand
trembling in the back ground, and are often
overlooked. Margaret Lynch, for instance.
had her husband killed in one of the late
battles of Virginia. She has child four
years old. Her husband no longer useful to
the country, her claims to relief were treated
with neglect, and for want of food and shell
ter, she and her child had to walk the streets
by day and sleep by night in various station
houses. To add so her distress, Margret
was, ""as ladies wish to be who love their
Iords.' and the other night she threw herself
down on the sidewalk Of one Of our streets,
in her dispair, and in that situation gave
birth to an infant. The police found her
there with her little girl crying beside her,
because, ""mama couldn't get up"" and the
whole party were removed to the Bellevue
Hospital A sadder story, if it was elabor
ately worked up, could hardly be told An
other woman, quite a young one, though.
Mary Ann Williams, was also found lying
on the pavement by the police the same
night. She had taken laudannm to get rid
of her troubles Her brother had gone into
the army, and work falling her, she was lsf,
penniIess. Finding it impossible to procure
assistance without the use of more brazen
assurance than she possessed, and being in,
suited by one or two whom she addressed,
begging for money to get food, she became
afraid that starvation WAS her destiny. Ini
stead of bread, therefore, she purchased
laudanum with the first three cents given
her, and took it to relieve her of a life she
was weary of. Mary Ann was properly
cared for. l might 90 on and detail host
of snch cases, but the catalogue would be a
painful one. I pity the woman from the
bottom of my soul. The streets are full of
them at night, and their pleadings are heart
rending. Thousands have been thrown out
of employment by the stagnation of business,
produced by the war. They desire to live.
Husbands, brothers, overs-al are going or
gone to fight for their country. What is to
become Of the helpless ones left behind?-
They beg for food until conlumel ly and hun
ger drive them semi mad; and then they do
worse, and that ends the story. Such is life.

 -Brigadier General H. w.

He had been transferred to this Division only two days before the battle, and had command If brigade composed of raw troops, and with their regiments greatly thinned by disease and death. Nevertheless, in spite of these draw backs, hard. ly known to his men or they to him, we are as- sured General Vessels fought with most distin- guished bravery, and although New York cor pondents can recognize the merits and deeds of only New York officers, when General McClel- Ian shall come to make up his account of the doings of this Division in that terrible charge of the enemy, we shall see the name of General Vessels among those most honorably men toned. .s. ...- |. .a.

cavalry, and after a sharp engagement they took
their heels, losing about twenty killed. We took
about forty prisoners, with their camp and camp
camped Friday night on esrneu's farm. Early
on Saturday morning we again took up the line
OF march, and about nine O'Clock discovered the
Yankee cavalry drawn up In line, In great force,





After waiting for some time 20 find out their
intention, we had, about IL O'Clock, TO open
upon them with two pieces from two batteries,

was standing on my horse by the cannon thst
fred the first shot, which fell in line shor; dis

men to give Il 70 them as fast they could load,
which was done until they all disS ppeGFed behind
the cover OF the woods. Our Infantry was then
advanced, and about O'Clock began one OF ths
most rapid and severe engagements Of the war.


We suffered severely for a short time. until we
got our men up, when we gave IL TO them hot and
heavy, and drove them back with great lou. Our
firing did hot cease until about one O'Clock at
night They left their dead and wounded on
the fSld, with about 400 prisoners, which We

The Union Feeling al the So-ls Extent and Precedence


RosO IL Can be Made Available in Bringing tie Reuoaed


States Back to Their Auegiance-7ne Aboliioniaso Of Ms


North the Only Obstacles in the Way Of a Perfect Re-


union, dc.


The conditions under which tho Union feeling at tho
South exists matter of the greatest onsequence
Tho fact that there is such feeling existing is beyond
dispute But IL is of the highest importance ascertain
where exists, what is the extent OF the feeling, and
whether 1t be mado available bringing back into
the Union any Of the States which compose the
Southern confederacy The facts OF the case far
have been able to collect them after dgsnt research
foows-Tho people OF all the Southern States
divided into two great classes which, for the sake Of dis
snction, may be called Union and state rights
The former willing TO lay down their and return
thor allegiance only under certain conditions and OK
press stipulatons. Tho latter undsmayed by the re-
reverses determined to yield fght
until they extorminated until their independence
Is achieved The entire population OF the States of South
Carolina Mississippi, Louisiana Florida, Toxas and Ala.
bams belongs to this class and large majority Of tho
people OF Georgia. North Carolina Arkansas ana vrginis
east Of the Allegheny Mountains.


yhc Union feeling exists and Union men are found in
largo numbers at Richmond at Manchester at Norfolk at
Lynchburg oil along the Upper and Lower Potomac and
along Chesapeake Bay, in many parts Of Georgia and
North Carolina, and In the north Of Alabama In Ten
nessee the Union constitute nearly half Of the
population.
There are two objections In the minds Of tho Southern
Union men to laying down their arms and returning TO
the Union The FIRST Is the belief their part amount
ng TO absolute convicton that the aboltionists and
radical republicans have such control Of the
that they will prevent them from eentsring the Union
on footing Of perfect equality with tho other States but
will impose upon them such disabilities will practical
ly reduce them far below the degree Of sovereign States
and make them mere Territories. They say that il the
principles Of the compromise OF 1850 had been faithfully
observed by the North they would have left tho
Unon and that they would now gladly return to their
allegiance they could be assured that all national egisa
regard to them should Be based upon those prnc
Pies They declare that Systematic and deter
republican party which caused the Southern States to
secede, and that nothing but want Of confidence in
the men whom nsy Sssyo g 90 n poT:r % a Washing
Chandler and Lovey that keeps the Southern States out
of the Union.


Tho second objection which they entertain is this: Tba.
II they to lay down their arms now rather give
them up and be received back into the Union
OF nominal equality with the other states these abo


tonists and The radical republicans would ct once lnau
guratc series Of legislation aimed directly at the de-
structon Of the institutions Of the South and would
until they had abolished slavery at the South 80 far
that could be done by legal that the


tonists would impose upon them disability after
DeCOme
grevous be borno and they would forced to fly to
again. that If reunion did take place would
be hollow and insincere because the sbotonists and
radical republicans would never rest until they had
eeeded in repeating the Fugitive Slave law and passing
act Of Congress- aboshng slavery in all the States
where IL now exists.


II the Southern Union men could be convinced that
these views Of theirs erroneous; that tho abolition
Congress powerlesa for evil that intsitu
would be respected and that they would be left
unmoested in the enjoyment Of their own customs and
modes OF e and If they could be assured that all ma
tonal legislation towards them would be based upon the
principles OF tho compromise measures Of 1880 moro


than half Of the Southern States would lay down their
arms 1T and return TO their allegiance


The Sate rights people at Richmond very much d.
vidsd sentiment in regard 10 the ability of the present
Confederate administration and the wisdom Of the defen
svo war policy Of the government. The administration
Of JEFF Davis has many warm partsans who strenuousy
defend both. But there is large and rapidly growing
party embracing many Of talent and influence who
do hesitate TO denounce both in the
terms They declare and argue that the at the
head Of the government are totally unit for that position
and that the defensive policy heretofore pursued has
brought the South to the brink Of They insist that
the latter least shall be changed and that armies be
at raised to carry the war into Pennsylvania and
Ohio."

We have been favored with an Interview
with friend late from Richmond. He hss
given ""a much important information from that
country Of rebels; mnch OF their s0hefings,
determination, and zeal In the cause Of the
Southern CopIederacy.


They appear to have made up their minds,
as a people, to suffer on, and 10 endure oil
sorts Of privations, rather than submit 70 the
Government Of the United Statea.


We are favored with number Of late Rich
mond papers. From these VIC shall make such
extracts as may be interesting to our readers.


From the Richmond Wing, Of October l6th,
we take the following:


The PRick OF NKaRoEs.--Ths Lyuchburg Re.
publican says that sales Of negroes are fre.
quent in that market, and at very high rates.
During the pasi week, number were sold,
ranging at prices, for men, at from 81 800 to
81 ZOO, and for women, at from 81 100 to 81 $50.
These prices seem to go to show that conn
dence ia yet felt in this kind Of property, not
wlthstanding Uncle Abraham's proclamation.


That looks well when taken as single, iso.
lated fact 10 respect to the value Of this kind Of
property 10 the land Of Dixie; but when we
look little further aud observe that other
kinds Of property Is also bringing an almost
fabulous price In this interesting land, the cir
cumstances taken in connection with other
facts does not strike one as anything very Pc
culiar.


By list OF retail prices furnished us up to
as late as October goth, we ind, for instance,
that milk is 40 cents per quart, butter 81 rs
per pound sweet potatoes 81 SO per peck, eggs
81 per dezen, -four s22 barrel, felt hats sl2
piece, tobacco ST. pound, tin cups rs cents
piece, coffee, none, rye rs cents pound,
| used for coffee, and thus all through the cata-
logue Of the common necessities ofliie, we And
there prices.


1t strikes us that the price Of ""ntg9rs"" 10 not
alarmngly high in a community where all com.
mon things bear such prices.


Negroes, before the rebellion, were worth as
much as the Lynchbnrg Republican now quotes
| them.


1t will be torue in mind that the COME tlsrste
money Is not quite as valuable as Southern
bank bills before the days OF rebellion.


The same paper has the following:
The NoRrn CAROLINA LEGTsLATrRE. = The
| Char otte DemU Ucrat learns that Governor Vance
| coDtemplates calling together the Legislature
of North Carolina. The day fixed by law, for
| the assem milling Of that body, IL the third Mon
day in November, but It is likely the members
VIII be required to attend about the nrst OF
November, If not earlier. II is said that meas.
ures are 10 be taken TO put down the specula.
| tors or put them into the army.
| Would II not he good idea 10 adopt this
policy this side Of the line?


| Something about coast detences:
COAST DEFENcEs.-The Charlotte (N.C.) Dem.
| Ocrdi learns that the State authorities are CIV.
| Ing their attention Ia the matter OF our coast
delences. 1t is important that timely prepara
| ton should be made for the warm reception OF
the enemy on the North Carolina coast. 1t Ia
| said that in reply to n request Of Governor
| Governor might take consCripts between the
agessrf rs and Is for that purpose.


The Richmond Eaquirer, of October oath,
speaks thus o. Southern patriotism;


CoHsIpERABLE.oF A Du uEERKHoE.-lu the war
of 1872, substitutes were hired at from s4OO to
| 500. This was when we we're fighting the
British lion, and patriotism was at u heavy dis
| count. But now, when we are fighting the
"" universal"" Yankee nation, when our houses
| hold sltars are threatened with desolation, and
/ our wives and sis,ers and mothets with a fate
i worse than ten thousand deaths, no man will
| take up his musket for another for less than
nitesn hundred or two thousand dollars.


The came paper rejoices over the Northern
elections, where the Democrats have been sue
cessfui, evidently considering this triumph ol
the Democracy favorable to the South, as they
are. 1t says Of the election in Indiana, tina,
the Democrats having the Legislature may
return the expelled Bright to the United State
Senate.


We shall make further extracts from these
Southernj Journals, now in our possession, viii
such comments as seem to be appropriate
Our readers may be assured that wo have ssy
erai entertaining disbes for then in future mum
bers of our paper."

The Mississippi and the Northw .s..
[From the Grenada miss. Appeal, Nov. I4.l
Nonthern journal speaks In very sangune terms or

success because certain extent tho pecuRary pros

This expedition is at this time brought conspcuous'y
before the Northwestern States to countervaiI the
arguments OF General 3ragg's proclamation, and TO
quiet tho discontsnts which have begun 70 find their
earnest and significant uttsrance II characierzes

chosen for unless al political philosophy is at fault tho
alliance between the Northwestern and the New England
nuing TO humbug the former with such dclusve hopes
rest upon the Of plan for restoring by
the commercial OF the Mississippi to the States lying
on its upper waters That alliance is unnatural incon
and fatally preudcial to the Northwestern
In war or peace the policy that suits the New England
States must always be that most unavorabc to those Of
the Northwest The reasons well explained by the
Knoxville Register, in late issue. IL happens, as that
journal says that all the vast manufacturing establish
ments Of the East only required by the change
the condition Of the country change the mode rather
than the extent and character Of their employment





Danvers to-day finds greater demand for the
products OF his skill than in time OF peace; the
factures So too with the spinners and wcavers and
blanket and with all artisans. The workshops OF
changed the direction Of their abors; aud such is the
destuctveness OF armies that without the trade Of the
South the demand for the products Of New Fngand's
dustry Is perhaps greater than at any former period in
the history Of the continent.


We therefore understand why it is that agricul
tura States evince symptoms Of dissatisfaction with
England. q
fanafcs and its prohablcnoes still cries for blood
still the extinction the South The West
begins think peace whAc the East satisfied with
all the booshed Of the past demands other victims be

If Memphis had done the same thing, she would not quake so often. One tenth part of the money that was taken all over Arkansas, Mississippi and Texas to buy up necessaries to speculate upon would have built fine gun boat fotila.

 The federals have l5,000 troops on Ship Is land and P vessels used as transports.

 The Memphis Avalanche of the 18th says that Col. Maxey's Texan regiment of infantry, and Col. Locke's Texan regiment of cavalry, left Memphis that day for Iuka, Miss.

 When the federals first went up the Tennes- see river, they made g show of respect for pri vate property and made many professions ot friendship. But this lasted only for day or two. The Avalanche says they have driven the men from their homes and offer all sorts of in- dignities to the women. When they find house vacant they burn it, their presumption being it belongs to a patriot.

 Gen. Beauregard was reported sick at Bow ling Green. Another report is that he had reached Columbus in feeble health and had set everybody to work.

pear being captured OF killed by Gen. Keyes. The
horse of one Of his staff was killed under him IN his

TruEtvOrthy scouts report that the Rebels have
almost entirely abandoned their position upon the
south bank of the Rsppabannock, and bsve fallen
back 70 the immediate vicinity Of Gordonsve and
Richmond. 1t il believed that the greater portion Of
the Rebel army of the Potomac has gone 10 the
relief of Norfolk and Yorktown, at which places the
enemy have doubtless concentrated their whole
strength.


The utter destruction Of rails and cross-ties beyond
Cedar Run greatly retards our movements upon the
line Of the Gordonsville Railroad, and renders al
immense outlay Of capital and labor necessary before
any blow can be inflicted upon the enemy by our
advance.

BANQUET OF THE IRISH BRIGADE TO GENERAL


MEAGHER.


This evening the officers of the Irish brigade gave
grand banquet honor Of their new commander General
Thomas r. Meagher All tho arrangements were made on
the most liberal and extensive scale. Elegant dccora
tons inspiring music and stirring speeches conspired
render beautiful and brilliant the convvia scene. At
the principal table, Captain Duffy, Of the Sixty.
ninth regiment, presiding. There sat General
uAoa6AoiS uouvt0A CuiSiuo, uouebt 11eintZciWati.
General Howard and General Richardson; Colonel Nu-
gent, Of the sxtyninh who commanded the Irish bri'
gade until General Meagher took charge OF IT, Colonel
Terry Of the Fifth Michigan and other guests Of equal
rank. The ofncers Of tho brigade occupied the two
tables extending the entire length Of the long marquee
The banquet prepared in elegant syo quite to the
asonishment Of tho guests who did anticipate such
grand display in camp nearly dozen miles from the
capital.


Captain Lynch, Of the Sixty ninth, in behalf
Of the ofhcsrs or the Irish Brinade, read
brief address Of cougratulaton and welcome II stated
that In this day Of trial and danger, when the
country demanded the devotion and service OF its people
il was fitting that General Noagher should become the
representative Of that which had suffered 50
much aud 80 deeply the wrongs laid heavy upon her by
dsspotic government, and that having aided in saving
the land Of their adoption from destruction It might b
bis proud privilege to be with thom in the effort to
for their native land tho blessings Of freedom and good
government which they had experienced in this


Gen. Meagher replied in a speech which was distiu
sushed for eloquencs and warmth he returned his
thanks for their upon his assump
tion Of grave and serious trust, upon which, he said
not only his honor, but the honor Of his race a.
represented BY the Irish brigade vitality involved
and he would add also the honor iu degree,
three thousand could affect IT, Of that hitherto
impeached and involable flag under which they were
proud TO enter on military service. Complimentinr
General Shields he said he would feel too great an
sumption to take command Of the brigade in his presence
he not satisfied that higher position awaited Gene
raj Shields than that of which he seemingly deprived
him. e responded to the sentiment that the education
the Irish soldiers receiving might bs of service
in the future towards the achievement of tho ndepend
once OF Ireland. He promised his entire devotion
tnt thn If tbn I'm md
the decree Of Heaven that he should fall in this
conflict he could state in all sincerity that he would be
satisfied to have those who should survive him write
upon his tonbstone-and nober opitaph no Irishman
exied Irishman could desirs-Fghtng for the Irish
sxies most happy homs, Thomas Francis Meagher died
at the head Of his brigade""


General Hentzslman then called upon 10 speak but
the General being more Of q soldier than an orator,
briefly returned his acknowledgment and pointed out the
absolute necessity there for those who were en-
gagged in the military service Of the country give the
entire attention and devotion 10 the work Of asserting tho
supremacy Of the government.
General Shields followed In some patriotic remarks in
which he said that 1t the exigency Of the hour alone
that called him to the field again. and to give what stl
reputation he had, and IL need bo what blood there was
left in himhe having been, Supposed ''mortay
wounded in Mexico-towards rcdcemng the American
and character from the andcrous attempt that was
now being made by the rcbos TO crush II down into de.
gradatiou He euogzcd the American nag predicted tho
speedy downfall Of the rebellion and said n England and
France should interfere IL would only cxasperate the
North cnrod and the Union soldiers would lay down
their armor until they had carried our ag victorious to
the Gulf In spite OF France and England.


Speeches were also made by General Richardson Gene
raj Howard Colonel Terry Of the Fifth Michigan rcsi.
mcnt Colonel Cass Of tho Ninth Massachusetts regiment
and others.


A series Of resolutions, highly complimentary 10
Colonel Nugent OF the Sixty ninth, were read The
Colonel acknowledged the compliment in a becomins
manner."

Why Commodore Lynch did not carry his

vance OF the Yankees in that direction

ment.


The Richmond whig Of October 22d says,
a letter from the Mayor OF Wilmington. N 4.

During Friday night the Confederate flag, which has
been flying from the yard OF townsman, John o. L..
Goggin, Esq.. forciby torn down by trai-
torous scoundrel, the flag staff broken in two, and
the cord by which the Tag hoisted cut up into
small fragments. The nag itself was torn into tat.
tcrs and from its appearance when found would seem
TO indicate that the guilty party desired particularly
to strip the stars from it, not vcstge OF any OF
them left. The act q and dos picabe one
and proves concusvey that there Is at least Lin
colnite in our midst, for no one feel sure with
spcck of Southern spirit could have been guilty Of such
act. We hope the mscreant will yet be discovered and
that he may have his deserts awarded him."

 self, and that they would search the house. Then he knew it was time to look about him - Accordingly he passed through another room, assembled two flights of stairs, and then found himself in the attic. One of the windows was open. He went to this and looked out. A sud. den thought struck him. The water spout was tjust within his reach. He was sure it would bear his weight. Without stopping for further consideration. he grasped it firmly with both hands, and swung himself out. Working slowly upwards. Tn moment more he was on the roof and safe!

 The lower rooms were all thoroughly searched by the men in pursuit, but without avail. and at last Edith led them to the attic. She had be- gun to breathe more freely As yet no trace of Harry had been discovered, and she hoped he might yet, by some chance, escape. One of the men noticed tue opeh window. He approached to it.

 He cannot have escaped from here,' he said

 It would be the death of any man to jump upon the hard stones below! aln satisfied he cannot be concealed about this house.

 With many apologies for the ntrusion the men descended the stairs, and left Edith to her. self. She sat down feeling strangely, faint and sick, now that it was all over. It was myste. ry to herself, as we'll as to the men, what had become of Harry, for she was satisfied in her own mind, he could not have been in the house while 1t was being searched but she was too weak to go to look for him. Her limbs trembled beneath her weight when she attempted to do so, and she could only sit there, white and still hoping, praying, yet fearing

 A long half hour passed, and then the door was opened cautiously, and the very object of all her solicitude entered. At the sight of him, lite and animation at once returned to her pain fully throbbing heart, and strength to her limbs. She sprung up with quick cry of joy and sur 1 prise.

 T thank God that you have escaped those evil men, thus far, dear Harry. Where did you secrete yourself?

 You remember the open window in the attic ?

 Yes but you did not escape frsm that r. One of the soldiers said it would be your death to jump from ii ?

 I heard him. was safe on the housetop at that very many moment. The water-spout was just in reach from the window, and it was easy work getting to the roof by means ofit.' hen that is the way you managed it! God has been very merciful to you thus far. What would have been your fate, had you been taken by them!

 Probably should have been hung as spy, without law or justice-it may be, lynched L. | The soutberners hate us northern men all too heartily to have let me off with light punish. ment. Another thing would have gone hard with mel am soldier in the United States Army !

 And you have venturcd herein the very heart of the enemys terrtority o, Harry Les ter why did you come? Fly, fly, while you have the opportunity!

 The young girls voice WIS hoarse with SUD- pressed agony, and she looked imploringly into her companions face, with her wid scared eyes.

 am going directly. dear Edith, now that tho object of my journey has been accomplished, and have seen you safe ard well. Only promise me one thing! Will you remain true and faith. ful to the vows you have breathed to me, and when this dreadful strif. is over, if God spares osr lives so long, will not you then be mine, forever?'

 Yours, and yours alone, dear Haryr

 The young man pressed the girls hand in si. lent gratitude. and half an hour afterwards stole forth in the disguise of washerwoman, with a basket of clothes upon his arm. He left the village without melestaton, and succeeded in reaching his regiment in safety. He is now with it, battling bravely for his country. And sweet Edith Cliltoni She will hold her promise sacred, through all her prosecutions aud temptations, and will be ready and willing to re. deem it when the happy time shall come,-and never was farer bride than she will make.

 GAMBLING, A PRoFEss1oN.--A writer in the Cincinnati Dollar Weekly, in sketching tour through some of the Southern States, gives m incident in his trip from Memphis to New Or leans; which reveals phase of characterin some of tho professional gamblers of the South not generally supposed to exist

 At Grand Junction. Miss, fifty milas rom Memphis, took the train going South on the trunk line leading to New Orleans; sought the sleeping car and was soon in a recumbent posi- ton, curtained in and ready for nights rest.--- Two respectable looking young women, who en. tered the car moment after, seated themselves near my berth and entered promptly into con. versaton with another passenger. Upon learD- ing that he was merchant from New Orleans in the city, and asked him

 Do you know Mir. Powers, of New Orleans?

 Powers Powers pondered the merchant ( What does he do?

 'Gambles,' was the cool response.

 Bless me, no! What do you know about . gambler?'

 Hes my husband answered the undauntsd female with ingenious promptness.

 What. your husband gambler?'

 Yes, sir they are the best men in the world, too'

 ] didn't know they ever married should like to see gamblers wife

 Well, sir, take mighty good look, for you see one now

 So the merchant opened the curtains into their compartment and regarded the speaker with some curosity who was young, rosy and net ill-looking woman, with blue eyes and brown hair, and dressed in plain black silk. The scru- tiny was apparently interesting, for he added:

 I should like to know your husband, ma. dam

 Well, sir, if you've got plenty of money he'll be glad to make your aequantance.'

 Does he ever come homer

 Bless you. yes he deals faro every night till ten o'clock and then always comes home. He has not missed a single night since we were mar. rled--golng on five years. We own a sa""m up near here in this State. and if he does well this year we shall settle on it in the fall and never live in the city again.

 And soon after the voluble matron and her sister retired for the night leaving the merchant somewhat n,ystfed and the writer good deal diverted by the amusing colloquy.

 ""Suddeu death"" the venerable Professor Sill. man used to tell his students, ""is never to be dreaded It is Gods will. Let the angel come in a flash /: only let him find me in the path of dusv. He cannot come too quickly""

 What all exchange from labor to rest !- From incessant toll to blessed enjoyment !- Froa sin. and pain, and sorrow. to holiness and happiness, and rejoicing! From the warfare to the triumph From the battle to the crownE Can the herall of guch tdngs cone too soon -Nsw l'o1k Independent

 Some wags in Middlstown, immediately after the rafing by the Selectnen, procured a CODY summons, ard having some printed, pro."

We publish to-day the first message Of Jen.
Davis to the new rebel Congress, which, like his
recent inaugural betrays great distress Of mind az
to the future fortunes of the csnfederacy, and dis
plays, at the same time, little deviation from the
strict line of truth in reference to the resources of
the South and the conduct Of our government and
our army. He admits that events have proved
that the rebel government attempted more than it
could achieve; that the Southern people had no
idea of the continuance Of the war beyond a
brief period, nor of the overwhelming force
which has been brought against them. To this
fact he attributes the unwillingness of the people
to enlist for long term, but he hopes that tins


fruitful cause Of disaster. short enlistments, win
not again occur. In referring to tho defeats at
Roanoke Island and Fort Donelson, he speaks of
the former as humiliating (Which may be inter-
preted as rebuke to General Wise); and of the
fall of Donelson he says that, in the absence OF
official information, he can form no judgment, but
cannot believe that an army of ""our people"" could
surrendered without an effort to cut their way
through the enemy (Which probably means an
alusion to Floyd and his ignomnious fight. The
strength of the rebel army he puts down, some
what indefinitely, at four hundred regiments of in
fantry, with proportionate cavalry and artillery.
He relies greatly upon the new enlistments to
make up the force Of the army, and expresses
confident opinion that the war is going to last
for several years to come.


Our news from Fortress Monroe, under date of
the 9th, puts in possession of some interesting
information from the South. A meeting of cotton
and tobacco planters was held on Wednesday
evening, at the City Hall, Richmond to discuss
the question of destroying the cotton and tobacco
crops in the State; but the discussion, after a
variety of speeches were delivered pro and con-,
resulted in transferring the matter to COM
mittee for report at an adjourned meeting the
next night, the business Of which has
not yet reached US. resolution was offered
in the rebel Congress on the same day providing
for compensation by the government for all to-
bacco and cotton 80 burned to avoid its falling into
the hands Of the United States government. The
tone Of the Southern press continues to be most
doleful and despairing. The Raleigh IN. CO. Re-
gister of Wednesday says that it would be cri-
minal to deny that the present is the most gloomy
time that the rebel confederacy has experienced
since the commencement of the war. 1t appeals
most strenuously to the people Of the South to
make despArate stand, and to resist to the last.


The Lynchburg Virginsan publishes special
despatch from Bristol Tenn stating that troops

We publish to-day a full report of the speeches

Southern ports, and the effect of the maritime
clauses of the Convention of Paris in time of war
between great naval Powers.


Mr.. Mason, the rebel Commissioner, having stated
to Earl Russell that from six to seven hundred ves
sells entered and left the blockaded ports The Earl
told the House that he had asked Mr.. Mason what
was the tonnage Of the vessels to which allusion
had been made, and to that question Mr.. Mason
,cds unable to gice him any dns,cer That said the
Earl, was matter of great importance in the
question, because the seven ports blockaded were
connected with several other smaller ports and it
was possible that vessels carrying small cargoes
might run from one to the other; but these could
hardy be called ressels running or breaking the
blockade.

mer years the sugar cane crop is doubled in ex-
tent and great attention was being paid to the
cultivation of cotton The prices Of iogwood and
mahogany had advanced, in consequence of
the increased demand for labor in the other
branches of employment. There would be very
large supply Of cotton raised in the colony If sufi

Landing he commanded brigade in General Lew.
Wallace's division, and was highly praised by the
latter for the part he took in the action. He was
nominated for promotion INN, ediately afterward;

The contest for member Of Congress from the ST.

badly bring out q candidate before election. Col.
Blair is pretty certain to be successful; though

knife that John carried in his sleeve. He
watched his opportunity, and before any
one could know what he was at sprung
upon the assassin like catamount. The
officers were too quick for him, though,
and seized his arms, and the prisoner got
only light wound from the great lunge

clinched the poor fellow fast, and got
away his knife, and after the murderer
was safely locked up, all went away from
the Jail.


That afternoon, at two o'clock, short
but affecting funeral service was held, and
the young soldiers mother and sister were
decently in the graveyard. The good
minister took John home with him, but
he was too uneasy to stay long. He
wandered out, and when the next train
Of cars stopped at the station-house, he
got in, little knowing what he was about.
The Conductor, finding he had no money
or ticket, put him off at the next station,
and l saw him hanging about the stable,
as l said. He did not seem TO care
where he went or where he stayed, only
when people drove him out or called him
in, rs the case might be, he just under
stood what it meant, and went as quiet
ly and indifferently one way as the other


The good folks of his own town could
not guess where he was. They were 90
ing to make up purse for him, and were
afraid something had happened to him.
At last they concluded, from something
they heard him say, that he had gone
back 10 the army, but he appeared among
them again that evening. He seemed
more sociable and softened when he be-
gan TO get little over the stun of his
terrible misfortune. He talked good
deal of his mother and sister, and was
just like child about it. ""They were
all rough folks"" he said"" would be call

The kind townspeoplc showed him all
sorts of little attentions, and assured him
again and again that the murderer would
be hung; and finally they did get him to
acknowledge that it was best he shouldn't
have lynched him.


1t was time for the poor soldier to 90
when the seven o'clock train came along
in the morning. A sorrowful furlough
he had of il. He wanted to get back to
the army, he said. Give him fire and
smoke now. They wouldn't catch him

was nothing now for him to leave for
But he carried with him good bundle

No answer; and the inquisitive hostler
gave it ND at last and subsided among
his curry-combs.


Before the close of that day l learned
the namo of the young volunteer who
had deported himself so unsociably at
the stable, and along with the information
came tidings of ghastly crime commit
ted the night before in an adjoining town.
A widow and her daughter, in humble
circumstances, lived some distance from
the central village, and employed an Irish
man to work their little farm for them in
the absence of an only son and brother,
who had gone into the army. The labor
er was supposed to be well-meaniug
man, and no trouble had transpired be-
tween him and his employers; but it
turned out that the women were decoiv-
cd in him.


A person going toward their house on
the night above mentioned, heard piteous
screams proceeding from il, and making
his way to the door as soon as he could,
arrived in time only to find the corpse of
the widow and to see the daughter breathe
her last. The bloody work had been
done with an axe, and the murderer was
gone. The neighbor could find no trace
of his direction, but he evidently could
not be far away, and he hurried to the
nearest house to call assistance for his
pursuit. Before the alarmed inhabitants
reached the lonely house it was on fire,
and in the confusion no well directed at
tempt 10 stop the burning was made till
the building fell. The ruffian had doubt
less set the fire before he committed the
murder.


Early the next morning young man
arrived in the cars at the village, and was
seen to steer directly toward the scene of
the tragedy. People were up uncom-
monty early, he thought, and some that
he met seemed reserved and looked at
him strangely. Everybody knew him
there, and as he came back with his regi-
mcn.als on, why didn't they say, ""Hal-
loo, Johnl glad to see your


Yes, they all knew him. Women
looked out of the windows and cried as
they saw him go by; and rough farmer
men felt choking in the throat as they
""passed the time O duy"" with him, but
hadn't the heart to break him the news
At last tiny boy, going away with some
cows to pasture, called out to him rs he
saw him: ""Somebody's killed your mo
and your sister Jane, and bnrnt yom
house all up.""


Poor John turned dreadfully pale and
stood still, looking at the boy. For q
moment not word was spoken by either
4"" They haint"" shouted the soldier His
voice was so hollow and firm, and his face
looked so strange that the little fellow
was frightened, and trotted away looking
behind him. Poor John went into the
house and found out all about it.


""It is terrible enough, God knows
said he, 4"" but where's the Irishman?""


Oh, how everybody pitied Jobnl They
set victuals before him, and he tried tc
eat. Nobody knew what to say to him.
and so nobody said anything 10 him, but
they all did for him as if he had been q
near kin. At least he broke down and
cried like baby, and the women all gath
cred round and cried with him. 1t did
him good, and after it he felt equal to the
sad task of viewing the ruins of his old
home and taking look at the mangled
remains Of the only relatives he had.-
He staggered rs he wandered over the
familiar house-spot, for old thoughts and
ineffable regrets swept over his heart like
whirlwind. He could not stand il
there, and SO hurried away. ""Some.
body's killed your ma and your sister
Jane and burnt the house all upp'


They caught the miserable murderer
before noon, and a'great crowd gathered
to see him lodged in Jail. Some called
out TO ""lynch him."" but there we're moi

REBEL MOVEMENTS.","CAIRO, Nov. 1,","CAIRO, Nov. /.


Corinth dispatches of yesterday say that the
mail messenger came in there to-day from
Chevalle, and reports that-our scouts had
secured the country as far south as Ripley but
discovered no trace of the enemy.


In Memphis orders have been issued by
Gen. Sherman, that all steamers with cotton
and other merchandise shall be conveyed by
gunboats, upon proper notification at Cairo or
Memphis.


We have rumor by way of Corinth that
Mobile is ours. The report was brought in by
rebel prisoners taken by our scouts.


Memphis letter says Villipique's brigade
has moved from Holley Spring.


There is conflict of authority between the
rebel generals in Mississippi. Pemberton was
sent to the command of that department on
presumption that Van Dorm would be in Ten
nessee or Kentucky, but the battle at Corinth
prevented this, and now Van Dorm refuses to
come under and acknowledge his authority,


The Lynchburg Republican of the 24th says
the eonstitutionality of the conscription act
will be tested in the Court of Appeals in Vir-
ginia. The case is made up by the Confede-
rate States authorities


The Petersburg Express learns that there
was fighting at Franklin on Sunday, and the
confederates were driven back


1t has good reason for believing that the
army is this side of Black river.


The only news from Tennessee is that on
Friday night our pickets were driven in at
Chevalle. This is thought, however, to ind-
cate reconnaissance rather than an attack on
our force. The rebels seem to be coming up
by way Of Grand Junction and thus be in
position to menace both Bolivar and Cornth.
1t is barely possible that they have not enough
men to make an attack, but have pushed their
column on in a threatening manner in order
to gain time at Holly Springs and other points
south.


The Grenada Appeal says that the rebel
Generals Jackson, Longstreat, Polk, Hardee,
Pemberton, Kirby Smith and Holmes have been
promoted TO Lieut.. Generals."

SEVERE AccIDENT.-Yesternay morning
about 10 o'clock, Mr.. Stetson Palmer, of Cape
Elizabeth, while at work in the ship yard
handling broad axe, cut his foot severely
from the toes nearly to the ankle. Dr. Lamb
dressed the wound.


THE RIGHT SPIRIT.-A gentleman in this
city who had frequently refused his son per-
mission to enlist, even under bounty of S246,-
90, generously offered his services for the
Zouave Battalion, about to be formed, saying
that he should rather have him 60 for one
dallar than for five hundred.


-The members of the City Government
held an informal meeting last evening, quo
rum of Aldermen not being present, at which
1t was decided that bounty Of S2n,00 would
be given each enisting recruit, and it was
further intimated that the city would become
responsible for the amount expended towards
the uniforms and equipments of the Zouave
Battalion.


Academia young man named Robert
Mccullough Wilcox, connected with Fet's
establishment on Exchange street, while sit
ting upon a window sill in the I'd story of the
store on Wednesday night, fell to the sidewalk
below, injuring him severely on the head, and
suffering other severe contusions of the body.
We are happy to learn that no immediate dam
ger is to be apprehended.


A SLIPPERY FELLow.-with all of the
wariness for which our police are celebrated,
still, an adroit fellow will now and then ""do""
for them. One Of our sharpest experts in the
line of rogue catching, was handsomely baulk-
ed, yesterday afternoon by cunning fellow
ofthe slippery eel specie. The officer suppos-
ed him to be safe enough, and, having occa-
sion to use his handkerchief, but turned away
for second, when upon another inspection,
the ""artful dodger"" wasn't there, and upon
looking again, he was in the same place. Tu-
key No. 2, was not to be thus despoiled of his
game, and slashing about for while discov-
cred the bird, and finally drew him into the

day was meagre. A Civilian who has arrived
at Poolesville, Ind, from Richmond the 18th,
says that at Gordonsville there were not more
than six or seven regiments. A heavy force
could be seen camping and bivouacing on the
hills, stretching to the north east in the direc-
ton of Orange Court House.


The narrator stopped ten hours in Gordons-
vile, and during that time saw not less than
ten trains arrive on the Central railroad from
the south and the Charlottesville railroad from
Lynchburg-those from Richmond bringing
troops and those from Lynchburg both troops
and supplies.


He, Judging from what he saw, says that the
whole Confederate army i'm Virginia is by this
time in positions on the Virginia Central rail-
road, and that it numbers 250,000 men.


Stonewall jackson was said TO have left
Gordsonville, but none know his whereabouts.
This looks as If they contemplated a flank
movement against Gen. Pope's right, and if
so, 1t will probably be led by Jackson.

 There was heavy snow storm at Richmond on Monday night This morning the streets were slippery. It is sleeting to>night.

Health of the command has greatly nm proved, and large accessions have been mace | by convalescents returning to duty. A snow, hail and rain storm had prevailed tor elght days, accompanied by heavy wind.

In Congress, nothing was done oi public character. Dispatches from Norfolk to- night report that the troubles iii Lincons cabi- ret are eliminating.

Ne,cs from General Less Armv-Eectire Condition of his
Troops-Eaa1lsshmsH of -Four Depos of army Sup
plies, Gc., dc.


During the last week have collected great ma ny i'm.
portan facts in regard to the movements Of General Lee
Winchester They all indicate that General Lee is
confident p the strength Of his position and has In.
tenion Of leaving IT, and that he will remain there at
least until winter in unless attacked by the Union
army before that time In regard 10 his ability TO with
stand such attack the following facts psrtinent


After the conscrption act had gone ns operation and
the rebel troops had been raised IT, the whole rebel
army reorganized Nearly all OF tho old regiments
had distinguished the selves in the various battles
the organization OF these regiments carefully pre-
served Their ranks however like those Of our old eg
ments had been fcarully thnned by the various casu
aies or war and many Of them reduced from 900
to 500, and in some cases to 800 men. Instead OF
consolidating these regiments, and thus blottng from
existence the name and memory OF many regiments
which had acquired certain reputation in the field, the
plan Of General Lee described my letter Of July 25
has been universally adopted. That is, the now con
scripts TO n up the old regiments and
the Consequence is that by this time nearly all the old
regiments restored to their original
strength This especially the with tho regiments
composing the rebel army Winchester In addition





effective strength has been gradually and steadily in
creased during the last four weeks by reinorcemens Of
old regiments, which not under his orders the
battle OF Antietam, but which. snce that time, havo
been drawn from other points His elective strength
.woek ago to-day fuzzy l3o, 900 troops.


During the last month the rebel government has
established four immense depols Of army supplies in
virginia--namely, at Lynchburg, at Burkesvile, at
Gordonevic and at Staunton The nrst two





are for tho immediate supply Of General Lees
army and filed and empted every few days The de
pots at Lynchburg and Burkesvlle used for the
Of bales Of Blankets wooen clothing and other
articles Of that description, which, being Of foreign ma
nufacturs, have been brought vessels
that tho blockade In these storehouscs, too,
quantities Of ssIled meat, -four, beans and
OATS brought from Kentucky and Tennessee Several Of
tho large buildings formerly used for tobacco warehouses
are now entirely filed with these commodities The de-
pots Gordonsville and Stanton also contain smaller
quantities Of these articles but they are principally used
for storage Of the gran fruit and other productions
Of tho rich and fertile Shenandoah valley which have
been pouring into them during the last weeks. At
these places, also, there immense herds Of cattle
which have been collected in the valley. The valley,
hsweyer, has been BY drained OF its produc-
,ions AT Stanton Georgetown Fureyown, Harrisburg
and several other places, the names Of which forget
there are smaller depots Of supplies Of the persha
BILE articles which forwarded TO the army, Win
chester, as they are needed.


Tho engineer department OF the rebel army has been
actively employed for month past In improving the roads
leading from Steunion, Gordonsvile and Cupcpper to
Winchester. An the coDscrpts are compelled 10 work
from two O'Clock the afternoon Till dark these roads
The rest OF the time they kept dril. or these
roads there three principal The from Saun
ton runs through Hsrrsonburg and Stasburg the Que
from Gordonsve thsough Barboursville Madison,
ruay and Royal and the from Culpepper
in nearly straight line through Front Royal TO winehes
tor All these roads In splendid order and
kept so by constant attention. They all occupied by
the passage OF teams taking supplies OF food
blankets and clothing tho rebel army. General Lee
should retreat to Richmond these roads would afford him
every needed facility Tor doing SO with rapidly But
such does not seem 10 be his design.


There are sick wounded soiiors In any oil General
Lees camps All such sent South as soon as they
became disabled since the battle Of AntIeam hundreds
az ,bern have been restored heath and have reoned
their regments but there are still several thousand at
the great hospital at charlot'ssviie'


n In stated that there will bo no lack or blankets OF
comfortable w,n.or clothing this winter In the rebel
my and that ali OF Gen. Lees soldiers either have or are
now receiving these articles II this statement is true
and there is every TO believe ithey better
on than tho soldiers Of the Army Of tho Potomac.

on the Island is supposed 10 have been over
5000, nearly all of whom were killed or
taken prisoners. One report says seventy,
and another that only twenty-five escaped
Gen. Huger teIegraphed TO Richmond that
Gfty escaped. Gen. Wise had command
At Nays Head, aud when bis situation be-
came dangerous he was removed to Norfolk.
The news Of the defeat caused great excite.
ment at Norfolk, the previous news having
been satisfactory. The inhabitants had been
made to believe that the Yankees were al
lowed to advance for the purpose Of draw
ing them into trap.


The Richmond Examiner says TIE loss OF
the entire army on Roanoke is the most
painful event Of the war. and adds:


The intelligence Of yesterday by telegraph is
fully confirmed. Twenty-Five hundred brave
troops were exposed to the entire force OF bnrn-
side: these replied with determined courage, but
retreat being cut off by the surrounding
elements they were compelled to surrender


The following dispatches on the subject,
dated at Norfolk, February 10Th, are from
the Richmond papers:


Latest news states that o. Jennings Wise
was shot through the thigh; the wound is not
mortal. About 300 Confederates were killed.
The wounded number over 900. The Yankee
wounded are about the same. late arrival
this morning says the enemy are pushing on to
Edenton.


A second diapatch says: A rumor prevails
that Commodore Lynch's feet Of gunboats had
been captured. 1t is not regarded, however, as
true. 1t is believed that all were burned 6y the
Confederates to prevent their capture with the
exception of one which was endeavoring to es-
cape.


A third dispatch says: A courier arrived at
Richmond yesterday and brought the inte Iii
gence that Elizabeth City was burned by the
inhabitants. During the conhagration, the
Federals landed large force.


The following. from the Norfolk Day
Book, is the very latest:


A courier arrived here yesterday afternoon,
| from whom we gather the following The enc
my advanced in full force upon Elizabeth city
yesterday about 7 o'clock, and began the attack.
The citizens finding resistance in vain eVacua-
ted the place; before doing so they set fire to the
town which was burning when he left. We'have
also to record the capture by the enemy of all
our little feet except one boat which eluded the
enemy. She was pursued andfears are enter
tanned that she was captured. The disaster to
our little feet is attributed to the fact that hav-
ing exhausted their supplies of coal and ammu-
milton, they proceededto Elizabeth city, for the
purpose of obtaining a supply; every effort was
made to obtain it,, but without success. The
boats could not therefore return to the Island
to lend assistance to the troops there.
The courier represents our loss at three hum
dred killed and wounded-and that of the en-
emy not less than 900; great havoc was made
in their ranks. While coming up the road lead-
ing to the fort, our soldiers brought TO bear on
them two 32-pounders, at every fire their ranks
were terribly thinned. The places of the fallen
we're however quickly filled


A dispatch from Fortress Monroe, of
February 18th, says:


1t is reported that one Of the Massachusetts
regiments was badly cut up at Roanoke Island,
but it is impossible to say which. All the Sou
thern papers received here today are unanimous
in admitting the complete victory for our





is very serious one. The news occasions great
excitement at Old Point. A steamer with Off
oial dispatches from Gen. Burnsides is hourly
expected. The Prisoners captured, numbering
at least 1000 will be here in a few days.


The foregoing account OF the fight and
capture OF the Island is derived exclusively
from rebel sources. The Federal account
will be found in our telegraphic column,
aRd il will be observed that there is wide
difference in regard to the losses. The reb
els are not in the habit of exaggerating
their own losses, but they have undoubted-
ly done so in this case, in regard to the
number Of their killed. The Federal esti-
mate of the losses is, of course, the more
reliable. Nearly the entire rebel army was
capturedi and the City or sixty fugitives
that escaped would have very indefinite
idea of the number killed and wounded."

The abolition journals within the last few
days have been circulating all sorts of stories
about di8erenees of opinion between General
Mcclellan Oh one side, and the new Secretary
OF War and the President on the other. One OF
these statements is that General Mcclellan has
been deprived of his position as Commander-in-
Chief OF the srmy, and placed on level with
Haileck, Buell., Butler, Sherman and other
generals commanding departments or expedi-
tions that hereafter all orders, public and pri
vate, to the generals Of the army, will be issued
by the Secretary of War; and that ="" the adj
ministration Of the war has already got q
policy"" as if it never had any before. So says
the Tribune of Saturday last; and in double
loaded leader, with the caption, eft Moves at
Last"" that journal announces, with tremen-
dous flourish ="" Victory and omens of victory
attend the assumption by President Lincoln Of
his constitutional functions as Commander-in-
Chief of the army and navy. The country was
thrilled yesterday not only by the announce
ment of most important triumph in North
western Tennessee, but by the indications of
new vitality and more active spirit along the
whole enormous line of operations A few
more events such as the capture of Fort Henry,
and the war will be substantially at an end""
The meaning of this Is that if General McClel-
Ian had not been deposed, and the President
and his Secretary of War assumed their proper
functions, there would be no victory at Fort
Henry; but now ""it moves at last!"" Has it
not been moving from the beginning as fast as
prudence and good generalship would per-
NIT {? Did it not move at Hatteras, at
Port Royal and at Mill Spring, as well as at
Fort Henry? The truth is that the victory ON
the Tennessee is as much the result of General
McClellan's comprehensive plan as any other
victory that has been won, as much as his own
victories at Rich Mountain and other parts of
Western Virginia, by which he cleared that
section of the State of the rebels and restored
it to the Union-a brilliant feat of general
ship, which at once commended him to the at
tention Of the country and the government
as the man most worthy to take the chief COM
mand of the army. His plan now is to make
| the same sure work of the rebellion further
South as he goes along. McClellan's victories
| are valuable from their results A victory





little or nothing, though twenty thousand of
| the enemy were destroyed.


| The truth is that the President is slandered
by the Tribune, and he has never abdicated
| the functions which the constitution assigns
him as Commander-in- Chief of the army and
| navy, nor has he now assumed any new au-
thority. The same may be said of Secretary
Aoo L. l,,c
adopted the admirable plans of General
Mcclellan, and by his energy has carried them
out. In the Mexican campaign General Scott
was Commander-in-chief and yet he received
his orders from the War Department. There
never has been any difference of opinion
between General Mcclellan and the Presi-
dent or Secretary Stanton. There has been
and now is the most perfect accord be-
tween General Mcclellan, the practical Com
mander-in-Chief of the army, and the Presi-
dent, the legal Commander-in-Chief, and his
Secretary of War. Neither Mr.. Lincoln nor
Mr.. Stanton is a military man, and it is no dis
respect to them to say they would be arrant
fools if they attempted to dictate the strategical
operations Of the army or regulate the details of
the campaign. But when plan is presented to
them by an able general, they have the dis
cernment to appreciate it. When Columbus
made the egg stand everybody saw how he did
| it, and could then do the same thing.


The successes of our arms prove the wisdom
of McClellan's plans. The victories at Hatteras
and Port Royal have been attended with the
best effects, spreading terror and CONSERVATION

out all rebeldom. The Burnside expedition
| is now striking another blow which will
tell for the Union. The occupation of Port
Royal would have been followed ere this with
more important results but for the premature
publication of the plans Of Commodore Dupont
by the very journals which have been all along
complaining of inaction, and continually shout
ing ""On to Richmond"" ""On to Charleston
'On to Savannah ""On to New Orleans."" The
victory at Mill Spring, besides resulting in
the death of an active and formidable rebel
general, with the defeat and rout of his army,
has given the Union forces the key which opens
East Tennessee even to Knoxville, and will
enable them 10 seize and break up the railroad
communication between Lynchburg and Nash
vile, thus cutting off the army in Virginia from
supplies, reinforcements and communication
with the South by that route; while the more
recent capture of Fort Henry opens the free
communication of the Tennessee river to our
troops to West Tennessee, places them in pos
session of the Memphis and Ohio Railroad, ten
miles beyond, by which Bowling Green is con.
nected with Memphis and with Columbus
and each Of these strong positions, thus
severed, can be assailed separately by our
combined forces in the rear. There can
be little doubt that Fort Donelson, on the
Cumberland, few miles southeast of Fort
Henry, is by this time in possession of our
troops; and, as all know, up the Cumberland is
the way to Nashville. Thus are East and West
Tennessee penetrated at the same time, and"

 A letter, dated Norfolk, the 18th ult., to the Petersburgh Express, says:

 ""Certain parties were arrested at the Navy Yard on Monday, with candles, matches, and oth CT inhammable and combustible materials on theil persons, with intent, as is rationaly supposed, tc fire the yard, or, at least, the big ship lHerrimac They have been committed to jail. and if Jack Ketch does not get his owa this time, then let all law, all order, all justice: go to the dogs"" The Lynchburg Republican says:

 ""Our people were greatly surprised, on satur- day morning, to see the black flag"" waving ove, the depot of the Virginia and Tennessee Rail road Company.

 The Richmond Dispatcb of recent date warns the Southern people against false security aris. ing from the prospect of English interference, which it regards probable but still thinks there IS possibility that the Southern Confederacy will have to fight without friends.

Our statistical friend, Mr.. De Bow, whose

sus Reports did not give the world very lofty

opinion of his ingenuity, announces with some
flourish that blacking and lucilcr match factory
has been established in Lynchburg, and that
North Carolina has engaged in the production OF

voice jubilautly in respect Of eight tan-yaIds ID

know ina. there is a considerable dcmand even in
the Rebel States ior Northern Shoes, about this
| time. Mind We do not say iba. there is any
supply--we only say that there il demand.


! But let Us 20 back TO De Bow. In lis
whole elaborate lst, we only find one manuiaciory
of powder On Charlotte County, Va, which is
turning out 900 lbs. per diem-nO very enor


nous amount 10 supply - considerable army for Il
vigorous campaign. Besides, here the iallncy Of
the De Bow computations is lamentaby eIpqsed
in general. One hundred thousand pounds Of
gunpowder, myriads Of bowie-kniyes, mile long
aud mile wide parks Of artillery uuuumberable
camp.stool. and millions of bushel, OF tent-pins,
add nothing, either in times OF war or Of peace,
TO the actual wealth of a country. Nothing 20
adds, which is manufactured simply that il may
be almost simultaneously destroyed. Once more,
We must call the attention of our readers TO re-
petition of the fact that physically and materially
considered, war is waste The pound OF powder
which is blown from u gun is gone forever, and
can never, b. any possibility, be pound Of pow
der again. The shell which bursts, may XIII a
dozen Of tlc cnemy-Abut that is tho end Of tit

many Of ia departments, works over aud over
again the same maleyials-such as rags, iron, etc.


etc. But tins Is not true Of the materials of war;


or is 20 only IN 4 very limited sense. Hence, any
prolonged military struggle requires both capital
and i continual reproduction OF original material
War works with double mischief 1t produces
/ less and it consumes more than peace. Mr.. De
} Bows, who is not tic most profound of economists,
mistakes a petty, spamodc production for u
steady snpply sustained by capital increased or
und.minished lie is { the eat-yOur- -cake-aud-
nayc-t school, which ism I the most accurate in

Wise used 10 say desparingly to his lazy Yir-
/ gifian planters: "" Don't you see that if you

better oil, you aud your niggerpj and, if You
90 raise 50O0O0,OO0 bushels, you viii be still bet

complaceuty cOntented with the discovery that it
wanted Somethiug-it has rarely gone TO the Ia
borious length oi supplying itself. II has fell the
want which has palsied tie production of many
people much more deseryiug-the want OF inte-
gent and well remunerated labor. Human beings
considered simply as capital, with no reference TO
their human rights, with no regard for the rule Of
Gods own express enactment, that the LabOrer is
Worthy of lis Hre-human beings, held as horses

suspense, learned something definite of the
Whereabouts Of Burnside and his feet of gun
boats. Capt. Salyer, in command of the
steamer Johnston, went down the other day to
Portsmouth and Ocracoke on business and to
reconnoitre, and leaving there late Thursday
evening arrived here early yesterday morning
and reports positively that 40 gun-boats and
sailing vessels were in the harbor at Hatteras.
He did not sec the feet himself but fell in with
. gentleman who came up with him, whose
name we do not recollect, ebut, who, he says,
is reliable, from whom he received the above
intelligence, he having seen and counted the
vessels himself He also states that the fleet
has been assembling there for the last week
This is. nostreet rumor and gives intelligence
of something having show of tangibility, but
whethen the feet neatly intends to come in this
direction or is intendid for the canal, or wheth-
or it has merely run in the harbor at Hatteras
to axoia the stormy weather, all remains in the
region Of conjecture. We confess, we have
never believe until now that the expedition
was intendid, seriously, to menace this place,
but really it begins to look now like that our
time had come and we feel that this is a time
for all hands to put their shoulder to the
wheel and make one resolute push. The
truth is, it won't do to let them come here, and
4 every man in Craven county will determine
that they shall only come over his dead body,
they never will come for preventit.


When the fleet comes up, of course it will
move cautiously when within ten or fifteen
miles of this place, and the channel being mar
row, they will have to come in regular Indian
Ale, thus giving our sharp shooters fine opor
tunity. with long range rifles, to hover along
the margin of the river for fifteen or twenty
miles down andpick off the pilots and others
who may show their heads above deck like
shooting black birds in a snow storm. By
all means, let every man be wide awake and
duly sober and let us offer resistance that
shall fully sustain the high reputation hitherto
enjoyed by North Carolinians for noble deeds
Of daring and answering bravery. In a
word, let every man resolve in the strength oi
his God to resist to the death and never yield
axccpt when the earth shall have drunk in his
hearts blood.


By the way, where is our feet of gun-boats
under Commodore Lynch? 1t has been re-
ported here that the flagship ""Seabrd has
been captured by the Yankees, and really ii
would seem that they had all been captured
or gone off on spree for we have not seen or
heard anything from them for two or three
weeks, except the time Capt. Hunter saw 80
gun-boats in Pamlico Sound sometime ago and
got shot at. 1t looks strange to us that at
least one of them is not Kept on our river tc
communicate intelligence Of any movement OF
the part of the enemy. In other words, what
is our feet for fit is not to cooperate with US
in orr efforts to ward off water attack."

ft.rf Wdshington 0ct 0, 1852.


Among the arrivals today is Captain F, q.
Young, direct from Richmond, having left that
city on Tuesday by flag Of truce down the
James river. He, with Major W. G. Barney,
Of New York, was captured on the 2lst Of
September, while on horseback tour in the
vicinity Of BuH run, by the Thrteih Virginia
cavalry, under Col. Chambless, a graduate Of
West Point.


The prisoners spent four days pleasantly on
the way 10 Redmond, and were treated kindly
and Hospitality by their captors and by all
whom they met on the route.


The c.valry regiment of Colonel Chambloss
was handsomely mounted and uniformed and
fully equipped.


There appeared 70 be an abundance Of salt,
-four, fresh beef and shoes among the soldiers.


Good discipline among the rebel troops.
They treated each other with great kindness.
and courtesy. No whiskey drinking or card
playing was allowed among them.
Much comment is made BY the rebel troops
as to the careless manner in which our dead
were buried On the plans of Manassas.


The country districts are exhausted Of food
for man and least, aud in consequence appre.
tensions exls, Of great distress among the peo-
pie during the coming year.


Everybody has plenty Of paper money of all
descriptions and denominations.


The eatment of Union prisoners at the
Libby plison has been changed for the better,
and i,vse confined with Captain Young had No
cause to COMPLAIN He and thirty others were
put in large, cool, pleasant room. and were
nlrd Uy the guards and servants with
marked kindness. Raiiohs were served regu
| lary and suller was constantly present, Th.
| norniag papers were served at daylight.
Colonel daniel U1iman and Lieutenant Col
Brown, Of New York regiments, and abou
seven hundred others, arrived at Annapolis
TO- day, having left Richmond on Tuesday morn
ing #..


The rebel troops are rapidly receiving thei
new uniforms, consisting Of dark grey wooleI
jackets and light blue pants, &c. They say
there is no lack Of arms, and that they hav,
more cannon than be used.


The general impression among them is tha
the war will not end uni the expiration 0
President Lncoln's term Of Office. y Y


Everybody, however, is sick Of hostlities
and the troops desire TO rctarn tc their homes
yet one constantly hears the remark, ""Yol

Letters received in Augusta Ca, from Savan-
nah on Tuesday, state that heavy firing was heard
on Monday in the direction of New river, on the
South Carolina side of the city which lasted over
four hours. Information reached Augusta the
same day by person who stated that he heard
from rebel officer in Savannah that the batteries
on New river had been attacked by some Union
gunboats, one of which had been destroyed. The





was of Red Bluff, and that the enemy had destroy
ed several houses in that vicinity.


The arrival of the >As-o<vas SayannsA&A this
port from Pert Royal yesterday may throw some
light on this reported attack. The Savannah left
on the 30th ut.. and she reports that formidable
expedition including all the light draught vessels
several gunboats and large land force had sailed
from Port Royal for the South on the 26th. Their
destination WAS not stated, but it is highly proba.

General Beauregard arrived in Nashville on the

The War Department received information yes.
terdey that the rebels had evacuated Romney
Western Virginia, and that General Lander now
occupied it with our troops. This is another good
strategic point gained.


1t will be seen by our extracts from the South
ern papers that the rebel leaders are devoting
much attention to the subject of new railroads
JEFF Davis recommended to Congress in secret
session the completion of the Mississippi and Ala
bama road, so as to connect Selma, Alabama, with
Merdien, in Mississippi and Congress proposed
to appropriate $500 for that purpose. The
New Orleans Picayune also notices the fact that
the road from Mobile to New Orleans, via Jackson
and Meridien, has been complete, and remarks that
it is most opportune, as ""the Yankees"" have pos
session of the Sound, and may destroy the coast
line at any moment. million of dollars, it is
said, has been estimated by Mr.. Davis to construct
railroad between Danville, Va, and Greensboro,
N. c., as matter of military necessity.


We are informed that letter has been received
at Albany by Senator from Thurlow Weed,
dated in Paris, January 81, stating that the En-
peror Napoleon would announce to the Corps
Legis,at1, on the 9th ult., his intention to in
terfere with the affairs of this country While this
is not very definite, yet we may find
some possible ground for the rumor in q fact
which we give to-day from rebel sources at Nor.
folk. 1t appears that gentleman claiming to be
a French citizen, resident in Wilmington, N. c.,
has just arrived at Norfolk from Fortress Monroe,
under flag Of truce. This person, NJ De Behan,
the report says, ""was arrested last summer at the
North and confined in Fort Lafayette. Through
the interference of the French Minister he was re-
leased but he was refused permission to return to

to Europe, and obtained it; but Mr.. Seward en-
dorsed on it, IT is understood N. De Behan is not
to enter into any of the insurrectionary States
He went to Paris and had an interview with the
Emperor Napoleon, and showed him Mr.. Sew
ards endorsement on his passport. The Emperor
promptly replied that he should be allowed to re-
turn to his place Of business The French Minister
of Foreign Affairs prepared the necessary papers
for the French Minister at Washington, and Mr..
De Babian returned to the I cd States. He
called on Mr.. Seward for passport to enable him
to return to Wilmington, but he was refused it.
On the next day the French Minister called on Mr..
Seward, exhibited some documents, and asked for
passport for Mr.. De Babian to return to Will
mington, and Mr.. Seward very cheerfuIly granted
it..


This story may probably have some connection
with Mr.. Weeds statement.

The suLjOined letter from a worthy and in,
tsIlgent lrieh citizen Of Minnesota, addressst
to Major General Hunter, Is deserving of con
sid'r ration from ;ls prRcticability and clear
ness Of It's snggestions. It certainly offers thu
readiGst means Of arming such negroes as Il
may, after the lst of next January. be con
sidsred advisable to enroll 10 the service of ths
United States, or to assist with the means ol
asserting tasir osn h2elos, The letter Is as
follows:


WABAsHAw CRY, MINI. Sept. ., 1863.


MAJOR GENERAL HuNTER-Dsar Gene, al :
Knowing the esteem In which you are held by
all my countrymen In the United States, and
how kal!antly you led the cid Sixty ninth
when 'Irish blood lrSt Teddened the turf in
onr present war, 7 take the liberty Of giving
You an Irishman's opinion as TO the Kind Of
implements that ought to be used in the pres
eni crisis by the negroes, Gha.ld they ever be
armed, in place Of guns.


ln Ireland. we have had much experience In
the work Of suddenly armng. and with de q.
cient means, a population not trained 10 arms
aud With nothing but courage for their defcnc .
Sor such troops, the best weapon-ths ""qusen
Of weapona,"" ss John MITCHELL and Thomas
Davis used to say-is the pike, and ] am sure
Col. Corcoran will give like opinion.


Let the pike. be OF hickory or OAK
at least nine feet long-a littls stronger than a
hoe handle, lani the negroes are pretty well
drilled In handling tho hoo airesdy.) These
piksmsn should advance Immediately In the
rear of line of men with muskets, or With
mnsketeers aanking them 90 right and left
The moment the musketesrs are within chGrg
ing distance, they fire and slip to The rear be
tween the ranks of the pikemen, who then rush
forward, with yell, to the order Charge -
Nv troOps On earth, least of all those OF the
Confsderacy."" could regist, or even stand
charge Of such death Implements in tho hands
Of bondmen striking for freedom and well sup
ported by other troops


When was boy, In Ireland, heard from
tha mouth of men who fought In King George 3
army In the sorrowful times OF '9s, that ths y
always had to fly for their liVes before the pike
men came too near them for that neither horse
men nor footmen could stand before brist.
ling line Of pixies at least nine feet long, car
ried In the hands Of desperate men, rushing
forward with detsrDination that only death
should stop them They tried grape On the pike
men, then musketry; but these failing, they
always broke and ran.


And now, General may the good God blsss
you for your kindness 10 Irishmsn, and your
courage in the cause His blessing accompany
you and be around you 10 the day OF battle
waking and sleeping, wherever you go, what
ever you may be doing May God give you
wisdom and knowledge, and may you have life
and prosperity after every rebel has been
swept out Of existence.


This is the prayer Of your hNmble servant,

After manv days silence the Overland Tel
egraph has again got in working order,
and we are enabled to give our readers news
up to last Wednesday, the 25th inst. 1t
will be remembered that the battle of Fair
Oaks took place on Sunday the 3lst Of May
and Monday June lst and we have been ever
since anxiousy awaiting the truthful results
of the battle. AS now reported, we find
that the Federal loss was 500 killed, 1917
missing. and 627 wounded.


On the 9Th inst there was battle near
Harrsonburg lat Cross Keys,) between the
rebel forces under Jackson, and the Fe,lerals
under Gen. Mlroy. The Federas were repul
with a heavy loss, stated to be l50 killed
and 500 wounded.


On the same day. a cordng to the dis
patches. Monday, June 8lh, at Port Repub
lie, Gen Shields advance of 600 was
opened upon by 90 pieces of artillery by the
enemy. Our iroOls We're compelled To fall
back three or four miles The engagement
lased four hours. The force engaged were
regiments who fought braveIy an enemy
more than five times their number Tor four
hours, and then relreatcd in order, with he
exception of one or two regiments which
were surrounded and hal to take to the
mountains. The 1th Indiana, which left
Ere !rck>burg 500 strong. numbered bat
500 after the fight The Twenty ninth and
Thirty sixth Ohio also lost heavily.


The Washington Star of the | llh speak
ing of Jacks""n's attack on Shields, saws i'm
media,eIy after il he resumed his retreat,
and quit the road to Stanton. Port Repub
lie bridge in the rear, was destroyed, thus
for time putting an etfectual stop ,opur
suit. He is evidently retreating immediate
"" on Charlottesville, where he will probably
make stand, for the purpose of saving the
Lynchburg and tennessee railroad connec.
ton.


June 9th.-A camp for $4,000 for instruc
ton is TO be formed at Annapolis, Maryland


The Memphis Argus of the 9th gives an
account of the naval engagement before the
city, says:


""The loss of the enemy, other than the
damage to one ram, is not known. Their
boats were altogether superior to ours, and
therefore sustained but little injury. The
loss OF life cannot be ascertained with any
degree OF accuracy. The cannonadng, we
persume killed but few. A number are
known to have fallen by the enemy's sharp
number went down with the sinking vessels.
During the engagement the bluffs in front
of the city were crowded with spectators.
Not less than 5000 persons witnessed it.
Many ladies were seen with tears trickIing
kown their cheeks as they were humiated
at the triumphs of the Federals.""


There have been numerous fights in diffe.
rent parts of the South. Beauregard is re
ported to be with his troops at Columbus,
Miss; another report has him at Richmond
second in command Of the rebel forces. A
great battle is soon expected at that place
The rebels are reported 100000 strong.


Congress has passed the Pacific Railroad
Bill, and it no doubt will become law


The New Orleans papers of the II inst
state there is no yellw fever in that city.


Pres lent Lincoln has opposed the aboli.
ton bill prohibiting slavery in the Terrific
ries White river, Arkansas, is now open
up to Jacksonport.


Fort Morgan, one of the defenses of Mo,
bile, is reported to have been taken by the
U. S. gunboats.


Gen. Curtis has not yet advanced to Little
Rock, Arkansas. Gov. Rector has called
out the whole force of the State to defend
it.


WASHINGTON, June llth.


A dispatch from McClellan's army, dated
Saturday night says: ""The rebels yesterday,
after driving our pickets from Old Church,
went to Garrick's Landing, on Pamunky riv.
er, four miles above White House, where
they burned two schooners and some wag
ons. Thence they proceeded to Tunstall's
station with a view of burning the railroad
bridge. A train which was passing at the
time was fired into and several persons kill.
and wounded. After destroying the tele
graph line they returned to Richmond. The
Federal feet still remains inactive at City
Point, 25 miles belaw Richmond.


A terrific engagement has taken place"

 In nothing has southern enterprise more strongly manifested itself than in the produc- ton of leather and articles manufactured from it. Tanneries have been started and old ones enlarged; new processes of tanning are in vogue carefully preserves the skins of all animals, wild or tame. The government has succeeded in getting ample supply of shoes for the army. At Atlanta, and perhaps other places, they have steam tannery, and at New Orleans, con- federate leather manufactory and shoe estab lishment, employing several hundred hands, Texas can supply 8 great amount of leather, and we learn that the people there are awake to the importance of this branch ot manufactures.

 Harry Mccarthy is in Alabama playing to fine houses. Mrs Pennoyar is at the Memphis theatre.

 Fort Henry is ninety miles from Paducah. Fort Doneson, on the Cumberland river, is thirteen miles from Fort Henry. The latter Is twenty miles below the long bridge across the Tennessee, which the federas are said to be in possession Of.

 The Daily Delta of the 2:th ut., says that the steamer Natchez brought 300 bales of cotton to New Orleans on the morning of that day We thought that the bringing of cotton to that port was prohibited.

 At a sale in Washington of horses purchased by army agents and condemned, some of them sold as low as one dollar head.

 There has been great flood in the Ohio river. On the 2lst ult., tue Cincinnati papers reported 53 feet water in the channel and rising.

 The Kentucky tories are beginning to reap the fatal fruits of unionism. At Frankfort, some forty or sixty negroes paraded the streets at night, singing political songs and shouting for Lincoln. In Henry county they have burnt barns and committed other outra3es. In the same county party of slaves loaded wagons and leisurely marched into Indiana. When .l,. J,I ti, hoosiers told them that they could not arrest the slaves, and ordered them to leave or be lynched. Served them right.

 The Kentucky congressman elect, are as follows; lst district, Alfred Boyd; 2d, John "", Crockett; 3d, II. F. Read; 4th, Geo. "". Ewing; 5th, J. s. Chrsman; 6th I. L. Burnett; 7th, H. "". Bruce; 8th, s. S. Scott; 9th, E. M Bruce; 10th, J, W. Moore; llth, Robert J. Brockinridge Eth, J. NJ. Elliott

 IL would be amusing, if q person had time, to collate the contradictions and qualifications of the North during the war. The absurdity of refusing to recognize us as bellgere its, yet ac knowledgng the ranks of our military officers; the refusnal to acknowledge an exchange of prisoners, yet the release of ours when we re- leased theirs; the declaration that the ports Of the South are theirs and then the pretended estab- ment of blockade as of the ports of all enemy; and the claiming jurisdiction over a country where one of their military or ci1 officers dare not show his face. One paper tells us that the negroes pant for freedom, and urges the putting of arms in their hands whercwith to kill their masters. Next day it assures its readers that at the battle of Bethel, there was regiment of negroes who killed the Lincolnites and forced them to run. One of their speakers grows iachrymoSe over the sorrows of Cuflee and swears he must be freed, while another soemny declares that Cuffee comes within their lines, finds out their secrets and returns to his master Buell. takes an extra quantity of arms to be placed in the hands of liberated slaves who he says, are ready to fight for the flag end of the Union, and 3 letter writer to 8 Cincinnati paper solemnly declares that Johnston has fall re- giment of bloodthirsty negroes at Bowling GreGn ready t. kill and e9t every Yankee they can find. in Canada, the tree negroes are pre-. pairing to give tho Yankees fits should England declare war. Sometime ago two men enlisted in a Canada regiment at Toronto. IL appears they were Yankee spies, and afier they had gained a,l tue information they could and made drawings of all the Qualifications they attempted to escape to Rochester, New York. They were watched by negro who pursued them in a boat and oqernlaled them. Upon their refusal to return, the darkey gave each inc contents or a barrel of double -barreled gun, loaded with buckshot, and took them back to Canada.

 When the Lincoln fleet, of the coast, heard of the great fire at Charleston, they fired sa- lute and otherwise testified their joy at the ca lamity. When the news reached the United States, great was the rejoicing. When Messrs, Mason, Sidell, Eustes and Macfarland went on board the Rinaldo, it was during a severe storm, and the northern papers were elated at the idea of the vessel having fonndered in the storp.-r Yet the people guilty of these things, have .c- e years had . missionary society and have pre- tended to send out preachers and others to con vert the savages"

THE SITUATION.",,"TIE SITUATION.


The arrival Of General Pope and the location of
his headquarters near the house of Mr.. wallach,
editor OF the Washington Star, is announced from
Cupepper, Va. The enemy, under Jackson, are
reported at Liberty Mills, west of the Central Rail-
road on the Rapidan river.


skirmish between our pickets and body of
rebel cavalry occurred on Thursday, at place
called Wolftown, some eight or ten miles from
Madison Court House, on the Stannardsville road
battalion of the Second Pennsylvania cavalry was
sent forward, who charged upon and drove the
rebels beyond the Rapidan, killing two and wound
ing several.


Our special correspondence from Culpepper
gives highly interesting account Of the recent
cavalry expedition to Orange Court House.


Rumors continue to be circulated in General
Pope's army that the rebels have evacuated
Richmond; but, although pretty generally be-
Ieved, they do not seem to be substantiated. It
g said that among the causes of the evacuation of
Richmond are the exhaustion of the country north
of the James, the infectious and pestential atmos
phere, and the superior advantages of the James
as line of defence. 1t is also stated that they
intend to maintain an open railroad connect ON
with the valley, via Lynchburg, Charlottesville
and Gordonsville, to Staunton, to the last mo-
ment, as a reserve for supplies.


The news from the West to-day is not very i'm
portant. From Nashville we learn that an attack
upon Col. Forests rebel forces was made by
Wynkoop's cavalry, near Sparta, on the 7th inst,
in which thirty rebels were killed. Our troops
withdrew and joined Gen. Nelson, at McMinnville
It was rumored at Nashville that Gen. Buell. had
taken possession Of Chattanooga, but the news
was not officially confirmed. The guerillas fred
sengers and killing brakeman.


The recent order of Secretary Stanton, forbid
ding the departure from the country of persons
liable to draft for military service, was the cause
Of considerable excitement in this city at the
wharves Of the steamships Etna and Saxonia, which
left this port for Europe yesterday. The Supern-
tendent Of Police, Mr. John a. Kennedy, having
been appointed special Provost Marshal for this
police district, the police consequently now con-
prise provost marshals guard, and In this ca
pacity they arrested all American citizens liable
to draft who attempted to 60 on board these
steamers without passport. A full account Of
the scenes which occurred on the occasion will be
found in another column.


We publish in tc-day's HERALD, under the proper
head, highly important and interesting news from
the rebel capital, compiled from Richmond papers
of the 4th, 9TH and 9th inst. The papers of the
first named date contain two important orders
one general order, under the signature Of the
rebel Adjutant General, establishing retaliatory
measures TO meet the execution Of President Lin
coins conlscation order, that is being so rigidly
carried out by General Pope. This order is par
ticularly directed against General Pope and his
officers, to whom the rebels promise, In the
event of their capture, close confinement and the
denial OF all immunites Of civilized warfare. The
communication from Jef Davis to the Command.
er-n-Chief Of the Union forces relates to the same
subject


The Richmond Dispatch Of the 5th inst. pub.
fishes in full the debate on Mr. Lindsay's motion
in the English Parliament to acknowledge The
nationality Of tue rebel confederacy II also con.
tsins the London Tines comments on the same.
The Dispatch styles the telegraphic despatch
sent from Baltimore to Cape Race, and thence TO
England, alleging the defeat Of McClellan's army.
as the ""Thunderer' sslast canard.n


Tho Lynchburg Republican publishes bogus
despatch IL publishes in a spread head and
double loaded article-purporting TO have been
copied from that old fogy sheet the National Intel.
hgencer, Of Washington, announcing the resigna
ton Of Secretary Seward and the refusal of the
Governors Of Pennsylvania, Ohio and Connecticut
to furnish any more troops for the Union army.


The Richmond papers abound in dvertisements
offering rewards for runaway soldiers.


The returns Of the North Carolina election re.
ceived up to the I'd instant put vances major.
lty for Governor Of North Carolina at 1,le7.

the following on the movements Of Gen.
Jackson: ~' = ,%>s' 49,


We have information that after his battle
with Fremont en- the Sth inst, Jackson
made sudden dash at Shields advance
which was hursying up from the direction OF
Luray to Fremont's assistance. He worsted
Shields advance somewhat in that affair
He then immediately resumed his retreat
quitting tbs road to Stauntoa, and burnns
the Port Republic bridge in his rear thus
Tor tho time being putting an effectual stop to
pursuit Of him, it is highly probable lie

Richmond, where the presence Of his force
will doubtless be hailed with delight bv

killed and rounded.


WASHINGTON, July Sd, 1862.


The news received to-day has dispeIed much
of the uncertainty and fear which rested upon
all in regard to the capture of our army in the
Peninsula. The battles of Monday aud Tues
day, heavy and bloody, seem to have resulted
in positive repulses of the enemy.


The fighting, however, we must expect to be
resumed tomorrow and the next day, to con-
tinue until the rebel hopes of saving Rich
mond are forever dead. They attack. No
other course is left them. They must defeat
Mcclellan in his position or he inevitibly has
their capitol, pushing towards it as he has been,
with heavy artillery, before which its defences
cannot stand day. Now, more than ever, is
it their necessity to assail him, since his new
move threatens Fort Darling. This taken, to
remove the Instructions in the river near it,
and to carry the dreaded gunboats up to the
city, is a matter of no long delay.


doubt not but that at the time Gen. Nc
Clellan first reached the Peninsula it was the
design of the rebel leaders to evacuate Rich
mond without battle. The tone of the Rich
mond newspapers satisfies me that such deter
mination was then formed. They did not be-
liere they could hold the james rirer against
our ndrdt forces. But, unexpectedly to them,
our vessels, even our iron-clad impregnables,
were repulsed at Fort Darling. Moreover,
Gen. McClellan's advance had been necessarily
slow, whence they have taken courage, and
had ample time to change their mind and re-
construct new plans. The clamor of Virginia
against abandoning its capital, has had weight,
also, and now, from all these reasons, and from
others which need not be discussed. the deter
mination to defend the city has been taken,
and it is carried-out with vigor and skill,
with daring and sacrifices, which throw lurid
CLEANS of an unholy glory around wretched
cause.


But their first design, that of abandoning
Richmond without serious resistance, was the
wiser one, and no doubt their more sagacious
men see it in that light They would have re-
tired to some inland point, and proclaimed
such retirement strategic operation. Max
ing their new centre of operations at Lynch
burg or some other point, they would have
compelled us, in the heat of Southern sum-
mer, to have carried our columns a hundred
miles inland and our fianks exposed for that
distance to their daring raids. Thus, no daubt,
they might for months and months kept us at
bay. When we have seen that Cen McClel-
lan's army, with its centre not over twenty
miles from its water base, 1.-THE White House
on the Pamunky,) has been entirely ridden
around, and its lines broken through and cross
ed by the eneIny's cavalry and artillery, we
may judge what serious dangers, annoyances
and disasters ii would have been exposed to
in the hundred miles of advance that must
have lain between Richmond and the point in
land the enemy might have selected at which
to make a stand.


The enemy's capital in our possession under
such circumstances, would have brought no
sound claim of success to our arms. and but
indifferent moral results. The unfortunate as
pect of such fact would have been explained
away to the satisfaction of the people of the
South, as well as TO that of the more civilized
and contemplate enemies of Republican in
sutuuohs, WIN hi Europe are enjoying our
misfortunes and auguring cur overthrow.


But now we believe the thing has changed.
and auspiciously for us. The enemy has con-
centrated his best troops-all he can command
to defend his capital. Deer the dead bodies
Of the brdrest men Of the South ,re ,cade in
blood 10 Richmond. To take a capital thus
defended, is an event of such moral and mate
rial significance will go far to end the war.
We delude ourselves when we expect or hope
for easy conquest over the South. The war is
great one-materially, and in its results, the
grandest the world has ever seen. The South
are in earnest. They hate the North, hate the
country, hate republican institutions-they are
brave, bloody and barbarian, and they must be
caught and killed before there can be peace in
the land.


DIR. Foulker, editor of the Memphis Ava
lanche, one of the best informed men in the
South, writes in that paper, June 30th, that ""a
new programme has been determined upon by
the confederate leaders, who are preparing
themselves for tremendous effort. They
consider that the territory recently given up
has weakened the North and correspondincly
Strengthened the South. They expect to hold"

Some aliens entertain the idea that beca Ns

idea. The fact Of their migrating to the coun-
try is proof presumptive that they intend to

We are happy TO say that msny soldiers in the
srmy now sighting for the preservation Of the
Uraon are aliens. In order to encourage the
enlistment Of aliens as volunteers, Congress
passed the following liberal enactment on the
18th Of last july


That any soh of the age Of lweuty years and up
wards, who has enlisted shall enlist in the armies o.
the United States, either the regukr the volunteer
forces and has been shall be hereafter honorably dis
charged, may be admitted TO become citizen or the

claraton OF his intention 10 become citizen of The

that the court admitting such alien shall In addition to
such proof OF residence and good moral character
now provided by law be satisfied by competent proof OF
such persons having been honoaby discharged from the
service OF the United States as aforesaid.


The alien who makes his donlicil in the
United States has the same interest in the main
tenance of the government as the citizen native
and to the manor born. In truth, all the peo-
pie of all nations, and their generations yet
unborn, have mighty stake in the safety and
permanence of this great republic--the hope Of
freedom and humanity all over the globe.


The Eternal Unity OF the American Re-


public-views Of Our Catholic Prelases


I'm Europe.


The twenty-frst day of July, 1862, will
henceforth be regarded as dies .faushts
in the history Of old Ireland. On that
day the grandest demonstration that ever
graced the capital city Of the island was
witnessed by Thousands upon thousands Of the
Irish people. The occasion that brought these
crowds together was the laying Of the i'd Ida
tion stone of new Irish Catholic University,
near the city of Dublin. No correct estimate
has been formed of the numbers who took part
in the procession of the day; but it is stated
that they must be counted by hundreds of thoui
sands. There was most llustrious assemblage
of foreign bishops, and America was well and
ably represented. Besides the Right Reverend
John Hughes, Archbishop Of New York, there
were present the Most Rev. Monseigneur Char
bonel Bishop Of Toronto; the Most Rev. Dr.
Loughlin, Bishop Of Brooklyn, N. y; the Most
Rev. DR.. McCloskey Bishop of Albany; the
Most Rev. Dr. Lynch, coadiutor Bishop Of To-
ronto, and several other distinguished bishops.
4 The foundation stone Of the new Institution
was laid with the usual imposing formalities,
after which most eloquent sermon was
preached by the Archbishop Of New York.
Full accounts of all these interesting ceremo-
nies appear in our paper this morning. The
words of the venerable Archbishop were most
aptly spoken, and may truly be said to have
been slike apples of silver in pictures Of gold.'
He said that it was some ffty years since he
voluntarily Hoated away from the shores of Ire
land and was borne westward to another coun-
try beyond the broad Atlantic. This country
was the United States Of America. Here the
young Iri bA adventurer-now the distinguished
Catholic prelats and scholar-found endless
opportuni ties fbr improving and developing his
ability; ""feEj'' as he says, Legislation had not
attempted to take away the key OF knowledge
and, although Roman Catholic. he was made
freeman ard an American citizen long before
the act Of CD holic emancipation was passed in
England The warm encouragement aud
friendly prct ection which America then showed
to this young Irishman were like good seeds

half q ceRs Try we find the same man. now
grown gray in the service OF the priesthood,
standing on the soil on which he was born and
energeticala defending the interests and the
liberties OF his adopted land The words Of
Archbishop Hughes and the other American
bishops whs were present on the different occa-
sions on "" hich he spoke cannot fail to make q
lasting imp 'esson on the mind of Europe. No
men could ,e more fitted by their ability, their
experience. or their impartiality to define the
position ana the views Of this country and this
government; and none, certainly could speak
with more Certainty or more decisive au-
thority thar the Archbishop Of New
York. fasef ng over his observations on the
important q uestion Of popular education
in which he so conclnsively showed the advan.
tages Of the free American system over the
sectarian regime Of the English schools-we
will glancl at his sound and statesmanlike
ideas on the unity. and inlivisbility of this
republic. If the United States government had
sent special ambassador to Europe to plead
the cause Of the country, he could not have
done it more eaectually than the Archbishop
has done. In Eiis speech in the Rotunda in
Dublin, on the I'D Of July, he gave the people
clearly to Understand that America will resist
every attemps at interference on the part of

 eHors to protect the whole ita territory, it had J .ncountsfed dfsasters. He has. not yet received

 the official reports of the discomftures at Roa- noke or Donelson; the Roanoke affair was deep

 ls .humiliating and he is unwilling to belieYe that a large army surrendered at Fort Donelson j withouta desperate efortto cutits'way through ] the enemy: But strenuous efforts have been

 made to send endorsements to the threatened 1 positions; and the disappointments will nerve

 the people to still greater exertions. He oppo-

 ses the policy of enlistments for short terms,

 and urges the soldiers to rs-enlist for the war ! He cannot tell the present strength of his army,

 but estimates it at 400 regiments of infantry, l with cavalry and artillery. He thinks the

 whole body of new leyies, and re-enlisted men

 will be ready within thirty days. His army was

 at present so disorganized as to impair it's abil- 1 ity for successful defence His navy is in sat- | .g f~ fl. | isfactory condition. His finances are prosper

 ous, he has no floating debt, and the expendi-

 lures have only been $17O,O00! His postage system is steadily improving. In closing he as- I sures his Congress of his hearty cooperation in \ all it's efforts. Our military authorities uillnot

 doubtless be blind to some of the important facts

 mentioned by the President of tho styled Con l federate States. esd q ] sa'e'e $ aa5k .aa.7e

 THERE is no longer . doubt that Nashville is in our position-both National and Rebel re- ports agree as to that point, The evacuation by l the rebels appears to have been attended by

 their usual exeesses. A dispatch from Clarks- vile states that the rebel soldiers plundered

 many dwellings and business houses, and exci-

 ted great alarm among thepeople. Several reb

 els were shot by the citizens whom they were in the act of robbing. Gov Harris, it is asserted

 was actually driven away by the Union men

 Before he left, he made Q speech recommending citizens to burn their private property, and call ing upon Tennesseeans to rally and meet him at Memphis, but-no one paid any heed to him Much indignation existed against Floyd, who destroyed the railroad bridge against the pro

 test of the citizens. Gen. Nelson is reported to be in command at Nashville, Gen. Buell. being still on the north side of the Cumberland. The

 Union sentiment is very strong in the city.

 MEMPHIS papers state that as early as the 18th of February, Gen. Polk issued orders prepara- tory to the evacuation of Columbus. and the demolition of the Notifications there The Co., lumbus forces were ordered to fall back to is- land No. 10, about forty five miles below-one of the islands fortified by the rebels and which commands the river. It is probable that Flag Officer Foote on his recent reconnaissance, when he was met by rebel flag of truce, was inform ed that very few troops beside the sick and wounded remained in the place. -..-..-. s.a 4 A VARIETY of interesting and important news from, the Rebel States reaches us by way of For tress Monroe, and through the medium of late

 Tennessee papers. On Wednesday evening last,

 a meeting of Tobacco and Cotton planters was held in Richmond to consider the propriety of

 voluntarily destroying their crops of these sta

 ples, III view of the fact that the efforts of the

 Union men were mainly directed toward rob ping the South of them. The delegates appear

 to have done nothing but make speeches howev l CT. Committee was appointed to prepare

 business for a subsequent meeting. Meantime,

 in the Rebel Congress, motion was made to

 provide compensation by the Government for

 cotton and Tobacco so burned. Probably the Convention of Planters will await the action of | the Rebel Congress, in this respect, before de- termining upon extremes. Resolutions declar ing for war to the last extremity were intro

 duced in the "" Congress-"" on Wednesday, by one ] of the Senators sent by the bogus Kentucky Gov ernment, but action upon them was deferred fthey were sent to tho Military Committee. The | rebels evidently think their case desperate

 one. The Raleigh IN. O. Register, editorially

 considers the present the most gloomy period experienced by the South since the commence | ment of the war, and calls upon tho people in

 the n ost earnest manner to stand by the colors

 and fight to the last; but judging from the fact

 that five regiments of volunteers are still wanted to fill up the quota of North Carolina in the reb

 ell army, the call will probably be in vain. The

 Lynchburgh (ya.) Republican states that our forces occupied Nashville on Sunday last. The

 Savannah Republican of Wednesday, announces

 that communication with Fort Pulaski has been

 effectually cut of by our forces, who have erect cd three batteries for heavy guns, bearing on tue river ms go rsats7 a' a.rg -f- E % AN important prize, captured by the Ports

 mouth off the Texan coost, was brought to New York on FridayAthe British iron steamship La

 Buan, built in Hull in 1S56 She was loading cotton at the mouth of the Rio G1ande. s,

 MONDAY Government is in receipt of highly important advices from Tennessee and Kentucky.

 Gen. Buell. telegraphed on Saturday night, to Gen. Mcclellan, that Murfreesboro had been l abandoned by the rebels, who were retreating | along the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad,

 tearing up the rails as they proceeded, thus rem dering pursuit difficult Chattanooga although

 in Tennessee, is very near the Georgia line, and

 the railroad passes through the northeast corner

 of Alabama, and touches the Georgia line before

 reaching it.. A great change is found to have

 occurred already in the political feeling of Tenn

 essee, and the War Department feels itself war

 ranted in taking measures immediately to raise and arm volunteer troops in that State. The I . sn =, Io L,r"

Gays, the troops of General Burnside's expedition
have taken possession of Roanoke Island. The
victory was completed on Sunday evening, and
our troops were landed in large force. The Stars
and Stripes were Immediately hoisted over the
rebel batteries. At noon on that day the rebel
Commodore Lynch, came down Currituck Sound
with his little feet to relieve General
Wise; but our fotilla opened brisk fire upon
them, and before five O'Clock in the afternoon
three Of the rebel gunboats were sunk, including
the flag boat, two were captured and the rest were
dispersed in every direction. The utmost conster-
nation is said to prevail in Norfolk and Portsmouth
in consequence Of this disaster to the rebel cause


Our success at Fort Henry, on the Tennessee
river. increases in importance as the detailed
news of that brilliant affair reaches US from day
to day. The account which we give of it from our
special correspondent to-day ia most graphic,
and will be read with great interest Not only
have our troops got possession of the strongest
point on the Tennessee river, but they have
pushed further into the territory of the rebels,
carrying victory with them, and working out in the
most satisfactory manner the grand plan devised
by the Commander-in-Chief to circumvent all
the rebel strongholds in that direction. 1t appears
by despatch received yesterday at st. Louis from
Cairo. that Capt. Phelps, Of Commodore Foote'S
squadron, in command Of the gunboat Conestoga,
has returned from an expedition up the river,
having penetrated as far as Florence, in Alabama,
after capturing new rebel gunboat and destroy
ing all the other gunboats between Fort Henry
and the town of Florence. Thus it will be seen
chat we hold in absolute possession q vital
strategic point, which emperils the most
reliable positions of the rebels, and will
binations, to render both Columbus and Bowling
Green comparatively worthless to them, by cutting
on their connections with the South, and so save
the necessity of reducing them at great sacrifice
ofSfe.


Two persons who arrived at Louisville yester-
day report that the rebels are evacuatng
Bowling Green, and are falling back on Nashville.
II this statement be true it proves that the move
ments Of our troops in the rear have convinced the
rebel leaders that Bowling Green is no longer the
strong strategic point it was few weeks ago, and
that il must be abandoned before it is entirely cut
OF from communication with the South.


A detachment of our cavalry, 250 strong
had an engagement with body Of rebels on Sun
day. seven miles east Of Fort Henry, in which five
Of the rebels were killed and thirty taken
prisoners. portion Of the railroad bridge on
the Louisville, Clarksvile and Memphis Railroad
was destroyed by our troops on Saturday night,
the rebels, who were encamped there TO protect
II, having previously evacuated the place.


The fate Of Fort Donelson, on the Cumberland
river Is likely to be speedily decided after the
manner Of Fort Henry. special despatch received
Ut Cincinnati from Cairo yesterday states that Gen.
Grant had surrounded the fort with seven batteries
Of artillery, and that he would commence sheling
k to-day. General Pillow Is said to be in com.
mand there with 1000 men. Other reports state
that the garrison numbers 5000, which is pro-
badly true, II, a. stated, the infantry force which
aed from Fort Henry has reached Fort Donclson.
The trees for two miles around the fort have
been cut down by the rebels, in readiness for
action, and It is thought that, as there are two
small forts and three camps outside The main
fortihcations, the approaching battle will be far
more desperate than that at Fort Henry.

The federals have landed a force and battle with light artillery was com

 menced this evening"" The force of the enemy Is reported to be ten or twelve thousand strong.- When the steamer left Ft. Donelson, the battle was raging but nothing of the result is known-

Hon. El,oin NJ. Stanton, Secretary OF War:


SIR The few short notes l handed you Oo
the day left Washington, with regard 10 the
military defence Of the country, after this re.
bellion shall have been mastered, shall, by
your kind permission, proceed now to elaborate.


Ipropose that We maintain an army Of 100 900
mer, composed of the three arms Of the service
In their due proportion. 'I--..


would assign Is 900 men 10 the defencc Of
that part Of the couotry lying west Of the Mis-.
issippi river, including the Pacific coast.
would assign Is. 900 men 70 the defence Of the
Lake, Atlantic, and Gulf coasts, stretching from
Lake Superior 10 the mouth Of The Mississippi
including kay West and TIE Tortngas tn""
remaining 60 900 meu I would station on the
line of the railroad from Memphis, Tennessee,
70 Chattanooga, and from thence on one rail
,ad branch 70 Charleston, South Carolina. and
on the other branch 70 Richmond, Virginia, oc
cupying between Memphis and Chsttasooes i'm.
portant intermediate points, say Grand juno
lion, Corinth, Decatur, and Stevenson.
Between Chattanooga and Charleston would
occupy. say Dalton, Atlanta, Union Point, Au
gusta, BrsnchvIlIe, and, possibly, Columbia,
South Carolina.


Between Chattanooga and Richmond would
occupy, say, Knoxville, Arlington, WythsviIle
Lynchburg, Charlottesville, Burksville, and
occupied.


Just a. soon as the points indicated are re-
covered from the enemy they should perna
pentiy be occupied by military force. The
important strategic points, such as Chsttsnoo
20, Memphis, and Richmond, should be strong
"" fortified without delay.


have thus, In brief manner, stated what
consider the best disposition 10 be made In a
military point Of view. Considered politically
am convinced that the lines are not without
their advantages. They pass for considerable
distance through q mountainou, region. By the
Introduction Of the superior knowledge a. d civ

become a. much attached to the Union, ,oitltal
condition, as aay of the Northern States, thu
placing an insurmouDtabls barrier to the sue
csss Of that portion Of the Union which woud
be most likely TO rebel against the constituted
authorities.


1t is very certain that no argument il wortt
straw with the Southern rebels but that o
the bsyonet, and we would be recreant to tb,
cause Of liberty on this earth II we did no. uss
Il effectually.


The President, besides the war power no Il

itary possession Of all the railroads In tn, Uni

follow its achievement: .oa34m9 -3aiy-


As far as England is concerned, we may
Judge from the past. Many people say, in
excuse for their state of mind about the
war, that they detest the Americans.


Very well and what does this meanP It
means an association Of ideas made up of
troubles about search of slaves at sea, and
brag about the Monroe doctrine, and
threats of Canada, and ISLANDERS about our
cruisers in the Gulf, and outrage on San
Juan, and the bullying ofthe General Har-
neys, and the sharp practice of cabinets at
Washington, and aggressions upon our
seamen in port, and universal rudeness to
our representatives in the states, and to
our government through American repre-
sentatives in England. All this with i'm
pressions Of filibustering, threats about
Cuba, an nnrepressed clandestine slave
trade, lynch law, marauding in, Kan
sas, brag about liberty together with
tar and feathers, cow-hiding, slave mar
kets, human stock breeding, and all the
rest Of it2these impressions combine to
make up the sentiment expressed 10y the
avowal, 81 detest the Americans But
for every element of this impression con-
federate society is answerable. 1t was the
South reigning at Washington, the South
importing negroes, the South coyeting Gu

Of the telegraph yesterday is fully confirmed;
25O0 brave troops on an island in the sea were ex-
posed to all the force Of the Burnside feet They
resisted with courage; but when 5000 were
landed against them retreat being cut off by sur
rounding elements, they were forced to surrender.
This is a repetition OF Hat.eras on large scale""
i The following are dispatches on the subject in
Richmond papers Of this morning:


""NoRFOLK, Feb. 1O.-The latest news states
that Capt. o. Jennings Wise, son of Gov. Wise,
was shot through the hip and disabled, though
his wound was not mortal. Major Lawson and
Lieut.. Miller were mortally wounded. About 800
Confederates were killed. Our (rebel) wounded
number over 900. The number of Yankees
wounded isabout the same. Midshipman Camm
had his arm shot of The other casualties are
unreported. A late arrival this morning sav.
Elizabeth City had been shelled and burned by
the Yankees, and that the enemy was pushing on
through to Edenton.""


Second Dispatch Feb. 10 ,r
NOR has prevailed that Commodore Lvncb,,
feet Of gunboats had been captured. II 1, not
regarded true, but It is believed that all were
burned by the COnfederates to prevent their cam
ture, with the exception Of one, which was en-
deavoring to make lis escape The feet went to
Elizabeth City from Roanoke Island, ard wa,
probably burnt at the former point.


TAird Dispatea.-NoREoLx, Feb 10, received
In Richmond at midnight.-A courier arrived
here this afternoon at o'clock. and brought the
intelligence that Elizabeth City was burned this
morning by the Inhabitants. During the conha-
grafton the Federals landed a large force. ALI
OF our gunboais, excepting one, were captured
by the enemy. Gen. Wise has not yet arrived at
Norfolk.


Acourier arrived here Yesterday afternoon about
three O'Clock, from whom we gather the follow.
Ing Information: The enemy advanced in full
force upon Elizabeth City yesterday about seven
O'Clock, and began an attack upon that place.
The citizens finding assistance In vain eva cuated
the place, but before doing so set fire to he eown
and when our informant left II was still I'm flames
We have also to record the capture by the enemy
Of all our little feet, except the Fanny or Forest
informant no. certain which. This eluded the
enemy and made up the Pasquotank river. II was
pursued, however, and fears are entertained that
she too was captured. 1t is said that before our
boats surrendered they were abandoned and that
the crews succeeded In making their escape If
50, we are at loss to conjecture why they were
not fred before they were abandoned


The disaster to our little fleet is attributed TO
the fact that having exhausted the supply Of cos
and ammunition, they proceeded to Elizabeth
City for the purpose of obtaining supply Ev-
| cry effort was made to Obtain coal, but without
success, and on this account the feet was unable
to return to the Island or send any assistance
whatever to our forces.


| All the details as published with reference to
the capture Of Roanoke Island are confirmed by
courier. He represents our loss at 800 killed
and wounded, and that Of the enemy at not less
than 600 killed. Great havoc was made among
them while Coming up the road leading to the
fort. Our forces brought to bear upon them two
S2-Pounders, and at every FIRE their ranks were
terribly thinned; the places Of the fallen were,
however, quickly filed. Pork Point battery was
manned by the Richmond Blues, and most nObly
did they defend 1t during the conflict. They
were attacked by whole regiment Of Zouayes,
and though completely overpowered, they stood
their ground bravely, nor did they yield a foo.
till all save seven fell bleeding to the ground.


There is good reason to believe that had Col
Henning,el, with his artillery, been on the island
ii would not have been forced to surrender A
lacb ofaeld pieces was sadly felt, ana had these"

despatch to the Inquirer Of this morning, dated at
Fortress Monroe the evening Of the 9th nst gives
what purpor TO be additional particulars Of the capture
OF Roanoke Island by Burnsdes forces.


By flag Of truce to-day learn that the lombard
mcnt Of the works Roanoke Island continued during
yesterday. About noon Commodore Lynch got his mos
quito notilla under way, and came down Currituck
Sound to assist his rebel FRIEND General Wise, the
island.


The Union gunboats then directed their fire upon the
gunboats commanded by Lynch and at five O'Clock yes
erday afternoon three rebel gunboats had been sunk,
two captured, one Of which had Commodore's
pennant flying during the action and the rest dspsrsed
in every direction.


The firing ceased at dark last night, but recon-
menced with increased vgof and effect this morning. and
kept until about eight O'Clock, when IL is supposed
the rebel forces on the island surrendered.


fireman board the Selden said that the Union
troops had been landed In large numbers on Roanoke
Island and that the Stars and Stripes could be
Elizabeth City flying over the rebel batteries. II
was rumorsd in Norfolk this morning that three rcgi
ments had recently been sent To Roanoke Island and that
there chance Of escape the probability was
that they were all captured.


The rebels acknowledge that the only obstacles OF i'm
portancs to roard General Burnsdes march inland and
upon Norfolk will bo the natural ones Of swanps,
marshes, sickness, &c.


The rebels feel their recent defeats very ssnsby and
growing desperate In their fear."
