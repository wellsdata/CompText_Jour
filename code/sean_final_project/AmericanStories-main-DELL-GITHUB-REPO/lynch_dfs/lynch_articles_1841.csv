The affair was creating great deal of excitement in Kentucky. f. lf

 Recently in Illinois equally summary punishment was inflicted on some gamblers who had committed an atrocous murder. The rascals were pursued sev. eral miles and when overtaken at least fifty bullets were lodged in one of them.

 h the latter case the enormity of the crime and the reckless character of the perpetrators, with the uncertainty of justice in that portion of the country are stated as pslliation of the dreadful punshment inflicted."

 On the 4th inst. meeting was held by the citizens, at which the Allowing resoluiion among others, was unanimously passed:

 Resolved, That we view with abhorrence the pro- ceedings of the abotionists in city, and that repudate theirdoctrnes, and believe il to be the duty of every good citizen by all lawful means to dscou- tenance every man who tends them his assistance.

 From the New York Era. CINCINNATI, Sept. i, 19Il.

 Our city IS at this moment the theatre of the most terrible excitement have witnessed. The mi litary are paroling the streets, and herads by order of the mayor, calling upon the citizens to meet al 7o'clock hs mornlng, al the market house, to devise measures for the preservation of the peace. and protection of our citizens. The whites and ne- groes have had terrible battle, in which several men reported to have been killed and number badly wounded. As have bni few minutes to write be- fore the close of the eastern mail l can give but brief narration of this dreadful affair On the even ing before last, il appears that quarrel occurred be tween several negroes and two white men, in which the latter were badly wounded, with dirk knyes.- This occasioned considerable excitement and added fresh fuel to the antinegro flame, which has been n- creasing m intensity and volume, with threatening rapidity of late.

 About o'clock last evening, large concourse of people, without concert and arms, assembled at the junction of Sixth street and Broadway in the imne- diate vicinity of the ""FNe Points, of this cty or as it is called here, ""Ngger-town."" A few persons il, the mob (which consisted of 300 or 400) apparently without any deliberate design, threw stones against the buildings of the negroes. The negroes immedia- tely poured into the mob volley of buets from mus kets and rifles, with which they had previously pro- ylded themselves in anticipation of an attack. The mDb heinz nnarlnad fled ataIv and were hotiy pursued for nearly square by the backs, who yelled out wild shout of triumph and defiance, and then returned to their houses, from which they levelled their pieces at the crowd.

 The mob continued at bay till after midnight, by which te perhaps, thirty forty of the assailans provided themselves with arms, and sir pound can mn. Thus equipped they advanced to the position they occupied Tn the early part ofthe evening"" loaded their cannon with fragments of ron and, leyelled it's nluzzle against building about one hundred yards distant, m which large number of armed negroes were said to be stationed.

 After few intellectual shots from the small arms of the assaiants the cannon discharged, but with out effect. The negroes quickly rallied, and return ed heavy fire upon their houses, but the whites stood their ground reloading and dischargng their six pOunder cannon several times, and kept up also brisk fire with their small arms. The conflict was terrible, but fortunately for the lives of many, the prompt arriva the military silenced the firing res tored peace and dispersed the mob,

 Since o'clock this morning, our city has enjoyed it's usual repose, but there apprehensions of a dreadful and concerted attack upon the blacks to- night, which, of course, the law abiding portion of our citizens will exert themselves to prevent. There various reports of the number killed and wound cd both sides, hut it is impossible ascertain the truth of these reports al present.

 The negroes were the ylotors ! What will be the result of this The negroes victorious think of that It is said they were counseled by the aboli- tionists to themselves, and fire upon the whites if attacked crowd of people have just passed my window in pursuit of some blacks, and Iam informed by friend at my elbow, thnt the city is all in conu sion and uproar again, and that terror struck ne groes are flying in all directions.

 There is nofshting lynchng, but the people, ,the mob, taking the negroes into custody as fast d. they be caught, with the design of entorc,ng law of this sta, which requires all col6red residents of Ohio to give bond for their good behavior leave the state."

 A great deal of we-nerited praise is bestowed on the order and dccornm which were observed during the trial. Not the slightest indication appeared either before or after lhe prisoners arquta ""f any dispo- silon Ia insult or commit violence upon him. This saying gpod deal Mlrn tie intense interest which felt this subject is taken into considerations The result will have the happy effect of proving to Great Britain that simple threat demonstration of force is able To deter people from pursuing deviatngly the road which they have marked out as that of rght-that courts ol justice are not mois -and that have other laws besides those which belong to the code Lynch The State of New York has amply vindicaed and enforced both the position which she assumed m the report of justice Cowan, and the construction of international law declared by the late administration.

The bank very compacently furnished the information required, by which it appears that five of the said notes, a- mounting in the aggregate to $l5,OO0, are totally worthIess-that they discounted for individuals without character and means, and that the names ap- pended to some of them are forgeries, These notes are drawn by different individuals and all accepted by person named D. H. Stickney. They are en- dorsed by different names, and recommended by Dix on II. Hall and others.

 In Jackson county, similar ''fiauds"" have been committed. The editor of the Jacksonville Republi- can states, that he shown list of twenty-four forwarded to that place from the Montgomery Bank, which names were signed to notes discounted at the Bank of Montgomery some time about the lst of May for about agh thousand dollars. Although tolerably well acquainted in this county, (that paper says) we do not know sngle individual of the twen- ty-four, and some of our citizens who are best ac- quainted, have little knowledge of them we have. There can be little doubt that every one of these names forged. Among the which declared to be forged, those of Gen. Walker and Stephen Kelly, Representatives from Jackson.

 The most singular part of the proceedings of the Autauga meeting the passage of resolution, questng the bank to furnish list of the bills and notes discounted during the two three past years.

 To us this kind of popular supervision to parake good deal of the character of the lynch law, and how far it should be allowed question of ,e- "" serious importance."

 The Land Bill was taken up, and while some amendment was under discussion, Message from the President announced, and all eyes were in- simultaneously turned Mr. John Tyler, Jr. ~ho pre- sented himself the door with the charter of the monster, neatly rolled up, accompanied with pack age with a large black seal, very much like death warrant This settled all doubt to the question of veto or no veto, and every thing else forgotten in the desire ascertain the character of it. The Land bill unceremoniOusly thrust aside, and Mir Soutlard, whose hands trembled that he scarce could break the seal, gave the message the Sec retary, who commenced reading The chamber was crowded to with spectators, and the priveg- ed seats on the floor by members of Congress and others entitled to the entre,"" yet scarce breath was heard until the close of the second paragraph of the messages when its character could no longer be mistaken. Then the murmurs of exutaton on the one hand, and chagrin the other, so audible for a moment not to he mistaken. Quietness was again restored, and the message listened to til it's close with the deepest attention, many evi dently hoping against hope that something wsuld ap pear it progressed that would neutralize the dec ded tone at it's commencement. But there was not a sentence to hang hope upon, and the countenan- of the leaders of whggery betrayed their feelings, notwithstanding all their efforts to conceal them.

 MT. Preston's face a complete study. Ills efforts to conceal his agitation produced such udic contOrtions of countenance, that person, how ever much bis feelings of commiseration might be CAcitcu, Couiu hot hCip hhu6hh6' ho uOuDt thinking of his ""paramount principle to preserve the ascendancy of the whig party"" which, from ap- pearances, was in jeopardy. When the reading of the Message was terminated, there were slight man estaons st disapprobation in the gallery, followed instantly by others of an opposite character. Mir. Benton rose, and with much warmth, denounced those who, on such occasion, presumed to offer an insult to the Senate and the Executive, and offered motion that the offenders be taken into custody and brought to the bar of the Senate. After some de- bate, it was ascertaned that person in the custody of the Sergeant -at-Arms, who expressed much contrition for the part he had acted, and on Mir. Benton's mutton, he was discharged.

 Mir. Clay, of kuntucky, then submitted a motion that the Senate would, tomorrow at l2 o'clock pro- ceed to consider the message of the President, which was agreed to.

 Mir. King then moved that 5000 extra copies of the Message should be printed, which agreed to, Mir Clay being the only senator who voted against it.

 Ths Veto Message has produced much excitement in this city. The rage of the Wings breaks out in threats of violence towards the President Lynching tar and feathers, riding rail, Sc. &c., are the delicacies with which they propose to treat ""Tyer too."" While am writing, band of rowdes, about hundred strong, are proceeding to the Presidents house, with drums tin horns, &c playing the ""rogues march"" and disturbing the stiffness ofmidnght with their yells and grOans Preparations it is said, are making to burn the President in efigy. When this takes place, there will probably be number present who were not invited, and there will be burning in reality.

 Another letter of the same date, says

 It is impossible say this moment what will be the pursued by the Cabinet The opinion that sev- eral members will resign-especiay the Attorney Gener- a who is devoted o Clay. Upsn thst event. Badger the Secretary of the Navy, is said, will be appointed AL torney General. But present almost every thing is conectnrsone thing however, s certain, the whs party is split and democratic doctrines likely preya Already the signs of the times 0mnous-lndiana is revolutionized Last year the House of Indiana stood 70 whigs to 20 democrats in round nunbers-now there lot New York will have next fa democratic msjori- ty in her lower House. perhaps in the Senate. The will give impulse to the democratic party. You will like the Presidents veto-it s exceedingly able document, and evidently the result of much consdera ion and consultation. The Virginia old rights le their homes aud visited the President and several Virginia gentlemen high in the ranks of the democracy were most certainly amOngst his advisera."

The most energetic enterprises have been set foot to unravel the mystery The steamer Neptune started of in few hours after the spread through the city, manned with sixty volunteers well armed and provisioned for thirty days. She to explore the inlets and islands of the coast as far Galveston.

 Other expeditions have also started ts the coast by the Barrataria canal The steamer merchant has also started to examine Lake Boigne and the yicni- ty of the Chandeliers with large party of volunteers and sailors. ""H

 From the Crescent City of ye,terdsy.

 The Piratss.-'rhe mate of the Savannah reports that when at the Baze, four were found secret ed-two on the ship Henry and two on the ship Ala barna which cleared from this port Thursday last When nterrogated to their purposes, they eyinced rather a savage state of feeling, and said: ""They didn't know all vet, but would on that day brig standing on, with Spanish flag"" This was said bullying sort of manner, giving the idea of some connection with the late nefarioua transactions These men, we understand are to be brought up to the city. t.f

 Capt. Wade states that while westward of the SW Pass, he saw suspicious looking hermophrodite brig standing between him and the land, steering w by N-judging from the distance at which she seen, she appeared to carry about IA guns This brig while in sight, took in her studding sns, and hauled up in the wnd making her course for the ships Cal edona, Ocean Queen and brig Catharine, winch were heading up for the SW Pass.

 The following is an extract from the log book of the Savannah: .. Y.

 s.Was boarded on the 9th inst by the U. s. reve- nue cutter Woodbury, Capt. Jones, s. w. by w.. from the s. w. Pass, distance about 45 miles from the Westward. bound F., having thoroughly exam ined the coast from s. w, Pass to Vine Island, wh- out having heard seen any thing of the piratical vessel that murdered the crew and robbed the ship Charles. Captain Jones boarded and examined a great number of vessels, and it is his intention to cruize in the track of vessels from the Tortugas to the Mississippi river, in order, if possible to discov the piratcal vessel, and to put mariners their guard approaching the coast.

 ""Barataria has been examined by boat expedI- ton, on the 9th inst, from Woodbury.''f

 We learn nothing further upon this subject, though the town is jammed full of reports. At time yes. terday it was said that the Captain and passengers of the Charles were in town; but it proved hoax in one sense, though in another, duplicate ""ship Charles"" we understand being in port. We have conversed with many intelligent seamen our count yesterday and find that suspicious to the affair being founded mutny and piracy together, agree with theirs. There is little doubt in most minds at present. that some of the sailors and steer age passengers shipped and took passage for the pur pose of robbery and murder. There are suspicious and mputations upon and against persons in our city, as being co-workers in these nefarious deeds.- 1t may be SO, and it may not be. We hope for the sake of humanity that all may prove fase-the sup posed piracy itself, well as the suspicious named above. We have ne7sr seen New Orleans in such an excitement Men seem itching to simbrue their hands in the blood of the supposed wretches, and should they be taken fear that hapy the cool course of the stream of justice might be diverted into the channel of Lynch law. .,,,' lt Iar"

 From the Presse

 The American Union, the constitution of which has been so much boased of as admirable, IS a sin gnlar country. s Disturbances are breaking out on every point, and the grayest symptoms connected with them is that they meet with no repression The odinls Lynch Code IS likely to he substituted every where for regular legislation. IL is the triumph of barbarism over civilization. The President, that chief elected by the peoples is decred, spit upon and | sued even in his own house, by a mob of women and street porters, who burn him in efigy, whilst they are waiting forte opportunity of doing il ality. In Congress, the American Lycurgans from time time strip o their coats, and argue with their l fists; and these the most moderate: there who prefer a controversy with the knife. In the government the anarchy is still greater we see mi lhsters presenting important measures to the Cham bers, ,.and exertlng all their eloquence have them adopted, and thea, after their labor, the President l of whom they the representatives and the organs destroys all their work by stroke of his The | ministers then naturally withdraw but in the Uni ted States changes of ministry effected in a De- | culiar way Before they retire there are minister who cons der it indispensable to the dignity of the government treat the President, the depositary the executive power, the living person nfcaon of the majesty of the people, like the lowest of clowns | Mir. Ewing, the Secretary ofthc Treasury, reproach es the Chief of the Executive, with having neither law faith in putting his setu upon the very sures which he had advised and called for-with be ing more changeable than weaihercock, de ceiul than hypocrisy in person, and more silly tal all the mbeciles whose united suffrage made him tn, first authority of the State. This Is very fatternl for the sovereign people, is it not!

 The Presse then ridicues Mir. Webster's apolog, for continuing in the cabinet and asks if the othe members had not the same reason, if they chose [, avail themselves off Ii continues thus!

 ssLet add to the above, that this moral peop' have three four times committed bankruptcy; tha this economical people, who, three four years ago did not owe single dollar, obliged to bur row sixty millions to only portion of their de hcit that ihs philanhropic people have not less thal three millions of slaves; that this lghtened pe0p resort to the prohibition of foreign products aug ment their customs revenue, the most stupid piece inconsistency that could the human brain; tha this people, with all the chances of prosperity (piac d'apenir) are daly on the brink of dissolution, s, much so that the other day they were nearly failing to pieces on the question of nomination of an am bassador to England. We have had in France, fo a time, Repubcans,wh wishing not to be confound ed with the democracy, whose exploits had been wit messed this side Of Ihe Atlantic, solemnly calle themselves disciples of the American schoo w, should like to know what they thnk of their schou now.. The theory may perhaps be good, but tn practice is certainly detesiable.'' ~"
