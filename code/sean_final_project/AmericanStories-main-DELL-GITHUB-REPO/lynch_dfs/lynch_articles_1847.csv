VALUE OF NEwsPAPERs.-The New YO5k
correspondent ofthe Charleston Courier, thus
gossips about the value of different newspaper
establishments at the East; rI.t.
. Notwithstanding the many newspaper fail
ures which we have witnessed in our city, the
value of well established newspaper property
is very great. We had few years ago pre-
yailing mania for types and paper, which,
while it lasted used upa considerable amount
of floating cash. 1t went out few years ago,
and the last new daily established was, think,
the Telegraph. which lived about two years.
This mania has now run into Sunday publish
ing, there being now five or six Sunday papers,
and two or three more projected. The old Sun
day papers, Atlas, Mercury and Times, are do
ing well-the Atlas probably devides forty dol
lars per week 20 each ofits proprletors, and the
Mercury nearly as much. Bull was led to
speak OF the value of newspaper property, by
hearing of the sale of one-half of the Boston At
las, by Mr.. Hayden, to Colonel Schouler, ofthe
Lowell Courier, for about S35, ,000. The Atlas
is one of the best papers in Boston, and is lib
orally patronized; but probably the most profit
able paper is the Daily Advertiser, which has
very large advertising patronage. 1t is con-
sidered worth $4,000, and $4,000 it is said
has been refused for half of it. The Boston
Post is also valuable paper, even the Wings
not being able to resist the bonhomnie of Colo
mel Green, and give it liberal support. Here
the Courier establishment is probably as valua-
bic as any, although the Journal of Commerce
runs it closely, and the Sun and Tribune prob
ably make quite as much money. One-third
of the Courier was sold few months since to
one of the assistant editors for $50 GOO; and one
quarter of the Tribune, report says, was sold at
$4,000 A portion of the Tribune could not
be bought for less than equal to $780, 900 for
the whole, and the Sun is held equally high,
although sold originally to Beach for $4,000.

Puebla (the State, area l8,44l square miles) has
nearly an equal population and chief town of

raj idea of the populations and surfaces over which
these separate corps of occupation will have to act.
Now, to hold single town, though it should be the
capital, in each State would (as we have already
Intimately be of little effect towards reducing TO
submission half-barbarous State, whose remoter
districts, often defended by the widest mountains,
and made by national hate doubly untamable, arms
cannot reach nor any thing but extreme length of
possession bring under your sway.


In short, each State must, besides garrison in
its capital and lines Of stations connecting the force
there with their supplies, have detached corps fixed
at variety of points, where large population ex-
lists, to be by degrees awed into servitude. Ger
tainy you may, with single corps, seize each
State capital and chase away its Government but
what will that avail No more than it did to the

by attempting conquest in detail, by trying to sub


due and hold each separate Mexican State, that any
thing can be hoped And what does this plan inevi-

three to five, six or eight thousand strong and, by
maintaining an intimate and irresistible possession
Of all her territory, to weary out resistance, until
not merely submission (which would otherwise
cease the moment you Withdrew your forces) shall
come, but a permanent willingness TO wear youl
chains. Need we say that this is but scheme fo

HAVE WE IT NOT ALREADY, the people all uncon
scous, amidst the din of successful arms and the
talk of subjected empire-sounds that have ever
bewched the unthinking. not less under popular
Governments than under desposms For in both
alike the fatal glory of extended dominion has
captyated the giddy multitude, quite as sure TO be
pleased with the fancied addition to its own sway
and greatness, as with the less direct honor of its
masters. Our politicians greatly mistake, when
they suppose that it is peculiar ""Anglo-Saxon
