We see tha, the Guard half way endorses
the story told by the Grenada Herald thai
the wings made the Mississippi Banks. we
intend shortly to show the truth IN relation
to that matter, concerning which there ought
never to have been any controversy, by CIV
ing the vote on all the bank charters ever
passed in this State. and thereby SO fasten the
thing down upon the democrats that they
will never again repeat the silly tale ol the
Herald


We did not dispute the correctness OF the
list Of votes given by the Herald. What we
objected to was. the unfair trick OF stating
the number of whig and democratic votes re-
corded against particular banks. when, per-
haps, the whole number was less than doz
en-. and attempting to argue, from the fact
that more democratic than whig votes were
so recorded, that therefore the wings made
those banks. We were not willing that our
veracity should be called in question upon
such proof, which, by the way. is all that the
editor of the Herald can offer. We shall
sustai in our assertion. and disprove that ofthe
Herald, by showing who voted IN faror OF
the banks and our neighbor may then have
an oppo rtunity of endorsing for his Grenada
brother, if he chooses to do so. We opine.
however, that he will be ""mum."" for the facts
will be far from bearing out his supposed
case""


We admit that the democracy has destroy
ed the banks, but this admission does not
initiate against the fact that they created
them 1t is also true that the wings oppo
sed some of the measures adopted by the de-
mocracy to ensure the destruction of the
banking system, but we did so because we
believed that those measures were not only
impolitic but unjust and dishonest 1t was
not fair, 1t was not honest, when the yalua
ton law was passed and the people were
thereby enabled to postpone for long period
the payment of the debts they owed to the
banks, to compel the banks to pay all their
obligations at once under pain of forfeiting
their charters. 1t was like tying a man,
hand and foot. throwing him into the waters
and denouncing death against him if he
should no: swim We did not make the
banks, we considered them.so many curses,
to the people of the State, but we wished to
see them dealt with according to the method
pointed out by law. Democracy WAS like
mob. excited. and eager TO administer Lynch
law upon supposed offenders. The wings
were willing that the guilty should be
brought to justice, but insisted that it should
be done in accordance with the laws OF the
land, and therefore it is that we are charged
with being the authors of a system which we
have opposed from the beginning and which !
we shall ever oppose while whig principles |
remain unchanged."

 The Richmond Compiler states that losses amounting to a million of dollars arc already heard from.

 The Richmond Whig has tho following postscript :-Thc Lynchburg mail due Satur. day arrived last evening. It brought neither letters nor papers, but we learn from the driver, that generally the destruction from the upper end of Buckingham to Iynchburg, and south to Dan River is as great as our wors, fears portended.

Never was so great fall of water in so short a time (some 10 hours) known.

 It is reported that numerous very bad breaches have been made in the canal above Columbia-in some places, the locks as well as the embankment being swept away. The line of tie canal in great many places was flooded from tho river.

 WASHINGTON, July ls.

 There is much anxiety here of course 10 learn what will be the fate of the Revenue Bill when it passes the two Houses ot Con- gress. No one can speak positively for the President. His hostility to the Land bill is of course we'll known, but it is very doubtful whether, when Congress insists, the Presi- dent will not recedc upon question of mere expediercy, and consent to throw inc chan ces of repeating the Land bill into the next Congress- Many intelligent men believe there will be no veto. The omission of the peculiar friends of the President to take part in the depatc upon the Revenue bill, was in- dicative of the same result. Mir. Cushing, too, much the the ablest defender of the Pre- sident, voted for the bill. So did M. Irwin, of Penn. Two of the so-called guard"" 1t is true, Messrs. Gilmer and Mallory, voted

  those gentlemen were never more than ab- straction, transcende,aGl Wings, and who are not more than the distance of the hundredth part of hair from unsophisticated Loco Fo- coism. MT. Mallory would go clean over ii the Loco Foco party would receive him, and Mir. Gilmer, believe, has all the zeal of ""new disciple"" in tho hope of being can didate of that party tor reelection. If, there fore, the votes of the party mean any thing, they are ominous of good. and so indeed of ali the signs of the day. Should coming events cast their shadows before, we may vet have the Revenue bill and the Land bill saved.

 If not, the eaec; will be the distribution without fail, for that is the law of tho land, and either DO revenue at all. or as much re- venue us may be collected by an imposition of duties at twenty per cent. Congress will not butge au inch, but throw tho Tesponsi5l. li'y upon ,he ExcCui've.-N- Y ErPyes'"

which the following is the main part, protesting
TO give an insight into the secret history OF the
Treaty lately concluded with Great Britain:


When Lord Ashburton arrived at Washington
he took an early day to open the subject of his
mission; and with that frankness which marked
his whole course throughout that negotiation, be
| advised Mr.. Webster that the nature of his in
disputed territory north of the line of highlands,
claimed by the British Government to be the true
boundary.


This of course presented the question in a very
serious light; and Mr.. WEBSTER very promptly
informed his Lordshp that he must either recede
from this demand or terminate his mission As
his instructions were peremptory, ne was about to
close his mission of peace, and war between the
two countries appeared inevitable; when MIR.
| WEBSTER persuaded him to enter into full ex-
animation of the whole question with view TO
make himself acquainted withits real merits. This
he did in obedience to Mr.. WIS urgent solicita-
tons; and such was the character of Mr.. WEB
| srER's representation of the facts-so perfectly
simple did he render this intricate subject By bring
ing to bear upon it the force of his mighty intel
lect-thut Lord AsHBURToN acknowledged his
conviction of the injustice of the claim of his Gov
ernment to the extent insisted upon, and actually
agreed to remain at Washington until he could re-
ceive additional instructions from his Government,
instead of promptly closing his mission as he was
authorised to do.


A delay of six weeks followed, during which
time nothing was heard in relation 20 this negoci-
alton but at the expiration of that period the anx-
iousy looked for instructions arrived and the treaty
was actually made according to the line Of bound
arv fred by Mr. WEBSTER after Lord AsHBuR,
TONS mission under has first instructions had
actually closed.


On these facts you may rely: and they are not
ouly highly creditable to Lord Ashburton, but very
clearly prove that Mr.. Webster is entitled TO the
gratitude Of his countrymen for the amicable adj
iustInent of this very troublesome question, to an
extent which is known to only few of his friends.
The BANKRUPT LAw.-The Journal of Com
merce contains the following paragraph concerning
the fate of the existing Bankrupt Law. Wha,
ground they have for it we are unable to say. We
can only hope that their prophecy will prove false
though we scarcely expect it.


1.-The fate OF the Bankrupt Act is sealed 1t is
TO be repealed, condemned, repudiated, in vo-
len, and vindictive manner. The instructions to
the Vermont Senators have settled the question
No regular course of Legislation is to be tolerated
in regard to this Inflated law. 1t is not to be
regularly annulled but it is 10 be Lynched. 1t is
to be tried by Lynch law and expunged The
plan is to present petition for its repeal-to move
reference OF that petition in the House to the
| Committee On the Judiciary, with instructions
forthwith to bring in bill repeating the act, and
then this bill is to be passed at once through al
the stages of legislation, under the decision made
by the Speaker at the last Session. Some say that
the President will veto this repeating law. Many
express an ardent hope that be win do So Some
OF the ultra Wings say that if he viii, they will

REVOLUTIONARY ITEMS.",,"REVOLUTIONARY ITEMS.


The estimated expense Of the revolu-
tionary war in specie is over one hundred
and thirty five millions Of dollars.


To meet this immense charge Congress
issued from 177R to 1881, S357.476,541
of continental paper money, which during
that time deprecated nearly two thirds Of
its value. In addition to this, Congress
ppbta,ned loans from France and Holland;
from the former &C twenty-one million
livers or $3.878.876. and from the lataer
Of twenty two millions Of livres or 81.
O74.O73. Tho first loan was in 1878,
the last in 1888.


The first President Of the old Congress
was Pev'on Randolph Of Virginia, chosen
September 5th, l774.


The last was also Virginian-Cyr
Griffin. elected January g2d. 1893.


The Oldest OF tho signers OF the De-
claraton Of independence, was Benjamin
franklin. who was then 70. The Young
est 81 ner was Edward Rutledge. Of South
Carolina. who was q. Thomas Lynch.
from South Carolina, was also but 81
years old.


The average age of the signers, leav-
ing out three whose ages are not known,
is fraction short Of A., showing that as
body they were not so young rs to be

dent feelings Of youth; nor We so old as

 NEW HAMPSHIRE LEersLATURE.-Thee ed- tor of the Congregational Journal makes the following statement respecting the N. H. Legislature now in session:

 Ut is a circumstance which probably has no parallel in tho Legislature of any state in the Union, of an equal number of members, that of 275 Councillors, Senators and Repre- convened in the Capitol, about ONE HUNDRED are connected with some evan. gelical church. It is also gratifying to know that they did not leave their religion behind them when they left their homes. For some evenings in succession after discharging their duties as legislators, they have assem- bled at different places for conference and prayer, which were attended by nearly the whole number of professors, and marked by high spirituality and interest. When our legislators and statesmen iWbihe the spirit and are controlled by the principles of christ ianity, the state cannot but be safe, to what ever hands its interests may be committed""

 The city of Wilmington is improving de. spite of the hard times-nearly, or quite 100 houses have been built this season. costing about $l5O0OO. Wilmington is destined to be large and important city. The country around it has, within the last few years, been remarkably improved, and is now one of ihe richest farming districts in the Union.

ceedings al the Police Office. and have been tre-
ouently present at the Office of the Recorder and

recellect, soon after the reorganization OF tue
| Criminal Court was surprised al the scrutiny
which was made by Judge Lynch in examining
bail as 10 their su6siency, and the manner IN
which he required the bail in suspicious cases 10
detail the property of which they were possessed
all which was taken in the form of deposition
so that If it was untrue the party could be Indicted
for perjury; indeed, such practice has become
| frequent with the Judges of the Sesslons-the
good effect of which has been, tha, by the example
thus set to the Police Office an entire change mas
| been produced in the character OF bail which Is
returned 10 that Court: and as evidence oi the
careless and indifferent manner IN which that ous-
ness wa; transacted a, the Police Office before the
REORGANIZATION of The Court of Sessions, beg
leave to state facts taken from report or ac-
count Sled bv Mr. Whiting, District Attorney, IN
January, 1871, in the Office of the Clerk ot tue
Court of Common Pleas From January, lo4U,
to January 1871, Mr. Whiting commenced up
wards of 700 suits on rccogHizances amounting to
upwards Of 100000. In upwards OF 800 oil
those cases the defendants could not be found;
and out of all the remaining suits not one dollar
has ever been realized by the Treasury of the city
From this it would appear that probably four OF
FIVE hundred persons. in that year only who were
indicted, and probably most of them guilty, cs-
capped punishment and yet nothing was realized
| BY the Treasury from their bail. What other in
ference caa be drawn? What number of GRIM
inas thus left at large to prey upon the
community!-Now mark the contrast: The new
organization of the Court fully into operation
in the Spring of 1871. For more than a year
past, when recognizances were forfeited the Court
caused reference to the Clerk to inquire into the
sufficcpcy of the sureties, and directed the Clerk
to inquire of each Magistrate before whom recog-
nizanccs taken, as to their suhclency; acting
under this system it is found that largo proper
ton of the recognizances now taken are consid-
cred good, and that instead Of ut the rate of up





ing the Recordcrship of Recorder Morris, the
number of recognzances forfeited in the whole
during the last six months has been only 83 In
all cases where there were doubts to the sol
vency Of the sureties, the new Court has issued
bench warrants against the defendants and thereby
saved to the City large sum OF money, which
they have heretofore disbursed for prosecuting re-
cognizances which produced nothing, and in a
large proportion of these prevented the criminals
from escaping trial and conviction as had hereto
fore happened.


a clamor has been raised, and false and scurril-
Gus statements published, that those Judges have
abused the discretion vested in them and let loose
vagrants and vagabonds on the community. A
clamor originally got up from mere partisan feel
ing, and for the purpose CT casting odlum on the
reorganization of the Criminal Courts as Wing
measure /; but since then, the charge has been re-
peated without shadow of proof by those who,
aware of the dishonest motive ot the cainor,
should net have permitted themselves to be instru-
mental in giving an increased circulation to un-
founded an accusation. The real truth of the case
is, that the proceedings of the Police Magistrates
had been so erroneous Irregular, and illegal, that
in some very few instances vagrants by their coun-
sci availsd themselves of those errors and defects,
and the Judges in the regular performance OF their
duties, upon ha6eIS corpus we're compelled 10
discharge them, assigning in detail the grounds Of
such discharge. Not single instance has occur
ed in which their acts have been overruled or set
aside. In the progress of those Investigations 1t
was discovered that while loud complaints were
made against the Judges for discharging those few
yagrans for legal defects in the proceedings against
them the Police Magistrates and Aldermen ofthe
City were in the habit Of discharging concicted
vagranis from prison before the term of their SEN
tence expired, without any authority OF law, and
without assigning any reason for such acts. One
of the Judges. as l was informed, frequently re-
monstrated against So fragrant abuse, but 1t
continued until the grand denouemeat in April
last, when upwards of seventy were discharged
from the Pententiary, Immediately previous to
the Election, for what purpose and with what
view may hereafter be made to appear, if the con-
stituted authorities discharge their duty in pursu

abuses III order divert public attention from the
