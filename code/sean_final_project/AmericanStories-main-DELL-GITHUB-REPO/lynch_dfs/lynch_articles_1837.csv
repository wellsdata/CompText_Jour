 ""It is not above eight or ten weeks since, that he gave a most splendid party, declar- ing that it should eclipse any party given in Washington during the same winter. Nat ural and artificial flowers were strewed m prolusion about the supper table; and lights were dazzling, and the music was surpassing. The cost of the supper was said, at the time, to be above $1O00, yet in his schedule he re- 1 turns the whole value of his property, conSis- ting of carriages, horses, plate, and furniture, us only 5000 dollars. So that tho supper cost him about one-third of what he was worth in property. His schedule of his debts is very terrific. To ono creditor (l. Gates & Co. of Canada) he owes above 4l,WO dol lars and to u firm in Philadelphia, (Wiggns & Col 95,OO0 dollars; and to the rest ot his creditors his schedule shows him to be in- debted to the amount of nearly 60.OOO dol lars. This is an alarming debtor and cred itur account for one who Is supposed to have been basking for some years in the sunshine of Executive patronage, and to have enjoyed unusual money facilities in consequence ot the position he had occupied in reference to the Deposite Banks. It is hard to account

Accordingly, at the proper hour, they entered the house singing and dancing as they proceeded, and perform ed the duty assigned them.

 These outrages incensed the neighborhood, and it was secretly determined by few who had imbibed an attachment to the code of Judge Lynch, to present the whole household with a coat of tar and feathers. For this purpose, some ten or twelve young men blackened their faces and otherwise disguis- ed themselves, and proceeded at late hour on Monday or Tuesday night of last week, to Sweets house, which they entered, seized se- verdi of the inmates, (among whom was SWeeD covered their bodies with tar, and then feathered them with the contents of a bed which they took from the house for that purpose.

 The intruders then retired but again soon returned, and stole large quantity of maple sugar, with which they decamped. On ma king their second visit, one of the disguised gentlemen was recognized, and the next day arrested, examined, and bound over for trial. During the examination, the females re- peatedly declared their belief in the divine character of ""their lord,'' as they called him, and their obligation to obey him implicitly.

lishcd in the city Of Vicksburg, to be
entitled the Mississippi Sentinel and
State Rights Exposltor, edited and
published by Drs. Green and llagan.


The great and growing resources
of Mississippi, and the rapid increase
Of wealth, population and business,
seem to demand another paper in this
city.


The political. character of this paper
will be indicated by its title. It will
advocate the great principles Of State
Rights and State Remedies, and an
nonnce, from the watch-tower, every
encroachment Of the Federal Govern
ment on the rights Of the States and
| the liberties OF the people. BY ire.
Iquent recurrence to FIRST principles
and the doctrncsstaught by the franz
ers Of the Constitution, it viii en-
dcavor to impart clear views Of the
federal compact, that the people may
be enabled to mark, and prepared 70
resist the advances of despotism and
corruption.


The peculiar institutions OF the
South, and the present crisis, require
energy, intelligence and organization
on the part Of the people. The wealth
and luxury of Rome only stimulated
the rapacity and avaricc OF the north
ern barbarians. We must not only,
individually, become acquainted with
4 the rights and interests OF the South,
but we must effect such a union Of
fceling-such physical organization
as will defy the bold schemes Of lanat-
Iicism and the wiles of treacherous


demagogucs; and transmit to posterl-
ty our glorious institutions, pure as
we received them from the hands OF


our forefathcrs.


| Though there are times and circum-
stances when the laws may be dis
, pensed with and summary punishment
: be resorted TO, yet we are convinced
that Lynch law has become quite too
, common all over the country. 1t has
; excited furious and sanguinary spirit
at war with civilization, and injurious
I, the prosperity and happiness OF our


common country. 1t has in many


cases enabled individuals to wreal
+ vengeance for private griefs, at the


expense Of the peace and order OF the
community, and the life probably o


the innocent. The Sentinel will up


hold the majesty Of the laws; beIlev


ing that they ought only to be dis
pensed with in extreme cases, whel
= public liberty and life are threatened
: by organized bands of conspirators
! The Sentinel will endeavor TO pre-
l. sent its readers with such views a
y will aid in developing the resource
I and increasing the wealth and pros
: perity of the State. Its columns Wi
y be open at all times TO the mechapb
: las well rs the merchant or plantsT
= and every class of citizens when thcl
! rights and interests are assalled, caT
!, present iheir grievances to the pubic
through the Sentinel.
Il A portion Of the paper will be dc
Ivoted to literature, notices oi new
works, &c. +,


A portion of advertising and Jat


work is expected."

 ADIEU TO BANTAM MILL.

 BY FANNY slGALLEY.

 The time has come when we must part

 Nor does it little grieve my heart

 To leave my friends in Bradleyvle,

 Likewise old Bantam Paper Mill.

 Adieu. old Bantam MiIl adieu!

 Oft shall weep to think of you;

 But never hope to see thee more

 Until the Jackson times are OCT.

 When Tories cease their great command,

 And Whiggery reigns through all the land.

 I'll then return to Bradleyville,

 And cdll on thee, old Bantam Mill.

 Fresh courage take, my honest friends,

 Nor daunted be by Jackson men;

 And may this Mill for ever be

 A place to shout for Whggery.

 Stand to your posts, and never fear,

 Though Jackson men may scof and snecr;

 Poor blinded souls. could they but sec,

 They too would shout for Whiggery.

 Candor.-The New-York Times, speaking of the recent election returns says -"" Our opponents are in fine spirits and claim the whole South and Vest With how much justice time can only tell. That they have beaten us handsomely, we believe there cannot be doubt. Defeat is unpleasant, but we must learn to bearit, and then painful as it is We have done our best Angels could do no more""

 Profitable Employment once asked what you could expect of House of Commons which pro posed to relieve the ds,resses of the people by employ ing men to dig holes and then paying for filling them up again? This has been very much the employ men of the American Congress for the last four or five years. Gen. Jackson, with their assistance kept the people busy in digging holes; and they must now go to work and fill them up again.-N. Y Courier.

 Sudden Death-On Monday last, as one of the sta ees from the West was approaching Cearspring in this county, an Irshman sitting the road side. ask ed permission of the driver to ride few miles, he felt unwen. The permission was granted, and the man placed himself on the top of the stage After driving two three miles, the stage stopped and the driver shook the man by the shoulder supposing him to be asleep; but discovered to his astonshment and horror that he was dead. We have not learned the name or residence of the deceased -Hagerstorn (Afd.) Courier

From Tompkins county and Chenango county, in our State, and we believe the same is true ot all parts ofthe State, the gloomy anticipations of the farmers are all dispersed. The Ithaca Herald says that |"" the recent fair weather and gentle rains had materially improved the appearance of the wheat fields; and we are , informed by farmers from every town, that at least an average crop may be confidently relied upon. It is estimated that one third more seed has been sown this year, in the country, than there ever was at any former period"" The Oxford Republican, Chenango county, says that The farmers ofthis coun- ty are largely, and some of them almost ex- cIusively engaged in grazing. So far as the crop of grass is concerned their prospects were never more fiattering. The 4 half days of rain, already in this month, has load ed the meadows and covered the pastures with luxuriant crop; the rainy season has likewise improved the winter grain and brought forward the summer wheat, barley, oats and potatoes. The corn, on the low, moist fields has been injured on account of the great abundance of rain, still it is not un- healthy. In past seasons, we have known it to look on the lst day of July not as we'll on the same fields as it does at the present time, when it harvested forty bushels to the acre. The important wool crop has come off unusu- ally well, heavy, and free from cot and stain.'' The Cortland Republican says the wheat and grain corps look we'll. From New-Jersey we learn that the farmers are preparing to cut their grass, as soon as the weather will permit; and such crop of hay as will be made, has never before been known. Of wheat and rye, the crop will be double that of the last season-they are both filling aston- ishingly well. The harvesting, it is thought, will not commence till about the middle of July, twelve days later than usual. In the western part of Pennsylvania the crops of grass, corn, potatoes, sc. generally present a promising appearance, and that west of the Susquehanna tie wheat is unusually fine.- A full crop of the latter, they think, may be expected in that section of the State.

 In Virginia the season has been uncom- monly favorable, for a few weeks past, to the wheat-and the crop will be much better than was anticipated. It was injured by the winters frost, and the fly early in the spring and in the valley of Virginia, particularly in the great wheat counties of Augusta, Berke- ly, Jeffersoa Fauquier, &c., it will be con- siderably cut short-but in other parts ofthe state it has rallied-and favored as it has re- gently been by the cool and damp weather, will produce good harvest. The products on some estates will be very fine-and the quality every where is excellent-perhaps seldom better. We learn also more favorable accounts from all the Western States. In Maine, where bounty of 10 cents bushel is given for raising every twenty bushels, it is thought the wheat crop will be sufficient to supply the entire wants of the state.

 The Crops-We have before us accounts of the state of the crops in Maryland, Virgin ia, and Connecticut, which are no less favor- able than that which we had already publish cd from Ohio and other parts of the Union, as we'll as from the interior part of our own State. Private letters, however, have been received which state that the newspaper re- ports are congregations, and that the prom, ises of superabundant crops in this State arc not so favorable as they are represented to be. We trust that the printed accounts will prove correct. We feel sanguine that they will, because the recent accounts refer to the late warm weather as having had surprising influence. The late plentiful showers have wonderfully brought forward the small grain. The stalks of Rye have full and perfect heads in southern fields, where, at an early period of the season, they were considered so un- promising that the farmers thought of plough ing them up. Clear and dry weather is all that is now needed to bring forward any NuCIC dt lCtlSL u Auifs dSCltSC SLOps-4Us

 Mississippi and Arkansas.-In consequence Ofthe cali for an extra session of Congress, Governor Lynch has ordered an election for members from that State, (two) to take place on the Sd Monday of the presentmonth. For the same reason Governor Conway, of Ar kansas has appointed the 2d Monday of the present month for the choice of a Represen- tative from that State. In Mississippi the members chosen will hold office only till the regular election, which commences on the 6 first Monday in November.

He then dabbled in lot speculations at Hamilton, and bought prop erty to the amount of many thousands, (prob- ably $6O.OOO) on which he was busily en- gagged with many hands, in making improve ments, when arrested.

 m to make bad worse-but the merchants are only bent, and seldom break.

 Our attention has been called to what may De termed this remarkable pliancy of Amer lcan enterprise, by contrasting it with what we now see in London and Liverpool. A little panic seizes upon the merchants there, and what an alright there is! How the post chaises fly! How the merchants groan Even the Bank of England is in commotion! But what a feather ofpressure have the Eng fish merchants suffered in comparison with ours! The Government of England is the friend of the mercantile and manufacturing classes. The Government of the United States is their most bitter enemy. When diff faculties crowd upon the English merchants the Government ruSheS to the rescue-but when difficulties fall upon our merchants, the Government comes with specie humbugs, Treasury Circulars, and the like nonsense of blockhead politicians; but the merchants spring above, and defy the Government, and all it's power; and though they may not grow rich, the Government opposing them, yet they add to the industry and resources Cf the country, and some men, nevertheless, are made Princes by their labors.

 When this city was consumed so fearfully by fire, the merchants of this city did not des- pond for an hour. ""Go to work and build it up again."" was the universal resolution.- A blow fell upon this city, yesterday, Che news of several failures in New Orleans) which struck all aback for moment, but only for moment. Every tongue was in street, as it fell upon the pile of ruins of what was to be the Joseph's Bank, thought of some- thing ominous- nobody was appalled,. ""Courage,"" was the word in every mans mouth. All hoped that the calamity would not fall upon such princcly- hearted men as the Josephs-but if come it must, "" ""courage' was the word. But the Josephs never des- paired for moment. They knew their strength, and they had the courage to meet the crisis.-N. Y. Express.

 NEW ORLEANS, March 7.

 Steamboat Burnt-About half past 7 last evening the steamboat Rob Roy, Dunsted, master, just arrived from Louisville, laden with flour, lard, &tc. took fire at the Poydras street wharf, and was burnt to the waters edge in the short space of three quarters of an hour. No lives lost. The fire broke out in the stern of the boat, and spread SO rapidly that the officers lost nearly all their trunks. The Rob Roy was an old vessel, and noted for killing several persons by the bursting of boiler last year at Columbia, on the Missis- sippi. We have not learned whether she was insured or not.

 The Virginia House of Delegates have pas sed two bills we think very popular. One making the election for members of Congress and the Legislature to take place on the same day throughout the state. The other caus- ing the Legislature 10 meet on the lst Mon day in January, instead of the lst Monday in December. The Senate have passed the bill relative to the elections, and it becomes a law. They take place throughout the state on the fourth Thursday in April.

 Horrid, FIen1zike.- The Harrsburgh Chron- icle gives an account of young girl fourteen or fifteen years of age, who had come to that place in search of employment, being enti- ced into den of infamy by--what shall we say, q brute! No, we will not disgrace the brute creation by acomparison--a PEND, who told her he knew of a family who would be glad to employ her; and when he had thus induced the unsuspecting child to follow him into his hell, he set about the accomplish ment of her ruin. Her screams brought to CT fiends, whose united strength accomplish ed, amid her agonizing groans and heart rem ding screeches, their hellish purpose, each in turn playing Tarquin.

 Language is inadequate to utter the feel ings which such a transaction must rouse in the bosom of every human being. If ever Lynching were justifiable, it is in this case. Hanging is too good, and too honorable a mode of death for such miscreants, who have so disgraced the human shape. The Govern or has offered reward of one hundred dol lars for each of their arrest, if within the State, and two hundred dollars if taken with out the State. (Six of them have been ap-: prehended)

 Mysterious. large story has been in cir the body of female, richly dressed, orna- mented, &c., having arrived in the stage, boxed up, and of course, supposed to have been wickedly murdered. The true story, we believe, is this: One day last week, q large trunk arrived by the Transportation Line from New Haven, upon which no di- rection was found. This trunk was suppo- sed to answer the description of one lost a short time ago, and advertised for by MT. Curtis, firm of Curtis, Callender & Wells.- MT. c. went to the office, and found that the key of the lost trunk, (which did not belong to MT. c. himself, the key having been lett with him) fitted the one now found. MT. Curtis opened the trunk, when To! what should meet his eyes, but the dead body of man some 30 or 40 years of age, doubled up and squeezed in! One of our physicians was sent for, to know if he could explain the why and wherefore of the strange affair. He said he did know something about it-and up-- on further examination, direction was found upon one end of the trunk, to physician in Northampton. It came from New York; Mir. Curtis was pretty we'll satisfied that it was not the article he.wanted, and it was for warded according to direction.-Han'd Co~.

 arrived last evening from St. Augustine We learn that on Saturday night seventeen

 Indians, (4 men and 1S women) two wives ot

 Powel and his sister, with forty negroes, ar. | rived at St. Augustine from Picolata. They

 were sent down from Volusia by Gen. Jesup

 Gen. Hernandez had gone to Indian river.

 A correspondent of the Republican (at

 Garey's Ferry, Dec. 2d,) furnishes the sub- joined paragraphs. He expresses an opinion that Wild Cat, alias Co-a-coo-chee, who re- gently escaped with eleven other Indians from the fort at St. Augustine, joined Sam Jones in thirty hours after their escape from confne- ment.-Sauannah Georgian

 ""Some three days ago, two of Powell's wives, five warriors, ten women, eleven chil- dren and thirty-five negroes came into Fort Mellon. Except the negroes, they are Pow clt's people, and have been sent by Gen. Jes- up to St. Augustine. They could not have been Wild Cat or any of the eleven, or I think they would not have come in-as it was, they had to run away from the hostiles {; they were nearly naked and appeared in want It is said by many that the Indian de- puta.ion may bring them in. But again Sam Jones is known to be hostile; he is sup posed to be twenty six miles from Fort Mel lon with a large body of warriors, and to sur round and catch him is next to an impossibil- ity, us it is country only known 60 him and his. aat

 The five hundred and thirty Tennesseeans who came here day before yesterday, are ordered to leave on Monday, to cross at Pi- colata and SCOUT the country on that side of the river, up to Fort Mellon. The troops and persons in Florida are very healthy-much more so than could be expected fl om so ma- nv strangers being suddenly brought into this country, which is not very good one.-4 From Volusia all the way up, there are or. ange trees, filled with tue finest kind of or- anges, though they are sour.

 4 Touching Incident.-A few sabbaths ago. as the bells were ringing for the afternoon service, in New-York, singular procession was seen passing one of the squares. A fe- male, with the coffin of a child apparently three or four years old on her bead, with a little girl carrying a wooden cross painted white with black spots, by her side, led the procession. Six men followed. next five children, and last fifteen or twenty women dressed with large white caps, without bon- nets. With very rapid step, thus led, white cloth being thrown across the coffin, this singular procession moved to the burial of their dead in a strange land. They were Germans.-Porlland Trans.

 M11LEpeEv1LLE, Nov. 16, 1e37.-A novel and interesting incident occurred in the House of Representatives this morning. One of the Bibb members presented memorial from Robert Beasley, stating, that some few years ago he purchased of slave trader a negro woman and her sucking child-not doubting but that the woman was its mother. Subsequent developments, however, had convinced him that an imposition had been practiced upon him in the sale of the child that instead of being born of slave, it was the offspring of a achite aOoneon from whom it had been stolen, or who had abandoned 1t The object of the memorial was, to move the Legislature to change the name of the found- ling from that of William Gas known in the bill of sale of the slave trader,) to that of William Crockett Beasley-and to restore to him the natural rights of which he had been unjustly deprived.

 A thrill of admiration passed through the House. Mir. Beasley was in the lobby and held up the child in his arms-a fairer, pret- tier, more intelligent looking boy, need nev- CT be desired. Many an old bachelors mouth watered The House went into com- mittee of the whole, had the child in the midst of them, and every one we believe was satisfied of his whiteness and his title to his freedom.-Macon Ts1egrarh.

 Lunch Law.-On Tuesday evening the 25th ult. it was reported at the town of War; ren, Ky. that an individual who lives about Q mile from that town, had whipped his wife most unmercifully, and that she was not eX- pected to live. This of course, raised con- siderable excitement among the citizens, and some time after dark, number of persons went and brought the individual to town. A sham trial was held over him, Judge Lynch presiding, and the unfortunate prisoner was sentenced to be stript, tied to post, and to receive one hundred lashes with raw hide which sentence was immediately put into execution.

 We understand that communication has been addressed by the Secretary of State of the United States, by direction of the Presi dent, to the Governor of this State, request ing his attention to any movements, growing out of the present contest in the Canadas, that may violate the laws of the U. States, passed to preserve the relations of amity with foreign powers and fulfil the obligations of our treaties with them, and requesting also his prompt interference to arrest the parties concerned, if any preparations are made ofa hostile nature against any foreign power in amity with the United States. Similar con- munications have been addressed to the Ex- ecutives of Vermont and Michigan, and to the District Attorneys and marshals of those States and of this.-Albany Argus.

The peculiar institutions of the South
and the present crisis, require energy, in.
intelligence and organization on the part oI
the People. Tho wealth and luxury u
Rome only stimulated the rapacity and Ov-

not only, individually, become acquainted
with the rights and interests Of the South,

Though there are times and circumstan-
ces when the law may be dispended with,
and SUMMARY punishment be rcsOrted 10.
yet we are convinced that Lynch law has
become quite too common all over the
country. II has excited furious and SAN
culinary spirit al war with civilization, and
injurious to the prosperity and happiness Of
our common country. lthas in many cases
enabled individuals to wFeak vengeance
for private griefs, at the expense Of the
peace and order ofthe community, and the
life, probably, Of the innocent. The Senli-

believing that they ought only ,pbs dis

 A Woman Kidr,apped, Tarred and Feather

 ed!-We learn from the Thompson, Conn.,,

 Gazette, that most disgraceful outrage was

 perpetrated on a female at Mansfield, on

 Monday night the Sd ult. The female, it is stated, is a resident of Middletown, and was on a visit to her friends in Mansfield. On the evening above named, she was seated in her parents house, in company with an in- dlvldual who was paying her his addresses, when several disguised persons made their appearance and conducted themselves in such manner as to excite the ire of the fe- males companion, who began to show fight.

 He was quickly overpowered, however, by numbers, and detachment of the lynches kept guard over him, out of doors, with arms in their hands. The others then seized the female, and to drown her cries and screams, turned her clothes over her head, where they were held, and in that condition forced to some distance from the house to a place where they had prepared quantity of tar for their purpose. Arrived there they com- menced their diabolical operations, and completely tarred the female from her waist downwards. They then applied quantity of Sacingled to,0 in lieu of feathers after which manly transactions, they decamped, like brave men as they were, and left the abused woman to find her way to assistance as best she might. The only excuse which those villains have to offer for an act so dis graceful to themselves and their neighbor- hood generally is, that they were suspicious of the wonlan's svirtue.-Nor.hampto Courier

 ""Outrage upon Outrage.""-A humiliating scene, in all its lights, recently occurred in Memphis, Tennessee. A woman of i'll fame in that place followed highly respectable widow lady with cowhide, through the street, with the avowed intention of using it upon the latter. whose offence consisted in hoNlllS CAplCSSCu thC OpluAoll tA0t t1c NlFdSO had harbored one of her servants. Had not the lady taken refuge in shop, from her pur- suer, the fell purpose of the latter might have been accomplished. Such an attempt neces- sarily produced great excitement, and as is but too common in these attitudes and latter days, the people were impatient of the slow process of the law, and took the affair into their own hands. In the evening, as we learn from the Memphis Gazette, ""a crowd of re- spectable gentlemen repaired to the house of the culprit, which was ""raZed to the ground"" During the attack a gun was fired from the house, which severely wounded one of the assailants. When the circumstances became generally known next morning, it produced still greater excitement against the offenders. A public meeting was held, and resolution adopted, for placing the obnoxious individuals in an open boat without an oar, and set them adrift in the middle of the Mis- sissippi. The meeting then constituted itself a connnalttee for carrying the resolution into effect, which it did according to the letter. Thus was one deep wrong, by an outcast of society, followed by the commission of an other wrong. When again shall we cessc to hear of the outrages, and summary punish ments, and live once more under the reign of the laws?

 Quite Sensuire fellop.-A singular affair has just occurred at St. Louis. One Edward Densley was found dead in the vicinity ot that place some weeks ago under circum- stances which induced the belief that he died drunk. Densley, having respectable and in- fluential friends, the newspapers alluded to the cause rather delicately. But the Obser- yer, it seems, mentioned too many particulars to suit the sensitive nerves of the relations of the deceased, among others, that very sus- picious empty bottle was found in the gentle mans pocket, which smelt rather rummy, furthermore, stating that the corpse appeared very much bloated for ono of person who had died ofapoplcxy, and so forth. For this offence, MT. Jacob c. Densley, a brother of deceased. called upon the editor of the Ob- server, and demanded either an apology for the libel upon the dead man, or else the sat- isfaction of gentleman. The editor insist young Densley became rather impudent.- The knight ofthe quill thereupon gave him sound thrashing and put him in the street, Densley forthwith commenced suit at law for the libel, and another one for the thrash ing; so that our friend of the Observer will have his hands full of law for some time to come.-N.

 Federal and DemOcrat.- Henry CIay.--We observe that some of the administration presses pretend to revive these obsolete party distinctions, instead of assuming the only terms that mark present party divisions. Wig and IOTy-the friends of the People and the friends of the Crown-these are the proper distinctions. As to the Federal and Democrat-Mr. Clay gave the best account of that matter in his speech on the Protest

 It was in reply to Mr. Senator Grundy. who had been amusing himself with tue divisions Which he described in the ranks of the Op- position for MT. Grundy is so easily amused, that his own speeches entertain himself as much as they fatigue his audience. MT. Clay retorted to the observations of MT. Grundy with his usual felicity. It was obvi- ous, he said, under the circumstances des- cribed by the Senator, that nothing but a deep and solemn sense of impending dangers could have united in one common cause, per- sons entertaining such a diversity of views as to the proper administration of public af- fairs. g1a :aats ai

 ""The Senator,"" he continued, ""assigns to the opposition the Federal Party. Of all the political parties that have existed in this country, I have before said what l believe, that in the main they have been honest and patriotic. That may be affirmed of the Fed eral party as ofany other. The cause which produced the ancient divisions of the People into Federal and Republican parties have since ceased to operate, and it is unjust and ungenerous to endeavor to preserve or affix the denomination for party purposes. The Federal party was, indeed, supposed to lean more than their opponents did, to a strong and energetic Executive and in that respect the Administration party of the present day may be pronounced to be more Federal than their opponents. The original causes having ceased, the Federal party has divided itself between the two parties of the present day. The better portion of h anited soith US, and the aoorse aoith the Senator and his friends. will add that of all the politicians in this or any other country, some of the Federalists who united with and adhere to the Jackson party, are the most destestabe. They appear to obligation, and principle, which should bind men to their country and society,""

 A Jake stoyy-good and tYue.-A friend of mine built good schooner, and through the request of the master workman, and present. ation of set of colors, she was christened "" Thomas H. Benton"" She cannot get a load in any port in Lake Erie, even when there is freight to send, and the way she is jeered with ""T. H. Benton,"" flying at her mast head when in harbor, is caution are you loaded with yellow boys, will you take load of sinners to Missouri, and so on-her owner says he is in danger of being Lynched, and as her name cannot be altered, except by an act of Congress, it has been suggested that he draw black lines around the magic name, and write upon the flag ""expunged.""

Major Lengbow, of the Courier and Enquirer, find
ing that its afidavts shilling oath, don't suc-
ceed in convincing the public of his immense circua-
tion offers to make bet of $500. to be deposited in
the Trust Company, that he does not tell the lies in
the columns Of his delectable paper Good. But hear
the gallant Colonel himself


""Let them depose one or FIVE hundred dollars in
the Trust Company-we will place there similar
sum. Then let the Express name respectable per-
ssh, we will name another-the two will appoint
third, and the three thus agreed uPon shall have
cess to the books of both establishments, and make
report to the public. If our statement was not cor
rect then let our money be paid over to the Orphan
Asylum-h on the contrary, we stated nothing but
the truth and the denals of the Express false then
let their dePose be paid to the same Institution""


Very well, very well. But before the gallant editor
spends his money in laying wagers, that he does tell
lies by the bushel, suppose he pay up his differences
to Mr.. Lynch-also keep portion to pay the damages
ae mean to inflict upon him for his rows Let him
leave the Orphan Asylum to our care.


BuRcnARDIsM-A scamstress and stockmaker, be-
fore the advent of Jedediah Burchard in New York,
was honest industrious, and earned respectable live
lihood. few weeks ago, she went to Chatham
street Chapel got fascinated by Jedcdiah-neglected
her work. went day and night to enjoy the religious
excitement there and by thus neglcctng her calling,
is now reduced to beggary and ruin by that mpostor.
This is only sample Of thousands of poor females,
who have been nvegled from honest pursuits to spend
their time in praying, canting, and committing sin.
Burchard is a perfect nuisance. His wife is worth
hearing She is rather pretty woman, and breaches
like an apostle. Weadvise every body to 60 to Chat
