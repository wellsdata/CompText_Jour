Farmers are queer sort OF folks.
As soon as they hear that pork is going
down in market, into town they rush and
try to engage theirs before it gets down
any lower, and so they help to make the
market duller by overstockiDg ii, whereas,
if they would stay bone, il would not be
long before butchers would be coming
to them and bidding up the prices. This
suits the butchers who help TO growl and
run the prices down, while they expect
TO double their money invested. There
is no reason why pork should be so low
in price, except the panickey pressure
made by the farmers themselves.

'seventy.five"" In its place. In the second par

adopted the average required In the eemen-
tary branches to get u permanent certificate
will be seventy-tive instead of eighty, as now,
and the time for the study Of higher branch
es will be three years instead OF two, as now.
The effect will be to make the examinations
somewhat less difficult than they have been
the last two years. These amendments do
not in any way change the examinations OF
persons applying for positions as teachers in
our schools.


Action was on motion deferred until
next meeting.


The committee on No. 8 to whom
was referred the extension of the facil-
tiles of the building reported the mat

resolution.


Resolved, That the Committee of No. 8 is
requested to fill all vacanciestn said school
by promotions from the various grades, and
also that the committee transfer all scholars
that live near and belong to other schools.


This also caused considerable discus
sion which resulted in the resolution
being laid on the table.

city, through Mr.. Conrad, presented a
paper on ""halt time education"" 1t
was referred to Messrs. Conrad, Brown
and Morrow with instructions to have it

The Committee of No. II school asked |
for new heater. This caused more
which resulted in the COM
mittees being instructed to purchase a
new one.


Mr.. Baird asked for permission to
open No. school 20 minutes before 2
,'clock, from the lst Of November to
The 1st of March. The cause was the
of the children to see. The
)ther members of the Board objected
unless it be made general.


The motion was postponed for two
weeks.

Lally providing that hereafter Ill re-
luisitions for stationery be referred

at Union Hall Church, in this county.
An immense crowd was in attendance
1t had been arranged that the Rev.
Robert Cook, of Lynchburg, should
conduct the funeral services, but when
the concourss Of relatives snd friends
of the deceased got in the church they
found strange preacher in the pulpit.
The Society of the Sisters of Sarah, to
which the deceased had belonged, in
sisted on having the Rev. Mr.. Cook,
while the relatives demanded that the
preacher in the pulpit should go on,
and 80 ordered him. The parties
threatened to pitch the preacher out of
the window. Then fierce fight took
place in the church, in which both men
and women joined. In the struggle the
coffin was knocked over and the corpse
thrown out on the floor. This horrible
81 sht did not stop hostilities, but the
relatives fought until they drove every
member ofthe society out of the church.
1t was then that the preacher had fled,
aud the burial took place without a
preacher. Several parties were Sc

On motion of Ingalls, res0lu-
tion was adopted calling on the
Preside TO communicate to the
Senate what measures have been
taken to prevent the occupation of
the Indian Territory by white set
tiers.


The House bill, to prohibit mill.
tary interference In elections, was
read twice, and by O vote of ""a
against 81, the Senate disagreed to
the motion Of Edmunds to refer 1t
the Com mittee on Judiciary, and
then laid it on the table to be called
up hereafter.


Consideration was then resumed
Of the resolution asking for author
ity to take testimony in the con-
tested case of Spofford against Kel.
logg, and Carpenter continued his
remarks in support of Ksllogg'f
right to the seat.


HOUsE-Chalmers called up, as q
question Of privilege, the resolu.
ton offered by him for an investi'
CATION or mis- conduct at Fort Pill
low, and made u personal explana.
tion.


The subject occupied the atten-
ton of the House for o long time
and at one period there were indi.
cations of trouble between Chal.
mers and Burrows, in consequence
Of an allusion made by Chalmers
to some criticisms against Burrows
for his own conduct in the war
Chalmers, however, disclaimed any
personal knowledge on the subject,
saying he had his Information from
a Washington newspaper.


Burrows branded the allegation
as utterly untrue. Finally the
whole subject was laid On the ia
BILE.


The EIght-hour law went over on
the expiration Of the morning hour,
and the bill relating to coinage and
coin and bullion certificates, was
taken up and ClaflIn spoke in op'

and said 1t was called before the

country. The South is the home
Of the colored people, and they
should not be urged to leave 1t un-
less with very good reason. But he
should not advise them to remain
where they were not well treated.
He urged calmness, and said when
all classes see their mistakes they
will perhaps come together and
heal past differences. Good will
and friendship will prevail, and
the South will prosper.

A despatch from Syracuse, N. Y, is as
follows:


Charles A. Freeman has been arrested
at CanandaigLa for wrecking the New
York Genital passenger train at that
Dlace, at mldHlght, the Orb inst. The
train that was thrown from the track
left here at o'clock p. IN. heavily laden
with passengers.


At the point above indicated the en-
gine struck an obstruction and was
throw over an embankment intO an
adjoining field and broken 10 pieces.-
The baggage Car was also thrown from
the track and destroyed. Two passenger
coaches also left the track, but fortunat-
ely were not turned over, and the pas
sengers Were but slightly injured The
engineer and firemen crawled out from
beneath the wreck Of tho engine and
were not badly hurt. An examination
of the obstruction showed that two ties
had first been placed cr0sswise ON the
rails and then braced by two others lying
at light angles and their ends resting
against the ties on which the track is
laid. Suspicion was directed against
Freeman, who was found lurking in the
vicinity. He was examined lat Saiur-
day and held for trial.


He made confession stating that he
alone was the cause of the wreck. He
declared that he had spite against the
whole Catholic race, and he was bound
to exterminate every man, woman and
child of that religion. He AYERS that the
train was loaded with Catholics, and his
object was to kill off the whole lot. His
family resides TT Chenango Forks,
Broome county. 1t is thought that he is
either insane or feigning to be so, to be
80, to escape the penalty of his erime.
The indignation against Freeman at
Canandaigua is intense, and there was
some talk of lynching him. He has been
lodged in .jAil."

St. Louis that on Sunday morning the
''Grand Tower"" OF the Anchor Line, ar
rived there having on board 500 Me-
groes who we're smigrating from Mis-
sissippi to Kansas. The report further
says that this 10 the third lot in the
last three weeks, and that the river
banks are lined with crowds anxious
to come and awaiting the first opportu-
nifty. The exodus Of the negroes from
the South need occasion no surprise,
a. it 10 the practical result Of the per-
secutions they have had to endure from
the rebel ""bulldoxers."" The district
which the ex-rebel Chalmers, OF Fort
Pillow massacre fame, misrepresents in
Congress, lies along the Mississippi
river, extending from the north to the
south end of the State OF Mississippi, a
distanc. Of about 800 miles. 1t is call
ed the ""shos string"" because it is long
and crooked and made so for the pur
pose of crowding the heavily settled
negro counties into one district, that
was conceded to them a. there was aud
is now at least IS, ,0G0 of Republican
majority in it, and the rebels them
selves never expected to carry it when
it was laid out. But thsdays of intimi-
dation came, and the White League
sprang mp in this black ""shoe string""
district, and if a colored man dared to
vot. Republican ticket, he did so at
the risk of having bullet put through
his head. Under these circumstances
the rebel Chalmers got himself a few
Thousand votes, and has pretended to
represent the district in Congress dur
ing the last session and is back again
in the present Congress. Instead of
the district being represented by John
W. Lynch who was once elected, or
SOM other intelligent colorsl man as
il should be, it is misrepresented by
Chalmers, the man who was the negro
butcher of Fort Pillow. This is but
one Congressional dstric: in the South
out Of many others that are similarly
situated, ard under the circumstances
It need not be thought strange that the
oo'ared men are seeking place where
they can enjoy that freedom Of thought
and action, and protection from tyran
ny and persecution which the consti-
..T..:3n cur nation guarantees, but
does not enforce. The disposition of
the colored peopls to leave the
South opens up quite another question
than that Of politics, and of more i'm
portance than the mere question o;
who shall represent district in Con-
grsss. The question of labor and the
cultivation OF cotton, rice and sugar
crops Of the South are apt 70 be effect.
ed by this negro exodus, and it is not
improbable that even the South will in
the not far future be advocating the
protection of the colored men in their
civil and political rights, rather than
to allow them to emigrate to the West

AUGUSTA, Dec. 29-It is the general opinion
that Governor Garceon will not submit to the Su-
preme Court the questions propounded by ex-Gov-
ernor Morrill,. The Republicans Will be prepared
for this. and will present the question through
majority OF the members of the last Senate. il is
thought such proceedings would conform with the
Law. The disposition is 10 exhaust every legal
means before others tried. o. ID. Baker applied
this forenoon at the Secretary of States office for
authority to examine the returns from Pennington,
and was refused by Councillor Fogg. Governor

afternoon 10 consult him in regard to proper police
force for preserving order the reasseDbling of
the Legislature. The Mayor had just finished "" rit-
ing a communication to his Excellency on the sub
ject, and conveyed it in person. Mayor Nash was
courteousy received. and he assured the Governor
that all needed preparations had been made for
keeping the peace. Two hundred policemen have
already been appointed, and this number will be in
creased If the exigences of the case require it.
The Mayor said he able to keep order, and beg
ged the Governor not to bring troops TO the capitol
or make preparations for artnng them. He said he
Thought the people of Au gAsta would bear him out
in these assurances. The Governor talked quite
freely, and informed the Mayor that he had great
dislike of the idea of bringing troops here and
should not do il if peace could be maintained In
any other way but il would be his duty to preserve
order and prevent interference with the members
of the Legislature. The interview closed here. and
the Mayor passed TO the Governor the following
communication:

the firing of pistols, guns and cannons


The proclamat. on however did much
good in the thiokIy populated parts o


the city where the police had a stric'
surveillance but in the outskirts very
little heed was paid to it.


Early Ill the morning many families
left the city, many Of them going uI
the Brandywine to enjoy the day, but
the greater part of them to take ride
on the railroad or some Of the steam.
boats that piled up and down the river
and bay. IL is estimated that not less
than 1900 people attended St. Paul's
Catholio Sunday School picnic at Mt.
Cuba, the cars on III. Delaware West
ern road being crowded all day. A very
pleasant time is said to have been ex-
perienced, and the affair was remuner.
ative to the school. Flags tloated from
al! the public buildings of the city,
and large number of private residen-
ces were decorated with flags and other
patriotic devices.


The large number OF drunken people
was particularly noticeable, and at
times the police station had quite a
! large Humber Of inmates, but it is
doubtful if the number of drunken
people was larger that on any other
Fourth. 1t is gratifying to know that
the number of fires and accidents is
small and that none of them resulted in
much injury to limb, or loss Of fproperty.
AS far as can be ascertained the follow
ing is the incidents Of the day:


THE MORAL sUAsIoN PICNIC.


Notwithstanding the fact that only
three days preparation had been given
to the NJ. S. R. A. Picnic scheme no
band had been engaged, no dancing
allowed, and only temperance speeches
and patriotic songs were promised as
""attractions,"" yet it was in its way a
grand success in bringing to their pic
mic grounds, Riddles woods, salts
factory representation of the religious
and temperance element of our city and
vicinity.


Early in the day the participants be-
gan to assemble and the morning was
passed in the enjoyment of various in
nocent games, swinging and strolling
around and patronizing the refresh-
ment stand, which latter was under
the able management of Messrs. G.
Bliss, 7: Lynch, R. Green, G. w. King,
A. Sanmons, and r. Elliott.


AT 3 O'Clock the assemblage was called
to order by the chairman, First Vice
President Morrow, who made few
opening remarks during which he said
that the Moral Suasion Reform Ass0cia,
tion had lately made another step in
the way of reform, as he thought he
could safely say that they now realized
that dancing rather retarded than ad-
their work. Father Tay lor then
made an impressive prayer, the large,
choir rendered one of their |
beautiful selections, and Rev. C. NJ.
Pegg was introduced as the irs. speak
er.


A neat speech of God speed to the
Association. and apt references to ""the
day We celebrate"" followed after which
Ii. +. Pickles rendered in grand man
ner our National anthem, ""Star Span
gled Banner"" the audience Joining in
the chorus. Rev. }. B. Mann was next
introduced, and telling speech was
made by the Rev. gentleman.


The Misses Roberts followed in
iuett, which being rapturously encored
hey returned and repeated part of
he same.


Major George W. Wells then made
he closing speech in his usual
Impressive manner, and after announce
nents OF future meetings of the asso-
iation by the chairman, the audience
dispersed to enjoy themselves in other
ways. At halt-past six the tired par
icipants wended their way to their
everal homes, we'll leased with the

Mr.. Paynter moved as an amend.
ment that the sum be given to them as
q donation.


This Mr.. Taylor explained was con
trary to the charter and would be ille-
gal. Mr.. PayDter withdrew the amend.
ment and a discussion then followed
upon the merits Of the question.


The President placing Mr.. Lynch in
the chair took the floor and informed
the Council that the discussion had
taken wide range. In the third sec.
tion Of the charter and the following
section the contract is made and there
is DO law about it. The City Solicitor
gives his opinion, council listens to and
listens TO 1t respectively and then does
as it pleases. The salary of the Off
Ger cannot be increased or decreased
at the time Of his official occupation.


He thought that if the report of the
Law Committee giving the whole Board
OF Revision 1900 should be adopted it
would be discredit to the city.


Theayes and nays were called as fol-
lows:

Nays-Evans, Guthrie, Hart, Heust-
ed, knight, Lynch, McGlinchey, Moore,

The motion was lost and Council ad-
journed.

RIsBMoED, Va, March 16.-MB. Bac-
cagalupo, who was SO atrociously and


bruially stabbed by her husband last
night with intent TO murder, still sur
wives, though without hope OF recovery.
The eleven wounds she received were
| staunched, but 1t Is scarcely posi- BILE that
the most careful medi ,ai attention can
save her, a. several Of the stabs are con-
sidered fatal The attempted murder cre-
ates the most intense excitemdnt among
the Italian residents Of the city among
whom both parties are well known.
DETAILS OF THE sTABBINs.
It has transpired to-day that the mo-
tive OF Baccigalupo, who had married
the woman two weeks ago. was to quietly
rid himself OF her and at the same time
obtain possession OF her money and prop
erty, amounting to some few thousand
dollars. In order to accomplish this de-
sign he bought q ticket TO Washington
and announced to his wife that he WAS
going to Illinois, to be absent for four
months. He took his baggage aud left by
the morning train, but upon reaching
Milford, sixty miles from here, he got
on and returned late in the evening by =
freight train.


THR MURDERoUs ATTACK.


Upon arriving he went secretly to the
store, decoyed his wife out down the
street and around The corner to dark
recess on the canal basin bank, where he
made the murderous attack. He attempt
ed to throw the unfortunate woman into
the canal after stabbing her, but did not
succeed, and he was forced TO jump In
and swim to the opposite bank himselfin
the effort to escape. The police, how
ever, secured him a. he emerged from
the water. His object, only thus partially
carried out, was to leave town ""a he did,
publicly, come back secretly, kill his
wife, go of and then return again when
he heard Of her murder, and thus avert
suspicion from HI mself. The greatest ex-
cstement prevails, and numerous express
sions Of desire to lynch him have been
made."

 San Francisco was deeply agitated by the shooting of the Rev. Isaac s. Kal- Ioch, the Workingmen's candidate for Mayor, on Saturday morning. Having refused to retire from the canvass, Charles De Young, the senior proprietor of the San Francisco Chronicle, threat- ened to expose his career in Boston and in Kansas. MT. Kalloch retaliated by applying 8 coarse epithet to De Young's mother at 8 meeting on Friday evening. Next morning De Young drove to the door of the Metropolitan Temple, and sending for Mir. Kalloch, shot him in the breast and thigh, inhicting dangerous wounds. The people were disposed to take summary vengeance, but waited for the arrival of Kearney, who at a great meeting held in the Sand Lots persuaded them to refrain from violence. Prepara- tions were made to quen disturbance, which it was expected would follow the shooting.

 Two men were lynched at Trinidad, Col. Last week man named Connack attempted to rape four-year-old girl. Dan Logan made similar attempt on g six -year-old girl. Both men were i'm prisoned, and both were called upon by body of 200 men and taken out to an old corral and hanged.

Mr.. R. H. Taylor had no particular
objection to having it read, but he also
was very anxious to save the contest
ants from suits for damages, etc. He
also stated that the papers publishing
the list of names laid themselves open
to suits for libel.


Mr.. Msrris Taylor was willing to
have it read and he had no objection to
publishing the names it contained. He
didn't care II they were spread broad
cast to the world.


Mr.. Rodney was willing to have the
names of the illegal voters suppressed
but he again asked for the reading OF
the petition.


Mr.. McGlinchey was Of the opinion
that Mr.. Evans had gotten himself in
to trouble, and he wanted to save Mr..
Gawthrop from the same fate.


Mr.. Chandler thought that the petit
ton should be read. If Mr.. Gawthrop
was cheated out Of his seat, he had a
right to petition for justice. If there
was danger Of the petitioner getting
into trouble, that was his business and
not Councils. 1t struck him rather
peculiarly to see his Democratic
friends so careful of the interests Of Re-
publican contestants.


The motion to dispense with the read

Mr.. Rodney moved that Monday even

she was not the woman he had transacted business
for, and that she not the woman who hsi called

been In his employ fifteen months; that she had

sorry to lose her but could not think of retaining
her after all this notoriety.

Girl.


In the REPUBLICAN, of Tuesday we al
luded to the binding over of Street
Commissioner Lynch before Esquire
Hagany on the charge OF having be-
trayed a young woman who had been
employed at the City Hospital. In
yesterdays paper we stated that Mr..
l.. branded the proceeding as an effort
TO levy blackmail upon him. This led
us to investigate the matter, and in
that investigation we procured evi-
dence to prove that the City Hospital
has been for months past the scene of
the most disgraceful proceedings, in
which members of both political par
ties have participated.


City officials have debauched them
selyes time and again and sacrificed in
their drunken orgies every feeling of
honor and self respect. The response
bility for these outrageous proceedings
rests in great measure on the former
members of the Hospital committee at
the head of which stood Louis p. Lynch.
Sunday after Sunday the members of
the committee with their friends as
sembled at the institution to pass their
time in drinking and social converse.
Even had the wines and liquors been
furnished at their own expense they
had no right to resort to a public insti-
tuition on the Sabbath tor such pur-
pose. 1t is positively stated that the
refreshments served on these occasions
were bought at public expense, and
the bills were passed by the City Coun-
Gil with the full knowledge of the en-
tire committee, if not of majority Of
the members of that body.


Time and tins again we referred
to these exorbitant bills but the only
answer We received was that the
""liquors were for the use ofthe patients
at the hospital"" AS to the truth Of
this stat ement we gave no judgement
tut now say that we are prepared to
show that the liquors were not used
for the well-being of the patients but
were taken there to be consumed by
city officials from the highest down.
ward.


These orgies there through last
winter were frequent, and in addition
to them, at irregular intervals, the
officials and their friends would have
an oyster supper. Frolic and fun
would be the spirit Of the hour, which
spirit was enthused by too frequent
potations of drink, would, as the time
advanced, generally culminate into a
midnight revel, breaking up late in the
morning. In fact it is positively stated
that in several instances some OF the
bachanals were carried to bed, and
left there to sleep of the effects OF their
debauch.


In order to be concise we will give
few incidents by which the public
may know just how far these public
outrages have been permitted to go on.
When Evan Rice the Brandywine
Bank defaulter was released from Jail on
bail, just previous to his trial, the
event was celebrated by a big ""set-
out"" at the Hospital. As usual the city
officials were present and none were
more active than was Mr.. Rice himself.
The entire committee was there and a
number of others. The Superinten-
dent and his family did not receive am
pie notice and consequently there was
not the usual extraordinary array of
roast turkey and chickens. Dinner
begun at one o'clock. There was
plenty of ""the stuff"" present however,
and of this they all partook so literally
that by eleven o'clock the company
was pretty we'll soaked. Many of them
however, were wise enough to forsee
the result and they had conveyances
at the door to take them to their
homes.


On the Saturday evening following
the date on which the CityCouncil went
to Dover in a body the city officials had
another grand drunk, and the same old
party were present.


On another occasion there was anoth-
Or evening social at the institution, at
which there was full attendance. At
his party it was determined among
hem to make certain Republican so
Trunk that his powers of locomotion
would be seriously impeded. Whether
I was their own indiscretion or the
superior carrying capacity Of that gen
.leman that caused the effect, we are
Unable to say, but be it as it may the
whole party got drunk and the Repub-
ican was the first to start home.


To say that the same parties were
present at every gathering would be
most too sweeping. They might have
,een but we have no authority to say
hat they were. Among the names
handed us as being visitors were most
If the city officials. The frequent Wis

nittee led to the betrayal of the young

the disposal of our Society large invoice of
clothing, for distribution among the fever
sufferers, and twenty six families were supplied
therefrom.


Our Society is also under obligations to tt Q
New Orleans Gas Company and it's generous
officers for q donation of one hundred and fifty
barrels of coke for the poor under our imme-
date care, which, with the clothing above
mentioned, has tended to greatly alleviate the
suffs sripgs of the benefoiaries during the severe
cold Of the present winter.


Donations of money were received from the
Catholic Relief Association and from Hon. j.
Pierrepont Morgan, of New York, much of which
was used in the purchase of wearing apparel
and bed clothing for the poor, and by which
>. eigbty-six families were supplied-underwear,
shoes and blankets being the principal articles
distributed-st cost of $303 55; besides which
the Society distributed in cash for relief Of the
/ fever suffsrers, through it's members and the
: Conference of st. Vincent de Paul, $526 so.
, The total number of families relieved by this
, means was over two hundred, and relief was
, continued to them for six weeks consecutively;
all the families being visited regularly at their
homes, where their wants were fully ascertain
ed before relief in money or clothing was
granted them.


Looking back over onr years work, We can
not but feel thankful to Almighty God fol
being made the instruments in His hands il
alleviating some of the distress and suffering
visited upon our community during the pas
wear. The result should serve to stimulate oul
members to even greater Efforts in the future"

On Saturday, De Young called Kalloch out of his study, and shot him twice; once in the thigh, and once through the lungs. A crowd assembled, and was kept from hanging De Young with the greatest difficulty. Luckily Kearney advised leaving the prisoner to the law, or riot and lynching would have been almost certain to have ensued. The Chronicle has made itself extremely obnoxious by indecent personal attacks, and popular feel ing was very strongly against it's editors. At last reports Kalloch was doing well, with a fair prospect of recovery."

action, any more than that it is strug-
gle for the Office of Street Commissioner,
which has become plum OF three
years standing, by Mr.. Lynch, a mem
ber of the City Council. No doubt Mr..
Lynch would make an excellent officer
if elected, but there is a strong growing
opposition to person coming into
Council as member for two or three
terms and then claim one Of the best
city offices as a recompence for services
rendered. The excellent social quail
ties. of Mr.. Lynch have made him gener-
ally popular with his party, but not with,
standing his qualifications two Demo
cratic members in the City Council.
Messrs. Hart and Paynter, members
from the Fourth Ward, emphatically
say they will not vote for him. In com,
ing to this conclusion they say they
would have no hesitation in voting for
Mr.. Lynch were he not member Of
the City Council, but while he is a
member of the body they cannot con-
scientiously support him. The defec-
ton of these two gentlemen, who on
this question vote with the Repub'i-
cans, makes a tie in the City Council,
| and was the occasion of much bad feel
| ing amongst the Democratic brethren
on Thursday nights session of Council
which extended until three o'clock on
Friday morning. The effort of the ses-
sion was to elect successor from the
Ninth Ward to the vacancy caused by
the death of Col. Rowe.


The whole of Thursday night and
Friday mornings session, was spent in
fruitless balloting, to elect Dorman the
vote each time being a tie. Wearied,
and some Of the members having pared
and gone home, the Council with the
requisite number left to transact the
business they We're engaged in, adjourn
ed until 10 o'clock TO. MORROW morning,
which, as it was then O'Clock on
Friday morning, many of the members
understood to mean 10 O'Clock on Satur-
day morning, and left with that impress
sion. Here was an advantage which
the quick eye of Mr.. Guthrie caught,
and, it is said, going up to the Clerk,
he got that gentleman to insert ""The
Fourth of july"" after the word ""to-
morrow"" Messrs. Paynter and Har,
and the Republicans not knowing of
the alteration which had been made,
were, Of course, not ON hand when
Council met yesterday morning, and
the pair between DR.. Walton end Mr..
Jones being annulled by the former no.
tifying the latter, the Democrats drum.
med up the requisite number to consti-
tute quorum, when with railroad
speed Mr.. Dorman was elected and
sworn into office, without any inquiry
as to his eligibility. This little tran
saction gave the Democrats a majority
OF one, including Mr.. Lynch himself,
who is expected to remain and vote for
himself for Street Commissioner, and af.
terwards resign. To this the city ordi-
nances present all etfectual bar, by
saying that no member of Council shall
vote upon a subject in which he is
personally interested. Mr.. Lynch being
intere sted in this question, it is rightly
claimed that he cannot vote for himself.
If he resigns there will be one short of
the number to elect, while Messrs.
Hart and Paynter hold out against Mr..
Lynch. The meeting Of City Coancil
this afternoon, is probably to reconnoitre
the position, and if one of the opposite
side is caught mapping, to accept Mr..
Lynch's resignation and elect a sue
cessor, which would give him a clear
majority of one and insure the election
of Mr.. Lynch as Street Commissioner
but if this cannot be done the pro.
gramme will no doubt be for Mr.. l.. to
remain in Council, vote for himself and
afterwards resign. The election by
Col. Lynch voting for himself would be
in direct violation of the City ordinan-
ces, and would afford sufficient grounds
for an injunction, which, it is said,
would be served on Mr.. l.. prohibiting
him FROM exercising the duties Of Street
Commissioner. As the election j., to
come off on Monday evening next and
there being no other time set for the
election, there is OF course great ankle
ty upon the subject. In case of the
failure to elect Street Commissioner
on Monday night next, it is said the
present officer, Mr.. Hoagland, who is a
Repu blican, would hold for the whole
three year term.

by suffocatioa. The men had been at work
on the second floor of the building, shovelling
corn for the past two or three days, and at
the time of the accident had transferred
about 5000 bushels frem the elevator to the
floor where it lay in bulk. Suddenly, with
out warning, the timbers and flooring gave
way and the men were precipitated about 20
feet into the cellar and buried in 5000 bushels
cf corn which fell with them. The news
spread like wild fire over the town, and in
four minutes after the building was sur
rounded by hundreds of people. Men were
Immediately set to work to extricate the men.
At $50 o'clock they found the body Of
Nourse, the bodies of Lynch and Rcardon
being dse---ees-a few minutes later. At
this time the excitement Of the crowd was in
tense, and the grief Of the widow of Lynch
who was present, was heartrending. The
bodies we're taken IN charge by the medical
examiner. The cause of the disaster is diff
cult to ascertain. Probably the timbers be-
came somewhat rotton and weakened. Mr.
Packard states he has before had a much lar

aged 32, leaves wife and child. Reardon,

SOME old folks are thought excentric
because they have lived long enough to
believe that One-half of the world live
and thrive on the tomfooleries and fol-
lies of the other half.


II any sane man will be at the trouble
of estimating the judges and attorneys
salaries, the various officers, witnesses
and attorneys fees, and the loss of time
and money by litigants he will be as
tOnished at the vast cost of our temple
of law, and when it is admitted that
three fourths of the worshipers in that
temple leave it, weary, worn, and
worsted, he might readily conclude that
our jewel of justice is not worth thecost
of its temple. =


THE truth is, that our whole judicial
system is so full of rats and rat holes
that a weasel can scarce get through
with whole skin-and the quibbles,
quicks, lodges, delays and
of the law are so patent that Judge
Lynch's court is beginning to be looked
upon as the only tribunal where justice
can be administered without sale, denial
or delay.


THE leaders of all parties signed All
armistice upon the new convention ques-
ton, and the consequence wasthat cam
didates were as still as mice on that
question and many of the people left
entirely ignorant on the subject and
failed to vote, and the convention fails
for the present. Well, it is to be hoped
that Kentucky will some day set her
sister States the example of building up
a plain, common sense, judicial system,
without red tape, i'm which the wheels
of justice will not he clogged or stopped
by every technical shaving, or mustard
seed of doubt; and refuse ali motion fol-
reason of poor mans want of oil to
grease the machinery.


THEsun diffluses light and warmth and
vigor on the temperate and cleanly
regions of the earth, but generates disease
and death i'm the heated and stagnant
marshes; so wealth like the sun, to the
pure and gentle hearted, expands and
purifies all the nObler virtues of the
soul, and imparts life and warmth and
pleasure to all around; but to the viciou.
and vile it but generates the deadly
miasm of selfish avaritious, and tyran.
ical passions, that degrade human
nature, and fill the calender of crime"

 ments on the bill proposing to amend

 the navigation laws so as to authorize the issuance of American registers to foreign-built ships purchased by Amer ican citizens, being addressed by ex- Representative John Lynch, of Maine, and Representative Ward, of Pennsyl- vania. The latter, in the course of his remarks, said that it was understood that Glasgow was, perhaps, the greatest rival of the United States in iron ship building, and he desired to call the at tention of the Committee to the relative rates of wages paid by Glasgow ship builders and those paid by shipbuilders in the United States, so that it might be seen with whom we have to compete in the matter of wages. According to a table prepared in 1872, in Wilmington, Del, and other shipyards, and in Massa- chusetts, the wages to ship carpenters ran from $16 to $21 week, and the rel ative proportions were still kept up. In Glasgow the wages of that class of work men were from $9 Fl to BIO 16 week. In Delaware and Massachusetts black smiths from SIS to $14 67 week, while in Glasgow the wages are from $8 Fl to $9 43 week. Boiler makers in Dela- ware and Massachusetts from SIP to SIS 50 8 week; in Glasgow from $7 26 to $8 Fl a week. Laborers in Wilmington and Massachusetts from S7 50 to BIO 67; in Glasgow from $4 30 to $5 57. The average pay of the classes of workmen mentioned is in Glasgow 25s., or $6 5 in gold in our currency. MT. Ward also read from the document to show that home, as known to American mechanics, was unknown to mechanics in Glasgow, twenty or thirty families there, in some instances, living in one tenement house. Certainly, he said, this committee would do nothing that would tend to reduce our mechanics to similar condition, and he expressed the hope that the commit tee would see that it was best for the interests of the country that the bill should be laid aside and not be held up as disturbing element."

 WASHINGTON NOTES.

 MT. Hewitt has reported the Army bill in the House. That part of 1t which it was intended should take the place of the Burnside bill for the reorganization of the Army has been pruned down until there is very little left of 1t. The parts of. the bill which remain are those which relate to the Engineer Corps and to promotions above the rank of captain, and to the retirement of officers and graduates of West Point who prefer to take $75O and stay at home two years subject to recall if their services are re- auired. The restriction upon promo tions is the feature of the new bill which will provoke the most criticism from officers of the Army, as promotion is what every military man looks forward to as the one end to be attained. The appropriation bill is about the same as that of last year. It provides for an army of 2s,000 men, and recognizes the existing condition of the army.

 The terms of twenty-five Senators expire with the present Congress. Elec- tlons to supply their places for the next SIX years have occurred in every case but two.

The seven reelected are Morrill,, of Vermont; Conkling, of New York Cameron, of Pennsylvania; Ali son, of Iowa, and Jones. of Nevada. all Republicans and Gordon, of Georgia. and Voorhees,, of Indiana, Democrats. Logan, of Illinois, and Carpenter, of Wisconsin, both Republicans, now re- turn to the Senate after an absence re- spectlvely of two and four years.

 -A Washington dispatch says:- Senator Windom proposed that com m1ttee of Senators shall devise means for the removal of the negroes from such parts of the South where they are refused fnelr rights to other parts of the country or to reservation.

~ 2jRJUpICE AGAINST THE WHITEs.--
4Alnw arc very apt to 90 to extremes.
&I3 kepssbliean seems actually to desire
- hanging Of white men, whether prov
tfguilty Of murder or not. It says:


ss,HHanRing white men for murder In the
0uluGh 4 psetty much played out but II q
-uexro happens to burn barn or commit
-suine outrage he Il lynched Immediately
aud hung to the nearest tree. There Is
""a excellent opportunity now offered to
Approve to . certain extent this acc,lsa-
tion by handing the two white murderers
now ON trial--Buford for the murder of
Judge Elliot II Frankfort, Kentucky,
sudl Cox, the murderer of Alston,
ct Atlanta, Georgia. There never
,were two more heartless and cold blood
ed murders pefpetrated, and yet there
nsver was = stronger array Of legal talent
employed in the defence of any murderer
Ahsnj for Buford and Cox. Hung! no
they won't be hung. No danger Of it
Their skins happen to be white. Had
they hut been black, there would have
been no occasion for Court trial.""


= Now, we have looked upon both the
,cases mentioned above as murders, and II
they prove to be murders we expect
lBoford and Cox will be hanged. The law:
should be carried out. But the fact that
the negroes are frequently hung when they
commit q rape upon q white woman
or foul, brutal assassination of whit.
man, or, from malice, burn a barn O.
other property, is no reason why whit
men should be hung who are not guilt,
OF murder, or rape, or arson. Suppos
~ were even true that negroes are hum
uunjustly, this does not furnish sufficien
reason, for hanging white men unjustly
The Republican suffers its sympathy 70
the negro to run away with its justice
We can't understand why this is. TIL
editor Is white and yet seems to have in
,bibed such love for black skin that b


would give his own race no show at al


We don't believe there is a lawyer i


Delaware, that in trying a white ma
i,for' his life, would permit either Of I'll
aRepubatcan people to sit on a jury. VIII


We should certainly be afraid to tru
eurself to such prejudice; we would n
sfeel certain at all that they would n


vote to hang white man, especially if


were an American, Irishman, Frenchm'
ror German, just to crafty this desire


avenge the death of some wretched 4


gro. All we ask is justice for the whl


man Is well as forthe negro. Nor do
think that the Republican has any rig


TO interfere with the decisions of Cou
=. of other States."

ishing up the Legislative Biiis-The


Board of Education Bill as amended


Adopted-1he Water Loan Bill De.


Jedted-An Important resolution.


City Council met last evening persuant
to adjournment on Monday night.


In the absence Of PresidenL Lichten-
stein, MIR. Taylor was, on motion of Mr..
Moron, called to the chair.


Mr.. McGlinchey, chairman of the
committee on legislation, presented the
Board OF Education bill, as amended by
the joint committees on Tuesday Gan ac-
count of which was published in the
GAZETTE OF yesterday and moved the
endorsement of the bill by Council as
endorsed by the joint committees.
MIR. Norton said that he would like TO
know what object the Board of Educa-
ton had in view, in asking that their ap-
preparation be paid in installments. 1t
is very kind in them to give way to
Council, but what was their object
Mr.. McGlinchcy, explained the object
of the Board, and the bill was endorsed
without dissenting vote.


Mr.. McGlinchev, on behalf Of the
committee, reported on the resolution of
DIR. Walton, in regard to funding the
floating and funded debt of the city at 4
O'Clock, made an adverse report on that
port lon of the resolution in regard to the
funded debt, as the city has no authority
to fund it,


In moving the adoption of the report
Mr.. MEG linchey, said that it was a mat
ter of impossnility for the City Council
to interfere with the bonded debt of the
city, as it is already provided for. In re-
gard to the floating debt, the committee
makes no report as 1t expects a report
from the Finance Committee.
The report was thereupon adopted.


MIR. McGlincliey, presented the follow
ing act, which created considerable dis
cusson, and was finally indefinitely
postponed:


an act 10 further amend Chapter 73,
Of the Rerised Statutes, Of the State of
DetdUdre, entitled, ""of the city Of VII
minOtOn.""


Be 1t enacted by the Senate and House
of Representatives, of the State of Della
ware, in General Assembly met, (two
thirds of each branch thereof, concur
ring.)


Section /. That section 52, of chapter
70 of the Revised Statutes of the State
of Delaware, entitled ""of the city of Will
mington"" be, and the same is hereby
amended, by adding to said section, the
following, to wit The City Council of
Wilmington shall annually set apart
from the net earnings of the Water De-
partment of said city sum not exceed
ing twelve thousand dollars, which sum
or sums so set apart shall constitute a
fund which shall be used for keeping In
proper condition and repair the water
works OF said city, and in improving and
extending the same, and for no other
purpose whatever. All sums of money
so set apart for the purpose aforesaid may
in the discretion OF the City Council be
invested in such manner as it shall deem
most expedent for carrying into effect
the purposes contemplated by this act.


On the question Of adopting the report
or act, Mr.. Chandler, said he desired to
zens' Committee reported that the wheels
at the city mills ought to- be replaced.
The act, if passed directs City Council to
set apart $4,000 every year for the I'M
provement of the water works. That is
all well enough but where is the money
TO come from now to replace the water
wheels In conformity with the report Of
the Citizens Committee?


Mr.. McGlincbey, stated that Council
was aware that the committee in offer
ing the bill were acting under instruc-
tions. At the meeting last Monday
night the committee were instructed to
prepare such bill.


Mr.. Norton, said he did not think il
worth while to make the repairs suggest
ed by the Citizens Committee immedi-
| ately ; the committee only recommended
that they should be repaired. There is
no immediate danger.


Mr.. Chandler, thought that out of re-
spect TO the Citizens Committee, the re-
pairs suggested by them should be made.
The Water Committee state that it takes
! from $50 to $50 per month to keep the
pumps repaired; why not put in ""a new
one for the sake OF economy and save
several hundred dollars per yea? He
moved that the bill be amended as fol-
lows after the word to wit:
| That bonds be issued and sold to the
amount OF S50,0OO or so much of that
amount as may be needed from time to
| eiiiN, III siiN Po""oi no
city mill.


In supporting this amendment, Mr..
Chandler, said that it was not his idea to
have all the bonds sold at once, but if
the Water Committee should need S10,-
900 to make repairs, why then issue
bonds to that amount until the $4,000
| was exhausted.


Mr.. Norton, said he could not agree
with the gentleman from the Seventh


Ward. He recommends adding $4,000
to the city; the Citizens Committee re-
commended that no additional debt be
added 10 the city. He was satisfied that
the Water Committee did not want the
money, and he was satisfied that the clti-


zens would have 10 more debt added to
the already large one of the city they


were opposed to it to man.
| Mr.. Guthrie moved that the amend
ment be referred to the legislative com
mittee.


| Mr.. Jones was of the opinion that the


word ""bond,"" in the amendment, would
defeat the whole thing.


Mr.. Lynch said he could not see why
the gentleman from the Seventh Ward
desired to press the amendment; he had
full confidence in the Water Committee

EVENTS BALLA.


Here. in Dublin. the chief topic Of conversation
was the demonstration to be held at Balla, small
town in the heart of Mayo county. You have been
already informed by cable of the origin Of this
two holdings under Sir Robert Blosse Lynch. 1t may
be said in passing, that the Blosse Lynches
ranged themselves the unpopular side, the ladies
OF the family like female fanatics in Ireland generally
seeking to wean the wretched Papists on their
by small doles of clothes and meat on Fridays. The
men were hard driving the tenants at elections al

Aboutten days ago the Dempseys forced to
surrender grazing farm to the agent Of the land
lord. The accumulation of bad times had been
quite too much for them, and they utterly
able to pay the rent. They to be evicted
out of the other farm. The amount Of rent owing
$3.50; but the law costs amounted 10 $685. and the
poor wretches could not make up the sum, which must
be paid. they would keep the shelter OF roof over
their heads. The Dublin Eueriaq Mail, journal

POVERTY AND DISTRESS.


The misfortunes OF the Dempseys aroused a uni
versal feeling OF sympathy throughout Mayo and all
the neighboring counties 1t was crucial illustra-
tion of the mseries incidental to the irish land
question. 1t was resolved to hold great indigna-
ton meeting on the spot to protest against the
ton OF this helpless family and to declare that sys.
tenn OF land tenure, under which such calamities
might be inflicted all the tiers of the soil of the
country must be radically wrong and should be re-
formed. The eviction was to take place to-day and
the meeting was fixed to be held at the whom
take forcb The fespa OF hs 70
has made great stride within the three weeks
upon this point of fixing the people on the SOIL But
the government also have been working themselves
up to the conviction that they must check the
agitation or it may be too strong for thcm.
So orders sent down for large force of police
TO be the ground to assist the Sheriff in enforcing
the law. and to overawe resistance should any be
attempted The people became alarmed and 1t is
reported desperate counsels obtained the upper
hand Dempsey and his friends got together some
firearms. and it said they had resolved to defend
the house to the last Perhaps they had heard the
Ballyesey adventure in Tipperary county years
back. where band of tenants held a farm house for
weeks against the Sheriff and tho constabulary and
hnally beat on the landlord. But the time and tho
scene and the circumstances are not the same When
the government learned the of feeling at
Loonanore Uhs is the naino of the Dempseys place,
they teegraphed for large force OF military to be
concentratedquite sufficient to deal with any crowd
likely to be got together at Balla Orders were
given that no resistance should be tolerated Unless
the sheriff was permitted to execute the law peace
ABLY, the disurbers should be fired upon and forcby
dispersed.

A Chilllcothe special of July l1th to the
Cincinnati Enquirer gives he following de-
tails of the sudden death of Hon. William
Allen:


The death occurred at half-past O'Clock
this morning. without any apparent pre-
Previous illness of any consequence. He
was down to the city on Monday, and
talk,d to his friends as usual, evincing q
hvely interest in what was going on in the
ousy world, socially, commercially and po
litically. There had been nothing to indi,
cate serious failure of health or vigor. His
physical condition during tho past winter
was not, perhaps, so good as it had been
during the fall and summer, but there was
nothing of character to excite apprehen,
sion. The first approach to his final illness
was, perhaps, between 8 and 10 O'Clock yes.
terday morning, when he complained OF
feeling slight faintness. But this passed
OF and was only momentary.


HE ATE HEARTY DINNER AT NOON.


after which he went upstairs and retired for
his usual afternoon nap. About four O. o'clock
he came down, complained of not feeling
WELL and he said he had not slept any, while
IN his room. Going out upon the porch he
soon became sick at the stomach, and Mrs.
Scott, (his daughter) prevailed upon him to
60 IN the house and lie down. He had laid
down but few minutes, when he said he
thought he would feel better sitting up, and
ne accordingly got up and remained sitting
until O'Clock, eating no supper. He had
taken dose of laudanum in the mean time.
and 1t refused to remain upon his stomach,
little before this time DR.. Scott returned
from his professional duties and made an
examination of the governor, and thought
the symptoms indicated


CHILL OR INTERMITTENT FEVER.


The extremities were cold, pulse slow, with
pains in the arm. Under treatment-chlo
form, laudnum and warm drinks being ad-
mlnlstered-the cold stage gradually gave
place to the febrile stage; the extremities
became warm, skin more natural, breathing
better and pains relieved. By midnight the
fever seemed to subside and he rested we'll
his condition remained favorable until 1
O'Clock. when quinine was administered.
ihere had been nothing to indicate that


THERE WAS CRISIS PENDING.


The mind was clear, and bat once, if at
all, did 1t transpire that any of the house
hold was apprehensive of the result. DIR.
Scott had told them few days before of q
patient he had been treating for congestive
chllls. The governor referred to this, and
asked If there was danger of his sickness
taking that course. He was assured there
was not; that the cold stage of the attack
had already passed, and the matter was not
again referred to. In this apparent state OF
affairs, at half-past 1 o'clock, the governor
got out of bed and walked 10 his chair. In
the act of sitting down, instantly, and with
out a struggle or a moan,


he SANK INTO HIS CHAIR-DEAD!


The declaration that there were no pre-.
vious apprehensive symptoms is entitled to
some qualification. The governor was
greatly exhausted by his severe work in the
| campaign of 1875. He came home sick
| from overwork, and showed considerable ex-
haustion and an irritable condition of the
heart 1t was long and arduous campaign
from the effects of which he never fully re-
cvered. The seeds of the disease of which
! he died were then sown, it is believed by
those who have known and watched hin
closest.

| Biographical.


The inquirer gives an elaborate biograph
ical sketch, from which we make the follow
ing extracts
William Allen was born at Edenton, Cow
han county, N. G., in 1907, near the south
ern boundary of Virginia. When mere
boy he went to Lynchburg, Va, and begar
his apprenticeship as a saddler, having &C
quired, previously, some rudimentary knowl
edge at a primary school. When 16 years
OF age he determined to go to Chillicothe
Ohio, where he had half sister and 6
brother-in- law, named Pleasant Thurman
who kept store. Young Allen started OF
bis trip across the mountains in mid winter
with drover who had befriended him, and
when near Gallipolis, he parted with hi
friend and began his lonely walk across thu
country to Chillico+he. At that time Ohio
contained but few settlements, and tn
journey was lonely one; but the boy hat
a purpose in life, and notwithstanding man,
mishaps he reached his destination, and wa
welcomed at the home of his sister and b,
her son, Allen G. Thurman, who has sin g,
risen to be one of Ohio's statesmen.


In the year 1882 William Allen, the youns
lawyer, who had come to Chillicothe te,
years before with his bundle on his back
was nominated for Congress by the Demo
Gratis and elected over General Duncan Nc
Arthur, then the governor of Ohio. Th,
district was Whig by 1000 majority, anc
Macarthur was undoubtedly the most popular
man that could have been chosen by the the,
dominant party in it.


His record in the House of Representa-
| tives was an honorable one. Thomas Ewing
and Thomas Corwin were there from Ohio
Fernando Wood and Silas Wright of New
York; John Quincy Adams of Massachu
setts; and Polk, of Tennessee, and score
OF others whose names are written in the
history of the country. jackson was ther
President, and was in the midst of his con.
tiict with the money power. He had vetoed
the bill to recharter the United States bank
and had removed the deposits from the
vaults. 1t was war of the giants in the
political arena, and a beardless youth, az
they called him who represented the Sciotc
dlscrict, was among the foremost in the bat
tie. He took the side of jackson, on whose
knee he had sat eighteen years before
and had The satisfaction of seeing and
helping that man to vict Dry. It was then
the contest of the people yainst monono.
ly, OF the taxpayers against the tax eaters
and he was with the people and triumphe5
| At the expiration of his term he came home
and declined reelection.


NEXT SENATOR ALLEN.


In the winter of 1836-37 he was elected
to the United States Senate, as has already
been stated. The Legislature was Demo.
cratic by one majority on joint ballot, and
this majority of one again came to be his
""avior from defeat When the Legislature
met, in December, he had not expected to be
candidate for senatorial honors. Still. he
was in Columbus. and invited to the dinner
which the Democratic members gave to the
candidates, and upon their invitation made

Mr.. Paynter, Chairman of the Water
Committee, stated that the Water De-
partment's safe was very insecure, and
that cn the books it contains about
$50, 200 due the city. The money when
collected will 60 into the general fund
and not into the Water Department,

badly needed, he thought one should
be purchased and the amount charged
to the appropriation tor incidentals. II
this could n0t be done, the ri TX of los.
ing the books would have to be in.
Cured. The new safe would cost from
$3.50 to $500.


Mr.. Guthrie hoped council would
not be extravagant, as the tax collector Z
Office needed new safe, and also the
Auditors office, and the city had not
the money at present to buy three safes.
On motion of Mr.. Guthrie the proper
officers were authorized to make notes
for 60 days, one for $4,000 in favor OF
Philip Quigley and the other for $2O,-
600 in favor of John Peoples, Cashier of

coming due.


Mr.. Norton offered resolution in

ing Ter free market. The resolution
was adopted.


Mr.. Lynch, returning to the safe
question said that Council could not
risk the loss of books worth $50, 900 for
want Of a safe to keep them in, and he
moved that the Water Committee be
in Instructed TO purchase a new safe not
to exceed $3.50, and to be paid for out
of the appropriation for miscellaneous
and incidental expenses.


Mr.. McCilinChey said two thirds OF
that appropriation had already been
expended, and he d,d not sea how it
could be paid out of that appropria-
ton.


Mr.. Chandler wanted to know if the
Did safe was not good one. 1t was
bad time he thought now to increase



Nj. Norton concurred with Mr.. Lynch,
nut thought that better safe should

Mr.. Guthrie reminded Council that
here We're only $525 in the sppropri-

Mr.. Paynter said the committee vas
,tf-red $50 for the old safe in exchange
or a new one.


Mr.. Guthrie said that the old safe
would do for the tax collectors office.


Mr.. Adams wanted to know if i'll
would keep books any more secure in

ing toward Mrs. Cobb calls attention to
human quality which is extremely uh-
pleasant to contemplate. and the existence
of which no man can admit without sense
almost of disgust for humanity, but which,
nevertheless, must be admitted and con-
sidered in order that the sentiment Of COM
munities may always be rightly estimated.
The quality-or, rather, the vice-alluded
to is that of suspicion, which undoubtedly
has prevailed so generally in Norwich dur
ing the Cobb-Bishop excitement as to have
disgraced q great many good people who
have regarded tho supposed criminals
with virtuous horror. The saddening fact
about the exhibition Of this feeling is that
many of those who have manifested it are
themselves persons of honorable instincts
and pure lives. Their sin is that Of the
higher nature, instead of the lower, but
it is noue the less blameworthy for that
reason-rather more SO. The fault is not q
new one in the history of criminal pro-
cedure. Two centuries ago the suspicious
of the best people of New England forced
people equally good to the block, the
scaffold and the stake for witchcraft, while
in our own day the suspicious of some of
the most honorable citizens of our mower
States have handed many an innocent vic
tim over 10 that unreasoning brute, Judge
Lynch. The innocence or guilt of Mrs.
Cobb or any other suspected person has
nothing to do with this subject. If the ac-
cused poisoner of her husband were ten
times as guilty as jury has pronounced
her to be, the local prejudging of the case,
as outlined in our letter, would have been
none the less unreasonable, disgraceful,
cowardly and inhuman. The vicious spirit
alluded to is at the bottom of more harm to
humanity than almost any other that has
cursed the world, yet so successfully does
it escape the cognizance of moral teachers
that we venture to predict thst not single
preacher in Norwich or New York will have
word to say about it from the pulpit to-
day."

| CHARLOTTESVILLE, March Is. 1879.
| Nothing that has occurred in Virginia since tho re-
construction OF the Southern States has excited the
public mind more profoundly than the recent action
of Judge Alexander Rives of the United States Court

negroes from juries in violation. alleged. OF the
fourteenth amendment of the constitution and

national protection of the nations wards""
The acts OF Judge Rves taking from the custody of
the State courts two negroes convicted of murder

which convicted them composed entirely Of
whites and the subsequent indictment by his direc
ton. while holding court at Danville of five State
judges OF surrounding counties for alleged violation
OF the statute which forbds any officer of State
court excluding any citizen from the jury box

vice, familiar to the reading public. That
the Judge is not dismayed by the adverse criticism
his conduct not only in the State but throughout
the country is certain. lie has determined to carry
on the war against the offending State courts every
where, and will demand the Indictment OF other
judges who, as he claims. have violated the law.
THE JUDGES COMING CHARGE.


| The next term of Judge Rives' court will be held
| in Lynchburg. beginning Monday next. and
similar charge that which to the indictment Of
the five judges already involved will be given the
Grand Jury there to be convened. The charge will
be delivered on Tuesday. and, by courtesy of Judge
Rves the representative of the HERALD enabled

fully and accurately his construction of the law. 1t

| As to the scope Of your inquiries, they are CO.
extensive with the jurisdiction of this Court
| They cannot go beyond You are restricted to the
statutes of tho United States The warrant for your
findings must be found in them. This results from
the nature OF our governments, State and federal

operations OF the government of the United States
within the States. To this end it establishes
of its own and intrusts to them the due assertion
and enforcement OF it's laws Every question arising
under the constitution. the laws aud the treaties

these respective tribunals, State and federal, keep
within their prescribed orbits and discharge their
whole duty to the laws OF both. there will scarcely be
room or occasion for conflict OF jurisdiction. But
the moment law of Congress is disobeyed in any
judicial quarter the danger OF this collision becomes
| imminent, and it becomes the duty OF all having
power to guard against it to take every possible
precaution to prevent it.


| THE JURY QUESTION.


Under this persuasion and with this view deem
it my duty to call your attention to law of Congress

those charged with the duty Of returning
jury lists. Before doing SO, however would beg
leave to recall to TIN requirements OF your State
laws and consttution-not that you have to deal
with them this occasion but to show you that in
the execution of the act of Congress you not
asked to do anything contrary to them. but only
what Is strictly conformaole to them BY the law Of

TON"" Buford. although scarcely past middle life
and reared in one Of the most civil and peace loving
sections Of the State OF kentucky. has had
occasions to invoke family influence to shield him
from the consequences of his desperate acts. The
HERALD has been able to obtain from former resi-
dents of tho ""Blue Grass country now in this
city the following particulars Of his eventful
career His family for generations had been noted
for their susceptible honor ana fiery temper, and
these qualities copspicuous almost to exaggera-
ton in Tom Buford. Horse racing and such sports
were the recognized pastimes Of the community in
which they lived and the Bufords participated in
them with zeal. Bowie knives and revolvers were
tho constant companions of the young bloods, but
sort of local tradition had authorized the use OF
weapons to heal wounded honor. and offences
against that delicate sensbilty much rarer in
consequence than might be supposed.


A FAMILY QUARREL.


Tom Buford wild. reckless and daring as
any. but he also distinguished by proud
servo toward acquantances that threw him almost
| entirely upon his own resources for amusement.
The frst.dculty that brought out his recklessness
grew Of tho division Of his fathers estate That
consisted chiefly Of about six hundred of land
lying sixteen miles out OF Lexington. toward
Versailles The dying directions of his father had
beon that the estate should be equally divided
| among the three brothers and the sister
Mary Buford. The expense of the dover
right of tho mother was to be shared
by tho children. General Abe Buford's share was
duly set apart and he entered into possession Of it,
When it came to the division among the others Tom

buckshot along with it, Mr. Alexander declined the
bargain Tho brothers quarrel about the partition
grew in ranoor, until one day in May, 1851 Tom and
Henry met in the streets of Versailles. Hot words

FICE BY HUBERT o. THOMPsON-wHAT Mr..


GUMBLErON AND HIS COUNSEL SAY.


Governor RObinson's decision in the cases or
County Clerk Gumbleton aud Register Loew
awakened great excitement In political circles
when announced yesterday. The removal OF
both officials had been expected but when
It became known that the Governor had
decided to remove the County Clerk and to allow
the Register 10 remain in Office, considerable sur
prise was manifested. Those who claim To know
openly asserted that this was the result
of an arrangement by which Register LOew is to
give his support to the Tilden-Cooper wing Of the
Democratic party and also to use bis influence and
office IN obtaining votes for the party in tho
Apri election of the TammaBy Society.
There are few members of the Tammany Society III
the Registers office, but Mr.. Loew influences
number of brothers and personal followers who arc
in the society. Incuded among these are his four
| brothers. Charles Il. LOew, Edward v LOew, Louis
| A. Loew, and William l.. LOew. Mr.. Kelly has
only one follower in the Registers office who can bd
depended upon to support him-Augustus I. DOch-
arty-and he will probably have to retire at an
early date.


The fact that both the Register and County Clerk





case against Register LOew was thought to be tho
stronger because he was regarded fairly ads
mtting his derellctiOn of duty by adopting
new schedule of prices after the Bar As
sociation had begun proceedings to have him
removed. spoken of by many yesterday
as confirmation Of the rumOrs that he had made his
peace with Mr. Tilden. 1t is said similar PROPOSE
tion was made to County Clerk Gumbleton before
his removal, but he declined yesterday to mako
any disclosures at present""


The committee appointed by the Bar Association
was instructed to proceed against Sheriff Reilly at
the same time and in the same manner against
County Clerk Gumbleton and Register Loew. They
examined the Sherifi's books thoroughly, Mr..
Charles Mclean, of Mr. Tden's office, occu-
pying several days in that investigation.
and the committee collected great deal of other
evidence to be used before the Governor for the
Sheriif7s removal A member OF the committee
stated over six weeks ago that the charges against
the Sheriff were ready to be presented to the Gov
erlOr, adding at the same time that such course
would probably BE- taken within few days. Since
that time no further action has been taken in the
sheriff case, and great deal OF surprise has been
expressed at this delay In the meantime, two OF
the committee have been heard 10 express admir-
alton al the noble and candid manner IN which
the Sheriff had acted when accused As an ex-





Yesterday that an Arrangement had been mado
with sheriff Reilly similar to that effected with
Register I.oew, whereby he would give his support
To the Tilden faction, and especially control
the votes Of the Tammany Society IN his Offco
in favor of the Tilden wing i'll the coming
April election. The person who first gave this nios
nation stated that charges might yet be made against
the Sheriff in order satisfy public opinion, but that
they would probably be 50 light a. TO afford tho
Governor good excuse for not removing the sheriff.

Thsa the Roy Hsd Help.


CINCINNATI, Ohio, Sept. 4-No salts.
factory solution Of the Waynesvills
tragedy has yet been reached. The
four members Of the family are in their
cofaus and can tell no tales. That the
boy Willie was implicated in the mur-
dsrs there can BE- no doubt. There 10
abundant evidence to prove this, be-
sides his suicide. A further sxamina.
tion Of the room and bodies, however.
makes It certain that he did not kill
the two women and the girl alone.


Daniel R. Anderson, the divorced
husband Of the woman, Mrs. Hattie, %
known to be jealous Of his former wife,
and about the time the murders were
committed be was absent from his work
in Cincinnati. On this and other less
important circumstances is based the
theory that he either helped his son To
do the terrible deed or employed another
person. He has been arrested, and to.
night was taken TO the scene Of the
tragedy. A strong underourrent NJ
feeling prevails against him in the
community, and few threats Of lynch
ing we're heard among the crowd that
met him at the train, but as . large
proportion Of the population Of the town
and its vicinity are Qnakers, no demon
stration Of that kind is probable.


Anderson believes his son was guilty.
The boy, hs says, was an invsterste
reader Of cheap yellow back novels.
Anderson claims to know Of no trouble
that might have led to the tragedy, and
says he cannot understand 1t. When
he was up there short time ago they
were all getting along nicely. Why he
should be arrested he has no idea. He
could have no knowledge Of the matter,
and can prove II very easily. The in
quest will bs resumed tomorrow, when
it Is expected that further facts will be
developed.


Mrs. Baltimore, who lives near the
Anderson house, says that on the night
Of the murder she heard screams issu.
ing from the cottage; and went TO her
window to see what was the trouble.
In the back yard we're two men, whom
she distinctly saw, carrying something
which looked like sheet or bed. That
tie lad had help in chopping open the
heads Of his mother and aunt and the
girl is demonstrated. Who render.
o., that help and what the motives
were for butchery are the elements Of
mystery that surround the case."

Henry Hayden, of Wood county court,
a politician well known throughout the
State, and candidate for Attorney-i Gen
eral on the Greenback ticket two years
ago, was shot and killed at Gem ALA
Wis, last Thursday, by w. ii. Coch' an,
cashier Of the First National Bank, The
affair grew out of tie alleged intimacy
on the part of Ha, den with Cochran's
wife,t scandal beng one of long stand
ing. Cochran had separated from his
wife some time ago, although no divorce
had been obtaired. The weapon u'ed
was a shotgun, loaded with five buck
shots. Lf.-. 1882


The entire charge entered IIayden's
right side, killing hm instantly. AS no
word, passed between the men, it is
thought the killing was premeditated.
Excitement at the time ran high, and
threats OF lynching were freely indulged
in, hut finally better counsel prevailed
Cochran delivered himself up, and wa
mn tied to Jail, but on the following
day was attending to business as usual
Judge Hayden will be buried on Sun
day, and Cochran will have his examin
alton on Tuesday. Although the mur
der occurred on Thursday nothing wa

but Mr.. Norton again raised the
previous question OH Mr.. Paynter's
original resolution.


Msssrs. Paynter and Moore grew con-
siderably excited under the call Of the
previous question, the first ntimatinE
that there was disposition to choke
of the debate.


The President said that Council
should study its own rules, he had on
ly to enforce the rules they made for
their own government.


Mr.. Moore expressed himself entire
ly at sea and did not know what he
was voting for.


Mr.. Paynter too said it was ""ter-
rible mix.up,"" and wanted to know il
the Street Commissioner would not bo
allowed to explain.


The chair said that motion for the
Street Commissioner to explain would
be IN order If the previous question
was voted down.


The vote being taken on the previous
question, it was adopted, when Mr..
paynter's resolution was passed by the
following vote:

After the adoption of the resolution,
the Street Commissioner, on motion OF
Mr. Paynter, was heard in explanation
OF his connection with the affair. He
said that if anything was wrong, it
must be with the Street Committee or
with Council. He got his instruction
as to where the dirt was to be placed
from the chairman Of the Street Com
mittee, whom he considered, represent.
ed the COMMITTEES, they having refused
to instruct him, he Instructed the
bidders tina: the dirt should bs put on
Chrlstiana avenue, between Head
street and the rolling mill.


Mr.. Taylor and Tow nsend both made
personal explanations, the former stat
ing that hs never had any intention Of
casting any reflections on the Street
Commissioner.


Mr.. Guthrie offered an ordinance au-
.horizng the issue of City bonds to pay
the floating and unfund.d deb. Of tho
city amounting $l45, 900 according to
the act recently passed by the Legisla-

Q duels, 6 of which were followed by the
death of one of the contestants, and 800
suicides. Ofthe latter % occurred IN April,

month, in August. The least number (43)
occurred in January, and the next, (49) in

provocative of dependency and suicide
as the number of suicides occurring in
April, an unusually warm month last year.
June, Jnly, August and September, alec
unsoasnnably warm, was considerably
more than the average of the whole year.
Inc iOut prominent causes OF suicide were
disappointed love, domestic infelicity,
business troubles and whiskey. Anon <
the peculiar causes were the following !:
Oae man hung himself because somebody
was going to start IN opposition livery
stable; another because sOmo one cut hls
horses bride at q party ; another because
his pocketbook had been stolen; another
because he was defeated in running for
Congress-. One man shot himself because
1t was too hot to live another because it
was too cold, aud third because it wasn't
worth while to live, no matter what the
weather was. A woman shot herself be-
cause her husband did not como home
when she expected him, another because
her husband was lsnched, third because
her parents would not let her marry the
man she loved. The means of suicide
were as varied as the causes. All the gen
orally kno Tn poisons, the usual number of
bed cords and pistols were brought into
reqnisition, and water waited many to the
world beyond. Scissors were used in one
csee, penknives in several, and the raz or

The number of murderers who committed
suicide was proportioually very large. Ill
health was also q frequent cause with
membe of both sexes."

She nursed my moth- CT and her sisters when they were babies, and brought up all my mothers children. l be- lieve I am her favorite out of the batch, prob ably because l am the youngest, and she has brought up all my children until the fact of it is she's too old for service She is getting SC blind that she can't fairly see, and 50 doubled up with the rheumatism that she can't walk as fast as Tot can creep, and Mrs. Gourdin is | afraid to trust the baby with her. I knew there would be row if spoke. to her about | it but did it as kindly as could. l only said that we wefe afraid Tot was giving her | too much trouble, and wanted to get little darky girl to run around after her, so that | Mauma could still sit on the veranda and boss | the job But she smelled powder at once. See here, Massa Joe, she said, you isn't going | back on ole Mauma, IS you? and now there's no telling when she'll come out of her sulks :"" '.Oh, she won't mind it,"" suggested, re-as- suringly, 'when she sees that she has full au- thority over the little girl she will rather like | to have some one to order about.

 1 ""Indeed she will mind it,"" replied the colo ne 'As things are now, she orders us all | about. We'll, Tot will have to run the risk of broken neck, for we can't displease Mau- l ma.""

 From all that ]. had seen of Mauma during my visit at the colonePs had become deeply interested in her, and l determined now to have little conversation with her. l found her under the Cherokee roses, somewhat more composed. She had just taken small en- broidered pouch from her pocket, Mrs. Gour- din's own handiwork, and was filling a corn cob pipe with some of the colonels best Lone Jack Lynchburg smoking tobacco. a-

 ''How old are you, ?' l asked, for could think of no better way in which to open the conversation. It proved most unlucky question, for Mauma settled her gorgeous Ma dras turban so as to cover more completely the locks which, frosty and silky as laMo g. wool, curled from beneath It, and With sus. aioious sldelong glance from her flmy eyes, mumbled grossly,

HEARINGS LAST EVENING AND THIS


MORNING.",,"HEARINGS LAST EVENING AND THIS


MORNING.


Appearances, before the hearings COM
menced at the City Hall last night. gave
evidence that they would be of nature
more than ordinarily interesting. A
large crowd was In attendance.


The first case was that of Evan
Butcher, COL, for violating city ordi-
nance by sinking q cesspool and walling
1t up without first procuring a permit
from the Street Commissioner. Street
Commissioner Lynch testified that it
had often happened that people did this
and he knew that Butcher led the gang
who dug the well and walled it up. If
he could not produce certificate he had
violated the ordinance. The prisoner
was proved guilty and fined ten dollars
and required to pay costs.


Sallie Cloud, young woman, was
charged by Mary Hessian, an elderly
lady, with saying her son was drunk and
using disrespectful language toward her.
The case was cOunter-suit to one
brought before Magistrate Cole on Sat
urday evening by the defendant against
the plaintiff for similar charge. Han
nah Curry one Of the witnesses for the
defense testified that the language was
not disrespectful. The costs on the case
were imposed.
The next case was that Of John, Will
liam and Eugene Thompson, who were
arraigDed on the charge of violating
city ordinance. 1t appears from the tes
timony that the Clerk of the Market hat
sold space on Fourth street, near King
to person for the purpose Of selliD
peaches, and that the defendants backe
their wagon loaded with peaches int
said space, ard upon being order to va
cate by the Clerk, they refused to do sc
and hence the arrest.


Fl. G. Conrad, ESQ.,, appeared for th
defense, and after hearing number {
witnesses, he argued that the Clerk ha
no right to sell said space, and aske
that the further hearing Of the case
postponed until Friday morning next {
8 o'clock, in order to allow him time
more fully investigate the matter. iii


request was granted.


| The cases this morning consisted {


three ordinary drunks, A penalty of {
cents and costs was imposed in eae


case."

 for his arrest and conviction should he succeed in escaping in his refarious enterprise. The short stretch of road between this city and Maricopa has now an uneRviable reputation in respect to stage robbers This crime having been committed forr times within as many months and singular as it may appear the perpretrator or perpretrators have in each case been successful in eluding all efforts made to their capture. That they are prepared to add murder 10 their other crimes is evidenced by the desperate attack made on messen- ger Blankensliip about month ago This clearly outlines the character of the class we have to deal with an the action of the administration fully proves that they understand the situ- ation and are determined to adopt such measures as will put an end to such enterprise in the future. Ari- zona, although, one of the border con stituencies of the Union has by the ad vent of the Railway lost her isolated position entirely, being now but few days travel from any of the com. mercial marts of the country, and the incoming immigration is crowding border ru1anism into the shade. These facts should be enough to i'm press upon our citizens that if we desire to appear as a civilized con- munity before our sister states and to invite both capital and labor to develop our vast natural resources, stage robberies must be made thing of the past and strangers must be made to feel that they are as secure when travelling in the Territory as when they are at their own homes. Our bullion shipments have now as- sumed such proportions and in fact, even our commercial remit tanses are now of such an important character, that dilly dalIying cannot be tolerated. We are not in favor of any resort to lynch law but we say plainly and distinctly that the time has passed when the stage coaches of Arizona may be robbed with impunity. Of the many good acts done by Acting Governor Gosper during his temporary Administration, this one certainly is the best, and too much credit cannot be given him for the prompt and energetic manner in which he is endeavoriug to rid Arizona of brigandage."

last over and Mr.. Louis P. Lynch is


elected street commissioner. OF this


there was no doubt since the sharp


dodge executed by the Democrats in


filing the Ninth Ward vacancy, if Mr..


Lynch would vote for himself which 1t


was generally conceded he would do If


there was no other plan by which he


could be elected. We are not amongst


those who contend that Col. Lynch had


no right to cast ballot for himself, for


humiliating as it was there could be no


doubt that he was entitled to all the


rights and privileges Of the other Coun-


cilmen, and his action would be sup


ported before auy court of justice. 1t


is true that rule OF Council very spe-


cifcally prohibits any Councilman from


voting upon any question in which he


is personally interested, but mere


rule made only to be rescinded at the
option Of Council stands nowhere when


The law is brought to bear upon it.


There was no person more desirous
of escaping this terrible humiliation


than Colonel Louis P. Lynch, but


be could not let three year Office
worth $500 year slip from between
his fingers when his own vote would
save it to him. This is rather more
than could be expected of any body
placed in the same circumstances. We
have no idea at all that on injunction to
restrain Mr.. Lynch from performing the
duties of the office to which he has been
elected would amount to anything and
The money spent in having one issued
would be- thrown away, as Mr.. Lynch has
in our opinion been legally cleo
ted, and We are persuaded to believe
will make good and competent officer.
Having said this much of his qualif.
cations and his election we would most
condemn the means made
use of to accomplish his election, aud
the Legislature cannot too soon step in
and amend the charter, prohibiting any
Councilman voting for himself for
any office in the gift of the body of
which he is member. We must
commend the stand taken by Messrs.
Hart and Paynter, a stand which but
few Democrats dare to take, in
opposing what they believed to be
RUG in their own party formed TOR the
distribution of patronage to a favored
few. The remarks of Mr.. Hart last
night, though they did not ring around
he City Hall, down the stairway and
,ut into the street, like Mr.. McGlinchey's
mere noise and party seutimentality
they had the ring of the true metal
# which firm Independent men are
made. Mr.. Hart charged it upon his
Democratic colleagues that three months
before the caucus was held it was de- |
ermined to make Mr.. Louis Lynch I
Street Commissioner and Mr.. Cannon
lerk Of the market, and said Mr.. Hart:
i cannot stultity my manhood by CIV
ng my vote to such combination. :
But though Mrssrs. Hart and Paynter
nave been unsuccessful smashing what
s evidently Democratic ring, they i.
lave raised themselves in the estima-
ion of all friends of good municipal 5
'overnment; and though they may not
10 met by the smiles and Establishments :

ave what is much better, the approval

By what authority does the Chair

the owners of property in this city from

curb setter he may select from setting
curb (strictly az required to be done,)

The reason why | should like this
question answered is, because the pre-
sent Chairman has 30 refused. John
Green has erected row Of houses on
Thirteenth street between West and
Washington. Hs wished to secure the
lines and have his curb set. He there
fore called on Mr.. Lynch, Street Com
missioner, to get an order for the

Mr.. Lynch said he could not give the
order, but that he would have to so
and see William McMenamin, Chairman

ouested, and informed McMenamin of
his object. McMeDamin asked who
was going to set the curb. Mr. ureen
stated that be had employed VIM.

surb. Mr.. McMenamin informed Green
that they could not do the job, but
that il must be done by |. J. Davis who

Great Problem,",,"The Grand Jury Still Struggling with the


Great Problem.


The GLOBE is about tired of stating that
the grand Jury is wrestling with the social
evil question. But that's what they were
doing yesterday, and have been doing for
several days as duly recorded in the GLOBE,
together with official documents received by
the grand jury Oh the subject. Yet, some
how, Bill Kings paper never
found it out until yesterday. Then
Dick, or some of his equally sagacious
disciples, revamped what the GLOBE has re-
ported for week, with indecent originality,
giving the names of parties seen about the
court house as social evil witnesses, when in
fact many we're there for other purposes.
The p. p. didn't think it's dirty chickens
would come home to roost SO soon. But

all of the physicians of the city. They are
called in as medical experts. s. B. Wool
worth being in their company and not q
physician must be summoned as social evil
expert. What else?


But to the proceedings Of the grand jury
yesterday. AS stated the day was wholly, or
nearly so, consumed in examining
and investigating the social evil question.
A great number of witnesses were examined,
and an equally large number will be up to-
day to tell what they know and what they
don't know. In view of this fact, the con-
tinued examination of witnesses, tie grand
jury reached no conclusion in regard to the
mesdames. But from the discussion which
followed the examination of each witness,
and the tendency of different questions put
by different members, the grand jury stood
as follows on the question of indictment
For indictment-W. l.. Banning, W.
Walter Mann, T. S. McManus, John Swan
zer, Henry Lynch, J. P. Larkin.-12.
Doubtful. s. Elfeldt, Howard Potts.
Against Indictment Maurice Lyon, Alex
Johnson.-2.


From the above, as it takes twelve to in
dict, it may readily be seen that the Nc
Kibben- Cochran Boardman ct al. letter has
about accomplished its purpose, unless
something turns up differently in evidence
warp that it is impracticablt
Those classed under the head of doubtful
are not considered so very doubtful after all
The indications, indicated by the grant
jury's discussion, is that they will follow tn;
lead of the majority. In this event, thos,
classed as opposed TO indictment will maxi
the vote unanimous. The presen
aspect is anything but favorable for tn
mesd ames.


Besides considering the social evil ques
ton, with the above setting up of majoritie
and minorities, the grand jury had the mat
ter of an addition and other improvement
to the city hospital under consideration
This subject came up and was laid asid
without arriving at any conclusion as t

uns Je.nuesss or T.r Her Cruise.


SAN FRANCISCO, July 9.-Ths
Jeaunette cleared port yesterday
afternoon and set off on her voyage
Of discovery in Polar seas. Her
route will be as follows: From
San Francisco she Will shape her
course northwest for the Aleutian
Islands, a distance of 2,100 miles,
To Ounalaska harbor, situated on
the north side of Ounalaska Island.
She will pass through Unalga pass
from the Pacific ocean into Beh-
ring's sea. The prevailing winds
are usually westerly, but after
reaching about 80 deg. north lati-
tude, calms and fogs prevail. From
Ounalaska, after having cOaled
ship, she will proceed to st. Pau's
leland, 240 miles distant. AT st.
Paups is a trading post of the
Alaska Commercial Company, and
l. 81, xxrtl
ply of sealskin clothing
for the crew, presented by
the Alaska company. From thence
she will sail for st. Michaels, near
the mouth of the Yukon river, a
distance of 500 miles from st.
Panl's, where dogs, sledges, snow
shoes. fu; clothing and few ma
lives will be taken on board. From
st. Mlchael's she will proceed to st.
Lawrence Bay, on the coast of
Asia, u distance of $50 miles, for
the purpose of obtaining news of
Prof. Nordenskjold's expedition, as
we'll as to procure additional fur
clothing and supplies. From st.
Lawrence Bay the Jeanette will
pass directly through Behring's
Straits into the Arctic Ocean, shap-
ing her course along the shore of
Wrangel's or Killttps Land. From
hat time forward the real business
Of the expedition will commence,
and the course they will pursue
depends largely on circumstances
and the wisdom of the commander.
The start of the Jeannette has been
delayed at least month beyond
the time originally fixed for start
ing. This delay appears to have
cen unavoidable. The Navy De-
artment originally undertook to
send man-0f-war TO convoy the
expedition as far as Behring's
Straits, but the breaking out of the
war between Bolivia and Chile rem
dered it necessary to increase our
force in the south Pacific, and the
Department., when the time came,
claimed that they had not o vessel
available for conveying the jean
nette. After waiting until further
delay would prove hazardous to the
expedition, Captain De Long, on
Friday last, chartered the Fanny A.
Hyde, and now goes forth entirely
independent of the Government.


rhe wheat Market.


New YORK. July Sth. During
the furry in breadstuff's yesterday
in the Produce Exchange a bid by
two exporters for one million BUSH
els at ST. 10 was made, but the

would be cheap at ST 25, at which
price the bulk of the European de-
mand would be filled.

everything they could, and all | hope

AUGUSTA, Dec. &C. 1879.


The political excitement in Maine, heretofore at
fever heat has been increased to fearful extent by
the report from Bangor that on Christmas Day
officer of the State in the performance of official
duties was hindered from performing these duties
by an infuriated mob of republicans urged on by
Editor Boutelle. Of the Bangor Wing and Courier.
To-day the streets Of Augusta have been thronged
with excited and curious crowd of men
anxious to learn the true situation Of affairs. The
Maine Standard printed extra edition this after
noon In which was published telegraphic reports
Bangor and other matters concerning the situ-
alton. The Standard says:-


""rhe news from Bangor is simply astounding.
Notwithstanding the incendary appeals to tae pas
sons Of men all the State, reasonable utter
ances and threats angry evil disposed persons
rebel against the regular constituted authorities Of
the State. few men prepared for actual out
break at this tme and they hardly realize that
treason actually exists in good old State and has
actually deveveloped itself in overt acts But such
are the facts. Unexpected and unwelcome as these
are they must be met and dealt with all the same
We advise calm and deliberate consideration and
action in the PREMISES but there must be yield
ing to mobs. no halting in giving firm and deter
mined support to the authorities in suppressng in
surrection. Public order must be preserved at all
hazards. and all good citizens. without distinction
of party should come forward and lend their infu-
ence for the of the dignity and peace of
the State. The only division now is to be between
loyalists and rebels Will you stand on the side of
the government or the rebellion?""


THROWING BLAME ON BLAINE.


Many influential republicans in this city deprecate
the Bangor riot ofsyesterday and say that they do
not propose to set themselves up as o mask behind
which Blaine and Han,lin may sneak. They assert
with considerable vehemence that Blaine has started
the rebellion by inauguratlng. at the expense of the
Republican State Committee the series of indigna-
ton meetings at which such loud and open threats
were made against the State authorities and of ap-
pealing to force Of arms to wrest the State House
from the legally constituted authorities there in
possession, and that IL any fighting is to be done
Blaine and his stawart associates do it. DEM
ocrats generally satisfied that the outbreak has
come. and that it started and led onward BY
Blaine and Hamlin's foremost stalwart Charles A.
Boutelle.

noon from his home in Lewiston. where he was

BANGOR, Dec. &c. 1879.
Yesterdays mob has been the general subject Of
discussion to-day Exaggerated reports created very
wild excitement in the country towns. where the
public sentiment is strongly opposed to any riotous
proceedings. Many wild rumors are ahoat and hnd
ready believers. However. stronger feeling of safety
exists among citizens than during last night. but
there is still great anxiety regards the future.
The republicans Of Old Town this morning found
that the arms of the Hersey Light Infantry not
in the armory. Old Town is the homo of Major
Smith, the green hacker, who hopes to be the next
Governor OF Maine. Il is believed that the missing
guns were carried home by the various members OF
the company. It Is currently stated that this mill
tary company can be depended upon by Governor
Garcelon in case of trouble The report has been
started this evening that . party of republi-
cans will surround the State Arsenal to-
night and attempt to seize its contents. This
only arsenal OF any account in the State. It
does not, however, contain very large quantity Of
arms and ammunition. 1t Is not known how much
truth there may bo in this startling rumor Adiu-
tant General Leavitt expected here tonight. but
he missed the train and cannot roach Bangor before
tomorrow evening.

sey Light Infantry taken possession OF by the
fusionists last night between eleven and twelve

On this lst day Of October, 1879, per-

having been duly sworn according to

placed on any conversation that occur
red between himself and Robert Brown
in reference TO the construction Of Stall
cup Run Sewer is a complete fabrica-
tion and false in every particular, and
further that he has repeatedly found
fault with the manner in which the
walls of said sewer were built, and that
the City surveyor in consequence never
approved Of the job, brt on the contrary
admitted that the work was an inferior
job and not In conformity with the
specifications. 30 far as the matter Of

""That feeling"" said he, that will take

condemnation. Men and women need
properly training even for the physical
duties Of life. Ii it is necessary to

so general that some women know No

Place good mothers in the household
and it will rsvoIutionzs the country
in short time. Our households
should be ruled by love and charity.
1t is not out of place for a man to talk
child talk to a child. The power Of
5elt.control is an essential qualification
to a good parent. Parents should
never evince anger toward child.
Parental wrath begets filial alienation.
A man who in anger strikes little
child deserves to be hanged by his ears
until he begs for mercy. 1t is mis-
take to trust entirely to the teacher tue
intellectual training of the child. What
is commonly called mischief is q very
good quality. To avoid mischief put
things they should not have out OF
their reach, and things they should have
in their reach to direc. and encourage
their ingenuity. 1t is from >>lr mothers
that We get our vocabulary. A refined
and cultured mother in the household
is worth more than all the grammars in
creation. The child who learns good
language at home will use good Ian.

learns improper language at home will
use it out in spite of all his college ed

dition as many parents predict. Not to
repress but to direct is the proper man

Resolution.


City Council meet in regular session
last evening, and In the absence of Presi-
| dent Llchtenstein Mr.. Norton was called
TO the chair. The reading of the min


utes occupied thirty-five minutes.
The Finance Committee reported that
they had examined the financial state
ment of the B ,ard of Education, and as
far as they had means Of knowing 1t was
correct.


The Water Committee made a Avora-


BILE report on the petition of Mrs. A. IL.
Allderdice, asking for rebate in the
wafer tax on the building No. 201 w.
Front street.


The Legislative Committee reported
that there was no business in their
hands.


No report was received from the City
Treasurer or the Chief Engineer of the
Water Department.


The Street Commissioner reported IL
men and double teams IN his employ,
for the week ending February 18th.
The following petitions and commune
cations weae read and referred to the re-
spective committees.


From William Bareford and others,
ASKING Council to set apart 100 feet of
space on King street, between Front and
Second, for the use of resident fishermen,
and to prevent hucksters of fish occupy
ing the space so set apart and impose
upon the citizens by not selling them
Delaware fish.


James T. Bird and others asked that a
lamp be placed on Seventh street, be-
tween West and Washington streets
The Weccacoe Fire Company asked
| that their whole appropriation be paid to
them in order to meet some unavoidable
expenses


The resolution of Mr.. Guthrie in re-
gard to funding the floating debt of the
| city at 4 per cent, which was introduced


in Council on Wednesday evening, and
published in full in yesterdays GAZETTE,
was next taken up fer consideration.
Mr.. Guthrie said that the res tuition


had been laid over in order to give the
members of Council time to think over
its merits The question before us is a
I serious one; the floating debt exists, and
it will be impossible to pay it off for
three pears. He was opposed to any
more tioatin ng debt unless it was benefit


to the city, and he thought it would be a


benefit and saving to fund the present
floating debt at 4 per cent, as it now


costs the city about 81 per cent.
| Mr.. Lynch moved that the bill be re-
ferred to the Legislative Committee, in
order that they might prepare bill in
accordance with the spirit of the reso-
luton.


Mr.. TAYLOR thought thatif the Council
acted on the resolution that was all that
was necessary, as 1t would then go to the
Legislative Committee and then they
could prepare an act and it would not
be necessary for the matter to come be-


fore Council again.


| MIR. Hart said that the resolution was


brought before Council in order to get
the the views of the members upon it


He was opposed to funding the floating
debt unless there was some safeguard
thrown around it, so that there could moi


be another created, and also that ht


would like to see a proviso in the bill


that should require three-fourths vote


of Council to pass an extraordinary ap
preparation.


MIR. McGlinchey said he thought thai
| IL would be better to have the views o1
Council on the matter. He was opposed


to funding any of the floating debt unless
there was safeguard.


Mr.. Taylor said he was favorable to the


resolution. Some people think by fund
ing the debt that it would be adding Ia
the debt of the city; this was an errone.
Gus idea, az the city would save at least
81, 600 per year in interest, but he was op.
posed 10 funding the debt, ifanother was
to be created He thought that there


should be a provision in the bill prevent
ing Council from creating another debt
aud also make it mlsdemeanor, with


heavy penalty attached for any city OH
Ger to draw Or countersign a cheek when


the appropriation is run out


Mr. Chandler said he thought that the
committee should have named some
amount in the bill to be funded. He
would be opposed to funding If the
amount was to be 100000, but he had nc


objections III funding S150,0OO.
Mr.. Guthrie said to make the matter
/ safe, if Council was to be prohibited from
1 borrowing any more money, the entire
debt up to July 1st should be funded and
that would give the Council clean sheet
to work on until the following July


when the taxes would again be paid in


By the LIST of July the debt wi Ill be about


S204 800.


Mi Lynch thought it would be safe to


ask the Legislature for power to issue
/ bonds to the amount of S20O.000.
| Mr. Taylor thought that the amount to
| be funded should tie what it was on Janu
ary 1st. The trouble is that Council
spends more money than she collects; the
| money was not st )lep, but was spent Ju
diciously the citizens got the benefit ol
it.


The motion of Mr.. Lynch to refer to
| Legs slative COMMITTEE was then adopted


and Council adjourned.

On the petition Of Gotlieb Mammele,

laid at bis own sxpense,) the Waser


Committee reported fsvorably, pro


vided the Petitioner sign an agreement


TO pay the cost, and further, shss the


cost shall be credited to the water sp-


preparation for 1879.


Mr.. McGlinchey didn't think this

bad precedent and other committees


would with the same propriety ask for
special orders in their respective DE-
partments. All such revenue should |

OF BOTH ARE SWORN IN.


At 10 o'clock, this morning, Mayor
sAllmond swore in the contractors for the
removal of ashes and garbage from the
etreets for the ensuing year, at the police
office. Street Commissioner Lynch and
Messrs. B. r. Townsend and Joseph X.
Adams Of the Street Committee were
present.


Martin Keagh, who was the lowest
bidder for removing the ashes, first en-
tered into contract. His bid was $2,374
for removing the ashes for the whole
c.ty. David McCoanaghey, who took
oath that he was bona tide free holder
of real estate to the amount Of $4,000,
went on his bond. f.t.4t..
Peter j. Robinson, the colored man
who was awarded the contract for re-
moving the garbage at $4,000, was next
Sworn to do the duties of the contract
as laid down and VIM. r.. Bullock went
his security for the faithful performance
OF the task. Neither of the contractors
objected in any particular to the con-
tracts, and the signatures were witnessed
by disinterested parties.
In conversation with Mr.. Townsend,
the chairman of the Street Committee,
a ryporter of this paper learned that the
whole matter of these two, contracts
twould be conducted in radically differ
ent manner than they had been during
the year just passed.


Iie said the Street Com nittee had con
| sdercd the matter much and had con
cudcd th It care was all that W neces
sary in securing the faithful carrying ou1
Of the cont acts. With this In view v they
had been exceedingly careful N tn

none but men who were amply able u
carry out the Jobs. The wording Of thu
contracts mad. them more specific II

intended and no place for them to ""slil

in the contract OF the ash contracto
which he thought a good one. 1t pro
vides for the keeping back of one tent
of the contractors monthly allowance

There Is one thing certain, however

Louis Octavius Woods. He is Kentuckian
by birth and an octoroon by blood. He is
so very nearly white that q person would
haye considerable trouble in pronounciny
him other than q. white man. In lS43 he
killed a white man in self defence, was tries,
defended BY Henry Clay and acquitted. A
reporter called at 162 South Clark street,
where Mr.. Woods is employed; and from him
obtained the. following particulars of the
affair:


the day that the killing occurred, Woods
was standing in front o.. the house of Viii


liam Emmerson, q. prominent citizen of
Winchester, Clark county, ky., when a
noted character, named Charles Tanks,
happened along. rtider tue influence OF
liquor, and thought he. would have
some ""fun."" Drawing a bowie ktife. he
nlnde for Woods, stabbing him once
in the forehead. once in the arm, and again
in the body. He was about to strike again,
when Woods Suddenly picked,up stick O..
wood, aud dealt his assassin blow that
killed him Instantly. AS soon as it became
kno IN that a 'njeger'' had killed a white
man, large, crowd assembled, and Mr.:
Woods says there is no doubt that they in.
tended to kill him. He took refuge in En-
merson's barn, where the feld-hands and the


Indies of the house defended him until he
was safely reno led to Jail. Here another
attempt was made to lynch him, but it was
not successful. Woods at this time was q
very Young man; was free, and had borne 4
good character. J., But tho tide of public
opinion in a slave State was strong against
him. Henry CLAW was then making an on
sleuglt on old customs that were tainted
with barbarity, and to hlm:the old father OF
Woods appealed for aid. Mr. Clay, with the
generosity which was characteristic Of him
responded al once. The case was taken be.
fore the grand jury 9 bill found
against the prisoner, and.in six weeks the
trial came of.S Mr. Clay had to contend
against popular prejudice. thatwas bitter in
the town where the killing occurred at time
when colored sman had no rights that a
white man. however brutal and depraved,
was required to respect. He nevertheless
decided to fight it out there. The point at
issue was whether a. colored man did not
have as good right to defend his life as a
white Man. In defence of his theory that
he mad. Mr.. Clay made cne of the mos. pow,
erful speeches of bis life, and tho jury re-
turned q verdict acquitting Woods wi, bout
| leaving their seats. That was thirty five
years ago. Since that time Mr.. Woods has
grown to Ike an old man. He has always
t'oFne good chara cter, and is a quiet and
peaceable citizen. :. He says thathe has only
been in Winchester twice since the affail
occurred, and then he did not tarry Very
long, IS tho people were still disposed
to snake it hot for him."""

A Remarka able Tale C0ncer ming mis-


Campalgn tor sest in Congress.",,"=


The Chicago ""Tribuns"" in . recent
issue says: A gentleman in this city,
who spent some time in the South dur
ing the exciting times of 1876, gives
some facts relating to ths election OF
Gen. Chalmers to the Congress Of the
United States in that year which have
never been published. The district
from which he was elected had been
filed for tive terms by Jno. r. Lynch,
who is represented as being q oolored
man of high character, great capability,
and honesty. 1t was inhabited almost
exclusively by colored people. When
the Legislature ofthe State re-districted
Mississippi, a long strip Of territory ly-
ing along the river being low, swslnpy,
and comparatively worthless was set
apart for Lynch's constituents, and
called the ""Shoestring District""


This strip was about 100 miles long
by three or tour miles wide. Lynch
was elected by the almost unanimous
vote of the population. ln 1876, Chal-
mers happened to live ia that district.
lie concluded he would like 10 60 to
Congress, and set about devising a plan
by which he might overcome Lynch's
enormous maj ,rity and elect himself.
The task did not seem to be q promis-
ing one, but with a resolution worthy
Of better cause, and by the employ
ment of tactics showing how we'll he
knew the negro character and the cir
cumstancps in which they were placed,
he succeeded in carrying his point. He
visit, d Jackson, the capital of the
State, and informed the Governor and
other officials of his political aspra-
tions.


The idea Of his attempting to carry
the distsict against Lynch was thought
too absurd to receive a moments con-
Chalmers said, ""Gentle-
men, you need not laugh. II | can get
help, l will show you that can so in
to the district and beat Lynch He
was asked what assistance hs required.
He replied that he wanted three pieces
of artillery and a band Of music. The
novel campaign machinery, the like ot
which was probably never employed
before, was readily furnished the
General, and he started out
with his speeches in his pocket for a
most extraordinary tour. His plan OF
procedure was as follows: On approach
ing a small village, he would unlimber
one of his pieces and discharge it into
the cane.


The familiar roar of the artillery sa-
luted the ears of the sleeping darkeys,
and filled their hearts with apprehen-
sion. The second piece was dischsrg-
ed, and then the third. By this time
all the negroes in the country around
within hearing of the terrible echoes of
the cannon Were terribly aroused at
the strange occurrence, and those in
the country came crowding into the
village TO learn what it all meant. There
all was commotion, excitement and un-
certainty. The women gathered their
young ones and started for the swamps.
The men sent ont skirmishers to take
observations and report what was go
ing on. Having succeeded by this
means in collecting the people, the
General ordered the band to play, and
marched into town with his artillery
following him. Here he halted and
informed the people that his intentions
were entirely peaceful.


He told them that he wanted to be
elected to Congress. He desired to in
form them that he was better friend
of the colored race than Lynch was.
The Democratic party was the only
party of principles, and he wished them
to understand the issues. He told
them that he proposed to talk them on
some day in the future, and he desired
to have them all come out and listen.
lie told them he wanted them to go
Immediately to work and form Tild-n
Clubs. When he approached the town
ON the day on which he was to speak,
he expected them to meet him a little
distance away and escort him into the
village.


Having completed these arrangements,
be then proceeded to another village,
until he had canvassed the entire dis
trict. He then began speech making
tour, and was invariably greeted by
large audiences. The negroes, says our
informant, seemed to bs imbued with
the idea that if they did not do as they
were instructed, another war would
break out in which they would all be
exterminated. Ths result of this cam
paign was. that Chalmers carried the
district by over 5000 majority. This
Was the way in which Chalmers gained
his election.

these crimes, nor has there been suitable ac-
Acknowledgement or confession Of them, nor

of the Methodist Episcopal Church in the
South are fully recognized.

THE STORY or TIE CALAMITY.


The whole story Of tho fire is here presented. II
was about twenty i've minutes past two A. M that
the Indications OF hre were discovered at the
four story brick tenement No. 80 Cannon street by
John King. an upholsterer. who has . store on the
ground floor Of No. 81 and who lives in the southern
end Of the house on the third floor. He
awakened by smell Of smoke and
the sound of cracking flames. Gathering hastily
his two children under his arms and awakening
his wife he rushed down stairs. beating the door
OF the floor below to rouse up the family. thereby
saving the lives Of Mrs. Wood and her two children.
The fire alarm that was At sounded brought
Engine No. IL. Truck No. IL and the insurance
patrol quickly to the spot, and the flames
under control. About the time the engines arrived
John Bodzky, who lived on the top floor. appeared
at window in his night dress and screamed loudly
for help. He held up his nttle baby eight months
old in his arms and declared that the stairway
impossible to pass because Of the smoke. Frantic
with fear no put down the child and jumped from
the window forty feet above to the hard fagway be
neath. and fell with loud thud directly on his
head. within few inches of the curbstone. Ho was

Tho fire aroused tho inmates OF all the ncghbor-
Ing tenement houses. not much on account Of tho
exhibition Of bright and startling flames. as these
were smothered in the excessive en- mission of smoke
but rsther by the racket caused by tho hremcn and
the imprisoned inmates of tho tenement. Tho fire.
mon behaved nobly. They ascended to tho roof of
tho house and tricd to force entry through It, but
the smoke poured out in such from the holes
they cut with their that they driven back.
Mrs. Woods children. who lived the Rivington
street side OF the hall the second floor. wero
saved by Fireman Mclean. who, though blinded by
pmoke, dashed In and ut tho imminent risk OF his
Hfe brought them safely out. The pcrformances of
Tho aremen were of the most heroic kind. Fireman
Patrick J. Lynch deserves especial recognition. He
climbed tho fro escape Mt tho rear Of the building
and through binding smoke and nsme made his
way into tho front parlor of the floor whore the
Botxski family were crouching In abjeot fear.


Three times he ventured through the sitting
smoke to the Botzski family. At the second
attempt he got hold of Mrs. Botk but she. frantic
with fear resisted his efforts to her and no i'm
perilled his own safety.


A YRAErIo STRUGGLE.

must CO."" said Lynch, ''if 1t costs my life.""
The woman sprang from has clutches and rushed
into the front room to her fato. Lynch was

to have a carriage in waiting two
miles east of Kearney, where the
train stopped, when Richards was
transferred TO the carriage and safe

by Gladstone's reference to the
Irish Church. ""Down to the veal

yesterday. before Judge Cowing appeared for Lynch
and demanded o separate trial. Lynch Is painter
and poor man. His aged mother sat at his side
trembling for fear evidently that her son would DO
convicted of the offence charged and sent TO State
Prison. The complainant testified that he was at
tackled by Lynch and Murray. and that one of them
seized his watch and chain and ran away with them
Mr. Kintzing desired to test the truthfuness of Won
Felde and asked him whether he had been
conductor on o street To this the witness
answered with an emphatic ""No."" and added that he
was never connected as conductor with the Third
avenue line. George Marrett. one of the spec
tators in the court room, created sensation
soon called Witness He testified that he was
street car conductor. and had worked with Won
Fede, who u conductor on the Grand street line
in April, 1878. and on the Third in De-
censber of that year and in January of this yenr.
Mr.. Kntzing called the jurys attention to the fact
that the complainant was not entitled to belief.
Counsel proceeded to show that the prisoner and
his companion were passing along Grand street and
were grossly insulted by the complainant Counsel
admitted that the prisoners gave Won Fede good
thrashng, but denied that they robbed or attempted
to rob him. In the court room yesterday the prs-
oner Lynch and Won Feide found that they had ex-
changed hats in the scufie. and they each secured
their own. The exchanging OF the hats created much
merriment. The complainant having been de-
tected in misstatement desired to make an exp!a-
nation, and claimed to have misunderstood the
question put to him by the prisoners counsel.
The jury smiled ut the explanation, remember
ing the emphasis with which the complainant
denied that he had formerly been in the employ Of
the Third Avenue Railroad and that he was dis
charged. Mr.. Kintzing argued that the prisoner
was guilty only of simple assault and battery and
that it was probable that the complainant robbed
himself. Assistant District Attorney Lyons asked
for verdict of robbery in the first degree, arguing
that the fight was but sham for the accomplish
ment Of the robbery. Judge Cowing declared the
law and impartially reviewed the facts. The jury
retired to deliberate ut two o'clock returning ut four
O'Clock and declaring their inability to agree where
upon Judge Cowng discharged them from further
consideration Of the case. Mr.. Knitting said that
the prisoner willing now as he was before being
tried, to plead guilty to simple assault and bat

the offer OF counsel especially the jury had dis
agreed upon the question the guilt OF the pris-
oner Of robbery in the FIRST degree. Assistant Dis
trict Attorney Lyons not being in court the Judge
declined to accept the plea until Mr.. Lyons was
present. ana remanded the prisoner. The jury, it
understood. stood eight tor assault and battery

JAMES DEvLIN REINsTArED.


According to the Philadelphia Saiddy Times,
James Dcvlin, who has the reputation of be-
ing the best pitcher of the baseball in the
country, after more than months work,
pleading with the members of the judicial
committee of the National Association, has
been renstated. The question was decided
Saturday. Devlin was expelled from the
League about three years ago for selling out
games. He was pitching for tho Louisville
team. There was q bitter fight between the
Kentucky boys aud the Bostous for the cham
pionship. The Louisville club had been play.
ing brilliantly, but, starting unon their final
Eastern tour, they lost nearly every game. An
investigation was brought about, and 1t was
proved beyond doubt that Dcylm had con-
trcted with the booksellers to lose certain
games. Since then DeVlin has tried his best tC
atone for his mislcCds.

Mr.. Rodney asked and obta ned uliani-
nous consent to the floor. He said that
great rumber Of citizens had approach
ed him In regard to the City hospital,
and asked him to take immediate steps
looking toward the abolishmeut of that
institution. He desired to give notice
that he would introduce at an early date
an ordinance abolishing the oili.e of
Superintendent of City Hospital, aud
also the Office of City Hospital physician.
As the hospital is established by an act
of Legislature, be would, when the time
came to make the appropriations, siren
uously oppose any approp' iation to that
institution except mere nominal sum,
He hoped the ordinance would receive
the unanimous votes of the Council.
As so many citizens had approached him
in regard to the matter he thought il but
just to give notice, and not pass the
matter over lightly.


The Water Committee, on the petition
of &. Mamele, asking for the laying of
water pipes on Poplar street, between
fiflh and Sixth streets, to supply thlr-
teen houses which he is building IN a
cou.t, he agreeing to pay the expense
thereof, made the following report


Your Committee would port favor
ably, provided he signs au article of
agreement for paying fot the work when
it was done, and gives bond for the fai,l- =
ful performance of the agreement; and
provided further, that the amount for
such work be credited to the Water
Committee.


Mr.. McGlinehey was opposed to the
report. lie thought the committee hat.
no right to the MONEY. 1t should be de-
posted in bank to the credit of the gen
eral fund.


Mr.. Paynter called for the question.


Mr.. McGlinchey raised the point OF
order, and asked the chali to give his de-
cision In the mater.


President ShaIpley said he was not
able 10 say where the money should
go.


Mr.. Paynter said that the Committee
could not do the work unl,ss the money
which it would cost, came back to their
credit. Their appropriation would not
admit of il.


Mr.. Taylor said he could see no oh,
lection either to the petition or
the report. The petitioner was
building thirteen houses which would
lie thought that the committee could lay
the pipe much cheaper than the gentle
man himself, and the Committee in pay
ing for the work would take the money
from their appropriation, and he thought
it but just, when the money was paid
back, that the Committee should have it,
Mr.. McGlinchey, thought by adopting
such report it would be establishing d
bad precedent. Other Committees when
they were short would ask the samt
thing.


The report was rejected by rising
vote of eight to seven.

Mr.. McMenamin stated that the com

them, and both of the gentlemen real
filmed what they had stated under oath
In the absence of any other evidence th
committee could not arrive at any Othe
conclusion than that submitted i

Lynch were quarrelling all the time tina
the work was going on, Mr.. Lynch de
mandiug that more cement should b
put in the work, and Brown refusing t.

To tie President and Members Of CIT

GENTLEMEN Your committee ap
pointed to confer with the r., W. d b

the railroad bridge over the Brandywine
respectfully reports conference witt
Mr.. Cha les Warner, director of sai'
company, and Mr.. j. l.. Smith, its Su
pervisor of Bridges. These gentlemen
are of the opinion that their compan,
has no right under its charter to maxi
such footway, either inside or outside o
the bridge that it would induce traye
in a dangerous place, and make thei
con pany responsible for all accident
! which might occur, and that the DANCE
would not be lessened, but increased
by the use of gates. They have, how
ever, disposition to meet such publ
convenience as Council may think pro
per, and are willing to build a toolwa.
at their expense, if Council will agree tt
assume all the responsibility for acci
dents to persons passing over it. You
committee think that this Council ha
no authority to enter into any sucI
agreement, and If it had authority to d.
so, it would be very unwise to ASSUME
such responsibility. We recommend tina
the bridge watchIlan appointed by lii
railroad company be invested with pollc
authority over the traffic on the bridge.

Harris, al the Wononsco House, Lakeville, last Thurs day evening, which, in spite of the inclenl- ency of the weather, was attended by over hundred guests who assembled to offeI congratulations upon the twenty fifth recur renee of the anniversary of the felicitous and solemn event, a quarter of a century ago, when

 They pledged their faith, in life or death, ln happiness or woe,

 And sealed the promise with a ring;''

 and enduring and valuable silver tokens of friendship and esteem.

 On the arrival of Cummjngs' train from the East, which brought the Putnam Phal- anx of Hartford and others, the formal re coption was held in the parlor by the hos, and hostt sa. after which they were re-nar- ried by Major Brown of the Phalanx, amid the scclamatiens of the witnesses. This ceremony over, the guests, in response to the summons, proceeded to the dining room to partake of munificent rePast of good things and appetiz!ng delicacies under which the table fairly groaned until relieved by the willing company, with appeiites whetted by the delicious prospect, and before which the toothsome dainties disappeared like dew before the morning sun.

 After supper Gel. Harris underwent rigorous and conclusive examination before committee of the Putnam Phalanx, prelu. sive to being admitted to full membership in that body. The examination was bur lesque gotten up for the occasion, and the questions propounded were as amusing az some of the Colonel's quick and witty re- torts. The result proving satisfactory, ht was accepted as full -fledged member, in recognition of which the Phalanx present ed him, in 6 neat presentation speech by Major Brown, with magnificent silver tea set of six pieces, on each piece being en- graved letter, the whole forming the word Harris"" :"" and tue first piece containing the inscription ""Prespntt d to Col. H. P. liar. ] ris and wife by members of the Putnam Phalsnx, April 3, ls54-ls79,"" together with a large and beautiful album filled with photographs, most of them being of the friends who visited Col.

Robert Brown. the contractor for the

save enough material from the sewer to
do some work at Mr.. Lynch's residence,
Also o save enough cement for the pur-
pose from the sewer Job, by laying the
stones there without usi, z any cement.

attending to the street work In differ

found. II Is understood, however, that
though indignant at the charges made
by Brown he Is disposed to take no no.
tice Of them, knowing they are unwar-
ranted by the facts, and feeling sure
they will not receive the credence of
those who know him and his accuser.


The trouble between Brown and the
Street Commissioner, originated several
weeks ago, when the latter refused to ap-
prove Browns work on the sewer.
Brown wanted some money on account
Of the contract, and as the ordinance re-
quires sewer work to be approved by the
Commissioner before 1t Is paid for, the
subject was referred TO the City Surveyor,
who reported that the work was being
properly done, with the exception of a
few tritiing defects.


| A correspondent IN another part of to.

required to furnish all materials except
the stone, and therefore could not have
taken any material from the city II he
had done any work for Mr.. Lynch. Mr.

Away in the distance Loudoun heights
were seen. Near by was Rock Hall run:
little further the railroad track, and as
the bleak wind whistled through the
leafie,s trees the dark body swayed gent
ly like pendulum. The, clothing was
covered with mud, the left arm, from
which the coat had been torn, was bare
and dirty, the head dropped to the right
touchiu ug the limb ofthe tree; the knot
had slipped behind his right ear, the
tongue was protruding and the face,
with all its darkness, looked wan and
ghastly. Nobody ventured to touch the
body, every one seeming to wait the ar
rival of the coroner, but it was broadly


limited that there would be difficulty in


obtaining n jury, as almost every man in
the neighborhood had lent hand in the


lynching.


A ride of three miles, over a rough


""corduroy"" road, bought the news-seek-
to Licksville, where Mrs. Thomas lives.
The house stands near the road, and is a
plain two-story wooden structure. Car
roll worked for Mr. p. N. Leapley, and
| on Monday last was sent with plow-
Henry Droenberg. Whilst there 1t is


supposed that he picked up some horse

ued the pursuit OH foot and captured the
fellow.


As heretofore shown, the prisoner was
taken to the Washington depot of the
Baltimore and Ohio railroad and left for
Frederick by the 4:30 p. NJ. train in
charge of officers II. G. Volkman and B.
+. Harper and In company of Mr.. Rich
ard Thomas and his brother f. e.. Thorn
as. About this time number OF farm
ers were gathered around the depot at
Point of Rocks. Ever since Tuesday
last there had been vigilanr search for
the criminal. Men left their labor and
secured the country night and day in the
hope of capturing the outrager. On
Thursday afternoon a telegram was re-
ceived from Sandy Hook that colored
man answering the description of Car
roll had been seen at the caves near that
place. While waiting to hear further as
to this news the following telegram was
received by Messrs. Jarboe Il Oifut from
+. q. Thomas ""Prisoner caught, will
leave on 4:30 train. Send notice to Lick
Vile. Meet Dick at depot""


AS soon as the message was received
hurried consultation was held by those
present, and IN few minutes a mounted
messenger, bearing the name of ""Brick""
Pomeroy, although not akin to the Wes-
tern political economist, started to bear
the message to the neighbors In the coun-
ty. The fiery cross in the time of Rod
erick Dhu and Scottish clans could not
have been carried swifter, and in about
an hour from 125 to $50 men, some on
foot, others Oh horseback. and about 20
of them colored, had gathered near the
depot. Several of them boarded the
tram at Tuscarora, four miles from Point
of Rocks, but gave no intimation as to
the object of their journey. As the train
drew near the depot it stopped on the
siding in order to allow the east-bound
train to pass. At this juncture about
twelve or fifteen men entered the car in
which the prisoner was seated with his
captors, and, selling him, began to drag
him to the platform. The police officers
protested, but uselessly, and as soon as
the man had reached the platform OF the
car a rope, with an ordinary moose, was
placed around his neck, and he was drag
ged towards the ground. AS he fell,
with his head on the track and his feet


in the air, the east-bound train passed by


narrowly missing the half strangled man.
and almost striking one of the vigilahtes


who was holding TO him. As soon as


the train had passed he was dragged

 pr Verdi, of the National Board of Health, on receiving the news of the outbreak of yellow fever at Memphis, expressed the fear that the country is to be visited by another epidemic. It is . l. I ton that the disease must have originated from germs remaining from last years epidemic, which have been rendered active by local causes and by the sum- mer heat. It is not considered that the prevalence of the fever at Hayti and Havana had anything to do with the breaking out of the disease at Memphis, especially as no advices have been re- ceived here of it's existence at any other place in the South. The National Board of Health will at once take vigorous measures to prevent the spread of the pestilence.

 The yellow fever excitement is in. creaslng in Memphis. All the southern cities liable to the contagion have quar- antined against Memphis, and the Board of Health of the latter city has directed the people to quietly remove their fam flies to places of safety. A number of deaths have occurred.

 A serious powder explosion took place at Brodie, so dispatch from San Francisco says, in the old Standard h. cline. The works were blown to pieces, and large number of miners were killed.

Last Tuesday evening, the St. Georges Y.
n. B. Association gave an entertainment in st.
Mary's school hall, Constance street, for the
Joint benefit OF their relief fund and OF st.
Joseph's Orphan Asylum. Notwithstanding
the weather was such that few persons cared
to leave their comfortable fresides, the hall
was nearly filled to it's utmost capacity. The
tickets and programme announced the enter
tainment to be musical and dramatic. The
only musical feature we saw about the affair
was few members of q very weak orchestra.
We had great sympathy with these gentlemen.
The cornet-man must have distended every
vein in his neck, strained every joint Of the
three fingers of his right hand and worn off at
least an inch of his tongue in endeavoring to
draw from his instrument those ear-splitting
notes which struck our ears. We are afraid
that the violin players must be prostrated, |
even to this day, from shock to their nervous
System, after the dismal filing and rasping |
sounds they extracted from their uuofendipc |
and accomplishing instruments. In our nnis !
ion, an entertainment pretending to be in any
ways musical should consist of a few songs
duets, trios, or quartettes, with an occasional
Introduction of Instrumental selections. But |
thla particular one was lacking in all of the
above with the exception of the orchestra.


The dramatic portion consisted of two Ger
man and two English farces As regards the
two former, we are not sufficiently oonverssnt
with the German tongue to write a criticism.
With respect to the two latter, we would
state that they were fairly performed. The
scenery and costumes were appropriate, the
cast very good, and the playing satisfactory,
except the usual drawbacks characteristic of
most amateurs. We would remind these young
gentlemen that q thorough knowledge of the
lines excuses many shortcomings in stage
business. The tableaux were the features of
the evening. The first consisted of repre-
Sentation of ''The Spanish Camp the second,
ITO Arms /"" the third, ""Death of orzo""-sll
taken from the play of ""The Fathers Curse.""
The unanimous verdict of the audience de-
clared these the very best features of the

large as on previous occasions, were suf1 oient

KILLED IN CALIFORNIA.",,"


A DELAwAREAN WHO WENT WEST II
Nj U r u e RED ""DETAILS OF THE
CRIME.


Mr.. Thomas Samworth, of this city
who went to Colorado on March 4th, re
turned last night and brought the infor-
nation of the killing of Joseph Jaggard
who was born and raised near Newark,
and who left New Castle County Just
after the close of the war. The only in
telligence that Mr.. Samwolth brought of
the matter was clipping from the
Btggs Register, published at Biggs,
California


This was given him at Tablow, Won
datto County, Kansas,by II. ii. Jaggard,
brother of the murdered man, with the
request that he have it inserted in the
GAZETTE. The dead man was about
40 years old and was a staunch Demo-
crat. AT one time during the Rebellion
an attempt was made to lynch him near
Newark. The clipping from the Register
is as follows:


""Thursday evening at 7.2O Joseph F.
JaSgard, well to do farmer, of the
farming firm Of Jaggard u Gilkyson,
living six miles north of town, was stab
bed through the heart with bowie
knife, by man lately from Stanislaus
county, calling himself Frank Peterson.
The circumstances and facts of the case,
as shown before the Coroner's jury, are
about as follows:


About 7:2O o'clock p. m, Mr.. Jaggard,
who had been in town nearly all day,
was preparing to 60 home, and for some
purpose crossed the street to the railroad
depot, close to where this man Peterson
and another man, whose name is un-
known, were sitting on the edge of the
platform.


A good many harmless witticisms had
passed between Mr.. Jaggard and the lat
Ter person during the day on politics
without any otfense being taken on eithef
side. The joking was renewed In the
same good natured way between Jag
gard and this man, who was at the time
iting beside Peterson, Peterson, listen
ing, but taking no part in the converse
tion until Jaggard started to cross the
street, ard haf gone about fifteen feet,
when Peterson sung out to him that he
had heard enough from him-or some
thing to that efiect-whereupon, Jaegard
turned around and made some such re-
mark as ""Hhat business is it of yours you
damned s. of b., at which Peterson,
without saying word, jumped up and
running to where Jaggard was standing
IN the middle of the street, plunged his
DO we knife into him twice, once in the
a6ndmen and once about two inches be-
low the left nipple, between the fourth
and fifth rib,piercing the left ventricle of
the heart--killing him almost intantly.
Immediately after doing the stabbing
the murderer attempted TO escape, but
was overtaken and captured within forty
Yards distant by A. F. Lashells, and de-
livered to Deputy Sheriff Flint, who
lroned him and put him in the lookup.
For whlle intense exc tement prevailed
and strong disposition was manifested
by some OF our best citizens to hang him
forthwith. In fact rope was
being prepared for that purpose
when Deputy Sheriff Flint, who
early in the excitement forsaw
the danger of keeping the prisoner in
town over night, drove up to the station.
house with spring wagon, quickly took
The prisoner aboard, and with several
gentlemen as guards, started by the way
OF back street for Oroville, where they
| ~ ""hhOho interruption anu OcllV
ed their prisoner to the Sheriff. So colo
blooded ard unprovoked was the murder
that the most conservative of our cti-
zens, while advising that the law be per-
mitted to take its course, would not
have raised hand to prevent summary
punishment. Had the prisoner been al
lowed to remain in town a half houl
longer we feel quite certain that he
would have been hung.


A post-mortem examination and Cor
oner's inquest were held, Justice Norman
OF Gridley presiding, establishing the
facts as to the murder about as we have
stated them, and verdict of willful
murder, against the man calling himself
Frank Peterson, redered by the jury.
The body of the murdered man was TAX
en- charge of by his friends and will be
buried to-day in the cemetery at Chero-
kee. The murderer is total stranger,
having only arrived in town on the morn
OF the day the deed was committed, and
seems to be one OF the better class of
tramps as he had two dollars and half
on his person when searched. He claims,
we believe, to hail from the State OF
Iowa.


The Register, it will he seen, does not
give the precise date of the crime, but it
must have taken place within the past
thirty days"

under these laws and the constitution of the State
the Supreme Court has decided that corpse or its
burial is subject to ecclesiastical cogpizance nor
to sacerdotal power. In which respect this matter
differs from any under the English government,
like that OF Guibord. for instance in which the &C.
clesiastca laws recognized and enforced by the
civil power.


The Catholic Church claims prescriptive right to
decide whose remains shall be inferred in conse-
Grated ground. and to what shall be done with the
ground after it has been thoroughly used for burial
purposes; and the question Of this prescriptive
power in antagonism to the law of the State the
whole question of the Coppers case will be settled
The Catholic view Of the subject is that cemetery
the ground apart for the reception Of the dead of
the Church-is second only to the church edifce
itself in its sacred character and it is therefore
secrated with particularly solemn religious cere-
monies. Great is taken to preserve it undefled,
by the exclusion of everything unclean and unholy;
and this is reason for the adoption Of the rule
all interments in it shall be strictly in accord
ance with the rules Of the Catholic Church.


BISHOP EYNcHs VIEWS


Bishop Lynch, of Charleston, in conversation with
a HERALD reporter. said. giving what he considered
the Catholic side of the question that the only right
acquired by the purchaser Of plot in Catholic
cemetery is the right OF sepulture. subject to the
regulations of the trustees corporate body. He
said that any time the trustees disturb bodies
il they see fit, use the ground in any manner
they may deem best for the interest of the Church.
The regulations in regard to the burial of nonCath-
olics or members Of societies not always
oaid fho pichnv lint fhav acarfa ap1y
implied. 1t is hardly reasonable to presume that
Protestant would purchase plot in Catholic
etery without understanding that the responsibility
and right devolved on the trustees Of determining
the mode in which burials should be conducted
and the classes of persons that might be admitted.
savings bank or insurance company. and who will
assert that such companies have not the right to
prescribe Wicn % ~ o,nd a sno
the claim of the cemetery corporation is simply
that it is sustained by its charter from the
civil power in enforcing its contract with
any purchaser. There is no conveyance
in fee in Catholic cemetery. Not one of them
would convey title in fee for plot, for obvious
reasons. Ii the absolute owner of
plot in cemetery his creditors could attach the
property and dispose of it as they would his house
or barn farm. just fancy what parcelling of
grave plots there would be, for any purpose that
might suit the parties into whose hands they would
chance to fall. To speak plainly. such condition
of things would leave no permanent resting place
ton all. but it will hinge upon the simple
whether party is or is not bound by his contract
cHURcHYARD.


The view taken of the matter by those outside Of
the Catholic Church is based the fact that eccle
sstcal law Is here subservent to the CIVIL and the
| only thing left free to churches or religious socie
ties is the matter of their faith or method of
ship. AS members OF the community they
amenable to the laws OF the State enacted for their
| government as bodies of citizens incorporated to-
gether. In the special of Calvary Cemetery the
powers of the trustees and their duties are laid down

of the funds Of the said Cathedral the free school
thereto belonging. This special charter allows. as
was then customary, the existence of churchyard
or burying ground Immediately surrounding the
church. or the purchase Of a burying ground else
where, and with such an accompaniment the Cathe.
dral began its existence. The growth of the city and
the increase of the Catholic element in tho popuia-
tion successivey demanded hrst. the cemetery on
Eleventh street. near avenue A. and eventually in
1SiS, the purchase OF the grounds on Long Island,
and known Calvary Cemetery. The success of





OF 1sl7. Joined to the necessity for ample space
led to tho selection Of the farm Newtown Crock.
1t was designed, not for the exclusive of the
Cathedral society. but for all the Catholic churches
in the diocese. Bishop Hughes Areeing not to con-
secrate another burying ground. and thus, by
ecclesiastical ruling, depriving every other
Catholic religious society in the diocese Of New
York of the right and privilege under the civil law
of caring for and buryng their own dead and bene-

THE RELIGIOUS QUESTION EXCLUDED.


No restriction on funerals has before been
attempted in Calvary, and at first 1t was supposed

the cemetery and the kinsmer-of the deceased. The
assurance OF Bishop Lynch and the intention to try
the case on its mcrits will, however, confno the
matter to the simple point ""Must the body

has paid for, and which, under the provisions OF

 veteran aboltionist, has drawn forth many elo- quent tributes to the character and services of of that wonderful American agitator, none of which, however, equal the noble oration of that grand old survivor of the anti-slavery ad; vance ce-guard-Wendell Phillips The life and career of Garrison is the most wonderful in- stance on record in American history of the controlling power of right over wrong. This obscure young printer began his life-work with two months imprisonment in Maryland jail for denouncing the interstate slave trade as domestic piracy"" It was the opening gblund- CT of Slavery in it's contest with Abolitionism No doubt Henry Clay felt this when he offer ed to pay Garrisons fine. Arthur Tappan had indeed, been before him in advancing the mon- ey necessary for the release of the prisoner, but the generous offer of the Kentucky slave holder showes how much true chivalry there was in the old South, as yet unheated in con- test of such unprecedented bitterness, and of such vital importance to them.

 From Maryland, Garrison went to Boston and began the publication of 'THE LIBERIA TOR"" Here he met spirit scarcely less in- | tolerant than that which he had left behind him in Maryland. Daniel Webster, the cham- | pion of the Constitution, and Lyman Beecher, | the champion of orthodoxy, ignored the new gospel Garrison had come to preach. | Once a respectable Boston mob led him through their streets with a rope about his neck; at another time he would have been lynched but for the protection of jail. The worst city of the South is today more tolerant of the Republicansm which threatens thelr property with confiscation, New York is today more tolerant of the Con- munism which denounces all property as rob- bery, than was the Boston of half century since of a theory which affected no property in Massachusetts, or within hundreds of miles of Massachusetts, and which that state had countenanced so far as to free all the slaves within her own boundaries. So greatly has Aboltionism enlarged, throughout the whole country, the practical tolerance of opinions generally supposed to be pernicious to society.

 Persecution did not bend the purpose of the great agitator; t.only raised him up friends. All the weight of Webster, the eminence of Everett, the persuasivenass of Choate, crying, ""Hush!"" could not prevail against the elo- quence of Garrison, of Parker, of Phillips de- nouncing the giant sin. A single generation saw all New England, and most of the North, revolutioniZed. The orthodox children of the orthodox Beecher, fighting against slavery, had captured the pulplts which had once re- sounded with defences of the ""peculiar sys- tem,"" and had turned their artillery against the enemy; Sumner, succeeding but not fol- lowing Webster, was fighting Garrison's bat ties on the floor of the Senate.

 Now, however, the men whose steadfast ad- herence to one just principle had reused the anti slavery spirit to political action generally gave place to the supper race of politicians who or ganized Republicanism into winning politi- cal force. Garrisons great work had been ac- complished. His fervent, cumulative temper, his lrreclaimable independence of thought and action unfitted him for any place in the dis ciplined ranks of political partisanshp. Though he could lead all men, he could follow no man. He fought nobly throughout, but always as a scout at the front, or on the flank of the main army, never in subordination to any commander.

 We wish to call attention to the fact that the anti-slavery men were among the first not ed independents"" of American politics Even after their ideas had begun to be popular, and tha tu hod It's allies, not it's subordnates. The closing raid of Old John Brown into Virginia was a distinctive Abolition movement, in defiance of Republicanism no less than of Democracy. No career better indicates the position held by the 'agitator,"" the independent"" in Ameri- can politics, than that of Garrison. He never held an office not even the most insignificant, as reward for his life devotion and his ines timable services to what became a popular and q winning cause It is only the political partisan-hodng with slight variation the creed of his sect-that is in the line of promotion in American politics. The ''in- dependent who expects anything more sub- stan,ial than the respect of his fellow citizens will find himself egregiously mistaken. The greatest of the old Abolitionists, Garrison, Parker, Phillips, Emerson, Greeley, received no political prcierment. They have been held in high estimation by the American people, but they have always been distrusted by polit- ical parties, even by the one their efforts had made possible. Neither Republicanism nor Democracy ever trusted Horace Greeley, not because he was not honest, earnest, full of the love of high and noble things, but because, through all his seeming partisanship, they could always discern the independent"" Conser- vatism-and nothing is more conservative than American party politcs-ceuld never forgive the rampant radicalism of the old Tribune.

 Though one cannot but feel that gross in- justce-a peculiarly American injustice-has been done the old anti-slavery leaders, by people now Abolitionists themselves, in the persistent exclusion from office of the very men through whose teachings they had become such, this ingratitude is not without it's uses. It secures Independence from degenerating- as partisanship so often does-into mere self ishness The American who declares his po- l'litical independence has abundant warning Though his peculiar views prove correct and become ultimately popular, he must rest satls- fled, as Emerson. Parker, Garrison and Phillips have done-but as Horace Greeley never quite could do-with the simple consciousness of having deserved we'll of his country.

 At Washington, Monday night, the Demo cratic caucus committee held prolonged ses- ssion, till two o'clock in the morning. It was finally agreed to pass the general legislative bill; but seperate bill is to be sent to the President making special appropriations for courts, and denying any funds for payment of fees of supervisors and for arrests at elections."

OPPOSITION BY TAXPAYERS.

Have the Aldermen the Power to Grant


tha Franchise?",,"terday AFTERNOON. The many applications that nave
been made from time to time for the franchise
referred by the City Fathers to either the Street
Committee or the Committee on Railroads. 1t was
intended that both of these committees should meet
yesterday. but owing to some cause other only
the latter held All persons, however, ire
spective of the roads represented. invited to
speak. and so everybody obtained hearing


The first resolutions ON the subject of railroad
on Broadway were introduced by President Mott at
the request of a number of gentlemen. BY this
measure it proposed to give permission to John
Sloan Pierre Lorlard, Albert Galiatin Stevens, John
Berry, j. Lawrence Worth, Andrew "" Stout, Law
renee Kip. William Jay, William Barton. John E.
Brooks and their associates and assigns to operate
railroad from the South ferry to Seventeenth street
and Broadway. One provision of the resolutions
permitted the incorporators to run their ""to
and through Union square,"" Mr. Motifs reso-
utions were submitted at the meeting of the Board
held on February IS. At the next session Alderman
Morris noticing the fact that the proposed company
offered only to give as consideration Of the
grant five per cent of their gross receipts,
presented long series Of preambles and reso-
utions the subject. The fathers of Dir. Morris
measure August Belmont, William II. Appleton,
Heron A. johnson, George J. Forrest, Zachariah
Jaques sand their associates and assigns The OBJ
jectionable words Ito and through Union square
that appeared in President Motifs proposition were
stricken out by Alderman Morris, and in their place
were substituted 'to and around Union square,""
This company agreed to give five per cent of their
gross receipts to the city to keep the pavement be-
tween their tracks and two feet outside good re-
pair; to remove the snow the carriageway of
Broadway. between Bowling Green and Fourteenth
street, within hrtysx hours after each fall of snow
and to sweep and keep clean the thoroughfare.
Various penalties were imposed for noncompliance
with these conditions. Although President Motifs,
resolutions sent to tho Committee Rail-
roads Mr. Morris referred to the Street
Committee. On March 4 Mr.. Morris introduced
letter from Messrs. Belmont. Appleton. Johnson and
their associates. by which they offered to relay the
pavement on Broadway as to make the grade of
the street uniform. This also sent the Street
Committee.


The meeting of the Aldermen held on the 11th
inst. the scene of the introduction of no less
than four distinct and separate propositions in ref
erence to the proposed railway. Alderman Sauer
wanted the privilege given to the Broadway and
Seventh Avenue Railroad Company, because they
already occupied the upper part of Broadway; Alder
man Haughton introduced resolutions giving the
franchise to the Forty-second Street. Manhatsapve
and st. NtQoolas Avenue Railway Company. while
Mr.. John T. Haskin, in communication to the
Common Council wished to become possessed of
the franchise in behalf of himself and Messrs.
Robert B. Mooney, Washington Hadley, Jerome
Buck James O 'Brien, Theodore E. Tomlinson, Robert
L. Catherwood, James Phelan, George w.McLean.

the Aldermen Mr.. Roberts submitted resolutions by
which the franchise to be put up at auction and
disposed of to the highest bidder. The Street Com
mittee took charge of them Alderman Morris. at
the last nesting held on Tuesday last also presented
resolutions on the subject He wished 70 have the
privilege given TO the highest bidder. His measure
also contained number Of stipulations and agree
ments TO be entered into by the successful bidder

time since, Is too well known to need any comment.


DISCUSSING THE VARIOUS PROJECTS.


The committee consists of Aldermen Il. Hail.
Jacobus AMI Roberts. The session was held in the
Aldermanic meeting chamber and the room was
well filled with persons interested in the different
projects before the Common Council Among those
present Messrs. John H. Strahan. Simeon f.
Church, John L. Haskin. Samuel b. Church. George
H. Moore John .B. Mooney. cx-Alderman Robert Nc
Cafferty and others.


Mr.. GEORGE H. Nehrba was the first speaker He
said that he against the construction of a rail-
road Broadway. aud represented in his opposition
the Central Taxpayers Association II was said that
a railroad was necessary but this argument, he
thought, could not be successfully uPneld. Why
should railroad be built on the only available
street for commercial purposes in this cityg II the
road was constructed il would ruin business, and
merchants would be compelled to move to other
quarters. II was stated that business had gone TO
the upper part OF the city; and whyg Because the
people had moved up town. They objected to the
privilege being granted


First-Because under the law power on the sub
ject is vested in the Common Council.


Sccond-Becausc the privilege of the charter which
authorizes the Aldermen to have control over the
streets of the city in the matter OF railroads. relates
only to existing railroads.


Thrd--That this power over existing railway
companies is limited to providing the rate of fare to
be charged the rate of speed to DO used in travelling
and other matters.


fouSfs-The Common Council has no power what
ever. either under the constitution or under the
charter. to authorize u railroad on broadway.


FtLh--Under law of 1854 1t is provided that the
common councils of cities shall not permit railroads
to be constructed i'm any street without the consent
OF majority of property owners in interest along
the proposed route.


MR.. HAskIS's vIEws.


Mr.. John Il. Haskin appeared on behalf OF the
proposition which he presented 10 the Aldermen
some time since. Mr.. Haskin said he took the
ground that the city of New York should have full
power and control all the franchises ia its gift
1t should operate railroad on broadway just the
same a. the authorities controlled tho Croton Aquc-
duct or the Central Park and other public works.
He gave history OF various efforts that had been
made from time to time by himself aud Others TO
have franchises disposed of with the greatest benefit
to tho people. The way privileges were given away
and had boen given away i'll the past was
shame. Ine city was SIMPLY 1ccuinB cormoraiitss


Mr.. Haskin then continued his remarks by claim
ing that ho and his associates wcro more entitled to
the privilege than either August Belmont or John
sloane. He not in favor of putting the franchise
up at auction, because who could bid against the son
of man who had accumulated over Sl0OO0O.000?
II the franchise given to him MIR. Haskinl he
would guarantee the completion of the road within
three months, and would pay into the city treasury
$1.00O0O0 ten days after tho franchise had been
awarded to him. IL the city did not like TO accept
this proposition then he would offer another one.
He would gvo to the city all the receipts of the road
except ten per cent which would be fair rate of in
tcrcst in these times The money would be paid
promptly, through the bankers. Eugene Kelly X Co.


Mr.. Haskin then went ON to give sketch of tho
different franchises enjoyed by the various railroad
companies In this city, He referred to the fact that
the Third Avenue Road recently declared dividend
OF thirtytwo per cent, and claimed that the monop
olists had for years past controlled the state
Legislature. In conclusion, Mr.. Haskin said that ho
would rather be u subject Of Queen Victoria and 1.-Two
in Canada than live under govern ncnt In which
monopolies ruled.

about. Before entered into the con
tract there were certain arrangements

Mr.. Paynter] who wanted to take S30(
out of my pocket hadb't commenced.


Mr.. Paynter-I dou't want to answer
that assertion.


Mr.. Paynter, continuing-T treat il
with contempt and consider the source
from which it comes.
Mr.. Rowe, contemptiously-Yss, with
contempt.


Mr.. Paynter then asked Mr.. Rowe a
question relating to the contract ia
which Mr.. Rowe promptly responded
""No.""


""Well then, continued Mr.. Payn-
ter, ""he has to abide by the conse.
quenos. have no:objection to his doing
the wolk, but at the same time don't
think he has a vote upon'this matter. ""


Mr.. Rowe, excitedly-Mr. Presi--


Mr.. Paynter interupting-I have got
the floor; am not done discussing the
question.


The gentleman then continued and
at ths conclusion Mr.. Rowe asked:


""Mr. President am entitled to a
vote or not I and"" turning to Mr..
Payntsr] I would like to ask him


Mr.. payntsf-I call the gentleman
to order.


Mr.. Taylor-This matter has been
fully discussed before, and l contend
that Mr.. Rowe is bound by his con-
tract and he is also bound by the will
Of the City Council.


At the suggestion Of Mr.. Taylor the
contract was read, and Mr.. Taylor con-
tinuing sontended that the contract
made provides that the contractor shall
be subject to the orders of the Street
Commissioner. IL saw in the papers
said Mr.. Taylor"" that Mr.. Rove had
said he would do with the dirt just as
he pleased.


Mr.. Rows-T didn't say so.


Mr.. Taylor-l saw it in print.


Mr.. Rowe-Oh, you will see any
thing in print.


Mr.. Taylor, then continued and
made some allusion relating to an un.
derstandiD2 existing between the City
and Mr.. Rowe, in relation to the dis
position Of the dirt.


""That's another lie,"" promptly re-
sponded Mr.. Rowe.


Mr.. Rowe then arose to an explana-
tion, in which he stated that all resolu-
tions made after the agreement had
been signed, were not valid, and that
he intended to hold the Committee to
tho contract, (Which as he says gives
him the privilege to empty the dirt
where he chooses.


Further discussion took place, when
the motion to rescind being put to a
vote resulted as follows:


Ayes - Adams, Guthrie, Jones,
Knight, Lynch, (when Mr.. Rowe's
name was called several members OBJ
iectsd, and the vote was not recorded),

Mr.. Moore gave notice that at the
next meeting he would introduce an
ord nance giving the Mayor authority
to admit patients to the City Hospital.


The following bids for erecting a
fence on Christiana avenue were read
and referred: R. II. Rowe and Charles
Cannon 90 cents per pannel; Lucas Aid

Mr.. Guthrie presented communita

the resolutions which have already beer
published in the REPUBLICAN,, as passed
by the Levy Court. He moved the
adoption of the report and further up
on his suggestion it was moved tc rsfel
the matter to the Law Committee IL

Mr.. Guthrie thought that action was
hardly necessary, as the City Council
had given the Levy Court the choice O

one at Tenth and Market.


Mr.. Lynch didn't understand the

Mr.. Paynter thought it best to have
the matter 90 to committee; but he
thought it hardly right to have 1t come
up for immediate action. 1t is all well

Mr.. Guthrie: This is useless. We
have acted upon tn, matter and We
agreed In Council by unanimous con-
sent to give half the ground or the
whole Of il necessary. We have sent a
COMMIT, t,ee to New Castle to present
that resolution to the Levy Court, and
they in good faith, have accepted; and
all this is nothing but child's play.


Mr.. Taylor: didn't understand that
this council was to give the whole
square. The resolutions that were pass
ed ,uggested that the city give 80 much
Of the ground as is necessary for the
erection of the building, and now as
the Levy Court has resolved upon q
81 it becomes our duty now to ratify
that action.


MIR. McGlinchey said he voted to give
ground at Tenth and Market streets,
but not the whole square. The city
shonld have its buildings on the same
square.


The motion to refer to the special
committees was then passed.


The City Treasurer reported 81, 49,

pensss, also that he had paid on the
draft Of the Water Commissioners since

Joseph L. Carpenter and others peti-

various streets in West Wilmington.


John H. Graham and others psti

David Lemon asked Council to remit
the ine and costs imposed upon him by
the Mayer for obstructing Shipley street
back Of his store, by backing up his
wagons to be loaded and unloaded, and
he also asked Council to pass an ordi-

Mt the beginning OF the fight had set fire 10 the

into the air and immense volumes of smoke
rolling on to engulf us. 1t was Il sight to make
the stoutest heart quake, and the ficnds were
waiting ready to give % vollcy us soon as We
were driven from our shelter. Now it reaches
the Hank and blankets, blouses and empty
sacks were freely used to extingnish the flames.
Some of the wagons were set on fire. which
required all the force possible to smother it. No
water can be obtained, and the smoke is suffo-
eating. but the fire passes and we still hold our
position. In the meantime constant volley is
poured upon us, Captain Payne being wounded
for the second time and Sergeant Dolan, of
Company +, killed instantly. McKinstry and
Mckee arc killed and many others wounded


AWAITING RELIEF.


Our greatest danger now is past. The men
have now mostly covered themselves. but the
poor horses and mules are constantly falling
about us. just about sundown n charge was
attempted but repulsed, the Indians trying
TO drive off some of our horses which had broken
loose. The attack ceased at dark, and soon
every man was at work enlargng the trenches
hauling out the dead horses, caring for the
wous led and burying the dead At daylight the
attack was resumed, and the firing of the sharp
shooters has been kept up every day since, and
occasionally at night, sending to our pits in
n scramble. This is the fifth day of our siege,
but we are determined to hold out if it takes ""a
month for succor to reach us; but we are conf

day morning, Coroner Lynch went to Iair-
| mount yesterday to hold an Inquest In Sc
cordance to the summons he hsd received

who was betrayed, by whom It is not known,
and that she took refuge in the Home of the
Friendless, where she gave birth TO
child about four months ago.
She ssSha tendency to heart
di ease, which was the immediate cause OF
her death; but IL Is said tnat il was agyraya-
ted by her troubles and the hard workin life
which she was forced 10 live, and which did
not permit her to recover fully from the ef-
fects of childbirth.


The following is the testimony before the
coroner's jury:


LUTHER ROBINSON,

Wattf laet evening anu ~ntn Inside the

able to copy into our columns, from
the Peoples AdUocate, such correct
and logical views on the debt ques-
ton, and the duty Of the colored peo-
pie respecting it, as are contained IN
the following article. AT time when
Negro voters need instruction and
guidance on this vital subject. and
when our efforts have been the sub
iect of harsh criticism and our motive
impeached as mercenary. it is tortu-
nate circumstance to be REINFORCED
by an ally 50 able and highly respec~
ted as the Ad0Ocdte. From its utter
ances our readers may learn that
principle is the same everywhere and
under all circumstances, and that
earnest allegiance to duty and right,
irrespective Of parties or mere polltl-
cal lines, is the controlling influence
among all good men Of AL races:


(Peopses advocate Of Washington, D. g.


The Lynchburg Tirgintan, has aimed to
assure the world that it is impossible for the
party of reputation now contendlng IN the
commonwealth Of Virginia for polite"" as
ccndency, to succeed Without the aid oil the
Negro vote, the obvious inference being that
this party is an insignificant minority OF The
white voters OF the Old Dominion. Having
left that impression, 1t thereby seeks to es-
cape the odium Of repupiation by making the
Negro the scapegoat.


This is but fair specimen of Southern re-
gard for truth and honesty. In the first place,
any one who i at all familiar with recent
political history il the State should know
that the ''re-adiusters"" number larger forces
with the white population than the ""fun-
ders,"" and instead of the honor of the State
being IN danger from the vote Of the Negro,
it is his vote and that Of the white Republi-
cans that must be relied on to insure an hon
est settlement Of the debt question on the
basis of the McCulloch bill.


1t is true the Republicans, as rule, have
up to this point manifested a''masterly IN
activity"" in the canvass, making few nomi'
nations and conducting no general campaign
they have hoped to see the factions of the
once powerful Conservative party of Virgin
Ia lash one another until they have the same
reciprocal affection that Tammany has fol
TIlden, or Ben Butler for Beacon Street
While this, under ordinary circumstances
wou be a good stroke Of policy, the welfare
Of The State is paramount to partisan cons
siderations. While republican interests
might be enhanced by this method, Virgin
las prosperity would be far more than II
could be remedied by any prospective reiet
through Republican ascendency. 1t is the
duty of every republican voter 10 poll his vote
for legislative candidates who want no more
tnkerng of The State debt in the way OF fur
ther ""rc-adjusment.r 1t is better far FOL
the Republican party hat through its aid re-
pudiation be defeated than by indifference
the way be opened to further uncertainty
distrust, and financial disaster.


1t is especially the duty of the coloret
voters of Virginia not to listen to th'
sophistries and fallaces Of the read
iusters. The insinuation has been made
if the honor Of Virginia suffers, it vii
be through our ignorance or villiany.""-"

LYECHBURG, Sept. %, 1879.


The Virginia (Blues) Guards of this city
have selected the number of men they Will
take to Richmond to drill during the Fair in
October.


One Prof. Wilson, who lately visited the
city to lecture on Moral Philosophy, Educa~
ton, &C., and failed in every attempt, has
gone TO other fields and pasture. and no one
laments his departure but his landlord.


Over one thousand of our citizens have vlsi-
ted Norfolk, Old Point and Hampton this
summer, and all express themselves graiied
and delighted with the beautiful scenery, the
inVIgorating salt air, and the geniality of the
people. Our people have seen and felt the
error in going to the capital of the nation and
spending so much money, and no excursions
from there come here, unless it be some So
ciety or organization; and they come to make
and take away money. But really what has
sickened our people has been the fact that

Great Problem.


The GLOBE is about tired of stating that
the grand jury is wrestling with the social
evil question. But that's what they were
doing yesterday, and have been doing for
several days as duly recorded in the GLOBE,
together with official documents received by
the grand jury Oh the subject. Yet, some
how, Bill Kings paper never
found it out until yesterday. Then
Dick, or some of his equally sagacious
disciples, revamped what the GLOBE has re-
ported for week, with indecent originality,
giving the names of parties seen about the
court house as social evil witnesses, when in
fact many were there for other purposes.
The p. P. didn't think it's dirty chickens
would come home to roost SO soon. But
$50 they do,'' for among the witnesses sum-
moned for to-day is s. B. Woolworth.
In company with him are summoned nearly
all of the physicians of the city. They are
worth being in their company and not
physician must be summoned as social evil
expert. What else?


But to the proceedings of the grand jury
yesterday. AS stated the day was wholly, or



and investigating the social evil question.
great number of witnesses were examined,
and an equally large number will be up to-
day to tell what they know and what they
don't know. In view of this fact, the con-
tinued examination of witnesses, the grand
jury reached no conclusion in regard to the
mesdames. But from the discussion which
followed the examination of each witness,
and the tendency of different questions put
by different members, the grand jury stood
as follows on the question of indictment

After the first gospel the Cardinal left the throne
and knelt at the altar while the choir sang 'veni
Creator Spritus."" He then assembled the pulpit and
preached from the gospel of the sunday. in which
narrated the fast of the Saviour for forty days and
nights. and His being tempted by the devil. From
the earliest ages of the world. the preacher said
fasting was a religious observance among all
hgious, in the pagan world and II was but fitting
that the body. which was the instrument OF SHINING
suffering 1t principally through the vicious in
dugences of the body that man sinned, and the
Catholic Church had always inculcated the great
duty of modification. The Church in the olden
time was much more severe in it's injunctons than
in the present day. and the fasts usually now pre-
scribed were lenient indeed In comparison with tho
restrictions imposed upon our ancestors IN the
faith. The Church imposed no more than our poor
frail nature would bear. The observance Of this
Lcnten season not merely an institution of man.
Tn example as given in the gospel of the day was
set by the founder of the Church Himself. The fast

pericnce had taught that II only when the body
and it's passions were subducd that the mind was
free to fix Itself heavenly things. The lives Of
the saints full of illustrations OF these Ia the
advantages of fasting and their implied belief in the

are leaving, Mississippi, who understands
the oppressive laws that have been pass
ed by the Democratic party, and which
must invariably result in reducing the
negroes back into state Of abject help
l.ssness worse than the systsm OF slav-
sry from which they had been ireed'
Hinder the head ""reducing the judi
ciary expenses"" the Legislatrre has
devised plan providing that all pris-
ouers committed to county jails' shall
be delivered ov or TO certain labor con-
tractors and worked on farms or in
any other manual labor. There is no
provision whatever made in the law
for the good treatment Of the prisoners
by the person to whom they are farmsd
ont, The contractor builds his own
jails and stockades and keeps them in
1t when not at work, and when at WORK
they are under heavy guard appoint
ed ry the contractor. They are thus
kept and worked for their board until
the time for their imprisonment expires,
and if they have not been able to pay
the fine and costs which were imposed
upon them, they are kept until these
also are worked out at an allowance Of
twenty-five cents a day. They must
also work out the cost Of keeping them
in Jail while awaiting trial, and for
every day lost by sickness they must
work two extra days to make it up.
This sort Of convict slavery is establish
ed principally for misdemeanors and
other petty offences, transgressions Of
a grave character being punished by
confinement in the penitentiary, of
those who escape lynching or hanging.
1t will he very evident to our intelli'
gent readers that in community
where negro freedom is unpopular, there
would be very little trouble under syss
TEN of penal administrations in holding
a considerable part Of the colored popu,
lation in bondage more onerous than
slavery.


For almost any fancied infraction of
the law for which white man would
be overlooked, a negro will be ar
rested and made to undergo the horrors
of this penal law. The contractor has
no interest, as the old slave-owner
had, in keeping his laborers strong and
healthy; he is at liberty, subject only
to an occasional official inspection, to
work them to the very utmost limit OF
human endurance. He may treat them
as he pleases. And when it is desired
to put colored men into the chain-gangs
opportunities will not be lacking for
doing 50. A charge of ""disorderly con-
duct"" can always be brought against
an obnoxious negro. He can be kept in
iail lorg time awaiting trial, and
every day of this delay will increase
the costs and Jail expenses, which he
must ultimately work out. Suppose be
is then sentenced to pay fine of 800 ;
that will be equivalent to 400 days Of
forced labor, besides the time spent in
working out the costs; and If he has
the misfortune to fall sick, he must pay
a further penalty for that bad luck, in
the shape of double work. Consider
also the numerous arrests of negroes
for petty larceny, vagrancy, drunken,
ness and other offences and the numer-
GUS offences which can be created by
statute expressly to entrap them, and
it will be plain that there need be no
lack of convict labor in the State Of
Mississippi.

Coal VALLEY. W. Va. July Q. 1879.
few days ago Clark Lee negro man. who has
inquired to some extent in certain circles of colored
society in Richmond and who is probably well known
to Chastine Cox, committed most atrocous assault
upon Mrs. Settle. wife Of the County Treasurer of
Fayette county. W. Va. Mrs. Settle had the courage
to resist him. and before Lee could overcome
her he had broken one of her legs
and her collar bone and pulled out her
tonsils. The screams of the lady drew her children
to the room and their outcries frightened off the
villain The outrage. of course. occasoned great
citement and dozens OF mounted and armed set
out IN pursuit of the fugitive. Fsyette county is
the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. and partly in
the Kanawha Valley. The county is wild and rugged
and the mountaineers do not know the use of the
galows. One has not been erected in that
section for years. Whenever such an offence
as this is committed the people 'turn out""
the constabulary ""turn in"" sapling is selected
and lynch law in all of its merciless promptness and
severity administered. Lee knowing the popularity
of the West yirginians in this respect. fed for
dear life. BY almost superhuman excrtions and
after considerable suffering. he got far Parkers-

JUST IN TINE.


There on Saturday last he captured and the
Fayette authorities notified just in time to the
life of another negro. believed to be Lee. who
was in the hands of mob down in the county. and
who would otherwise have been hanged Monday.
In fact a great crowd was already in
attendance awaiting the event. Lee put under
tho custody OF an officer and sent from Parkersburg
to Huntington by an Ohio River steamer. His move
ments We're well known. and upon his arrival at
Huntington he met by about two hun
dred men. These. formed an escort for him
ON mis- homeward trip. He was put upon
the Chesapeake and Ohio train at Huntington with
the ostensbe purpose of being conveyed to Fayete,
but 1t was we'll understood that judge or jury
would be required in his 1t is probable that
if he had made no admissions he might have
been taken to Mrs. Settle for Identification; but lie
got frightened out of his and confessed the
OF Mrs. Settles children became loud. This was
enough. 1t was determined that he should no. live
another day.


NO MERCY


At Coal Valley. which is coal mining centre, Lee
was escorted from the train and met by thousand
more miners who seemed to know the design of the
escorting party. and who were ready to cooperate
IN avcnging their outraged countrywoman. Lee

party of West Virginia gentlemen properly be
so designated, some distance from the station and

Tor mercy were piteous indeed, and that he be-
sought the lynchcrs to do anything they might
with him. so they left him life. On
the other hand 1t is represented that after commend
ing his soul to the Almighty he bore himself with
the utmost Indifference. The exact truth will prob
ably never be known to the great public. for the
people here while among themselves free
in their talk and justification of the affair
somewhat reticent in the presence of newspaper
men. but the long and short OF the matter is, the
offence was most barbarous one, the punisbm ment
was swift terrible and deserved and while there are
some who lament the necessity for the people taking
the law into their own hands all agree that if
mob violence pardonable at all it in this
instance. Lees father and mother said to reside

minds us Of the old days in San Di-
ego, when Col. Seotts myrmidons
were months and months grading
roadbed from New San Diego to
the race course at Old Town, dis.
tance of three or four miles. The
contrast between the lightning
work Of the Southern Pacific and
the snail.like advances of the Tex.
as-Paclfic is we'll illustrated by the
following, also taken from the
Times:


At the Fort Worth end of the
line, Messrs. O'CoAnor & Shiel,
contractors, have completed the
sycamore creek fill and the cut be-
yend and are now entirely employ.
ed on the heavy fill approaching
the Trinity river. -Four miles from
the commencing point in Fort
Worth they have sub-let two miles
to Messrs. Orr & Lynch, of Dallas,
which is to be pushed forward next
week. This will bring the work to
the hills on the pralries, 6 miles
from the present terminus, at which
point the contractors have consid-
erable cutting TO do. Everything
appears to be progressing favorably
and steadily, and our correspondent
states that large numbers of people
visit the scene of operations daily,
fully Impressed that, within six
months, Fort Worth, instead of
being the terminus Of the Texas
and Pacific Railway, will be the
first prominent station east of the
terminus. This certainly looks
business and carrying out what we
have so often stated would assur.
edly coms to pass-the extension of
the railway from Fort Worth to
Weatherford.


Our Texas contemporary thus
outlines programme OF six
months work for the Texas-Pacidc
working westward which the
Pacific, ut the rate at
which they are now building in
Arizona. would dispatch in three
weeks. Whatever quarrels we
have with our California railway
we cannot forego an ad-
mission of their splendid road.

man whose name, as was subsequently, learn
ed, was VIM. Grubb, farmer, living about
two miles from Columbia, ILL.,, arrived at the
Carondelet police station and stated that on
Monday morning his only daughter, about six
teea years old, had been ravished, while on her
way to school, by a negro named Jerry Col
Inns, who had worked for him about a wear,
Collins was described as being about five feet
eleven inches high and weighing about 200
pounds, with full whiskers and moustache,
After committing the outrage the negro fled
and 1T was supposed that he came to St.
Louis.


MIR, Grubb was very much affected and


SHED TEARS


copiously while relating the circumstances of
the outrage. He said he owned a farm which
was worth more than 100000, that he would
sacrifice every cent of it to 'hunt the niger to
hell, IT necessary, and that if forty officers
had him in charge, he would shoot him on
sight, IT he was strung for it in minute
afterward.


Officer Fil]ey, in charge at the Carondelet
station, suggested the propriety of telegraph
ing to headquarters, SO that officers up town
might be on the qui vive for the wretch, but
Mr. Grubb said: ''No; there was party al
ready gone up to town who would hunt high
and low for the miscreant, and he wouldn't give
them for all the detectives that st. Louis ever
possessed""


Sergernt Flotow states that two officers un-
der him, Messrs. Eckhardt and Abel, met Mr..
Grubb between and 4 o'clock on Tuesday
afternoon, and that he appeared somewhat
joyful, stating that the party which had come
up to st. Louis


HAD FOUND THE NEGRO
on Almond street and carried him off across
the river and started down the Short Line
railroad with him, Mr.. Grubb was in a hurry
to cross the ferry and get home by the Colum-
bla road, and did not have great deal to say
to the officers.


A zinles-Jouanal reporter went down to
Carondelet yesterday to investigate the mat
ter further and found Capt. Tom O'Neill evil
dently considerably puzzled about the affair.
1t was enshrouded in mystery. He hardly
knew what to think of it, but on the whole
was not inclined to put much faith or credence
in the story. On the other hand, Officer Filley,
III charge at the Carondelet station, is positive
that MIR. Grubb was neither intoxicated nor
insane. He talked perfectly rational, but
seemed to be laboring


UNDER STRONG EXCITEMENT,
which would be perfectly natural under the
when he left Carondelet, had the impression
that the negro was caught, and was in tho
hands of men who would attend to him.


A message was sent last evening over the
private wire of the Narrow Gauge railroad to
the station agent at Colum bia, asking if he had
heard or knew anything of the circumstances.
The reply came that neither he nor any one in
the town knew anything about the capture or
disposition of the negro; that if anything of
the kind had occurred some one would most
assuredly have heard of it.


pRORARTE TyNrH1Nn


Many of the farmers living in the vicinity of
Columbia do their trading in Carondelet, and
diligent inquiry was made by the reporter at
the mills and other places most frequented by
the farmers. There is report to the effect
that the negro Collins was caught by one of
the pursuing parties, and that they started for
Columbia with him Tuesday night, and that
the African has not been seen or heard of since.
Those who inquired Of the pursuing parties as
to what had become of Collins were told that
he would never outrage another woman, and
that the less said about the matter would be
the better. The impression is that the brute
was lynched and his body buried to save furth-
er expense and trouble."

Initiating the example of the Pilot Commissioners,

to investigate the charges made against the steam
tug Alanson SUMNER accused OF violating .he State
laws by dumping mud and refuse inside the point
hxed as the prohibitory limit The meeting was
held In the Board room, ut noon. Commissioners
vsnderpoel and Dimock conducted the case. as
sisted by Mr.. Lynch. secretary. and Mr.. Green.
chief engineer of the department. Captain Con-
way. the Pilot Commissioners inspector. said that
he had not yet got his evidence in shape. He in
formed the Commissioners that the HERALD re-
porter had made charges against the tugs. and would
be usod In company with others. as a witness. Cap
tain Conway very indignant that the outraees

said that when the charges were proved the Union
Dredging Company should be made to pay the full
penalty for their unlawful act. Tho point at which

Conway then stated that he had detected the tug

AN EXPLANATION.


This led to an explanation from Commissioner
vanderpoel. who said that the Department OF Docks
desired to the harbor restored, and that the
HERALps expose would probably lead to the dredg-



formerly the This would give them direct con-
troll OF the boats and scows message then
ceived from the Union Company. stating that the
manager not present they could not appear to
answer the charges. On receipt of this news the
investigation was postponed. Complaints
ceived from the Albany Towing Company against
ferry companies being allowed to let loose timber
Goat from their slips. The paddle wheels of the
river steamers had been seriously injured lately
from this cause. The complaints referred to
the Pilot Commissioners. The meeting then ad-
journed.


matter has come to light within q few days past
which assumes the shape of personal controversy
between the Pilot and Dock departments. fow
days ago DR.. Ambrose Snow, Of the Pilot Commits
soners. informed HERALD representative that last
year suit was begun against the Union Dredging
Company. ""The Dock Department after short
tine.'' he said. notified us that they would not
hold the moneys due the Union Dredging Company
amy longer. We were consequently obliged to COM
promise for less than one-fourth OF tho original
sum sued for"" Dock Commissioner Vanderpoel
said to the reporter that the statement was
false. No such communication had ever been
sent, and any statement to the contrary was q
groundless fabrication. AS this very plain
way Of putting the case the reporter interviewed
am surprised said he '.that Mr.. Vanderpoel should
deny having refused to back in case last
he himself makes misstatement when he says that





going to continue payments am almost certain
that the Secretary OF the Board has copy Of the let
ter file, IL not the original document""


FURTHER OFFENCES


Ever since the agitation OF tho harbor question
by the HERALD offences have been committed. The
loose management OF the city authorities is illus
trated by tue following telegram from the agent of
the Maritime Association at City Island Long Island

allowed to exist. The dock at the foot OF West
Eleventh used to be splendid one, but it Is
now shallow that oven canal barge cannot lie
there at low tide There are too many officials aud
too little work done. The Police and Dock Com
missioners have repeatedly been petitoned to have
the abuses abatcd. Now that they are caught no
mercy should be shown thom.


WHERE THE GREAT EAsTERN LANDED.


Whom the Great Eastern came to this city in 1860
considerable trouble was experienced in finding
pier suitable for her. The one at West Eleventh
street WAS finally aelecteu ~ tho finest in the
harbor. 1t deepcned at cost OF $4,000 and the
monster steamship made hor landing safely. To-
day the dock In 50 illcd up with mud that there
not more than seven feet of water. Tho dock in
question Is the largest in New York.


Not only are the docks OF the North River being
destroyed but the whole stream itself is gradually
and systematically being rendered unnavigabie.
The numerous quarr.cs which line the banks OF tho
hudson have tor years been III the habit OF throwing
all their refuse and stone clippings out into the
river. This tor time almost stopped navigation.
Then the river was diked by United States commits
sioner and state law was passed prohibiting the

president OF tho knickerbocker Ice Company, used
lis influence to have The act amended that
dumping could take place except bshnd substantial
bulk heads On Tuesday. the 18th inst, passenger
on the steamer City OF Hudson saw stone chips
being dumped into the river between Four Milo
Point aud Coxsackie. Tho United States survey
made In 1865 Shows that the main depth OF tho
channel was then twenty-tour feet. AT present
boats drawing more than eight feet have hard
work to get up the river. The x danger is that
the stone bars which forming will spoil the inn
provements made by diking few years ago a

who has any special business to prevent these out
rages.

prot CT the peOp e, they took the law in
the T own hands, and IL then sometimes hap
pened that innocent person suffered.


The necessity of the jury going into ali the
matters bearing upon the killing of Smith
by Latin as urged. he tHen detailed the
circumstances prior to The Xxi ling-the quar-
rel n the Planters HouSs stables, on The 9Th |
day of MaTcn, aud the statements Of Latin |
at the time, and what he had sa d after \ ard. |
IL all te ded To show, he sa' q, that LIttin |
held bad feelings toward Smith. lie had told |
parties just after the first quarrel that he had |
kicked ~mith aft-r knocking him down but |
he denit q IT low on the witn'Ss stauu. |
Here was falSehood, which being proven |
upon nifn, made all his after Z. m Ony in |
his own bahaif suspicious


After this quarrel, he said the 7stimOny |
showed tnat I.4filu had talked on several |
OccaSiunS in regard To the matter, showing /
his reyeBgetui feeling. Killing Was his theme. |
while his piSt / daDgled from his side He |
w Latin, after he came out on unday. the /
day before the fatal occurrence, after nine !
day of suffering from he frs, assault. Here T,
Mr.. StilIlng spoke at length upon the iDluS- /
tice OF allowing q defendant In criminal |
actions to testify for for himself. The COM
mission of one crime, he argued, made a per- /
son very liable II commit another, and the |
re ul's wrought by this law are always bad. |


He then proceeded to take Mr.. Latin and |
Mr.. Peek step nv step from Golfers stable 10 /
the Planters II HDuSe, on the morn ng OF the /
fatal shooting. The relative positions of the |
two parties, Latin and Smith, were then |
fixed. Col Van Notrst swore that when he /
Latin had p!stOI leveled upon smith. The |
defense claimed that these words Were |
used before Latin drew his pi.tD and that |
smith afterwards struck Latin over the /
head and threw the hatchet-all before |
Latin drew his pistol. The testimony OF the /
bell-boy corrob ia ell rs 10 tie time of
throwing tne Ratchet, he being up stairs |
when the first Sror was fired, and coming !
down, saw Smith with th- hHtchet raised |

Mr. Latin was not hurt with the hatcht I. |
but tuat he and Mr.. Peck made the wounds
and the rents IN the clothing afterwards l
TIE who'e defense was merely gotten up on |
the f!Insiest Pretensc


THE DEFENSE.


Mr.. Fenlon, for the defense, said that he |
wished to harrow up no tender feelings of The /
friends II the deceased; but the prosecution
had been unfair and made unfair STATE
mentS, which III de the case IA sh=r per>e
cutiou Ihan a pros, cution. He appealed to |
the jury If the prosecution had stated the
facts rs proven. The State had held the
threat of the eXerc Sc OF lynch law before the
jury. unless the defendant was convicted 1t
was the studied effort Of tie State 10 warp
ana prejudice the minds Of the jUry-nOt to
have The case treat-d impartisiiy as justice
demanded. Smith was au average man-no
bet eT nor any worse than tie common run.
That his family was wealthy amt honorable
entered not into this case: but il must be |
tried without any such considerations. Two
facts were 10 be cOnsidered-Ihe shooting Cf
smith by Latin. which was cOncei""d; next,
was Latin guilty of murder in so doing.


The argumen, of the prosecution had been
mainly based upon unfair deductions which
could not be drawn from the testimony. A |
great deal had been said abOut what hap.
pened before the shooting. The crucial
point was what occurred at the time of the
ran aod Iore his coat Afterwards was too alb.
surd TO think about. Others Swore TO those |
cuts being inflicted There was nothing to
show that the hstchets were not thrown.


As regarded l. lttiu language, men often |
said things they did not mean. As for
Smiths dying declaration, he was under the
il fiurnce or mO-phia and his mind could
not have been clear L4ti!d did not have
Ia flee when he was Gssaulr cd, and there was
nothing 10 show Jhat ii Smith bad not COM
mencgd upO1 him that the killing would
have occurred.


The defense asked no sympathy, but de
mande d ony the law in the case, and the
when each Individual member were sum |
moned before that high tribu Isl, from which
there was no appeal. he could go with d clear
conscience ana IA clean heart.


CLOSING ARGUMENT.

closed fO the defense. He sad that Lille
had been take~ and the defense ingenIously
twisted the efforts TO show tire motive into

cute when The blood OF poor Dan smith call
ed loudly for vengeance. He only wanted,
IN closing. 10 keep TO tue time of the actual
occurrence, as the prior facts had been ably

into the Office that day. he could not haye

when the angels We're wsiting TO bear the

they could not wipe out the great drops and

his sister supported that dying declaration;
nay NOR, the surroundings showed II. That
silent witness, the bullet in the counter, |
showed that the f1rst shot had been fired as

Now since the bitterest political oppo-

even before his election affirmed its salts
faction with his conduct as member OF

asked? May we not all conclude that the
CITY Council has done well in elecIing
the Colonel to his Office. There can be
no reflection on others IN asking that all

can we conceive of there being any more

8. Kalloch defended himself before an inn
menae audience against the charges of thirty
years of immortality preferred against him by
the Ch,onicle. He said, those charges were re-
vlved by Charles and Mike De Young, two has.
tard sons of a prostitute. This morning Chas
De Young drove in covered coupe in front of
the private entrance of the Metropolitan Tenn
pie, whore Kalloch had a study room, and sent
messenger boy asking him to come out Kali
loch Immediately appeared on the sidewalk.
when De Young shot him in the breast Kal.
loch turned to retreat in doors when De Yonnu
shot him in the back. crowd Immediately
seized the carriage in which was De Young.
turned it over and tore him out. He was
dreadful kicked and bruised and would no
doubt have been killed On the spot had not an
unusual number of policemen came suddenlv
city is intensely excited. The police
did not think De Young safe in iail
and made arrangements to hurry him
to Fort Albatross, when the intention became
known to the people. At present the spirit of
the multitude is aroused to prevent any remov.
time when San Francisco was more angry.


THE NATURE OF THE INJURIES.


Kalloch is shot through the left lung. inst
above the heart. The physicians say with hi.
strong constitution there is bare possibility
of his recovery. The military are under arms
and the police are on duty in the event of
disturbance.


SAN Francisco, Aug. 23.-The circumstances
leading to the shooting Of Kalloch by Charles
De Young are as follows: After Kslloch was
nominated by the workingmen of the city ""a
their candidate for mi Ghar1oo Ia
IN speech at the State convention of Honor
able Bilks, announced that he would compel
kalloch to Withdraw from the contest. Subse-
quently he notified Kalloch through the col
umns of the Chronicle. Kalloch sent back
word Tor him to go ahead; that he could tell
worse things about the De Youngs than they
could bring against him. Wednesday last the
Chronicle came out with a long article review
halloch's career in Boston and Kansas, dwell
ing particularly on his reported amours, and
also ventilating his political and business
record. Thursday and Friday the Chronicle
contained similar and more elaborate articles.
and dragged in Kalloch's father, now dead,
recounting sundry immoralities on his part.
halloch had advertised mass meeting at
metropolitan temple last night, at which it wss
given out he would read copy of the article
publ published SOM some five years ago by B. F: Nap
ticle was an attackApon the personal and fam
ny record OF the De Youngs, of most pro.
nounced character, and led to an attempt on
their part to kill Napthaly, which failed.
De Young sent Kalloch word that if he read
that article they would shoot him on sight,

scoring the De Youngs mercilessly, and reflect.
ing on their personal record and family ante
ced' nts in most direct manner. After
adJourning the meeting in the hall, he went
outside. mounted the stand, and spoke briefly.
After reviewing the attacks of the Chronicle
upon himself, he said: I'm maligning the
reputation of my father. who has filled an hon
orable grave for many years, these journalistic
vlpers have rendered q most vicious retaliation
on my part necessary and justifable. These
dlsgraceful records make such attack possible,
bastard progeny of prostitute. He said he
had the Sun article in his pocket (cries of
read it, read it,"" but did not wish to expend
All his ammunition at once. It would be pub
lshed Immediately in full in the workiugmens
paper. the Open Letter, and next Tuesday even
Ing he would take it up and comment on it.


Chas. De Young evidently considered the pro.
ceedings of the meeting equal provocation to
the actual reading of the article, and acted ac-
cordingly.


PRESS OPINIONS.


The evening journals counsel above all
things moderation on the part of the working
men for the credit of the city and also for their
own sake, on account of the bearings of their
action on the result of the present campaign.
The Bulletin says in effect that the shooting
was deliberate assassination and reminds the
reader that twenty-three years ago the people
OF the city hanged man who killed an editor
who dared to express his convictions, but that
now the law of society seems to be that an
editor may say what he pleases, but If the as
saulted party talks his life is to be forfeited.
but warns the workingmen that the course
they pursue will be the best evidence of their
ability to administer the affairs of the city. and
that resort to violence would be fatal mis-
take.


THE PATIENT.


At $3.50 o'clock P. M. Kalloch is in a much i'm.
proved condition. slight examination has
been made and physicians expressed the opin-
ion that there is good ground for expecting his
recovery. The tragedy has almost paralyzed
business during the day. Telegrams are pour
Ing IN from all over the State inquiring as to
t he condition of affairs, and almost equal in
terest is reported from Nevada. Workingmen
are hanging about the sand lots waiting Kear.
ney's arrival, which is anticipated With The
greatest interest, as almost everything will de.
pend upon the course he concludes to adopt.


PUBLIC FEELING.


40 As4 80 SoA ~ RtS Uo 1S6CucU GQo fo6l.
ing of the community is almost entirely with
Kalloch. De Young's action is universally
branded as cold blooded assassination, and the
belief is general that if the workingmen in the
event of Kalloch's death demand the surrender
of De Young for lynch justice, that outside of
the lawfully constituted authorities not hand
would be raised to prevent the contamination
of their desires. 1t is evident from the ex-
pressions heard on every side that whatever the
n IrChS do $b@ Co.
prove the death blow to the cause of the Hon.
orable Bilks in this city If Kalloch RECEIVERS he
ls likely to receive vote much greater than
would have been given had nothing of the kind
occurred. If he dies, the detection from the
H. B. 8 is likely to be still greater, but in that
case the Republicans will probably profit to
some extent. It is difficult to say What the
effect will be in the interior, but it can hardly
fail to be disastrous to the 81. BIS. The
Chronicle has been the head and front of that
organization.


Kearney arrived ON the Vallejo boat this
evening. At the wharf he was met by a crowd of
several thousands, who received the leader !.
with an almost frantic exhibition of 10Y. Three
of the working mems military companies,
numbering 16O men, with rifles and fixed bay-
onets, were on hand rs an escort. With Kear-
ney at the head the procession moved up
Market street for the sand lots, filling the
street for several blocks, and making the air
ring with cheers for Kearncy and cries Of

WILMINGTON, DEL, July 10, 1879.
To the President and members of City


Council:


GENTLEMEN We, the undersigned,
members of the City Council, desiring
to place ourselves upon record In refer
ence to the late action of Council in the
matter of the election of the Street Com
missioner, on the evening of July 7th,
1879,. in VIII ch eleven members did in
open and gross violation of Rule Four
teen, (Which says: ""Every member who

excused by a vote of two-thirds of the

P. Lynch, q candidate for the Office and
member Of Council from the Tenth Ward
to cast ballot, and we are forced to the
conclusion, by all the circumstances sur
rounding the same, that his vote secured
his election; and IN order that there shall
be no misunderstanding about the mat

escape the responsibility Of their acts,
setting the law and time-honored usage
at defiance, we hereby certify that we

For E. II. Hoagland- Adams, Down

at present In this matter we earnestly

Mr.. Taylor said he had no objection
to the gentlemen protes ing against the
election OF MIR. Lynch IS Street Commis-
sloner, but he most earnestly objected to
the use Of certain disrespeciful language
which 1t contained. He did not think
the protest should be received by Coun-
Gil III its present form. The report says
in one place 'fix tue matter and place
the odium and disgrace where 1t belongs""
The proceeding were not disgraceful.
The gentlemen on the Democratic side
thought they were doing right, and have
right to their opinions Is we'll as the
Republican members. There had been
but one protest made in Council since he
had been member and that was when
the Democrats were in q minority, hav-
ing but seven members, and it was with
regard to an unwarranted action in tsking
an ordinance from the hands of the Law
Committee; but the language in that
document was respectful. If there Is an
odium in the action, those who elected
Mr.. Lynch are willing TO bear 1t but he
would oppose the protest unless the lan-
guage characterizing that action as dis
graceful, was changed. -.4 4si e4i


Mr.. Price consented to the alterations
desired by Mr.. Taylor, but insisted that
Rule XIV had been used very badly. 1t
was law for the government of Council
and should be lived up to. The gentle
man could see no difference between the
rules to govern council and the people
members of this body should obey the
former as carefully as the people should
follow the provisions of the city's laws.
Mr.. Norton said that desperate cases
required desperate remedies and in the
case of the case Of the election of Mr..
Lynch there was no other resort, t,-they
were compelled to act as they did, and
that action was right and legal. He was
surprised to see certain gentlemen sign
the report who had said they were sin
cerely sorry they were kept from voting
for Mr.. Lynch by party restrictions.
Mr.. Guthrie SAID he had tried hard to
say nothing upon the matter, fer he be-
n, Uad mn N h al hoon aaid a
He was surprlse.l that gentlemen who
had been in Council for twelve ysars and
who had seen other cases in Council ex.
actly similar to the one protested against
should flare up suddenly against Louis
p. Lynch, one of the best men who ever
sat ia Council ,and who has been credit
to the city and to his constituents, when
they might have prevented the whole
diffi Guilty by an ordinance. us
Mr.. Tay lor thought that the protsstants
were, in strong probability, wrong in
| characterizing the election of Mr.. Lynch
| as illegal. Mr.. Lynch had acted on the
opinion of the Uity Solicitor, and he had
said that Mr.. Lynch had perfect right
to vote for himself. He (Mr. TayIor) had
talked with two appointment legal gentle
men In the city himself, and they both
said that Rals XIV did not apply to the
case in point. 1t was not disappro baton
of he alleged Illegality of the thing that
caused the protest to be made. The pro
testants were looking further ahead. If
they came into power at the next city
election they would ""onst"" Mr.. Lynch
from Office and use the protest, declaring
his election illegal, as lever to do Il
with.
Mr.. Walton said be would ebiect to
the report until the declaration that Mr..
Lynch's election was SO amerded as to
.oA Z IN ~ n nf fhA pAta
tants it is Illegal"" The declaration that
the election was disgraceful is small
compared with this. t.,a .-.,
Mr.. McGinchey thought the protest
was too great and too strong, and made
motion to lay over for one week. Lost
by rising vote of ten to ten.


The chair said that the protest would
not entail its adoption BY the entire
Council. o' 'g


Mr.. Adams declared that In .signi ng the
report he had no Idea of removing Mr..
Lynch from Office in case the Republi-
cans came in power. .g u .s,.i


Mr.. McGlinchey said that 1t was
strange that the Republicans should set q
precedent and then object to similar
proceedings. The particular case be had
in his minds eye was that of Mr.. Walter
who voted for himself when elected
Chief Engineer of the Water Depart





now who voted for Mr.. Walter. ~
Mr.. Chandler said that the Republi-
cans were not responsible for MIR. Wal
ser's election, and that Rule xiv was
not adopted jill after that IA


The words ""cast the Disgrace was
stricken out and the protest SO amended
as TO read that Mr.. KynGh's election was
""illegal in the opinion of the protest.

and ordered to be spread upon the min

ening Fifth street at Walnut awarded to
John McCafferty ct $780,. The report

ter, the Actor, BY q Teaccs R,sfian.


Mr. Maurice Barrymore, the actor who
was wounded at Marshall, Texas, by the
rufiian Currie, on the night when Ben G. Por-
ter was killed, reached Philadelphia on
Wednesday last. Mr.. Barrymore gives an
account Of the shooting which differs in many
respects from these which have been pub
lished, and which, if possible, shows Currie
in worse light. Mr.. Barrymore prefaces
his story by telling how Miss Cum ming, Mr.
Porter, and himself came to be in the restau-
rant where the tragedy occurred. After the
play in Marshall was over, while the company
was waiting in the hotel for the train
which would not be due until 2 o'clock, Mr.. :
Barrymore and Miss Cunmins, desiring to


have some coffee, called upon Porter to make


some in a private cooking apparatus he al
| ways carried with him. No; he didn't feel
like going to the trouble, and asked if there


wasn't some place where they could get it al-
| ready made. Yes, the landlord said, they


could get it at the restaurant at the railroad


station, only q hundred yards or so distant.
So the three walked down to the station and


seated themselves on high stools at the eat


ing bar, and called for coffee. Mr..


Barrymore drank his cupfull, and then


went back to the hotel to look


after the baggage, Mr.. Porter and Miss


Cummins, concluding to have little lunch,
remaining in the restaurant. While Mr..


Barrymore was gone, Currie came in and


seated himself near Miss Cummins, and be-


gan to make himself very offensive. When
ever Porter ordered e dish, Currie would
echo the order in a loud and insulting man
nor. Ne attention WAS paid to him; and


after amusing himself in this way for a
while, he went into the bar in an adjoining


room. Mr. Barrymore returning after an


absence of about five minutes, Miss Cum-
minis was telling him how the ruffian had
behaved. Currie again entered the room,
and, approaching Porter, began pouring
out voiley of oaths and obscenity. Porter
told him that he wanted to have moth ing to
do with him and reminded him that there
was q lady present.


""a hell of lady she isr' replied the
|, ruffian.


""she is lady and under our protection""
said both gents at once, when Mr.. Barry
more spoke, saying to Porter they did not


want to have anything to do with Currie.


The bully turned to him and said, s.Per-
4 haps you'd like to take it up?"" 'I'm not
PARTICULAR replied Barrymore, 'but I'm un-
. armed. $50 am l."" said Currie. 'Haven't
you pistol?"" ""No.'' ""Will you swear that
you have not?'' eyes, ""Then take of
your coat,'' said the actor,'' who learned the
, manly art of lf-defense in his college days
!. = in England.


!, = No sooner had Barrymore thrown off his
q coat than Currie drew two revolvers, one ii
u each hand, and lev9led them at his unarmeG
9 antagonist. Even then Barrymore did no.
> believe he would fire, but thought he mean,
, to frighten him by fourishirg his weapons
The actor put up his hands in the boxing


attitude, when the ruffian fired, the ball


striking Barrymore in the muscle of the lefi
% arm, above the elbow, and lodging near tn
e ekin,. under the shoulder blade. His frs
thought was to seize spittooD, but ther
was not one in the room, and even the stool
. that they had been sitting on were fastened
Q down. He rushed into the bar-room il
search of loose chair, or anything that h'
could hurl at the assassin, without success
o and, as he re-entered the room Currie fire,
% at him again, but missed.


p This all took place in much less time thar
9 it takes to tell it. Porter and Miss Cum
u minis then moved toward the door leedin,
- y out onto the platform. AS they reached tn
u door Porter and Barrymore faced about, ant


that instant Currie, who was still standin,


in the middle of the room, fred the sho

James Carroll, colored, was lynched at
Point of Rocks this evening for the brutal
outrage of Mrs. Richards, wife of we'll
known farmer in Frederick county, at her
home on Monday night. The negro climbed
into her bedroom and threatened her with
death if she resisted and foully outraged her
person. Mr.. Richards discovered Carroll in
Georgetown, D. c., this afternoon, and he
was put on the train, with couple of Of
fcers, to be taken to Frederick for trial. In
the presence of Officer Harper, Carroll said
that the woman could not swear that he
raped her, and no


DID NOT CARE On
if they did kill him. He could only die
once, anyhow, and that be knew whilst he
was doing it he would be killed if he was
| caught. He expressed his willingness to go
with the officers to Frederick, and was ac-
cordingly accompanied to the train by the
above named officers; also by Mr.. Thomas
AS the Frederick train left Washington q
large crowd had gathered at the depot, and
| much indignation was expressed by those
present. The mayor of Frederick was tele-
graphed to meet the party at


POINT OF ROCKS.


AS the train stopped ct Tuscarora station
about thirty men boarded the train and the
order was given to tie quiet and to go to the
smoking car. Everything was conducted in
the most quiet manner and nothing what
ever said to the prisoner or the officers in
charge. The train switches off at the Point
of Rocks station for Frederick, and as it
Stacked it's speed the cars were stopped and
about a hundred men gathered around
them, and the infuriated men boarded the
train, crying: ""Where is he?"" ""Where is
he?"" The officers appealed to them to stay
away, but there was no stay in those desper-
ate men. They were bent upon their


MISSION OF VENGEANCE.


The negro was dragged out, though he
struggled with death-like fury against the
crowd. Mr.. Thomas, who was in the car
and Mr.. Joseph Payne, of this city, who
was passenger in the car, urged all to dc
no harm to the officers. They were, how.
ever, dragged to the rear part of the car and
kept there until the crowd bore the negro
away. After the crowd left, the officer.
went after them, when they were taken uk
bodily and carried back to. the train, whert
they were guarded until its departure fo1
Frederick. In the meantime the negro wa1
nearing the place which had been selected
for


THE TERRIBLE SCENE


of his death. At least three hundred me1
on horseback and on foot had gathered to
gether. A rope had been placed around th
neck of the wretched man as he was born
from the cars in the arms of dozen men
, He was held up until the rope was tied to
tight limb. He was given few moment
{ to ask mercy Of his God, when he wa
, launched into eternity for bis terrible crime
A guard was appointed to see that
: was not molested or carried away during tn
: night, whilst others of the party repaired t
Point of Rocks, q village on the Baltimor
& Ohio railroad, about twelve or fifteen mile
from the place of execution.


The negro died in about eight minutes
and the only words he uttered from the tim
he left the car to the hanging were: ssPleas
kill me quick"" It is said by those preseu
that if the prisoner had been taken to th
Z county Jail they had determined to Wis
Frederick with at least 500 armed men an
= take him from the sheriff, police and th
5 people of the town, if necessary.


MRS. THOMAS


is said to be in very critical condition, an

Abatement OF Anxiety COncrrni""g *


tue Pes,sson of 6en. Roberts.


LONDON, Dec. 20.--A dispatch
from Bombay says: 1t was report
ed Yesterday that Gen. Cough
would probably retire upon Pelze-
rau, three miles wsst of Surkub
river, but it is now believed he
will remain at Jagdaluk, and
SHORTLY clear away the Ghilzois in
his front.
General Arbuthnots brigade is
distributed along the road between
Gundamuk and Jagdalluk. Con-
trary to expectation, the tribes be-
low Jellaiabad continue quiet.
Had General Bright advanced with
his whole force, doubtless the
Mobmunds and Afreedis would
have risen, but the system
of forwarding troops from Jel-
lalabad only as reinforce
ments arrived from Peshawur
affords them no opening. Great
efforts are making for speedy con-
eentration at Peshawur. Many ma
tive princes have rendered their as
sistance. Gen. Roberts's state
ments of his ability to hold his po.
sition and take the offensive on a
favorable opportunity have been SO
positiye that the anxiety at first
felt on behalf OF the garrison In the
Shjrpur Cantonments is much
abated.


An official dispatch from General
Bright, dated Dec. Is, informed the
Viceroy Of India that IL Genera
Gouyh was unable to force his way

The Baltimore NeicS reports great eX-

Woodcock ON Wednesday, on suspicion


of ofincendiarism.


WoOdcock is a matchmaker and jew

Md, and has heretofore been highly 90
teemcd. He occupied a store IN Easton,


which he rented from Mrs. Elizabeth X
Robinson, who lives in the other por-

On Tuesday night the family Of Mrs.
Robinson heard saving and driving of
nails IN he store, and it was Subsequent
"" discovered that hole 1S inches square
had been cut in the floor under the coun-
ter. and large quantity of combnstiblc
stuffl,aluraTei with oil had been thrown
into the collar and set fire to. The win
dows had been obscured with sheets
and bed quilts and several cans contain
ing coal OIL were found near the hole in
the floor.


After the combustibles had ignlted
Woodcock left the store, and then the
fire was discoyered by the night watch


man. The heat was so great that the
handles of the oil cans had melted off,
hut their contents had not ignited. Moth
ing but the prompt action of the hire de-


partment averted a terrible contagra-
tion, as the store is located In the busi


ness centre of the town and high wind
was blowing.


The motive is supposed to have been
| to secure the insurance, as 1t is asserted
that the greater portion of the stock had
| been removed. The excitement of the
| inhabitants was so great that threats of
| lynching were freely INDUCED in."

read and referred, as follows:
From Da,iel Daley and others asking
for lamp on Claymont street, at Lob
dell and A streets, South Wilmington.


From &. b. Guyer, asking to have a
clear space of eight feet kept in front of
his place of business, No. Alb King street,
on market days.


for lamps on Linden street, at the cor
ners of Franklin and Harrison streets,
Tenth Ward.


Mr.. Norton called up for third read
ing, the ordinance providing for the ap-
pointment of an additional policeman
for the Fourth District.


the ordinance being on its final pass
age Mr.. Lynch, stated tha' at first oppos-
ed to this measure, but had since chang.
ed his mind. He had conversed with
those who had petitoned for the ordin-
anee, and found they were in earnest in
their request, and seemed to think that
the eXigences of the times demanded
another policeman for the Fourth Dis
trict.


The roll was called, and when Presi-
dent Lich'enstein's name was announced
he stated that he had observed that all
the petitions for an increase of the police
force were in the same writing. Coun-
Gil had voted down general increase OF
the force, and now it is proposed to give
an increase to one district. Already
there was petition out for another dis
trict and would probably keep on until
all the districts were increased. lie
therefore vo,ed nay.


The ordinance Was passed by the fol-
loving vote:


Ayes-Messrs. Adams, Downing,
Evans, Guthrie, Hat, Huested, Knight,
Lynch, Walton, McGlinchey, Norton,
Rowe, Taylor, Townsend and Wood
Is.


Nays-Messrs. Jones, Payn.er, Price
and President Lichtenstein-4.


Absent-Mr. Chandler.


Mr.. Lynch offered the following reso-
lut ons:

OBITUARY.

WILLIAM ALLEN, OF OHIO,",,"U ODl "" AN L.


WILLIAM ALLEN, OF OHIO.


Dispatches from Chillicothe, O., an
nounce that after q brief illness at his
at his home in Fruit Hill, Ex-Governor
William Allen, Of Ohio, passed quietly
away yesterday morning. Only few
weeks ago correspondent Of the Tines
heard from the father of the ""Ohio Idea""
the story Of his life, and while he told 1t
he sat quietly upon the doorstep Of his
stone mansion and appeared strong in .
vigorous old age. He has filed many
high public stations, and 1t has twice dur
ing his long life seemed even probable
that he might be called to the highest
position attainable by an American citi-
zen. A wise and f0rcasting statesman
his warmest admirers will scarcely call
him, but no one ever doubted his entire
sincerity Of purpose or his devotion TO
the country Is he understood 1t. The
general feeling In regard to him among
all parties in the West resembled the
feeling in the East towards Horace Gree
ley, at whom though people often laugh
ed they laughed In kindly and good
natured-way.


William Allen was born in Edenton,
N. c., In 1906. While he was child his
father and mother moved to Lynchburg,
Va, where at the public school he stu
died until he was sixteen yeas old. 1t
is told of him that when he was only
nine years old he talked with Jefferson
and Jackson in public house in Lynch
burg. He was fond of recurring to this
Ii nd nc hnr 10 In thu trpn
cratic faith. His half-sister had married
a young man named Thurman, and they
had moved to Chillicothe, in Ohio, where
they were prosperous in their affairs with
family growing about them. When
young Allen was sixteen he, too, deter
mined to cross the mountains and make
for himself home and name in the
young but rapidly growing State of
Ohio. Meeting Kentucky drover who
had taken his stock to Virginia to find q
market, Allen asked and received per-
mission te accompany him on his home
ward Journey. In the middle of winter
when the obscure tracks over the Blue
Ridge were covered with snow the two
started on foot on their long tramp. On
through snOw-drifts and over fallen
trees, with blistering feet and almost
frozen bodies, the companions pursued
their weary walk until little town
twenty-one miles from GallipOlis was
reached and their paths diverged. -Four
hundred miles more had Allen to make
alone before he reached his sisters
house, end these were four hundred
miles of fatigue and privation. Starting
early in the morning for Gallipolis, he
did not reach it for twenty four hours
during all Of which time he had beer
walking through an unsettled country
whose few roads bewildered rather thar
| guided a stranger. With the sunrise
| however, his tired eyes were gladdenet
| by the sight of the broad Ohio, beyo,t
which nestled the little town of Gallipo
lis.


The lad was enabled through th'
open and unquestioning hospitality o
| the people who dwelt by the roadside to
make acquaintances which stood him II
| good stead when a few years later b,
appeared upon the hustings to'plead the
cause of jackson and the Democrat
against the Wings and the United State
Bank. Indeed, one of these aoquaint
ances made by chance trusted him be
cause he was stranger and lent him


horse on which he finished the journey
Arriving in Chillicothe he was welcom
| ed by his brother and sister and thei
son, now tolerably well known il
the United States Senate as Allen G
Thurman.


With the understanding that as muc
must be learned as possible in the shor:
est space of time possible, young ALLIE
was entered in the Chillicothe Academ
where he remained two years, and fro 4
which he went to the Office of Judg
Scott, then q prominent lawyer, to rea
Chitty and Blackstone. With Judg
Scott he did not long remain, because
in his own words, he twas pestered t
death by a lot of girls who morning
noon and night kept up an everlasting
chatter and banged away on an old pl
ano,"" and this in the next room. Leav
ing this scene of ""chatter and bang"" b


went to the office of Colonel Edwar


King, a son of Rufus King, of this city
and the father of Rufus King, of Cincin


natl, and before he was twenty-on


braved an examination for admission
the bar at Portsmouth where the Su


preme Court was sitting. With the say
ing wisdom of an older generation tha
the present he nerved himself with


pint of peach brandy made palatable b


mixture Of honey, and in five minute


after his examination began was prt


nounced fit to be member of the Obi


bar by one of the bluff old judges who's


simple but expressive verdict he thus n


cords: ""Oh, HI that feller can TAX


care of himself; let's go an liquor.
He was q hard worker, and soon mad


himself of value to Colonel King, VIII
took him into partnership. Young A
len for a time did the work and XIII


found the wit. At twenty-five he WI


employed for the defense, and conducte


it successfully, in murder case


which the leading lawyers of Il


State were employed by the posec'


tion.


At this time-1S32-th Congression


district in which he lived was regardt


by the Democrats as hopelessly Viii
An election was approaching and Il


Democrats, to preserve their organic


ton, sought some one to be their cand

The Last Game with tho Bostons.",,"Not much can be said by way of commenda-
tion of the playing of the homo team in their
gamo with tho Bostons yesterday. With few
exceptions IL was miserable, and the Nationals
did very little batting until the eighth
inning, when they earned two runs, and,
aided by darkues obtained two more. Tho
National nine, or rather the infeld, was
shifted again, Ellick and Mcclellan returning
to their old positions, while Latham looked
after second and Mack the first base. Latham
not only felded we'll and played the position
without an error, but rendered assistance to
Mack on two occasions when ho left his base
to get a ball. The former stepping into the
uncovered position, with Mack's aid cut of
the batter. This style of playing brought
back strong recolections Of Gerhardt and his
activity in getting on tho first base when the
regular player of that position was compelled
to leave it exposed.


Baker covered himself with glory in tho
centro.fcld, capturing iive flies, aud permit
ting nothing to escape his clutches. Derby,
In the right, had very little to do in compari
son with the day previous h.. :.:cccSS;;;.vs,i ln

hinu Helpeu inc VlsltOrS TO nVe runs. AltnOugn
the Bostons made twelve runs, still they
earned but two, aud had Lynch received the
deserved support they would not have gotten
any more.


Trott caught finely, and showed himself to
bo equally as good as Snyder behind the bat.
Ellick gathered three flies to his breast and
held them there, but his throwing was not as
straight and accurate as usual.


The Boston nine gave fno exhibition of
folding and hntfa1 bpItnr thnr in tla ,nr
game. Foley was substituted for Bond in the
pitchers position, and proved effective until
tho eighth innings, when the Nationals sud

but then it was too late, for the game was gone

A mum Der Of other per sons were there, watching the play at the gam ng tables, and none suspected any thing like a quarrel, when suddenly Chas.

Why he did no. lit him is one oi the mysteries; but Simpson was not touched. Simpson was unarmed, but with rare presence of mind, before Powell had time to Ire again, be bolted into the saloon and thence Into and up Mesilla street. Powell saw nis intended victim escaping in this manner and shot again as simpson passed the saloon door. This time his aim was no better than the first, but as 1t hap pened UT fortunately for both, a Mexican named Jesus Chaves stepped into tue door way at the instant when the report came. The bullet struck him ir the right side and passed through his heart and he fell dead without a groan. Powell in- stsntly followed Simpson, md while the latter was standing at GO,dtree's cigar store, telling that he had been shot at, the murderer appeared opposite Browns cor. ner and commenced another lusilads, but without hittIng anybody.

 We never knew lynch law to he. come necessary in any country with out the people themselves were to blame by neglecting or negligently performing their duties as citizens. If the majority of people are really faithful and honest citizens, they can compel the making and enforcing of good laws by attending properly to their duties as jurors and electors.

BLEEDING A BANK. EtH 3aI
ST. LOUIS, May>26.-Mr. Dierberger, assignee
of the Broadway savings bank, has discovered
in the private drawers of j. p Krieger, Jr.,
cashier of that institution, papers in the form
of checks, drafts, etc. (which conclusively show
| that Krieger and Meyer A. Goldsall have been
privately connected in the use of funds of the
bank, and that Goldsall is indebted to the bank
about 100000, the recovery of which is very
doubtful. Similar papers were found in
Krieger's safe at his fathers residence, where
he lived. To what particular use Krieger and
Goldsall put the money obtained from the
bank. or whether Krieger derived any benefit
from it does not appear, but that Krieger was
in collusion with Goldsall and furnished him
with money without proper security there can
be no question. These transactions have ex-
tended over period of nearly three years and
most of them have been studiously kept from
the knowledge of the directors.



J.P. Krieger, Jr., for whom warrant was
issued Saturday, gave himself up this morning
| and was put in Jail pending the procurement
of bonds. He spent Saturday night with his
mistress in town and Sunday went to the coun-
try and spent the day and last night with
friends of one of his bondsmen, who persuaded
him to surrender to the authorities. The meet
ing of depositors this morning resulted in
nothing definite except the appointment of a
committee to look after their interests, en-
ploy lawyers, etc. ..-r!g.s.s5ss.


ST.. LOUIS, May 26.-No effort has been made
to procure bail for J. P. Krieger, Jr., and it is
probable none will be for a day or two. In
fact it is thought he is much better off in
Jail than out, as the feeling against him by de-
positors Is very strong, and could he be got at,
personal violence would no doubt result. Ef-
forts have been made to find Golds all to-day,
and they Jailed. He is a jewelry dealer
and it is believed he speculated
extensively in cotton and stocks with
the money procured from Krieger Several
attempts were made to interview Krieger to-
day, but he declined point blank to see re-
porter and give any information touching
! either himself or the affairs Of the bank. He
| is very nervous and greatly prostrated both
mentally and physically. The warrant for his
arrest charges him with embezzling $249, 600
between May 1st, 1876, and May lst, 1879.


LARGE COTTON FIRE.


New YORK; May 26.-Fire broke out this
evening in the storage warehouse, corner of
Bridge and State streets, leased by John s.
Richards, and owned by J. Stewart. The
building was almost entirely filled with cotton,
and it is thought the fire may have heen
smouldering considerable time before it was
observed. The iron shutters on Pearl street
| side became red hot. The fire ragged 80 iercly
after discovered that four alarms were sent
out. In consequence of tho bales of cotton
being packed closely up to the windows very
little effective work could be done from the
streets. The whole interior of the building
seemed like furnace. Four workmen were
on the top floor when the fire broke out, but
succeeded in making their escape by sliding
down rope to the sidewalk. The building is
said to be worth $50, 900, and fully insured.
The amount Of stock which it contained was
valued at 100000. W.. Black Co. had 1000
bales of cotton and Graffrey & Co. 1000 bales,
Putnam, 1000 bales; Weir, Murphy & Co.,
1000 bales; B. A. Smith, 140 bales, and Fishery


Bros, 100 bales. It is thought tho contents OF


the three top floors were entirely destroyed
The first floor contained 800 bales of cotton and


about the same number of bales of hops. 1t ii
said series of fires occurred in the same BLOCK
of an incendiary character in 1864 and 1867
when several fremen lost their lives. Th,


origin of to-night's fire is not known and th.
insurance could not be learned.

Special Correspondence OF the Gazette.
MIDDLETowN, DEL, April II. For a


cohsti uency that truly Ionor their re-


plesentative in the local legis allure, and


sincerely appreciate his efforts for the


public good inthc capacity of legislator,


the citizens of st. Georges Hundred GER


tainly take the lead.


lu the fall of 1876, Hon. Edwin r.
Cochran, living near this town, was
| elected to represent ST. Georges Hun
dred in particular, and New Castle
| county in general, in the Legislature of


the State, AS legislator Mr.. Cochran


was success. He was apt in properly


interpreting public measures and by an


earnest advocacy of every proposition,


for the advancement of the public well


fare he earned the grateful admiration of
! the people OF the entire commonwealth


and the warmest esteem of the residents


OF his immediate neighborhood.


As natutal consequence, Mr.. Coch-


ran was renominated without opposition


for term in the ensuing legislaI ure, and
|
, the same brilliant record and sincere re-


gard for the public welfare that marked


his career in the legislature of two years


previous. His constituents were of


course delighted, and in order to appro-


praSely testify their admiration and es-


teenl, they arranged complimentary


banquet in honor of Mr.. Cochran, which


took place in this town at the National


Hotel last nj hit.


The gathering, though informal in


character, was most pleasant and agree


able, and included representatives from


all parts of tue county. From Whining


ton came Representative Jas. w. Ware,


ex-Secretary of State l. Z. Grubb, Ed. n.
| Vallandigham, of Ecery Eueai,ag and
I your correspondent. George Gray, ESQ.,,
| Prothonotary Charles Beasten, Recorder
| Thomas Holcomb, and Geo. Millington
represented New Castle. Columbus
Watkins came over fiom Odessa, ex-
| Congressman James Williams brought
| up the fraterDal greetings of Kent county


while j. Is. Foard, chairman OF the com
| mittee of arrangements, Nathaniel Will
| iams, Alex. Comegys, VIM. Green, VIM.
| b. Cochran, Purnal j. Lynch, w. Scott
Way, OF the Transcript, and two score
| more of the leading citizens, represented
Middletown and st. Georges Hundred.


Gov. Cochran fully expected to be pres


ent, but as he was suffering from slight
indispositIon he was kept at home by the


rain that prevailed during the night.
PEACH TALK.


Previous to the banquet the company


assembled in the parlor of the National,


and discussed current topics. Of course,
l ampuU co tpapu farvparc naaob toI x.yo @
prominent in the minds of most of those


present. Mr.. VIM. r. Cochran informed


me that the peach prospects just now
| were of the most excellent character,
| that the trees were in fine condition, and


unless some extraordinary combination
of adverse circumstances prevailed, the
coming crop would be of large dirnen-
sions. AS to its reinunerative character,


he could not speak, but could only hope
that the growers would realize comfort
able profits. Mr.. Cochran has been one
of the foremost growers in opening up
new peach markets in Pennsylvania,
New York and the East, and thinks that
in a few years the shipping arrangements
may be such as to eifectually prevent
those annoying and extensive gluts in
the peach markets of New York and
Philadelphia, that recent seasons wit
messed, no matter how large the crop


may prove.


THE BANQUET.


AT $3.50 o'clo ck the entire company re-
pared to the dining-room, and there sat
down to one of those handsome feasts


which Mr.. Alex. Maxwell, who now has
charge of the National, and his excellent
wife, know SO well how to prepare. The


tables were adorned with handsome bou-
quetS, and We're substantially decorated
with oysters, terrapin, spring chicken,
salads, aud numerous other delicacies, to
which ample justice was done by all pres
ent.


THE ToASTS.


When the appetltes of all were satisfied
the mental programme was entered upon,
aud was opened by Columbus Watkins,


Esq, who read letters from Hon. Thomas


+. Bayard, and Hon. VIM. G. Whiteley
The letters expressed the regret of the


writers at their inability to be present,
and contained the warmest expressions
of regard for Mr.. Cochran as citizen


and public legislator. Mr.. Watkins
then announced the regular toasts, as fol-
lows:


l. ""The Guest of the Evening"""" Ex-


Representative Henry A. Nowland, of
Middletown, in response, said IL was the
first time in the history of st. Georges


Hundred that such an affair as the pre-


ent had been originated. The reason for
this was, in his opinion, that the wishes


of all the people of the Hundred were


found expressed in the votes cast in the


Legislature by Mr.. Cochran. Mr.. Now


land paid glowing tribute TO Mr.. Coch-


rams brilliant record as a legislator, and


closed with the following appropriate
sentiment to the guest of the evening:


""Intelligent, faithful and true: may his
Legislative record only bs eclipsed by his
record as a private citizen"" Applause
Mr.. Cochran made a feeling response
to the remarks of Mr.. Nowland. He said
the o oecasion to him was overwhelming
and embarrassing. Because a man had
done his plain duty he could see no rea-
son why he should be praised and patted


on the back. Are the times SO morally


disturbed, he inquired, that he should be


thus honored simply for performing his


duty? Abiding to his legislative career,


Mr. Cochran said he earnestly supported


the bill for funding the State debt into


four and-a-half per cent. bonds, because


he believed it TO he a wise measure, and


would have saved the State $4,000 per


year in interest. He also approved the


act for the appointment of Railroad


Commissioners, because he believed it"

Nr Longfellow is 10 receive the most elaborate
compliment ever paid to an American poet by his
publishers. Mc,srs. Houghton, O,good Il Co. have
just issued the opening numbers Of proposed
illustrated edition OF Mr. Longfcllow's poems, com


plee in two large qnarto volumes. IN such sump-
tuous typographical array and with such a wealth
of illustration as to make the work rank among The
very finest issues OF the American press. The type
il large the margin generous, and the presswork
perfect. Eutitis upon the illustrations that the
publisher, are making thc most Lavish outlay. These
are al entirely new The passages 10 be illustrated

effort has been made to secure accurate reprcsen-
tatiou. Thus. the translation of a national
song of Denmark has prefXcd TO II

President Lichtenstein in the chair


The space outside the railing was


packed with spectators, SO great was
the interest taken in the proceedings


After the call Of the roll the Presi
dent addressing the members said


Gentlemen of Council, We are here in
pursuance Of the provisions Of the City
Charter, which requires US to elect


various city officers on this date.


M. McGlinchsy-Mr. President,
move you sir that VIZ nov proceed to
the nomination and election OF Street
Commissioner. The motion was adop.
ted.


Mr.. Townsend nominated Louis P.
Lynch.


Mr.. Hart nominated Francis McClos-
key, and Mr.. Price nominated the pres
ent incumbent, 4. II. HOagland.


There being no further nominations
the chair appointed Messrs. Price and
Taylor tellsrs.


Mr.. McGlinchey then asked II 1t was
in order for him to make personal ex-
planatiou In reference to his vote, and
he was told that it was. Hs said that
he was extremely sorry that he was
compelled to act as he should have to
do. He thought that the wisdom of the
Democratic members would lead them
to act differently, aud he was compelled
to judge between the two, Mr.. Hoag.
land or Mr.. Lynch. Speaking of Mr..
Hoagland he said he had seen men un-
der his charge deprived Of rights as
American citizens, because they dared
not vote as they wished, for fear of los.
iug their positions. Will you ask
Democrats to vote for such q man?
think rot.


Mr.. Hart arose to explain. He said
that this bargain between Mr.. Lynch
and Mr.. Canon was made two
months before any caucus was held
Mr.. McGlinchey he said was pledged to
support Mr.. Lynch and he could prove
it. He said that he would never BIZ
whipped in like cur to any ring eau
Gus, and lose his manhood. The speak
ar said he would cast his vote for Fran
cis McC)oskry and he would challenge
any one to say anything against him.


Before Mr.. McGlinchey had commen-
ced to speak, Mr.. Lynch had left the
Council Chamber.


The first ballot was taken and it re-
suited as follows: Lynch 10; Hoagland
s; McCloskey 2. There was of course
no election, and on the ninth ballot
being taken resulted the same as the
fist.


As the ninth ballot was being taken
Mr.. Lynch entered the chamber, and
addressing the President, said he arose
to a question of privilege, that he de-
sired to define his position, and he said
that he proposed to give the truth as
near as he could get at it. Some four
months ago he aid his health began to
fail him and he had announced himself
as being candidate for the Street Com
missionership. He asked the members
to consider his claims but announced ii
as his intention to support tue caucus
nominee. He approached the member
from the Fourth Ward, Mr.. Paynter,
in regard to it and that gentleman then
told him to resign, which however,, the
speaker said he thought it would be
premature to do. He afterwards learned
that Mr.. Paynter was working against
him and going To Mr.. Paynter he said,
""Mr. Paynter have favor to ask ?""
| request that you do not oTer too much
opposition.


Mr.. Paynter then informed him that
he was going to defeat him. The speak
er did not consider that his being a
member Of Council d-barred him from
running for another Office and if neces-
sty demanded it he should cast vote
himself, though he did not intend to
say who he would vote for. If it was
unlawful for him to vote, he could be
restrained from acting as commissioner.
Speaking of Mr.. Hoagland he said that
he knew nothing against him, but as
far as he knew Mr.. Hoaglaud was a
gentleman. The speaker said that his
demanded that lie should
vote.


On the 10Th, 11th and 18th ballots
Mr.. Lynch did not vote and the result
was the same as on the first ballot.


Ontus thirteenth ballot as Mr.. Lynch,
was casting his vote, Mr.. Hart object.
ed


Mr.. Lynch replied that be had better
wait and see what his vote was tnat he
h al no right to anticipate it.


MIR. Paynter asked the opinion of the
chair on Mr.. Hart's objection.


The President decided that under
rule IA, which says that u member
shall not vote when directly interested,
Mr.. Lynch had no right to vote.


Coz. Taylor appealed from the decis-
ion and called for the ayes and nays.


The appeal was sustained by the fol-
lowing vote:


Nays-Messrs. Adams, Chandler,
Downing, Evans, Hart, Jones', Paynter,
PIice, Wood-9.


Ayes--Messrs. Guthrie, Heusted,
Knight, McGlinchey, Moore, Morton,
Taylor, Townsend, Walton, Dcrman-
10.


Mr.. McGliuchey contended that a
member has a constitutional right to
,ast his ballot, the rules of the Council
20 the contrary Notwithstanding.


The thirteenth ballot being taken re-
suited as follows: Lynch, 10; Hoag !,
land, g.; McCloskey, Q; blank, 1.
Col. Taylor inquired if blank votes
we're tounted, the chair replied that
hey were. II


The fourteenth ballot being taken re-
ulted as follows: Mr.. Lynch voting
his time for himself. Mr.. Lynch, II II
8; McCloskpy, 2. ,
The next business in order was the
election of Clerk OF the Market. Col.

 from the side of a mountain where

 they were grazing, l icked up two

 pieces of quartz one which he hurled

ter, the Actor. by a Teras Rufiam.


Mr.. Maurice Barrymore, the actor who
was wounded at Marshall, Texas, by the
ruf1ian Currie, on the night when Ben G. Por-
ter was killed; reached Philadelphia on
Wednesday last. Mr.. Barrymore gives an
account of the shooting, which differs in many
respects from tn ose which have been pub
lished, and which, if possible, shows Currie
in worse Light. Mr.. Barrymore prefaces
his story by telling how Miss Cumming, Mr..
Porter, and himself came to be in the restau-
rant where the tragedy occurred. After the
play In Marshall was over, while the company
was waiting in the hotel for the train
which would not be due until o'clock, Mr..
Barrymore and Miss Cummins, desiring to
have some coffee, called upon Porter to make
some in private cooking apparatus he al
ways carried with him. No; he didn't feel
like going to the trouble, and asked if there
wasn't some place where they could get it al
ready made Yes, the landlord said, they
could get it at the restaurant at the railroad
station, only hundred yards or so distant.
SO the three walked down to the station and
seated themselves on high stools at the eat
ing bar, and called for coffee. MIR.
Barrymore drank his cupfull, and then
went back to the hotel to look
after the baggage, Mr.. Porter and Miss
Cummins, concluding to have little lunch,
remaining in the restaurant. While Mr..
Barrymore was gone, Currie came in and
seated himself near Miss Cummins, and be-
gan to make himself very offensive. When
ever Porter ordered a dish, Currie would
echo the order in loud and insulting man.
ner. No attention was paid to him; and
after amusing himself in this way for a
while, he went into the bar in an adjoinin e
room. MIR. Barrymore returning after an
absence of about five minutes, Miss Cum
minis was telling him how the ruffian had
behaved. Currie again entered the room,
and, approaching Porter, began pouring
out volley of oaths and obscenity. Porter
told him that he wanted to have nothing to
do with him and reminded him that there
was lady present.


''A hell of lady she is!'' replied the
ruffian.


""She is lady and under our protection -
said both gents at once, when MIR. Barry
more spoke, saying to Porter they did not
want to have anything to do with Curric.


The bully turned to him and said, ''Per-
haps you'd like to take it up?'' s'1'm not
Particular"" replied Barrymore, ''but I'm un-
armed. $50 am l."" said Currie. ""Haven't
you pistol?'' ""No.'' ""Will you swear that
you have not?'' eyes"" ""Then take of
your coat"" said the actor"" who learned the
manly art of self defense in his college DAYS
in England.


No sooner had Barrymore thrown off bis
coat than Currie drew two revolvers, one in
each hand, and lev vsled them at his unarmed
antagonist. Even then Barrymore did moi
believe he would fire, but thought he meant
to frighten him by fourishing his weapons
The actor put up his hands in the boxing
| attitude, when the ruffian fired, the ball
striking Barrymore in the muscle Of the left
arm, above the elbow, and lodging near thu
skin, under the shoulder-blade. His first
thought was to seize spittoon, but there
was not one in the room, and even the stools
that they had been sitting on were fastened
down. He rushed into the bar-room in
search of loose chair, or anything that he
could hurl at the assassin, without success
and, as he re-entered the room Currie fired
at him again, but missed.


This all took place in much less time thar
it takes to tell it. Porter and Miss Cum.
Minis then moved toward the door leading
| out onto the platform. As they reached the
door Porter and Barrymore faced about, and
that instant Currie, who was still standing
in the middle of the room, fred the shol
from which poor Porter died forty minutes
afterward. Currie passed out at = side door
and was arrested two hours after. ,,!. =
Mr.. Barrymore says that if the shooting
had occurred in the daytime, Curriet woulc
surely have been lynched before he had eve,
reached the Jail. = IA: =


There is not the least sympathy for hin
in the community. He has been terror to
peaceable citizens. He always went hesvil,
armed, sometimes having four revolvers
two of which he carried in his sleeves, ready
to drop into his hands on the instant. Hi


is said to have murdered seven men ant


three women.
/ Mr.. Barrymore thinks he will recover tn
use of his hand in . few weeks, and hope
| to be able to attend Currie's trial in June

upon which the plaintiffs advanced their money they
had abundant opportunity to examine them before
paying their money. He contended that as the

junk bottle, knocking him sense
less. Reed was armed. The jailor
in falling eXtinguished the candle,

heart. The Cor0ner's jury re-
turned verdict of justifia-

The water Committee on the petition
OF u. Is. Guyer, asking for the extension
OF water pipes on Poplar street between
Eleventh and Twelfth streets, made
favorable report, estimated cost $l25.
The report Was concurred in.


The Committee ON Public Buildings
made an adverse report on the petition
OF William Barrford, asking Council to
set apart one hundred feet on King street
below Second for resident fishermen.


The report of the cOmmi tee led to
debate which was opened by Mr.. Norton,
who said that while he did hot like to say
anything against a report of a committee,
he certainly would take exceptions to the
report just offered. The object of the pc
titloH, was,as far as he could understand
IL, to protect our resident fishermen;
men wao are obliged to be down the bay
fishing, and send their wives and daugh-
ters TO sell the fish. Last summer he
knew Of many instances where peddlers
OF fish from the lower part of the Stale,
and Mary land. came here and dIov the
wives and daughters from off the streets.
and the shad spoiled on their hands; con-
sequeDtly the best shad that are caught,
are shipped away.


Mr.. Taylor said he was surprised at
the remai ks just made by the gentleman.
Why it has only been two weeks ago that
he advocated free markets, and now he
wants to force class legislation. The
committee did not object to setting apart
a space for the resident fishermen duIing
market days, but they did object to set
ting apart space for them every day. I'm
dei the existing ordinance the sale of
fish on the street is a nuisance to the
residents in the vicinity.


Mr.. Norton said that if the gentlemen
of the committee would walk through
the market they would find that the or
dinance was violated every day.


MIR. Taylor said that it was the duty
of Council to make laws and there were
executive officers to carry them out
Members Of Council are not supposed
to do police duty. The report Of the
committee was then adopted.


The same committee made a similar
report oh the petition Of George ii. Tin
dali asking authority to erect frame
shop on an alley between Ninth and
Tenth and Poplar and Lombard streets.
the report was adopted.


The City Treasurer reported $2,371, Ia
In bank to the credit of current expenses,
paid out on draft of Water Commission
srs since last report the sum of $96,25,
and in total to date the sum Of $14S,4l2,-
81.


The Chief Engineer of the Water De-
partment reported 81 men in his employ
for the week ending March 18th, pay
roll $214,12.


The Street Commissioner reported 81
men s double and q single teams in his
employ for the week ending March 18Th;
pay roll, $232,4o.


PETITIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS.


The following petitions and communi-
cations, were introduced, read and refer
red to the proper committees:

bate of water rent on the Steamboat and
Railroad Hotel, and ON the building No.

ed that he be permitted to build upon

ance for the relief If Mr., Rudolph.

tees of Bethal A. NJ. X. church, be al

tion from the Washington Fire Company

Mr.. Norton presented the following
resolution which was adopted.
Resolued. That the resolution passed
about two years ago prohibiting the erec-
ton of lamps in the center OF a square is
hereby repealed.


Mr.. McGlinchey presented resolu-
tion instructlng the street Commissioner
to have all dirt which is taken from
""Quarry lot"" deposited on Christians
avenue, as per advertisement for propos'
ais.


| Mr.. Norton was not in favor of the
resolution. He thought ii preposterous
to haul the dirt from the lot, TO Chris
tiana avenue, when it is needed so badly
over Eleventh street bridge, only short
dis anc~ from the lot.


Mr.. McGlnchey said that it was ar
express understanding that the dirt Was
to be taken to Christana avenue anC
contrac, o,s had bid accordingly. He die
not like any double dealings. One o.
the bidders oflei ed to do the work at II
cents per foot |, IS if the dirt was to bt
taken over Eleventh street. 1t was
stipulated In the advertisement that the
DIRT Was TO go over third street bridge
and the contract was awarded that way"

Especial Telegram to the Globe


MADISON, Wis, March pa disastrous
fire took place here this afternoon, causing
the destruction of the old Fairchild block,
corner of Main and Pinckney streets, and
the serious burning of half dozen fremen.
The block was occupied on the ground floor
by Rawley & Co., furnishing goods G. A.
Damon, tailor; Mcdonnell & Smith, station
Iommie Morgan as restaurant and saloon,
and one Of the upper rooms by tailor's
work room. The fire was discovered in the
OF the third story, and alarm given.
The fire department was promptly on hand.
A number of the sack company taking a
couple Of Babcock extinguishers up in a
coal room under where the fire originated
and had commenced to play on the fire,
when terrible explosion took place, throw
ing some Of the firemen to the floor and
others down the stairway to the
street. Large crowds had collected
around the burning building, and the
widest excitement prevailed. Those who
were thrown down stairs were picked
up, and those injured in the rooms above
were carried to the street, when second
explosion followed, which caused the rear
walfto fall in. This was followed by third
explosion. Two engines were playing on
the fire all this time, and soon a hose was
attached to a hydrant, the pipes of which
were connected with the university reser-
Voir, and the flames were soon under control,
not, however, until the two upper stories of
the building were destroyed klauber's
building, occupied by Max Landteur, dry
goods, and Burrows opera house, were in
great danger, and were only saved by the
university hydrant pipe The following are
those burned more or less seriously: A..
Cheney, fireman, and A. M. Daggett,
secretary of the sack company; Tommie
Morgan, proprietor of the St. Julien saloon
Robert Eumch, Will Spauldlng, Jake Van
Eta, proprietor of the Victor House, A..
Schoening, S. L. Sheldon, T. G.. Grove. JAS
Reynolds, district attorney, Alfred Goder
dam, John Parks, Robert Woolton, Peter
zirkel, Henry Woltzinger, Chas. Bixby and
Walt. Lynch. Schoening, Spaulding and
Humch are dangerously burned, principally
about the face, and it is thought they can
not recover. The origin of the fire and of
the explosions is a mystery. The first ex-
plosion, which burned those mentioned,
knocked nearly all the windows out, and the
theory that it was confined heat and smoke
is disputed by the fact that all the windows
in the building out when
the second and third explosions came. It
is hinted strongly that it was the work of
an incendiary, who had placed something of
an explosive nature between the floor and
ceiling in the third story for the purpose of
accomplishing the destruction of the block.
The block is owned by the Fairchild estate,
Of
Fairchild and Mrs. Sarah Fairchild Dean.
The loss on building is $4,000. Rowley,
Damon, Klauber and Mcdonnell & Smith, 8
several losses are principally from water and
moving goods. and all are fully insured OK
cept Mcconnell & Smith, who lose 81 1000,
and are insured for $4,000.

CINCINNATI, March 29.-The Licking coun-
ty (Ohio) court house, handsome structure
with four fronts, standing in the center of
the public square at Newark, Ohio, and Just
finished at cost of 100000, caught fire in
the cupola from gas jet used to illuminate
the clock, at II o'clock to-day, and has now
burned down to the second story. It will
probably be totally destroyed. Assistance
from the Columbus department is momen-
tarily expected. Insurance but $4,000.


COLUMBUS, March 29-Two engines have
been sent to Newark from this point. A
special to the Erening Dispatch lust re-
ceived states that the fire in the court house
has destroyed the third and is now burning
in the second story. Most ali the important
county records are safe and militia are on
duty guarding the county property. Great
excitement prevails among citizens and a
large number of country people who are

MEETING or TIE DOCK coMxIssIoSERs


An informal investigation was held before the
Dock commissioners yesterday morning regarding
the charges against the tug A!anson sumner, which
dumped eight scows loaded with dock dredgings of
NortOn's Point on Sunday, August IL. The Two
HERALD reporters who were watching in special
yacht the violation of theiaw on that occasion
examined by the Commissioners at length. and the
particulars repeated substance they de-
tailed il the HERALD. Tho Commissioners said that
the pilot and other employees on the tug
stated positively that the dumping was
done much further DOWN tho bay. But
the spot designated y the pilot was shown 10 be u-
side o4 the limit prescribod by law. Tic Commis-
sioners said, further, that the defence that the
scows were broken loose from the tul by a heavy
sea and the lives OF the imperiiIed. Sonse-
4uently they were forced 10 dump poss-
bic, and no wilfu violation OF the law intended
The pilot and the captain had said that they
entirely misrepresented. The HERALD reporters
planned to the Commissioners the chart and the
HERALD map that they the reportersl could not DO
mistaken, as a skiltul pilot took the bearings by
chart and instrument at the time the violation
committed, and on reaching the place OF dumping a
greasy scum was found hoating IN patches on tho
water i'll such quantities hat tho engineer Of tho
HERALD yacht spoke OF it a. the time, and said that
II came from tho dock dumpngs taken from somo
district where oil grease had settled and soaked
into the slime OF the bottom.

Tho Commissioners urged that the iino WIS heavy
and the consequences dismissal OF the offenders

that violation OF the law had actually occurred.
The reporters referred the commissioners to tine
pilot and engineer, who both witnesses OF the
hagrant offence which was so openly committed on
that sunday afternoon. In conversation which
took place subsequently, tho Commissioners wero

AUGUSTA, Me-, Nov. 1Sth.-The
excitement over the expected
counting out of the Republican
Legislature runs high to-day, and
by the early trains large number
of leading Republicans from ali
parts of the State arrived. Senator
Blaine il here and large number
of Senators and Representatives
whose seats are threatened are on
hand. The Governor and Council
arrived during the day and assem-
bIed at the State House at 4o'clock.
A committee of one from each
county waited on the Governor,
who was unable to see them. A
subcommittee of three was then
appointed, a long consultation with
the Governor resulting in an assur-
ance from the latter, that the re-
turns would not be considered open
in the sense of allowing any
amendment or corrections under
the statute, until the Committee OF
the Council on Elections should re-
port the result of it's canvass, and
that there would be twenty days
from that time for any legal correc-
tion. 1t is rumored that the votes
of the towns of Kittery and Au.
burn and other places are to be
thrown out for informality, which
will change the figures in the State
Senate and give the Democrats
and Greenbackers seven majority
over the Republicans. The actual
vote as cast gives the Republicans

Samuel Odell, and seeing Odell
sitting near window inside, placed

ing him instantly. Hines then
went into the house and was de-
termined to cut Mrs. Odel's throat
with butcher knife, but finally
let her live. About six months ago
Hines met Mrs. Odell in a corn
field and frightened her terribly at
the time when sshe was in delicate
health. For this Odell threatened
to be revenged, and Hines says
that it was because he was afraid of
his own life that he took Odell's.
Threats are made of lynching

Immediately following our inter
view with Denis Kearney, we sen
a letter to Mr.. f. Mac Crellish, ed
itor of the AIta, calling for a verl
fication of the story which we hat
copied from that paper of May 28th
1878, in regard to Kearney's cow
ardice on the Montana. In oul
conversation with Kearney We'd
nesday, in the office of Wells, Fargo
& Co.'S Express, we stated that we
intended to ask the Alta to verify
or retract the story. There were
two significant circumstances to u:
then apparent. First, although
the story was published in the
HERALD, on the morning of the
evening on which Mr.. Denis Kear-
ney referred to Father Lynch of the
HERALD, he did not, in the whole
course of his speech, deny or in any
way tackle the charge. Secondly,
when, in the course of our conver.
sation with Kearney, we held ouI
letter to Mr.. Mac Ctellish in ouI
hand, and said we were about to
mail it, informing him that we
called upon the editor of the Alta
for proof or retraction of the charge,
Kearney said that no notice would
be taken of our communication.
This was evidently mistake on
Kearney's part, as the following
dispatch from Mr.. Mac Crellish,
promptly succeeding the receipt OF
our letter. shows:


SAN FRANCISCO, March Goth.
MIR. J. d. LYNCH:-Mr. johnson,
our reporter, has sent you to-day q
statement on Kearney and his con-
duct on the steamer Montana.
Read it and print 1t. Nearly a
year has elapsed since this publica-
ton, and Kearney has not vet
brought any libel suit.


l. . h AS


We observed Kearney keenly
during our conversation, and no.
ticed that he did not enjoy the sub
ject, Notwithstanding that he had
introduced it himself, after we an
nounced our purpose to probe it to
the bottom and give him the bene-
fit of the cold facts, however they
might bear. The full statement
will probably arrive to-day.
Since writing the foregoing we
have received the following state
ment, by telegraph from Mr.. John
son, the reporter of the Alta, who
originally received the facts from
the lips Of Capt. Carroll:


J. D. LYNCH, EDITOR HERALD:
Since 1872, to the present time,
have been local reporter of the
Alta. About one month previous
to May, 1873, l had an interview
with Capt. Carroll at his house, on
Minna street, and took very CO.
pious notes, which served me as the
basis of an article on Dennis Kear-
ney, reproduction of which was
lately circulated In your city. After
having written the article 1t was
set up and I, personally, submitted
proof to Capt. Carroll, who read it,
and, in the presence of his wife,
stated that the facts therein related
were substantially correct. 1 held
the article back for three weeks,
consulting other parties in this
city, who were more or less &C.
quainted with the facts related. II
leaked out that the article was to
appear and the Alta was threatened
with o libel suit if the article did
appear. At the date designated and
on the following Sunday the Alta
was denounced on the sand lots but
the libel suit was never brought. ]
would send you new statement
from Captain Carroll, but he is
now absent as Master of the Great
Republic. But it will reach here
on Sunday from Portland and
may advise you further.


J. g. JOHNSON,


Reporter Alta.


In his whole conversation with
us Kearney's manner was not such
as to indicate his belief that he was
sincere in the statement that he
had acted q mans part in the oc.
currence in controversy. From the
present aspect of the story we have
no doubt that Kearney is not proud
of that particular incident of his
history, and does not seek to have
it minutely investigated. 1t must
be borne in mind that no Angelefio
has said that the thing did not oc-
cur, but their statements stop at
the fact that they did not witness
1t. 1t is only reasonable to suppose
that, in time of critical suspense
on O vessel, the Captain, in order
not to unduly alarm the passengers,
would select private section OF
the vessel for stormy interview
with his subordinate. Kearney
undoubtedly seems to have acted
the poltroon on critical occasion,
upon which the lives of both the
passengers and crew, of q vessel OF
which he was an officer, were in
peril. We have fully acquitted
ourselves of our duty of fair play.
Our verdict is against Kearney.

THE DIRT is LEFT TO THE STREET


COMMITTEE.


Council met in regular session last eve-
ming, President Lchtenstein in the chair.


There were but two reports from the
standing committees, but the session was
heightened out by discussion on mo-
tion OF MIR. Walton, to rescind previous
action of Council directing the d'rt from
""Quarry Lot"" to be placed on Chrstiana
avenue.


The Committee on Public Buildings
reported favorably on the petition of A
bury M. X. Church asking for the use of
the City Hall during the first week of
June to hold strawberry festival.
The special committee appointed to
confer with the Levy Court IN regard to
the new county buildings, submitted the
following report from the Levy Court as
their action Oh the matter on Tuesday
last:


Resolred, That this Court af.er having
viewed the different proposed si.es for
the erection of new court house for Ne W
Castle county, iu the city of Wilmington,
deem the square situated between Tenth
and Eleventh aud Market and King
streets In said city,a the most convenient
To all the business interests land therefore
the best location for sal purpose.
Resotoed, That the attorney for this
Court, George Gray, Esq. be, and is here
by instructed to inquire into the title of
said property and that he have the neces-
sary papers prepared, conveying the whole
OF said square with the improvements
thereon from the said city of Wilmington
to the Trustees named in the bill passed
by the Legislature at the late sess on, and
entitled an act TO remove the county
couIts of New Castle county.


ResOtUed, That the clerk of this Court
be instructed to send copy of the fore
going resolutions 10 the chairman of the
committee of City Council at Whining
ton.


Mr.. Guthrie moved that the report be
referred to the Law Committee In con-
nection with the City Solicitor.
Mr.. Taylor desired to know the object
of referring the report to the Law Com
mitLee, he thought that it should be re-
ferred to the special committee appointed
to confer with the Levy Court.
MIR. Guthrie thought that the discussion
as to what committee the matter should
be referred to was very childish. The
| matter had been decided once; the City
Council had offered the Levy Court three
squares of ground, and the Court had
decided TO Ike the Tenth street square.
MIR. Lynch did not understand when
the resolutions rendering the ground to
the Levy Court, were passed that it was
the intention of giving them the whole
ground. He was in faver of giving them
part Of the ground.


Mr.. Taylor said that the whole square
was to he given to the Levy Court, he
certainly was not in favor of giving them
the Improvements on the ground. There
was a pump and pump house there that
was worth considerable money to the
city, and he did not think it should be
given away.


Mr.. Guthrie did not think tha Levy
Court would desire to take the pump
from the city. He thought that they
would allow the city to remove the pump,
and also allow the city the bricks that
are in the buildings.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that he voted to
give the Levy Court part of the ground
at the basin, and he thought the other
part should be reserved for the use OF
the city to erect city buildings on.
| The motion to refer the matter to the
P, Special Committee was adoptee.
/ The City Treasurer reported s., ,45O.70
in the bank to the credit of current ex-
penses; paid out on draft of water COM
missioners since last report the sum OF
$6o.4S and in total to-date the sum OF
$l4S, S,543.69.


The chief engineer of the water depart
ment reported 80 men in his employ fol
the week ending April 25th; pay roll
S1S7.49. The street commissioner re-
ported ""a men, 8 double, and l single
team in his employ for the week end
ing April 18th; pay roll, $1Ss.e9.

A Democratic Flash In the Pan.
The meeting Of the City Council on
Saturday afternoon was an amusing
one to those who were disinterested
and yet understood the true inwardness
of the Vaccinations which had been
employed. Nobody seemed to know
the object of the meeting and yet ev'
erbody seemed to surmise that it had


something to do with the election of


street commissioner. What that some


thing was, was generally conceded tt


bs the acceptance Of the resignation o;
Col. Lynch should that gentlemsr


think it safe to offer it, and then tt


elect Col. Hughes to fill the vacancy in


the City Council. If this could have


been done, the way would then have
been clear for the election Of Col. Lynch
this evening at the meeting Of the City
Council by one majority without the
Col. having to go through the humi!ia-
ting process of voting for himself, in
violation of the law and ordinances. OF
course it was expected that some Re-
publican would have been caugh, nap
ping and away from the Saturday af-
ternosn's meeting, and then all the
Democrats being present they would
have been perfectly safe in carrying
out the programme agreed upon. When
the Council was called to order and the
roll called, sure enough one Republican
was absent, but alas for the excited
Democratic ringsters, Democratic
member, Mr.. Moore from the Fifth Ward
was also absent. This completely up
set the calculations of the Democrats
and already the steadfastness of Mr..
Moore to the Democracy in this their
trying hour became subject of suspi
cion.


Had he been in his seat at the proper
time the business of the meeting would
no doubt have speedily been made
manifest and railroaded through on the
lightning express. Councilman knight
full of fight and something else, with
his newly elected colleague in charge,
and Who he was initiating into the
mysteries of councilmanic business,
seemed big with the Importance Of
the occasion, and when the proposition
was made to adjourn, he Couldn't see
it no how"" but was willing to take a
recess for half an hour, which would
allow the laggard member time to be
present. Mr.. Norton whose true devo,
tion to Democracy no sane man could
doubt, saw no use in remaining there
if there was no business to be brought
before council, and through his motion
and influence Council adjourned. Mr..
Norton had evidently not been booked
up, and it was somewhat aggravating
to Democratic patience to see Mr.. Moore
walking in to take his seat, just as the
other members were walking out of
theirs after adjourning. Nc. knight
swore like Hebe at Col. Norton, for


pressing his motion to adjourn, and
some of the strongest expletivss found
in Webster were used in denoun,ing
the tardiness of Mr.. Moore. The Re-
publcans and the two Democrats who
refused to obey the caucus ring lash
smiled nplacently as eleven Demo
Gratis with elongated countenanoes
passed out of the room. The Demo-
cratic ring gun had flashed in the pan
and provided all the Republicans will
be present this evening, there will be
no chance for Lycnh to resign, and he will
be under the necessity of voting for
himself in violation of law."

HOUSE.",,"When Senator Allen arrived in Wash
ington he found the city filled with strang~
ers who came from all parts of the coun
try to be present at the Inauguration of
President-elect Van Buren,. Among
them were number OF leading men from
Ohio, and they occupied so much of their
newly-elected Senator's time, that it was
not until hate on the night on the Sd OF
March that he had an opportunity of
speaking informally and freely with his
life long friend, President jackson. On
that night, however, he went to the
White House, Senator of the nation
to see the man who, little moro than
twenty years before, in the Lynchburg
tavern, had laughed over his boylsh Gu
riosi ity, and wondered at his ready tom
que. Without ceremony, being well
known TO the attendants, he was shown
into the Presidents bed>chamb ber. Chief
Justice Taney and Senator Forsythe OF
Georgia, afterward Minister to Spain and
Secretary of State, were already in the
room, and jackson himsel active, and
| to n certain extent restless, as usual, stood
in the middle of the floor smoking short
corn>cob pipe. He congratulated Allen
warmly upon his election TO the Senate,
and then calling to a young Irishman
who acted as his body servant and waiter,
turned to his visitors and said


Gentlemen, think the occasion will
warrant me in breaking over one of my
own rules. Let us drink little Madei
ra""


The wine was brought. JACKSON took
a small glassful-it was the first liquor
he had been known to touch for seven
months-and then. asking his friends to
excuse him for few moments, he finish
ed writing letter upon which he was
engaged. sealed, directed it, and lighting
his corn cob pipe again, took Whit or
two, and stood watching the face of a
great, tall, old fashioned clock which
stood in the corner. 1t was five minutes
before midnight, five minutes Sberore the
beginning of the day upon which An
drew Jackson would cease to be Presi-
dent of tie United States. Slowly the
minute hand moved around the dial. The
silence in the room became almost pain
ful. 1t was broken by the clear sharp,
bell of the clock striking the last hour
Of day which had gone forever. Then
Jackson, starting suddenly and looked
toward his friends said, with quick
nervous laugh :


Gentlemen, am no longer President
Of the United States, but as good a cii-
zen as any of you""


Subsequently he expressed to them a
feeling of great relief at the prospect of
escaping from the official cares which had
begun to weigh most heavily upon him,
saving to Allen, among other things of
the same sort, 81 am glad to get away
from all this excitement and bother""


That day Van Buren was inaugurated
President of the United States, and
Jhtk SNn, Nv tht tllu W HIS etc""hu 'o'ii,
left the White House-left it so poor that
he was obliged to borrow from his friends
S., 900 with which to rebuild the ""IIer-
mitage,"" his old family mansion, which
some time before had been burned to the
ground.


After the short executive session Of the
Senate which followed the Inauguration
Of the newly elected President. Senator
A Hen returned to his home. OF his SER
vice in the Senate, which is matter Of
public record, nothing need be said here.
Just before the expiration Of his first
term he went behind the Legislature, if
may be allowed the expression, and for
the first time announcing the doctrine that
n United States Senator was popular
representative, went directly to the peo-
pie as a candidate for re election. The
result was that the Democrats had
handsome majority in the Legislature,
and he was re eleceed without any oppo-
sition In the meantime, Harrison had
been elected to the Presidency and had
died. Tyler had gone into the White
House, and, with the help Of Allen and
two or three others, had broken up the
Wing party From Sketch Of Wm.
Allen IN the N. T. Times."

has been trying to string you down in York""

esped a'policeman on IN opposite corner trying to

ashore. and seeing that the other two were

but the referee very justly decided that
the slight foul which did in the
first half OF the race injured Carmen more than

September 10. taken from the jail. at Golden.
and lynched ct one o'clock this morning by 150

THE MURDER.


The murder for which the men were lynched was
o cold-blooded and cowardly one. Seminole and
Woodruff stopped at Haywards house. near Golden.
and employed him to take them to q cattle camp in
the mountains. He started out with the men, and
was never seen alive again by his family. Search
was made for him and his team for several days. and
three weeks later his body was found under
culvert a short distance from Denver. clew
was obtained as to the direction in which
the men had gone. and it was closely followed.
it was discovered that on the night OF the
murder the had driven into Denver and put up
tho team. intending to sell 1t next day. On the fol.
lowing morning the sale of the team was made for
$685. $40 of the money being paid in cash and the
rest in check. The men then hired u team which
they took short distance. when they cut loose the
horses aud proceeded on the animals backs.

sand lots waiting for Kearney's arrival,
which is anticipated with the greatest in
terest, as almost everything will depend
upon the course he concludes to adopt.


HOPES FOR KALLocHs RECOVERY.


At half-past six o'clock P. NJ Mr.. Kalloch
was in much improved condition.
slight examination has been made and the
physicians express the opinion that there
is good ground for expecting his recovery.


MODERATION ADVISED.


The evening journals counsel, above all
things. moderation on the part of the work
ingmen for the credit of the city and also
for their own sake on account of the bear
ing their action will have on the result
of the present campaign. The BulLe-
tin says, in effect, that the shooting
was a deliberate assassination, and reminds
its readers that twenty three years ago the
people of the city hanged the man who
killed an editor who dared express his con-
victions, but that now the law of society
seems to be that an editor may say
party talks his life is to be for
feited. It warns the workingmen that
the course they pursue will be the best evil
dence of their ability to administer the
affairs of the city, and that to resort to vio-
lence would be fatal mistake. The Post
practically claims that either Kalloch or
De Young was justified in the personal
attack by the language used. but De Young
was most to blame for beginning the quar-
rel by lampooning the father of Kalloch.


SYMPATHY WITH KALIocH.


So far as can at present be learned the
feeling of the community is almost entirely
with Kalloch. De Young's action is univer-
sally branded as q cold. blooded assassina-
ton, and the belief is general that if the
workingmen in the event of Kalloch's death,
demand the surrender of De Young for
lynch justice outside of the lawfully con-
stituted authorities not hand would be
raised to prevent the consummation of
their DESIRE 1t is rather early as yet to
speculate upon the effect of the occurrences
or upon political affairs, but this much
is evident from the expressions
heard on every side, that whatever
the result of Kalloch's wound, the affair
the Hon. Bilks, in this city. If Kalloch re-
covers he is likely to receive vote much
greater than would have been given
him had nothing Of the kind occurred.
If he dies, the detection from the
Honorable Bilks is likely to be still greater,
but in that case the republicans will prob
ably profit to some extent


It is difficult to say what the effect will
be in the interior, but it can hardly
fail to be disastrous to the Honor
able Bilks. The Chronicle has been
head and front Of that organization.
1t called the party into being, organized it
and has championed it in and out of season,
and it can hardly be otherwise than that
the elimination of the bitter political war
it has waged in assassination will result in
great damage to the prospects of the party
throughout the State.


| INDIGNATION IN THE INTERIOR.
Such advices as have been received from
the interior show the existence of degree
of indignation only second to that evinced
in this city. At the workingmen's head
| quarters they are in constant receipt OF
offers from interior towns Of men and arms
to assist in executing vengeance on the
De Youngs.


| = KEARNEY HEADS THE woRKISGMEy.
| Kearney arrived on the Vallejo boat this
evening. At the wharf he was met by ""a
crowd of several thousand, who received
| their leader with an almost frantic exhib-
| ton of Joy. The workingmen's military
companies, to the number of 160 men, with
rifles and fixed bayonets, were on hand as
an escort. With Kearney at their head the
procession moved up Market street for the
sand lots, filling the street for several
blocks and making the air ring with cheers
for Kearney and cries of ""Hang De Young. -

McComb informing him that his request
has been granted.


THE SAND LOTS MEETING.


In accordance with notices posted on
the streets workingmen assembled in
immense numbers at the sand lots.
and by two o'clock, notwithstand-
ing the crowds gathered on the
streets in town, over ten thousand
excited men were gathered around rude
rostrum shouting, cursing and calling for
the blood Of Kalloch's assassin. Clitus
Barbour took the stand and addressed the
meeting, earnestly urging the workingmen
to await the arrival of kearney before taking
further steps. The crowd, however, was
eager for action and listened with bad grace
to all arguments tending to delay their
vengeance. Barbour continued, dwelling
upon the fact that they were unorganized
and in no condition to cope with the police
and military. In reply, the crowd de-
manded to be led at once down town to
hang De Young and demolish the Chronicle
Office Barbour informed them that the
presidents of the ward clubs were in ses-
sion and had decided to await the arrival
of Kearney, but that if Kalloch died they
were fully determined to hang De Young
without delay Tremendous cheers greeted
this announcement. Wright, vice presi-
dent of the party, addressed the crowd in
| the same strain.


KEARNEY COMING.
| A despatch was read from Kearney stating
he would be down from Vallejo by the
eight p NJ boat, asking that a committee
be sent to Vallejo to give him full state
ment of the condition of affairs on the way
down, and that any action be delayed until
his arrival. Flynn, secretary of the party,
read a message from Kalloch counselling
the meeting to be moderate and wait for
Kearneys arrival.


| RESTRAINING THE MOB.


William Wellock and Mr.. Cross, of Ne
vada City, the candidate of the party for
Attorney General, who happened to be in
town. also counselled moderate measures.
Stephen May bell, who has been prominent
at the sand lots meetings heretofore, at
tempted to excite the too ready crowd to
deeds of violence, but was suppressed by
those on the stand, although the crowd was
with Maybell, and clamored wildly that he
should be heard.


| EXCITEMENT HIGH.


Other speakers sought to quiet the
people, assuring them that in case Mr..
Kalloch's wounds proved fatal summary
vengeance should be taken on his muir
derer. This was the only expression that
called out the unqualified appreciation
of the crowd, which finally agreed
to remain quiet until Kearney's arrival.
There is no doubt that in the event of Mr..
| Kallochs death determined effort will be
made to storm the Jail and lynch both the

The subject of grading Shearlnan street
through the quarry lot) coming up as
unfinished business, Mr.. Norton moved
to refer the matter to the Street Commit





| Streets.


Mr.. McGlinchey said the only reason
he had made motion Cat the previous
meetng) tor ""a reference of the subject to
the Committee on Opening S reefs, was
that he thought the affair might be CON-
promised. The contract between the
city ant the Chrstiana River Improve
ment Company called for the grading of
Shearman street, but there was no such
street running beyond Pine street, there
fore the contract was illegal. To grs de
the lot, rs called for by the contract,
would cost about $4,000, and the stone
taken out had already cost the city over
one dollar per perch. 1t was an outrage
for any committee to make such COLI
tract, and it looked a great deal like
ljobbery.


Mr.. Norton's motion was adopted, and
the subject was referred to the Street
Committee.


In relation to the marsh bill, Mr..
Paynter said the marsh owners had held
several meetings during the week, but
had not conferred with the City Council
committee. They were to be present at
this meeting and offer some amendments
to the bill, and he did not know whether
to have the bill acted upon at once or
give the marsh owners another week. lie
was of the opinion that the owners could
not agree among themselves as to what
they really wanted.
u On Mr.. Paynter's motion the bill wa.
, laid over one week, but this motion was
afterwards re-considered, and the post
lponement male to extend only to Mon
day night, when an adjourned meeting
OF Council will be held

Nj. Paynter said that it was a well
known fact that great deal OF dissat'
istaction had been caused IN regard tt
the awarding of the contract, as is seer
from the communication received fron
George W. Griffith, and it would b,
beneficial for the city to live up to wha

THE QUARRY LOT DIRT.
The subject of the ""Quarry Lot"" dirt
again came by the introduction of the
following resolution offered by Mr. Hart:
ResolUed, That the Street Committee
be and are hereby instructed to have the
remainder of the dirt from the quarry lot,
placed on Christlana avenue, and man
stationed at the damp.
Mr.. Chandler spoke in favor of the res
olution and said that the dirt was need
| ed over on Christiana avenue where it
| would benefit hundreds and net on
Thatcher street where it was OF no bene.
| fit except to few. The people of this
| city have been trying for the last hun
| dred years to get wharf on the Della


ware, and by placing the dirt on Christ


lana aredue would accomplish the OBJ
ject,


Mr.. Norton moved to amend the reso-
| lution by leaving the matter in the hands


OF the Street Commissioner.
| Mr.. McGlinchey was not in favor Of
the amendment. If the matter was left


In the hands of the Street Committee, he


knew very well what would become of
the dirt. He contended that the resolu-


ton he offered on March 20Jh and adopt


ed March 9th directing that the dirt bs
placed on Christiana avenue, was still n
force. The motion of Mr.. Walton at the
previous was to ""rescind the resolution
The word resolution does not mean res-
| olutions, and there were two resolutions


adopted by Council on the matter. There
was one offered by Mr.. Paynter which
| was adopted on April 3rd ,worded nearly
| the sa me as his, and he contended that
| that was the one Council had rescinded
| and not the one offered by him and
| adopted. He ca He'd for the reading of
| the resolutions. After the reading, he
desired to know If his resolution was


mentioned by Mr.. Walton, in his motion
or in the debate that ensued. He thought
the Street Committee had acted in bad
ia tn.


Mr.. Taylor said all the discussion was
on Mr.. McGlinchey's resolution, and not
on the one offered by Mr.. Paynter pro-
vlding fora man to be placed at the
dump.


MIR. Paynter said that he did not desire
to discuss the matter, as 1t had been fully
| ventilated heretofore. All he desired to
say was that the members voting to place
| the dirt over Eleventh street bridge,


were voting TO take 5000 out of the City
Treasury, and place it in the pockets of
| the contractor. He called for the pre-
vious questions, and the call was adopt


ed without dissenting vote.

residence in Syracuse he has caught more than two
hundred runaway horses, saving many lives by his
destruction. Mr.. Findley IS an unassuming young
man. but his bravery is appreciated by the public
He was born in Albany, and came to Syracuse some
eighteen years ago. Although only twenty-three
years old, he has wife and family, and has served
five years at his trade as carriage painter. About
twelve years ago Findly began catching runaway
horses. He was somewhat tmid at first may be
imagined, but he gained confidence in himself as he
succeeded and experimental, and now does not hes-
tate to throw himself in the path of the most in
furated steed. Findlys first experience as q horse
catcher in Auburn. He waiting for a train
the depot one afternoon twelve years ago, when
his attention attracted by a runaway horse,
which was daShing toward him at break neck pace.
In the wagon were seated lady and her little child.
The mother was paralyzed with fear and could not
speak. The little child screamed in terror, and the
cheeks of the bystanders were blanched they saw
the frightened, maddened horse daShing furiously
toward train of cars that stood across the street.
The spectators all rushed out of the way, and dray
men and hackmen ran to place of safety. Findley
saw in instant that the occupants of the wagon
would be killed if they thrown against the train
of cars. Without hesitGting moment he planted
himself directly in front of the maddened beast and
sprang at his head. He threw the horse down, and
although the wagon was overturned, the occupants
were uninjured. save by mere scratches.


His method of stopping horse is as follows: When
he sees runaway horse approaching, he plants him.
self directly in its route and runs with 1t in the same
direction it is proceeding. Findley run like d
deer and by the time the runaway horse is abreast
him. nine times out of ten he is running fast the
horse To seize him by the check rein or one line

How a Boston Jobber in Shoes


Swindled His Creditors.

HIS PARTNERS TESTIMONY

Goods Procured on Credit, Invoiced to the


Partner and Shipped

[py TELEGRAPH TO THE HERALD",,"


ouently within the past few months to mention the
name of H. Frank Paige. who is under several indict-
ments for swindling his creditors out OF about.
100000. The details of the alleged swindle have
already been given. as also OF the arrest OF
gang of straw bailers who made several Intellectual
efforts to get him out of prison, for which
they are at present languishing in Charles Street
Jail. The trial at present before Judge Col
burn, of the Superior Criminal Court and several
witnesses have already testified. Last September
Paige bought largely of boot and shoe manufacturing
houses here representing that he had special part
ner who put into the firm s5O 600, and that he had
$4,000 surplus himself, making working capital OF
$4,000 cash. After he had the goods delivered
at his store he arranged with one Charles T. Stet-
son, formerly bookkeeper for him. but ut the
time of the transaction partner. to ship several
lots of the goods to Baltimore and other Southern
points in his name. He raised considerable
money thus. and when the plan was perfected and
his schemes likely to be discovered he it is charged
burned his books and sent Stetson to Europe. The
latter got back few months ago and made state
ment which put Mr.. Paige in very uncomfortable
position. In his testimony before the Court Stetson
makes out very dark for his former partner.


GETTING READY TO FAIL.


Among other things he said Paige told me that
he could get goods to the amount Of S15O000 by CIV
ing his note and afterward settle with his creditors
for about fifty cents the dollar Paige purchased
goods after July of fifty different firms had
conversation. with Paige the first week in August
relative to sending goods to Baltimore and other
places; Paige ordered me to send goods to Phila-
delpha and Baltimore and to ship the goods in my
name and ask them to send me by return advance,
and instruct them at the time to sell them
for my account, and during the season up to
November made several Shipments; the second ship
nent was made about ten days after the first ship
ment don't remember how many shipments were
made the last week in October; in this shipment
there some goods from Pierce Son. Holt. Jr..
and others some of these goods were brought into
the store about week before they shipped;
Paige instructed me to make out all these invoices in
my name and also the bills of lading as he did
not wish his name to appear; the latter part OF Au-
gust he ordered to ship these goods in his name,
but to invoice them in my NAME as he had heard
that it was rumored that he was going to fail.


Stetson gave list of the firms from whom Paige
had bought goods and those to whom consignmcnts
had been made. Among the latter the hrm of
$4,000 OF goods had been shipped. During the FORE


Of eean
continued his story and said that Paige
had told him that Mr.. Stern had agreed to
take the goods at the cost price, seventyfve cent
to be advanced; goods valued at $4,000 were thus
sold. the same being bought by him of parties in
Haverhill, Lynn and Boston to fill his consgnments;
Louis Stern, one of the firm of Henry Stern Co.. CT
New Orleans had office in this city; witness knew
goods sent TO Stern & Co. were in Paige's
name; there were goods shipped to Park.
tSe o told Witness to BE- as in q
failure the creditors might trace them; in shipping
the gSSas a < to b na Of
shipped goods from Paige's storc these goods were
sent in October. and consisted of property bought
of Hill Co., Murphy "" Son. Houghton X
Co.. +. L. Wheeler and man named
smith; samples of goods bought by Paige Of
Grotzan. Mitchell & Co.. Of Bsltimore Paige said he
must round and get slippers, which he finally
got of Son, of this city; these latter goods
were sent to Grotzan. Mitchell Is Co.. Stern Co..
New Orleans, and Park Lynch Il Co., Galveston and
the rest were sold in the store in Boston, witness
could not rccolect whether or not Paige told him
about the terms which he Paige made the pur-
chase.


INVESTING RESULTS SALES.


After detailing several other transactions Mr.. Stet
showed how Paige tried to get money and keep it
away from his creditors. lie said Grotzan. Mitchell
4 Co. remted by check gave the check to Paige; he
told to indorse and did he returned it to me
in my name: said his lawyer told him that it
would not do to deposit any more money in
deposit; he told me to select either the Faneuil
Hall or the First National Bank where there were
posted the check in the First National Bank and told
Paige of it, he replied that is all right gave check
from x J. s. Bunting to Paige when gave him the
Mitchell check; this check received advance
on goods consigned in my own name on the 9th OF

National Bank the 3oth of August; received other
checks from Grotzan Mitchell 4 Co.. and

lyn Mason.",,"Few men have SO thrilling an ex-
perience as Philip Lynch and Joseph
Pendergrass. The former was blown
from high brick chimney at Hunters
Point, N. Y, during recent storm.
The latter had an almost miraculous
escape. The chimney was one hum
dred and fifteen feet high, and the two
men were on scaffolding, Pender-
grass on the upper tier and Lynch be-
low him. The wind struck the chin
ney with terrific force, and the first
scafolding began to sway back and
forth, cracking and straining.. PEN
dergrass, seeing the danger, hugged
the brick work of the chimney. As
the storm swayed the scafolding from
it's fastenings, Lynch was either unable
to obtain a secure hold on the CHM
ney or too much confused to make the
attempt. Suddenly the upper part of
the scafold gave way with a crash,
and was hurled to the ground, a
tangled mass of poles, p1anks and
splinters. Lynch fell with the scaffold,
while Pendergrass, with desperate
effort, sprang upon the top of the
chimney, and was left hanging on the
narrow edge of brick, one hundred and
fifteen feet from the ground. Lynch's
mangled body was picked up by some
of his fellow workmen, and carried to
the office of the company. He was
not yet dead, but lived for three hours.
Pendergrass, in the meantime, re-
mained clinging to the top of the
chimney, while the storm swirled
oh him oo0~oSrNe IN +1~oofo,, tho
overthrow of the structure. He sue
ceeded in finding partial protection
from the hurricane by crouching on
some pieces of planks that had been
placed inside the mouth of the Chin
ney to aid in its erection. He
says that when he felt the
scaffolding giving way under him
and sprang for the chimney cap he
called to Lynch to follow him. Lynch
made desperate effort TO gain the top
of the structure, but lost his footing and
tumbled headlong to the bottom. strik-
ing in his descent every tier of the
lower portion of the scatfolding which
did not fall. But another danger beset
Pendergrass. A fire had been few
minutes before started in the furnace

the new chimney. The smoke and
gases from this fire had begun to pour
up through the chimney, and they al
most smothered Pendergrass, who
dared not quit the place where he
crouched, from fear of being blown
from the chimney-top by the gale that
howled over his head with in
creasing violence, while the fumes
from the chimney almest took away
his breath. II saw my DANGER"" said
Pendergrass, and gave up all hope of
being rescued. But just then saw
some men below me doing all they
could do to relieve me, and my heart
bounded with hope"" These were some
sailors whose names could not be ascer-
tanned. They courageously volunteered
to climb the chimney, and clambering
up the frail poles and planks that re-
manned clinging to one side of it, they
succeeded in rescuing Pendergrass,
who, his nervous system having under
gone terrible strain, tainted in the
arms of his resouers. He suffered
somewhat from inhaling gas and smoke,
but is recovering."

One more Illicit whiskey distillery raided yes
terday morning by the officers of this city,
and the parties not only in destroy
ing the apparatus but in making the arrest of five
persons. all that supposed to belong to tho
place. The double frame building at Nos. 2,2O5 and
2.207 Second avenue. near the corner of 18th
street. attracted suspicion, and Friday evening
it was determined to search the place.
and at half-past two yesterday morning Revenue
Agents McLeer. Rainey, stinson. Coleman and Dep
uty Collector Van Wyck, made descent upon the
building. The suspicion proved correct. for the
cellar still found in full operation Upon the
second floor the officers found Daniel Sullivan alias
Daniel J. Nagle and Charles Williams, still in their
working clothes. and put them under arrest Upon
an examination of the building in little store
back of the grocery store the ofi-
GERS found nine barrels of rum. and in
adjoining room about two and half
tierces more OF the same article, in all about 400
gallons. The still seized was OF copper and copper
connections and or about $50 gallons capacity.
There six mash tubs containing about 5000
gallons of molasses mash. The still and connections
pulled down. and the mash run into the sewer.
The entire property then placed in the hands of
Deputy Collector Weber, of the Third district. 1t
was evident that the grocery store only used to
cover the work in the basement, and early in the
morning, when Michael Lynch, one of the owners,
opened the store he was arrested. A short time
alter Timothy Clements, employe, drove
up with load OF molasses, and was also
taken into custody. Later III the morning
Daniel j. sullivan, another of tho proprietors
arrested at his other place OF business, No. ""a James
street. The prisoners were all brought before
United States Commissioners Deuel. and charged with
carrying on distillery without license Nagle
Williams. sullivan and Lynch, as principals were
sent to Ludlow Street Jail in default OF $4,000 bail
cach and Clements, as all empoye, was held III
$1,000. The novelty in this seizure was the
mode of receiving and removing the material
and spirits. over week the place was
continually watched by Deputy St1nsOn, but
nothing seen to 90 in or leave the place. except
numerous barrels, apparently filled with potatoes or
vegetables common to the grocery. In making the
seizure the mystery was explained. The vegetable
barrels to go to and fro were tin lined and
swered every purpose OF the ordinary heavy spirit
barrel. The nine barrels seized OF this descrp

store OF Sullivan, i'll James street, when lac

Montgomery Blair goes even further ana asserts as
fact that negro suffrage existed, that it
been only an expensive process of registration and
supervision by the military to have pieces of
paper put in the hands Of the colored voters
to be deposited as the white men sent down
to combine and lead them should direct. And
SO after complmenting Hampton the type
of class to whom the negro naturally

declares that it would be reasonable expect the

been some foundation for Hamptons assertion in
the first instance but Blairs talk is all nonsense It
would be source OF astonshment to any impair

'Is it not reasonable to suppose that some reason
would be assigned for such vast disaiecton of the

energy. ""Just there is the milk in the cocoanut.
The southern people deny that they persecute and
intimidate republicans aud prevent them from vot-

pistols to be heard all night long, Is 1t surpris-

fatally. He was disarmed, and at the
same meeting a few hours afterwards
he was attacked by three brothers named
Lynch, who shot him down with pistols,
giving him four serious wounds. He
was in the Cusllatota roit, and then went
with his family to Texas, residing alter
nately in Hays, Liano an Mcclellan
counties, until 1877 when he returned to
Sabine parish and was there convicted
in the fall of 1877 for seriously beating a
woman who he says was OF bad char


acter and had grossly insulted his wife.
For this offence he was convicted and
sentenced to four years in the peniten


tiary, but with outside assistance, broke
the Sabine Jail and went to Catahoula
parish. From there, in April, 1878 he
went to the residence Of his cousin
Avner Washington Ford in Calcasieu
parish, on the Sabine river.


There he found DR.. Joseph Bazee, a
wandering root and herb doctor, camred
in front of Wash. Fortl's house. He
says that Bazee acknowledged to him he
had been leading a criminal career for
years, and tried to induce him to joiu

Wash. Ford, and the prisoners cousin,
and was jealous Of AhsaIom W. Ford.


In May 1878 the prisoner went to
Texas but returned eleven days after

plainly told Wash. Ford he would take
his daughter Ellen to the Indian Terri
TORY, and that if she would not go vol
unfairly he would make her go with
him, at the same time saying Absalom
was gone and il he came back he would
kill him. The prisoner said he was i'll
formed of these threats by Wash. Ford,
Ellen Ford, Mrs. Pool, and others, i'm
nediately after his return to Wash.
Frod's, and that he then determined to
hill Bazee the first time the latter ever
made any hostile demonstration towards
him. He denied having sent Heeman
Mcclure (his fellow convict, whose sem
tence of death was cOmmute0 to i'm
prisonment for life to decoy DR.. Bazee
to Mrs. POOLS in order that he might kill
him there, and says his confession and
Heeman McClule's to that effect, on
their preliminary examination before
our Parish Judge, near the scene of the
homicide, on the Sabine river was not
true, and was made only because he,
aud Mcclure were convinced that if
they did not say something which would
cause their commitment to jail the citi-

he and Heeman Mcclure made the same
explanation of those confessions just
after they were confined in Jail here, to
an attorney at law residing here. He
said Heeman Mcclure told him that be
went to DIR. BaZees' camp OH the morning
of the homicide to get some medicine for
his sister Mrs. Pool, which the DR.. had
the day before requested Mrs. Pool to
send for. and that on BaZee learning
from Mcclure that AbsaIom W. F6rd
was at Mrs. Pools he insisted on taking
the medicine there himself, saying in
reply to McClure's assurances that he
better not go, as Absal0m W. Ford was
armed, and had been informed of RaZee's
threats, that he wanted to see Ford. He
said that Mcclure was going to Wash.
FOrd's, to return borrowed horse, when
lie (the prisoner) shot Bazee. He said
that Bazee was advancing on him, with
his hand on his knife, and cursing him,
when he shot him, after twice warning
Bazee to stand back. Z


He said that he made this statement
fully realizing fiat he must die next
day that he had no npkind feeling to-
ward any one; that be was prepared to
die, and only regretted leaving. lis wife
and young children unprepared fer.


He eat supper Thursday night as
usual. and at midnight fell asleep, and
was asleep yesterday morning till just
after sunrise. He cat only a piece of
bread and drank cup OF coffee for his
breakfast yesterday l2ornlng. At noon
we visited him again and told him bis
recently written to our Parish Judge,
earnestly requesting the latter to induce
Ford if possible to make dying COP

He replied he had made true confess
sion to us Thursday night, and that he
could make no other.

Ho,U T,co Negro Matetuctors Net Their


Death.",,"HoU T,co Negro Motctuctors Met Their


Death.


A correspondent telegraphed several days
ago, on authority that was considered re-
liable at Starkville, Miss, that negro de-
tected in the act of stealing corn and subse-
quently in setting fire to the barn and out
houses of his employer, had been caught,
forced to confession before a committee
composed equally of white and black citi-
zens, and was by them hanged to limb.
Subsequent dispatches, however, showed
that the informant had anticipated
the event, which eliminated yester-
day more fearfully than was at first
lynched, but was imprisoned, as were also
several others whom he implicated in his
confession. Yesterday, however, the follow
ing startling information was received by
telegraph from Starkville, this time from re-
liable sources ""Our usually quiet little city
has been in commotion for some days. Il
will be remembered that only few days ago
special telegram from this place stated that
Mr.. Jordan Moore, a planter living few
miles south of here, had been shot at by un-
known parties, that two large barns and a
corn crib, with their contents, had been
burned by incendiaries; that tie guilty
parties had been arrested, and one Of
whom, Devlin Porter, confessed his guilt
and criminated johnson Spencer as an ac-
cessory. They were tried before an in
| vestigating court, and bonnd over to await
the action of the circuit court; being in de-
fault of bail, they we're iucarcerated in the
county jail. Much has been said about
lynching, the anticipation running so high
that it was even reported executed before
the accused had a hearing. Their guilt was
manifestly accepted, though it was generally
hoped that the laws of the land should
be Mr.. Moore's avenger. At about
midnight Saturday body of men, 121
strong, both black and white, masked and
armed, rode into town, and to the residence
of Sheriff Peter Quinn, of whom the keys
to the jail were demanded and received
| They then went to the Jail, confined the jail
/ er. Henry Isaacs, in cell, and took Devlin
1 Porter and johnson Spencer, who were max.
ing agonizing appeals for life, strapped them
to horses and left The dead bodies Of the
two prisoners were subsequently found
dangling from the cross-ties of trestle 8
short distance from town."""

Mr.. McGlinchey offered resolution,

Mr.. Taylor desired to know what the
object OF the resolution was.


Mr.. McGlncney said that the object
was to stop the chickering's of the citi.
zens. There had been persons who bid
Tor work, aud because they did not get
1t thought they were cheated, and that
the bids had been tampered with. This
he thought would stop IL, as the bidder
could walk in and deposit his bid in the
box, and see that it was not handled until

After some farther remarks, Mr. Lynch
moved that the matter be indefinitely
postponed.


The motion was lost by the following

stated that perhaps it would be better for
him to explain before he voted. A few

ell chamber he was accosted by gentle
IN an, who stated that he had put in a
bid, but was afraid it had been tamper-
ed with. He informed one of the mem
bers OF Council what the gentleman had
told him, .and advised the member of
Council to have all the bids rejected II
possible. The bids were rejected and
new ones asked for. He believed the
resolution was good one and would
vote..aye.


Mr.. Norton gave notice that he would,
at some future meeting OF Council, in
troduce an ordinance in regard TO selling
meat on the streets.


He also gave notice that the Printing
Committee would pay no more bills, un-
less the work was ordered done by them.

Mr.. Payn,er asked for information.
At the last meeting of Council The Lamp
Committee reported favorable on num-
ber of new lamps, the estimates for
which were 80 each. There is resolu-
tion on the books that all lamps placed
on highways where there are gas mains
are to be connected with said main, and
all oil lamps on said main are to be re-
placed by gas lamps. If the committee
can put up a gas lamp for 50, why then
let them go ahead


Mr.. Heusted stated in reply that none
of the lamps ordered had been put up

luton existed. Allthe lamps asked for
with two exceptions were on the out

the following protest:


i To THE PRESIDENT AND MEMBRRs OF THE
CITY Council We the undersigned, mem.
berB OF the City Council desiring TO place our.
selves upon record In reference to the late
action OF Council In the matter Of the election
of the Street Commissioner on the evening OF
July 7th, 70, In which eleven members aided
In open and gross violation of rule IA, which
says: every member who is present when
""a question Is stated from the chair shall vote
thereon, unless excused by vote of two
thirds OF the members present, or unless he be
directly interested In the question In which
lease he shall not yote,"" allowing Mr.. Louis
p. Lynch a candidate for the efiice OF Street
Commissioner, and member OF council frsm
the Tenth Ward, to cast ballot, and we are
forced to the conclusion by all the circum-
stances surrounding the same. that his vote
secured his election and In order that there
shall be no misunderstanding about the At
ter or loop-hole for violators of law to escape
the responsibility Of their acts but to fix the
matter and place the odium and disgrace
where IT belongs, setting the law and time
h0n0red usage at defiance. We hereby testi-
ty that We voted on the final ballot a. follows:
For Francis McCloskey, Paynter and Hart;
| lor E. H. HOagland, Adams, Downing, Jones,
Price, Chandler, Evans. Wood and Licnten,
stein, making ten votes In all and as there
| were twenty ne votes cast we are forced to
the conclusion that Mr.. L. p Lynch voted or
him self and other members who sustaine
him In the vote are responsible for the
trampling Of rule IA under foot and having
the office OF Street Commissioner illegally
filled as at present In this matter we earnest
~ protest against the violation of the rule and
respectfully sugget that the rules are the
laws governing this body until they are pro.
perly amended or repealed, and as they were
adopted with calm deliberation, so they
should he repealel or amended, not ruth less
ly or violently set as de, as Of nOn-efieet
(wRen IL meets our convenience) In the heat
OF aSsionate debate, or 10 advance partizan
measures where they interfere, or for the pur-
pose o' advancing any person or persons am
bition or aggrandizement,,b but should be Ii o 4
up to until they are amended or repealed In
accordance 10 rule 3. which re DIS as follows
These rules may be temporarily suspended
""by unanimous consent, but shall not be re-
pea ed, altered or amended unless proposed
in writing two stated meetings before adop- |
""tion, and by Concurrence OF two-thirds of
""the members of Council"" Because we |
firmly believe that If rule II Is null and void,
and OF non effect and thus Council has not |
power to regulate and carry into effect its or
dinances and rules (which we believe 1t has)
We have no rules or ordinances that can be |
enforced, anarchy and confusion would reign
In our midst. For these reasons we enter our
solemn protest to the action herein stated.

the language with which it is disre-
spectfully clothed, | recognize the mi
nority's right to protest; it is their
privilege. remember being in this
council when We on this side of the
house were in the minority, there be-
ing seven of US. We protested against
a measure but we did it in respectful
language. But in this case the Ian.
guage is very, very disres pectful, and
such that should not be used to brother
members. The protest says, ""cast the
Odium and disgrace where it belongs""
There was no disgrace attached to Mr..
Lynch's election, nor is there any
Ddium. He was elected according to
rules, and therefore |
shall vote against accepting tie 'ro-
lest unless the language be changed.
AT the request of Mr.. McGlinchey the
protest was again read.
Mr.. Price said he had no objections to ,
altering the protest so as to remove the
offensive language. He had no inten- I
ion to hurt any ones feeling in the t
natter. ,
81 contend,' he continued there is ,
10 distinction between rules and ordi- ,
lances. We prescribe rules to govern
'ur actions, and We make laws to gov
'rn the people outside. 1t seems to me !
hat there are some who think that the i,
ules are simply there to be set aside at !,
will. 1t is not so. They must be lived =
lp to. The same body passes the rules /;
s we'll as the ordinances, and if we
annot carry out our own rules we Ger. :,
ainly cannot expect the people to carry !
ut the ordinances. =
Mr.. Norton: Desperate cases require :,
rsperate remedies 1t is a desperate a
lternative ard l do not wonder at the ""
entlemen from tho other side protest !,
ng. They lost fine opportunity. u
hey feel very sore over it. But am VI

Mr.. Guthrie: 1t strikes me unfavora- ~

resolved that the election declared nu

Mr.. McGlinchey thought as there wal

Mr.. McGlinchey thought the whole
proceedings out Of order, and suggested
it bs laid over one week 30 that the pro-
test might be printed.


The protest was again read, and Mr..
Walton's motion was voted down by a
tie vote.


Mr.. Adams informed the Council that
he didn't sign the protest with an idea
of removing Mr.. Lynch in case OF Re-
publican success in September.


Mr.. McGlinchsy opposed the aaop-
tian of the protest and wished to know
why there should be- so much trouble
over an action which was merely one
based upon precedent establishment
by the other side as in the case of Mr..
1eorgs H. Walter. The action of
Council in this matter was perfectly
egal.


The protest was then accepted and
ordered to be placed upon the minutes.


The Street Committee reported in ia
Tor of confirming the award OF the COM

was entirely too high. After a short
discussion the report was lost.

BALTIMORE, April IA special to the
american says: When the train which
left Washington with James Carroll, the
negro accused OF outragi ng NJ RS. Thomas,
at Lisksville, Nd, on Monday last,
reached Washington junction to-day,
fifteen or twenty masked mon boarded
the train and, after a desperate struggle,
succeeded in overcoming the policemen.
The prisoner was dragged from the trai /,
n rope was thrown over his head and he
was pulled across a field, about one hun
dred yards, TO the nearest tree and hang
ed. The whole proceeding occupied but
thirty minutes, the maskers riding silent
ly away after Carroll had been pro-
nouncsd dead.


Carroll was asked IL he had anything to
say, and he ans wered that he was guilty,
but that he wanted to be tried In court
house. According TO late reports from
Point OF Rocks the body was still dang.
ling in the air irsuspcnded from the limb OF

have expired. Carroll was more than

Allie Post Wins the Twenty-six-


Hour Contest.



Post Again Triumphant.",,"Tho twenty-six-hour pedestrian contest at
Odd-Fellows Hall closed at $3.50 o'clock Sltur.
day night, Post then being the only contestant
on the track. Hodgson retired from the track
at 2;3O p. M, at the end of his forty.sc venth
mile. few minutes later Heron, who was
the favorite among the b, ting men, withdrew,
his score then standing ffty-ihree miles. At
S30p. M. Douglass aud Crawford retired from
the track, the former having completed eighty
seven and the latter cighty-hvo miles. Post
and salisbury were then the only con-
testauts left, aud us the former had
n lead of five miles, there was no
doubt MS to the termination of tho race
At o'clock Salisbury completed 100 miles
and retired from the track. Post, who then
had 1O5 miles to his credit, logged on for an
other half an hour aud completed hi 10Sth milo
before leaving the track. Post received many
presents OF flowers during the evening While
making his last mile he was presented with
two large hOrsc-shocs made OF flowers, by Mr.
Andrew Smith, in behalf of the om-
ployees of tho Government Printing
office. Before Salisbury left the track,
Post performed very graceful act. A beau
tiful basket of flowers was given to
Post, and ovcrtakimg Salisbury, lie presented
the basket to his plucky adversary. After the
match Post congratulated salisbury on the
good fight he had made, aud announced his
ihNSuNiuu ItNlIlnR lTOul Jilb
arena Referee Lynch, in announcing the re.
suit of the contest, Informed thcs3ectators that
lie could easily have made ll0 miles, but by so
doing, under the rules of the contest, he would
have prevented all his competitors from shar-


ing in the receipts.


An interesting incident in connection with
the match was tho performance of ""Baby
Mine"" by the band, with particular reference
to an event which occurred at Posts house
while lie was on the track. Hodgsou has
challenged Post to another contest within
sixty days, but it is not probable Post will &C.
ccpt. BY an arrangement between themselves
Crawford and Douglass will divide the third
money. Post has been severely criticised by
sporting men for leaving the track when
lie did, as mauy bets were made that he
would make 110 miles. Posts motives were
OF the most magnanimous nature as he de-
sired to remove the sting of defeat by letting
his adversaries share with him the proceeds of
the match. Post was in good condition yes
terday, aud walked down town last evening
Heron, who WAS very sick whom he left the
track, has recovered"

first row, met at the corner of II
and North Capitol streets yesterday afternoon
to discuss the merits Of the men locked up.
They began to warm up with the discussion,
and finally started a fight on their own ac-
count. Officer Fisher iu attempting to arrest
the ringleader, one Thomas Droncy, was sot
upon by the entire party, who attempted TO
rescue the prisoner. The officer blew for
assistance, and Lieutenant Austin, accompanied
by squad Of officers, quickly responded. The
crowd scattered, but the following we're not
fast enough to get away: Michael Lynch,
Samuel Ward and Michel Herring. Fisher,
meanwhile, had quieted his man and took lhin
to the station. The balance Of the rioters were
soon accommodated with quarters, and Judge
Smell will have good crowd to start on to-

that where Mr.. Browns contract ends
the bottom Of the sever at Second street

fifteen inches lower than the bottom Of
the old sewer below it, and the excre-

that the appropriation for sewers is en-

 | think that earth, revolving on it's axis, must have stuck fast in some position, and l that part of the ocean split ever for the last 1 few days, because it is rather of wet spell of weather at this place. It reminds me of a protraced meeting held in the Empire State The minister gave notice one evening that as it was ill the season of the equinoctial storm, they would postpone for a week. One old lady afterwards in telling her experience, ended by | hoping that all the converts would prove faithful until the equivalent storm was over. Now, if this last stolm is not equivalent to any storm that we have had for some time, then I'll give in. It is quite contrast to the August weather we generally have. Now a 1 fire in the house and winter ulster out of doors does not feel uncomfortable It is gen. erally le hottest month in this season of the year, when all nature seems sunk in lassitudc and repose, and an universal silence reigns even deep as that which waits upon the moou at night. It is then we fly to woods to waters and to caves, whose coolness breathes delicious balm through every nerve and disposes the mind to the enjoyment of the scenery itself, which secludes us from the blaze of day, as well as to the indulgence of those trains of thought which spring from and l tion. Animals are oppressed with universal languor, and either wend their way to pools of water, the coverts of the forest or any place | that will shade them from the almost vertical sun. But this is not the news of the past week, so will return to that subject thusly

 The dance at the grove on Tuesday last was grand affair, and largely attended The music was beautiful, furnished by our own talent. It made me, al old man, almost wish l were young again.

Holley celebrated his 75th birth day on Tuesday last. There was large party at his house n honor of the event. Hon. F. Miles, M. C., was one of the guests.

Considerable i'll feeling between
General Sherman and a prominent
War Department official has been
engendered in consequence of the
activity shown by the former to in
duce Congress to pass q new army
bill. The War Department official
believes that General Sherman ex-
ceeds the bounds of propriety and
shows a want of proper respect to
| those officials whose connection
with the army is purely civil, by
| resorting to extraordinary methods
to influence Congress. 1t is freely
charged that General Sherman has
given out the false impression that
army officers are nearly an unit on
the question of passing the new
bill. The recent revocation of an
old order, which forbids any officer
from seeking to influence legisla-
tion, was done at the instance of
Secretary McCrary, who was led to
believe that If this order was an
nulled, army officers stationed
away from Washington would feel
free to write their objections to the
pending bill. Some persons be-
lieve the present bill will result in
an open rupture between General
Sherman and Secretary McCrary,
who, as the head of the civil branch
of the service, is superior in author
ity to General Sherman.

| OMAHA, Jan. 6.-The suspected
murderers of Mitchell and Ketch-
um, who were recently tied to II
tree and burned to death, in Custer
county, Nebraska, were arrested at
Plum creek yesterday by party of
citizens who, concealed themselves
In the postOffice, and when the sus.
pscted parties came in to get their
mail, surprised and captured them.
j. p. Olive, an extensive cattle
man and seven Of his cattle herders
were thus captured. 1t will be re-
member that Olives brother, whose
alias was Stephens, was killed in
an encounter with Miller and
Ketchum, who had been attacked
by Stephens and his party. Ketch-
um was wounded and the killing of
Stephens was done in self defense.
The burning of Mitchell and Ketch-
um was done to avenge Stephens
death and was without much doubt
done by olives herders. Among
those who assisted in arresting
these desperadoes were three
brothers of the dead Kethum and a
step-son of Mitchell. Olive and his
men were taken to Kearney last
night and lodged in Jail.

municaton with Minister Welsh since Friday last III
regard to report circulated in Great Britain Of the
prevalence of pleuro- -pneumonia among cattle in
the United States. 1t appears that the British
government has been apprehensive for some
time past of the introduction OF cattle disease into
England through imported cattle. Recently tee-
grams were sent by British Consuls in the United
States to their home government pretending that
pleuro-pneumonia prevalent here among cattle,
and upon the receipt of these kilograms the British
Minister. Sir Edward Thornton, advised to OBJ
tain the most reliable data upon the subject At the
same time Minister in London, Mr.. Welsh, was
informed Of the apprehension Of the British govern
ment and promptly informed Mr.. Evarts of the effort
being made to interdict the importation OF American
cattle.


RESULTS OF INVESTIGATION.


Upon the receipt Of this information the Secretary
Of State caused inquiry to be made to the actual con-
dition of things and he found no just ground for
pectng that cattle infected with contagious
disease and became satisfied that there nothing
whatever affecting our domestic or foreign trade in cat
te All that the Secretary of State could find that
and about Brooklyn cattle fed distillery slops
were subject to lung disease because the animals
deprived Of fresh air and at the same time were
fed on hot slops which made them weak. As these
cattle sold and do not come into contact
with the cattle exported it was not possible to at
tribute disease to this source.


On further inquiry the Secretary of State found
that it was reported that some cows in the neigh

the United States and the disease they have is not
known to be infectious there does not appear to be
any cause for ALARM


possIprIITy or INrERprcrISt; AMERICAN CATTLE


Nevertheless the Secretary Of State is not certain
that without just ground for suspicion the British
government may interdict trade in American cattle.
He understood the Canadian government had already
commenced such prohibition. All We could do
reports upon which such orders were based,
and If few American cattle were found
| OF two weeks IL would be more than had hap
pencd before since the cattle trade commenced. The
cause for alarm lies not in any apprehension Of the
introduction OF infectious disease among the cattle
Of England. but TO protect waning industry among
| the proprietors Of landed estates.


OFFICIAL DENIAL.


The Commissioner of Agriculture officially denies
the existence Of pcuro-pneumonia among cattle. cx
cept in few isolated places, as at Williamsburg and
lists in a mild form only and has been prevalent for
some months. 1t has engaged his attention as the
duties OF his Office require.


OF CANADIAN OFFICIAL.
Several weeks ago the veterinary surgeon of the
Agricultural Department OF the Canadian govern
ment visited the suspected localities and also
went into Virginia with the view Of
certaining if the disease infected the cattle
called upon the Commissioner OF Agriculture
and informed him that he believed that the disease
did prevail among cattle in the neighborhood OF
Lynchburg but that it did not appear to be extend
ing. The Commissioner adds that he has under
sidcration bill to be submitted to the
the determination of the complaint in
its present situations. But he has no
along any of the routes where cattle herded in
any places whence they exported. and he looks
upon the apprehension Of the British authorities at
DISEASE AMONG cows ONLY.


None of the cattle in the suspected localities
williamsburg brought INTO contact with cx-
norted cattle and the disease so far is fonnd
only among cows kept for domestic use and for sup
plying milk to the city markets: He does not think
it is likely to spread westward; but, out of abun-
dance of caution, Congress will be asked to make
such provision as will enable the Commissioner OF
Agriculture to stamp it out promptly wherever it
may be found.

MONTREAL, Feb. 3, 1870.


The cattle plague is the leading topic among busi-
ness men here and there has been growing trade
in that line with English ports much anxiety was
the result of the first kilograms announcing the pro-
hibition Of the shipment to the British Islands
of Canadian and American cattle The feel
ing amounted almost to panic on Fri
day AMI Saturday last; but a better feel
ing exists to-day. a number of private cable de-
spatches having been received by the leading firms
here announcing the passage Of Canadian cattle with
out much interference. Thus the prices. which fell
so low on Thursday last. have advanced to twenty
cents above those asked ten days ago. and two car
loads which sold to-day went at higher prices
than have been realized for two months.


CHARACTER AND ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE.


The disease has been but little noticed here. and
Dr. McEachran. of the Veterinary College, thinks
there can be no difficulty about the passage of Cana
dian CATTLE while those from'thc United States will be
excluded. He states the malady to be really plcuro-
pneumonia which has heretofore been well known"

Especial to the Cincinnati Enquirer.


ST. LOUIS, August 30.-Sheriff White
hill of Grant County, New Mexico, is in
St. Louis, EN- route for indianapolis,
whittier he is taking bright 9-year-old
boy, named Josie Granger. The lad is
the henephew of Bishop Granger rof Indian
apolis, and the Sheriff is confident that
the boys father, who was the Bishops
brother, was murdered at the inStiga-
ton of none other than Kate Bender,
who six years ago was the most odiouS
woman in the United States. itwill re-
quire no effort on the part of the reader
to call to mind the Bender family, who
for several years kept human Slaugh-
ter-houSe in the shape of a little hostel
RE on lonely Kansas road, about 6O
miles from Fort Scott. The tracing OF
prominent citizen named York to their
house, and the discovery of his murder,
led to revelations of the most horrifying
character, and the grizzly old murderer
with his inhuman family fled in great
haste from the wrath which must follow
the discovery of the graveyard which
they had made all around their house.
Whether they were overtak ken
and all lynched, or whether they
really escaped and scattered, has al
ways been an open question. The most
fendish member of the family was Kate,
then a stout young woman, whose thews
had grown great in welding the ham
mer that crushed travellers skulls. The
story which the Sheriff of Grant County
tells has reference to Kate. He says
that William F. Granger, the father OF
the boy now in his charge, married a
wife in California, and when she died
moved with his son William, weak
minded, cruel sort of boy, to Fort
Smith, Ark. A second marriage took
place there, and Josie was the issue.
He took into his family as nurse and
servant young woman who had been
domestic in a hotel, and who went by
the name of Dora Hesser. The family
moved to Grant County, New Mexico,
and Dora went along. The second wife
died, and on the 10Th of last September
Granger married Dora. Just three
weeks after that he was enticed into the
mountains by his own son, William, and
a man named Parson Young, and the
boy fired a bullet from a needle-gun
through the old mans brain. They dug
hole, iammed the body into heap
and threw it in, then covered it up and
stamped the ground level. Going back
home they divided the old mans pos


sessions, amounting to about $4,000.
Young taking one-third, William one
third and the bride of three
weeks one-third. The authorities sus-
pected something wrong, and Sheriff
went to the Granger house to arrest the
trio. He found them all in bed together,
and hidden under the bed were the old
mans gray clothes, which Dora had
chopped into pieces. William was
closely questioned and finally acknowl-
edged that his mother and Parson Young
had fixed up the job on the old man and
induced him to do the killing, the object
being one of plunder. He led the Off
GERS to the scene of the murder, and the
body was exhumed Since then the be-
lief has been growing that Dora Is Kate
Bender She acknowledges that her
name is Kate, and she knows deal
about the Benders. A young man who
went to school with Kate Bender when
she was about 16 years old visited Dora
in jail, and positively identified her as
Kate. In her trunk was found about
$500 worth of silverware, most of it
marked ""Galt House, Kentucky"" The
Sheriff has her picture, and it represents
a woman about 80 years old, with full; 1;
heavy face, large lower jaw, very small
eyes, and a mouth of q virago. The
woman is still in jail, and will soon be
tried. Meanwhile, the Sheriff intends
to give the little boy Josie, who is very
amiable, intelligent, and who gives
graphic account of the murder, in charge"

for liberty. PEBBLES fred, but missed
Martin shot, taking effect in the arm Of
Peter Martins child. Knox Martin then
fell to the ground, pretending that he was
shot, and was easily captured.


He was taken to the workhouse. followed
by large and increasing crowd. Lynchine
was freely talked of, and in less than half al

county jail. Gov. Marks and Sheriff Price

IN case of an effort at Jail delivery. It is
understood that Martin was later removed to
some secret place.


While at the workhouse and jail Martin
converseed ed freely with q number of persons,
coolly confessing and giving all the bloody
details of the crime. He said he had been
told by his Aunt: Mary, All old negro woma,
of the neighborhood, who was feared by

fire and watched it until it was. burned to
ashes. He then washed his hands and

only SO cents, taking it and Whittemeyer's

Martin is tall, heavy-built negro %
years old, and with, rather good natured
face. He is very ignorant, and say he is
now sorry for the crime, but appears not to

Later ill the night some one drag ged the dash -board and what hung to- l gcther of the sleigh to the road and left l it intending perhaps to cause mischief by | frightning horses.

 .'CAMP ON MILK CREEK, CoLORADo,l

 October, Eth, 1879. !.

 We received our orders at S. a. m. and by II, a. m. were ready to start, but the train was delayed and we did not get off until 8, D. m, reaching Rawlins at midnight three com panies of us. There we found Gen'l Merritt with four companies of the 5th Cavalry and Maj Bryant with four of the 14th Infantry. Companies from Fetterman, Laramie Mo Pherson and Omaha were on the road, but had not arrived when we left, at 10 next morning. Our march was constant rush without rest or comfort. The first day we reached camp at midnight, were up at five, travelled all day and reached camp after midnight. The next day up at five, travelled, with but one stop for dinner, all that day. and all that night, until z, a. m., next day. never, never was so tired in my life, believe Every one was perfect ly worn out; still in all the command there was not a word of grumbling or complaint for no one knew but that at that moment every man of Thornburg's command might be dead or that every minute gained might be life saved. The Infantry rode in wagons and whenever hill was reached would jump out and shove the wagons. As fast as an animal gave out he was taken out of saddle or har. ness and left by the road side. The first camr we reached was Prices, which he had fortifi ed. He had only twenty five men.

 ""From there to Thornburg's was seventy five miles. which we made in the next twenty four hours, reaching here just after daybreak AS we reached it the Cavalry (ahead with it headquarters flag flying and were challenged and answered, a more delighted lot of men i would be impossible to find, except in a part, who had been besieged for week with death staring them in the face every hour. Some cried, others embraced General Merritt and his party, and all testified in their way their joy al their deliverance. To see them was sufi c'ent reward for our long and trying march.

lamp around a hugh stove a group Of
men, wearing the blue and gold of Uncle
Sans livery; very shabby the blue, very
tarnished the gold, after the long sum-
mer campaign on the dusty prairies and
the grimy Bad Lands. AS the fierce wind
howled around the little log cabin. driv-
ing the snow through the loose window
frames until it lay in miniature embank-
ments on the floor, the little company
drew still closer to the friendly stove, and
one and another told his tale of past ad-
venture and stress of circumstance, until
the old doctor, whose gray HAIR might
have earned for him some more cheerful
home than a frontier outpost in which to
pass his evidently hale old age, said in
his slow, quiet way:

the old doctor, an odd melancholy sort
of feeling came over me, and you'll own

to fill up the stove with wood and 'be
quick about it, a fitting back Of wooden
chairs to miraculous angles, expressed
the approva! Of the company, and, draw
inga long whit from his pipe, the doctor
began:


up at Camp r., not many years ago,
there was a soldier who excited consider
able curiosity among the officers and men
by his queer ways. Most Of you know
how it is IN these little rat-holes where
troops arc housed for the winter, shut
up like bears in u pit, with nothing to do
but look at each other, till spring starts
them off on the war-path again. Each
persons peculiarities undergo search
ing analysis, and any one who refuses at

zie Bailey were elected Secretaries.
Dr.. Purnell gave a few interesting
remarks on reading; he invoked them
TO use their own tone, criticised the
use OF affected styles, styling it ""ssw-
ing the air."" The minister in the pull
pit, the lawyer in the court, gain more
and cause greater expression by plain
style.


Samuel F. Adams in charge of the

finding the apparatus he said that it
showed the prominent feature of a
country by having figure represent
ing the shape, size, etc. Of it, and
emersipg it sufficiently in water TO show
the country in as real state as possi-
BILE. He claims to show the subject up
more clearly TO beginners.


J. ?. Rothwell of St. Georges gave an
interesting exercise with a class of his
pupils ard several Of the teachers.


Miss Lizzie D. Hooks on History, tells
that it improves the condition uf our
country and makes better men and
should promote love for peace and
liberty and all that make true citi-
zen. 1t furnishes ample material for
reflection, widens our range Of thought
and ideas and draws evident conclu-
sions, proving that the acme of our am
bition should be to advance as rapidly
as possible to peace and prosperity.
That mine of wealth lays locked up
in the pages of History. The whole
showed a careful study of the subject
and was delivered with an eloquence
which is attractive to all hearers. Ex-
ecutive Committee report Constitution
and bylaws prepared to be acted on to-
morrow

ing them in the cells. VIM. Yoakum WAS
chained to the floor of his cell. and as the chain
could not be loosened he was hung with the
chain on his feet. He was shot several times
after hanging him. The Yoakums were in Jail
for the killing Of johnson and Tucker at Long
Tom more than year ago. VIM. Yoakum had
his trial and was convicted of murder in the

twenty five miles from Cincinnati, is in a
state of excitement over picturesque lynch
ing which took place about 3 o'clock this
The affair grew out of an elope-
ment. On Sunday night last Mrs. Charles
industrious farmer of Clermont county, left
liam Story, who had relatives in the neigh
some time, ostensibly to visit them, but
really to pay court to the young wife, who
had been former sweetheart of his. The
lovers had beel having frequent meetings
in the very presence of the patient husband,
until at last there was an explosion,
followed by the flight of
the pair westward. They were intercepted
at Cincinnati by atelegram sent to the police
there's were returned to Clermont county,
where Story, alias Allen, was held in custody
at Batavia. The people of the region where
the elopement had occurred, locally known
as sHell's Half-Acre,'' determined that an
example should be made of Story as warn
ing to the city chaps. At 8 o'clock this
morning about seventy-fye of them came to
Batavia, entered the Munson house, and de-
manded the prisoner at the hands of the Of
fcer who was guarding him. Story, who is
strong and courageous fellow, offered to
fight any five of them in fair field. but
when the rope was fastened about his neck
he surrendered, and begged for his life.
They hustled him down stairs, and dragged
him, with rope around his neck, and his
| arms pinioned behind, along the street a
square and half to the new iron bridge


over the Little Miami river. In going to


the bridge Story unfastened:his hands, tied
4 behind, but kept them in their place as


hough tied, to help himself if nee essary.
4 The regulators then threw him over the


bridge with the rope about his neck, but the
rope either broke or slipped over his
head, and the man fell forty feet into


the stream below. The water at the point


where he fell did not exceed a foot in


depth, and the mob, supposing their victim
u to be dead, fired two or three shots at him
4 and left. Story, ba tered and stunned
crawled ashore, returned to the Munso1
House, apd gave himself up to the constable


His injuries are severe, but he will recover
from then. His escape under the circum
stances was almost miraculous. The peopl
Of Batavia had no hand in the lynching, an.


are indignant at the men who committe,
the deed. Mrs. Atchley is a woman of ith
form and graceful carriage, the best horse


back rider in the county, and the sympathie


of the town people are rather with her an


the handsome ST. Louis man whom sh
5 chose to elope with. The neighborhoo


where the affair occurred is not far from th


birthplace of Gen. Grant. ff1if"

The '.Are bugs"" again at work at Long Branch.
The first fire discovered in the Ocean Hotel about
midnight on Saturday, when the villagers were
aroused by the changing of church bells and
screeching of locomotives at the Central Railroad
roundhouse. The fire fortunately discovered
by Pstrolman Green. of Life Saving Station No. 5.
before it had made any great headway The servants
aroused and helped the life saving crew to
battle with the flames. which spread with great
rapidity. until the Fire Depal tment arrived. The
fire had started in the cottage in the south
end of the building. this winter occupied by Messrs.
Charles and Warren Leland Jr The supposed cause
was defective flue. After doing several thousand
dollars damage to the building and furniture the ire

It was late this morning when again the church
bells called the hremen, and again the alarm went
through the village that the Ocean Hotel was in

Independence, July 8, via Mo-
jave, July 5th.-This evening
about 8 O'Clock VIM. L. Moore,
Sheriff Of this county, was Instant
ly killed while performing
his duty as an officer by shot fired
from either of two parties who
were at the time engaged in an al.
tercation. The men were named
respectively Michael Welch and
Henry Tessier, and had met with
six shooters in the Albion saloon,
with the apparent attempt on the
part of Tessier to seek shooting
match on account of some words
which had passed between them
there o few hours before. Our
Sheriff stepped in between them
and received from one Of the men,
1t is not known which, a ball in the
left side. He spoke but few words
and fell dead. Welch was immedi-
ately taken into custody and
lodged in jail. Tessier ran through
and out OF the town and has so far
eluded capture, though the places
are being searched and there is
scarce O possibility of his escaping.
The town Is wild with excitement
aud the lynching of the two men

cessor in Office, Thos. Passmore,
met with death in an equally trag-
10 manner, the result of which was
the killing by the enraged citizens
Of i've criminal participants. The
deceased officer, VIM. L. Moore,
was q man Universally beloved and
the grief is intense here.

here, was again put in service in Baltimore,
in order to save Puroy, who was reserved for
the National game, and whose pitching it was
believed they could not hit


The crowd was very large aud impartial in
their applause, the Nationals getting the
larger share of the plaudits upon their side be-
ing the more deserving of it. The Nationals
led oil at the bat, and, in the first inning, gave
evidences of the terrific hitting that ensued
Derby started it with threC-base hit, fol-
lowed by Baker for a single Throughout the
entire game the hitting ON their side was free
aud heavy. The pet pitcher Purroy, delivered
the ball with all the skill hc could command,
but to no purpose as they hit him in all direc.
tions, seeming to have the power to send n ball
safely in any location. Rolling up the single,
double aud triple base hits so rapidly they
finally drove him from the pitchers position
and AlCot was substituted to stem the tide
running so heavy against them. But it was
no use. The Nationals meant business, and
| punished him so severely in two innings that
at the expiration of that time Purroy returned
and fought the up hill battle to the end.
| At the bat the Uticas failed to do much, only
| obtaining nine single bases. On the National
| side only four errors were committed, which
gave the visitors the two,ruus of their score
while the twentythree Oh the other side added
| twelve runs to the Nationals, who earned seven

playing Of Booth at second base deserves cspe
cial mention, as stories dcrogatory to his abili
ties had been circulated by some of the Utci
nine No second base was ever played superior
to that of the Nationals on saturday. Holly

no work to do. Daley, Kennedy, Alcot, ant

on the Utica side. The feature of the gam
was the strong batting Of the Nationals, moth

to abuse him. Moore stopped and turned toward
Thompson, but Moores friends advised him to let
Thompson alone. he would only put himself on an
equality with the negro by lighting with him.
Moore again passed on but Thompson still followed
and continued his abuse. After standing it for
some time Moore turned on the negro threw him
to the ground and commenced beating him with

the slightest reason to hope that the
Southern people, within one generation
at least, will become so reconstructed.
They still prefer license and poverty to
liberty, law, and prosperity. Still the

Harmonious Preliminary Meeting Adjourn


msnt till. Next Saturday.",,"Pursuant to call, there was a
meeting of Democrats in the
County Courtroom last night, to
take into consideration the forming
of q Democratic Club. The call
looked to the formation of club
of young Democrats, thirty-five
years being the standard of eligi-
bility. The meeting was strictly
of an informal character, and DEM
ocrats of all ages attended and ex-
hibited their sympathy with the
movement by quite general sign
ing of the roll of embership. A
temporary organization was ef-
fected by calling Mr.. Walter ID.
Stephenson to the Chair, Mr..
Coulter being selected as Secretary.


Mr.. Stephenson stated the object
of the meeting in a few happily
chosen remarks. A discursive chat,
rather than speech making, fol-
lowed, in which there was some
doubt expressed as to the advisa.
bility of the age restriction.


On motion of Mr.. Joseph ID.
Lynch, the Chair was empowered
to appoint a Committee of three
to report on organization, constitu-
ton and bylaws to an adjourned
meeting which is to be held at 7:30
P. NJ, next Monday, in the same
place.


The Char appointed the Messrs.
Lynch, White and Patton AS such
committee.


MI. White begged to be excused,
and the vacancy thus caused was
filled by the nomination of Mr..
Waters.


A desultory debate followed,
which was participated in by the
Messrs. Cowgirl, White, Ling, How
ard, Brown and Norton, the gem
eral drift of which was that the
Democracy desired to extend to
Workingmen and all others q cor
dial invitation to join the Club, the
only test being u professed adhe-
renee, for the future, Irrespective of
the past, to the Democratic party.


The chair remarked that from
the temper of the meeting, the
committee would doubtless cOnsd.
er the age qualification as part of
the work they were to report upon.


There was an informal assent to
this.


After some further informal dis
cussion, the meeting adjourned to
meet in the County Court room. at
7:30P. NJ, Monday, February oath,
to hear the report of the Commit
tee of Three and effect permanent

In yesterday mornings TIMES was a briei
account OF a horrible murder which had been
committed near EastUn, a small town about
fourteen miles from here. The circumstance
as detailed IN tina; issue are substantiated by
the testimony given before the CoToneT's in-
quest which was held yesterday, the full pro-
ceedings OF which are herewith appended
and it appears that the surmises that were
made that


MORE TERRIBLE CRIME


had been committed upon her person before
the murder was committed, and that her life
was taken TO forever seal her lips as TO the
perpetrator, have proved horrible reality.


Yesterday morning TINES reporter left
with Sheriff +. q. Lowe, for the scene of the
atrocious crime; but the latest reports re-
ceived indicate that he had Joined a body of
men in the search for the fiend who did the
deed and our Information in regard TO the
affair is based upon the testimony given be-
fore Coroner Lynch and a conversation had
with him. He stated that there were
two parties under surveillance who Were
suspected OF the crime, but that it was scarce
ly thought that these were the right parties
that the Sheriff had received Information
from Winchester, a station on the Kansas
Centrai railway still farther up the read that
a strange man


WITH A TERRIBLY LACERATED FACE
had passed through that city and he was
thought to be the right party. having re-

of his victim TO project her life and honor
from his british lust. \ posse had been or
ganized by the sheriff and were in pursuit
OF this party and IL was thought that his cap

time.

scoundrel stands little chance of ever reoeiv

The deceased was lady about forty-two

largely attended the audience filling the Opt
ra House almos, to n jam and including dele

Chicago,


While Mayor Ellwood OF Joliet in his rc
marks on taking the chair, conveyed the idc'
that the main object Of the meeting Was Il
take steps 10 forward the snip canal project, !
soon became apparent that the body of th'
meeting regarded as of vastly more immcdiat,
and practical importance some prompt step
to save the canal ~ it is They therefore yer,
wisely forced into the foreground, and gave
their main emphasis, to a clear and earncs
expression in favor Of demanding of the pre-,
cnt legislature the setting aside Of IN ample
contingent fund to enable the Canal Board Il
keep the ditch in running order whether /
Weld, any tolls or not The meeting held
and we think correctly, that when the railroads
see that the legislature Of the state is ready tC
vote even 100000 II year, il necessary, to save
It's property from destruction, they can no Ion
gcr afford to maintain the present fight to dry
the canal up and will abandon It.

and we are gratitied to note did, pass appro
pirate resolutions in favor Of the ship cana
project, and in commcndation Of the efforts OF
our representative in Congress, Mr.. Hayes, in
behalf o. the river improvement.


While the convention deemed 1t incypedicnt
upon the whole, to give uttcrancc to any strong
expression Of feeling against the plottngS OF
the railroads to ruin our canal, they can in re
ality take little comfort from that fact for al
though Mayor Lynch's resolution demanding
Of the legislature such an amendment of the
anti-cXtOrton laws rs would raise the penalty
for their violation to 100000 and forfeiture OF
franchises for IL second oiicnsc, was laid aside
the hearty applause with which his earnest
speech ON the subject was greeted, showed
clearly enough in what quarter the heart of the
meeting lay. II, as one Of the speakers init
mated, the railroads are really beginning to
dread the popular feeling that is rising in re.
gard to their raid on the canal that applause
may indicate to them that they have good rea.
son for such dread

Mr. Ray presented a minority rcpor. as fol.

earnings of the Illinois and Michigan canal for
the next two years will not be sufficient to make
the necessary repairs and maintain the same;

three sections, as follows;


/ NsU WHEREAS, The Illinois and Michigan
canal is state institution from which, as ""a con-
IpctnG line OF transportation, the people of the
state derive incalculablc benefit and
i Whereas, the said canal has always been not
only scli-sustaining but source OF revenue, and
must continue to be so although carrying freight
at nearly onc-half less than the rates charged by
railroad corporations for equal distances on their
railroads where they do not come in competition
\ with the said canal; and


\ Whereas, the railroads running parallel with
and crossing the said canal are carrying frcghts
! for nearly three-fourths less from points along
the line of the said canal than they charge for
Icqual distances on their railroads away from the
Icanal, evidently for the purpose Of accomplish

making the penalty not less than 100000 and
not over 5000 600 for the first ocnsc and for the

Alex, Naughey moved the adoption of

! G w Armstrong said Lynch's would re.
Iquirc special legislation which is impossible.
Besides it is impractlcablc. Mr.. A. favored
Mr. Rays as the only practical report offered
and as covering all the ground needed. The
present canal is large enough and has never
done l-20th the business it can do.
! Mr. Ray sald the canals present danger is
the only question at issue. We want money
to protect it and from the legislature It must
come. If we go there with that simple pro
position we shall get what we wan'-we must
pool our issues for this money.


Mr. f. F. Bull said the object Of this meet
ing is to adopt some measure to preserve the
canal This Is the view of all the people
along the canal, and we are here to drive
home some one measure. The railroad law is
stringent enough The railroad kings are
sovereigns perhaps but they are trembling
now before the people. Even Sage of the r.

The discrimination against the canal is now
the only one comp lained of in the state. The

Of Louis p. Lynch member of Council


to the office Of Street Commissioners.


The protest is truthful, strong and


vigorous, and places the action Of Mr..


Lynch in voting for himself for the Of


fee in a very unfavorable light before


the public. We have already said that


while Mr.. Lynch had legal right, he


had no honorable right to vote for HIM


self. 1t is true that no mere rule OF

the rights of member of Council, but


there is always motive higher and

every year during the last seven years

""Every member who is present when


question is stated from the chair, shall


vote thereon, unless excused 10y two
thirds of the members present, or un-


less he be directly interested in the ques,
tion, in which case he shall not vote""
Nothing could be more plain than this
rulsunanimously adopted for the govern

ter year Mr.. Lynch voted wa think at
least seven timea. Mr.. Lynch does not
deny that he violated that rule of Coun-
Gil, openly and wilfully for the sake of
go tting ali Office worth $500 year, the
term being for three years. 1t is no
justification for Mr.. Lynch and his


friends to say that the real
statute law was not violated,
and therefore, he should be held guilt
less. 1t is honor that is at stake. 1t is
whether mans word is to be relied


upon when he has an Office in view
Here is Mr.. Lynch's great mistake. He
has seen proper to sacrifice honor in
this particular case for the sake of get.
ting an Office worth $500 a year. Mr..
L. in his address before Council on
Monday night stated that when he
mentioned his. Intention to become

was honorable in Mr.. Paynter, and had
Mr.. Lynch taken his advice he no doubt
would have had the support not only of
all who did support him in caucus, but
of Messrs. Hart and Paynter as we'll. Mr.. |
Lynch however saw proper to reject
this advice and retain his membership
in Council that he might hold The bal.
ance in favor of himself if the time
come when it was needed. When he
next requested Mr.. Paynter to use his
influence in his favor, that gentleman
said, Il will do all can to defeat you,'
aud he did but did not succeed. He
did however force Mr.. Lynch to wiful.
ly violate long standing rule of Coup.
Gil for which he Lynch) had
steadily voted over and over. The
protest of the minority against such
actions, is timely and effective though
for the present it cannot reverse the
action of the City Council, and Mr..
Lynch will remain Street Commissioner

New HAVEN, Conn, Dec. A man
named Upton was arrested yesterday
in Ausonia, for causing the death Of
his infant. According to the wifs's
story, he came home drunk few
nights ago, and quarreling with her,
hurled lighted lamp at her which fell
into the cradle and set fire to the
clothing over the child. In the en-
deavor to extinguish the flames, her
own clothing caught fire and she will
probably die. The infant lived q few
hours only. Ths couple have been
married two years, and have hitherto

BAKERSFIELD, May 2S.-A mob
at this place last night took the
notorious Yoakum brothers from
jail and lynched them. The elder
brother, Bill, proving too obstrep.
erous to be handled conveniently,
was shot, twelve bullets being
lodged in his body. The other
brother was hanged. The offense
Of the Yoakum brothers was the
assassination of man named
johnson. against whom they held
o grudge, about year ago. AS
their victim was riding along the
road in q wagon, seated beside his
wife, the Yoakums fired upon him
from behind some bushes, killing
him instantly. The wife saw the as
sassins run away from their covert
and was able to identify them.
One of the brothers was convicted
of murder in the first degree In the
Bakersfield District Court. The
case was appealed to the Supreme
Court, by which q decision was
rendered day before yesterday re-
verstlg the action of the lower
court and granting a new trial and
change of venue to Fresno county.
This was the final straw which the
long suffering people Of Bakersfield
could not bear; there had been
talk of vigilantes for some time,
and, last night the crisis was pre-.
cipitated as stated. There is no
doubt but that two very vicious
and dangerous men are out of the
way.

A suit has been commenced here in the Superior
Court for the county of New Haven which
affects very seriously prominent priest
of the Catholic Church. Rev. Thomas j.
bridgeport and also involves the estate
of the late Very Rev. James Lynch Vicar General Of
the Hartford diocese. The petition is filed in the
name Of Miss Susan McCabe. neice Of the deceased
Vicar General and for many years his housekeeper.


THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGATIONS.


She alleges that the late Rev. James Lynch. for
meriy pastor at st. Patricks Church. in this city.
was her uncle. and that short time prior to his
death he met with accident. which injured
his spine. paralyzed and rendered useless his
arms and legs and entirely prevented his using q
pen; that he possessed in his right of per-
sonal property Of great value. including money
on deposit in various banks and claims
and demands for money loaned and deposited
with individuals and corporations. the whole
amounting, the petitioner believes and therefore
AYERS to be not less than the sum of $4,000. And
Lynch was physically and mentally unable to CON-
pose and execute u written document to enable him
to make d1spO01tlOu OF his property; that
Thomas j. Synnott, Of the city of bridgeport in
said State, then. and for long time previous.

HOW TRUSTEE WAS


The petition goes to say that Father Lynch
held promissorv notes Of Father Synnott for large
amounts Of money, aggregating IN the whole many
Father Lynch acquired all his property while he
held the Office and performed the duties Of an ecce
siastic in the Roman Catholic Church. and preferred
property should not be made known to the
public. and it was then and there agreed
(Synnot should be discharged from his obligations
as the maker of the promssory notes. and that he
should keep and retain the amount of money repre-
sented by the notes trustee. and that he should

sole and exclusive benefit of the relatives of Father

Synnott. The petition further says ""that said
Synnott bv fraud and falsehood obtained said trust

The petition also sets forth that the said Synnott
has paid out for this trust fund, ting to
$4,000 to several relatives OF the deceased aud
| fully and iraudulently refrained from admitting
! that the amounts so paid and expended are
paid and expended from said trust estate and from
acknowledging that he merely acting as a trus-
tee in dispensing said money and has by fraudu-
lent inducements carefully endeavored to guard
himself against the possibility of furnishing those
entitled to said trust estate any evidence OF their
| title to the same. The petitioner states also that
she Is unable to name all those who interested in


this trust fund.- but she that the said Synuott
knows who they are, and that he has fraudulently

| cerning their interest in said trust estate, and

which show that he i, not only the
boss bulldoz.r Of Mississippi, hut a
man entirely devoid Of truth. In 1874
the district had Republican majority Of
$1,000 out of total vote Of y 900. Jno.
W. Lynch was the Republican repre-
sentative in Congress. Bulldoling then
commenced and in 1876 thu district
elected this notorious Chalmers by the
gross-st frauds, marching the colored
Republicans up to the polls by hun
dr-dt, and a, the mouths OF pistols and
sho, guns, compelling them to vote tn g
Democratic ticket. Last November
Chalmer. va, again elected RECEIVING
6G63 votss out of sO5l votes cast there
being 1888 who dared to vote for Re-
publican candidate. Ar Chalmers only
got 6663 votes out OF a vote nf 1900
and was elected by 5275 maj ority,
there naturally exists some curiosity
to know what becam. Of the %, 900 Re-
publicans in the district. 1t does not
look as if they marched up to the polls
dressed In red shirts and led by brass
bands to vote for Chalmert. This kind
of stuff Is rather thin even for the
readers OF the Gazette, and yet this
is the kind it favors its readers with."

The meeting in Stearns precinct
Saturday night must have been a
good one. Barnum, Schultz, Carew
and Sperry spoke for the bonds and
Speice, North, Kinney and Loveland
against. We have not space for CIV
ing arguments on both sides, but
Barnum's cnmmon-sense hit at
Speice & North was well received,
that # he was in their place and was
getting a rich lot of milk from the
L. p. COW, he didn't believe he'd
kick the COW, any more than Speice

! showed freight receipts that convinc-
ed the meeting as to the eXorbitant

that the A. & would be a competing
line, and Sperry handled the tax
question with a vigor. Vote 40 for

have since been told that he was
ashamed of his vote.

earnestly requested to be especially
active and alert in Pleasant Valley,

NEWPORT, r. l., August ~. 1879.


An outrageous assault was committed on Block
Island last night aud the villain thanks to the pluck
of lady and resident of the island, is Jail
in this city. 1t appears that Mr.. J. w. Barrows.
prominent citizen of Hartford and guest at the
ragansett House. and lady were walking quietly
along the cliffs about nine O'Clock when just they

turned about. thinking that he heard noise At
the same moment he was struck in the fore
head with hard substance which proved to
he stone. Tho assalant took to his heels. but
followed by the lady, who screamed ""Murderl"" at
the top of her voice. By this time tho injured
also started In pursuit and he overhaued the fellow
on the edge OF the cliffs. Both clinched, and. in tho
scufie. they tumbled down the bank. The assailant
however. again escaped but was this time pursued

Geo. w. Talley and others ask that
the south side OF Vandever avenue from
Market to La Note streets, be curbed

James Ciumblish asked to be granted
the privilege Of laying a curb stone in
front Of his residence, No. 3O7 Van Bu-
rem street, and>fbat Council instruct the
Chief Engineer Of the Survey Depart
ment to give the lines for the curb.


Mr.. McGlincLey offered the following
resolution:


ResOtred, That the Street Commit ee
is hereby instructed to have the river
bank ext nd'ng north three hundred feet
from Chri stiana avenue put in good
condition in order to resist the Fall TIDES.
The expense of such repairs to be taken
from the appropriation Of incidental and
miscel aneous expcns s. The cost not
to exceed $50.


MIR. Paynter said that lie was down
in that neighborhood very frequently, and
he could not see any danger. Tie city
has already spent 81, 100 or 1000 on the
bank now. lie thought there was more
danger Of the banks along the avenue
being broken. If any money was TO be
spent, it should be expended in raising
the banks alsng the avenue. The $500
spent on the avenue last summer would
be entirely swept away and four or five
times as much more, II there should
come a storm like last Fail. He would
amend the resolution, that If any mOLey
is to be expended, that it be expend, d
on Christiana avenue.
Mr.. McGlinchey said that the commit
lee were going to put the Avenue in order
in short time but the committee hought
that the bank along the river should be
repaired.


Mr.. Payn'er withdrew his amendment
and the resolution passed.


MIR. Paynter called up for a third read
ing The oi dinance providing for the clean
sing Of the streets by contract, which was
read twice on December 2Gth, 1878.
| The ordinance provides that after Jan
sha be cleaned by contract.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that the ordi-
was a creation Of his, he had prepared
himself to speak on ii, but now the mat
Ter had been sprung OH him. He thought
that it was an act of discourtesey for the
gent from the Fourth ward to call up the
| ordinance.


Mr.. Paynter said he did not desire to
steal any Of tie gentleman's glory, he did
not want it.

Mr.. McGlinchey said that when he
went into caucus he meant to abide
by its dictates, and he never went back
on caucus a. those men (meaning
Messrs. Hart ana PaynteD had done.
He called for the yeas and nays on the
motion to lay over for one week. The
motion was lost by tie vote as follows:
Messrs. Har. and Paynter voted with
the Republicans.


Yeas-Messrs. Adams, Chandler,
Downing, Evans, Hart, Jones, Paynter,
Price, Wood and President Lichten-
stein-lO.


Nays-Messrs. Guthrie, Heusted,
Knight, Lynch, McGlinchey, Moore,
Norton, Taylor, Townsend and Walton.
10.


The motion to 60 into nomination
was lost by the same vote reversed.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that as reso-
luton had been adopted to hold the
election this evening no motion was
necessary and he nominated Charles
Dorman.


The chair did not sustain the point
raised by Mr.. McGiinchey.


Mr.. Paynter offered an ordinance
but Mr.. Moore objected to its reception.


Col. Taylor hoped that no gentleman
would object to the ordinance being
read as it was an important one;
""don't, "" he said, ""be like two men, ""
meaning Messrs. Paynter and Hart.


Col. Moore withdrew his objection,
the ordinance was presented and
passed two readings. The ordinance
provides that in replacing the water
wheel, ETC., at the City Mill, the Water
Committee shall be exempt from the
operations of the ordinance which re.
quires that all work costing over $50
shall be done by contract. Mr.. Payn.
ter presented another ordinance which
was also read twice directing the FL
nance Committee to issue certificates Of
Indebtedness to the amount Of $4,000.
Col. Taylor moved that Council go
into nomination and election to fill
the vacancy in the Ninth Ward.
Mr.. Paynter moved to amend to post
pone for one week. All the motions
were lost by tie vote.


Col. Norton said the people had been
thinking for some time that there was
something wrong in the Fourth Ward,
and it had been asserted that the Ward
is not represented by Democrats. He
had not word to say against the
gentlemen on the other side. You he
said ""are faithful to your party""
! Mr.. Paynter said that Col. Norton's
words had no effect on him in the
least.


Mr.. Norton said he wanted the peo-
pile to know what kind Of men you
ara.


Mr.. Paynter said something in rela-
tion to blackguard proceedings in Coun-
Gil.


Mr.. Taylor asked that the Clerk be
instructed to take note of his remarks


Col. Norton said Mr.. Paynter's
Democracy was not only questioned but
that it was known fact that he was
not Democrat.


Mr.. Paynter said that he was neither
an aspirant for the Levy Court, Street
Commissioner, Clerk of the Peace,
Librarian or any other Office. He said
he was not attached to any particular
ring. He said he was Democrat AZ
he always had been among the masses.


Mr.. Taylor said he supposed the gen
tleman alluded to him as being can
didate for Librarian. The speaker
said he never was a candidate for that
position.


Mr.. McGlinchey asked that if the
two members still persist in the course
they have commenced tonight are
they Democrats When they form
combinations with the opposition they
are traitors, exclaimed the speaker,
you dare not go ont the Republican side,
(Mr. Wood, ""they could not get on
better slde""-''cri-s of that's so.""D
Why says the speaker don't they re
sign their positions as Democrats.


AT 10 o'clock Col. Taylor moved that
a recess be taken until II. This was
done in order that the members of City
Council and the representatives of The
press might cool themselves off on ice
cream at the invitation of the newly re-
elected Registrar of the Water Depart
ment, Mr.. Morrow.


Council again assembled at II o'clock.
The motion to go into nomination
aud election to fill the 9th ward vacan.
cy, Mr.. Paynter moved to postpone for
one week.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that he wanted
to vote intelligently and he wanted in
formation. lie would therefore ask the
gentleman from the 4th ward to give his
reasons why 1t should be laid over
Perhaps it might change his vote and
perhaps it mightnot, though he thought
it would not.


Mr.. Paynter replied that he did not
think 1t was any Of the gentleman 8 |
business. He was of the opinion that
tho member from the Sd ward had 10
right to question motives as he did not
asked any of the members what their
motives were.


Col. Taylor did not agree with Mr..
PaynteT;he thought he should state his
reasons. Being elected Democrat he
was supposed to vote for Democratic
candidates.


Mr.. Paynter said it certainly was
very amusing to have boys in the Coun-
Gil to dictate to him about Democra-
cy. He said he was Democrat when"

not vote to take a.man wdrm of his seat
and place him In another position. He
said it does not give others a chance

reading him out of the party. He
would like to know what inf uence they

plause.]


Col. Taylor said that 1t may be his
fortune or it may be his misfortune that
he was not hoy 60 years ago, and he
said, 81 can't help that"" The Speak.
er said he did not question his Democ.
racy, bat it was his will and disposition
to dictate. The Speaker said he was
opposed to member Of Council aspiring
to a political position, but he was
willing to submit to majority Of the
party.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that the Street
Committee had nothing to do with fill
ing the vacancy in the Ninth Ward.


The motion to lay the matter over
ons week was again lost by tie vote,
as was also the motion to 60 into nom
ination and election,


An order was directed to be drawn in
favor Of John J. Farmar for $l75 for
making out the school assessment.


Col. Taylor moved to proceed to the
nomination and election to fill the 9Th
Ward vacancy.


Mr.. Paynter moved TO lay over for one
week.


Both motions were lost.


An order was directed to be drawn in
favor of James O'Toole, for $50 for
making ont the school assessment
Mr.. Paynter moved to adjourn.


Mr.. McGlinchey moved that Council
proceed to the nomination and election
TO fill the vacancy in the Ninth Ward.
Mr.. Paynter moved to postpone for
one week.


Col. Taylor said that Mr.. McGlin-
chey had the floor, and he asked il Mr..
Paynter had eight to make the mo-
tion.


The President-Mr. McGlinchey has
the floor.


Mr.. McGlnchey-Mr. President is it
honorable, is it just that these two
members should be the means Of de-
priving award of her representation
They have no honorable right to con-
tend so. Mr.. McGlinchey in closing
said: 81 speak The truth and speak
what | believe to be sincere when
claim them to be traitors to the par
ty.""


Mr.. Paynter replied that he did not
wish to answer blackguard as he
had not attacked any mans charac-
ter.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that he was not
a blackguard. The speaker said he
had often submitted to Mr.. Paynter,
and cited the Myles Burke fuss.


Mr.. Paynter moved to postpone the
nomination and election of candidate
for one week.


Mr.. McGlinchey--l ask why he wants
this matter postponed.


Mr.. Paynter said he had already an.
swered that question. As tor answering
the Third Ward gentleman's question
he would give that as much answer as
common blackguard. The speaker
said that he had attacked no mans
character. He thought Mr.. McGlinchey
was no Moses. His sarcastic remarks,
the speaker said, would not change his
opinion or his vote. He was going to
vote his sentiments. The speaker con
tended that he had right to vot. for
who he pleased, so he voted for Dem
ocrat.


Mr.. Hart said that it was he who had
kicked up the fuss, and that he would
take the responsibility on himself, that
Mr.. Paynter had nothing to do with it..
The speaker said that they had told
the members that they would not go
into the caucus unless Mr.. Lynch re-
signed his seat in Council. The speak er
sah he was a Democrat and he would
take the stand he has if he was obliged
to rernain three weeks in the council
chamber.


Col. Moore said that Mr.. Paynter mad
said to him that had h- known the
vote was going that way he would
have attended the caucus.


Mr.. Paynter-I pronounce that as
an absolute falsehood.


Col. Norton-Let me say to Mr.. Payn-
ter, never was anything else but q
Democrat and fighting one at that.
Mr.. Norton desired to know the reason
that Mr.. Paynter desired a postpone
ment for one week.


Mr.. Paynter--I will answer that
question by putting several to you.-
The speaker said that there had been
some things occurred that he was al.
most ready to reveal, and. one of the
members would blush at it. The tax
payers OF the city of Wilmington he
said would also be astonished. He
well knew where this caucusing was
done. 1t was done at the city hospital
last Sunday.


On motion of Mr.. Adams az it was
now u o'clock, Mr.. Chandler raised
the point that it being the Fourth of
July and legal holiday Council there.
fore had no night to remain in session.


Col. Taylor stated that the Senate Of
the United States had held sessions
over Sunday.


On motion of Mr.. Guthrie Council
took recess until one o'clock.


Council reassembled at one o'clock.
Messrs. Jones and Walton having pair
ed off the vote stood nine to nine.


The first business in order was post
poning the election for one week. The
yeas and nays were called and the mo-
tion was lost by tie vote.


The motion to go into an election was
also lost. A Amotion to adjourn was lost
by tie vote.

One Of the most brutal and cold blooded mur-
dcrs ever reported occurred Mt Marshall early
this morning. The principal victim is u
Northern actor. The members of the Ward
barrymore combination went to the depot to
take the train going North at two o'clock A. NJ,
on their way out of the State after an engage

went into tho restaurant adjoining tho waiting
room to get refreshments In the rear of this
room is n saloon with door open between.
James Currie, q Texas Pacific Railroad de-
tcctive, was seated alone in this saloon, where
he could SEQ the parties in tho restaurant.
Shortly after the entrance Of the above named
persons Curric called OUT f
""Thats high-toned - you have with you""
Barrymore replied, ""You are mistaken there
this is IL lady under our protection. You must
not insult her."" and added, touching Currie's

Currie rose to his feet and, advancing, said,
'Will you take it upr

tered soon after, when Currie put up his re-

Excitement over the affair grew in in

Newport Telegram to New York Herald.I


The first accident in submarine dress,
which occurred in these waters, took place off
Point Judith this afternoon. John Waters,
the well known wrecker, went off early this
morning to the sunken Block Island mail
packet Thomas J. Lynch, which sunk
off that place about two weeks ago, for
the purpose of raising her. His diver, Horace
Manchester, 80 years of age went down early
in the day, and apparently endeavored to make
all the necessary arrangements to tighten the
wreck. Nothing was heard from him for some
time, and the persons on board the wrecking
schooner Young America began to get alarmed
The air was being pumped and the lifeline
kept in hands which vainly tried to
feel the least pulsation, but none felt
from the unfortunate man who was eighty-four
feet below, that being the depth of water
where the craft sank. After he had been down
three-quarters of an hour he gave signal that
he was all right. In a few minutes he signaled
he wanted more air, and then he sigpalled that
he was having too much. His signals were
faithfully answered by Capt. Waters, who is
known in all wrecking companies between
here and New York as man who understands
his business.


The revenue cutter Samuel Dexter hove in





the Young America, bore down to her. She
was Immediately dispatched to this port for a
diver, gear and attendant, which was furnished
by Capt. Ramsay, United States navy yard,
commanding at the torpedo station. The diver,
Augustus Feliess, promptly volunteered to 20
down in search of the missing
man. He was soon submerged, but
returned after lapse of about
twenty minutes terribly exhausted. He re-
ported that he saw the man suspended about
five feet over the sunken vessel, the sir line
having been caught by hook on the boat
He went down again and succeeded in Olsen
gaging the line. At last the lifeless remains
of the diver were free, and as soon as the sig
nal was given they were hoisted to
the deck of the vessel. The
body was brought here at once by the cutter
and placed in the hands of an undertaken The
diver, when he came up the second time, was
found to be extremely exhausted. 1t is be-
lieved that the deceased was engaged in taking
out the ballast when the line suddenly became
entangled.


Capt. Waters is of the opinion that the man,
who went down with some little mlsgiying, ow-
ing to the depth of water, became frightened at
some slight disarrangement, and died in fit.
The face of the man shows that he died terri

of the law, are, Ira P. Olive, Brown,
Pedro Dominicus, Baldwin, Barney
Gillian, Phil Dufrend, Gertel, Green.
The others have not yet been caught.

stated as follows:


First. Shooting with a Winchester
rifle In the right side.


Second. Shooting with a Winchest-
er rifle in the left side.


Third. Strangling by means of
rope.


Fourth. Breaking the neck by
means of rope.


Fifth. Burning with fire.


Sixth. Producing death by means
of instruments to the jury unknown.


The last count is intended to cover
any possible theory as to Mitchell's
death which.may be produced.

Mr.. Chandler opposed the resolution,
saying that the sewer built as specified
would take it through private property.

Mr.. McGlinchey raised point of Or
der that all work of that kind called
for advertising for proposals.


Mr.. Townsend then had the street
commissioner instructed to advertise
for proposals for the work.


SMALL sQUALL.


Mr.. Townsend called up for its third
reading, the ordinance to amend the
ordinance providing for the care of
the Streets lanes and allies of the city""
The only amendment is that, increas-
ing the term of Street commissioners
from one to three years.


Mr.. Taylor.-When the ordinances
was presented last year to increase the
terms OF Auditor and City Solicitor from
one to three year opposed it then,
and from principle | must oppose this
also, If the Democrats have a good
Street Commissioner, they can re-elect
him from year to year and if the one
who fills the Office belongs to an oppo-
site party it makes DO difference. l op-
pose this because the Street Commits
sioner will be a Democrat after all,
the ordinance amounts to nothing; as
long as the Democrats continue in office
they can keep there man in, but as
soon as the Republicans hold the reins,
they can repeal the ordinance if it is
passed at this time.


Mr.. Norton-I have not forgotten the
ordinance that was passed by the Re-
publicans making the office of City
Solicitor last three years. If that was
good for that party it is equally good
that We do likewise. The gentleman
says he opposed that ordinance offered
by the Republicans; he did it because it
was contrary to his party.


Mr.. Taylor-Gnterrupting) And op-
pose this because it is not favorable to
the party.


Mr.. Norton, (continuing) For my
part wish the offices could be filled
and be done with and ii we can make
them longer the less bother it will be
to us.


Mr., Taylor-When the other ordi-
nance was upthe gentleman thought il
was terrible thing for the Republicans
to extend the term of office.


Mr.. Norton--Certainly, the Republi-
cans said it was good and what's good
for the goose is good for the gand-r
Let US do likewise.


Mr.. Taylor--Why don't you make
the offices last 20 years why not give
life lease extend them all extend
the Office OF Chief Engineer.


Mr.. Norton (interrupting)-l was
thinking Of Offering an ordinance te
that effect to night.


Mr.. Taylor (sarcastically)-The gen
tleman was thinking of it! And ye'
an ordinance for that was presented
several months ago! This ordinance is
introduced, not because it is necessary
but because a certain gentleman ex.
poets to be elected Street Commissioner
If we are in powers year afterward,
and if hs is a good man, we can re-elect
him.


Mr.. Paynter-I will oppose the ordi
nance because | opposed a similar one
offered by the Republicans; | oppose
it on principle. 1t is better to have thu
terms for one year, for then when yor
get good man you can re-elect hin
but one who does not suit cannot b'
gotten rid of so soon under this propo
sition. Whether you pass the ordinance
or not, if the other side comes in they
as the victors will want the spoils.


Mr.. Norton-As the gentleman said
the victors will want the spoils, to thu
victors belong the spoils,"" and that''
what we are after, (laughter.)

ing vote:

shrewdest business men of New England,
and famous as political economist, has
just re turned from an extended tour of
observation through the States of Geor-
gia, South Carolina, North Carolina and
Virgin ""a. The result of his iuvestiga-
ton, as given in the New York Herald,
is interesting, and valuable as well. The
growth of internal traffic, and the extent
TO which trade is directly carried on with
the North and Vest by inland towns, has
seriously affected the business of Savan-
nah and Chal lesion. Another reason
which be gives for the condition of busi-
ness in Charleston is the extent TO which
her credit has been loaned to railroad EN-
terprise,. In Atlanta he found much
more encouraging state OF things, and 81
also in Lynchburg and Staunton, Va. A.
| regards the relations Of whites ant
blacks, he was a close observer. Th,
frequent testimony that the negroes wer,
id e, lazy and shiitless was disprovcd by
what he saw. The blacks manif ST
\ tendedcy to flock to the cities, but they
are mbnopolizing The market-gardenins
business, and many of them are becom
ing possessed of land.


The crossroads store keepers are one o
the causes why the negroes will not re
main pn farms in the county. Thes,
stores, he says, are largely kept by Ger
mans, and to charge no more than a pro
fit of seventy-tive per cent is considered
very honest by the dealers. Real estat,
values are generally increasing, and goot
educational advantages are being enjoye,
by the colored people. Mr.. Atkison sum
marizes his views on this general subjec
thus:


That the main difficulties with respec
to the relations,of the two races in tn
several States have been sllrmounted
that the colored population is rated &C
cording to The ability and the industry @
indlvidutls; that the white population
changing, and new class is spriugin
up. A new ownership of property
coming in. The tools are passing I
those who can use them. A grea


marked and absolutely permanen
} change dates within the last two year,
J SO far as the testimony Of both colors ca


be relied upon to prove it. The no,
prominent men express themselves we
satisfied with the new order of things."

A Reign Of Terror in Eastern Kentucky.",,"CINCINNATI, November 10. The Enquir-
ers's special from Owingsville, Ky, gives a
distressing account of affairs in counties in
eastern Kentucky. Law abiding citizens are
arming and organizing to defend them
selves and courts against assaults and threats
of so-called regulators, and stop the reign of
terror which exists. SO far has this been
carried that no one dare report or have in
dicted any of the recent murderers. An or
ganization has been formed in Rowen comfy,
swelling to 800 men. They will see the laws
protected, and if need be drive the regulators
from the county. The regulators have
visited the magistrates in upper Rowan Co.,
and notified them that they must hold pris-
oners at preliminary trials by their orders,
under penalty of a midnight visit from Judge

been disposed of at police court, this
morning, the case of Robert Taylor, for
using abusive language toward Council
man William McMenamln, came up.
Mr.. Taylor was on hand as were also all
the city officials whose officers are in the
building containing the Street Commis-
sioEers office.


Mr.. McMenamin testified that Taylor
was in the Auditors Office yesterday
mosnlng, when he went there and that
he asked him for employment for two
horses and q cart in order to work out
taxes he owed the city. The reply was
that there was not much work going on
and, that the men and teams now in the
went into the Street Commissioners Of
flee, and Taylor followed him, and cursed
and used abusive language.


Auditor Underwood testified that Tay-
lor asked the Street Commissioner foI
work and he referred him to MIR. Nc
Menamin. McMenamin came in and he
repeated his request to him. The reply
was that not much work was being done
""and we are well suited as it is.""
""Who is wei"" asked Taylor. ""The
street department."" answered Mr.. Nc
Menamin. Taylor at one became very
abusive and remarked, ""it is bad time
for me when have to ask such a man
o. yourself for work. / remember the
time when you kept dirty rum mill fol
living; you are d-d, low, dirty, mean
hish, Catholic cur"" Taylor was imme
diately ordered from the office, and aftel
some more abusive language departed.
Street Commissioner Lynch corrobora-
ted the foregoing, and the prisoner made
charge but plead justifiable provocatior
in extenuation of his offense. He wa.
fined two dollars and required to pa,
costs."

MIDDLETOwN, Del, Oct. IA pret-
tier first OF October than this never dawn
ed, and the sky that bent over the FAR
grounds here was c'oudles sand beautiful.
The sun shone brightly but q slight
breeze that blew in over the brown peach
orchards dispelled the lassitude of the
atmosphere and prevented 1t from being
unpleasant. There was an encouraging
attendance during the day. nthe early
morning the people commenced pouring
in. They came from far and near and in
every imaginable kind ofveLicle. Many
were present from Cecil, Kent and
Queen Anne's counties in Nd, but the
bulk OF them were from New Castle and
upper Kent. The down train from Will
misgton brought quite number from
that place and other stations along the
road.

is feature Of the exhibition, is the dis
play Of canned and preserved fruits to be
found there a feature of ladies depart
ment. One side of the building is de-
voted almost exclusively to this, and the
display is varied and extraordinary. As
usual, Appoquinimink Hundred carries
off the palm III this liie. She has done
so for the past four or five years. John
Atherly is the exhibitor who enjoys this
prominence and in addition to proudly
showing his work, he represent the Hero
glass works, of Philadelphia, whose cans
lie uses. The needle work is very fine,
and the display Of rare plants and flowers
attracts much attention.


This morning there was display Of
horses and colts OH the home stretch.
Prominent in this were the two fine stall
lions ""Ciematis,"" owned by Hon. Thos.
+. Bayard, and ""Scathlock,"" owned by
J. &. Craynor. Last year they were OH
exhibition and ""Scathlock"" got the first
premium, "" hile ""Clematis"" had to be
content with second. This time the
judges will be bothered about coming to
conclusion, as Senator Bayard's slal-
lion is in much better condition than
then. In addition to these there were
some of the finest mares and cClts Oh the
Peninsula. The yearling colts were un-
usually numerous and handsome. While
they were thus being displayed the conf
mittee on awards were making examina-
tions preparatory to making their reports.


Among the prominent persons here to-
day were: Wan. Dean, Prothonetary
Chas. Beaston, Theodore Crawford, Esq,

from Miss Carpenter, we're still out when
the tram left New Castle. They were
evidently having . tough time in decid-
Ing whether or not Gallagher was too
drunk to have an intention of commit
ting larceny when he tOok the coat.
A gang Of negroes were brought out
this afternoon, for completely in a des-
perate riot which occurred at New Gas
tie several weeks ago. One OF them vas
out on bail, and 1t was feared he had
""shpped,"" until about five o'clock when
his bOndsman brought him into Court
and surrendered HIM. His name was
Joseph Starring, and the others were
James h. Williams, Rsbecca Startling,
WIN. Jackson, Ezekiel Davis and George
Crosby. They all announced themselves
ready for trial except Crosby. They vii
be tried during the present week.
1t was rumored around New Castle


this afternoon, that libel suits were to be


instituted by the proprietors of the Viii.

n Large Amount of Buster and Bragg for
a Bob Tail Party.",,"LOUISVILLE, KY, April lO-The Republican
State convention here to-day was very largely
attended. Hon. Jno. d. White, memorable as
the only Republican who has represented Ken
tucky in Congress for many years, presided as
chairman. Walter Evans received the nomlna-
tion for Governor, defeating Ell, H. Murray.
suffering defeat by union of all the elements
of opposing strength. The speeches were all
ultra in tone, and the resolutions which follow
were adopted with wild enthusiasm:


The Republicans of Kentucky contemplate
with pride the history and achievements of the
Republican party of the United States. We
hold up to the world the record it has made,
both in war and in peace. We do not ask that
any of it be forgotten. On the contrary, we
point to its great deeds and recall them to re-
membrance; the suppression of armed rebel
lion, and its unparalleled magnanimity to those
who attempted to overthrow the Union; the
emancipation and enfranchisement of an en-
shaved race; its determined purpose to honestly
pay the national debt the skill and prudence
| of its financial mana2 2ement and it's steadfast
purpose that justice and right shall be done to
| all citizens, under the law, without distinction
! of race, color, or previous condition of servi-
tude.


We firmly adhere to the principles declared
by the Republican party in the platform adopt





people of all classes as matter of the first ne
cesslty to the welfare of the State, and it is a
wise and most economical use of the public re-
sources to advance to the highest efficiency our
| common school system, and we pledge our
hearty support to any scheme of public schools
| that will advance this end.
| convention should be called at the earliest
practicable time to revise and amend our State
! constitution, and we urge upon all the people
! Of the State the duty of voting on all proper
| occasions in favor of calling such convention.
We condemn in the strongest terms the gross
Encouragement of public affairs in Kentucky
by the Democratic psrty, which has had entire
control Ut the State for the pa fourteen years.
1t has failed to foster common school system
worthy of the name, and has robbed the chill
dren Of the State, and has sacrificed the impor-
tant interests of the State in internal improve
ments and while it makes boast that the
State has no debt, we have the mortifying spec
tacle of State with no public institutions.
BY u'eless and reckless extravaganza, the
current expenses of the State are nearly three
| times great as before the war, while there is
| no reason or e lcuse for these being any greater
| BY continuous appeals to the lower passions of
the populace and by the constant laudation
and encouragement of that spirit of contempt
| for constituted authority lately rampant in re-
| bellion, the people of the State have been edu-
Gated into disregard of law and order until
the good name of Kentucky has been blasted





The frequent necessity to use the militia to
suppress disorder and the lawless spirit which
| stops short of no crime from the lynching of
obscure white and colored persons to the as
sassination of judges Of the bench, is the nat
ural outgrowth of the pernicious teaching of
the Democratic party.


Ihe kepubllcan party favors and demands
such change in the conduct of our State af-
fairs as will encourage our own people to re-
main IN the State instead OF going out from
US, and induce immigration into our borders,
that our soil may be titled and our resources
developed.


While we favor economy we demand that it
be practiced in cutting off useless extrava-
gance, and we favor more generous and
liberal expenditure of the public money for
| the purpose of fostering internal welfare
and IN aiding and encouraging our citizens in
| the general betterment of the condition of the
State. 1t is cardinal principle of the Re-
publican party that the currency of the
country shall be sound and uniform in value,
regulated by the authority Of the nation and
convertible into coin at the will of the holder.


The national debt should be paid in the
most scrupulous good faith. We are proud
that the Republican party has already been
able to pay off large portion thereof and fund
the remainder at a low rate of interest.


We are proud that the Republican party in
the face of bitter Democratic opposition has
been able to resume specie payment;
|
that crculates with equal readiness
in all parts of the country, and that
if it has made such record upon financial
questions, that the whole world has an abiding
faith that SO long as it remains in power our
national credit will remain unimpaired.


Federal and State governments are parts of
one system, alike necessary for the common
prosperity, peace and security, and ought to be
regarded alike with cordial, habitual and un.
movable attachment. Respect for the author.
lty of each and acquiesence in the just consti
tutional measures of each are duties required
by the plainest consideration of national, state
and universal welfare; but the constitution and
laws of the United States made in pursuance
thereof are supreme laws, anything in the
constitution or laws of any State to the con
trary notwithstanding.


The right of the President to veto a measur,
is as clear as the rig hit of Congress to pass it
We therefore witness with indignation the law
less attempt on the part of the Democratic
Congress to coerce the President into sub
serviency to its views by the threat of with
holding appropriations. In the trying position
in which the President is thus placed he is en-
titled to the encouragement and support of al
good citizens. The declared purpose on tn
part of the Democratic members in Congress
to refuse appropriations until he yield
to their demand is revolutionary in it's spirit
and as in 1861 secession was resorted to b.
those who could not control the government





mination to rule starve the government, i
another exhibition of rebellion, and every con
slderatlon of duty to the country demands tha
the President shall resist by every constitution
al means in his power this spirit of lawlessness


The Republican party is committed to tn
doctrine that every voter is entitled to one vote
and but one. Holding this doctrine, l. stand
In no terror of those wise and timely law
enacted by Congress to secure honest elections


We have seen with pride and pleasure th
distinguished honors paid to ex-Presdent Gran
by all classes In Europe. His services in wa
and patriotism and ability in the discharge c
the high civil duties to which the confidence
his countrymen repeatedly called him, his wi
: dom, his prudence, moderation and integrity
5 character entitle him to this striking and r
markable exhibition of courtesy and respe,
. abroad and to the lasting gratitude of his ow
l people. His name and fame are lnsepal ab
s linked with most important events in our cou,
r try's history. 1t is our pleasure to thus decla
i; our admiration and esteem for him, our graf
c tude to and our confidence in him.

Our telegraphic dispatches from CalifOr-
mia show that the Mississippi plan of con-


Quoting political campaign has been in
troduced into that State The tripartite


fight there is becoming exceedingly acrimo-
nious, and the worst passions seem to rule.
Mr.. KALLoCH has been put in nomination
for Mayor by the Workingmen, and the as
saults upon him in the Chronicle, an Honor
able Bilks journal, have been of the most bit
ter personal character, descending to the
most dlsgracelul mud-slinging, and dragging
the reputation of his dead father from the
grave. As might have been expected Mr..
KALLocH retaliated in kind from the ros-
trum, and had evidently got the best of his
adversary on his own selected battlefield.
In a speech to his party on Friday evening,
KALLoCH scored DE YOUNG, the editor of
the Chronicle, most terribly rs to his ances-
try. Exasperated by the damaging state
ments made by KALLocH, DE YOUNG sought
him and shot him down in most dastardly
manner. 1t had degenerated into mere
personal quarrel, which was alike disgrace


full to both parties, but in which DE YOUNG
was manifestly the aggressor, and cannot
now be viewed in any other light than as a
cowardly assassin, for lie gave his adversary
no chance for his life, and it was not his
fault if he did not murder him at sight.
Such were evidently the intentions of DE
YOUNG. This has infuriated KEARNRY and
his party, aud it will require a strong arm
and determined purpose on the part of the
authorities TO avert the punishment of De
YOUNG mt the bar Of Judge LYNCH. The
whole affair is a disgrace to civilization, and
especially to the politics of the period, when
passion bears sway and the legitimate
agencies of political contests are entirely"

prevailed. Cochran delivered himself up,

The Marsh Bill.",,"report Approred.


| City Council held an adjourned meet


ing, last evening, for the purpose Of dis
! posing of the bill in relation to marsh


properly in the suburbs OF the city.
The bill as prepared by the City Coun-
| Gil Legislative Committee invested Coun-
Gil authority and jurisdiction over the
! marshes, banks, sluices and drains with
in tn, city limits and ha'fmle thereof


with power to make necessary repairs, in
case the owners fail to do so after being
| duly notified, and to collect the cost OF


said repairs. by the sale of the property


SO repaired. The last section provided
that Council should have authority, in
its discreet m, to exempt from city taxa
| ton all marsh lands used exclusively for
| Agricultural purposes and bordering on
he Brandywine, ChristiarN or Della
ware rivers.


Mr.. Paynter offered a substitute bill
which had beeu prepared by the marsh
owners. L. was the same, in effect, as
the first bill except that it gave Counc |
authority over over such marsh lands


as were not owned by the marsh compan-
les. The last section provided that all
manufacturing stablshments-rolliDg
mills, forges, factories aud grain eleva-
| tors-erected on these lands should be
exempt from tsxation for the space Of
ten years from the time they are put in
to operation.


Mr.. Taylor objected to this new bill,
as he thought Council should have juris-
diction over the marshes owned by the
marsh companies, so as to compel the
making of repairs when necessary for the
| safety of the city.


MIR. Paynter moved to adopt Section /
of the new bill, and Mr.. McGlinchey
moved to amend by substituting section
uf the original bill.


Mr.. PaynIer thought the new bill was
the best sort Of a compromis- that cou d
be arranged, as the original bill would
ne yer pass the Legislature, on account Of
the opposition of the marsh owners. 1t
| would be useless for Council to try to
| compel the marsh companies to repair the
banks, as the individual members could
not be reached, and the companies had
nothing to sue. One ofthom-the Cherry
Is and-wa, $4,000 in debt, and it would
be useless for Council to sue this indebt-
edntss.


President Lichtenstein took the floor
anu CdIltu d'ItutlOu "" tuc idCl tudJ OeC-
ton provided that a lien made against
the marsh lands,o n account of repairs
done by the city, should have ""priority
over all other liens and enum brances
whatever"" This, he thought, was an
absurd provision, and moved to amend
by adding the words, ""made subsequent
to the passage of this act"" The amend
ment prevailed.


DIR. Walton failed to see why any legis-
lnet yt,af ii ,f
1; would would cost great deal of morey
to put the marsh banks in repair, and II
the marsh laoCs were sold in fee simple
they would not pay the expense of these
repairs.


After some further discussion Section
! of the original bill was adopted by the
following vote:


Ayes--M essrs. Adams, Chandler,
Downing, Evans, Guthrie, Hart, Huest-
ed, Knight, Lynch, NJ McGlinchey, M oore,
Norton, Rowe, Taylor, Wood, and MIR.
President-16.


Nays-Messrs. Jones, Paynter. Price
and Walton-4.


Absent-Mr. Townsend.


The other sections, which provide for
the mode Of entering the hens against,
and selling property for the cost of re-
pairs, were adopted.


The last secri IN. allowing Council to
exempt from taxation marsh lands used
exclusively for agricultural purposes,
gave rise to a protracted discussion.


Mr.. Norton thought it would be an alb
surdity, to exempt this land from t Xa-
ton when the poor mans houses were SO
heavily taxed.


Mr.. McGlinchey thought these agricul-
tural marsh lands We're more productive
aud better able 10 pay taxes Than many
of the sterile, uDproductive lots on the
Third Ward hills


Mr.. Lynch thought it would be no
harm to give Council this power, as it
might he advisable at some future time,
to exempt the property from taxation.
Mr.. Taylor objected to this section be-
cause il made Council Board of Revi-
sion-a burden they had just got rid of.
The Board of Revision can assess this
proper as they think just and right, ac-
cording to its value, and If the ASSESS
ment is low the taxes Will be low.
Mr.. Payhter said it should be remem-
bered that the marsh owners get nothing
for the taxes they pay, while other taxa
bis get light, police protection, paved
streets, SC.


A motion to strike out this section was
adopted by rising vote of 10 to z, after
which the section just Ost was subsiitu-
ted by the last section cf the marsh OWL
ers' bill, eXempting manufacturing estab-
ishments erected on the marsh lands
from taxation for ten years after they are
put in operation.


The bill, as a whole, was then approved
almost unanimously, DIR. Walton alone
voting In the negative.


Mr.. Paynter presented the report of
the committee of citizens u In relation to
the Water Department machinery (pub-
lished elsewbere) recommending The re-
newal of the water pumps, aud the appli-
cation of one-third of the net revenue OF
the Department each year to the exten-
sion and improvement of the machinery.


Mr.. Paynter moved that tue Lesi'la-
tive Committee be instructed to PREF are
bill cmbodying these recommended
tions.


Mr.. Chandler thought it would be best
to have authority to borrow $50, 900, or so
much thereof as would he necessary TO
renew the pumps.


Mr.. Paynrer presented AN after sugges-
ton from mem ber of the citizens COM
mittee, 10 the effect thal instead of ap-
preparation one-third of the net revenue
of the Department, the amount should be
specitied-S12,000a year.


Mr.. Taylor moved that the whole SUBJ
ject be referred to the Legislative Com
inittee, with instructions to report a bill
embodying the recommendations receiv-
ed, in which the amount set apart each
wear for extension and Improvement
shall not exceed $4,000. Adopted.
Council then adjourned until Wednes-
day night, at 8 O'clock, when the legisla-
tive business will be finished."

 It was recently said that no new heatnen temples were now building in Northwestern India, but a missionary writes home that the people are ""stifl mad on their idols; almost every house has them; new temples are constantly being built in honor of these idols, and the religious bathing-places and assem- bly-grounds are crowded""

 In New York city there are dealers, incredible as it may sound, who make living by buying broken meat, given as aims by tender-hearted servants to inn portunate beggars. These mendicants. from out Of their days receipts. select such Jumps of meat or half-picked bones as will prove salable, and at nightfall proceed direct to these stores, where they dispose of their unsavory wares. Then the scraps from the tables of the rich are resold.

 A wealthy old gentleman living in Berlin fell in love with the young daughter of poor widow. He wooed and won the girl, and before the we'd ding-day arrived, he made will leaving her all ms property, amounting to sev- eral hundred thousand marks. The marriage was celebrated in brilliant style, and the welded pair with their guests sat down to breakfast Scarcely had the teasting began, when the vener- able bridegroom dropped his knife, and sank back in his chair, dead from heart disease.

 A lighthouse keeper near the mouth of the Potomac has devised an ingeni- ous plan for the slaughter of the ducks and geese which light on sand bar near his station. He has battery of twelve muskets firmly fastened to two heavy timbers, six above and six below; these are heavily loaded and connected with the lighthouse by long wire cable. As soon as he sees geese near enough he pulls his cable and explodes all the guns at once, and then takes his skiff and picks up the game. His most successful shot this year gave him thirty-three geese.

 A New York veterinary surgeon as- serts positively that even the saliva of a dog may communicate hydrophobia ""One of the most marked causes of hydrophobia that ever occurred in this city,"" he says, twas that of a gentleman who had allowed pet slut to lick his face. The animal had shown no symp- toms of madness, and did not afterward become mad, so far as l am informed. The victim had a slight abrasion of the skin on his face, and allowed the crea- ture lick it, with an old-fashioned faith in the healing virtue of a dogs tongue. He died within four weeks of pro nounced hydrophobia.

 There is a story that Q wealthy Chi cago merchant lately prevented the breaking of his will by calling his rela- tives about his death-bed and getting them to make affidavit before a notary that he was competent to make a will, After the funeral it was found that all his property was given to lunatic asy- | lum. Then the heirs tried to have the will set aside by showing that though sane at the last, in 1875, when the will was made, he was raving mad. Thereu p on the eXecutor produced a will exactly like the first, except that it was signed and witnessed a few minutes before the affidavits as to the testator's sanity were | taken.

 It seems that the common people in | Sweden do not continue the family name | from father to children Indeed, they have no family name. The name ot the | child gives no intimation whatever of the surname of the father. Thus, sup pose a man is named Peter Ohlson. his | boy may receive the name of John Peter son, and his grandson perhaps Peter Johnson, the surnames being formed from the given name of the parent, and thus being changed with every generation. It will be seen that this makes it impossi- ble to trace families. This custom does not prevail among the higher classes in Sweden, but is universal among the common people who con- pose the greater portion of the emigrants to this country.

 A remarkable case of lynching has. oc- cured at Cheyenne, Wyoming. A man named Dug Reed, who had been guilty ofa crime particularly obnoxious to the citizens. was taken out of jail. Then, with unusual courtesy, the lynchers al- | lowed Reed to select the method of death most agreeable to him; and when he stated that he would prefer to be hanged, they went still further in their courteous regard for his feelings, and allowed him | to be his own executioner. He took the rope in his hand. climbed telegraph | pole, fastened one end around the top, and formed a moose in the other end through which he passed his head. Then he made his last dying speech, which was short, being no more than Goodbye, boys,"" and, jumping off, was launched into eternity.

HOW BOB MANAGED THE PUPPIES.
In the town ofNaugatuck, in the State
| Of Connec icut, there lives an old dog.
nailed Bob, who is called ""bird dOg,'
| because his master uses him to hunt
| partriiges and other birds. BOb's mat
| ter also has four little puppies, which he
| expects to teach how TO hunt birds. On


last Monday the puppies were play ing
| on railroad track not far far from their


house, when Bob happened to see them.
| A few years ago locomotive came very


near running over Bob on the same
| rack, aud so when he saw the puppies
he was very much excited. He seized
| one by the neck and ran with It TO the


middle of the street and then started
back after another. But before he had
| carried second puppy from the track
the first one was back, as lively as ever.


Somehow the little rascals, who didn'


think about the danger from the locomO
tive. seemed to want to tease Bob. After
| he had worked for ten minutes Bot
| stood still and held his head down, as if
te felt very much puzzled. Bye and


bye he picked up one and carried it of
| the track rs before. On putting it down
| this time, however, he watched 1t for a
few seconds. Sure enough the puppy
puppy started back, but Bob gave IT q
sharp bite, which made the pup how

/ The Grand Jury was sworn and w. A.


Clark, Esq, appointed foreman by the
| Court.


Judge Galbraith then delivered the


charge to the Grand Jury. saying it was
4
his province by virtue of the laws OF the
Territory to instruct them in relation to the
nature and character Of their duties in the


solemn capacity Of Grand Jurors. They


ssgi been summoLed from the body OF tile
scoaanty 10 the duties outlined in lsIeir oath


inquire into and make true present-


n9ant OF all public offenses against the
laws OF the Territory committed. or tria-


BILE, in THU county of which they had or


could obtain legal evidence and also to


perform such other duties as, under the


law, might be given them by the court.


1t was their power and it was their duty TO
make the above inquiry in relation to such
public offenses, and to present them to the
court BY Indictment. The explanation of
the laws governing their action and the
statutes required to be especially given in
charge were stated clearly and at length.
After concluding the written charge, Judge
Galbraith made extemporaneously the fol-
lowing remarks to the jary:


''There are no more important duties
than yours, effecting as they do the peace,
welfare and prosperity of the county. It ia
fact that crime has recently been more
than ordinarily prevalent in this Territory |
and District, but there is mo- warrant for
the advice to antagonize the law by the |
formation of Vigilance Committees and to |
institute Lynch Law and mob violence. |
The experience of ages ha5 demonstrated |
that the strict administration of the Stat
utory Laws and due support to the con- |
stituted authorities is the most efficacious,
as well as the only proper, means for the |
prevention of crime, whether in enforcing
or defending the true interests of society. |
There is matter in this connection to
which | desire in the brlefest manner to |
call yeur attention, and that is the state
ment which has been used and is claimed |
to be the strongest argument in favor of
the existence of Vigilance Committees, or
the enforcement of what is called Lynch
Law. The substance of the assertion
made is that ""the best citizens will not 90
apon the jury but will, ON the contrary,
join Vigilance Committees"" AS good cit
izens let us hope that this statement has
been made and used ironically. But, lest
it may have tendency to mislead public
opinion, will bestow upon it brief criti-
cism. Whenever an individual belongs to
society he is under moral obligation and
sacred compact that be will perform his
duties as citizen, and among those duties
is chat TO act as juror Whenever duly call
ed upon to do SO. In return for this and
in consideration for these services, society
will and does protect him In the enjoy
meDt of his life, person and estate. This
is solemn obligation solemn compact
between the citizen aud society. Ii ia the
the basis of all governments.
How can that individual be called even q
good citizen, much less one of the best cit
liens, when he refuses to live up to his
solemn compact and obligation to society
1t ought to be matter Of cong .atulation
and pride in every one of MS that now, in
the infancy Of this Territory, we have the
opportunity of assisting In the establish
ment of those institutions of self-goyern-
ment which will inure to the bsnefit of the
people, the happiness of posterity and the
dignity and character of this common
wealth, which is destined in the near fu-
ture to become one of the fairest members
10 the sisterh 20 ID of the Repu bic. one of
lbs brightest stars in the galaxy of States.
Who can doubt the dignity, the honor, the
Importance of his position when summoned
TO sit either as grand or petit jurors
Therefore, say, let him endeaver to per-
form his duty as juror with that courage,
idelity and patriotism which ia inherent
in and characteristic Of his highest
deal of its performance; and our social
fabric will be erected upon the firm and en-
lurlng foundations of respect for and obe-
ilence to the law.

The exclusive publication in the HERALD of sun
day last OF the arrest of Gopher BILL"" and
his Identification of the principals in tho
masked burglary at the Bailey mansion at Taggart
Corners, Chester county on the night ofNovember5 g.
has created much dissonsion among the private de-
tective bureaus of this city. The Central ONCE
have abandoned the job entirely. and other disap-
pointed detectives only too glad to their
negligence in not arresting the confederates Of
Gopher Bill"" by the assertion that the HERALD has
defeated the ends of justice by too early publica
ton OF the fact of the arrest.


Tho fact was that until this afternoon very little
was known which to base u second arrest. De-
tectve Spitall visited West Chester to-day aud had
long interview at the Jail with William Hamilton,
otherwise ""Gopher Bill"" he went armed with all
sorts OF threats and promises but had only
ent SUCCESS The admitted that he was
aud declared that he old man and was quito
willing to tell all that wanted If he could bo as
sured of q light sentence. but he had no faith In
Chief of Police Lynch. and doubted sptals
power to secure the mitigation OF sentence de-
sired. In his pocket, when arrested, found
the card of crooked"" Wilmington saloon keeper,
called Carroll. and investigation proved that Bill had
been there the morning after the robbery. All the
additional evidence has been obtained by browbeat-
ing the prisoner Detective Spitall left West Chester
on the half-past two train for Philadelphia, and his
partner states tonight that before the week is ended
all the burglars will be In custody."

THE GOVERNORS RECEPTION.


In accordance with time honoIed Gus
tom, the Governor held a public recep-
ton In the evening. From eight to ten
o'clock was the time, and the Kent
County court room the place. The Gov
ernor was assisted by his wife and daugh-
ter, and the latter's husband, Mr.. Il. w.
Lister of Philadelphia. John G. Penne-
will. of Dover, acted as Master of Cere
monies, and introduced the visitors to
the new Governor. The latter sustained
the trying ordeal nobly and by his friend
~ smile AID kindly greeting, added num-
bers to the host of firm friends he al
ready possesses In this State. The re-
caption was attended, by the elite of Kent
County, and the costumes of many of
the ladies' we're really magnificent.
THE INAUGURATION BALL.


The ball, which is supposed to be an
Indispensable wind-up to an inaugura-
ton, came off in the Court House Hall
and was quite successful commenced
about II O'clock, and continued until far
into the morning. 1t was free to all
corners, and as a consequence the crush
| at first was Immense, but the crowd soon
| thinned suffi icienty to allow room for the
dancing The floor committee was COM

THE MILITIA's MISTAKE.


The militia from Wilmington made a
favorable impression by their drill and
parade, but they made a sad mistake
when they stacked their arms in the cor.
ridor of the State House. The county
members looked ominously on this pro
ceeding, and prominent citizen of Sus
sex County remarked to a GAZETTE re
porter, 81 don't like to see this it re-
minds me of the time the Federal soldi
ers stacked their arms in the Court
House at Georgetown""


THE RIDE HOME.


The special train for Wilmington lett
Dover few minutes after twelve o'clock
and under the efficient management o
Conductor Thos. Hawkins and engineer
Murphy, made the up runin an hour ant
half, to the great satisfaction of tn,
passengers, who were anxious to reacl

Ijoyed themselves thoroughly, and tn,
city official delegation were unanimou
in their praise of the committee of ar
rangements, and particularly of the
chairman, Councilman Lynch, for PRO
viding so completely for the comfort anC
convenience of the entire party."

around, arrayed in full uniform, and Of
the various city officials congregating
around the City Hall, bearing bright
colored badges on their coat lappels, be-

was the case, and the ''stranger within
the gates of the city,"" on inquiring the
cause Of the commotion, was quickly in
| formed that nelaware's new Governor,
Hon. John w. Hall, was to be inaugura-
ted, and that Wilmington was going to
do her full share towards making the
affair grand success.


| Shortly after eight o'clock the militia

THE TOXIC MAY ARRIVE.


lBY TELEGRAPH TO THE HERALD.l


SAN Francisco. Sept. IA. 1872


The representatives of the New World on the
Pacific shore needed no stimulus to do honor to
General Grant Their memory Of his great deeds In
arms was vivid. their hearts as warmly en-
thusastic before Kcarneys rufianly speech on the
sand lot on last Sunday as they to-day. Before
the wouldbe assassin poured his murderous lead
into the person Of Kaiser William his devoted sub
jects loved him not less yet they loved him after
ward more ardently they remembered his past
life, and the glow of purer affection suddenly
warmed within them. when they praised Heaven
for his miraculous preservation. as=4


KEARNEY's DANGER.


Kearney's threatened offence aroused the slum-
bering affection and enthusiasm OF the people for
General Grant till it now borders idolatry and
correspondingly there is dotestation of Kearney.
That he will escape violence of some kind will be
almost miraculous. when nearly every who
is spoken to on the subject expresses readiness
to lynch him. 1t is very easy to comprehend his
peril. His meagre chance of safety only be in
his silence and IL is hoped that he will stay at homo
while General Grant is the guest of the city, Should
he be foolhardy enough to brave the raging storm
of indignation, you will soon hear Of the end OF
Denis Kearney. He must not furnish even the
shadow Of an excuse for attack. Should violence
ensue, to political party will it be attributed.
1t is the wrath of an offended people, ready to
burst forth and burn up tho demagogue who has
dared to insult the civilization of the world that has
paid homage to and honored the American citizen
and soldier. ex-President Grant.


The Committee of Veterans called upon the boys
in blue and the boys in gray alike cordially invit
ing both to form in procession and escort the tri-
umphant General through the city. About five
hundred veterans of the late war met last
night and resolved to welcome General Grant
upon his arrival here with national salute from
the sand lots. In demonstrating their welcome
they will mingle freely and warmly as If the
picket lines between them had only been romance.


KEARNEYIsM DOOMED.


On the sand lots, where Kearney beched forth the
braggar threat he would burn General Grant in
efgy, confederate and federal will meet and salute
the honored citizen, and in that number will be
many workingmen themselves who have listened to
Kearney for the last time. Numerous rumors are
abroad about the workingmen's party demand
ing Kearney's abdication. To-day Wallock, the
former vice president of the party, tried to
PoSo
with all loyal citizens in demonstrations the honor
Of General Grant. but Kearney opposed them in q
violent speech sti evincing his cowardice the
effgy business. yet without manliness enough to
his folly. It has, however been demonstrated
at the sand lots to-day hatsKearney has given him.
self his death wound. San Francisco has wiped out
the reproach Of Kearneyism.


THE CITY TOXIC.


In reply to telegraphic inquiry cable despatch
from Yokohama announces that the steamer City OF
Toxic, which General Grant is passenger. Is not
under orders to make other than ordinary time,
and consequently It is probable that she may
not arrive here before next Sunday. although
the Pacific Mail authorities say that she
may make this port early wednes-
day. To provide for that contingency preparations
for General Grants reception will be expedited
that everything will be ready at short notice. The
work Of decorating the streets and buildings will be
commenced tomorrow, and tomorrow afternoon
various committees will meet to conclude the ar
rangements."

 WESTERN CORRESPONDENCE. LYONS, IOWA, Nov. 20, 1879.

 Ed. Enq.-You have all doubtless read as much of the ""Grant boom"" as you care to; we have been more than satisfied here. The Chi cago dailies filled from one to three broadsides for the last ten days, all about the 'Grant boom"" There were some good things done and said, the accounts of which if boiled down, could be compressed into much less space.

 Mark Twain made some good hits at the banquet that will likely be repeated One of the things he did not say at the banquet, but told on himself in private, is worth repeating. He said he was invited to grand banquet in London, that it was customary to read off the names and positions of the guests by num- Der. When some prominent name was men, toned, it would be applauded and the party would rise and acknowledge the compliment. The list comprised some 800 or more, and it's reading grew to be monotonous. He said he not ced an intelligent geRtleman sitting oppo- site him; and, to relieve the tedium, entered into conversation with him. Pretty soon he heard treWendous clapping; and, thinking some extraordinary parsonage had been ham, ed, to whom it would be discourteous not to join in paying homage, he began clapping too, with all his might. When the noise had sub sided little he asked his right-hand neighbor who it was for-""Samuel L. Clemons"" was the reply. He stopped clapping instantly, and was too much surprised to respond.

 P. D.-Very handsomely turned-Thanks 1! Your subscriber might feel inclined to write oftener if be did nut have to take back seat at the banquet, and wait till you fellows are served-(we say fellows, fer we conclude the question of sex was settled by that descrip- ton of wedding toilet few weeks since. It dampens enthusiasm when we feel inspir- ed to say something, to reflect that it will prob ably take or weeks to say it, as was the case with our last.

 The woman concerned in the wife poison- ing case Clinton, about which I wrote you sometime since, has just been sentenced to the penetentiary for life The trial of her h1s band commences to-day, and it is only ques- tion of neck with him.

 A man was brutaliy murdered in saloon in Clinton, a few days since, about 5 o'clock in the afternoon, by strangulation, then placed in a shed and locked up, and at night thrown in to an alley. The saloon keeper and wife are under arrest; also negro. The Judge called the Grand Jury together to investigate the matter so that they can be tried this term of court. The parties were seen pulling the body into lhe shed in the afternoon, and trying to resuscitate it, but supposed It was only adrunk- en man. They were all roughs, but the case was so bold and aggravated that excitement ran high, and there was strong talk of lynching thenl They will probably make short work of them, when the trial comes of, as the Judge lives in Clinton and is doubtless more or less in sympathy with the excited feelings of the populace.

 | It is said that our county has nearly double the number of representatives in the peniten- tiary of any other in the northern part of the state, and the man who made the statement, added that there were not half as many there as there ought to be. It is little too much like the man bragging over the neatness of his wife because she swept out apeck of dirt every morning.

 The young man who was ""sent up"" for burglarizing my store and the post office, to wait trial, is out on bail on two indictments, and is carrying the mails for his father, who has the contract: idea of man carrying the mails under indictment for robbIng tho D O. D., is something of an anomaly but there are powerful influences backing him and ex. pect he will be let off easy.

HOW PUBLIC BUSINESS IS TRANSACTED

An Expert on the Danger of


Dumping in the Harbor.",,"~-~~~


The exposure of the outrages perpetrated in New
York harbor made by the HERALD short time ago
has created SO many side questions that the matter
is assuming national importance. Every day new
item is added to the history of the destruction OF
the port. until it seems as though nothing could
arrest the evil but general reconstruction Of the
harbor authorities. A few years ago number of
citizens and merchants. with this end In view.
petitioned the Legislature to abolish the Dock
Department unnecessary and detrimental to
the practical government OF the harbor. By
great effort the department saved. This
fact.Inade the present Dock Commissioners fearful
that some such effort would result from the late
exposure of their negligence and culpability The
promises and penitence of the Commissioners was
most encouraging. A full investigation OF the evils
was to be made and the guilty parties brought to
Justice. Yesterday the day appointed for the
investigation At eleven o'clock the Board of G ,m-
missioners met in the large room of the Dock De-
partment. Representatives of tho press were
present and Mr.. Greene. chief engineer of the de-
partment. The meeting opened by Commits
sioner Dimock who said:-


Its very hot""


""Close atmosphere"" was the profound answer of
Secretary Lynch, who thus cinched the weighty
discussion Of public affairs.


After this nothing was said for few minutes.
when Mr.. vanderpoel. President of the Board
dered the Secretary to read the minutes of the last
meeting. This done in great haste. and finally.
after reading himself out Of BREATH Mr.. Lynch sat
down and awaited events.


""why don't you read all the communications to
tho department. said Mr.. vanderpoel, with the air
Of an injured man.


Numerous documents were then read. while the
two Commissioners, who did not seem to under
stand q word. looked though they were bored
One document was an application from Jersey
railroad company, who wish the use of the depart
ments sounding machine for the purpose Of testing
the depth of water in their docks. Another was o
complaint Of the hlling up of dock adjoining
East River dumping station. ""This"" said President
vanderpoel ..must be investigated"" Several other
communications treated in the manner.
Then every present waited for the subject of the
day to be opened. Mr.. Lynch solemnly closed the
books of the Board and nodded to Mr. Vanderpoel,
who turned to the reporters and sad:-


HOW OFFICIAL WORK IS DONE.
''Gentlemen, the investigation is over; that's all
we shall do to-day; the meeting is adjourned


This announcement was received with astonish-
ment by the reporters who asked why the question

dealt with by those whose duty is to assist in

After the meeting Commissioner Dimock said to

'For our own satisfaction.'


general impression has been current that the In
vestgation by the Dock Department would prevent
any further dumping in the bay Tho last statement
Of Mr.. Dimock dispels it. The department being
for the prosecution This department, accord
ing to gentleman who hae studied the matter ""is
relic of the dark age in which Tweed Co. ruled""


In order that no side of the trouble should be neg
ected. Mr. Charles Haswell, the marine aud civil
gineer was interviewed by reporter yesterday to
ascertain correctly the scientific points. Mr.. Haswen
found in his Office in Bowling Green.
You appear. Mr.. Haswel. said the reporter Ito
have taken great interest in the harbor question;
what have been your opportunities for observa-
tionY ft.


""As boy andman have rowed and sailed over every
part of Fort Lee and He'll Gate to Sandy Hook
have also done duty in the harbor for two periods
of two years each.""


Upon what does tho bar at Sandy Hook and the
harbor depend for the maintenance of its integrtyY


THE INFLUENCE OF TIDES IN HARBoRs.


1.-The depth OF bar and tho maintenance OF q
marine harbor depends upon the volume of the
tidal within it. That is, the volume of the





utaries above the low level. All the filing
out of bulk head lines and solid piers below this

THE NATTER OF HIS DISAPPEAR


ANCE AND FINDS SOME SUSPICIOUS


CIRCUMsTANCEs-Av VERY STRANGE


CASE.


Whea John Morris Jackson, one Of
Wilmington's well-knoxn negro boot
blacks suddenly dropped out Of the
world, so to speak, OH or about the night
of Friday June 9th Gas stated in the
GAZETTE of Tuesday, there were some
existing and transpiring circumstances
which have led his mother, and some
othrs into the ST ong belief, he having |
remained away 50 long, that he has been
d1alt with foully, and is now not among |
the living.


As has been stated in this paper, Mary |
Morris, Johns mother, had Silas Pritch-
ard and Susan his mother, both colored,
summoned before Magistrate Hagany, in
order to see if they could throw some
light upon the matter, as she believed
they could, and yesterday afternoon at 2
O'Clock, the Case came up. Nothing Of


importance was elected, aid Mrs. Nor


ris counsel withdrew the case saying it
ought to 60 before the Attorney General
as there was something in it he could
not falhom.


A GAZETTE reporter, who was pres
ent at that examination, felt sure that
| the case contained some interesting and
important points that had not tianspired,


and, far from satisfied, he entered upon a


general investigation, to which he devo.


ted the greater part of the afternoon.
| Jackson's mother was first called upon


at her humble home, No. 1l0S French


street. She i. an old woman, and is very


much worried about her son. John


Jackson, Is about twenty-seven years OF


age, and since he was three years old has


frequently been out of his head. A


short tima before the disappearance of


hn, he went to Hugh Lynch's .aloon at


Eleventh and Walnut streets, and sold


coat for counterfeit twenty-five cent


piece. Mr.. Lynch gave him the ""quar-


ter"" in fun and tried to get 1t back and


make him take the coat, when difficult


ty sprang up, which ended In John sue


ing Mr.. Lynch for assault and ba terry


before Magistrate Hagany, for which a


slight fine was imposed and payment Of


costs required. This was on the Friday


in quest on the night of which appears to


have been fatal one for John Jackson.


This far, Johns mother says she gives


""hearsay"" statement. On this Friday,


John was drunk and she saw him last, at


o'clock in the evening, when he said he


Was going away and went out the back


way.


The basement of the house was then


occupied by the Pricbard family. About


three O'Clock the next NOR ming as Mrs


Morris was sitting at her window to catch


the benefit of the night air, she saw Silas
Pnchard come down French street in a
great hurry from Tenth and burst into
the basement. He quickly awakened
his mother and sister aud took them on
L and down Eleventh street in their nigh
, dresses. Mrs. Prichard came back ant
, got dressed; and went down again an(
, then all came back and went to be;dthe,
4 talked excitedly. While Mrs. Prichar'
was gone the second time, Mrs. Morri
: looked down the street thinking there
: must be a Hte somewhere and saw a wa
3 gop. The next day, suspec ing nothing
, she asked Mrs. Prichard about the doing,
Of the night before and that woman wa,
, silent for full five minutes, wonder
!, struck. When she d. speak, she made
4 startling observation. ""Mrs. Norris,
said she, on that occasion. ""Silas saw q
wagon down the street and he came to
} me scared; he thought tina. they had i,
. there to take Johns body away in.
, | Again she said she saw them put some
thing in the wagon but would not say
| who they were.


A day or two afterwards, Mrs. Prich-
ard denied going out at all with Sila.

Mr.. Price said the time of taking the

Mr.. Norton said that there had not
been a garb .ge cart in his neighborhood

Mr.. Townsend said that in relation to

he came; Mrs. .Ziegler appeared perfect
lady; was very nice and quiet in her
manner since she had bsen in my house


Mrs. Richards a neighbor who had
been called in by Mrs. Miller, corrobo-
rated that lady as to the time and
manner Of birth OF the child.


Upon motion 1t was decided that the
Coroner, Foreman of the Jury and the
go up to the roosa where the
young mother was lying, and take her
testimony. This was done and upon
their return, the testimony which was
mainly relative TO the age Of the child,
and hence unfit for publication, was
read by the secretary.


DR.. Blocksom was then sworn, and
testified to being called unexpectedly
and found the child born when he ar
rived; in his opinion the child had been
dead about three weeks previous to its
birth. He was Of the opinion that this
the mother had undergone

was about seven months and week
old, when it died making 1t now at birth

In answer to question the Doctor
that he did not believe that
the mother had taken any medicine or
done anything to bring about the
death of the child. One Of the jurors
asked the Doctor whether she had said
any thing to him about the par entage
Df the child?


DR.. Blocksom-Yes she said emphat-
cally that it was Louis P. Lynch.


A discussion here arose among the
ury- as to whether it was their duty
o ask the mother relative to the par

squire that 1t was Louis p. Lynch,

question, and eight opposed it. 1t was

II being generally known that the
trial Of Mrs. Ziegler for perjury, brought
Al the instigation Of Louis P. Lynch,
would take place yesterday afternoon,
thu pavement in front Of Squire Berto-
lette's office was densely crowded. In
order to get front seats the curious were
0n hand early, and strange to say those
occupying the softest seats aud warmest
corners and hanging lingeringly over the
,.lnsgistsrial railing were gray-haire
men and respectable heads of families.


The little boy, insinuating his pens-


trating frame over the threshold, en-
..dsavoring to sight the interior caught
only the bobbing heads of those gray
haired sires.


On the outside, sitting room on steps
and curb stones was as much in de-
mand as front seats at a female min
strel show. At three o'clock Mrs. Iieg-
lsr's attorney, Austin Harrington, ap-
peared, and latt-rly the spruce figure of
Street Commissioner Lynch. Expecta-
tion was heightened, and when the
word was passed from the gray haired
sirss in front down to the little boy in
the door way, along the sitters on the
.,curbstone and over to the group Of po-
licemen on the opposite corner, tha:
Mrs. Ziegler had waived hearing,
there wa q general murmur of disap-


pointment.


The Squire fixed the bail at $1,000.
There was some hesitation, in the pro-
,oesdings caused by misunderstood
ing in securing sureties. Messrs. Tully
and Shortiss were the proposed SURF
ties. Bail was subsequently furnished.
After this the crowd slowly dispersed.


WILL COUNCIL ACT.


The question whether City Council
will this evening appoint a committee
TO investigate the alleged incorporate
proceedings of those who have made
u practice Of rioting at the city Hos
pital is being discussed among all cir
oles. The sentiment of the people is
awakened and the action OF Council
will be looked to with great deal of
interest.


Since the exposition Of the disgrace
1. ful affair We have obtained other evi-
dence which establishes the truth OF
the declaration that the legitimate pur-
poses of the institution were prostituted
and the peace and welfare OF the pa
ti""nts therein greatly disturbed.


TURNED INTO A DANCE HoUsE.


ln proof Of this We mention the occa-
sion on which tha hospital was let out
to several parties and dance held in
one of the largest rooms. This was
shortly before Christmas. The parties |
to whom the rooms were loaned consist |
ed Of a quartette of ladies, whose names
We have before us. Those ladies issued
written invitations, and as result some
thirty or forty couple responded. The
music for the occasion was furnished by
Mr.. Howard Signs. The entertainment
began early and the musical sLufile of
aying feet could be heard issuing from
the interior Of the hospital way up
among the early hours Of the following



TIE fact of the affair bsiDg secret is
borne to us in the information that dur
ing the night some of the dancers
opened one of the windows whereupon
,le Of the ladies of the institution came
iown and closed it, saying as she did 4,
10 that sit wonld not do as the people |
would inform"" There was no charge I
made tor the use Of the rooms. During !
l. ,ermissions in the dance refreshments
n the character of sandwiches and cof-
ee were served up. They were fur
lishsd by tho party themselves. We {
laye the names of the gentlemen who /
vere in attendance with ladies but r
will withhold them, at least for the I
present. II

A stated meeting of City Council was
held last evening President Lichten-

ably on petition of h. L. Moore, 1or
donation of the stone from the 18th and
Orange St., lot.


Favorably on that of D. i. Bucking-
ham. for permission to construct vault

On the petition of W. H. Best and
others, for the curbing and paving OF
the north side of Beach St., the com
mittse reported that an order for the


work had been passed year ago, but
IL had been delayed on account OF the


building Of sewer. !


On motion Of Mr.. Guthrie, chairman OF


the committee on conference with Levy


Court, the report, which was laid over


at previous meeting, was taken up


MIR. Paynter member OF the COM


mittee then reported the following:


The undersigned minority of your


Committee to confer with the Levy


court of New Castle county, i'll reier-


ence to site for the proposed new


Court House, respectfully recommend


the donation OF two hundred feet Oh the
lot. corner of Eleventh and Market


streets, from any other portion OF old
basin lot sufficient for the county tulld-
!. ines, but reserving the right to put the


necessary buildings for the use OF the
city on the lot whenever the citizens
:. may decide TO do so, or the lot at Sixth
a and King streets, running back to the
city prison or the public square on the


east side of BrOome street between

's s Mr.. psynter didn't want to have an
81 discussion upon the matter, for he wa
y, willing that it should be put to vot


upon its merits. He objected to til


majority port on the ground that,


give the whole basin property was III


necessary. The Levy Court have bee


IMPRESSED with the belief that tn


city was willing to give the whole 10

,,a m sertions made by that Committee.

Who is to Blame7",,"Our readers have doubtless seen a horri-
BILE story which is now going the rounds of
the papers of the murder last week, of a
young girl, modest, educated and the child
OF respectable family, who, at camp
meeting IN Susquehanna county, Penn,
was decoyed into the woods and became
the victim OF a gang of rutiians, most
OF them the sons of farmers in the neigh
borhood. They left her dying and uncon-
cious at her fathers door.


In the South and West, lynch law would
no doubt before now have punished these
men, and even in slow moving Pennsylvania
they are sure to meet their deserts, But
there is somebody else to blame besides
these inhuman brutes. There are men
with the instincts of animals in every COM
munlty, and it is time that women who
have daughters to care for recognized that
fact, and guarded them more closely than
Is the custom in this country. This young
girl, who as is alleged, was of good social
position, sets off to a camp meeting
with another girl, her sister; one of them
drives home across the country with a
young man, the other takes a walk by
moonlight with another fellow, both mem.
bers OF this gang of villains. The parents
supposing that she is safe in the holy pre-
cIhcIs Vi the camp meeting, 90 not trouble
| themselves about her for a day or two.
There is not another civilized country
where such latitude would be permitted to
virtuous, unmarried women yet here it is
not the exception but the rule. In villages
and farm districts there is a perpetual
junketing, from which the old folks are
shut out, and incessant free-and easy inter
course between the sexes In the majority
of cases no actual harm comes of it, but
occasionally we have a tragedy like the
present. American mothers have such
absolute faith in their daughters that they
throw them headlong into the very jaws of
temptation; forgetting that American hus-
bands would prefer to receive them from
some other place. If all men were born as
men were born at the outset Christian
gentlemen and so died, this lax way of
bringing up women would still be foolish
and in bad taste but while there are such
men as the ruffians of Montrose, it is sim.
ply criminal. The same instinct in men
which led to the murder of this girl, in q
more refined society leads them to suspect
and malign unprotected women whose in


nocent freedom Of manner gives ground
for their ISLANDERS. That innocense is o.


little value in the world which the worlC


mistakes for guilty.. Y. Tribune, 18Th inst"

not our public roads free for travel for

to the person who walks? Is no. the

Was there not already law enough to
arrest and fine or imprison any human
being that invaded the premises of an
other and done any damage, or refused to
leave when directed, or commit

person on the highway? Then why

The Indian returned to Plano with
Townsend's saddle and bride on
his horse, which were identified
He was arrested and acknowledged
committing the deed. A party ol
whites went to the mountains with
the Indian to where Townsend was
killed and found the remains. The
murderer was then taken down

other report has it that Townsend
was killed by two Indians with
knives, and that they were hung In

FoRT KEoaH, Montana, June 8.-The dis
trict court met at Miles City, May 81, and
the first case brought before it was that of
White Neck and Elkhsad, two Gros Ventres
Indians, who shot and killed one Lynch, a
ranchman, on the Yellowstone river, some
time since. White Neck pleaded guilty to
murder in the first degree, and was sem
fenced to be hanged at Miles City, July 7, at
O'Clock. Elkhead pleaded not guilty, and
was found guilty of granddaughter, and sem
fenced to ten years. imprisonment in the
penitentiary.


The next case was of the three Cheyenne
Indians who murdered Private Leo Baader,
Company E, Second cavalry, last April.
They were named Hole-in- Breast, Strong
Neck and Black Wolf. They were. all found
guilty of murder in the first degree, and
sentenced to be hanged on July 2, at 10
o'clock. The day after they had received
their sentence (June s. they we're placed in
cells, together with the Gros Ventres, who
had been sentenced, and were so arranged
that two Cheyennes Hole -in-Breast and
Strong Neck were alone in one cell. In
the morning of the 9Th, when the jailor
went to look after them, ais was his custom,
he was Mortified to find Strong Neck hanging
by his neck by strap fastened to the ceiling
while Hole-in- Breast lay apparently asleep
in the corner; but on examination both were
found cold and stiff. From all appearances,
Strong Neck must have stood by and watch
ed the dying movements and convulsions Of
Hole-in- Breast, and, after life was extinct in
him, took him down, laid him in the corner
and then hung himself with the same strap
which was about six feet long, and which
they managed to conceal in some way from
the jailor.

WASHINGTON, April 6.-The motion by
Mr.. Springer, of the committe of the whole,
reporting back the army appropriation bill
with sundry amendments, with recommends
tiors that the amendments be concurred in,
and the bill as amended be passed, made at
8 o'clock yesterday afternoon, was the cul-
mination of a noticeable debate in the his
tory of the House. lasting for nearly ten
days, in the course of which the best talent
on both sides was put forward, and express
sion was given to the bitterest partisan feel
ing, and the widest possible difference on
the points involved. That troops should no
longer be used for the intimidation of voters
was decided upon in committee of the whole,
and this action was clinched in the House by
a yea and nay vote of 14S to 122, the Demo
Gratis and Greenbackers voting solidly for it.
When, after the army bill had been disposed
Of and the House adjourned until Tuesday
next, cutting off all possible chance for the
Greenbackers to introduce any financial
legislation for a week longer at least, tho
latter put on look of blank CONSERVATION,
as if they had been


BADLY oUTwITTED AND SOLD OUT.


They had in caucus passed resolution
opposing the political section of the bill e1-
cept as separate measure, but they finally
determined to vote for the bill with 1t on
condition that they should have an oppor-
tunlty to introduce financial bills. MIR.
Sparks, of Illinois, made strong speech de-
nying that the proposed legislation was a
eosrcion Of the action of the President. On
the contrary, if the President vetoed the bill
Io loI bat

made to coerce the President, they had been
made by the


STALWART MEMBERS


Of the minority party. He read from Chi
cago paper to the effect that the Republicans
were trying to stifen the backbone OF the
President 1t was feared, Mr.. Sparks said,
that he did not have backbone enough. de
read from the same Chicago paper head
ing, ""Victory for the Democrats and Howl
ING Rebels.'' An election had come on and
the victory had been gained by the ""Demo-
Gratis and bowling rebels'' in that locality
where the Republicans wanted to stifen the
backbone of his exce!lency. The result had
indicated that instead of putting ramrods in
to his backbone, it had taken all the marrow
and stiffness out of their own. The issue
was whether or not in this free country
armed soldiers, paid servants of the SOW
ereign people, were to come to the polls to


DRIVE THE SOVEREIGN PEOPLE AWAY.
That was the issue, and the election IN
Chicago had been the first popular response,
and from Republican city it had been start
ling in it's character. An amendment offered
by MIR. Baker of Indiana, proposing to re-
,l,olo Of InfArflrAnPA
by imposing fresh penalties for campaign
disturbances, was ruled out of order by
Chairman Springer, on the ground that it
related entirely to unofficial persons having
no connection whatever with the army, and
prescribed a criminal code in reference to
interfering with persons in the exercise of
the right to VOTE It had been stated that if MIR.
Bakers amendment was not adopted there
would be nothing on the statute books
to protect a citizen on his right to vote. Mr..
Springer caused to be read sections 55O6,
55O7 and 551O of the revised statutes, which
impose much severer penalties upon persons
interfering with elections than the amend
ment of Mr.. Baker, the existing law being
ample for the protection of the rights OF
voters. After the committee had risen the
main question was ordered, the Republicans
not attempting to flibuster. The question
was asked if a vote should be taken on the
amendments separately, and Mr.: Garfield
himself replied, ""Oh, no."" and asked that 9
vote be taken at once upon the bill as re-
ported from the committee, which was done
and the bill passed.

said we're furnished with tax receipts
aud they voted. OF coarse We meant
that the receipts furnished them were
fraudulent, a. no person whose name
had been left off the assessment for two

seat of Alvan Allen from the Fifth
Ward. soa


The clerk started to read the protest,
when Mr.. Paynter arose and moved tnat
the further reading of the protest be dis
pensed with. and that it be noted on the
minutes. His reasons for so doing was
that il was found upon careful examin-
alton thirty-two Of the forty-four names
that were given in the protest Of Henry
Evans, as having voted illegally, were
regularly assessed and were entitled TO
vote. He supposed the protest Of MIR. !
Gawthiop was similar TO that of Mr. Ev-
ans, and he did not think it right to pub
ish the names of gentlemen as having vo-
ted illegally, when they were entitled to
vote. The protest might be read but he
would certainly ask that the names be
withheld from the newspapers.


Mr.. Rodney said he had not examined
the protest of Mr.. Gawthrop, but he un-
derstood that it was entirely different |
from Mr.. Evans. lie thought it ought |
to be read.


Mr.. r. H. Taylor said that he had
heard that large number of the names
on the protest of Mr.. Evans were legal
voters. He had also heard from good
authority that a gentleman whose name
appeared on the protest of Mr.. Evans, as
having voted Illegally, went to that gen
tleman and asked that his name be taken
of, as he was legal voter. Mr.. Evans
told the gentleman that If he would go to


Mr.. Bye, that his name would be taken


of, that he (Evans) knew nothing about


the matter. He was opposed to the


names being read, as he did not think 1t


right that man should be branded


criminal uDheard. The penalty for lille


gal voting was very heavy, and also for


making false affidavit. There was


likely to be lawsuits now over the mat


ter. 1t would be time enough to publish


the names when the gentlemen were


proven to have voted illegally.


Mr.. Merrls Taylor said he had no OBJ


jections to the petition being read, and


tue names spread broadcast throughout


the county. If a gentleman will 60 for


ward and make affidavit to facts which


they know nothing about, they should


bear the brunt and not this Council.


Mr.. Rodney said lie had no objections


to the names being suppressed, but


thought the protest should be read as an


act OF courtesy. ..as.y


Mr.. McGlinchey said that if Mr.. Ev-
ans would 60 forth aud make solemn


oath TO things he knew nothing about
why he knew Mr.. Gawthrop was likely
, to do the same thing. He thought the
whole thing was very unfortunate, be-


cause the two gentlemen had fallen into
the hands of a few politicians who were
creating all this mischief.


Mr.. Chandler SAID that If the gentle
men named were guilty Of voting Illegal
ly, they no doubt would be proven so,
7 and if innocent, likewise.


The motion of Mr.. Paynter was adop-
ted.
On motion of Mr.. Rodney, Monaay
evening October 18th, was set apart fol
hearing the evidence and considering the
} protest.

PROVED TO FUND IT.",,"


PROVED TO FUND IT.


City Council held special meeting
last evening, for the purpose of consider
ing o bill for presentation to the General
Assembly, to fund the floating debt OF the
city, At rate Of interest not to exceed 8
per cent.


In the absence Of President Lichten-
stein, MIR. Guthrie, was ON motion Of
Col. Lynch called to the chair.


His Honor, the Mayer, then read the
call for the meeting, aud at the conclu-
sion, Mr.. McGlinchey, chairman OF the
Committee ON Legislation, stated that on
Thursday evening last the Committee on
Legislation we're instructed TO prepare an
act IN conformity, with the resolution of
Mr.. Guthrie, In regard to funding the
floating debt Of the city.


To conform to the resolution he offered
the following act, or bill, which on his
motion was read:


a further supplement TO an act entitled
an act to limit the debt Of JVumington,
and proride for the discharge thereof:


Be it enacted, by tho General Assem-
bly,, two thirds Of each House thereof
concurring:


Section l. That the Mayor and City
Council of Wilmington shall have power
and authority under an ordinance OF City
Council, to he passed with the concur
renee Of two-thirds Of all the members
thereof for the time ,being to borrow a
sum or sums of money not exceeding In
the aggregate $145, 900 which shall be an
addition to the present funded debt Of
the city, and which shall be appropriated
iaA
OF as may be necessary for the purposes
Of paying the present floating aud un-
funded Indebtedness incurred by and for
the city Of Wilmington, and may issue
bonds thereof at rate Of interest not ex-
ceeding I've per cent. per annufn, which
bonds shall not be subject TO taxation for
city, county or municipal purposes, the
bonds 10 be made payable at such time
or timee, and in such manner rs the Or
dinance may prescribe.


Section 2,-The surplus if any, of the
money borrowed under the authority of
this act, which shall remain after the
payment Of the present floating unfund-
ed Indebtedness of said city of Whining
ton, for which purpose 1t is hereby specl-
fically appropriated, shall be used and
appropriated in the payment Of bonds of
the city Of Wilmington due and falling
due, and the interest thereon, and for no
other purpose whatsoever.


Section 3.-Whenever under the pro-
visions of section 46, chapter 73 of the
Revised Code, an extraordinary appro-
priation shall be made by City Council,
the amount SO appropriated, shall be
paid out of the taxes, rents or receipts of
the year then current, If the same shall
be sufficient; and, in case the amount of
any such extraordinary appropriation
shall be In excess Of the taxes, rents, ORE
ceipts of the said city for the year in
which such extraordinary appropriation
shall be made, such excess shall be pro-
vided for and included in the appropria-
ton made and taxes levied for the sue
ceeding year.


During the reading of the bill, Presi- |
dent Lichtenstein entered and assumed
the chair.


At the conclusion of the reading of
the act, Mr.. McGlinchey said that in or
der to bring the matter before Council
he moved that the bill be endorsed.


At the suggestion of the chair the bill |
was read and adopted by sections, and |
then adopted as a whole.


Mr.. Guthrie said that the Finance and |
Legislative Committees had held joint |
and bad obtained the opinion of |
the City Solicitor, in regard to funding |
the floating debt, and he had given his |
opinion that the Council could not fund |
an antici ated debt, and that was the |
reason the committee had concluded to |
ask for sl45,0O0.


The sections were then adopted, and |
upon the final passage of the bill Mr.. |
McGinchey called for the ayes and |
nays, and before calling them Mr.. Chand-
Ter said that he did not like the bill as
read The Finance Committee ask for |
s145. 900. when s25, 900 of that has been !
provided for. He was opposed to fund
ing any debt but the floating debt.


Mr.. Norton was opposed TO funding |
any debt unless there were some means |
provided tor to prevent future Councils |
from borrowing or creating another |
floating debt After some further re-
marks by Messrs. Paynter, Taylor, Price |
and Chandler, the bill passed by the fol- |
lowing vote:


Aves-M essrs. Adams Chandler, NJ oore,
Downing, Evans Guthrie, Hart, Heusted,
Jones. Knight, Lynch, Walton, McGiin-
chey, Paynter, Price, Rowe, Taylor
Townsend and President Lichtenstein.


Nays-Mr. Norton. Il


Mr.. McGinchey presented ed, and and had
Education, az amended by the joint COM
mittees, and on his motion the Council
endorsed the bill.


Mr.. McGlinchey presented resolu- |
ton setting forth the bills that the Coun- |
Gil had concurred In and asking their |
passage at the hands, of the Legislature,
also asking the Legislature not to pass |
any bill affecting the powers of the May |
or and Council of Wilmington, unless |
first asked for by the Council.


The resolutions were unanimously |
adopted upon the call Of the ayes and /
nays.


On motion OF Mr.. McGlnchey the |
Committee ON Legislation were granted |
the privilege of amending the bill in re-
gard to changing the grades OF streets
without calling . town meeting, by In
serring in the clause that no existing
grade shall be altered or esta aolished
without a two-thirds vote Of Council.
The clause at present reads that the
grades can be changed by majority
vote OF Council. IL


Mr.. Chandler SAID that while Council
was asking the Legislature to pass
number Of bills, he thought that they
had forgotten one thing, and that was
that they should ask the Legislature to
allow Wilmington two members OF the
House and one of the Senate at all
times.


Mr. Taylor said he agreed with the"

NEW BUSINESS.


Under the call for new business. Mr..
Paynter stated that the Water Depart
ment now had in its possession safe that
was not secure. The department now
has about $4,000 or $25 600 uncollected
accounts 81 andng upon Its books, auo
about $780, OF accounts altogether and
the Water Committee were OF the opinion
that new sale was greatly needed but
they did not feel that ii one was purchas-
cd that the cost should come out of their
appi opriatiOn, but out ofthe general fund
as the money collected at the water office
goes into the general fund. The Com
miltee also feel that II the books were de-
stroyed they would lose nothing indi-
vidually, but the city would lose. AT
present If the books were left on the
counter at night and fire should occur,
the watchinan might save them, but if
they We're locked up in the old safe, there
would be no hopes Of sa ing them.


lie had no motion TO make but he Just
gave his Suggestions as hint to Coun-
Gil what they might expect Ill case of a
fire.


In answer to a question as to how
much the safe would cost, he stated that
the committee could get one large enough
for their use, for $3.50, as the agent pro-
posed TO allow $50 for the one now in
use.


Mr.. Guthrie said he hoped that Coun-
Gil would not get extravsgant all at once.
The safe right be neede d but he thought
there were other departments in the city
that needed safes equally as bad. One
of collectors has no place TO keep his
books, but scattered upon his desks.
The City Auditor also needed one.
There being no motion before the
Council, the debate was stopped for the
lime being.


On motion of Mr.. Guthrie the proper
officers were instructed to draw one note
$4,000 to Philip Quigley, and one for
$4,000 to John Peoples, 10 meet notes
Of like amount falling due.
Mr.. Norton offered the follow resolu-
| tion which was adopted:
Resolred, That the Public Building
| Committee, be and they are hereby ill.,
| structed, to make a report TO the Council
| at its next stated meeting, Oh the petit
ton of Jacob Sharp and Others.
CThe petition referred to, is in refer
ence to allowing farmers to sell meat OH
| the stre.ts.)


The question of a safe for the Water
Department, was again revived by Mr..
Lynch, who said the Chairman of the
Water Committee had informed Council
that there was over $50, 200 Oh the books
at the Water Department, and that the
safe that was used to lock the books in
was not safe in case of fire. He thought
in view of that fact, that it would be
economy to purchase a safe, and he
would therefore move that the commit
tee be authorized to purchase a safe, and
tbs cost not exceed $685. the amount
10 be taken from the appropriation for
Incidental and Miscellaneous expen-
ses.


Mr.. McGlinchey, desired to know if
the appropriation could stand it.


Mr.. Guthrie moved that the matter be
postponed uLtil January 1st 1880.


Mr.. Paynter said that The safe now in
the department was worthless, and had
been reported so from time to time. He
was only looking after the ci,y's interest.


Mr.. Guthrie thought that if new safe
was to be purchased, that the old one
had better be removed to the tax co,lec-
tors office, and not be sold.


Mr.. Norton moved to amend by max
Ing the amount $500 instead of $3.50, ii
the old safe was not to be sold. Mr..
Adams thought that if the safe was not fit
to keep the water department books in
it was not safe TO keep the tax collectors
books In.


MIR. Hart was of the opinion that it


would be useless to transfer the old safe
to the tax collectors office, as it was MT


worth it.


Mr., Norton withdrew his amendment.


MIR. Guthrie, wanted to know the use
of borrowing money to pay OIL debts and


turn around and buy safes.


Mr.. Chandler called for the ayes and


nays, and the motion of Mr.. Lynch, that
committee be authorized to purchase


safe, at cost not to exceed SZ3o was

 Holland and Casey all have desper. ate friends, and some of them are not without means and inauetce; and no effort will be left untried to pro cure the release or escape of the men. A strong guard will be neces, sary to keep them, and a heavy expense will be entailed upon the county; 'Changes of venue,"" Con tinuations,"" and ottier ""delays of the law"" will be taken advantage of to gain time, to wear out the vigilatce of guards, and to give the guilty wretches opportunity to escape. It is this uncertainty of punishment, and delay IT administering 1t, com bined with morbid and sickly sen- timental sympathy for a shackled villain ,who has done some great crime. that is making desperate, bad meu, bolder and bolder every day. We deprscate mob law. We do not believe in the populace taking the law into their own hands. We can not afford to sec the courts of justice supplanted by Judge Lynch-but, when we see the case 50 plainly made out as it is in this instance, it looks like great hardship upon the county 10 have to hold confessed murderers ESQ long at heavy ex- pense, 10 say nothing of the hazard of their escape and future depreda- tons.

 In view of these facts cannot an extra term, or special session, of the Circuit Court and grand jury he held in Yell county at once to dis pose of this case? If such a thing can be done under our law, it should be done at once. There should be no delay, no dilly -dallving, no legal technlcalities thrown in the way of the swift and stern execution of the merited punishment npon the perpe- trators of this awful crime. If there is, the people will have cause to lose confidence in the protection which the law is supposed to throw around their lives, and they will be forced to resort to the God givenAnherent right which all men have to protect their own lives by such means as they can command.

 Here is Helphrey's confession.

 am the man that killed Burgess James. I killed him for his money. on Saturday night before killed him 1 had conversation with James Hol land and William Kaiser at Hollands gin, in Cardon's Bottom. They ad- vised me to do it, and said that they had been working it up for six months themselves and would have done it, but they were suspected. We drank considerable whiskey dur Ing the time. They told me that James generally carried about sl, 300 about his person, and also what name I should assume, and where l could find him. We had an other talk next morning and Kaiser gave me pistol and Holland little mon- ey, and both parties said they would die by me and swear me out and do anything to save me if got into trouble and so 1 started on Sunday morning to do the deed. l found Burgess in the uplands, as he has stated, about sundown, claimed to be his cousin, and came back into the river bottom with him. We travelled and talked along about different sub jects till near midnight intend cd to kill James all the time, but ha- ted,to do it. l couldn't get my cour- age up to the point. l was under the influence of whiskey most of the time. I showed Burgess the pistol and asked him to buy it. He took it and examined it, but didn't want 1t. When We sat down to rest thellast time conciud .e then was the time to kill him, and pulled out the pistol and said it had killed one man and that was going to kill him with it. I said this because I hated to kIll him without letting him know it.

 WASHINGTON ITEMS.

 Secretary Thompson has submitted to the President his annual report on naval affairs. He speaks with much . pride of the education given in America to naval cadets, their instruction being equal to that obtained in any other na- t1on. Suggestions are made about inn provements in methods at the Naval Academy. The sale of many ships of the Navy is recommended, the proceeds to be devoted to the building of new ships. The building of special boat for target practice is recommended. The condition of the Navy has greatly inn proved during the last year. There are now in commission thirty five vessels, ,con- sistlng of cruisers, monitors and torpedo boats. Of the different classes sixteen can be put in condition for sea service ln few months, and twenty could be made ready in an emergency. With this done, the fighting force of the Navy which might bs made available in very short time would consist of eighty one vessels of all classes. And if to this number be added the four monitors Terror, Puritan, Amphitrite and Monadnock, and eight powerful tugs which can be fitted for either cruisers Gr torpedo boats, our whole effective lighting force would consist of ninety three vessels. The monitors could be completed, with the necessary appropria. nons, without much delay. Of the vessels now used as receiving ships seven are united for any other service. There are tWenty-seven vessels united for naval purposes of any kind whatever, but which are positive expense, as it is necessary to keep in employment of force of ship Keepers to preserve them from entire destruction. The estimate of expenses for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1881, aggregates $l4, 864, 147, showing an ex- cess over the appropriations for the previous year of $361, ,897. This excess IS accounted for by the fact that the es- innate for the pay of the Navy was re- duced $106, 725 in the appropriations i; that $9O, ,000 will be required by the system of training boys for the Navy,"

The first accident in q submarine


dress which has occurred in these wa


ters took place this afternoon of Point


Judith. John Walters, the well'known


wrecker, went of early this morning td


the sunken Block Island mail packet


Thomas J. Lynch which sunk of tina,


place about two weeks ago for the pur-


pose of raising her. His diver, Horace


Manchester, 80 years Of age, went down
early i. the day, AMI apparently en-
deavored to make all the necessary AZ
rangements to tighten the wreck. No
thing was heard from him for some
time, and the persons on board the
wrecking schooner Young America Ie,
gan to get alarmed. The life line kept
in hands which vainly tried to feel the
least pnlsation, bat none was felt from
the unfortunate man who was eighty
four feet below, that being tho depth Of
water where the craft sank. After he
had been down about e-quarters Of
an hour he gave signal that he was
all right. In a few moments he wanted
more air, and then he signalled that he
was having too much. His Signals
were faithfully answered by Captain
Walters, who is known in all wrecking
companies between here and New York
as o man who understands his busi-
ness.


The revenue cutter Samuel Dexter,
hove in sight, and seeing the flag at
halfmast on hoard the Young America
bore down to her. She was Immediate
ly despatched tc this port for q diver,
gear and attendant, which was furnish
ed by Captain Ramsay, United States
Navy, commandSnt at the torpedo sta
tion. The diver, Augustus Feliess,
promptly volunteered to 60 down in
search Of the missing man. He was
soon submerged, but returned afier a
lapse Of about twenty minutes terribly
exhausted. He reported that he raw
the man suspended about five feet over
the sunken vessel, the air line having
been caught by hook in the boat. He

went down again and succeeded in dis
engaging the line. At last the lifsless
remains OF the diver were free, and as
soon as the signal was given they were
hoisted to the deck OF the vessel. The
body was brought here at encs by the
cutter and placed in the hands Of an
undertaken. The diver when he came
up the second time, was found to be
extremely exhausted. It is believed
that the deceased was engaged in TAX
ing out the ballast when the line sud
denly became entangled.


Captain Waters is Of the opinion
that the man, who went down with
selnc little misgiving, owing TO the
depth Of the water, became frightened
at some disarrangelnent, and died in a
lit. The face Of the man shows that he
died terrible death. His body vii!
be taken to the residence Of his wife
and only child, in Tiverton, to,mor-
row."

tent to murder. still survives. though without hope
OF recovery. The eleven wounds she received were
stanched, but it is scarcely possible that the most
careful medical attention her, as several OF
the stabs considered fatal The attempted muir
der creates the most intense excitement among the
italian residents of the city. among whom both the
parties well known.


DETAILS OF THE sTABBISG.


1t has transpired to-day that the motive of
Baccigalupo. who had married the woman two
weeks ago. was to quietly rid himself of her and at
the same time obtain possession of her money and
property, amounting to some few thousand dollars.
In order TO accomplish this design he bought
ticket TO Washington and announced to his wife that
he was going to Illinois, to- be absent for four
months. He took his baggage and left by the morn
ing train, but upon reaching Milford, sixty miles
from here. he got of and returned late in the
ing by freight train.


MURDERoUs ATTACK.


Upon arriving he went secretly. to the store de-
coyed his wife out down the street and around the
corner to dark recess the canal basin bank.
where he made the murderous attack already de-
Scrlbed in the HERALD. He attempted to throw the
unfortunate woman into the canal after stabbing
her, but did not succeed and he forced to jump
in and swim to the opposite bank himself in the effort
emerged from the water. His object, only thus
partially carried out to leave town he did,
publicly. come back secretly. kill his wife, go of
again and then return again when he heard OF her
murder. and thus avert suspicion from himself.
The greatest excitement prevails, and numerous
pressions OF desire to lynch him have been made."

particulars OF an unfortunate affair
caused by love, jealousy and revenge,
which occurred at Pine Ridge Agency
day before yesterday, have just reached
this place. 1t appears that two brothers
named Billy and Johnny Provost, en-
ployed at the agency, the former as
stock superintendent, became enamored
of beautiful Indian girl named Soet-
tewa (Little BirdD, daughter OF Eagle
Wing, a sub-chief in Red Clouds band
of Sioux. Before giving his onsent, as
is the custom among lndi ms, Eagle
Wing demanded a horse as the price OF
his daughters hapd III marriage.


Billy Provost not having horse to
give, consulted an Indian, who gave
him horse as his own which in reality
belonged to man named Clement Ber-
nard, who, unknown to him, was also
suing for the affections of the dusky
maiden. Following the Indians advice,
he took the animal and delivered it to
Eagle Wing, and was about to take his
prize when Bernard appeared on the
scene, claiming his property and putting
stop to further ceremonies. Provost,
after finding out that he had been de-
ceived, and being elected from the lodge
by the chief, seized with grief and re-
morse, placed pistol to his head and
blew his brains out.


John Provost, the interpreter, on
learning of his brothers. suicide, sought
out the Indian who betrayed him and
Bernard, his rival, intending to kill
them. Finding both in the agents
office, he deliberately and without warn
ing opened fire on them, killing Bernard.
Several Mexicans, countrymen Of, the
murdered man, surrounded the murder
er and would have lynched him had it
not been for the prompt action of DR..
McGillicuddy, the Indian Agent, who
sent him under a guard of Indian sol
diers to the military guard-house at
Camp Sheridan, where he now awaits

CINCINNATI, March 16, 1s79.-Tle
little city Of Newport, KY, lying oppo-
site Cincinnati, was this evening he
| scene Of an example Of summary justice
or summary vengeance rather--in the
executian of man named Peter Klein,
for having committed an outrage on Mrs.
TruesdelI, in the outskirts of the village


more than week ago. The crime was


a most atrocious one, and as soon as II


was discovered the threat was made gem
eral that if the person who committed it


was caught he would be lynchcd. Yes


terday Klein was captured in this city,


having In his possession a watch and


other articles stolen from Mrs. Truesdell


and upon lhei"" being identified he con-


fessed he had committed the crime
Officers here, without waiting for requ-


sition from the Gogernor of the State,


put him in hack and took him across


the river to Newport and delivered him


to the jailor. A crowd soon after gather


ed around the Jail and proposed to re-


move him by force and take hlm up to


Mrs. Truesdell's house for indenification
with the threat that If identified they


would hang him.


He again confessed his guilt to the
prison attendant and ask. ID to be pro-


tected. This forenoon a crowd Of seve-


raj hundred gathered around the Jail,
| threatening to take him out, and messen-
gers were despatched to Alexandria for
the Sheriff and a possee of officers to


come and protect the building.


THE LYNCHING.


The crowd grew larger during the af-
ternOon until about six o'clock this even
ing, when the Iingleaders, in the midst
Of binding snow storm, forced their
way into the cell where Klein was con-
fined, dragged him out more dead than


alive, hurried him along the streets, fol-


lowed by a crowd of 1000 men, and


marched out to the highlands, where he
had committed the crime, distance Of
two miles from the jail. Arriving there
they took him into the presence of his
victim, where he was fully identified by
her. The unfortunate man again COLI


fessed that he was guilty Of the crime,
and plead for mercy, but without avail,


as the crowd, without more ado, hustled
him out back of the house. While get
ting ready to hang him he was fired at
by several and his body riddled with bull


lets. Then a rope was placed around


his neck and he was hung upto the limb
of tree. lie died in about twenty min


utes Klein had just served term in


the penitenfiary for similar crime, hav-
ing been out only few weeks."

risge track.


The strange part Of it is that two
year ago last April on Sunday, this
man Drnby, the individual who per-
formed this deed Of humanity for Tenn
pie, should be on the same day Of the
week in nearly the same day Of the
month, of these subsequent years, killed
upon almost the same spot where lie in
human kindness drew from danger Of
desecration the bleeding form Of his
friend Temple. Almost the first ones
upon the spot after the news Of the
murder had been spread extensively,
was Walter Finn, in company with
one Of the other prisoners. Sergeant
Dolan and juryman Eugene Lynch
were present at the time, and noted
with some interest their actions and
the latter heard Finn exclailn over the
dead body: ""Why he looks as much
like William DENLY IS to be DENLY
himself"" 1t was shortly after this
that Finn was arrested as being q
principal in the crime.


The prisoners srs all young men,
about twenty and twenty-one years Of
age and sll have parents. Although
never fguring in the police court, they
are known to the officers as parties who
bear the closest watching. About the
time they we're arrested, officer Jones,
III company with several other officers,
proceeded to the farm Of Randolph
Peters, who lives about two miles from
Market street bridge, and arrested the
three young men who were with Dem
by. They were very much praised,
es pecially Alonzo Demby, whs was 50
badly injured that it was with the
greatest difficulty that he could be
brought. This young man had one eye
completely slsssd and the ether badly
damaged, besides sustaining other 81.
rious injuries. Samuel Clark and
Charles Washington were each cut
badly about tho head, injured as If
with some sharp instrument. The ar
rest OF these three was brought about
by the finding Of young Demby's coat
BY the side of his faith or, and the ha. Of
enc Of tho other young men in the
ditch where the old man had been
thrown.


Perry Demby, as the evidence 'of
Randolph Peters goes to show was an
old man who had come to this city from
Smyrna, where his family had been
raised. He was respected and looked
up to by all his fellow workmsn as
sons would to father, and would frem
him take all manner Of just oensure
in tho spirit in which it was given.
After the cultivating season would
close, Perry, who generally saved his
money, would 90 back to smyrna,
where he had one child living and live
through the windower and care for the
education of the boy. His age has not
been learned to certainty but no
is supposed to be over sixty.


THE JURY.


About ten o'clock the coroner having
secured all the witnesses that were
necessary proceeded to the spot. Tho
following gentlemen he summoned as
jurors and being all present were
sworn over The corps as it lay upon the
embankment: Thomas J. Bennett, fore
man; Jordan A. Wilson, William d.
Wiley, John Otto, Theodore Mahoney,
George Mccall, Eugene Lynch, Reece
Pyle, William H. Quinn, John McCaf.
frey, j. S. Traphagan, Frank Pinker-
ton, John D. Pierson, Joseph Lentz,
Samus Smith, f. B. Caulk, and Char
les L. Sparks.


TAKING EvrDENCR.


After viewing the body and examin-
ing closely til. evidences of conflict that
were so indelibly impressed on thu soft
yielding soil at the edge of the ditch,
they decided to adjourn to meet at the
City Hall, and to there hear Whatever
evidence that was to be presented. 1t
was about eleven o'clock before the
Jury got together. The first witness
was Elmer Ridgway, who being sworn,
testified: | was coming to town in a
milk wagon this morning. Saw the
deceased lying in the road on the
causeway; when | came in town
| told an officer who was standing
in front of the hall that there was a
man lying OH the causeway in the mid
die of the road.


James Ridgway, being the next wit
ness testified, that between five and six
o'clock met man at Hare's Corner
road who told me there was man fro
zen to death on the causeway. When
| reached the spot didn't get ou. of
the wagon; sent my brother the pre-
cpding Witness to the hall to inform
the police. The man was in the mid
die of the road with his face towards
Wilmington; the side of it on the
ground his head was lying to tho left
OF the road going this way. | didn't
know who the person was | met at the
IIarss Corner road he was carrying q
picture, and was a white man.


Sergeant John +. Dolan, sworn: This
morning |, with Mr.. Eugene Lynch,
viewed the body; while OH our way
there we met three colored girls. One
of them informed me that her mother
chad heard a number of men lighting,
and heard one of them say: Lets kill
the s-h' and heard another reply:
NO, not here; let's take him up farth-
er.'"" went to McManus' saloon and
one of the McManuses told me that they
had put four men out of their saloon on
Saturday night; these men We subse-
quently arrested. On going towards
the bridge Mr.. Walther told me that
he had heard them fighting. There

there is not the slightest difficulty in
apprehending, convicting and hanging

hang him without the benefit Of tho
law. Ii he escapes the msb there is no

through pell mell, and new trial or

known. II he have mo- counsel, so much
the worse for him, and ii he have not
Witnesses, il saves q great deal Of time
and expense. The demand for justice
ia tremendous, and the great necessity
OF the time is to hang him, and that as
speedily as possible. We have no dis
position to befriend the negro in the
comm mission of crime. II he be muir
.derer or guilty of committing any capi-
tai offence, let him bs hung, but why in
tho name OF outraged justice should =
black murderer bs hanged and white
murderer escape! The great majority
of the murders in the south are con-
mitted by whites, but who evsr hears
of white murderer being hung, espe.

We ara not referring to political muir

by scores because they want to vote the

that any white man will be hung for SC

tence In the Of John II. Bales. the wife mur-
derer. had been suspended and that the Supreme
Court of the State had not taken up the appeal made
by the defending attorneys, became indignant, and

the crowd to the JAIL where failing to get the
keys, they effected an entrance by making
an opening through the roof. and were pre-
pairing to destroy the costly iron cage which
held the wretched prisoner when the jailer opened
it without further opposition. The prisoner was
placed by his former neighbors in d small wagon
drawn by one horse and carried three-quarters OF
mile north Of town. followed by a concourse est-
mated at two thousand five hundred persons. The
wagon was halted under tree. and the wretched
said he wanted DR.. william r. McWillisms to
pray for him. The Doctor came forward. mounted
the wagon and prayed that IL it we're possible God
would pardon the heinous crime for which this
poor man seemed about to suffer. Alter the prayer
came long silence: one seemed willing to adjust
the fatal knot. The delay led to discussion. in which
DR.. Williams took the lead and favored the idea of
returning the wretch to his cell to await the due
process OF law. Amid the shouts Of the populace
Bales carried back to jail to await the action Of
the supreme Court."

On the River Front.",,"WHAT CHRIsTIANA AVENUE LOOKS


LIKE NEAR THE RIVER BANK.


To take = glance At Christiana Ave.
nue., down near the river bank, In its
present condition, It requires a large
stretch Of the Imagination to sec therein
the prospective ""road TO the river"" /""
t,eming with the vehicles of pleasure
seekers and the heavily laden teams of
busIu ess men and manufacturers.


There Is no disgusting the fact that to
make this road to the river, and put IL
In good condition, will require the ex-
penditure Of large amount of money.
AT present the road 10 In fair condition
as far As the high land known as GAL
rich's bluff, and with little work could
be made 0t for all kinds of travel. But
from the bluff to the river front, a dis
tance Of fully q quarter OF . mile, the
road has 10 be made entirely, as 1t was
formerly . low piece Of ground, fire.
quently covered with water by the rais-
ing tides.


II was for the purpose Of building up
this road that the bitches were dug on
each side, that on the south by the
American Dredging Company, and on
the north by Dennis Buleer Of this city.
The former Is q feet wide and the lat
ter ID. The dirt excavated from these
ditcbes was thrown upon the roadway
between them, and raised 1t to such a
height that only at one occasion-dlir-
it overfiowed by water.


b.n al L., ~,
road, however, Is the poor character of
some of the dirt with which II was built
This dirt, which was taken from
the ditches,is composed mainly of decom-
posed vegetable matter which, when ex-
posed TO the sun becomes dry and rotten,
crumbles into fine dust, and blows
away. On this account more filling up
Is required, and the dirt for this purpose
Is being tax en- from the high land In
front OF Mr.. Lucas Alrichs house, at the
western end Of the bitches.


Street Commissioner Lynch now has
four or five men and one cart engaged in
performing this work. 1t Is doubtful
however, If much of this dirt from the
highland can be spared, as In the opinion
Of some the ground Is none too high al
this point. This fact will render the
completion OF the road 4 matter of much
expense, rs In all probability the greater
! amount OF the dirt required will have tt
be fauled from different parts of the city
| q distance of from two To three miles.
And even should the road be compile
ted and made good to the river front, an
other serious item Of expense will have
to be met before II Is Of any praclica
| use.


This item Is tho building OF wharf
The river bank at this point sets we'll in
and 1t would Irequire At least five hun
dred feet Of wharf to make the road OF
any use az medium of connection with
| the river traffic. II has been proposed
| that the expenses could be lessened BY
constructing a pier In deep water, AMI
connecting IL with the road by stou
bridge, as Is the case at Ponnsgrove and
other places, but even this plan woult
prove expensivelto those doing the work


This article Is merely intended Il
show some of the difficulties that stant
In the way Of building road to thu
Delaware by way Of Christiana avenue
a. many people are of the opinion tha
the road IL so nearly completed that tn


expenditure of few hundred dollar


will place it In a suitable condition 70


all kinds of travel. This idea Is entirel,


erroneous, and those interested in til


road should drive over occasionally, an,


see for themselves the extensive char {
| ter of the work now in hand.


At the river front Street Commission


or Lynch has three men at work repair


ing the bank, from the large ditch 80


feet north, as this portion OF the bank


owned by the city. The work Is bein


well done, and when completed wi


leave a good stout bank, where ragge

UP A CHIMNEY.

Few men have so thrilling an ex.
perience as Philip Lynch and Jos.
Pendergrass. The former WAS
blown from a high brick chimney
at Hunters Point during the storm
Sunday. The latter had an almost
miraculous escape. The chimney
was lis feet high. and the men were
on the scaffoldlng, Pendergiass on
the upper and Lynch below him.
The wind struck the chimney with
terrific force, and the first scaffold-
ing began to sway back and forth,
cracking and siraining. Pender.
grass, seeing the danger, hugged
The brick kwork of the chimney. AS
the storm swayed the scafinlding
from its fastenIngs, Lynch was
either unable to obtain secure
hold on the chimney or too con-
fused to make the attempt. Sud
denly the upper part of the scaffold
gave way with a crash, and was
hurled to the ground. a tangled
mass of poles, planks and splinters.
Lynch fell with the scaffold, while
Pendergrass, with Il desperate eff
fort, sprang upon the top of the
chimney, and was left

Lynch's maEgled body was picked
up by some Of his fellow-workels

lived for three hours. Pendergrass,
in the meantim', remained cling
ing to the top of the chimney,
while the storm swirled him about,
seeming 10 threaten the overthrow
of the structure. He succeeded in
dnding partial protection from the
hurricane by crouching OH some
pieces of plank that had been
placed inside the mouth of the
chimney 20 aid in its erection. He
says that when he felt the scaffolh-
ing giving way under him, and
spraug for the chimney-cap, he
called Lynch to follow him. Lynch
made desperate effort to gain the
top of the structure, but lost his
footing and tumbled headlong to
the bottom, striking in his descent
every tier of the lower portion of
the scaffolding which did not fall.
But another danger beset Pender-
grass.


AFIRE


Had been a few minutes before
started in the furnace below to test
the drawing qualities of the new
chimney. The smoke and gases
from this fire had begun to pour up
through the chimney, aud they al
most smothered Pendergrass, who
dared not quit the place where he
crouched, from fear of being blown
from the chimney top by the gale
that howled over his head with in
creasing violence, while the fumes
from the chimney almost took
away his breath. 81 saw my dan

NV York. July 16.-It is stated
o by the Northern Pacific Railroad
Company that the rapid develop
ments In Washington Territory
and the demand for railroad facil-
tiles have determined them to COM
mence the construction of II road

of seven hundred miles. They have
accordingly issued a circular call
ing for an additional $2,o00 COO.
The subscriptions closed yesterday,
The entire amount having been

construction will begin as soon as
the line can be located. Ten thous.

fine Darien snip Canal.


NEW YORK, July 16.-The 3rib
une says: The active part which
Lesseps is taking in the Darien
Canal project naturally inspires
considerable confidence and awuk-
ems general interest. Having ac-
complished great work of the
same kind under adverse circum-
stances he oug ht,it is assumed, to be
qualified to determine the feasibili-
ty of this enterprise. But the
influence of his example is
necessarily limited. Already it
is suggested in France that
careful estimates, based on a
thorough survey, should be made
before Lesseps asks for suDscrlp
ton of $S0,000,000. People will
also desire to know what profits
the canal may be expected to yield.
Toe Suez Canal cost about S90,000,-
900. For the first two years its eX-
peases exceeded its receipts and
profits. Since then they have been
very small, the net earnings hav-
ing been only $967,395 in 1877.
Lesseps is entitled TO attentive con-
siderntiou, but when the enthusi-
asm of the moment has sub
sided his appeals for capital will be
met inevitably by the inquiry,
""Wll it pay ?'

FOR PRESIDENT AND RECEIVER.


When the Assembly Committee on Railroad Man.
agement resumed its session in the room of the
General Term of the Supreme Court. yesterday.
there was fair attendance. The examination of Mr..
George I. Balch was continued. He testified that
when the Erie Railway was sold the court copy of
the inventory Of the property of the company was
taken to the place Of and represented US the full
inventory. How much of the property was rightly
in the inventory was question which referee
was now deciding. Mr.. Jewett had stin some
property on his hands as receiver of the
Erie Railway-the Grand Opera House-for
instance, and securities worth $259,sOO. Mr..
Jewett's salary receiver is $4,000 a year; his
salary president was fixed at $4,000 year, to-
gether with an advance of $4,000 year tor ten
years; this salary and advance. making total OF
$4,000. paid to him when the agreement was
made in September. 1874; the road went into the
hands of receiver on May 20. 1875.


Alter some further testimony the witness was
cross-examined by Mr.. Shpman. He testified: 1.-THE
memoranda have used in this case were prepared
by me within the past four weeks. partly from the
printed records of the Erie Railway Company. ut
the request Of Mr.. Stern. Several letters were
handed to the witness and marked for identification
copy Of letter of Mr.. Jewett to Colonel Bach was
offered in evidence and read. 1t is dated May T. 1s7S
and states substance that Colonel Balch had said
he well fitted for preparing reports to State en-
gneers and stockholders; that all the reports
made by Balch; that he was trusted in that work
that when charge made against Mr.. Jewett that
the reports were incorrect he expected that Mr..
Balch would take upon himself the responsibility,
but that he refused that Mr.. Balch called on Mr..
th011
ers and wanted to form combination to the detri-
ment of the company; that Mr.. Balch has used
every secret to upset, overthrow and destroy
the Erie hallway Company and assist it's enemies in
their attacks it, that his conduct has been dis
loyal and dishonest, and he therefore removed him
from Office.


Mr.. Stern said the letter was all bosh, and simply
amounted to this That Mr.. Jewett got himself INTO
bad box and was charged with perjury, and then
wanted Mr.. Bach to shoulder all the responsibility.


Here Mr.. Balchs letter to Mr.. Jewett in reply
read, ana Is a general and complete denial Of
Mr.. Jewett's charges. He denies thar he ever was
engaged to make up reports tor the stockholders.
THINGS THAT WERE NOT SAID.
The examination the letters then proceeded
and the witness said IL don't recollect having in
my letters to p j. Lynch. the engineer attacked Mr.
Jewett; did not to my recollection state that
would make the fur fly by and by. and then would
reward my friends; attended as witness for the
Grand Jury in connection with the charges against
Mr. Jewett, hut was not examined; do not remein-
ber having stated in my letter to Mr.. Redmond, in
Liverpool. that Mr. Jewett escaped indictment



henchman Of Governor Morgan and that the press
OF this city all bought up Counsel piled the
witness with number of questions in regard to
statements made by him in his letters and to every
question came the answer. IL don't recollect.""


Reference was made to Mr.. William Pitt Sherman
charged that he a discharged employe OF the
Erie Company. Mr.. Stern promptly repelled tho
charge and said he should call Mr.. sherman to the
witness stand.


@. Did not tho reports prepared by yon for 1874
and 1876 conform substantially to the reports of

| did not; they were misleading as regards the
| floating debts: there was certainly great change
effected in the method of making reports under Mr..
Jewetts administration.


Q. For the betterq A. No. but greatly for the
lead the public there is difference in items between
the reports made to the State Engineer and those

recess was here taken for halt an hour. at the

What mean to convey by misleading reports IL that


only the reports vague and obscure, but they
absolutely state untruths; the interest due has
always been charged to the interest account whether
it paid not; the reports intended for the
| public and to be honest they should set forth in
foot notes how much of the set down in the
interest account has been paid previous to the ad-
ministration of Mr.. Watson the profit and loss ac-
count included legal expenses, but under Mr.. Watson
and Mr. Jewet the legal and reconstruction expenses

the proceedings against Mr. Jewett the charge Of
| perjury never had any regulations with Mr.. Nc
| Henry, have ever seen him but once, and that
| at distance; never considered myself in the en-
ploy of Mr.. Jewett; was servant of the proprie-
| tors Of the Erie Railway Company; never had any
interest in common with Sickles, McHenry any of
| that gang.


@. What was the increase in the funded debt from
| 1874 to 1877? A. In 1874 the funded debt was
$l34 927 and in 1877 s142 95940 the increase

To Mr. shipman-I may have stated in a letter to
| Mr.. Redmond that the Lord would not allow Mr..

q. For what particular sin did you mean he was
to be punished? A. For his general unfitness for

for the position Of president receiver found
great many irreg gulsrties which, during my term Of

ST. LOUIS, Oct. 29.-A ""Giobe Demo
crat"" special from Ksokuk, Iowa, says


""Ths case Of 'Bill' Young, whose trial
for the murder Of Lewis Spencer and
four children near Luray, Clarke Coun.
ty, No., in 1877, closed at Kahoka or
Saturday last and resulted in a verdict
Of not guilty, eliminated to-day in a
resort to mob violence. There was strong
oircumstantial evidence against Young, /,
but the prosecution was greatly weak.
ensd by the fiasco Of Detective Lane in
attempting to account for the bloody
overalls. Although acquitted, a ma
jority Of the people of Clarke County
were convinced of his guilt, and, how
ever much they may deprecats lynch
law, it is safe to say that the public at
large who had read the evidence shared
this opinion. It was not known or even
spread outside Of Clarke County, how
ever, that any move would be made to
execute summary punishment. On
Sunday afternoon Young was married,
at Kahoka, to Miss Lydia Bray, of Ohio,
to whom he was engaged before his
arrest, and who has been in this State
for the past four months assisting him
in preparing his defense.


They arrived in this city on Monday
evening, and remained here until this
morning, when they left for Young's
home, near Luray. Their movements
had been closely watched. Last night
mob, numbering from 100 to 200 men,
assembled north Of Kahoka, and was
waiting there this morning when the
train passed. Finding that Young went
on to his home, they followed on horse
back and in wagons, and, after his az
rival there, surrounded his home, and
demanded his surrender.


Young who was accompanied by J.
c. Coffman, Of Toledo, Ohio, one of his
attorneys, refused to surrender and
opened fire ON the mob. Shots were
and firing was kept up until
Young was wounded. Eight men then
forced their way into the house, took
Young out and hanged him: The most
Intense excitement prevails."

A Niger Indian Witn History


SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 18-There
is now confined in the city prison
young Digger Indian who has
had u life of exciting experience.
His name is Willis Ross, and hi
has beeh a resident Of Mariposn
county until within q few days.
On the 9th Of May last he shot AMI
killed Jonas Thompson, q farmer
living about eight miles from the
village Of Maripnsa. Ross lay in
walt for Thompson behind the fence
of the latter's garden aud put ""a
rifle ball through him. Thompson
managed to get into the house,
barred the door ard laid down by 1t
with ""a gun in his hands, in which
position he was found dead hy his
neighbors. The murder was traced
to Ross, who was arrested aud
lodge, in jail pending his trial. A
number OF farmers and property
holders of Mariposa, who iave
banded themselves together for
mutual protection under the name
of the Chowchilla Rangers, at
tempted TO take the Indian from
the Jail ana lynch him, but the
strength of the. building resisted
their efforts. Last Monday Ross
was put on trial. Tuesday at l2:30
he was convicted, aud Friday was
Sc. for passing sentence OF
i'm p,isonment for life. Directly
after his convlction 1t became APP
parent that another attempt at
lyuching would be made. To avert
that danger the Court huriiedly aud
privately passed sentence without
further delay, aud, about half past
two the same evening, Deputy
Sheriff Choiser, who In the mean
time had procured two Of the best
horses in town, placed the prisoner
on one, aud, mounting the other.
set out at tie top Of his speed for
Merced via Hornitos. He had got
about two miles from The village
aud was entering the road when
twelve or fifteen of the
.Chowchilla Rangers appeared
in hot pursuit. An ex-
citing chase ensurd, pnr-uers ami
pursued urging their horses at a
bteakneck speed over winding
and difficult mountain trail. Al
every point where n turn iu the
road brought the fugitiyes in view
a shower of bullets from the rifles
aud pistols of the pursuers was
sent after them, none, fortunately,
taking effect. Hornitos, % miles
distant, WAS reached In about all
hour aud twenty-five minutes,
aud here the Sheriff aud
prisoner had obtained sufii
cient start to give them time to
effect hurried change of horses.
Scarcely WAS this done when the
rangers came up and the race was
recommended, but the fresh horses
of the fugitives proved too much
for the jaded animals Of the puf-
suers and, in two hours and fifty.
five minutes after leaving Mari
posa. Choiser and the Indian ar
rlved at Merced, distance of forty
miles, and Ross was lodged in ] al
till the arrival of the train, When
he was brought TO this city, arriv
ing here Wednesday. Owing to the
hurried flight from Mariposa there
was no time to make out q com nit
ment, and the Indian has been re-
tained at the city prison awaiting
its arrival. Choiser, immediately
after seeing his prisoner in place
of safety, went TO bed completely
used up by his rough ride. Ross

SOME FACTS IN CONNECTION WITH
THE ALLEGED EXPOSE",,"


THE ALLEGED EXPOSE.


The Republican, with a great flourish
of trlmpets, came out yesterday, with
an array of assertions in regard to tie
misman agement of the City Hospital.


This institution vas, at its inception,
opposed by the GAZETTE, as piece of
extravagant folly, which would never
renGer sufficient benefit to the commun-
ity TO compensate for the money expend-
ed upon It's purchase and main enance.
This opinion was shared by many, aud
the subsequent career of the Hospital
has proved its correctness.


From its opening year the Hospital
was an object of suspicion and distrust.
Scarcely had it sprung into existence as
the legitimate r. suit of Republican folly
and extravaganza, before the a Is et Re
publican officials began TO drag it into
reproach as an object of contempt, as
we'll as an institution Of extravagant
folly. The first REPUBLICAN Superin-
tendent, John M. Stewar., was accused
OF immoral practices with the inmates,
and after a whtewashing investigation
got of with rrprimand, though he was
not reelected to the position.


Two years later another Republican
Superintendent, VIM. f. Moore, left the
city under sudden L. aspiration, taking
with him about $50 received from tue
board of patents. For one year, when
| Lewis Z. Springer, Democra' controll-
ed the Hospital, the breath Of suspicion
was not ra.sed against it, 2, ~

these,are ma. e the text for the erpOse in
yesterdays Republican. One Of these
""set outs"" is thus a'ludedto in the ex-
posing article:


""Wbep Evan Rice the Brandy ne
Bank detaulter was released from jail on

was cele brated by n big ""set-Out"" at the

were present apd none were more ac-

whether Mrs Hascy had been i'll during the month of

not remember. The reporter went to the store of

Kings partner and within q short time was recog-
nized as one of the most promising young lawyers
in Ohio. BY winning an unexpected victory for
client trial for murder in 1892 he established his
fame and position at the Bar beyond further ques-

He then entered political life. He has said him

Congress Mr.. Clay moved series OF resolutions in
the Senate condemning the policy OF the admins

policy of the administration the House was warmly

in the latter body beginning with the propositions
that the Bank of the United States ought not to be

At the end of his Congressional term q choice for

Hon. Thomas Ewing. who then in the
Senate. Thus in two instances Mr.. Allen adj
vanced on the political road by one majority. He is

Mr.. Benton MIR. Allen was no mtator. but man of

He Undertakes to Speak for the COlOred


People of mississippi.

Calling upon Mr.. Lynch on yesterday,
The National Republican requested his
opinion As to the general views of the col
ored people of Mississippi regarding the
migration scheme. rs toreshadowed by the
resolution OF Senator Window.


Mr.. Lynch replied that the migration and
colonization of the colored people meets
with the hearty approval of the colored
people generally in Mississippi. My infor-
nation is that large numbers of them are
now leaving the State, and many more
would leave If they had the means TO defray
their expenses. In the county of Adams,
Mississippi, where L reside, there is not
much disposition among the coIoTed peo-
pie to leave the State, as the practice OF
bull-doZing has not yet been thoroughly
inauguraUed in that locality; but in other
counties, such as Wilkinson, Jefferson, Clai-
borne, and Warren, where mob law is the
only law that is known, recognized or re-
spected, there is a general disposition
among all the cOlored and many white peo-
ole to migrate to SOme section where the
rights of citizenship will be protected and
respected. l am opposed to emlgI alton
from the United States to any foreign coun-
try, and ] would be opposed to have the
cOlored people leave the Southern States if
We could be protected in the enjoyment of
life. liberty, and property. But as these
rights are denied to US and TO large num-
Der OF whites in many localities in nearly
all of the Southern States, the scheme to
promote III grafton comments lJSGII TO my
appreciation, and | will use whatever influ-
euce | possess to carry it into practical
operation. The cOlored people of manv
Southern States have been TO all intents
and purposes relegated back to of serfdom
We are denied every right guaranteed us
by the constitutional amendments. The
Government has failed to en- force the law
in our behalf and has shamefully denied US
that protection in the free enjoyment of our
inalienable rights as citizens that the Con-
Il 1aV1
ican citizens shall receive, and. unless the
laws are enforced in the behalf of the op-
pressed colOred people of the South. our on
IL hope tor peace and prosperity is to take
up our abode in some other section of the
Union and leave the south in the sole pos
session of those who so falsely claim. in
Congress and out OF it, that the ""own all the
laud, pay all the taxes, and are the possess
sors ct all the education to be found in the
South, and are therefore alone entitled to
govern""


n. R.-From your experience, do you
| find many cOlored people who at every
election are fairly 'yearning"" to vote the
Democratic ticket, as Is claimed to be the
case by Southern Democrats in Congress?
Mr.. NO, sir; but on the other hand
they vote the Republican ticket with as
much unanImitv as ever. when the Demo-
Gratis are so gracious as to permit them to
vote at all.


n. R-Did the Republicans make any
I =
/ tion in your State:


| Mr. L.-Ihey made no organized effort
| in any district, as they knew beforehand
what the result would be. In two districts
| there were Independent candidates against
| the Democratic nominees, for whom the
colored men voted in all the counties in
| their respective districts in which they


voted all. In counties where they failed to
vote for the Independents they did not vote,
/ but staid away from the polls.


| n. R.-Mr. Lynch, if General Grant


should be the Republican candidate for the


next Presidency, and the Republicans of


Mississippi were protected in their right to


vote. and the ballots were fairly counted,


would the State give Republican major


ity?


Mr.. L.--1es, sir; unquestionably. With


an election in 1880 free from intimidation,
murder, and the most shameful frauds,
/ General Grant or any other good, stalwart
! Republican can carry the State by from
10000 TO 10000 majority."

goes bravely on, and everybody connected with
the Fair Association has business enough to
keep them employed for several weeks to
come. The office OF the association, No. 493

terday with exhibitors and applicants for
space, the result at night showing that nearly
all the available room in both the large build
ings had been utilized. 1t was expected that
o number of articles would have been received
at the Main Building yesterday, and several
officers OF the association were on the grounds
all day waiting to assign them to their proper
places. None were received, however, und the
wOrkmen were thus given an opportunity to
clear away all the debris in the room
which at Z o'clock last evening was locked
up until this morning, when its doors
will be thrown open to exhibitors. All
tho work on this building is now
complete, and tho interior, with its pretty
tinls, blue, gold and red, presents very at.
tractive appearance. The walls have been
kalsomined light pink, and it can safely be
asserted that 10 such fair hall exists in this
country. An army of mechanics and laborers
arc engaged on the other buildings, Grand
Stand, grounds, &C., and it is confidently ex.
pCctcd that next Saturday will find everything
completed. Machinery Hall will be opened
tomorrow for exhibits, aud the roof of the
Art Gallery is nearly finished. A large reser-
voir, holding 1900 gallons oil water, has bson
built near the PatteTsOn-avenue entrance
which is supplied with water from five springs
situated in different portions OF the grounds
The water is then distributed over the grounds
through four.iuch terra Gotta pipes, pumps be-
ing located near the stables, Grand Stand aud

superintendent this work, and much credit is
due him for the energy displayed.

""Comes straight to the front. On Tues

""Partly for the sake of developing

of killing ducks. If / want to kill a

ducks mind. Suddenly / take careful

as Julius Caesar. It's one one of the most
beautiful things in the world.''


""Did you ever kill one in that way?""


""Well that is just the point. No. I
did not. I am praeticing. This is what
has excited Mrs. Metcalf. Wednesday
morning, while I was in the back yard
trying the thing, foregot. 1 aimed at a
bird house on the grape-arbor, and the
poker went out of my hand and through
the kitchen window. I apologized to
Mrs. Metcalf and tried again This time
l aimed right at the kitchen window, in
tending to hit the bird box back of me.
The boomerang must have got twisted
somehow, for the scientific principle was
temporarily suspended, and she went
bang! through the kitchen window
again""


'.Struck Mrs. Metcalf?'


""Struck her as wicked outrage. But

the proper angle. Then aimed at the
pump and let her fly. She went up,
turned over, flew behind me. and nearly

""I'll tell you. I caught duck and
tied it down to a raspberry BUSH I pro-
iected the boomerang at that duck two

counting once when I slipped! I hit
everything within forty feet of the bird.
I hit all the loose ducks and chickens; I

duties of his calling. SO harsh judgment
the most unbiased spectator may pass upon
him without lack of charity.


With regard however, to the wholesale
condemnation heaped by indignant Catholics
upon ""prcsts as savings banks we have a
word to say. The positions OF the Catholic
priest and of his flock III this country are
peculiar. The Protestant labOrer would re-
cent the Interference of his pastor in his busi-
ness affairs rs an impertInence the Catholic
expects it, and. what is more. he needs it.
Tho uncducated IrsGman landing IN TINS
country is ""a reckless and waSteful as
child. If he makes any money on Monday, he
would take Tuesday as a holiday to
spend it, provided there Is nobody to con-
trol him. In Ireland his priest managed lis

saw that they went TO buy pig instead of
Whiskey We are simply stating facts The
Irish system was continued and enlarged IN
ths country. The omigraut carried bis wages
TO lis priest; almost all the money sent back
to 1Tiug over other cmIgrants has gone
throrg the priest. In some instances the
plan 1a, answered badly. Bishop Lynch, Of
Soutl Carolina, and one or two heterogeneous
and p .csts, have become seriously involved III
their attempt to take the place OF
savings jaub8 with their people, and to
invest cir money permanently. The reason
il also vattcr OF fact. The Jealous priest
has two ccts-tO serve his people and Els
Church. rhe system ayOwedly pursued by
this Chur h foI ears has been to strengthen
its foothold in his country by the acquisition
of real estate which would rise II value. The
priest invested the savings of his people III
schools churches and nGnneries. In nine
cases out OF ten tho investment was carefully
made, and the deposItor was paid his capital
with interest. Occasionally the priest made
mistake, real estate sank in value, and, IN a
word, the bank broke. In almost every case,
however, the Church made good individual
losses


OR readers must Judge for themselves of
the wisdom of his sort Of religious unincor-
poratcd saving, banks. The muddle in Gin
cnnati and like failures furnish an argument
against the priest as a business man; but on
their behalf it may be said that the priest by
this means has kept the men Of his flock from
drunkenness, has saved their families from
starvation, has been able to lift them into
dccenttr, more self-respecting lives. Let JUS

OVER TWO THOUSAND CITIZENS PUNISH


WITH DEATH THE PERPETRATOR OF


A BRUTAL OUTRAGE ON A LADY.


Coal VALLEY, w. Va, July Q, 1879.


A few days ago Clark Lee, negro
man who has figured to some extent in
certain circles Of colored society in Rich
mond and who is probably well known
to Chastine Cox, committed most afro
cious assault upon Mrs. Settle, wife of
the County Treasurer of Fayette county
w. Vas Mrs Settle had the courage to
resist him, and before Les could over
come her he had broken one Of her legs
and her collar bone and pulled out her
tonsils. The streams of the lady drew
her children to the room, and their OUT
cries frightened oK the villsin. The out
rage, Of course, accustomed great excite
ment, and dozens of men, mounted and
armed, set out in pursuit of the fugitive.
Fayette county is OH the Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad, aud partly in the Kama
wha Valley. The county i wild and
rugged and the mountaineers do not
know the use Of the gallows. One has
not been erected in that section for year.
Whenever such an offence as this is CON-
mitted the people 'turn out"" the con-
stab9lary ""turn In"" a sapling is selected
and lynch law in all OF its merciless
promptness and severity administered.
Lee knowing the popularity of the West
Virginians in this respect, fed for dear
life. By almost superhuman exertions
and after considerable suffering, be got
as far as Parkersburg.


~ JUST IN TIME.
There on Saturday last he was captlr-
ed and the Fayette authorities notified
just in time to save the life of another
negro, believed to be Lee, who was in
the hands Of mob down in the county,
and who would otherwise have been
hanged Monday. In fact great crowd
was already in attendance awaiting the
event. Lee was put under the custody
of an officer and sent from Parkersburg
to Huntington by an Ohio River steam
er. His movements were well known
and upon his arrival at Huntington he
was met by about two hundred men
These formed an escort for him on his
homeward trip. He was put upon the
Chesapeake and Ohio train at Hunting
ton with the ostensible purpose of being
conveyed to Fayette, but it was we'll un
derstood that no judge or jury would bt
required in his case. 1t is probable tha
if he had made no admission he nigh
have been taken to Mrs. Settle for iden
tlfication; but he got frightened out O
his senses and confessed the assault, ant
said that he desisted when the screams
Of Mrs. Settles children became so loud
This was enough. 1t was determined
that he should not live another day.


NO MERCY.

republicans in favor of acquttal. Bitter denun-
citation INDUCED in at the time to the
conduct of these four democrats in casting
their votes to whitewash republican official who
had been charged with grave offences by Governor
Of the stamp of Lucius Robinson. Even many of the
republican Senators came in for their share of this
denunciation. Tonight, while conversing with
some Of the democratic Assemblymen. found that
their sympathies the side of Smyth.at least
they expressed themselves opposed to the passage
of any resolutions calling upon that gentleman to re-
sign his place Insurance Superintendent. This
is none of our fight. remarked one of these gentle
men, tonight, at Sanwx Hall, the republicans have
Smyth on their hands a huge elephants let them
get rid of him as best they They must not ex-
pect to help them. From such chance expressions
it would appear that the lobby and other effectual
influences are induced to operate the Smyth side.
Rumors of this character freely circulated last
year pending the impeachment trial. The democrats
who then aided Smyth have been watched closely
ever since The question is asked, Can the same
party afford to stretch effectua aid when the
Skinner bill for the removal of republican
Insurance Superintendent awaits the action
Of Senate and Assembly and resolution
ls likely to be called up tomorrow, requesting the
gentleman to resign. The debate on this latter
proposition is awaited with much interest. The sim
gular statement also given out tonight that Mr..
Sloan will be found on the Smyth side when the real
test question comes to be voted upon. The allega-
tions freely made that the votes of the three Tam
many Senators cast part of bargain between
their party in New York and the republican leaders
prevent combination last fall eeems to have
foundation in fact. Strong evidence of this cond-
tion of affairs has come to me here this evening""
These Senators alleged to have acted entirely
their responsibility, without any dctation from
Comptroller Kelly anybody else representing Tam
many Hall. The insurance fight has again taken
such prominent position in Albany at present that
such views canvassed around the hotels with
considerable warmth good deal as to the political
outlook for the future in this State it is conceded
hinges upon this controversy.

TUSNEL1ISG


An important bill has been introduced in tho
House by DR.. Hayes providing the necessary author
ty where railroad companies others desire to

provides that any railroad company intending to

purchase along their route upon or beneath the sur

sHERIpFs AND MARsHALs.


A bill simple enough on its face, but seriously
affecting the Sheriifs Office in New York city,
offered to-day by Mr.. Dean. II gives lawyers per-
mission to employ marshals deputy sheris.
they may deem it, for the execution OF process
out of courts of record. As the law now stands all
executions and attachments issued from these courts
must be executed by the Shern. A monopoly of this
profitable business is therefore, centred the hands
of that official Until the year 1875 the marshals
had Jurisdiction in this connection over the Marine
Court but III that year Sheriff Conner secured the
passage of bill by which he able to control all
its business. The patronage of the Marine Court
alone, far the Sheriff and his deputies con-
cerned. is said to be worth from s200OV to S300O
year Should Mr.. Deans bill become law
% asded between the ' fSass %arshais
In New York city. As the law stood
before 1875 it was optional with the lawyers in New
York To give their Marine Court papers to the Sheriff
or TO the marshals 1t IL evidently the intention
10 bring matters back to where they stood before
1875. With the present outcry raised against exfor
ton in several OF the public Offices in the metropolis
It is likely that Mr. Deans hill will meet with con-
siderable favor at the hands of the Legislature.

SPECIAL MEETING LAST EVENING
POWERS OF THE BOARD AS DEFINED
by THE CITY SOLICITOR.",,"POWERS OF THE BOARD AS DEFINED


by THE CITY SOLICITOR.


The Board OF Health met last evening
In special meeting, Plcsidtnt Dlolla-
ghan in the chair.


The President stated that the meeting,
was called for purpose Of as ertalning
what power the Board Of Health has
within one mile OF the city limits, Ia Ie-
gard to abating nuisauces.'


City Solicitor Macallistcr, who was
prcse,t, was asked TO give his views ON
the matter, which be readily did. He
sa d that as far ba X as 1909, when the
city was q borough, the legs alton gave
the City Council power to abate nui-
sances within the corporate limits, and
also within a mile of the limits. At the
same time it also clothed City Council
with authority to create Board Of
Health and delegate its powers in regard
To the health of the city to that body.
The jur sdictoi of the Board in the city,
and within mile of be city limits, will
be found on pages q and 80 Of the city
charter. Under the city charter the City
Council prepared ordinances. The
Board will find that on page 10 of the
| ordinance book it Is requisite that the
Board shall express an S4inionin regard
| to a nuisance b. fore II is abat-d, that Is
| the nuisance shall be first defined as a
nuisance by a vote of the Board. This
action Is requisite before bringing a suit
| aga INST a person for maintain ng a nui-
,ance. After such action is taken the
Board shall give notice 10 the owner OF
owners Of the property WHEREIN the nui
sance exists, ordering IL TO be abated
within certain length OF time, and II
the ownei should fail TO do 1t, the Boa
then has power to abate it, and the
Treasurer bring suit against said owner
for the expenses incurred.


In the case of Vandever before the
MAY or, the question was asked if in case
he failed u abate the nuisance if the
Board would have power to remove the
building. think that the Board can re-
move the building if it is really neces
sary, aud they cannot abate the nu sanct
any otter way. The Board has righ
TO open door or to remove vat, Or tt
do any lawful ;hing to remove a nu


same. The Board must be very careful
in exercising til It right, or else the cit,
might become liable for damages.


While the Board of Health can abatt
u nuisance Within mile beyond the city


limits, the city ordinance does not allow
1t TO bring persons before the Mayor ant
ha, e them lined. The Ma, or's jurisdit


tion to fine does not extend hey ond TIN


limits of the city. In this connection h'


would advise the Board Of Health to asl


Cuuucil to so amend the ordinance per


mitting the Board to have the authorit.
to bring persons who reside within on


mile If the city limits, before the Mayo
and have them fined.


A nuisance is local ofIense, and 1


any resilient within the neighborhoo


wherein the nuisance exists fells him


self aggrieved such person C,
make oaJii UeDiv the Mayor, and thu
ono al can bind the personover TO Lour
to answer the charge at Court, and th
Attorney General will in duty bout
, Ike act OH in the matter, and prepare
bill uf Indictment. The Board at an
time can have q Nuisance a1ated ana co


lect the costs for thu same.


Mr.. j. w. Hawkins moved that tn
p .rson aggrieved living in the vici,.ily {
the bone boiling establishment OF A. l.
+ Vaude er, bring suit before the Mayo
J and have him bound over for court.
a The motion was adopted and so the ma
: ter was dispos of.


Mr.. j. w. Hawk MS, complained oftf
a, bad condition of gutter at Fo'irteenl
4 and Market streets.


!, blI. Hepb rn stated that there WEI


several cutters in the lower part of Il
u city in the same way, caused by dei
e leaves.


u Nj. Kennedy moved that the Chi
q Engineer of the Water Department
: requested to open the fire plugs, whit
}. would help clean the cutters out.


The chair stated that a motion to tn
u effect had been pass early IN the Sun
d mer requesting the Street Commission
T, to do The same thiIg but no notice h;
u been taken of it. He said he did not d
II sire in any way 10 be contrary with t

A conference has Just been held in Philadelphia
by the Agricultural Health officers OF the three
States of New-York, New-Jersey and Pennsylvania,
at the request of Mr.. Edge, the recently appointed
officer of the latter State. The best of harmony
exists between General Patrick and Professor Law
who are trying to exterminate tho cattle disease
from this State. Colonel William II. Sterling. the
Agricultural Health officer of New-Jersey and hr.
Edge and il is proposed that the three States shall
work in concert in the campaign against the dread
ful malady which is prevalent among the cattle OF
this region.


II is the opinion Of General Patrick that the sick
cattle on the steamship Ontario, which created SO
much alarm in England in January last. and whose
arrival at Liverpool drew forth the British orders
IN Council were not infected with contagious
pleuro-pneumonia. Nevertheless, the contagious
type of the disease has really been prevalent IN
certain region of the United States for thirty-six
wears. and Is now raging violently, and there IS
every reason IN the world for the active campaign
now in progress for the suppression of the disease
II is not believed that the public are aware OF the
serons nature of the contagion which is now devas-
tonq the herds of cattle in this part of the country
The latest information received by General Patrick,
Colonel Sterling and the Department OF Agricui-
ture at Washington, shows that contagious pleuro-
pneumonia prevails from Fairfield county
in Connecticut. SuIOlk ODuHty oh N'""S

ther South it goes no one yet knows As 1t exists III
virulent form at Lynchburg, Va, and sonth
thereof in Halifax County on the border of North
Carolina, it is feared that it may have crossed the
border and that inspection would reveal It's exist
ence In North Carolina, too. Professor Law, Whlle
at Washington recently, was supplied with list
of twenty-five dairies in Fairfax County, va,
alone at each of which daires from three to four
teen cattle had died with contagious pleuro-
pneumonia within the past year.


This is a serious state of affairs for these seven
States contain more than 6, 100000 head of cattle,
md they are the States which distribute fine stock,
Jerseys Ayrshires, etc., TO the rest OF the country


THE CAMPAIGN NOW IN PROGRESS.


In this State where the disease was introduced
An 1913 and has existed ever SINCE there have been
killed bv order of General Patrick, on Long Island
and in and around New-York City, about 145 cattle
so badly off with the contagious pleuro-pneumonia
that their bodies had to be destroyed and their
hides cut TO pieces with knives so that they should
not be carried off and thus spread the contagon.
About 17j head of cattle have been killed by ORDER
in order to save them for beef. They were slightly
infected. About 800 more have been killed by
their owners because they had been exposed to III
faction and it was thought prudent TO kill them for
beef.


When General Patrick began operations early IN
February, as many as eighteen OF twenty head were
killed every week. The cOntagion has been so en-
ergetically dealt with that until lately the
number killed per week has been only two or
three. Just now it is about ten week. Six or
seven counties in this vicinity have been placed
under what is almost martial law, the removal OF
cattle from one to the other having been expressly
forbidden unless the cattle had first been IN
spected and received special permit. Premises
have been disintected, and an active Inspection OF
herds aud stables has been practised, III order
ease in Quarters mot previously suspected.
These measures have been effective, and much pro-
eTess mas been made toward extirpatng the disease
To show how persistent and vlrulent Is the cOnta-
gion, however, and how easily it may be spread; it

unnatural that II b almost without q

city was committed here about noon to-
day. The facts of the case seem to be
% rsvoltlng that 1t Is difkcult to accept
them ~ the truth. Unfortunately, how
ever, there Is - yet found no reason to
doubt the story which the neighbors and
friends Of the murderer and his victim
have TO tell. A father, man Of sixty-
one years of age, In the most cold blood
ed and deliberate manner, killed his own
daughter, woman Of thirty four years,
and who, revolving % It 10 to toll, was,
according to the teNlmony OF tue neigh
bors, the mother Of child by her un-
natural parent. 1t does not appear that
the murdered woman consented to live
In incest with her father. On the con.
tragy the evidence points to the fat that
she struggled against his adva ces and
fed from him and kept away from him
as much as possible. She was a mar
ried woman and sought the protection Of
her husband, which, under ordinary CIR
cumstances, would have sufficed to shield
her from the assaults Of the inhuman
wretch who has at length been the means
Of her death a. we'll a. her dishon0r.

have done with the tho object of COM
p.lling his daughter once more TO live

a few words, is the history Of this awful
crime. III ltbft bf.itt w


THE MURDERER.


The murderer's name is Edward Parr.
he is sixty-one years old, and for yean
has borne very bad character. He has
lived for long time in the Fourth ward
the central part of the city, corresponding
very much to the Fourth ward in New
York. Five years ago his incestuous
conduct toward his daughter becamc
known, when the girl had Child by him
1t is said. The nelghbors were so indig-
nant that they sought to hang him, and
rounded the wretch's house with the In
tention of lynching him. He escaped,
however, and fed the city, turning up
out west somewhere. f ff


SENT TO PRISON.


About three years ago his daughter
married young man named Ellwood
Irwin. The father soon sought an occa-
sion to quarrel with him and made an
attempt TO kill him. For this he was
arrested, tried and convicted, and served
two years and halfin prison. Since he
bas been out he has tried steadily and
persistently oget Mrs. Irwin join with
him In having her husband sent to prison
20 that he could compel her to live with
him once more. The daughter has al
ways refused, the neighbors say, and this
has led to many quarrels, and within
three months the old man had been
lodged IN prison three times for disorder
ly aud threatening conduct. Mr.. Irwin |
Is now In Jail on q charge of robbery,
largely through the instrumentality ofhjs
father-iD-law. Recently the daughter |
who was thirty -four years Of age, and |
was q decent, respectable woman, had
lived with her husband at No. LOOP Car
penter street. She has manifested much
fear of her father, who has skulked about |
The alleys near Alaska street, in the low
est quarter of the Fourth ward. That
bis crime was premeditated there can be
10 doubt. Mrs. Irwin had a friend, Mrs.
Margaret johnson, living in the rear of
No. 831 Fitzwater street, about three
squares from where she and her husband |
lived. She frequently called on her.
This the father knew, and he has prowl-
Cd around the neighborhood for some |
time, lying in walt for his daughter, her |
husband having forbidden him to come
to her home to see her. iA .lJ


'i THH MURDER.
Last night Parr went TO the house next |
to Mr., Johnson's and said he would walt |
for his daughter. She did not come,
however But this morning Mrs. Irwin |
left her house and went to see Mrs. john |
son. Her father must have followed her |
for she had scarcely entered the house |
before he hal made his Appearance
The moment she saw him the daughter
screamed with fear aud ran up stairs
He called to her to come down as he |
wanted to talk 70 her. She refused, and
said she would talk to him out of the |
window. This incensed the wretched |
man and be. ran up stairs. Thedaughter
had locked the room door. He speedily |
broke IL open and rushed at her. Mrs
johnson, who was down stairs, heard his |
very heavy tread overhead and the noise |
OF Q struggle, with which the screams OF |
Mrs. Irwin mingled. Mrs. Johnson's
baby was lying In cradle In the upper |
ROOM and with motherly instinct she |
ran up and snatched 1t to her breast
Glancing around she was horror stricken |
to see that the infuriated man had push /
ed his daughter against closet and was |

moments after, when assistance arrived
Mrs. Irwin was found lying dead In

OF the stairs.

w. Va, July IA. 1879.
Details of the stirring scenes through which the
people of Hinton, W. Va.-a town forty miles west
of this point-have passed have just been received
here. For several days past the negroes about Hin
ton have been gossipping in manner derogatory to
the character of young white lady who is the afi-
anced of Mr.. Lonnie Peck. popular employe of the
Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad at Hinton. Last
Friday evening Peck overheard three negro
men using the young lady's name lightly.
and he Immediately gave each of them thorough
cowhiding. Later at night eight negroes attacked
Peck. declaring their determination to hang him.
Peck escaped them and was soon joined by citizens
and railroad men to the number of seventy-fve.


THE NEGROES DRIVEN OUT.


This party commanded by c. Mayhugh. an engin-
of the Chesapeake and Ohio Road. famous for his
daring. made raid on the negroes and drove them
out of town. several harmless shots being fired.
Saturday reports in circulation that the negroes
had gone to New River where large force negroes
arc employed by government In removing oDsCruc-
tons from the river, to obtain reinforcements and
the announcement was made that they were coming
back to hang Peck in retaliation for the hanging OF
Mart Lee at Coal Valley time since, and also
for Pecks whipping the three men. When this re-
port was received the whites sent to Coal Valley for
fifty white miners to come up and help them.


RETURN OF THE NEGROES.


About dark Saturday night band Of negroes, one
hundred or more strong. up from the river.
Dick America. They marched about town in regular
military STYLE being commanded by Captain Dick
in loud tones. They cursed. beloved and made
hideous noises Like band Of savases. and vowed
they would hang Peck before midnight.


MINERS.


The miners, seventy five strong. who had been
sent for arrived the o'clock train from Coal
Valley and having joined Pecks friends at the depot
in Hinton marched upon the negroes, who fled pre-
cipitately at the first and only volley Ten negroes
were caught stripped of their clothing tied to trees
and were well but not cruelty whipped aud then
turned loose. The white men made every effort to
capture Captain Dick America. but failed They
openly avowed their intention Of lynching him had
he been caught


A TEMPORARY CALM.


The miners remained in Hinton all day yesterday
and until this morning, when. the negroes making
no further demonstrations, they returned to their
work ut Coal Valley and tonight quiet reigns again
in Hinton. But there is telling when this affair
will break out afresh. The excitement in Hinton

The regular weekly meeting Il CT


Council was held last evening, Pre-


dent Lichtsnstsin in the chair.
The Committee on Public Building
, Colonel Taylor chairman, reported 1


ysrsely on the petition Of Jacob ]
Sharp and others, asking that the o
dinancs prohibiting farmers from ssl


ing all kinds Of meat in the street ms


kst be repealed. The report was signe


by Msssrs. Chandler, Adams and Hem


ted. The minority Of tile committe,


composed Of Col. Taylor and Mr.. N,


Glinchey, were opposed 70 the repor


bus presented no minority report. o


the motion 10 adopt the report Of ID


committee, Mr.. Norton earnestly oppo.


cd it.


He said he was surprised that the con


nittss should report adversely on sue


just petition and he though ght the mem


bers who favored such . report really vic


lated their obligations a. Councilmen


The report Of the COMMITTEES hs though


Was opposed 70 tho best .interssts eft

the market, the citisens he said GOT bet
ter nsat. He quoted the prices show

know nothing about il, for it il sen
70 Philadelphia where high prices ar
obtained. Farmers hs said could sci
chickens in market a 10 and IL cts. /,
pound Because they are allowed I,
stand In the market with them


AY. Norton expressed himself q
opposed y ""shinners"" but h,
thought Council had no right to Gre
ate . monopoly Of anything. Laboren
now get % and @6 q week, and hs could
not see how they afford to pay such
prices for beef. He read . part Of ths
veto message Of Mayor Stoksley Of
Philadelphia, when he vetoed the or.
dinance intended to drive the farmers
from South and Second street markets.
As it was in Philadelphia SO it will be
in Wilmington. lie said the Democratic
party got the majority in Council by
solemn pledges to remedy these evils
and the people are watching TO see how
the men they elected will vote on this
question. As the people had called
meeting TO protest against the water
Improvements he was surprised they
had no. had meeting and remonstra-
ted against the butcher monopoly.


Mr.. Chandler earnestly advocated the
adoption Of the report, for under the
name Of farmers the market would be
filed with ""Shinners."" He was sur
prised that Mr.. Norton should censure
the City Council, as every member no
doubt voted for what he thought the
best interests Of the people. He was
opposed 70 altering the markets every
shrss months and he thought that the
last time they were fixed for . number
Of years 10 come. He alluded to the
scenes Of rOwdyism and violence that
took place at Third and King streets
some three years ago, and he hoped
that he would never sse the
like again. II farmers are allowed
10 sell, batshsrs whs pay taxes in the
sity should bs allowed 70 sell, and il
ysu make free market said Mr.. c.,
you ranst Lot the Skinner"" in, and if
that was done, them why net allow
and other merchants to
back up 70 the surbstons and sell their
goods.


Mr.. Hlssted, said that II Mr.. Norton
would watch the report Of the cattle
,alss Of the West he wsuld thea see
low much the butchers made. We had
'ons doubt whether Mr.. N would knew
. tendsrloin il lie saw one. He (Heusted)
aad never pledged himselfto anything.


Mr.. Nortor showed how meat had ad
'ancsd already since the farmers stop.
ped selling pork sn the curb. stone
market, and he also stated that beef
vas shipped from Chicago to New York,
md from thence TO England, where it
vas sold there for what we pay here.
lie wanted the butchers to live and let
i've.


Mr.. Hart advocated the report, and
Vanted the ""shinners"" kept of the
treet. ...


Mr.. Chandler contended that there is
'lenty Of room for the farmers in the
market Houses.


Mr.. McClinchey had como to the con-
fusion that the street was not the
roper place to sell meat, as the sale
ould not be controlled satisfactorily.
the farmer was allowed to come, the
simmer would come also.


The report was finally defeated by
he following vote:

The Public Buildings Committee re-

Ioval of the curb-stonr market from

report for a remonstrance

TIRED OF LIFE.

Adan. Kraus Deliberately Hangs H.,'.",,"Adan. Kraus Delt6erately Hangs Ht.,self


The coroner was notified early yesterday


morning, that man had hung himself in


the Washington House, kept by s. T


Rhuart, at 214 Washington avenue north


The coroner Immediately visited the place
and found in room in the second story
the dead body of man,
with sheet tied around his neck, hanging
against the door. His body was cut down
and taken to Wallis undertaking establish
ment.
A Gnons reporter visited the boarding
house and ascertained the following facts
from the proprietor of the house. The man
who, from papers found in his pockets, is
supposed to be Adam Kraus, came
to the house Monday evening at 6
o'clock. and asked if he could stay
all night. He had his supper and appeared
to be sick as he sat in his chair, and groaned
as if in pain several times. One of the
boarders asked him if he was sick. to which
he replied, ~ guess not"" On being ques-
toned as to where he came from, he said his
name was Adam Kraus, and that he formerly
lived near Big Stone Lake, but his wife hav-
ing died about three months ago he had since
travelled around. He said he was shoemaker
by trade, and had two daughters and son
who lived on farm in Morris county.
Kraus retired about 10 o'clock, and nothing
was seen or heard of him until about s
o'clock yesterday morning, when one of the
boarders passing by the half opened door
noticed the sheet, and looking in saw him
hanging to the door. That Kraus was tired
of life and wished to kill himself is shown
by the very deliberate manner in which he
went to work. He took sheet from the
bed, and after tying two loops in it hung it
over the door, and putting his head in the
lower loop, fell forward and choked himself
to death. In his pockets were found an old
pocket book and several papers written in
German, but not cent of money.


The coroner's inquest on the body was
held at Wallis undertaking establishment at
1880 o'clock last evening.


Charles H. VanKleek testified to finding
the body at $50 o'clock in the morning;
spoke to the deceased on Monday night
while he was walking in the dining room
but could get no answer from him; he ap-
Peared to be sick or in great mental dis
tress. ser glv1 E.1


John Lynch testified that he noticed
Kraus at the supper table and thought he
was out of his head; his eyes had an un-
natural look; thought he was under the in
huence of liquor, although he could walk
around without showing that he was drunk.


S. T. Rhaurt, proprietor of the Washing
ton house, where Kraus hung himself, was
sworn and testified that he first
saw the deceased about O'Clock
Monday night I; thought something allied
him +; he complained of bad headache had
his supper, and about 10 o'clock told me he
wanted to go to bed saw him about an hour
afterward in his room he was awake and
appeared all right.


DR.. Nelson testified to finding and exam
lining the body, and stated that the man
died from strangulation.


The jury returned the following verdict:
'sThat the deceased came to his death by
hanging, and that the deed was committed
by his own hands,"" The body will be bur
led to day at Layman's cemetery at the ex-
Dense of the county,"

On motion of Mr.. Guthrie, the rules

amendment he said: If we comply with


the request of the Board we would be
getting away from the law; the City


Council are compelled iD making up

an estimate Of their probable revenues
desire TO show you that the Board Of

read the law on the subject). He thought

duct their probable revenues. If we al
low the whole amount asked for, we 60
| contrary to. Jaw; the Board receives $1,000
from the State, and if as they say $66, 900
is sufficient to NEE. their expenses what
is TO become of the $1,000 what they get
from the State? tell you gentlemen if
the City Council acceed to their demands
why they might come here and ask for
500, 900 or $l50,OOO, and are we TO tax


the people because they demand the
money.


Mr.. Guthrie agreed with the speaker.
He thought The probable revenues should
bo deducted from a total amount.
Mr.. Price, was of the opinion that
there existed law compelling Council
to furnish The amount asked for by the
Board.


Mr.. Norton said that he would vote for
the amendment instead of 81 900 beng
deducted there should be $500. The
cry is for economy, which the Board of
Education does not heed. The teachers
salaries should be reduced they get far


too much. There are girls equally as
good as the teachers working in factories
who do not begin to get the salaries that
the teachers do.


The amendment was then..adopted and
the ordinance as amended passed unani-
| mously. The total amount appropria-


ted is $3.50, ,86 which will be found


published in another column. The


amount appropriated last year was $780,,

Tho Eene Coust Of Inau;ry-


CHICAGO, Jan. 16th.-The Reno
Court OF inquiry to-day decided
that the reporters might take notes.


Wallace was cross-examined by
Major Reno's counsel, Mr.. Gilbert.
The testimony was only develop
mont of that given yesterday. He
related how, after the division OF
Custer's command, Col. Benton
went to the left, Major Reno cross
ell the stream and General Custer
remained on the right bank; how
the two latter detachments formed
a junction by Reno recrossing about
IL miles below, and how, finally,
the battle was fought. Some of
Major ReIo's command had never
ridden horse until this campaign.
The only ammunition in the hands
OF Reun'a force were the supplies at
their saddles, and it was used up in
half an hour. In his opinion it was
wise act of Major Reno to retreat,
as to- have remained would have
been to imperil the lives Of the
whole body. Major Reno's con-
duet was brave and praiseworthy,
as, during the retreat, twenty-five
men were killed and seven wound
ed, and the time consumed was
about an hour. Arrived on the top
Of the hill Bsnten's force came up,
but the pack train was three miles
to the rear Reno showed
no sigma of fear all
this time, but WAS con-
spicuously brave and fearless.
No communication had bssn re-
ceived from Custer, but trum-
peter stated that he had gone back.
The ammunication was distributed
and Company d frat met the In
dians several thousand strong in
a ravne, where the men
were properly posted by Reno. He
had about two hundred and eighty
mer under his command at that
time. Bullels came like hail until
dark, about three hours, when for
tifioations were thrown up. Firing
recon mmenced about 8 A. NJ. on the
2sth and continued until 10 O'Clock,
when it slackensd. There were
probably niue thousand Indian
| warriors in the village that eve
ming, it being two and half or
three miles long. They first know
of Custer's fate on the 9th. They
discovered the line of battle per-
fectly evident from the dead horses
and oorpses. The position was not
we'll chosen for defence. Around
custer was file of men. There had
apparently been an attempt at es-
cape. The fight probably did not
last over half an hour. Custer had
$50 men when he separated from
Reno.


The Court decided this afternoon
that ii will not investigate the con-
duct of Benton, whose name has
been associated with Reno in this
matter.

The Teller IavestiEstion.


NEW ORLEANS. Jan. 16th.-Be.
fore the Teller Committee A. J.
Bryant, colored, Senator of Texsas,
testified that no Republican ticket
was nominated because of the
threats of the whites, who said
they would consider such action a
declaration of war. The night be-
fore election a party of whites, in
cluding Buekner and Hansboro,
came to my house, took me out in
my night clothes, carried me
quarter of q mile and threatened
me, saying 1 had sold out to- the
Bland party. L denied this and
stated that L had not seen any Of
the leaders of the Bland
party. They let me GO after
promising that 1 would come to the
polls next day and vote the regular
Democratic ticket. l compiled

rope with them and said if they
were satisfied 1 had sold out to the
Bland party they would put me

Great E.oss OF stock Fesrrd-lcgis.
Iaetve Dcadioox.


SILVER CITY, Idaho, Jan. 16th.-
The heavy snow storms and unpre.
csdented cold weather create con-
siderable alarm among stock men,
who have reason to fear that a
large number of cattle will perish
bsfore milder weather sets in.


There Is much Indignation among
the people in consequence of the
existing deadlock in the Idaho
Legislature, occurring in conse-
quence of the parties being so
evenly divided. The feeling is
general that the members should
go to work and strive to do some-
thing for the Territory, instead Of
trittsring away the time in party
squabbles, in which nothing Of any
consequence is to be gained.


Richards Sentenced TO be Hanged.


KEARNEY, Neb., Jan. 16th.-The
trial of S. d. Richards, tho self
confessed murderer of several per-
sons, was held at Mime yesterday.

The charge on which he was tried

They were mt least crimnally careless, how

gests the necessity of some intelligent

as would have rendered this impossible. ii

from Springfield to take up the work
that led through Civil War the emanci-
patton of race and the preservation OF the
Union to martyrs grave, he chose from
among his townspeople the lad John Hay,
fresh from college and the law school,
as his Confidential Secretary. Through
out that whole historic period the young
Secretary was Mr.. Lincoln's constant and
closest companion. He was then sent to
Paris as Secretary of Legation. WeaIylng
of the gay capital after time, he returned
home. hut Governor Seward promptly drafted
him again into the service, and sent him as
Charge dAffaires to Vienna while President
and Senate were quarreling over a Minister
to succeed Motley. After this he was
again sent out to Madrid, but he went

of Corn and Suffocated.


BROCKToN, Dec. ""a terrible accident took
place in the grain and flour mill of Ellis Pack
ard about five O'Clock tonight. in which three
men-C. A. Nourse Dennis Lynch and Dennis
Reardon-lost their lives by suffocation. Men
had been at work on the second floor of the
building shoveling corn for the past two or
three days, and at the time of the accident had
transferred about 5000 bushels from the eleva-
tor te the floor, where it lay in bulk. Sudden
ly, without warning, the timbers and flooring
gave way and the men precipitated about 70
feet into a cellar and buried in 5000 bushels OF
corn, which fell with them. The news spread
like widfire over the town. and in a few min
utes after the building was surrounded by
hundreds of people. Men Immediately set to
work to extricate the men. At $50 they found
the body of Nourse, the bodies of Lynch and
Reardon being discovered a few minutes later.
At this time the excitement of the crowd was
intense, and the grief of the window OF Lynch,
who was present, was heartrending. The bodies
were taken in charge by medical examiners.
The cause of the disaster is difficult to ascer-
tain. Probably the timber became somewhat
rotten and weakened. Mr.. Packard states
that he has before had a much larger amount
of grain on the floor at one time and has con-
sidered it perfectly safe. Nourse was aged 32
and leaves wife AMI child. Reardon was 20
and leaves wife and two children Lynch
was So and leaves wife and two children.
An inquest is shortly to be held"

ched down Marketstreet amid the cheers
of the citizens, and the crack of pistols
and fire crackers. and the sudden fl ,sh
OF sky rockets anc roman candles, the
trip was fairly commenced,


At the Delaware Western Railroad de-
pot the special train VIZ in waiting and
at !2.30 the train moved off amid cheers
and cries OF God speed.

committee of eight members of the
Friendship Fire CO. No. /, Of Harris burg,
where a short halt wSs matte for refresh
ments. ResumIng the ride, Harrisburg
was reached at $40 O'Clock in the morn-
ing and the company was at once taken
to the Farmers Hotel where they break
tasted. After that they had a little time
to look about them and observe how the

beautiful wreath of wax flowers. The
presentation was made In front of the
lady's residence. Tue parade halted for
that purpose and President Stevenson

The two companies then marched to
Germania Hall, where refreshments
were indulged in, and afterwards the
Wilmington company went to the Far

presented them with the wreath. They
were then escorted to the Lochiel hotel
where they sat down to u banquet given
by the Friendship of Harrisburg. There
was about one hundred and fifty persons
present, and the menu was very fine.


President Rodgers of the entertain ming
company. made a neat. speech of welcome
to the guests, and was followed by Jacob
Stevenson, who made tow remarks and
introduced Mr.. Cornelius Stinson of our
city. Mr.. Stinson was more than usually
happy In what he said. He returned
thanks to the receiving congratulated

the old age Of the Friendship Company,
and altogether made a pleasant address.

sent to borrow Mrs. Farmers mule. He
got the beast and rode away, leaving
Mrs. Farmer peacefully smoking in q
doorway, while her idiot daughter was
busy in the garden. A little distance
from the house he met his father, who
told him to take the mule back as he
should not want it after all. On re


turning, the boy found that Mrs. Far


mer had been killed by blows on the
head with an axe, the daughter fright
fully wounded, and an attempt made
to set the house on fire. Julia johnson,
an old neyress, lived near by. She
went to Atlanta on the morning after
the murder. and spent more money for
clothes than was usual. In her cabin
was found some sugar, and under the
structure a bundle of clothing, which
had been taken from Mrs. Farmers
house. On Julia's apron were spots Of
blood, and, to crown all, Miss Farmer
said that Julia was the person who
struck her down. The feeling against
her was so strong that an attempt was
made to lynch her; yet her trial has
Just resulted in her acquittal. Her
lawyer accounted for her possession of
the money that she spent in Atlanta,
demonstrated by cross examination that
Miss Farmer was mentally incompetent
as witness, and argued that .be stolen
sugar and clothing had been shyly
taken to her house by the real assassin.
He boldly declared that this guilty
man was Charles Gibson, who married
second daughter OF Mrs. Farmer after
the murder, and would have done so
before but for the mothers violent op-
position, in order to get the property.
He proved that Gibson's movements on
that day were suspicious. This start
ling defense, whether sound or not,
was effective with the jury, but Glib
son and mob tried to kill the lawyer
and his client after the verdict."

It was soon after the frenzy that the pre- dictions of Elder Miller, the apostle of the visible immediate coming of Christ, caused. In the Northern part of the city, though then the outskirts, there were number of ignorant people who met together, every day, and almost all day long held their peculiar religious services, and among them were man and woman who were even more affect- ed by the excitement than the others were. This man at length announced that sacrifice was demanded that he was called upon by the Almighty to oficiate as priest, and that the woman must give up her life as the sacrifice. He further announced that at ths end of certain time those who best remem- Der the facts say three days-th wo- mans life would be restored, and that she would be glorified thereby, and be accepted as one of the saints of the kingdom. It is now stated that some of the people who listened to him believed that he was divinely commissioned te perform the sacrifcial act. At all events, the hour and day were set, and in lit. tie room in house in the outskirts tht woman and man, and, it is said, others assembled. The woman, after prayer

 and incantations, laid upon the floor, ant the man, seizing an axe, severed he

| Dillon Obeyed this order, and before ten
o'clock, had the danger removed to an
extent sufficient to render 1t safe for
persons to walk along the street.


FORTUNATE FACT.


The house of Mrs. McGaraghy as above
stated, Immediately joined the uew
buildings on the south. But, contrary
10 general custom, the wall of her house
was not used as party wall for the hous.
immediately adjoining, and separate
wall was built This was a fortunate
fact, as bad the new house been joined
with her dwelling, the latter woDld have
been severely Jared by the accident,and
| perhaps gone down with the genera
smash.


THE CAUSE OF THE FALL.
The causes which led to the sudden
| falling of the building are as yet a my
stery. The general supposition Is, how
ever, that fall was occasioned by the
sinking Of the foundation walls, proba-
| bly, from the effects of the frost. The
cellar was dug in good, hard ground con
J tanning considerable qu nifty of rock,
| which had to be drilled out before the
walls could be laid. The suppositlon
that the sinking of the foundations eau,
ed the accident is maintained by the
fact that the wall on the rorth side OF
the cellar not only settled, but fell down
TO The ground. As to the cause of the
iefect in the foundation walls it is at
fributed by some to frost, and by others
to careless workmanship, in not using
proper care and the right kind of mater
als.





Some people also criticise the brick
work, from the fact that the walls of the
alley that extended between the Two
houses were only four inches thick. The
first floor joists extended over these
walls, and an these joists the division
wall of the houses was erected. Pract
cal builders, however, insist that TIL :
was not a serious defect, and could not
have caused the accident, as the juis',
would steady the walls and prevent
them from toppling over unless they
were assailed by an unusually strong
wind. No wind of any account prevail
ed Saturday evening, which fact streng'
thens the opinion that the cause of the
accident rested solely in tn foundation
walls.


Street Commissioner Lewis +. Lynch
whose family Is ail icted by the accident
positively expresses the opinion that
the unfortunate fall was due to defective
foundations He asserts that many
houses have been put up in thus city, OF
late, the foundations of which are entire
ly inadequate to properly support the
walls.


AN oRJECT OF CURIOSITY.


During all of Sunday the fallen build
ings were an object of curiosity, and
were visited by hundreds of persons
from all parts of the city. As each one
gazed upon the frightful looking pile o
stones, bricks and timbers,he involuntar.
lily wondered how it was seven hamar
beings could he hurled down and buriet
beneath such mass OF debris, and es
cape with their lives.

CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT, Erc.


About fifteen minutes before 6 o'clock
on Saturday evening, an accident occur
red 10 this city, which, though atte.ded
with very serious results,w was also mark
ed with an almost miraculous absence of
fatality.


The accident occurred on the W est
side OF jackson street, below Third, in
the Tenth ward. Here were being
erected two three-story brick houses for
Mr.. Patrick Sullivan, Mr.Patrick Dillon
being the contractor, while Mr.. Allen
Ruth had charge of the brick work. The
houses had bick buildings, which, on
Saturday evening, were under root,
while the third floor josts of The man
building had been lald, and tie walls
run up ready to be rooted in the first
thing on Monday morning.


About half-past five o'clock, Saturday
evering, MIR. Allen Ruth, the contract
ing bricklayer, had fl ished paying off
his employees, and all hands had left the
building, preparatory to stirling for
their homes. Suddenly, Mr.. Ruth dis
covered that his money was short, and
surmising that he must have dropped
s,me Of 1t in the buildings, went in to
look for it, followed by his four sons
Frank, William, Lewis and Charles
Charles Saloway and Louis T.. Lynch,
Jr., lad of 10 or IL years, son of Street
Commissioner Lynch. Another son OF
Mr.. Ruth's, Hamed Allen, also went into
the building, but went out again in about
u minute, and thus escaped the serious
accident that soon ensued.


After looking down in the c. liar a
few minutes, the party assembled the lad
der to the third floor joists of the build
ing nearest Third street, across which
some boards were laid Mr.. Ruth, his
sons William and Frank, and Charles
Solloway were on the third floor, and
the other three boys were slowly coming
up the ladder when the disaster occur
red. Suddenly,


WITHOUT TIE SLIGHTEST WARNING,
the north wall of the building fell in
with a terrible crash, precipitating the
| entire party into the cellar below, and
instantly covering them with mass OF
broken bricks and timbers. The front
walls and porti II of the south wall
| instantly followed, and the rear walls
also crashed III, carrying with them the
| roof OF one OF the back buildings tthe
upper one), the whole mass falling upon
the unfortunate human beings and bury
ing them completely from sight.


The noise of the falling walls aroused
the entire neighborhood, and in ""A few
| minutes twenty men were on the ground
ready and willing to render all necessary
assistance, in eXtricating the poor un'or
tunales who we're buried beneath the
| ruins. The work was one of great
difficulty. So completely were the men
and boys buried that they could not be
seen, and their cries for help alone aid
ed their rescuers, and notified them
where to direct their most effective op
erations. The heavy roof OF the back
building had TO first be raised, and then


a great mass of broken joss and bricks
cleared away before the prisoners could
even be seen.


But in a very short time space was
cleared away, and the men at work OBJ
tained glimpse of those for whnse re.


scue they were so earnestly laboring


The latter was in most pitiable plight


Mr.. Ruth was buried in mass of debris


with heavy joist bearing directly across


his back, which eiiectually prevented


him fIom moving hand or foot. Mr.
Salloway was helplessly confined be


meath loads of bricks and timbers, whil'


young Lynch was close by, with on'


joist resting across his head, and anothe


across his legs. The Ruth boys wer'


also pinned fast by the broken timber


unable to help themselves in the slight


est degree.


| With this much of their labor accom-


plisbed the men worked with redoublet


energy, and in short time the unfor


tunate prisoners were released from


their terrible situations. To effect thi


however, required skillful work, and TIN


iost across Mr.. Ruth had to be sawe'


before he could be eXtricated. Mr.. Sol


loway had both arms and both legs fas


tened by the bricks aud timbers, and bi


limbs had to be carefully released on


at time. The saw also had to be USE


before young Lynch could be release


aud carried out. Finally all seven wer


taken out, and carried into the house O


Mrs. McGaraghy, immediately adjoinin


the ill-fated buildings Oh the south.


While the work of rescue was bein


accomplished, it was deemed that som


of the party must be taken out deac


1t seemed impossible that all could fa


from such height, and be covered b


such a great pile of bricks and broke
,, timbers, without some of them being il
stantly killed. But as one by one the
. were taken out il was learned that NJ
only were all alive, but, save in one il
! stance, none of them had even sustaine
broken bone.

II viii be seen that the minority IN tne
CIV Council are not satisfied wl'n ~, 'ne
.,.s.,on of Mr.. Lynch as Street Com
w.,..,oper, and have taken the trouble to
protest against this action. on course 'ne
p...h,ic.ns were conceded the right TO
nrot..t They would have protested
.s.Inst the election of any Democrat 10
once in any way if it would serve their
nurnose Of keeping their own party men
IN once. Their purpose is to get ofnce'
and, II they could have kept their man
io by inducing Democrat to think he
had no right to vote for himself ana MS
marty .s.ociatss-that the adoption OF a
rule BY Council gave the minority the
power to prevent the choice oi omcers
by the majority-they would have been
consistent and the effect OF their actioh
Characteristic. 1t did not matter 10 that
p.rtv whether Hayes was elected or not +;
nor would It have mattered to the Repub-
lic.ns in Council whether the late Repub-
,,,., S,raet Commissioner was elected
ar not no that he could hold over and
endeayor to influence the election of The
candidates Of the Republican party at
the next city election as he did at the
last.


Il NAV be set down to the credit and
intelligence of the President OF the
Council that his name does not appeal
to the protest. Why the gentlemen
should desire it to be recorded secont
time that they had voted against tn
election Of Mr.. Lynch seems little odd
since that fact had been before so re
pestedly sta ed, recorded and printed il
all the city papers without dissent o.
denial. 1t is hardly to be supposed that
political body can bind up its member
by rule to prevent the majority from
voting. This would deprive ones con
stituents of right to representation IL
elections. In fact Mr.. Lynch's lega
right to vote is admitted by gentlemen
of the bar; and the legal right Of tn
Council to prevent his voting has been
we hear, denied by the legal adviser G
that body. Under ordinary circun
stances we admit that men should nc
vote for themselves and We admit ais
that the Council should not resort
their own body to select therefrom me
to vote into offices. But this has bee
done by both parties, and rather tina
have r publican hold over to infuen
the city election in September, we pr
ferred to see the majority elect NJ
Lynch, who is admitted by all parties
be qualified and to be possessed Of
those gentlemanly characteristics til
may make him a good and efficie


officer."

 UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO LYNCH A

 PRISONER IN ALABAMA.

 A man named Bales sentenced to be hanged at Athens, Ala. Sept 12, but the case was appealed to the Stu preme Court next term, and sentence suspended. Bales killed his wife and narrowly escaped lynching at the time. Three thousand people assembled today at noon, broke into the jail, and took Balles half mile out of town for the purpose of hang ing him, but no one would tie the knot The Sheriff then jumped into the wagon, pistol in hand, and drove BalIes back to town and lodged him in jail. The crowd slowly dispersed

 A DEFAULTER.

Great excite ment exists in town, and many are 10th to have suspicion of George Otto as he has borne reputation Tor the strictest integrity and honesty.

 THE MORMON PROBLEM.

 The New York Trt5uns's staff cor respondent in Utah gives long and careful review of polygamy. He thinks it can only bc eradicated by law making continuance of parties in polygamous relations penal of fense. At present a man can only be punished where ii can be shown that he has gone through the ceremony ot marriage with more than ono wife He thinks the Mormons would aban- don polygamy if they saw themselves in the power of the government and liable to be severely dealt with It is an historical fact, easily suscepti- bIe of proof, that polygamous was not fundamental principle of mormon ism nor chief inspiration.

 RUST IN WHEAT.

 Correspondence from sections of Oregon considered 10 have suffered greastest from rust shows that the damage from that blight, though ser ious, has not been so great as sur- posed. Grain is beginning to come in freely at all warehouses, and where not affected, is remarkable for soundness and weight. The local market for the past week has ruled dull, little wheat coming in and few vessels being in port. For Walla Walla, s1 55 is offered on the wharf !; Valley, for shipping purposes, prob ably $1 62@185."

DER TRIAL, ETC.
Especially Reported for the Gaxette.]
NEW CASTLE, May 18.-When Court
opened, this morning, the room was
crowded to its capacity, the probability
Of the DENNY murder trial coming up,
attracting general interest. A number
of persons came over from Wilmington,
solely for the purpose of attending this
trial.


The bar was so crowded that the
Court gave orders for all the legal stu
dents to leave it, until the members of
the bar were seated. The students
were then accommodated with seats on
| the benches allotted TO the grand Jury, to
the left Of the Clerks desk, which the
Court ordered to be reserved for the
members Of the general juries and the
| students.


The general and additional juries
were called, and answered.


The trial list was then taken up, and
the cases disposed of by continuance,
discontinuance, judgment, announce
ments for trial, or reference to counsel.


OF the PSI cases on the list, scarcely q
dozen were marked for trial. Some
were passed, and may be brought up
hereafter. Nearly two hundred were
continued, dropped, or settled. In the
cases of VIM. L. Croasdale VS.. VIM.
Bright, and the thirty or more Bellevue
quarry cases, trial was asked for by coun-
sci for the plaintiffs, Levi C. Bird, ESQ.,,
but counsel for the defendants, Chas. B.
Lore, Esq, annonced that he would
make application for continuance when
the cases were called for trial.


The calling Of the list occupied nearly
two hours.


George Gray, Esq, made motion fol
the admission of Chas. Beasten, Jr. late
Of the Baltimore bar, to the bar of thi,
county. Mr.. BeastOn's certificate of I'D.
mission to the bar of the United States
Supreme Court was presented, examined
by the Court, and he was ordered to bt
admitted to this Court upon taking tht
usual obligations and paying the requir
fees.


At 11:45 o'clock the witnesses for tn,
State in the DENNY murder case wer
called, and nearly all of them being pres
ent, the Attorney General announced
that the State was ready for trial. TIL,
witnesses for the defense were also called
and all but two answered. One of thes,
was Eugene X. Lynch, of Wilmington
who was Secretary of the Coroner's jur,
that investigated the DENNY murder, AM
Mr.. Bird, one of the counsel for the de
fense, asked for an attachment to secur
his presence. A telegram was also sen
to Mr.. Lynch requesting him to com
over at once.


The accused parties, Walter Flinr
George Kopp, Griffith Smith and Jane
MOnahan were brought into Court at /
O'Clock, in charge Of two bailiffs, an
placed in the dock. The important dut
of empanelling a jury was then con
? | menced.


As each juryman was called, on h
name being drawn from the box, he W,
asked by the defence, if he had formt


and expressed any opinion relative


the guilt or innocence Of the accusse,


and by theState if he had and any concie


tious scrupies against rendering verdi


of guilty, where the punishment is deaf


if the evidence shall warrant such We
dict.


The first juror sworn was Josep
Pierce, but after Alferd d. Warner,
Wilmington, on being called, state
that he had formed and expressed q
opinion from what he had read in IL
newspapers, Juror Pierce said he ha
, done the same thing.


Attorney General Pennington calle
the attention of the Court to this cas,
:. but the Court said as the juror bad bee


sworn, he could not be set aside.


When Patrick Hughes, Of Wilminf


ton. was called, the defense waived the


right to ask the usual question, but NJ


Hughes Voluntarily stated that he hs


formed and expressed an opinion. tt
y Court said he ought not to be sworn, ar
y ruled that he should not be, althoup
the defense seemed willing to accel


him.


By one O'Clock the following had BE-.


accepted as members Of the Jury:

simeon Lord, Frank II. Diehi, Georl
F. Deakyne, John F. Reybold, Merri

There were 10 challenges by the defen
IA and none by the State. or the nam
y called, eleven had formed and express

cused on account OF sickness, and {,

PACIFIC STEAMSHIP WRECK.


SAN Francisco, April 2O.-A dispatch
from Astoria says the Great Republic is GO
ing to pieces. No lives lost. Passengers
transferred to the Astoria. The captain and
crew, ashore on Sand island, will be taken
off this afternoon. The freight and baggage
is total loss. Last night the wind rose and
heavy sea began to roll in and is breaking
now where the vessel lies. All accounts
agree that the disaster was due to an at
tempt to enter at night when it was very
dark. The ship was badly out of her course.


ANOTHER ACCOUNT.


SAN FRANCISCO, April 2O.-A special from
Astoria at APO this afternoon says the tugs
Brennan and Columbia just returned from
the wreck of the Great Republic. Captain
Davis, pilot Diaz, boatswain, name unknown,
and ten other seamen and walters are still on
board the vessel endeavoring to save the
freight and baggage, but with very poor sue
cess in consequence of the severity of the
storm. At 1925 the last tug arrived
bringing news that at 12
O'Clock the last boat left the ship
with first officer Lennon, Mr.. Davis, second
officer, the boatswain, two sailors, eight
walters, ten of whom, Lemon, Davis the
boatswain and seven others were drowned by
capsizing of the boat in the surf. Three
men clung to the boat and drifted ashore.
The ship is going to pieces, and is breaking
up very fast. The main mast fell during
the night. Capt. Carol has from the very
first maintained great discipline and order,
and up to the very last by in
spring the passengers with confidence
of safety prevented a panic. All landed
without loss of life. The town is full of
people, many of them without money. The
churches, public buildings and residences
are all being thrown open for the accommo-
dation of passengers who have lost every.

piling an immense wreck in the creek below.
All the cars were soon wrapped in flames,
and with their contents entirely consumed.
The engineer stood at his post to the last,
only saving himself by jumping as the engine
turned over. The fireman jumped before
reaching the trestle. Conductor Murray had
his leg broken. Two men were sleeping in
a car of household goods, and we're buried in
the wreck. Mr.. Bailey was badly injured
when rescued. The other, young man,
could not be saved, the fire spreading so rap
idly all efforts had to be abandoned. Con-
ductor Jones was close behind with an extra
train. He rendered all the assistance he
could, and took the wounded back to Kear-
ney, where they received medical assistance.
Mr.. Bailey and the young man were from
| Illinois on their way to Kansas. AT Quincy
MIR. Bailey put his family on the passenger
train and thus saved them.

HaV a ( century.",,"BISHOP LEES HISTORICAL SERMON
THIS MORNING ON THE OCCASION OF
THE sEMI-cENTESNrAL ANNIvER-
sARY OF ST. ANDREWS CHURCH.


Reverend Bishop Lee, at the opening
semi-centennial anniversary Of st. An
drews church, this morning, preached
sermon upon the history Of that sane
tuary. Previous to The sermon, the pro-
gramme given In yesterday paper was
gone through with.


The text was LevIticus XIV chapter,
llth verse ""a jubilee shall that fiitieth
year be unto you ye shall not SOW,
neither reap that wi ich groweth of itself
IN It, nor gather the grapes in 1t OF the
vine nndressed.""


In commencing, the bishop said that
the text had left All impression on the
httieth year Of Importance to more than
the children of Israel. lie spoke at some
length upon the year of jubilee, and al
luded to the great event In honor of
which II was held. he dawn OF this
was shown by the coming of the Son OF
Man, tie elimination, by his coming in
| glory. Since the church In which these
services were being held had been found
ed so much time toward the coming of
the Lord had elapsed, and the world was
hf years nearer to the end. The night
was far spent and the day was near at
hand.


The speaker then looked back over the
past history Of st. Andrews Church. The
first move tending 10 establish 1t was
caused by desire upon the part OF the
Episcopalians of Wilmington to have a
church more conveniently located than
Old Sweies Church. The space between
the part of town In which IL was situated
and the section in which St. Andrews is
now built was covered with open fields.
This led to meeting in 1914, when the
episcopal Association Of the Borough
Of Wilmington"" WAS formed with John
Lynch as Chairman, aud James Groom,
| Secretary.


This association purchased lot at
sixth and King stredts, (then Sixth and
Hanover), but in lSl the plan was re
iuctintly abandoned and the lot sold to
pay expenes incurred. In 1928 rene W.
ed effort was mace and a new assoc alton
was formed. 1t was now successful, and
""A church was opened at Market and
Twelfth streets, with Rev. j. Rowland
Coyt as rector. Before the end of the
year the congregation felt warranted IN
taking steps necessary to the erection OF
""A church.


a lot was accordingly purchased on tn,
). w. corner of Eighth and ShipleS
streets, and 1t was decided to build tn,
editice of stone. Tie building was com
menced In May 1922, and was tinshot
in October of the same year. 1t wa.
dedicated on Oct ]. At that time th,
| oh haH t,tn -

Among the early members was the ven
erable Dell Noblitt, and he lived longe
than any other charter member. In th'
records of the Diocese of Delaware 70
1880 report is found, which shows tn,
congregation lad increased to fifty lami
lies by that time.

COLUMBIA, S. c., Dec. 2d.-The
State Congressional delegation, to
to whom has been referred the re-
quest from the Commissioner,
Walker, to divide the State into
three districts, has met In caucus,
and, in addition to the duties i'm
posed, has recommended for Super
visors Of Census, Harry Hammond
of Beech Island, J. X. Vance Of
Greenville, and Judge Townsend Of
Marlboro. Prominent Republicans
are strong in their opinions and
these men, If appointed, would not
hesitate to cover up election frauds
during the past four years. In
Edgefield, for instance, where the
Democratic managers returned a
vote of nearly half the population,
and in Aiken, where the Demo-
cratic vote exceeded the total vote
of the county, these gentlemen can
and, it is believed, will return fig
ures to sustain the Democratic fig
ures In the election returns. The
men are said to be strong friends OF

that bore such a conspicuous part

At 8 o'clock the ticket office was clcsed, and no more admissions were granted, the hall be- ing perfect jam. A little after the ap- pointed time the curtain rose, ''the elephant round"" and the play proceeded, ahd all who witnessed it pronounced it one of Canaan's best efforts, all the actors ac- quitting themselves with credit. Mr. A, P. Briggs as Geo. Peyton, carried his part well-it's a way he has and he is . val uable auxiliary of the association. Frank in his free-and-easy, natural way, took Salem Scudder to perfection. and his acting was highly spoken of. D. !.

Sunny side, with his ''very odd indeed, sir"" beard, and portly dimensions, was 'some pun kins."" Mr. D. L. Peirce as the auctioneer. conducted the auction scene with such life like energy that we almost expected to hear somo one in the audience raise McClosky' 8 bid to $3O, 1000. The difficult character of the ""much big Indian"" found its match in Pete. Hicks. who could shriek the top of a mans head off without scalping knife. and in his unique costume, he was an in terssting character. O. w. Bassett, with hia big silver buttons, represented Capt Rats, with pompous dignity. w. M. Deming assumed the character of Jackson, and as he was ""a leetle deaf"" he was con- tinually tangling bimself up in his auction bids; Frank Barpum was Jules Thibodeaux and ''kept tally"" behind half yard of black mustache; Eugene Root as Judge CAillou was an advocate of lynch law under the appellation of justice"" Paul, solon and old Pete, the darkeys. were on hand every time. and the ability with which they handled their parts is only equaled by their everyday modesty, and the size of their feet. Zoe, the octoroon, was impeTson- ated by Mrs. Mollie Bailey, and it is un- necessary to say that the part was rendered with life like straightforwardness as Mollie has long since established her reputation as . ''star"" local actress. Miss Ella Bailey acted the part of Mrs. Pcyton. in her prim, huslress-liks way, and fully sustained heI dramatic reputation.

Little Johnny Lynch, three-year old

street car between the Middle depot and
Rising Sun, and who lives In the depot
building, was left alone IN the house for
few minutes by his mother, on Satur-
day afternoon, aud while she was out
side she heard the child scream. Hur-
rying IN she found the little fellow EN-.
veloped IN flames and the sofa also on
fire. The fire was quickly put out aud
doctor called In, but all efforts were OF
no avail and the little sufferer died early
Sunday morning.


The only theory advanced as to how
the child's clothing caught fire is that he
