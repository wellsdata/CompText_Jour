resource was aided by spreading sails to catch water

on board were saved from dying Of thirst The unusual
length of the voyage is attributed to the extremely

Battling head winds constantly retarded her. On
several occasions Captain Walter attempted to make

story is much exaggerated, and that the statement
respecting a Cody being hung by order OF Capt:
Jackson is wholly unfoUnded. The Kate Hooper fell
in with the ship Flying Childers of Boston, at sea- and
was indebted to her assistance in quellng the mutiny
and in securing the Coolies who had set fire to the

County nominees at the head of our columns
and point to them with PRIDE as men that
can and will receive the support of every
genuine Democrat, and many Others who
have not heretofore acted with the Democ-
racy.


For Supreme Judge, is presented the name
of Joseph p. Baldwin, of San Francisco, a
gentleman whose legal abilities even our
opponents speak of in terms of high COM
mendation.


The candidate for Controller of State, is
A. R. Meloney, late Senator from San Joa-
quin and Contra Costa counties, who is spo-
ken of by those who know him best, as a
man well fitted for the position.


At the head of the county ticket, for Sen
ate, is James Anderson, ESQ., who so ably
and honestly represented the county last
winter, in the same branch of the Legislature.
He reflected credit upon himself and his
county, and the people have determined to
send him back by large majority.


On the Assembly ticket is VIM. G. STRAIT
ton, Of Dutch Flat, one of the old members.
His nomination is an Endorsement of the
action of the delegates on the engrossing
Kansas issue of last winter. He was a GOOD
member-firm, attentive to his duties, and
| independent. His former experience will
be OF much benefit to him in another session.
Mr.. Barclay is a new man in the political
arena, but comes we'll recommended, as a
young man of ability, integrity, and indus
try. His nomination is regarded as an ex-
cellent one. Mr.. b. is resident of Iowa
Hill, where he is engaged in mining. Philip
Lynch, Of Secret Ravine, is well known
throughout the county. lie is one of the
oldeat residents, throughly identified with
the interests of the county, and an unswerv-
ing emocrat through sunshine and storm

we do, as from our test and oldest citizens
and well qualified for the positions to which
they are nominated. There are no weak
men among them.


Altogether it is the best ticket ever nom
mat d in the county, and from all quarters
we hear Of it meeting hearty Endorsement
from the people. And furthermore it is a
winning ticket-there is not a man on it but
will be elected by a large majority. We'd
nesday, the first day Of September, will prove
this.

that nominees should be large property hol-
ders before entitled to official position in our
county, but do conclude that voters will ask
and require from men who present themselves
for office, that their residence here shall not
be contingent upon getting their living from
the public treasury.


Aside from this wanted requisite in the
ticket we find it weak, decidedly weak, in
point of ability. 1t will be the scrub horse
in the race.


ASSESSMENT ROLL FOR lS5S.-The County
Assessor returned the Assessment Roll for
1853 of the property of this county, on
Monday last. The amount foots up to
$3,l7O693, The full assessment last year
was S2,12l,s36 3s-this makes an increase
for the past year of $S57,S56 so. A sup
Elemental tax roll, yet to be returned will
make this increase more than 81 100000
The above is telling evidence Of the increas-
ing prosperity of Placer county, and the in
dustry and efficiency of our present Assessor,
}. W. Spann, Esq, and his deputies. A few
such returns from the mining counties of
the State, as the above, would leave no op-
portunity to our neighbors of the agrcutu-
raj counties to declare that they pay all the
property tax

of Columbia, Tuolunne county, was taken

our readers willremember was shot while at
tempting to arrest Morgan and some other
thieves. On November 3Oth, Pancho Daniel

Angeles, was taken from the Jail of that town
and hung; the mob meeting with little or no
resistance. These two men most unquestiona-
bly, deserved hanging, but that fact should
have been demonstrated by fair legal trial.
These rash acts of maddened people seem to
be as much in vogue as they were in earlier
days when the courts of justice were too often
but places of refuge for guilty criminals and
the more frequently they occur, the more diff
cult does it become to repress their re-enact-

OF the laws provisions, and we should be glad

S. w. Lowell, to the chair, and VIM. X.
Parkinson as Secretary. James Anderson,
Esq our popular nominee for the State Sen
ate, being called for, took the stand, and
made an excellent speech. He was followed
by Messrs. Stratton and Lynch, nominees
on the Assembly ticket. The meeting was
not full turn out Of the Democracy of the
precinct, but was fully as large as was anti
cipated, as but few hours notice of it had
been given. At the conclusion, resolutions
heartily sustaining Mr.. Buchanans admins
tration, and ratifying the State and County
nominations were passed; and after giving
three rousing cheers for James Buchanan,
the crowd dispersed.


The Auburn Brass Band were present on
the occasion.


On Mondey evening Messrs. Anderson
and Stratton addressed goodly number of
the Democracy of Opbir. After the adjourn
ment of the meeting, we understand, Joe
Scobey, the Broderrk Republican candidate
for County Clerk, essayed to enlghten the
people on political subjects. Our readers
may think we are trying to impose upon
their credulity, but we are in earnest. Sco-
bey spoke-he did


On Tuesday evening"" Messrs. Anderson,
Stratton and Lynch addressed the Democra-
cy of Stewart Flat. The meeting was an
excellent one. The resolutions passed, and
appearing in another column, show the Dem
ocrats of the Flat to have the true grit.
Scobey appears to have been on hand, but
he was too small a card TO win.


On Wednesday evening, Messrs. Anderson
Stratton and Lynch, addressed the Democra-
cy of Pine Grove. On Thursday evening,
Stratton and Lynch We're at Beus' Bar, and
on this, QFnday) evening, Messrs. Anderson
aud Stratton, are advertised to speak at Rat
tlesnake.


The ball is fairly opened in Placer county
by the Democracy, who are ready and eager
for the contest. They have flung their ban
ner to the breeze, and 10 not intend to fur
it until the victory is won.


The American and Brodeiick Republican
nominees have not made their appearance in
the field as yet. 1t is hoped they will show
themselves to the people before the election,
as there is some anxiety to know what sort
Of legislative timber their conventions lave

other OF those horrible incidents oc-
cured in which Kanzas has become
so prolific. For long time, a bitter
personal quarrel has been going on
between Col. GAIUs JENKINS, one of
the treason prisoners in the Sunfmer
Of 1856, and Gen. JAS. II. LANE,
growing out of a contested land claim.
1t seems that Mr.. JENKINS was in the
habit Of getting water from well
on the disputed claim LANE denied
him tho privilege, and fastened up the
well in some manner, so that it was
not accessible to JENKINS, At the
time of the bloody tragedy, Mr.. JEN-
RINs had visited the well for water,
taking with him an AK to remove i'm
pediments which might be found in
his way and, in consequence OF
threats made by LANE, four friends
accompanied him with weapons for
his protection.


Gen. LANE came out of the house,
and forbade Mr.. JENKINS from APP
proaching--telling him that if he
persisted in doing SO, he should Ger.
tainly shoot him. JENKINS contin-
ued to advance, when LANE retired to





the house, returning at once with a
shotgun. This was immediately
discharged, depositing some ninety
eight shot in the breast, abdomen and
legs OF Mr.. j., killing him almost in
Stantly. One Of Mr., J.'s friends af-
forwards fred upon LANE, severely
wounding him in the fleShy part Of
the leg, The excitement ran very
high for time, and threats Of lynch
ing followed, a warrant, however,
was issued by Justice LADD, and an
examination of the case came off on
Friday, which was still in progress
as we SO to press


We have no disposition to indulge
in comments, as the case will un-
doobtedly undergo thorough judi
cial Investigation. Mr.J. had many
warm personal friends, and leaves q
wife and several children to mourn
their melancholy bereavement.-

toral letter to the clergy and laity of that
denomination. Among other subjects to which


it refers is the slavery question. We make


the following extract:
The peaceful and conservative character of


our principles, which are adapted to every
form os government and every state of society,
! has been tested and made manifest IN the
great political struggles that have agtated
| the country on the subject Of domestic slave
ry. Although history plainly testifes that
the church has alway befricnded the poor and
| laboring classes, and efiectualy procured The


mitigation Of the evils attached to servitude,
| until through her mild influence ii passed
/ away from tho nations of Europe, yet she has
| never disturbed established order or endan-
gered the peace of society by following ,heo-


ries OF philanthropy.


| Faithful to the teachings and example Of
| the apostle, she has always taught servants
| to obey their masters, not serving to the eye
merely, but as to Christ, and in His name she


commands masters to treat their servants with
! humanity and justice, reminding them that


they have also a Master in heaven. We


have not, therefore, found it necessary to


modify our teaching with view of adapting
t


has been no agitation on this subject. Our
| clergy have wisely abstained from all inter
! ference with the judgment Of the faithful,
which should be free on all questions of poll
| cy and social order, within the limits of the


doctrine and law of Christ. We exhort you,


venerable brethren, to pursue this course SO
becoming ""the ministers of Christ and disrer


sers Of the mysteries Of God"" Let the dead

cares and anxities of political partnership, the


struggles for ascendancy, and the morttca-
tions of disappointed ambition. Do not, in


any way, identify the interests Of our holy
| faith with the fortunes of any party; but
/ kind, study only to win to truth the deiuded


children of error, and to merit the confidence
/ OF your tiocks, SO that, becoming all to all,
/ you may gain all to Christ.


Circamstantial Eridenee. falhbility
! of human testimony is such that it must be
/ acknowledged we cannot believe our own
/ eyes. A case very similar to one which oc


Cured some months since at Poughkeepsie,


New York, in which girl positively identi


fed the remains of a deceased person as those
| of her sister, and on the strength of which a
| young man was arrested for murder, but in


which case suspicion was averted by the re-
appearance OF the supposed murdered girl,


has occurred at Joliet, Illinois.


A body of a female was found in a ravine


near Joliet; farmer testified TO the finding


of bloody clothes near the spot; four families
! testified TO the hearing of screams from the


ravine Oh the night of the supposed murder,

POKER PoIsr, Calaveras county, I",,"All Fools Day, 1853.


MR. EDITOR 1t "" hasn't rained nor
nothing here for the last week, forit had
no chance, and the thirsty miners don't

ty Bar, onthe Mokelumne river, and from
the appearance it presents | would pro-
nounce 1t an inexhaustable mine. The
next place of note is Poverty Bar, where
quite extensive preparations for gardening
can be seen; new buildings are going up
IN every direction, some very substantial
ones, too, which establishes the fact that
the residents of Poverty have faith in the
permanency Of the place. The most noted
House here is the ''Bon Ton"" kept by
Richard Martin, who is as polite as a
dancing master, and always on hand to
wait on those who favor him with a call.
At the Bon Ton may be found a general
assortment OF all those fancy refreshments
which are usually kept in upper-tendom.
Dick makes an excellent cock tail, and for
less than dozen of them to produce in
toxlcatlon, is out of the question.


The sports are playing lively string
now, as they are under the impression
that the Gambling Law is a dead cock in
the pit, and if a ""Josh"" comes along with
any tin in his pockets and is on the
buck"" he can be accommodated with
either monte, rondo, ""draft' or anything
in the ""keerds""


The camp, at present, is well-stocked
with bummers and lunch-eaters of the
different varieties, who may be readily
found. The sporting hummer, the whisky
hummer, the dance house hummer and
the general hummer, are all doing a
thriving business. The latter, l think
has the best chance of any, for he is
always on the look out for ""sleepers"" and
never lets an opportunity slip by when he
thinks there is chance to make scratch
Stop. here is the professional hummer,
had almost forgot to notice, whose time
has been for several weeks occupied in
robbing Cinnamon. This game they have
reduced to science; not only on the
Cinnamon is it played, but on any one
that is supposed to have few dollars, and
susceptible of operation; only some three
days ago the store of Mr.. Wambo was
entered in broad day light and $50 taken
1t is my honest opinion that the fraternity
would all do we'll to make themselves
scarce, for should any of them fall into
the hands of Judge Lynch, the "" High
land saoing"" would be the last "" act"" il
which they would appear-the Hangtowr
man and Yuba giant to the contrary, not
withstanding.


We will now take look at Sand Hills
one mile below Poverty; at this place may
be seen some of the most extensive opera
tions in the southern mines; the Hill is
about three -fourths of mile long, and is
all claimed; sixty of the claims are now
being washed away, by the hydraulic
process; the natural advantages for work
ing are unsurpassed in the State, being
from 80 to IS feet above the Mokelumne
river, the miners can run off their tailings
for lifetime, without the trouble usually
caused in hydraulic sluicing. At the
upper end of the Hill are the claims Of
Messrs. Dutton & Co., which are the
richest that have yet been opened; from
one pan of dirt they took So, and from
80 to 1926 are common prospects in
their claim. AT the same end of the Hill
Messrs. Hadley & Fouts, (late of your
town, have claims which are now opened
and paying 81 and sS per day to the man.


Quite serious accident occurred on
the south end of the Hill, last week. A
man by the name of John Ross had his
shoulder badly broken, and was other
wise badly bruised by the caving of a
bank of earth; he will probably recover.
For the present | will close. ""No, stop""

The discussion of the Washington Po-
ice Bill in Congress, has disclosed an
alarming state of public anarchy and
disorder at Washington. Grave Sena-
tors and Representatives have solemnly
declared that life and property was not
secure under the municipal government
Of the city, and that Congress was called
upon, as public duty, to provide:a large
force to preserve public order, and pro-
tect the lives and property of those who
may visit the National Capital. Senator
Douglas said, ""human life was no longer
safe in the streets of Washington"" and
SO far from impeaching the notifying
declaration, other Senators, who spoke
on the subject, admitted it to be too true.
Crime in its most dangerous forms--riot,
robbery, arson and murder-rule the
city. The honest and peacef ful citizens
are in constant dread, even in the day
time--and at night their danger is in.
finirely enhanced by the shield which
darkness gives TO the assassin, the rioter,
and the robber.


Last week young man, messenger
of the Treasury Department was shot
dead on one of the most public streets
early in the evening, by gang OF rob-
bers. Near the same spot, and in broad
day a clerk in the Interior, perfectly
respectable man, was assailed and shot
at by a gang Of rowdies. He rushed
into the house of friend. The rufiians
besieged the house in force, until they
learned by accident that they had mis-
taken their man. They departed upor
the scent Of blood in another direction
On Friday of the previous week a pitch
ed battle between some fremen tool
place. One young man was killed, ant
three wounded. On the next night, tw
citizens were shot by unknown assass
ins, and one of them desperately, if no
mortally wounded, within the shadow O
the Capitol. The next day, being Sun
day, was the carnival Of rioters. The.
fought through the public streets all da.
and all night, with firearms, with wha
result it is not worth while to describt
Crime and violence have attained such


sway that the citizens have been oblige
in selfprotection to organize a vigilanc
committee, and lynch law be adopted q
the only efficient code, if Congress doe
not interpose to protect the inhabitant.
The streets of Washington, which fey
years ago, were as quiet ahd peaceful a
those Of country village, have becom
scenes Of more outrageous violence an
crime than the vilest purlieus Of Ne,
York and Philadelphia. In tracing tn
causes of this terrible change, Senate
Fessenden, in speech upon the Polio
Bill in the Senate, suggested a reaso
which we doubt not has had powerful
influence in producing it. He said, II
my judgement, much Of the difficulty
owing to the very bad example whic
has been set in very high quarters.
it had been the case that assaults com
mitted.by men of position and standir
in this city had been noticed as the
should have been, and disapproved I
they should have been, instead of beir
approved and defended as they were,


believe we should hardly have had tt
state of things which we are now wi
Messing in this city. / have no bell
that the poor, the ignorant, the uned
Gated and the vicious, have any vel
great hesitation about following exampl
that are set them by the educated, al

20_1858-07-21_p4_sn83030213_00206530595_1858072101_0132,New-York daily tribune.,01,1858-07-21,p4,,,"We have heretofore given the particulars of the
case Of Mr.. Bowers, citizen of Kent County,
MARYLAND, AID of the tarring and feathering to
which he was subjected. Mr. Bowers, respect
able farmer, who, like many others IN that county,
owns no slaves and cutivates bis farm with bis
OWL hands, bad, it seems made himself obnoxious
to bis .layeholdng neighbOrs BY bis free ayowh OF
Anti. Slavery sentiments. There has been OF late
years considerable running away among the slaves
Of Kent County, and an attempt was recently
made to fix upon Mr. Bowers the charge of assist
ing in their escape. Some negroes who had been
detected in an attempt to run away were induced,
BY threats of punishment and promises not to sell
them out of the county, to charge Mr. Bowers
with furnishing them With forged pass. Upon
the strength of this statement, Mr.. Bowers was
indicted, but upon trial was acquitted and dis
charged. Thereupon the shareholders resolved to
take the law into their own hands. Some thirty OF
them got together, and, having masked and other
wise disguised themselves, planted themselves In
ambush near Bowerss houie. Bowers was en-.
tced out at midnight under pretense that his assist
apce was needed to aid traveller whose carriage





wood, stripped, taned and festhered, and COM
psled to promise that he would leave the State.


This outrage, however, did not meet tho ap-
prova of all or Of majority Of the nhabtants Of the
county. Bowers, by the aid of bis wife, who,
alarmed by his cries, came to his rescue and who,
though in an advanced state of pregnancy, suffered
herselfa good deal Of violence at the hands of the
ruians, was able to identify several of the number.
Upon his complaint, eight of them have been bound
over for trial, and, meanwhile, the affair has be-
come the occasion of no little excitement Nearly
all the nonslaveholders take sides with Bowers,
and are highly indignant against those who took
part in tbs outrage. Several fights have occurred
between the two parties, at which the Pro-Slsvery
men seem to have got decidedly the worst Of it,
One of these fights came of at Beair at the late cele
biation of the Fourth of July, on which occasion
the Bowers men are stated to have knocked down
some five. and dtwenty Of their opponents, and to
have run two Of the tar and esthering men out Of
town. This has led to grand muitering Of the
shareholders, held at Chestertown, at which, also,
numbers Of shareholders from the neighboring
counties attended, called, it is stated at the sug
gestion of the Agricultural Society of tho county,
to take into consideration the proper measures to
promote the better security of their slave property.
This meeting was presided over BY Judge Chambers,
and was addressed by James A. Pearce, one of the
Maryla land United States SenatOrs who seems to
have taken very active part in the business. Mr..
PeMce complained bitterly Of the losses which the
shareholders suffer. OF late years the slaves have
escaped in gangs, a. many as ten or twelve going
of at once, taking with them the best hOrses and
carriages of their owners, and under circumstances
which showed a preconcerted plan. Bowers was
suspected ard believed 10 have aided and abetted
in these operations, and ., no legal remedy could be
had against him, some respectable citizens Of
"" the county"" took it upon them to drive him out
Of the State. Mr.. Pesrce seemed quite astonshed
that body should object TO this method of pro-
cedure or should undertake to apply similar pro-
cess Of lynch law TO those concerned ia it Either
this spirit must be crushed, or conservative people
must cell their lands to Northern f0r Whist they
could get, and seek home elsewhere.


A series Of resolutions was passed justifying the
Outrsge upon Bowers, and pledsing the persons s,-
senbled to sustain the operators against punishment
or violence. 1t remains, however, to be seen
whether the non. shareholders will be thus cowed.

SAN FRASCIsCo, Feb. 20, 1853


The pubic mind of the State has just been startled
by an appeal to Lynch-aw in Placer COUNTY. Some
weeks ago Mr.. Murphy bought, from negrJ
named Brscy, piece of ground near Auburn, the
sounty seat of Placer. Day before yesterday, at ,
O'Clock Murphy went to the ground aud found Bracy
fencing il; the former demonstrated, ana was turn
ing TO 20 away when Bracy struck MIN the back of
the head with pick, driving the point three or four
inches into the BRAIN and infctinS a mortal wound
Such is reported TO be Bracys statement for 80
far ss it appears there was witness TO the tragedy
Immediately after the affair Bracy went into town.
told what he had done to the Sheriff, gave himself up
and was imprisoned. At o'clock yesterday morning
mob seized the Sheriff and his deputies, broke the
Jail doors open with sledgehammers, took Bracy out
10 tree and hung him. The rope was not put on
properly, and the knot came just under his chln 80
thst though very uncomfortable 1t did not interfere
with his breathing He hung about minute, but
could not stand IT any longer, and cried OUT LORD
God gentlemen! can't die this way"" He was then
Bet down and the knob placed at his where 1t be-
longed, when he again hosted up, and earth soon
passed away for Bracy.


II 10 said that Bracy killed a Chinaman near the
same ground year ago, when there was no witness
to the transaction and was acquitted on his own
ftatement OF the occurrence.

Congress has given 10 California all the swamp ant
sverhowed land within her limits, but there Is som,
question az 10 what land il swamp and overt0wed.
Huch that is covered with water during the rainy
season is dry in the Summer and Fall. The u. ;
Surveyors make their surveys during the dry season
and return all the land then surveyabe as not swsnI

Government. The State Surveyor General objects &c
this, and has sent communication 10 the Legislature
about il. He estimates the land, whose title - de-

and nearly al OF 1t very valuable land, The Legsla.
ture has done nothing regard 10 the matter yet and
probably Will do nothing. j have not examined The
act of Congress, but my impression is that the L. s.
surveys have been properly made.


The Legislature has adopted series of resolutions
requesting Congress TO grant 10 the State the fort
reaoubt at Monterey, 10 be used for Military OF
other state School The property is worth nothing 10
the Federal Government, and would not be worth
much to the State.


DIR. Henry Bates, late State Treasurer, was pu,
upon trial at Auburn, in Placer County dsy before
Yesterday, on the old charge of having embezzled

will give one thousand dollars for any one Of the
persons engaged in the late mob hanging Of Pan
cho Daniel, at Los Angeles. 1t is very proper
for the Governor to so remark but what would
his Excelency do with one of them, il delivered
in accordance with the price olTered' Tn his in
augural the Governor breathed forth a good deal
of threatenings and slaughter against all princi


pals, aiders or abettors in lynch executions, but
Notwithstanding numerous persons have been
Illegally extirpated, our lawpresorving magis-
trate hasn't caused any lawdeher to smoke, in
any considerable degree. We suppose his Excel
lencys observations at that time to be consid-
cred purely allegorical. We fear that in a
moment of excitement our Governor cut out more
work than he will be able to make up during his
term, and example has shown that, instead Of the
official alrocity threatened he has erred in the
possession Of supplemental bowels of compassion."

The same Committee, Mr.. VAN vALKENBURGH
IN the Chair, passed the bin 10 change the names OF
Richard Monroe and Emma Elizabeth Kenmore to

Also, took up the bill TO provide for the payment of
certain expenses OF Government lAppWpiates -, 100
To pay postage on newspapers ana documents.
Mi. LYNCH moved to amend 50 az TO include letter

Mr.. HUTCHINSON doubted whether this amend
meht could be legally made. As documents are pre-
sumed 20 be Tor the benefit OF the people, there is



them. But letters are equally presumed TO be private
the postage upon which should be paid by members.
He should opI Ose the amendment.


Mr. LYNCH received three dollars a day for his
services and he was taxed about half that sum for
postage. He would limit the letter stag 10 letters
s@u..


sons for opposing the amendment.


Mr.. LANING also opposed the ameidmen' l. was
attempt 10 get round the Constitution.


Mr.. EMANS was opposed to taxing the people 20
nav for hs private correspondence.


Mr. HUBBARD thought postage should be paid on
letters sent by members but in view of the existing
statute, he could not vote for the amendment The
provision, however, should be made. If il was not,
the time would soon come when poor man could not
afford TO hold seat in tue Legislature.


Mr.. DAYTON alluoed to the expense which mem.
bers are put to i'll holding seat in the House, aud
favored the idea suggested by the amendment. Men,
ters of Congress have frank, why should not the
postage of members Of Assembly be paid This ques-
ton OF postage was but paltry affair II larger mat
ers attended TO, the State could well afford to
pay the letter postage OF members.


Mr. HUTCHINSON further opp 5sed the amend
ment.


Mr.. HANFORD ;houshtitwas more important that
letter postage should be paid than the stage the
great mass 0l waste payer that II sent Cn under the
Mr.. BARNES thought the Constitution so fixed the
compensaton of members that it would be improper
to pay their letter postage.


Mr.. LYNCH was aware of the provision of the
Constitution. II alluded 10 the per dem allowance
oGly of members. All other State officers had their
postage paid. Why should not Membersc If Assembly
If letter postage violated the Constitution, so did
document postage.


MIR. ENt;S thought the document portage va. un-
constitutional and he was disposed 10 vote against

the amendment. Ii was wholly improper. He was not

is ISDIAsA-The citizens Of Noble County, having
become weared by the depredations and rascalties
committed by the band Of outlaws who have 20 long
infested that county, have risen to the number OF
several hundreds with the determination to nd them
selves Of the scoundres. They have arrested several
of the most notorious offenders, and keep them 10
custody. One named Malcom Burnham or Banum,
q wholesale counterfeit dealer was induced, under
threat of hanging TO make full confession and gave
up the names of his accompces in that and atjoining
counties. TweDty.eight Of the accused are now IN
the hands Of the Regulators, twenty at Lgonisr and
eight at Albion.


Serious thoughts were at one time entertained Of
executing summary punishment on the Ofendesi but
vote being taken at a meeting OF several hundred
citizens, and majority being opposed % procss%g
10 such an extremity their lives spared and they
will be handed TO the civil power. where II 10 70
be hoped they will meet their deserts


Much as we deprecate such violent proceedings, and
opposed are 10 supersediDg the legal trlbpnsls
by Judge Lynch's speedy and severe code, we must
admit that there many circumstances TO justify the
people of Noble County. They have long been Cursed
By the presence Of a numerous and well-organiIed
gang Of scoundre, who have get the laws at dehsnce
them TO escape with impuDty. II has been almost
impossible to convict any who might be arrested and
20 bieak up the gang by lawful means was imprscti
cable. The citizens have at length taken the matter
into their own hands, and, we hope, will make
thorough woik and rout ont the entire gang. The
prosperity well as the reputation Of the county de-
mands it.


A lawyer who went from this city to endeayor 10
obtain the Liberation Of the accused was looked upon
as an eccompce or at least as an alder and abetor
Of the scoundres, and was summarily arrested and
confined with bis supposed confederates. After being
held in durance two or three days, he was liberated
and lodged back at 240 speed, wiser and better
man, glad to find his neck unstre.ched even though
minus his expected fee. II fhs method Of treating AZ

Is the statement, now almost stereotypGd, of our


telegraphic dispatches. Such announcements
are sufficient ex elanation of the extraordinary
debate in the U. S. Senate last Monday. Sena-
tor Seward, always exceedingly cautious in his
statements, described the condition of affairs in
Washington as reign of terror. Mr.. Douglas
declared that no mans life was safe even on
Pennsylvania avenue. Mr.. Iverson thought
the only remedy was in making the city mill
tary station for 300 or 400 soldiers. In short,
:here seemed to be entire unanimity of opinion
upon the point that Washington is the most de-
HIoralzed and the worst governed city in the
United States. With population ofabout Co.
900, the murders for some time past were sta
ted by member of Congress to have been at
the rate OF one and half per day.


Such state of things is disgraceful to the
whole country, because the condition of the
federal metropolis will be more or less taken as
representative of the whole country. We are
glad to see that Congress has taken the subject
in hand, and has SO increased the police force
as to arrest criminals, if not to suppress crime
But the inquiry Is pertinent, how came Wash
ington, favored beyond all other cities in the
Union, to its present bad eminence ="" The
cause, to certain degree, is probably to be
found in the anomalous position of the city as a
capital, subject TO The control of body ofI
strangers The sluices of public patronage
disseminate a corrupting influence and attract
an element Of population already corrupt. In
consequence of this feature, magistrates that
would be lynched on the Western prairies, se-
cure of protection under the wing of party,
have had their own way without regard to law,
justice or mercy. A member of the House OF
Representatives committed murder, and the |
Judge remembered that he was of the same par
ty and that the victim was only an Irshman-
a Senator was murderously assaulted in his
seat, and the laws were silent. No wonder |
that such examples told powerfully and down |
10 the lowest moral strata of society. II will |
always be SO when merely partisan interests
are long made paramount to all other considera-
tlOns. And we are glad to see that the Senate
manifested becoming prudence on this point
by striking out from the new police bill the
clause which gave the President power to call
out two hundred extra men on any emergency.
1t was said that such force might be used to
oyerawe elections. or for other improper pur-
poses. We trust, now that Congress has be-
gun the work of reform, it will prosecute it in
the same spirit, until Washington shall be, as
its great founder hoped it wOeld be, the worthy
capital OF this great republic."

The Express treated with great contempt,
| the other day, the complaints Of several pro-
minent and influential presses against Gov.


Weller for not suppressing mob violence, and
| declared, as well as we recollect, that, ac-
cording 10 claw and political science"" in
which it seemed to intimate that it was ANA.
zingly well posted, all that the Governor
could do in cases of infractions of the law by
mobs, was to wait until somebody resisted a
civil process, which process it was the duty
of subordinate officers to originate and en-
force. 1t now concludes that there is way
in which the Governor can act ab initio in
the premises, and says:


1--WE direct the attention of the newly con-
verted claw and order"" press, that are so dis
tressed Mt the alarming prevalence of mob
ocracy,"" and Gov. Weller's failure to enforce
the law, to the fact that that functionary has
issued proclamation. that may be more
touching to their nervous systems than the
late mob hangings were


/ Here follows the proclamation:


! WHEREAS have received satisfactory evil
dence that Il band of lawless individuals did,
on the 30th Of Nov. 1858, at Los Angeles
force the County Jail and take therefrom
prisoner, one Pancho Daniel, and execute him
without authority of law; and whereas, simi-
lar atrocous acts have been perpetrated in
Tuoumne, and some of the other counties of
this State,


Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority
in me vested, by the constitution and laws of
this State, | hereby offer reward of ONE
THOUSAND DOLLARS, for the arrest and
conviction of any, or either of the persons or
parties who have been engaged in these un-
lawful executions.


Of course this proclamation will simply
amount to nothing, because, in order to en-
force the law, it is necessary that public opin-
ion should sustain it. In the eye Of the law,
every man engaged in those hanging opera
tions is guilty of murder, but the people will
not so consider it, and would refuse to allow
one Of their number to be interfered with on
account of his connection with the transac
tions alluded to- Should the local judicial
tribunals issue warrants for the arrest of the
offending parties, and the ministerial officers
undertake to execute them, the people would
make resistance, and protect each other to the
bitter end. The officers would summon as
sistance from the body of the county, but il
would not be forthcoming for respectable
citizens do not like to shoot down their
equally respectable neighbors Then, the
Governor, being called upon, would order
out the volunteer or uniform companies or
other militia of the State"" but they would
probably refuse, to any considerable extent,
to respond to the call. If they did respond,
then there would be civil war Such is, we
think, well founded view of the case based
on the present state of public opinion in Cali
fornia. 1t is deplorable state of opinion We
will admit, and ought to be rectified. But,
such being the condition Unpopular feeling, it
is very doubtful whether Governor Weller
has the nerve, despite his boosted disregard
of popular clamor,"" to press to an extremity
the high-sounding declaration of his inaugu-
raj manifesto, to the effect that he would |
maintain the supremacy of the law at dill
hazards"" 1t is his sworn duty nevertheless
to do this very thing, irrespective of any de-
clarations that he may have made pro or con-


1t is certainly high time that lynch law
were done away with in this country, and
much do we fear that it will not cease for
many years, unless some terrible example is
made. But who viii take the responsibility
Of that example?"

CORONER'S INQUEST.",,"


The inquest upon the body Of the young man, Daniel
Stackpole, whose murder was reported in The TRIB-
usE of Friday, was held yesterday by Coroner Hills
at the Twelfth Ward Station-House, Harlem. 1t ap-
pears that political target company called the Fox
Musketeers, composed Of working Democrats OF the
Frst Ward went on Thanksgiving Day to the River
House. Harlem, to compete FOR prizes. The company
war under command of Capt. OMeara, the advance
guard or pioneers, being commanded by Capt David
Fox. There was also on the ground, a. spectator,
Daniel Stackpole, young man who commanded an
adverse Democratic organisation called the Brady
Guards Between the Guards and Muske;eers it seems
that there does lot exist the very best Of feeling As
usual on such occasions after dinner the musketeers
drank till they grew quanelsome, and several disturb
ances occurred among themselves. Ore Of their num-
Der, named Charles Moore said to have "" talked
I"" fght all the afternoon"" Coming into collision with
Stackpoe it appears that the latter struck him over
the he al with club. Subsequently, Moore took
small drtss sword from Lieut.. Welch, and pushed
Stackpole toward the River. Capt. Fox, armed with
heavy artillery broad sword started in the same
direction, and one A. D. Thompson, private, follow
ed them with his musket and bayonet.


The evidence is conflicting but the rrent testi
mopy goes to show that these three chasad Stack
polc hitber and hher for a considerable distance, and
that each Of them in turn, lunged at MIN with his
weapon There WAS only one wound visible on the
jody-a pupcture in the perineum, in the rear Of the
anus, about half an inch long aud six inches deep.
The weapon passed through the rectum and bladder,
and punctured the common lilac, causing death from
internal hemorhage. This wound, from its position,
slanting upward, evidently inflicted while
the poor fellow climbing a bank to
escape from his pursuers On receiving this
wound, he fell; hut rallyng again he ran into the
water, and then turned at bay, while his sssalants,
and the remainder Of the company who had by this
time been attracted to the spot by his cries. gathered
around. Making known his condition, they took him
away toward the Station House. Although he could
speak and was quite rational up to the time OF his
DEATH he does not appear to have charged the crime
upon ary in particular, if we except remark in
directly duplicating Moore. He died in about fifteen
minutes before reaching the Station-Iiouse.


Fox, Moore and Thompson were all arrested the
SAME night. From the nature of the wound it might
have been inflicted with bayonet, or with the sword
which Moore took from Welch. 1t was altogether too
small for the broadsword that Fox is stated to have
carried. While the inquest was progressing MR.
Stackpoe come in bewailing in the most pteous man
ner the fate of her son. Soon after the corpse was
borne away, followed by the sorrow-stricken parent
and sisters of the deceased. Sackpole lived at No.
i67 Fourth street. lie is said to have been duttul
son, and young man of quiet disposition and tenn
pernie habits. A widowed mother and five helpless
sisters remain to mourn his loss.

He said, that as the Republicans Of this

must have been done for some consideration,
to be hereafter returned. That he believed
the bargain to be, that if Mr. Ball was elect
ed, that his vote should be cast for Black

ously for the true Democracy. From every
part Of the county we have the most cheer
ing intelligence Of the approval of the ticket
and the rallying of the people to its support.
For the past two weeks, James Anderson,
our popular Senatorial nominee, and Mes
srs. Stratton Barclay, and Lynch, for the
Assembly, have addressed enthusiastic meet
ings of the Democracy in the lower portion
of the county. They bring us cheering news
of the feeling among the people. Broderck-
Republicanism is utterly repudated in near
y every precinct they have visited, and the
American party appears to have but little
life left in it. The National Democratic tick
ct, and the patriotic administration of Mr..
Buchanan meets full and free Endorsement.
The defunct Kansas question fails to gull in
telligent men who are working for the in
terest of the county and State. They also
see through the Republican and Broderick
fusion, and keep their hands clear of the con-
tamlnatOn.


From the divide"" the citadel of Democ-
racy of Placer county, the glad tidings come
that ""all is well"" The Democratic sentiuels
are faithful at their posts, the artlleryman
stands by their guns, and each soldier is
ready for the battle. We expect to count
our majority by the hundreds in that quarter.
Every man is awake to the Importance of
electing ticket Of good men, and they see
in the nominees of the National Democracy
tried and true men, old and valued citi-
zens, and they intend to elect them.


The hour is auspcous! it is one of victory,
it can be seen in every Democratic eye, and
felt in every pulsation of the great Demo
cratic heart. The lst of September will be
a glad day for National Democrats, and it
behooves every soldier in the cause to be
watchful and active, and not to cease the
fight, until the bugle note Of victory declares
the battle ended"

The private conversation with Mr.. Brod

Hunt went to the Union Hotel to propose to

one of the District Judges, and bv accident
got into Mr.. Broderick's room, when that
gentleman, learning his business, told him
his mission would amount to nothing. as
Thornton was an Administration man, and
he (Broderick) would not recognize, politi-

we think will show the difficulty IN its
right light:


There is not much Territorial news
in your papers. The Eastern papers con-
tain FIVE times more news from Kansas
than papers printed in the Territory
Whit about those numerous affrays and
depredations that are almost daily COM
mitred? see nothing of them in your
papers, comparatively. Our Eastern pa
pers are teeming with news of that kind;
they seem to know more of Kansas af-
fairs than you who live there. We have
accounts of large parties that have organ
lied themselves and invaded Missouri, and
that the. Missourians have armed them
selves fully for the expected attack OF the
Free State marauders, led on by the noto-
rious jim LANE Let Us know more of
this matter""


The above is taken from letter dated
in New York, June 9th, 1858. and is q
fair sample of many that We have seen
and heard Of. Now we explain all this
by calling the attention ofthe people to the
swarm of Eastern news. makers which
travel through cur country, hired espe-
cally for the purpose of flooding the
E ,stern States with startling news from
this point, which is the theatre of so
much political interest and importance.


The time was when the news received
in the East from his place was not made
up of exaggerations and fancies, when
perhaps the whole Of the fearful realities
tharthen existed were not exhibited, but
at that time the letter writers were per-
sons who hail come here to All almost
unknown country to settle, and whose
interest was 10 make their statements as
carefully as possible, so as to quiet the
fears of those near and dear left behind,
and to induce as far as possible hasty
immigration into the country, knowing
that that was the most sure mode OF set
ding our difficulties.


Now the matter is entirely changed,
our country has become more popuious,
and political affairs comparatively quiet,
and under the control of majority
Our Territory is now full of Eastern cor
respondents under high salaries, who come
out here without the slightest knowledge
Of our country, politically or socially. and
circulate through the Territory, feeling
c, m ,elled by the position they occupy to
wit, in such way that their letters will
attract attention. Having no real founda-
ton on which to build their romantic
castles, they pick up every little social and
personal rencounter or quarrel, and mag
nify it an hundred fold, giving /: the
color of their own political bias and COM
plexion, then forward by express to their
employers. These are nine tenths OF the
--latest from Kansas"" Especial Cores

Now for enc of orr papers to publish
that style of literature, would at once
brand il in its own community as lying
sheet, unworthy the confidence and patron
age of the people. Such paper could

ON EscAPADE.-The Alta gives the following
account, derived from official sources, of the
late State Prison escapade:


At 2 o'clock on the afternoon Of 23d March,
and shortly after the departure of the Gov
ernor from the prison, sixteen convicts headed
by the somewhat notorious Lynch (bettcr
known by the name of Pumpkins') and Or
linski, made break from the upper grounds,
outside the walls, for sail boat called the Nip
Cat, which was anchored some three hundred
yards from the shore Unfortunately for them
she was aground and it was low tide. lmme-
dately the alarm was given, the bell rung,
and the balance called in. The guards came
down the hill, running through the water and
mud waist deep. They soon got within range
and opened pretty brisk fire. One man was
shot, and they, finding the boat aground, and
at the same moment seeing the twelve-pounder
come over the hill thought best to cry quarter,
which they did most Justify. One by one they
came struggling in, and forlorn looking set
they were-covered with mud and dripping
with water-no hats or shoes on. They were
compelled to lay down on the beach and wait
for the balance. As soon as they had all ar
rived they were marched down to the black
smith shop and securely double ironed The
boat Nip Cat, somewhat renowned in prison
escapes, was beached on the following morning
and entirely dsmantled-so her career is end
ed for the present."

Ldc.-A friend who has recently Travelled through
portion Of the State of Arkansas, and especially
through Red River Bottom where the following incl.
dent occurred related it to in our editorial sane
tuIn as follows: man by the name of Rogers stole
horse from an honest old farmer of Arkansas, and
Wended his way up into Washington county where
he SAID he sold 1t to farmer there. But upon his
rot being able to give the oil the man nor make
satisfactory explanation, company who had been
IN pursuit Of the horse and thief took him into the
woods and tied him to log and gave him between
two hundred and three hundred lashes well laid on
This had the effect Of bringing him to terms He
then confessed where the horse was, and who were
his accessories The company then proceeded to Red
River Bottom, where they found the missing horse
ana hYe fellows, whose business it was to steal all
the horses, and whatever else would paw that they
could, whom they hung to limbs of trees until they
were dead, dead, dead Upon consideration Of Rogers
having turned, he was spared. As our informant
rOCe past the spot where the edct of lynch law had
gone forth, and the horrible spectacle ofts execution
was witnessed, one poor fellow was seen dangling
between heaven and earth suspended by his neck to
the limb OF tree, whose branches extended across
the road with this inscription written upon his back


Tennessee horse thief, if you like him better than
do, You can take him down and bury him. We will
simply state that our Informant is highly respect
able gentleman, and this narrative NAV be relied
upon as true. memphis Eagle.


This man Rogers is, we believe the same for whose
msdeeds one Thos. j. Rodden was severely handled
by the lynchers, through mistake."

Quite an exciting affair occurred at DOnphan on

we learn the particulars. 1t will be remembered that
few weeks since Free-State man named Walter
Latham shot down in the streets of that city by

The circulation of the notes OF this wlld
cat concern, appears to have been wide
laid scheme to fleece the public. The prin-
cipal in the fraud is man by the name of
Hamer who first opened an OSsensible
Brokers Office near the depot in 1ndianapo-
lis. The bills are new and beautifully got
up. Before their appearance in public, the
notes were quoted in Paddock's Bank Note
Mirror-probably by Encouragement with
the publisher--in some copies OF the papers,
at IL per cent. discount; in others the quo
tation was left blank. The circulators of
the notes started in different directions
through the central and northern portions
of the State, and began by buying all sorts
of property which they could get in ex-
change for the bills.


Wherever there were doubts of the cur
rency, they were removed by reference to
the Bank Note Mirror Considerable sums
were got into circulation in various places I;
but before the first issues had time to reach
indianapolis, Hamer's brokers' Office exhibit
ed small sign at the window, with the
words bank closed which remains a
fxture-and Mr.. Hamcr has disappeared.
Two men appeared at Charlottesville one day
last week, and went into very active busi-
ness in purchasing, at retail, giving the ex-
change money in payment Their move
ments excited suspicion, and they were ar
rested, and $500 of the money found in their

prevailing Judge Lynch will handle him rather

be married to young lady OF respectabIllty, and
the wedding was to have taken place on Thursday

arranging his affairs for that event, intending to re-
turn from Chicago on Wednesday night. TAYLOR
was much respected here by all who knew him, and
bis uDtimey death has caused a shudder through
the town. The excitement is rendered more IN
tense by the fact that this is the second murder IN
our city within month. One Fisher IS now IN

two weeks since. Justice lockwood, acting Cor

of yesterday, contains the following informa
tion respecting the above named interesting
section of country:


Mr. Henry Miller, formerly from Alpha, ar
rived in town yesterday morning from
Washoe Valley with four horse team He
made the trip in six days, leaving home on
Saturday morning last. The route of Mr..
Miller was through the Yuba gap and via
the ridge between the North and Middle
Yubas. Snow lay on the road for fifty miles,
averaging two feet deep. A part of the way
the snow is six feet deep.


Mr. Miller came to Nevada in preference
to Placerville, for his winters stock of gro
ceries. He assures us the road is quite as
good and shorter, as he has found by trying
both routes. According to his calculation,
which is on well established data, Nevada is
not less than 40 miles nearer the sink of the
Humboldt, where the Carson route and
Truckee unite, than Placerville. We are
then that distance nearer Salt Lake by the
line of travel than Placerville.


Washoe Valley is settling up quite fast,
containing twelve families and forty men at
the present time. Frankville, the place of
trade, is twenty miles off the road from this
place to the sink but is not more than 100
miles from here by the crcuitous route taken
by Mr.. Miller.


Lynch is the only Judge known in Washoe
All sorts of grain and vegetables flourish.
Two grist mills are in Carson Valley, 25
miles distant. A new town called Carson
City, is building in Eagle Valley, between
Carson and Washoe. A good hotel and
store are going up.


The overland stage might haverun through
Washoe but for the want of public spirit on
the part of some of the citizens who refused
to comply with request of the stage own
ers to fix a few miles of road.


Washoe is a beautiful valley, twelve miles
in length by about six wide. A lake six
miles long lies along its western border
Game is abundant, such as mountain sheep,
antelope, deer, grouse, DC, dc.


Mr.. Miller returns in about ten days with
load, by the same route he came. From
a thorough knowledge of the mountains, he
thinks himself safe in saying the road to this
place may be shortened twenty miles by a
small outlay on the hill beyond Bear Valley."

1t says:


In response to the demand of the Washing.

men should speak out"" upon the contest be-
tween Douglas and Lincoln in Illinois, a LARGE
majority have expressed themselves decided
ly and unequivocally in favor of Douglas. =
Among the journals and statesmen who have
so spoken may be named the New Orleans
Courier. Delta, True Delta Crescent, Picay-
une, Bulletin, Bee MitchelPs Citizen. Savan
nah Republican, Augusta Constitutionalist,
and osher leading Georgia papers; the Rich
mond Inquirer, Southside Democrat, Lynch

and Hammond, of South Carolina Soule and
Breckinridge, of Louisiana Brown. of Mis-
sissippi; Green, of Missouri, and others, dc
not hesitate to ayow their sympathies for hin
and their cordial wishes for his triumph.


The New Orleans Bulletin speaks upon the
matter in this language;


There is no doubling what we say, that the
Democratic pulse South is beating strongly
for Douglas. Every Democratic paper in thi.
city, nearly all in the State, and we think by
far the more numerous part of them in Other
Southern States, do not hesitate to declare
their sentiments to this effect openly and EN-
phatically. His cause in the South in tn,
party, there can scarcely be a doubt, is daily
growing stronger


Upon the same point, the Mobile, Alabama
Daily Advertiser remarks:


Several of the interior papers of this STATE
are decidedly in favor of the election of Doug
las over Lincoln. The Tribune and Adver
tiser, and perhaps the Mercury-we do moi
remember that the latter has taken position
on the question-ofthis city, occupy the same
position, and we are quite sure that the ma
jority of the people of the State either de-
nounce or deplore the Presidents position o
active hostility to Douglas"

assembled at the Cathedral in Baltimore on
Sunday morning. The ceremonies attending
the opening of the session were of very SOL
emn and impressive character. The prelates
assembled as usual at the residence of the
archbishop, and at 10 o'clock a line of pro-
cession was formed, the bishops and attend
ant clergy all clad in their robes. The eight
bishops in attendance were each accompan-
led by one or more thsologians, who, together
with the clergy of the city to the number of
about forty, with the members Of the Loyola
and St. Alphonsus societies, and the superiors
of .ha orders Of Jesuits, Lazorists, Redemp-
torists, Dominicans, and Franciscans, combined
to form most imposing and attractive spec
tacle, which was witnessed by an immense
concourse of spectators. The members of the
Young Catholic Friends Society were also in
attendance in large numbers, each wearing a
white ribbon in the lapel Of their coats, and
acting as an escort to the procession. They
passed around to the front entrance Of the
Cathedral, and passed up the main isle to
the altar chanting the usual services of the
church for such occasions.


The following were the bishops in attend
ance:


Most Rev. Archbishop Kenrick, of Baltimore.
Rt. Rev. DR.. O'Connor, Bishop Of Pittsburg.
Rt. Rev. DIR. McGill, Bishop of Richmond,
1t. Rev. DIR. Neuman, Bishop of Philadelphia
Rt. Rev, DR.. Young, Bishop Of Erie, Pa.
Rt. Rev. Dr. Barry, Bishop of Savannah.
Rt. Rev. DIR. Lynch, Bishop of Charleston.
Rt. Rev. DIR. Verot, Bishop of Florida.


The Rt. Rev. Bishop Whelan, of Wheel
ing being in Europe, was absent. The Mi
tree, Abbo: Weummer, of the Benedetine
Convent of Latrobo, Pennsylvania, occupied
a seat with the bishops.


A number of the reverend clergy was pres
ent as theologians to the bishops and as Off
riors of the several Catholic orders.


On reaching the sanctuary the services com
menced with a solemn pontifcal mass, the
Most Rev. Archbishop being the ceebrant,
with the Very Rev. Ii. b. Coskery, as assist
ant priest.


The opening sermon was delivered by
Bishop McGill, of Richmond, on the authori-
ty of the church, taking his text from the
18th verse of the lSth chapter OF the gospel
of st. Matthew, viz: ""And if he neglected to
hear them, tell it unto the church; but if he
neglected to hear the church. let him be unto
thee as an heather man and a dublican.'-
The sermon was able and argumentatve, and
was listened TO with deep interest both by
the Clergy and the large concourse of persons
present, filling the vast edifee to its utmost
capacity, even the isles being thronged from
door to the altar


After the sermon the council was organ
ized by the profession of the faith on the part
of the bishops and the reading of a portion
of the DEGREES Of the Council of Trent, with
the ceremonies and forms usual to tho occa.
sou.-Baitinlore American."

benefit would result from such an arrangement. The
mere transportation OF stock from point to another
wastes time which is precious to the farmer IN the
months when exhibitions are generally given, and the
cattle becoming tired and exhausted do not show TO
the best advantage. Some such suggestion as TINS,

The attendance to-day was much improved, and the
spacious galleries Of the amphtheater were occupied
by large majority of ladies who seemed to appreciate
the blooded stock with the experienced eyes of keen
sportsmen. BY the way, the fair sex Of Kentucky
are superb riders, and manage their horses with all
the grace Of professional equestrans, though have
not vet aspired to the dtgany of Horse Show after
your Long Island fashion, Mounted on their high
mettad steeds it is unusual thing to them speed
ing away their solitary rides, as Fanny kemble was
wont to astOnsh the staid citizens Of Philadelphia
ycars ago when she witched the world with her noble
horsemanship Since then it has become uncom-
mon sight and the legendary respect of old Ireland to
women seems 70 be ernated in country for, despite
The national prOclylty to rOwdylsm who ever heard
Of a woman ON horseback being nsulted In this
part Of the country any such experiment would call
down upon the body of the audacous perpetrat0r the
full rigOrs of Judge Lynchs code. This taste for
equine exercise leads the ladies' to patronize the
horse days at our fairs to much greater extent
than any others; indeed the displays OF fruit and flow
ers generally attractive at the Eastward and near
large cities have no charms in Kentucky comparable
with the blood horses, in the eyes OF womanhood'
Some of the railroad trains, which run every fifteen
minutes took out TO the grounds over 1000 at time,
every party carrying its basket stored with provisions

during the recess, which, by the way, gives the
whole grounds the appearance OF huge gypsy en-
campment.

stations trained to harness. The entries were numer-
ous and the rings well contested. Il. l.. Dorsey OF
jefferson County took the first premium, and John
Burke Of the same county the second. The successu

and Mrs Mason of our city the second. The ring for

j. Galloway of Henry and +. ID. Hobbs tor the first
and second premiums. Orville West of Scott County
and j. w French OF Shelby took the first and second
premiums for aged harness mares, of which there
were numerous entries For three-year mares j. a.
SHREDDER and L. L. Dorsey both of jefferson, bore off
the respective premiums. The two-year mare ring

On Tuesday, March 25th, sixteen Convicts,
headed by the notorious Orlinski, made an un-
successful attempt to escape from the State
Prison. They were at work in front of the
prison, and made some excuse to go down to
the water side where small boat was lying.
some three hundred yards from the shore. On
arriving at the beach, they waded out to the
boat, which fortunately was aground, the tide
being cut. The alarm was instantly given by
. convict who was acting as overseer, and a
portion of The guard, armed with rifles and pis-
tolls started in pursuit, while another portion
ran for the cannon, which was not far off, A
number Of shots were fired with small arms, one
Of which took effect in the hand of Francisco
Salio, convict. Before the prisoners were
able to get the boat of. the cannon was got
round aud pointed towards them, on seeing
which, they threw up their hands and surren-
dered. At the time of the outbreak, Tom
Lynch, convict. was heavily ironed, but he
had concealed hammer and chisel on the
beach, with which he succeeded in relieving
himself Of his irons. Lynch is represented as .
desperate fellow and this is his third attempt to
escape, which accounts for his being kept in
irons. The attempt was headed by Orlinsk
aud Lynch, aud probably would have beeR sue
cessful had the boat not been aground."

Correspondence Of the Independent.",,"INDEPENDENT


CAMPO SECO, June 21st, 1853.


Mr.. Editor:-As you extorted pro-
mise from me to write communicates
Tor the Independent, | have taken-not
my ""grey goose quill'-but my steel
pen, from its rack, to scribble a few lines
But subject-what shall it be? Campo
oeco and vicinity is as dry as the contri-
button box at Sacramento; and to search
Tor an interesting subject here, would
prove an abortiye attempt. l would as
soon undertake to seek for needle in a
hay stack, or look for an honest politician
IN Californian animal not to be found


The political wire-workers have CON-
menced electioneering in good season for
theirrespective favorites-all for the good
OF the people AS many as six candi-
dates will be before the Convention from
this place and vicinity, for the Assembly
This speaks well for the patriotism of our
citizens. 1t is gratifying to see with
what alacrity they respond to the call,
when their country demands their servi-
ces. They all think they have the adead
thing for the nomination; but there is
many slip 'twixt the cup and the lip, J""
and many of them will take a trip up
Salt (Frazer) river, and unless good
man receives the nomination, they will
all be landed, high, not dry, up the Sa-
line creek, where the tide from the polit-
ical sea will never reach them.


The Frazer river fever is still raging
with unabated fury. If all go who talk
OF making the trip, this portion of the
County will be depopulated l would
advise all who think of going to reflect
for moment upon the step they are
about to take. There has been no relia-
BILE information received from the new
FL Dorado. Men have gone who will
prospect the country thoroughly, and by
waiting few weeks, news will be recei-
we'd upon which we can depend.


The Sunday law is most relgiously
obeyed in this place-all the business
houses being closed There are many
who are opposed to the law, and declaim
eloquently against the injustice of having
hoI III fol- IL,
waiting with much interest for the deci-
sion of the Supreme Court upon the
law. [ would like few lines of your
valuable paper for the purpose of warn
ing the young men of this place, who
are on the marry"" to beware of out
siders


| have noticed quite number of gen.
tlemen from San Andreas, with nicely
fitting apparel, extensive side-boards and
greasy har,"" bowling and scraping to
the ladies of Campo Seco, like Captain
Cropp to his Excellency, Charles IL
Among the number [ saw good-looking
man who was once engaged in the ""bread
business"" {"" at Stockton. He is emphati-
cally a ladies' man, and drinks lager; but
in this, as in all things else in this sublu-
nary world, ""many will be called and
few chosen""


On Sunday, the Goth, three Cinnamon
broke into the cabin of Mr. Geo. Spen-
Ger. His neighbors saw the Cinnamon
enter and ran to the cabin and arrested

19_1858-12-11_p2_sn90059500_0038334718A_1858121101_0444,Saint Paul weekly Minnesotian.,01,1858-12-11,p2,"CWhO IL NIinnesOtn,s Traducer ?,,",,"
Times of Sunday. In the previous Fridays
issue of that journal the public were given to
understand that the two-legged object upon
which their ""public indignation"" should be
poured for writing that letter to the N. Y. Iri-
'une about our railroads, was some certain ''po-
lticaL aspirant"" whom the editor doubtless
then had in his minds eye-some auda-
cious Republican probably who believeth not
in SIBLEY and escheweth spiritualism (both
kinds) and moccasins fright and Left, and
therefore was a proper subject to be ""put
down""-emphatically down""


But, on Sunday, behold we had another
version. The Times therein re-announced in
effect that the "" traduccr is not the ""politi-
cal aspirant,"" but that it has re-discovered the
villain in travelling ""editor from some OBJ
scure village in Central New York."" who hath
""his quarters at Minneapolis"" and which
aforesaid individual is more than insinuated
should be punished"" by being inconti-
mentally lynched for knowingly and wilfully
(and we presume with ""malice prepense"" also)
rob6ing us of our good name, and sta6bing our
financial integrity at the Threshold of the
great money market of the world"" Thus
runneth the indictment, and many would con-
cede that in well-made out case of ""rob-
berry"" and ""stabbing"" the punishment sug-
gested might not be too severe; but the editor
himself with characteristic courage, oozing
while he writeth like certain Bob Acres
from his fingers ends, towards the conclusion
of his article draweth it rather milder and
windeth up with this heartfelt, adjectvcous
and most fearful groan: at is hard, indeed,
for this yOung State to bear such base and IN
mitigated wrongs; but, we suppose, there is
no remedy but to live down such rillainous
ISLANDERS"" A most sage and philosophical
conclusion ""A physically safe one too =
And touching the philosophy of the conclrl-
sion, it may be remarked that no axiom is bet
ter established as regards communities, than
that error need never be feared while truth is
left free to combat it. Nor do we think the





ern papers which may misrepresent our fin
ancial condition, can be productive of more
than evanescent effect; though to be sure we
admit the truth is more dangerous than false
hood, in certain cases.


But to come back to the point: ""Who is Min
ncsota's Traducer?""-the Times peremptorily
demands of the New York Tribune and Post
to give to the public the name of their CORES
pondent"" And it followeth up it's ferocious
requisition upon those diurnals by the terrible
threat: eff they refuse this demand, zoe shall
give it ourselves, and leave him to the merited
contempt of an outraged and indignant COM
munity-a slanderer and traducer of honest
and upright men meaning, we suppose, the
railroad officials ""a fit creature for scorn
to point her slow, unerring finger at"" Now
we would remark to the Times writer, that
to many it seems to be mock delicacy not to
trot out the name of the delinquent at once your
self, if you know him so positively. Why wait
for two or three weeks to advise the Post and
Tribune of the dreadful demand? Ifyou are
not mistaken in the man this second time of
announcement, as you were on the first oc-
casion, forthwith "" turn him loase on the dee
strict"" as FOLEY of Indiana would say, and
let us all have shy at him. Come-let us
have the Development prepare to puck
err"" Get the fingers of scorn ready-but for
goodness sake don't by mistake point towards
any of the Railroad officials, or their paid ad-
vocates"

PARTMENT or GEoRGETowN COLLEGE, took
place last night in the lecture room of the
Smithsonian Institution On the stage was
seated the President of the College, Rev. B. A.
Mcguire Rev. Mr.. Clarke, Professor Of Chem
iStry /; Rev. Mr.. Currey, the Astronomer of the
Institution !; Rev. Mr.. Lynch, V. p. Of Wash
ington Seminary; Prof. Henry, Drs. Boliref,
Jones, Burrows, of the Medical Department
of the College Drs. Young. Leiberman, Eliot.
Morgan, Snyder, Craig and Schaeffer.


The law Of Congress giving the Georgetown
College power to confer degrees upon students.
was read by DR.. Eliot.


DR.. B. A. Morgan then addressed the stu
dents upon the responsibility of their profession
and the necessity of deep and serious study rs
stepping stone TO their future eminence in
the practice of their calling,


President Mcguire then conferred the degree
Of Doctor Of Medicine upon the following gen.
tlemen of the graduating class; Thos. s.
Robinson d. c.; j. +. Morgan, Nd; s. f.
Spalding, Md; r. w. Meade N. Y; Beni.
Hodges, Nd; l.. b. Dunn, Ark; r. B. Detric,
Pa; and F. ByingtOn, Va.


DIR. Schoeffer next addressed the class upon
the necessity of their investigating thoroughly
every branch Of their profession. The neces-
Sity of early study in order to attain the high
eminencc which lay before them as a future re-
ward of diligence was also dwelt upon.
| A painful hoarseness with which the spea-
keT was afflicted prevented any extended re-
marks, and precluded large portion of the an-
dience from hearing; but the address was an
able and scientific production.


During the evening the performance ofsome
excellent music by Webbers cornet band ad-
ded TO the interest of the occasion.


The Georgetown College was founded In the
year 1856, and its first principal was Rev.
John Carrol, afterwards the first Archbishop
Of Baltimore. In 1915 Congress raised it to
the rank of q University. The Medical de-
partment was opened in May, 1851, in Wash
ington city, and from small beginning has
become one of the most floarishing and well
arranged institution in the country. The Col
| lege now numbers 311 students, and the medi-
cal department from 35 TO 40 members, many
Of them eminent i'm their profession.


The presence last night Of an audience 90
large and intelligent sufficiently demonstrates
| the estimation which this foErrishing institu-
ton has attained in the public mind. , -

Tie United States chartered ste Atlanta cams

unfingpgly the combined effects Of rough weather,
South American pamperos, and the action of heavy
metal, has been capitally executed that we, who
hold that all the chartered vessels are n every par
ticular incompetent to perform the duties assigned
them, must acknowledge the Atlanta will prove an sc-
quishon to the invading squadron. The Atlanta was
butt in Philadelphia in 1853, is 49j tuns burden, with
direct acting engine of 25O horse power, which en-
gine has been on'ya year in use.


The United States steam fngate San Jacfto now

must cost large amount OF money TO put her INTO

We congratulate the House Of Rcrre-
scntativcs upon having voted bv So large
a majority for the unconditional repeal of
one Of the mcanest, most picayuni-h, and
most thoroughly contemplate laws that
ever disgraced a book OF statutes.


We regret to find among the nays the
names Of some Of our best friends: but
weare satisfied they voted against the bill
under q mistake respecting its true mcr-
its. and the grounds upon which it can D.,
defended. Some of them, we know. based
their vote upon the ground that a lazy
compelling parties to make publication
in the newspapers, should also prescribe
such regulations as will secure the adyer-
tiser against imposition by the printer
We are not prepared to dispute the cor
rcctncss of this reasoning in the abstract :
but we donot deem it applicable to the
case. The prices of advertising in every
respectable newspaper are notorious, and
there could be no such danger of any pub
fishers CHARGING for legal advertisements
more than his usual rates. as to render il
necessary that the Legislature should
guard against such am occurrence bv spe-
clal enactment. Legal advertisements are
made in the papers, not for the benefit of
the papers themselves. but for the pro-
lection of the parties interested i'm estates.
and parties to suits. The giving of pub
lic notice Of certain legal proceedings.
through public newspaper, is nothing
more than a compliance with the theory
OF our methods Of Judicial procedure. 1t
Is as necessary as a conformity to the rules
| OF evidence in the tIial Of causes. the
modeot impanneling iurics, the -uhra.-
nains of witnesses. or any other safe
guard provided for the protection of the
rights Of parties who enter the courts
The argument therefore. which some have
advanced. that it should be left to the dis
cretion Of parties to omit giving the re-
quircd notice through public newspaper.
provided they cannot get it done for Ger
tain price. Is not q sound one. They should
bercquircd to give these notices. and the
law which makes it imperative on them
! to do So. is as wen founded in reason n,
any other which regulates the admini.tra-
ton Of justice, and.providcs for securing
the rights of litiraut-. or Of those interest
cd in estates which have &, bc settled iu
the Probate Courts II the legislature
deemed il absolutely necessary that the
prices TO be paid publishers for inserting
these notices, should be regulated bv law.
and could show a good reason therefor.
the printers would, perhaps. have no c--
pccial cause Of complaint. provided the
price was fixed alta living rate of compen-
sation. But as we have cQntended. any
regulation Of price is -upcroratory. -ae-
| ing that printers rates for advertising are
| fixed and notorious. and that there IS no
danger that any of them VIII go beyond
those rates in charging for legal alvorti-e-
mcnts. If they did, they could not col
lect their bills.


With those gentlemen who. while yo-
ting against the bill for the reason we hav,
mentioned, were at the same time ready
to allow publishers their regular charge.
we have no quarrel We have no doubt
they acted from honest and con-cientiou-
motious, and their willingness to allow u.
a fair price for our labor, shows that they
are not destitute of q proper sense of fair
ness and liberality. But for those. if anv
such there were, who oppo-cdthcbillf from
a simplede-ire to tokecpthcratcs at the sam,
a. those provided in the Revised Code
and so require publisher, to work at star
vation prices, We have precious little chari
ty. We are satisfied that there is mo-.
among them a man who possesses at tn,
same time intelligence, lberality of views
and a proper sense Of justice."

THE TRAGEDY AT GRASS VALLEY.

Seven Men Killed and Wounded-Arrest of
the Murderers-ComIuittal to Jail-Talk
NEUTRALITY-SUSPICIOUS. Etc.",,"| lives of three men and wounding of 9TH
ers took place on Osborn Hill, two miles
from Grass Valley, between 8 and a
o'clock P. NJ. on Thursday, July 1st.-
The parties engaged in the bloody af
fair were DR.. McMurtry, his brother,
James H McMurtry and Richard Kim
ball, on one side, and Alex. Griffin, Hol-
land, Shea, Casey, McCabe, and from
twelve to twenty others on the other
side The facts -rffcited before the Cor
oner's jury from Dr. McMurtry who was
the sole witness sworn, are substantially
as follows =


Difficulties had arisen concerning a
quartz lead on Osborn Hill on which
shaft had been sunk by McMurtry's par
ty. An Irish company jumped the
claims. Both parties, were on the claims
on the evening of the difficulty, to settle
all differences amicably. After some
talk it was agreed to meet next morning
at the same plaae, no one to be present
but those interested, and proceed with
the settlement The Irish party with
drew leaving the three composing the
other party near the shaft. When alb
sent few moments, Alex Griffin, of the
former party rode back to the shaft and
said they must come to a settlement i'm
mediately, and if not his party would re-
turn. He received for reply that there
was then nothing to settle. The Irish
party were seventy five yards or SO down
the hill, and came back stationing them
selves behind Trees and logs, and pre-
sented guns. They were armed with
shot guns and rifles and numbered from
seventeen to twenty-five men. Griffin
rode to one side. Holland, one of the
jumping party, remarked if some one
would hold his gun he would fill up the
shaft and soon proceeded 10 the work.
Seeing the disposition of the strong par
ty DIR McMurtry took his brother by
the arm and said ""let us get out of this""
He said he Sc W but little show for three
men to resist so many and wished to get
away safely.


He saw a shot gun standing against
stump, which did not belong to his party,
and was impelled to pick it up-think-
ing there might be fight, but fearing
the others might take it as hostile de,
monstration he let it alone, and started
to go up The hill. In going up the three
got separated few yards apart; when a
fire arm was discharged from the large
: party, and Immediately followed by a
volley. The Dr. looked back and saw
his brother with shot gun, crouching as
if to get a shot in return. He then drew
: his own revolver and joined in the melee
When the fight was over he found Kim
| ha ii 11-,,o, ,,,ona1o 1ol tlo o.,o,,,,l
Jas II. McMurtry sitting with his head
bent over and dead. The ball appeared
to enter little below the arm-pit of the
left arm, passing directly through the
chest in slightly downward direction.
Kimball was struck with buckshot
below the eye, in the neck and along
down one arm; was badly wounded but
will recover.


The DR.. escaped untouched, though
several shots were directly aimed at
f him. Kimball had no arms on him at
the time. James Fl. McMurtry had only
Gerringer which he did not use. The
arms of the DR.. consisted of small five
shooting Colt, which he used with good
effect, hitting a man at each discharge
All the shots from his side were made by
him. Altogether seven men were killed
; and wounded. One from each party
died on the ground and two Irishmen
are reported to have since died.


The affair naturally created great ex-
citement at Grass Valley, and some talk
of flynching Griffin, the supposed ring
leader of the assaulting party.

was indicated on the map by parallel of

the same parallel marked Suffers north

northern line Of the Flugge grant is near
Dogtown, far up in the mountains. After
the removal of the Flugge grant by Larkin,

some of the city papers ventured to say some
very mean things of him. We had no sympathy
with Mr.. Nugent in bis law and order troubles,
but we admired his courage in dific ulty through
which he demeaned himself manfully. As usual,
the Bulletin was most abusive after Nugent had
gone. There are some of the meanest scratch
es in the San Francisco daily press to be found
anywhere in the world-Oregon not excepted I;
and among the most surly and vituperative of all
is the Bulletin it never has good word for any

essentially differ from the antique muster, except
in the fact that the old training was accomplished
in one day, while this occupies generally two days
and one night. The dangers which thess

usually foretsste extemporized upon the tented

next to beholding his merry men accurately be-
frogged and ornamented, the Massachusetts militia
officer reoices in the detection of delinquent-of
some hoary scoundrel minus most important aud
indispensable button--Of some hardened sinner short
of cartridges-of some gross maeiactOr whose fire.
lock is q little rusty or wholly deficient as to trs
ger.


In days gone by, before the cmelioration of the
criminal code these delinquencies were rewarded
with instant death upon the field; but now, as
We have said above, the offender is subjected
to the slow roasting OF COurt-Martial, which,
as il can do nothing with the prisoner, after
finding him guilty, but kick him out of service
which he is rejoiced to leave always consoles ITSELF
while il has him in possession, by the harassing
elongstion of its Investigations, and by making nn
awful show of Rhadamsnhne nhexlbillty. The
surest WAY would undoubtedly be for the Colonel
commanding to shoot to-day and call for the Court
tomorrow, in which case he might be hung for
murder but would not less be martyr 10 his
chiyarous notions of military discipline. The main
trouble of this course of proceeding would be,
that an officer 50 bold and prompt would instantly
be lynched by his own gallant private followers
who have in more than instance threatened
death to their leader upon much slighter provoca-
tion.


For reverence for supcrors is not, we are
sorry to say, a militia characteristic. We have
even known oaly foot soldier, unawed by all the
pomp and circumstanceOf of glorious war, while drums
were beating and ffes were sqieakiDg and banners
were Haunting, actually 70 dun his revered Major
for the price of pair of boots, being nstigated to
that horrid crime partly by new rum and partly by
sense Of pecunary injuries. Summary proceed
ings by what is called a drum-head Court Martial,
would not therefore be always safe, nasmuch as the
prisoner might smash the head OF the drum, and
afterward smash the head of the Judge Advocate.


1t is safer TO put off the investigation until the regi
ment has been dismissed, and under home inhu-
ences has subsided intoa less rlotOus and bacchana
lisn frame Of mind. No Massachusetts, MsjOr-Gen-
ersl however fond he might be of the sport, would
relish being eaten Acteon-ike, by his own hounds,
however heartily his hounds might relish him. II
is better, in managing his democratic tail, to be
very blind to its faults and very kind TO It's virtues
and not to expect, simply because he will expect it
in vain, that submission and obedience which is the
regular thing in the regular army. The sOdiersare
the people, and the people will think twice be-
fore they egislate ball and chain upon their august
sbns or doom Themselves, for the sake OF military
discipline To many stripes, to powder and shot, or
10 the ignominious hemp of the Provost t-Msrshal.


Now, il is perfectly safe To do as company has
Just done neal Boston-the said company being NOR
tally wounded in its feelings by the selection Of par
tcular muster field. and finding no relief except in
carrying lis frelochs in the very presence OF its
epauletted chief in position for which no pre-.
cedent can be found in Scotts Tactics. Something
dreadful is 10 BE- done TO this rebellious corps. Ii
is, we believe, to be disbanded. What thenl 1t
will bear its sorrows stoically, for it can console
itself by organizing as sort OF 'reeand-easy bat
TALON, and as such can parade under the windows
Of lis old martinez commander, with large supply
of brass band and private banners, with arms in
those positions which convenience or Indignation
may dictate, and with hows heavy enough to make
night hideous. What will the rigid disciplinarian
do thenl


Notwithstanding the defections and abbreviated
comings of the Ma.sachusett. Militia, TO which it
has been our excruciaIingy painful duty to alude,
We are happy TO announce that there ls a surplus
of militia learning and experience even there. 50

Mr.. Highly, on taking the chair, said he had
not anticipated such an honor. He had look
ed for Presiding officer from some other To-
cality, who might bring into the chair more
parliamentary tact and ability than he could
hope to master. We had met to give aid and
countenance to the doctrine of Popular Sove-
reignty. This was the great principle for
which we were about to make up our plan of
battle to-day in old Calaveras. Speaking as
true and constant Democrat, he was proud
to recognize in this body, many with whom,
in days gone by, when Democracy had a
meaning which the people understood and
loved, he had worked shoulder to shoulder,
in the cause. If there are those who once
acted with US, now politically against US, it is
by no fault of ours that we are at war. If
they are numerous aud insidious, so much
greater are the reasons for bold and manful
struggle on our part. That noble principle
for which we contend is worthy noble de-
fense. In the nominations that may be made
here to-day, and in the further action of this
Convention, let there be strength and harmony

pha, arrived in town yesterday morning
from Washoe Valley with four horse
team. He made the trip in six days
leaving home on Saturday morning last
The route of Mr.. Miller was through the
Yuba gap and via the rid ge between the
North and Middle Yubas. Snow lay or
the road for fifty miles averaging tw c
feet deep. A part of the way the snow
is six feet deep.


Mr.. Miller came to Nevada in prefer.
ence to Placerville, for his winters stock
of groceries. He assures us the road is
quite as good and shorter, as he has
found by trying both routes. According
to his calculation, which is on we'll estab.
lished data Nevada is not less than 4C
miles nearer the sink of the Humboldt
where the Carson route and Truckee
unite, than Placerville. We are then
that distance nearer Salt Lake by the
line of travel than Placerville.


Washoe valley is settling up quite
fast, containing twelve families and for
ty men at the present time. Frankville,
the place of trade, istwenty miles off the
road from this place to the sink, but is
not more than 100 miles from here by
the circuitous route taken by Mr.
Miller.


Lynch is the only Judge known in
Washoe. AN sorts of grain and vege-
tables flourish. Two grist mills are in
Carson Valley, 25 miles distant A new
town called Carson city is building in
Eagle Valley, between Carson and
Washoe. A good hotel and stores are
going up.


The overland stage might have run
through Washoe but for the want of pub
lie spirit on the part of some of the citi-
zens wbo refused to comply with re-
uucSt VI tuo Stage OWHcTS 10 Tx rev
miles ofroad.


Washoe is beautiful valley, twelve
miles in length by about six wide. A
lake six miles long lies along its west
ern border. Game is abundant, such as
mountain sheep. antelope, deer, grouse,
&C., &c.


Mr.. Miller returns in about ten days
with load, by the same route he came.
From a tn orough knowledge of the
mountains he thinks himself safe in say
ing the road to this place may be short
ened twenty miles by small outlay on
the hill beyond Bear Valley."

 Texas and ""Free-Soil'-A Flank Move

 ment.

 We publish, for the instruction of our Amer. ican readers, the proceedings of an important meeting held on the 18th of September, at Manchester. The special features which char acterized the advertisement calling the meeting, the abolition sentiment at the bottom of 1t, the evident tendency of thought which flows in a solid current In one direction, with the single exception of General Campbell's protest, iusti- hes the opinion that the free negro party of Eng land is determined to transplant to the soil of the south, the policy that has blasted the West h. dies, and sown the seed of sectional animosity and distrust in the minds of our friends who live in the northern States of the Union. We regret that Mr. Cordovo has used his name as southerner @ and his position as Texan to this undisgulsed attempt on the part of the British free negro party to revive in Texas the issue as between white and negro labor.

 Originating under any other auspices, we would not have noticed the matter But, stand ing as we do in the very midst of the free ne- gro camp, 1t is our duty to sound the alarm when danger, immediate or remote, threatens the south. If the southern people are not vigilant they will soon be placed between raking cross- fire from St. Louis, Baltimore, Texas, and Georgia. The principal gun of the abolitionists was spiked in Missouri when Mr. Blair, by the vote of plurality, was consigned to the shades of private life But Mr. Henry Winter Davis continues to represent Baltimore, and to invite, by his example, that border warfare along the whole line of the tree-so frontier which ex- poses our friends in Maryland and Kentucky to the deadly incendiarism of the abolition agi- tators.""

 The Cotton Plant further notices ""the cor don of fire"" as the abolitionists threateningly term it, attempted to be placed around the slave holding States.

 ""A company was formed in London last year for the purpose of invading Georgia with agents, under the name of free cotton labor ers' A similar scheme in Western Virginia is we presume, working gradually to that point of abolition population which may enable Mr. Thayer to raise defantly and openly the stand ard of rebellion The Georgia invasion has, We believe, been postponed as utterly hopeless The Virginia example may recol upon the in- vaders by exciting greater interest in the minds of the people of the Old Dominion as to the institution of labor which enrches their State, and the importance forthwith of getting rid of the liberated or free,' or emancipated blacks by forced emi grafton to the northern stateS.-- In the north these negroes would cease to pre- sent living and actual condemnation of the social system of the commonwealth on the one hand, and on the other will give the abolitionists practical illustration of the beauties of free negroIsm For we believe that if all the free negroes in Virginia were sent off to Boston, the inundation would revoutionize the politics of the Bay State As an inves tment 1t would pay the other southern states, especially the cotton states to raise by individual, county, or state subscription luuds to defray the expense of i'm porting into Massachusetts all the free negroes of the south. And the south could well spare these slumbering elements of disorder. Free negroism anywhere is bad enough.

 h Jamacia or l1ayti, Sy. Domingo or Africa, the negro population is sufficiently revolting. In Canada and the Northern States the idea of "" ffee' negroism Is almost as bad; but what must we say of ' free"" negroism existing at the south, with the consent of the south, aud by the de- liberate act of the south? II it is right to free"" one negro, it is right to lberate all. The pre-. sent inconsistency is glaring. The example is contagious. The moral is degrading to the poor white man, and deadly in its taint upon our southern system. And the contemplated free"" labor, or rather anti southern movement in Texas, proves the folly of thus tampering by any modified form of abolition or emancipation with the southern philosophy.

 The main argument used is that the climate was peculiarly adapted to the labor of white men, and not adapted to the labor of negroes, hence the importation of English laborers would enable them to raise a supply of cotton. In this however, as the Cotton Plant justly re- marks, they may find themselves mistaken, for it says:

 |"" In the first place, the European emgrant, when Tn Texas, will engage in the pursuit which to him seems most agreeable and profitable. If he finds that raising stock and hunting wild deer suits him better and pays better than toil- ing under hot sun, for the purpose of grow ing cheap cotton, hen will he become ""a stock raiser and huntsman. No legal process can force him out of his own inclination, because the moment the white emigraut reaches Amer. lean soll he becomes free, and no civil contract can be enforced which entails coerced labor- The poor and ensaved white laborer may, in- deed, long to escape from his chains and his dreary factory dungeon in Europe, and crawl wofmlike and abjectely to the republic of white men in the new world. But, once arrived, the glorious sunshine of our free democratic in- sttuilols works a magical transformation, and expanding from the ""operative"" into the citi- zen the unfortunate IS away upon joyous wing lar beyond the reach of Mr. Cordova or the cotton supply association.""

 But what particularly interests us is the fact that while the emancipationists in Missori are urging the employment of white slaves on the ground that the climate is not adapted to ne- groes, we find the cordon closing around us, by like attempt made in Texas. Now if a eli mate south of Us Is not adopted to negro servi- tude, and if the crop scan be better cultivated by white labor, as the renegade DeCordova ass erts 1t follows that Arkansas is in the same catego- "", but, if it be as we have heretofore asserted the proper climate for the negro where the master choses to work him-ours is a slave state And the contrary doctrine once admitted will do infinite mischief for we class this humbug of ""climateS and crops"" with that other hum- bug of Ca necessary evil""

 The rich cotton lands of Arkansas are too great prize to be overlooked by the abolition. ists and we hope that any attempt to colonize them from England or the northern states, will be properly met at the outset and resisted to the last extremity. Abotionism is of English origin and growth and not content with the ruin of their West Indian colonies they seek to spread the same ruin here

 The Cotton Plant further adds:

 |"" In conclusion, we have only to do ourselves the pleasure of recording the very emphatic man. ner in which our worthy Consul at London, who was invited up to Manchester on the occasion. entered his protest against the free negro theory of Mir. Cordova:

 General R. B. Campbell avowed himself to be by nature, by education, and by observ alton, pro-slavery man. He was a Texan also; and he said to the people of England, : if you come among us for civilization of the soil and the in. crease of the cotton supply, we shall be de- lighted to see you in Texas.' (Cheers) But he said too, that if they came there to uproot the institutions of the State, he would rather see them at the bottom of the Atlantic Oaugh- ter;) and he did not know but that if they came they would meet with lynch law He main. taned that the system of slavery was a patri- II I IL Al.

will not await to change the opinions of all true

MED any endorsement of the ticket by the Black
Republicans, but on being interogated whether
he did not expect to receive the vote of the Re-
publicans OF this county, lodged the question, by
turning to Lynch and asking him if the Republi
can vote would elect him whether he would
serve in the Assembly or MOTTO which Lynch
replied that he did not ask any assistance from 50
dark a Source, and that if elected by Black Repub

scorn the idea of there being any connection bc
tween him and the Republicans in fact he went

to say anywhere else,) that if the Black Repnb

that perhaps few of them would vote for him!
What ingratitude Why, the man is already atr
tempting to bite the very hand that is to feed him

he says-which however, we doubt If it were
not for the hope of getting Black Republicans
to vote for them, their ticket would scarcely get

the Broderick Republican ticket will get lust six
votes.

Alexander Robinson, residing in New Castle


proceeded to the house of Peter B. Vandever


on Saturday evening week, and inquired for


Jane Norris, rather pretty Irish glrl, some
twenty-five or three years OF age. They were
informed that she was up stairs and at their


wish she was called to come down. They in.
formed her that her brother was dying and de-
sired to see her. She hastily made arrange


ments TO leave the house, and on stepping into
the street, they hurried her into carriage,
which they had in readiness, and drove rapidly
to the woods between Hare's Corner and Chris
tlana. They then took her from the carriage
and proceeded to execute their vilanous pur-
pose. She struggled violently, when they
kicked her in the side, beat her in the face, cut
her lips and knocked out one or two Of her
teeth. The fends having accomplished their
ends endeaVOred to make her promise that she
would not expose them, threatening her with
death, &c. Que of the Williams remarked that
he had dropped his dirk in the carriage, and
asked hIs cOmrade to 60 and get 1t, that he
might kill her at once. At this juncture the
horse started off, aud the vagabOnds hastily left
IN pursuit, when Miss Norris made her escape,
and though much bruised and fatigued. managed
TO get back 10 New Castle. Turner and Rob
IneOn returned the horse and carriage to MIR.
Mcbride, to whom they belonged, about three
o'clock on Sunday morning, leaving the dirk
behind them. When the news Of The outrage
reached the village great Indignation was felt,
and ycould they have found the williams they
would probably have been lynched.


Robinson was arrested in Philadelphia, and
on Wednesday was conveyed to New Castle
jail by High Constable Hawkins Turner, 90

He was then considered desperate fellow

arrested for rape on Jane Norris. Turner is
yet at large. Miss Norris was so much IN
Jured that on Wednesday last her recovery was
considered doubtful. On Friday, however, her
system rallied, and she was able to answer in.
terrOgatOrIes addressed to her. Robinson, it is
said, prctends to regret his participation in this
outrage, and says If he gets out of this scrapE
safely he will never be caught in another."

the right and high road to democratic and
republican destiny, as nation, is perhaps
best shown by our devotion to the general
interests of the people in providing adequate
postal facilities. And in this respect the
fores'g ut, worth and general fitness for the
office he holds, of Postmaster General A. V.
Brown, is worthy at least of mere mention
IN connection with his action upon the pro-
posed scheme of the Southern Railroad Con-
ventlon. That Convention, being satisfied
that certain things never before done, and
until recently never thought of, were practi-
cable very wisely thought it proper to send
committee to the Postmaster General.

'hat ne has issued an order to convey the
great Southern mail. leaving New York in
the morning, over the Central route. dverp.

5000 per mile; distance 1855 miles.


After the lst of July, 1859 both of the
great Southern mails leaving New York in
the morning and evening will be in connec-
ton with this Central route as a double daily
service. 1t has been ordered to commence
at that time in view of the completion of the
Orange and Alexandria Railroad to Lynch
burg This, it is confidently believed, will!
shorten the time from New York to New
Orleans to three DAYS and twelve hours. at a
compensation for the double daily service of
$500 per mile.


Full through arrangements for passengers
at s48 have also been completed. 1t is un-
derstood tina: arrangements have also been
perfected by the Department, in connection
with the above, for semi-monthlv CaIifor-
MIA mail from New Orleans via Tehuantepec
and Acapulco, and thence by the Pacific
mail steamers to San Francisco, which is be-
lieved will shorten the present time ten days
between New York and California


Aside from those features of this arrange
ment which ha a'e no historical comparison to
testify to their merits, it will be readily un-
derstood, by reference to the fact, officially
stated, that it is but few years since it re-
required twenty-five days to convey the
mail from New York to Nav Orleans that
this undertaking. complete in its details and
reliable in its provisions for fulfilling the
promises made is a matter of vast import
ance; and the official enterprise and talent
which has brought it into action is worthy Of
the highest praise, while its results will have
the widest influence. "". y. News."

Bracy, on Friday, 10Th inst, at Auburn,
violently assaulted a miner named Muir
ply, by striking the sharp point of pick
into the back part of his head, through
which the brain protruded. The friends
of Murphy assembled and demanded the
person of the negro, which was refused
by the Sheriff, whereupon the Jail was
broken open and the negro taken out and
hung. Much excitement prevails, and
great efforts are now being made to bring
these ""Lynchers' to a sense of duty to
their country. Certain claw and order""
journals arc bowling, for buncombe, and
trying to excite ill-feelings and raise
breeze in order to blow their pet ""mob-
bill' out of the reach of ignominious de-
feat, by appealing to the case. The ne
gro, no doubt, thought he had as good a
right to take life with impunity, as had
Herbert, but then he forgot that he was
not Member of Congress and was in
California, where some things can be done
as well as others.


The Auburn Press thus alludes to the
case and takes off the Supreme Court in
parody of ""their opinion on the Archy
case:


We cannot justify or excuse the mob that
hung Bracy, except on the ground of the late
decision of the Supreme Court in the "" Archy
| case"" These people were very much excited,
many were young and nexperienced-oth-
ers, perhaps, in poor health-a1d it was the
first violation of the law. If their case should
be brought before the next grand jury, they
would be forced to notice it--and, in their re-
port, they could say: ""This is fragrant yio-
laton of law and the Constitution, but as the
parties are young men, inexperienced, in poor
health, and it being the first case in which the
county Jail has been broken down, hitherto
supposed almost impregnable; and with the
fullest confidence the like will never be at
tempted again, we find them guilty, but de-
mand no indictments"

where the trains meet aud pass, the train g)ilg
west ran one of lis cars of the track while pass
ing the other trsip. This detained US one hour;
and then, to make up for the time thus los, the
conductor of the train comog east pu. on more


steam and increased his speed, some say to 40 miles
an hour; and Just as we were nearing the Roanoke
River five miles west of Salem, two steers jumped


upon the track while the train was passing reverse
curve and the consequence was, owing To the great
speed the train could not be stopped, and three OF
the cars were literally smashed up-the two bag

mail and about 10 feet in length, were tumbled
down the banks to the river and the front passen-
ger ear was broken up at the top OF the ear. Sew

Only last Saturday morning, similar break-docn
occurred, just below Jonesborough on the East

same line-when three cars were all broken up,


and several persons badly, if not fatally, injured.
On reaching this place about o'clock this morn

about the most hazardous thing man can do-that

seem TO be against his ever returning alive, or

There is d fault in the management Of our rail-
roads and think il has become clearly the duty of


the Legislatures Of the different States 10 pass laws
at their first sessions, compelling all railroad com


panes within their respective States TO fence in their
roads, and TO gate al the crossings and then TO
limit their speed under severe penalties not cx-
ceeding on a straight level grade - miles per
hour, and on curves and descending grades no,


more than - miles per hour. An average speed


of Is miles per hour is much any road in this
country should be allowed to run. We are


tainly pushing through the world too fast and the


sooner this reckless spirit is checked the better.
Every railroad company should be compelled 10


place more men. and those of a trusty class upon


It's road TO see that every rail and tie is safe and


sound and that no obstruction has, by &C .dent or


design, been placed upon the track And, above all


things, every conductor every engineer, and every


brakeman, should be man of experience Of entire


competency, and of unquestionsble reliability. In

trains are men without experience, without fitness,

She was born at Win cheStesr, Tennessee, on the 24sh of March, 1849

 Though only nine brief summers had passed o'er the head of this lovely and gifted child. whose bright Intellect and atfectionate and amlabie disposition endeared her to all, and made her the pride of her dotins, widowed mother yet death, with his chilly arms, en- oraced her for his own. Weep not fond mo- ther, that thy darling child is rescued from the | evil days to come; she was too pure flower for earth, and thou hast now another induce ment to attract thy spirit to the heavenly landl ne flowers oi earth are but types of the beauty of Gods kingdom, where she walks and communes with the angels. The heavens have now another star in their sweet embrace. that will shine forever, undimmei by sorrow and | unchanged by time. To those mourning friends who could but dearly love her upon earth, her spirit points to the God of all consolation for | comfort. To heaven may your thoughts ever turn as raiient point where you may find rest, sweeter and softer than any upon earth Sleep on, sweet SAMUELLA in thy peaceful rest: we hope to meet thee, dearest one, where we can Join you In singing heavenly melodies, with the whlte-robed throng above. A FRIEND

 Died-On the 8th Aug, while on visit to her uncle, MT. Whetmore Augusta, Jack son county, Ark, after a short illness, MARIA JOSEPHINE, daughter of Col Wyatt and Rebec- ca Temple, of Pulaski county.

 This melancholy event was sudden and uu- expected, thus adding pang to the blowit in. l Hlcted upon the relative and friends from whom she had 50 lately parted in the bloom and vi9or oi youthful health. But few hours previous to her attack she was in the enjoy inent of her usual health, mingiing in the so- cal circle of which she was so bright an or. nament. Possessing from her cradle all the advantages of pious precepts and examples to direct her pathway through life she while vet child sought and found that religion so hap- pily exemplifed in the lives of her parents and grandparents and connected herself with the Methodist Episcopal church.

 Her amlabie disposition and manners drew around her large circle of friends. and such were the excellencies Of her character that she retained most remarkably the confidence and affection ot every acquaintance she once form ed. She was cheerful without levity, pleasant without attectation, co .rteous and kind to all. Her very presence seemed to dispel gloom. to asSua5e grief, and to bring pleasure and se- renlty into every circle, and around every fire side she visited!

 but youth though adorned by every human grace and excellence is no talsman against mortality and death has bighted the prospects of her maiden heart and withered the hopes of fond and atfectionae relations. The void when her death has caused in her immediate family and neghborhood cannot be filled.

 '' But she too fair and dear

 For our troubled pathway here;

 Heaven that was her natural sphere

 las It's own removedn

 When told she could not recover, she ex. pressed her willingness to die, and turning to a beloved aunt, requestet her to sing two of her favorlte hymns"" Am a soldier of the cross"" and There Is Fountain filled with blood"" II she should become speeches. When these were sung though the spirit was dim and death had already chilled her limbs, she testified her appreciation of their divine Beauty, by repeat ed signs to those around her, and with smile the last warm life pulse ceased

 In mourntul loveliness she slumbers

 here the forest how'rets wave:

 Trees are sounding dirge-like numbers

 Der her calm and peaceful grave.

 'Ils haowed spot and fitting

 To entomb the young-she fair

 Where the bright wild birds are fitting,

 Spinkling incense on the air.

 Weep not in the spirits iightness,

 'Iis d blessed lot to seep

 Ere earths shadows dim it's brightness

 To depart; o. wherefore weep!

made of the meeting held here last week, at
which Messrs Anderson & Co. spoke. The
notice also publishes several resolutions
which it is said were offered by Schellhouse.
No such resolutions were otfered-but long
string Of others, which Mr. Ball had prepar-
ed, and got Schellhouse to of.r. AS those
resolutions wee not the real sentiments Of
the Democracy of this section of Placer

ments, such as might be expected from a
Boter and sympathiser with Black Repub-
Mr. Lynch, drew up The following set of res
olutions At the solicitation CT several of the
voters of this precinct, and which meet the
hearty endorsement of the true Democracy,
and offered them as an amendment to those
offered by Schelhousc

ance under any circumstances.


When these resolutions were offered, and
the meeting was about passing them, Mr.
Ball begged of them not to do it, as it would

The Report of Ieienhart's Lynch1ne
Unfounded..-He Attempts to Break
Jail. &C.",,"JAIL cxcs


LEXINGTON, LIE Sueur Co. Nov, 25.
To tie Editors of tie Ninnesotiam:


have noticed a statement going the rounds
of the press that Rienhart, the supposed muir
derer of Bodell has been lynched by the peo-
pie of LIE Sueur County. There is no truth
in it, Rienhart is now in the Jail that was built
by the citizens of this place, it being built in
the most thorough manner of solid oak and
iron.


What gave rise to the rumor that he was
lynched is probably owing to the fact that a
number Of Germans from Rice County, hav-
ing been informed that we, the citizens Of
Lexington, were in favor of lynching the pris-
oner, and that they would meet with no resis-
tance from US, came about Is in number
for that purpose, and as soon as they found
they had been wrongly informed, and that
We, as a law abiding people, would not allow
the commission of such an act in our midst,
they returned quietly to their homes, some Of
them having come 80 miles.


Rienhart made an unsuccessful attempt to
break Jail on Sunday night. He succeeded in
twisting apart his hand cuffs and then tried
his utmost to force the door, but found it too
well secured He was Immediately re-ironed
in more secure manner


He still strongly protests his innocence
Knowing well the feelings of the people of this
place and vicinity, would say that they will
defend the prison from Lynch law, and see
that he has fair and impartial trial, which
will come off next March. S."

latter who have been in the habit of abusing
Walker without stint. 1t is now even hinted
that the passengers on board the steamship

are filibusters; and White himself says that
as the United States Government would not
protect him and his contract, he has come to
the conclusion to protect himself 1t is sta
ted that he had the offer from Gen. Jerez, of
the contract awarded to Mr. Vandyke, but
that he refused it, believing the one which he
at present holds valid in all respects 1t is
difficult to determine what the present COM
plcaton will lead to. Gen. Hennngsen ar
rived in Washington on Monday, in response
to a dispatch from White, and an interview
took place between him and Walker last
night, the intention being to talk over and
settle old feuds Senor Yrisarri is also now
implicated as one of the Filibusters and is, it
is alleged, to furnish passports to all ""emi-

The last Legislature of Minnesota, which
was Demo cratic, passed an act that its sue
cessor should not assemble in two years, un-
less called together by Gov. Sibley. The re-
turns make it very evident that the Legisla-

exceedingly probable that Gov Sibley will
never call it together at all so that the terms
of the members elect will come and go with
no chance whatever, on their part, to per

The Louisville merchant paid for the whisky according to the tenor of the dis patch, as delivered at Cincinnati, and sued the telegraph company for the loss occasioned by the mistake Tn transmitting the dispatch The company's defense was, mainly, that the head ing Of their dispatches notified the plaintiff that they would not be liable for mistakes unless dispatches were repeated at an advanced cost, and that plaintiff knew this to be the rule of the company, yet did not cause his dispatch to be repeated.

FRUIT TREES.


The following is believed to be very near cor
rect estimataoi the numbers of fruit trees and
vines now under successful cultyation; Peach
trees from one to five years Old. l0.2ZS: Apple
trees. 6.32l; Pear, 594; Plum, 66s; Cherry, 2O4;
Apricot, 200; Ounce POS, Nectarine, 81 Fig. G7;
Almond, II; PersimmoA. 6; Pecan. Is; Black
Walnut s: Strawberry vines, l2l,S.o; Grape
vines, 4,23l.


The following named gentlemen are especially
entitled TO notice for the zeal aud energy mani
tested in cultyating fruit trees. vines, and orna-
mental shrubbery: Col. VIM. McClure. Yankee

/ In connection with fruit orchards | would say,
! that owing to the unusually severe and late ro>ts
| last Spring. many of the fruit buds were killed.
aud consequently the amount Of fruit raised was
very limited for this season. In many instances.
| however, the fruit trees have grown beyond what
mi gllt have been expected bad they horne fruit:
aud the prospects are, that if Jack Frost will
only stand aioof next Spring. our fruit growers
will reap most desirable harvest for their past
labors The fruit, such as peaches. which is
usually brought from the Valley below, bears no
comparison to that which is raised in our own
county, either in size. flavor or beauty; This is
owing, doubtless. to our fruit rasers having
better quality of fruit trees than many Of those
who have been in the habit OF sending their fruit
into the interior.


CEREALS.


The number of bushels of cereal grains raised
this year sum as follows: Wheat, los 600 bushels:
Barley about 100, 900 bushels; Oats, about 400
acres, mostly cut for Hay.


In 1852. according to the census returns of that
year. there were raised in this county, 1890
Bushels OF barley-this year there were raised


10000 bushels; wheat, in 50, IS bushels-this
year l0S.000 hcs. These two items alone
demonstrate the progress which has been made in
this county for the last six years.

mittee of tae New Castle County Teachers
Association, appointed to. confer with a similar
, committee of this body, with regard to the pre-
t llmlnary arrangements tor the permanent or
, ganzatjOn of a State Teachers Association
; The President then stated, that owing to the
absence OF the Secretary Of the Association,
the constitution adopted at the last meeting
was not at hand, consequently no opportunity
could be given for persons to become members
this afternoon.


Prest Newlin, the lecturer for the evening,
not being present, it was moved that the address
Of Mr.. 0. N. Bass, A. b., be deferred until
cvcnlng,-carried. The President proposed
III the absence of the speakers for the afternoon
; that the Association should proceed to the DIS
: cusslon OF some subject Of interest. Mr.. Mar
TIN suggested that "" the best manner Of fur
nlshlng text books to our common schools "" be
taken up and discussed. Great difficulty was
experienced in forming classes, owing to the
variety Of authors ased,-that parents object
to tie purchasing of new books, und he thought
1t necessary TO the interests of education that
unltCrm series Of text books should be adop-
ted.


Mr.. Roberts asked if the law allowed the
common funds OF the school to be applied to the
purchasing Of books. Mr.. Putnam did nc,
think the law was definite in regard 10 the ap-
plication Of the money.


Mr. Bass spoke ct some length Stated that
a uniformity of books was essential to the best
Interests of the school, he thought that commits
soncrs should purchase the books that the
Teachers should supply the scholars as they
have need, charging the parents with the same.
Discretion should be used in determining the
books to be unanimously adopted.


Mr.. Clements stated that in his district thew
had adopted the plan proposed by Mr.. Bass,
and were much pleased with the result.


Mr.. Lewis, of Bradford Co., Pa, stated that
! IN Pcnnsy yvana, the delegates appointed bv
the directors Of the different townships meet in
County Convention for the purpose OF adopting
text books.


Mr.. Lynch spoke in regard to the advantages
to be derived tron having a uniformity OF
books.


The President remarked that the gentlemen
were leaving the question; that it was rener-
ally admitted, that a variety Of books initiate
very much against the Improvement of scholars
Tie hoped they would confne their remarks to
the best method OF furnishing books 10 our COM
mon schools.


Mr.. Putnam thsught it certainly was noces-
sary TO have uniformity OF books, bat there was
somc difficulty In adopting ""a text book, which





Mr.. Williams, of Pa, proposed that the conl-
missloners purchase The books with the common
school funds, and tlat the books should be re-
tanned al school.


A set of resolutions on the subject, were now
presented, and On motion the whole subject was
postponed until Tomorrow at 10 o'clock A NJ.


On motion, committee Of three was ap-
pointed TO have the Court Room prepared for
the eyeaing exercises. On motion, adjourned
till Z o'clock p. NJ.


T. M.-Pursuant to adjournment the As
soclatIon met and was addressed by o. n. BASS
On the subject Of education. The address was
interesting and instructive, and evnced know
ledge of the practical workings of the present
system, and also { clear idea q what il should
be. History proves that nation is prosperous
in proportion to tho general diffusion of know.
ledge and the education of the masses. The
prosperity OF our own institutions depends upon
the success Of our free schools


After the lecture, the President made some
pertinent remarks on the present school system.
Laws are bat the expression of the will of the
people; therefore, to have good laws, it is ne
ccssary to have an enlightened people. To
secure good school system We must enlist the
interest Of the people. This can best be effect
ed by such Associations as the present; hyre
we have free Interchange Of opinion, and
each one is prepared to exert his influence in
his own particular district.


DR.. Jump being called upon, made some ex-
cellent remarks in regard TO cduca ton, and en-
couraged the members of the Association to
peraevere in their audable undertaking.


Mr Eli Salisbury was then called upon
He was pleased TO meet with his brcihren in
the cause of education. He considered the
present school system very defective, and hoped
soon to see a change for the better, more law
was necessary. lie thought children should
be taught the rudimcnts Of education at home.


Mr. George p. Fisher agreed with the gen.
tlcman, that a change was necessary, but diff
fered with him in tle method by which it could
be effected. He thought that it should be made
compulsory for eUery mdn 10 pay a tGC for the
support Of public schools. lie also advocated
giving Teachers better pay. They generally
deserve more credit and remuneration than
they receive. Whereupon an animated discus
sion was carried on by Messrs. Salisbury and
Fisher, on the subject of taxation. MIR. Pen
nington also addressed the meeting; after
which, the Association adjourned.
i Wednesday, 7h,-The convention met at 8
o'clock in the Levy Cour. room. The Presi-
dent presented constitution similar to the one
previously adopted, which was then signed by
the teachers present
On motion, committee of two was appoint

forming a State Teachers Association.

Mr.. Sharp was introduced by the President,
and delivered very able address on Muthemo

best manner Of teaching them. The subject
was further discussed by several others. The
resolutions offered yesterday afternoon were
! then taken up, and after some discussion and
amendment, were adopted, as follows:


Resolved, Thatto advance the cause ofcom-
mon scaool education in Delaware, the schools

THE New TEaRrToHrEs.- Besides the ter
ritories which Congress has organized. we have
now three others which, grown impatient Of
waiting, are taking steps 10 organize them
selves.


Arizona, which has population counted
as yet only by hundreds, has elected q terrific
rial delegate and sent him 10 Washington,
A bin was proposed last winter creating 4
government for this territory, but it failed Il

shape.


Dacotah is also taking q definite form
Her people have completed an independent
temporary organization Of the territory, Ia con.
tinue until Congress shall give them the usual
form Of territorial government. State officers
were appointed. a, Legislature convened. laws
passed, &C.. and the Minnesota code or 1857
adopted. They assign as their reason for this
action, thai they were LETT entirely without
laws. except those Of the Lynch order. and
that the disorganized state of society keeps
away emigration. They point. in justification
to the precedent set them by California and
Oregon. Revolutionary as such q procedure
would be considered in any other country but
the United States, il Is here an evidence ol
the law-loying and law-abfding character ol
the people. and a guaranty that they arc
disposed % maintain orier and respect the
obligations of citizenship.


Superior, or Ontonagon, is also moving.

with mingled emotions of astonishment shame and
Indignation. If, as the rheOricans say, the ab-


stBce of truth IL the absence Of beauty this report
must be the most hideOus production of our times
| for there is hardly d sentence Of truth in it.
From the topic Of Kansas Mr. Wilson passed on

to restrain him from the expression of the opinion
ttat "" If there weIe frauds they were equally great
| on both sides"" We should be charitable 10 con
| fesstd ignorance, but We are not required to be


charitable to the presumptuous expression OF opln
ions based upon confessed ignorance. The Senator
talks about regiments Of cIngrauts recruited IN the


purcus Of the great cities Of the North, and sent
| ont armed With Sharps rifles, and bowe-kniyes


and REVIEWERS to conquer reedOin tor Kansas. HAD
the Senator studied as Senator should have done.


the details Of the history Of Kansas he would never
| have given utterance to such language. lle Stna-


tor goes 10 charge the people of Kansas WITH re-
framing from going to the polls and making Kansas
Free State when they had the power, in order to


defeat and destroy the Democratic party. This a6-


sp,d declaration has Do foundation ia fact and every
intelligent man in America who understands the al


fairs of Ksnsas aud whose opinions are Vi any value,
| knows this to be 80.


After referring to tie $50, 900 square miles Of the


South. TO its fine soil and delightful climate, to It's
control Of the great valley of the Mississippi, the


seat of future empire, the Senator boasts that they
have on their muster rolls million of men-lnen
brought up horseback, with guns III their hands
every one of whom, in an emergency, would be
available as h soldier. These boasts are simply ri
diculous. They VIII excite a smile everywhere
among people who have any adequate conception of

7 he Senator, filled with magnificent visions of
Southern power, crowns cotton King, and tells ns
that if they should stop supplying cotton for three
years, England would toppe headlong, and carry the
whole civilized world with her, save the South.
What presumption Doubtless the coffee planters
of Brazil, the tea-growers Of China, and the wheat
growers on the shores of the Black Sea indulge in the
same magnificent illusions. IheSenatOr should know
that the commercial world Is not governed by the
cOtton-planters of the South any more than BY the
coffee planters Of Brazil the growers Of China or
the wheat. growers of Eastern Europe. England,
France, Germany and the Northern States of this
Union are the commercial manufacturing and none
tary centers Ofthe world The cotton planters of the
South are simply their agents, and perform their
tasks very much as the black slaves of the South
perform the tasks set for them by their masters.


The Free States in 1850 produced SS50, 900 600
of Ofmanufactures, only SOP OOO, 900 of which was of
cotton. Our manufacturers now must exceed
$3.50 900, OO0, Otwhich cotton does not make
than S7O,OO0,COO. The productive industry Of
Massachusetts,, which State manufactures more than
onethird Of all the cotton used in the country, was,
in 1855, $3.50 600, 900, of which only 500 100000
was of cotton. These figures show the absurdity of
tL.c cla s.t m nm
of cotton. 1t is, however no great matter of sur
prise that gentlemen who live away of on cross
roads where the cotton blooms. should come to the
conclusion that cotton rules the world few
months intercourse with the world would cure that
dehIsiOn. '|YOu are factors. excialIns the
Senator from South Caropa,' ''you fetch ana

returns from this cha nbcr to his cotton fields, hi

Nassa YOU only sels de cotton: we plants, We
""hoes, We picks de cotton 'Spose We discharge
''you. Massa!"" The unsOphistcated ""mudsls
would be quite as reasonable as the Senator.


The Sela or from South CarOlins cOmpacently
tells the country that the marvellous strength OF the
South arises from the harmony OF her political aud
social nsiiutlOns-that her forms OF society are the
best in the world and that she has IN extent of
political freedom combined with entire security seen
no where else on earth. The South. he tells Us, is
satisfied, harmonious aud prosperous.


This self-conplacency is truly sublime Is that
society the best in the world where more than
three millions of men and women are held as chat

bloOdhOunds, scourgDg, lynchngs and burnngs at

plantation far from the haunts of men, where unas-

with the frankness worthy of cOmmendaiOn, unfolds
TO the world the social ideas and political problems
of that school of which he is an accepted teacher.
He tells Ills that the poor the men who live BY daily
labOr-our operatives ar We call them-are

Importance from the fact the well-known fact that


South Carolina has impressed her ideas and imposed


her policy upon the rest of the South upon the Ad-
minstratOn, and upon the Lecompton Democracy


The Senator utters her sentiments, the sentiments
che las imposed upon the Democracy which she now
leads These sentiments 90 unrebuked IN these halls


by the supporters of this Administration. No
Democratic Senator has Yet questioned these
assumptions or dissented from these views.


To listen to the Senator from South Carolina we


should suppose that the white men of the South
were all men Of wealth and culture and refinement
that they were all lords and masters-thst labor
was all performed by the bondmen-that all the
white men were leaders of progress. civilization


and refinement We should imagine that the South

 The Arkausaw Traveller has an article defn- ing the position of its editor, in the late canvass He was not candidate in opposition to cov vention, as the only two counties in the district that held conventions favored him. That he was know nothing he emphatcally denies, but we suppose the denial is needless, for Scott for the last four years, has been doing good ser vice in the democratic ranks.

 He also reprehends the custom so prevalent in Arkansas, of admitting persons to bail who have committed homicide. Unless criminals are strictly dealt with, the number of fights and murders will increase instead of decreas- ing

 The South Arkansas Democrat has the fol- lowing in relation to the crops:

 ""The crops of this county are generally very good, and would have been unusually so, but for the long continuance of the dry weather in the latter part of the season. There will be surplus of corn made for home consumption in this county. There was heavy rain here on yesterday""

 The Washington Telegraph thus speaks good word for our city, in view of the Des Arc meeting in rel ation to the removal of the Sta;e capitol.

 ""Gov Conway, in his message to the last Legislature, recommended an appropriation for the purpose of repairing the capitol building, now in rather dilapidated condition; but the Legislature not only refused to make such an appropriation, but came near designating ano- ther point for the erection of new capitol.- The question of removing the capitol we see s again being agitated. The citizens of Des Arc, Prairie county, recently held meeting on the subject, and proposed erecting the necessary buildings and donating them to the State, if the Legislature would remove the seat of govern meut from Little Rock to Des Are Teis IS liberal enough, but really We do not see any reason why the capitol should be re- moved at all. It is well enough situated where 1t is, and is more central and fully as accessi- ble Des Are or any other point have heard suggested. The people of the State at large would not be benefited by its removal, | aud that the interests of few should he pro- noted at the expense and to the injury o the people of Little Rock, would be an act of in- justice.""

 The Telegraph has, also, the followingitem ""The Monticello Sage in sf<akjng of the ar rest of James F. Lane, late candidate for the Legislature in Polk county. and his removal to North Carolina, says that he was charged with the crime of murder This is mistake. It was pecuuiary matter altogether. 4 gentle man residing in Green boro', \. C., was his security for the payment of some eight hun dred or a thousand dollars, which. Lane left hIm to pay, absorbing from the State. The gentleman asceItaintd his whereabouts-came on, arrested him and took h;m back""

 The Fort Smith Times has this word to say in relation to the removal of the capitol:

 Friend Merrill, look out, may be, We in the west would like to have the seat of govern ment of the State little more tcest than Des Arc an! q little more central too. What would ! Des Are think of having the capitol removed and located about Dardauelle?-Eht

 The State Rights Eagle has rather dis ! couraging account of the cotton crop in that section which, 1t says will not be more than half crop.

 From the Des Arc Citizen we learn of the death of Hon. Tom B. Turner, of Prairie coun- ty.

 The editor in reply to an article in the Trav- eer relative to the removal of the capitol, to Philadelphia, contends that they have at Des Arc, the best location in the State

 The Van Buren Intelligencer has the follow ing item:

 EXTRAORDINARY ANGLING-On Tues day last the tinuy tribe suffered by the hook. A party of anglers composed of Capt. Pennywit, Capt. Thruston, Levi Chapman, J. NJ. Clemm. J. r. smith and L. Jones, proceeded to the Mclaughlin lake, about eight miles below this piacp and aif fnur h,>urc ttSi .b,,- 1O4 of the finest trout it was ever our lot to lay our eyes on.""

 The editor notes the arrival of one of But terfeld & Co.'S. overland mail coaches with three passengers.

 The Fort Smith Times notices the arrival of the U. $. troops as follows:

 ""rhe U. s. troops, under command of It. Steen, designed as an escort for It. Beale, ar rived here on the 9th inst. They came by water to Roseville, where they disenbarked, the river being too low for the steamer Light foot, on which they were to proceed farther up the river. We learn that the health of the command is good.'

 The Powhatan Advertiser has the follow ing in relation to the man who was pursued ftom Tennessee and hung in this State:

 "" The man who was found hanging to a tree near Grahd Glaize in Jackson county, a week or so ago, has of course been properly buried by the good citizens of that neighborhood. - We are like our neighbor of the Balance. op- posed to being hanged in any way--but if hung We want DO labels on our back We would like to know what is the difference between a horse thief and Tennessee horse thief.'-- This man when found was marked and labeled Tennessee horse thief and if Tennessee horse thief what jurisdiction had Arkans,,s over him, admitting the justice of lynch law? Ar. kansas horse thieves had better look out when in Tennessee or they will be labeled""

 The Jefferson Independent in an article re- lative to the removal of the capitol, puts in a claim for Pine Bluff In his article the ed tor gives us some items relating to the growth of that section of the country. He says:

 ""There were brought last year into the coun. ties of Jefferson, Arkansas aud Desha, by plan- ters and traders about four thousand negroes, that are now almost all engaged in cultivating our great staple There Is scarcely planter in our county that has not put this year in cuti- vaion one-i fifth more land than usual. and where places have changed hands, the increase of open land has been much greater. Town and country, as a matter of course, keep pace in improvement with each other""

 The article winds up this way:

 ""Why shouldn't we have the capitol here, if Little Rock be growing too old fogy for our fast legislators? If our river navigation does | not satisfy the travelling wants of that body, 1 we will resuscitate and build for them our now | defunct railroad to Napoleon. We will make | any amount of promises as to what we will do |"
26_1858-09-15_p2_sn82014282_00414212438_1858091501_0401,Arkansas true Democrat.,01,1858-09-15,p2,,,"suppress this vice. Our readers abroad must not suppose that these are for ""tabe games"" Such as faro, roulette, etc., but for any simple game on which anything is bet no matter how small the value and for playing cards on Sun- day, even when there is no betting In Arkan- sas, if man calls another a liar, fight is the result. No matter how small the insulted man, he is bound to fight Hence the apparent large number of assaults and assaults and batteries The remainder of indictments are generally against overseers of roads for derelection of duty and for similar offences. These are not, prop ery speaking, crimes.

 Thefts, except of horses, or stock, which is

 he general term for cattle, hogs, etc, are gen. erally in towns and cities. There is very little inducement to commit theft. for any able bodied man or woman can always make support and something more. Labor is plentiful and the cost of living mere trihe. None are compell- ed to pilfer, and where 1t is done it is by those who are too lazy to work. In this connexion 1t may be proper to state that crime. on the de- crease in Arkansas can be still lessened if uries who try these cases, will do their whole duty. IL is too often the case that crimes go unpunished because of leniency of the jures. Eloquent and ingenious counsel somehow succeed very often, in the face of direct proof, in obtaining an acquittal of their clients.

 The population of Arkansas is about half of that of the city of New York, yet there are more crimes committed in that city in a month, than in our State in year. In fact, taking the ninety felonies committed in Arkansas in the year 1857, and deducting those committed by Indians on the border, by persons emgrating and passing through the country, and those who have committed crimes in other States, and are followed and punished here, and it will be found that crime is as rare here as in other States. Even in the land of steady habits, among the puritans of the North, their mur- ders, though fewer, are cool, deliberate assass- nations, or wholesale murders, for purposes of robbery, or poisnings.

 Except in cities, icentiousness is very rare The people in the country are free from those vices so common in more thickly populated States. We have. as yet, TO isms among Us. The farmers are simple, honest, hard work ing class, and in this respect will bear compari- son with any body of people in the world

 Of late years rogues have found that our cli- mate does not agree with their constitutions The bully, the desrerado and the adventurer, find that the people do not fear or countenauce them. There is growing respect for the laws and determination to put down vice. Upon the commiltal of any outrage there is too often disposition to take the law in their own hands, but of late Judge Lynch is becoming unpopular. The safest way to banish him, forever, is for courts and juries to deal rigidly with all ofend- CTS and suffer none who are guilty to escape, no matter how respectable their connexions may be, or how strong an array of legal talent they may be able to command An examination of the statistics of crime shows US that while Ar kansas has more street fights or atirayS, she has fewer assassinations and cowardly murders than other members of the confederacy.

 So far as morality is concerned, she is not be- hind her sisters. There are whole communi- ties where murder or theft has not been com mitted for years and in many counties, jails are tenantless sometimes for year at a time. For instance, inthe returns from Montgomery coun- ty, the clerk, MT. Woolard, writes that 10 felo- nies were committed in that county for year past, the only breaches ofthe peace being assaults and assaults and batteries; in all, eight cases

 As regards paupersm, there is less of it in Arkansas than among any equal number of peo- pie in Chrstendom. Very few counties have considered 1t necessary to establish house, the few poor persons in the county, rendered dependent by disease or bodily infrmity are supported directly from the county treasury. Those persons living in the old States,"" or in the crowded cities of the North, can form no just idea of the ease with which a living can be procured. To illustrate this we will relate an occurrence in one of our northern counties. family, tne father and mother having been sick for long time became dependent and ap. plcatlon was made to the county court for relief proposition was made to establish a poor house which was negotiated. At last fifty dol lars was appropratei to be disbursed by the sheriff He immediately had the man to apply for and enter forty acres of land for actual set clement, which cost five dollars. Ten dollars more hired a mar to cnt set of honselogs. ln a week or two the house was raised and a few dollars more put roof on it. The family was moved in and the remainder of the fifty dollars judiciously invested in the purchase of meat and meal, secured them food for the win ter. Thus from pauper the man was trans formed into house. holder, and free. holder and placed above want. In fact, where farm can be purchased for five dollars, where the means for years subsistence can be earned in one or two weeks, there is no reason why any should want. Destination Is rare, and then the result of continued sickness or incorrgble laziness. In the northern and western portions of our State, wheat and corn are abundant; pork is usually sold in the fall at from two to four ceEts pound, and it requires but a small sum to lay up enough of these to last year. Our lOfestS III Oui ilNcIo dic StoChou with fish and the means of subsistence are within reach of all.

 This article has grown tedously long, yet we have been compelled to omit much that we wished to say. We intended to contrast the amount of crime in this with that in other States, but have not the room. We are content to state the case fairly, extenuating nothing. If the number of indictments found appears large we are satisfied that if as an impartial exhibit was made of those found in other States, ours would not suffer by the comparison, and every year shows decided improvement in thls respect.

A MAN HUNd BY A MoB.-A few weeks
ago a constable named yimmons. was shot by
U man named Kesler, in Gentry County,
CMo,] under circumstances which made the
act, .in the estimation of the people, a cruel
outrage. The murderer was arrested and put
in Jail at Albany and word sent to Judge Nor
ton, at Platte city, that if a special term was
not held Immediately for the trial of the pris-
oner, he would be tried before Judge Lynch.
Judge Norton called the special term as re-
quested; but, on the trial. it was found that
two of the prisoners important witnesses had
been driven off and could not be found.


The counsel for the defence asked a contin-
uance which was granted; and the Judge,
interring from the appearance of things that
an attempt would be made by tile crowd to
take the prisoner out of the hands of the Of
ficers, appointed guard of twenty five men
to conduct him to jail. But the guard had
no sooner taken It's position than rush was
made by the crowd, and. the prisoner torn
from the officers and born off to the woods
few hundred yards distant. Arrived there,
the prisoner was allowed to say his prayers.
after which a rope was put around his neck
and he was hung to tres. Pne mob was
composed of about fifty persons.--St. Louis
Meas.


STILL ANoTHER.-The st. Louis Republican
has the following account Of the repetition of
the tragedy. The latter is dated on the 9th,
at st. Joseph:


""The people of Gentry have been guilty of
another horrible murder. 1 wrote you of the
summary execution of Kesser for the killing
Of TimnoRs, and stated that, as Miig4n's
case was continued by the state, it was agreed
that he should live until the regular term of
the Circuit Court, and undergo the formali-
tlesof trial. A guard was appointed to
4. watch his prison. No appropriation was made
tor their support, and they became wearied
with so thankless and tedious an employment,
and abandoned their posts The mob went to
the county court yesterday and demanded an
appropriation for the expenses of a guard,
and, upon refusal, they proceeded to the
prison. took Milligan oul and led him to the
same tree upon which Kessler had, ten days
before, been hung. He requested. to be bap-
tized, which was done in brook near by.
Here he hadean interview with his old father
which was deeply affecting. He was then
taken back to the tree and hung until dead""

The French are still rejoicing over their victory
in China. Not that they rejoice at the event as We
do at the success Of the Transatlantic Telegraph.
They do not explode in rocketty jubiation, nor pro
ceed through the illuminated streets by countless
thousands nor set fire to the Hotel de Ville They
have not let off single pack of fre-crackers IN
appropriate celebration of their Chinese conquest.
True, il is not SO important as the one over and
under the elements which so delights Us; but We
are an immessurably more exctable, expansive, de.
monstrative, frskier people than the French. The
proposition may SEEM at first glance, paradox;
il only depends ON how one looks at it 10 see It's

Some eighteen months since a wealthy farmer of
Kentucky living near CsmpbelsvLe, was murdered
and robbed OF between sJ,O0e and $4,000 10y parties
who entered his house at midnight aud accomplished
the double deed wnie ne soundly sleeping in his
bed. Mr. Simpson was wealthy and highly re'pecta-
be- snd of the cowardy murder caused great
excitement in his community Soon after the guilty
cuprts were discovered aud arrested aud an attempt
was made BY the populace to hapg them, which Was
frustrated. Afterwsrd they were taken from the jail
at Russellville TO that at Greensburg. Now the
second and awful tragedy opens on the 10Th ""eines
day last as reported to The Loa.srNe Journal of the
10Th.


This morning. according to aprevious understand
ing men from this ard tue adjoining counties conf
mencei gathering at ths place, and AT an early hour
took up their march to Greenburg, meeting with nc'
esslons at different points along the road unti the
crowd numbered two or three hundred men, including
q considerable number Of spectators. The mob pro-
ceeded TO the jail which is built OF stone and very
strong and found the doors locked and the aer gone
a number of men Immediately seized large piece at
heavy timber, and, with several tremendous blows,
bursted the door from its hinges. An inner door was
speedily broken with crow.bars ana sledge hammers
and portion Of the mob stood in the debtors ROOM
frortug the cells in which the miserable men were
confined The locks of the cell doors were soon broken
and the doors pried open, when most horrd anu





present.


One Of the men, Elias Scaggs, a man weighing
two hundred pounds found welterinx III large
pool of blood in the last ag0nles of death the blood
spirtpg in large jets from ghasty anu sell-nllced
wound in the neck, having with razor cut ms throat

when the crowd in double file, amd throngs o spec
tators took up their return march TO TINS place. u.s.
tance of twelve miles, during which two OF the mser-
able men displayed c0nsde rable trnness, asserting
their innocence in the most ppsltlvete terms. Thompson
wept and prayed audby good part ot tine way, call
ipg On all to witness his innocence The crowd uaving
arrived att place. determined TO lynch Beko also,
negro belonging to q e murdered man, who had been
implicated by Scraggs az the real murderer.
At this inucture, amid the ye'ngs and h0wlngs of
the crowd the expOstuations OF the Sheriff and our
excellent TAILOR, and "" amid confusion w0rse con-
founded Robert Colyin, esd, prominent aud IN
fuential citizen, having succeeded in gaining an ele-
waited position and IN catching the ear OF the crowd,
addressed it in short speech which, Tor pot appro-
prateness and good sense, have hardly ever heard
txceed and it was as efectual as it sensible for
after an unsuccessful effort Of two inexper-
enced orators the mob left the negro IN jail aud con-
ducted the three short distance 10 an elm tree,
and began making Preparations to hang them. At

abou, his neck the end thrown over limb, the horse
driven from under, aud Thompson was launched into
eternity. He seemed to die easy-oue or two spas-
motic erkings Of the limbs, shudder, and al was
over.


Despano soon shared similar fate, dying mnch
harder At this stage Hunter gave evidence Of making
clean brsast, which, after some delay and good
deal OF reluctance he did, contessiug TO the guilt oi

lieye, generally considered innocent. The Sheriff,
with posse, IS out tonight 70 arrest the others.

forth, and the two confronted. NotbUg of Importance
