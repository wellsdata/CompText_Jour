""A private letter from Boston, printed
in the New York Anti-Slarery Standard,
gives the following account of what was
probably intended to be an exclusively
private affair, but which is worth some.
thing for its significance. 1t occurred on
the evening of the 1st, after the amanci-
patton jubilee in Music Hall, Boston:


That was a holy day. Its close found us at
the house of Mr.. and Mrs. Stearns, of Medford,,
to witness the uncovering of Bnckett's bust Of
John Brown. You will know what the even
ing was when 1 tell you that among the inter-
esting people present were Mr.. Garrison, Mr..
Phillips, Mr.. Emerson, Mr.. Alcott, Judge Con-
way Mr.. Sanborn, and Samuel Longfellow.
Mr.. Phillips, with few fitting words, uncov-
cred the bust. Mr.. Emerson read to us again
the grand poem which he gave at the concert
wish you might have shared all that day. Can
you think the end is very near at hand Do you
think there is military or moral spirit at the
North equal to conquerng the South? l can
see in the future only separation from the South,
followed by years of tragedy and disorder, un-
til the North divorced from the deceased part
ner, grows strong and good enough to draw
back the South into tr'Ie union of hearts.


In confirmation of the gloomy views
of the Richmond Ecuniuer, the Boston
Journal publishes the following extract
from a private letter written by a Southern
refugee, who is in communication with his
friends at the South:


! can assure you, upon the authority of trust
worthy men coming from the South, that the
suffering and destitution there is greater than
you have seen it stated in the papers. If our
forces continue to press the enemy, and the
European powers do not intervene, the South
must 90 by the board. True, they have fought
without a navy without the advantage we have
enjoyed, and with desperation never before
equalled; but they, mean the rank and file,
are heartily SICK and want to get out of the
war; Many of their men are now deserting and
coming into our ranks. These, for the most
part, are conscripts and have been Union men
all the time, having no heart to fight for the
rebellion.

Col. Root of the Gath New York Re-

which transpired after the battle of Fred
ericksburg:


During Monday afternoon | revisited the
scene of Saturdays charge, in order to make
arrangements for burying the dead, and on ar
irving on the skirmishing line, l observed a
rebel officer near the woods, who cordially re-
sponded to friendly wave ofmy handkerchief
and was kind enough to keep his skirmishers
quiet while looked around the field for my
dead. Subsequently he came out, shook hands
and compared notes. He was a Captain of the
Twentieth North Carolina Regiment, and, dur
ing the conversation, stated that the Twenty
third North Carolina had been nearly annihi-
lated by charge on Saturday. On being in
formed that my Brigade had made the charge,
he anxiOusly inquired after several of his broth
er officers whom we had captured, and was
gratitied at being able to assure him of their
safety. saw number of familiar faces among
the dead, for two officers and fifty men of my
brigade Law there, men that l had drilled, in

OF the adjoining houses of MIR. John F. Ellis

premises with water, thereby seriously DANA
ging the buildings and furniture, particularly
the property of Messrs. Ward and Ellis In
one OF the rooms of Mr.. Wards building every-
thing was destroyed, including valuable
library belonging to Mr.. Orme and Mr. Wards

This Is the first fire that has taken place since
the passage OF the law prohibiting persons from
interfering with fremen and from obstructng

sion was carried out to the letter. The police

promise 10 yacate the premises within two
weeks. An officer is posted ar the house to pre-
vent their receiving visitors in the meantime.
The inmates claim that there are three families
IN the house, who all rent from Mrs. Wilkinson,
and are entirely distinct from her family. Jus
tiCe Ferguson held Mrs. Wilkinson to bail for

REPORTS FROM vICKsBCRa.
From the Jackson Appeal, 1lth
A gentleman from Grand Gulf yesterday,
Sunday morning for about two hours, in tho
vicinity OF New Carthage. We have been
looking for news OF this character for some
days, and are now quite anxious to know the
result. If we mistake not, some Of the gallant
Missourians, under General Bowen, were in
the fight.


A Yankee expedition. foraging and hunting
negroes, visited Richmond, La, last week, and
while there gobbled up everything within
reach We hear that they killed Phil Sartori-
GUS, of Milliken's Bend, while in Richmond.
They carried OF negroes from every plantation
where they were to be found.


THE YANKEES ON THR MOVE.
The Yankees who have been in camp on the
peninsula for the last six or seven weeks were
to and fro ali day, and every tent in Whites
field, with the exception OF a few on the le wee,
was struck and carried away. Four large
transports, loaded with troops, departed during
the day, and others appeared TO be preparing
to start. Those troops are, no doubt, destined
to reinforce the Yazoo Pass expedition, where
such strenuous efforts are to be made for our
anRihilation.


The garrulous Yankees have got up a new
'rig' TOR facilitating their circum foranean tour
in the direction OF Vicksburg. The project, it
is announced, abounds with the promise OF
fayorabls results. The levee below the Yazoo
Pass is being cut fer the distance Of mile
down the river with the hope of turning q
body of water through that will completely
inundate the whole Yazoo and Tallahatchie
valleys. We do not think that they will sue
ceed in washing out Fort Pemberton by this
new move, or check TiJghman, whom they re-
port to be erecting a battery at the conflue
of the little TalIahatChie with Coldwa Like
all the others, this will, in the end, prove an
aDortive scheme.


The Yankees sent down another ""turreted
monster"" on Saturday night, with the hope OF
causing US to expend vast quantity Of ammu-
milton in endeavoring to destroy the Quaker
craft. But they were disappointed this time.
Their risibles were not excited in the least as
nothing could be heard to break the stiffness of
the night, save the firing Of the pickets to an =.
nounce that something resembling boat was
floating down. Sergeant Lynch examined the
monster weil, and finding it to be small house
erected on the logs to resemble a gunboat, witt
two wooden chimneys, he gave the proper sig
nal, and 1t was permitted to pass on unmoleted."

Advces from Greenwood, Mississippi, re-
ceiyed up to Monday morning. the l6h On
Saturday, the l4th and Sunday, the 9th, the |
Chillacothe kept up caunonade. The rebel
battery is so situated that the rear cannot be
|assailed, on account of the high water. The
gums were taken of the De kalb and battery
Constructed on laud, within a short distance of
the rebel works, which was intended to assist
the gunb0ats in reducing that place. The
rebel force at Greenwood was estimated at six
thousand. When our fleet passes that point,
there is no obstruction until it reaches Iaz1o
City, where the rebels are said to be strongly
fortified, The damage to the Chilhcothe was
not so great as previously reported.


Affairs at Lake Providence are entirely at

besides the inmates of the house, who are
known as Runy Anna, Maggie Mitchell, Willie
johnson, Lizzie Cummings, Mary Jones, and
Cornelia Rollins, who were all taken TO the
STATEN house, the house being left in charge
of an officer. About one o'clock the mistress
of the house-Anna Wilson-made her ap-
pearance, and, seeing the condition of things,
was thrown into such violent spasms that DIR.
Hodges was sent for, and one OF the girls de-
tailed to attend to her; an officer being left IN
charge of the house until she sufficiently re
covers to 1stand her trial the charge of
keeping disorderly house.


This morning all the above mentioned girls
excepting ARna Wilson and Cornelia Rollins,
were sent to the workhouse tor ninety days,
but before leaving, they gave those at the
station specimen of their vocabulary in the
wav ofhard and protracted swearing. The poet
sswho would as soon expect a bullet from a
rose bud oath from the mouth of n wo-
man. would have experienced a sad shock to
his sensibilities in the foul oaths of this party
of fallen angels. The citizen arrested, who
gives the name of George W Briggs, and saws
he is from New York, and who, ii is said is the
agent or runner for the establishments was
taken to the office of the Superintendent and
ordered 10 leave town to-day, which he
promised to do.


Sergeant Clark deserves the thanks of the COM
munlty for the manner in which he carried out
the orders of the Superintendent, and il is to
be hoped that the house Will now be perma-
nently closed. On a former occasion, all the
inmates were arrested and ordered to leave
y
OF the house again, and almost daily have the
police had 10 go there to preserve the peace
This is the first house OF the kind ever kept on
the Navy Yard on extensive scale, and has
been, during its short existence the means of
leading many young men who have hitherto
borne good characters, astray. The order for
the descent was given on the written applca-
lion OF some OF the neighhers.


REPORTED DISCOVERY or. TREAsuRR-It is
reported that the workmen tearing down an
old house on Bridge street, Georgetown, above
High street, few days since came across an
iron box between the flooring near the CHM
neys, which was at once removed by the pur-
chaser of the property, Mr.. Peter Dill, w no on
taking it to his home and opening it, discoy-
cred it TO be filled with gold coin of very old
date, amounting to eighteen thousand dollars
The premises in question Were occupied years
ago, it is said, by miserly merchant, at whose
death little property was found, although he
was reputed 10 have been rich.


We give the story for what it is worth, aud
as clue for SylSanus Cobb or the New York
Mercury man TO follow out. BY the way, the
Mercury has flaming ghost story in its last
issue, located in an old mansion (of course) on
Sixteenth street, south of the White House.
There happens to be no Sixteenth street south
of the Presidents House, a topoera phical fact
of which the mystery -monger of the Mercury
was doubtless unaware. But it's of no conse-
quence.

SELLING MALT LIoUoHs TO SoLpIERs-
There seems to be a misunderstanding among
the lager beer and ale saloon keepers of the citv
III relation to the recent orders of the Provost
Marshal with reference to the sale of liquor To
soldiers. Many OF the saloon keepers supposed
the sale of ale and beer was not prohibited
Gen Nartindale has, however, left no room for
doubt AS to the intents of the order by explain
ing that 1t having been decided that ale and
beer are intoxicating, the sale of the latter 10
soldiers ls prohibited as Well as whisky or other
spirituous liquors.

From Gen. Rosecrans' dis patches it appears that the heavy fighting of Friday, in which the rebels were so terribly worsted, was sufficient to satisfy them that they had no hope of success. A heavy storm pre- vailed during Saturday making it difficult to manauvre large bodies of troops, and nothing more than skirmishing took place. On Sunday morning early it was discovered that the rebels had retreated during the night and soon after ward brigade of our forces under Gen. Stan ley. entered Murfreesboro. No general pursuit however was commenced until Sunday evening the day being spent in preparations for the movement in br nging in the dead and in dis tributing ammunition and subsistence. The Centre Grand Division was the first to start and was followed with due promptness by the two others. The losses on our side, considering the length of time and the persistency with which the lighting continued before Murfreesporo, are much lighter than might he expected. Gen. Rosecrans' Medical Director estimates the num- Der of wounded in hospital at about $500, and the killed at l.O0O These figures are consider ably less than those of fAntietam or Fredericks- burgh.

 The news from Vicksburgh is also everything we could desire. It is to Monday evening of las. week, at which time Gen. Sherman after fighting five days, commencing Oil the previous ""Wednesday, had carried three lines of the enc my's works, and the firing on the fourth and last line had ceased indicating that it also had been captured. This was ou the Jackson and Vicksburg Railroad, two miles from the city, and all that lay between Gen Sherman and the city was the trestle-work of the road, He had been reinforced on Sunday night by g 900 men from Gen. Grants army and had a force of for ty thousand men. At last accounts we had cap tured ten guns and seven hundred prisoners. N othing has been heard from the forces below, but it is sufficiently evident that their cooper would not be needed in reducing the rebel strong hold.

 WE HAVE very important news from East Tennessee. The Lynchburg Republicam of Thursday states that body of 5000 Union cavalry, composed of one Pennsylvania regi- ment and others unknown, have destroyed nine miles of the East Tennessee and Virginia Rail- road, burning the important bridges over the Holston and Watawga Rivers, and capturing 200 Rebel c valry who were guarding the for mer. The Republican says it will take several weeks to repair the damages. at time when the road is taxed to its utmost capacity. It charac- terizes the Yankee raid of nearly q hundred miles as one of unexpected daring and activity.

 ADv1cEs from General Blunt state that he oc cupied Van Buren, the rebels having retreated on Tuesday night towards Arkadelphia, aban- doning their wounded at Fort Smith. Our troops in the Indian Territory have driven the rebels under Coffee and Stewart across the Ar kansas at Fort Gibson The Indians are aAx- ious to re-estabish their loyal status. Hind mans correspondence was captured at Van Bp- re . His amy is wretchedly destitute.

 IT is stated that at the battle of Fredericks- burg the rebels so far exhausted their ammuni- tion that they were compelled to fire bars of iron and stones from t&eir cannon. Perhaps it was a suspicion of this fact that partly deter mined Burnside to attack the next day, but he subordinated his convictions to the opinions of his officers, and perhaps thereby lost golden opportunity to achieve glorious victory.

 There seems to have been great destruction of Government property at Island No. 10, causelessly and uselessy. The facts as ~a, have them, are these; Gen. Davies, understand ing it to be part of rebel policy to take Island No. 10, and thus cut off river transportation and fearing they might be successful, sent an order to the commanding officer to spike his guns. destroy his ammunition and evacuate the place. This order was not Sexecuted. Davies then sent another order to his Adjutant to see that it was executed, and seventy nine guns were spiked last Monday, and about 10000 rounds of ammunition rolled into the river The l50 men on the Island protested, but the order was executed.

 The defeat of the rebel Gen. Forrest, already spoken of ip Gen. Grants dispatches to the Department, appears to have been very severe one. The fight took. place on the west side of the Tennessee River, at Hunts Cross Roads, twelve miles from Lexington, Tenn. The rebels are said to have lost l 400 men. killed and wounded, and 400 taken prisoners, besides battery of six guns and nearly thou sand stand of arms.

 Late advices from New Orleans represent that the preparations for the movement up the river were making with the greatest energy, and it was expected that the advance would com mence about Jan. 5.

make now a fair start 10 the right direction.
They should cease to hide their light under a
busbel, but through the papers, let it 50 shine
that ell may know what they wish TO do for
the good of their fellows. Many men from
small beginnings, by judicious advertising
have acquired great wealth and influence.
while others, by n contrary course, have sunk
q fair capital before they became known to the
community in which they have gone 10 sleep
the moth and dust consuming their undisturb-
ed wares. The DENocRAr has larger circu
- latiOn in Fl Dorado county ibAn any other
paper, and is therefore the best advertising
medium for all who Wish TO make their busi-
ness known 10 our people. II is true that,
owing to the usurpations Of despOtism, and the
disregard Of postmasters TO their oath Of Office
but to no fault of ours-our paper at present
cannot be circulated abroad but that dues
not initiate against its efficiency an advertis-
ing medium, for our traders and mechanics do
not expect to do business in San Francisco, nor
to end their customers 10 San Diego-but here
in Placerville and El Dorado county, where
erybody who has dollar and whose custom
is worth gaining, reads the DEMocRAr, AID if
be does not take it, nips 1t from his neighbor.


Nor YEr.-Lest unsophistica,cd people who
have seen the postmaster's boast Of having
robbed the mails of the MoUNrAIx DEMocRAr,
should fear to send greenbacks or checks by
post, we feel it our duty To state that ten
dullar piece, forwarded to us from Virginia
City by mail, has safely come to hand. We do
not believe that Mr.. Rogers would steal a bank
note or . check yet, but when soul is once
launched on the sea of crime there is no telling
how long voyage may be necessary to bring
it into port.


DoS'F LlEE i've learn that many of the
residents on COloma aud Bee streets don't like
the idea Of being taxed at present in accord.
ance with the provisions Of City Ordinance No.
l4s, and intend to present a remonstrance
against the Ordinance to the Common Council
There are q few property holders on those
streets, who will be greatly benefited BY the
proposed improvements, while none will be
damaged except in the amount of the tax paid.
Should not oil good citizens be willing to give
. neghbor lift!


MUDDY.-Since the heavy rain of Tuesday,
our streets have been visited BY our old but by
no means welcome acquaintance, mud. The
crossings on Main street, however, can still be
found by diving. Should any of our friends
wish il, they can doubtless procure subm arine
armor In San Francisco which would effectuaI.
ly prevent their drowning while attem ptipg to
find the crossings.


FIREMAN has so well answered the veto ot
the ordinance providing a salary for the Chief
Engineer, that we are content to let the mat
ter rest for the present at least. See his COM
municAtiOn in another column.


OK our first page will be found brief
sketch Of the atrocities perpetrated on the Is.
land Of st. Domingo during the servile Insur-
rection there. Let those who indorse Lincoln
invitation to the negroes of the South to in
augurate similar scenes, read and reflect upon
It. II may open their eyes to the horid conse.
queuces Of their favorite policy and soften
their hearts to better feeling towards that
unhappy portion of our common country.


TIE LUNCH spread out at the Greyhound, ev-
cry evening, attracts . crowd of visitors to
that popular sOloOu. Black is certainly sue.
ceseful caterer II one may judge by the number
OF his patrons, who, IL massed iu body, would
be sufficient for grand corps de armee. The
slight brigade"" does not belong to his corps

settled that the rebels are falling back to-
ward the Rapidan as our army offers them
battle by advancing. Construction trains
have run as far as Bristow Station to-day,
and tomorrow supply trains will run to or
beyond that point. The trestle bridge at
Bristow was burned by the rebels, and the
track between Manassas and Catlett'g Sta
ton was almost wholly torn up by them
The slight skirmishing to-day does not in
dicate that general engagement is probable,
and the campaign, except the pursuit of the
fleeing rebels, may be considered closed.


Washington, 10Th. Yesterday Whites
and Moseby's guerrillas, numbering about a
thousand men, came down from Aldie and
Chantilly, and taking the Frying Pan road,
succeeded in getting between our army and
the defenses. One gang cams within q mile
of Chain Bridge, and fred into the rifle pits
of one of our forts. Several officers were
captured, together with six men of the Thir-
teenth New York cavalry, and number of
wagons. Our cavalry were sent in pursuit
of them A brisk fight ensued in which the
rebels were defeated and driven with con
siderable loss.


The military authorities here have not
reached any positive conclusion as to either
the strength or position of Lees army. Our
cavalry find the enemy in every direction, but
their main body has been effectually concealed
One opinion entertained is that Lee has re-
tired behind Bull Run Mountain, and is fall
ing back toward an intrenched position on
the Rapidan; but by some of the most ex-
perienced officers here it is believed the prin-
cipal part of his infantry has been sent in
the direction of Harper's Ferry and Win
chester, with view to covering and support
ing another extensive raid into Maryland
and Pennsylvania.


In the Field October. 10Th. Yesterday
reconnaissance was made by Colonel Chap
man, with a portion of the First Brigade of
Buford'e cavalry division, visited Chaptilly,
Aldie and Drainsvile, without discovering
the enemy. 1t was discovered that Stuart
with his cavalry, had passed the dag before
in the direction of Aldie, and yesterday to-
ward Leesburg. 1t is believed he is en- rout
for Maryland.


1t is ascertained this morning that the
rebels are building fires along the line of the
railroad track from Manassas toward the
Rappahanneck, thus destroying the rails
and rendering the road unfit for use, and also
destroying all bridges along the route. 1t is
almost conclusive that this movement of Lees
is ruse to deceive Meade by leading him
astray-a feint made on large scale-while
the real design has been to keep him from ad-
xancing his forces, the rebels in the meantime
hurying reinforcements to Bragg.


Washington, l9th-There is no truth in
the statement that General Mead's army is
within the defenses of Washington. There
are as yet no tidings of the whereabouts of
Lees army Such dispositions have been
made by our army as will meet all conting gem
.cies


Washington. 20th.-The Richmond Sem
tinel of October 18th says We understand
chat in consequence of the action of the Brit
ish Consuls in regard to tie foreigners en-
listed in the Confederate service. the Presi.
dent has felt is his duty to dismiss all ofthem
from the Coufederaey.


New York, October 29th.-The Tribune
has the following important announcement
in its editorial columns - We understand.

upon authority from Washington which we
deem trustworthy, that General Rosecrans is
about to be removed from the command of
the Army of the Cumberland His success
sor is not yet named"" 1t is strange that
no reason is assigned for this reported remov.
.al-whether for transfer to another command
or otherwise. EDS. UNION


Fortress Monroe, October lSth.-The Rich
mond papers have the following:


A sharp correspendenee betEeen Meredith
and Ould, Commissioners for the exchange
of prisoners, is published, from which it ap-
pears that there is wide difference of opin-
ion in regard to the number of prisoners with
which each should be credited, and that all
arrangements for the present are knocked in
the head


Charleston, October l5th.-The firing from
our batteries continues-the Federals making
no reply, but continued to work. An addi.
.tional number of transports are reported at
Folly Inlet.


The Richmond papera also contain Chal-
mer's report of the fight at Collierville, in
which he claims to have burned the Federal
camp, with considerable stores and number
of wagons, and to have captured five colors
and over hundred prisoners. He acknowl-
edges a loss of fifty killed and wounded.


Lynchburg Va, October 16th-Twenty

uent playing Hall to the thicf."" The troops
were then wheeled Into line by companies and pre-
ceded by the band marched In review before Gen.
Casey, who, after reviewing them, tried them
some ON drill himself, upon the conclusion OF
which he expressed himself greatly pleased and
coupIimented the men on their neat and solderly
appearance.


The REGIMENT 10 now nearly full, having, as we
said before, over eight hundred men. Col. Fellows
expects soon 10 receive marching orders, which
will probably be to Morris Island, where the frat
company Of his regiment 10 stationed. A very
large number Of spectators were present yesterday,
although no public announcement had been made.
Among tho quests we noticed Col Wilson, Of the
Fourteenth New Hampshire volunteers, now sta
TONED In this city. Tho Colonel seoms to take
great interest In this regiment and yesterday very
kindly loaned his band for the review, and also
sometime since ordered the fife and drum majorso Of
the Fourteenth TO report 10 Col Fellows to assist
In forming drum corps for the colorcd troops.
They have succeeded In forming from the raw ma
tsrial q drum corps OF negroes which will with
practice become . most excellent one. Alter re-
view dress parade WAS had and the troops dis
missed, and the spectators left, all doubt satis-
fed that the Second U. s. colorcd troops, with COL
4 Fellows at their head, will make good report.

I Clayton of the Sixth Kansas, after five hours hard fighting, put to flight 4,000 of the enc: my under Gen. Marmaduke. Our loss was U killed and 3s wounded, and l nissing. The enemy 5 loss was 53 killed, l64 wounded, and ss prisoners. A few days before, Col. Clay ton took $50 men and pieces of light arsille- ry' and, by making circuitous route, and narchibg se miles in s5 hours, succeeded in surprising and completely routing Col. Dob bfns cavalry brigade at Tulip, capturing one stand Of coIors, all his camp and garrison equpage, quartcrmaster and commissary stores, medical supplies, transportation. &c.

 Richmond papers have the following items 1: There are s4 Yankee surgeons in Libby Pris. on; 2,l00 prisoners have been sent to Dan. vile, others are to be sent to Lynchburg; 25 Yankee deserters made their escape from Cas- tie Thunder few days ago; two were recap tured. A warehouse at Wilmington was burnt on the l4th, containing large amount q cotton and clothing. ,v xesas #

 Some excitement was astir on Saturday along the Canada border, near Rouses Point (Lake Champlain,) by rumor that force oe Rebels was coming to take Fort Montgomery, destroy the drawbridge. and plunder Pla.ts- burg and Burlington. Immediate steps were taken to give the rascals warm reception, but they did not come. ''s F

 Ore swindlng contractor has got his de serts. John K. stelIer for stetter,) who un. dertook to furnish pure coffee for army use, failed in furnishing the stipulated quantity and adullcra,ed that which he did furnish He was tried by Court Martial, and is sentenced to live years sojourn in State Prison.

 A lettet from New Orleans, the l4,h, states that heavy reinforcsnents were on the way to join Gen. Dana. and that |"" the complete sue cess of the Texas expedition is topic of heart felt interest and joy with loyal men. The Tex. ans seem to have been completely taken by surprise. Two efficient batteries at the head of Brazos Pass would doubtless have caused us great annoyance, if nut have rendered nec, essary a letreat q la Sabine. That General Banks will realize to the utmost limit the ben e6ts of the expedition, is apparent.

 It is said that the parties depredating in the rear of our army, between the Rappahannock and the Potomac, are composed of deserters from the Union army, who waylay and rot travellers indiscriminately. but pay particuIa, attention to suffers, purveyors, and others who carry considerable sums of money.

 On Sunday morning the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher preached his first sermon since hi: return from Europe in his church. The house w""s filled-the passage ways. even further than the speakers voice could be heard were crowded, and hundreds who did not arrive be fore the hour for service to begin were obliged to go away, unable to obtain admission.

 The Tribune knows that Grant has positive information that only thre, divisi ,ns of rebel 1 troops have advanced upon East Tennessee numbering in all about I5,000; and that Burn sides command is double that number, though a large portion of it is mounted.

 THE TEXAS EXPEDITION On the 9th inst Gen. Banks headquarters were at Brownsville IeNas. The 94lh Illinois raised their flag in fap ~ 4I. l the 5th, Gen. Banks and staff arriving soon l thereafter. Stx other regiments hal reached Townsville. Previous to the occupation of Brownsville there had been free fight in the | streets between Union men and rebel sympa sizers. The Union refugees in Matamoras crossed over and joined in, and afser the burn ng of great portion of Brownsville. the Un. ii men wore left in vet ,rious possession.

 The Norwich Bulletin says an officer in command of one of the nine months regiment: once instructed his subordinates 10 obey n, orders that did not e,naciate from these head quarters"" Bad as, ""haw round that mud puddle."" ......

 The vote in the last election in New Jersey shows the falling of of 5000 as compared with the vote of 1862.

 Notwithstanding coal is SO high in price. th. production of the Pennsylvania mines for the past year is said to be l,700,e tons great CT than the previous year. @ '~

 Recruiting is going on at Springfield, Ill Y, at the rate of 100 to l50 per day.

 The cost of the recent ball to the Russians, at New York, is figured up at near million and a half of dollars. Possibly the estimate will admit ofa few fractional deductions. but shoddy does not stick at triaes on such occa- | sions. -.s ..A..... .,.. Jefferson Davis said at the beginning of the war, All the Southern blood that will be shed in this war 1 can hold in the hollow of my hand"" Jefferson is described as exceedingly hollow-eyed. We presume he will not say now that the Southern blood that had been shed is all in his eye""

7_1863-01-02_p2_sn83016025_00279525152_1863010201_0634,The Portland daily press.,01,1863-01-02,p2,,,"The proclamation against Gen. Butler and
his officers is of piece with the previous pol
icy of the President of the Southern Conspira-
cy. Once and again already had the same ru;-
fanly, cowardly threats been aimed at our
Generals, and the new demonstration has taken
nobody by surprise. Charges of inhumanity
and of disregard for the usages Of civilized war
fare cannot lie against the Government or the
army of the UnitedStates. The error, if any,
{ has been Of a quite opposite character-though
God forbid that we should carp at the ior-
bearance, which more than any other quality
marks moral and material strength. DIR. Rus
sell, with most honor ablee quanimity, though
fattered at the South and curtly dismissed at
the North, has come forward publicly to deny
these allegations of nhumanity on the part of
Northern commanders. The world is easily
deceived, but this slander is too preposterous
for belief.


But grant what every fair mind knows or
may know to be untrue-that Generals Pope,
Mcneil and Butler have been guilty of the
outrages charged in these rantipoe proclama-
tions, and what follows? This: Mr.. Davis, in
the true spirit of Southern institutions and
manners, proposes to put down violence by
lynch-law, that is by more violence. The
world will not sustain him; he.powerful Gov
ernment Of this nation, with name and fame
to keep untarnished, will not descend to shame
full reprsals or the impudent order demand
ing the surrender of Gen. Mcneil as an alter
native to the execution of ten United States
officers, the London News says, assuming
Gen. McNeis guilt


!. We are told that it is natural that Mr.. Davis
should issue such an order. II is the assump-
Government neither wiser nor better than the
man whose acts they justly stigmatize; but not 9TH
erwse. We oJserre irifhoat surprise that srriters
uho foremost in deRouRcing the horrors Qf this
soar hace not cord 20 against This sang,nary
order.


Against it. On this side the Atlantic they
are not merely silent. Here they dare to
raise their voices openly in defense of a proc
lamation which is false in its premises, and un-
justifable In its conclusions even if the pre-
misses we're true, and prate of its ""provocations
and Justification"" and of its influence for good
or for eyil,' as if there were any alternative,
and as if the document and its author, and
his abettors North and South were not evil
only and that continually. 1t is long since
any state paper from Washington has been
welcomed in language 50 warm as that which
we copy from yesterdays Advertiser:


The proclamation of Jefferson Davis, which we
publish in full this morning, will constitute one nf
the great pages ysor "" eCH IN the history
of the rebellion AS such, place it record II is
not an aaarftuni measure, nor strange doctrine
for the Confederate Government TO put forth II
claims TO be judged of God and history, upon its
prorocafioa and Justification.


Win the reader look once more at the words
we have talicised in this remarkable passage?
It is thus that the Advertiser begins the new
year."

togetEer anG the result was an immediate
nomination of Mr.. T. B. Brown Tor chairman
ara III. John L. Clements, il. as secretary OF
the meeting.


The Chair stated the object of the rneatipo.
after which, whispered consultation took
place between tn e Chair, Gov Bebb Clements
ana East1nan and it being discovered that no
resolutions had been prepared, DIR. Clements
moved the appointments OF . committee to Dire II

appointed Messrs. a. hi. Swami, of III, ex

Inefs seemed TO be no help for it, and SO the
1hair trotted out Mr.. Bebb. who undertook to

we viii say that The Stars report of fis words
used on that occasion is identical with that OF

Must we be u.pelled TO pronounce Shibbo-

dictate, or as he rronouaees it! Mr. Dixon
and Mr.. Richards, the speaker said, were both
good Jnion,nen but the former was found in
bad company.


Dir. keliy.-ssIs not Mr. Dixon in favor OF
the Repu biCin party -


Nr. Bebb said that might be, but there We're
many bad men in that party. OF Mr. Dixon
himself he had rot word to say He is a per
fectly loyal man he believed.


mr. Bebb further argued that 9 residence
here as all that was necessary 10 entirle a
man to vote. and said that any man who
would draw distinction between a mere resi-
dent AID a native born, was Us narrow minded
bigot, as he Know Nothings were.


At the conclusion Of Mr.. Bebb's address the
committee reported resolutions reaffirming
their of.votion and loyalty TO the Union and
the administration, ana pledgiag themselves to
support the Richards ticket.


Speeches were then delivered by Hon. L. E
Chittenden and Rev. N. NJ. Gaylord, neither of
whom in the least questioned the loyalty of

the silly allegation that persons Of doubtful
loyalty would be found supporting them.


Calls Were subsequently made tor Dir. Rich.

but neither OF these gentlemen responded: and
the meeting having low dwindled down to
some fifty persons adjourned.

Metropolitan Police stationed in Georgetown
was passed last evening by the Common Coun-
Gil, but not without considerable opposition.
1t was argued by Mr.. Marbury that the Ooun-
ell had not the right to spend the peoples
money in paying the debts OF Uncle Sam, and
that if the present police were to resign there
would be 100 applicants for their positions be-
fore three days, and also that the Corporation
could not afford such an expenditure in addi-
ton to the many other additional expenses OF
building a new market. house, &c.

favor Of the measure, and thought it true econ

saved or made for the Corporation large
amounts by strictly enforcing the laws of the

fines than usual and that the people were now
compelled to pay their licenses to do business,

ton offered in the sen~te Of Virginia


the other day, by Mr.. Newman, to


the effect ""of suspendirg interest on

on the production Of satisfactory


proof that the party owning such

Confederate notes in payment Of the


same, accompanied with satisfactory


evidences that the same has been
refused by the holder Of any such
bond or claim"" This, says the
Lynchburg Virginian, would go far


toward reconciiing the shavers and
money hawks to a necessity they
may not escape, Of all the means


that cou!d be employed te depTccsa1e

hopes Of our republic, the refusal to
receive Confederate money in pay
,nent Of debts. or in exchange for pro-
perry Of any kind, seems to US the
most eif;ectual. Carried out in prac-
,ice, it would be Il death blow to our
hopes. The valor Of cur soldiers, or
any other means upon which we


mis ht base our hopes of independence


would not avail, if the very sinews
Of the war was gone. Let it te known

PENDENCE.- of the most remarkable cir.
cumstances attending the fortunes ofthe sign
ers of Declaration of Independence, was the
tranquility in which their after lives were
passed, and the late period to which they
were protracted. A writer in a Northern
journal says:


Most of the signers of the Declaration of
American Independence lived to good old
age, crowned with civil honors bestowed by
the gratitude of the republic. and some of
them perished by mere decay of the powers
Of nature. Of the fifty six who liked their
signatures to that document. twenty seven
lived to an age exceeding seventy years. and
forty to an age of sixty. Only two of the
duel in his 18th year, and Lynch, of South
Carolina. who was shipwrecked in his Goth
died violent death. Twenty one lived to the
beginning of the present century and three
were permitted to see the great experiment
of representative Confederacy confirmed by
the events of fifty years. Of all the delegates
from New York and New England, only one
(Whipple, of New Hampshire) died at an
earlier age than sixty. Never in the world
had the leaders in any bold and grand polit-
ical movement more reason to congratulate
themselves and the country on the issue. The
exertioLs and perils of their manhood were
succeeded by peaceful, honored and ripe old
age. in which they witnessed the happy re-
suit of the institutions they had aided in devils.
ing, and they were gathered to their graves
amid the regrets of the generation which was
in its cradle when they laid the foundations
of the republic."

THE SITUATION.",,"The latest news from Charleston, to eight
O'Clock P. NJ of the 10th instant, by the steamer
Admiral Dupont reports that the firing on Fort
Sumter continues without intermission that the
Gag of the rebel garrison has been shot down
several times within few days, but is always
hoisted again. The immediate surrender of the
fort is predicted as, indeed, it has been for seve
tal months past. We anxiously awais the intclli.
genoe of its fall.


By the steamship Creole, from New Orleans, on
Che llth inst, we have intelligence of the opera
lions of Genral Washburnes forces in the Teche
country. The reports from there state that Wash
burne's whole loss In killed and wounded and
taken prisoners was six hundred and seventy
seven The Indiana Sixty-seventh was captured
almost entire. The Sixtieth Indiana and Ninety
sixth Ohio lost largely. The rebel force outnunl-
bered ours Ave to one. We only excelled them in
artillery, by means Of which, at short range it is
thought we killed a large number Of the enemy.

THE NEW YoRK RIOTS.",,"


tells US that the political riots in the great
metropolis have been overpvwered and subdued.
Everybody IL pleased, no doubt with this news,
for many humane reasons. IF the civil war was
over altogether. we would all rejoice. In the
suppression of ! mob by the free use of gunpow-
der and grape, there are unfortunately always
more innocent ""lookers-on"" killed than guilty
participants. Hence the great discretion which
military commanders should exercise in the dis
charge of their duties. In such cases strategy""
could be exercised with equal opportunity for
commentator und praise to that afforded ON the
tented field II seems by such news AS we have
received (Which is meagrr) that both strategy and
force have been applied to the rioters. While
grape shot have moved down the men, women
and children, Gov. Seymour and his friends have
soothed the terbulent thousands by suggestnga
means by which every mau drafted in the city

Of wise heads, have hit upon this happy expedient
to appease the deadly anger oil the poor people

of the discussion in Congress. down to the hour
of these troubles. that the Conscription Act was
partial. That it Disseminated in favor Of the
wealthy, and against those in ordinary circumstan-
ces of life. That when the Federal enrolling

himself for duty. with not Il scintila of hope for

City Council a local amendment to the act is
virtually adopted. The Common Council says to

no exemption from labor at the pumps. rich

as substitute while he dozcs in his cabin. Far
from it. He is the first man at the pump to save
himself by his own cXrrions. Democrats are not
agraran. but they are always in favor of equal
rights and Justice The rich of the North have
more in the issue Of this war than the poor man
who only holds life in his hands The opulent
have lives and fortunes If the Conederates
should succeed, which though possible does not
look probable at this time, perhaps the entire
det of both Republics would seek the rich
mans bank at the North, for liquidation! The
quicker the war is over the more beneficial to the
rch-bccause the S. 900 600 day must be pro-
vided for-tbe interest on q debt Of hundreds OF
millors must he paid. 1t stands there. IN eu-
cidated fact that the Conscription Act, us it
exists. is at least unjust rs we'll rs unwise. Let
us illnstrate-partially in Uncle Abe's style of
State papers. suppose perSOn1l SeulCn Tor
stolen coin is proposed on board Il steamer, and
all consent to the humiliation but the rich?
Does any body believe that the deck hands the
coal beavers. the engineer and deck passeng gers
would yield to such discrimination? They
would do no such thing. Their honor, in this
case, stands precisely where the lives Of this
class pertain in the case of war The poor man
generally, has more real patriotism love of coun-
try. and attachment 10 life, than the rich. AS an
ncentv. to respect from all classes, he exercises
and cultivates virtue and religion. The rich. too
often demand and acquire respect for S. 8. d. Let
the world then be not too harsh in denouncing
the rioters of New York. Bishop Hughes gives
them credit for honesty when in his address he
tells them to desst and not fly from supposed
grievances to greater crime. This was wise
counsel and probably had more effect towards
their riotous proceedings than all the
grape of the military.


DEMOCRATIC COUNTY CONVENTION.


The adjourned County Convention met yester
day and nude full nominations. 1t being admit
ted by all PARTIES that the Democrats in this
Federal -Whig- Know Nothing county are in q
small minority, there was not many seeking nom

incentive to action, a very good ticket was nomi-
mated. The two Senators, Messrs. Nichols and
Manlove are superior selections and stand a good
show to beat that preaching Republican. Benton,
from Folsom and the sycophant Heacock. from
this city. Both these Democratic nominees have
held high positions Manlove, Sheriff. and Mich.

They had to come by way ot Suffolk At that point they found they had to be search~ ed, and the person to examine the'r clothing was vile old hag, who took every opportunity of insulting them. This old vixen IS Mrs. Brown, the wife of old John Brown, who was hung in Virginia. Even in such small matters as the appointment of female inspectors, Lin col..show his malicious meanness.

 - Gen. F. Kirby Smith, hes returned to Richmond. Magruder is doing 80 well in, Tex as, that Smith did not want to interfere with his command ~

 - Rosencrans is a native of Randolph county, Virginia. Buell. was born in Florida. McClellan's father was a Scotchman, and for a long time, professor of surgery in the medical college at Philadelphia. Whether Mcclellan was born in Scotland or in Pennsylvania, we do not know. Tie North has not produced a great general.

 - Paper is very high priced at the North, as cotton and cotton goods are also. High prices are paid for rags and materials out of which to make paper. A patriotic Yankee lately conceived of plan by which oturn many a penny. He formed himself into a committee and opebed offices all over the country, calling upon the charitable. to furnish him with old linen, lint bandages and cloths for the hospit~ als. These he was to send to the different hos~ pftals and battle fields. When he had collect ed several tons he baed them took them to the paper mills at Dalton, Mass, and sold them.

 All the wood yards on the Mississippi river between Memphis and Vicksburg have been destroyed The enemy have to carry coal bar ges with them. The boats often go to the shore and send parties out to cut wood. Our par tsans should watch these wood~chopPers and serve writ of tresspass on them.

 - Liverpool salt sold in Savannah, in January for fifty dollars a sack. It sold in Lynchburg, Va, for twenty cents a pound.

 - The Harriet Lane, captured at Calves ton, is vessel of six hundred tons burthen She mounted eight guns of heavy calibre.

 - w. l.. Yancey's son was not killed at the battle of Murfreesboro.

 - The Florida, formerly the Ovieta, com manded by Capt. Mafit ran in and ont of Mo bile last December. Early in January she over weston and after running fight of half an hour sunk the latter. One icer and five of the crew of the Hatteras were in a boat and escap ed, but the rest are supposed to have gone un der The Hatteras had three riAed guns and four thirty two pounders. The northern paper+ of late date, claim that since then they have sunk the Florida and Lincoln has announced it officially, but no particulars are given, anC we are still in hopes that the Florida and her gallant crew are afoat.

 = The circulation of the Chicago Times has beensuppresscd everywhere within the lnes of the federal army. News agents are pro I hibited from selling it. The New York World will soon share a similar fate.

 - The seats of four of the' congressiena delegation from Missouri to Lincoln Congress will be contested. - Col Cameron, and Capt. M. NJ. Dufie of the 9th Ark, were wounded at Murlreesboro

 - The examing wench at Suffolk, is tn, widow of old John Brown, and at City Point is Mrs. Harlan, the wife of one of Lincoln senators, who does such dirty work for fifty dol lars a month.

 -- Thomas A. Hendricks, has been elect ed senator from Indiana, and W. A. Richard son, from Illinois. Both are anti Lncolnites - The Charleston Courier announces tn, expected arrival, in that city of Co.'s. O. Tard and K. Tawba They will be immediately ta ken in and done for.

 - Mir. w. J. McLaren, of the 22nd Texas writes us the substance of conversation h. had with some deserters from the federal army They tell same story of having their eyes open ed as to the character of the war and the per fidy of Lincoln. The deserters assured Me-. Laren that the reason why the feds left ou river was fear of mutiny among their men,

 - There is something in war, in the feel ings it excites and passions it arouses, favorable to the development of poetic talents. We judg so from the amount of original poetry we ar favored with. We have on hand, some twent or thirty poems, songs and pieces, goot bad and indifferent, some of which. we vii make room for. We have received a sonl F"" composed by two southern ladies, "" but do no believe it would sound as we'll in print as it would :. be if said or sung by the fair authoresses. |.

 - Correspondents must not be angry a the delay in the appearance, or non~appearanc of their productions. Our limits are smal and very many good articles are uEavoidabl crowded out.

Brown. Of Georgia, OF the stock Of bacon
(Which ID eaten morning, noon and nigh, by the
Southern people when they have ~ s'shows
the well nigh exhausted condition Of thai State;
and yet. beyond peradventure. Il is les nearly
exhausted than any other State in he con-
federacy""


Such is the testimony given in April last
by the rebel Commissary General of Bubsist-
ence touching the prospects Of Sou thsrn sub
sistence through the coming winter ana spring.
He presents dismal picture to the rebel gov
ernment, and the six months which have since
elapsed have only contributed to make it
darker and gloomier. Immense corn crops
were planted last spring on the rich alluvial
bottoms Of the YazOo and Big Black rivera In
Mississippi; but they have been devoured
or destroyed by the contending armies that
have desolated that State. The abundant
supplies Of wheat corn, beef cattle, sheep and
swine which last year were brought to tho
rebel armies east Of the Mississippi from Arksn-
sas, Western Louisiana and Texas are now,
and have been since last July, as completely
cut off a. If tho Mississippi were river Of
liquid fire. Tho army Of Bragg, which last
winter was subsisted from the crops and caltle
Of Tennessee, is now compelled to depend
upon the scanty supplies Of Georgia. The rebel
Army of Virginia is in the midst of desert,
and the demands of empty stomachs and naked
feet will largely account for the daring forays
Of rebel guerillas within the lines of General
Meade's plentifully supplied army:


The area upon which the armies Of JEFF
Davis east Of the Mississippi have now to de-
pend for their subsistence is limited to South
ern Virginia, North and South Carolina
Georgia and Alabama; and within these States,
in addition to their own fixed population, are
thousands OF rebel white emigrants, and hun
dreds Of thousands Of negro slaves, from Mis-
souri,, Arkansas Kentucky, Tennessee, Missis-
sippi and Louisiana, Northern Virginia and
Maryland, on account of the pressure of the
advancing fleets and armies of the Union The
consumers of food and clothing, whites and
blacks, thus added to the population proper of
Georgia and Alabama, would probably all
summed up, exceed two hundred thousand
souls. And when, in connection with all
these facts, we consider the wastages of the
rebel armies, their losses of production from
the loss of horses, and that, down to the out
break OF this rebellion, the cotton States, ex-
cepting tho articles OF ""hog and homminy""
and sweet potatoes, were almost entirely sup
piled with their provisions from Tennessee,
Kentucky and the great Northwest, it will not
be difficult to believe that the rebellion is on
the verge Of general and terrible famine.


II any further evidence were demanded to
satisfy the intelligent reader, we would refer
him to those unfortunate Union soldiers
who, as paroled prisoners. were recently
shipped to Annapolis from Richmond,
and who are dying by scores from
The effects Of starvation We would also refer
him to the starvation prices ruling in the rebel
capital. The public journals of that city and
Lynchburg are beginning broadly to hint that
he Union soldiers held as prisoners in those
swo cities are not worth 1.-THE of the scanty
allowance Of coarse food which is grudgingly
given them. We can hardly regard this mat
ter Of astonishment, when, according to the
Richmond Examiner Of the I'd instant, ""at an
early hour on Saturday morning the meat sup
plies at the city market gave out, and nume-
rous families in consequence had to dine OF
Grahamite dinners""


The simple truth is that the rebellion is
already beginning to feel the psDgs Of q famine,
md the winter has not yet set in. How is the
,oor barefooted rebel soldiers family to live
through it, when his months pay in rebel scrip
will only buy them two or three pounds Of
,acon and a few pounds of -four, or a peck or
wo Of corn meal? When the meat market at
Richmond, even at two or three dollars q
pound, is exhausted at can early hour in the
surely the time is at hand when ""the
Yankees"" under General Meade will be hailed
in that city as libsrating army. The facts we
have recited, at all events, are sufficient to
show the exhausted condition of the rebellion, =.
and that, if within the ensuing six months Of
consumption without production the rebellious
States are not subdued, the country will oeed
nothing further to prove the incompetency and
imbecility of President Lincoln's administra-
tion.


The CALL FOR VoLUNTEERs-The response
to the Presidents call for three hundred thou
sand volunteers is likely to be all that could be
wished, and it is not at all improbable that New
York State will be ahead Of all others in fur
nishing her quota. The .bounties offered are
most liberal. The veteran volunteer who has

ceived from Farragut's fleet on the Mississip-

Just arrived from Richmond, bringing sever
al southern papers. The Enquirer of March
10, commenting upon the peace resolutions
in the Confederate Congress, says it would
be much better for that body if it would at
tend to its business, that of 2abling the Pres.
ident to carry on the war The resolutions
propose the independence of the Confederate
States, the withdrawal of all troops frou,
Missouri, Maryland and Kentucky, leaving
the people free to decide which way they shall

High Prices and Legislative Prohibitions.


We observe that the South Carolina Lee
gislature is attempting very absurd and a
very impossible thing. 1t is attempting to
regulate the prices of marketable commo-
dities by legislative enactmen;s, Since
the war commenced we have observed very
closely the effect of all such legislation,
both on the part of the States and the on
federate authorities, and we have yet to
see a single instance in which the evil
which il was sought to.cure was not great
ly intensified. Some time last year the Gn-
vernon OF Georgia authorized the seizure of
all the salt in the hands Of SPECTATORS, and
prohibited its transportation from the State
under heavy penalties. We endorsed the
act, because we thought. without reflection,
that it would be OF service TO the people,
but it was just the reverse; the trade in
salt was broken up in Georgia, the article
became higher and scarcer, and the people
were the sufferers. The Provost Marshal
OF Richmond attempted TO fix the price Of
such articles as butter. eggs. poultry, beef,
&C., in that market, and the consequence
was that the hucksters refused to supply
the market at these prices. the people be-
came the sufferers. and the Provost Marshal
had to anna his arbitrary ordnance. For
a long time the Confederate authorities at
tempted TO 6r the price Of wheat. -four, su-
gar, provender. &C., purchased Tor the use
of the government.


The people would not sell at those prices,
speculation ceased. and the government had
10 resort To iulpressmenf for supplies. They
soon found that this was not only a system
ofpublic pIunder on the part Of The govern
ment, but that it failed to furnish them the
necessary supplies. The result was that
the absurdity Of making and controlling
prices was abandoned BY the government
authorities. and now they come INTO mar.
ket with the people upon terms ni fair cum
petition. We might aliude to numerous
other instances IN which State, corporation
and Confederate authorities, have attempt
ed 10 regulate and control the prIses OF ar
ticles Of consumption, but the seme inev-
the evil been vastly increased by the rene.
dy. And such IL The very nature Of things
viii infallibly be the result OF such arbitra-
ry and foolish Legislation.


The reason OF this i obvious upnn mo-
ment's reflection. Nine -tenths Of The peo.
pie have mistaken the cause Of high prices.
They seem TO think it Is some arbitrary
and tyranuical tariff Of charges fixed by
merciless set OF spectators and exiortion-
ers. Ifit were not for the spectators, sa,
they, prices of everything would rule law.
There never was a greater mistake upon
earth. They put the cart befnre the horse. |
Thsy might Just as we'll denounce the RI |
dicuieus proposition that yuItures drew the
carrion, for il is a denonsiraole fact thar
we're it not for the high prices there would
be no speculation Make sugar zen Of
twenty cents pound. and there will not be
another barrel brought 10 Virginia during
the war, and never another specuIaiOr en-
gagei in the trade. Fix the price II salt /
al five dollars per sack, and not another
speculation will 20 after il, and the people
will have TO do without IL. Cut down The /
price of calico 10 tea or twenty cent, per
yard, and not another yard will run The
blockade. Fix the price of shoes at three
or hse dollars, and not another pair will be
made. Fix the price Of wood At five d..
lars per cord, and nobody will sell. Re-
duce butter 10 twenty five cents per pound,
and We will have to eat grsaselrss bread
for five years to come. In short. put down
high prices, and you will pull down .pecu.
latbrs; and put down spectators, and you
will impoverish the markets and starye and
freeze the people.


These truths are 50 self.evident, that il
seems astonishing they should fail to secure
the sanction of the least obseryan, and
amongst rs. NO man speca-
lates FOR the mere pleasure Of the thing.
lie specuates 70 make money, and lie will

ton of the white OF all and conditions

no alternative therefore, but to defend ourselves with all

Cancellation, courage energy and determined resolution
the part of rulers and people We must cultivate one

charity and iorbearance.


DEFENCE OF THE STATE


The subject first in Importance, far as The Common
wealth concerned is the best means of providing an
adeauate force for the local defence of the State


or rad and for the execution of the laws n


resort to force shall at any time become necessary The
entire military force of The State has been absorbed by
the conscription law, and we are thus left in time Of
greatest peril with militia organization for the defence
of the Commonwealth. This want can be and must be
supplied with little delay practicable As TO the
plan of rang this force aware there is much diver
sy Of opinion. The difference, however ia reconcilsabe


if the subject considered and discussed in patriotic
spirit.


Let force consist of all able bodied persops be,yean
the ages OF sixteen and sixty not in the Confederate
vice organized, spOndng with the force now or
ganzed in the cities OF Richmond Petersburg and Lynch
burg. Let them be regularly enrolled formed into com.
panes baalious, and regiments and ofcered in such
manner will be most likely to secure efficient intelIi-
gent and energetic They should be drilled at pro.
per intervals to be well instructed in the evoutons
and the manual aud prepared for efficient service when
ever the necessity shall


The act should also define what local defence as there
is much conrarety opinion in regard to it, Some think


local defence consists in remaining home and under no
circumstances to be taken out the CITY or county in
which the company is organized This in my view is
most mistaken notion of the meaning of the term local
defence and, IT 1t is TO prevail will work great mischief
and render the organization little value in giving protec
tion people My opinion s, that if the city of
Richmond be defended certainly fifty miles from
il than Immediately around it In it, that locality il the
proper place for its defence and the local militia should
be required to make the defence there The officer
charged with the defence OF any particular locality ia pre-
suued to be better acqusinted with the mode o
it, and the best point for defending it successfully and he
should direct all troops best to secure the end de-
sired.


The object Of such organizations should be to give ade
auate protection to all parts Of the Commonwealth We
must only provide for the defence Of the counties
cities and towns by the local forces in and immediately
around them but we must under the law which is pro-
posed to be passed, have authority to order others from
contiguous counties TO their aid and support A force
whose operations to be confined by county city or town
boundaries can prove OF but little value in checking raids
or in executing and enforcing obedience to the laws


This organization should made to embrace the for
eign population who located amongst us This for
egn population may be sad to of three classes
First those who nave been regularly naurazed and Who
are therefore citizens embraced by the laws reatno n
the public defence; second those who are domiced
amongst us and have been living in our midst and prose
cutting various branches of business and who left their ma
tive land with purpose intention of returning IN 4
and lastly those who temporarily soiournnp amongst
The first class 10 the service under our military
laws and the second class should be required to 90 into
service for public defence of the soil on which they reside
The latter class who sourners engaged m no reouIa
business, should be exempt recommend therefore that
in your legislation upon this subject the second class h
referred to shall be clearly and distinctly embraced


THE REpUDATEp cuRREScY


The General Assembly its last session prescribed that
no Confederate issues date anterior to April 9Th 1864
should be received IN payment Of State taxes | am nm.
able to comprehend either the wisdom or policy of this
legislation l is calculated to impair confidence in the
currency OF the Confederate Government and nde.d in
amost the only currency in circulation the greater por
ton OF the State We have State bank circulation we
have no State Treasury note circulation both of these de-
scrpons OF notes having been boarded as fast as they
could be collected by moneyed men. The consequences
therefore, s that the holders Of the repudated Conede
rate issues are driven to the necessity of shaving off those
they have order procure such as will enable them to
meet the demands OF the State While it was not tho in.
enton OF the Legislature to place the taxpayers this
condition. such is inevitably the effect.


The only reason have ever heard assigned in justca
ton OF this legislation s that t designed force
persons holding this currency to fund in Confederate bonds
and thus retire 1t from circulation. Congress- feeling the
difficulty, and desirous to compel the funding passed an
act which provides that oil notes Of issues previous 10 De-
csmber lst, 1862, should be fuudabe in eight per cent
bonds If presented by the 22d day of April 1863 il not
presented by that day but presented before the st OF

at the Merchants Exchange in Cincinnati
on the sNth inst. said that ""if the


forces recently Sent to Chattanooga had been
ordered there bei.,re, as they ought to have
been, the backbone o. the rebellion would ere
this have been brskent"" General ROsecrans
speaks very much to the purpose and very
plainly. Others have insisted upon the i'm
portance of the ample reinforcement OF our
army at the same place; but the observation OF
General Rosecrans has its peculiar forcs from
the Intimate knowledge that he may be sup
posed to possess Of the whole suhjcct yet we
question very much whether the War Depart
ment and General Halieck with not consider
that in the enunciation of this fact General
ROsecrans has committed q misdemeanoY of q
very serious nature. But, as the country should
know, the hero Of Cerinth and Stone river is in
this particular regard an old sinner. His
speech at Cincinnati did not contain his first
reflection on that criminal waste of time BY
which the War Department has made the war
outlast the hope for peace. He has spoken be-
fore this clearly and fearlessly in condemna.
ton of the paltry manner in which the war has
been carried on; and in that fact may, per-
haps, be found the real cause OF his
removal. He was removed, not for want
of ability as commander, not for Delinquent
cy in the discharge of his duties, not because
he did not have the confidence of the country
aud OF his army. but because he could not sec
with admiration or even patience that pitiiut
political intrigues were Of the first Importance
to the War Department and that the salvation
of the country and the prosecution Of the war
were matters Of secondary consideration.


General Rosccrans in 1861 laid before the
government plan by which he could operate
from Western Virginia upon the rebel position
at Manassas and flank it. Though practicable,
it was not acted upon. In the next year be pro-
jected a plan for the capture Of Lynchburg
which would have given us possession Of the
Virginia and Tennessee Railroad. General
Mcclellan and the Secretary of War both ap-
proved of this plan; hat ""the clamor Of politicians
and the necessities Of military rank compelled
the administration to create the Mountain De-
partment for the benefit Of other generals
and thus, Ito please political ilction. prac-
tes, plan of operations which would have
protc,l OF immense advantage to the federal
ari,,s was thrown aside. and the season frittered
away in a campaign barren Of results"" Had
Genepai Rosecrans' second plan been acted upon
StOnewali JacksOns advance down the Shenan-
doatr Valley would never have taken place; Nc
Dowe,l would have formed junction with
General Mcclellan, then in front of Richmond;
Richmond must have fallen. and General Lee,


instead of crushing Pope, and advancing into
Mary land, would have surrendered with Rich
monA or have been competed to retreat
through North Carolina, while that State would
probably have risen against him at every step
OF the way, Now, to have presented these
plans to the War Department would. inasmuch
as they were not acted upon be a great crime


in any man; lsut to present these plans and tell
it should be expected abat any general guilty
of il must die. II two "" three secretaries Of war
and military adviser could between them
shuttle off his mortal coil. General Rosecrans
appears to have been guilty Of the greater
crime.


In the recently published ""Annais of the
Army OF the Cumberland"" there is n biography
OF General Rosecrans, in which these facts ap-
pear. and we give in another column some ex-

tainty. The total interruption of dispatches
on Sunday, owing to some arrangement of the
wires on the western telegraph line, was hardly
more tantalizing than the curious tumble of
kilograms previously received from Louis
vile and Nashville. 1t was only clear that a
contest of the most obstinate character, and of
critical moment to the country, was in pro-
press, or perhaps already ended-and how?
The anxious suspense with which the answer
to this question was awaited, has already been
Rosecrans to the General-in-chief at Wash
broken by the official dispatches from Gen.
ington: ave have fought one of the great
est battles of the war, and are victori-
GUS"" This dispatch, which we published in
full yesterday morning, was dated Monday,
and received in Washington on Tuesday. 1t
will be two weeks tomorrow since, on the
day after Christmas, Gen. Rosecrans moved
from Nashville. "" rCF


Murfreesboro, the former capital of Ten
nessee, Is 80 miles from Nashville, on the
Nashville and Chattanooga railway. The cap
ture of Murfrcesboro is only step towards





the position of this latter place may be OBJ
taiued, regarding it as situated at the intersec-
tioh of three lines of railway, rudely repre-
sented by the letter Y. The whole distance
from Nashville to Chattanooga, over the road
represented by the left branch of the letter, is
ISL miles. The trunk will represent the West
ern and Atlantic railway, from Atlanta, Ca,
to Chattanooga, 13S miles; and the right
branch, the East Tennessee and Georgia rail-
way, from Chattanooga to Knoxville, ITO
miles, connecting at Knoxville with the Ten
nessee and Virginia railways, which run
straight through to Lynchburg, Va, 334 miles.
Gen. Rosecrans marched on the 26th of
December, McCook commanding the column
on the right, Thomas the CENTER and Critten-
den the left. The left and center, marching
through rolling, hilly region, covered with
cedar thickets, and intersected by frequent
streams with high, rocky banks, encountered
considerable resistance; and on the 9th, as they
drew nearer to Murfreesboro, the skirmishing
became very sharp. Thirty-six of the Alaba-
ma cavalry were taken prisoners, and the
bridge at Stuart's Creek, 10 miles from Muir
freesboro, was captured by Crittendens dvi-
sion. On the right the enemy under Hardee
retired steadily as McCook advanced.


The weather was heavy and the troops fa-
tigued. On Sunday therefore nothing was
done. On the 29th December the army was
in motion by daylight, and by two o'clock had
crossed Stuart's Creek from right to left with
out serious opposition, though heavy skirmish-
ing continued, both Sunday and Monday. Mon
day night the army was in position three
miles north of fMurfreesboro. A reconnaissance
pushed south ward by Gen. McCook had proved
that Hardee was retiring upon Murfreesboro;
and it became evident that there, on Stone rv-
er. the great battle would be fought, if at ALL
Our troops had captured full rebel battery,
and were in the best of spirits. Murfreesboro
is built on both sides of the river. The two
armies, it should be remembered, were on the
west bank.


The whole of Tuesday, the 30th, was spent
in accommodating. The enemy was found to
hold very strong position, his right resting
on Murfreesboro, and his center on high ground
masked by dense growth of CEDAR After
dark it was reported, that Gen. Hardee was
strongly reinforced, for the obvious purpose of
turning our right wing. Gen. McCook was
ordered to hold him stubbornly in check, while
Gen. Crittenden was to seize Murfreesboro and
attack him in the rear, according to the origin
al purpose of Gen. Rosecrans.


On the 31st December, the battle began by
daybreak. As was expected, a heavy attack
was made upon our right, and by seven
O'Clock it gave way, recoiling upon the center
In great confusion. All the available artillery
was nassed for the protection of the center.
The enemy was checked by a tremendous
cannonade and driven back for mile, but this
arrangement Of the plan rendered it necessa-
ry to recall the left wing already ordered to
seize Murfreesboro. The enemy, beaten back
from the center, fell second time upon the
right,which was driven back four miles during
the day. At two o'clock the battle shifted
hours subsidized, ending at dark indecisively.
The enemy occupied the ground our army
held in the morning; but he had failed to cut
off their communications with Nashville. His
cavalry had been maneuvering in Rosecrans'
rear, both Tuesday and Wednesday, not with
out doing considerable damage.


On Thursday, the 1st January, both armies
were exhausted. Gen. Rosecrans began the
attack on the left, but Hardee still clung to
his right, and our army bivouacked on the
ground occupied the night before. Supplies
of ammunition were received during the day
from Nashville, making good the loss of trains
cut off by cavalry the day before. Heavy loss
of life to-day, but no tangible results as yet.


Thursday night Beatty's brigade crossed
Stone river on the left. Friday morning was
spenfin maneuvering for position, andit was not
till four o'clock in the afternoon that despe-
rate assault was made upon our center, and at
the same time an immense mass OF infantry
was hurled upon Beattys brigade, driving it
back across the river. The attack upon the
center was repulsed, and the whole strength
Of both armies in men and artillery was now
concentrated to contest the passage of the
river. After terrible struggle, charge of
Negleys division turned the wavering scale.
The 18th Pennsylvania captured the colors of
the 26th Tennessee. Another regiment seized
whole rebel battery. A grand shout of vic
tory rose along the entire line, and the army
was pushed forward on the left to the en-
emy's abandoned position on the east bank
of the river, and restored by the same move
ment to its position of Wednesday on the right."

THE WAR.",,"wo bova received our files of Southern papers,
.,.s;,r ,,oso Of as late date as the 2lst inst by
their accounts of Lees campaign in Northern virginia
&hev had not yet apparently heard Of Lees prectate
retreat They acknowledge severe whipping, how
eyer at Bristow Station where three Of their Generals
Cook. Posey and Kirkland, were wounded and their
loss In two brigades amounted to l.l26 killed ana
wounded They figure up their total loss in the cam
paign In killed and wounded alone at 500 Their loss
In prisoners is not given They claim to have captured
900 prisoners Thus they have gained about az
much they did in thor former advances northward
Burnside's operations in South Western virginia are
given in dispatch from Lynchburg Our forces struck
the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad between bristoi
and Abingdon destroyed five bridges threw one engine


from the track tore mp half mile OF track burned 'ne
GROSS ties and bent the iron and burned two engines


and five cars loaded with salt JEFF Davis made all ad'
dress to Braggs soldiers, in which he glorihed the
6shting Qualities and told them that much depended
upon them vet The other miscellaneous news Will be
found interesting.


Our advices from the Army Of the Potomac
continue Of the most satisfactory character Cavalry
continued part far as the
RappahAnnOck. The Orange and Alexandria Railroad
had already been repaired one mile beyond Bristow
Station. and forces kept at work night and day
The discipline and morale OF the army never were better
ana the officers and represented as having the
syreates confidence in Gen. Meade. II is estimated
that l5OO men viii all losses in the late cam
paigp including killed. wounded stragglers and rris
onera This. it will be seen is below the estimate OF
The Rebel loss made by themselves.


Rear-Admiral Dahlgren has thought proper
30 contradict in the authoritative manner the alb
surd report that the relations existing between General

The rebels are evidently disposed to give no
rest to Gen. Burnside's army in East Tennessee.
Gen. Longstrcet crossed the Tennessee river on
Saturday morning and was met by Gen. Burn
sides forces, who, being inferior in Numbers, fell
back to Lenoir. The enemy appear to have
pressed their attack during Sunday and Monday.
Burnside fell back to Campbell's Station, where,
being outnanked by the enemy. he withdrew IN
der cover Of his batteries, and by their well
directed fire drove the enemy back. BY slow re-
Progressive movements, constantly harassed by
the enemy, Gen. Burnside fell back on Knoxville
on Tuesday morning His position, al last &C.
counts, was invested by the rebels completely but
the determination of Gen. Burnside to defend it to
the last man, is confidently expressed.


We give some interesting news from the rebel
Journals to-day. 1t appears that Generals Cheat
ham and Buckner have asked to be relieved Of
their commands under General Bragg. This fact,
IL IL be true. would bear out the stories Of demo.

Colonel Lowell was then sent for, and after

Editors Herald The Democratic ball
rolls gloriously on in old Stewards Flat pre-
cinct, and you can set us down good for a
handsome majority for the democratic ticket,
Notwithstanding the numerous Republican
Missionaries who are sent among us. The
Repubs won't face the music. Winchester
was here Saturday night last--so was G. G.
Newman, Esq. Winchester would not an
swer his questions. By the way, the most
amusing Missionary demonstration came
off here few Sundays since, when Phil.
Lynch, of the Placer Courier, who made his
appearance in saloon unobserved, swung
his hat, and called for three cheers for the
Union ticket--no response. Phil then pro-
posed to take little whiskey, and-drank
alone. He next proposed to play game of
Euchre for the whiskey--nobody accepted.
| here informed Phil. that the people regard
ed his noise as an innovation on their accus-
toned quiet Sundays. He replied, that he
considered this ""a id Copperhead hole y
and gave me countersign. | told him he
couldn't play that on me for a Union League
countersign.


He again proposed three cheers for the
Placer Couoier!! No response. Phil. left
disgusted--hence his blackguard article in
his filthy sheet in reference to our place.

who left all their stores in our possession. Our
cavalry were pursuing the fleeing rebels when the
express left. The rebel loss was sixty killed and
twenty-four wounded. Colonel williams, of the
First colored Kansas, was severely wounded.


EUROPEAN NEWS.


The news from Europe which we publish to-
day has been received by the telegraph from the
steamer Scotia, at Cape Race, and the City Of
New York and Olympus, which have arrived at
this port. The intelligence is four days later, and
possesses many features of interest. The City of
New York made one of the fastest passages on
record across the Atlantic, for screw steamer
accomplishing the voyage from Liverpool to
Queenstown and New York in eight days and
twenty-three hours. The most interesting and
important part Of the news is the withdrawal of
Mr.. Roebucks motion for the recognition of the
Southern confederacy, after spicy debate in the
House of Commons, which will be found fully re-
ported in another part of to.days paper. The
remarks of the O'Donohue on that occasion were
characterized by much friendliness to America.
discussion had also arisen on the case of Bri-
tish vessel-the Margaret and Jessie-alleged to
have been sunk by federal war steamer off the
Bahamas. and the matter referred to Lord Lyons.
to demand explanations and redress from our
government. The other branches of news are Of
general interest to the reading public.


Queen Victoria will visit Germany for four
weeks in August, staying at the Castle of Rose
nau. She will travel as Duchess of Lancaster,
and will visit the King of the Belgians for day
en- route.


MISCELLANEOUS NEWS.


The Spanish frigate Princessa arrived at this
port yesterday, and anchored in the bay. At
noon all the men-of-war lying off the Battery
hoisted the Spanish national ensign at the fore
and fired salute as a mark of respect to the
Princessa..


The Commissioners of Excise received and ap-
proved large number of applications for liquor
license last week. AS they will shortly hold
their last session for the current year. all persons
who need license had better apply therefor imme-
diately.


The Position OF the Rebel Army OF Vir-


gtnia.


After much mystery as to the whereabouts
of General Lees army, it would now appear
that he has given the slip to General
tween his rear guard and our forces at
Thornton's Gap, has succeeded in crossing
the Blue Ridge at that point and was safe at
Culpepper (or Orange) Court House at late
hour last night. General Lee was undoubtedly
in pretty strong force at or near Front Royal
on Friday, and his cavalry was driven from Ma
nassas Gap about sunset on that day. From Front
Royal he appears to have pushed on to Chester
Cor Thornton) Gap, through which, notwith-
standing the obstacles he was supposed to have
met with there he passed in safety.


Under these circumstances, what is to be the
policy of the administration.


The army of General Grant is amply sufficient
to take care of the debris of Joe Johnston's
late army Of odds and ends and the demoralized
and retreating army of Bragg. This will leave
the splendid army OF General Rosecrans free
for liberating campaign through East Tennes-
see and Southwestern Virginia. and 80 on to
Lynchburg and Richmond. Perhaps the late
cutting of the Virginia and Tennessee Rail-
road at Wytheviile may have been the initial step
to movement against Lee on the part of Gen.
Rosecrans. The time has certainly arrived for
the liberation Of the long suffering and cruelty
prosecuted loyal people of East Tennessee; and
this duty, not less than the policy of powerful
diversion from the Southwest against Richmond,
is we hope, at the bottom of the new campaign
of our Army of the Cumberland.


A crushing defeat or dispersion of the rebel
army of Virginia is all that is now required to
bring this war to an end, or to contemplate
guerilla warfare which will soon exhaust itself.
All the movements of all our armies between
Virginia and Mississippi should therefore be
now mainly directed, not against Mobile, or
Charleston, or Wilmington, or Richmond. but
ton or dispersion of which, in single blow,
secures airs the strongholds of the rebellion.
There is now no place Of refuge in the cotton
States for JEFF. Davis and his government, his
Confederate scrip and his books and papers.
He is not wanted in North Carolina. He has
no choice, therefore, as it appears to us, but to
""die in the last ditch"" at Richmond; and hence
the supreme Importance ofnow allowing neither
time nor facilities in any direction to Lee for
the recuperation and reinforcement of his army.


EUROPEAN VIEWS or THE SOUTHERN REBEL

were soon compelled to leave that locality. :
In the afternoon guard Of five or six negro
soldiers who were sent ont to gather up strag-
giers Of the regiment, came across one In the

he drew revolver and discharged one of the
barrele the contents taking effect, II Is stated

hasiy retreat, followed BY the guard, as also by
crowd Of $50 or 200 persona, and passed along
Lombard street to Exchange Place, where Il

he drew his revolver and discharged another


barrel, the ball entering the wrist of the sailor;
who grasped the sword which the negro wore

The crowd had by this time reached the spot,
and in order to save himself from summary

been titillated by the hope OF a defeat and de-
struction of Burnsides army now holding East
Tennessee. The plan was To dispatch two
corps from Bragg's army. with a like force from
Virginia. and rush upon him so secretly and
suddenly as to insure his utter destruction. But
both Gen. Grant and Gen. Burnside are long
since apprised of this clever plot, and have
doubtless taken steps TO Illustrate it. The con
ccniration Of all the Western commands under
Gen. Grant ought OF itself to preclude the sue
cess of such scheme. II the Rebels advance
to Knoxville on such an crrand, they viii have
Gems Grant and Thomas on their flank and
rear, and will hardly return in safety. But We
receive no evidence from the West that they
have even made the attempt Their main
army in Georgia badly needs shoes, blankets,
and almost every essential Of camp life. They
can hardly hope to win these by placing Gen.
Grant in their rear.


Recently, very good device for apprecia,ing

l'th, Washington l7th.-Thc brief note which
wrote you yesterday, simply stated the great
disaster that has befallen the army Of the Po
tomae but to day it is evident that tho reality
was even worse than it appeared yesterday
Ii 1t was possible tc cover the government.
with deeper load of infamy than that under
which 1t has long staggered, the events of last
week would do it every day.


Inc government organs have contained off,
clal assurances that Meade had ADVANTAGE of
position, that Lee had been foiled in his do
signs, that the skirmishes that had taken placa
were OF no Importance, that We had come off
nrst best IN every engagement, ana our army
had gained brilliant victory. Here is Satur
day, and how does the case stand. we have had
hight every day this week and have been
driven successfully from every position we oc
euPied, every day, along the whole route from
Cuipepper to this city. Our army made a gal
!ant stand every day, we have been driven
oacK until now eur weary troops find shelter
and rest under the defences of the capital
Gen. Lee has not been foiled in his DESIGNS -
What his ultimate designs are has no, vet baan
developed. Up to this time he has sncceedad
In getting possession of the gaps in Bull RIM
mountains III pouring in troops throu oh thase
gaps and defeating Gen. Meade's army in
eight eugagements,o on as many successive d,vs
ana driving our forces from Culpepper to war.
j To
Manassas, from Manassas to Centerville. from
Centerville to Fairfax, from Fairfax to Wash |
lngton, and this, too, with such preci pit tat on
ON our part that were compelled to l..va /
our dead and wounded in the hands of the
reoeis- Ihe engagements We're important for |
they have resulted lii the complete defeat orl
Gen. Meades army, ana its retreat to the na
uonal capital. Lee is now ablo to b .si ere and
probably will hesi ege tho city. If we have
gained a brilliant victory, these are its fruit.
at the time L wrote my letter of the 18th.
Meade's army was. as tnen supposed, at Cen
terviIle. Mea .es good gcneralship had ena-
bled him to gain that position, but of what
avail was it to him. On that day Gen. Lee
moved his army from Manassas Junction
across Bull Run, around Gen. Meade's right
aank to hantliy with the intent to reach aud
occupy Fairfax aud SO get in Meade's rear
lie would have done this if Meade had not |
penetrated his design and prevented its c,e- (,
cution. The only way by which Meade could |
prevent his army from thus being cut off from t
Washington, was by quitting his position at
CcnterViile aud occupying Fairfax before Gen.
Lee could reach that po ut. Meade did this
but Fairfax is position which is utterly un-
tenable. Having got his army there nothing
remained to be done but to remove them 10
the lines around Washington, and here accord
lngly they are. Gen. Lee in the meantime o.,
cupicd CeutervIlie, and uIV-- - u ur ,rf,t.



cent those of his troops who at the west.
There is no probability that Lee will either |
attack Washington the Potomac at
preset even If lie had many as Ell 5hty /
thousand troops, and L think it doubtful III
he had so many he still would not be strong
enough for either of tue enterprises. If he Is !
reinforced by his four divisions now in the
west lie may essay an attack on the capital, II
not it is at least in his power t. remain a Cen
teryile during the fall and coming winter with
sixty thousand He will probably do that
if he does nothing more, so the probabilities
are that when Congress meets, they Will as
semble in a beleagured city. So much for the
situation here.


Now for few words about Charleston
The Governments fine promises that Charles
ton should be taken, have at last dwindled
down to the following statement, as given in
the official organ of the administration: The
distractions in the harbor of Charleston are of
such a nature that they cannot be moved by
any appliances of ours, and they are OF too
formidable u chli acter to justify a hazardous
attempt by our Iron-clads to peuetrate further
into the harbor and within range of the rebel
guns.


dispatch from the army of the Potomac
states that Lees withdrawal from the vicinity
of Washington was caused by the TACT OF
Furnishes threatening Lynchburg The rebel
General protested against the order, desiring
to give battle to Meade's army, but Davis
would not WELD to his wishes; he accordingly
made a retrogaIe movement, completing his
xithdrawal from the Federal front on Sunday
night. Pursuit was soon after made by
Meade's cavalry, and the rebel rear was come
ND with on Monday noon rear Thor ugh Fare
Gap, and a tight skirmish ensued, lasting four
hours, resulting in the repulse of tie rebels In
his retirement Lee destroyed the railroad
from Manassas to Culpepper. Arrived at the
latter poin the bulk of his army was trans
norted southwark by railroad


Rosecrans has been relieved of the command
of the army of the Cumberland. His success
or, according to' one report, is Thomas, and
another is Hooker.


Grant takes general command OF the armies
of Tennessee. the Cumberland and Kentucky.
He left Louisville yesterday fer Chattanooga,
10 assume the direction of affairs at that
point.


1t is reported at Cincinnati that kosecrahs
is to succeed Meade, in command OF the army
of the Potomac.


Rebel prisoners make boastfui assertions
that the army of the Cumberla nd is in O trap,
from which ii has means of escape. They
state that Bragg has lately been largely rein
forced.


Washington, Oct. 22.-It is calculated that
the damage done to the Alexandria Orange
railroad will be repaired in ten days."

tor Mawdsey with them ia the tender. When Carlisle, Mr.
De Costa Inspector Mawdsley, the captain and the Off
GERS wont board the vessel i've men were picked
from the and charged by the captain with
mutinous conduct and attempting 70 stab tho arst
officer. The captain stated that the officers OF tho
ship had to sleep all tho previous night with arms pre-
pared and matches batened down. they feared an
attack upon them from the crew Whea Carlisle went
board seeing tho state OF affairs he advised the men
20 be quiet rcuarkng that they were ~ the port Of Law
erpool, aud II they had any grievance 70 complain o!
they would receive justice The however,, did not
at all inclined to follow his advice, and somo Of
them shouted that rather than that the five men who
had been picked should be taken shore they would
""cover the deck with blood"" Carlisle demonstrated
with them to the folly OF thor conduct pointing out
that If hoy had anything complain they would get
ample redress The lve men who had been picked out
rs no leaders OF the mutncers and whom the officers
propoed TO take on shore, said that they would noe leave
the vessel others OF tho shouted out that II tho
Iolce took Que on shore they must take all and that
before they would allow them to do 50 they would ""spil

While Carlisle attempting to persuade the mon to

VEN, saying at the same time, Take tha: you that

asked whether he should shoot the man' Carlisle begged

that no had received wound about an inch in length IN

an honest Mexican, he suspended
the mail and express bags to a tree

A quarrel ensuei, and WAS about ending In

This Rechard WAS IN no way connected with the
snarrel in question: but be was Butternut, and
had wbettNi his kuife IN she morning before leaving
home and stated that he intended 10 kill some Abo-
htonst Linooluite that day. and this he thought,
no doubt, wac q favorable opportunity TO carry ont
his cowardy design. This diabolicsl act, Us might
be ex pected highly incensed both citizens aud sol
diers and many cried ont, Kill him J. lie started
to run, when Officer King arrested him.


lie broke loose, however, aud then several
stones were hurled o, him, sons of which struck
him on the bead, by which he was badly bruised,
snd severe cuts inflicted, but WAS not dangerously
hurt. He ran into Dr. Minon's drug store, and sn
excited crowd followed him 10 the door. Elias
Clear, psroled soldier went into tho store 10 as-
sist IN srresting him. This Reicbard, when he saw
Clear, rushed toward him furously aud plunged hi-
knife nearly te the hil into the left side o. Clear
which penetrated his chest near the heart, passing
shouh tho lungs, diaphragm, and into the stomach,
and thus inflicted mortal wound.


At this moment j. I. MeGregor went TO Clears

plunged the knife into his LEI; side Also Stiil
mother soldier, by the nane OF Myers, who by ths
time had got inside Of the store, but was not al
tempting 10 do anything, received stab from the
same man. Myers threw up his arm 10 ward oil the
blow and thus saved his life; the knife Instead OF
penetrating the chest, as was evidently intended,
inflicted bad but not dangerous wound in the aEul.
After this the asssssn was secured and hurried oil

The occurrence Of such scenes, although the ex-
citemrnt WAS great characterized by great for
bcafance and moderation BY both citizens aud sol
dicrs. 1t was feared at time that mob or Lynch
law would bo rcSorted TO at once. but was FORUM

not immediately killed. IL eau only be accounted
for rom tho ct that the soldiers aud but few Of the
citizens were armed. l turn now to the wounded.

The Crime and Shame or the Rebels.


We have before us copy of the Register OF
the Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the

Ferguson. How we got 1t is our enterprize.
Sufficient for our readers to know that it Ii Q
perfect imitation of the United States Navy
Register, with this difference, that ours is blue
and theirs is yellow, Vfter the French and after
the yellow cover literature, whose moral cha
racter is in close affinity with that of the ltera
ture Of the confederacy. II Is q record Of the
crime and shame Of The officers Of what is now
called the Confederate navy.


The officers in general military command""

Gf warranted), and ""ofacers restricted in their
right to command"" are from ""srIrgeon"" to
""sailmaker."" Under ths head of ""The Organi-
zation Of the Navy Department"" we have lists
of names from S. r. Mallory, Secretary, down
wards, including their duties, place Of birth,
from what State they hail as citizens, the sala-
ries, the ""ofice Of orders and detail,' ""ofRce
Of ordnance and DETAIL"" ""ofics Of ord
nance and hydrography,"" ""ofice Of pro-
visions and clothing"" and ""ofice Of
medicine and surgery"" The tables oom-

captains captains for the war;"" commanders
and Commanders for the war; first and se
cond iieutenants, and s'lieutenants for the war""
midshipmen engineers, surgeons, Ac, occupy
twenty-five pages Of the book, and the list looks
very formidable on paper. Opposite each name
is the date Of ssthe original entry into the SER
vice Of the United States Navy"" and the date Of
s'the original entry into service Of the Confsde-
rate States Navy the date Of present COM
mission, the amount of ""sea service and shore
service"" 10 the United States Navy and In the
Confederate States Navy respectively.


Thus they place on record their own dis
grace as having traitorously deserted the flag
Of the government which educated them for the
navy and gave them commissions, and enrolled
themselves in the service Of rebel govern
ment that has broken up the Union under
which the country has prospersd and made it.

Of a century. But the rebel navy il, after all,
only navy on paper; for under the head Of
""Sea Service in the Confederate States Navy
there are either blanks or the time il measured
by few months, while under the column
''shore Service in the Confederate States Navy""
we find scarcely any blanks, and the period Of
service ranges from year and nine months
down to two months.


The most important thing for our governinent
and the country to know is where the migrate
traitors are just now and what they are doing.

The ob- ject of this is very apparent It is to prevent an uprising of the people to repel invaders and pre- vent the calling out of militia. When country is invaded, the people naturally arm themselves to repe the invasion. This natural warfare IS prompted by the instincts of self preservation. Ii the battle ground was the country of neutras, who were not to be disturbed in the enjoyment of their property, there might be some excuse for such stringent orders. The abolitlonsts dread the people and know that they never conquer or hold districtif the people will resist them. Hence . their sending boys of ten years of age to military prisons; their cold blooded murders of men who take up arms to defend their homes and their ban ishment of women who show the least love of b erty. There is yet another motive in this. The is fast becoming of extermination, and they seek every pretext to murder Confederate sol ders., They dare not raise the black flag, but they so manageit as to secure good treatment ot their soldiers taken prisoners, and under different pretexts, murder those patriots whom they take. While they do these things they organize negro regiments and threaten to retaliate if one of them is killed. While they do these things, in order to pallate them, they fill their papers with stories of cruelties practiced by the Confederates.

 Some of these accounts are ridiculous, such as the burning and torture of prisoners of war, and their starvation or lynching In our State and in Missouri, they have murdered prisoners of war in cold blood and have dragged unofending citizens from their homes and butchered them. We feed prisoners, parole and exchange them, but we notice that when they take prisoners, except large body such as at Arka nsas Post, we never see them again. They either shot, hung. or stabbed, or thrust into filthy prisons in contact with the small pox or other dangerous disease, to insure their deaths. We are conducting this so as to mitigate it's evils as far possible;-they are rying it on after the manner of savages There is way to check this and teach these men that kill ing is game that two can play at, and if the ene my persist in such conduct, our soldiers will not permit themselves to be taken prisoners and take none."

cent splendid operation of General Kelley in
Western Virginia shows two things very clear
ly. First that the enemy have plenty of sup
plies at certain bases but that the difficulty
of conveying them to the great centres Of their
armies renders the position of the latter often
precarious and cripples their movements. And,
next, il shows the immense value of our caval
ry force in increasing that difficulty by cutting
off communications by railroads and canals.
1t appears that large quantities Of supplies
are stored at Lynchburg and at many smaller
places in the surrounding counties of Western
Virginia, such as Salem, Liberty, Staunton and
others, and that these posts are carefully and
nervously watched by the rebels, as the
supply of Richmond and Longstreet's army
depends upon the communications being kept
open. General Averill's expedition-in which,
as he describes it, his men marched, climbed,
slid and swan distance of three hundred and
fifty miles'-succeedcd in destroying some Of
these communications, and thus doing ncal-
culable damage to the enemy. During the win
ter season our cavalry might be employed in
this duty without breaking up winter quarters,
and so accomplish more mischief to the rebels
than the loss OF pitched battle."

GoRDoNsvILLE, Va, Friday, May 1.-The
enemy have advanced in strong force, and now
occupy Culpeper G. H., and are near the Rapl-
dan. Our troops are gradually falling back to
Orange c. II. and this place, In good order. II
is believed that a large body of the enemy's
cavalry have gone from Culpeper to Madison
c. II. Firing was heard all day yesterday, In
the direction of Fredericksburg. One OF the
up trains last night got of the track near Fred
erick's Hall, causing considerable delay.


Forty-tive Yankees, including two Captains,
go to Richmond by the train which carries this.
They were taken near Stevensburg, Culpeper
county, on the Goth, and represent about forty
different regiments. 1t also states that infor-
nation (not ofIlcial) was received last night
that battle was fought yesterday on the Rap
pahannock, in which we were victorious, and
captured 5000 prisoners.


Maj. Claiming Price, a son OF Mr.. T. B.
Price, of this city, was killed in action few
days ago, in Spottsylyana county. lie was
attached to Gen. Stewards staff.


tClegraphiC operator from Louisa Court
House arrived at Frederck's Hall Station, 10
miles this side Of the courthouse at II As on
Saturday. He reports that the enemy, about
1000 strong, came into Louisa Court House
at j O'Clock this morning, and have since that
time torn up the railroad track for distance
of four miles in this direction, and are still at
the work.


Their first inquiry was for the operator, who
had made his escape by the back door while
they were searching the House for him. He
states that reinforcements arc coming up very
rapidly and presumes that by this time their
force must be greatly augmented. At Trevil-
lans', 3 miles up the road, they appeared, II is
reported, 10000 strong. This, however, may be
GXaggcratiOn. The report comes from GordOus-
willie via Lynchburg, and was brought to the
former place by a courier.


About five O'Clock last evening, while u
numerous throng awaited the arrival Of the
ambulance train from Fredericksburg, Mr.
John Davis, of Hanover county, arrived on
horseback, and brought information that the
Yankees were at Ashland engaged in tearing
up the track of the Richmond and Fredcricks-
burg railroad, and burning the buildings. lie
states that he saw a large volume of smoke,
which satisfied him that the Yankees were
upon his route, and he Immediately set off for
Richmond to bring the information.


The ambulance train failed to arrive, though


it is known to have passed the Junction in
time, and II is believed 1t was captured. Sur
geOn +. W. Hancock, who is assisting the
medical director in receiving the sick and
wounded from the army, got dispatch from
Milford, dated O'Clock, Informing him that
the ambulance train had passed that station
with 1893 sick and 60 wounded; that 800 sick
were left at Guinney's and 500 more at Milford,
and that a heavily loaded friesh train was
coming on behind. The fate Of the ambulance
train is uncertain, though there is reason to ap-
prehcnd that II has fallen into the hands of the
enemy.


1t understood that the bridges on the route
were guarded, and II is believed that the opera
tions of the Yankees will not extend farther
than what may have been done at Ashland. A
report was current last evening that the Yam
KEGS yesterday visited Deibrick's store, on the
line of GoOchland and Henrico counties, 10
miles from Richmond, and sacked the premises.
The central train arrived from Hanover juno
ton, about O'Clock last night, bringing $50
sick soldiers and 81 Yankee prisoners. The
latter were captured in Spotsylvunia county,
on Friday last.


The Enquirer of the 9TH has a dispatch from
General Lee, dated Milford. MAY 8, wherein he
claims that Jackson and LOngstrect on the 2d
penetrated to the Federal rear and drove him
from all his positions, from the wilderness to
within one mile of ChanCellOrsville and that
subsequently the Federals were dislodgcd from
all their positions around ChabceOrsyille and
driven back towards the Rappahannock.


The same dispatch acknowledges the wound
ing of Gen. Jackson severely, and of Gen. Heth
and A. P. Hill slightly.


The Enquirer also has the following, which
was received at the War Department:


GoRDoNsvHLE, May 4.-W. s. Voolfolk left
Charlottesville at 3 O'Clock p. m. Yesterday.
He reports that the fight was still going on at
Fredericksburg. Gen. jackson occupies all
the fOrds except Ely's, and had taken 5000
prisoners, and prisoners are still coming In.
Our men are in good condition. Our loss is
heavy. All seems quiet in front. No enemy
at Culpcpcr.


The Richmond Wing, of the 4th of May, CON
tains the following:


TULLAnOMA, May l.-Gcn. Forrest met the
enemy near Moulton yesterday, and repulscd
him in hand to hand fight. The enemy are
in full retreat. Forrest is in full pursuit. All
quiet in front.


ANOTHER DISPATCH.


CHATTANOOGA, May l.-All quiet in front.
The enemy are within their intrcnchmcnts, ON

Huntsville, dated to-day, says Forrest repulsud
the enemy with considerable loss yesterday at
Danyille, 10 miles from Decatur, and is stlll
pursuing them. Our loss will not exceed 30.
Our pickcts are now beyond Courtand.


JACKSON, Miss, May 1.-The enemy ad-
vanccd and lighting commenced at Grand Gulf
this morning at one O'Clock, and continued
until four, when the enemy was repulsGd. The
battle was renewed at eight O'Clock.


The Yankees captured Wade's Virginia bat
terry, which was re-takcn by our troops this
evening.


The enemy has been driven a mile from the
battlefield, and firing has ceased. Loss heavy
on both sides. General Bowcn's horse was
struck four times in a charge on the enemy.


NATCHEZ, Miss, May IA gentleman who
left Alexandria, La, ON Wednesday morning,
brings intelligence that Banks is not now, nor
has he been, nearer than fifty miles of that
place, He also reports that General Moulin,

There was a meeting last night at the Exchange
Hotel in pursuance of the following call:


""Ihere Will be q convention of all the dele.
gates from all the wards to morrow night at

between Four-and-a half and Sixth streets, for
the purpose OF nominating candidate for Sur
veyor for this city,


O'Meara, who nominated Mr. Edward OCon-
nor as chairman, which was unanimously car
riedi and Mir. Eugene Brown was appointed
secretary.


The following delegates answered to their
names


First Ward-Miles Gibbons, Martin Connor,
Luke Connor, James O'Day, John Connolly,
Peter O'Day.


Second Ward-Mchael Farrall


Third Ward-Eugene Brown. Jere'h Lynch
D;,m'l Barry, Ed. Walsh, John Casey.


Fourth Ward-Jas. Fletcher, Morris Ready
Edw'd Scanlor, John Carmidy, Ed. O'Commor


Fifth Ward-John O'Meara, Daml McFaul


Sixth Ward-John Smith, Jas. Quiaey.


Seventh Ward-Thos. Burns, Thomas Snee
(subStituteS.1


Some informal discussion took place as to
whether other municipal officers bes ide the Sur
veyor should be nominated, and it was finally
decided to defer action upon all but the sur
TeyorshIp nominee until after Wednesdays
action OF the nominating ward meetings should
determine what was the best course OF action
for them 10 pursue.


The Chair said there had been considerable.
inquiry as TO who and what Mr.. Donegan
(thelr canGidate) was, and If he was q citizen
OF the United States; and 10 satisfy this curos-
ny, ne was nappy to produce the naturaliza-
ton papers OF Mr.. Donegan. From this paper
(Which the Secretary proceeded to ready II ap-
pears that Mr.. Donegan landed in New York
from Liverpool in 1857, entered for naturaliZa-
ton papers in 1853, and passed finally through
the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia
on February 9Th, 1863.


The Chair asked if any delegate had any
other name to propose for the nomination. OPP
position was the soul Of trade. [Laushter1


Mr.. Lynch said there were two candidates
in the field, both of the same origin and the
same belief i'll God. Until the two parties
could come TO some better understanding he
wished TO remain neutral. He had seen enough
harm from divisions IN his own country, and
wanted none of them here.


Mr.. Peter O'Day.-"" Whichever one gets the
most votes we must all go for him"" Laugh
ter.


MIR. John O'Meara spoke OF Mr. Donegan as a
nice, quiet, respectable gentleman, and good
Union man. The objection had been made to
him that Lord Lyons had brought him home
from the Confederate States as q British SUBJ
ject. The facts were these Mr.. Donegan was
attached TO the Coast Survey, and in that cana.
city was in Louisiana when the rebellion broke
out, and was thrown into prison by the Con-
fedeI ates. He was asked to take the oath of
allegiance to the Confederate States, but de.
clinrd, AS he had already taken the oath Of
allegiance to the United States and did not
wish to commit perjury His friends here
ascertalnlng the facts, went TO Lord Lyons, or
rather ms secretary, and such representations
were made TO rhe Confederate authorities at
New Orleans as caused his release, and he
returned here.


The vote being taken on the nomination, il
the exception of Mr.. Lynch, who still insisted
on beng counted cut as ""neuter''


The Chair said he believed Mr. Lynch 10 be
a man o! honor, and tha. he would vote fer
the nominee He had better make up his mind
and vote for somebody.


A voice.-""Vote tor Forsyth if you want to-""


Mr., Lynch.-""1 don't want 10 vote for For
syth here


Mr. Peter o ODay.-""P Put him cut, Put him
out! He talks too much English"" Laughter !


On motion the nomination was declared
unanimous, and Mr.. O OMeara and Mr.. Snee
were appointed committee 10 wait on Mr.
Donegan and inform him of his nomination.


They shortly returned with Mr.. D., who pro i.
ceeded TO express the deep debt Of gratitude he
felt Tor this manifestation OF their frisn aship.
He had no idea, until within a few days, OF
being brought out before the public Though it
had been lntimated TO him, he did not expect it,
He was glad TO see that they came in on the
Union ticket They were Of the class of men
upon whom depends the salvation OF the coun.
ry-the bone and sinew-who having worked
hard to build up The country, now feel disposed
TO maintain ii. II this country goes down, all
the hopes and prospects of the oppressed
throughout the world go down with it. He was
glad they had taken this stand for the Union
II they had not, he could not have gone with
them. fApplause and cries Of ""Good.""l


Mr.. Eugene Brown followed, urging their
duty TO support the country in its integrity
They, and not the aristocracy, Were to be looked
to TO maintain the Union and the liberties of the
country. [Applause.l


The Chair (Mr. O'Connor) made some re.
marks complimentary to their candidate, who
was prepared to do equal Justice TO all, poor
or rich. Such an officer was needed in Wash.
ington.

In Virginia, there is nothing concerning the movement on Richmond by way of Suffolk and Petersburg. AL Fredericksburg all was quiet. The enemy had nearly abandoned Staf- ford heights. The Lynchburg Republican of the 25tll,lllt professed to have information of i'm portant movement being 3lade by portion of Gen. Lees army. Stuart crossed the Rappahanock during the latter week in December, broke up the abolition camp at Dunfries, which was three thou sand strong, captured several wagon trains with army and suttler's stores, destroyed what he could not bring away, and had capturei 200 prisoners, and two pieces of artillery. Gen. Hampton, with 5O0 men, made successful circuit, went within few miles of Manassas Station, and after taking nearly hundred federal pickets in out of the wet, captured train laden with Christmas supplies, boots, gloves, and some small arms.

 The battle at Mvrfrecsboro is confirmed as a victory Gov. Harris elegraphs that we attacked the enemy at daybreak, fought till dark, captured four batteries three brigadier generals, and 4,000 prisoners. Gen. Rains, of Nashville, wa, killed. It is supposed that another battle has been fought ere this. Morgan had returned from Kentucky, and he, with Bulord, Forrest and Wheeler, mak- ing, in all force of fifteen thousand cavalry, were in the rear of the federal army.

 An abolition cavalry force of 4,000, under Gen. Carter, renegade Tennesseean, came through Pendleton gap, burned the Hobston and Wautuga railroad bridges, and destroyed the works at Salt vile.

 New Madrid, Mo-, Hickman, Ky, and other points were evacuated for fear that the Confede- rates would capture them Memphis in a fever for weeks at time, the partisans dashing in the very suburbs, and keeping them shaking in their boots. There report here that Van Dorn had captured Memphis, but this probably grew out of the fact that the people of Memphis thought it would be.

 The mbroglio of the cabinet at Washington had not ended Seward and Chase resigned, but Lincoln begged them to resume their positions - They did so, on conditions. The radical Senators held q caucus and instituted enquiries as to who had divuged the secrets of their former meetings. Senator King owned that he had told Seward. committee appointed to wait on Lincoln, and demand a change. The latter replied, that if the abolitionists would let his cabinet alone, they might assume the entire control of the war, and dictate the manner in which it should be carried on. The utraist Seward has become too conserv- ative for the blood red republicans

 The Mississppian of the 3d says, that Lincoln was to issue his proclamation declaring the slaves free in cert ain States and sections of States, that day. He may have compromised the matter, by agreeing to issue the proclamation and retain Seward and Chase.

 We have not full accounts of the Vcksburg fight. The fighting on the Yazoo and Chickasaw Bayou, were heavy skrmishes. There must have been other and heavier battles, for it is reported and generally believed that four gunboats were sunk, ind the abolitio1sts lost, at least, 10000 men. At all events, the enemy have abandoned"
