very serious disturbances of the peace IN
the neighborhood of Metropolis city, lii
nois. One account says:


There is a band of men back OF Me-
tropolis, composed as we learn OF the
worst characters, who set at defiance law
and order, and are known by the name OF
Flatheads. A body of citizens, composed
of good men, but of course having IN their
midst evil characters, are called Regula-
tors, and have been formed to carry out
the law. Some of the Flatheads stole
horses, and one Of the Regulators who IN
formed on them, was caught, lynched' ana
tied naked to a tree during night, ex-
posed to the mosquitoes and weather.
He died several days thereafter, but be-
fore his death he gave the names OF sew
eral persons he had recognized. Ihe
Sheriff found them, but they refused to
deliver themselves up unless they couio
be tried by Magistrates of their own selec-
tions, who of course would screen them.
The Sheriff could not to do this, and they
mere not arrested at the time. The Fiat
heads gathered to the number OF about
two hundred. The Regulators assembled.
and there was pleasant prospect OF
battle last week. The FIatheads finally
secured and fortified themselves in large
log house, about twelve miles back OF
Metropolis, to the number of about one
hundred and sixty, with two cannons and
ammunition. The Regulators were raj
lying last Friday (27th ult.,) and had sent
to Paducah and Smithland for cannon,
with the determine ton to arrest the three
men. A grand fight was expected to
come off last Saturday (2Sth ult)


Another story given by DR.. Young to
the editor of the Cairo Delta, is as fol-
lows:

bo, who are brothers -in-law, stand in the
position of leaders-the first of the Flat
heads, and the second Of the Regulators

incendiary was traced to the house OF

young man of bad character named Bruce,
confessed to setting fire TO the barn, but
turned States evidence, and said they
had been employed by certain Regulators
to murder prominent citizens OF Metropo.

Backus was whipped by ""the Lynns,"" a
family of very bad reputation belonging
to the Flathead side, who Were once
driven from Kentucky for misconduct,
and who were prominent in these diff
culties. Arrests were made on both sides
bv constables, and affairs were approach
ing a bloody crisis, when DR.. Young.
who says he had been occupying neu-
trail position, was chosen as peace-maker
bv the tlatheads, and in this capacity
went to the opposite party.


He made speech to the Regulators,
and gave them such assurance of peace
| from the other party, and of their limited
force and preparations, that the constable
dismissed the band, numbering about one
hundred and fifty. A guard of six Regula-
tors started out with DIR. Y. to escort him
back. This was on Saturday morning
last the 2Sth ult. When about seven
miles from Metropolis, they arrived in
| sight of the Elatheads, who numbered
sixty Here doctor took our informant
aside, and urged him to fly. as there were
hundred Regulators in ambush close by.
While they were talking, the Regulators
rushed out and attacked the other party.
DR.. Y. ran up 10 make peace, but fell
stunned by ball, which passed through
his hat and grazed his head. The Flat
heads fed, the Lynn family having been
the first to set the example. Two of the
Flatkead band. Samuel Taylor and Robt.
Canada were killed, and another wound
ed, Daniel Enlow, son of Col. Enlow,
formerly Representative from Massac
county. On the side of the Regulators,
man named Clinton King. who had
been the cause of much Of the strife, was
killed, and two others wounded, one
dangerously The sheriff, Read, had
gone home when he thought peace for
the time was established. Both parties
were all armed.


DR.. Young went to Metropolis, but
was warned to fly as the Regulators
wished to take his life, and was provided
with means. He was here on Tuesday,
and says he is going to see the Governor,
and lay the state of things before him.
He describes affairs III Massic county as
ruinous and growing worse daily. He
says there are good men in both parties,
but the mass are ruffians and loafers.

 ""This afternoon a man was hung in Stockton. His name was Mickey alias Biit Lyon. and he belonged 10 the fraternity of Hornds,' who have SO long provided about and disturbed the peace. His offence was burglary and theft, and hs trial was by nry--his sentence death by hanging. He ras szs- cttted with hs usanim0ns opprorai cf tAs people ef Stockt0R.

 ""A nnmber of men. implicated in offences com mitied by the same gang, have been arrested, and their trial will take place. The prompt action nf our citizens these matters has restored law and order to inc place, and we feel more secure low than we have for a six month past""

 Later adviees confirm the above account, and adh that one or more others convicted, were punished with rigid observance ei the batharous terms oi Judge Lynch; such shaving the head, topping the ears and other dIsgrsceiul mniaons oi the person. It is to be hoped that these latter reports were not well founded.

Muscogee (Ga.) Democrat. published at
Columbus, relates the following case of
brutality:


On the 18th inst, young white girl
of the name of Nancy Fam, who had
for two years been an inmate OF the house
of one James r. Jackson, formerly of
Alabama, but latterly of Shell Creek IN
this county, was, on petition OF her
mother, Mrs. Glider, from Hawkinsville,
brought before his-honor, Judge Alex
ander. on a writ of haJeaS corpus, and
after an investigation of the case, deliver
ed in charge Of her maternal parent.
The circumstances of the affair are bret
ly these: Fann's wife had obtained,
several years since; divorce from HIM,
for cause, and subsequently married a
man of the name of Glider, who has since
deceased. The girl Nancy was taken
off by her father Fam, and brought to
Girard, Ala, whence he removed to
Wynton, where, about two years ago,
she was sold by him for a blind horse and
JERSEY wagon, to James r. Jackson as
slave. By some means the mother heard
of the situation of her daughter, now
seventeen years Of age, and came on tere
eight months ago, with view to release
her from bondage to Jackson. Accord
iugIy che visited the house OF the latter
and staid three days, when she was order
ed off and otherwise abused for seeking
subsequent interviews with her daughter,
who was treated in all respects as a
negro slave by Jackson and his family.
This becoming known in the neighbor-
hood, Mr. James M'Guier and other
gentlemen interested themselves IN the
matter, and by the generous and volun-
tary aid of Col. S. Jones and Col, Ruth
erford, the sheriff, assisted the mother in
the recovery of her child, as aforsaid, by
a writ of habeaS corpus. To the credit
of the bar of this city and Girard, not one
of the lawyers would undertake to defend
the illegal claim of Jackson to the services
and person of Nancy. Indeed, the public
feeling was getting excited both at Fam,
the seller of his own white child, and
Jackson the purchaser. The latter is a
church member and eXhorter in holy
things, and yet treated the female most
shamefully. She was the only servant
about the house, or in the field of Jackson, (,
and was compelled to perform the most
laborious mental drudgery. AS to Fam,
he is said to be a rowdy Of the lowest
class, and is now living in open concubi-
mage in the neighborhood of the Wynton
Female Academy, having selected that
respectable and quiet village as ""city
of refuge from the lynching threatened
him in Girard, if he did not leave the
latter place with despatch."

which we extract from the Lynchbure
Virginian, must fill the mind of every
Southern man with pride and pleasure.
The industry and enterprise thus exhibited
and the large amounts thus invested, hold
out bright hopes of a powerful and pros,
porous future to the South.


s'In an address,, says the Virginian,
recently delivered before the Americar,
Institute of New York, are details which
will be read with interest and which will
animate the breast of every Southern man.
Delaware has a greater number of manu-.
featuring establishments, in proportion to
population, thap any other State in the
Union. Maryland has invested $45, ,OOO,-
coo in Railroads, Canals and manufactur.
ing operations. Virginia has similar in.
vestments, to the amount of $50, ,O0O, 600.
and will shortly have Railroads in opera.
ton to the. extent of 1900 miles N.
Carolina has 500 miles of Railroads COM
pleted or In the course Of construction.
Although South Carolina has hitherto
advocated foreign markets as material to
her interests, yet, from the practical influ-
ence which Railroads have had in demon.
strating the true policy of producing
country, she has embarked in manufac.
turing to some extent, and the result of
which bids fair to- make it a valuable
auxiliary to her interests. Florida, though
1t has but lalely become a State, has
S4,000,O00 invested in Railroads and
manufacturing.


Georgia has, perhaps. of any State in
the South, reaped the most ample remu-
neratlon, present and prospective She
has more than seventy cotton factories in
successful experiment, and she is building
railroads as last as her energies can be
taxed. All over the States of Alabama.
Tennessee. Kentucky, Mississippi and
Arkansas, the same spirit is diffusing
itself. While Missouri has the macnifi.
cent. snm of $S5,OOO,OOO invested in min
ing, railroads and manufacturing.


""These things are contemplated by
every rational mind with peculiar gratifi.
cation. Every year will still extend inn
provement IN all branches, and will have
powerful tendency TO check the evil,
which. according to some of our states
men, will be to us virtue of necessity"""

than those of green hand


WOODS CAMP, lStanislaus Diggingso I
June 5, lS49.
Joined two young men from Brooklyn, New
York, who came up in the steamer with us from


Panama, and commenced working in good earnest,
and did very well for the next two weeks, making
$500 each. Since we have not done so well, in
the last two weeks making but 100 apiece


The gold here lies it does in Virginia, in depos-
its and pockets, and whoever is lucky enough to
strike them make good hauls. ANY one that has


a mind to work has S 0 or $l2 day. l think
| that is about the average OF miners now, although
| there are thousands who are making great deal


more, but that depends very much upon the place


they are at work. On the 5th May took out a


piece that weighs pound, and am in hopes to get
it home safe. so that you all may see it.


Ihave been here six weeks and have made al


most $500, but hope to do better the next six


weeks to come. Provisions are falling every day,


not be surprised if goods in the fall could be bought
cheaper here than in the States, frv,n the great


quantity shipped here from all parts of the world


Our board costs US about So day, which is very
cheap in comparison with what twas. When we


arrived here pork was selling at s 25 cents per


pound, now 923 cents; flour ST., now 35 cents;
sugar 81, now AS cents; fresh beef IS ceuts, now
25, and every thing else in proportion. Lynch

found among the sand and gravel beds, in slate and


granite rocks also in good tillabie soil Some ma


chimes were used when left, but tin pans gen.


orally preferred. Some Indian baskets Were also


used, and considered good, being were light and
| handy. saw, yesterday, machine invented by a


gentleman of this city, living, believe, in Edndge


street, which consider superior one and would


advise those who intend going to the gold diggings


to examine it. 1t is very simple and easy to trans


port. The quantity of gold extracted is estima-


ted at about fur millions of dollars. The labor of


washing the gold is very severe. People wash gold


as long as theycan stand up, often paying no atten-


ton whatever to the demands of their health, living


without adequate food and sleep, when they do


sleep it is in the open air. and thus nature gives way


and the individual sickens and perhaps dies.


IF person has sufficient strength of mind to build


his house before commencing to procure gold, and


can be contented to work only reasonable time


every day, devong proper time to cook suitable food


and proper time to Sleep he may be sure of retain


ing his health and amassing fortune. The difficult


ty is that everybody is crazy, frantic with the excite


ment for gold. Each fears that his neighbor will


get more than himself. The Captain of the vessel

dust of the value of $4,000, and of this $4,000


were gathered by him in the last three days he


at the mines. This amount he had on board the


sci (the brig Laura Ann.) He informed me that in


washing out the last he must have thrown away 2


ounces from each tin-panfull of earth, it would


pay better not to wash carefully. The largest lump

was obtained by some Indians in the employ of


man by the of Weaver. l saw it weighed,
and it was pronounced I94 carats fine. statement


published in the California STAR few days be-
fore / left, that man obtained $4,000 in six


days, and that three others obtained 36 pounds in


day. OF the truth of this have doubt whatever.


1t may seem impossible, even udrcrous, but such is


the fact. Such occurrences are by no means uncom-


mon. The '' dry diggings are considered prefera-


bic to the wet. The gold be procured in the


winter and rainy season as well as the dry season,


In case the miners provide themselves with houses


and supply OF food. In the present state of soce


ty in California, rather in the absence of all law

| Those of you who have read the official commune
cation of Commodore Thomas Ap Catesby Jones, of
the 22d December, 1913, twelve days after left San


Francisco, may have observed the following remark


''Incredibe quantities of gold yet daily collected,
and scarcely week elapses without some dis
covery of the precious meta startling than any
previous one.'' The Commodore also alludes to the


fact that few days previous to the date of his dis


patch small party of five six persons obtained,
in two days, 100000 worth of pure gold. l have


more doubt of the truth of the statement by Com


modore Jones than have of the fact of my existence.


Yet, to who has similar instances of
success, such an announcement seems absolutely In
OeDLlc1en mink IL can hardIy De neceS-
sary for me to say to you the actual existence
of gold in immense quantities and comparatively easy
of in California. Whatever may be the effect
upon the money market of the world. other persons
than myself can better determine, but perfectly
satisfied that the supply is immense. The gold re-
gion, part of which has been explored, embraces,
you have observed, larger than the State of
New fork, and discoveries being made daily.
There are, told. little less than $4,000 square
miles in the State of New York, and if two persons
only digging on each square mile, you would
have 900 persons. Now it is possible, though
hardly probable, to my mind, that during the next
summer there may be 100000 persons in the gold /
region digging for gold. But they will be scattered
over large extent of territory and You may depend
upon it, gentlemen, that there will be enough
for all. If Government and . Mint could only be
established in California the gold would be valuable
there as in New York. But such is the case at
present. AS evidence of this, may say that lots
in San Francisco when left were held and actually
sold at prices higher than lots of the size in
Wall street. That portion of the mining district !;
which l have visited, extends along the valley of
Sacramento and American Fork, about fifty miles I
above Suffers, and covers of about hundred
miles. One painful of common dirt in which the gold
is found, when carefully washed, yielded aver
age about half an ounce OF gold. 1t usually took i
about fifteen or twenty minutes to wash painful, !
provided the dirt was procured near the river or
washing place. Of course it takes time to dig /
the earth and carry it to the water. have known .
instances of persons going in search of gold, who
came back disappointed, unsuccessful They did not
fall into the right digging and did not get enough
to pay their expenses Those who fail generally
those who 90 in too large companies, those with
delicate constitutions, who break down under fatigue
and exposure. 1t is something of lottery to find
good /"" diggings."" When person company has
found right spot others are not allowed to dig in
the same hole, but they may dig near it. The ex-
elusive right to dig in the spot selected is however
only allowed while actually occupied by the digger.
There are but very limited facilities for storing goods
at San Francisco. should by all means recommend
that materials for ire-proof building storehouse
be sent around Cape Horn.


will now speak 10 you of the articles necessary
for outfit to California. In the first place. an India
Rubber Tent is, consider indispensable. This can
be procured in San Francisco less price than it
would cost to buy it here and transport it there
Every man who is going to dig pair of India
Rubber long stockings. These can be had in San |
Francisco; also in this city. pair of thick shoes
should be worn over the India Rubber stockinos to
prevent the gravel from cutting the feet of the Stock
ings, and thus admitting the water. The India Rub
Der stocking would prevent perspration from being
checked too suddenly, the labor of digging I'D the
earth will necessarily cause perspration which if
checked too suddenly, would certainly produce colds

furniture sufficient for his use but not more than
necessary for freight very high San francisco

to California who is doing well here. Ifhe is doiHp
well enough, let him stay. The inconvenience will
be very great such as always attends the settlement

Privations and difficulties; but to such as have GOOD
health, who are accustomed to labor and are doing
nothing here. or are laying up nothing saw by ali

by virtue of any constitutional grant, direct i'm

ed absolute civil power on the strength of miserable
fiction. We speak thus, the supposition that Gen.
Riley, in announcing himself Governor of California
can produce Presidential warrant for the act. True
his instructions. SO far published do not authorize
such act. The only published instructions, on
which he can rest this usurpation of authority,
contained in the following order:


ORDER No. II.


HEADQUARTERS 10TH MILITARY DEPT,


Monterey, California, May s, lS49


The following extract from the instructions of the Secre
tay Of War, to the Commander Of this Department. pub
lished for the information Of the people of CALIFORNIA;


Ii will be the duty of the commander cf military
force TO recognize the present Government de facto
spect the officers Of it, aud lend the aid to the military
force to protect the rights Of persons aud property Of the
habitants of the Territory Though ne has Iisht
change modify the existing civil Government, it will be
his dufu IN
changed by competent authority. He is directed to quiet
any uneasness which may exist in the minds Of the people
account Of their present anomalous state
that the Executive of the United States will do what apper
tain 10 him to remedy any nveniencs which they may
now experience to secure their rights aud to extend them
In the ampest manner ali the benefits Of political ns
tutons No doubt that such they will
main quiet under the existing Of things the proper
authority shall have time nlerpOse and provide them
with civil oganizaton securing them the adyan-
tages OF liberal Territorial Government, with such
sgements as will facilitate the settlement and promote
prosperity OF California


By order Of General Riley.


If there be no other instructions than these, Gen.
Riley has lranscended his powers-he is usurper
on his own account. The Secretary of War requires
the commander of the military force, TO recognise the
present Government of the Territory, de facto,
respect the officers of it, &c. Now, what was the
Government - Jacto,"" when Gen. Riley assumed
the command of the army Who were its officers
Not the Government which had existed while Califor-
MIA was under Mexican rule; not the officers, ap-
1
had long ceased TO exist-of those officers some, we
presume, had been killed, some had ed the authority
of others not recognized There was no Gov
ernment de tdcto,"" except the Provisional one FORM
ed by the People of San Francisco, and the govern
ment of Lynch Law established at the mines. But,
In full view of this state of things, the first of
Gen. Riley was, to recognise the civil Government
of California which had existed under Mexican rule,
but was not, de facto; to respect the officers
ated under Mexican sovereignty, many of whom were
no longer citizens of the Territory and few of whom
were recognized by the People OF California.


We say that, in all this, he plainly transcended his
published instructions. In denying the authority of
the San Francisco Government, he denied the author
| ity of the only de facto"" Government.


Nor do these instructions authorize him to assume
the GOvernorship of the Territory. Not n word is
said which can give color to such act of usurpa-
ton. And yet, in his proclamation to the People of
California, he says


""The undersigned in accordance with instructions from
the Secretary Of War, has assumed the administration Of
civil affairs in California no, military Governor but
the executive of the existing civil Government!''


If this be irue where are those instructions! Why
are they not made public! Let us have the letter
| from the Secretary of War, in which, by order of
Zachary Taylor, Brigadier General Riley is appointed
civil Governor of California with authority enforce
Mexican laws, TO appoint the Judges of the superior
courts and the projects, to fix the salaries of the off,
GERS OF the Government, and pay them out of the
customs, TO call Conventions of the People TO deter
/
mine the times and places of elections and the qual-
fcations of electors. Where is that letter? If there
he such one, then has the Administration peen guilty
OF an act of usurpaton unparalleled in the history of
the Federal Government See the miserable fiction
on which this audacious act is grounded


81 A brief summary of the organization of the pre-
sent Government"" says Gen. Riley, "" may not be
unnterestlng. 1t consists of Governor, appointed
by the Supreme Government; in default OF suc, ap-
pointment, the Office is temporarily vested in the
manding military officer Of the department""


The assumption made by the President is, that this
Mexican law or usage is yet in force in California.
This is the fiction which is made the groundwork of
a gross act of Despotism. 'The situation of Cali
fornia,"" says Gen. Riley, "" is almost identical with
that of Louisiana, and the decisions of the Supreme
Court, in recognising the validity of the laws which
existed in that country previous to its annexation
the United States, being not inconsistent with the
Constitution and laws of the United States repeal
ed by Legitimate Legislative enactment furnish clear
and safe guide in our present situation""


We beg leave to differ FROM the General and his
instructors this head. The Territory of Louisiana
was delivered to the United States in December
1913, and in March, 1904, just three months after,
Territorial Government, provided by Congress- was
in operation therein. The laws recognized by the
Supreme Court of the United States, were laws
relating to private rights, and not form of Gov
ernment. Order and justice require that the laws
protecting the people of Territory in the rights Of


property liberty, and the pursuit of happiness should
be recognized by the courts Of the sovereignty
supreme them. provided they be not inconsistent
with It's fundamental Constitution. matter though
they enacted by the sovereignty which trans
ferred them. This is the usage established by the
decisions Of Supreme Court, and in harmony with
common and natural justice. But what ha.
this TO do with the forms Of Gopernmentl They
concern the political rights of citizens, the per
sonal or private rights of individuals. What decs

OF this discretion, Governor Floyd gave them to

the heifer 60 The bull is feet 10 inches high.
and 10 feet inches in length, from the nose to the
end of the tail-the heer of proportonate size.
They are the most beautiful animals of the cattle
kind we have ever seen. Their limbs are as deli
cate as those of a gazee, yet strong and well set
as those of a race horse. Their heads have some
thing of the elegance of outline of deer their
nosirs are thin and flexible; their feet broad

These are the khalsis. Trimmed with garlands
of flowers they were taken up for the inspection
of the Presidents; and Old Zack, on first sight,
promptly declared that he had seen nothing in all
the Western country to compare with them. Col.
CastIeman is great stock raiser, and will doubt
Virginia by the introduction of these distinguished
Arabs. Lieut.. Lynch is to have the first full
booded bull calf, and the subsequent produce Of
of the breek at the Colonel's discretion. He says
he would not take $4,000 for the two, to-day-a
sum which they probably would have brought had
they been pnt up at auction in Richmond, with Il

A letter from California, in the same paper,
conlradicts the reports of Lynch law, murder, &c.
said to prevail there, and gives interesting ac-
count of a company of 1873 men, who adopt rules
for their government, which since the existence of

instance. He says

ing gold out with jack-knfe in four or five

will of The people represented by Judge Lynch.
We care not for the favorable statements reaching
US from that country, there have been already
received at Washington official accounts of anar-
chy and awlessness, prevailing 10 an alarming
extent and even should organized companies
ceed in producing order amidst all this chaos, it is
beneath the dignity of our institutions that thou
sands upon thousands of our citizens should be left
without the aid of the general government and
without the power of creating legislature of
their own. Too much is conceded to the patriot
Ism OF the people, though, doubt not, they will
never lack in its display, and that in a few short
years California will be knocking at the door of
Congress for admission into that Union, which
now much neglects it.

another lulI in the gold fever. Expeditions con.
tnue to depar. from various sections of the Union
but their number is small, compa ratvely speak
ing, and the excitement is bv no means SO high as
il was few weeks since. The first rush is over,
and those who depart now, do so more from re-
Election than BY impulse. The disposition is to
await further advices. Should the next news be
highly favorable, excitement will be pro-
duced, and thousands will rush forward under its
influence. We last week chronicled the departure
of several vessels from this port, and it will be
seen by our advertising columns, lha, several
others up for the land of promise. The
chances indeed are full of temptation, and the
terms are greatly reduced. AT least 20 600 per-
sons have departed from the Atlantic ports, while
the expeditions from the West during the present
spring, will embrace 10000 or 10000 more.

Just Compliment.-One of the very last acs of
President Polk to con fer upon the son Of the
ever-lamented SKUNK. the appointment of Cadet at
West Point, out of the number allotted to him.
He accompanied this appointment by the express
sion of his high regard for the deceased patriot.
and the hope that the youth might not fail TO fol-
low the example Of the father.

| BENToNvILLE, August 2lst, 1919.
Dear Ciarke:-Under the impression, that you
are anxious to know the result and finale Of Alfe,
! The murderer Of nderson, | make haste 10 detail
what took place on Yesterday before his execution.
Early IN the morning. the people began crowd
| ing in until it swelled to great multitude, such
a one as perhaps never assembled there before.
| There seemed to be various opinions, to the
proper course 10 pursue. Some were for deliver





| ford for trial and execution; and some for
| mary punishment. The near relatives of the
deceased were consulted, who said they delivered
him up to the people 10 do with him they
pleased. Finally, IL o'clock came, and there was
| no movement towards any definite course-still
there was no excitement amongst the multitude.
About this time, the Sheriff and Major Howard
appeared at The Court House steps, when The She.
riff called upon the people to draw near. Ma jor
Howard and addressed them. He COM
mended them for their GOODNESS, and said that It
was q fair indication that whatever they done
would be most apt to be right. He then condemn
ed, IN the strongest terms, all mobs and the prin-
clples of mobocracy. AT this juncturc, his nu-
merous friends began to suspect that he would
oppose any action Of summary character, for
they well knew his violent opposition TO all grades
OF mobs. He then recounted the history Of the
present case-the prisoners open confession, never
attempting TO deny doing the deed. and in all his
confessions suggesting no cause of defence, nor
did any person for him, and tina, it was the priso-
ner's own wish TO bo hung here, and not ca RI ed
to your County; therefore, his execution here
IN summary manner would not be characterized
by any act or spirit Of mobocracy. Why try
him ? There was no defence which he wished to
make, and II was mockery of common sense TO
go through the forms of law, merely for forms
sake. lie then requested those in favor of hang
ing then, TO move to The right, and those in favor
Vi ScuuIuS MN 10 crawford, 10 tho LETT. Every
person moved 10 the right. He then requested
those in favor Of citing a temporary gallows,
and hanging him at O'Clock, 10 move to the left
all went. Af said he had told lies about the
manner of killing his master, and wished to ex-
plain under the gaIlows. Here follows his con-
esslon as TO the manner of killing his master,
which we noticed last week. He was hung and
buried. more hardened, daring demon, never
died. Yours, in haste, &C.


We received letter from BentonvilIe on Thurs
day, in which we desired 10 say, that the ne
gro did not accuse the white man of ""insiigaitny
him TO commit the murder, but that he had been
brought 10 it by nssocia,ing with the white man.
The writer further says, that some persons were
afraid 10 risk the negro in The Van Burcn Jail for

horrible crimo.


FAYETTEVILLE, Aug. 10Th, 1919.
Dear Colonel:


We are quiet here. with the exception of the
excitement created by the murder Of Jas. Ander-
son in your county. The murderer, by the per-
suaslon of slave belonging TO McBroom, of Ben
ton Co., came in and surrendered himself on Mon
day night last.


By permission Of the citizens of Benton Co..
we had AlPh, the prisoner, here some three days,
for the purpose of ferrettng out supposed colIu-
sion between him and some free colored persons,
and some slaves of this place. We gained some
facts, tina: will enable us more effectuay 10 po-
lice our town in future.


John Smith, coored man, though free, was
by us, after investigating bis case on full exa-
mlnation turned over TO the Jaw, TO be dealt with
MS his offence deserves. His trial before an exa-
mining Court, will take place Oh Monday.


1t is said that AlPh, the prisoner, will be dealt
with or punished in summary manner, at Ben
tonvie, during tho first Of the coming week.
Bentonville, few days ago. There is
much excitement among the people. A commit
tee of investigation has been selected, &c. | do
moi pretend 10 anticipate the punishment they will
infilct, but it will doubtless be commensurate to
the offence.


learn to-day, that an Indictment was found
against said negro in your Court, during lis last
session. Had the people of Benton Co. known
Of this, before the Court adjourned, | have no
doubt but that they would have taken him down
Immediately for his trial.


p. S.--Snce the above was in type, we have
learned by gentleman direct from Benonve.
that tho negro was hung on Monday last. He
made full confession Of his guilt, while standing
on the scafiod, pointing with his finger at the
same time to white man who had, he said, in
stigated him 10 commit the murder. He had in
duced his master to get off his horse, by saying
that there was something the matter with his
horse's foot, and when the ground, made an
attack on him with club, and afterwards cut his
throat.


We learn that there was q number Of persons
present who objected TO the application Of Lynch
law, but upon its being put to vote, a largo ma
ority were in favor of it,.

 fha trail tph nds m ~iv manner along the preeipitous sides of the lofty mountains that prevail in this region. This section of country has been falsely said 10 furnish opportu- mites for good road or roads 10 California. From Lieut. Bealls description, It is aHoninuance of the most rugged and inaccessible mountains with vaat gorgts, peaks and declivities, covered perpetualy with snow, and presenting barriers to be passed oHy by incredible exertions. No track for a wagon, or any wheel vehicle can be made along this route The men could only press along the sscents by the aid of their hands we'll as their feet, and even tte tenacious mountain mules were often precipiiated trom the declvies, and rolling down the extensive slopes, were crushed to pieces, with every bone broken, and even their saddles so destroyed that they could not be farther used. This route the Gila frequently. as to avoid the barriers which constantly tut upon and overhang the stream. That ryer m this portion of its extent. is not susceptible of even canoe navigation Its current is of arro.y swiflness shooting over rocky and irregular falls, with serpentine windings. through narrow and dan- geous canons, that produce whirlpools and cascades which would engulf any watercrat entrusted to its eoatrol.

 After descending the Gila to it's confluence with the Colorado, and the latter stream 10 within fifty miles of the Gulf of California Lieut.. Beail and his htile party struck ont northward, across the inter- yenng desert, for San Francisco. This desert is very extensive, and more barren that of Zahara The weather here was intensely hot, and greatly afflicted the men, who had been scffsIing amid the the frosty rigors of the mountains. but now found themselves in an arid sandy plain deprived of water except such as they bore with them. travel of one hundred and twenty miles brought them, how ever, oh the lst of April, in sight of the welcome dweliings of San Francisco, and in the vicinity of those gold regions that surpass in prolific wealth The HesPeEIan gardens of antiquity,

The rage for gold, like the rod of Aaron, had swallowed up all other pas sions The inhabitants would not even take time to erect for themselves the necessary edifices but were residing in tents, and shnnes hastily erected The extent of the gold region cannot he defined. i l has already been found to cover territory more than hundred and fifty miles in length, and from fifty 10 sixty in breadth. The precious metal is discovered in perfectly pure state in the beds of the streams, and in the hills and plains adjacent. found in small particles or flakes in the water, mingled with sand, which has only to be washed ! away to leave residue of fine gold; and in the dry diggins"" 1t exists in solid Jumps, some weighing etght or ten pounds. which are dug up with pick { axes and spades. The iaborcrs generally prefer . working tn the streams, the other method is the most laborious. Every Iaborer can certainly secure each day. al east twenty dollars worth of the metal while those who fortunate frequently make from cue to two hundred dollars.

 Lieut. Besl showed us specimens of gold he had procured in the country, of both varieties, in parti cIe. and the lump. One specimen was well caIcu- lated to make the eyes stare aud I"" ips water"" It a solid lump. weighing eight pounds, and worth . S2toO of the pure, rosy gold!

 It is impossible to compute the number of per 1 sons now in California. No eensus could be taken, for they are scattered everywhere through it's ex- tenve forests prosecuting the quest for the root of all evil. Still the utmost good order prevails in the : country; they have regular laws but the large 1 infusion of intelligent and upright inhabitants pre- serves peace and quiet. by species of modified | Lynch jurisdiction, which necessity has created | They do not complain. as has been said, of want of government, for they have not time, in their { more expressing avocaton, to think Of such things.

 Lieut.. Beall informs us that the rumor of a mu- tiny on the Ohio is without foundation, as every thing was in most perfect state of subordination that vessel the night before he left Gov. Smith having entrusted him with dispatches for our gov erument, he took passage from San Francisco on the 18th of April, board the steamer Oregon, for Panama. The steamer touching at San Bias, and ! remaining three days for fuel, he received informa tOn from party of Mexcans who had been trading among the lndans of the safe arrival in the country d Col. Fremont and party. That gallant officer had proceeded across the desert for san Francisco

 After trip of about twenty days, the Oregon { arrived at Panama. Here Lieut..

 had some fears of the Camanehe Indians be- tween Arkansas and Sante Fe. We saw one large company of men, squaws and children, that visited our encampment--they opDearsd to want to be neTy friendly. We passed through the whole Indian country to this place unmOlested. Our company was quite large, but some got to dsobeying orders, and Capt billiard resigned, which split the company all to pieces. Since then we have been travelling in dangerous part of the country, where .he Indians have been committing dcpreda- lions upon the whites; and they actually murdered two men within , miles of us There scouting parties in all directions after the Indians. We had an escort of United States troops, under Cap tain Marcy. as far as Saute Fe. l We expected the Government would furnish an escort from Sanle Fe to San Francsco but. to our great disappointment. will have no such protec ton. We have yet to travel a very great distance through a country much more dapgerous than that l througl, which we have passed

 Our dsorganized company are getting together again, and in few days will elect their officers, and will then be better prepared to afford protec- tion.

 | expect we will stop about two weeks, soon, to rest and recruit our teams; they stood the journey very we'll until about POO miles back, when they began to become jaded and lean.

 It is about 1000 miles from where we started, in Hot Spring county, Ark, to Sante Fe; and is called l,Jq0 from Sante Te to the Bay of San Francisco: ""a long. long tiresome road, and We have yet more than l 800 miles to travel.

No one thinks ofcult,vating the soil. The plough has been forgotten for the last two years. Carpenters can scarcely be induced 10 work, and when they consent tc do anything they receive $i3 per day.

the pillar from which it was taken rise nearly 40

There are various modern theories as TO this
trans siormaton of Lots wife. Salt, it is known,
abounds IN the vicinity Of the Dead Sea, and one
theory is, tina! the erring woman, in disobediently
stopping to look back, as her favored family fled
over tho plain from the doomed city; was smi,ten
with death. and became encrusled with SALT thus

months since, an expedition was ftted cut by ou

has been successfully prosecuted, and Lieut.. Lynch
it is expected, will at early day present the pub.
ne with history of II. late number of the Wash
ingten Union contains letter from that gentleman
from which we make the following extracts:


'' When the small party, Just returned from the
Dead Sea; first entered upon its waters, its members
eames and all, to the conclusion, that having un-
dertaken what others failed to accomplish the honor
OF the American name was at stake and that it was
better to die like them than to return unsuccessful
On the evening of the 9Th day, however, on the
Southern sea, we were prostrated by the hot blasts
OF SIMEON, sweeping from the desert of Arabia,
which was followed by FIVE days of intense and sti-
fling heat On the afternoon of the 14th day, the
coast OF Moab, to our surprise, were greeted by
deputation of Christians from Kerak, the Keiiath
Moab of the Bible.


The Joy of this people at meeting as was unboun-
ded: They caressed US, brought US water, (sour
mhk,) all they had, and some Of them spent nearly
the whole night hunting wild boar, wherewith to
regale US. When told them that our forms of
worship in America different from theirs, they
replied: ss What matters it? Christ died for all!
Do you not believe in him !? When told that we did,
they said: '.Then what are forms before God We
are brothers ~ And brothers they continued to call
US to the last. ...


We could not trace their origin, but concluded that
they are either the descendants of one of the last
tribes converted to Christianity, who, in the fast
ness of the mountains, had escaped the Mahomme-
dan alternative of the Koran or the sword; or the
crusaders under the Christian Lord of Kerak. They
number about $50 families, and live in the town
the only one now left, in the populous'country
OF Moab. Within the walls are also the huts of 100
Muslin families, and outside the block of
the fierce tribe kera-Keyeh, numbering $50 fighting
men, ....- =,
The Norfolk Beacon. speaking of the curiosities
brought by Lieut.. Lynch from the Dead Sea, says:


'Among the curiosities belonging to Government
brought home in the U. S. Storeship Supply, the
following particularly worthy of mention, as cal
culated to excite degree of interest which seldom
attaches to such things:


number of specimens of the water of the Dead
Sea. the River Jordan, and the Pool of Sloan: and
fragments of the pillar of salt into which Lots wife
was transformed as punishment for her disobedi-
ence to the command of the Almighty.


In regard to this last, are informed that the
pillar from which it taken, rises nearly 40 feet
high, standing exactly in the spot designated by the
Bible, and that Lieut. Lynch, the Commander of the
Dead Sea Expedition, expresses the confident opin-
ion that it is the representative of what was Lots
wife. We believe it has not been seen before for
many centuries Josephus records its existence.


The many other curiosties board the Sup
ply, as an Egyptian Mummy, pair of the cattle of
Arabia, rosaries made of wood from the holy mount,
s
The New York Herald, probably on the authority
of Lieut. Lynch, denies that he said this pillar
of salt is the representative of what was Lots
wife, The idea that it is, is of course absurd.


This is the first time the Dead Sea has ever been
successfully explored. Some years since an expe-
dition was fitted out by the English Government,
but the men Were all murdered by of the fierce
tribes that exist in the country bordering that Sea.

the line IS going forward rapidly. This is the
thoroughfare in the State. Even in these dull times
teams are continually passing to and from the city,
over the road. .. e+..s--.r- Ia - 4. .-t5


The city is sdestined reap rich harvest by means
of these roads. Plank roads make business. Every
good farmer keeps a team, and with good roads and
low toll at all seasons, a vast amount of produce,
wood, &C., &C., will be brought to market by those
who have not been able to do so heretofore. This
Will create greater competition in the market, and
enable all to purchase the necessaries much cheaper
AT the same time the profits of the producer will be


increased from the fact that larger loads be drawn
and teams turned to better account -Fz
We hope to see the charters granted. in 184s IN
various parts of the State, taken, and the work com


menced. The charters of the Detroit and Saline the
Detroit and Utica, the Detroit and Erin, the Jackson
and Lansing, &C.. &c., are all good, and the. several
routes lay through the best parts of the State. The
stock will not only be good, but the increased fac-
tiles to farmers will tend to open and settle the IN
occupied lands. Every farmer who has any spare
means should be stockholder in the road which is
nearest to his farm. Detroit Free Press


NORWEGIAN WATER TELEscoPEs An instrument
which the people of Norway have found of so great
utility that there is scarcely single fishing boat with
out one is the water telescope or tube, of three or
four feet in length, which they carry in their boats
with them when they go fshing When they
reach the fishing grounds, they imnerse one end of
this telescope in the water, and look through the
U,t,T Eef,o
oms deep distinctly as if they were within few
feet of the surface; by which means, when shoal
of fish comes into their bays, the Norwegns Instant


y prepare their nets, man their boats, and 90 out in
pursuit. The first process is minutey to survey the
ground with their glasses, and where they find the
fish swarming about in great numbers they give the
signal and surround the fish with their large draught
nets, and often catch them in hundreds at a time


Without these telescopes, their business would often
prove Precarlons and Improbable, as the fish, by
these glasses, distinctly seen in the deep clear
sea OF orway, as gold fish in a crystal jar This
instrument is not only used by the fishermen but il

From the Alta California, published at San
Francisco: ---.


Populafion.--Our streets present q busy and
populous appearance. In the business portion OF
town the highways so thronged with drays,
wagons, and people, that it is sometimes difficult
to push way through the crowd. The population
has increased more than one hundred per cent.
within the last three months, and the new business
establishments have increased in a still greater
ratio.


The Public HealM--The general health of the
5000 inhabitants of San Francisco, is good. Re.
Gently some deaths have occurred from diarrhoea
and dysentery, and many are now suffering from
one the other Of these Diseases but the sickness
is abatng. Somo solicitude is felt in regard tc
cholera and shipfever but the general opinion is
that none of these diseases can spread in such a
climate as this. although it is highly probable thai
. out of 10 cases would prove fatal.


HOspHdbie.-Several large and well arranged
hospitals are now established in the CITY. 1t is
very gratifying to know that the afflicted are moi
Likely to suffer for want of proper medical atten
dance and care.

belonged to the fraternity of .'Hounds,"" who ha
so long prowled about an1 disturbed the peace
His offence was burglary and theft, and his tria
was by jury--his sentence death by hanging. III
scas erecuted Nth the unanimous opproUal of lii
people of Stockton.


""a number of men, implicated in offence.
committed by the same gang, have been arrested
and their trial will soon take place. The prompt
action of our citizens in these matters has restored
law and order to the place, and we feel more Sc
cure now than we have for six months past''


Later advices confirm the above account, anc
add that one or more others convicted, were pu
nished with rigid observance of the ba rba rous
forms of Judge Lynch such as shaving the head
topping the ears, and other dsgracefuI mutiIations
of the person. 1t is to be hoped that these latter
reports were not well founded.


Advices from Stockton furnish intelligence o
another execution. The notorious Red Davis
or ""Old Red"" alias Davis, was captured in Santa
Clara, taken TO Stockton, and hung u few day:
since.

in his expedition to the Dead Sea, thus
describes curious head dress which the
women about Beyroot wear:


The most striking pecularity of dress
we saw, was the tautur or horn, worn
mostly by the wives Of mountaineers. 1t
was fourteen inches to two feet long,
three or four inches wide at the base,
and about one inch wide at the top. 1t is
made Of tin, silver or gold, according to
the circumstances of the wearer, and it is
sometimes studded with precious stones.
From the summit depends veil, which
falls upon the breast, aud at will, conceals
the features. 1t is worn only by married
ones of the highest rank, and once as
sumed it is worn for life. Although the
temple may throb, and the brain be racked
with fever, it cannot be laid aside. Put
on with the bridal robe, it does not give
place to the shroud 1t is supposed to
have some reference to the words, ""The
horns of The righteous shall be exalted"""

Seduction By the Wholesale, at HARRISBURG, Pa.
Jonathan Gibbons Mills, surgeon dentist, emf
grated from Lancaster city, and settled here two
years since. He is villain Of the first degree.--
He brought bis first wife TO premaiu lure grave by
his cruelty and neglect. Some few months ago,
a poor girl brought charge of forncation and
bastardy gainst him. which he was enabled. tbro'
her wants, to settle. for small pecuniary consi.
deratlon. During this period he was aging at,en-
lion to the eldest of three daughters of one of our
most respectable citizens, who is a widower. The
father having heard Of this last affair, and also
other particulars regarding Mills, forbade him his
house. Mills. finding himself foiled in his open
visits, resorted TO covert means CT meeting the un
suspectng sisters at his Office and in the streets
TO each of whom it is said he made promises of
mar riage; and SO well arranged were his plans
and successful his delusons that neither of the





evlng him 10 be sincere in his attachments, and
looking forward TO the future. when every obsta.
Gle should be removed from their union. In this
manner he accomplished their ruin ard it is said
that letter sas Been discovered, written by Mills
IN which he declared his intention Of DESTROYING
the peace of the family, in consequence of his
summary election from the house by the father.
Mills was arrested and taken before Esq. Sny-
deri on a warrant for forncation and basar rdy,
the second sister having concealed her pregnancy
until the day before yesterday. Not being able
10 procure ball. he offered to marry the mother of
the child, and the worthy justice conveyed the in
teIgence 10 the family. What was his .a.lonish.
ment and horror, to learn that the heart. broken
parent had discovered that the next youngest
daughter was enceinte by Mills also. On this be-
ing. Known, the popular feeling savored strongly
of the application of Judge Lyhch's code TO the
culPr, while ihe father, almost distracted with
sorrow, loaded his musket, intending to have sum-
mary vengeance on the dospoiler of his peace and
his family. The villain, to himself from be-
ing lynched. made speedy retreat TO 'aiI, where
he is now awaiting the various ACTIONS, which will
result IN some seven or ten years in the Penitcn-
tary. This affair has thrown gloom ever our
whole community - Harrisburg paper"

desirable-they therefore elected Gen. Taylor
