Ii the cause of Mr.. Clay were one upon which even
one member of the North Carolina Legislature has

have bad way of showing it. fit were to prac-
tice fraud and deception upon the people, and bar
gain away the Presidency without their consent,
they have taken the first steps, and acted wisely in
""keeping the thing dark"" And these men

FUN ON BOARD A STEAMBOAT.",,"! Not long since a Gambler had a game played
upon him by the deck hands and firemen on board
one of our Western Steamers game even
stronger than that played by Second NUM-
cipality on this class of the community in New
Orleans.


Ii seems that he had made out to strike up al
small game of poker with some OF tho deck
hands, and that by dint Of cheating, putting up
the cards, and other tricks known only to those
up to, and who make a living by, ""handng the
papers,"" he had transferred nearly all the sur
plus revenue from their pockets into his own.-
He scut and shuAied'' to all appearances fair f,r
some time, but was finally caught at some trick,
which at once led the honest stcamboatmen into
the secret of show the thing was DONE"" and
proved that they lost their money by any other
than the '.clean thing


The game, as matter OF course, was blocked
at once, and demonstration Immediately made
that the Gambler should fork over his ill-gotten
gains This he fatty refused to do; said that he
| had won the money fair, and that he was. very
clear of parting with what he had come honestly
by They still persisted, and he still refused.


The boat tleng,h stopped to wood, when the
men, finding it useless to attempt regalnlng their
money by fair means, resorted to plan which
1.-The Gambler undoubtedly thought foul. Having
gained the consent of the engineer to use the en-





lexecuon-a plan rather bordering on that code
of laws generally known as coming under the es-
pecai jurisdiction of Judge Lynch.


They in the first place made one end of rope
fast to the neck of the wondering Gambler, while
the other was tied to the end Of the piston rod,
allowing him two or three feet slack. They told
him that unless he shelled out their money in
staner, they would work the engine, and at the
same time that they were not responsible for any
injuries he might sustain. 10th to give up his
gains, the fellow cast one look at the new system
Of extoron coolly calculated his chances, and
then told them they mig ght ''work away and be
d-d.""


No sooner said than done, and the Gambler
was Immediately seen chasing the piston rod upon
all fours, and then backing out of lis way. His
eye all the time was as firmly set on the rod as
ever that of Herr Cline or Gabriel Ravel was
upon the tight rope. After working forward and
backward several times, one of his tormentors
asked him:


Don't you think it best to hand over!'


Don't bother me-, retorted the Gambler.


you'll get sick of that fun said another of
the boatmen, as he was following the piston rod
up in the attitude of bear.


''Not as you know on rejoined the Gambler
as he backed out of the way.


In this way they ran upon the poor fellow for
some time, he still manfesting an unwillingness
10 give up his spos. BY this time all the cabin
passengers had heard Of the fun going OH below,
and went down to witness it. After few mo-
ments respite, the engine again set in mo-
ton, and the Gambler along with it,. The laugh
from the by standers boisterous and hearty
in the extreme, the poor fellow, intent upon
nothing but his own safety, followed the piston
rod up to prevent his neck being jerked off, and
then backed ont of its way to avoid being fairly
run over and crushed. We can liken his look
and actions to nothing old bear being
dragged by chain up to some point against his
will, and backing out the moment a foot of slack
was given him; or else to a savage and hungry
bull dog, with rope round his neck, fiercely en-
deavoring to get at some prey, and then being
dragged back the moment his mouth was opened
10 secure it.


Fire and fall back, was heard from an indivi-
dual in the crowd.


Root hog, or die, came from another.


'Twg him-only lookn says one.


Here he goes, there he goes said second


'Ha, ha, he, he, hi, hi, ho, no. laughs another.


Alnt he in pretty fix cried still third.


Serves him right said fourth.


Good enough for him, said a fifth the piston
rod all the while keeping in full exercise, with
the perspration rolling down his cheeks in
streams


'Aint you most ready to hand over now!' said
one of the plucked deck hands.


Don't bother me, say retorted the Gambler,
if you do, III lose my lick


Won't you give up the money! said another
of those he had feeced.


If do, do; but if | do, I'm be DID, con-
tnued the companion of the rod. I've got the
hang of this game-understand the principles ofl
this machinery now, and you may work me
from end of the Mississi ippi to the other, be-
fore I'll give up the first red cent-that you may
The Gambler was worked in this way until
the boat was ready to start, without fnching or
showing any disposition to give up. Consider
ing that they had got the worth of their money
out Of him i'll the shape Of fun, and that he had
worked hard and afforded sufficient amusement to
more than compensate for their odd bits and pic
ayunes, the engine was stopped and the man lie,
| loose.


After putting, blowing, and wiping the perspi-
ration from his face the Gambler looked at his
tormentors with sef-sa,is6ed air, and exclam-
ed, You can't come it over this child with any
of your common games. I've stood three pluck
one too often to be blufed off, even if there was"
