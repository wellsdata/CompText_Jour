base ball of the season was played at Presump-
scot Park, Saturday afternoon, between the
King Philips of Rockland, Mass, and the
Resolutes of this city.


To give an extended account of the game
would be but to chronicle errors, but suffice it
to say the batting on both sides was heavy and
the fielding very poor. In the sixth inning
Kimball made splendid three-base hit, and
Wilson fine two.base hit


The Resolates Nine was not as strong as
usual. Payson and Lynch being absent, their
places were filled by Evans and Kimball of the
Dry Goods Nine.

galleries extending around three sides, and
two doors in ffont and one in the rear. Most
OF the lives were lost at the front doors. Mr..
Lynch, the fireman who was first to arrive on
the ground, says the scene was appalling.
Wedged tight and immovable in the doors
was q dense mass of humanity, while over
them sheets of fire rolled like b wave, stream
ing far out into the open air The hydrant
stream was at once turned in the door, The
fire department arrived shortly after and the
fire was attacked SO vigorously that the

Virginia Valley, and in the special care of at
tached friends, recuperation of his forces

was to draw dirt and fill up the ditch as comren-

exciting to be interesting. The people
of Los Angeles are threatened with
losses by fire that they can Ill afford.
The city is infested with band Of
rascals who must be ferreted out and
brought to justice or driven hence. Of
the four fires which followed each
other in rapid succession between mid
night and daylight yesterday morn-
ing, three, and probably four, were set
by incendiaries. The man who fired
the hay in the engine-house stable was
seen to do his work, but he escaped
without Identification. We learn that
q man was seen to leave the rear of
DOTTER & BRADLEY's furniture store
q moment before the alarm was given.
We mention these facts in support of
our theory that these fires are the
work of an organized band, and to
warn our citizens to be on their guard.
If the police are vigilant we shall soon
know who is firing the city. We are
no advocate of violence or lynch law,
but If a man is shot in the act of firing
a building and we are on the jury that
tries his slayer, we shall favor ver-
dict of not guilty. Some years ago
the city of Stockton was threatened
with destruction by the incendiary
torch, but after great deal of prop
erty had been burned every citizen
constituted himself policeman with
power to shoot at and hit house e-burn-
ers. After this step was taken confla-
grations ceased. The people of Los
Angeles should initiate this example.
If they do, we shall not record any
more destructive fires."

Mr. Farrell objected to the report.
lie was opposed to the sending of the
contract away from this city, and was
turher opposedto extending the sewer
with an iron pipe. He thought the
sever should be built of brick, as the
ron pipe should be likely to sink deep

Mr.. McMenamin said the pipe would
be laid upon planking and would not
settle, 1t was to run through a street

Little Breeze I'm Councti-n.


Dhi and the Comment IL Occssion.S",,"nu and the Comment II Occasioned>


AS will be seen by our Council pro.
cceolngs, elsewhere, the Water Com.
mittee, last evening, reported adverse.
on the bill of Ex-Councilman Mviso
Burke, for damages done his proner,v
6y the laying OF water pipes along
jackson street. The report occasion.
ed O long, tedious and at times acri-
monious discussion. A few of The
spirited points are annexed.


MIR. Farrell was of the opinion that
INC opposition to Mr.. Burke's claim
was OF personal nature, and thct
tnose opposing him would ""sav no
tllI hell froLc over"" to use their own
language. wv""


Mr.. Lynch thought the breaking Of
the drain (Which caused the damagel
was occasioned by either the laziness
or negligence of the men engaged in
digging the trench for the water mines
on jackson street Some of these men
had even been criminally negligent. as
they left the trench uncovered for
several days, and while it was half
luil OF water, little boy fell in and
was drowned.


NIT: Farrel went further and credited
the above mishaps to the drunkenness
and lneompetency of one of the fore.
man. He also said that when Mr..
Burke offered to verify the truth and
correctness of his claim by oath, tho
gentleman from the Seventh Ward
(hr. VIM. Canby) said at committee
meeting, that ""he would not believe
him on his oath.""


Mr.. Candy denied the soft impeach.
ment, and Mr.. Farrell referred to the
other members of the Water Committee
for proof.


Mr.. Hayes defended the workmen
who dug the trench for pipes on Jack
son street, by saying that it was i'm
possible to keep the trenches properly
covered and protected at all times. Mr.,
hayes also supported the committees
report on Mr.. Burke's bill.


The discussion continued until after
o'clock, when Mr.. Bickta arose and
sad the whole proceedings were too
TN, (thinl and wanted the subject
laid over one week.


A half hour of discussion followed.
when the report was amended SO as
to allow Mr.. Burke $2S, the cost of re.
pairing his cellar and drain, after
which it was adopted.


1t is probable that Mr.. Burke will
decline this award and have his claim
legally settled."

ure. There Will be some peaches, few
plums and fair crop of apples, but no qulnces
and very few pears.
SUrTER-The crops compare favorably with
last year. Many fields of wheat and barley
and none less than twelve. The farmers have
begun heading their barley and many are
ready to begin on the wheat fields.


TEHAMA-The crops are a little short, but
many fields will be an immense yield. A
number of farmers report over forty bushels
to the acre.


TULARE-The seoson has been unfavorable,
but thousands of bushels will be harvested
where a failure was anticipated a few weeks
ago.


YeLo-About a two-third crop is expected.
Harvest has been commenced.


THE GRAIN MARKET.


Chicago has accumulated 5000, 900 bushels
of wheat, which spectators are holding for an
expected rise. The Illinois crop is estimated
at one-half of the average, yet the tendency
of prices in Chicago is downward. In San
Francisco quotations are as follows:

WOOL.


The New York and Boston markets have
been dull, owing to anticipated heavy receipts
of California Spring The following transac-
tions have taken place in New York;


One hundred and fifty thousand pounds new
Spring California, at 2294 cents for short and
bury lots, and 30@35 cents for choice free
$4,000 lbs. do. old stock at 2Sg3O cents: 100000
DIS. Fall do. at 1920 ceLts; 5000 bags secured
at 62970 cents.


Boston reports as follows:


fsnl; ,to
freely, rnd the stock is now increasing quite
rapidly. Sales have been large, comprising
430 900 tbs., at 2293Sc. for Spring and 22la9341a
for Fall. Some of the recent arrivals have
been ofa very handsome quality, and in con-
sequence higher range of prices has been
sustained. Although the market is consid-
cred easier for this description, to buy and
lots will not bring over 3O@s2c. up to 34c. for
choice; and any advance on the latter rate Is
obtained only for fany lots.


OUR LOCAL MARKETS.


Our mills are doing fair business, and the
outlook for good crop is very encouraging to
farmers and millers. Our market rates are
only slightly above San Francisco figures for
flour and grain.


LUMBER MARKET.


With the large number of improvements
now in operation and many more under con-
tract, the lumber trade shows no appreciable
falling off. We are informed by Perry, Wood
worth & Co. and f1rifhth, Lynch & Co., who
control the lumber market here, that there is
every prospect Of brisk Summer and Fall
season, The quotations of last week hold
good.


LIVE STOCK.


Good stock is scarce, but farmers are begin
ming to learn the importance of improving
their breeds of stock. We may reasonably
expect in short time to see q decided inn
provement in the quality of the stock coming
to this market. Our pastures are unexcelled
on the coast, and our great herds should take
a prominent place in the stock annals of the
State. The following are the qotations:


Cattle dressed, &c.; hogs, 5@51ac. gross sheep
81 6O9S2 each; milch cows, S3OgS8O
THE RETAIL MARKET.


No change In the price of staple groceries.
Butter is becoming more plentiful at 30 cts.
for good to 25 cts. for inferior.


Oranges and lemons are scarce and hardly
quotable.


Eggs are in good supply at 30 cents per
dozen.


Vegetables are plenty at fair prices, and
small fruits, principally strawberries, are
coming down in price within the reach of the
masses."

AUGUSTA, Ga, Aug. 22.-The threatened war
OF races which caused much excitement and alarm In
half dozen counties of Georgia last week. and which FOR


few days seemed likely to lead to serious consequences
for one for both races, has happily been averted
without violence bloodshed. AS far as can be
ascerained here in Augusta, 1t originated In an
insane desire the part OF three or four idle ana
turbulent negroes to gain noorety and power these


men took advantage OF their prominence and influence
among the people OF their race and Of the ignorance and
credulity Of their followers and by manipulating the
military or semimilitary organizations to which
majority OF the coOred people belong, were able TO draw
into the plot great number of naturally quiet and law
abiding negroes These latter had cause for discon-
tent and grievances TO redress They do not know,
even now of any for the contemplated uprising


The alarm OF the white people in the counties EN-
braced III the plot perfectly natural Ihe agricui-
ural population of the South is much more scattered
than in the North Southern plantations are generally
larger than Northern farms and the proportion OF land
not under cultivation Is greater The result is that the
dwellings of tire white people often at considerable
distances from each other. In the event OF serious
trouble they would be very difficult 10 de-
fend Besides this, the colored population
in the cotton belt of this and adjoining states
far outlubers the Whites ana while the latter knew OF
uo cause for hostility the part of the blacks they did
not know into what the freedmen might Dc lea
Various things occurred excite apprehension Letters
were found, the contents OF which have already oeen
made public Confessions were made by some OF the
negroes first arrested. Vague rmors and reports were
circulated that large bodies OF armed negroes were
marching through the country camped in the woods.
Exaggerated stories that always gain currency on such
occasions aud grow with every repetition also added
fuel 10 the flame, and really increased the danger that
conflict w0uld actually take place.


The discovery tic plot of course put an end at once
to the possibility OF its execution But this has been the
point in than in the South, since the close
Of the war; where the serious trouble has actually peSun


Unnecessary shooting undertaking, and lynching have
in many eases seemed 20 be the almost inevitable result
of excitement such as has prevailed in this vicinity
during the past week and it the fear that such
scenes as occurred in Grant Parish ana Cousha't IN
Louisiana and Western Tennessee, would be repeated IN
Burke Washington and Jefer son Counties IN ts otale


that gave the welwishers Of Georgia the most concern
This danger, If 1t ever existed has now entlfeIy
passed, and the people have been saved from
\ DISGRACE Which would have been greatly,
dopoyed by every good citizen OF the State white ana
black Residents OF the counties in which the excite
mert and alarm prevailed assert that Illegal violence
toward any the prisoners never talked OF or con-
empated Public sentiment has all of the time been IN
favor of resorting only TO legal means Of punishment.
The prudent course of smith, in refusing to sendt to
the disturbed counties any men from Augusta
or otIcr places. tended probably as much
AS ANYTHING preserve the peace HAD seVera nun
red mon gone from Augusta or elsewhere 10 Wayhes-
boro and sandersve Thursday last the danger that
some ,ndscreet or drunken fellow would have committed
some act OF violence and perhaps precptated serious
conflict would have been very great.


Gov smith attended by two members Of his staff Wis
tied sandersve yesterday. The people OF Washington
County white and black turned out in great numbers 10
receive him. In speech, which he made from the Court
house steps, he advised the negroes to be
av-abding, and coanseed the white people 10 DC calm
and orbearing and TO let the law be vincated IN the
propar manner The effect Of his speech was excellent

,c ronfesons OF the negroes who have been arrested
assert that the three leaders in whose names all orders
were issued were Joseph Norris candy iiafas, % anu
Prince Rivers OF South Carolina. Rivers noids MAJOR
generals commission in the South Carolina militia and is


member Of the Legislature M Gf tna ,rom re and

Of Great popular excitement and when he himself has
been threatened he has called 1t out He took no
mart in the troubles which occurred In Edgeed County
last Fall, although he was acquainted with those
nnco cod I'm IL on both sides. 1t Is hardly
nrohable that he would think Of coming
over into this state for any such purpose.
The report that he give the plot his support Win
10 600 soldiers was calculated to give the negroes
courage impress them with the importance OF the
Undertakings but probable that his name was used
wholly without his knowledge consent. Norris who
probably planned the whole affair, has not yet been
arrested Candy Harris has voluntarily surrendered, and
demands an investigation OF the accusations against him.
Judge Herschel "" johnson will hold special term OF
the Court In Washington County on Monday, the 3Oth,
for the investigation Of the whole affair Reports from
ali he counties represent the excitement abated, aud
no further trouble Is anticipated."

PRETTY AND FANCY ARTICLES.


The fair or ST. Anneis church, in East Twelfth

by tue rector. Vicar General Preston, and has
assistant, Rev. Father Lynch, TO bring about q

10 help nqudate tue heavy debt which has been

the tables literally loaded with articles OF

terest. Music BY the seventh Regiment
Band ADDS an additional attraction to
the religious enterprise, and the crowds that were

cerely the Vicar Generals enorts are appreciated
in bringing ST. Anne's 20 a high status among tne

The Investigating Committee further pursued
its inquiry into the charges laid against the Wa
ter department, last evening, making further
examination of witnesses touehing the second
specihcAtion--givlng away city property for lit
tie or no consideration. Mr.. Adams was pre-
sent for the first time since the investigation be-
gan, he having been unayodably kept away,
and all the members of the committee were in
their seats.


Washington Hyde was further examined Ad-
dihonal to men employed in yuarrying in Second
street was Thomas Holersn, who was engaged
for 1917 days at II. so per day.


John Price examined Am quarryman and
and worked in the ditch in 2nd street, near Van
buren; was engaged there from the commence
ment OF the removal of the stone until it was
completed; the stone as taken out was piled up
ON the side OF the street next to MIR. Ford's
building; lot Of the stone was taken away
about week before the job was fmished in my
judgment didn't think there was much less
than hundred perch taken out of the ditch;
about third OF the stone was unit for build
ing purposes; the remainder WAC good building
stone; the stone was not all moved away when
the work was finished; one afternoon Mr. Ford
sent two carts and five or six men TO move the
stone away, and they began work at about
O'Clock and were still at work when we left; the
stone was moved across the street.


By Mr.. Adams my Judgment that there WAS
100 perch was based on the suppoeltion that 80

By Mr.. Lynch the stone was difficult to get
out and was done by small blasts.

tempts to raise a bushel of this grain

made by Mr.. Lynch Turner, chairman
of committee of the Pulaski grange
in this state, appointed 10 examine
into the cause of smut in wheat. having
wide circulation in agricultural papers
as Il matter of fact to be relied on by
farmers. The report of this committee
was first published in the Rural sun,
with editorial Endorsement. The mate
rial part of the report is copied into the
Rural New Yorker which SAYS: This
is an important subject, and one which
oranges, farm clubs and individual
farmers throughout the country should
investigate. This association of farm
ers recently becoming so popular and
successful, inauguratcs n new era in
the progress of American agriculture.
etc.


The error into which Il half dozen
agricultural papers have been led and
the Pulaski grange committee in the
first start of this nominal investigation.
has its origin in the fact that all these
intelligent and respectable writers for
the press entirely overlook the careful
observations and studies of men of
science, aided by microscopes applied
to the investigation of parasites ON
wheat during the last two hundred
years. This is one among a thousand
cases where book knowledge has great
value to the farmer to prevent serious
mistakes. Not to do Mr.. Turner a
seeming injustice, we copy from hi,
published report H. follows:


This is small, browni,h bug.
about the size of buffalo gnat, which
makes its appearance soon after harvest
times, and deposits its eggs in the cleft

Southern California will show that
they remember the men who have
been true on the railroad question.
Johnson, the Democratic nominee for
LieutenantGo will get many
Republican votes because of his manly
support of the Texas Pacific bill when
he was member of Congress. And
Houghton will be voted for by hosts of
Democrats who appreciate his splendid
fight last Winter, standing alone for
the interests of the people against the
attempt of the Central Pacific monol-
oily to obtain control Of the California
end of the Texas Pacific road.

The correspondent of the Union at
San Luis Rey, writing under date of
July 9th, says:


A petition for the execution Of the
law in the case of Alipas is being cir
culated here and meets with the gen.
eral approval of all good citizens of
this community. It's publication in
the Union is desired, as you have al
ready published the petition for COM
mutation. Let both be seen by the
public:


To His Ercellency Hon. r. Pdcheco.
The undersigned, your petitioners, re-
spectfully request that the sentence of
the law be carried out in the case of
Belisario Alipas and we respectfully
protest against the efforts now being
made by certain parties in San Diego
to have Alipas' sentence commuted.
Those parties live far from the scene of
the murder and are not acquainted
with Alipas or the class Of men with
whom he associated. There is large
population of SonOranians in this vi
cinity and they are only deferred from
committing murder by the fear of their
lives. There is every reason to believe
that several of them were privy to the

We have been considerably surprised to learn,
from the Baltimore Mirror of a most ridiculous
exhibition OF intolerance and bigotry the
part OF some of the leading Protcstants of
Northumberland County, Va. For the first
time in its history a Catholic Bishop
visit the county aud speak in the courthouse
at Lancaster, which had bsen secured two
weeks before for the occasion Says the nara
tor: "" The separated brethren resolved on the
very day OF the lecture to fol bid this honorable
and learned gentleman the use of the court
house. The parties had arrived on the ground
when the messenger came (who was no less a
parsonage than the county judge), saying ey
could not have the courthouse; he then re-
voked the order (given two weeks previous) on
account of opposition by Protestants, whose
names could be given if necessary. When told
by 30 doing he Proved himself not a man of his
word, be cried ont in loud voice he would
have the offending Individuals gentleman

put in all. The old judge being rather wrathy,
or seemingly so, Rev. Father TIeInan, who
companied the Right Rev. Bishop, walked over
TO where he stood, perhaps to oonciliate-at
least to mend matters. But there was not much
con ncliation The judge Oh jected that Catho olics
would not pray for him; the Rev. Father Aid
this was q mistake, because he would pray for
him, as he had already prayed for every Pro
testant in Lancaster and Northumberland
counties on his previous visit TO the counties.
Perhaps the judge still remained iucredulous
for he again objected that Catholics would not
allow protestant"" Gnibord burial in their
cemetery; this, doubt, brought smile of

AT this point the committee adjourn
ed until this evening at half past seven
O'clock,


This examination, although appear
ing very brief, occupied the entire ses
sion, and the salient points which we
print were elected III the course of
long and tedious cross-examination.


The investigating committee were
all present, with the exception of Mr.. |
Adams, and Messrs. William NJ. Candy,
Hayes and Taylor were present on be. |
half of the water committee.


The Council chamber was very |
warm, and the committees were very |
assduous in their efforts 10 keep cool |
and at the same time thoroughly per-
foim their duties. Mr.. Pickles pushed |
up his sleeves, seized fan, leaned |
back in his chair, occasionally putting |
III objections when he deemed Mr.. |
Canby's questions useless and without |
point. Mr. McMenamin very calmly |
tanned himself, and, at rare intervals,
made pertinent remark or pointed |
question. Mr. Candy cross questioned |
the witness with the pertinacity Of a
Philadelphia lawyer and recorded all |
answers; while Mr.. Underwood, with |
his coat off and the perspiration stand

Mr.. Wesley Hawkins, the father of |

Lynch amused himself by spinning a

interrogating the witness, and Coun.
Gilman Mclntire sat at desk outside
the railing, taking copious notes of the
examination. A number of witnesses
were in the chamber and the whole

4 VERY GOOD LITTLE STORY TOLD BY SENATOR


ALCoRN.

tChlcago Times Washington Letter, 16.h.l",,"tChicago Times Washington Letter, 16.h.l


Senator Alcorn, of Mississippi, who hai
been in the city several days, placing his two
little girls in the convent school, at George
town, relates no end of good stories about
Mississippi plantation life. Mr.. Alcorn lives
upon plantation, where he employs thou.
J sand negroes, and he says that he never had
any trouble with them. In among these
thousand men there are no end of secret So
cieties, and every night there are marchlngs
and counter marchings all over his place.
Still, any of these connections have never
caused him or his family to fear an insurrec-
ton.


Illustrative of how the negroes are. led
about by the nose by unprincipled men, the
| Senator relates an amusing story. During
bis last canvass against Ames for the Cover
norship of the State there was very eager
contest As Alcorn employed upward OF 1000
men on his plantation, it was feared by the
Ames men that taey would all vote for their
employer. Upon the plantation is one old
patriarch by the name of ""Shep,"" who was
the property of Alcorn before the war, and
who had the most of his life seen service on
the Alcorn plantation.


| One day a small-sized, dapper-mannered
carpet-bagger came up to Alcorn's plantation,
and went around secretly electioneering
among the negroes. He discovered that
""Shep"" was leader among them all, and
unless he gained him over it would be useless
to look for votes for Ames on the plantation.
He fell iuto conversation with ""Shep,"" and
gathered from him the scanty details of his
past life. He then went away without saying
a word to ""Shep"" about the election.
Several weeks after that, and short time
before the election, a large letter post-marked
Washington, and resplendent with red seals
and official stamps, came to the Alcorn PLAN
tation, addressed to ""Shep."" It was an
event in the old mans life A meeting of his
favorite secret society was at once called, and
one of the presiding officers, who could read
was detailed to open and read the awe
inspiring document 1t was as follows


EXECUTIVE MANSION. WASHINGTON, d. G, !

Glorious Com.


My Dear hep-Although you are great
distance from me, and although you are only
one of my many colored children, yet know
all about you, and often have my eye upon
you. You were born on a plantation near
Lynchburg, in Virginia. You were owned
there by man by the name of Charles
Somers. Some years before the war you were
sold to Mr. Alcorn, in Mississippi. l know
julius, Robert and James Henry Augustus,
your boys, as we'll as Susan Ann Jane and
Roxana Virginia, your daughters You see,
Shep, that 1 am very great man. I know
all about my children.
have watchfui care over you all, and
have plan to make you all happy. want
you to vots for Gen. Ames for Governor this
fall and, my dear Shep, will give you my
reasons for so wishing. In the first place, |
Gen. Ames is my officer in your State, and |
want you to obey him. Mr.. Alcorn is an old |
stakeholder, you must not vote for him. If
Gen. Ames is elected propose to cut up Mr.. |
Acorn's plantation and give it to the slaves,
who so many years worked for him for moth
ing. will give you, my dear Shep, your
choice out of the lots when the plantation is
cut up. Do not forget to do all you can to get
votes for Ames. Good-by, my dear Shep.


Your friend and benefactor,


q. S. GRANT


""The great General of the army and navy,
and commander of the Commonwealth.


The letter carried ""Snep"" completely by
storm. An angel from heaven could not have
him that the letter was not from
the President. He voted for Ames, and car
ried upwards of 500 votes with him.


The above related incident is only one of
ihe many ways used by unscrupulous politi-
clans to hoodwink the simple-minded and
yulible negro."

TIoNs PRESENTED AND HOW DISPOSED


oF-COL. FEBlGER TALKS OF TRICK


ORDERS DRAWN.


The City Council held an adjourned
meeting last evening, President Lichten-
stein in the chair.


The Committee on Lamps reported in
favor of placing lamps at the following
places at Twelfth and Poplar streets,
Twelfth and Wilson, on French street be-
tween Thirteenth and Fourteenth, on Penn
svlvania avenue, Fifth street between Pine
bard and Poplar, on Fifth street between
Washington and Jefferson. The report of
the Comitttee was adopted.


The committe reported adversely to plac-
ing lamps at Seventh and Broome, Seventh
and Clayton, Seventh and Rodney, and on
Riddles Road. The report adopted.


The Law Committee reported substi-
tute for the ordinance amending the orai-
rance in reference to the Clerks duties.


The Committe on navigation, Mr.. Irelan,
Chairman, reported in favor of dredging
the bed of the Chrstiana at the foot of
French Street. Mr.. Irelan stated that the
committee made the report they did because
in the lease of the wharf no provision had
been made that the lessee should make re-
pairs.


Col. Febiger said that was trick that
had been attempted with every Council for
number of years, and If the city once
commenced it they would have every wharf
front in the city to dredge.


Mr.. Paynter said that If the work was
done it would fill up again in two years and
Mr.. Bush would receive the full benefit of
the work. 1t would be costly precedent
for the city to set, especially when the
wharf properties are leased for such
small sum as $50 per annum.


After long debate the petition of NJ.
Bush was refused.

HrDs's UccEssoR-ADJoURsMENT TO wRDNEs
DAY EVENING.


Tho effort to elect successor to Joseph HYDE
as Chief Engineer of the Water Works was re-
newed, last evening, by fnll Council in the
presence of IN audience which filled Odd Eel
lows Hall. President Lchtenstein called the
body to order at so, and after roll call direc
ted that the balloting be resumed if no other
business WAS presented. The game tellers, (ae.-
sra. johnson and Lynch) continued to act


Five ballots were taken without sny chanpe
from Friday morning last, except that in the
third MIR. farras vote was decreased one by a
ballot cast for 6Ir. Johnson. Major CANDY re-
ceived 10 votes, Daniel Farra votes, aud Potter
U, Furry votes This makes forty-six ballots
in all which have been cast.


At the end OF tho fifth ballot Mr. Ivnch man
aged 10 inject in the business before Council q
petition from Thomle Mauion for the erection
Of frame building on Jackson street near
Chestnut, and then moved an adjournment to
""wednesday evening at 80, which Dir FebGcr
amended by an indefinite adjournment.


Mr. Farrell hero arose and in voice tremu-
ulous with evident emotion expressed the
opinion that the City Solicitor should
be consulted about this matter Of
been advised Of a coalition between the Repub-
licaus and certain Democrats to foist Mr. HYDE
into this position, which he was opposed to.
sWe have risked our lives at the polls"" he said.
'and before my God and my party protest.""


MIR. McMenamin did not know of such an ar
rangement and eaid he was not party to it,


MIR. Farrell moved thst the bailiff call in the
City Solicitor, to vote upon which motion those
for adjour m;nts were withdrawn.


Tho President remarked that Just before he
came into the hall the City Solicitor had in
formed him that he had sent letter to Council
in case in was needed, and Mr.. Lichtenstein
suggested that it be read.


MIR. Taylor said that he had called on the City
Solicitor after the last adjournment in reference
to this matter and had letter from him,


Mr. Farrell was unwilling that the letter
should he read, and earnestly reminded the
President that Council had ordered that the
City Solicitor be sent for, when the bailiff went
out on that duty hesitancy bringing from Mr..
Farrell an order TO "" go aong.""


The motion to read prevailed. The letter sim
ply stated that owing to the late hour when his
opinion was solicited Mr.. Cummins had not had
time to prepare satisfactory one, and he there
fors recommended that an adjournment be made
until ""Wednesday evening at 7 80, when he
wonld be better able to speak advisedly


The adjournment was made."

NoRDHoFF TELLING TIE TRUTH AGAIN.


The Democratic faith in Charles Nord-
hoff may be ftly described as ''the substance
of things hoped for"" and expectations that
In his letters from the South he would give
'fhe evidence of things not seen."" He did
not disappoint them at first, but latterly,
since our repeated exposures Of his attempts
to misrepresent the true condition of affairs.
he has given abundant proof Of the cruel
disregard of human liberty In the: South on
the part Of even the better classes Of the
whites when the rights Of black person
are involved. In this new departure of
his-a departure from falsehood to truth
his Democratic friends and admirers take
no interest whatever. For example, none
Of them have reproduced the following ex.
tract from one Of his Mississippi letters;


nHere is another incident Of Mississippi life.
About four weeks ago q mulAtto girl, aged 10,
who had been living for some time as servant
IN the house Of farmer, two and half miles
from Verona, In Lee county len her service and
went 10 Verona, where she became house ser
want, In order 10 attend an evening school. She
had been st her new place swesk, when one
day the farmer, her employer, accompanied by
his father and neiehbor, oil armed with shot
guns, appeared before the house. Two OF the
men came IN and demanded the girl, saying
she belonged 10 them. shs refused 70 90 with
them and declared that she was free, which
took her by the feet, dragged her thus through
the house, through the yard, into the street,
her clothing torn and defanged IN the struggle,
and screaming for help, ahd-this was In open
daylight, IN the presence OF several men, Do
sides women and ehildfen-set her on horse
and carried her OF, When they got her home
two Of them tied her TO tree and logged her
bare back with green withes until the blood
ran. Then they took her to the house aud
chained her with trace chain aud paddock to
the bed-post, The next day she was turned TO
work and chained up again at night, After
some days she made her escape, and found
refuge with Southern man, the county super
intendent of education, who, after proper
notice, sent her to the United States district
attorney. From the district attorneys lips
/ received the account of this outrage.
Now, cruelty and violence may and do happen
in any State. The part of the story which
seems most horrible to me Is this Ii is In evi-
dence before the district attorney that the
mayor of Verona, who is its Justice of the
peace, heard the girls cries and saw the strug-
gle, and, when asked why he did not interfere
himself, testified that he thought 1t was none
of his business, as he knew 1t was only negro
girl Several other men testified that they
stood In their doors and saw the girl dragged
by her feet out into the road. 1t was none of
their business either. Finally related this
tale to Democratic judge of the Supreme
Court of the State. He replied that brutality
was found everywhere, North as well as
South; and could not, with all my efforts,
apparently make him understand that what
filled me with indignation and hopeless
disgust was not so much the act itself, but
the fact that an officer of the law and several
citizens could witness it unmoved, because It
was only a negro girl. If 1t had been
white girl, no doubt the mayor would have
interfered, and the Judge would have been in
dignant. If the brutes who should maltreat
white girl so bad had been negroes, the coun-
try would have risen to lynch them, and the
papers all over Mississippi would have yelled
with fury""


1t is to be hoped that some of the Demo-
cratic Gushers who assume to believe that
the Southern whites have all accepted the
results of the war in good faith will explain
the indifference manifested by the Missis-
sippi authorities regarding this infamous
outrage, If is not an attempt to restore
practical slavery, perhaps they will tell US
what it is. They cannot dispute Nord-
hof's testimony with consistency, for he
has been very generally indorsed by them
as o truthful man. Certainly they will not
charge that he is Southern outrage
grinder"" and they must remember that
such evidence, coming from one of their
own witnesses, will be exceedingly dam.
aging to them If it is not explained or con.
troverted.

OLD, eroRY.


In 1S65-teu years ago-the Inhabitants OF Kings
bridge, Carmansville, Fort Washington, Inwood and
the ncghboring villages made up their minds that
they ought to have public road and they discussed
and canvassed the subject quito freely The locality of
the Kngsbrdge road Is celebrated for It's romantic and
sylvan solitude and beauty and the citizens Of this
treat, many OF whom lived in houses built by their
grandfathcrs, thought 1t only fair that
this section of the city should reap the benefits
OF any improvements that might he made These were
the early prosperous days Of tho ring rule in this city
and the opening OF road was looked upon as Col
conda of punder for all the harpcs who fed upon public
improvements The first Commissioners OF Assessment
and Award appointed Henry Parsons, William
Parsons and John T. MCGOWAN, the latter being
a young lawyer To these gentlemen succeeded

holders, and the matter taken before Justice
Donohue when the Commissioners made their
report and in the case of James Lynch,
notably wealthy property holder, who appealed
from the report OF the Commissioners believing it to
be unfair Chief Justice Davis and Judge Law
renee however, denied tho motion, and the crowds OF
property holders who attended court with almost
brilliant array OF private counsel, received no
satisfaction surveyor named Edward Boyle
was appointed to take charge OF the proposed
ncw road. and money plenty in those days, how
gotten wonders expected; and yet ten long
years have elapsed since then. generation has
grown up old has passed 70 its fathers and not
a cobbc stone has boen turned in tho
bed OF the Kingsbridge road, and, possibly
that Aldermen Reilly, Mccarthy and Dcanc
have taken hold of it, may be that ten other years will
clapse before the sound OF the public pick shovel is
heard in the shadow Of the OF the old revolution
airy Kingsbrdge road Yet h is duty that these
officials to the public to report to the Board the
ordinance offered by one Of the Aldermen what
they propose TO do, and they should do il
at once AZ the inhabitants Of the district
arc waiting for them and have heard even nm echo
in eight months Surely II need not take eight months
to consider IT, such simple and easily wordcd resou-
ton as the which is printed at the head OF this
article.


GENERAL


General Ftz John Porter has repeatedly stated 10
property holders that he ready TO 60 with the
work. and begin operations soon the ordinance
passed by the Board Of Aldermen But until they have
made up their wcighy minds, It will be impossible for
the Commissioner OF Public Works to stir In the matter
There about Ave miles OF road to be cxcavated laid
out graded and sidewalks to be built and it is a big
job OF road work, and will take somo timc, even II
properly performed and economically accounted for to
tho people who are to be assessed.


IS THERE IT!


And now comes a very grave question for tho
property holders OF this section. Tho net
now before tho Board OF Aldcrmen-if II
Is ever passed-reads that the job Of
improving and laying out the road shall be done in
""days' work."" It is called by tho Commissioner Of
Public Works instead OF being done in tho honest way

who arc most interested in the matter, have informed

Il the opinion of nearly every taxpayng citizen Of

abled protect their interests An example may

tccted at oncc;--

II Is estimated by practical engineers that In assess

POSITION TO FURTHER SECTIONAL LEaIsLA-


TON


A joint caucus OF republican Senators and Re-
presentatves was held at the Capitol tonight but
owing to a misunderstanding the attendance was
not large. The joint committees OF the caucus Of
both houses made report, represent
ing bill. authorizing the President to
suspend the writ Of habeas corpus In
certain cases, and in accordance with previous
acts giving him power to use the army and navy
| to maintain peace anu suppress disorder, to ap-
| point deputy marsnas and supervisors OF elec-
tions In Congressional districts, who, IN addition
to their other powers, can arrest persons who
may attempt to intimldate voters or otherwise
unlawlully interfere with the conduct OF
| the election. Provision Is made for a
! fair and full registration OF legal voters
under prescribed regulations, and 1t is
made unlawful for any OF the reconstructed States

prepayment thereof as qualification for voters

election 'or the purpose OF intimidation or vt0-
lence q criminal offence punishable by nne and
Imprisonment at tho discretion OF the Court and
so Of violations OF other parts of the bill.
Representative J. Amber Smith. OF Virginia,
moved to strike out the words RECONSTRUCTED
States, his object being to destroy the sectional
reference, that II the bill was to be passed, 1t
should be applicable to all the states. He pro-
tested against further federal interference in the
AFFAIRS OF the South.


Representatives, Dawes, Of Massachusetts; Cobb,
OF Kansas, and Williams, Of Michigan, agreed in
the main with the gentleman from Virginia, but
Messrs. Lawrence, or Ohio; Albright, OF Pennsyl-
vauia and Lynch, OF Mississippi, took the Oppo.
site ground, insisting that there was the great
est need for federal interference to protect
cOored men in the exercise of their rights.
The caucus was not altogether harmonious, and,
without action, an adjournment until tomorrow
night took place. Several OF the members stated
that they would not attend, as they Thought their
time would be more probably employed.


THE PACIFIC MAIL SCANDAL-FURTHER ExAMI-
r ~ NATION OF IRWIN


The Investigation or the Pacific Mail subsidy
scandal was resumed to-day. Mr.. Irwin was cross.
examined by Mr.. Clark Bell, with view to show.
ing that the contract Tor TWINS services was
made by SJocxwell Individually, and that not only
the first $25OO00, but all the other checks fur.
nished to him were Stockwell's individual checks.
Witness swore ne could not ind the copies OF his
letters to StocEwell nor the two letters that may
have been written to him by Stockweil in answer
to his OF February Is and May 4, 1872. He was not
positive whether he destroyed his checks on the
Exchange Bank, or the stubs OF his checks on
other banks; he thought they were in
existence, but could not find them; he
was not interested In any stock specula-
tions during the pendency OF the subsidy
bill. Mr.. Bell read to Mr.. IRWIN an extract from a
letter addressed to the managing director OF the
Pacific Mail Steamship Company by the China
TransPaciHc Steamship Company, January 10, in
which they state that Mr.. Irwin was before their
Board about three weeks prior to the telegraphic
confirmation OF their charter, and proposed that
II the company was uncommtted 10 the Pacific
Mail Steamship Company ne was prepared to SUD-
NIT eligible Offers for the employment OF two OF
their vessels. namely, the Vasco de Cana and the
Vancouver. Mr.. Irwin denied having made this
oner but admitted he had made suggestion to
the China Trans-Pacinc steamship Company, OF
London, that the latter should delay action
In their negotiations with the Pacific Mail
Company IN order 10 receive q proposition
from the overland railroad companies. and
that ne nau written authority from the rallTOauS
to make this suggestion. He was present when
Charles Albert drew the money on his check for
SI25. 600 and thinks he was present when Whiting
drew the cneck for 500 900; the money was drawn
in New York. May q. 1872 He went on TO Philadel-
pna tnat evening and proceeded to California the
next day. Though witness could not find the
copies OF his letters TO Stockwei ne was certain
he had correctly stated their contents. lie could
not recoLect positively whether or not he received
replies to the letters OF February Is and May
which he wrote to Stockwel. Mr.. Bell then asked
Mr.. Irwin whether he furnished the letter to the

some improper connection with the subsidy move
menL he declined to answer unless
the committee decided that this was
proper question. Being informed that he
should answer, he replied. ""I have not made any
such insinuations."" He was then asked, ""Did
you not write the letter signed Vacuum GaugeS' ""
lie declined to answer unless the letter were to
be placed IN evidence. Some discussion arose In
tie committee, which was ended by Mr.. Bells
stating that he intended put the letter In evi.
dence II the witness answers should warrant It.
Mr.. Irwin thereupon replied that he did not write
the letter. The next question was :""Did you
inspire or direct tue writing OF this letters"" Mr..
Irwin responded that he must object TO the ques-
ton on the ground that 1t did not relate to the
subject OF the inquiry. After some discussion the
committee sustained the objection. aud the time
allotted TO Mr.. Bell having expired the session
was closed and the committee adjourned TIL to-
morrow 1t was understood, however. tnat this

Eceie~iasticai Review for the Year
All Religious Seeis Prosperous in
Los Angeles.",,"Los Angeles can with pride call at
tention to the number of its religious
organizations and their general pros
perity. Ten denominations are repre-
sented in this city; each one has a
large congregation and makes favora-
BILE report for the year. In this relig-
ious review the HERALD gives prefer
ence to the Catholic Church, by right
of priority.


THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.


The Catholics came to Southern
California in 1869, and established q
mission at San Gabriel, the first in this
county, in September III. In 1776
they made another Mission at San
Juan Capistrano, and still another at
San Fernando in 1897. The Mission
Church in Los Angeles was establish
ed several years later, as an especial
cathedral for the soldiers from Spain
who desired to worship apart from the
natives. Daily services are still held in
the San Gabriel church, erected over a
century ago, and also in the San Juan
and Los Angeles Mission churches.
In 1872 the Mission church at San
Juan Capistrano was thrown down by
an earthquake-the only one in South
ern California ever attended with loss
of lives-and some thirty worshippers
were crushed to death. Although by
Spanish decree the Catholic orders
were divested of their missions here,
and the untutored native left to seek
out his own civilization and his own
salvation, the seed sown by those early
fathers has brought forth good fruit,
even unto the present day.


In Los Angeles county there are six
Catholic churches--at Los Angeles,
San Fernando, San Jose, Wilmington,
Anaheim and San Gabriel. During
the past year there has been a consid-
cradle increase in the number of its
members, on account Of immigration
and conversion. The Parish of our
Lady of Angels, comprising Los An
geles city and the large district from
the San Fernando mountains to Will
mington, contains population of
5000 Catholics. The Mission church
of San Fernando is visited OCCASION
ally by priest from Los Angeles city
and Wilmington is also attended from
here twice month. Number of bap-
tisms in Los Angeles city during the
past year, 367; deaths, 263; mar
riages over 60. Here at the church of
Our Lady of Angels resides Rt. Rev.
Thaddeus Amat, G. NJ, ID. D., Rt. Rev,
Francis Mora, Coadjutor Bishop; Rev.
Peter Verdaguer, Rector; Rev. Michael
Divan, Rev. Charles Flanagan, Rev.
Michael Lynch and Rev. Gelss. The
pastor of San Gabriel Mission is Rev.
Joaquin Bot, assisted by Rev. Philip
Farrelley, who attends Santa Ana
uuu Anaioi.. tuivo nIuutn anu
upper and lower San Jose, Los Nietos
and Azusa, about once month. We
are not in position to state more about
the Mission at San Juan Capistrano
than that it is one of the oldest in the
State and at present in charge of Rev.
Joseph Meet as pastor.


THE HEBREW SYNAGOGUE.


The Hebrews established Congre-
CATION in this city in July, 1862. Rev.,
A. III. Edelman, a most worthy gen.
tleman, is at the head of the congre-
CATION. At present it numbers over
so members, AMI its prosperity during
the year has been most satisfactory.
The synagogue is on Fort street, be-
tween Second and Third streets.


ST. ATHANASIUS' EPISCOPAL CHURCH.


Episcopal services were first held in
Los Angeles by Bishop Kip, in 1854,
in the then public hall On Main street,
near the present site of the Pico
House. After an interval of nearly
ten years, the Rev. Chas. Birdsall,
now of San Francisco, commenced
services in 1861 and established the
parish of st. Athanasius' Church.
During his stay the brick edifice, still
in use, was obtained from the Presby-
terians, whose first organization in
the city had become extinct. In 1866
Rev. Mr.. Birdsall removed TO Stock
ton. He was succeeded by Revs. H.
III. Messenger and ]. II. Talbot for
about one year each, when, after a
temporary supply for few months by
the Rev. c. Q. Loop, now of San Cab
riel, who had come to Southern Cali
fornia for his health, the Rev. George
Burton was called to the Rectorship, in
1869. Mr.. B commenced aboys' and also
a girls school, which met with partial
success; but he resigned and left for
the North in August, 1870. The vestry
then called the Rev. J. B. Gray, who
entered upon his duties, November 20,
1870, and continued his services as
Rector until Feb. 23, 1874, when he re-
signed the Parish. Services were
again held for a few weeks by the Rev.
c. Il. Loop, when, at Easter of the
present year, the Rev. VIM. H. Hill
accepted call and entered upon the
Rectorship. In May of the same year
extensive repairs amounting to about
81, 200, were made to the church build"

lowest level of the wady. Some of these
waters are 1909 Fair. AS to their number,
instead of saying there are six or eight, it
is nearer the fact to regard the whole bed
of the valley on the north for about mile
a continuous hot sulphur spring. In addi-
tion to the medicinal quality of the waters,
the temperature of the valley in Autumn,
Winter, and Spring is delightful; while for
scenery, in the fantastic blendings of basalt,
limestone, and sandstone, in the fragrance
and colorings of oleanders, jumpers, and
the various Towering shrubs, there is
was most delicious. In the main stream
we lay rolling like pigs from the cold water
to the hot water, and from hot to cold, and
wallowed where the hot and cold mixed at
the most agreeable point. Indeed so exactly
does the cold and hot water divide in the
stream that the body can lie partly in the
one and partly in the other at the same
moment. Mention is made of these springs
by Josephus, Pliny, and others. They have
been visited of late years by few Euro
peans, but our party we're the first Ameri-
cans of which we have any account to see
and enjoy them. Even Lynch did not
penetrate so far-a fact quite unaccount-
able."

The Legislature.


SACRAMENTO, Dec. 3d.-Several
members of the incoming Legislature
are in town and all is hustle and activ-

is busy in connection with the retir-

ments for the comfort and conven-

Chavez Gang.


SAN DIEGO, Dec. 3.-The force
which made a recent attack on Aqua
Caliente Ranch, consisted of six Mex
leans who are from below. After the
attack they scattered, crossing the
river at Burke's and taking the trail
for Colorado. These are undoubtedly
the friends of Chavez hunting for Ca
loig, whe returned to Caliente. After
killing him had they wanted stock
they might have taken several mules
running at large on the Ranch, which
were not disturbed. There were only
three men OH the Ranch as asss-
tants, and they could have had every
thing their own way outside of the
house."

WHAT THE MAYOR SAYS


Masor Wicknam had long interview with

Buildings, when tie latter called upon q m yester
day to hand IN his official report as to the action
he (Mr. Adams) had taken to prevent the falling
spectors had reported 1t IN dangerous condition.
The interview was entirely private; but 1t Is un-
very closely as to that part VI his report In winch
he states that on the very day OF the accident the
district inspector found It thoroughly Draced on
Inspectors statement was correct any part OF the
wall could have topped over as It aid. MIR. Wick
ham, IN conversation ABOUT what action II any, ne
would take 10 ascertain who was to blame for the
accident, was very retcent, but he remarked tnat
so lar as he mad any power TO act. there wou!d be
a thorough investigation. and he by no means so
lar as superintendent Adams report was con-
cerneu, considered 1t nal that, in TACT, alter Mr.
Adams should institute an otiicial inquiry 10 learn
II any one In his department mad been Ia the
slightest degree TO blame he would expect another
report he preferred not 10 talk about what
course he himself would pursue In order 10 see 10
It tnat the parties real; & a. anlt @ Should @ be se e.
lie, the Coroner would, OF course, have charge or
the investigation, ana tue mayor did not therefore
think 1t becoming Tor him to express himself Uii
cIaly as to whom he thought was 10 blame for the
disaster. He ADDED, however, tnat II the verdict
OF the jury inculpated any official over whom
ne had control MS (the Mayor's) action would be
prompt.


Father Mooney, OF St. Bridget's, and Commls-
soner Lynch called upon the Mayor during the
day, II Is sad TO urge MN 10 order an lnvestlga-
tion into the alleged neglect or the Department OF

port 10 the Mayor, mad stated tnat tue wall was
pronounced all right 10y an Inspector IN MS depart
ment the very day the accldent occurred, re-
marked ION, yes, that's the old story. Every
body who ought to nave done something officially
TO prevent accidents OF this Kind always nave a
good excuse Tor themselves. TO JudGe rom the
reports as to falling buildings during the past lew
years one woull think tnat 1t was only the real
solid walls that ever tell over""

A most remarkable physical fact
was developed at the Masonic banquet
on Thursday night. Most of the par
ticipants were very hungry when they
sat down, and each of course seized the
French bill of fare. After perusing it
q few moments each guest leaned back
with self-satisfied countenance. That
| bill of fare satisfied their hunger in the
same way that view of dentists
instruments cures toOth-ace. A bill of
fare of fancy dishes, printed in difficult
French, is the most economical dodge
out, and we recommend all hotels to
try it. With a French bill of fare,
healthy-looking victuals may be left
scattered around with perfect reck-
lessness. An attempted persusal of a
French bill of fare knocks spots out of
an American appetite."

to him, and at 10 O'Clock this morning
he went to the Office of CarIuth, and
after angry words u shot was heard.
Investigation disclosed the fact that
Carruth was nortally wounded.
Landis was Immediately arrested. The
feeling against Lands is very great.
Thrests of lynching have been made,
To avoid trouble the authorities have
removed Landis to the Jail at Bridge
ton. The doctors have given up all
hope of Carruih's recovery and cannot
last over night.
Lands, after reading the article in
this weeks Independent, visited Mr..
Carruth's office; the latter being absent
was sent for AS he came in the door
| Lupdis pICscutcu pi5tOis iOliiutii
ran from the office into the workshop,
and Landis after him, and shot him as
he was trying to. get. out of the door
leading down stairs. Theball entered

brain.


PLEA OF THE MURDBRER's FRIENDS.


The friends Of Mr. lands here assert
trat there was no attempt or disposi
ton to lynch him, as was stated IL
some of the papers, and it is claimed
that there has been decided reaction
in public sentiment relative to the dis
trcssiug occurrence of this morning
it being generally acknowledged tina
the incessant and bitter attacks by Mr.
Carruth, through the columns of hi
paper, the Independent, upon Mr.. Ian
dis and his family during the past thre,
years being great provocation. A
Iatcst accounts Mr.. Carruth was still
alive.


| Y. T. Cortes, deputy sheriff, says:


The reported threats of lynchin,


Mr.. Landis by the populace here ar,
unfounded. He surrendered himscl
to me, waived hearing, and stepped

 his Singular Career. ..s.

 A San Francisco correspondent tells

 of a strange career of crime in that land

 so full of vicissitudes. The story is of

 John Miller, secretary of the Contract and

 Finance company. He had lived in San

 Francisco from eight to ten years, high

 ly respected and courted by the best so- ciety. He was gentlemanly y in his man.

 l1ers and in business perfect giant. He

 had worked his way from clerk to the

 office of secretary, at a salary of BIO, ,000 year, gold, and was highly regarded in business point of view.

 Miller had married wealthy lady,

 and his luxurious manner of living ex-

 cited no suspicion. The correspondent goes on to say: One day there came little voice into Leland Stanford's private

 office which spake word or two into

 his ear. Before the evening of the next

 day MT. Stanford knew that John Mil ler's name was not John Miller but A.

 R. Woodruff, that he had wife living in Lynchburg, Va., and that his wealth had, every dollar of it, been stolen from the Contract and Finance company.

 Such 8 revelation created futter in the Central Pacific office, but the secret was we'll guarded. Stanford and Crock CT at once went to work to investigate the actual extent of the defalcation. They hoped to do this without exciting Miller's suspicion, but failed. One day he came to MT. Sandford and said very quietly that he was not feeling we'll and believed he'd run up to the McCloud river and catch some trout. ,... I

 Repairing to his mansion he packed @ small valise and asked his wife to make ready to accompany him as far as Sacra- mento. The next morning both went to Sacramento. ,.r-. .~ .-. ..saar

 Meanwhile an examination of Miller's accounts was begun, and the first thing the expert struck was false entry of $1O,OOO. Then Stanford knew that the fishing trip was blind. The telegraph was set to work to capture the fugitive. Every train on every road under Central Pacific control was boarded, but for long time Miller, could not be found. Accident, however, brought him in con tact with baggage master at Marys- vile who knew him and pointed him out to the conductor. His arrest quickly followed. He took matters very coolly, saying he guessed there must be some mistake. He was taken to San Francisco and confronted with Stanford and Crocker. After 8 brief interview, he asked to see his wife, An officer was detailed to escort him to his house. Ar irving there, Miller asked permission to retire for moment. When he returned he whispered word to his heartbroken wife, and she quietly went out of the room. In moment she returned, and to Miller's great dismay exhibited and gave to the officer package containing $13, 1000 in greenbacks, over $75, 900 in United States bonds, and lot of valu- able papers belonging to the company, which he had taken from his person and told his wife to secure. After this evi- dence that Mrs. Miller refused to be party to his crime, Miller sunk in his chair and meekly asked to be taken back to the railroad office. '1 -.. .t a

 The clew once struck the expert at work on Miller's books rapidly unearth: ed deep mine of rascality. The origi- nal Ss10, 900 dedication grew in an hour to $1OO,OOO. The next day it swelled to $25O, 900, and the affair became the sen- sation of the hour. Finally, Miller con- fessed all, and set about making restitu- o1OA. Il0 GuEuSO ONoI uuuuIcuS O4 thousands of dollars, but still the daily reports of the expert called for more. Finally the new house went, and block | after block of city real estate, improved | and unimproved, was made over to the railway company. When the expert had finally finished his work it was found that the extent of Miller's pecu- lations exceeded $1 900, ,0O0 in the space of five years. The amount of property | offered in restitution exceeded one mil lion and 8 half, but as most of it was rf al estate in rapidly improving locali- ties the company accepted it in full re- of their loss They also, so far as was in their power, granted i'm munity to the defaulter, this being done to prevent the possibility of exposing the affairs of the Contract and Finance company in court. -.=-. ,..

 Thus far the history of this defaulter differs but little from that of other gentry of the same ilk. But in other crimes-bigamy and that of living for years under @ bogus identity-Miller's case surpasses that of any other in cool audacity and boldness of design.

 Simultaneously with the discovery of his peculations came that of the fact that bis name was not John Miller but A. R. and that he formerly lived in Lynchburg, Va, where he had wife and one or two children. His family were in ignorance that he was living in San Francisco as John Miller, but be- ieved that as A. R.

AUGUSTA, Ga. Aug 19.-More than hundred ar
rests have been made in the counties OF Jefferson
johnson, Washington, and Burke on account OF the
alleged negro insurrectip, and many more VIII
probably take place. Three of the ringeades were
captured this morning in Jefferson and put IN Jail
In Johnson County the existence OF an armed ana
uniformed negro company was discovered to-day,
and a number of its members surrendered them
selves and their arms. A United States Marhsal is
in SandersvilIe The leading citizens of Washing
ton have issued an address counseng calnneSs aud
moderation. Serious apprehensi0ns are entertained
of race conflict in Burke County. Both negroes
and whites are armed


A scouting party of whites were ambuscaded and
fred upon this morning. Another scouting party
captured large number of armed negroes. Guns
and ammunition were sent to Burke County from
this city to-day, and an appeal was made for troops
The volunteer companies were ready to respond, but
Gov. Smith sent a telegram, ordering them to stay
in Augusta. Unable to go in companies, quite
number left tonight as volunteers The companies
in Burke County are also under arms The negroes,
under the lead of a man named Morris, colorcd are
reported eight or ten miles from Waynesboro, and
it Is thought that the whites will move on them TO-
night.


No lynchings have taken place, and the people
seem determined to await the operation of the law.
Some of the captured negroes in Burke County de-
clare that they have been acting under the orders of
Rivers negro general in the South Carolina militia


SPECIAL SESSION OF COURT ORDERED.

yesterday About fifty arrests have been made. Con-
duplicating those arrested have been made Tx
Gov IIerscholv "" johnson, who is Judge OF the Middle
Circuit Court has ordered Special Term Of the Superior
Court to convene to try the Offenders


The excitement is subsiding. The negroes have no
cause for the contemplated rising. All the trouble is
caused by few worthless, turbulent, and designing
negroes who live upon the crcdulty Of the colored
people. The whites will upon the defensive and en-
dcavor 10 arrest the ringeaders the conspiracy."

the HERALD, published in the Express
last evening, takes issue with us, in
our biographical sketch of Moody, the
self-appointed evangelist. Any can
did reader who examines the editorial
in question, will see that the Rev. Mr..
Alls objectio rs are strained and far
fetched. We cast no slurs on religion,
threw no reproaches on sincere follow
ers of Christ, and would not allude to
the ""open letter"" were it not to cor
rect the Reverend Gentleman's quota
ton from scripture. Our early theo.
logical education was not neglected
in fact we were born with the Lords
Prayer in our mouth, were fed on
""The Lord is my Shepherd"" and put
to sleep with the Westminster Shorter
Catechism. AS we matured, we read
such thrilling literature as Scots
Worthless, Annals of the Prosecuted,
and Fox's Book of Martyrs; and our
picture gallery, was ornamented
with touching pictures of John
Rogers at the Stake, Execu-
tion of George Wishart, hanging of
Andrew Melville, John Knox preach
ing before Mary, etc. Thus when
Presbyterian preacher comes at us
with a quotation from the Bible, we
just draw on our Covenanter educa-
tion and compare notes. So when the
Rev. Mr.. Allis gives us the following
blow, we must answer:


/ fear, Mr.. Editor, you are not in
sympathy With the religion of Christ,
and that your attempts to beittle
Moody and Sankey in their wonderful
work is like the experience of Paul as
he went to Damascus, where one met
him and said, at is hard for thee to
kick against the goods""


The quotation meant to be made in
concluding the sentence is contained
in the last clause of the 5th verse of
the 9th chapter of Acts, and should
read, I"" 1t is hard for thee to kick
against the pricks."" We know Moody
better than the Reverend gentleman
knows his Testament, but We can see
no reason for mangling the quotation
as is done in the ""open letter."" We did
not class brother Moody with Beecher
or any of those bad fellows, hence the
quotation was in-apropos. We sug-
gest in conclusion that the Rev. Mr..
Allis should study the history of Paul
little more closely before he rushes
into the theological field with us, for
that is our best hold. We hope the
writer of the ""open letter. will not
charge the poor printers with the mis-
take, for Ayers OF the Express isa very
pious man. the foreman and printers
are biblical students of distinction, and
the only wicked man of the concern
Lynch-has gone to attend the Demo-
cratic State Convention."

The Noble Band OF Third Termers.


In the multitude of Congressman there
were eighteen who stood firm in the day Of
peril. They faced not only the onset and
furious affront Of the enemy, but the certain
knowledge that they would be seen by the
country to have sold themselves respectively
for messes of pottage. To danger and shame
alike indifferent they stood nobly by the great
source of Executive patronage. An examina-
ton of the composition of this forlorn hope of
the third term may have some interest. 1t is
made up of four classes of persons. There
are Northern men, resolute for spoil there
are Southern men who believe that the offices
they may secure will be of tangible value,
but who doubt if this can be said Of the ma
tional freedom and constitutional precedents;
there are carpet baggers there are ''cullud
pussons,"" who were slaves before the war.
The negroes are Charles L. Nash, Louisiana;
Josiah L. Walls, Florida Jeremiah Haralson,
Alabama John r. Lynch Mississippi; John
Adams Hyman, North Carolina, and Robert
Small, South Carolina. People who were
born in slavery and received political rights
but yesterday, as it were, can scarcely
be expected to comprehend those prob
lens of national politics on which
this topic turns while, in common
with their race, they tend to carry hero wor-
ship to deifcation. Their vote, therefore, is
natural and they with unconscious instinct
favor a form of government that would cer-
tainly be better for them than any other
form, because it would put them in a
political tutelage not greatly dissimilar from
slavery. G. Wiley Wells, of Mississippi, and
Solomon Hoge, of South Carolina, are carpet
baggers, while John ID. White, of Kentucky,
and Alexander S. Wallace, of South Carolina,
are Southerners to the manor born so far as
known. Both the latter have probably
lively sense of official favors to come Nat
urally the carpet-b baggers have, like the
cheap shops, 'only one price, which is-all
they can get. Wells, of Mississippi, has
had his pay in advance, for all the fed
eral patronage of Mississippi was recently
transferred to him from Governor Ames.
OF the eight others, California, New York,
Iowa, Illinois, Maine and Vermont have each
one to be ashamed of, and Michigan has two.
""Mail contracts"" accounts for one, and the
Internal Revenue Department knows most
of the others. Five of these men are natives
of New England States, and the New York
member is a Scotchman. OF this eight there
are three who 'didnt mean to do it ! that
is to say, who voted for the third term 70,
some other reason than because they are in
favor of it. 1t is to be hoped the reasona
were satisfactory substantial."

Deadlock In Council.",,"| THE bEss1ON.


| The subject OF tho election of II Chief Engi-


neer of the Water Department and Water
| Registrar engaged the attention OF Council last


night, and until g. 80 this morning. Much inter-


est was felt in the choice for the first position,


and Odd Fellows' Hall was densely packed out


side the railing with anxious watchers of the
| proceedings. All the members OF Council were


in their seats, including Mr.. Ford, who had
child dead at home.


| In the midst of the regular business, Mr.
Lynch moved that Council proceed to the cleo
| ton Of Chief Engineer of the Water Works
| and Registrar which was adopted, when Mr.
Mclntire arose and spoke substantially rs fol-
| lows


| Mr.. President As all are aware through the
newspapers, l received the nomination OF the
| Democratic caucus for the Chief Englneership
Whatever claims l may have to tho place
| deem 1t my duty to sacrifice them to the in-
| terests of the CITY and am willing to sacrihce
my interests for the good of the Democratic
party, of which am member. My nomiua-
ton did not suit the wishes OF some gentlemen,
| and | now waive all claim to it, and nominate
| a Democrat OF the first water for it-Peter U.
Fury.


Dr. Bailey nominated Major Samuel Candy,
| and Mr.. McMenalnin named Daniel Farra.
Aiessrs. Johnson and Lynch were appointed toll
ers and the balleting WAS begun.
In the meanwhile Mr.. Farrell'a Voca broke
over the scene, which until this time had been
ono OF quiet and decoTum, exclaiming. ' Mr.


Reporter, MIR. Reporter, please note particularly
the man who nominated MIR. Farra."" Then in
more subdned voice he heaped curses long and
deep upon some one who it afterwards appear
ed WAS MIR. Paynter, ono of his audible mutter-
ings being. "" Treason, by Cd""
Tho result OF the ballot was teu votes FOR Ma
jor Candy, nine for Mr.. Farra and two for MIR.
Furry. The solid vote OF the Republican men,
ka.a.. t,.al sNa,,l
Candy Mr.. Farra received tho votes Of Messrs.
Hayes, Bickta, Paynter Ford, McMenamm, Tay-
lor, McGlinchey, LYNCH and Irelan and Furry
those OF hlessrs. Mclntire and Farrell.


Mr. Mclntire then moved that the subject be
laid over until to morrow evening aud that the
Council adjourn until that time.


Mr. Farrels voice was again heard "" Harry,
Harry, now's your time for fight""


A second ballot WAS then taken with the same
result, and Mr. Lynch moved postponenent
until Monday night. This raised tue point of tile
right OF Council to defer the matter to All ad
journed meeting, which was decided IN the af-
trmative. Before this decision stated, how
ever Mr.. Farrell expressed his doubt Of The le.
gality of such action. coupled with the increased
pay which such adjourned meeting would re-
qulro.


N1r, Mclntire only partly agreed with Mr. Far
rell, but thought tho matter had better
be postponed as il balloting was kept up all
night it would not cause any Democrat to vote
fer a Republican and he supposed no Republican
would vote for u Democrat


This moved Mr.. Febger to the relation Of an
anecdote about the monkey and the parrot, to
which Mr.. McIntre replied with intended sar-
casm &"" This fight is our fight and tho gentle
man has nothing to do with it. We will fight it
through, ourselves""


Two other ballots were taken without chai &C.,


Mr. Paynter then renewed the motion for u
postponement until Monday night.


MIR. Johnson thonght that as So the gentle
men wanted to fight thoy should have that privi-
lege to night, especially since an adjourned
meeting would cost the city twenty-one dollars""


MIR. McIntire l am ready to elect now. |
am sure. however, that the city will save more
than $2l by the election of Democrat.


division was called Oh the motion to adjourn
and it was lost


Mr.. Farrell said he had had no supper, but
was ready TO stay all night, in which refrain
Messrs. Paynter, Hayes and some others joined,
creating some warmth of feeling, in which MIR.
Farrell aud Mr.. Paynter had u little tilt, when
tho former claimed somewhat defiantly that he
controlled the situation. Mr.. Hayes interrupted
with ''we'll, show you,"" Mr.. Farrell retortlug,
""and Ill como slippery Jim on you.' Mr.. Far
rell then accused blr. Paynter of deliberate ly-
ing, and some conversation passed between
them about testing manhood, which was heard
by some of the spectators who rose to their feet
on the chairs, in the hope that something practi-
cal would come of it.


Two other ballots were taken without result,
when Mr.. Lynch moved to proceed to tho cleo
LlOu Oh IeplbtrhT, WHICH Deiiib CdfIou
mated Edward McIniire, and Mr. Jones named
Charles Burton, Jr. Mr.. McIntire was elected
on the first ballot by vote of Ii to TO-


Here the regular business was resumed, but
in about 10 minutes Council returned to tue
Water Engipeership question, when five more
Intellectual ballots were cast, no one changing
his vote. Seeing no choice possible, recess
was taken at o. AS until l.i5 efforts to reduce it
to three-quarsors of an hour and an hour hay
ing failed. ~
During the recess several of the Democratic
members went into caucus at the Washington
House, but Messrs Farrell, Hayes, and Payuter
refused to have anything to do with it.
Upon e-enteriug tho hall, the l35h ballot was
taken with the same result as previous ones.
when Mr. johnson moved for II three-quarter
hour recess. Upon this MIR. Febiger raised the
point that that length of time would carry the
session into another day, it being then three
minutes of II O'Clock, which Council had no
right to do, and the point was decided well
taken.


Some little feeling was then manifested on tie
part OF the Democrats, Mr.. Mclntire insisting
that this little trouble is our corpse, and we in
tend to bury it and with it the Republican par
Mr.. Farrell approved the design to biiy the
Republican party but thought 1--WE ought not
to bury ourselves in doing so, as an adjourn-
ment would do by the retention of MIR. Hyde.
From this time, 1910, to $40, when another


recess for hall M hour was taken, the time was
consumed in dilatory motions OF adjournment
to stated times, eNcuslnB members, dtteiuptb W
| inject other business into the proceedings, but
not even an adjournment to future day could
| be made although Mr.. McIntire had boasted
| that the Democrats had the full power and


'' would do as they pleased"" Thirty four bal
lots had been taken in all at the recess, the only
change beng the casting of his vote by a Farra
| man for MIR. Furry on the 21st ballot The mon
otony was only broken by little tilt between
| Mersrs Hayes and Farrell in which each declar-
| ed his intention to remain steadfast in the pos.-
| tion which he had assumed. After this drowsi-
| ness crept over almost all in the hall. Some of
| the members nodded in their chairs, others nap
ped with their heads upon their desks, while the
| spectators, who still renamed in considerable
| numbers slept as they sat or with heads bowed


upon the railing. Doctor Bailey, the white
| haired member from the Fifth, showed but little


sign of fatigue, his eyes were not perceptibly


heavy, but he watched the proceedings with con-
| tnued interest.


immediately upon the re-assembling. after the
recess, the 35th ballot was taken without an
| election Messrs Taylor and Downing, and Ford


and Underwood paired off, taking advantage of
the sympathy for Mr.. Ford on account OF the


death of his child, to be excused This took two
each from the votes of Messrs. Candy and Farra
| as Chief Engineer, and the six other ballots
which were taken showed no other change than
this reduction. These ballots were interspersed
with numerous motions for recess and adjourn
ment until 30, this morning, when Council

rascality if an account of all the frauds
which have been perpetrated 10 the trans
actions connected with the sale of public
lands appropriated to the different States
for the endowment of agricultural colleges,
and the disposition of the receipts there
from, should be brought together in con


nected narrative. We have, at various
times, published some interesting particu-
lars of the way in which the proceeds of
agricultural college lands have been diver
ted into the pockets of ardent supporters
of Grant's Administration and in the
New Orleans Bulletin we find some infor-
nation regarding the disposition which
has been made OF Louisiana's share in the
general grab of public lands under the
pretence of aiding the agricultural inter-
ests of the country. Louisiana received
2O9, ,920 acres of land, the scrip for which
in 1871 or 1879 fell into the hands of a
board of commissioners composed of the
virtuous Warmoth, Chief Justice Ludeling,
who has just been pronounced sWinder
by the United States Supreme Court, and
John Lynch, who subsequently acquired
distinction as an active member of what
was called the Lynch Returning Board,
that being the celebrated body which
counted in Kellogg as Governor without
having any returns to count. The board
on March /, 1873, reported that the scrip
had been sold at 81 cents per acre but
gave no information regarding the location
of the lands, nor did they deign to say
who were the purchasers at that very


moderate price. Lands appropriated to
New York under the same act brought as


much as FIVE dollars an acre. The money
realized by the sale of scrip amounting Z,
81, $50, after deducting certain expenses,
was invested in Louisiana bonds; but
here, again, the board failed to explain
the price they paid for these securities, or
to say who they bought them from.


Those who know the peculiarities of Lou
isiana radical politicians may be excused


tor suspecting that the board may have


purchased deprecated securities belong
ing to themselves, and charged the State
| a handsome sum for their trouble. At
the time OF the report in 1873 there were
on hand securities nominaily representing
$2US.590. Since then these bonds have
been funded and 10 their place new bonds
obtained to the amount Of Sl97. 800, which
might sell to-day for about $50. 900 cash.


1t should be understood, however, that
the Agricultural College has been estab-
lished in the mean time, and is now in
operation 1t is located in room at the
corner of Common and Barrone streets,


in New Orleans, There is grass plot of


nearly an acre attached to the building in


which the college has its habitation, but


as that belongs to the Medical Institute


and the agricultural students are not al


lowed upon it, practical agriculture is not
carried on there to any great extent.

The Marytaad Lynch ti.0.",,"Quite a number of papers nave con-
dcmned very strongly. the indignant
citizens of Anne Arundel county, Md,
for hanging the negro Sims, after he
committed a horrible outrage on Il
young ladn of that county. The Bal
more Eeening Neacs, however, gives the
following sound and sensible view of
the subject:


Lynch law is dangerous remedy to
apply to crime, for so many good rea-
sons that it is unnecessary to enumer-
ate them. But there are cases when
the outrage is so terrible, and the iden-
tity of the villain so clearly established
that the lack of sufficient Indignation
on the part of neighbors to punish
and avenge it would be discreditable
to the community in which it occurred.
Such was the case on Monday, and,
whilst we!regret that the lynching took
place just as we regret that an occasion
for it should have arisen, We cannot
find it in our hearts to condemn the
men who inflicted very righteous
punishment upon the very worthless
wretch.


Look into every heart to-day and
while there may be upon the surface
a mild protest against mob law in
this case, there will be found in the
depths of every nature q quick pulse
that justifies il it does not actually
applaud the fact. For this was an
exceptional case. The wrong to tina,
young lady was the wrong of every
mother, wife and sister in that section
Her cause was the cause of every
family. Her lifelong injury became
a skeleton for every household. Hel

To self-preservation was added tina
manly impulse of sympathy for ,
neighbor, for a pure good girl, who's
life had been blighted without her in
nocence being impeached. No NOR
foul or terrible wrong, none that woult
cling to her and make life wrecl
like this could have been visited upol
her. Had she been deliberately ant

The water Investigation.",,"


OF MIR. HYDE.


The Water Investigation was brought to an
unexpected termination, last night. Messrs.
Adams, McMenamin, and Lynch of the commit
tee only were present, and in the absence of the
Secretary Mr.. Underwood, JAS. p. Hayes as
sumed his duties. The attendance was about
the same as on Monday night composed mainly
Of basin employees, witnesses for the defence,
who, az the expression Of the insuificency of
the test mony for the prosecution were made by
the members of the committee, gave vent to
their sympathy in applause.


Before any progress was made Mr.. Lynch, of
the Committee, rose to ask how much more time
would be consumed by the Defence, and added
that he was already disgusted with the whole
proceeding. In his opinion he said the charges
were unfounded. Mr.. Hyde, he said further,
had given great satisfaction in his work and had
discharged his duty fully if errors had been
committed they were of the head and not of the
heart. He did not want to waste more time with
this "" nonsense y the other members Of the
committee no thought were equally disgusted
with himself. He moved that the Committee
adjourn SINE die.


Mr.. Bradford said he had host of witnesses
to call aud enough to refute each and every
charge, and he should continue to call them un.
til the committee were satisfied of the ground
lessness OF all the charges II the committee
had heard enough and will vindicate Mr.. Hyde
he would say no more ; he WAS unwilling to stop
until the committee were fully satisfied
Mr.. Adams remarked that 30 far as his obser-
yation had gone he did not think the charges
sustained. He had not been present at all the
meetings OF the Committee, but from what lie
had read in the newspapers he thought he had a
fair conception of what was done IN his absence.
Mr..McMenamin said that the opinions ex-
pressed by the other members OF the committee
had been held by him for some time, and he did
not think single charge had been sustained.
He wanted, however, some further evidence
brought to contradict the statements OF one or
two witnesses for the prosecution on the 4th
and 9th specifications whose testimony seemed
to have some distinctness.


Mr.. Adams, again rising, remarked that there
may have been some little Irregularities and in
discretons in the building of the new basin, bnt
in work of such magnitude, where 30 many
men are employed, the avoidance of such things
| are impossible. In his opinion the work had
been carried on remarkably well, and reflects
great credit on Mr. Hyde.


Mr.. Lynch did not want to make a speech nol
do injustice to the witnesses for the Prosecution
but to one who had sat with the Committee
night after night, as he had done, it must be
clear, he said, that the whole thing WAS a pre-
concerted plan to cut Off Mr.. Hyde's head. The
witnesses, he thought, had drawn on their i'm
| aginations, and he was prepared to sign paper
| of vindcation without further proceedings.
| He believed the work had been well done, and
\ the new pipe had been laid cheaper than eve
before in this city. He, therefore, insisted that
| the investigation stop.


| Mr.. Bradford said chat Mr., Pickles, chairman
| Of the committee, had assured him that the De
| fence should not be pressed for time, and havinI
| already met twelve or thirteen nights he did no
think it hardly fair to close without the commit
tee suggesting to the Defence such resolution
as will exonerate Mr.. Hyde fully.


| Mr.. Lynch did not want to cut off the defence
but he said it was impossible for the defence tt
prove more than had been proven by the wit
nesses for the prosecution.


Mr.. Bradford, anticipating that the investiga
ton would fall through, said he had prepares
the form of report which Mr.. Hyde will be Eat
isfed with, but before accepting this he though
it better to introduce a little more testimony t


fully satisfy the committee on the points sue
gested by Mr. McMenamln.


Mr.. Adams suggested that one or two wit


nesses be called OH each charge, and referred +


4 rule of Council which rendered it mpossibl


for the committee to adjourn SINE die.


Mr.. Bradford here read the following as th


report above alluded to


The Committee appointed to investigate tn
charges brought by Mr.. Jno. W. Hawking, agains
| the present management of the Water Uepari


ment of the city of Wilmington, respectful


reports to.couneil as follows


| That the committee has heard all the ev

the evidence of few of the witnesses on til

said charges have not been sustained and tbs


it is therefore unnecessary to receive furthe

And that in the Judgement of the committe


the Chief Engineer Of the Water Works and til

of the city Of Wilmington should be clearly o,


onerated from said charges.


| The examination of witnesses for the defenc


was then begun, commencing with the secon


specification. MIR. Hyde was put upon the stant


but before he had said only few words NJ
| Lynch again pressed his motion not to go OF


but yielded in Difference to the Defence Th


examination then went on, and both lMr. Hyd


and Mr.. Ford stated there were only about do,

estimated that the agreement saved to the cit

Moses Lewis. They are supposed

The kinston Gazette says Yester-

John [. Brock, residents Of Craven
county. near Dover Station on the At

ceeded to invest fifteen cents with
Lewis Fisher, colored, in friction
matches, and rendered in payment
three five cent nickel coins, which, af-
ter their departure, were discovered
to be counterfeit. They were soon
ARE sted by d. Sheriff Bruton Taylor,
and a considerable number of these
base coins was found ON their persons.
Upon examination then confessed that
they had been engaged in the business
OF counterfeiting these coins about 2
months. One of them, Rhem we be-
lieve, was carried to his home and
there produced the matrix in which
they were moulded It is a rude con-
trivance composed of two pieces of
seasoned hickory timber, into which
the characters on the genuine coin
had been burnt The impressions on
one side were quite distinct but no
one of ordinary intelligence could
have been deceived by them, even in
the dark, as they feel like copper coins
when covered with mercury. The
blockheads are in Jail.


The Tarboro Southerner says
Mr.. VIM. A. Brown, representing a
Philadelphia firm, has purchased for
$25, 0U0 the Mann gold mine property
in Nash county. A quantity of the
machinery has already been received

an early day.


This will be the third in operation

The Raleigh Nea0s says johnson

of those horrible crimes. for which
tardy Justice is slow to reach. About
two weeks ago, Miss Rhode Enniss, a
young lady of highly respectable par

was overtaken by strong, staunch ne

After the morning salutation, he rush
ed upon her and after choking her
useless committed the miserable
crime, for which he will most assur-
edly be hung, provided he does not es-
cape from the Johnson jail where he is
now confined. Those crimes are be-
coming most too frequent in this sec

few instances of Lynch's administra-

effect.

Brogden has refused to interfere with
the course of justice in the case of the
negro Cornelius Williams who is SEN
fenced to be hanged on tomorrow at
the jail in Northampton county. Will

were found guilty of killing Samuel
Preston on June II. 1874, at Weldon

before Judge Henry, and sentenced 10
be hanged on June 1S. The Governor
for good reasons respited them until

for Williams until August 18th and for

dignation by the abduction and subse-

named Ella Balchen, by negro lately
discharged from her mothers employ


that place. 3 idney Brewster, the
perpetrator OF the 1iendish crime, is
coarse looking mulatto of about 2S

was empl = q by Mrs. Balchen as

girls mother states that she Is g little
simple minded, and can be easily per-
suaded. On Sunday night, after prayer
meeting, the girl was missed from her
home, and q vigilant search among
neighbors in the vicinity failed to dis
cover her. Mrs. Balchen became
alarmed and notified the constable of
the loss of her child. She spoke fear
fully about the negro Brewster, whom
she had noticed lettering around the
place on Sunday afternoon. The con-
stable in company with several others,
discovered Miss Balchen on Tuesday
night at the house Of one Of Brewsterfs
companions at Amityville, about four
miles from her home, The girl was

and collected, denying all charges of
criminal action. He was taken in
custody by Arden Wicks, the constable

who were bent on lynching him. Brew
ster was concealed by the constable
until yesterday morning, when he was
taken before Squire James Cooper to
answer the charges against him. The

New Hampshire Races",,"MANCHESTER, n. H., Oct. Sth.-
The third days race of the Merrimac

day, took place to-day. In the 2:5O

are supposed to have been lost.


The Gold Market.


NEW YORK, Oct. Sth.-The gold
speculation was weak and lower to-
day on cable advices of the withdraw
al of gold from the Bank of England
for shipment to this country, and also
report that some gold had been re-
ceived here by express from Califor-
MIA. The Evening Post in its edito-
rial column says: eve hear that sew
eral stock spectators who bought gold
within few weeks on the calculation
that Allen would be elected Governor
of Ohio next week, on the imitation
platform, to-day sold out on advices
from Ohio that he will be defeated
Without doubt the fear of success ol
imitation induced some purchases Of
gold, but the main reason for the high
price is the reduced stock of gold in
the country, but particularly in this
market. Every commercial reason
is in favor of lower premium, as the
country has not had SO much to ex.
pect for many years as now.


The Lang Murder Case.


SUN Cook, n. H., October Sth.-No

quieter, but still think Drew Is guilty
and threaten to lynch him at the frs
favorable opportunity.

New ORLEANS, October Sth.-Twt
weeks ago G. J. Stokes, Judge of tn,
Grant Parish Court, while in this city

of the arrest and the efforts of the de

 Works.",,"In late number of The New York World, we find the following pointed remarks on this subject:

 A couple of years ago the legislature of Iowa, affecting the melting mood and dropping the pitying tear on ac- count of gentleman appointed to die because of mistaken idea of owner ship in another gentleman's life, abol- ished capital punishment. The result has been an immense increase Of capi- tai crimes and a no less immense in crease of lynchings, here, if anywhere and ever, comparatively inexcusable At Des MOines a short time since, there were nine murder cases, all new, on the docket of the criminal court. Last week six murders of peculiar atrocity If there can be said to be a degree of atrocity in crimes against life, were re- ported from various parts of the State. Almost every jail in the State contains a wretch guilty of rape or incest, and offenseS of this nature are literally of daily occurrence. The result will be the establishment of the gallows as soon as the next legislature meets, and in the interim a good deal of irregular hanging It is true that hanging is about as bad a use as man can be put to, but it is no worse than that to which he puts his victim."

The people are utterly unable 10 paw

cause of financial depression is a want

under the Kellogg regime. There are
In this city three or four honorable ex-
ceptIons on the district bench


These are the Immediate causes of
the distress and depression prevailing
The primary cause of all is the per
petual interference by the Federal
Government with local concerns by
means of army aud Federal officials in
New Orleans. Ii the Federal army
had not seized the State House and
controlled the organization # the
Legislature i'll 1872, the McEnery
Government and Conservative Legis-
lature would have peaceable and COM
plete control. II the Federal army
had not demanded the surrender of
the State House and public buildings
on the 18th of September, 1874. the
McEnery Government would have had
complete, undisplted and peaceable
control of the State until the end of
their term of offc and peace and con-
fidence would have been restored. All
we wish. all we need, is to be allowed
to govern ourselves and select our own
Legislature and officers without inter
ference by Federal officials, civil or

THE ALABAMA INVESTIGATION.
MONTGOMERY, December 2l.-The
Congressional Com mittee are ali here
to-day. Republican politicians, gener-
ally men who were defeated for office,
are hanging around them at Opelika.
Albright and Cannon, Republicans.
and Luttrell, Democrat, conducted
the investigation, Coburn and Buck
ner being here. The former had wit
nesses as to many alleged outrages i'll
Lee county, but it is said they were
totally dlscredited Luttreu had wit
nesses who proved that the Govern
ment bacon intended for the over
flowed country was sent to Opelika,
distant 70 miles from the overfowed
region; that it was in charge of Re
publican and carpeI-bag candidates.
He traced three thousand pounds to
one negro meeting house, where the
day before the election it was dis
tributed to Republican voters. No
proof was required as to destination.
He would prove the use made of
more of it, but witnesses were
spirited away from the reach of
the Sergeant-at-Arms. Some negroes
swore they had been discharged for
voting the Republican ticket, while
others swore they had been beaten by
Republican negroes and turned out of
their churches, and generally mis-
treated for being Democrats. Negroes
testified that before the late election
the Republican candidate promised to
divide the white Democrats, land
among them and their furniture and
bedding and household property
The negro witnesses all complained of
none of thei1 premises being kept, and
some of them were anxious to know if
the Congressman had come down here
to see that they got their forty acres
and mule. To-day Messrs. Buckner
and Luttrell had many witnesses to
prove the improper use of the over
flowed bacon in this district, but the
mojority of the committee would not
allow them to be examined, giving
as their excuse that the bacon bUsi-
mes was not covered by the reso-
luton under which they were sent

For the following brief record Of the

during the memorable year that has

THE SOUTHERN TROUBLES.


The condition of several of the
Southern States during the year gave
occasion for an uneasiness on the part
of tue country, and the appointment
of investigating committees ID some
instances by Congress. At the be
ginning of the year serious difficulty
arose in Texas between the incoming
and outgoing Governors and their
partisans. Governor Davis, the old
Governor, a Republican, claimed the
office until April 18. while the new
Governor, Mr.. Coke, Democrat, ln-
sisted that his term began at once
There was an assembling OF armed
men in Austin, the capital, and at one
time the aspect of affairs was grave,
but after Davis appeal to the Presi-
dent for assistance and his receipt OF
a telegram from the Attorney General
announcing that the Executive would
not interfere, he surrendered January
10. and Governor Coke was duly in
stalled. The Baxter Brooks war in
Arkansas broke out April Is. Chief
Justice Mcclure, Senators Clayton and
Dorsey. and the carpet baggers' ring
in Arkansas, finding that they could
not make a tool of Gov. Baxter, whom
tehy had fraudulently counted in to
office, resolved to oust him. Accord
ingly decision Of the Supreme Court
declared that Brooks (who has since
sold himself to the ripg was the
rightful Governor, was sprung upon
the State Brooks and his fol-
lovers seized the State Honse III
Little Rock and fortified the
approach to it Governor Bax-
ter issued a proclamation calling
out the State troops and counter
proclamation wea issued by Brooks,
and III response to their calls armed
men focked into the capital col

April 30, III which the Brooks party
waa r4pulsed with ioss Of rine killed

and thirty policemen were killed. In
the discontinue Of the police the KeI-
log Government vanished like mist.

proceeded at once and quietly to iD-

entire State of Louisiana passed over
into the hands of the proper authori-
ties i'll a day, and without further re-
sistence on the part of the usurper's

emerged from the Custom House and,
protected by Federal bayonets, re-

to the November election the efforts of
the citizens were directed toward OBJ
tanning a fair representation on the
Registry and Returning Boards. In
this they fai ed, and Notwithstanding
that they carried the State in Novem-

and a majority of the |
Legislature, they were cheated of their |
victory by the manipulation of the |

Board. As the year closed affairs in |
the Crescent City are i'll critical con-
dition. There were disturbances in |
the State of Mississippi in July and |
December. In the former month Act |
ing Governor Davis asked the Presi- |
dent for troops for partisan purposes
in Vicksburg, but without success. |
December 7 fight took place in Vicks-
burg between the whites and negroes.
which grew out of the attempt of the |
latter to install as sheriff a negro man
who had given no bonds, as r. quired
by law. A large number of negroes
were killed in the controversy, and the
Sheriff resigned. Gov. Ames called
an extra session of the Legislature, and
The President issued his chronic pro-
amation desiring the rebels to ''dis-
perse,"" and all was quiet at the last
advices. The lynching of several negro
prisoners by masked band in Gibson
,o.nty, Tenn, in August, again led to
Federal interference, Notwithstanding
he willingness of the State authorities

wrong. The circumstance was used by
he Republican party press as ""out-
age material, but without effect.

that he apprehensive the South would be received

the case. Governor Kemper is anxious see grand

understood that the Governor thinks it would be unbe

in the newspaper and job departments, has
been put up at an expense of over seventy
five thousand dollars. lis first number
was printed on common single-cylinder
Hoe press, and, in this regard, its iac'iltes
were enlarged as its increasing business
and now the NATIONAL REPUB-
LIcAN is printed on the largest fonr-cylinder
Hoe press in the world, and its quarto edi-
tions, sometimes issued for months in sue
cession, as occasion requires, are the largest
the very largest-in the world. The
facilities Of the composing room and print
ing department of the NATIONAL Re
PUBLICAN are unrivaled, and one single
issue within the year filled sixty closely
printed pages Of news matter, being
the largest known in all the newspaper
history of the world. 1t was one of the
historical events in journalism, and was
editorially commented upon by nearly all
the newspapers in the country, and is here
mentioned in illustration of the tremen-
duous advance the NATIONAL. REPUBLICAN
has made from an humble commencement
TO its present dignity and power.


Another item of proper local reference
lies In the advertising columns. Turning
to our first issue we find several merchants
and business men occupying space which
they still claim; among them may be men
toned Mr.. Markriter, very prominent in
his business of paperhangings, &c. He,
too, has been prosperous and largely, be-
cause he has been steady in his friendship
and business with the press. Mr.. ]. w.
Thompson, our well-known and useful
citizen and president of a line of steamers
and other corporations, advertised his then
business as q gasftter, &C., in the first is
sue. So did Mr.. Jesse B. Wilson, and
steadily till he retired from the grocery
business wealthy man. The auctioneers,
Wall & Barnard, now Wall & Co., have
their business prominently displayed In
the first ISSUE MIR. B. II. Stinemetz, the
king of Washington matters, has grown
rich while steadily occupying our columns
for fifteen years. James Y. Davis name
is also in the first issue, and his es-
tablishment has always had very
prominent place in the hat and fur trade.
Then there are the names of the we'll
known tailor, E. NJ. Drew; the noted
druggist, Mr.. Charles Stott, and that
of the distinguished firm of Brown
ing & Keating, now Browning s.
Middleton, and several others of our busi-
ness firms, recognizing, from the outset, the
advantages of the NATIONAL REPUBLICAN,,
and perhaps foreseeing the results of the
great civil war then coming on, became its
early business patrons, and all of them. as
a rule, have been highly prospered. Early
in its infancy, as now, the proprietor
directed the most liberal treatment toward
all patrons, and in every proper
way felt it both a duty and
pleasure TO assist in strengthening the
business and building up the fortunes of
his fellow-citizens, realizing the great fact
that in the prosperity of individuals city
is built up. 1t Is also worthy of note here
that this article has been in part set by
compositors who worked on the first issue
of this journal, and have been with it con-
stanuy, who have grown up with it. and
who have established their own homes
from wages received. The steady employ
ment of competent persons in its various
departments is also illustrated by the fact
that Mr.. William Il. Pope has occupied the
responsible position of business manager
since November 26, 1860.


The principal Republican association in
Washington In 1860 was called the ""Na-
tional Republican Association"" Mr.. B.
B. French was its president; j. ]. Coombs,
vice president; Martin Buell., second vice
president; Lewis Clephane, secretary;
Woodford Stone, treasurer, and John
Hines, G. Il. Plant. Job w. Angus, ]. F.
Hodgson. James Lynch, G. R. Wilson and
Henry NJ Knight executive committee.
There were also three or four ward Repub.
ican associations, but the Republican party
in this District was at the time exceedingly
weak and just as unpopular. but gradually
political power in this District passed into
Republican hands, and in all the glorious
results which have followed, the NATIONAL
REPUBLICAN has had its natural and legiti-
mate share as the powerful advocate of i'm
provement as the unfinching friend of the
best interests of the District, and as the
staunch supporter of the faith of the
Republican party. We cannot look over
the past history and present position
of the NATIONAL REPUBLICAN with any
other feeling than that of pride. Its pro-
prietor feels that he has been conscientious
in the discharge Of his duties to the public,
and that no man and no interest has been
in any way intentionally wronged; but on
the contrary, he sees in the steady support
given TO the Advancement and adornment
of Washington the conservation of the true
interests of all citizens, without regard to
political affiliation. The NATIONAL Re-
PUBLICAN will continue straight on in its
course, independently working for what
its management conceiyes to be right in the
interests of the nation from a political
and gentlemen recognized as
leaders in the Republican party will be no
more likely to escape censure, if deserved,
than they ever have been. The interests
of the people of the District from a local
standpoint will also be carefully guarded as"

accident it was distinctly understood that

SCENE OF THE OUTRAGE


was one and three quarter miles from Odenton,
in the direction Of Baltimore on the farm Of Mr.
John jackson, aged about eighty years, where
he, with his wife and several sons and daughters,
resides. The family are in comfortable crcum-
stances but, like. many Of the residents in the
counties, the sons and daughters perform nearly
all the farm duties and household work. Mr..
jackson had informed his sons that IL was his wish
to complete some farm work by noon, and that II
they succeeded he would give them half holi-
day. On this account all the male members OF
the family left the house and had been actively at
work planting corn in q field some distance from
the dwelling during the entire morning. About
10 O'Clock Mrs. Jackson and one or two Of her
daughters also went to the field, leaving Miss
Adeline jackson in the house for the purpose of
preparing dinner. After having been engaged in
her household duties until about IL O'Clock, Miss
jackson walk ed TO spring short distance from
the dwelling for the purpose Of procuring some
fresh water, taking with her couple Of water
pals Soon after she left the house the negro (as
was alterWard ascertaines) entered, and procured
3 shotgun that had been left standing behind the
door, and rapidly making his way by circuitOus
route reached the spring before his victim arrived,
and concealed himself behind q tree. Miss Jack
son, after drawing the water, was in the act OF
leaving, when the negro made his appearance in
q state of great excitement and requested her to
give him drink OF water. She was in the act OF
complying with his request when he seized her by
the throat and dragged her some distance to
cluDp Of bushes, holding the loaded gun in one
. fnL has aha cfokn
Notwithstanding these threats she fought despe-
Iately to escape, and during the struggle that
enEued her clothing was torn into shreds and her
face and neck terribly cut and bruised. The negro
did not relax his grasp on her throat, thus pre-
venting her from making any outcry, and she was
finally


RENDERED UNCONSCIOUS


from the brutal treatment received at his hands,
and while in this condition she was foully out
ragged by the fend, who remained at the scene
about half an hour, near as can be as1ertained,
amer ptrpei.s ting the horrible crime, Upoh Te-
covering her CONSEQUENCES Miss Jackson dis
covered that her Gss3ilant had disappeared. She
was at tirst unable to move, but after several
efforts succeeded in raising herself from the
ground and walking in the direction Of the field
where her brothers were at work, who were at
tracted by her screams for assistance, and at
once camO to her aid. Mr.. Elijah e. Jackson, a
justice OF the peace for Anne Arundel county.
found Miss jackson (who is his step-slster) una
BILE TO mOveJ and scarcely able to explain that
she had been the victim of an outrage by an un-
known negro. Her clothing was torn to pieces.
while her face ard neck were bruised and Scared
evidence OF the brutal treatment she had re-
ceived. She was assisted to the dwelling and
received the necessary medical attendance. 1t is
impossible TO state whether her injuries will re-
suit seriously, and while her condition is neces-
sarily critical, her friends do not anticipate
fat al result. Miss Jackson 1t may be said, is

Within less than an hour after the crime had
been committed intelligence OF tho affair had been
to OGentOn and vicinity, and the
residents were soon in state of great excitement
over the bigh-handed outrage. 1t was s0On de-
teTmiued 10 leave nothing undene to arrest the
cf ught his life would be forfeited for his crime.
Open threats OF lynchiDg or shooting were made.
Being q stranger in the neighbOrhOOd, it was
impossible to cause warrant for his arrest to be
issued, and when this became known IcYcral OF
the young men in the neighbOrhOOd


PROMPTLY ORGANIZED


themselves into raiJlng party, and started In
pursuit of the negro, wRo, when last seen, was
going in the direction Of the marsh, or swamp,
where lie doubtless hoped to conceal him self uutl
nightlAll, fnd then ma ke his escape. Several OF
the raiding party were mounted, and others went
on foot, for the purpose oil searching the marsh.
the party OF pursuers were Messrs. Joseph ].
Clarke, Wm. z. Pumphrey, Isaiah w. PUN.
phrey, William Wheat, John Lowman, James
clancy and Charles Hammond, and il was their
expressed determination not 70 abandon the
search until they captured the negro or were as
sured that he had gotten beyond their reach.


DESCRIPTION OF THE NEGRO


The negro, who, as already stated, was
stranger in the neighborhOod, was a full-blOOded
African stout build, and little below the medium
stature. He wore mUstache, side "" whiskers and
gOatGe, and was dressed IN a suit Of dark plaid
cloth with broad black binding, and wore a
black slOuch hat. He had been in the neighbor-
hood two or three days, having been seen on
Wednesday at the residence Of Mr.. Thomas Dis
ney, where he applied and asked to be shown a
place where he could get work picking strsWber-
Ties. Twice on Thursday he appeared at Mr..
JacksCn's house, and doubtless fully acquainted
himself with the movements Of the family before
bOlical crime. Up TO late hour last night his
pursuers had not succeeded in capturing him, and
II is feared that he has escaped""


HIS CAPTURE.


Those who started in pursuit of the iend leit no
spot for miles around the place where the outrage
was committed uncovered. All day Sunday
armed en- could be seen securing the country
around and even darkness seemed to give them
more determination. Pickets were thrown out,





where the fugitive was supposed to be secreted.
Tuesday morning Mr.. Caleb Phelps, residing on
StOney Run, on arising, found some foot tracks
near his chicken house, and had his suspicious
that the loOked-fOr negro had been around. Call
ing his neighbors-Messrs. Columbus Gailor and
and Thomas NJ. COle-they sOincided in opinion
with him, and, arming themselves, they renewed
the search. In a short time they saw smoke as.
eending in an unaccustomed place, and, going
towards 1t, found q negro answering to the de-
scriptiOn given by Miss jackson. He had built a
FIRE, at which he was cooking his breakfast. As
soon as he saw them he got up and exclaimed,
you've catehed me-"" They then ordered him
TO drop his musketi and he came towards them
with a large knife, but dropped it also when or.
dered. They then started with him to the resi-
depce Of Mr.. Jackson, about i've miles distant


He did not manifest the least concern about his
arrest, and walked along with his captors quietly
While he was being conveyed to the residence OF
Mr.. Jackson he stated that his name was John
Smms, from Richmond. He had been dredging
for oysters during the season, since which time
he has been roaming around the country. He is a
fuII-blooded African, about twenty-five years old
and is q short, stout built man, who would weigh,
perhaps, one hundred and fifty or one hundred
and sixty pounds. He was dressed in a suit Of
WeIl-WOrn, dark plaid clothing and SLOUGH hat.


THE RECOGNITION.


On reaching the residence Of Mr. Jackson he
was taken before the girl, who recognized him as
the party who had committed the outrage.
commitment was made out BY Mr.. Elijah Jack
son, and the wretch was taken to Annapolis I'm the
$50 q. N. train. The scene when the brute was
brought into the presence Of bis victim was most
pitiful, and what made 1t the worse was his &C.
knowledging in the most impertinent manner that
he had committed the deed,


The news Of his capture brought together at
Odenton an excited crowd. Some favored lynch.
ing as the only proper mode OF punishment, aud,
as the prisoner had acknowledged the commits.
sion Of the act, It wa: said that the sooner the

Immediately afSer the reading OF the journal the
Senate resumed tho consideration Of tho resou.
ton for the admission OF Mr.. Pinchback and Mr.
MKnRMoN, (dem.) OF N. c., continued his argu.
ment. He cited various prtcedents to show the
practice OF the Senate had not been to seat
Senator'S on prt,nd fdcfe case. In tho case oil
stark from Oregon, in 1862. the credentials were
IN due form, he having been appointed by the
Governor to I'LL vacancy; but. when the creden-
tlas were presented, 1t was suggested by some
Senator that stark had used language hostile to
the government, and the creden tals were referred
for investigation.


He was finally admitted, though not until after
she investigation had been mace.


Mr.. MERRIMoN next referred 10 the cases of
Messrs. Goldthwaite, from Alabama; Blodgett
from Georgia, and Ransom, from North Carolina,
and said they were not seated on prtnsa Jracte
case but their credentials were referred. lie
next read from the report OF Mr. TrumDull or ILL
nOis, made to the Senate in 1878 and argued that
Inc McEnery or fusion ticket had a majority OF
10000 votes in the election OF 1872. If Judge
Durell had not interered yhe McEnery govern.
ment would have been quickly organized and ac-
quiesced IN by the people. He could NOT see how
any man having fair and just mind could doubt
the fact that McEnery was elected. the Senate
knew, the country knew aud the world knew
that the McEnery government was su Impressed by
the federal army. The President in his message
told Coneress that but ior the presence OF tne



ment could not stand in LOUISIANA an nour. Tue
Lynch Board, whica counted in Kellogg, never
mad any existence ln Law. IL was abolished by the
act OF March 20, 1872 Even II It had legal exist.
ence 1t never had any vote before 1t to count and
therefore never ascerJained mat Kellogg was
elected Governor. rne De Ferrat Returning Board
was tho legal board and had the vote before 1t.
THIS board 1ound That McEnery was elected. The
Senator from Indiana (Alr. Morton) had declared
the action OF the supreme Court Of Louisiana was
binding upon Congress. tie tMr. Merrlmon) denied
tnat was. Tne power OF the Senate to determine
elected n
and could not be abridged oy any federal or Stale
authority. In the leaong decision OF that Court,
quoted by the senator from lndiana, 1t was PLAIN
that the Court had no jurisdiction. ana therefore
the decision had no weight or effect whatever.
ana mad conspired with the Kellogg government
TO sustain and uphold it, Some ol the judges of
that Court were under direct Obligations to kel-
logg James F. Casey. IN telegram to the
President. dated December II, 1872, 81 ated
that the supreme Court was known

opinion OF the Court before the decision relied
upon by the Senator from Indiana (Mr Morton)
was rendered? Every man having any sense OF
justice must acknowledge that any Sci OF judges
giving :heIr opinions on such uestons in advance
deserved to be impeached and turned OUT OF
ollce. He then referred to tue resolution of the
House OF Representatives, recognizing the Kellogg
government. and argued that the House mad
right TO pass that resolution. Where was the
authority under the constitution for The House to
recognize any State government? Neither could
the senate pass such reso luton. All the senate
could DO was to say whether PlachpacS should be
admitted as SENATOR rom the state OF
LOUISIANA. He argued that the House
had stultfed Itself by the passage OF thar
resolution, as 1t had refused TO seat members
elected on the Kellogg ticket and had seated mem.
bers elected on the McEnery ticket. lie denied
that Kellogg was the de JictO Governor OF Loulsi-
ana, and read various authorities to show what
constituted de JGcto officer Kellogg, not being
Governor de G7ctO or Governor de jore, was
mere naked usurper. lie ne xt spoke OF the duties
oil the federal government under the guarantee
clause OF the constitution, and said the PresidenC
had erred IN MIS- course toward Louisiana. He
(Mr. Merrimon) now asked tnat the President
should correct his own error. II he would not do
1t then 1t was the duty OF Congress to 90 so. He
mad hoped tnat the President would rise above
oil parry feelings, ana all Presidents should be
above party interests. The President, looking only
to the constitution. should correct mis- own error
and spurn tne bad men who have led MN astray.
IL he (Mr. Merrim0n) was o republican, support
ing the administration, he would a0vlse the Pres.
ident to correct his error. Kellogg ought TO be
displaced by the President. ii he would not do IT.,
then Congress should do It and allow the lawful
government OF the State 30 take It's place. For
one he was ready now to cast his vote against the
admission oil tnls applicant ana also TO reverse the

OUTRAGE ON A LADY By A coLoRED MAN
--PERPETRATIoN OF A SHOCKING CRIME
ON DEFENsELEss woMAN-swIFr RE.
TRIBuTIoN.


(From the Baltimore Sum-


Monday night shocking outrage was
perpetrated in Prince Georges county,
| Md, on the wife of Mr.. Edgar A. Mel
afterwards shot himself out of remorse
was arrested, and subsequently, while on
his way to jail at upper Marlboro was ta-
ken by II crowd OF citizens, whites and
blacks, from the hands of his legal GUS
todian and hanged to tree. The negro
was employed on the farm of Mr.. Nell
son, known as the Motley Hall estate,
which Mr.. Nelson. who came from the
North, purchased few years ago in
Prince Georges county, nearly opposite
Alexandria, Va, and seven miles below
] Washington city. A similar case of this
kind occurred in the same community
some two years ago for the same offense
| A Sun correspondent visited the resi-.
dence of Mr.. Edgar A. Nelson, at Motley
Hall, yesterday evening, and ascertain
ed the facts in relation to the lynching
to be as follows: Mr.. Nelson left home
on Monday evening for Washington, in
tending to return next morning. He
left his wife at home, as also the colored
man, named John Henry Scott. The
room occupied by Scott was in the lower
part of the house. About twelve O. clock
Monday night, while Mrs. Nelson was
sleeping, he entered the room with a
lamp in his hand. She was awakened
| by the noise, and rising up in bed asked
him what he wanted. At this he point
ed a revolver at her head and informed
her of his purpose, saying that if she re-
fused he would kill her and her baby,
| which lay by her side and is 18 months
of age. She tried by every possible eff
| fort to make him desist, but was unsuc-
cessful. By main force, holding the re-
volver in his hand. he accomplished his
purpose and left the room, leaving Mrs.
| Nelson in an unconscious state. He re-
turned to her room about an hour after
and said he intended to kill her child
and herself, and then himself, as he was
| tired of living, as his sistershad become
| IL @ mother of an illegitimate child, and
that he was disgraced thereby. He then
| told her he intended to outrage her again
and by the same threats he succeeded.


Then leaving the bed he said he
knew he would be killed for his acts,
and that he would save her husband
thai trouble by -ooting himself,
which he did, shooting himself in the
left breast Mrs. Nelson, taking ad.
vantage of this, ran out of the house
in her night clothes with her infant in
her arms, and informed q neighbor, a
colored man, residing near by. Tins
Ian, named Morris, Immediately ran
to the house, where he found Scott
suffering from his wound. Mrs. Mel
son was unable to say anything, ex.
cept that ""John shot himself"" Nor
ris then ran after DIR. Bayre, who
lives near by, and also Justice R.


Walter Brooke, who with DR.. Bayne
soon arrived at the house. Towards
daylight Mrs. Nelson regained hei
senses and told what occurred, when
Mr.. Brooks took her affidavit. He
then ordered the commitment of Scott
to Marlboro Jail, and deputized Cur.
tbs Smith to take him there. Mr.
Smith started with the prisoner short
ly after eight O'Clock, when he was
met at the door by u crowd of at least
one hundred persons, colored and
white, all of whom were masked


They told Mr. Smith of their purpose


and took Scott away from him. Pla
cling him on a horse they rode him in


to hollow, when placing new man


lila rope about his neck, one end OF


which was tied to n black walnut tree


they drove the horse away, leaving


his body swinging in the March wind
The crowd then dispersed quietly, thu
; colored people in the crowd making
arrangements to roast the body, hav
ing gone so far as to collect a quantity
of wood and brush for that purpose
This, however, was not allowed, anC
the body was left hanging to the tree


1t was cut down about three o'clock
and coroner's jury summoned, who


after hearing all the evidence, return
cd verdict ""that the deceased wa


hung by persons unknown to thu
jury"" The body was then placed il


coffin ordered from Alexandria, an(
will be buried tomorrow.


Mr.. Nelson has resided at Motley
Hall for five years, and is greatly re
spected by all persons, white and col


ored, in the ncighborhood. Scott wa
twenty three years of age, and hat


resided with Mr. Nelson for one year


He had often been left in the houst


with Mrs. Nelson, having some month"";
since stayed there three weeks Will,


Mr.. Nelson went to his home in Madi


son county, New York, to attend th'


funeral of his father. Mrs. Nelson
, last evening, was in very nervou


condition, but out of danger. Th


affair has created the greatest excite


ment in the neigborhood. Mr.. Mel


son was one of the judges of election
of Spalding district, and q republican
in politics, and had treated the negr,


with familiarity."

got chance 20 dray breath one or then num-
eaEs lng TO his feet AMI moved 10 adjourn, but the
lid lost by i loud and icrocious '','on
tnat must have been lizard BY the people down
Pennsylvania avenue. The democrats quite


through with the businesslhey had In hand Revenge
was sweet They had tier opponents in chanccry,
and were gong 10 make al things even Adjournment
was out OF the question ioia few minutes Strangely
enough the demoralized minority ever compact and
cool In previous contests with tho other SIDE missed
their chance at this moment TO nlbustcr With the
motion TO adjourn lost TINY could have moved 10 nd
journ to particular tme aud have
sayed on vote kr the day f not in
definitely But the fact hey lost their head literally
and politically, for theii leader ex-Spcakcr Blaine
thought OF fsht .lan Of strategy and left the
rank and 1le TO their own resources Tho in the
group OF republican menlers had become painiul
to witness Environed by the democrats and watched
by the galleries the devoted band was the picture OF
despair and desperation. they eynced their anxiety
shifting uneasly from seal seat rising and going
about from one place TO another pursuit of advice in
twisting their boards, and in clutching OF the
hands. The roll call began dozen more broke and
to the cloak Al the Clerk reached the
OF James G. Blaine there was a hush and
deep momentary Stiffness The name was

pury form Of the gentleman from Maine being invis-
ibe to the thousands of eyes directed toward his
cant chair utter, laugh, and then broad gunaw
greeted the ingorious absence Of the republican cap
tain. Taking time by the foreock he had waited not
for tho announcement Of his distinguished cog
nomen, but as the Clerk had reached
General Banks among the BIS, the exSpeaker beat
rapid retreat to the cloak room and more
in the House until the little unpleasantncss over
General Garfield was among the panic-stricken
fugitives who at the first fire. but he recovered
his self possession, reformed in good order marched
back and the going of the roll for absensees
he vaantly recorded himself against a third
term. The agony was now nearly over. pause
ensued the clerk footed up the result and
232 votes against third term and Is favor OF third
term. The democracy are jubilant their triumph
and Springer is the lion of Washington tonight
as he doubtless will be for the rest OF tho session. The
eighteen third likewise but less gorously
conspicuous although many OF their republican
colleagues envy them their pluck, as day
OF reckoning must for all OF the
discounted minority who voted against


third term and win have to explain themselves at the
White House The spectre OF forfeited patronage and
revoked appointments peers from behind the record
Of todays vote. Tho happy eighteen need fear
in the long list of ofceholders
in their districts They can dictate to their
constituents what terms Of service they may choose
They Of various hues II is true but the fact will
to confirm the historical truth that the coored
troops fought noby."" OF the uninching eighteen six

the proceedings OF Congress will repay perusal and
reveal some singular Inconsistencies to people dwelling
under the shadow of the White House


At the termination of the voting Blaine came back to
his seat and was heard few minutes later in some
new matter. He frankly avowed that he had lodged
and explained that he could vote either way with
out appearing in the be ambitious OF being
Grants and in the other of displeasing his
friends Springer, when complmented his MASTER
piece of strategy and asked how he had to intro
duce the resolution, said


GENrLExRN--I am Methodist but am opposed to
third term. SO when Bishop Haven down there in
Boston the other day put Grant up for another term
thought would show the country that all Methodists
not for rant and wanted to just how Con-
gress stood on the same question.


These his words just about they dropped from
his lips in conversation the Speakers desk after
the adjournment One two OF those who
voted against the resolution say that they
did because they considered that the
House had business with the subject
at all, and that 1t nonsense The eighteen-or
rather the Northern part of them-have already begun
feel the force OF ridcule. There is no
doubt that tho fear of losing patronage con.
trolled the votes OF the white Southern rcpub-
lcans who voted against the resolution. The coored
members are probably either third termers or knew
that their constituents One Rainey OF South Car
ona voted for the resolution. He has third

The lynching of the negro Sims, for


committing an outrage upon the person


OF Miss .Adeline Jackson, of Anne


Arundel county, took place this morn


ing, about two o'clock. About fifty


masked men rode to the Jail and de-


mandcd entrance. Upon being refused,


they forced an entrance through the


rear door, overpowered the keepers
! and proceeded to the cell of Sims, who


with two other prisoners, was secured


to the floor with leg irons. Upon


reaching the cell they pinioncd his.


Sims, arms, and carried him out into


tho country TO place called Ozark


woods"" where they hanged him to o
tree. This morning coroncr's jury
proceeded to hold an inquest, the YER
dict OF which was that the said Simms
came to his death at the hands of per-
sons unknown to the jury.


A LEADER RECOGNIZED.


1t is reported that one of the leaders
In this daring raid was recognized by
the Jallor, and is one of the most re-
spectacle citizens in the nelghborhood
where Sims committed his heinous
crime.


The lynchers did not wait for their
victim to get on his clothes when they
got into his cell, but took him to the
place OF execution without hat coat or
shoes, and with his manacles still upon
him as they were wrenched from their
fastenings.


AN INOuEsT


An inquest was held this morning
over the body of the dead man, and
the usual verdict in such cases, that
the hanging was done by mob of
persons to the jury unknown.


THE LYNcuERs ORGANIZED.


1t is reported that the vigilantes met
last night about nine o'clock, number
ing at least one hundred and fifty.
with blackened faces, masked and
otherwise disguised under preconcer-
ted plan. Evidently there was some
understanding, for the body came to-
gethcr. from all parts of the county
around and prepared. Most of them
were ON horseback, but few did not
have horses and followed the main
body to Annapolis on hand cars.


MEETINGS OF TIE LyN-


CHEERS.


The citizens of the south fourth
election district and other parts of
Anne Arundel county had quietly dis
cussed tho proposed lynching for sever
al days after the outrage. On Wednes-
day some twenty-four citizens met and
agreed upon resolutions setting forth
the reason which they felt wound jus.
tify them in taking the law in their
own hands. The following are the re-
solutions adopted at that meeting: Ii


THE FATAL RESOLUTIONS.


Fellow Citizens-In view of the fact
hat we are about to take into ourown {
hands the sword of justice to do to
leatl one who is now in the county
Jail, it is to meet that we shall give
'ome reasons for the purpose we hope
% consummate.


First. Then while we can but honor :
he deep feeling of interest manifested
by those who are the proper guardians s
II our lives. our property and our hon I
'r; and while we are true and loyal I
citizens of the State of Maryland and b
If Anne Arundel county, do bend to
he supreme Majesty of the law and
acknowledge trials by jury as the very
lrchst one in the grand sacrifice of hu- !
nan rights, still we know to the vilest !
criminal is accorded the same rights ,
Inder the law that belong to the petty Z
hief, nor can this devil incarnate, a
hould he claim his rights, be denied I
he privilege of change of venue, S

West Chester, Pa, last week, Charles


Williams, aged 10 years, was arraigned
charged with gross libel ON the pastor
and Officers of the first Presbyterian
Church of that borough. The libel
consisted in the assertion OF gross i'm
morality on the part of the pastor; that
he was being tried before committee
of the church, and that he would be
acquitted, though the testimony against
him was SO damaging that there was
danger of his being lynched. Williams,
on the stand, confessed that he had
sent the article to the New York paper
in which it was published, and alleged
that his only object was the amusement
he derived in creating a sensation. he
was found guilty on the two counts OF
libel of the paster and officers OF the
church and was fined $50 90 and costs."

Democratic Party assumed to be the
Party of Economy and Reform i'll all

To this the Democrats are each and all
fairly committed. They are bound in
honor to reduce the taIes if they can do
so the coming year. The opposition will.

have promised fairly, reduce the taxes

RED OAK, Iowa, July l9, 1875.


A horrible murder was committed about
three miles from this place last evening.
The particulars are as follows: Some time
since Dr. Hatton, a prominent physician
and surgeon of this town, was called to at
tend the wife of Fred Mewherder, promi-
nent citizen living few miles in the coun-
try. She was delivered Of child, and
Mewherder claims that there was malprac-
tice on the part Of the doctor, and
that the mother is injured beyond
surgical aid. On yesterday evening New
herder was riding along the road armed
with Spencer rifle, and met DIR. Hatton,
when he Immediately raised his gun and
fired, shooting him through the body. The
ball went in at the side and came out near
the spine, and there is no hopes of the doc
tors recovery. Mewherder fled as soon ""a
he fired the fatal shot, and has not since
been heard from. DR.. Hatton is respec-
tably connected and has hosts of friends
here, and they freely threaten lynching if
the murderer is captured. There is great
excitement in the community over the hor-
rible deed."

A report says: The scenes last night
and to- day in the school house basement,
where the bodies of the dead were car.
ried, were heartrending in the extreme.
In some instances features were distorted
as though extreme agony had been suf-
fered before death, but many looked calm
as though smothered. All were BACKED
with smoke; some burned beyond the pos.
sibility of Identification, nothing remain
ing but the trunk.


A few incidents Of the terrible disaster
additional to those already given in the
DISPATCH are as follows:


The hero Of the disaster was John
Lynch, q brave fireman, who was first to
respond to the alarm. lie described the
scene when he reached the burning
church as appalling. Wedged tight and
unmovable in the doorways was dense
mass of humanity. from six to eight feet
in height, none Of them able to stand up.
right from the terrible pressure of the
crowd behind; while on and over them q
sheet of fire rolled like a wave, streaming
far out behind into the open air. With
out moments pause to consider their
danger, Lynch and Chief Engineer Mul.
len rushed into the flames, spurred on by
the piteous cries, ""For Gods sake come
and help us - and began pulling out the
bodies.


A moment later we'll directed n.y.
drant stream from Mount Holyoke hose
struck the brave rescuers, and undoubted-
ly saved them from being burned alive.
The first persons drawn out were burn
ing, but they were passed directly
through the stream Of water and the
flames were extinguished. Some of the
poor creatures fell fainting on the long
flight of stairs leading down to the street,
and few were able to walk. By this time
the entire fire department had arrived,
and worked with such energy that when
the fire was extinguished the charred
wooden walls were standing, and were
pulled down by the hook and ladder men,
in order that search for the bodies could
be made. Only very few moments,
comparatively, elapsed after the water
struck the building before the fire was
out; but the destruction Of life during
that brief period was terrible. Some
sprang from the gallery windows, and
were severely injured, and and one per-
son appeared at window completely
wrapt in flames, and after tottering there
an instant, fell to the ground dead and
Hundreds of men went
to the wreck as soon as opportunity
offered, to search for the bodies, and a
force of police was organized to keep back
the large crowd which had gathered.


The greater number of bodies were
found in the fatal entry way, burned,
some of them, to crisp. The body Of
one woman was foupd in the seat she had
occupied, her clothing entirely burned
off. A flcshy woman, weighing some l8O
pounds, was dragged screaming from the
mass. She was carried short distance
from the church and placed on the grass,
while the flesh actually peeled of her
back. In a moment she fell over dead.


One of the most protracted cases of
suffering was that of Mary Dajerdan, who
was burned past all recognition and
blind. Somehow she found her way to
the hill north of the church, and wan
dered around there about twenty minutes
before she was found and taken to her
home, where she died about IL o'clock
this morning, having fingered Is
hours in fearful agony.


The fate of Annie Menver and her
lover was touching event of the fire.
She was the organist for the evening in
the absence Of the regular one, and was
cut off from escape. When the church
was burning her lover escaped, but, find
ing that she was still within, turned to
rescue her, was overcome with the flames
and perished with her.


A coroner's jury has been summoned
for Monday.

 The centennial of the battle of Bunker Hill was gloriously celebrated in Boston by an im- metse throng of people gathered from all parts of the country. The exercises began at five o'clock in the morning by Imaginable parade of the Antiques and Horribles, pat termed after the carnival at Rome. The grand procession started about noon, and consisted of military of all the New England States, New York, Maryland, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Washington, D. O., together with Masons, Army of the Republic, Knights of Pythias and other benevolent and mechanical associations, concluding with hundreds of wagons containing implements and products representing the in- dustries of Boston and vicinity. The buildings along the line of march were richly and taste- fully decorated, and everything and everybody was in holiday attire. As the brilliant pageant marched proudly along, the cheers from the immense crowds on the sidewalks rang out in continuous applause; the various Southern regiments in particular receiving the heartiest commentators possible. The stand at Bunker Hill monument contained Vice-President Will son, the governors of some dozen different States, with thelr staffs, many members of Congress, officers of the regular army and navy, including Gen. Sherman, and the mayors of all the principal cities within five hundred miles. The procession started so late that it was seven o'clock before the rear of the column reached Bunker Hill monument and conse- quently the literary exercises were necessarily surtailed. After prayer and song by glee club, Gen. Chas. Devens, the orator of the day, delivered short oration, descriptive of the battle one hundred years before and the results which had sprung from it. Addresses were also made by Hon. G. W. Warren, Gen. sher- man, Gov. Hartranft, of Pennsylvania, and Gov. Bedle, of New Jersey. Everything passed off admirably, and these competent to judge stated that never before had Boston contained so many people in one day. saf

tiOnal particulars:


The guard aud prisoner proceeded to Odenton'

ing train had passed by for Annapolis. Upon the
train were his ExCellency Governor James BLACK
GroOne, Hon. Barnes Compton, State treasurer;
Hon. a. P. GrOOme, John p. Poe, esq, Benjamin
FaWcett, esq, and other prominent gentlemen.
The train had gotten about one hundred yards
from the station when Hon. Barnes Compton, see
ing the men aud their prisoner, announced to Gov
ernor Groome, in emphatic language, They had
the brute now""


The Governor, promptly percelying that there
would be an immediate case Of lynching II the
man was left at Odenton, rushed forward and or
dered the brakeman to stop the train. The orake'
man said he did not ike to do it without the con-
sent OF Captain Brown, the conductor. The Gov
ernor told him to 90 forward and see the conduc-
tor, the Governor following. when both came up
to Captain Brown and made the request to stop
the train he demurred, but

insisted that there would be a mob If the man was
not taken upon the train, and he (tho Governor)
would stand between the conducto: and the com
pany. and as Executive Of the State Of Maryland
ordered the train back to Odenton station. Gap
tain Brown replied that if Governor GrOome took
that stand he would obey. The train backed up,
but the excited men at the station attacked the
guards of the negro, ana attempted to take him
from them, notwithstanding the orders of the
Governor. The conductor and train hands, how
ever, managed to


DRAG THE NEGRO UPON THE TRAIN,
and placed him in charge of Messrs. Thomas NJ.
Cole and ]. Columbus Gaylor. A short distance
from the crowd at Odenton was another much
larger body of men, and the negro's fate would
have been sealed had the train not gotten of as
soon as it did. The parties who attempted to
lynch the negro are said to have been Messrs

evening, President Lichtensteia in the chair
The Water Com mittce on the communi
cation of Myles Burke, reported that i,
their opinion Mr.. Burke had received al


The damages to which he was entitled.
Mr.. Farrell objected to the report, as h,
thought the petitioner was entitled to tn,
expenses incurred by him in repairing hi
cellar. Col. Febiger agreed with Mr.. Far
rell.


On motion of Mr.. Farrell, Mr.. Burke wal
invited to state his case to Council.


MR.: Paynter stated that he had examined

damage.
Mr.. Burke then came forward and said
that last August, when the Water Com.
mittee was engaged in laying water pipe
the workman cut a terra-cotta pine
leading from his cellar, and during that
night heavy rain fell, and the water filling
he ditch backed up into his cellar, damae.
the foundation of his house and causing It
to settle, besides the groceries in his store
being damaged by dampness arising from
the water.


Mr.. VIM. M. Candy made statement, of
me condition OF the property as he found
1t when Mr.. Burke made complaint. He
said that the ground on which the house
was built was always damp and long before
last summer Mr.. B. had drains laid in his
cellar to carry off water, and he thought if
any damage was done his property it was
not through any act on the part of the city
or its employees.


Hr. Hayes supported Mr.. Candy.


After a long debate in which Messrs,
puynter, Hayes, Farrell Nc Glinchey, McIn-
tire, Lynch, Bickta, Taylor, and Febiger
took part, Mr.. Farrell moved to amend the
report by allowing Mr.. Burke S65.5O, It

The inquiry into the new basin management
WAS concluded in somewhat farcical way last
night. Even after Messrs. Adams. McMenamin
and Lynch, a majority of the Committee, and
the only ones present, had severally declared the
charges unsustained, two and half hours were
consumed in further attempt to disprove them,
greatly to the tension of the nerves and patience
of Mr.. Lynch, at least. There was also strong
outside pressure leveloped-an undercurrent of
modelling in the investigation which showed only
too plainly the fear that chance for Democra.
tic stick of the pin might be lost. We could not
say unequivocally Of course, that the inquiry
was protracted, last night, to afford the Demo-
Gratis an opportunity to play another card in the
little game which they had staked upon this bus
iness but enc familiar with the whole affair
could scarcely resist the conclusion that they
were conducting the proceedings to their own
satisfaction. What they accomplished will be
developed later in the campaign now opening.


The report of the Committee, embodying it's
conclusions, will be presented to Council in
short time, and there the subject will probably
be re-opened


The resolutions OF buncombe passed by THE
basin employees will not be likely to affect the
COMMERCIAL to any extent, not that we are in
sensible topublic opinion when properly directed,
but because this movement was put up job.
We happen to be familiar with the whole pro-
ceedings, and puerile is the effort that 1t ex-
cites our sympathy more than it disturbs our
patience We are only surprised that the basin
employees did not zee the "" trap"" and avoid it.
Had they read the brief local items referedto they
would scarcely have given their sanction to the
very strained, even FALSE construction put upon
them in the preamble to the resolutions No
such statements as are attributed to the COM
MERoTAL were made by it, and hence we do not
feel any need of defence.


The principal feature in the contest among the
been the effort which certain members of the
party have made to choke off several of those
whose names were mentioned in connection with
the office. This movement was begun several
days ago, and some pretty sharp language, it is
understood, has already grown out of it, Thus
far but one man has given way-James W. Ware
who, We are informed has withdrawn entirely
from the canvass. The avowed object in view
was the comforting Of an unanimous nomination
upon VIM. G. Whiteley, Esq, who, it has been
intimated, would consent to serve only on such
conditions. 1t was authoritatiyely announced,
yesterday, however, that Mr.. Whiteey would &C
cept the nomination if rendered him, and we
take it that the struggle will now be turned to
mastering of forces about Mr.. Whiteley as
against the other candidates, some of whom re-
fuse to be put down and are vigorously working
for the nomination."

offer extenuation for Lynch law. But it is
a rash conclusion for any body Of men to
arrive at, and destroys the power and
force Of the whole jlry system. Cases Of
it are more exceptional now than in years
gone by, when the rough ideas Of law in
the West made every man ajudge to sit in
Judgment upon the body OF any one who


had offended the law. Such summary &C.
ton was almost necessary TO break up the


lawlessness that made that country the


home ofbanditti. But not only does thi:


bar''ari custom still prevail in that coun-
try TO some extent, but extends into the
- t where we are supposed to have more
cultivated ideas Of civilization than in the
rough Nesrern country. There are many
who have been consigned to an untimelv
end by these sei!c-conStituted committees
Of the law, that were innocent of the
crimes imputed to them, and those who
were the executioners and imp,i ,ated in
the matter became worse criminals than he
who is often launched into eternity.


Even ii it were in everyway justified it
has its dangers in the way We have just
mentioned, and instances Of this have oc-
Cured twice within this month. One was
in Ohio where man was hung by a mob
for outraging and numbering young girl
as it was alleged, and it was afterwards
proven tha. it was not he but his wife that
corAmitted the deed through Jealousy. The
other wa, in New Hampshire where man
named Drew was arrested, charged with
outraging and numbering Miss Lang
mead. 1t was with the utmost difficulty
that an angry mob was restrained from
lynching him aud j. now turns out that he
is innocent and will be discharged from
custody. Instances Of this kind have been
Numerous, and show the dangers OF Lynch
law"

Its greatest force was exerted at 4:5O pm. on, Friday, when for a short while it blew at the rate of sixty miles an hour. The storm proper lasted from APO a. m. on the 18th until F m. on the 1Sth~-eiRhty hours. The total rainfall during the storm was 10.53 inches, an extraordinary fall for the time.

 No two men will agree upon an estimate of the damage done by the storm, but the actual losses are very small in amount. perhaps not in excess of $25O, 900.

 AT INDIANoLA.

 The advices received at Galveston are yet far from complete, the fullest having been brought by the steamer Harlan, that steamed into Galveston with her flags at half-mast. Before leaving all her spare stores were given to the sufferers.

 The storm began on the afternoon of the 18th, the wind blowing strong from the east, increasing steadily until 9 D. m. of the 18th hauling then to northwest, from which quarter it came perfect hur- ricane until 9 a. m. of the 18th. Three of the four pilots are drowned, no lighters or warehouses are left, and it will be i'm possible for some time to transport freight by rail. There were but one weeks pro- visions in the place. The damage to the houses, all but five of which are swept away. is indescribabIe. Nr. Piaget lost one flock of 2, 5000 sheep.

 Sixty bodies were recovered and buried that could not be recognized, the features being destroyed by coming in contact with floating lumber, etc. One body was found with belt about the waist contain ing g, 900. The money was deposited in the bank and the body decent1y inferred.

 William Taylor, on tr1aI for murder, was let out of jail to prevent his being drown ed, and made his escape. The estimate of the loss made by Mir. John F. BarlowGs S2, ,OOO, 900.

 AT LYNCHBURG.

 There is not house left standing on the bayou bank between Morgan's Point and Lynchburg. At Lynchburg not a house remains of the village, and Captarn Christian, of the Lizzie, was met by about thirty hOuseless, homeless inhabitants literally destitute of everyth1ng-food. clothing, or shelter. He gave them . barrel of flour, a sack of meal and other provisions. Sixteen lives were lost in all The water rose fourteen feet above mean tide level, and on the Fist was still ten feet above the village. Captain Bell, on the Matamoras, picked up twenty-One people on Friday-sOme swimming. some afioat on their houses. Three of them were lassoed and dragged on board.

 MISCELLANEOUS.

 A every point from the mouth of the Brazos the people are in great destitutiOn, some living on the potatoes which must soon rot from the effects of salt water.

 Velasco IS swept away, though no lives were lost. The entire population gather cd ID the upper apartments of the largest building Tn the town. and when 1t was seen that the sea and storm were about to sweep 1t away, the men, wko were up to their Decks Tn water. with the aid of . small boat got of the women into the schooner Verbena, and got aboard them selves. Miss Ida Cook, the Judges daughter, the heroine of the terrible scene. was the last to abandon the house; and being assisted on board the schooner by a young sailor of the craft, the vessel being lowed up to the yard fence and the water shoulder deep, Judge Cook Iashed tbe vessel hrst to one tree, then another, as they were pulled up by the roots, and thus rode out the storm. The house from which they escaped was swept oH shortly after they left it. Eight miles on the land side 0f yeiasco the sea was five feet deep during the storm.

 The large steamship Australia vas stranded st East Bernard and rescued all the inhabitants but thirteen. Every bouse Tn the settlement was washed away. The crew of the steamship found the inhab- itants. including the local CustOm-House Inspector and family, sitting on the beach in a depIorabie condition, not having tasted food for two days.

Even while the jury was hearing the testi-

Thompson was brought to the jail for attempt
ing an outrage upon a lady named Henriette
Stinchcomb, and fears were entertained that
be would be dealt with in the same manner
that Sims was. Oflate years there seems to
to be prevailing mania among Maryland
negroes for committing outrages upon white
ladies, and it is time that they were taught
the enormity of said crime, though the lynch
law should not b. .resorted to in any case.


The large barn Of Mr.. Samuel Long, about
half mile below townsville, Washington

dred bushels of wheat, about three hundred
barrels Of corn, twenty odd tons of hay, two
wagons, gears of every description. one calf

involving loss Of nearly or quite FIVE thou
sand dollars, upon which there was no insur-

State Fish Commissioners, P. W. Downs, of
Denton, arrived in Elkton on Wednesday
morning week with forty thousand young
shad for Elk river. The little fry were six
days old, about half-inch long, and might
have been swallowed in glass of water
without knowing it. Mr.. Dewnes turned
his charge loose in Big Elk at the head Of
tide water, aud if they are not destroyed be-
fore their time, there will be large increase
in the shad in few years.

lights ago, that Mrs. Whitman, the
woman he murdered, appeared to him.
he was 30 frightened by his dream
that he got out of his bed in agony and
prayed for mercy. He expresses him
self willing TO die, but persists in de-
claring that he did not intend to kill
the woman, but only to beat her. He
has said this ever since he was first ar.
rested, and stated the same thing un-
der oath, after his own convictioo
when ON the stand as witness against
George Hines.

the whites on the Goth of August The order
stated that Rivers, a coIored militia General OF
South Carolina, would be present and direct the
movement. The order said Kill every white
man and take every gun you can get. Have
all your companies ready. Kill with axes,
hoes and pitchforks, and get gunpowder and
shot as you kill"" Another letter giving
substantially the same instructions was found
in Jefferson county. The whites, apprehend-
ing danger, telegraphed to Macon for ammuni-
ton, which was promptly furnished, and every
preparation made for the apprehended attack.
large number of negroes charged with being
implicated in the movement were arrested and
lodged in Jail. For time the greatest excite
ment prevailed and it was feared the whites
would take the imprisoned blacks from Jail and
lynch them. At last accounts affairs were
quieting down, and no serious trouble was ap-
pretended. 1t is charged by the whites that
the whole trouble was caused by few worth
less, turbulent, designing negroes, who live
upon the credulity of the colored people.


A dispatch from Augusta Ga, dated Aug. 20,
says ""All is quiet, but arrests still continue
1t is believed there will be no further trouble.
The negroes have dispersed and returned to
their homes. A dispatch from Sanderville
Washington county, reports the arrest of Gambia
Harris, one of the leaders in the plot. He has
made confession, duplicating Prince Rivers, q
Major General of the South Carolina militia.
Rivers emphatically denies the charge. The
State press seems dumbfou nded at the dis
trubance, and differs widely in opinion as to
whether an insurrection was intended but
agree that the whole affair is a mystery

of 1870. The city of New Orleans has popu
lation of 800, $685. of whom 145, 721 are white,
! 157, G47 colored.


The investigation into the cause of death of
the three patients by poisoning in the st. Louis
Insane Asylum, has resulted in generating the
attendant physician from all blame in the
matter.

Mr.. Vim. nj. Canby's substitute reso-
luton in regard to the Investigating |
Committees report was the first busi-
ness considered.
| Mr.. Pickles offered the following as
q further amendment


Resolged By This Council that while
we disapprove of the action OF Chief
Engineer Hyde in instructing Engineer
Maxwell to sign the name OF A. d;
Caulk, IN the latter's absence, and
| without his knowledge or consent; and
while we also disapprove of MIR. Hyde's
action IN asking the employees OF the
Water Department to contribute por,
ton of their wages to the Union Aid
Society, vet nothing of improper IN
tent appears in the action Of Mr.. HYDE
10 this matter and further, that oil
such assessments are prohibited in the
future.
II MIR. McIntire opposed the amend
ment as he considered it equivalent to
sustaining the charge made by Mr..
Febiger that Mr.. Maxwell was guilty
, of forgery in signing A. j. Caulk's


name to the contribution list.


Mr.. Baker contended that MIR. Max
wells action was forgery, and that
!. Mr.. HYDE was wrong in insWucting him
| to do so.

meanless, it may be well to remind the
young students of the University of Viri
ginia that the blood Of the New England
forefathers was pure and even princely
when compared with that of the common
convicts granted tickets of leave from the
low prisons of Taunton and Bndgewater
to colonize Southern plantations. and the
name of Preston figures largely in the list,
which fact is, perhaps, only coincidence.
A few of the better class were sent South
from the Tower of London, but they were
all attainted of high treason. They were
traitors then, and if the Prestons could
have their way they would be traitors still.
The students of the University of Virginia
can study with profit the fact that one
of the very earliest acts of Charles l., an
act which raised most intense storm of
condemnation throughout his Kingdom,
was the imposition of forced loan
without grant from Parliament
and that John Winthrop and Isaac johnson
and Thomas Dudley were his principal op-
ponents in Lincolnshire and Suffolk, and
that then and there, in 1880, raised on En-
glish soil the standard of liberty and JUS
tice. Thomas Dudley became an early
Governor of Massachusetts. The prisons
of Lincolnshire were filled with the more
important of these objectors to the tyranny
of Charles I. They came under the cogni-
zance Of the ""Star Chamber"" and many
of them were sent to New England, bring
ing with them a reverence for precedent
liberty; justice and law, and from the loins
Of such men sprung the race that led in the
Revolution. But all this is not to the point
now, and is only referred to as single IL
lustration of the confusion into which the
Prestons, a name not heard of in revolu-
tionary annals, except in the small office Of
a Colonel of Virginia troops, held by his
paternal grandfather, can be easily thrown.
In fact, the family was not known at all in
this country until 1885, when VIM. G. Pres
ton, q brother ofthis fiery orator, was elected
to the Senate of the United States as
reward for supporting John c. Calhoun as
nullifer, and more than two hundred
years after John Winthrop was Governor
of Massachusetts,. Poor fool 1t might be
well for the students of the University to
go on and learn the fact that South Carolina
never had much to do with the Government
in any way, except to give it trouble on
account Of its treason. 1t never had an
officer in the Cabinet until the fourth Ad-
ministratioH, when Paul Hamilton became
Secretary of the Navy In the fifth, John
c. Calhoun, alias South Carolina, was Sec
retary of War. In the sixth, John G.
Calhoun, alias South Carolina, was Vice
President. In the seventh, John C. Cal
boun, alias South Carolina, was Vice
President of Jackson's first term. In the
eighth, Joel r. Poinsett was Secretary of
War. In the ninth, Hugh 8. L,gare was
Secretary of State, and that is all. This
great State was passed over by Washington,
Adams, Jefferson and Madison, and has
not been heard of in the Cabinet since the
ninth, (Harrison's) or in 1S41. There
were thirteen Congresses before Langdon
Cheyes, of South Carolina, was made q
Speaker, and James L. Orr, of South Caro-
lima, was Speaker of the Thirty-fif Con-
gress, and Armisted Burt succeeded Win
throp as Speaker of the Thirtieth Congress,
and that is all she was ever honored in that
way. She gave to the country a Chief
Justice, John Rutledge, for nearly year,
and Preston s. Brooks struck down an
unarmed man without warning. This is
all South Carolina has done since the Rev
olution to make her notable. This is the
extent of the trust reposed in her by her
sister States; and yet to hear the gasconade
from that State at Lexington, stranger
would be led to believe that the balance of
the Union was a mere dependency upon it.


For information as, to the way in which
the address was received, we refer to the

concerning it, to the Lynchburg Repubh-

Mr. Edmunds of Vermont said that he de-
sired to state before Offering resolution which
he proposed that in regard to the resolution Of
tered by HIM last Friday touching the Presl-
dent OF the Senate, there had been some dis
cusson and upon further conference with that
senator he thought that there should be no
question or doubt as to who is the president of
the Senate between the date and day of the
meeting of Congress till after the holiday re.
cess He therefore offered the following:


Resolved, that MI. Ferry, Senator from the
state of Michigan, be the president of the Sem
ate ' until Jan. 7th, 1876, and until fresh ap-
pointment be made.


The Chair (Anthony of r. l. announced
that the question was upon the passage of the
resolution.


Mr.. Salisbury said it involved the question
already before the committee on elections. The
resolution assumed that the Senate had not a
president, and he called attention to that fact


MIR. Edmunds said he had drawn resolution
so as not to assume that fact.


Mr.. Bayard offered a substitute declaring
Mr.. Thurman of Ohio president of the Senate
until Jan. 7th, 1876 or until fresh appoint
ment shall be made and upon this demanded

Mr.. Morton said that he had been advised
that there would be further debate upon it.
He would be glad to have it disposed of today,
but 3s number OF senators were absent he
would not press it to a vote as he was not sat-
isfed that quorum would be present later in
the day. He therefore made no objection to
the resolution going over.


Mr.. Boutwell, introduced bill to increase
the efficiency of the navy, promote the mara.
time interests of the United States. Ordered

Mr.. Anthony, from the committee on print.
ing, reported back the resolution to print extra
copies of the Presidents message, and moved
that its further consideration be indefinitely
postponed. So ordered.


In making the report he said it had been
customary to print extra copies heretofore, but
the message had already been sent by telegraph
and published all over the country, and he saw
no use to print extra copies now.

unable to arrest the progress until the factory

contents, were consumed. At one time it was
feared the burning shingles would communi-

less in their threats against Republican
lives in the South, and a journal now and
then essays an appeal to what it chooses
to call 'thigher' or lynch law as remedy
for real or imaginary grievances, it is
timely to cite An instance-by NO means
exceptional the operation of that law.


It will be remembered that the dis
patches Of September 26 gave full details
Of the arrest and lynching of a Mr.. Schell
at Bellefontaine, Ohio, charged with the
heinous crimes of outraging the person of
a young woman, and afterward numbering
her. So aendish did Mrs. Schell represent
the conduct of her husband that the indig-
nant populace, breaking through all law
full restraint, gratified their momentary
impulses, and sent the soul of ScheN to
eternity while the protest of innocence
was on his dying lips. Here is the
sequel:


The most startling bit of evidence against
Malinda Schell came out in the morning.
1t had been overlooked in the excitemeet
of the lynch. In the hand of the dead
girl, tightly clenched, have been found
some threads of hair. In her death strug-
gle with the esenemy she tore these from the
roots and held them like wise. The hair
was fine, dark and straight. 1t was sup.
posed at first to be from Schells head, but
on examination under the microscope it
appeared darker and coarser, for his own
hair was uncommonly fine, and what set
tied the matter as to Schell the hair ranged
from ten 60 fourteen inches in length, and
no hair in his head measured half that
We're they Alice'si No; her hair was Q
dark auburn and finer in text dre. Whose
then? They belonged TO Malinda. In
length, color and texture they were an ex-
act counterpart of this woman's looks. In
order to shield herself, while her husband
was in jail, and public opinion was ready
to silence him, she had evidently manufac
tured the greater part, If not all, of that
horribly strange story.


Now, the press of the country is unani-
nous in condemnation of the mob, and the
occurrence is looked upon as disgrace
to Ohio. The slow and sure processes of
the law afford ample security to human
life. and the surest retribution of crime,
while acts of violence but rebound against
the actors. c"

Of the wealth and respectabhty Of Maryland.
Four run the first being a dash q
mile and quarter; the second the Breckenridge
Stakes two miles, the third mile heats and the fourth
a steeplechase post stakes, all of which decided
good time and gave general satisfaction, except the
Brecknrdge Stakes, which, although nrst the list
had to be run second on account Of a misunder-
standing about the weights to be carried.

been previously sold declared the mile and

occupied in running this the money previously placed
in the box returned to the depostors This was
fair proceeding, and gave general satisfaction OF those
who had invested on Oehiltree many subsequently,

with the five pounds extra, and laid their money on
other horses in consequence This was wise, as the

Council in reference to building the new
reservoir. and construction OF = smaller
basin according to the plan proposed by
Mr.. Morris. the consulting engineer.
came up for consideration.


Mr.. Vim. NJ Candy was OF the opinion
that the smaller reservoir would be am
pie and would cost about 100000 less
than the large one; this amount could be
applied to the laying of the mains.
Mr.. Febiger opposed the report He
said it had been rumored that tina small
er basin was to be built 30 that the re-
manning portion OF the lot could he con
aware Avenue. He said that this could
not bs. for the reservoir lot was con-
demned under the same law relating to
the condemnation OF streets, which pro-
vides that when land ia not used for the
purposes for which it was condemned, it
shall revert TO the former ownsrs. He
reviewed the sigIers Of the last named
petition. aud said the majority Of them
were supplied with water from the
upper basin. He moved to amend the
report By instructing the committee to
finish the lower or eastern side Of the
basin, excavating from the upper basin,
enough to construct tho banks Of the
lower basin; and that the overflow, when
finished, shall be twenty feet above the
overflow at Tenth and Market streets.
Mr.. Farrell thought the plan proposed
bv Mr.. Morris should have been adopted
IN the first place.sand the work proceed
ed with to date. Men are now suffering
from want who should have been kept at
work. he thought at any rate the pipe
laying should be proceed with. as it
would benefit the people by putting S4Oo
OF $500 per week in circulation. The
city should do all III its power to anchor
ate the condition OF the poor laboring
men.
Mr.. Hayes favored Mr.. Morris plan,
and opposed Mr.. Febigers amendment.
| Mr.. Lichtenstein counseled modera-
l fS. II. \
OF the committee, with instructions to,
| them to confer with the former Water
Commit He did not press his mo.
| tion.


Mi BaAsI thought it Goald bs more
economical to build the basin on the
| lower portion Of the lot according to Mr.
2raefs plan, than to build on the uppe,
portion according to the plan Of Mr. Nor.
9is. he favored o. large basin, and
thought one holding ten days supply
was scarcely sufficient. The water sup.
ply now is dangerously short and should
be Increased.


Mr.. WIN, ""a. CANDY thought the r,lG,
tive cost OF building the BASIN on the
upper or lower eal. VI the lot should be
.scertained and considered.

vas felt at IL last night. There was much
alarm. The oscillations were south to north.
The shocks were felt in several parts of the
State.


RICHMOND, Dec 23.-The shocks felt here
last night were veritable earthquake shocks,
and no mistake. No comparison can be
made with any similar antecedent event, mas
much as it was the first experienced here
Abouts. The statements OF persons residin g
in different sections of the city coincide in
abe main as to the vibrations, duration and
fDrce OF the shocks.


A short time after the cessation of the
shocks, the streets were alive with frightened
and excited people. Many made their way to
the newspaper and telegraph offices to learn
the extent of the phenomena, while others of
more nervous temperament, remained in the
streets for hours, not daring to re-enter their
houses for fear of repitition of the shocks.
but the remainder of the night passed OF
without further disturbance.


To-day this remarkable epoch in Rich
mOnd's history was the general topic of con-
Versation, it being discussed in all its phases,
each one having their own experience to re-
late. kilograms from various points in Vir-
ginia report shocks similar to those felt here.
In some places greater number of shocks
ARE reported than in others. None of the re-
ports agree as to the direction of the oscilla-
aon.


As far as heard from, shocks were not felt
south of Petersburg, west of Lynchburg,
north of Alexandrls, nor east of City Point,
on James River. Along the Chesapeake and
Ohio Railroad shocks were telt as far as
Staunton, $50 miles northwest of Richmond,
and on the Danville Railroad to the Southern
border of the State. The probability is that
ahe shocks in Richmond were as severe as at
any other point, and no damage worth men
iaaing is reported from any other direction."

 who at the time of his death, in March last was the oldest clergyman in the state. The Litchfeld North association joined with the Norfolk society in the services, and the church was crowded. The services were opened with prayer by Rev. MT. Halleck of West Winsted, and 8 sermon by Professor Porter, which occupied an hour or more.

 Corner stone.-The Catholic people of Lakeville and vicinity will lay the corner stone of their new church in Lakeville on Thursday afternoon of this week, the Rev. Father Hughes, Vicar General of Hartford, will deliver the sermon. The various tenn perance and civil societies of this region will participate Tn the exercises and grand time is expected. The Rev. Father Lynch is to be congratulated on his most excellent success among his people there. The church is to be 75x45, and will be comple- ted and ready for divine service by the end of 1875.

 Town Halls.-Mr I. N. Bartram of Sharon is building new town halls for Bar rington and New Milford. When is he going to build one for Salisbury? The LakeYille folks will give the land and pay for half the construction of the building if MT. B. will put It down there. We think he had better accept of that offer, as he probably will not live long enough to get chance to build one in this village, nor any body else, as for that matter We hope the Lakeville people will continue to stir about in this hall business, and they'll meet with the reward that perseverance invariably commands.

 Heavy Freighting.--Th through freight trains on the Housatonic road go so heavily laden TOW days, that two locomotives are re- quired to haul them, denoting an amount of business never before known in the his- tory of the road, as one locomotive alone is capable of hauling very long train oyer Its easy grades, and has always before been equal to any emergency. The frelghting business over the Conn. Western road is also very heavy now the present rolling stock of the road being scarcely adequate to the work. Last Saturday, the regular freight took heavily laden train from the western end of the line, leaving Granville with forty cars. The coal traffic from the new Rhinebeck 6 Connecticut road, adds largely to the business.

 Falls Village.-The Old Folks Concert in Citizens Hall last week Wednesday evening was very fine affair, and full house enjoyed the tunes of ye olden time. They repeat the same in West Cornwall on Friday evening, May 28th......The Red Star B. B. c. went to West Cornwall on Wednesday of this week and played a match game with the Hickory B. B. 0. of that place. If we can judge anything from the practice games of the Red Stars, we bespeak for them successful season, as they have, to all appearances, a very strong nine for an amateur club......G. w. Hall seems to be having the bulk of the trade in this place. Moral-Advertise in THE NEws. .....,T The Wilmington singers gave con- cert in the Methodist church Tuesday even- ing George Capron has some fine fish ing tackle for sale. SHYLooK.

 Ashley F'al1s.-Mr. John Carroll, the great paper manufacturer of Mill River, is negotiating for land in Ashley Falls, on which to build him residence. MT. Car roll does nothing by halves. and it is pre- stunned he will put up an elegsnt structure | there if he succeeds in getting the site, az everybody hopes he will. The lot under negotiation is the corner lot facing on School street, and the new street running l Fro hot +of ho Sc nf the pleasantest in the village. The new railroad street has new and wide side. walk recently built, with shade trees and structure such as MT. Carroll will put there If he gets the land, will add much to the appearance of that portion of the viii lage......Large quantities of newspaper from Mill River are being shipped from the station at Ashley Falls, there being from 6OOo to 1000 pounds shipped daily.

 Po'keepsie, Hartford & Boston RR. Go. A meeting of the purchasers of the Po' keepsie & Eastern railroad was held in this city Monday for the purpose of organizing which was effected by the election of off ccrs as follows:

 President, Geo. P. Pelton Vice Presi | Treasurer, Alanson Swain.

 At the same time Jacob N. Perkins was appointed Superintendent and Alonzo w. Cable, General Freight and Passenge, Ageut.

 No action has yet been taken with regard to the future of the road, says the Edgle but the first work to be done will be the completion of the Delaf1eld street bridge and the fencing of the road. All the roll ing stock and the road bed is also to be in spected and put in complete order, and some new freight cars will probably be purchased soon. Efforts will also be made to arrange with the Connecticut Western for better through connection to Hartford and the East.-Pough&eepsie 1'elegraph.

 The Weather-The heated term seems to have bounced upon us all at once Less than week ago, as we write, Clues day forenoon,) fires were not only con- fortahle but absolutely necessary, and th'

CONCORD, N H.. October 5.-A man
named Drew has been ARE sted at Penn
broke for the outrage and murder OF the
young girl A mob is besieging the station
house where Drew is confined. The head
of the murdered girl was discovered a
hundred yards from where the body was
found.


The search for the head of the Lang mad .
girl at Pembroke was renewed this morn
ing, and resulted in its being found about
100 rods from where the body was discov-
cred. 1t was envelooed in a shawl which
the girl had worn. One ear was gone, the
face blackeued and bruised, and one side of
the skull broken in. In the edge CT the
woods was found a stake broken in two
pieces, with which she had evidently been
struck and afterward dragged into the woods
where the head wei severed from the body.
The officers at SrucC0k, mile and hall
from the scene of the tragedy, to-day ar
rested man named BIZ Drew, who lives
about half mile from where the murde,-
was committed, and whose movements were
very suspicious. The most intense excite
ment prevailed. When his arrest became
known great crowd gathered about the
station where he YVES confined, and but for
the determination of the officers he would,
doubtless, have been lynched.

CONTINUATION OF wai 1. cRosBY's TRIAL.


In the U. 5. Court yesterday, the trial of W..
L. Crosby was continued, the examination Of
witnesses for the Prosecution first engaging the
attention Of the Court


Capt William Williams, Levi b. Lynch and
Wm. IL. Lingo, repeated their testimony as in
the trial of VIM. H. Eegood. and rrusten r.
Morris and Geo. W. Wilea, merchants of George
town, also testified that Crosby and Ellegood un-
dertook to sell brown sugar to them about the
time the smuggling was alleged to have taken
place. The testimony of the Custom House In
spector ut New York was given. and the Masonic y
manifest was put in evidence, with which the
Prosecution closed.


The Defence called the same witnesses to relate
the same statements III the former trial, but
an effort was made to break down the testimony
of Lew Il. Lynch, who had sworn to seeing goods
landed from Capt. Willamrs, boat on the beach
at Ellegoods house the night of the Smuggling.
d. c. Sturgs testified that Lynch had said to
him that he (Lynch) knew nothing of the land
ing OF the boat and nothing of tho kind,
while William Ellegood swore that Lynch had
not only told him that he did not recognize the
men in the boat but also that they (the Prosecu-
tom were trying to scare him into proving the
identity of the men Or they, or Marshall Dunn.
would have him imprisoned two years.


The same objection to the insuflicencv of the
Indictment was raised by the Defence, and the
Prosecution put i'll their rehuttal evidence when
the court adjourned until 10 O'clock Oh Saturday"

was not intoxicated May 25th, as some
of the witnesses for the prosecution
testified.


The sixth charge, ""the mismanage-
ment of men to the detriment Of the
city,"" was examined.


B. Crozier, col, testified that he was
working at 18th and Lombard streets,
bailing water from the ditch the day
Mr.. Hawkins came there; had my
tools and worked there all day; did
not tell Mr.. Hawkins had nothing to
do that day; Dir. Hyde told me to bail
out the ditch.


Pierce Carter. col, corroborated this
testimony.


James Mccullough testified that the
day Mr.. Hawkins said that he saw the
eight men on the long bank they were
at work.


Matthew Maloney testified to the
same effect as the last witness, as did also
Jacob Baker.


Mr.. Bradford-If the committee arc
Of the opinion that the charges are
unsustained we would like q report
exonerating Mr.. Hyde and the Water
Department. fs


Mr.. Lynch moved to adjourn subjec,
to the call of the Chairman.


Mr.. Bradford-The defense ought To
have some idea of the report the com
mittee will make, as they cut short.


Mr.. Adams said it would be better
to have the committee meet again and
make their report.


Mr.. Bradford asked if he could re-
open defense II a favorable report II
not presented.


Assurance was given him that the
majority of the committee would report
favorably.


Mr.. Bradford asked whether the form
of the report read did not, In Its sub
stance, meet the approval of the com
mittee.


Mr.. Adams said the substance of the
report met his approval.
On motion of Mr.. Lynch the com
miitee adjourned subject to the call Of
the chairman."

When the investigating committee
-, ~ last evening, only Messrs. Adams,
'v inch and McMenamin were present,
NJ pickels being upwell and Mr.. Un-
aorwood too much engaged to be pres
aut An organization was effected by
nat;ng MIR. Adams temporary chair
man and James p. Hayes clerk, pro
tsm.
tbe defence on the second charge was
about to be commenced, when Mr..
vncb arose and asked Mr.. Bradford
bow much time the examination of
witnesses for the defence would occu-
nv For himself he WAS sick of the
whole affair. He was convinced that
tbe charges were utterly unfounded,
and that Mr.. Hyde had proved himself
""A faithful and efficient official. If any
Irregularities had occurred during his
administration Of Water Department
affairs they were errors of the head
and not of the heart. He did not want
to waste any more time In this nom
senscal investigation, for the public
were SICK of 1t. II is the greatest farce
ever enacted. tApplause.


In reply Mr.. Bradford stated that
the defence had host of witnesses,
and were able to refute every charge
presented, II the committee was sat
Listed that the charges had not been
sustained, and were ready to adopt
report vindicating the Chief Engineer
and the management of the Water
Department, the defence would rest
their case. But they objected to stop
ping before the committee was con-
u vinced thatthe charges were disproved.


Mr. Adams said that from the evi.
dence already in he was satisfied that
I the charges were not sustained,
Mr.. McMenamin thought that none
Of the charges had been sustained, but
he wanted some refuting evidence from
the defence in regard to the alleged
drunkenness of foremen and gang
Bosses


Mr.. Adams thought somo little irreg-
uarities or indiscretions might have
occurred, but IL was difficult TO COM
mence great work like the new basin
without such errors. he thought the
work thus far had been remarkably
well, and reflected credit on the Chief
Engineer and Water Committee.
Mr.. Lynch said that no one could
fail to see that this whole affair was q
deep, preconserted plan to cut off Mr..
Hydes's head, and oust him from his
official position. He was ready now
to sign report eXonerating Mr.. Hyde
and the management of the Water
Department. He therefore moved that
the committee adjourn sine die.


Mr.. Bradford thought it was hardly
fair 10 terminate the examination SO
abruptly without suggesting to the
defence (who were ready with large
number of witnesses to refute every
Charge some form of q report as would
exonerate Mr.. Hyde. Such report
would prove satisfactory to the de-
fence.


Mr. Lynch thought it was fruitless
togo On with the examination of wit
nesses. The prosec ution witnesses
had Jailed to prove any charges, and
their testimony was sufficient evidence
Tor the defence.


Mr.. Bradford said he anticipated an
abrupt termination of the examination,
and so had prepared a report which
MT. Hyde would be satisfied with.


Mr' Adams said thecommittee could
not aolourn sine die, and that the exam,

Mr. Lynch signitied his willingness

NEW ORLEANS, October G, 1875.
To the Honorable Board Of Directors Of the Public


GENTLEMEN-Since tho opening of the
schools this session have visited sixty of
the seventy four in the division, and deem
it my duty to present to you briefly state
ment of their condition, in order that You
may adopt such measures for their advance
ment, and such remedies for their defects
as your interest in their true welfare may
dictate. 1t is to be regretted that in quite
q number Of the schools the standard OF ex-
cellence and efficiency has been greatly
lowered since the, opening of this session.
The cause of this 1t belongs to the board to
discover and remove. IT the directors will
visit the schools I am confident that they
will feel it imperative upon them to
recommend the transfer of certain teach
ers who have been appointed to posi-
tions for which they are not properly
qualified, and the dismissal of others who
are utterly incompetent. Feeling sure that
no director would be willing to retain any
teacher who is unable to discharge the dn-
ties of her position, ! desire to call your at
tention to the assertion that in my visits to
certain schools have found some who are
devoid of the scholarship necessary to in
struct pupils, even of the lowest depart
ments. There are eome who hold no GER
tiicate of qualification, and whose appoint
ment ID consequently null in law. Others
hold certificates not emitting them to teach
in the departments to which they have been
elected, while others are wholly incapable
either to govern or instruct the classes
placed under their control.


These facts being 80, I have no doubt that
the board will consider it necessary to ap-
ply tn proper remedy to such mistakes as
have been made through the absence of
full knowledge Of the attainments and quail
fcations of the different teachers and ap-
plicants. A visitation and critical observ-
alton of the schools will convince any impair
tial person that. the late unusually great
change in the corps Of teachers has caused q
decline in the interest and prosperity of all
the schools, and particularly of those where
the changes have been the greatest. 1t
would perhaps, be wise to follow the exam
pie set by the boards of other cities,
where teachers are displaced only upon
specific charges, and where an annual in
crease Is added to their salaries for a certain
number of years, to compensate for the in
creased efficiency and ability, which, it is
believed, come to q teacher with the ex-
perience of each succeeding year. The
very large number OF children attending
our schools makes our responsibility all the
greater, and causes us to regret all the
more any administrative acts which tend
to impair their efficiency. There have been
admitted since the opening, on the thir-
teenth of September, about 1900 pupils,
q number considerably in excess of that
admitted at this time last year.


mittee on teachers, or special committee,
be directed to inquire into the ineticiency
Of teachers, either as to scholarship or dis
ciplinary powers, to summon them to ex-
animation whenever they may consider
proper, and recommend to the board such
transfers and dismissals as may be con.
ducive to the interests of the public schools
COnfided to your care.


H IL Very respectfully,
..J.sH C. w. BOOTHBY,
sa..-.! Superintendent Sixth Division.


Mr.. Pinchback objected to general
charges, such as were contained in the re-
port. If any action Of the board was neces-
sary, he would recommend it be recon-
mitted to the officer making it. He also
said he was cognizant that many teachers
recommended by Mr.. Boothby had been
dropped, and subsequently resppointed.


Mr.. Boothby said it was not proper for
hum at an open meeting to report names,
but it would be his duty to give them to
any committee that might be appointed.


After some discussion the report was re-
ceived. ,.~ r-r-fa


The president reported a proposition of
the Citisen's Savings Bank, accepted by
him and the treasurer. to retain portion
Of their obligations and make an advance

Believing that we have reached crisis

Mr.. Dibble offered the following resolu.
tions: tI- an 81 .-4..-.-.. 81
Resolved, That the communication from
the committee be received, without refer
ence to the resolutions of the macs meeting


transmitted by the committee.
Res0tred, That the communication be re-
ferred to q special committee of three.
Judge Lynch considered the communica-


tion oouohed in respectful language and de-
serving of the attention of the board.
Facts not generally known could thus be
made public.


Mr.. Pinchback spoke of the strange thing


that general charges had been brought for
ward in this manner. He said he could net


understand why Judge Kennard had de.


voted so much time to him, in contrast to


every other speaker, unless it was because


that while acting Governor he had removed


him from the supreme bench, and appointed
Judge Morgan. The board seemed to intend


to compromise the matter against his OBJ


lection. He had waited for the committee


to call on him that he might make himself


understood in unmistakable language. The
editor and proprietor of the Bulletin was on
the committee. He had maligned the


schools, the teachers and the directors, and


had refused to recognize the committee of


the board, yet he now is on this committee,


and comes before this board. Yet he would
not oppose the resolution.


The resolutions were adopted, and the
chair appointed Messrs Dibble, Pinchback
and DumonJ.


Two reports from the committee on re-
trenchment and salaries were presented.


The following was signed by Messrs. Lynch
and Dumont, as the salaries recommended
for teachers:


Principals. Grammar A, fourteen males,


$500; twenty five females, $1,000; Grammar


b, thirteen teachers, 4940; Primary A, thir-


teen teachers, $500; Primary B, four teach

teachers, $3.50; Primary A, seven teachers,


5000; Primary B, two teachers, 5000

ance 1920, $50. Other expenses, portresses,
etc., &29, $3.50. Total, $3.50, S4O-a reduction
of $72, $50 from last years estimate.


Messrs. Bourges and Masicot reported
they agreed with the other report, except
the portion relative to the salaries of the
principals of the Grammar A schools, which
there remained unchanged. They consid-
cred they should be proportionately
changed.


On Mr.. Pinchback's motion, the reports
were ordered printed and action postponed.


[Mr. Gaudet in the chair.]


A communication from DR.. Henry, sani-
tary inspector of the Seventh District, was
referred to the committee on schoolhouses.
q Other communications and applications
were referred to committees or executive
session. 't-U'. 1I

LEASES BY THE COMMON COUNCIL.


An applca ION was recently mace IN supreme
COURT, Chambers, before Judge Brady, for a man
damus against comptroller Green. TO compel MIN
90 sign lease OF that portion OF No. p Chambers
street which the common Council mad taken at q
certain annual rental for the use OF oue OF the
branches OF the Marine Court. Tne igcts were
fuily given IN the HERALD at the argument OF the
case. Judge Brady gave his decision IN the mat
ter yesterday, the following being his written
opinion


The power Of the Common Council TO deter
mine upon a lease OF premises for the use OF the
city is legislative ana Is unlimited, except as to
tne term OF years. section is fthe charter OF 1878
(LaWs ASA declares that the Common Council
shall have no power to take or make lease OF
any real estate, save at reasonable rent and for
period not excre edlng I've years, unless specially
authorized 50 to do by an act or the Legislature.
This is the only restriction. The exercise OF this
power Is guarded by the provisions OF section IA,
which declares that the voIes or three-fourths OF
all the members elected TO each Board shall be
come necessary to It's passage. Sections 50 and
liz do not anect the exercise OF this power. They
relate 70 the departments for which appropria-
tions have been made 40 departments and boards
or o11cers,n and by board is meant board in any
department OF the city government tsec. so. The
restriction imposed is against incurring any ex-
pense unless an appropriation shall nave been
previously mace covering IL. section ~ uoes not
In any way uultate against the views thus eA-
pressed. 1t relates to contracts, the OF the
execution Of when is not by law or ordinance, IN
whole In part, TO oe paid by assessments upon
the property benefited, and as to which there Is
no balance remaining unexpended and unapplied
OF Inc APPROPRIATION appicaole tIeFeto sunclent
10 pay the estimated expense Of executing them
This evidently relates 10 obligations other
than leases the expenses OF executing
which are not certified DY the officer
making the same, and therefore TO those relating
TO work 20 be done on supplies 70 be furnished.
This is The more apparent from the provision that
II snail be lhe DUTY Of the Comptroller 10 make an
Indorsement upon the contract presented to him,
n such be the TACT tnat there remains unapplIed
and unexpended balance OF the approprIaton
apple bic, and 10 hold and retain such sum TO
pay the expense incurred until the contract shall
be uly performed. When the lessor eals upon
the Comptroller 10 pay the rent accruing 1t viii \
II y
that duty aud the courts may then be called
upOn TO consider the Legality OF sucn answer. The
question Is not now whether the Conptroler Is 10
pay, bus whether he can prevent the Xsrcise OF
Legislative power expressly conferred upon the
common Councu Oy the ASSERTION IhaE
there Is no provision by wey Of appropria-
II such be the effect Of the charter 1t necessarily
follows that no lease can be made until an apprO-
which it seems would be uawise ana i'll gicaL
The lease might not be made owing to one Of
many causes which might intervene and the sum
assigned to meetit would tnen nave been un-
necessarily named and Included IL may also be
said that Dy the second section or the act or 1874
(chap 3Oe, Laws Of loIl p 802l; the Board OF Esti
mate and Apportionment are given tue power aE
any time 10 transfer any Appropriation for any
year wuIcn may Oe found by the board OF the de-
partment or whlch sucn appropriation snall have
been made to be in excess OF the amount required
or deemed to be necessary tor ne purpose or
objects thereof TO meek other purposes or objects
lor which appropriations are insufficient or such
as may re9ulre the same. IL ilay well be doubted
whether, ii vne city refused 20 pay because OF an
exhausted appr, priatOu, the courts would not
require evidence that there was no such excess
the law Just referred 10 cOntempates lG Is,
however unnecessary to pursue THIS subject
further. IL is aqpareut tnet The objections urged
by the Comptl ollor are not SUFFICIENT 10 prevent
the success ol tals mouon, and 1t must therefore
be denied.


DAMAGES FOR CHANGE OF GRADE.


In the suit OF Lynch q Darragh against the city
. motion was recently made in supreme Court
Chambers, before Judge Brady, TO compel the
Board Of Revision ard Correction, OF which Comp.
troner Green Is one 10 make an award OF dam
ages for change OF grade in 123d street. In tafs
case the acts have been fully published in the
HERALD, and need NOT, therefore, be repeated.
Judge Brady yesterday decided the case embody-
ing his reas ms In the following optnion:-


As | understood the point taken upon the ar.
gument OF the motions in these cases, 1t is that
tne change OF grade was made uader the act OF

makes no provision for compensation Ior damages

the cnange OF grade or which the reiatCr
complains was not fled until the Gath Of
July, 1867. That OF 1896 lsupra, sec H. under
the provisions Of when the change was MADE,
ms alleged by the respondents declares that such
change should be established nom the time or

are making preparations to hail the
advent of the Centennial year with
imposing celebrations.


In Wilmington very little prepara-

Gus. The City Council has engaged a
band, which under charge of the Com
mlttee on Fire Companics-Messrs,

composed of firemcn, and all others
who chose to participate.


In addition bells and whistles will
be sounded all over the city, and near
y all the bells will be rung during
the hour between 11:30 and 1910
o clock. Then there will be many
spontaneous ebulitions of patriotism,
IN accordance with the various feelings
and opinions of those who Join in the
celebration.


During the day the banks will be
closed, and number of manufacturing
establishments and business places
will suspend operations.


WHAT THE FIRE DEP EPARTMESr WILL DO j..
In accordance with the request of
Chief Engineer Mccall of the Fire
Department to night, will celebrate
the event in an imposing manner.

All the engines will be steamed up,
and as IL o'clock strikes, the compan.
les will form in line of parade, headed
by the Chief and his assistants, and
march over the following route. Up
Market street to the Brandywine down
King TO Front, along to Market and
then repair to the different engine
| houses. Along the entire route the
steamer whistles will be blown and the
gongs continuously sounded.

| residences will be brilliantly lighted
up.

II is the present expectation Of those who
are foremost in the Baltimore, Chesapeake
and Delaware bay railroad enterprise, from
Harrington to point on Kent Island, that
work will be resumed about the LIST of May.
This We have on good authority. Within the
past few days the subject has received much
attention in Baltimore, and within the next {
fortnight a regular meeting will be held, ,
which promises to give new vitality to the
project. The war between the Baltimore and ,

promoted the interests of the new road across ,

has given their opponents an advantage, but
1t will do them no good AS party they are
gone. In fact, they were caught in the act so
often that their doom is sealed. The splendid
behavior and great patience of the Southern
people under all the provoking circumstances
OF the last few years. has at last elected the
the good will and sympathy OF the masses OF
the people of the North, and so the party pa
tfiats must make some other shift to fire the
Northern heart and they have lugged in re-
ligion in this Ohio campaign, and if success
fal Will IN every other state AS hate, strife
and war Is what kept it alive SO far. they will
use every effort to arouse the mob and create
disscnsion In every neighborhood. But they
will not succeed. The great American peo-
pie have too much good sense for that. 1t is
really funny, ifit was not too serious matter
to hear of a party, who has been found guilty
of the most astounding frauds until the name
of our public men are u reproacli. now going

The postofice at Lynchs, Kent county,


Md, has been temporarily closed and the
postmaster suspended. The cause is charge
of some irregularity in the accounts of the
office. By the closing of the Office very great
Inconvenience is caused to the people of that
vicinity who depended entirely upon it for
their mail facilities. The more especially is
this Inconvenience felt by the peach growers
during the shipping season. To them it is
not only matter Of annoyance and incon-
venience, but alse of pecuniary loss. 1t is to
be hoped that the matter will soon be settled
and the office re established.


Terrible Accident 70 q Child.


On Wednesday evening week, farmer
named Ash, living near Iron Hill, in this
county, on coming home from the field, turn
ed harrow with which he had been working
on its edge against a fence. In a little while
afterwards, Edith, little three year old
daughter Of Mr.. Ash, climbed up on the har-
row in her endeavors to reach something
upon one of the upper teeth, when the har-
row tilted over bearing the little girl to the
earth and one of the teeth entering her head.
Every thing possible was done for the little
sufferer, but no hopes were entertained of her
recovery Commercial.


Failure Of the Peach Shipment to


Europe.


A telegram to Samuel Townsend, ESQ.,,
from Peter Wright & Sons, Agents of the
American Steamship Company, received on
Tuesday, announced that the peaches shipped
per the steamer Ohio, of their line. to Liver
pool, England, were all rotten on their ar
rival at that port, owing to the exhaustion Of
the ice in the refrigerator vaults, which gave
out on the 29th of August The fruit carried
well until that time and until the End of Sep
tember, when it gave way and ""went down.
rapidly. 1t is said that but Is tons of ice
were carried by the steamer, which was en-
tirely insufficient.





James Hurt, Esq, Of Galena, Nd, came up
to Middletown on Monday last and while
here concluded to 60 around to the show
grounds and see the elephant. He went-he
saw-he was more than satisfied. He stepped
into the small tent to take look at the fat
woman, and saw there chance to make
fortune-a fellow had box in which were
quantity Of envelopes containing some num-
bers and some blanks. The payment of a
small fee entitled a man to draw one of these
envelopes and if he got one with certain num-
bers he was to draw prize-in one instance
a gold watch /; in another $500, &c. Now
Mr.. Hurt was not foolish enough TO think
that he could get $500 or any other sum, out
of one Of. those envelopes, and consequently
refused to make the venture, but he lost $500
for all that; and this is how he did it: While
talking to the man Of the envelopes the latter
his opinion that the whole party Of
which Mr.. Hunt was one, could not raise
5000 among them. This rather wounded the
pride of Mr.. Hurt and to prove the falsity of
the assertion he drew bis pocket book and
proceeded to count out $500. Just as he
finished, he says, the envelope man quickly
out and swept the money into his till,
to Mr.. Hurt, ''it is your turn to
draw now"" This Mr.. H. declined to do and
demanded the return Of his money but be
didn't get it. After vainly trying to get
back his greenbacks Mr.. Hurt left the tent
and, procuring warrant, endeavored to get
an officer to arrest the Circus Company on a
charge ofswindling him, but no officer could
be found and Mr.. Il. was obliged to return to
bis home with lighter pocket book and
heavier heart.


Another gentleman whose name we did not
learn lost $l00; and another $50.

The cessation of the rains for over a week
have somewhat checked the spread of the
epidemic, however, and this, with the en-
orced caution Of the farmers, may terminate
he calamity. The assertion is made in some |
quarters that the disease has been caused in |
lot few instances by over work and lack Of |
proper food. Provender is short and many
armers have had nothing much but grass to

be joined by Gen. Rivers. AT first
many thought it plan to scare the
whites, but yesterday letter was
found in Jefferson county to colored
companies giving substantially the
same instructions. The whites, ap-
pretending trouble, telegraphed to
Macon for ammunition, which was
promptly furnished and distributed to
the local companies. Every prepara-
tion was made for conflict, but meas
ures were taken to prevent a collision,
and by dusk last evening eighty ne
groes, charged with being ringleaders
in the movement, had been arrested.
1t is alleged that the correspondence
captured shows the existence of con-
spiracy among the negroes of Wash
ingtOn, Jefferson, Johnson and Burke
counties. 1t is now feared that the
whites will not await the trial, but
lynch the prisoners. Moderation is
counseled, but fears of the worst are
entertained. Many believe the affair
is greatly exaggerated and that no
mischief was intended. A letter SIM
liar to the above was intercepted in
Hancock county some time since and
the whites armed, but no conflict was
begun. AT present there is the great
est excitement in the counties named
and the slightest imprudence may
cause the most serious consequences.
In an editorial notice of the above
dispatch, the Times says: ""Up to the
present point the alarm seems ludic-
rous, but when we think of the possi-
BILE fate of the poor negroes In the
hands of the militia, crazy with fear,
it has serious lOok.n

Lynch Law Ii, Illinois.
SPRINGFIELD, Ills, August 19th.-
Gov. Beveridge has received unofficial
information that Vigilance Commit
tee has been formed in Jackson coun-
ty, and that they have already ar
rested and severely whipped one party
suspected of having been connected
with the Ku-Klux. The Governor
greatly disapproves the action of the
committee. The fact that they were
disguised during the arrest and whip
ping of the man in question, makes
them almost as great law-breakers as
the Ku-Klux themselves. He thinks
that if the men want to enforce the
law, they ought to do so unmasked
and through the Courts. States At
torney Burr, of Franklin county, is
still here, but has heard nothing addi-
tional to the news he gave out last
night. He says that the purpose of
the people of his county is to get rid of
the Ku-Klux through the Courts first;
this failing, the people will hang them
as fast as caught, until the last one of
them shall have been dispatched.

ment of that region will warrant it.


The Kain Storms.


NEW YORK, August 19th.-Reports
from points up the Hudson river show
that the rain storms of the past week
have been very disastrous at Mack,
the streets having been completely
flooded, bridges borne away aud stores
and private dwellings flooded with
water. On the Northern New Jersey
Railroad, land-slides have occurred at
several places, completely covering
the track with trees, stones and mud.
At Piedmont the bed of the road was
washed away to a depth of ten or fif-
teen feet, and the debris carried down
the mountain sides upon the houses
below. All through Rockland county
there was much damage by both light
ming and rain. Two barns were burn
ed and several residences shattered by
the lightning. The storm yesterday
was very severe and the tracks of both
the Northern Railroad and New Jer-
sey and New York road were washed
away, and at several places traffic is
completely stopped. The amount Of
damage in Rockland and adjoining
counties is in calculable.


1t is stated that charges of malfeas-
ance and incompetency will be pre-
ferred to the Mayor, against all the
Police Commissioners except General
Smith, and their removal be re-
quested.

there were 1892 organized infantry

SO rounds of ammunition, was suff1-

five times our numbers. II we could

NEAR APPoMATTox, G. H., Va,
April 18th, 1865. :
His Ercellsncy Jefferson Davss:


Mr.. PREsIDENT:-It is with pain
that announce toyour Excellency the
surrender Of the Army of Northern
Virginia. The operations which pre-
ceeded this result will be reported In
full. will therefore only now state
that upon arriving at Amelia court
house on the morning of the 4th with
the advance of the army, on the re-
treat from the lines in front OF Rich
mond and Petersburg, and not finding
the supplies ordered to be placed there
nearly twenty-four hours were lost in
endeavoring to collect in the country
subsistence for men and horses. This
delay was fatal, and could not be re-
trieved. The troops, wearied by con-
tinued fighting and marching for sew
days and nights, obtained neither rest
nor refreshment, and on moving on
the 9TH, on the Richmond and Dam
vile Railroad, found at Jetersville
the enemy's cavalry, and learned the
approach of his infantry and the gen.
eral advance of his army toward Burk-
vile. This deprived US of the use of
the railroad and rendered 1t impiacti-
cable to procure from Danville the
supplies ordered to meet us at points
of our march. Nothing could be OBJ
tanned from the adjacent country. Our
route to the Roanoke was therefore
. changed, and the march directed upon
Farmville, where supplies were order
ed from Lynchburg. The change of
route threw the troops over the roads
pursued by the artillery and wagon
trains west of the railroad, which I'M
peded our advance and embarrassed
our movements. On the morning of
the 9th General Longstreet's corps
{ reached Rice's Station, on the Lynch
burg railroad. 1t was followed by the
Commands of Generals r. III. Ander-
son, Ewell and Gordon, with orders
to close upon it as fast as the progress
of the trains would permit, or as they
could be directed, on roads further
west. Gen. Anderson, commanding
Pickett's and B. r. Johnson's divis.
ions, became disconnected with Ma
homes division forming the rear of
Longstreet. The enelny's cs valry PEN
etrated the line of the march through
the intervals thus left, and attacked
the wagon train moving toward Farhi-
vile. This caused serious delay in
tho march of the centre and rear OF
the column, and enabled the enemy to
mass upon their flank. After success.
sive attacks, Andelson's. ard Ewell's
corps were captured or driven from
their position. Tho latter general,
| with both his division commanders,
Kershaw and Custis Lee, and his
brigadiers "" ere taken prisoners. Cor.
don, who all the morning, aided by
Gen. w. L. Lee cavalry, had checked
the advance of the enemy on the road
from Amelia Springs. and protected
the trains, became exposed to his
combi cd assaults, which he bravely
resisted and twice repulsed; but the
cavalry having been withdrawn to
another part of the line of march, and
the enemy massing heav:ly on his
front and both TANKS, renewed the
attack about 9 p. m, and drove them
from the fed In much cOnfusion.-
The army continued its march during
the night, and every effort was maze

been shattered by the days operations;
but, the men being depressed by ia.
; tigue and hunger, many threw away
their arms, while others followed the
wagon trains and embarrassed their
progress. On the morning of the 9Th,
rations were issued to the troops as
they passed Farnville, but the safety
of the trains requiring their removal
upon the approach OF the enemy, all
could not be supplied. The army,
reduced 10 two corps, under Longstreet
and Gordon, moved steadily on the
Dad to the Appomattox court house,
thence its march was ordered by Camp
bell court house, through Pittsylvania
toward Danville. The roads were
wretched and the progress slow. By
! great efforts the head of the columns
reached Appomattox court house, on
the evening Of tho 9Th, and the troops
were halted for rest. The march was
! ordered to be resumed at one a. m. on
the 9Th. Fitzhugh Lee, with the cav
airy, supported by Gordon, was order
ed to drive the enemy from his front,
wheel to the left and cover the pas
sage of the trains, while Longstreet,
who from Rice's Station had formed
the rear guard, should close up and
hold the position. Two battallions Of
artillery and the ammunition wagons
| were directed to accompany the army,
the rest of the artillery and wagons to
move toward Lynchburg. In the early
part of the night the enemy attacked
Walkers artillery train near Apo
mattox Station on the Lynchburg rail
road, and were repelled. Shortly af-
terward their cavalry dashed toward
the court house, till lhalted by our line.
During the night there were indica.
tions of large force massing on our
left and front. Fitzhugh Lee was di-
rected to ascertain its strength, and to
suspend his advance till daylight if me-
cessary. About ga. m, on the 9th,
with Gordon on his left, he moved for
ward and opened the way. A heavy
force of the enemy was disco gered ep
posite opposite Gordon's right, which,

New YORK SUPREME CouRr,l
EDMOND STEPHENSON Esq. -


My DEAR SR-l beg to acknowledge the receipt OF
your note OF the 26th INST, in which you advise of
the appointment of special committee of the Board of
Commissioners of Emigration to Investigate the case
Of the people Ton complaint of Eliza Cons against
August Major tried before in the Court oyer and
fermner, and request my opinion as to whether the
District Attorney is properly chargeabe with any
dcrclcon OF duty on his part in the prosecution of
the case.


In reply only repeat what have already said
verbally in response to the inquiry of Mr.. Commits
Eioncr Lynch-viz, that there was nothing whatever
In the manner of trying the Indictment justify any
reflection upon the learned and respected District At
lorney.


Mr. Lyons, the Assistant District Attorney, who con-
Quoted the prosecution, pressed with more than his
ordinary zeal, and seemed much disappointed Mt the
result as do not hesitate to say was for, while
always bow with respect to the judgment of jury, IL
seemed to me that the verdict in this case had caused
miscarriage Of justice.


v ith respect TO the specific points to which you re-
ier would say that the only jurors set aside were
those as TO whom the prisoner exercised his legal right
Of peremptory challenge. Their places probably
nlled by other jurors duly drawn from the box.


As to the ssexamnation Of the witnesses for the
defence, IT will be perceived by examination of tho
uenographers notes that the character of Rosina
Demarest was sufficiently lmpeachcd and that her
srcdibtty was unfavorably referred to in my charge
As TO the other witnesses have special recollcc-
tion but am quite clear that there nothing
usual nor seemingly neglcctml in the manner Of cross
examination aud nothing certainly to warrant
suspicion that the trial was allowed TO 60 by default

and Grant, are decided friends of the latter. and
the Lynchburg Fir9inian, speaking OF the
formers book, rather amusingly says :"" He
evidently looks upon himself as superior to
Grant He can't convince tile North of that,
nor the South either. 1t may may not bc saying
much for him, but Grant could whip him to-day
either in a campaign, or fist fight, or anything
but writing book or running foot race.
Upon this. the Norfolk Landmark adds


We are clearly of opinion that when the war
records of the two men are compared the decision
will be in favor of Grant and this comparison
can be made nowhere to better advantage than
IN the South 1t is on this side Of the Potomac
that they can be more justly measured than any
where else in the Union. When this task is per-
formed it will be found that Grant was not only
the most tenacious commander the FSderals
ever put in the field, but that he was more
humane in all his actions than Sherman. 1t is
true We suffered frightfully from Grants army
but there is no page in the records OF his
campaigns which Is not luminous with mercy
compared with the hideous chapters of history
which Sherman made in his bossted and Inelo-
dramatic March to the Sea-


These are fair indications Of strong feeling,
entertained at the South, of appreciation
and esteem for Grant. We do not quote them
because of their unfavorable comparative opin-
ions Of Sherman, for the Presidents career does
not need praise at the expense of any other In
dependently, Grants military record will appear
on the page OF time in gigantic letters, and his
deeds Of kindness to the South, in the field and
in the Cabinet, do him credit. After he shall
have left the Presidential chair, he will be
praised and honored in the South to degree
which we now can scarcely imagine."

PARSONS IN GAs-LIoHT ON THE METHODS


OF THE DEPARTMENT or PUBLIC WORKS.


Tho Senate Committee of Investigation continued its
work yesterday at the Fifth Avenue Hotel


George H. Andrews, OF the Tax Commissioners
OF the city Of New York, the first witness called
and testified that the proportion or the state tax paid
by the city was over fifty per cent


Mr.. Davenport-Why is IL that the city pays such =
large portion Of the State tax?


witness-Because the State Board OF Equalization
has the power to exact it.


Mt Davenport-Is il an equitable proportions


Witness-No, sir


Mr. Davenport-what would be fair and equitable
portion for the city TO pay?


Wincss-The amount allotted for the year 1875 ex-i
cecds equitable proportion by 81 600 900; the
question Of personal property has this year entered
into the equalization; the amount of personal property
III the State assessed this year is over $2l7 600


Mr.. Davenport-How much Of that is collected9


witness-The deficiencies great; in 1874 II wasI
S37 600 900; in 1878 $44 600 o00 In 1872 IL was
s5l 0o0o 600; the rate OF taxation for 1874 so; E

taxes given to the Financial Department;

appear before the State Board OF Equalzation the
effect on the Board only moral; practical good
resulted $50 900 600 added TO the already
high assessment made upon the city by the State
Board; think the city should be represented in tho
Board; this could be done by providing that there
should be State assessor from each judicial district;
at present the dumb city has imposed upon it half
OF the State tax that virtually half of the Stats
the other half the laws OF the State relative
taxation are most oppressive think the tax shonld
be personal property alone corporations should be
taxed their gross receipts, that from those to
whom much is given much should be required whereas
it now happens that by strict construction Of the law
the wealthiest corporations eyade taxation and tho
lesser are subjected to IL; wealthy gentlemen
threaten 10 move away from the city unless their axes
are reduced worse than that, they do move away


W. A. W. Wilkinson was then examined In relation
to the quality OF gas supplied by the different city
panieE He Is Assistant Professor of Chemistry tho
College Of the City of New York he has been employed
in testing the gas made by the Mutual and Manhattan
companes that of the Manhattan averaged fifteen
candle power that Of the Mutual about twenty candle
powcr the difference arises from the mode of making
the gas; the Mutual works under patent process,
which involves the use Of naphha product OF petro
leum; the Manhattan uses coal only. The Mutual was
the least expensive process; the witness had no inter-
in these patents but employed from day to day
by the engineer OF the Mutual TO test the gas in order
their product from attaining too much poworI
as the gas then would smoke.


Henry McCabe Clerk OF the Sixth District Court was
recalled He was examined generally relative to the
management Of affairs in that court He admitted thar
one Bernard had sometimes acted as clerk in his aD
sence, but only occasionally


Joseph Burke next sworn. Burke Is an employs
of the Department of Public Works He worked as a.
laborer under foreman Corkery one of the Boule-
wards; Cookery drunk on the 4th OF October; ho
not present on the work the 5th, 9th 1th and
Sth OF October; OF his boarders called the roll for
him; witness knew OF his taking away oak logs and
sand, the property of tho city; he also him give
kcg OF powder to a contractor named Foley: Foley was
then at work digging cellar for himself


Abraham Bernard, the general factotum of the Sixth
District Court then took the stand He testified that
he clerk to Marshal Boylan; kept account, but
divided the receipts daily he sometimes acted as clerk
the absence OF the regular clerk McCabe. Nothing
new was elected from this witness beyond what
already testified to by others.


Matthew Brandon, an Inspector Of Public Works, was
examined in regard to the mode OF doing business IN
the department The object seemed TO be to prove by
his testimony that officers the works devoted por
tion of The time which belonged 10 the public to prl-

Sheriff Lynch, but had only devoted few hours alto

neither asked nor received favors from him.


Thomas Cummings witty and rather quaint son Of
the Emerald Isle corroborated Brandon's testimony,
and did not think the latter had in fact done justice to
himself The witness amused the committee by
various dscursOry romarks OF his things in
general and the way in which laborers generally
treated


Richard o'Bren testified .hat he had been general
foreman IN the employ of the Department OF Public
Works March 20 ast he had charge OF the East

way in Council, last night, re-electing all
the minor officers who have been faithful
TO it, amongst them Street Commissioner
Coyle, who so openly ran his department
in the interest of the faction at the last
city election; and it revenged itself on
VIM. G. Spruance, Esq, City Solicitor,
BY defeating him for reelection because
he opposed it last Fall.-Every Evening.


Well, where were the anti-Ring men,
bers. that they did not vote with the
Democrats for Mr.. Cummins, Demo-
orat or Mr.. Springer, Republican p
The fact is that ""the City Ring had
things all its own way"" because the So
ellled anti-Ring Republicans, excepting
VIM. N. Canhy, voted with it. There
were sixteen votes cast, of these Mr..
Rumford received o; Mr.. Cummins 6 :;
and MIR. Spruance l for City Commits
aioner, Mr.. Coyle received 10; Mr.. Spring.
re. Now this vote would lead to the
conclusion that either VIM. NJ. Canby or
some Democrat voted for Mr.. Coyle. Mr.
Candy would hardly have the effrontery
to nominate Mr.. Springer in opposition
to the caucus of his own party Ring and
refuse to vote for him. 1t is, therefore,
Sair to presume that some Democrat yo.
ted for Mr.. Coyle, and that it took Mr..
VIM. N. Canby's vote to make up six.
the number given Mr.. Cummins. But
where were the absent Democrats ?
TheJ should have been on hand. It is
Sue they could not have elected an Off
eer, even with the aid Of Mr.. Canby's
vote and the votes of William Canby
and John Adams, the so-called anti
Eang members, but it would have been
gratifying to have seen the Ring, if de-
seated, pressed to the wall requiring the
sasting vote Of the President.

ceiiar IN the present building and dig a

They went down few feet further and
a stream OF water bubbled up. The de-
scendants Of the shareholders thought
this strange, and on inquiry they learn
ed that the coffee house had originally
stood at the rivers edge. This fact was
doubted until Mr.. De Peyster conversed
with a carpenter who had helped to
build u staircase on the wharf near the
coffee house for Washington to land af-
ter his Inauguration.

made an estimate that it would take un
I'll 1874 to reduce the number of lives to
seven. He based his estimates on STU
dies into the longevity OF the nominees
| ancestors, most OF whom he found to
have lived to ripe old age. An expert
ip the settlement of life annuities said
| that 1T would take until 1872 to bring
the nominees down to seven. In 1855
there were fifty-fve of the nominees.
which the compilers of annuity tables
regarded as a remarkable thing of lon
gevlty. On the 1st of January, 1870. the
survivors numbered only eight, most of
them being octogenarians. There were
none OF the original shareholders alive.
They left their shares to their heirs or
to their executors to be sold.


Horatio Gates Stevens, one of the
eight nominees, died in 1870, in his 9th
year. The share on his life was origi
nally bought by George Blight, mariner
His demise left the number of the nomi-
nees at seven, and suit was begun in
the Supreme Court for the partition of
the Tontine property in accordance with
the plan of the founders OF the associa-
tion. The suit is still pending, and it
cannot he settled for some tirae, as heirs
OF the original shareholders who bet on
the seven survivors are constantly COM
ing to claim an interest in the estate.
The principals in these suits already
number thirty seven.


Mr.. Bayard died on Friday at the age
Of 81. The share ON his life has history
1t was sold by his father with the share
on his sister life to Col. de Peyster, who
afterward disposed of them, with other
shares to Mr.. Lawrence. The latter
sold them by auction, and the Bayard
shares are now held by w. r. Horne, a
wealthy retired merchant. Mr.. Bayard
belonged to the fifth generation OF Bay
aids born in this city. The Bayard farm,
from which Bayard street is named, was
owned by his great great grandfather,
and was divivided into small lots as
property rose in value. One of his sis
ters was the wife OF the patron of Rens
salaer county. She is still living.

Yesterday, unless Governor Pachcco
to prevent the contamination
of the sentence, Tiburco Nasquez paid
with his lite the penalty of his crime
against the law. That the fate of this
bandit is just and deserved one, all
must admit, and the mock humanitari-
anism which is exhibited in so many in
stances where life is demanded for life,
would be deemed sadly out Of place if ex-
hibited in behalf of this wholesale muir
Gerer. Not but Vasquez has friends
among a certain class who would move
heaven and earth to procure commuta-
ton of his sentence, if they thought they
had a reasonable prospect of success. -
Tor those who commit murder while in
the heat of passion, or when led on by a
sense Of real or supposed injury, there
are always friends, who look upon their
crime with a desire to palliate and ex-
cuse but for the cowardly brigand, who
sacrifices human life in the hope OF gain
humanity can have no sympathy. All
are compelled TO recognize the fact that
the public safety requires that for that
class OF criminals justice should be sure
and speedy.


Looking back through the twenty-five
years which have passed since the State
was brought into prominence by the gold



discoveries, which brought to these shores
such motley gathering Of humanity as
only mining country can exhibit, il
seems almost matter of wondermcnt
that more brigandage has not made
| our mountain Businesses place Of terror.
Yet human life has been rs secure, to a
great extent, as in the older States, and
perhaps we can say with truth, more SO
than in some. The early days of the
mines witnessed scenes of disorder and
violence-of n disregard of human life
bordering on barbarism-yct no more so
than in the border history Of almost any
prompting the crime Of murder were raro-
| ly merccnary, or, at least, 'were not with
a view directly to robbery. Disputes
about claims, or discussions of that ma
ture has cost many n man his life, and
such was to be expected in a country
where the bowie knife and revolver were
so often the arbitrators in settling disput-
ed questions Of property. But if crime
was rampant, retribution was speedy /;
often the murderer and his victim were
laid in their last narrow home at the
same hour, for Judge Lynch held court
where legal quibbles and technichalites
were seldom permitted to interfere with
the course Of justice.


When we consider the numerous dis
appointments which accompany mining
| life, and the opportunities everywhere
offered to those whose regard for the
rights Of others Is SO limited that they
would not scruple to enrich themselves
Mt the expense of others, it seems strange
that the existence of organized bands OF
robbers is an exception to the general
condition Of the country. Joaquin Mu-
rietta and Tom Bell nourishcd for time
but the swift punishment which followed
their msdeeds gave little encouragement
to those who might have been desirou. OF
emulatng their achievements. And in
deed, it seems as If the perpetrators OF
crime of every character are ferreted
out and brought to justice with more GER
tainty in California than in almost any
country. At present the cities appear to
furnish the field for the operations OF the
class from which tho State Prison re-
cruts are drawn, while the country and
the mines are the home of honest work
ing men.


The execution Of Vasquez will dampcn
the ardor Of those who were disposed to
initiate him while successful, and it will
be years, probably before his counterpart
will be found. Il ut that the material for
many another band like that which Vas
quez controlled, exists, and which only
lacks leadership and organization to make
itself dreaded, we do not question. The
decisive measures taken for the capture
| of the bandit, and the fate which followed
his capture will'strike terror to the hearts
OF the desperate characters, and the coun-
try can rest in security."

we went to press, the doctors assured us
that there was hardly ghost ofa show
for Mr.. Hawley, the victim of the
knife of young Mayer, but we had
more faith in Hawley's vitality than
in the fiat OF q college ofphyslcians, so
We gave the wounded man the benefit
of the doubt, and there is now every
prospect of his recovery. DIR. Shorb
at ten O'clock was of the belief that
the wound was not fatal, but
was overruled and left the case In the
hands of Mr.. Hawley's physician, Dr.
Ross, and his consu lting physicians.
We waited up In momentary expecta-
tion ofhearing Of the victims death,
but at o'clock he seemed to be i'm
proving, and we went to bed.
The last good-byes had been said
and Hawley, to many friend, was
the hoodlum's victim. Yesterday
morning at an early hour we learned
that the wounded man was recovering,
much to the Joy of host of friends,
and the discontinue of medical sci
ence. BY late reports last night he
was mending rapidly, and is in a fair
way to be officiating in newspaper
dom at an early date.


HIS AssAILANT.


John Mayer, his assailant, hid him.
self in q lumber yard on Tuesday
night, and in the morning went home,
when his father promptly delivered
him to the Sheriff, who committed
him to Jail. Last evening we inter-
viewed him in his cell, and, though
annoyed by the presence of mur-
derer, a horse-thief, house-breaker
and several other criminals in the
same cell, got his statement.


HIS APPEARANCE.


He is apparently about nineteen
years old, and prematurely aged In
crime. He is probably five feet eight
and half inches high, slim, rather
weak build, of snaky figure, sallow
complexion, dark hair and eyes. He
has an unhealthy look, physically,
mentally and morally. Though of a
good family, with model parents and
respectable friends, he is evidently the
out-growth of the streets and dens of
iniquity. He Is rank production,
his ideas of bravery and honor being
obtained from Dick Turpin literature;
his pattern of manhood copied from
the highwayman; his morals obtained
of the brothel.


HIS STATEMENT.


On Tuesday night l was drunk on
Main street, near the Grange Store,
and got into row with man who
was called Lynch, and who knocked
me down, giving me this black eye
and scatched face. AS l got up an
other man, wearing a plug hat, ap-
preached and struck at me with his
cane. did not recognize him, it be-
ing impossible to do so, owing to the
darkness. l did not know Hawley,
and had been already sufficiently
abused by the man Lynch, and when
my new assailant raised his cane, I
determined to defend myself, struck at
him and ran, not knowing the result
of my blow. I do not recollect of him
calling out that he was stabbed and
did not notice him pursuing me.


SUGGESTIONS.


This was the result of the interview,
obtained in detachments and subject
to frequent interruptions by noto-
rious criminal named Crooks, who is
up for stealing q carpenters tools, and
who has evidently taken young Mayer
under his tutelage. 1t is a matter of
regret that our criminal accomm0da-
tiOns are SO inadequate that prisoner
of the age of Mayer is put into the
same cell with old and hardened GRIM
inals to receive their instruction in
deeper infamy. The Jail is we'll kept,
is clean and neat, but the huddling to-
gether of prisoners of all ages and de-
grees of crime is against the spirit Of
the age, and the County Supervisors
should consider gravely its conse-
quences in the future criminal annals
of this county. AS at present consti-
tuted, the Jail is school from which
criminals graduate better fitted for
preying on the community after their
slight restraint. The Jail should per-
NIT no communication between GRIM
inals inside or outside, and unless this
sequestration is accomplished jails fail
of their purpose."

The public schools of the city re-
sumed work yesterday with favora-
BILE attendance of pupils.


The shipments from Downey yester-
day were 643 sacks of corn, 32 sacks of
meal and SO sacks of bran.


Lumber is very scarce at Anaheim,
owing to the improvements in pro-
gress.
Ties and lumber are being forwarded

in the rumor that passenger rates have
been advanced.

bids fair to create considerable work
for the police. Ua. +
Yesterday Mr.. Baker, of SO, Spring
street, sent a package of coin to Mr..
Ferguson's, opposite the Court House;

proper owner.

to his own personal knowledge but desired that
Daniel r. Stewart be calleG as witness.


Mr.. Candy objected, saying that Mr.. Hawkins
had preferred the charges and he ought to sus-
tain them by his own knowledge and should first
tell all that he knew in the case.
Mr. Pickles ruled that Mr.. Stewart was COM
petent witness, and that it was perfectly proper
for the charges to be proven by witnesses other
than Mr.. Hawkins.


Hr. Hawkins SAID he was only taxpayer and
preferred the charges as duty,


Mr.. Candy rose and said he was representing
| Mr., Hyde in this matter and he did not intend to

A Catholic Procession MObbed-


Prompt and Effective Action of the


Police. b,t:. r.. n .a


TORONTO, Ont, Oct. 3.-The fears en-
tcrtained in regard to the Roman Catholic
pilgrimage, to-day, have proved well ground
ed, as the proceedings in connection with it
were very riotous and disgracefui, resulting
in considerable bloodshed. Theprogramme
was to march to St. Mary's Church, Ba-
thrust street, in the west end of the city,
from st. Michael's Cathedral. The process.
sion was collector at st. Michael about 2!3O
p. m. A surging and excited crowd, num-
bering over 10000, had collected outside,
guarded by the police force, the military,
about 800 strong, and with detachment Of
cavalry from Mackham. The Lieutenant
Governors body guards were stationed near
Balhurset street, but did not come east un-
til the return of the procession. After mass
was said in the church, the Catholics form
ed in procession, headed by Father Shea and
Bishop Lynch. The way was cleared and
they moved to Church street, but when at
the corner of Queens street, stones were
thrown at the procession, and several shots
were fired from reyolvers. The pro-
cessionists returned the shots, and
the shower of stones, and the
advance staff of police charged on the crowd
and dispersed them temporarily. All then
went quietly with the exception of some
slight disturbances on account of stone
throwing from the crowd directed at the
police, until at the corner of Queen and Bay
streets the mob gathered and sent another
volley of stones. Several shots were fired
but the police succeeded in again dispensing
the rioters. Several of the rioters moved
in advance of the police within throwing
distance, and pelted the police with stones


The latter stood the fire like men. The
mob meanwhile gaining in numbers again
charged on the procession in front and were
again repulsed. Revolvers were freely used
on both sides at Port Sand. About fifty
shots were fired:


At Brock street, where the greatest distur-
bance was feared, the crowd had increased to
about 10000 in number. No attack was
made, however, as the really most active
rioters were not numerous and were very
cowardly. They were composed mostly of
young men who, after charging, turned and
at Hurst street the procession numbering
about 5000 persons halted. They did not
enter their church but had prayers outside
and were then ordered by the priest to dis
perse. The line of march was then taken
up down Bathwest St and along Front street |
we're no attack could be more from the South |
If the procession. The disturbcrs were
guarded from the north by the military, who
accompanied the procession on the next
treet. When the procession was about to
move the crowd at North Street
harged on the Police. P. G. Riggel was
aiken to his house badly wounded, and he
viii probably die. The pilgrims proceeded
uietly down Front to Power, dispensing at
oints on the way and disbanding at the
arish church. The crowd had broken into
ections and collected at points along King,
Queens and Front streets, but gradually
isbanded. Mayor Metcalfe and Hon. j.
I. Cameron accompanied the military and
ssured VicarGeneral Rooney, who feared
disturbance at Bathurst street, that the
catholics would be protected if there was
over enough in the city to do SO. '"

On the arrival of the one o'clock train from the east, the clergy and invited guests were re- ceived by Father Lynch of Lakeville, and his temperance organization known as the St. Marys of the Lake Temperance society, the members of which, wearing their beau tiful regalia, were drawn up in line at the depot After the train passed, the clergy in carriages proceeded to the residence of Father Lynch, followed by the St. Marys society in procession, which was led by the Lakeville cornet band After refresh ments at the house the procession was re- formed and proceeded to the grounds, on which the church was being erected.

 The clergy present who participated in the exercises were az follows: The Very Rev. James Hughes, administrator (acting Bishop,) of Hartford Rev. James Lynch of Waterbury Rev. T. J. Synnott of Bridgeport; Rev. Luke Daly, New Britain; Rev. Peter Smith, Norwalk; Rev. Eugene GaffaneY, Thomaston Rev. M. P. Lawler, New London; Rev. B. O'Reiley Sheridan, Collinsville and Rev. H. J. Lynch ot Lake vile.

 On the arrival of the procession at the grounds, the nine clergymen proceeded i'm mediately to the large cross, which is placed where the altar is to be erected, and having recited prayer and blessed the cross, made that starting point and pro- cecded in a procession mound the inside of the walls, sprinkling them with holy water and blessing them, reciting Psalms appro- priats to the ceremony, after which they. made circuit of the church on the out side, blessing the walls in the same manner as on the interior. The stone which was 10 receive the box of records etc. was then blessed according to the Roman ritual, and the usual prayers for the ceremony were recited, also the ltany, or invocation of the Saints. The box was then deposited and the stone placed in its position. The box, which is made of copper, contained eccle- siastical and historical records. coins of the United States, Canada, England and France, copy each of the New York Tribune, Tunes and Herald; the various Catholic papers, the CONN. WESTERN NEWS and other papers. After the stone was fixed in its position. they again march ed around the church walls, the Vicar Gen. eral intoning the MSserere met, which was repeated by the rest of the clergy in cho- rus. When this ceremony was completed, they proceeded to the platform erected for them, and after selection by the band. the Vicar General began his sermon.

 To say that the speaker was eloquent in his remarks would express the opinion of all who heard him. He began by congrat- ulating all, not because the occasion was 8 feast of the Catholic church, but because of the noble work in which they are en- gagged, of erecting tabernacle in which to worship God. and they had commenced aright, with the blessing of God on their corner stone. Unless the Lord build your house, ye build in vain, said the speaker.

 He recognized many of his dissenting brethren"" among hls hearers, and welcomed them because they ""were in search of right"" He defended the various features in the Roman service, by arguments and reasons that possessed power, as for in stance he said 'When Christ broke the bread and said This is my body etc., he wanted people to take Christ at His word. If man of the world makes remark, you believe him, but when Christ says plainly This is my body, you will not be- lieve HSne!"" He then discoursed eloquent ly on the various proofs of the soundness of his religion, and called to his assistance the eYangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, whose teachings bore ample testi- mony of the truth of his assertions.

 As is very liable to occur with extempo- raneous speaking, the reverend gentleman at one time, fell into slight error, but so quickly discovered it and proceeded to something else, few probably noticed it. He was extolling the merits of the above mentioned evangelists, and when he came to St. John, he alluded to him as ''He who leaped in his mothers womb''-Just so faI he got when he saw where he was, and concluded the sentence by adding Tn an un. dertone-""when she was visited"" Oul readers will not be slow to realize the fact he for the moment got the two Johns slightly mixed in his mind.

 Toward the close of his remarks he all ]uded in glowing terms to the enchanting scenery hereabout, saying he had never seen any so beautiful since his visit to Ge- noa in Italy. and were the lake little lar. ger, would be almost fac simile of the lovely scenery about Queenstown and Cork ID Ireland.

 He concluded his sermon by appealing to his hearers to contribute generously to aid in the construction of their new church After his reverence had done speaking, ar opportunity was offered for contributions, and the thousand dollars obtained will testify to the power of theeloquence of Vicar Gen eral Hughes in this appeal. It IS but jus

 tice to the visiting clergy to say they, each and every one of them, contributed with a generous hand, from their own substance in aid of the project.

 The Rev. Father Hughes, who has labor ed under many disadvantages in his efforts to build up this people and church edefct for them to worship in, is to be congratulated in his commendable success With oul iron mines and furnaces idle, the people art comparatively weak in purse, but are com ing nobly up to the work. Their newly established and closely adhered to temper ance principles, are saving them money fenough to build their church and if they are frequently reminded that their hart earned dollars are building them beauti- full church, in which not only will they"

state VS.. Samuel Barber, indicted for larceny.
Barber is small lad of about 10 or IA years
of age. He was charged with taking money
from the drawer Of the store of Hosea Sith-
ems, Millville, to the amount of SO. Jas II.
Nixon, Esq, at the request of the court,
defended him.


The jury after being out but a short time
returned with the verdict, Guilty.


The state VS.. Henry Bishop, charged with
keeping a disorderly house in the city of
Millville was then moved. Col. VIM. E.
Potter counsel for the prisoner.


THURSDAY.


The Judge charged the jury in the case
of Henry Bishop, and the jury retired for
deliberation.


The state VS.. S. Barrett Smith indicted
for larceny was then moved. The counsel
for the state held that by the Goth section
of the revised statutes of New Jersey the
appropriation of property by Bailee was
larceny. He held that Smith was such a
Bailee within the meaning of the law, and
hence committed larceny in appropriating
and selling certain horse in his possession.
The prisoner received colt from John B.
Bonham in December last to keep during
the winter. When the owner went after it
the next summer, the prisoner had sold it.
Smith tried to persuade him to take his
note, which was considered nearly worth
less, in pay for the colt. But Bonham re-
fused to do so, not authorizing any sale.


After argument by counsel and charge
by the Judge the jury ON this case retired,
and returned a verdict of guilty, but re-
commended Smith to the mercy of the
Court.


The State VS.. Baron Moncrief, indicted
for an assault on the tender of the Broad
street bridge, on the evening of the 21st of
September last. The jury found him guilty
without leaving their Seats


By permission of the court Martin G..
Carstens, Jr., retracted his plea of not
guilty and plead guilty.


The State VS.. John J. & Andrew J. Meyer,
indicted for assaulting an officer was then
moved Col Potter for the defence.
The assault is alleged to have occurred
on the 23d of June last, on officer Camm of
the city police, who with others was at
tempting to quell a riot which occurred on
that day, in consequence of the information
given at the Mayors Office by some parties
from Vinel. nd, against certain violators of
the liquor ordinances of the city. One of
the witnesses produced some laughter in
the court room by stating that during the
affray his Honor, the Mayor attempted to
arrest colored man by the name of Nico-
demus Lively for disorderly conduct, who
claimed the privilege of the civil rights bill,
whereupon he was Immediately released
The evidence was closed at four o'clock,
and the jury dismissed until Friday morn
ing at nine o'clock.


The Court then sentenced David Lynch
for assault and battery, $5 and costs.
Joseph Hunter sentenced for assault and
battery, S. and costs.


J. johnson, sentenced for assault and
battery, committed with blackjack, while
under the influence of liquor, $50 and costs,
and Imprisonment in the County Jail until

counsel, and the jury charged in the State
VS.. John j. and Andrew J. Meyer.


The State VS.. VIM. Tullis, Geo. Tullis,
Geo. Kinlrle, Isaac Dare, Clement r. Cory,
John J. Meyer, Andrew J. Meyer, Robert
milford, VIM. Tweed, G. Gottleib Cast
and Aaron Rheinstrom, indicted for rioting,
was then moved.


Col. VIM. E. Potter and Jas. H. Nixon,
Esq, counsel for defense.


An unsuccessful attempt was made by
their counsel to have the prisoners tried
separately.


Mayor Sheppard. officers Camm, Harris,
Seeley, and others testified to the occurrence
of a riot in this city on the 23d of June last,
and also to the participation of the prisoners
in the same; either directly by making
disturbance themselves, or indirectly by
being present and abetting and urging on,
the promiscuous mob.


At II O'Clock the jury in State VS.. Meyer
and Meyer, asked for information of the
court as to whether they could bring in
verdict of assault, only. The court instructed
them that they could.


The jury found John J. Meyer guilty of
assault, and acquitted his brother.


FRIDAY AFTERNOON.


Witnesses for the defence in the riot case.
were heard from 10 until 1880 D. m., and
the jury was then dismissed until o'clock.


At O'Clock court re-assembled. The
evidence in the riot case, on the part of the
defence, was concluded in little less than
a hour.


The jury in State vs. Bishop returned,
after having been out about thirty hours,
with a verdict of Not Guilty.


The jurors not out for business were then
discharged for the term.

then heard an issue of vagrancy, Francis
W. Armstrong appellant, VS.. Joseph s.
Woolford, appellee. Jas. R. Hoagland,
ESQ.,, for appellant, Jas. H. Nixon, Esq,
for appellee.


Woolford is charged with neglect in pro-
viding for his wife and children, who are
thereby likely to become chargeable to the
city of Millville; for which reason Armstrong
Overseer of the Poor, prays the Court for
an order to compel Woolford to provide for
her suitable maintenance.


The Judge reversed the decision of the
Justices Court, and thereby refused to
grant any order for Mrs. Woolford's sup
port. He said that no doubt the home DR..
Woolford had provided for her was far less

icy TELEGRAPH TO THE TRIBUNE.l


WASHINGTON, Feb. 4-The discussion on the Civil
Rights bill went on in the House for nearly three
hours to-day, with only now and then an incident
which attracted the attention of the House, or
caused members to look up from their letters and
rapers OF to suspend general conversation. The
first speech worthy of note that of Mr.. Sener of
Virginia This gentleman, whose career In Congress
began with the last session, and who has not
made prominent figure in the House until the
struggle over the Civil Rights bill took place,
was suddenly thrust before the public
by being the only Republican who at all times
voted with the Democrats against the new rule and
agaIns: every motion that tended to its adoption.
He is not the only Republican who is opposed to the
Civil Rights BILL but he was the only one who re-
fused by any vote he cast to give it any better
chance of becoming law than it had under the old
rules. For this be was most brutally attacked
by the household organ of the Administration,
called the Judas IscariOt Of the Republican
party au1 abused by the use Of many other
foul epithets, of which there has not been SO
liberal an application since the attempt to whip the
Liberals back into the Republican party In 1917 by
means of personal abuse. Mir. Sener explained his
position in manner that ought to satisfy any one.
Tie had voted in accordance with his Own convlc-
nons and the instructions of bis constituents. Inc
intimation that the attacks upon him had been
made bv order of the Administration was the climax
Of his speech.


The next incident to break in upon The monotony
enppCh
Hale of New-York, who was attempting to answer
the argument advanced by some of the Democrats
that the bill was unconstitutional. Turning aside
for a moment from the general drift of his argu-
ment he said that he would also support the bill,
because he believed that there were some Southern
States in which there were laws in contraven-
ton to the provisions OF the Fourteenth
Amendment Mr.. Lamar, who was stand
ing in the center aisle amid crowd
of members broke in upon Mr.. Hale at this point,
and asked him to name the State. Mr.. Hale could
not name the State but thought that the truth Oh
what he had said would not be denied MI Lamar
said that in no Southern State had such laws Deen
passed, and added in reply to question from MI
Hale. that in Mississippi the negroes had more prlv-
ileges in public convcyances than white people. Mr.
Hale was thoroughly discounted, and one or TWO
who came to his rescCe Jared no better.


The great event of the day. and one of the most
exciting incidents OF the session, the speech OF
Mr. John Young Brown of Kentucky. This gentle
man is one of the most gifted of the Democratic
Representatives. and if his discretion had equaled
his eoquence and his power OF lnvectye, his speech
might have been made as effective as 1t was and
still kept within the bounds OF parliament
tary law During the debate yesterday ne
attempted to get the floor and did actu-
ally begin to speak, but was Obliged
to yield as Mr. Lynch Of>Missssippi, colored man.
had been recognized and refused to yield. when ne
arose to-day the attention of the entire House was
arrested. and many of the members were on their
oet erowding the alsles and the space in front OF
the Clerks desk. He began by attacking the Civil
Rights bill as being unnecessary and mischievous.
and characterized it as having been conceived In
magnity, to be passed in defiance, and executed
ia bloodshed. At this point, and before he had
spoken more than two or three minutes, he was
interrupted by Mr.. Hale, who objected that the
language used was out Of order Proceedings were
suspended the sentence written out and read at the
Clerks desk. and the Speaker ruled that the Ian
guage was not unparlamentary Mr.. Brown then

thereto BIZ wrongs for which human justice
affords him no adequate redress; when he
kills to use the cOmmOnest illustration, the
debaucher of his wife or his daughter, and
the soft-hear.ed jury, though he be as sane as
anybody in the courtroom, brings him in
""Not guilty, by reason of insanity the sat
isfaction which sympathizing observers feel at
his escape is little diminished by the fraud
ulent nature of the finding. A case in Cali
fornia affords an illustration. Muybridge was
indicted for the murder Of Larkyns, who had
misled Mrs. Muybridge. At first the jury
stood five for conviction and seven for acquit-
tai. A second ballot on the same day gave
the same result. Finally all the jurors agreed
that the prisoner was justified in killing Lar
kyus, but differed as to the form of the YER
dict, the majority c0ntending for simple
""Not guilty."" the others holding for Not
""guilty ON account of insanity The
majority at last carried their point,
and verdict of ""Not guilty"" alono was
agreed upon. Now, whether the prisoner was
guilty or not, we are free to say that We
like the moral courage of calling a spade a
spade. If these jurors thought Muybridge
justified in Staying the violatOr of his honor
and the destroyer of his domestic happiness,
We are glad to find them frank at least in


avOwing an opinion which, OF course, upon
the other hand we esteem fearfully erroneous.
We do not think that the most outrageous
personal wrong justifies the murder of the
wrong doer. We deny, and all clear-headed,
right thinking persons will join with US in
denying, the right of private vengeance. No
apparent necessity, no social inconvenience,
however pressing, no extraordinary instance
of peculiar guilt, no difficulty in obtaining
regular convictions, no evidence of beastly
and almost total depravity, shall extOrt from
us the admission that what is called Lynch
Law is desirable as a precedent or in practice.
Neither are we prepared to approve verdicts
of ""Not guilty."" arrived at through the emo
tons without regard to plain and unquestion-
able evidence. We do not think that false"

| conEsy, a daughter of John Jackson, e
xsrmer, was shockingly abused By an
unknown negro man. The young lady
Is aged about 16 years, most rcspectab-
ly connected, and highly respected and
beloved.


1t appears the members of the family
were absent from the house. They
had all gone into the corn fields and
out to work, leaving the girl alone to|
get dinner, Miss Jackson went to the
spring short distance from the dwell
ling to get pail water. While return
Ing, she was met by the negro, who
seized her By the throat and dragged
her to the bushes, holding q loaded
gun in one hand, and threatening ""a
kill her If she resisted.


fought desperately, her dress being
torn in shTeos, and her face and ueck
being terribly cut and bruised. The
negro made his escape, but parties are
In pursuit oil him and if caught SUM
mary justice will be dealt to him.


The negro is little below the me-
dunn stature. He wore moustache,
side whiskers and goatee, and was
dressed in suit of dark plaid cloth
ing, with broad black binding, and
wore u black slouch hat. He had
been in the peighhorbood two or three
days.


THE VILLAIN CAPTURED.


The whole neighborhood soon star.
ted in pursuit of the william some on
horseback. Messrs. Thomas r. Cole,
and Columbus Gayior, came across the
negro in swamp near Stoney Run
He was sitting on o stump of treo
eating breakfast at the time, huge
sheath knife stuck in the bark of q
tree beside him, and Mr.. Jackson'a
gun near by. AS the pursuing party
approached John Sims, such is the
fiend's name,


RAISED THE GUN


and pointed it at Mr.. Gaylor, who
without the least apparent concern, or
dered him to lower the muzzle. The.
fellow did as he was ordered by throw
ing the weapon upon the ground and
then coolly walked toward his pursu-
ers. AS he did so the sheath knife was
observed in his hand. Cole ordered
him to drop that also, but before he I
could comply Gaylor sprang in and &
wrenched it from his hand. He made
no further resistance. The material of
his breakfast, consisting of beef, bacon
and milk, he admitted of having stolen
on Saturday night from the house of
farmer VIM. A. Roy, stating that be
asked the family for food, and as it
was refused he had nothing else to do
but take il. The prisoner was led
without delay TO the house of Mr..
Jackson, and as he entered the farm
yard Miss Jackson, the victim of the
foul outrage exclaimed,


THAT is TUE MAN.


She then burst into q violent fit of

to the office of her step brother, Elijah
G. Jackson, stating that she was afraid
the negro would get loose and kill her
as he threarened. He. glared at he- )
fiercely, but did not say word, and
his captors, seeing that no more could
be donein that quarter, summoned Mr.
Elijah Jackson, who committed the
scoundrel to Jail in Annapolis. Atths
squire's Office, Messrs. Cole, Gaylor
and Phelps tied the prisoners arms
with short rope and then marched
him off TO Odenton to meet the Annaps
oils train Several villagers followed
murmuring threats of vengeance, cut
the depot was reached in safety just as
the train was departing; The loud
cries of Cole and Gayior were, howev-
er, heard by the engineer who stopped
the train and backed up to await thsi-
coming. Then began


AN EXCITING SCENE. q.


All the villagers with the exception
of William Turner, Chas. Turner aao :
Charles Durham, had Jagged behind
on the road and were not present when
the prisoner reached the depot. The
three named had followed close, and
as the prisoner was put upoa the train
they rushed up with ropes IN their
hands and dragged him oil again. The
negro was now almost white with fear,
and appeared desperately eager to
board the train. He was assisted in
his efforts by Cole and Gaylor, but he
had no sooner regained his position on
the steps when the advocates of lynch
law agaia seized him, and prisoner and
avengers went


ROLLING DOWN THE STEEP EssBAEK-


MENT.


AS the party regained their feet at
the bottom Cole and Gaylor again Sc
cured their man and were about put
ting him on the train for the third
time, when Turner and company again
seized him, Durham was in the act
of passing rope around.,nis neck Wnen
the brakeman forced him to desist by y
pushing the muzzle of a revolver in his
face, Before Durham had time to re-
cover from the surprise the train NOV
off, and the prisoner stretched out on
his back in the baggage car was at last
en- route for Annapolis.

publican, referring to the successful
measures to land the perpetrator OF a
recent horrible outrage in this State
in Jail without lyDching, says: ""Our
ideas are rather mixed, however, by
the fact that at the same time the pull,
pits of Boston are ringing with de-
mands for lynch law. In Iowa they
attribute murder to the abolition Of
capital punishment. In Boston, wi ere
they have capital punishment, the
clergy think the gallows does not
work fast enough, and want to call in
the aid of the lamppcst. Ore thing is
certain; if there are laws atfiying capi


tai punishment for certain crimes,
they ought to he either executed or
repealed. The boy murderer of Mas.
sachusetts, Jesse Pomeroy, whose
crimes were unparalleled in cruelty
and tindishness, has had his death sen


tence commuted to imprisonment fol
life. The sentimentalism which &C
com plished this result has been follow
cd by the horrible murder of child In

Commissioner Lynch stated that the supplemental

Of the Board come from the late Secretary
mentioned, who is lobbying IN Albany against

The question as to the merging Of the parochial
and the public schools still remains without any
more light upon 1t than the HERALD has already
THROWN Arguments In favor OF this ret,cence are
urged on both SIDES The Commissioners OF Public
Schools continue to allege tnat they are not in a
position to speak on the subject for the reason
that the friends OF the parochial schools have not
yet stated explicitly what 1t is that they demand,
and, pesides committee OF conference has been
appointed, which is all that Vicar General Quin
has, SO far asked for The friends OF the parochial
schools afflrm, In their own behalf that 1t would
be imprudent to lay bare their plans until the
JOINT committee OF conference begins to hold its
meetings, and that, under the circumstances, the
Board OF Education has, IN oil courtesy, the right
to hear first what 1t is that the Catholics shall
ask to have conceded to them. In this way both
sides are placed for the present. much courteous
ness being the rule, ana the probability is
that nothing new shall transpre in regard to the
impending controversy until after Easter, when
vicar General Quinn and other pastors will have
been relieved from the instant and arduous pro-
fesslonal duties of Holy Week. Up to this time
the Vicar General has not named the gentlemen
who Will on his side form part OF the JOINT CON-


mlttee OF conference nor has day peen named


for the holding OF the first session.


WHAT PRESIDENT NELSON SAYS.


HERALD reporter yesterday called on Mr.
william H. Nelson, President OF the Board OF


Education in search OF some Information as to


how he himself personally stood on the question
| OF the proposed amalgamation. But Mr.. Nelson
| would say nothing beyond an excuse for his retl-
! cence, which he based on the ground OF a
proper courtesy toward Vicar General Quinn The
Vicar General, he added, had not yet sent to the
Board his specific demands, and until such time as
he presented them to the joint committee of
course 1t would not be decOrous the part Of the
School commissioners to discuss speculative or
imaginary concessions the one side or the
other. One thing certain was that the committee
from the Board OF Education would receive very
willingly AMI with great courtesy any PROPOSE
tions which might be presented to them lor con-
sideration by the Vicar General and his associates.
VIEWS OF COMMISSIONERS LYNCH.


The reporter also called on Mr. james Lynch,
whose name was attached to the communication
sent to the Board, and who, being president Of the
Irish Emigration Society, is an er o0fciO member
OF the Emigration Commission. Mr.. Lynch SAID
that the HERALD had in some OF it's
articles, explained pretty fully the state
of the question. But there was one
serious point that had not been touched upon 1t
was all very well, said Mr.. Lynch, for the school
Commissioners to talk about having all the chill
dren in the city, rich and poor. high and low, at
tend the public schools and receive the excellent
instruction therein impaired. 1t was true that
the secular instruction given In these schools was
excellent, but there was very serious difficulty
| in the way OF some thousands OF children being
enabled to take advantage OF IL. In the public
schools OF the city the children of some OF our


wealth.est citizens were receiving their early edu.
| nf
! classes were also receiving their education in
these schools, and all these children, male and
| female, were neatly dressed and knew
| not what it was TO want for anything.
! The children OF the parochia schools
were in the majority of cases OF poor parentage,
were poorly clad, and were more in the habit OF
knowing what it was to want than to nave their
wants supplied He would say boldly, Tor many
reasons we'll known to those who had the oppor-
tunity of knowing, that the parochia schools,
with or without the public moneys to aid them
were necessity, and under no circumstances
could they be dispensed WITH 1t was perfect
truth that both pupils and teachers OF the public
schools would turn up their noses a. the poor, i'll
dressed and unkempt child AS a member OF the
ST. Vincent de Paul's Society he had had ABUNDANT
means Of knowing this. 1t had been proved again
and again. He would not say that the ragged
child would be turned out Of the school by
either pupil teacher. but he would say to
a certainty that the little boys the little grl's
heart would be made to bleed, and that would be
the worst sort OF expulsion. The average at
tendance at the parochal schools was from 15, 900
to 90 900 daily. Put these children in the public
schools tomorrow, and you would find tnat
before three months several thousand chill
dren would have left the public schools and
have gone 10 private schools. He did not wish TO
be understood as saying that the public schools
were not worthy objects or pride to the city; ne
believed that they were, and he ala not think that
any form OF religion, under existing circum-
stances ought to be taught IN them. In fact. 1t
was not necessary that religion should be taught
in them. The children attending these SCHOOLS
had fathers and mothers. friends or relatives who
were 70 look after their religious training and
to watch over their morals. There was nome
influence constantly being exercised there, which
was certain to mould their young minds into the
right. Impressions and TO create aspirations Tor

The first engine in use by the company was an


old pumping affair procured from a French frig-
ate, which was supplied with water in buckets,


that period ante dating our water system. This


was used for several years, nntl an engine of
more modern build was obtained, the last serv-
ing them until the purchase OF their present ex-
celent steamer in 1863


The first engine house occupied by the COM
pany stood on the hito of Smith u Sons marble
yard, Market street above 9Th, and was two
story frame building From thence the COM
pany removed to Ninth and King, and afterwards


to Orange street above 10Th to the building now
occupied by the colored Odd Follows, remaining


there until the present edifce was built in 1853.
The Friendship Fire Co, in all this history, has


been most efficient organization lit has always
been ready in any emergency, prompt in its re-
eponses while in the active discharge Of its self
imposed duty (t was volunteer organization
from its start) there has been no company in

life. About four weeks ago, mulatto girl,
aged 10, who had been living for some time
as servant in the house of a farmer, two and
half miles from Verona, in Lee county,
left her service and went to Verona, where
she became house servant, in order to at
tend an evening school. She had been at
her new place week, when one day the
farmer, her former employer, accompanied
by his father and neighbor, all armed with
shot guns, appeared before the house. Two
of the men came in and demanded the girl,
saying she belonged to them. She refused
to 60 with them, and declared that she was
free, which was true, of course. They then
knocked her down, took her by the feet,
dragged her thus through the house, through
the yard, into the street, her clothing torn
and deranged in the struggle, and she
screaming for help, and-this was in open
daylight and in the presence of several men,
besides women and children-set her on a
horse and carried her off. When they got
her home two of them tied her to tree and
fogged her barred back with green withes
until the blood ran. Then they took her to
the house and chained her with trace
chain and paddock to the bed-post. The
next day she was turned to work. and
chained up again al night. After some
days she made her escape, and found refuge
with Southern man, the county superin-
tendent of education, who, after proper no.
tice, sent her to the United States District
Attorney. From the District Attorneys
lips, received the account of the outrage.
Now, cruelty and violence may and do hap
pen in any State. The part of the story
which seems most horrible to me is this: It
is in evidence before the District Attorney,
that the Mayor of Verona, who is it's justice
of the peace, heard the girls cries and saw
the struggle, and when asked why he did
not interfere himself, testified that he
thought it was none of his business; as he
knew that it was only negro girl. Several
other men testified that they stood in their
doors and saw the girl dragged by her feet
out into the road. 1t was none of their bus
mess either. Finally, related this tale to
Democratic judge of the Supreme Court
of the State. He replied that brutality was
found everywhere, North as well as South,
and l could not, with all my efforts, appar-
emily, make him understand that what filed
me with indignation and hopeless disgust
was not so much the act itself, but the fact
that an officer of the law and several citi-
zens could witness it unmoved-because it
was only negro girl. If it had been a
white girl, no doubt the Mayor would have
interfered, and the judge would have been
indignant. If the brutes who should NAL
treat white girl SO, had been negroes, the
country would have risen to lynch them, and
the papers all over Mississippi would have
yelled with fuzzy. 7. Herald."

United States by such debtor.


House bill relating to the punish
ment of the crime of manslaughter.


Debate was then resumed, and
Pease, of Mississippi, concluded his
argument commenced yesterday. He
that outrages were daily comm t.
ted in the South. The American
Senate and the American people
should become awakened to the fact
that the country was on the eve of
another revolution more fatal in its
results than the late rebellion. He
argued that crime was more frequent
in the South than the North and read
from statistics to show that such was
the case. He denied that white men
were ever punished in the South for
the murder of negroes. The same
spirit which pervaded the press
of the South in 1861 existed to-day
He knew there was a large element
in the South which did not subsc ibe
to these wild elements. The old Wing
party did not subscribe to them, but
that party was powerless. The same
old Democrats who brought on the
difficulty before were the men who
were leading editorial writer's to-day;
the men who were firing the Southern
heart to murder and assassinate, and
overthrow the Government of the
United States, if necessary. In eve
ry case where the treasury of q
Southern State had been plundered it
had been done by Democrats: MEM
bers of that party were in the scheme
some way. He argued that Miss ,ssip-
pi was the best reconstructed of the
insurrectionary States and every dol
lar of the State debt could be paid in
two years. In conclusion, he called
upon the Senator from Ohio CThur-
MANI, as leader of the Democratic
party. to say to the Democrats in the
South that the outrages there must
be stopped.


Thurman read from speech deliv-
cred by him in the Senate on the 18th
of January, 1871, where he condemn
ed anything like violence, and asked
the people of South to obey the laws.
He argued that the picture of the con-
! dltlon of Southern society could not
be drawn by newspaper clippings. If
| they were to be taken, picture of the
| condition of Northern society could
| be drawn which would make any man
| living north of the Potomac shudder.
| Thurman will conclude his speech
! tomorrow.


WASHINGTON, Jan 7-Noon-HoUsR
Tho Republican members in caucus
resolved to instruct the judiciary Com
mite to report the Civil Rights bill in
! regular order. This takes the control
| from Butler and slaves action off for
| two weeks. The best parliamentary
ans say that there is machinery to
push it over the 4th of March.
| Butler, of Massachusetts,, as a ques-
ton of privilege, called up the motion
made by him last session to reconsider
the vote by which the Civil Rights bill
was referred to the Judiciary Commit
tee. A point of order was raised. but
the Speaker decided on the authority
of that days journal of proceedings
that the right existed, and thereupon
the Democrats fell back upon the
policy of fllibustering, and the House
is now engaged in that business.


WASHINGTON, Jan. 27.-Night. The


words in order inserted IN the eau.


Gus action. was not understood by


many of the members. 1t appears the
Judiciary Committee had presented


their bill, and that motion to recon


slider was pending, which Blu Ter


Chairman of the Committee, could cal


up at any time This he did to-day il


order, as directed by the caucus.
The House has been fillibusterine


all day. and is still at it.


The Pen sion Committee will report


favorably on the bill to pension the


Mexican war veterans, of whom ther,


are 10000.


The bill over which the House ii


fillibustering, excludes the school anc
cemetery clauses.


ConklIn will follow Thurman on tn,


Louisiana question.


SENATE-Scott, of Pennsylvania


from the Committee on Claims, re
ported adversely on the bill to facili


tate and reduce the expense of takinf


testimony in behalf of claimants to bt


used before the Commissioners o.
Claims, and it was indefinitely post
poned. He said the objects of this


bill had been already supplied BY
! the House.


Patterson, of South Carolina, pre-


sented concurrent resolutions will
the General Assembly of that State
providing for an appropriation of one


hundred thousand dollars for the i'm
provement of Charleston harbor, which
were reported to the Committee on
! Commerce.


The Louisiana discussion was re-
sumed and Thurman occupied the


balance of the day. He reviewed a;
some length the circumstances attend
ing tie election of 1872. as well as the
last election, and read frequently from
| the report of the Senate committee in
regard to the frauds of the Lynch
Returning Board. He commented
upon the message of the President in
/ reply to the revolution of the 6th inst.
and said paper morefullof omissions
| of material facts never emanated from
| the Chief Magistrate of this country.
| He srgued that the dispatched Of
| Sheridan we're one-sided and did not
| tell the whole truth. He replied to
the charges of Southern outrag es. and
| said great majority of the homicides
| in the South were committed by blacks
upon blacks and were not by whites
upon blacks, as had been charged.
In conclusion, he said it was a bad
thing to assassinate a man, but a worse
thing to assassinate the Constitution
of State; these acts of the military
in Louisiana have driven a dagger to
the heart of free institutions in this
country."

son from Jail and lynched him will probably
be punished by the judicial authorities of the
State. These lynching outrages are by far
too common in our Western States, and tend
to bring the civilization of this country into
disrepute In the case of Woodson there
seems to have been no good reason for the
violent action of the mob. The man was in
the hands of the proper authorities and was
about to be tried by the proper tribunal for
crime, it is alleged, he had confessed 1t is
not pretended that there was any danger of
his escaping, and the only reason why the
mob interfered was that they desired his i'm
mediate execution. Like band of savages,
they were thirsting for the blood of their
prisoner, and were unwilling to wait until
the formalities of the law could be carried
out. Such a state of public feeling is dis
graceful to community, and the excesses
arising from it exercise on the public mind
of the country demoralizing influence. 1t
is said that the most prominent men in
Rutherford county were engaged in the latest
lynching outrage. This is an additional
reason why they should be punished, for it
is to this class that we look for an example of
obedience to the laws and if the intelligent
and respectable classes set the laws at def
ance, what can be expected from the mob
We hope, therefore, that the judicial authori-
ties of the State will punish promptly
and severely every one who can be shown to
have aided or abetted the killing Of Jesse
Woodson."

 A day or two since we met and con- versed with one of these gentry. That cur readers may know something of the habits and nature of the professional tramp, we give his statement as it came from his lips.

lBY rkLEaRAPH TO THB TRBUSEl


WASHINGTON, Feb ""A week ago this morning
Gen. Butler called up his motion to reconsider the
vote by which the Civil Rights bill was recon-
mitted to the Judiciary Committee, and to-
day he got vote on that motion under
the operation of now rule. The proceed
ings until the bill fairly IN the
House were devoid of interest. Then Gen. Butter
allowed q great number of amendments to be read,
after which he took the floor and made short
speech in favor Of the bill. 1t one of his mpas
stoned efforts. frequently interrupted by Ques-
tions from the Democrats, and urging the
old arguments for the passage OF the bill
Just as he closed remarkable scene occurred
between him and Mr. Mclean of Texas, who seemed
to be in a very excited condition and misunderstood
O remark which Gen. Butler had made. Mr.
Nibaek had asked Gen. Butler If he
thought people OF Southern States were
capable of self government provided some
of his assertions true. Gen. Butler replied that
if murderers and horse thieves night-riders, and
men in uniform could not be restrained by the peo-
pie the United States ought to interfere. Mclean,
who owing to the confusion. did not hear Gen. But
ler's qualifications, asked if he meant to say that
the people Of the South are murderers and horse
thieves.


""NO! No!"" cried Gen. Butler.


Because"" added Mr.. Mclean in a low tone as he
took his seat. ""You are the only murderer l know
Of on this floor; you murdered man in New
Orleans""


This remark Gen. Butler did not hear, but when
some one reported it TO hmbe sprang out of his seat
and sald that the time had passed when such ruff
Ganly foolish and ungentlemanly language would
move any one. He af5erward declared that so far
from taking any ofense at reference TO his hanging
man in New Orleans he glored in it, and only
wished that he had hanged a great many more Mr.
Mclean afterwards withdrew his Objectionable
language. but it was some time before the excite
ment on the floor subsidized After this the discus
sion on Civil Rights bill began in earnest
and continued with exceptionof a recess for dinner,
until about 10 O'Clock this evening. The first speech
was made by Lynch. one of the coIored men from
Mississippi. and would have done credit to any mem
Der on the floor. The voting amendments will
begin at O'Clock tomorrow"

Incendtarism in Wilmington.


A most malicious and fendish attempt was
made by incendiaries to destroy property, in
Wilmington, last Saturday night. Fires were
started in four different places (the Gazette
says nine) and but for the strenuous efforts of
the iremen, an extensive and disastrous con-
fagration would have been caused The first
fire, which broke ont about 10 o'clock, P.
NJ, was in the stable of W. Morrow, on
French street, which was destroyed together
with its contents; loss about 81 ,OOO About
one O'Clock, A. NJ, a second fire was dis
covered in The stables occupied by Downy &
Cooper, owned by Col. Fl. S. McComb, which
were destroyed, several adjoining frame
buildings narrowly escaping. A fine horse
was burned to death. The loss to Messrs.
Downy l. Cooper was about $500. A short
time after carpenter shop was fred, but was
saved from destruction. Between and 4
o'clock, the stables of Jacob Stuck, Walnut
above 7th, were fired. Two horses in this
stable were so badly burned, that one had to
be killed next morning, and the other was
badly injured. Policeman Bacon says he saw
a man running away from this building just
as the fire started, and fired two shots at him,
but unfortunately did not bring him down.


The Wilmington papers denounce these
fires as deliberate attempt to destroy the
city. Could they be caught, human ingenuity
would be taxed to the utmost, to invent pun
ishment severe enough for such devils and
their crime."

 Washington, May 27.-General Rufus In- ! gals has been ordered to act as Quartermas- ter General during the absence of General Nj. c. Meigs in Europe on special service. ! Boston, May 27.-Dow's drug store, on Washington street, was the scene of ter rife explosion last night. The building was completely demolished. Four persons were killed outright, three were seriously wound ed and twenty-u received slight injuries. The cause of the explosion is unknown.

 New York, May 29.-Judge Porter con- cluded his argument in the Beeche.-Ti'ton case yesterday and Vim. M Evarts commen- ced bis address to the jury today.

 Philadelphia, May 27. In the Republican State Convention yesterday, Gen. John F. Hartranft was renominated for Governor. A resolution repudiating the third-term idea was adopted.

 Springfield, Mass, May 2S.-Ths French Catholic Church, at South Holyoke, took fire last evening, during the holding of yes per service. There were about 700 people in the edifice at the time the flames caught in the altar decorations The people in the body of the church rushed out, many being crushed and smothered. Those in the gal leries jumped down or from the windows, others ran to and fro frantically, and at last perished by fire, and many fell and were trampled to death in the narrow stairways by those who were behind. Several entire families perished. So rapid was the destruc- tion that all was over within l5 minutes.

 Later.-The bodies of 50 of the people burned to death in the church at Holyoke, last night, have been identified in addition to those of l5 or % others that were remov- ed to their homes by friends. Nearly 70 have died and some 40 more are horribly burned or otherwise injured. The priests did all they could to save the people, in the brief time of the disaster, but little could be done. The hero of the dreadful affair was J. Lynch, brave fireman, who was the first to respond to the alarm. The scene when he reached the burning building was appall ing. Wedged tight and immovable in the doorways was dense mass of humanity; none of the people being able to stand up right from the terrible pressure of the crowd behind while upon and over them a sheet of fire rolled like wave, straming out far into the open air.

 Portland, Me, May 29-A fire broke out at St. Johns, N. B., yesterday morning, de- stroying some 75 building. The loss is up- wards of quarter of million dollars.

 Springfield, Mass, May 29.-The fire in the French Catholic church at South Holy oke resulted in the death of 7l persons, while 9 more are fatally burned and ? are more or less seriously injured. Fiity-fve of the dead are women.

 Memphis, May 29.-The famous Confeder ate cavalry leader, Gen. Forrest, in letter accepting an invitation from the memorial committee breathes very peaceful spirit. He wants the ex-soldiers to forget the ami mosities of the late war and to become one people."

of Education ordered a change of the
principal text books used in the pub
lie schools. MCGUFFY's readers
which have been in use for the last
four years are to be thrown out togive
place to series of readers got up by
BANCROFT & Co., publishing house
in San Francisco. MoNTEITH's geog-
raphy which has been in use six years
is substituted by CoRNELL's. PAYsoN,
DUNToN q SoRIBNER's system of
penmanship is thrown out and the
Spencerian system adopted. What
other changes have been made we are
not informed, but the changes known
to be made are sufficient to warrant
the belief that the book dealers have
secured control over majority of the
State Board of Education. The
changes we have enumerated
will cost the people of the State of
California at least $5OO,000. The Sac
ramento Union estimates that the
change of readers alone will cost those
who purchase school books $3l8,0O0.
How paltry and flimsy We're the ex-
cuses of the Board for imposing this
heavy tax on the people may he seen
from the statement of DENMAN of San
Francisco, who said he was not so
much opposed to McGUFFEY's readers.
as he was to the house that furnished
them (WTLsoN, HrNKLE & Co. Of Gin
cinnati). In order that the people
may know who have so boldly defied
them and saddled such an enormous
tax on the parents and guardians of
children, we give the vote on the
changing of readers:

was requested to address the graduates. His

wasted by years and inarmity, kindled with
it's former fire, and the veteran spiritual and

other alumni present seemed highly gratifed
at the unusual gathering. He besougbt the
graduates to hold high and clear above their
| heads the banner of freedom of their country
and of religion. Il stand here to-day"" he
continued, the representative of former
generation. The little village of Emmittsburg,
over there, produced one. The State of Mary
land was the first to proclaim political and
religious freedom, and God grant she may be
the last to ignore those principles which were
the foundation of her glory, and which have
always been inculcated at this institution. Do
| you carry forward the high trust conided to

| all parts of your couHtry-the suffering South
and the teeming West and the rich North-in

petual.""

of inspiration, to which more than anything
else in the world am indebted for what 1 was,
for what am, and what with Gods help may
be in days to come. Words fail me to express
the delight 1 enjoy in being here and meeting
classmates and friends on this holy ground."

The Lee Trial.",,"BEAVER, Utah, July 22d.-The jury
in the Lee trial has been finally sworn
in. 1t consists of eight Mormons and
four Gentiles. Five officers have been
sworn in to take charge of them. The
first witness will be called this morn
ing, and the excitement is intense.
The defense say they care little how
the case goes, relying on an appeal to
the Supreme Court on two points.
First-the failure to endorse the pre-
senting of the indictment in Court.
Second-the July term of the Court is
illegal. #&


The Boys have to Put UP.


CHICAGO, July 23.-A Washington
special says the Congressional Com
mittee has collected thousands of dol
lars in the shape of political assess
ments of the Committee upon the
ground that it has no legal existence.
1t was appointed by the Forty-Third
Congress and no longer exists. Until
the meeting of the Forty-Fourth Con-
gress, and another appointment by it,
there will be no such thing as legal
committee. The men who are at
present robbing clerks in the name of
the Republican Party are no more au-
thorized to do what they do than or
dinary highwaymen. The assessors
have, as yet, avoided pressing those
who object to their demands. The ex-
posures in relation to the standing of
the Committee make them fearful
that good honest prosecution against
them by men who had nothing Off
cially would land them in the peniten-
tiary.


The Times on a Revival Of Business.


NEW YORK, July s23.-The Times,
commenting on the grain excitement
in England, says there is no doubt but
that the present aspect of the cereal
crops in England and on the continent
Is favorable to an increased demand
for the American products and it is
natural to look forward to the revival
of trade as a legitimate consequence.
If this demand will tend to such a re-
vival there is no question but it is too
soon yet to define with any degree of
certainty how far its influence will ex-
tend, or how it will be modified by
other circumstances. A healthy and
steady demand for our cereals abroad
will be an immense benefit to the
whole country, and it is quite possible
to destroy considerable part of this
benefit by hasty and incautious spec
ulative transactions. a&f@


Cuba Attracting Attention.


WASHINGTON, July 23.-There were
some important conversations, at the
Cabinet session on Wednesday, rela.
tive to the condition of affairs in Cuba
and the duty of the United States in
the premises about which the Presi-
dent and members of the Cabinet re-
fuse to say much. This Cabinet
meeting gives general significance to
O double loaded editorial in the M
tionat Republican this morning, head
ed ""Shall Cuba be Free"" referring to
the generous policy of this govern.
ment, the treaty and the efforts OF
Spain to put down the rebellion. The
end is not near however.


The freedom loving people of this
country have been virtually forced to
MAINTAIN the armies which have been
sent into the field in the vain endeav-
or to overcome the rebellion. In 9TH
er words, free Americans have been
compelled to pay tribute to the per-
petuation Of slavery in Cuba. Mean
while, immunity from adequate pun
ishment, for numberless infringe
ments OF international law, and viola
tions of the laws of civilized warefare.
has emboldened the Spaniards to as
sumo an impudent disregard of the
plainest demands of diplomatic inter-
course.

Gold I'm New York.


NEW YORK, July 23d.-There was a
heavy feeling developed in gold on the
Exchange this morning and the first
sales were at 1i2s, and Ii2S at the close
last evening. After this a steady de-
cline ensued until the price reached
111a. There was some excitement
among spectators, but no failures
have been announced, although sew
eral operators are said to be crippled
severely. Outside dealers, who have
been buying gold since it declined to
| 1l3, hoping for reaction, are the
principal losers. The highest price to-
| day was 112k, at opening and the low
est 111a, which was made specially be-
fore noon. About o'clock gold be-
gan to recover from these low quota
tions, and advanced from 111sto 1923,
which was the closing price. ...s
Important Land Decision.
WASHINGTON, July 23d.-The Sec-
retary of the Interior has reversed the
decision of the Commissioner of the
General Land Office in the case of
Robert NJ Stewart VS.. the Western
Pacific Railroad Company, involving
land within the claimed limits of the
Magnetamas Mexican grant, rejected
by the Supreme Court in 1865, after
the withdrawal for the railroad COM
pany on map of it's general route, but
prior to its definite location. Stewart
settled in 1855, prior to the passage of
the railroad act. The Secretary fol-
lows his late decision in the case of
Dallingham ct al, holding that the
act of March 80, 1878, granting rights
to settlers on rejected foreign grants,
had no reference to California, but
that lands in that State are governed
by special act subsequently passed
on the same day, extending the pre-
emption laws to California, by which
pre-emption rights are expressly eX-
cluded from attaching in favor of set
tiers upon the lands held or claimed
under any foreign grant or title.
Stewards settlement was therefore a
mere possessory interest, giving him
no legal right at the date of withdraw
al for the purpose of the railroad, and
thus excluded from legal settlement.
The decision, although it will work
hardship to many settlers, is in har-
mony with the entire current of the
decisions of the Supreme Court of CAL
ifornia and the United States and the
u. s. Circuit Court of that District,
and, unless oyerruled by the Supreme
Court of the United States, where, we
understand, the appeal of the case is
pending, must be regarded as settled
law in the case.

ing tendencies at work in our politics. In
the first place the selection of Vice President
Wilson to preside over the Convention was q
mark Of coldness toward President Grant.
Mr.. Wilson has, for long time, made no
secret of his disapprobation of the policy OF
the President. He has been again and again
assailed and sneered at by the republican or
1 gan at Washington, and treated with marked
anrespect by every republican newspaper in
the country which lQxuyiates IN the glover Of
/ government advertising. To make him
the President of the Convention was a
greater personal affront to President
Grant than the paying of a similar
honor to Mr.. Curtis at Saratoga, be-
cause Mr.. Curtis difference with the admin
istration has receded into the past, whereas
Vice President Wilson has recently been
| giving public expression to his lack of conf
dence in the President. The speech of Mr.
Wilson on taking the chair has no tendency
to conciliate General Grant Trust not,
gentlemen"" he said, ''to party discipline
for it has failed you trust not to official
patronage, for it has weighted you down in
the race"" This is plain accusation that
the President has injured the party in Massa-
chusetts by appointing unfit men to Office.
Distrust of President Grant is manifest in
other proceedings of the Convention. Mr.
Hoar, former Attorney General, made pro-
posal to confer on Mr.. Wilson, the President
of the Convention, the appointment Of
one-half the members of the State
Committee, and in a speech on this
resolution Mr.. Hoar said, ""The party is
in crisis and must have new departure Z""
Considering the nature of his motion, he
evidently meant a new departure in the di-
rection pointed out by Mr.. Wilson-that is
to say, in an anti Grant direction. But Mr..
Hoar did not leave this mere inference He
proceeded to say that if he could he would
read an article entitled ga New Departure, e""
written by the President of the Convention.
because that advice was slighted, said Mr..
Hoar 'the party stands where it does to-
day."" His proposition to confer on Mr.. Will
son the power to appoint one-half the men,
bers of the State Committee was carried-a
mark of confidence in the Vice President
which the supporters of General Grant must
swallow and digest if they can.


The platform also cast reflections on the
President, though softened by a formal en-
comium Civil service reform was strongly
indorsed in spite of President Grants be-
trayal of the cause. On the third term ques-
ton the Massachusetts Convention scorned
the ridiculous pretence of their brethren in
New York that General Grant had settled it
by refusing to be candidate. The Massa-
chusetts Convention says explicitly, without
any reference to his letter, that sound reason,
as well as uniform usage and the example Of
Washington, forbids Presidential tenure
beyond second term-an implied condemna-
ton of General Grants letter. which con-
tended that the people have as perfect right
to elect the same President thrice as once.
On the currency question the plat
form is sound and satisfactory but it says
nothing quite so piquant as the passage in
Vice President Wilson's speech, where he
says eve cannot as Americans, take pride
in the singular fact that a stray note from an
unknown bank in one of the British Prov
inces can be sold in State street for pre-
MUM of more than twelve per cent over one
of our legal tender notes, with all the wealth
of forty millions of people behind it.


Not the least significant feature of the pro-
ceedings was the vote for Mr.. Charles Fran
els Adams, which rose on the last ballot but
one to 260. Mr.. Adams has long been
out of sympathy, not only with Presi-
dent Grants administration, but with
the republican party. He is said to
have voted last year for Governor CASTOR.
Every member of the Convention who voted
for him indorsed Mr.. Hoar's idea of the
necessity of ''a new departure, if the repub-
lican party is to be saved. Mr.. Rice the
successful candidate, is gentleman Of high
social standing, a merchant and q graduate
of Harvard College. But the laboring
masses of Massachusetts think him Boston
aristocrat, and his election may be deemed
doubtful against the very popular democratic
ticket 1t is certain that his nomination is
not in pursuance of 'the new departure""
which ex-Attorney General Hoar and Vice
President Wilson, the two ablest members of
the Convention, thought necessary for the
success of the party.

One stormy night, not far from ii clock, l
sat at my desk-and for a wonder idle. The
wires had not called for some time, and was
leaning back in my chair listening to the wind
outside and rejecting upon the loneliness of
my situation. The eastern train had crossed
the river moro than an hour ago all the depot
officials had gone off home, and so far as
knew | was entirely alone in the vast building.
Finally tired of thinking, picked up the
evening paper and glanced listlsssly over its
coluwna Among other things read the de-
tailed account of fearful tragedy that had oc.
cured fifty miles up the river on the previous
night. Three raftsmen, well known ss deape-
rate characters in that vicinity, had entered the
cottage OF one Matthews, farmer living in an
isolated spot-had butshered the farmer and
his children, terribly maltreated his wife, and
then departed as they came, having taken with
than whatever pluRder was handy. What in
terestea me most was full description, for
purposes of Identification, of the chief of the
vilainOuS trio Tim Lynch. Here it is:


$500 reward will be paid for information
leading to the capture, dead or alive, of Tim
Lynch, the ringleader of the Matthews tragedy.
Lynch is remarkably large man, six feet four
inches IN height, very heavy, and broad across
the shoulders. Eyes greenish gray, with deep
scar over the right one. Hair wiry, black, anC
beard of same color. When first seen he wal
drsssed 10 black Kossuth hat, faded army over
coat, pants ct grey jean, and heavy boots. Tbs
above reward will be paid to any one furnish

save enough to marry in the spring. Five |
hundred dollars would do me a great deal of
good just now-to say nothing of the ecldt of
the thing. But how was it to be accomplished |
Here was l alone in the depot with man big |
enough to whip his weight in such little men
as | was several times over. Any attempt to
secure him single handed was not to lie tho t

the connection between the two offices had been
cut for repairs. 1t was seldom used at any
time of course. But what of that? Il was
only question Of few seconds more time.
All these thoughts went through my mind
with the rapidity of lightning as l went to the
battery. Lynch regarded me from the corner
of his uncovered eye with a suspicion that
made me shake in my shoes. As | sat down
he arose and came to my side.

voice trembled little, but was still unmoved
in my resolution, as l replied:


Never fear, sir; I'll tell him all about the


stock. He muttsrsd something to himself,


and still remained standing over me.


You have heard perhaps how much character

Virginia City Items.


VIRGINIA CITY, New, Sept. 27th.-
Early yesterday morning several large
| show windows on G street were de-
faced with cuts done by diamond.
The principal damage done was on
| the elegant show window of Frede-
ricks' jewelry establishment, which
were terribly defaced with lot of bill
lingsgate. The windows are valued
at 500 each. Two men, named Cum
Minis and Anderson, have been arrest
ed on suspicion of having committed
the outrage.


About 2 O'Clock this afternoon wo-
man named Medley walked into the
Delta saloon, on G street, and forcing
her way through the crowd at the bar,
drew out a pistol and attempted to
shoot James w. Orndorf, one of the
proprietors. Her arm was arrested by
q bystander before she pulled the trig-
GER and she was given into the GUS
tody of a police officer. Jealousy is
supposed to be the cause.


A miner named David L. Jones was
caved upon in the Consolidated Vir-
ginia mine at 2 o'clock yesterday
morning. A large piece of rock fell
upon him, striking his right leg above
the ankle, breaking both bones and
fracturing the large one very badly."

IN THE SMUGGLING CASE OF THE U. 3. vs. VIM


H. ELLEo0oD.


The United States Court resumed the case oil
the U. S Us. VIM. H. Elegood, indicted fol
ueging, and Capt. Ford Lubker remained OF
the stand, testifying that he did not see the ac
cnsed in the boat, but Joshua Ellegood.


On his cross examination Capt. Lubker did
not vary his statements from his examination IN
chief. He admitted slight acquaintance witt
Wni crosby, but denied the expression of Il de
termination to convict him aud his brother be.
cause they were from Massachusetts,. He stated
further, however, that when he passed Capt,
Williams boat on the night the smuggling .wat
alleged to have been done that there was q
small quantity of bags or old sail i'll it, it might
have been rope or chain of spun yarn used to
lower the material into the boat. Joshua Ellie
good had on dark coat buttoned up, and hir
hat was slouched down over his face. Don't
know how Crosby was dressed.


John L. Lockwood testified to being one OF
the men who manned Captain Lubkers boat
that evening, and varied but little from the
Captains story, except that he did not see any
lowering done from the bark to the boat and
was unable to give relative distances with the
same accuracy.


Levin Jenkins testified that he was keeper
of the Breakwater light that he remembered
the time the Masonic was laying at the Break
water, and that on the night of the 1st of June
he saw a boat going to the bark with two men III
1T when first saw it the boat was approaching
the light house thought it was the bark's boat
coming for some assistance; the boat turned
then towards the bark and run under her bow
saw the boats bow project beyond the bark's
stern; l saw it was not the bark's boat
but believed it to be the Rescue, which
| have often seen before don't know
who the men were in the boat; did not see any
thing lowered, but saw man come along the
bark's deck as the boat came under and after.
wards saw more heads passing along the deck
saw the boat afterwards leave the bark and &c
towards shore; | saw Crosby's bumboat about
ll1S o'clock the same night coming down the
bay and pass through the gap way; don't know
what was the Mdsonic's cargo; think Lubker's
boat was at the Breakwater at this time.


Capt VIM. Williams testified to tying up his
Loaf ON the night of June 2nd at 10 o'clock, and
next morning finding that she had been used,
there beng tracks aronnd her and brown sugar
scattered over the thwarts; saw VIM. Crosby
and VIM. II. Ellegood driving away from Ellie
goods house that morning, between and
o'clock; saw Alton Crosby on the beach that
morning was on the bark the Sunday previous
and saw bbs of sugar open on the forecastle;the
sugar was similar i'll color to that found i'll my
boat


Cross. examined my boat has been taken be-
fore without my knowledge never offered sam
pies of sugar for sale to VIM. Ellegood my boat
carries about ton have carried sugar in her
for Mr.. Maull.


Levi b. Lynch sworn Live ut Lewes went





about my gill net when finished thought
would go down tile beach and sec who else had
nets out when near Ellegoods house, and be-
tween it and the pike, / saw a boat at the
beach | thought it was Capt Williams boat /;
there were three or four around then
believed them to be the Ellegood boys and the
Crosby boys have had no reason to think other
wise since | started to 90 down to the boat but
changed my mind they had something in sacks
and were taking them out and placing them on
the beach don I know whether they took out
all the sacks or not did not zee any more Of
them that night.


Cross-examined thought they were the
EllegoOd and Crosby boys, but would not like to
swear to it.


Capt. Lyons testified that he was inspector OF
Customs at Lewes and as such made out the
Wdsonics manifest giving one to the Captain
and forwarding the duplicate to the port of des-
tnation New York.


J. v. Vauarmsdale testified that he was inspec-
tor of customs in the n. y. custom house that
tlie Masonic arrived there on the 9th, and he
produced the duplicate manifest which Capt.
Lyons recognized as the one he sent.


William Lingo testified that he was store
keeper at Georgetown that ill the early part of
June, Ellegood and one of the Crosby boys went
to his store and offered to sell some brown sugar
Tor or cents pound told me he was selling
for Crosby, the man with him ; said the sugar
came from on board q vessel there was a sam
pie left at the store but | was not there then /;
thcv said they had about barrels.


Francis Page, N. Y. Custom House officer,
testified that the manifest of the bark called for
one hid more of sugar than was landed there.


The prosecution then rested the case, and Mr..
Harrington, for the defense, asked the Court to
direct the jury to bring i'll verdict for the de-
feudant on the grounds that the government had
utterly failed to substantiate any of the counts
in the indictment that there was no sugar
shown to be brought in that whatever goods
were brought in they were not shown to be such
as should be invoiced that supposing the facts
Ill proved the offense was smuggling, and not
All Importation as laid in the indictment; and that
the whole matter was not shown to be within this
district. After considerable argument it was
agreed that these points should be reserved, and
the defense 60 on with their testimony, and in
case of verdict against the defendent the court
would hear argument upon the ret erved matter,


Court then adjourned until l01s to-day.


During the afternoon the Grand Jury finished
their business and discharged with the
thanks of the Court. The following indictments
were found and continued until next term of
Court Illegal voting IN violation of the En-
forcement aci-James Ellis, James Ii. Bennett ;

THIS MORNINGS PROCEEDINGS.


Judge Bradford, this morning, concluded to
deliver an opinion on the law questions raised
Yesterday, rather than to reserve
them until after the verdict. He held indictment
to the jury ON four of the counts. but that no
conviction could be had on the 9th count, charg
ing the assisstng in the sale of the sugar, as
no sale was pro we'd. He also overruled the 9th
er points,


Mr.. Harrington took exception."

The entertainment at Hallowell, given by the

day and Wednesday, March 30th and 3lst, was
far above the average, and for originality, wit
and good solid fun has scarcely been surpassed in
our city.

quick-witted ""Pat"", or the clustering, impulsive
""Major"" admirably acted by Melvin, the genteel
lover Livingstone"" Mr.. Moore, Laura the
sweet and beautiful heroine, Miss Scanlan and
Miss Breen as Nancy, all served to make the
drama one Of the best ever seen upon our stage.
Master Charles O'Brien in his Song and Dance
specialties, was quite equal to many older and
much praised artists.


Miss Thompson and Mr.. Cumiskey, in their
recitatons, were well received, and little Miss
Lynch in her song Buy a Broom"" looked and
sang splerdidly and dcscrvedly received hearty


Mr.. Will Rowse of Augusta, in his character
song, 1.-THE Old Home aint what 1t used to be,
gave vivid impersonation OF the old plantation
darkey, and was greeted by hearty rounds of ap-
plause.


Mr.. j. E. Knight, in his Banjo Solo, Stump
Speech, &C., was simply immense. This business
was entirely new and original and surpassed any
thing we have ever seen in this line.


The entertainment was brought to close the
first night by the ""Haunted House"" in which
Messers. Melvin and knight took parts; and or
the second 'srrouble in the Photograph Gallery
by Melvin, knight and Foote, completely took
the house by storm; and SO very happily ended one
OF the richest treats our citizens have ever en-
joyed.


Thanks to Messrs. Jewell Simmons and vii

admirably managed and the enjoyment of the au.

which these gentlemen performed their duties.

Aberdeen Examiner Y The drouth
of 1874, that proved SO disastrous to
the corn and cotton crops, Of this region,
set in on the 3rd Of May, and lasted
until the 24th of June. It's hardly
reasonable to anticipate a similar season
in 1875, but should it come it will find
our farmers better prepared for it than
ever before.


Aberdeen Republican The crop
prospect in Monroe county, compared
with the last few years, is fattering.
The soil is generally well prepared,
and a good stand of corn and cotton is
the result. The late heavy rains and
hail have damaged crops some, but
theprospectis very encouraging. Now
is the time to work.


Canton Mail: Still the gratifying
news comes to us from all parts Of our
that farm work is progressing
favorably. Our county friends are
every possible hour from
rise to set of sun in getting their crops
IN the ground or under cultivation.
The young corn, we are told, is doing
we'll, and then there is SO much of it.


Enterprise Courier: Deputy Sheriff
Lowry gives us the rather startling in
that the smallpox has broken

negroes, a number Of whom have

Carrollton Conservative: We no
iced, on recent trip to the lower
'art of the county, that the old fields
orth Of Cola have been fenced in,
flowed and planted in corn. The
and mentioned has not been in cult
alton since the war, and the fact that
! and otherlarge tracts of similar land,
the county, are now being
lied can be taken as a cheering sign
f the future prosperity of our people.


Aberdeen Examiner: The farmers

THE INVESTIGATION.

The MysterU of the Sir Dollars


Explained.",,"TEMPORARILY APPRoPRIATES THE
LITTLE MONEY Mr.. HYDE REPREsEN-
TED BY CoUNsEL-A TILT BETWEEN
JUDGE PICKELs AND COUNSEL, ANDA
VICTORY FOR THE JUDoE- FUHTHER
TESTIMONY.
The great investigating COMMITTEES
resumed its sessions in the City Coun.
Gil chamber, last evening, Mr.. Adams
still being absent.


Chief Engineer Hyde was again pre-.
sent, but on this occasion was repre-
senlcd by his counsel, L. @. Bradford,
Jr., Esq,


The cross examination OF Mr.. James
Dandy was resumed and the witness
further testified as follows:


gave Mr. Hyde the six dollars on
Saturday, and the second Friday after
he told me he had bought cigars with
the money; / did not then know how
the discrepancy occurred between the
amount drawn from bank and the
amount of the pay roll, and only ascer-
tained it eight or ten hours ago.


Here Counsel asked witness in what
light he regarded Mr.. Hyde's action in
relation TO the six dollars. Witness
declined to answer, and Mr.. Pickles
sustained him in his refusal.


Mr.. Bradford thought the question
was proper one; if witness regarded
Mr.. Hyde's action as questionable or
dishonest, it was his duty at the timo
to make the fact known to tho proper
authorities, otherwise he would not be
doing his duty. lie deemed the charges
against Mr.. Hyde the result Of politi-
cal conspiracy, and If he was not al
lowed to attack the credibility of a
witness in his efforts to disprove these
charges, the investigation was mere
farce,


Mr.. Pickles said it was Mr.. Danby,s
duty to turn the surplus six dollars
over to his superior officer, Mr.. Hyde,
aud not TO inquire what he did with it
He then ruled the question out Of or
der.


Nj Bradford appealed from the ru
hing.


Messrs. Pickles and Under cod still
objected to the question.


Mr.. Lynch was satisfied tn allow the
witness to answer the question or not,
Us he saw fit; he would rather, how
ever, see the witness evidence rebut-
ted by direct testimony than by ques-
tions attacking his credibility Mr..





McMenamin thought likewise.


Mr.. Pickles ruling was sustained.


Mr.. Danby's examination resumed
After Mr.. Hyde said he bought cigars
with the six dollars he did not say he
bad placed that amount in tho bank
account; | paid or all the men on the
pay roll whom it was my duty to pay
was very careful to verify the
amounts paid to the men with the pay
roll.


Witness was here shown page OF
the pay roll book, and asked If he knew
it to be correct; he said not as he saw
all alteration on il. He was next shown
copy of petition sent to him by
Council, asking an examination into
Irregularities in tho Department, which
he acknowledged and said he had NO
intention or desire to withdraw 1t. He
SAID Dir. Hyde held him responsible
for certain money, which fact alone
induced him to send the petition to
Council.


/ did not know at the time l; sent
my petition that Mr.. Hawkins had sent
one; | asked Mr.. Candy for an investi'
CATION before petitioned Council, but
he refused it; have heard no declara
tion made by persons connected with
the reservoir relative to the removal OF
Mr., Hyde; never made any request
or suggestions to any person relative
10 such change; have never heard
any such suggestions made.


The pay roll for the week ending
April 18th was here produced, and Mr.
Dandy made the following statement
in reference to it;


l went to the Clerks Office, this
morning, and examined the check
book, and on the stub marked April
10th, noticed a mistake in the figures
the pay roll of the Water Department
was footed up &l76.12 with $36 charg
ed to the reservoir; l went TO the
Treasurer's office and got tho pay roll
fsr the Water Department for the
week ending April 18th; l found the
column was added up inside with tho
item of $50 included, making tota
of SIG. 10; on the outside it was writ
ten s148.12, with the $50 added, max
ing total of $1S6. IL; l saw here wa
where the mistake of S6 occurred.


Dir. VIM. Nj, Candy here stated thai
the mistake occurred by wrong ad
ding up of the pay roll by him.


Charles Burton. Jr., examined-An
Registrar in the Water Department
Mr.. Hyde did not pay me the SO sur
plus money; he told me he had spen
1t but its equivalent was always read,
for the city or whoever 1t belonged to
afterwards asked him how they mad
out with the pay roll, and he said the,
were in SO dollars; Mr.. Hyde made n
secresy about this matter; told hin
would look over the books and sc
where the mistake occurred; he sal
he did not know who the money be
longed to. Here another discussion
arose over the same question whicl
was objected to in Mr.. Danby's cross
examination. The question was agai
ruled out.


Henry G, Mahaffy examined-I ha,

by MIR. Hyde, which was said to hav

14_1875-08-05_p4_sn87056600_00202191575_1875080501_0272,The Indiana State sentinel.,01,1875-08-05,p4,,,"Andrew Johnson, the seventeenth presi-
dent of the United States, is dead. No man
OF his time was more thoroughly hated or
more bitterly abused, and no man was ever


mora completely forgiven by bis enemies.
The nation will bend with honest admira-
ton and sincere regret over the bier Of the
man whom its representatives impeached.


Elsewhere the story of his life is
told, and from the bold and startling record
of his career, the character of the man
may be read distinctly. And first, let it be
said that johnson and his life were pecu-


lisrly American-racy Of the soil. In the
story of Lincoln himself there is not more
of strange romance, and in the character Of
Lincoln thore was not more vividly ex-
emplified a type of strong native
manhood. The two presidents were
different in many things, but in the
rare good fortune, by which they both ad-


vanced from poverty and ignorance to the
control of great nation they were alike.
Perhaps Johnson's ruling passion was


mbition, which is great virtue under repub-


lican institutions so long as it aims at the
acquisition of power and glory within


the law and by legitimate means,
but is willing to suffer obloquy
and failure rather than trsnsgress


the law. 1t was this intense ambition


which first led Johnson to seek for educa-


ton, learning to read when tailor's sp-


prentice, acquiring writing and knowledge


OF arithmetic from hiswife, afterwards ming
ling in debate with the students ofGreenville


College, and finally plunging into political


strife. Such gallant struggle upward Is good
to contemplate; and the peculisrity of
the advance is that 1t is made,


not by crime or grand achieve
ment, as In the case of a Napoleon


or Cromwell, but by gradual and natural


growth. No wonder that the late president


was proud of his career and fond of allud-
ing to it! He might well have adopted the


words of Burke as his own, ""Nitor in adUer-


sam is the motto for a man like me ~
Not less remarkable than his praise


worthy ambition, were Johnson's courage


and confidence. His life was one long strife,


and he never blenched from any opposition
or showed the white feather either before
physical force or moral influence. He en-


tered political life against dominant fac


ton in Greensville, Tennessee, in 1928, and


won his first promotion as alderman.


He carried his seat In the legislature
by the same intrepidity in 1884. In the
celebrated canvass for the governorshlp in
1855 he stepped into his first meeting with a
pistol in his hand, and at later
day, when he had breasted the


tide of secession in the United
States Senate, and returned home to an an


gry constituency, he met mob that came


to lynch him with the same ion-like


audacity. His celebrated speech on


the 22d of February, 1866, from


balcony in Washington, was one of the


boldest, not to say rashest. acts politician


ever committed, and the pluck with which


he braved the angry masses of his own
party in his tour throughout the North was


unprecedented. Any one who ever saw his


sturdy figure and fine face as he stood before


an adverse mob, hurting defiance at Them
in clear tones, must remember the


scene with a thrill of admiration for


the mans moral and physical courage.
Nearly allied to Johnson's courage was
his steadfastness in his convictions. His
education had beer narrow, but the princi-


Piles which he acquired he ""grappled to his


soul with hooks Of steel"" His devotion TO


the constitution became a by-word In


days of bitter partisan strife, but it


was asserted with the same vehemence


in his last speech as it had been for
years before. His belief In the Union was
not less fervent, and his adherence to these
fundamental ideas made him true to the ma


ton, where abler, and perhaps better men


were led astray. He could not be tempted


into secession, and he could not be bullied


into it: and he bore, without fiinching, the


hardest trial man can endure-the
desertion of his friends and neigh


bors and an alliance with their


enemies for a mere abstract principle
Partly, as the result OF his convictions, and
partly as the effect of his emotional nature,
his patriotism was one of his strongest SEN


timents. 1t was active, noisy, elusive, but
i r..-o or,d no arfnl- a great river hrn="

ON THE NEW BAsIN-THE PLAN FOR A SMALL
BASIN ADOPTED.


The City Council met in regular session last
evening, President Mars in the chair.


The Water Committee reported favorably on
the petition of W. s. Hilles and others for
smaller reservoir.


At the suggestion of "". L. Candy, the con-
sideration of the report was laid over until
similar report on similar petition from George
W. Bush and others, WAS presented.


The Lamp Committee reported in favor of
lamp on Fifth Street between Poplar and Lom-
bard on Sixth between Washington and Jeffer-
son on the s. W. corner Of Taylor and Lombard /;
at Twenty third and Market, and at Twenty
third and Tatnall.


The Committee on Opening Streets reported
in favor OF rejecting the Commission on open
ing Vandever Avenue, which was adopted


The favorable report of the Water committee
on the petition Of g. w. Bush and others for
smaller basin WAS read at this point and VIM.
NJ Candy reiterated his belief that the proposed
smaller basin would afford an ample supply of
water while it at the same time would reduce the
expense to the city.


Mr.. Febiger reviewed at considerable length
| the various efforts made to procure a site and
| have new basin constructed. The ground he
contended, was purchased for the purpose OF n
new basin, and whenever that was diverted from
ts original purpose, the ground was to revert
back to its original owners. He did not wish to
appear factious, but willing to make all rea-
sonable concessions to have a basin constructed.
| He therefore, offered All amendment instructing
the Water Committee to excayate enough from
| the upper half to construct basin on the lower
half


The amendment was opposed by Mr.. Farrell,
who, with some difficulty, was kept to the ques-
ton, and who made an earnest protest against
stopping the work and throwing such a large
number of laborers ont of work.
| Mr.. Hayes also reviewed the question at con-
siderable length and opposed the amendment.
After further discussion between Messrs W.
NJ Candy and Febiger, Mr.. Lichtensteiil stated
that he believed there WAS mistake in the draft
and that there was fault iii the location, which
was the cause OF 70 much disagreement. He
then moved that the whole matter be recommlt
ted to the committee with instructions to con
suit with the old committee of which Col. Henry
f. Finegan was chairman, in order to have
proper understanding and establish peace ant
harmony all around.


The motion not being seconded in time, Mr.
Baker obtained the floor and advocated til,
building of large basin i'll accordance with the
plan of Mr.. Graef.


William Candy wanted to see the discussion
closed aud suggested postponement to ascer
tain the relative costs of building the two pro
posed basins.


Mr. Lynch moved to postpone two weeks.


Mr. Hayes opposed such IA long postponcmeut
and hoped the question would be settled thii
evening.





wanted 1t would be proper to make application
to the Legislature as early as possible, auC
hoped the question would not be postponed
more than one week.


Tie motion to Postpone two weeks was lost b.
a vote or ayes to IL.


A motion by Mr.. Lynch to postpone the sub
ject until to morrow night was lost.


The debate was then still further continue
between Messrs. Febiger and W. NJ. Candy, whe
Mr.. Plckels moved the previous question, whic

and peclficatlons of W. E. Morris, the consul

events, says the Lynchburg Netcs, OF
the utmost Importance and interest to
the American people. They will elect
their President and celebrate the Oen-
tennial of their national existence.
Perhaps at no other period in the his
tory of our country have such grave
issues and important interests been in
vOlved in Presidential election. The
great principles Of Democratic gov
ernment in our constitution are by the
result Of that election either 30 be vim
dicated and confirmed, or destroyed
and blotted out forever. The Oenten-
nial celebration, occurring In the same
year with the Presidential election,
will be Influenced by, and will in it's
turn influence, the political contests
and struggles Of the hundreth nni


versary of American independence.
Ii will be q serious question whether
the nominating conventions ought to
be held before or after the Centennial
celebration. They will probably be
held before, as otherwise they might
be 80 late as to afford no time for oan-
vass before the occurrence OF the
elections, and neither party in such
crisis as the present would be willing
to leave anything to chance, or neglect
any means which might augment its
strength, or contribute to its success.
But at whstever time the nominating
conventions ara held, both parties will
attempt to turn to present practical
account the thoughts and sentiments
suggested by the celebration. Repub-
licans will endeavor to show that it was
through and by the instrumentality of
their party alone that the ""best gov
ernment the sun ever shone ON"" was
saved from dismemberment and ami
hilation. But we believe Democracy
can make q stronger and more effective
appeal to the people of the country ut
large than can be made by Republican
ism. We believe the Centennial oel-
ebration will soften the prejudices and
broaden and sweeten the charity of
the people of all sections. and that i'm
bued with the returning spirit of good
will, liberty and patriotism, Americans
will be rather inclined to forget the
enmities, the discords and the strifes
of the past, than to renew the dissen-
sions which have separated them 80
widely during the last fifteen years."

A friend writing us from Washington
county, Va, informs us that there is a
woman by the name Of Mrs. Nina Gobble,
living it that county on the Rusiel road,
II miles northwest Of Abingdon, that will
be 1O1 years old on the 30th of the present
month. He saw her first in the fall of
'73. She informed cur correspondent that
she had walked half mile across very
rough and steep spur Of Clinch mountain,
three weeks before he saw her, with the
aid only Of her staff, and returned tie
same day, and was but little fatigued. He
saw her again in May last-then she was
quite feeble, but able to walk about the
house and yard with the aid of her staff.
She is very reputable woman, and a
member Of the Christian Baptist Church
an humble and consistent Christian.
Her children, grandchildren and great
great-grandchildren are, most Of them
residents of the county.
From the Norfolk Vayinian.


w. II. Faulk, keeper of the Norfolk
county Almshouse, yesterday reported to
us that there is at present in that institu-
ton negro who is upwards of l02 years
Of age, having been born i'll May, 177c.
His name is Solomon Bourne, and he was
slave, the property of Mr.. VIM.
Harrison, of Brandon, on James river. He
is blind, but can make his way anywhere
about the premises. His wife, Patience, is
with him in the Almshouse, and both of
hem agree that she is four months older
han he is. She retains her sight, and can
get about very easy for SO old person.
They were married at 25 years of age, and
nave lived with each other ever since, or
or II years. If living they should by all
means be carried to the Centennial.

To-day, at Maynooth, opened the long-ex-
pected National Synod of the Catholic Church
in Ireland. All the Bishops but those of Kill
dare, Meath, aud Kerry, were present, and
there were in attendance, besides, the Bishop
of Madras (Dr. Fennelly), the Mtred Abbot oi
Mound Melleray Dr. Fitzpatrick), the theo
logians of the several Bishops, and other dis
tinguished ecc!esiastics. Two of the absent
prelates will be at their posts in day or two
the other, DR.. Walsh, of Kildare, is represented
by his Coadjntor, Dr. Lynch. Cardinal Cnllen
presided, be, DR.. McHale, of Tuam, DR.. Kelly,
of Derry, and DR.. Delaney, of Cork, are the
only prelates of the entire number who also
attended the last Synod which was held in
Thurles in 1910. The sight presented by the
assembled ecclesiastics as they went, clothed
in full pontifcals, in procession to the College
Church, was splendid and typical of the re-
juvenescence of the Irish Church. The High
Mass was celebrated by the Cardinal, who also
preached; and then the first sitting (Which
was public one) was held. In my next 1
mean to give further details of this remarkable
event in Irish Church history.


The Lord Mayor of Dublin, in consequence of
| his decided Catholic stand during the O'Connell
| Centenary celebrations, has received from the
Pope, through Monsignor Rinaldini, the Grand
Cross of the Order of st. Gregory. He deserves
this honor on the ground stated. He stood up
splendidly for Catholicism it is only pity
he stood up also for Whiggery-tbat is, Eng
lish Liberalism For having doue the former
he is praised by many and blamed by mono ex-
cept Protestant bigots; having done the latter
he has aroused the almost universal indigna-
tion of the people. Here 1 may mention that
Mr.. Owen Lewis ON. P. Carlow borough) and
Mr., r. P. Bepnerhassett (M. P. county Kerry }
! have addressed their respective constituents
within the past few days on the events of the
last session of Parliament. Both met with a
cordial reception, and they deserved it-par
ticularly Mr.. Lewis, who, by the way, is q
| ism.


The Dublin Ertning Post after a long and
checquered existence, died on Saturday even
| ing last. On Monday evening it's place was
taken by the Erening Telegraph-an evening
edition of the Freeman-which has declared its
great end to be the attainment of Home and
Denomiuational Education. The Post had once
for owner Magee, whom OConnell defended r
the famous trial, and it did good service to the
popular cause half century since. Since
then, however, under the mask of serving Ca
thoicism, it has been mostly Whig paper
and, in recent years, Gladstone organ. When
the Liberals or the Wings went out of Office
it's chief support ceased, and hence it's death
