I'm going far away. from my creditors just

There's the Sheriff running after me with his

And my tailor's vowing vengeance-he swears
he'll give me .fts.
There's no room for speculation, and the
mines amt worth d-n,
And sin't one Of the lucky covss that works

And whichever way turn, Pm sure to meet

I wish those 'tarnal critters, that wrote home

They told us Of the heaps Of dust, and Jumps

But they never said single word how hard
it was to dig.
1went up to the mines, and helped to turn

Got trusted on the strength of that, delusive,
golden dream;
Bat when the river we'd turned, We found

And We who damned the river, by our cred

NAVY DEPARTMENT, Dec. s, 1853.


SIR: have the honor to present the usual
annual report from the Navy Department ex-
hibitngt the condition of this branch ofthe public
service, with brief allusion to the operations Of
the several squadrons during the past year. l
hayeventured also to suggest for consideration
certain views touching the increase of the naval
force, the reorganization of the navy, and the
modification Of the laws and regulations for its
government, from conviction that many prac-
tical reforms may be introduced promotive of
discipline and efficiency.


Sq,tadgons.


The home squadron, Commodore Newton,
consists of the flagship, the frigate Columbia,
Commander Pendergrast; the sloops-ofwar
Albany, Commander Gerry, and Cyane, Com
mander Hollins; the steamers Fulton, Lieu
tenant Watson, and Vixen, lately commanded
by Lieutenant Swartwout. This latter vessel
was despatched in the month of May to Tam
pico' on especial duty, and on her return to
Pensacola was put out of commission on ac-
count of the appearance of yellow fever on
board which, in its fatal progress, deprived
the service of many excellent officers and faith.
full men. So soon as she shall be thoroughly
disinfected and pronounced in safe condition,
she will be again put in commission, and con-
tinue attached to the home squadron.


In January last the Fulton, under the tenn
porary command Of Lieutenant Alexander
Murray, was placed at the disposal of the late
Hon. William R. King, for the purpose Of con.
veying him to Havana for the restoration of
his health; after performing which service, and
after having her machinery repaired, she again
Joined the squadron.


The steamer Saranac, Captain J. G. Long,
detailed for duty in the home squadron, after
having conveyed the Chevalier de Sodre, late
Brazilian charge daffaires, to the seat Of his
government Joined the squadron in February,
and remained attached to it until July, when,
requiring repairs she was withdrawn and put
out of commission.


The vessels attached to this squadron have
been cruising chiefly in the Gulf Of Mexico and
among the West India islands. Disturbances
at San Juan or Greytown threatening the prop
erty and rights Of American citizens, the Cyane,
Commander Hollins, was ordered to visit that
that port The presence of his ship had the
desired effect The conduct Of Commander
Hollins evinced a gallantry and Judgment which
entitled him to the commendation of the de-
partment. The Albany relieved the Cyane, and
remained at San Juan until her services were
deemed no longer necessary


The Brazil squadron, Commodore Salter, con-
sists of the flagship Savannah, Commander
Mercer, which sailed from Norfolk for her des-
tinaton on the l4th of September, and the
sloop-of.war jamestown, Captain Downing.


The brig Bainbridge, Lieutenant Charles G.
Hunter, sailed from New York on the 4th No
vember last to join this squadron, and on her
arrival out, the jamestown will return home,
by which time she will have been absent from
the United States nearly three years.


The Germantown, Commander Lynch, also
sailed from Boston on the I'd December to Join
this squadron. The storeship Relief, Lieuten-
ant Hitchcock, returned from Rio on the 18th
of April last, entering the port of New York,
and on the 25th of July following was again
sent out with stores for the squadron, under the
command of Lieutenant A. B. Fairfax, and
temporarily forms part of it.


The steamer Water Witch, Lieutenant Thos.
j. Page, which left Norfolk on the 9Th of Feb
ruary, though attached 10 this squadron, is not
considered as one of the available vessels be-
longing to it-having, after decree of the pro-
visional director Of the Argentine confedera-
ton, throwing open to navigation the tributa-
ries of the La Plata been detailed for the sur
vey of the rivers Uruguay and Parana. She
arrived out at Buenos Ayres on the 25th of
May, but was detained from the execution of
her immediate duties by the state of civil war
existing unhappily between the different prov
inces Of the Argentine confederation, requiring
her presence for the protection of the interests
of American citizens engaged in commerce, or
resident in that region. When last heard from,
on the 3Oth of August Lieutenant Page was
expecting to set out Immediately on the appoint
ed expedition.


Commander McKeever was in command Of
the Brazil squadron the earlier part of the
year; and having completed a cruise of three
years active and efficient service, he returned
in his flagship, the Congress, Commander
Pearson to the United States, on the Goth Of
July The records of the Navy and State De-
partments furnish satisfactory evidence that a
portion of this squadron did good service in
promoting the interests Of the government, and
protecting the rights of American citizens.


The African squadron, Commodore Mayo
consists of his flagship, the Constitution, Com
mander Rudd; the sloop Marion, Commander
Purvance and the brig Perry, Lieutenant R.
L. Page. The Dale, Commander Whittle,
sailed from Boston to join this squadron on the
18th October. ta es


Commodore Lavalette returned from the
command of this squadron in his flagship the
sloop-ofwar Germantown, Commander Nicho-
las, on the 3Oth of March. The John Adams,
Commander Barron, and the brig Bainbridge,
Commander John Manning, having been de.
tached from this squadron, reached the United
States, the former on the 23d of July, and the
latter on the 26th of August.


Commander Lynch was temporarily attached
by my predecessor to this squadron for recon
naissance Of the west coast of Africa, for the
purpose of ascertaining the localities afording
the greatest facilities for penetrating the inte-
rior of the country. He returned to the Uni
ted States in May last. His communication to
tie department. detailing the results of his re-
connaissance, accompanies this report.


The opinion has heretofore been frequently
expressed, that there is no necessity for a
squadron of so many guns on the coast Of Afri-
ca, and that notice should be given to Great
Britain, under the terms of the treaty in regard
to the suppression Of the slave trade, so as to
be relieved from its obligations. The COM
merce on that coast has of late years increased so
greatly, and American ships trading in that re-
gion have multiplied so much, that am salts"

heavy the approaching winter: but this opinion
does not appear to be correct, according to
what is stated by those who have recently made
survey and examination OF the Sacramento
river from this place to Monroevil!e, (Which is
as far as necessary-ihe river being conlpara-
lively good below that plaee.) 1t is stated by
the gentlemen who made this examination, that
there Is sufficient water in any part of the river
below this point, for small sized steamers to run
on at any season Of the year. The greatest OBJ
struction to navigation, even at this low stage Of
water, is the snags which are in the channel,
and these comparatively few. and could be
removed it is estimated, at an expenditure of
about one hundred thousand dollars. Now this
is certainly very trihing sum- when we take
into cces ion the great advantages which
will resul, .ron he successful navigation of the
Sacramento river al all seasons of the year.


Judge Lynch made his appearance in town
few days ago. for the purpose of sitting on
case, wherein the People of the State of Cali
tornia, whose special representative he is, was
plaintiff. and Char ey Bell defendant. 1t ap-
pears that defendant had become intoxicated,
and had entered public house some time du-
ring the night, in suspicious manner, yet did
not steal anything; but appearances being
against him, he was arrested and examined be-
fore Justice Mix. who committed him for trial.
Judge Lynch not being satisfied with this pro-
ceeding. took the prisoner from the officer who
had him in custody, aud sentenced him to be
publicly whipped and to leave town in twelve
hours. Those who executed the sentence
seemed to enjoy it, from the manner in which
they huzzaed-however, they appeared to have
some sympathy for him. as they gave him money
for few days expenses, after which he left
town; l should have said he was colored man.
Judge Lynch, no doubt, thinking this very
good opportunity to clear his docket, had Sam
Vose, another colored man. brought before his
Honor, for giving shelter and concealment to
Charley Bell, while the officers were in search
of him. Sam Yose was also sentenced to be
whipped, which executed immediately;
after which the Judge retired for refreshments
Since this time our town has been quiet ex-
cepta lawsuit now and then, which gives the
Pettfcggers an opportunity OF blowing off their
extra gas.


There some dissatisfaction caused here
by the tax sale notices, which were put up by
the Sheriff; the men say they have never been
called on for their taxes, but have always been
ready and willing to pay them since their prop
erty was assessed, and they think ii unjust that
they should be made to pay heavy bill of costs,
when they have not been al fau, in the matter


The misunderstanding that has heretofore ex-
listed with regard to the title to this town prop
erty, understand, is about to be settled so that
those who buy property hereafter will have no
trouble about the title. This is an arrangement
very much to be desired, as it will enable us to
build without any fear of future interruption.


You cannot ima CINE how fast this place is i'm
proving, and amoas permanent settlers
there are quite nnmber of ladies whose lres-
ence gives home-like appearance 70 The place.
We also hope to have newspaper established
here very soon, and it is expected hat he pro-
prietors of ihe Cou,ier WI be al he head OF it.
And should they need any aid there is 30 doubt
but Snooks +"" and Matidy'' will help them
through all hard and knotly places, especially
where orthography is in the question.


Yours, respectfully,

Mr. Wombaugh, Senator from Yolo, has
introduced into the Senate ""a bill for
an act to regulate fees in Office"" which
is based upon the cheap and nasty prin-
eiple for officers beyond anything we
have here etofore seen. The fees of Coun-
ty Clerk, Recorder Sheriff, Asse ssor, JUS
tees, &C., are reduced in nearly every
case from one-half to two-thirds. The
biz is well calculated to drive every re-
sponsible man from Office, and leave the
business ofthe counties to beg for agents
1t is the worst move we have yet seen
made by this legislature, which certain,
ly equals its predecessors in random
schemes, and demagogical measures
We object in toto to the idea that it is
good economy to get public business dsne
Cor the least money possible. True econ
omy is best consulted by the establish
ment of such fees and salaries that the
best men in the community will consid-
er Office worth taking. The way in
which official duties are performed
is Of more Importance than their cost
IL an assessor or sheriff is curtaiied in
his salary below q remanerative rate he
will attend to his duties proportionably,
and loss of county and state revenue will
be ten times more than the amount de-
MED him. At present our justices can
scarcely pay their board with their fees
of office; yet Mr. Wombaugh, desires to
reduce their pay on an average TO one.
half less than its present rate. Why
does he not at once abolish the Offices,
and let the people revert to Lynch Law,
or some other first principles! Good
Justices cannot afford to hold Office, and
will not do so, where the pay does not
support them, and bad ones are worse
than none.


We give some of the features Of the
new bill, as follows, in reference to JUS
tices :.


Pres't rate New rate.
Subpoena to witness IS cts. 10 cts
Taking 4 certifying oath so 25
Writ of attachment 200 100


Entg satisfaction judg't so rs


The fees allowed to Sheriff and Coun-
ty Clerk, &c, are in this same ratio, and
if enforced, will make it impossible for
the right kind of men to hold them, and
properly attend to them. Some men in
the Legislature seem to think everything
that sounds like retrenchment is a hobby
to ride, and while they waste thousands
of the public money by prolonging their
useless session, embark in all kinds of
speculative enterprises to catch popular
favor. Their politics and patriotism are
the tricks Of the conjurer, and all for
effect. We trust there are men of sound
sense enough in the Legislature to vote
down this new humtug.


1t would be good retrenchmeHt to,
sift out the flats from this Legislature and
pay the balance sl6p per day, to transact
the public business. Our state bonds
wonld soon be at par.


""Oficial"" has few words to say to Mr.
Wombaugh, and to his tenderness we
leave him, remarking however, that we
totally dissent from all reflections upon
Ohio, in which our imaginative cores
pondent INDUCES."

FIRST WAED-Twe tickets weie in the field. John B.
Holmes hitherto Soft advocate turned out 10 the support
of the Dimond Had ticket, which defeated by the
Mugan party by 22O maj The election was conducted as
loosely as usual far voting concerned After the
electors had exercised their suages for Democratic regu
laors for 1854 rattle was announced to off at the
same place no 1lO Greenwich ST. for mammoth hog and
Saturday fixed upon for this sublime adventure Whether
this specimen of pOrcine is Dmond Mulgan Hard we
don't know.


FOURTH WARD-The voters at No. 81 James st were
considerably puzzled at the early part of the meeting by
the circulation among the faithful of large number OF
Wing ballots and it not before 100 or so were poled
that the fraud was discovered by that unpeneabe Ada
mantne Joseph Sweet of the hardest kind Of iard
who is ever the alert for movements Of this kind He
could not perceive the point of supporting such Democratic
Wigs as Dennis Mclaughlin, W H. Sparks, Augustus 5
Greene Benjamin Buck John Edwards Philip J. Down
ev and other associates OF the National Democracy at the
present crisis"" This joke amended by the in
seion of sucaet reliable 6nd regular Demo tickets
TO far oubsance the tickets accidentally slipped into the
ballot box by the too oreduous


F,r1H WARp-At about O'Clock about l2 votes were
received by the Inspector when mysterious individual
in mask passed through the bar into the
where the election was going on snsched the ballot box
and rushed into West Broadway and dashed tae box to
atoms The Inspectors then left The Emblem and proceeded
homewnrd deriving a half dozen spectators OF their
evenings amusement


It's said the composition of the ticket presented by the
Ward political managers had produced this lack Of enthu
sas and that anew ticket will be presented to be scratched
Of an early day The gee up of two tickets may also be
msditaed and revolution in the politics OF the Ward
grayely proposed


SIXTH Everything passed off very quietly at Gar
ricks although two tickets in the field This an IN
common result the politics OF the bloody Sixth Ward
and refreshing sign.

GoLp HILL, Ma rch 29th,- 1853.",,"


Friend Mitchell the past two
days we have been enjoying the pleasures
of the ""equinoxial,"" such as only Cali
fornians can form any idea Of Ofcou
Everything is in swimming condition, and
although we are not obliged, like our Sac
ramento neighbors, to navigate the streets
in boats, yet we find that rubber boots
come very apropos.


The Auburn Ravine is in it's glory and
the dams of the Georgia and Ohio Com
panies have both been washed away. The
dam of the b. r. & G.. H. Co., which
has just been completed, is also partially
destroyed, but as it has never been ac-
cepted by the company the loss will fall
upon the contractors, Messrs. Shipfey Il
TO-, who, it is to he hopeh, will re 'uild it
in a more substantial manner than before.


Several tents have been robbed during
the past week and the thieves have not us
vet been detected, although it is suspected
that it was the work of Indians. The
tents of Messrs. Shipley, Provost and
Langdon were robbed of property to the
amount of about $3OO A company of
miners viii pay the Indians visit to-nor-
row and If any of the property is found
in their possession lynch law will be their
reward.


Our town still continues to improve,
and a church has just been completed,
where we are to- have preaehing every
Sabbath by Rev. Mr.. FG ton and Hunter.
A school has also been got into operation
with about twenty scholars, and if the old
saying is true that ""As the twig is bent
the trees Inclined"" the instruction which
they are sure to receive from their esti-
lnahle teacher, Mrs. Douglass will render
them n good stock for our young State.


An Exchange and Banking House is
also about to commence business with
Messrs. SIoat & Levings at its head, and
we predict much success to its projectors.


Our miners still continue to do well, and
although there is not SO much of rush
as at the commencement of the winter,
yet the mines are proving far more profit
able than at that time; particularly at Vir-
ginia and Gold Hill big strikes are being
made, and some miners are fast making
their piles. G. l.."

Friend MitcheH:- rain, rain and
still the windows of Heaven seem opened
until each little streamlet is almost a
river, while the ravne before my door
goes rushing and roaring past as if anx-
ious to hasten and add its muddy waters
with those Of the big, blue ocean. Our
""dry diggings"" have become wet ones,
while those who had a little water are
drowned out: exampIe-horse power and
wheel barrow company upon the fiat
whose pit is turned into swimming
bath. But it is fine time for the bill
diggings and seems to be well improved, ,
as the many sluices upon the hill sides
bear witness to. At Virginia diggings in
particular much activity is manifested,
and the most Of the cOmpaies there are
averaging from six to eight dollars per
hand. At Orc city there is not quite so
much mining, but what it falls short in
the way of diggings is made up by the
fine buildings which have been construct
ed there, while nearly each house is
blessed by the presence Of a lady, but
they are all married, so there is no show
for bachelors. Should you ever visit this
place do not fail to stop at the American,
where MIR. Foose and his amiable wife
will do the agreeable in manner not to
be surpassed. BY the way what has be-
come of the Orc city and Bear River r :.
R. Co.; think they must have laid by for
repairs.


Last but not least we come to Gold
Hill which is the principal Of the three
villngos. One year since, when | visited
this spot, but two cabins and one tent con
stituted the village; now, in point of size,
it vies with Ophr. Much activity pre-
walls here at present, and new bu dings
are continually being constructed.


The first robbery ever committed in
this place occurred few days since,
when Messrs. Lemmons s. Clark had
$3.50 stolen from their drawer; a few eve
nings since they were again robbed by
some adroit thief who cut hole through
the side of the house with a chisel and
removed bag, containing $500, from the
bar while the room was full of people,
No discovery has as yet been made which
might detect the thief, but should he be
found out Judge Lynch will in all proba-
bility try, and hang him.


AS the "" ne,c road' Of which you made
mention laat week is not at present IN
very good travelling order. Col. Graham
of this place has pack train of mules
which goes to Sac. and returns twice a
week, and last week it beat the mail line
one day.


But enough at present; should you take
notion to visit this place, the Pilot Line
of stages will bring you in double quick
time, and editors are always welcome
here, particularly by the ladies, who are
admirers of the 'press.""


A "" esterday morning
as the noisy town-crier of j. Is. Starr,
ESQ was perambuating in the vicinity
Of sixth street on J, and with red flag and
catalogue waving high above his head was
vocferously announcing to all within
hearing that great sale was about tC
take place at the auction store on Front
lie was ali of sudden cut short in hi,

recapitulatiOn OF the attractions of the
stock offered by the Colonel, ""the fines
lot of guuds ever offered in tbs marker
will be knocked down""-when all OF q
sudden nothing but the aforesaid red flag
was seen upon the surface of the water
where so recently stood the living enbodl-
ment Of man. Very soon however
sooner than spirits appear when called
from rhe vastly deep, head popped UP
above the water, and with nlmitab
scrambling, its owner soon stood rectu'

er and son, which is described as the most affec-
ting scene that ever occurred in the prison. The
son begged, implored, entreated and prayed that
his father would only declare his (the son's) in
nocence; but the father evaded direct answers,
and only answered that he forgave him Tor the
hand he took in his conviction. The parting
was still more affecting. The father clasping
his son to his breast, kissed him repeatedly upon
his lips telling him to transfer them to his daugh-
ters, when he next saw them, and finally giving
him one fond kiss for himself. In leaving the
the prison, after getting to the door. the son re-
turned to his father several times to give him an
other and another fond embrace. During the
two or three days that elapsed between the time
of this interview between himself and son, and
his execution Spring changed his tone several
times in reference to his sons Innocence; at one
time declaring that he was the murderer, and al
others that he was innocent. La this state Of
mind the prisoner continued to pass the last few
hours OF his existence. At times grave and Sc
rous, at others lively and even simply indifer-
ent to his fate.


Below we give the details of his execution, as
found in the Ledger:


PREPARATIONS FOR THE EXECUTION.


The spectators within the prison numbered al
least fou1nlundred. Without the walls there
were about two hdndrei scattered around, IN
clu ling large body of police.


The preparat lions for proceeding to the prison
ward were complete within few minutes oi | 1
O'clock and The various official bodies lormed Ia
line aud awaited the coming of the prisoner in
the court-yard within the nor hern gate. A
1 ba
processIoa coufmenced its solemn march


THE EXECUTION.


The condemned man was seen TO trembe when
he gazed upou the large plumber assembled. aud
on catching the first glimpse of the g4iiows d
hnervous trembling apparent, but still he
wa kel firmly aud ascenled ;he steps boldly.
| The revemed gentlemen. and the Sheriff, and
| Marshall, assembled with him. and the religious
exercises commenced By singing hymn. Fhe
prisoner kept his eyes closed most of the time.
Upon the conclusion of the hymn, the Rev.
Mr.. Street, thus addressed him.
Author Spring, YOU have been convicted and
sentenced To death for the murder of HOnora
Shaw and Ellen Lynch. and the execution OF
that sentence is now about 10 take place. We
have not ceased to warn you OF your fate and to
iniuce you TO repent and make your peace with
God. | now ask you. in the presence of Almighty
God, before whom you will shortly stand, are
you guilty or not guilty of the murder of these
women?


Prisoner-No sir no sir!
! Mr. Street.-The Grand Jury have also, by their
presrntment, charged you with the murder of
Mr.. Rink. Are you guilty or not guilty Of that
crime


life.


Mr.. Street, have still another and last ques-
tion to ask you. Before God, is your son.
Arthur Spring entirely clear of the murder Of
Mrs Shaw and Mrs. LyRch.


Prisoner-I believe he is. lie had no more
to do with il than had.


At this response there general groan
from the spectators. which was however, but
momentary.


Mr.. Street then said. '' MAY God have mercy
upon your soul -


All upon the scaffold then kneeled, and the
Rev. Mr.. Kensil prayed in the most fervent
manner.


AT the conclusion, the prisoner spoke few
words to Mr. Street, and that gentleman was
about 10 repeat it, when the sheriff interposed
and told the prisoner to speak himself


He then said that he went TO bed on the night
of the murier at z o'clock and never Knew any
/ thing of ii until told by the officers


The question was again asked him, sis your
son innocent 2"" and he replied:


MY SON is entirely innocent of blood! J""
{"" Mr.. Alexander here exclaimed Let this go
throughout the land p


The reverned gentlemen then left the gallows,
after shaking hands with the prisoner.


The executioner arranged he knot and drew
the zap over his face and the Sheriff having left
him the props were removed from beneath the
! platform and at quarter after Ii o'clock the
drop fell 4nl the victim of offended justice hung
between Heaven aud earth.
! He fell about-two feet aud a half and it was
thought dislncated his neck, as with the excep
ton of slishl contraction of the extremsiles
the body remained perfectly motionless. Thus
has ended this bloody tragedy."

about 8 o'clock, three men stopped at the
house of Mr.. Aikenhead, county treasur-
er of Santa Clara, and calling him out
side they seized him, having first inflicted
a severe blow on his head with some dull
instrument. They then drag ged HIM un-
der a shed about thirty yards from the
house and beat him until he became sense
less. While he was in this state they
took his keys from his pocket, and unlock
ing his safe, distracted from it something
like twelve thousand dollars. The rob-
bers then fed. They were tracked sew
eral yards from the house, and the foot
prints proves they had left in a hurry
Several parties started out yesterday
morning in pursuit, and it was expected
that if apprehended the Williams would be
lynched. In calling out to Mr.. Aiken
head they spoke good English, and the
boots worn by one of the party were of a
fashionable make, as proved by the foot
marks. S. f. Herald."

pertaining 10 the wants and relations Of ha-

superfuous TO urge is consideration On the
people Of this age n general, and cur own

is great interest displayed and anxiety mani
tested by the good people throughout the
length and breath Of our land regarding the

viii, without doubt, greatly delay the work,

II outright. at least so far as the Congress Of
the United States Is concerned


The charge Of selfshness and unfairness Is
perfectly legitimate; and that both have been
practised by somebody, i most Ianifestly
shown by the manner in which the appropria-
ton Of Congress has been applied to the ex-
ploration and survey Of the different passes
Of the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those
passes have been entirely neglected which
present fewest obstacles TO the construction
Of a road, and which besides, from their geo
graphical position, afford facilities for commu-
nication, and advantages generally, TO people
On the Atlantic side, as well as TO intermedi-
ste settlers, and by which the people Of Ore
gon, whenever they see fit, or their wants re-
Quire it. can readily connect, by 8 branch,
Their territory with the eastern States and
California Moreover, by bringing the road
through a high northern pass. not only would
the aforementioned advantages accrue, but
likewise our own State be better accommO-
dated and vastly more benefited. This will
te made plain when II Is clearly shown that
the mountain counties, beginning at the north
ern line Of the State, and running south with
the Sacramento valley 10 It's Termination,
together with this valley, contain two-fhirds,
If not more, Of the population and wealth Of
the State; and the amount Of travel between
the northern and southern portions Of the
State 10 the great centre Of attraction. San
Francisco, Is 50 obviously in favor Of our po-
sltlon, that II Is unnecessary to urge it.
Besides, It Is well known that four -ffths Of
the immigration finds its way into California
by the high northern passes and all tn Sc
immigrants, and others who have passed and
repassed the Sierra, by both the northern and
southern routes, give the passes north the
preference, particularly that known as - No
ble's Pass declaring that they were not
aware during their passage through that part
q Of the mountains, OF any ascent or descent,
except by the few Of the water 1t Is more
the object Of this communication 10 complain
Of the manner IN which the appropriation Of
Sl50oo0 by the last Congress has been ap-
piled, how the interests Of this portion Of our
state have been overlooked and neglected

the minds Of those well informed and unpreju-
diced. that this viii, upon examination, if fair
play be shown, offer, independent Of geo
al
inducements than any other route Now il
Is d Unknown fact, that several surveys Of
the Sierra Aeyada, 10 the end that the best
and most suitable pass might be selected
were ordered by Congress TO be made, and.
under the direction Of the President, those
surveys are now being made, and in localities
which, in point OF geographical position. to-
getber with many other disadvantages, are
unfit for the great object contemplated, TO the
exclusion OF routes which offer every advan-
tage. The question Is frequently asked,
How is this Why has preference been
given 10 one part Of the State, and the other
teen entirely neglected Is the President
partial, has he been misled OF imposed
upon Certainly one OF the other must have
been the case. Whichever ii IS, it IS hoped
that i viii be discovered in time for correc-

ties. and all interested, in the Sacramento

matter, Is being to them Of paramount i'm
portance.


1t appears, from the Marysyiile Herald,
that 5 ~ bic meeting was held at Bidwels
rancho, al which resolutions were passed
complaining Of the administration at Wash
ington for neglectiBg TO survey the northern
passes, and expressing their indignation
thereat. This IS as it should be. and If all

Before RUFus SMITH, Justice Of the
Peace, God Hill,


/ Philip Lynch VS. Frederick Felir. ct al.


This was an action FOR trespass upon and
damage done to plaintiffs town lot in
Ophlr, upon whieh he is residing. Plain
tiff proved his ownership and peaceabIe
possession of the premises for near two
years; also the resspass upon by defend
ants, (two of whom are foreign miners.)
and the digging. of a large hole or, pit
within seven feet of Plaintiffs house,
thereby endangering its foundation, as
wei as Jeopardlzng the lives Of Plaintiffs
family. Plaintiff also proved tha, it was
defendants intention to dig under dhe
house. In addition to which Testimony,
plaintiff proved that defendants had cdt
ditch at the back door of p ainti fl IS house.
which was allowed to fiji up with sedi-
ment, end overflow his yard and premises
to his great detrinent and annoyance. Ks


Defendants, on the other hand, attempt
ed to prove that they were. empowered to
act as they had'by a local law of the mi
ners, which was alleged to have been
passed about year ago, aud which it was
asserted, read, that miner could dig up
to house, and under it, provided he
could give good and sufficient security not
to damage the premises. None of the
Witnesses, however, could swear that
there was any such law upon record.


The Justice charged the jury, that set
tiers upon town lots in the mines, located
upon the public domain, had rights in the
soil as well as miners, and were entitled
to protection in their rights by the admin
lstrators of the law of the land. The
jury returned verdict in favor of the
plaintiff, in five dollars damages and costs,
and restraining the defendants from again
entering plaintiffs premises. ...'

On Sunday evening last, our town was
the scene of an extraordinary excite
ment. An Austrian, by the name OF
Peter Nicholas, from Saw Mill Flat,
visited Columbia, and became intoxica-
ted and quarrelsome In the evening, he
met Capt. John Parrot, from Pine Log
Crossing, formerly of Gloucester, Mas
sachusetts, and attacked him roughly,
sening him by the throat, and demand
ing to know the name of his country
Parrot replied to him quietly, at the
same time trying to shake him Off
Nicholas became exasperatcd and Par
rot, in stepping back to avoid him, STUN
bled aud FELL Nicholas at the same time
drew his bowie knife and plunged it into
Parrots neck, running down his back
some five or six inches. Medical
assistance was Immediately procured, but
all to no purpose, for the unhappy man
expired yesterday afternoon, about four
O'Clock. 1t appears that there had been
ill feeling between the miners of Pine
Log Crossing and the Flat for some
time past; the parties engaged in this
affair, however, were perfect stranger to
each other, and the murder was COM
mitted without any palliating circum-
stances attending it. Thus was an hon
ct, peaceable man cut down in the prime
of life, blythe knife of the assassin.


Nicholas was Immediately arrested by
the citlzams and handed over to the au-
thorities; thus evincing commendable
disposition to have justice mceted out
to the murderer by the laws of the coun-
try.


On Monday morning. he was examin-
ed before Justice Carey, and commit
ted, of course. Before his removal could
be effected, an immense crowd had con-
gregatel around the Court House, next
door to our Office. A large body of men
from Pine Log-the friends of Parrot
numbering about sixty, now appeared on
the ground, and demanded the prisoner;
and it was evident to all, that rescue
would be attempted. Constable Conner
swore in posse of special constables.
The prisoner was chained to staples
driven into the floor But all these pre-
cautions were without avail. The court
room soon became crowded by The excit-
ed multitude; and at signal, the Off
GERS were secured, the staples forced by
a pick, and the prisoner handed out of
the court house, over the heads of the
infuriated crowd. Thence he was borne





along Broadway, some holding on to the
hair of his head, others to his LEGS, arms
and body, to a pine tree in the rear of
Mr.. Van Gulpen's store. A rope was
speedily procured, and thrown over the
limb, and doubtlessly moment more
the prisoner would have been launched
into eternity, but this was prevented by
the timely interference of Mr.. CofEorth
and others of our citizens. Appeals
were made to the multitude to give the
culprit a fair trial, and after long par
ley and an excitement that almost baf-
fes distinct portraiture, it was acceed-
ed to, and Gold Hill was selected as the
mimic Court House. Thither moved
the crowd, which had increased from a
hundred to over a thousand.


Upon the arrival at Gold Hill, J. D.
Patterson, Esq. was appointed sheriff,
with several deputies. A jury was en-
panelled, consisting of four from Pine
Log Crossing, and eight from Columbia;
among whom were Messrs. Leary, Hill
dreth, Evans, Massey, Brophey, and 9TH
crs of our citizens. At this period, the
Sheriff of the county, Maj. Solomon ar
rived Oh the ground. and demanded the
prisoner should be given up to him, He"

moments, and begged the people to O.
bcy the laws. Mr. Cofroth next ad-
dressed the multitude in support of the
Sheriff, and in opposition to Lynch Law


The tide at this time seemed to be turn
ing in favoc of the authorities, but the
more clamorous of the crowd demanded
that the trial should proceed. The ju-
ry were finally sworn, and the case was
resumed. The assemblage appointed
Col. Cazneau to prosecute, and Col
Gillespie and Mr. Coffroth to Defend
Col. Gillespie spoke first on behalf Of
the prisoner, and ably contended that as
Parrot was not dead, the crime of muir
der had not been committed, and hence
the prisoner did not deserve capital pun
ishment. Col. Cazneau in a mastery
effort presented the case for the people,
and logically siftcd the evidence and
facts presented. Mr.. Coiroth for thu
defence, spoke for half an hour, upon
the ill-effects of mob law, and eloquently
exhorted the assemblage to stand by the
Office rs of their own choice, the dignity
of the town and county, and the laws e.
nacted by their own delegates. At the
close Of Nr. C's remarks, the jury re-
tired


In about fifteen minutes they returned
with the following verdict:


owe the Jury find the prisoner gull
ty of assault and battery, with intent to
kill Capt. John Parrot, but as Parrot
is not yet dead, they agree that the pris
oner shall be given up to the civil au-
thoiities.""


The widest excitement followed.
""IIang him!"" ""String him up'' ""Give
him to the Sheriff."" was heard issuing
from hundreds of mouths above the din
and confusion. A vote was taken, and
it was decided to ratify the decision of
the jury. The friends of Parrot gather
ed around the jury, who kept the pris
oner in charge, and attempted rescue,
but without success. He was then Civ
en- to officer Conner and Sheriff Solomon
and by them taken out Of town, ably as
sisted by the jury, and many citizens.
A large crowd followed, but it soon
dropped DOWN to small number. At
the lumber-yard, the jury and citizens,
concluding that no further effort. would
be made to recapture by the mob, aban-
doned the prisoner in the hands of the
Sheriff. He was finally lodged in the
Sonora Jail, and will be brought to trial
at the next term of the District Court.


The excitement soon died away, and
our town in the evening assumed its
wanted quietness. Parrots death yes
terday, has started afrcsh the feeling
hitherto exhibited, and wo to Peter Nj
colas if he should be found in Columbia
to-day. No power on earth could pre-
vent him paying the forfeiture Of his
life."

e"" In to-day's paper we publish an
interesting article descriptive Of the Big
Tree in Calaveras county. We are sorry
to learn that the hand of the destroyer
has already been laid upon this King OF
the forest. Had that remarkable tree
been in any other country it would have
been most religiously preserved. Laws
even would have been passed for its pre-
servatiou; but with us it is discovered
admired, and then felled by the ruthless
hand of the destroyer. Truly, as the

From the Los Angeles Star.",,"
The defendant appeared and plead gull
ty to assault and battery, which plea
wa; accepted by the Court with the con-
sent of the District Attorney. He was
sentenced to pay fine of one dollar and
the costs OF prosecution.


PRAIsEwoRTHY.-The wretched, worth
less, wo-begone Indians who, as regular
ly as Sunday comes round, occupy the
city prison on charges varying from
drunkenness to stealing, making disturb
ances in the street, stabbing, etc, are
now employed by the city authorities in
cleaning the ssreers.


The overland mail from San Diego
reaches Los Angeles only semi-occason-
ally, and then with news several months
old. The Star considers this mail fine
speculation for the persons who have the
contract for transporting it, but further
than that, Of no possible good to any
body.


ATFRAY.-A quarrel occurred between
two Sonoranians, named Damasio and
Jacento, on the Sth inst, which resulted
in the cutting of the former badly in the
arm. As the assault was entirely un-
provoked, Jacento was arrested by some
Americans, present at the time, by whom
he was tried, after fashion peculiar to
themselves convicted and sentenced to
receive ifty lashes On his bare back,
which sentence was carried into imme-
diate effect on the public plaza.


SAD ACCIDENT On tho Tth inst,
female who lives in the house OF Don
Tomas Sanchez, was badly burned in
consequence of her clothes taking fro
foom match, which she accidentally
ignited. A child, which she held in her
AIMS at the time, narrowly escaped
similar fate. The sufferer, though in
extreme pain from the wounds, will pro-
bally recover.


Horse STEALING--AR OF THIEF
-MoRE LYNCHING.-1he citizens of Los
Angeles have suffered SO severely in the
loss of stock by thieves within the last
year, that they are now extremely care
ful and vigilant. Two len named Smith
and Williams, were connected with n
band of professional horse thieves; they
proposed to one Price to join them in
their depredations; he feigned acquies-
cence but informed the citizens of the
facts, and told them where the rendez-
vous was to take place. At the hour ap-
pointed, party Of Americans, we'll arm
ed, proceeded to the place designated;
Price had preceded them and when the
party came up the three were together,
the two thieves saddling up the horses
which they had stolen, and tho other
pretending to be about something else.
The pursuing party came upon them un-
observed, and one Of them bursting upon
the grour, discharged his pistol The ball
taking effect upon Smith, who FELL but
Immediately got up and fled to house
about a mile distant. Williams also
fed and in endeavoring to shoot him,
one Of the pursuers accidentally dis
charged his piece at Price, wounding
him in the hand. Williams escaped,
but Smith was followed to the house in
which he had taken refuge, and cap
turcd 1t was first intended to try and
hang the prisoner at once, but propo.
sal to bring him to town prevailed, and
he was brought in On Sunday and placed
in Jail.


A Lynch trial being thought by some
persons in town, the best for his case,
and no one appearing to oppose it very
strenuously, in obedience to notices pre-
viously posted up, small number Of
persons met on Tuesday who, taking tho
prisoner from the Jail, proceeded to in
vestigate the evideAce against him. -
The result was the deduction of the
facts above related, upon which he was
sentenced to receive seventy-eight LASH
es upon the bare back The sentence
was carried into effect the same after
noon-Smith and Mexican passing
through the ordeal together. Smith has
made tracks and is now at liberty to re-
sumo his profession. 1t is said that his
real name is Isaac ID. Martin.


When the man Smith was about to be
hogged for horse stealing, he objected to
having the punishment inflicted by an
Indian, and call was made for some
white man to do ia compensation Of
ten dollars being offered to any one who
would undertake the job. An Ameri-
can, young man, apparently in desti-
tute circumstances, stepped forward and
accepted the offer, and, for the money
paid, performed the disgusting task
No sooner had he finished, however,
than he was seized by portion Of the
crowd, who bad collected to witness the
1oggng, thrown upon q blanket and
tossed up into the air several times, as
high as the united strength of those who
assisted in the operation could throw
him, in his last descent falling so heav-
lily, upon his head and shoulders, as TO
injure him severely. The concuss,on
was so violent as to deprive him OF his
senses ut the time, but we learn that he


has since recovered His escape from a


worse fate is almost miraculous. The al

The Flood-Loss Of Stock The rains,


Sc, &c.


Through the polteness Of Mr.. Dosh.
of the Shasta Courier, we are placed in
possession of later and interesting intelli-
s"""""""" from Shasta and the surrounding
country.


Mr.. ID. left the city of Shasta on Sum-
day morning, at which time the snow
was eight inches in depth, and OIL tho
WeaverviIe trail six feet deep. 1t rain
ed necessarily, on the way down, with
the exception of one half day. The
Sacramento river at Tehama, Monroe
Vile and Colusa is nearly as high as during
the last flood, and rising with great ra-
pidity. The former place is already par
TALLY inundated Messrs. Pomeroy &
Martin, extensive dealers in stock, lost
on Wednesday, in slough six miles this
side of Marysville, 81 head Of cattle out
of a drove of five hundred. One of tho
owners who came down on the boat says
that the remainder are probably drowned,
as the water was rising too rapidly to
allow them to escape.


On Sunday morning horrible affair
occurred at French gulch, 16 miles north
of Shasta. A man named Hall, who had
separated from his wife fortnight previ-
ously by mutual consent, visited an apart
ment where she was sleeping with her
paramour, and attacked them both witt
IA knife, cutting them across the face ana
person so terribly that there is no possibi
lity of their recovery. Immediately afte,
the act was committed Hall came int
Shasta and gave recital Of the affair
No attempt at arrest.


The county of Trinity is almost de-
populated. Flour has been selling n
Weavervile at 81 25, but owing to small
stocks packed over by Cram, Rogers &
Co.'s Express, and Mr.. Lynch, tho
prices have been reduced to 95 cents.


Not word has yet been heard from
Yreka. The general impression is that
if no provisions have reached that place
from Humboldt Bay, the citizens must +.
undergoing absolute starvation.


The road between Tehama and Shasta
is strewn with the wrecks of wagons, and
teams stuck fast in the mud. There is a
large amount of provisions between these
places.


The total losses by the recent fro
Shasta amount to $S1 900. This is con-
sideraIly less than the first estimate.

upon the same principle which has been recognised by
Congress. think it will obviate Of the general OBJ
Jectons made by the Senator from Virginia. Mr MASON
The object is to authorize exploration to vote small

may be Of character important the United States in

prated money to make explorations in the East and in
different quarters of the world and in places where
expect to derive any advantage that the
principle is the same, and hope the amendment viii be
adopted without hesitation.


Mr.. GWIN hope we shall have a vote. There are
other amendments which will be lost unless they

Mr. MASON. / freely admit that whenever it is for
the benefit Of the public service for any officer to make
explorations abroad under the sanction of the Depart

From the Sonora Herald Extra, Oct A.


We have to record another terrible conhagra-
ton. About halfpast three o'clock, this morning,
the cry of fire was heard A candle had been
carelessy left upon stand in the rear of Labe-
toures building, between the two arroyos which
set fire TO some curtains. In few minutes the
whole building was flame man saw it in
time TO stop the fire; but in spite Of his earnest
entreaty, no would render any assistance in
furnishing water. He begged of certain parties
in an adjoining gambling saloon to leave their
game and help 10 save the town. But they were
100 much absorbed in their game. If any one
needs evidence of the evil Of gambling, this fire
furnished sufficient TO satisfy all doubts The
game was of more importance than the salvation
of the city, and the fire was left to do its work. Ii
spread by rods, and not by feet, for the buildings
We're OF wood or canvass.


Thanks TO Messrs. Lame md Groom and hun
dred others working on the south side, and to the
Sonora hook and ladder company, and the So
nora hose company working on the north side, the
fire was stopped on both sides while it was burn
ing with the greatest fury. The force pump in
the City Hotel was put to work by hands that did
not tire and played upon all the adjoining build
ngs. 1t was by this and the active exertions of
numerous friends that the fire was stopped on the
south at the Clay Hotel, opposite our Office, and
at Mr.. Lanes new building next adjoining our OF.
flee. The heat was SO intense that the hands of
the printers were blistered in carrying out the
cases oftype. But the pump kept up a continual
stream upon the roof and sides of our building,
which, in addition to a few pailfuls Of water
dashed upon the rear, saved us.


On the north the fire was stopped at Jackson
street by the hook and ladder company, in connec-
tion with the hose company The livery stable Of
Cooper & Mccarthy is thoroughly scorched but
every effort was made TO save it, and we are happy
TO state, with ultimate success. A building was
torn down on the opposite side of Washington
street. next door but one south of the Sonora drug
store. The hose from the water works was here
brought to play upon the flames, and by judicious
and energetic work, the fire was arrested. The
adjoining building was completely on fire, but was
saved by the hose company.


The courthouse, Placer hotel, Jail, and
Empire livery stables, are all saved. Also, the
fre-proof building Of Wolf & Brothers, which was
saved, with all its valuable contents, while all
around it was burned. The handsome adobe fire.
proof building formerly occupied by Mr.. Ham
mond, was destroyed except the bare walls. The
iron doors in the rear had been simply pushed to,
without being fastened, and the intense heat from
the adjoining building warped them open. Had
they been properly closed, there is no doubt the
building would have stood the fiery ordeal


Adams & Co., and Wells, Fargo q Co, have
both lost their buildings, but their vaults stand,
and their books and treasure are all safe.


The loss of property is estimated at $500 600.
We are panied to record, in addition, the loss of
human life. f. B. Lundy, Canadian by birth,
and late from Placer county, was sleeping in the
rear of Hollands Saloon, and was burned. The
remains identified by pistol, which had been
loaned TO him by friend. He was often called
Jim Lundy in consequence of having brother Of
that name, for whom he was frequently taken


II is said the fire originated from a stove-pipe
filled with SCOT, which carelessly thrust
through the covering of the back kitchen. II was
heard roaring by person in the next house, and
the noise was so great he mistook il for the rumb-
ling Of the stage coach. In about ten minutes aE
forwards the cry of fire was heard. II then spread
so rapidly that persons living in the vicinity of
where the fire commenced had scarcely time to
escape.
