| MR. EDIroRs:--I observed an article going
the rounds Of the papers within the last week,
stating that stone had been thrown at MIR.
! Hawkins while lecturng in the open air al
Montreal. The writer Of the article seemed TO
consider, that the place where such an out
rage could be perpetrated, must be inhabited
| in part by demons. in human form but unfor-
tunat.ly, Montreal is not the only place where
such oulrages are perpetated. Here in Wash
ing,on CITY, the rum sellers and their minions,
| have several times since the commencement OF
the reform, thrown stones, eggs, and other
missiles at the advocates Of the cause. On
last Thursday night, al the corner Of 9th and
D streets, stone weighing pound was hurl-
ed at the temperance Lecturer while holding
a meeting at that place, and passed between
two persons, who occupied the stand at that
time, striking the lamp, and breaking the glass.
That the creature who threw the stone, came
from some one of the neighboring gfog shops,
with which it abounds, there can be no doubt.
What can be thought OF men, and cause,
which uses such means to silence their oppo-
nents2 Throwing stones OF pound in weight
children, and that too atnght, under the COW
er OF darkness. A being who could commit
such an outrage, is worse than .Merican rob
ber. The stone is in the possession of the
temperance men, and may be put in the Ma
tional Gallery, las standing proof of the infa-
nous rum traffic Five dollars reward will be
given for the detection of the ruf1ian, who threw
the stone. MORAL SUASION.

as volunteers, in beautiful fatigue uniform,
are to parade. and believe troop Of horse
is in progress of organization for the occasion.
This troop, though organized for the day only,
and of course not regularly drilled and speci-

pearance, the dress agreed upon being neat
and tasteful.

counterfeit! As faithful chronicers of impor-
tant events, we copy it, as follows:


.a,, admirable Counterfeit One fine sunny
day last week, we met Plumbe in Broadway
Pumbe, the unrivalled Dagurreotype Profes-
sor. Come, Thompson, walk into my gallery,
says Plumbe, i want to show you good coun-
terfeit. We walked in-sit down, says he
head a little up and to the left--fx the eyes on
that jack-knife for one minute; we did so-all
is done, says he, and disappeared through a
door. In five minutes he returned, with the
best daguerreotype counterfeit of bis imagina-
BILE. Zounds, says we, that might be passed
on our wife for the genuine; you are DANCE
rous man, sir, we shall lose our identity, if you
can make Thompsons in this manner what will
become of shiaplaster banks and bankers; he
laughed, and we left. To-day, a friend informs
US, we are exhibited in Plumbe's Gallery, 25l
Broadway, by the side of jackson, TYLER, Polk,
Calhoun, Webster, Clay, and Cass. If any Of
our friends from the North, South, East, or
West are detained from home longer than thew
expected, they should step into Plumbe's and
have q. fac similc taken to send to their wives
as substitute. atr. ...,...


HoRRID MURDER time ago tailor
of bad character, named Oliver Norris, was
compelled, on account of suspicious of miscon-
duct, TO leave Russellville, Illinois. He was
afterwards taken back, tried, and acquitted.
He then went to York, Illinois, where he re-
manned till recently; when, ahorse being stolen
and a friend of his disappearing at the same
time, he was suspected of being accessory to
the crime. He was consequently seized, fog
ged, and ducked in the Wabash, the lynchers
offered to release him if he would name his ac-
completes. He named some of the most re-
spectacle citizens of the county, among whom
were John G. Long and r. G. Wade After
his release, he returned with his wife to Rus
sellville, where he readily admitted that he had
slandered Long and Wade, alleging in his own
justification, that he had been compelled to give
names, and that the persons named by him
were his enemies. Wade on hearing this, swore
that Norris should leave Russellville immediate
ly Norris wife being in delicate health, and the
weather inclement, some of the citizens re-
monstrated with Wade, proposing to let Nor
ris remain short time and then send him off
quietly. Thereupon Wade became still more
exasperated, and taking Long with him went to
Russellville, hitched his horse in the street.
and swore he would kill Norris at sight. Some
of the citizens gave Norris money to bear his
expenses, and advised him to depart immedi-
diately, which he was about TO do, when he
met in the street Long and Wade. They or
dered him 10 give up his weapons, which he
readily did, handing his pistol to Wade Long
then examined the condition of his own pis-
tol, and tried the lock deliberately Norris,
after giving up his pistol, raised his hands in
the most suppliant manner, walked backwards
and begged for his life on any condition. Wade
first drew club, then ran forward and struck
Norris with his fist, which turned him round
facing Long, who, cooking his pistol, took de-
liberate aim, and shot him through the head.
He fell, and expired in about an hour after.
Long and Wade both left, and at the last dates
had not been heard of. -H taa"

Loss OF THE GEN. TAYLOR.


The following, from our correspondent, furnishes
some interesting news from Pensacola:


.a& UNITED STATEs NAvY-YAnp.


Pensacola, October l2, 1886


GENTLEMEN: On Saturday night, the 10th inst.
between and O'Clock, the United States steamer
General Taylor took fire soi.gside the wharf of ths
yard, and in Short time burnt to the watsr,s edee.
Great exertions were made by the officers and ma
chancs of the yard to save the boat About 400
men, with three engines, and abundance Of hose,
were kept at work for about an hour ard half,
but all to no purpose The flames pre- vailed and
the boat is considered total loss. Her engine
may. be Of some value, but must be much damaged
by the fire.


There are many conjectures ms to how the fire
occurred Most people believe it was the work of
an ncendiary, as Mr., Alexander, ono Of the engin-
GERS, on this occasion took unusual care to nut out
all the fires, the next day being Sunday, hon no
uss was to be made Of ths boat. The loss 10 our
""Uncle"" will be from twelve to fifteen thousand
dollars. and, as the saving is, 'no insurance.

things at the seat of war, as decidedly uncom-
Portable. The unusually early rise Of the Rio
Grande, which has uverflowed its banks, and
inundated the surrounding country, not only
materially retarded the operation of the Army
but leave the camps in a most pitabe condl

and water. People at home, who have good
dry beds, with every other comfort, will daily
appreciate the patriotism Of those brave men,
who are willing TO endure such hardships in
the service Of their country.

DIR. sweet, ""The Natural Bone Setter""
We ask attention 10 the following communi-
cation from DR.. Smith. The reverend gentls(
mans statement is confirmatory Of what we


had previously heard, touching The unrivalled


skill Of DR.. Sweet in his useful profession. AS


DIR. Smith suggests, all in this region who are
suffering from dlslocaioas, should call on DR..
Sweet during his sojourn in Lynchburg:
MESsRs. EDITORS: | avail myself of the
privilege OF your columns to discharge duty,
which, in the providence of God, owe TO all
who are suffering from disIocations.


In 1888 was thrown from nv barouche,
and seriously ipjured-bones broken, and Joints
dIsocaled. My left hip joint has always slip
ped an inch. al least an inch, at every step in
walking; and, o. consequence, was of but little
Use 10 me. On Saturday last, engaged the
services OF DR.. Waterman Sweet, the natural
bone setter. and IN less than half an hour, he
reduced the dislocaion Of each hip Joint; ad-
jus'cd my knees, and one of the bones of nv
tgh' fool, and put ne erect and square upon
my feet, as much SO as ever was in nv life.

cure OF one OF the bones In 1888 He accom-
pIIshed every thing without giving me any
PAN worthy o! notice, and evidently upon the
most simple and rational principles, fully illus
trltlng most clearly, that in such cases as mine,
al least, the method Of reducing Joints by the

We ask attention to the following communi-

mans statement is conhrmatory of what we
had previously heard, touching The unrivalled
skill OF DIR. Sweet in his useful profession. As
DIR. Smith suggests, all in this region who are
suffering from dislocaiions, should call on DR..
Sweet during his sojourn in Lynchburg:

RIoT AND MURDER IN ILLINOIS. Ion the 18th
inst, serious outrage. resulting In murder,
occurred al Edwardsvle, ILL., The ST. Louis
Republican says:


James Duncan, a farmer, somewhat noto-
rious as a quarrclsome and bad character, hav-
ing some difficulty with those in the neghbor-
hood, had been warned 10 leave, and threaten
ed with death if he remained. Early yesterday
morning he was informed that large party
were coming down, and was advised 10 leave,
which he refused and prepared TO defend him
self. Accompanied by woman who had lived
with him, both armed with guns, they left the
house to so fishing, when they met the party
some twenty or thirty in number, on their way
TO the house as they approached, the woman
discharged her gun in their midst, Woundlng
one OF The party very seriously, and immedl-
atey after volley was returned by which
Duncan was instantly killed, The Top Of his
head being shot away and a large number Of
shot took effect in his body The woman re-
ceived bah in her breast, from which it is
supposed she cannot recover. Duncan had no
family. and the woman was living with him
as housekeeper.

MORE OUTRAGEs AGAINST THE MoRMoNs -
BY the ST. Croix, which arrived last evening
from the upper Mississippi, says the ST. Louis
Reporter OF the j 9Th instant, we have received
Circular, issued al Nauvoo, July 10Th. cali
ing on the order loving citizens OF Hancock, TO
assemble and aid in suppressing, as far as pos
sible, existing outbreaks against The Mormons
remaining in the vicinity Of Nauvco, and


those friendly 10 them. 1t would seem that,
owing to the scarcity Of farming hands in that
neighborhood, few Mormons have been EN-
poyed by the farmers in gathering their crops.
This has given umbrage to the lynchers, who
recently assembled in considerable force, and
going 10 harvest field where some six or eight
persons were at work, some OF them new cit
izens, inflicted summary aud dreadful punish
ment on them all. We further learn from the
clerk OF the 81. Crolx, says the Reporter, that
a party Of some eighty men from Nauvoo had
turned out, and captured five or six of the
principal rioters. EIiil aatr .


SHOCKING TRAGEDY We learn, SAYS The
ST. Louis Organ, that man by the name of
James Duncan, who resi- ted near CollnsyIe
ILL.,, when short distance from his dwelling
which he had just left in company with Miss
Page, to 60 fishing, was attacked on the morn
ing of the 18th by about forty armed men,
some disguised, and shot by several of them.
He was instantly killed, his body being per
forated by thirty or forty bullets. Miss Page
was wounded in the breast. She fought
bravely, shooting and MORALLY .wounding one
of the party. She afterwards fled 10 the woods,
in her fright, and has NOT been since SEEM
The murderers all fled, after committing their
dabollcal outrage, and no cause for the deed. is
knows.


INDIAN ATTAcK-lt is rumored, says the
Iowa Hawk Eye, that the Indians are collect
ing 10 considerable force in the vicinity of Fort
Snelling with the intention, il is said, Of at
tacking the Fort, in consequence Of the de-
ention of one OF the Sioux, who had been
given up and held in custody either as host
age, or for being concerned in the murder of a
chief, some time since. A demand for his
release was sent 10 some days ago, which was
refused.

the intelligence from England, published in yester.
days aud to-day's paper, and received by the last
steamer, is generally esteemed favorable TOR the
continuance Of peace, and the amcabe settlement
of the Oregon question. The British government,
il itappears quiet and pacific in its outward demean-
or, but is still acting with great deal of energy,
IN the dock yards. The British press is increasing
its hostile demonstrations and yet, notwithstand ing
the position OF the question in England and the
United States, there yet turks suspicion IN the
mind that all will not end as easily as il seems


The tone of the London Times, and other portions
OF the London press, IL very remarkable. Their
hostile feelings have increased during the last few
weeks, but as it is more under the influence OF the
monopoly of the Hudson Bay Company, than il is
swayed by the moderation and Cancellation Of the
great commercial and manufacturing interests IN
the centre of England, we must make due allow
ances for their ebullitions on the Oregon question
The London Times, Is undoubtedly the organ of the
Hudson Bay Company, and its wishes aud purpos es
may be considered identical with those of that mo-
nopoly. In one of the last papers issued from that
establishment, mode of settlement is Indicated
which may be considered the ult matum OF the Hud-
son Bay Company, provided the British government
accept it,


According to those indications, they claim down
by the 49h degree from the Rocky mountains TO the
shores OF the Columbia, and then to verge south.
crly to the straits Of ST. Juan De Fuca, embracing
the free navigation of the Columbia river to its
mouth, and likewise the whole of Vancouver Island
1t this line be adopted by the British government as
Its utmatum, we very much doubt whether there
can be settlement such oasis BY the United
States. We doubt whether Mr.. Polk would n OF re.
ject such proposition and he were to accept it.
we doubt whether it would be ratified by the Senate


These Developments and propositlons coming
from the press, tngsd with the policy of the Hud-
son Bay Company, may, however, be modified,
when the great commercial and manufacturing in
terests OF the centre OF England begin to move in
the matter, and operate the British ministry
ITSELF The interest Of the Hudson Bay Company,
as represented by the London press, and as adopted
oy Inc British government is a mere drop in the
bucket, compared with the interests of the CON-
mercial and manufacturing classes of England.
The meeting of the merchants of London, at
which It was recommended to the ministry to ap-
point SIR Henry Potttnger as proper person to act
as negonator between the two governments, is pro-
baby The germ of great movement, that will be
followed up throughout the country, by the CON-
mercial and manufacturing interests of England on





countries will remain in a state Of irritation doubt
and uncertainty, as injurious to the commercial
interests of both, as il we were positive and GER
tam OF a conflict in a brief space of time. It's
true, the commercial intelligence of the two coun.
trles understands the relative position Of the govern
ment OF each on this important question and,
although this irritation may or may not have
great effect on commercial Interests and comm er-
al ene ia ind,
or diplomatic movements, Is not properly UNDER
stood.


Thus, the two countries hope for an eventual ad-
iustment of all difficulties, and continuance of
peace NAM are yet fearful that some overruling
destiny may nerpcse some little, slight and evanes-
cent obstacles, which change The history OF empires
and precipltate nations into the depths OF war and
barbarism The whole question is in an un-
settled condition in both countries. We can
not affirm with any degree of certainty that
we shall have war or peace. We may hope,
but hope is like the colors Of the rainbow, evan es.
cent, after the shower has ceased. The probablli-
ties are just strong in favor of no settlement as
OF settlement; and the chances may be considered
equal that the question will be precpiated into our
elections, during the next few years. If this should
be tne case, between the two countries will re-
suit, probably, at the end of not many years.


The PAVEMENT IN BRoApwAY.-We understand
that the design of the city fathers in leaving Broad

vedness, ls that IN the event of war with England,
and in case the enemy effect landing in New

be arrested by blocking up all the other avenues,
and compelling them to take their march through
Broadway, where, es they founder among the nu-
merous pitfalls which at present give more pic-
turesque than pleasing appearance to that thorough
fare, they will become easy prey to our citizen
