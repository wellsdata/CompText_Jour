It has never fallen to our lot to record
an instance of self murder, attended with
more distressing circumstances, than that
which We are now about to relate.-OnI
the morning of Monday, 9th ult. Mrs. Eli
zabeth Ballard, of Gates county, N. G..
rose about the dawn OF day, and after con-
versing few minutes with her father, Mr.


Robert Riddick, at whose house she was
on visit with her husband, stepped into
a room where several of the family were
sleeping, took gun, left the house unno


ticed, and in an instant the report was
heard. The alarm drew the family to the
door, within few steps of which her body


was discovered weltering in blood ! 1t is
supposed that she applied her toe to the
trigger, and put the muzzle of the gun


close to her throat, the load having passed


entirely TIN ough, which caused her death
Iinstantaneously. We will attempt no de-


scriptior of the heart-rending scene: let


the reader imagine himself in the situa-

an aifectionate parent, and sincere friend

| ANECDOTE or GEN. MORGAN.
The truth of the following anecdote,
saws the Southern Patriot, may be relied
upon as coming from respectable eye wit
nesses, whose names are let with the edl-
tor. w. u. j.


In the month of June, 1882, Gov. Ma
Ithews of South. and Gov. Martins of North
Carolina, came to the resolution to ia Sc
a force to conquer the tories, under major


Ganey, upon Little Pee Dee and Drowning


Greek they had not observed the truce


entered into with Col. P. Horny the last


year, and had been troublesome in COM
mitting depredations upon the property OF
elthe citizens of the two states. vi this
{ Joint expedition, Gen. Marion was to have
"" the chief command. Proclamations were
: issued by the Governors, Offering tree
s sIpartlon to all tories who should submit
land lay down their arms, with few ex-
!. ceptions.
Gen. Marion moved on at the head OF
'|his brigade from the Santee to Wither-
l-lspoon's Ferry on Lynch's Greek, where he
l-lay two days waiting communication he
i expected from Ganey, and collecting pro-
II visions on the Pedee. On the third day
he marched to Bunch's mill, II miles,
: where he held conferences with Ganey,
. who agreed to surrender his whole force
I. upon the terms offered by the proclama--
g tions; at this place the tories commenced
ellaying down their arms, and among others
Is who surrendered was captain Butler, who
8 had murdered lieut.. Gordon and party IN
!. the winter of 1880, upon Lynch Greek, al
:. : ter they had been made prisoners, under a
IF ta-
r-Iknown that Butler had surrendered, there
1eIarose (quite an uncommon thing) meet
Yelling in camp. Gordon had been with Ma
of rion from the first Of his warfare until
:, killed, and was greatly beloved by the re-
.,latives of himself and his party, consist
VI ing of Marion's long tried and best friends,
III were at the head of the mutineers. At
C., first Marion sent one of his confidential
s-ioficers to quel the tumult, but without
e, the desired effect. He had placed Butler
lin his hut, the only castle he had, and the
!. mutineers sent him word that he must be
H,delivered up to them. Marion thea be-
III came more angry than usual, and calling
VI his messmates around him, resolved to
us defend Butler to the last, and for this pur-
o. pose he attempted to draw his sword
an But 10 although the weapon had been in
. so many battles, it had so seldom made ITS
: temperance that the blade was locked up
- in the scabbard by sheer rust, and the ge-
an neral could not by his efforts extrlcate it.
He called his servant Oscars to his assist


ance, but neither could Oscar prevail


The weapon refused its aid against the ge-


neral's old and long tried friends. Al
ih- length heats foot oil was applied, which
ist. excited seine smiles--not mirth; and the


blade was extricated from the scabbard
o. In the mean time, the generals anger had
me time to cool, and the mutineers. finding he
me had placed Butler in his hut, respected
ETY. the sanctuary; although to the south il


was as open to view and the bullet, as II
will was to the winds and rains of Heaven.-
'ou Such was the peculiar character and hon


orabIe feeling Of this distinguished parti


san. Perhaps many of the readers of his
life would have this anecdote and some


others suppressed; but the value of blog-


raphy consists in truth--not in its being
7. and unmeaping eulogy. The very name
ris. of Marion had been sufficient to intimidate"
