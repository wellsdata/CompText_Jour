The Editor of the Wilmington Staw is fright
cncd He has heard that Wade Hampton, Ben
Hill and others are to deliver speeches in the
Northern States for Seymour and Blair, and he
writes as follows:


BAD PoLICY.-We see it reported that Gen.
Wade Hampton and Hon. B. b. Hill are expect
ed to deliver speeches in the Northern States in
behalf of Seymour and Blair, We trust the re-
port is incorrect; but if not, we join with the
Richmond Wing and Lynchburg Republicass in
condemnation of any such policy. We think
sufficent.damage has been done the cause of
Seymour and Blair by speeches made in the
South, without bringing this source of irritation
right before the eyes of the Northern people.
1t matters not how conservative may be the
speeches, the men are quite sufficient to arouse
the bad passions OF the North to point that will
result in serious injury to our prospects of sue
cess in the Presidential election. f


We have no doubt the DisuniOnists would pay
ten thousand dollars Tor every speech delivered
in Northern State by Hampton, Forrest, Toombs,
or Semmes.
II we expect to elect our candidates we must
he governed by principles of common sense.
Surely the Democratic leaders do not appreciate
the fate that awaits us if Grant is elected, or
they would not contribute SO much to that result

The fourteenth article OF the Oonstitution has

The friends Of Mr. Williamson furnish the
following relation TO this case: ssThe follow.
ing Is brief statement OF the transaction upon
which Virginia court has based its charge of
""obtaining money under false pretenoes""'
against Mr.. Williamson, member OF the Vir.
ginia Constitutional Convention, and since
nominated by Gov. Wells to Gen. Stoneman,
for appointment to the Judgeship OF the 18th
Judicial District of Virginia. uuOn the recon.
mendation Of distin guished members of the
bar, and OF the Judiciary, both State and Fed
eral, including the personal Recommendation Of
Chief Justice Chase. About the year 1855, 8.
ID. Williamson agreed with Jesse Hane, Of
Lynchburg, Va, to pay him $40 as rent for
his house, payment to be made in bonds, to be
deposited at time OF possession. By an after
understanding, Williamson put gas fixtures in
Hane's house, to be allowed out Of rent. Will
hanson after received in goods from obligor of
one OF the deposited bonds, amount 20 ad vancsd
by him for said fixtures. Williamson, after an
occupancy OF two wears, was succeededi in said
house by Lieut. r. L. Brown. Brown, before
taking possession, learned Of Hane that the gas
fixtures put in by Williamson would go with
the house, as they hac been, or would be, al
lowed for upon settlement. Hane receivrd the
house from Williamson and leased to Brown;
did not then nor after, during his (Hane's) life
time, intimate that he had any further demand
on him (Williamson) for rent, or on any other
ground Whatsoever. One Booker, who admin
istered on Hane's estate, was informed Of the
foregoing facts, and referred to Lieut.. Brown
for confirmation Of statement. Williamson has
since resided, now about ten years, in the imme-
diate vicinity Of Lynchburg, and not an intima-
ton on the part Of said Booker, that he had
ought against him. During Williamson's ab-
sence from home, and without notice, or
any intimation whatever, the report goes out
sentc and indicted as above.

KINsTON n. c., May 20, 1858.


A youthful victim Of the scafrod to-day expated
crime that would scarcely have merted so terrible
and revolving punishment in many other States in
the Union. But North Carolina Of all others is cele-
brated for the summary manner with which crime is
punished, and the state is little remarkable for
its adherence to the more barbarous modes that have
attached to new settlements where lynch law fol-
lowed the commission of deed detrimental to the
good order and peace OF society. No peniten-
tiary, In which criminals could be immured
atone for offences OF deep cast against the laws
OF God and man, has ever been known In the North
State, and the convicted offender was either sum.
marily executed on the scafold If he deserved that
extreme penalty; whipped at the public whipping
post, measure OF eternal degradation, or branded
In the stocks with hot iron, when the crime was
henous enough to be expiated with life upon the
scatfod.


These two latter rclicts ~ barbarism have been
totally abolished since the close Of the war while
reconstruction was i'm progress under the manage
ment OF General Daniel T.. Sickles. who issued an
edict forbddiag such modes OF punishment: and IL
is remarkable fact that this state since that order
promulgated. has been more prolific in exc
cuiions than any other half dozen combined.
some might suppose that the scanold's victims here
were mostly negroes. because or the political pro-
clves OF that unfortunate race since their emanci-
patton; but such Is not the case. Whites rs well
blacks share alike the terrible death penalty and as
the juries here are mixed, impartial though stern
justice Is nleted out 10 all.


THE CRIME


for which the victim to-day suffered the scafYold
is one that under the old laws Of the State pun
ishable with the extreme penalty. Arson destroying
not only property, but sometimes life and always
endangering the latter. had been clearly proven to
have been committed by the condemned some eight
months prior TO this date, and an acc0mplice in the
deed was also sentenced TO be executed to-day. Ex-
ecutiye cemency was, however, applied for In behalf

the condemned, was about eighteen years OF age of
medium height and build, and not by any means a
repulsve or criminal looking negro. His very youth
would have banished the idea that ne could have
perpetrated the crime with which he was CHARGED:
but persistent denial during the trial OF his guilt
where the evidence was so strong impressed many
unfavorably against him. Az the day for the execu.
ton came nearer he became penitent ana was fre-
quently seen engaged IN prayer; and the last night
make his peace with God.


THE GALLOws.


large concourse OF his colored friends male and
female, had assembled to witness the final tragedy
and as the condemned wus led forth to the galiows
surrounded by guard, they pressed eagerly forward

these poor ignorant Africans a. they viewed the con-

point his numerous audience, for Immediately before
tne death sentence was read George Washington
declared that he alone had committed the crime ne
was about 70 expiate. He said he had made nls
peace with his Maker and was willing to die as the
law had decreed After a few Hnal leavetakings the
death sentence read the fatal drop FELL and soon
the soul OF the condemned man was In eternity. He
was STILL and after hanging twenty minutes life was
declared extinct and the body was cut down. Thus
ended The existence Of misguided and unfortunate

questing the President to interpose
his official authority to effect the i'm

Warner and w. j. Nagle and any
other American citizens arrested in
Ireland, under the Habeas Corpus
Act, and now imprisoned without suf-
fcient grounds to charge them with
the commission of any Ofense against

After remarks by Wood, Shanks,
Brooks, Banks and-Orth, the joint
resolution was passed unanimously.


Paine's joint resolution in reference
to Robert Lynch, of Milwaukee, also

Wood then introduced the joint
resolution of which. he had given no

Bingham suggested the omission of
the words, Interpose his official

sooner the Army can be reduced, and our ex-
Denscs brought back to the StGtu quo ante bcttHm


While we must look at Gov. Seymour's spe-
cifc for the national ills as a bit of harmless
Guackery, we admire the ingenuity with which,
like n good doctor he strives to make ms pa
tient duly sensible of his miserable condition.
lie reminds the West that that section furnished
too many men during the war, but he
neglects TO inform us whether the South
furnished too many men, lie reminds
the East that it has been cursed by a depreci-
ated paper currency, and laments that the
West has not had as much of this curse as 1t
needed to give it prosperity. One would thlnh
that if our paper currency were an eVll thc
less the West had of it the better. He tells lis
that we have two kinds of currency, gold for
the bond-holder and paper for the laDoferi
but in the next breath he states that as
nearly all the debt is held by saw
ings banks and other trust companies as
trustees for the aboring class-there being
2.5OO,OO0 laborcrs thus interested in the national
debt-therefore the bOndholder and laborer are
one. His statement that the soldier, pensioncr,
or laborer who takes paper dollar loses cach
time fourth of its value, Is an error so trans
parent as to convict its author of either gross
stupidity or recllessncss. Soldiers wages, pen
sions, and rates of labor all rose III nominal
amount as paper deprecated so as to remain
of at least as great gold values. If we had
never left the gold standard the laborer who
now gets S. day in paper would have got
but 80 or.Sl 80 in gold. Whatever the evils OF
our financial condition, they cannot be cured
by CxaggeratiOn.


Gov. Seymour truly says that our bonds and
currency are deprecated, because ON national
credit is impaired. TO his questions, why 1t Is
so impaired, and why we are now paying SIX
pcr cent coin interest on a debt of $500
100000. we answer. it is because the Demo
cratic party was so numerous and powerful
that when, in the year 1860, it reheed against
the Government, and fought to dissolve the
Union, it cost the loyal people a million OF
lives. and twice the amount of the National
debt, and four years OF carnage TO suppress 1t.
Had the Democratic party been fewer in num-
bers its rebellion would have been earlier sup
pressed.


We sympathize with his regrets that Prcsi-
dent johnson has been so manaclcd that he
can no longer punish crime or protect inno-
""ccncc;r but our grief is assuagcd by the
thought that he can no longer punish innocence
or protect crime. This cloud, at least, has
lining of very pure silver.


His statement that the tariffs have swept
away all American ships does injustice to
the achievements of those gallant Democratic
privateers Lynch, Semmes, Maury. Driine, and
the rest, who, supplied By BRUSH traders
with the means and encouraged by Northern
Democrats platforms with the motive to carry
ON thcir warfare, either captured all American
vessels outright or compelled them to sell out
or register as British vessels Such agencies
may be styled tariffs 10y speakers whose ora
toIic license approaches that of Gov Seymour,
but they were tariffs of wholly Democratic
origin.


Looking at Gov. Scymour's speech as the
opening act in the drama of the Democratic
National Convention it has merits which, as
political argument or oratorical effort, it would
not possess. BY seeking to rally the Conscrva-
tive Democracy on the single point of hostility
TO the Reconstruction policy of Congress and
TO Universal Suffrage, it aims to demolsh
whatever feeble efforts may be making To
nominate Mr.. Chase, and, by opposing the re-
pudation theories of Pendlcton, it attempts to
consolidate the Democracy of the Eastern
States in opposition to the more reckless and
irresponsible politician of Ohio. In short, If
the Democratic party really agree with his
speech, they must nominate Mr.. Seymour, since
no other available candidate occupies the
same position. We regard the effort
as bold and well-time bid by Gov.
Seymour for his own nomination. Whether the
Western influence will be strong enough to de-
feat il remains to be seen. There is ample
time for similar illumination from Mr.. Pcndle
ton. And perhaps Andrew Johnson might be
persuaded to make few remarks, in his capacity
as private citizen.

gerty, James Murray, David H. Smyth, Thomas
Honly, Francis Fitzpatrick, Daniel O'Leary,
John Nugent, David Lynch, John Graham We
have only room for the following extracts, which
we commend to our Irish fellow-citizens


THE RE AL PRINCIPLES OF THE so-cALLED DEMOCRACY.


But to return, if you please, to this precious
Democratic or conservative party OF our own
time and country. Have you, who year after
year vote without hesitation or question every
ticket labelled Democratic, ever considered what
the real principles of this party are, who its
leaders are, what its sympathy with the cause
of Ireland has been? No otherwise you would
have long since turned from it with loathing and
disgust. Are you aware that it is controlled by
moneyed aristocrats, who make its policy sub
servient to their own selfish ends? What ex-
preston of sympathy have you heard from these
men for those who strive for Ireland freedom
Why the very man who at this moment holds the
highest official position in the Democratic party
is the agent of English capitalists, who have
millions at stake, in the preservation OF the
British Empire whole and intact. To suppose
that such a man would be friendly to the cause
of Ireland's freedom would be to fly in the face
of all human experience.


The policy of the Democratic leaders is to in
fame your prejudices against the negro, in order
to forward their own political fortunes, while IN
their hearts they despise the laborer whether he
be white or black.


What was the aim of the men who endeavored
to establish the Southern Confederacy but to
erect an oligarchy, where the few would be ag-
grandzed at the expense of the many, and where
capital would not only control but own labor.


They designed, by reopening the slave trade,
IrAlz xx,,t oil anH W
completely destroy the system of free white la
bor, as witness the article in the Charleston
Mercury, just before the war; entitled Philoso-
ply of Secession, by L. w Spratt, of South
Carolina, where, referring to the Southern Con-
federacy, he says: 81 regard the slave trade as
the true test of its integrity. If that be right,
then slavery is right, but not otherwise. re-
gard the constitutional prohibition as great
calamity"" (referring to the act prohibiting the
importation of slaves).


These men despised laborers of every class
and condition, as may be seen by their sEeering
illusions to Northern &C mudsills, ""greasy me-
chanics,"" ""close-fsted farmers etc. And were
they not for years in the closest affliation with
the Democratic party? Did they not shape its
policy? Were they not, as exponents of its prin-
ciples, looked up to oracles by their Northern
allies +? And can you doubt that, if their polt-
ical privileges were restored, they would again
be found foremost in its ranks 2


You were told that if the negroes were eman-
cipated they would flock to the North and CON-
pete successfully with the Irish and German Ia
borer. Yet the threatened exodus did not oc-
cur Was it because the promised Moses proved
recreant?


If anything could tend to drive the negroes
from the South, it would be the return to power
of the rebel element, and consequent inaugura-
ton of persecution and oppression If they are
treated with any reasonable degree of fairness
they will be sure to prefer the cougenial climate
of the South to the more rugged one OF the
North.


In addition to its unpatriotic, if not absolutely
dsloyal, course during the war, the Democratic
party would now virtually repudiate the honest
debt of the nation for which the national faith Is
pledged, and thereby bring on financial crisis
whose effects would be sure to be felt by alH and
by none more than by the laboring class. This
hateful doctrine of national dishonesty is the
principal stock in trade of the leading Demo-
cratic candidate for the Presidency.


APPEAL TO THE INTELLIGENCE AND MANHOOD OF
IRIsH-BoRN AMERICANS.


What considerations then, of either duty or in
terest, can prompt you to act with this degener-
ate faction? Are you enraptured with the spir-
tied foreign policy of the conservative john
son, the anxiety which he has displayed to re-
lieve such of our countrymen as have come un-
der the ban of British law, and the admirable
manner in which his creatures Seward and
Adams have upheld the honor OF the United
States in their dealings with our old enemy Or
mayhap you applaud the scurrilous abuse with
which the Democratic orators and press have
saluted the poor, MANNED veterans, whose only
fault was that they periled life and limb in de-
fense of this land, the last refuge of liberty on
earth.


In conclus sion, we would ask you Irishmen, to
think we'll on these things.


Do not be swept along in the tide of prejudice
and intolerance, but assert your manhood, and
shake off the trammels of party in which you
have been too long entangled.


Free yourselves from the control of the men
by whom you are led, and who laugh at you for
your credulty.


Concede to others that which yeu demand for
yourselves, and give helping hand to push for
ward the, car of Freedom, which is even now
slowly, but steadily advancing overturning as
it goes the eminences on which Tyranny has
erected her altars, and bring joy and good It'd
ngs to the oppressed of all climes."

Contractions Of the Currency.


The answer to this question that came from
Washington Immediately after the great Wall
street panic was this: adopt Mr.. Lynch's ""au--
tomatic self adjusting scheme""-issue bonds


at low rate OF interest, payable on demand
in greenbaeks. The facility with which the
bonds and the currency are exchangeable will


give us an amount of currency approximsting


very nearly to the actual business wants OF


the country at any given time. The wisdom


of the plan seemed suddenly to strike the


whole country as it had previously struck sew


eral eminent financiers who plagiarized 1t and


incorporated il into their own incongruous


schemes after it had been introduced as an in


dependent measure by Mr.. Lynch.


But just now there comes doubtful ruInor
from Washington to the effect that Seo-


retary McCulloch does not approve 'le mea-
sure, not believing that it VIII nave 'ne ehecs
TO prevent controctons and expansions of the
currency Recent events nave not done much
| TO exalt Mr.. McCuIloch's views in the minds


of the peope But his position gives weight
| ,o any views he may express Oh financial
topics and it is certainly worth while to re-


print extracts from Mr.. Lynch's speech of last


March, showing how his measure will have


tendency to effect the desired object. As it


is one of the purposes of the. bill to DESTROY
the dangerously large discretionary power
now vested by law in the Secretary of the
Treasury it is not perhaps very surprising that
it should not strike that official favorably.


We quote from Mr.. Lynch's speech:


The bill ""to prevent undue expansion and


contraction of the currency"" provides for reg


ulating the volume of the currency by the on


Grafton of the laws OF trade and the business


wants of the country rather than by arbitrary


enactments or the exercise of discretionary


power by the Secretary OF the Treasury. and


also provides means for the investment of


capital temporarily dle-liberating it when


the needs OF business demand, thus making


the Government greenback security as flexible


and adaptable to the business wants of the


country as that Of the national banks.


This bill provides for the issue of coupon
bonds to the amount of $500, ,000, 900, of denOm-
nations of 500 and the multiple of $10O, pay
able on demand at the Treasury of the United
States, with the interest quarter yearly at the
| rate of four per cent. in lawful money. 1t also
provides that these bonds shall be issued to
any person applying for them at the Treasury
of the United States upon paying for the same





thereon in United States notes; and that the
holder of the bonds may re-exchange them at
his option, receiving for them the par value
and accrued interest to the amOnnt of any
overdue and unpaid coupon. These bonds
have no connection with those representing
the funded debt. They are all of one class,
and all convertible at the will OF the holder
| There can be no confusion as to the amount
| out. There must always be just the amount
of bonds to supply the demand, and Just
| OraaOb3ckS nnOuUh in the Trna acurv tn
all the bonds which can be presented. There
| is no casting of interest on incoming bonds as


the. overdue and unpaid coupon, added to
| their price, will just repre- sent the amount
| due. All accrued interest on a bond present
| ed for redemption, less than a full coupon,
| would be so much gain for the Government
| and would help to pay the expense of making
| the conversion. To great extent, probably
the bonds would come n only on quarter days.
| Only on issuing would it be necessary to com
pute interest. .....-
The substantial features of this bill have
been adopted in several bills which have been


introduced during the present session. They
| have been incorporated into the funding bill
| recently reported to the Senate by the Finance
| Committee, (section five and also by the gem
| tleman from Massachusetts Mr.. Butlerl into
| his financial scheme"" and by him very hap.
| PLY christened the automatic, self adiusting
system of finance"" r. ..igo. .7. =
| This bill having received such distinguished
Endorsement here, and having been approved
| BY the leading journals of the country, L CON
| hdently expect to See it enacted into law dur
ing the present session: and, believing it has
not been improved by the alterations to which
| it has been subjected, 1 trust it may be passed
| substantially as introduced. ll-sr. +
| The Senate bill, to which have alluded,
| provides for the consolidation of the whole ma
tional debt into one description of bonds, reg
istered or coupon, and then by section five,
which contains the principal feature of this
bill, allows such bonds TO be converted and re-
converted to the amount of $500, 100000 There
are several objections to this section of the
Senate blll First, as is SO clearly set forth in
the report OF the Finance Committee accom-
panying the bill, the currency should be kept
as distinct as possible from the funded debt
Second, there is no necessity for having these
| convertible bonds bear the same rate of inter-
est as the bonds which represent the funded
oeDt. Ihlrd, the bonds representing the fund
| ed debt must be paid, principal and interest,
| in coin, portion of them must be registered,
| and provision made for changing from coupon
to registered under certain circumstances


Inc interest is made payable semi-annually,
which would involve great labor and ineon-
venience in making the transfer, and also la
Dor and delay in casting the interest, day by
day, as the bond may be presented Fourth,
tnere would be no gain in interest to the Gov
ernmcnt to pay for the transfer and retransfer
OF the bonds. Fifth, the amount of bonds out
6eing about twenty five hundred million dol
lars, and only $400,000,O00 convertible and re.
convertible, no one would have any assurance


that his bonds could be exchanged, as the limit
OF $4OO 100000 might be reached just wher the
holder of the bond might want to convert in
to money. The bonds, being exempt from all


taxation, would be purchased at the Treasury
just before local assessments of taxes were


made, kept long enough to get the advantage


OF the exemption, and then reoonverted into


money.


The gentleman from Massachusetts has, in


adopting the principles of the bill, only amend


ed it so far as to provide for the issue of an


additional $3O0O00,O00 legal-tender notes. The


proposition involved in this amendment is
simply to issue an additional $500 900


greenbacks without any provisions for, and
apparently without any intention Of, redeem
ing them in specie. To this L am opposed
We should first reach specie payments and


then supply the country with Just SO much


currency as can be maintained on specie ba-
| sis and no more -t ---TI7. - -."

Sixth Ward Anti. r adic al Club.


Last evening the second meeting of the Sixth
Ward Anti-Radical Club was held at Odd Eel.
lows Hall, corner of oth and q streets, NAVY
fard-Mr. John Little, President, in the chair,
and James n. Dalton, Secretary.
Mr.. Dalton, from the committee on the con
sntution, reported that the Western States
Anti-Radicai Clnb were preparing a general
plan Of organization for all anti Radical clubs,
ana the committee would prefer TO wait until
that constitution was prepared; he therefore
moved that the committee be continued


MI. Hanna moved that a committee be ap-
pointed to select officers for the permanent
organization. -
Mr.. Dalton said that there was time enough
to make the selections, and proceeded to ex-
PLAIN that the present organization wGs only
which the temporary organization was effected
permanent officers would be elected.


Mr.. Hanna thought that the committee could
be appointed TO make the selections.


Mr.. Dalton.-If you want to get rid OF the
President. why don't you impeach hint but
II you do ii, you should do II better than Con.
officers was short, and he hoped that by the
time the club is to organize permanently, they
would have every anti Radical in the ward on
the roll. II was the determination Of those
who started the club TO keep it going during
the campaign, and for that purpose they had
rented the Hall


The secretary here took the following names:
John f. Little, Z. H. Beali, j. A. McCathran
J. NJ. Dalton, Ed Wayson, A. G. Pumphrey.
w. q. Hanna, Chas. Meg Gowen, Peter Lynch
VIM. Talbert, VIM. McGran, Geo A Fuss, Ed
Somers, John o. Bowen, James T. Boiseau,
w. o. Halt, David Lynch, Alex. Mc(iuigan,

Chas. Jones, w. ID. Dodson. John Collins, NJ ,
Paris, Lloyd Pumphrey. John Woodfield, G..
w. Miller, Geo. A. Davis, John NJ. Thornton,
j. J. Atchison. w. A. Fletcher.


AT this point another motion was made to
adjourn, but before it was put il was suggested
that some one make q speech, and Mr. Dalton
to entertain the club. read extracts from the
Anti-Radical Standard. While so engaged,
Gen. Hrgh Cameron, of the Western States
Club, entered the hall, and, being introduced,
addressed the club on political topics. in the
course Of which he said To show what Re.
publican rule here would be, il was only ne.
cessary 10 refer TO the action of Senator Pome-
roy and Representative Clark, who are en-
deavoring to introduce new degradation for
our people; for they were not satisfied with
imposing negro mems votes on us, but wanted
negro women to vote too Notwithstanding
they had spent forty-five days IN stumping the
State, they had been repudiated in Kansas


AT the conclusion Of General C.'s remarks, a
vote OF thanks was rendered him.


Mr. Daiton moved that the board OF officers
be constituted an executive committee to in yite
persons TO attend the meeting and become men,
bers of the club.


Mr.. Dalton said that there could be no doubt
OF the necessity for organizing. The rights OF
the people have been trampled upon, and our
beautiful metropolis made a poor house for
Virginia and Mary land negroes, who were get
ting so particular and independent that they
turn up their noses al that which poor white
people are glad to accept for he knew of party
OF darkies who came from the lower counties
OF Maryland for aims. who. on visiting a SCUM
house, not finding the soup good enough for
them, poured il out in the gutter, and held an
Indignation meeting on the curb-stOne. threat
ening TO tear the soup house down. There were
now but few of those elected on the Radical
ticket TO the Common Council whose position
was known, and the principles of others seemed
to be the whitewashing of Register Boswell
In regard TO the consolidation question. they
Were divided, and the anti-Radicals, if tn ev
worked, In his opinion, could easily carry the
election. Adjourned


FOURTH WARD DEMocRArIc CLuB.-Tbe
regular meeting of the Fourth Ward Democra.
tic and Conservative Club was held last even. g.
ing, the President, Owen Thorn, Esq, in the
chair.


Mr.. Dennis Mcnamara asked what had he.
come OF the Vice-President, Mr.. Geo. G. Viii.
son. The special committee Of nine to canvass
the ward had not been able to meet because
they mad no presiding officer. Several members
OF the committee were at the hail last week
but could hold no meeting on account of the
absence OF the Vice President. If he could not
attend the meetings another chairman should
be elected.


Mr.. A. Gleason moved to discharge that
special committee, and appoint new commit.
Tee who would attend 10 the business. He





ted.


Mr.. McNamara said tour members of that
committee had taken some interest in their
business, and had a list of 175 names who id
not register last year but the other members
took no interest and would not work. so the
work OF canyassing was stopped.


The Chair suggested that the club name the
members OF the new committee.


MI. john Houlahan did not see the use in ap.
poinung another committee. A majority would
OF Ihe same old members, and no work would


Mr.. ""A. Gleason said the Chair would have
more sense than 10 reappoint the old committee


Mr.. John Houlahan thought those members
OF the committee who did not .tend the meet
ings Were the greatest ones tor complaining


Mr.. John Hogan moved that a committee of
nine, TO canya the ward, be appointed; which
was adopted.


Mr.. Gleason moved that the appointment of
the committee be postponed until the next meet
ing; adopted.


Mr.. John Hogan moved that the executive
committee be instructed TO appeal to the other
wards, and get them to organize


Mr. j. Darby thought il very much out of
place for the executive committee of the Fourth
Ward to appeal to The other wards, when they
We're doing so little in the Fourth Ward The
example should be shown in this ward and
then ask other wards 10 organize


The Chair thought this club was doing some
good. An appeal could be made TO the other
wards, and, Il they would organize. central
association could be formed.


Mr. Michael Connell sss.1. the ward had been
canyassed, and II was known how many voter.
there were in the ward. He thought that was
working IN the right direction, and now
efforts should be made 10 get every ward in tbs,
city organized.


MIR. A. Gleason inquired what had become
Of the public speakers who We're TO be in vited.


Mr. Connell said there We're gentlemen out
side of the club who were doing more for the
club than those in il.


MIR. Mcnamara thought there was no neces-
sity for speakers the club could speak for
itself


The motion of Mr.. Hogan 10 request the wards
10 organize was adopted. -


The Chair suggested that the Executive Com
mittee meet and draw up short circular to
be transmitted to the other wards requesting
them 10 organie.


Mr.. Mcnamara thought Congress mi ght grant
new charter before the next meeting, and he
suggested that the club meet the night after a
charter should be granted,


The Char said the Executive Committee
could call meeting If necessary. Adiour ned

KILLED Ry AN Isnr.x-W Fl cb;ttendsn",,"KILLED BY AN INDIAN.-W. III. Chittenden
was killed by an Indian on Tuesday last, on
the Sacramento, near the mouth of Dog
Greek, in this county. Following are the
circumstances under which the deed was
perpetrated Chittenden had employed the
Indian to work for him at different times,
under promise Of pay, but when the Indian
asked for what was due him, his employer
managed to make some excuse sor not liqui-
dating the demand. On Tuesday, Chit
tenden, assisted by the Indian, finished
cleaning up piece of mining ground, and
when the gold was weighed out, the latter
insisted on being paid ten dollars, the amount
due him, according to previous agreement.
Chitten1e len offered him five dollars, but be
insisted on the payment of the whole sum
due him. Chittenden then threatened to knife
him if he annoyed him any more about the
matter. This enraged the. Indian, when he
seized Chittenden's rifle and shot him through
the body, killing him instantly. A neighbor
of Chittenden's dispatched a messenger to
this place to inform the authorities, when
Sheriff Greene repaired to Chittenden's place,
brought the Indian to town and placed him
in Jail to await the action of the Grand Jury.
We understand that the Indian had every
opportunity to escape after the commission of
the murder, but made no attempt to do so.-
Coroner Lynch repaired to the place to hold
an inquest on the body, but has not returned
at this writing."

Florida and reappOinted by the Governor In
1865, thinks that he ought to be Chief-Justice
until 1872; but finding that things have taken
a new turn, and that for some extraordinary
and highly embarrassing reason he Is Chief
Justice no longer, Mr.. Du Pont has issued an
Address ""To the people of Florida"" in which
he states that he considers himself 'not dead
""but sleeping and only in a condition of
suspended animation. This is the way in
which the cx-Judge puts it:


Crcumstanced however, as am. deprived OF the aid
of the Executive TO sustain the Judicial Department III

tho<htire legislative and military authority OF the United
States have other alternative than to announce 10
OF the exercise of the functions OF my
Office ChcfJustce until such time as the same may
DC resumed without ondangerng the peace ana Roou
order or society""


The Judge then protests ""solemnly"" against
the legality of all ""Acts Of Congress"" cob
struction of which can prevent his being
Judge until 1S72-after which he becomes gen
tier and more RATIONAL and gives The People
"" of Florida a great deal of advice gratis some
of which it would he wise for them to follow :


I. In the fIst place."" says the Judge, 81
counsel you to yield not for one moment to
the demoralizing influence of gloom or de-
"" spondeaCy.r He might here have quoted o
what's the use of signing, While Time is on
"" the wing! We can't prevent his flying;
""Then mcrrly, cheerily sing ia la The
gloom or dependency"" which leads the
gloomy and despondent to lynch all Union
men and, carpet-baggers"" by 10 means meets
with the Judges appreciation. His gloom and
dcspondency takes the shape of addresses, and
may hereafter take the shape of clegiac verses,
which would be a much wiser vent of the pent-
up feelings. God"" in the opinion of Judge
Du POnt, "" is cOnsummating some great moral
problem in the progress of which 1t was
necessary for Judge Du Pont to be suspended
until 1872. Does he get into a cast-iron perspl-
ration2 Does hc shoot anybody! Does he
stab anybody Does he fire his neghbor'S
house! Not at all He simply issues "" An Ad-
dress and feels better after it Immediately.
Why will not all the suspended gentlemen
in Florida exhibit like philosophy


. For in the second place, Judge Du
Pont points out thai after all it isn't exactly
the wiscst course 10 lynch g the carpet-baggcIs
He says:

them tn fcel that they are welcome ysitoe ana o realr
that the passions enccndcrcd by have yielded ana

This is excellent advice. but the Judge rather
spoils its effect by adding

ments ~ Infamous and hcarcss tyranny unparaele
IN the annals of the age set your faces Ike mut-mafe
ncH 20 fcul ard scusiby realize. that they are unvc
inruders let there he room for mistake on mis-
apprehension that point syeophaney insineerity or
Discrimination cOnitdtc part Of Southern character


Judge Du Pont like most men of his class
at the South thinks it necessary to blow both
the war-trumpet and the pastoral flute; but we
can assure him that he plays most charmingly
upon the latter instrument All we ask is that
those men from the Northern States who may
visit Florida with the design to identify
themselves as citizens"" shall not be treated
(as thcy generally have BEEN just as if they
were the instruments of an Infamous and
""hcartless tyranny Thus far, there has been
precious little discrimination. but every man
from the North, East. or West"" who has
shown himself in Florida has been socially
marked as an insolcnt and nwclcome inter
loper. When Judge Du Pont advises his fell
low citizens ""to be very cautious TO avoid
"" conflict with the powers that be"" and ""to
preserve peace and good order in the com
""munity,r we trust his neighbors will regard
him as ""A yeritable Daniel, although he no
longer tries cases in the Supreme Court.

 Railroad Disasters.",,"Tidings were received in Richmond yesterday of three fearful railroad acci dents in each of which the loss of life was almost mlraculously small. Full particulars could not be obtained in either case.

 A special passenger train, containing delegates returning from the Norfolk Convention, left Lynchburg on Saturday the l7th instant for Bristol When about tive ve miles from Lynchburg, near Elk creek, the boiler of the locomotive Washington"" attached to the train, sud denly exploded, instantly killing the engineer, Jerome Stout, and also the fire ulan, whose name is not reported.

 The body of the engineer was divided into two parts, one part lodging in tree several hundred yards from the engine. It was necessary to cut the tree down to recover this portion of the body. The remains of tho tiremen were also blown several hundred yards, but were also recovered.

 The train consisted of thirteen passen- ger cars. all heavily loaded with human beings. containing probably not less than six hundred persons. Eleven of the cars were more or less broken or damaged one of them WAS battered almost to pieces. but although filled with ladies, strange to say none were seriously injured A train was snt out from Lynchburg to carry the delegates back to the city. where they were to remain until the engine debris of the trrin could be removed and the track repaired

 Another special train on the same rail road conveying delegates towards their homes, and preceding the one mentioned above. ran of the track at point near Abingdon, but no lives were lost by the accident

 On Saturday night two trains collided on the North Carolina railroad about six miles from Harrisburg Station. On one of them was Mckinley X Co.'S circus company. Both engines were perfect wrecks- The fireman (colored) had one lcg taken off, and four other persons hurt to what extent is not known."

titled to two Senators.


An election was held in this district on the
second Tuesday of October, 1867, and Chas. j.
| II. McIntire. Democrat, was returned az elected
by 233 majority and Samuel j. Shugart by %
majority. John X Robinson contested the
election of Shugart


The Senate, after full investigation by q
Select Committee and the examination of large
number of witnesses, declared Robinson duly
elected, and admitted him to the seat occupied
by Shugart The whole testimony in the case
is published in the Legislative Record for the
session of 1868, from page 1897 to LAO inclu-
sive.


| 1t is proven conclusvely that the leaders of
| the Democratic party not only planned and
| perpetrated deliberate fraud upon the ballot
| box in this district, but that they prearranged
system of fraudulent naturalization papers,
| extending through other counties of the State.
A railroad sixteen miles long was being built
| during the Summer and Fall of 1867, III Clear
field and Center Counties. From forty to
sixty rods only of the road was in Center
| County. About 400 Irishmen were employed
on the road, and boarded in shantes along the


line, except during the time they were taken
into Center County in order to carry the cleo
ton in that Senate District. Senators were to
be elected in the Center District, but not in
the Cearield. The following testimony, copied
| from the official records of the Legislature,
shows how the fraud was perpetrated, and who
did it, ,,

THE ASCENT OF MOVNT BAKER.-The Vancouver |
ColoDist. September 3, gives an account of the |
ascent of Mount Baker by party headed by |
Messrs. Ogilvy and Coleman. The party left |
Whatcom on the Sth August, travelled uD the |
Lnmini ana Nootsac rivers, by canoe, so miles |
"". 1
to what may be called the foot of the mountain. |
At the snow line, where vegetation ceases, the |
Indians camped, allowing the explorers to reach 1
the summit themselves, which they did the same /
day, and returned TO camp in the evening. The /
distance Travelled, which was about six miles is |
said TO have been most fatiguing. though not as
perilous as was expected. Beng obliged T. |
return to the camp the same evening, the explo-
rers had only about an hour on the summit this |
short period they seem TO have used diligently. |
The existence Of volcano is established beyond |
doubt, the crater being about three hundred /
feet wide, and at least six hundred feet deep,
from which pufs of sulphurous vepor are being |
emitted. This crater lies between two high peaks
of the mountain, where the summit forms a |
plateau quite bare and free from snow; which is
quarter of a mile wide and half a mile long. |
The eastern peak, called after Gen. Sherman, is
the highest of the two. The time spent on the |
summit was devoted to examining the crater, and
planting the American flags, with so much of the
usual honors as the party were enabled to give.


The mountain, as most persons are no doubt |
aware, is few miles south of the boundary line
the 49th parllel. Tne most arduous part of the
ascent was the last pitch, where the party had to
cut 400 steps in the ice in erder to reach the top
The Indians would not go any higher than the line
of vegetation but they received the party on
returning from the summit with marked demon
stratioDs of welcome and joy, evidently recog.
DiZing the dangers and h8rdshps of this part of
the trip, and the courage and skill the explorers
had shown in overcoming them so speedily. No

said was an old grizzly. IL was well our friends

Coleman will return by the Eliza Anderson from

shall have additional detsils of the expedition and
its scientific results. Mr.. Coleman, we belive
has the honor of making the first successful ascent
OF This mountain, which he and his party failed to
accomplish on former occasion, by reason Of
the Indians accompanying guides and packers
refusing TO proceed further than a certain distance
into the interior. Various authorities have given
estimates of the altitude of Mount Baker; some
laid it down at IL 600 feet high some at l6 900
feet; while others again have given il an altitude
of 2l,OCO feet equal to some Of the highest peaks
en- the continent.

On Saturday last in the Virginia Reconstruc-

On the same day, in the North Carolina Con-
vention, the article on homesteads, including .
thousand dollars worth of land in the exemp-
ton from the sheriff, was adopted; also an
article making provision for the prompt pay
ment Of the State debt.


On the same day the Georgia Convention
resolved itself into State nominating body,
or republican party State convention, where
upon q majority of the white delegates refused
to participate, and considerable confusion and
split In the radical camp were the immediate
results. Among other refractory movements
Mr.. Farrowe, President Of the Union League,
announced himself as a candidate for Governor,
against Mr.. Bullock, the nominee Of the Con-
vention. Here may be an opening for the
conservatives.


On the same day, in the Mississippi Conven-
ton, they were engaged upon the tax ordi-
nance authorizing the State Treasurer to pay
the Convention warrants, and upon Q resolu-
ton ON the petition of certain persons formerly
slaves touching certain properties acquired
by them in 1863-64, and Of which they have
been lately dispossessed by their former mas
ters. The resolution requesting General Gil
lem to order the restoration of said properties
was adopted.


On the same day, in the Louisiana
Convention, the constitution being finished,
the special business of the day was tho
signing it. .Seventy-six members Of the
Convention affixed their names to the docu-
ment, and seven refused to sign it. A
resolution was next adopted ordering the
printing of ten thousand copies Of the con-
stitution in pamphlet form for distribution
by the members. The Convention meets to-
day for the election of registers.


Within a month or SO, it is supposed, or in
season to be represented in the Republican
Presidential Convention at Chicago on the goth
of May next, the work Of reconstruction in all
these outside States viii be pushed through to
the grand finale Of their restoration to Con-
gress, so that their votes on the basis Of uni
balance of power may be secured to the
radicals on the Presidential issue and in the
elections for the next Congress.


The FINANCES, THE TARIFF AND INTERNAL
REVENUE LAWS IN CoNGREss.-Now that the
House has got the impeachment question OF
its shoulders by transferring 1t in due form to
the Senate, the subject of finance, tariff and
internal revenue appears to have caught the
attention of members Mr.. Clarke, Of Kansas,
and Messrs. Blaine and Lynch, of Maine,
expressed the republican view Of the finance
question on Saturday, while Mr.. Holman, Of
Indiana, represented the democratic idea OF
the matter. No doubt Mr.. Holman spoke the
mind of the whole Northwestern democracy
when he insisted that the bondholders should
have no more privilege than the industrial
classes, upon whose labor the finances Of the
country rested. Mr. Broomall, of Penn
sylvania, made high tariff speech, Of course,
in the vein of the leading interests Of his
State. BUT with all this discussion we are
disposed to think that Congress has no inten-
ton whatever of doing anything in regard to
the important subject Of finance nor any other
grave question. Impeachment and quarrels
with the President are going to occupy all
its time for the purpose Of diverting public
attention from the great financial questions OF
specie payments, currency, national banks
and the odious internal revenue laws and
income tax.

MEXICO, Nov. TO- 1868.


Perhaps the most important event which has
transpired since my last letter is the absolute and
apparently final settlement OF the question Of the
Mexico and Vera Cruz Railroad concession. On the
evening Of my writing the report Of the concession
acted upon by the Congress- was returned to that
body without any amendments for their dnal action,
and ON tho same day the bill was finally passed and
has become o law. There are two paragraphs there
in which can hardly please the company; but 1t is
presumed that the President and Cabinet desired not
to raise any new questions with fauit-nnding Con-
gress and concluded to far endorse their conduct
as to make no exceptions to their present action,
but rather, trust to the good sense of that body IN
the future for such amendments as circumstances
and the necessities Of the company and the welfare
OF the country may point out. Great reJoicings
have occurred along the proposed line OF the
road upon the renewed prospects Of an abundance
OF work and the circulation Of capital. The people
of Orizaba and other places sent their congratua-
tions to the President by telegraph and made great
demonstrations Of thankfulness that Mr.. Juarez
had succeeded In his earnest wish to forward their
interest BY pressing this railroad business to sue
cessful end. 1t Is understood that work will begin
at once upon the Pueba branch road, and efforts
are also being made for road from Puebla to Paso
del Macho. The main road OF the English company
It should be understood, is projected to pass from
Apizaco directly eastward to Paso del Macho, not
passing through Puebla.


The public press are mentioning the introduction
Of proposition in Congress by II. Ficarol Co. for
permission to build road from Anton Lizardo to
Puerto Angel No action has been taken as yet upon
such petition. The Guaymas and Tehuantepec Rail.
road matters will probably come up for nnal discus
sion this week. Mr. Manuel Cortino Barrto, q mer-
chant Of Ignaa, has directed petition to Congress
soliciting authority for establishing line Of steam.
boats to run on the river Mescaa, between Mescala
and the port OF Tetatalco, the Pacific. This is an
enterprise to which, during the past ten fifteen
years. representatives or many nations have more or
less given their attention. il practicable an out
lot would thereby be given to many of the products
OF the country. The question OF It's practicability
arises from the fact that there several rapids in
the course Of the stream, necessatng very consid-
erable subaqueous blasting or the construction Of
canals and locks When those PORTIONS Of Guerrero
and Michoacan through which this river flows be-
come more inhabited and wholly secure there win
be more reason and profit in the investment or capi
| tai in the enterprise mentioned.

Peace before whom the examination was
held, with the verdict of the Coroner's jury ::


William V. Murphy sworn, sa5s-On the
22d inst, in the afternoon, Mr.. Jones, the
defendant, came to my place; said TO Mr..
Henson, the deceased, that he wanted to talk
to him that he wanted to talk to him calmly9
if | can talk calmly SIR. Henson's reply
was, Vel. Defendant then said, That letter
you wrote to Mrs. Lansdale, an old lady
seventy odd years DID, Henson said l wrote
just what felt and believed to be the truth.
Jones said, Such letter as no gentleman
would write to an o.d lady. Henson-A
gentleman would write such letter. Jones
Il say no gentleman would write such a
letter to an old lady 20 odd years old. Jones
had a shovel with hiui be is attending ditch
for A. r. Andrews. Henson said. Don't
draw your shovel on me, at the same time
reaching to get his knife, and drawing it, a
sheath knife. Don't know whether Jones
drew shovel on Henson or not. AT this time
the parties were ten or twelve feet apart.
DOM think Jones advanced towards Henson
at the time he was told not to draw shovel.
Henson then advanced toward Jones aud
picked up piece of plauk; think if defend
ant had wished to injure Henson he could
have done SO easily when Henson stopped to
pick up the piece Of board. After getting it
they both seemed to maneuvre for the advan-
tage, and almost instantly came together,
Henson with his sheath knife in one hand
and piece of plank in the other, and Jones
with a shovel think Henson advanced most;
Jones' stroke with shovel knocked Henson
down; Jones struck him orce as he fell. |
think | said Hold on, that's enough. l
then went up and raised Henson's head he
was bleeding very badly; think Jones said,
Sip. you must let my family alone. said
to Jones that feared he had killed him. He
(Jones) said. no he had not, for me to take
his knife from him, and he would help me to
attend to him. | told Jones ne did not have

her to bring some cold water. Mr.. Jones

the little girl on the way; he came with the
water; had got Henson in sitting posture

that Henson did not have his knife he Hen
son) looked around for it, as though he
wanted to get up with it. Jones said to
Henson, You must let my family alone, and
my old mother-in law, over 10 years old
she has no one to defend her but me, and
what would people say if did not. Henson
says: Thad. Jones, I'll make this mighty hot
for you yet, and commenced trying to get up.
told him to set still. Jones says: Henson,
don't you try that on me. Henson got up,
think with intention of renewing the attack,
as he tried to get hold of something, but
found he was too weak. l kept my hands
on him, and he soon sat down again. After
Henson was down, Jones came and offered to
assist him. Henson says: Go off, | don't
want your help; Jones said: Well, I'll go,
and walked off. | assisted Henson to the
house. After getting there he seemed bet
ter, and talked in natural tone of voice, but
in about half hour he commenced to vomt
and got worse, aud half an hour later | think
was entirely insensible. James Chestnut
came in said Jones told him to come down.
Jones soon after came, and | think had
Chestnut go after physician. Chestnut
came back without a physician, the doctor
having told him he did not think it necessary
to come, as there was no trouble except loss
of blood. Henson died about II o'clock, or
a little after, on the morning of the 23d /
think the deceased drew his knife with the
intention of using it upon the defendant, as
he at the time made motion forward, pick
ing up the piece of plank at the same time,
keeping his eye on the defendant. 1t is
customary for men attending ditch to carry
a shovel. There was no other person present
at the time of the affray.


Following is the verdict of the Coroner's
jury

Rouge than to summon the great number oi
witnesses that are required in this particu.
lar case to attend the Committee here. It
will do no injury to either party, but result
TO their good, and to the good OF the State,
by lesseDing the expense Of this Committee,
and therefore as member of that Commit
mittee am in favor of the resolution and
hope 1t may be adopted.


MIR. OHara: MIR. President, as regards the
question of economy, l believe the State
can save some expense that would result
from bringing the witnesses from Baton
Rouge to this city, by adopting this resolu-


tion. Mr.. Rsgan has been compelled to


bring his witnesses here and has been put


TO great deal of expense, and unless was


satisfied that by the passage. of this resolu-


tion justice would be done him, would be


unwilling to support it. know there is no


question but that the State will save good


deal Of money by the operation, and as re-


CARDS economy, it is great deal better to


pay the expenses of few men going to Ba-


ton Rouge than six or eight witnesses


coming and going. But don't think it is


doing Mr.. Ragan Justice. | don't think it


is giving him fair play. This is the only


reason why | shall oppose the resolution.


l therefore move that the resolution be post
poned until tomorrow.


The resolution was finally tabled.


House bill No. 81, an act removing the
seat OF justice of the parish of Carroll from


the town of Floyd and fixing it at the village


OF Elton, in said parish, on the Mississippi
river, was read.


Mr.. Ray: This bill, as passed by the House,


removes the seat Of justice in the parish OF


Carroll. 1t is a region of country that | am


tolerably well acquainted with and feel


inclined to support the bill from the know


ledge have of the country and the neces.


sity for 1t. During the war believe every


house OF consequence in the town of Floyd


was destroyed. The most of the population


IN Carroll parish lived along the Mississippi
river. There is swamp between the court


house and the Mississippi river that during


a great part OF the time when the river is


high has to be crossed in a boat l know


that many people living in that part of the


parish have desired that this change should


be made. | believe that the whole delega-


tion from that parish in both Houses are in


favor of this bill. Mr.. Lynch, who is alb


sent, recommended the removal of the seatof
Justice from where it is. | believe the meas


ure will meet the general approval of all


parties interested. The only objection


have heard urged is that it is located on
private property, and that it will be meahs
OF speculation to the persons who occupy
that property. That is no consideration
whatever. II it will be of general advan.
tage to the parish to have the change made,
such consideration should have no weight
with us whatever. | therefore move that
the bill be considered engrossed.


Mr.. Blackman: Mr.. President. this is a
bill introduced, as l understand, By mem


ber OF the Legislature, for the purpose of
removing the courthouse from the town of
Floyd, iu the parish of Carroll, and estab-
fishing the court house of that parish on the
plantation now owned and possessed by this
member of the Legislature, without ever
having consulted the interest OF the people
of the parlsh-w without ever having taken
the sense OF the people of the parish of Car
roll, as to whether the seat of Justice should
be removed or not. He wishes to place it
upon private property, all for the benefit of
one individual. l am not as a Senator
on this floor, and as g Representative of
the people of Louisiana rea ady to act upon
such proposition. II the people of Carroll
desire to remove their courthouse, and have
an additional tax put upon themselves to
build new parish buildings; if they desire
this to be done, then |. as a representative
of the people, am willing to support the
But know the condition of the
people of the parish. They are not only
impoverished by the war, but the overflow
has swept over that country for several
successive years since, and caused failure
of their crops, which has almost reduced
them to absolute and abiect poverty: so
that f. proposition Of this kind, at a time
like this, to remove the seat of Justice to
the premises of a private individual, to place
burdens upon the people who are
already SO impoverished, is a proposition
that can not support until have conviuc.
ing evidence that 1t is the wish OF the people.
And / will assert that to impose such bur
den upon them at such time, against their
will be piece of injustice upon
the part OF any Legislature that DOES 1t,
which is wholly ineXcusaJle. Have the Deo
pie of this parish been consulted in regard
to this measure? Where is the evidence
that they have? 1t has been the custom of
every term of the Legislature before this to
allow the people of parish to have vote
upon the question of changing the location
Of their seat OF justice before such change
could be made, and if such vote has shown
Il to be the desire of the people of the
parish that such change should be made
the Legislature has always made it accord
.ngly. If am satisfied by proper evidence
that it is the general wish of the people
interested that this change should be made
shall favor the bill, but without some pro.
per expression OF the general wish of the
people for such change, | shall oppose
the measure.


Mr., Coupland; Mr.. President, move that
his bill lay over subject to call, as the
Senator from Carroll is not here.


Mr.. Pollard: Mr. President, I would be
glad il the Senator was here, because then [
know there would be no trouble about it.
The gentleman who offered the bill, General
MeMlllen. it is true, as the Senator from
Claiborne says, that he drew up the bill,
but he drew 1t up in accordance with a let
ter and petition that he received from the
people. He was doing the business for the
people. should prefer that Senator Lynch
were here. would not like to do Injustice
to the people, but l understand that the
majority of the people of the parish desire
The removal of the county seat. The Off
GERS elected in that parish at the late cleo
ton dare not go to the courthouse to trans
act their business unless they have guards
with them. There are some old citizens
there that are opposed to it no doubt, but
they are very small portion. don't blame
them for opposing it, but the large mass of
the people are in favor of it. 1t is benefit
to the people, and we have right to iegis-
late for the benefit of the people. If did
not really and conscientiously believe that
would be doing right in voting for the
bill would not do it.


Mr.. Blaekman 3 / second the motion to Law
The bill ON the table subject to call.


Mr. Ray: Mr.. President, hope the bill
will not be postponed.


Mr.. Coupland: Fhai forgotten that Sena.
tor Pollard was here. 1 withdraw NV mo-
ton tospostponeg.


Mr. Day; At one time this courthouse
was upon the Mississippi river, and in order
that the convenience Of the people /.
might be met. q vote Of the people
was taken, and it was removed from
the river 20 Floyd. They have erected
a courthouse there at considerable expense.
and there has been no desire expressed for
the removal OF the county seat back to the
river at any point. don't doubt that the
member from thatparish in the other House
has received petition requesting it should

of the times 10 respe.t to negro Suffrage which
We have observed 10 the iset that several Of
the strongest Democratic Journals In the
South favor II; indeed, they earnestly sdvo-
cate It, Ths Richmond Whis, within few
days, had an editorial upon this subject, and
10 II, to our surprise, afi'ms that . majority
Of the white population Of Virginia are ready
and willing to give to the colorsd man all his
rights, civil and political, including the rights
Of property and suffrage, and also advocating
free schools and solid education for the col.
oTsd population. II goes 90 fsr Is 10 advo.
cate that this principle bs sngrsftsd upon the
Alexandria constitution, ard that whom the
constitution Is thus amended II, with the
sanction Of Congress, be submitted to the
people Of the State for adoption.


The two papers publishsd in Lynchburg-
the Republican and the Virginian--ars out
for negro suffrage. The latter paper thinks that
the negro.sutfrsge principle, ensraftsd upon
this Alexandra constitution, ,zould be adopted
BY . large majority Of the white people Of the
State.


This paper, evidently, does not approve o
the Richmond constitution, - that instrumsn
disfranchisss many thousands Of white people
II these virginians are in favor Of snfranchis
ing the eolored people, and are honest in thsi
avowais, there Is certainly no good reason wb
the whites should not be freed from all disa
bilities; In short, and to speak plainly, VII
not universal suffrage and universal amnesty
Who can object ""Lst u, have peace""


The Lynchburg Rcpnblioan says that Negro
suffrage in the ten Southern States is 6IsC
faot and that an amsndmsnt to the Fedora
Constitution will make 1t uniform In all th,
Ststes Of the Union.


The VirgiRiaH thinks that the North ought
to accept 1t (usgro sufrags) as well as The
South. In this the Virginidn Is right. suf
frags must be uniform throughout the Unitei
state, This Is the only correct and Just prin
cipls upon which to settle our difficulties
There Is ono thing We have noticed within
few days which is significant, and that is. tn,

It Is evident that We are approaching tn

The contest of the President with Congress had
been waged with great bitterness for nearly two
years and after the fall elections OF 1866 the tri-
umph OF the republicans emboldened the leaders OF
the party to carry out with undisgused bodness the
measures they had resolved upon The bill placing
the exrebel States under military rule and fore
ing universal negro suffrage upon them had not yet
been passed, but it and other measures which have
since become law had been decided upon. The only
obstacle to the entire success OF the radical policy
was Mr.. Johnson but he, by simply contenting him
self with vetoing such bills as did not meet his ap-
proval, had given his opponents no opportunity TO
compass his removal. To every radical representa-
tive the President was obnoxious and all would
have been glad to him deprived OF his ofice but
itwas not known If solid party vote could be relied
upon TO override veto and carry through measure
negro sulrage) which was not only unpopular
among the people of the Northern States but which
many believed was so glaring violation OF the con-
stitution that enough republican congressman would
be found who would shrink from giving it their sup
port TO prevent its success


THE FIRST ATTEMPT BY MR.. ASHLEY.


That this was the true secret Of the desire to get
rid of Mr.. Johnson the developments made after
wards plainly showed But be that as IL may,
movement was inaugurated looking to his impeaoh-
ment, and on the 7th day OF January, 1867 Mr..





lege and with ludicrous effort to initiate the action
and language Of Burke in his celebrated speech i'm
peaching Warren Hastings said, after few pre-
liminary remarks:-


l do impeach Andrew Johnson Vice President
and Acting President OF the United States Of high
crimes and msdemeanors


charge him with usurpatiOn of power and VIOLA
tion OF law;


In that he has corruptly used the appointing
power:


In that he has corrupty used the pardoning power;
In that he has corruptly used the veto power;


In that he has corruptly disposed Of public pro-
perty of the United States;


In that he has corrupy interfered in elections and
committed acts which, in contemplation OF the con-
sttution, are high crimes and misdemeanors There
fore,


Be it resolved, That the Committee on the Ju-
dietary be, and they are hereby authorized to In
qure into the official conduct OF Andrew Johnson,
Vice President OF the United States dischargng the
powers and duties of the Otfice OF President OF the
United States and TO report to this House whether,
IN their opinion, the said Andrew Johnson, while
in said office, has been guilty OF acts which are
designed or calculated to overthrow subvert or cor
rupt the government of the United States any de-
partment or ofice thereof; and whether the said An
drew Johnson has been guilty OF any act or has con-
spired with others TO do acts which, in contempla-
tiOn OF the constitution, are high crimes and msde
meanors requiring the interposition of the constu
tional power of this House; and that said commit.
tee have power to send for persons and papers, and
10 admpister the customary oaths to witnesses
These charges and resolutions were not allowed
any length of time for debate. The democrats and
conservatives endeavored to gain time, but the ma
jorty were memorable. The call for the ""previOus
question: made and sustained, and the resolu-
tion adopted by strict party vote Of one hun
dred and yeas to thirty nays and referred to
the Judiciary Committee.


INVESTIGATION BY THE COMMITTEE.
The Judiciary Committee set promptly TO work and
examined o very large number Of witnesses The
manner in which they proceeded was to say the
least very ndelicate Mr. Johnson's social relations
were made the subject OF investigation; the number
OF United States bonds he owned or had bought and
other matters connected with his private business
were ascertained. In fact nothing left undone
to obtain some ground which to report in favor Of
his impeachment. On the 9th Of February the COM
mttee began to take testimony and toward the close
OF the session reported that not having fully inves
gated the charges they were unable to arrive at any
conclusion The subject was therefore tranferred to
the Fortieth Congress. After this body met 1t was
ascertaned beyond doubt that majority OF the
committee was opposed to taking any further
steps looking to impeachment. None OF the EVIL
dence, II was asserted, constituted a high crime
and msdemean0r and it Ia probable that a report to
this effect would have been rendered had not the
summer recess OF the House been taken. At this
time the committee stood as follows:-For reporting
against impeachment-Mess Wilson, rep., OF Iowa,
chairman; Woodbridge, rep, Of Vermont; Churchill,
rep, ,eof New York; Marshall, dem., OF Illinois, and
Eldridge, dem., Of wsconsin-5. For reporting in
favor OF Observation-Disclosures. Boutwell, rep, OF
Massachusetts,; Williams, rep, OF Pennsylvania;
Thomas, rep, Of Maryland, and Lawrence, rep. OF
Ohio.


A MYSTERIOUS CHANGE AND REPORT IN FAVOR OF


IMPEACHMENT


Before Congress met in the fall there were rumors
a1oat that Mr. Churchill, OF New York, who had
hitherto opposed impeachment, was now In favor OF
It. The reasons assigned for this remarkable





bltng il TO his having been refused certain
appointments by the President Whether this be
true not cannot, OF course, be ascertained
and the probabilities against its truth. But be
that 1t may 1t is quite certain that the 25th OF
November, 1867 Messrs. Boutwell,, Williams Thomas
Lawrence ana Churchill, majority OF the commit
tee, presented q report favoring Impeachment.
Messrs. Wilson and Woodbridge, republicans, and
Messrs. Marshall and Eidridge democrats presented
minority report, In which they held that the evil
dence was not snfcient to warrant further action
the part OF the House, Prior to this time the fall
elections had taken place, and the radical party had
not only met with heavy losses, but had in several
states been defeated by decisive majorties This
reaction against the policy Of Congress had its eject
upon the great majority OF the representatives.
When therefore, after some nlbusering on the part
OF the democrats, vote taken the eth of De-
cember on the report OF the majority 1t was declared
rejected by 50 yeas to los nays. The following was

 FREE DISCUSSION AT THE SOUTH At the Connecticut Democratic Convention held yesterday in New Haven, Governor En- glish made some extraordinary assertions. Referring to the slave states not yet repre- sented in Congress, he said:

 ""Every bulwark of personal freedom has been stricken down; freedom of speech, freedom of the press, habeas corpus, trial by jury, the right of suffrage, the right of representation in Congress guaran- ty. in fact, under the federal Constitution, has been swept away by the remorseless le- glslation of Congress in these ten states"" We are astonished that any person sup posed to know enough of contemporary po- litical events to fill the place of Governor of @ state, should make such strange asser- tions. Freedom of speech and Freedom of the press have not existed till now in the ten states to which he alludes. q Even if speech were muzzled and the press denied the right of free discussion, the states would be in no worse condition than they were before the war. Congress could not the absurdity of Governor Engish's asser- tion IS as great as the misrepresentation. But, in truth, the freedom of speech and of the press has been to considerable ex- tent secured through the instrumentality of Congress, In most parts of the late rebel states, not, perhaps, in all, one may now declare himself in favor of impartial suffrage without being lynched for his pains. The great right of free discussion, which never was permitted at the South r,n- til the federal government insisted that it should be respected, is the first of politi- cal rights. By its aid all othes5 political rights are maintained, or if denied, may be recovered, and without it no other politi- cal rights are secure or of much value New Fork Ecening Posk ~ s rr+-,5-.+ . x ..f."

From the Mobile Evening Telegram, Dec. 29l


The greatest excitement caused in the streets
tempted murder of Judge Busted by Colonel Martini
Unltod Statea District Attorney Tue occurrence took
place betwecRAhe Battle House and the Custom House.
on Royal street, and The most determined efforts
made by the District Attorney to murder the Judge He
fred three shots at him before he interrupted one
taking effect below the chest and another in the right
leg The third shot missed its object


Judge Busiecd left the Battle House to proceed his
Office IN the Custom House, aud had nearly reached the
sidewalk in front OF the latter place when without
warning, Martin commenced shooting at him. Martin
had been standing the southwest Royal and
St. Francis streets, and seeing the Judge tho
walked rapidly towards Busteed He fred his first shot
before the Judge saw him. The first shot tho one
knocked tho Judge down He fell in the gutter. aud
his assalant fred the other two shots him. one Of
which failed In hitting him, and the other entered the


right log below the kneo and passed up through the log
above the knee.


At tho moment when Martin was cooking his pistol
preparatory TO taking fourth shot, Mr. w. W. D. Tur.
ner United States Commissioner. rushed up and seized
him by the throat Martin had not spoken word but
recognizing Turner he attempted 10 shoot nim but
failed owing TO the interference of another gentleman
whose name we have not discovered, and who
his pistol from bis hand The attempted murderer
turned over TO the hands OF officers Scott and Dressing
ham, aud by them taken to the guardhouso where he
Ia now in confinement


only remarked after being helped 10 his feet by Co onel
Harry Manry that he had been shot With the assist
anc0 OF COlOne Maury ne walked 10 the Old cco Of DR.
Mott, whore his wounds were examined by Dr. Gilmore
He was then removed TO carriage by several friends
and taken 10 his room In the Battle House. Tho most
distinguished surgeons and physicians In town we're
summoned and IL Is to be hoped that his wounds al
though serious, will not prove mortal


In addition TO the large number Of cab drivers every
body 10 town almost seemed TO be upon the ground.
The crowd was dense 10 impede travel. The gen.
eraI impression among all who had witnessed tho
that IT a cowardfy attempt to murder and
that Judge Buseed was attacked without warning and
not allowed the smallest chance for his life. III
Aaxtln huA wkfh fhnftA Asln
house II s probable that he would nave been lynched.


The prisoner Is understood TO have had very bitter
feelings towards Judge Bustced for some time back.
Yesterday the prisoner approached the Judge In the
Custom House, and In an excited tone sald:--sJudge
Bustecd, wish TO see you - Tho Judge replied :--aI
Judge Bustaed wish TO sec you the street; - TO
which tine Judge replied:-""I DO my business In my
office aud not on the street, Martin said --sSir. /
shall you on tho street,


Judge Busteed Is Of great personal courage and
gave himself alarm about this throat proceeding In
hs usual cool way with his affairs and taking no pre-.
cautions FOR protection or defence.


IL seems that the prisoner In wait for him this
morning at the front Of the Custom House. and COM
menced the shooting the Judge reached the sidewalk
bis way 10 his court Tho weapon used In now IN the
hands o. tho police. IL Colts revolver and


Judge Bused docs not appear 70 have boon srmod Al

Tin reported 70 have said that tho dnculty between
him snd Busteed OF long standing. and that he
had notified tho Judge 70 himself aud bo prepared
10 meet him. II tho judge was not armed Mr. Martin
says That u was bs own fault


ksssrs Smith and Herndon are counsel for the ac-

WASHINGTON Monday, March q 1888

An tho IIouse of Lords had no vote By virtue ol hs
or,sidency The question raised by Senator sherman
was not settled it being thought best to let 1t be de-
termincd by the Court while in session. The rules
were finally adopted, and the Senate adjourned at
IL o'clock.


On Wednesday the Senate will resolve itself into
High Court of Impeachment, and Immediately sum
mon Mr. johnson to appear and answer The chaIgeS
preferred against him. There is some speculation
nnon the time that the Court will allow Mr.. Johnson
10 prepare for the trial The general impression IS
that he will get from ten to twenty days to arrange
his defense. Meantime the two Houses VIII proceed
with their regular legislative business


The House was IN session to-day eight Successive
hours and finally finished the preparations for the
Impeachment of Mr. johnson. From 10 o'clock IN
the morning until in the afternoon was consumed
in debate, or rather in speeehmakng. Each speaker
was limited TO 10 inmates, but several not wishing
to persecute the galleries. sought leave TO print their
speeches, without being compelled 10 deliver them
Cen Garfield opened the proceedings IN strong ar
gument in denunciation of Mr. JOhnsons usurpa-
lions Mr. Lawrence Of Pennsylvania followed, argu-
ing in favor of immediate impeachment. lle is one
of the most conservative OF the Republican members
and his speech to-day is held to be indicative OF the
result Of impeachment Mr.. Niblack was the next
speaker He is strong among his Democratic broth
rem but his speech to-day was simply charging that
the Tenure-of Office bill is unconstitutional and that
everything that Mr. johnson had done was cOnstitu-
tOnal Able aud pointed speeches were made by
Hamilton Ward, Gen. Paine Messrs. Pike, Lough-
ridge, CullOm Lynch, Mccarthy and Others. all
taking strong ground for the immediate impeach-
nent of the President. Mr.. Stevens at p o'clock
rose to speak. He sat at the clerks desk and read
his speech; but he was feeble that scarcely word
could be heard IN the galleries. Having been gwen
Ahalf hour he closed the debate. When hehad finished
Mr.. Jenckes proposed a article against MI
johnson, which was adopted without trouble. Mr.
Butler then made an attempt TO introduce an sdd
tionAl article but failed His article was objected
TO. principally the statement Of Mr. Wilson OF the
Judiciary Committee who opposed it because II pro-
posed to 90 outside the direct issue and would tend
to open up the whole case Of the FIRST attempt at i'm
peachment Of Mr. johnson. Several OF the Democrats
voted with Afr. Butler on his amendment. few
verbal amendments were made and when
the the time for vote came the Democrats
tried to delay matters, but failed and consOled
themselves by calling for the yeas and nays the
adoption of each article. This was very tiresome;
but before the sun went down the whole 10 articles
had been adopted Although Mr.. Jenckes's addi
tional article was agreed to, the number is still 10
s the original seventh article stricken out The
seven managers agreed upon in caucus were then
balloted for and elected. Tomorrow these manager:
viii present the articles Of Impeachment to the Sen
ate, and then organize themselves for the work be-
fore them.


The Senate Military Committee considered thC
nomination of Mr.. Ewing, to-day, as Secretary OF
War, but determined to take no action on it until
after the impeachment question is settled. No nomi
nations of any kind to be considered until after
that event.


The Committee Of Ways and Means meet daily,
and are endeayoring to devise some means whereby
the tax on spirits can be collected. A vast number
of plans have been presented but all that have been
examined so far are found defective. The probabili-
ties are that further investigation will yet induce
che Committee to reverse the vote Of last week and
Gx the tax at IS cents per gallon. The continued
steady decrease in revenue from spirits, which is
now over one-hah less than in the corresponding
months of last year, necessitates some prompt
remedy


The WAYS and Means Committee to-day decided to
retain the present tax on tobacco They determined.
however, to recommend change in the system Of
collection substituting stamps for branding. The
Income Tax was also talked over and the general
sentiment of the Committee seems opposed 20 any
alteration.


The admission Of Alabama was under discussion
to-day in the Reconstruction Committee but no con-
eluson was reached. The delegation from that State
presented some statements ON that subject but they
not sufficiently important 70 influence the ma
SOrity of the Committee, who are opposed to any
special legislation for the restoration of the State
The question is to be resumed al the next meeting Of
the Committee.

The murder of the Hon. D. Arcy McGee


continues to be the chief topic of discus


sion in the Canadian journals. Mrs. Nc


Gee has refused to accept the address OF


coincidence from the St. Patrick's Society,


as she thinks it primarily responsible for


the murder of her husband.


The evidence against Whelan as the ac-


tual assassin of Mr.. McGee accumulates.


Three of the prisoners arrested on suspi-


cion of completely have turned Queens ev-


idence against Whelan, whose guilt, it is


said, is almost clearly established. The


trial is to take place during the present


week.


A whale thirty-three feet long and six


teen feet in circumference was taken in


San francisco bay lately by an adventur


Gus crew of shipcarpenters, who borrowed


a boat and apparatus from whaling bark


in the harbor. The carcass was hauled


into a shipyard, temporary inclosure


erected and six or seven hundred dollars


realized by it, besides which it was expect
ed that about twenty barrels of oil would
be made when the work of cutting in""
was accomplished.


A special dispatch from Ottawa, Upper

arrested on the charge of having assassin


ated Mr.. Darcy McGee, and against
, whom the evidence is said to be very
, strong, belonged to Fenan Lodge at
Quebec, and subsequently to a New York
Circle. 1t is also stated that plot to

maxi e ntlen el say one thing and do another;
hat they had shut their eyes to evidence and jus.
tics; but, leaving all these specuatons aside, he
| was willing to admit that they had acted aosOrd
ing TO their conscience.


| The clerk Of the House announced concurrence
| in the following bills: ..
Senate bill No. l4-an act relative to the First
and Second District Courts.


An act relative TO the investigation of the affairs
Of the State auditor.


An act relative 10 contested election cases
Mr.. Braughn resumed. He now confined him
| self to the law and evidence. The committee
having declared that the evidence which was given
| before notice 10 Mr. Jewell, was illegal and should
| not be considered he asked the Senate not to be
Influenced by it, and cited the law on the subject
The law required ten days notice to be given
Bed Mr. Jewell been present not single point
could have been sustained, but Mr.. Jewell having


abandoned the case, believing that he could not OBJ


tain Justice the opposite side brought in whatever
| evidence they pleased, and it was only matter


Of surprise TO him that the Witnesses had not done
| some harder swearing. The evidence was only
/ besrsay evidence. Was the Senate to shut its


eyes to prind fdcie evidence, and entertain fimsJ
| and miserable evidence He would cause the evi-
dence to be published, should Mr.. Jewell be
| ousted, in order that the people might judge on
what grounds he was ousted. Referring TO the
| evidence of e. Lefebvre, commissioner OF election
at engine house No. g. he said, even admitting
| that the ballot box stuffed 1t did not show


that IT was to the advantage or prejudice of either
Jewell or Pnchbeck. The evidence of Mr. Staes


does not state that he the ballot boxes stuffed
| or that propositions were made to him to stuf
ballot-bo but that Boomer, commissioner of poll
| q precinct 10, had told him that other commits.
| sioners had proposed TO stuff the balotbox, aud
esides that Boemer had told Staes that he could


not say positively that the box had been stuffed.
Then comes the testimony of Mr.. Mollere, a
| gentleman of honor, and well known in this COM
muniy He swears that Mr.. +. l.. Jewell was
connected with the official printing OF the late
| Secession Convention OF louisiana. he does not
say in what manner-wheber partner, a friend
| or an employe. But does that make Mr.. Z. l..
Jewell ineligible
Mr.. O'Hara said that the question was aban-
doned by the committee.


Mr. Brauphn said that he was aware of that
fact. Therefore, senators were not TO have their
| opinions upon the question OF ineligibility, but
| simply upon the question of f,aud. Referring to
| the statement of MOllere that he had been in
formed by two commissioners that Mr.. Field, the
chairman Of the Roard Of Registrars of the hfth
ward, that they must defeat this Constitution by
| fair OF foul means, Mr.. Braughn wished to know
| why the commissioner testimony was not taken.
| Molleres evidence was only hearsay, and could
| not be entertaned.


Mr. Jewell had not introduced any rebutting
| testimony, however, convinced, as he was, that
| however respectable might have been the wit
| nesses, their testimony would not have been con-
| sidered.


| Mr.. O'Hsra, as a member Of the committee
| felt it his duty TO make few remarks. He could
| rot understand how Mr.. Jewell could make case
on such evidence as presented.
| Referring to the statement that Mr.. Jewell had
| not brought any rebutting testimony because he
| did net expect justice, be had only to say that
| "" susp cOn tests upon the baunted.n Mr..Jewell
| had asked that the committee should take spe-
| cial oath when the committee had already taken
4 an oath. The testimony Of Rigaud showed that
witness had seen added to the Democratic vote at
least 200 votes that were not tickets taken from
| the ballot box. Mr.. 0'Hara was about figuring


the alleged fraudulent votes from document he
| held in his hands. -.
| Mr. r. n. Ogden arose to point of order.
| ""1he document was not part of the report,
/ and could not be used as testimony.
| The chair would not take ths responsibility of
| deciding the point, and left it 20 the Senate.
Mr.. Campbell tbosgnt this was not the proper
| time TO take the vote Of the Ssnate.
| The chair decided otherwise.
Mr.. Coupand said that if the document was not


ncluded in the report it was through the error of
| some party.


| Mr.. Bacon said that the only evidence that


could be received was that which was embodied
| in the report.


Mr. Smith said that the reason why the evidence
| was not included was because Of a clerical error
/
| evidence.


Mr.. Lynch said that if ii was evidence, as a


majority OF the committee had asserted it was,


be would vote that 1t be received. The issue


81 ould not be lodged by taking advantage Of


teehnicslities, but should be met squsrely.


Mr.. NJ. A. Foute agreed with Mr.. Lynch. but


on different grounds, that the evidence of Ls-


febvre on the supplemental report, as be called


it, was not sworn to, and he would move to put to


the vote whether the testimony should be re-


ceived.


The testimony was rejected.


| MIR. Campbell having voted, Mr.. Ogden objected


that he should do So he being directly interested
| III the matter.


MIR. OHara moved that no member whose seat


was contested should vote on the question.


Mr.. Wi cox moved to lay on the table.


| Mr.. Lynch moved TO recommit the whole matter.


Mr.. Campbell moved to amend by providing


thst TIE committee be instructed to summon Judge


Lesumont and such other persons as they may
| deem necessary.


| Mr. 0'Hara claimed the floor.


The chair said that the senator had lost his priv


ilege by making motion and sitting down.


motion was then made to lay the motion to
| recommit on the table. Laid on the table.


Nr. Ogden moved 10 reconsider.


| Mr.. Blsckman moved TO lay on the table.
| Mr.. o Hara took the floor before a second could
| be obtained, and resumed his argument. The evi.


dence that had been rejected, improperly, he


thought was by the trickery OF law. Ii should


have weight with the senators. de would say


with Patrick Henry :"" II it was not Law, 1t wa
| JUSTICE"" He was fully convinced that fraud haC
been committed in this case that Mr.. jewell wa'


improperly seated IN the Senate. He was thun
derstT0ck when he heard in the committee of the
enormous frauds, and could not conceive how mel

them. II such things occurred IN New Orleans

would occupy, moved to adjourn.

failing the circumstances under which the

Postmaster General Randall having been called
to the subject, he Immediately instituted an in
vestigation. and upon ascertaining the facts as
heretofore stated, decided that what Mr. Lynch

Grafton; for it should be well known that the
mails are carried by contract, at SO much per-
annum; and be the quantity of matter great or
small, there was no more charge to the Gov

Mr.. Lynch is member of the House Com
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads, and we
learn from member of that committee that
he has uniformly voted in favor of abolishing
not only the use of stamps on franks, but also
of the franking privilege itself. AS member
ofthat committee he voted for the bill, which
will be shortly introduced, to abolish the priv
ilege; and when it is brought forward for ao-
ton in the House it will find no more earnest
supporter. Mr.. Lynch is utterly opposed to
the franking privilege, but so long as it is per-
mitted by law, he simply uses it as other mem.
bers do. He has done no more. The law is to
blame, not Mr.. Lynch."

to how they will vote upon the question.
1t is not known that they have given even

main inevitably in the interest OF labor. He was in

to the industrial classes. The nation could not
afford to violate Its faith, and must preserve its
fame from the least taint or suspicion. But, the
other hand nothing was clearer than that the same
evenhanded justice that was done to the b0ndhOld-
ing class could be done to the industrial classes, out
OF whose labor the taxes were paid. The debt
should be paid on the basis on which it was con-
traced. 1t would not be just to pay 1t any other

agreed to be paid In coin, and paying In coin that
part agreed to be paid In coin the bondholder would
receive all that he could properly ask. When he
asked more he asked that for his own benefit injus

any amount that he might be able to control.

per cent, asked Mr.. Holman whether he would vote
Tor such proposition.

He has made study of the quack medicine

If by his advertising genius and quackery
he can pass off mechanical humbugs as valu-
able inventions, why may not the same talent
be made useful in disposing of the political

this weeks issue of the Maine Democrat, and
see how the real simon pure Democracy is ad-
vertised. We regret that we cannot transfer

without any infringement upon the patent,
that one of the wood cuts representing view

produce them.


Again, local Democratic papers have made
great ado about an increase of official force in
the Custom House, uncalled for by increase of
business. That lie has been sent deeper than
plummet sounds, by communication pub
lished in these columns showing the increase
OF business under Republican administra-
ton.


1t has been charged that James G. Blaine
wrote the article purporting to be from the
pen of wounded soldier, exposing the method
proposed by the Democracy for tightening the
bardens of taxation. Col. Smith of the Som

The great Mirabeau when conversing onpe on tne

Tunes and crown me with flowers"" II the French
2itt6rateur and sybarite had lived to-day and seen
now American citizens honor their heroic dead, he
would have witnessed the fuflment to the letter Of
hs poetical conception The great mortuary festival
anaugurated on Saturday was concluded yesterday
and some slight acknowledgment has been paid by
the people towards the debt OF gratitude owed by
them to those who offered up their lives for the sake
OF Union, undivided nationality and freedom.

although 1t not so melancholy In Its character it
was far more general and effective. On the previous
day the weather had been gloomy, and any one who
visited the cemeteries then would have thought that
some large funeral was taking place. Yesterday, on
the contrary, the day splendid beyond descrip-
light; the summer winds breathed gently through
the atmosphere, invigorating nature with their tonic
properties; the birds sang and the trees bore them
Selves bravey in their fresh, green foliage and the
cemetery at Cypress Hills in Consequence had sort

Of their fallen brethren than weeping like children

same direction, the street cars being also lncon-
were also to be seen trudging along on the same
course and led by the same motve-to pay tribute to

Mr.. FOute-I believe, 1Ir. President, that
this is the proper time for discussing this

| Sen&tes time since the organization. l am
| here, sir not from any spirit of ambition or
vala.glory, but from sense of duty to those
| who sent me here-the same duty which
/ trust Inspires the heart of every member
of this body; and here / will say that l lis
tened with pleasure to the sentiments ut
tered the other day by the Senator ron
| Carroll, that whatever personal or political
preferences, that he was here to do his duty

liberty without law, nor law without

| liberty without law would run into
anarchy and licentiousness; without liberty
| law would become tyranny and oppression.
| We are about to take a step in very grave
| legislation. Let US pause and hesitate. Let
not this hasty and oppressive legislation be
forced upon this people. | ask that we
shall reason together. Let us 'do unto
others as we would that others should do

! words ''coloredr and white of the words

we might call ourselves Louisiantans, and
legislate for Louisiana and her benefit.
/ Now, sir, let as look into the history OF this
| body. Born on last Monday week ago,
and undergoing all the labors of childbirth,
it came into the world an incomplete body.
The political medicine men got together
| and concluded they could make whole
being OF it. The Democratic members,
| as they are called, who were impstiently

members that upon sober second thought
they would be admitted, and they were led
to believe that the roll of Senators furnished
by the military commander of the district
| would be read and all whose names ap-
peared upon it admitted. In compliance

| found that there was an exception made as
If there had been q mental reservation
against one of the members who had de-
elared that all he wanted was to be right
fully admitted to the floor and then he
| would resign.


Well, sir, after being qualified under the
constitution there began the rapid intro.
duction of bills-bills of the very greatest
Importance to the State and to the city,

leity Of New Orleans, family of bills look.
ing to one purpose. First comes this police
bill which we believe infringes upon the
| chartered rights of the city of New Orleans,
| which is in violation Of the very constitu
tion under which we are acting. Then
4 comes another bill giving to the
| Governor of the State almost imperial
power. Now, sir, have great deal OF

most clever men have met who has been
connected with Radical politics, but l am
| unwilling to give any man such power as is
conferred by that bill, A power greater
than that thaat is welded by the Sultan of
Turkey. However virtuous aud good he
may be, it is impossible for poor human
nature to WELD such power without in some
cases exercising it for personal aggrandize.
ment, and against the best interests of the
State. Sir, it makes the Governor of the
state Of Louisiana, as it were, like the -
of Ariadnes, judge, jury, and hangman-sll
in one. 1t would enable him to say with
Louis XIV, 81 am the State.n
Il Again, there comes into the Senate re.
port from temporary committee on cleo
tlons that Senator White, of Caddo, had
came before the committee, and admitted
his inability to qualify under the
constitution. The honorable Senator rose
IN his seat on the day after that report was
made, and declared the statement of the
committee to be false, and that he did not
even know the members of that committee.
and yet that report was spread upon the
journal Of the Senate, and there remains.


Pending the remarks of Mr.. Futch, the
Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives
appeared, and announced the House bill
No. 9, introduced by Mr.. Carr, relating to dis.
bursements from the treasury of the State,
had passed its third reading July Z, 1868,
and was sent to the Senate for concurrence.


The President said the old Committee on
Elections had been discharged, and all
papers in their hands turned over to the
new committee.


Mr.. Futch-That is true; nevertheless the
report of the old committee went upon the
minutes, wnere, in justice to Senator White,

more of that. We think, Mr.. President,
that the oppressive and hRsty course OF

for the purpose Of passing the Constitutional
amendment and not for this purpose.


Mr.. Ray moved that the Senator from Or
leans have leave to call up the bill


The President decided that leave having

which two carpCt-baggcrs' are represented
suspended hy the neck from n tree, with the
legend, Hang. ours, hangw The genial Ran
dolph adds: ""The Unprecedented reaction Is

""neat the African race, will be regarded rs
""hOstis sui 0eReris, and be dealt with accord
""ingly, if found hereabout when the time is
""ripe for action"" The Monitor is good enough
to give us a particular description of the
moduS Operandi as follows:


We candldly believe that the picture given to our
readers m supra, correctly represents the attitude and
shall have the folly 10 remain down South after tho
ides Of March The contract for hanging VIII be given
10 the negro, who, having mounted the carpet-bagger

that he also didn't GET Will leave the vagabonds high In





Sit viii be seen that there Ia room left on the limb
for the suspension OF any bad Grant negro who may DO

After this exhiarating description, which is
very much aided by the wood-cut above men
toned, The Monitor calls the public attention
to ""a Scalawag Justice of the Peace named
""A. II. Sealy of IIickmans Beat"" who has
discharged rascally negro from custody
and suggests that Sealy and Jack (the negro
""discharged) be turned over to the merces of
""a Ku-Klux Klan, or some other good society
protectOrate."" This mild hint to n band of
bravOs to commit only couple of murders
comes it must ,be remembered, from sheet
enthusiastically devoted to the election of
Horatio Seymour, and which proposes after his
Inauguration, on the 4th of March prox to
hang without judge or jury all Republicans,
including ""any bad Grant negro who may be
""found at the propitious moment""


In order to prove that these ru1ians are per-
fectly capable of executing the atrocities
which they recommend in a public journal, it
is enough to show. by their own exultant con-
fessions, that they have already executed the
like. Thus, The Monitor says: Five notori-
""ously bad negroes were found swinging by
""the necks to limbs in the woods of Colbert
""County, few days since They had been
""quilfv of making threats against the WhiteS.'
If threats were capital onense pray how
long would ""R. Randolph, Editor"" escape
strangulation.9 Here is another specimen OF
The Monitors persuasive ways:

stituti0n had been ascertaned. Had the whites and

turned by General Meade and he did not know that

The Conservative Convention to-day nominated
Robert r. Withers, Of Lynchburg, for Governors
General James Walker of Pulaski. for Lieutenant
Governor; J. L. Mango, Jr, Of Spottsylvania, for
Attorney General; and Marmaduke Johnson, OF
Richmond. for Congressman at large. The vote for
Governor was-wthers, 52;J. B. Baldwin, 40. Messrs
withers and Walker eligible to office under the
Reconstruction acts Of Congress, but not under the
test oath OF the new constitution. Thomas B.
Bocock, John B. Baldwin, Fayette McMullen,
George Blow and Thomas s. Flournoy
were appointed delegates at large to the
Democratic National Convention at New York. A
resolution was adopted thanking the naturalized
citizens for their heretofore unanimous cooperation
with the conservative party, and the convention ad-
tourned sine die. No platform was adopted. n
General Schofeld has appointed Francis Decordy
Mayor Of Norfolk vice the last appointee, who could
not take the test oath. f
Some Of the dissatisfied members of the Republi-
can Convention on have gotten up ticket with H. M.
Bourden, OF Norfolk, for Governor; DR.. Bayne Ia
negrO), OF Norfolk, for Lieutenant Governor and s.
B. B0ndin the present Attorney General, for that
position. The movement Is not likely to amount to
anything.


Two hundred and eighty-three municipal officers
have been appointed by General Schofeld since the

threats in bragadocia manner, that he
intended to kill man or two before leaving
town-that he hal before killed three men,
the last one at Virginia City. Whether this
.
Unfortunately his threat was too soon carried
into effect. y short time before committing
the murder, he was asked by his companion
to 60 with him into grocery store kept by
Mr.. Summerlaud-for what purpose We did
not learn-but refused TO do so, for the rea-
son. as he alleged that if he went in there he
would kill the id rascal, but shortly after
went into the store, where Gephart and the
man Timbat were having some words in
regard to an old feud that had existed between
them. Webb walked up behind Grphart.
and without saying word inflicted won I'D
in his thigh with a knife, severing the femo-
raj artery. He then left the house and went
into the street, and commenced wiping his
bloody knife on his boot leg. In a few mo-
ments Gephart came to the door as if intend
ing to come out, V hen Webb again rushed
at him. and plunged the knife into his breast
with sufficient force to break the blade. He
then went off a short distance and sat down.
Gephart then walked across the street, and
took hold of a post, and in a few moments
dropped dead The only words he was
heard to utter after the stabbug, was to ask
Webb why he had killed him. 1t appears
that there had been no words or previous
animosity existing between them, which
makes the act of Webb unaccountable, IN Ter
any hypothesis other than insanity or the
possession of devilish and malignant heart.
But from his actions before and after the
deed, the charitable plea of insanity, in his
behalf must be excluded. The wound In
Gephart's thigh. severing the femoral artery,
was the cause of his death, as the wound III
his breast was not considered mortal. Webb
was taken in custody by the authorities, and
on Monday was taken before Justice Glover
for trial when he waived an examination and
was committed to the county Jail to await his
trial. In the afternoon Constable Rose, who
had Webb in Charge, was making prepara
tions to start with his prisoner to this place.
to put him in charge of the Sheriff, and on
leaving the room where be had Webb In
custody, to ascertain if the team he had EN-
ployed for the occasion was ready, he had to
pass through another. when, as soon as he
had got through the inside, door, it was closed
and locked by some person there for the
purpose-the front door having been previ
ously fastened. undoubtedly with the design
of keeping him out of the way. Webb being
thus left without protection, was taken hy a
mob, consisting of abOu. one hundred per
sons, and hung to the limb Of a tree, short
distance from the place. Thus ended the
career Of one who, if report be true and We
have no reason to doubt its correctness-wa:
reeking with crime of the greatest magnitude
Mr.. Gephart was a man well known in thu
community in which he lived, of good repu
fation and unsullied character, which, NJ
doubt, added much to the undue excitemen
actuating the mob."

DR.. E. L. Martin, of Sussex, Secretary.


A committee of five from each county

for the Convention.


w. G.. Whitley, Esq of New Castle,
after few preliminary remarks offered
resolution that no person be allowed to act
as an alternate OF substitute for regular
delegate unless he reside in the Hundred
in which the vancy occurs.


Samuel Townsend, Esq. of New Castle,
offered an amendment to Mr.. Whiteley's
motion, that the delegates from each
county be allowed to cast the whole fifty
votes to which they were each entitled
according to the old established usages of
the party.


The original motion and the amendment
were advocated with considerable force.
Mr.. Townsend was appealed to, to with
draw, which he declined to do.


DR.. Pratt, of Kent, rose to point of
order, that as the Convention was not
regularly organized, all other business was
out of order.


DIR. Merritt, of New Castle, also rose
to point of order, insisting that the roll
of delegates should first be called, when
on motion the whole subject was laid over
until after the regular organization, and
a recess of half an hour was taken to give
the Committee on Organization time to
make ""a report.

resolution of the Ohio Legislature resembling the
ratification of the fourteenth amendment, together
with the protest of the Republican members of that
| body, denouncing the decision as not representing
| the wishes of the people. A debate occurred, in
which Senators Sherman Sumner, and others pro-
nounced this act of the Legislature wholly unprecc-
dented, and Reverdy Johnson admitted that it had
no validity The subject was referred to the Judiciary
Committee, to inquire into and report upon. The
reconstruction debate commenced at l o'clock.
Senator Howe of Wisconsin took the floor and deliv
cred long and effective speech in vindicaton of the
| Republican policy. No other speech was made.
Reyerdy Johnson gave notice that he would call up
the resolution for the admission of his colleague on
| Monday.


| The most important part of proceedings in tho
House to-day was the passage of the Cotton Tax BILL
as amended and agreed to by the Senate. An hour
was consumed in debate the subject the high pro-
tecive tariff men opposing the Senate amendment to
repeal all duty on all imported cotton. The bill, as
finally agreed to, cxempts from tax all domestic cot
ton raised after JAM 1863 and admits free OF duty
all cotton imported after Nov. 1863. The bill now
goes to the President for his signature Only forty

The Associated Press agency OF this city was used


last evening for the purpose of circulating an in
famous slandcr upon the Commissioner Of Internal
Revenue Mr.. Rollins and OF diusing false and
malicious paper as has appeared IN print in long
time. The document is said to have been prepared
by the Secretary Of the Treasury from official
records in his Office and represented that during
the past fiscal year, rs compared with the one be-
fore the Internal Revenue receipts had decreased
nearly sOO 0 that out Of the changes Of collectors
and assessors made within the year, l9 were brought
about on the recommendation of Nr. Rollins and
only 20 by Mr.. Johnson; that in the districts where
Mr. Rollins's appointees were placed the ave
rage losses were nearly $4,000 per district,
and that in those districts where Mr.. John
IaI la
losses averaged $4,000 per district; in other
words, that Mr.. Rollins's men stole nearly three
times as much as Mr.. ,Iohnson's. From beginning TO
end there is not one word Of truth in the statement.
The Secretary of the Treasury neither prepared nor
caused TO be prepared the document in question: and
knows nothing whatever about II. Mr. Rol-
lins did not suggest dozen changes in the De-
partmont. and the removals were made. in
most cases, against bis express wishes. The
paper was drawn mp at the instigaton of
the President, by clerk in the Treasury Depart
ment and was intended as a means Of escape from
the odium Of having placed the public purse in the
hands of gang Of thieves. Ii is charged in official
circles that the document came from the White
House: that Mr.. Johnson authorized its concoction
and publication ana that the whole transaction il of
n piece with the Grant assault-an untrue cowardy
attack upon a faithful officer.


Mr. Toby. member of the Boston Board Of Trade
and a representative OF the shipping interest of that
city, addressed the House Committee Post Offices
and Post Roads, to-day the adyisabity OF
granting subsidies toward the establishment of
lines of steamers between the United States
and Europe, from New York, Boston and Phila-
dephia. At the conclusion of Mr.. IobyS re-
marks the Committee postponed the further
consideration of the subject until their next meet
ing. II is understood that the Committee favor the
project but they consider proper that the bids for
the service should be open, and be awarded in the
same manner as to the lines between California and
China. The Senate Committee in charge of the
same department take the contrary view. and hold
that there should be no competition, but that one
two lines should be established, guaranteeing inter-
est on n certain amount of bonds for the construc-
ton of an American line of steamers to ply between
New York and other cities. The Government to pay
interest on the same. The postages and lien on the
steamers 10 be reserved as indemnity against loss.


The Military Committee of the House have IN
structed Gen. Dodge 10 report bill establishing an

the present terminus Of the Pacific Railroad, such ar
senal to be for the supply of troops engaged IN the
Indian hosllities in that vicinity This action has
been taken on the recommendation of the War De-
nortment the cost of the work to be limited to $50
COO with a view to retrenchment The Committee
have also authorized Gen. Ketchum to report a


luton directing the Secretary of War to concentrate
the various offices and storehouses of the Department


in New-York and Brooklyn, now rented at cost of
$4,000 annually. in two buildings one for offices
and the other for stores The latter is to be situated
at some point in the harbor and the rent of both is to
be within $4,000 per annum. This will be large
saving to the Government and will greatly facilitate

WArERFoRD.-Mr. Grubb was recently
reelected Vice Chairman of the Waterford
Poor Law Board of Guardians. In report
ing the affair, the Waterford Ners says !:
Although we think Catholic and a Liberal
ought to all one of the principal chairs at
our Poor Law Board, as is usually the case
in all Catholic unions elsewhere, still we
are glad that the Liberals rallied round Mr..
Grub ON Wednesday, when an effort was
made by the Conservatives to oust him.
The result of this election, as also that of
the mayoralty, proves that the old Ascend
ancy party is all but dead in Waterford.


On the morning of the first ult., at his
residence, near Kilsheelan, John Mulcahy,
aged thirty -eight was found dead in his bed.
An inquest was held, and verdict, died
from natural causes, returned."

arrested under the lord lieutenant's war
two months, was discharged from custody
on q memorial forwarded by Mr.. NJ. ]. Col

also been n short time in custody under the

The same paper, under date Of the 4th
ult. says: The Cork correspondent of the
l11sh Builder notices q considerable inn
provement in the building business in this
city, which for some time had been at a
stand still. Owing to the increased anima-
tion in the trade, the masons, in the middle
of March, obtained an advance Of three shil-
hngs per week on their wages the stone
cutters also demanded concessions, but
were refused, and q strike took place. The
men and employers have generally come to
terms since, and the only works stopped
are those at st. Vincent's, Sundays Well,
for which Mr.. McMullen is contractor. The
carpenters, following the example of the
other trades, are stated to be at present on
strike for similar advance to that obtained
by the masOns. The masters are willing to
yield to the demand on condition that the
hour system "" is adopted, but this is OBJ
jected to by the men. The principal works
now in progress are the Protestant cathe-
dral and the alterations in the county Jail,
which include the erection of pretty cha
pei. Tenders have been invited for the
erection Of school buildings, and residence
for the Christian Brothers at Doneraile, at
cost estimated at E30OO, and several other
works are in contemplation. =l.1
On the evening Of the 7th ult., four men
entered the house of Samuel Miner, John

had forced open. No one, however, was

The Secretary of State to-day sent to the Senate
large mass Of correspondence, &c, in reply to a
resolution OF that body relating to the arrest and
trial OF the Rev. Robert B. Lynch and others by the
government OF Great Britain for alleged participation
In the Fenian raid into Canada in 1868. The
documents show what has been done by the
government Of the United States, including
letters from Secretary Seward, who, in wri-
ting to Rufus King at New York, on the Sd OF
February, regrets to say that upon renewed re-
quest OF the Executive OF the United States the Brit
Ash government Is Just now entirely disinclined TO
exercise further clemency In the case OF Robert b.
Lynch; and in replying to note OF Mr. Ford, OF the
British Legation, February 4, says that Mr. Lynch,
who was convicted for alleged participation in the
so-callcd Fenan raid never united insuch invasion,
but on the contrary denounced the scheme as i'm
practicable He regretted that the British govern
ment would not mitigate the sentence.


Hon. Chas. Sitgreaves having written letter 70 Mr.
Seward asking the Intervention OF the government
In behalf Of John Gallagher, under sentence of death

relary replied March that our government watches
with interest the affairs in that province but Is not
that he is at present exposed TO execution for

Secretary when his case was tried 1t will receive
attention. 1t is the understanding Of the
State Department that where sentences have been rem
dered by the courts they have been commuted by the
British executive authorities to Imprisonment in all
eases brought TO its attention.

bench. Information has also reached here that
Colonel Kassey, sheriff; Mr.. r. Buford, clerk of
the Circuit Court, and Mr.. A. A. Arthur, clerk Of
the County Court of Bedford county, have been
removed by the General, and parties who can take
the ''ron-clad"" appointed in their stead.


There is sharp contest among radical politi.
clans here in relation to the next GovernOrship.
Hawkshurst, Of Alexandria; General Welles, Of
Washington, and Judge Kives are those mentioned
in connection with the nomination. Several eau
cuses have been held upon this subject, Hunni-
cutt, who was upheld by small clique, being
thrown out new phase given to this affair is
the expected removal OF the Governor and all
other State officials by General Grant when the
pending act of Congress becomes Law. Some
radical iavorite, perhaps one Of the above three,
will then be appointed. This would give that in
dividual full control Of the State, with ample
opportunity to secure his election.

The Hon. james Martin. moderate and
rory nuiet Republican member of the. Leglsla-
ture for the Abbeylle district, was assasslnateGi
ON Oct by four Democrats. The agent OF
the Freedmen's Bureau reports IL murders IN
thIs district, and resigns because it is too hot
for him. On the 10th the Hon. b. +. Randolph,
a colOred State Senator of South carolina,
while engaged in ""stumpngp his district Tor
Grant and COlfax, was murdered by three
Seymourites in front of the depot at C0kes-
burg, Abbeville County. On the 18th the Hon
Lee Nance a member of the State COnstltu-
ti0nal Convention, was murdered AT NSWpelIy
Court House. About the same time, the non
q. w, Dill, prominent hepuonWeani dnd de1eS
freedman travelling with him, and two freed
men named Tabby Simpson and johnson
Gloscoe, were murdered for advocating the
Grant and ColfaX ticket.


In GEORGIA. Col. A. T. Akerman. one of
the ablest lawyers of the State an old resi-
dent, now eleetOr on the Grant ticket, was
refused permission to stop at any public house
In LincOlntOn, Willie court was sitting there,
because the landlords feared the destruction OF
their premises and q riot. His only 0fense was
supporting Grant and COlfax In Ware County,
a citizen of the North had invested his
entire capital III building a sawmill whIch
would have greatly benefited that region. No
sooner had lie completed it than the Seymour
men of the cUunty, Disgusting themselves as
negroes, mobbed him, gave him 76 lashes with
. rawhide, drove him pennlless out OF tno tno
county, and took possession of his null.
w. S. Walker, u Republican speaker of Early
County, Ga, and Charles Taylor, black man
who accompanied him, were murdered for
holding meetings for Grant and ColfaX. In
another county, two Republican speakers were
waited upon it their lodgings at night by the
Ku-Klux, under pretense that the latter were
contributing, and wanted to relight Their
torches. No sooner were the doors opened
than q vOlley was fired into the house, killing
the innocent hosts, who had not even COM
mitted the Otieuse of working TO elect Grant
and Colfax. We say nothing of the Camilla
massacre, and other outrages which disgraced
the State of Georgia during September, and
which cost the lives of about 100 persons.


In ALABAMA, either from the extraordinary
tranquility 0f the State or the inadequate
means of Obtaining information, the months
record of crime is confined to the murder of
the President of Loyal League.


in LOUISIANA, we hear of the mObblng and
clubbing of Mr.. Bentley, editor of The 81.
Landry Progress, at Opelousas, the destruction
Of his newspaper and office, the lynching and
murder of his cO-editor Mr. Durand, and a
Democratic reign of riot, blood, and terror, IN
which about 100 negroes are killed and 90
wounded. while four whites are wounded and
none killed. As the rot was accompanied by
disparity of loss between the two parties may
doubtless he accounted for upon the theory
that the blacks were first disarmed and sangh-
tered afterward. AT Shreveport Louisiana,
6fteen Republicans and three SeymOurltes were
Killed in u melee. On October rs, q Seymour
mob destroys the Office of The Rdpides Tribune
at Alexandria, Louisiana: Near the same time
the Sheriff of lberville (Rep) is murdered IN
his bed and Judge Valentine Chase anu ten;
III. II. Pope, the Sheriff of Franklin County and
formerly Colonel of the Iwenty-seoo Limos
Regiment, and Justice OF the Peace IN Cadda
Parish, are all murdered. About the 24th ana
25th the Seymour Knights OF the Parish OF 81;
Barnard, adjoining New Orleans kill several
negroes. In the melee a baker and his son kill
q eolored member of the new metropolitan po-
lice. The blacks retallate by killing the mrI
derers and burning their bakery. The Rebel
abatement that women and children were killed
In the affair proves to be untrue. Forthwith
the Democratic Seymour Clubs OF New-Orleans
are in a blaze They parade the streets night
and day, demand and obtain the expulsion OF
900 colOred members from the police force,
to appear in the streets. Meanwhile, the

Cecil county, died very suddenly in ElktOn, on
Saturday afternoon last of disease of the heart
He had been in his usual health, we are in
formed, up to a few minutes previous to his at
tack.


Change of Mail Route-We are informed,
says the Cecil Democrat, that it is the nten-
tion of parties interested, to make application
to the Post Office Department for change of
the mail route from Elkton to Chestertown so
that the daily mail from Elkton to Chestertown,
may pass through CayOt's Corner and Cecilton,
thence to Sassatras, instead of through St. Au-
guStine and Warwick as at present. The distance
over the proposed route it is claimed will not
be materially greater, while the roads will be
much better than those over which the stage
has now to travel. The only Post Offices that
will fail of supply by the new arrangement are
those of ST. Augustine and Bohemia Mills.

RESOLUTIONS.


The majority report of the Committee on
Elections and Returns was taken up and
read as follows:


CONCLUSIONS OF THE COMMITTEE.
mature deliberation and careful review of
the evidence submitted to them in the case
OF G. G. Antoine, who contests the right of
Hon. Reuben White to his seat insthe Sen.
ate of the State of Louisiana, from the
Twenty-6rst Senatorial District, YOUR COM
mittee are of the opinion that Mr.. White is
clearly DISTINGUISHED under the provisions
of the fourteenth article known as the Con-
stitutional amendment of the Constitution
of the United States, for the reason that he
was member of the Legislature of the
State of Louisiana prior to January 26, 1861,
and his continuing to act in said Legislature
while 1t was under the jurisdiction of the
so-cal!ed Confederate States; and for the
further reason that he otherwise rendered
aid and comfort to the ennemies of the
United States government after having
taken the oath to support the Constitution
OF the United States and obey the laws
thereof. Therefore, Mr.. White is consider
ed ineligible to hold any office whatever
until relieved from his disability by the Con.
gress of the United State, and your com.
mittee respectfully recommend the adoption
OF the following resolutions:


ReSoLCed, That Reuben White is ineligible
to his seat as Senator from the Twenty.frst
senatorial District of the State of Louisiana
for the reasons set forth in this report. and
that his seat be declared vacant: and be it
further


Resolced, That c. C. Antoine be permitted
to appear before your committee and estab.
llsh his right to a seat in your honorable
body in accordance with his petition and
the petition OF other voters IN the Twenty
hrst Senatorial District, that he may receive
full Justice and relief In the premises.

Integrity of Senator Lynch. and am salts

REIMBURSEMENT. Why, sir, we have upon
LUIS LUIS Iloor three gentlemen who were in the

lu lhat cause They took part in that con-
Ilct, ana concur in what the Senator
rom carroll has said, and accord
to them the highest credit for the
PERSONAL bravery and enthusiasn1 they
may have shown in the contest These
gentlemen are here; they have sustained
the fact that they have aided in reconstruc-
ton, and by virtue of that fact they sit here.
| Why should not others be required to do
the same thing before being permitted TO
participate in the government Of the State
| The number is very small, indeed, who are
really disfranchsed by this article ninety
nine of the Constitution, and the terms oft
are certainly not unreasonable.


Mr.. Poindexttr: Mr. President, l don't
exactly know the meaning of this amend
ment. wish to know whether repeating
this article ninety.nine to-day will do any
good to any party before two years have
gone by?


Mir. Ray: In about two years it will be
submitted to the people.


Mr. Poindexter: Well. do you believe that
any gentleman here will thank you for ii?
No, sir; they will think it is only done for
policy. And it won't do them a bit of good
until it is ratified by the people OF the State.
Then why do you ask for il at this session
of the Legislature? 1t only makes you think
in your own opiuion, that some one will
think better of you for it. (Laughter.) If

Mr.. Lynch wish, Mr.. President, to make

not be insensible to the simple virtue Of
gratitude. No less a parsonage than the
candidate for the Nice-PresidenCy OF the


Democratic ticket, General Frank P. Blair,


advocated on the stump the election


Of Senator Pollard to 4 seat in the Con-


stitutional Convention. Mr.. McCarde, of
Of the Nicksburg Times, also published

For distinguished services in the Consti-
tutional Convention, lie secured plomi-

next Governor and judging from the rapid
ity Of his promotion, IS there anything I'M
possible in the supposition that some day,
he may not be President Of the United
States5 (Great laughterl.


Now, sir, in view Of the substantial ser
vices rendered the Senator by these Demo-
Gratis in giving him such political prom-
nence, gratitude demands that he ought not
to oppose the entire removal of this disfran-

conscientiously. believe that they thought
they were doing God service. They went

should have any influence upon my feelings,
my brothers would have it, because believe
they are as honest as | am; and when the
last clarion notes of the war had been
sounded and peace was proclaimed through

GEN. JOHN A. LOGAN, of Illinois, will speak


follows:

Observation-Disclosures,",,"A fitting climax to the long list of Demo
cratic blunders for the year of grace 1868 is the
nomination of Charles A. Shaw, of Bddefcrd,
by the Democrats of the first District as can
didate for Congress. At the Convention yes
terday William P. Hanes, of Biddeford, was
first nominated by acclamation; not desiring
to swell the already formidable number of de-
feated Democratic candidates whom the peo-
pie of Maine have been consigning to oblivion
for twelve years past, he was discreet enough
to decline. Then Mr. Shaw's friends presented
his name, and he received the nomination.


Mr.. Lynch was sure of reelection under any
circumstances, but the madness of his oppo-
nents has now insured him as large majority
as he received in 1866. He is man whose po-
sition in public life is due to solid worth, to
stirling integrity and to valuable public servi-
ces. To exchange him for an individual who
has sought notoriety by system of self-adu-
lation that finds no parallel in the country,
unless it be in the conduct of gentleman who
is now investigating in practical way the
workings of the various debtors prisons in
Great Britain, would be piece of folly which
no sane man can anticipate


The Republicans of Connecticut once tried
the experiment of nominating p. T. Barnum
for Congress. The result was that Democrat
represented them in Congress instead of
mountebank, and they richly deserved that
punishment It is doing Mr.. Shaw no injus-
tice to say that he is a sort of provincial Bar
mum. That he is successful business man is
some credit to him, if the strange arts-we do
not mean dishonorable, but simply empirical
arts-by which he has become so, are not too
curiously investigated. The manner in which
he obtained his nomination was in strict ac-
cord with his methods of proceeding in busi-
ness. Having made up his mind that the life
that appeared with so many embellishments in
the chronological journal would be well
rounded by term at Washington, he immedi-
ately invested in newspaper, and has been
blowing his own trumpet with persistent but
futile industry ever since. When the returns
show majority of from three to four thou
sand for Lynch on thel evening of the 18th of
September he will probably dispose of his in
terest in the Democrat at once and devote him
self to business ever after."

says that Mr. Lynch introduced his bi II for the
gradual resumption of specie payments and
for the prevention of undue expansions and
contractions of the currency just before the ad.
journment of Congress, merely for buncombe,
and with no expectation that they would pass
This is a-mistake. He introduced them
months ago and urged them upon the atten-
ton of the House as frequently as possible.


The Tribune's Washington special says that
some persons are there from Maine, represent
ing the interests of the Seymour and Blair
ticket who are striving to have johnson do
something for the ticket by making a new dis
tribution of the federal patronage in this
State. They say it is vitality important to
the Democracy that they should carry Maine
or at least make significant reduction in the
Republican majority. From this it would ap-
pear that there are still a. few Democrats left
who can tell the truth under the pressure OF
an extraordinary emergency, but not the whole
truth even then, for no use that Mr.. johnson
can make of federal patronage will reduce the
Republican majority in this State below twen-
ty thousand."

Enderton Esq. Quite a number Of witness.
es testified as to finding the body, one to
hearing a shot and seeing smoke near the
place, and all agreeing as to the pockets
being turned out, and that the body WAS
quite warm when found.


Mr.. John Goats, shepherd, who lives in

has a large scar above his right eye and is
full blooded negro, The negro had bird
in his hand, between 4 and o'clock, when
witness saw him on Saturday.

she saw two men on the railroad track,

then stoop down, and then 60 Of north to,

were at home, at her house, or the man with
the gun would have been followed.


The Jury found that the man was murder.
ed by some person unknown to them, aud
that suspicion rested upon certain negro
as the guilty party,


The negro had previously been arrested,
the circumstances being strongly against
him. lie was confined at Green River, and
his examination commenced on Monday at.
ternoon, before Justices Enderton and Sharp
y. 5. Buckles, of Geneseo, for the people
and Judge Wait of Geneseo, for the de.

Resides the testimony before the coroner's
jury, as referred to, it WAS found that who
ever robbed the murdered man stole his hat


With the negro was found two hats, one
of which fits the head of the murdered man
and does not fit the negro. The negro also
had money but he could give no satisfac.
tory account how he come by it. There was
also found, near where the murdered man
lay, some pigeon feathers which probably
came from the dead bird seen in the negros
hand. A pair Of shoes were found, near
where the murder was committed, and in the
direction the man with the gun was seen to

The very men who left FERGUSON beeding and
insensible are probably walking Trough our
public thoroughfares plotting sonp new vio-
lence and fearless of detection.


If our police are incapable of meeting eff
ciently this public danger let theil power be
strengthened. No money is better spent than
what is judiciously laid out in rganizing
thoroughly efficient corps of detecti-es. Some
thing must be done to stamp out the evil we
complain of. In our Western cities the citizens
would have organized, in circumstances like
ours, vigilance committee and other driven
the ruffans from their midst or committed them
to the tender mercies of Judge Lynch. We
do not propose this as an example. That is
the der,sier resort when everything else fails.
But in the meanwhile, we repea again, this
lawlessness has proceeded to Mch length
that for the security of life and poperty some
more vigorous steps must be taker to put down,
and at once, these organized banls of thieves
and assassins."

Mr. Lynch of Maine has pending in the House
of Representatives plan for gradually rcsum-
ing specie payments Briefly stated, it con
sists in issuing from the Treasury coupon
bonds to the amount of sS3OOOOO,OO of de
nominations of 800 and upward, bearing
interest at four per cent, payable quarterly III
lawful money, and making these and greenbacks
reciprocaly convertible into each other at the
pleasure of the holder; after the l5 of May
next, all United States legal tender notes re-
ceived by the United States say Sis0000,000
per year. or 900 per month, are to be re-
tired and destroyed, and in their stead notes pay
able one year from date in coin, are to be issued
to all creditors to whom legal tenCcrs have
heretofore been paid BY the lst of Nay, 1869,
$3.50 900 in coin notes would have aiken the
place of the present greenbacks, ha'ing been
paid out for salaries, Government contracts
currency interest. and all expenses of the Gov
ernment. These notes will come me at the
rate of half million of dollars a day dnring the
year 1869, and are to be redeemed in gold. BY
repeating the same operation for 1SG9and 1870
the whole issue of greenbacks now Outstanding
would have been converted into demand notes,
and would be redeemable in gold by My |, 1871
Mr.. Lynch says that he firmly BELIEVES that
the presentation and redemption of the first
$150OO,0OO of these notes would so establish
public confidence as to reduce the prmium on
gold to nominal figure. The DILIGENCE be-
tween the plan and that Of immediate resump
ton is that it limits the amount of mites which
can he presented to the Governmnt for re-
demption to half a million of dollar per day
after one year from the lat OF May next. AS
our gold receipts from customs amount TO about
third Of million day, it is thought that so
gradual a run on the Treasury ia its gold
| could be successfully met until the public con-
fidence had so far improved as to nduce the
premium on gold to a nominal fipre, when
specie payment would be resumed by the banks
and the people voluntarily. Mr.. LNclIs plan
is one of the most thoughtful of th gradual
plans of resumption yet advanced."

WASHINGTON. March g. 1863
At4 o'clock vester6av afternoon the Scrgeant-at-
Arms of the Senate called at the White House, and
delivered TO the President the summons OF the High
Court Of Impeachment TO appear before 1t on Friday
the 18th inst The President quietly remarked that
the simmons would receive his attention and the
Sergeant-at Arms retired The President spent most
of today with several of his legal advisers. This
evening number of people were at the White louse,
seeking an audience, but MIR Johnson too busy
20 see any one There is doubt whether ho will
sppear in person before the Senate on Friday next.
Gen. Thomas will hereafter attend the Cabinet
meetings as Secretary of War al interim, and the
President viii transact through him all business
pertaining to the War Department. 1t is presumed
that the House impeachment Committee will give
their immediate attention to this virtual Organlza-
ton of An independent War Department III the
White House.


The House Managers of the impeachment of
President johnson are holding daily sessions. and
have already summoned number OF witnesses;
among them are the reporters who reproduced MI
.Johnson's s22d-ofFebruary speech Mr.. Bingham is
severely ill., and confined to his bed, but 1t Is hoped
that he may be able to 60 to work on Friday next





on Saturday was to bring up for consideration the
appropriation bills already passed by the House.
Very little other legislative business 1t is under
stoed is 10 be brought forward between this date and
Friday next The Senate is far behind the House in
ITS work All the appropriation bills except two
have been passed by tho House and on the table
.nf the Senate Committee Appropriations. Mr.
Morrill, chairman of that Committee, will strive to
have Oh these disposed of before anything else is
considered


The gouso on Saturday was engaged in the dis
,nssion of financial measures exclusively Speeches
were made by Messrs Blaine. Broomall, Holman and
Lynch Mr. Holman, who apparently spoke for the
Democrats, arraigned the Republican party and adj
vocated the payment of the debt in the currency in
which it was contracted Mr.. Blaine confused MIR.
Holman considerably by few pertinent questions
and forced him to abandon some Of the positions
which he had assumed Mr. Lynch ably advocated
return TO specie payments opposed contraction
of the currency and endeavored TO demonstrate that
the resumption of specie payments would settle every
question and solve every difficulty connected with
our finances. At the beginning of the session Mr..
Lynch introduced bill making provision against
undue expansions and contractons Of the currency,
tho substantial features of which have been inc0r
pOrated in the funding bill reported by the Senate
Finance Committee.


Senator Sherman intends to call up his Funding
bin again tomorrow. Several Senator's have pre-
pared speeches the subject and the fredes OF the
measure are anxious to bring it to conclusion at as
early day as possible.


The Finance Committee are nearly ready to make
report on Senator HendersOns Finance bill The
Finance Committee and the Committee on Appro-
priations viii press the various before them
10 the exclusion of all other legislation, with view
of getting as many as possible of them disposed of
before the Impeachment trial begins which will
pFObably be about the Goth Of March Nearly all OF
the Appropriation bills have passed the House and
are on file in the Senate Committee room. The House
has its business very far advanced and there are only
one or two insignificant Appropriation bills that have
not been passed. The Tax bill drags It's slow length
along and il is difficult 10 guess when the sub-COm-
nittee will be able to report it, It is evident from
the action in both branches Of Congress so far that
they do not intend TO pass any Of the bills
before them looking to a depletion of the treasury


IL was supposed, when the election of Gen. Vickers
was announced, that Maryland bad chosen Senator
who could be sworn in without any difficulty but II
appears that he too labOrs under the same disabilities
as his predecessor Mr. Thomas, and that objec-
tion viii be made 60 his admission until his case
has been investigated by the Judiciary Committee.
II is said that Gen Schenok, who was in command
of Baltimore while during the war, has some
interesting facts bearing upon his case, which
will bo duly investigated. 1t seems that
Gen Schenck had occasion TO arrest Gen.
Vickers on account Of bis sentiments and
actions. The charges alleged against Gen. Vickers
are that he had two Sons in the Rebel army, and
that he maintained correspondence of q dlslOyal
spirit with them and did all he could TO discourage
enlistments while the war III progress One of
his sons was while living at his fathers house. one
of the perpetrators of the outrage last year on the
man who was selling books on the eastern shore of
Maryland the cause OF attack being that be was a
Northern Republican.


The Reconstruction Committee have substantially
agreed to report a bill to the House tomorrow for
the admission Of Alabama under the new COnstitu-
ton providing for representation in Congress as
soon as the recentlyelected Legislature shalt have
ratified the fourteenth amendment TO the Constitu-
tion of the United States The loyal men Of Ala
Oana who are representing her interests in Wash

State, which win be as devoted to progress, the

The understrata democracy Of the metropolis-the
portion that is least heard OF except on election
days-the portion that does the voting the nghting
and the drinking-the O'Ranertys and Mcshanes Of
the lower wards and the Won Lagerwiskis OF the
Eastern dstrcts-have had faithful chr0nicler to
record their hopes and Wishes their fears and polit
cal views and they have, perforce, been content to
discuss the destnies of the nation the character OF
their Alderman, and their own grievances In the
reading room Of McShaunnessy's pOrterhouse or
about the round table Of Herr Schwinegles restau-
rant; and amid the fumes of convivia spirits the
pure essence OF democracy has been nursed and the
princip:es of the party cultured into rank and
vigorous growth.


THE FIRST WARD

lane Liberty street, the East and North rivers
Many years ago was the abode Of aristocracy and
wealth. elegant buildings and sumptuous hotels
clustered about its beautiful seaside park, the Bat
terry and within its precincts was held the first Con-
tinental Congress- From an old whig stronghold 1t
has passed into the hands Of the eree democracien
and its elegant residences now the oces steam
ship lines and its political rulers the HOgans the
Foxes, the O'Flynns, the O'MOOres and the O'Qunns
The ward headquarters Of the local nagnates is the
Stevens House, and In the quiet hooks Of it's
barroom the southern members Of the civic ring
arrange their little schemes. The porter and boarding
houses Of Greenwich Washington Morris and Thames
streets the hotbeds Of the pure democratic
strength and vgor Of the ward; and here 1t s said
their views questons'o of State exchanged
Entering barrOom few nights ago we met a num-
ber OF ardent Milesians discussing the ardent and
vOciferating upon the topics OF the day. ""Be dad
James, an they tell me that Supervisor Fox is
didate for Congress agin, and that Jooge Hogan's
brother is going to the Assembly"" remarked stall
wart lOngsh0reman to O red haired barkeeper, who
leaning upon the bar, was sucking. away at a
veritable Connaught dudheen, and who bore traces
OF having been but short time in the land Of the free
and the home Of the brave. ""Be gorry, Patrick, an

when the likes Of them are going to give the poor

Proclamation


Whereas The President of the United States has
heretofore set forth several procamations, offered
amnesty and pardon to persons who had been or
were concerned in the late Rebellion against the
lawful authority of the Government Of the United
States, which proclamatons were severally issued
on the sth day of December 1863 on the Goth day Of
March, 1864. on the Goth day of May. 1865, on the
9TH day of September 1867, and on the 4th
day of July in the present year; and


Whereas, The authority of the Federal Govern
ment having been reestablished in all the States
and Territories within the jurisdiction of the United
States it is believed that such prudential reserya-
tions aud exceptions as at the dates of said several
proclamations were deemed necessary and proper,
may now be wisely and justly relinquished, and
that an universal amnesty and pardon for partic-
patton in said Rebellion, extended to all who have
borne any part therein will tend to secure permanent
peace, order, and prosperity throughout the land,
and to renew and fully restore confidence and fra
terna feeling among the whole people. and their
respect for and attachment to the National Govern
ment, designed by its patriotic founders for the
general good,


Now, therefore, be it known that i, Andrew john
son. President of the United States, by virtue OF the
power and authority in me vested by the Constitu-
tion and in the of the sovereign people of the
United States, do hereby proclaim and declare, un
condtionaly and without reservation, to all and to
every person WHO directly or indirectly participated
in the late nsurrection or rebellion full pardon
and amnesty for the ofense of treason against the
United States or Of adherng to their enemies during
the late civil war, with restoration OF all rights
privileges, and immunties, under the Constitution
and the laws which have been made in pursuance
thereof.


In testimony whereof have signed these presents
with NV hand and have caused the seal Of the
United States to be hereunto affixed.

has decided that the Cities of LynchburR and Dan

seems that large quantities Of these notes have been

But there is another point in Mr.. Lynch's con-
gre sional action TO which we now bespeak atten-
lion. It is opposer of the reciprocity treaty with
the British North .merican Provinces and an advo-
cate OF its abrngation. In this matter Mr. Lynch Ia
bored with industry and success. Those
who approve OF the abrogaton OF the treaty will of
course regard the course of Mr.. Lynch with great fa
vor, and they ought to- He labored efficiently to Sc
cure the result and voted for 1t.


I very much dislike to spoil an editorial
which probably cost some labor, and forgo the
compliment which you pay to my Industry
and success"" in defeating this important
measure; but truth compels me to say, that
as the resolution for the abrogation of the Re-
ciprocity Treaty passed the House of Repre-
sentatives Dec. Is, 1864, and did not take my
seat in Congress until Dec 8, 1865, you must
be mistaken. ..-


The advantage of Reciprocity Treaty, ad-
apted to the altered conditions of our country,
was soughtto be secured by bill introduced in
the 39th Congress by the Committee of Ways
and Means. This bill was much more advan-
tageous TO the United States than the old
treaty, and was satisfactory to the Provinces.

since. that had with the other members of
the Maine delegation voted for bill increas-
ing the duties on copper, which statement has
been copied into many other papers. You were
mistaken in this statement also. When the
vote was taken on that bill I was absent on
account OF sickness in my family. Had been
present should have voted with my col
Leagues against the BILL Every member from
Maine opposed the measure The votes of

August q, 1868.


The editorial comment on this reply to an
assertion in regard to Mr.. Lynch's COMPRESSION
al career, is that he is guilty ola small dodge.
The Argus having declared that Mr.. Lynch Ia
bored efficiently to secure the abrogation of
the Reciprocity Treaty and that he Uoted for it,
that gentleman replies that the matter was
disposed OF whole year before he had the
honor of seat in the House. Having been
convicted of lie of the most gross and ine..
cusabie character on APPOINT which might have
been settled by moments consultation of an
thorities, the Argus coolly charges that Mr.
Lynch is guilty of ""small dodge"" because, as
it alleges, he favored the repeal of the treaty,
iohera he aoas in private life. 1t appears that he
has labored for restoration of the treaty on
basis more favorable to the United States.
II PROOF OF having done precisely the reverse of
what ne is accused is ""small dodge"" how
snail we characterize fittingly the conduct of
the paper whose only answer upon being con-
vlcted OF the most wicked and inexcusable lie
is merely reiteration of the same?"

the shock oocasoned by the recent dreadful calamity
which took place in the Bowery, during the night OF
the 18th inst, than another occurance of somewhat
similar nature falls to the lot OF the chroncler to
BET before the public It appears that at about 745 yes
terday morning, the propeller F. Leverghen, having
1n tow barge laden with lumber, was rounding the
Battery from the East and standing for the North
river; close astern OF her was the Niagara with q
Dong train Of barges In tow; the Staten Island ferry
boat had just got into her dock, when q
loud report, as If heavy piece OF ordnance had
been discharged was heard, and fragments OF wood
and splnters were seen scattered and flying in all
directions from the deck of the propeller. At this
time she was about one hundred yards Off Halls
baths. One man, the steward, whose name is John
Lewis was blown into the air height of about forty
feet, and fell into the water, when he rescued by
the Whitehall boatmen. The engineer, Daniel w.
Tauman, who had just stepped out from the engine
room and was speaking to the captain ait when the
explosion took place, was precipitated INTO the river
with such force that he instantly sunk; but having
presence of mind sufficient, he struck out and rose
to the surface about thirty feet from the boat. His
comrades seeing him come to the top OF the water
hove him rope and pulled him on board.


by this time 1t became evident that the Leverghen
could not float much longer and the barge was cut
adrift half minute larer and the engineer had to
jump into the water as he found the boat beg inning
10 settle He had not vacated the sinking steamboat
very long when she went down, bow foremost, and
settled in four fathoms OF water, portion of her
flagstaff remaining above water.


AS soon as the accident occurred number OF the
whitehall boatmen, with that alaerity and spirit
that has always distinguished them put out in small
boats to the sinking propeller and one of the boats
rescued Taulman and brought him ashore He was
found to be badly hurt and scalded in the left arm
and his leg bruised.


Tho steward. John Lewis, who was blown up in
Tie air, ana has sustained injuries which may prove
fatal, was taken from the water by two of the boat
men and brought ashore The remainder Of the
crew, with the exception Of tho mate, who was in
the pilot house at the time OF the disaster and who
as supposed to have been killed by the conclusion,
were rescued by a boat from the Niagara, and all
brought ashore


At the time Of the explosion there was pressure
or seyenty-fOur pounds OF steam, and the engineer
says there was plenty Of water everything was all
right and he made an examination but few min
utes before and found water at the third cock. He
had scarcely got to the stern Of the boat
when the explosion took place. tearing the
whole Of the upper wood work away totally

the boat and starting the timbers to such degree
that in three minutes after the disaster occurred she
went to the bottom.

from the fact that the house was situated only few
feet forward OF the boiler, which was partially on

The Colored Conservatives in the south.


The New Orleans Ptcavune is gratihed to note the
large coored vote the conservative ticket In Georgia
received. good many colored men In North and
South Carolina as well as in Louisiana, have also
sided with their own people. Georgia, however, is
ahead in col0red conservatives. There seems to be
something Of organization among them also, and
they show determination to exercise the right of
franchise Regardless of radical threats The Pica-
Utfe regards this conversion to conservatism
OF the most indeed the most reassurng signs Of the

 satisfied of their guilt, would be obliged to commit them for trial.

 The recorder was at that hour holding

 court in the building at the ccrner of Jack

 son and Kearney streets, saich then serv- ed for court-honses poliees 1ee, and iail. In order 10 escape the cfoalg. which was now becoming impatient, the prisoners

 were taken ont by a back way from the ma gistrate's office, and, being placed in close carriage, were driven as rapidly as possible

 by side streets to the court house But the

 excited crowd, which had now swelIed in

 numbers to several thousands, soon learn

 ed what had been done, and, moved by one common impulse, surged like sea-waves

 through Kearney street, and reached the court house just after the two men had been taken into tue recorders courtroom Law at that time in San Francisco was very doubtful and unreliable III it's opera 1, tion. Notorious murderers, robbers, thieves, and burglars, it was we'll known, had, by some corrupt means, succeeded in continually escaping through it's meshes, until the people began to feel that the com initial of presumed criminal upon his preliminary examination was equivalent to his final escape. As the excited crowd reached the house, and learned that Stuart and Mildred had just been taken in Q rush was made for the door, the railing, inside of which the prisoners sat, trembling like aspen, was broken down, and dozen pioneers leading the rest, leaped over to- ward the prisoners box, ready to seize and bear out to the populace tine two frighten- ed wretches. It so happened that after noon, volunteer company of soldiers, whose drilling room adjoined the record er's office, where at that very time engag- ed there in drill. As the crowd broke down the railing which enclosed the sa- cred space where justice was supposed to |rnle, 3 happy thought struck the reeorder; opening Q door communicating with the drill-room, there come pouring through it in second, twenty of the volunteers with fixed bayonets, who charged upon the crowd, driving it before them like sheep. In 8 moment the court room was cleared, and in another the prisoners, more nearly dead and alive, were hustled for safety into the cells in the basement of the build ing.

 The American blood, which, up to the time of the civil war, boiled at the sight of the bayonet, was running through the veins of the populace at fever heat. All that afternoon and evening thousands of people remained about the building, shout ing for the prisoners, demanding that they should be brought out and instantly exc cuted. Harangues were made, in which the story of the robery was told over and over again; the tardy course of justice com plained of; and the probable escape of the prisoners, if left to be tried by the institu- ted authorities, predicted. The imagina- tion of the multitude was excited by glow ing pictures of San Francisco in flames, while murder, robbery and rapine were be- in committed by the gangs of Sydney Ducks' which infested the city. The invari- able conclusion of all these speeches was that the prisoners should be immediately brought out and hung. In the jail now, however, were fifty men with bayonets and loaded muskets, and not single one of the loud mouthed orators felt inclined, or man. ifested the slightest disposition to lead his hearers to an assault, which although might be successful, might also cost him his life. Toward night wiser counsels prevailed, aud although considerable number of persons remained about the jail till morning, no demonstrations of d hostile character were made upon it.

 During the night a compromise was eff fected between a self constituted commit tee of commercial men and the judicial au- thorities. It was agreed that on the fol lowing day the two prisoners should be given up to the citizens, not to be directly executed, but to be tried by Lynch Court. The rumor of this arrangement spread through the town at all early hour, and by noon nearly all the male adult pop ulation was gathered about the court house All were quiet and orderly, however, and seemed disposed to patiently await whatev- CT was to come. A little before two clock young and well-known lawyer addressed the people, advising them of tine decision which had been arrived at, and submit ting to their consideration a number of names of names of proposed members of the impromtu court. These were voted upon, and the court, in few minutes con- sistiug of two lawyers and three merchants was constituted. A merchant, who after ward became quite prominent as the Presi dent of the Vigilance Committee, of 1856, was appointed prosecuting attorney, and an old and conscientious lawyer was cho- sen to defend the prisoners.

 It was on Sunday afternoon, about three o'clock, when Berdue and Mildred were brought trembling into the same room where the day before their lives had been saved by the prompt action of the volun- teers. In the glance, however, which each of them, involuntarily, as he took his seat cast around upon the multitude assembled in the court room, he saw written upon their faces anything but hope for him. The prosecuting attorney opened the case in few calm words, and the evidence was pro- ceeded with. Jansen, in spite of his weak condition, was brought down, and gave his testimony, clearly distinctly, and with evi- dent conviction of the truth. As to the man Berdue, he again swore positively, while as to Mildred he expressed but little doubt. A circumstance had, however, come to light, while Mildred was in jail, which told heavily against him. Upon the right el- bow of his coat was found dried clot of what looked very much like, and was assum- ed to be blood; and upon piece of goods in Jansen's store was found Q correspond ing blood mark. A clerk testified that this piece of goods was on a counter near the door, and in just such a position. at just such 8 height. that Mildred in escaping might have left the mark upon it as he brushed it with his elbow. The theory of the prosecuting attorney, of course,s was, that this was Jansen's blood. A number of witnesses testified again, positively, to the identity of Wildred's companion with Jim Stuart. No witnesses, were found for"

Near midnight, the outside throng began to grow impatient, and they were harangued by several of their number. At one time rush was made into the court room with the evident intention of seizing the prisoners, but the frmness of the citi. zen guard foiled the attempt. Soon after, quite dramatic scene occurred. A wo- man young, and by no means ill-looking, bearing in her arms an infant, forced her way into the court room, as she had forced it through the vast throng about it. Her baby, and her woman's weakness, were her passports through that assemblage of rough excited men waiting and hoping for her husbands execution. She was Berdue's wife, and, arrived in the court room she threw her babe into his arms, and fell ex- hausted on the floor at his feet, where she lay speeches. and sobbing, until removed to an adjoining room. This little episode, however, had its effect in softening the crowd gathered immediately about the

 4 little past midnight, the jury sent in a communication to the court, stating that it was impossible for them to agree upon a verdict. A ray of hope shot across the fa- ces of the prisoners, as this announcement was made; but it was changed to look of dread and horror when the report having reached the outside throng, it was received by them with the general shout of chang them, hang themr' In order to allay the excitement, the presiding judge requested the prosecuting attorney to address the crowd. This he did, and reminded them that, having placed the matter in the hands of a court of their own choosing, they were bound in honor to adide by that courts de- cision. His personal popularity, rather than his argument, had the effect to lower the temperature of their passions: and when he returned to the court all was qui- ct. It was now one o'clock, and the jury again communicated with the judge, sta ting that they could not agree The court consulted together a moment in silence, and then, ordering the citizen guard to convey the prisoners back to their cells. the jury was called in and discharged; and the court adjourned to meet at the call of the president. The crowd, wearied with excitement and want of food and sleep, re- tired rapidly; but several hundred persons remained about the courtroom till day light. The mayor of the city addressed these, and recommended them to retire. He assured them that justice should be done; that the prisoners should have speedy trial by the regular judicial author itles, and begged them to leave the matter in their hands. The morning journals contained articles recommending this course, and on Monday, although knots of stragglers remained all day about the court house, no demon stration was made; and it

 

 that, as tine grand jury was then in session the prisoners should be taken immediately before it. ''If,"" Was the argument used, ""the judicial authorities fail to punish them, then We will take them in hand and execute them ourselves without judge or jury""

 The grand jury, in the course of the day, found a :'true bill, and two weeks after ward thesnen were tried before the crimi- nal court. The same evidence given upon the lynch trial was reproduced here, and Jausen, now rapidly recovering, appeared in person, and gave in his evidence clearly distinctly, and positively. Additional wit ncsses were introduced to prove the identi- ty of Berdue with Jim Stuart. Wildred's coat was passed over to prosessed chem lst, who reported the clot upon the elbow to be blood The trial lasted but few hours; and resulted in the conviction of both the men upon the crime charged iii the ndlctment-robbery- both were sentenced to undergo the extreme penalty ot the law, fourteen years confinement in the penitentiary of the State.

 Mildred was immediately conveyed there but for Berdue, a requisition was i'll Wait ing demanding him for trial as Jim Stla:t, the murderer of the sheriff of Tuba. The night of his conviction he was taken to Marysville, where the grand jury had al- ready found bill against him for murder, and in few days he was tried as Jim Stuart sworn to for Jim Staurt by at least dozen witnesses, some of whom testified to hay ing lived for months in the same mining camp with him; convicted as Jim Stuart and, as Jim Stuart, sentenced to be hung in three Aeeks from the time of his convic- tion.

 Meantime, the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance had become permanent or ganization. Already some of it's members had, by union of ruse and force, taken two notorious thieves and robbers out of jail, one Sunday afternoon, when the pris- oners were attending religious service; and thirty minutes after the two men, Whitta- ker and Mackenzie, were swinging from impromptu gibbets, extended from the committee rooms. They were, in reality, committee of vigilance"" and their argus eyes discovered much crime and many crim- inals.

Another Fatal ARRAY.",,"


Homicides have become alarmingly fire.
quent iE this county of late, and strict and
rigid administration cf the law against taking
human life is imperatiyely called for. Last
Sunday dispute arose between Michael
Moran and Henry Schroeder, alias Pete
Leopold, in Hull's store, Buckeye, which led
to rencontre, and finally ended in the death
of Moran and the dangerously wounding of
Schroeder. 1t appears. from the evidence
given before the Coroner's jury, that Moran
and Schroeder commenced a dispute in the
store about some mining affairs, and that
hard words and insulting epithets passed
between them, the latter drawing a sheath
knife and brandishing it while talking. Mo
ran finally started out of the store and called
upon Schroeder to 20 out to fight, and upon
the latter reaching the door Moran shot him
with long single barrel pistol loaded with
shot, the contents striking him in the lower
portion Of the breast, and ranging toward
the right side, inflicting dangerous wound.
On receiving the shot Schroeder, with drawn
knife, started after Moran, who retreated,
but was overtaken and stabbed four times in
the back, and once in the back part of the
head Four of the wounds penetrated the
vitals, and Moran fell and expired almost
instantly. On being notified of the occur
renee. Coroner Lynch repaired to Buckeye
and summoned jury to inquire into the facts
in relation to the affair. After full investi-
CATION verdict was rendered in accordance
with these facts. Deceased was native of
Ireland, and aged AZ years. Schroeder was
brought into town and placed in the County
Hospital for treatment."

1860 Nelson Tate registered an oath that he
would love, protect, and cherish the girl Of
his choice. How well he kept his oath and
how well he broke it is now registered in
Judge Bccker's court. The wife now sWears
that he does not support or protect her,
and that when he recently tried in vain to
borrow money from her he knocked her
down and violently iLtreated her. In life
he must answer before the Criminal Court,
and after life he Will have more to answer
for than his broad shoulders can carry. He
will then go to the left hand among the
other goats.


Here is another, but complainant is the
husband. Morris Meyers complains that
his wife Ann has left him and gone into
the rough ways of prostitution in house
on Basin street. The history Of this case is
about as follows: Morris failed, in conse-
quence of some cause to us unknown, to in
any way provide for his wife and children.
Hunger and other pressing necessities drove
the poor wife to the last extremity woman
can go, but she left the city and made her
home in small village in the I.afourche
country, from which place she almost
weekly sent to her husband the money she
had gained by her shame. One week hav-
ing failed to procure money she could moi
send any, and he then want after her, but
remained only one day. Since then she has
been able to obtain little or no money
and now this fellow goes before {
magistrate and swears that the woman h
did not support is prostituting herself
swearing that she left him without cause o.
provocation. If there is any merit in Judgt
Lynch's law, it might be applied in his case
and this community not be outraged. HI
will appear in the First District Recorder
court on the twenty.third instant agains
the woman he once took for better or worse
He will be sight to see."

 ""Our readers have already been made aware of the many murders, house burn lngs, horse stealings, counterfeiting opera tlons, and daring express robberies, that have taken place near Seymour, Indiana. by the Renos, their companions and pu pills. Every effort made thus far by detec- tlves from other points, to weed out these murdering devils, has failed, Ill a measure. at least. Life and property have contin- ued at their meEcy. Within two years they have robbed the Adams Express Company alone of one hundred and twenty-five thou sand dollars. A robbery of this kind oc- cured also, lately, on the Cincinnati, Ham, ton and Dayton Railroad, where the Amer ican Express Company was robbed of large amount. All these robberies have emanated from the same source A family named Reno, living at Rockford, two miles from Seymour, have been the leaders or instigators of the whole of these daring outrages. They are also the parties who led the raid in Iowa last spring, when so many county safes were robbed.

 ''On the 22d of May last, the Adams Express Company's car was robbed, about eighteen miles from Seymour, on the line of the Jacksonville, Madison and Indian apolis Railroad. This robbery was done by the Renos and their friends, some of whom are now in Canada to avoid capture, and others are under arrest for this out rage. On the 10th instant, the Adams Ex- press was again attempted to be robbed, on the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad, about thirteen miles west of Seymour. The armed guards of the company, how ever, repulsed the robbers, captured one, and wounded some of the others, two of whom have since been captured, and for the remainder large reward has been of fered."

Wednesday last, at the residence of w. V.
Murphy, Bald Hills, between L. A. Jones
and G. r. Hanson, which terminated. in the
death of the latter. Our informant states
that Jones and Henson happened to meet at
Murphy's, about four O'Clock in the after,
noon, when a dispute took place between
them in relation to certain letters which the
latter had written to the mother in law of
Jones' Henson denied that he had written
anything insulting to the lady, and Jones
affirmed that he bad, and made motion as
if to strike Henson with shovel, which he
held in his hand. Henson then picked up a
board and approached Jones, who struck him
on the head several times with the shovel
The blows knocked Henson down, but he
recovered sufficiently to be able to walk about
for short time, but finally became faint and
was obliged to lie down. He fingered until
midnight, when he expired. Coroner Lynch
repaired to the scene of the tragedy on
Thursday afternoon to hold an inquest on
the remains. and had not returned as we 90
to press."

THE ACTION OF THE FIRE COMMISSIONERS
The question of appointing colored men as fire.
men came up in the last meeting but one, Mr..
Gorbutt contending that colored men would
never make fremen, that they lacked courage,
Judgment, &c., another Commissioner concur.
ring In what Mr.. Gorbutt said. The Mayor
combatted this idea and stated that il was only
a repetition Of what had been said of colorad
men In regard TO making soldiers-that they
were towards, would never fight, would never
learn 10 use musket, had no patriotism, or
love OF home or country, &c.-but that facts
had proved that they not only had courage
Judgment, love of home and country, but that
they had shown themselves as good soldiers as
white men, and were Just as reliable. The dis.
eussion was quite warm and animated. but as
no appointments Is We're made at that meeting n
Is q
what course the Board would pursue On that
subject.


On Tuesday last the Mayor sent word to
Mr.. johnson and Mr.. GoOdail that he would
like 10 see them at his office at o'clock d. m.
They came and had an understanding that
they would appoint the men Mr.. Elwood had
employed, he (Mr. E) having been requested
by resolution Of the Board at the preyious
meeting to furnish n list of the same. Toey
all agreed, however, that two OF these men
(colored) who had been tried and convicted of
crime should be dropped from the list and two
other unexcepfionable colored men should be
substituted by Mr.. +. in their places There
was no disagreement between them, and the
Mayor went TO the meeting with most per-
feet assurance that all would be right and tnat
sll OF Mr.. Elwood's employees would be
appointed and confirmed by the Board


After they had resolved to GO into the busi-
ness OF making appointments, the Mayor call
ed on Nr. Ellwood for his lis, which he
promptly handed to him. The mayor then
stated that he would support the men on that
llst. oecaus he wished to hold Mr.. Eiwood re-
sponsible for their good conduct. and as he
was the responsible officer of the department.
he (the Mayor deemed il due TO hlm that he
should have the naming of the men. The
Mayer then named the first on the list OF en-.
CINE No. /, who was elected by three votes TO
two. be then called the second name when
Mr.. Johnson prod uced another list which he
said Mr Elwood had furnished him and which
was dHerent from that furnished the Mayor
1T having none but the names of white men on
It. Mr.. johnson named the man on his list
and he was elected; and so the ballot went on,
every man on his list being elected the
Mayer alone, excepting in n single instance
voting for the person on the list he had The
Mayor s list had the names of those appointed
and employed by Mr.. Ellwood, white and COL
ored- Mr.. Johnson's contained, as we are in.
formed, none but the whites. The presenting
OF the two lists confounded the Mayor, but he
did not know till the next morning that Mr.
Johnscns had no colored men on il. As soon
as he ascertained that fact, hs denounced the
whole thing as trick unworthy any honora.
bic man. From what took place during the
evening he was induced TO believe that O le of
he commissioners and Mr. Ellwood wer, re.
sponsible for IL; but as Mr.. f. dIsclains any
knowledge OF the list produced by Mr. john
son, and as question of veracIty exists be.
ween them, he reserved any expire sion of

the Honorable President and Members of the


Senate of Louisiana:


In the the case of George W. Ragan VS..
R. H. Day, the undersigned cannot agree
with the majority of the committee, and
begs leave to submit the following minority
report


From the evidence adduced, the under
signed is fully convinced that no fair and
impartial election took place at Baton Rouge
on April the seventeenth and eighteenth,
1868. 1t is in evidence that the ballot boxes,
police and others had been controlled by
parties in the interest of the Mayor and
Sheriff Bird, the Mayor q. E. Elam) being
then in office and a candidate for re.elec-
ton. 1t is ALSO proven that more than one
thousand voters were prevented by intimi-
dation from voting. The undersigned can
not agree with the majority in the presump-
tion that the said one thousand voters
would have voted for G.. w. Ragan. The
undersigned, therefore, recommends to this
honorable body that the election be set
aside, and the seat Of r. H. Day be declared
vacant, and that the Governor be instructed
to order new election.


PATRICK O'HARA.


Mr.. Thompson, also from the Committee
on Elections and Returns, presented the
following minority report:


Rooms SENATE COMMITTEE ON ELECTIONS, 1


October l9, 1868,
To the Honorable the President and the Member:


of the Senate of the State of Louisiana;


The undersigned, member of the Senate
Committee on Elections, having examined
with all the care to which, from its import,
ance, it is entitled, the evidence submitted
by George W. Ragan, contesting the seat OF
the Hon. r. H. Day, as well as that present
ed by DR.. Day himself, and differing and
honestly differing, with the majority Of his
colaborers in the work assigned them by
your honorable body, submits the following
minority report:


A careful examination of the immense
mass Of testimony taken in this case p.e-
sents the following:


l. That the list of registered voters in
the parish of East Baton Rouge amounted
il round numbers to-


Colored... 5000


White. OBSERVATION-DISCLOSURES. sl5O0
That the large amount of more than l00C
votes were not polled on the seventeenth
and eighteenth days of April, and yet that
Or. Day received a majority of more than
700 votes over his competitor for Senatorial
honOrs.


The whole current of testimony shows
that this contest was conducted with vigor
unusual in such cases.


Gentlemen of the very highest respecta-
bility in Louisiana have testified in behalf
OF the sitting member, and the certain and
couscntaneous opinion of the whole is that
the election was conducted as fairly as any
election at which they were ever present,
and they witnessed many in the city OF
Baton Ronge and East Baton Rouge. That
if fraud of any description was practiced it
wholly escaped their attention; and they
further state that they were at all times in a
position to have seen it had such been the
case.


In addition to the testimony OF civilians
we have the testimony of the distinguished
commander of the post of Baton Rouge and
his officers, completely negativing the
charge of intimidation with which it is
charged the election is tainted. The fiat
tering vote received by the contestant, a
stranger, is an evidence of the
high esteem in which he was held by the
party of his district, but both
the witnesses for the contestant and Dr. Day
assure us that many of the leading colored
men of Baton Rouge were the warm friends
and active supporters of the doctor; re-
garded by them as conservative in his no.
tions, known to them intimately, and en-
Toying measure of popularity with the col
ored population of his district, based as the
witnesses declare upon the kindliness of his
his attention to them when sick,
and his habit of bonding them when i'm
prisoned for alleged violations of the
criminal code of Louisiana, And it is to
the above that some of the witnesses at
tribute, as well IS the undersigned, the
very large vote received by him, nay, in
the language of one totally disinterested,
OF high respectabillty and of the
same political faith with contestant, whose
testimony was taken by commission, in the
State of Maine, in his answer to third and
fifth heterogeneous, page ls2, he declares he
voted for the Constitution, and on the same
page, and in answer to tenth interrogatory, he
declares that G. W. Ragan could control a
larger colored vote than DR.. Day. but that
DR.. Day could influence majority OF all
the voters in the parish and the same wit
ness declares that he expected some three
hundred or more to vote for the doctor, and
many OF them afterward declared they had
done so and in confirmation of the deep
hold of DR.. Day upon the affections of the
colored people of the parish of East Baton
Rouge, one witness, (colored), man of
much influence and very intelligent, page
l26, declares tnat he was and is Repubii.
can, voted the Republican ticket, except for
Mr.. Ragan, and through his influence at
least three hundred colored voters, he
thinks, cast their ballots for Dr.. Day; and
yet another, an old resident of the parish,
declares, page l75, that if 'Ragan were to
run to-day against DR.. Day, the. doctor
; The undersigned would further state, and
the testimony justifes the statement, that
the changing or swapping of votes has al
ways been regarded as legitimate mode OF
electioneefing and has never been esteemed
an act OF fraud until very recently; but ad-
mitting it to be fraud, and such fraud as to
the extent practiced would affect the result,
you have from the contestants own witnesses
this statement developed that at least sixty
votes were thus exchanged by the active
supporters of Dr.. Day, leaving the sitting
member at least six hundred and fifty ma
jority. The undersigned cannot agree with
the majority that colored voter1 were de-
to the testimony of General Sykes,
a part of whose command was near the polls
for the preservation of peace and order; as
well, perhaps, to secure to all their rights"

Mr.. Bacon, from the special Joint COM
mittee to inquire into the unauthorized al.
terations to Senate bill No. %, presented the
following report:


New Orleans October 70, 1853
| To the Honorable the Senate of the State of Lou.
IsiaAa:


Your committee appointed to examine
| into and inquire as to how the alterations
which were not agreed to by either House,
were made in the engrossed COPY of the
| Senate bill No. %, which passed into an act,
| respecting imprisonments and fines, and as
| to the person or persons by whom they were
made, beg leave to report, that they have
| examined the Secretary aud the Assistant
Secretary of the Senate, and the Chief En-
| rolling Clerk thereof, and the chairman of
the Judiciary Committee and Chief Clerk
| of the House.


All agree that the bill was engrossed as it
passed the Senate, containing the words re-
specting the powers of recorders and other
magistrates and courts that it '' shall not be
competent for them to remit fines or i'm
| prisonments, and that the words ""be dis.
| cretionary,"" found in lieu thereof being in
terlined in pencil, and the other words
| erased, were not in it when it went to the
House. but the latter were found in it when
/ the Enrolling Clerk of the Senate undertook
| nrst to enroll ii, ami the former words were
| erased. The same is reported to US as to
the word ""nor"" In the eighteenth line.
| The supposed fourth section was also sup
piled in pencil after the bill left the Senate.
The House referred the bill to its Judiciary
Committee, and that committee reported
| it back with the Endorsement, ""Favorably.n
| in, pencil, and as thus reported il passed.
The Clerk of the House has formally and
officially reported to US by Endorsement on
the bill, by the direction of the House, ""that
| the House concurred without amendments =""
and that the words mot be competent
were not stricken out by the House, nor the
words ''nor to- in the eighteenth line, and
that the additional section was not added
| by the House.


The Hon. Peter Harper, chairman of the
Judiciary Committee, declares to the best of
| his recollection the Judiciary Committee of
the House reported the bill back favorably,
| and without amendments.
Your committee have had an opportunity
of observing very reprehensible practice,
which may have been practiced heretofore
in both Houses, but which should be
abandoned-thst of making scratches and
alterations of bills sent by one House to
another, when it desired to amend them.


A bill which originated in and passed the
Senate to be entitled an act relative to at
tachment, was returned to the Senate by the
Clerk of the House as having been concur
red in witt out amendment, but was found
to have an important clause stricken out
with pencil, and this it was afterWar found
the House intended to have stricken ont
but which should have been done by
separate amendment to that effect, to have
been engrossed on another piece of paper,
to be sent back to the Senate with their bill
unmutilated.


In the case of the bill respecting which
your committee has been directed to in
quire, it seems to be uudoubted, for the |
HouEe has formally so decided that the bill |
was passed by that body as it passed the
Senate, unaltered, and has now been cor
5rectly enrolled and approved by the Gov
ernor and become law; but we have much
doubt on our minds whether there was not
some inchoate attempt In the Judiciary
Committee of the House to have 1t Changed,
but this never took shape by the action OF |
the House itself, which adopted the bill as |
it went from the Senate.

do not believe Senator on this floor, ex-
cept the members of the committee has
read this report In my opinion it is unjust

| liberation upon this contest, but If compelled

finding of a majority of the committee. L
| say to the friends of the sitting member,
that in forcing this question they have COM

back to the people.

The trial of Martha Starkey, negress, in
dicted for the murder Of Remy Guillemart
came to close on Saturday, the Court
rendering verdict Of ''not guilty."" This
verdict was the only one which the law
and the evidence would warrant, though
there are very few, if any, who think the
woman innocent. All her confessions
were made, it seems, after she was threat
ened with punishment, and were ruled out
of evidence. There were other circum.
stances which pointed strongly to her as
the guilty party, but the chain was not
strong enough to warrant conviction.
Lynch law is seriously threatened."

Evans, and from the Report shown in full
of D. W. c. Thompson, late Major of the
California Cavalry Battalion, we make the
following extracts describing a few of the
operations of the brave men of the ""Califor.
MIA Battalion"" and California Hundred, f""
during the closing scenes of the war:
""On the twenty seventh of February
| (1S65) the battalion was again in the saddle
| for one of the hardest marches made during
the war-from Winchester to Petersburg
about three hundred miles, through rain and
mud. fighting the enemy all the way and
destroying his railroads, canals and other
property The command consisted of the
First Division of Cavalry, under General
Devin, to which the battalion belonged ::
Third Division, under General Custer, with
a small force of artillery, pontoons, etc.
all under General Sheridan. On this march
the battalion moved from Winchester up the
valley, through Woodstock and Harrisburg.
to Stanton and Waynesboro. At the latter
place battle was fought, resulting in the
capture of the remnant of Early's army and
large amount of rebel supplies. The
march was continued to Charlottesville.
where the railroad and enemy's stores were
destroyed then to the James River, DESTROY.
ing the canals and the bridges over that river
down to Goochland then to the north of
Richmond, across the South and North Anna
Rivers, down to the White House Landing.
The battalion assisted in charging and taking
the railroad bridge across the South Anna,
with its defences and cannon. From the
White House the march was continued across
the peninsula and over the James River in
front of Petersburg, where the battalion
went into camp on the twenty sixth of March,
after one month of constant marching, fight.
ing and skirmishing, destroying railroads,
canals and the enemy's property beyond any
immediate repair, and overcoming impedi-
ments of nature and the enemy seldom offered
against the advance of troops.


The battalion marched from in front of
Petersburg on the the twenty-ninth of March,
and took part in the brilliant operations that
resulted in the surrender of General Lees
army at Appomattox Court House on the
ninth of April, eighteen hundred and sixty.
fSe. 1t formed part of General Gibbs
brigade, that gallantly attacked the enemy
at Dinwiddle Court House and forced him
to retire.


''On the first day of April the battalion
was in the hottest of the fight at Five Forks,
and was among the first troops inside of the
enemy's works. 1t was in Devin's Division,
referred to by President Lincoln in the fol
lowing dispatch The Five Forks, strongly
Division of Cavalry


''In this engagement, First Lieutenant
Lewis Munger, while leading his company,
was killed. This promising young officer
enlisted in California, and had been promoted
to First Lieutenant for faithful services and
distinguished bravery. lie was the fourth
officer of the battalion killed in battle
Eigenbrodt. Meader-Smith and Munger, are
names that will always be cherished by their
comrades in arms, and should be honored by
California, the State they loved so well.


ION the second of April the battalion
marched toward the South Side railroad,
and during the day they heard of the fall of
Petersburg. On the third of April it was in
an engagement on the South Side railroad


- The news of the fall of Richmond reach
ed the battalion on the fourth of April, while
following up Lees army. During the day
it was in an engagement at DEVILS Ford
On the fifth of April it assisted in cutting
the Danville railroad and capturing three
hundred wagons of General Lees trains.


g 1t took part in the battle of Sailors
Creek, on the sixth of April that resulted in
the capture of General Ewell and about ten
thousand men of General Lees army,
together with their artillery trains and sup
plies.


On the seventh of April it continued in
pursuit of Lees army, marching on their
left flank and skirmishing oil the way.


''On the eight of April, it marched rap
idly to Appomatox Station, on the Lynch.
burg railroad, and assisted in capturing five
trains of cars loaded with rebel supplies,
and during the night twenty pieces of
artillery.


''On the morning of the memorable ninth
of April, Sheridan's cavalry having formed
line of battle across Lees line of retreat, the
battalion was dismounted and deployed as
skirmishes Immediately in front of the enc.
my. When the army of Northern Virginia
attempted to advance that morning it found
every foot of ground stubbornly contested
For some time this spirited engagement was
kept up, the rebels expecting to break thro'
the cavalry and escape. While this was
going on, the Fifth. Twenty fourth, and part
of the Twenty fifth Corps, came up and
formed in rear of the Cavalry, which grad
ually moved to the right flank to allow them
to come into action When their long line
of battle advanced under General Ord, the
veterans of the best rebel army, who had
fought tor four years vainly but too we'll,
saw that their doom was sealed. They stop
ped firing and slowly fell back around Ap-
pomatox Court House, the Union troops fol
lowing and hemming them in on all sides
Soon white flag, in token of surrender.
was presented to Sheridan's cavalry-an
honor they well merited-and hostilities
ceased. Early in the afternoon the battalion
had the pleasure Of witnessing the meeting
of the General in Chief Of the Armies Of the
United States and the General in Chief Of
the Rebel Armies, and soon after the formal
surrender of the Army of Northern Virgin

Vigorous Speech of Old


Thad Stevens.",,"RencOntre Between Jack Hamilton and u
Congressman.


fashionable restaurant in this city was this even
ing the scene of lively exhibition OF pugilism In
high life. 1t appears that Jack Hamilton OF Texas,
and Senator were engaged In conversation over
dinner. in which the usual accessories were not
the least important feature. The conversation,
which had become quite animated was sud-
denly arrested by q member Of Congress-
Mr.. Randall, OF Pennsylvania, stepping up and ask
ing one Of the parties whether his name was Hamil
ton. The reply being in the affirmative, the member
Of Congress is alleged to have responded somewhat
emphatically calling Hamilton a id scoundre.
This observation arOusing Jacks bellcose propen-
sties Jack in turn responded by addressing
vehement whack with the head of his
cane to Randall's Congressional pate. Jack,
showing further indications Of an incorrigible
temper, was caught by two individuals near
by and firmly secured. Hereupon Randall's
knuckles lodged themselves with considerable
emphasis upon Hamilton's phiz, draping one
peeper in mourning. Hamilton roared out to the
Senator interrogatng him whether he would stand
by and see him treated in that manner. This ap-
peal unlOosed the rlgors Of Senatorial dignity, and
simultaneously cane was seen to flourish high in
the air. At this Indication of reinforcements the
prisoner Hamilton was released. Now came the
tug Of battle Hamilton, it is stated, darted at
Randall furiousy, and in moment had him foored.
At this stage OF the conflict Randal's friends gath
cred around and separated the contestants. The
latter was conducted home In a defaced condition,
while the former, who came in for his share Of pun
shment was left behind master Of the situation. It
Is said the AFFAIR was quite animated for time,
though conducted without the usual ceremonies at
tending such incidents.


A. r. Stewart and General Grant.


rumor Is now in circulation that A. 7. Stewart
Of New York, in the several interviews had with
General Grant within the past day or two advised
the latter not to permit his name to go before the
Chicago Convention as a candidate for the Presi-
dency and that the General had agreed to follow the
advice given. This announcement has started
fresh now Of gossip about the COM
ing nominations, and has set the political
schemers to speculating anew upon the probable
results Of existing complications. Those who are
in o position to be well informed Of the move
ments OF Grant unhesitatingy scout the idea that he
will at this late day offer any hindrance to his name
being used as q candidate for nomination on the
Presidential ticket. careful investigation Of all
the rumors in relation to the voluntary withdrawal
Of Grant from the Presidential contest confirms the
views taken by the well informed indi-
viduals before mentioned. and the statements that
Grant and Stewart have agreed that the former





Convention, or that II the President is acquitted
Grant has said he would decline the nomination II
rendered. or that certain Grant clubs had informed
the General that the President should be convicted
they would cease to give him their support are en-
phattcally denied by those who best know
the Generals views and intentions. Whatever
might have been the course that Grant
thought proper to be adopted when the
question Of running him for the Presidency
was first agtaed 1t is said that he feels 1t to be his
duty to his political friends not to interfere with
their present plans. He will continue to follow up
his silent policy and act with promptness In making
known his intentions when the proper moment
arrives for him to speak out. There need be no
doubt that General Grant will say nothing to prevent
his nomination. and there is less reason to doubt
that he will accept the nomination II rendered to
him.


Revenue Troubles I'm the South.


The revenue agent for the Third Alabama district
calls the attention Of the department to the fact that
there must he some cooperation with the revenue
officers in Tennessee, adjoining the Alabama line,

ers are taking advantage OF the State line to evade
the law. The inspector was satisfied that empty
branded barrels in Tennessee are bought up, relled
and brought to the Alabama market He asks the

taking prompt measures to have the infractions OF
law dealt with and towards the suppressing Of fur
ther violations.

STATE OF LOUISIANA,
New Orleans, Jan. IL, 1865.",,"STATE OF LOUISIANA,


New Orleans, Jan. III, 1865.
Hon. ii. Peralta State Auditor:


SiT-Your esteemed favor of the 9th inst. was
received, and take the first opportunity present
ed 10 me during the pressure OF my official duties
TO place you in possession Of my views in relation
10 the subject matter OF your communication.
II is unnecessary to inquire into the power and
authority of a convention assembled under and by
virtue of the sovereign will Of the people of q
State duly expressed. tthe power of such con.
vention be what IL may, we are not, at this time,
called upon TO subject il to investigation.


The convention now in sossion, which adopted
the ordinance levying tax of one mill on the
dollar upon the real and mOveable property in the
State of Louisiana, derives its existence from
tain reconstruction acts OF Congress- passed during
the year 1867, and am satisfied that such CON.
ventiOn has acquired no greater right and pos
sesses no greater authority than are bestowed
upon it by the acts of Congress which called it
into being.


The eighth section Of the supplemental recon.
structon act, passed March 23d, 1867, authorizes
the convention for each State to prescribe the
fees, salary and compensation to be paid to all
delegates and other officers and agents authorized
by that act, or necessary to carry its purposes
into effect. II also provides for the collection of
such taxes as may be necessary to pay the ex.
penses above mentioned. The conshtutionality
of the reconstruction acts of Congress is, for
present purposes, taken for granted, and it is only
necessary to ascertain and determine the extent
of the power and authority Of the convention as
conferred by those statutes. Had Congress de-
clared that the fees salary and compensation pro-
vded for should constitute debt or liability on
the part Of the State of Louisiana, and provided
the levying of a tax as one of the means by which
the State should acquire funds wherewith to dis
charge that debt or liability, then there would be
a valid claim agaiDstthe State, for which it would
be your duty to issue warrant to the proper
person, even before the collected assessments
reached the treasury.


Such however, is not the provision of section
eight of the reconstruction act above referred to.
The State Of Louisiana, by the provision of that
section, is neither expressly nor by Implication
subjected to liability for any part of the CON-
pensatiOn, fees or salaries required TO be paid
nor is che made q debtor for any part thereof


Congress simply authorized the convention 20
establish the amount OF its expenses and to levy
upon and collect from the property Of the people
OF the State such tax as may be required to paw
those expenses. The law does not require that
the taxes thus collected should be deposited in the
State treasury. There is therefore no liability on
the part OF the State to pay any SUN Whatever,
until the collected taxes shall have reached the
hands OF the treasurer, and then only to the
amount deposited.


Under such circumstances concur with you in
opinion tDat you have no right to grant warrants
covering the expenses OF the present convention,
until there shall be funds in the treasury arising
from The collection OF the tax levied to meet such
expenses. Very respectfully.


Your obedent servant,


D. L. LYNCH,


Attorney 3ensral."

Judge Chase and Universal Sullrnge-speech
of the Chief Justice in Charleston, y. G..
From the Charleston Courier, June III
In compliance with numerous requests from
abroad we reproduce the following speech, deliv-
cred in Zion church in this city, on the 18th day of
May, 1865, by Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase and
which was published in this journal the following
day, after being carefully revised in proof under his
immediate supervision. It gives full expression to
his views OF universal suffrage and kindred topics
and will be read, we think, with great interest,"" in
view OF the use now being made Of his in con-
nection with the democratic nomination to the Pres
dency:-


My FRIENDs-I shall comply with the invitation Of

words. 1t Is true that have always been the friend
OF freedom; have always desired to see every man.


OF whatever complexion, protected in the enjoyment
or all his natural rights and to clothed
with every legitimate means for the protection Of
those rights. No man, probably in this country de-
would have made greater sacrifices to avert 1t.
did not wish to see even the great good OF eman-
that it would come some time; / believed that by
wise and just administration Of the federal govern
ment it might be hastened; but never desired to
such terrible struggle as that through which we have
passed. never desired to those OF blood and
those vast CULTS in which the OF the country
have been sunk. even for that highest good which,
as we all hoped, could have been obtained by other
and gentler means. But In the providence OF God
war came; and as a means Of carrying that war
through to successful issue felt it was the duty
OF the general government to respect its natural
allies; and knew that the whole colored population
OF the South was loyal Great cheerng.) said and
felt that II We would succeed in this struggle we
must strike the fetters from the bondman. Such
was my counsel In the Cabinet; and when that hon.

the world; when that honored man made up his
mind to say that all men in this land shall be frec

the black man ?"" never doubted the proper answer


II we make them freemen, and the defence OF their
freedom Is the defence OF this nation, whose duty is
1t to bear arms, II not theirsY Whose duty is 1t to
take part in this struggle now for freedom well
as for Union II not their dutyp And how can we
expect to succeed II do not avail ourselves OF that
natural strength which In this struggle IL created for
US us by the circumstances under which 1t Is wagedp
When the government, therefore, made up its mind
to call the black man to the field felt that It had

blunders for the year Of grace 1868 Is the nomi-
nation Of Charles A. Shaw, Of Biddef'rd, by the
Democrats Of the first District as candidate
for Congress. At the Convention yesterday
William p. Haines, Of Biddeford. was first nom
mated by reclamation; not desiring to swell tho
already formidable number of defeated Demo-
cratic candidates whom the people OF Maine
have been consigning to oblivion for twelve years
past, he was discreet enough to decline. Then
received the nomination.


Mr.. Lynch was sure ofrc-election under any
circumstances, but the madness Of his oppo-
nents has now insured him as large majority
as be received in 1866. He Is man whose po-
sition In public life is due to solid worth, to
stirling integrity and TO value public services.
To exchange him for an individual who has
sought notoriety by system Of self-adulation
that finds no parallel in the country, unless 1t
be In the conduct of gentleman who is now in
vestigating in practical way tho workings Of
the various debtors prisons in Great Britian,
would be piece Of folly which no sane man
can anticipate.


The Republicans Of Connecticut once tried the
experiment Of nominating p. T. Barnum for
Congress. The result was that Democrat rep
resented them in Congress instead Of a mounte-
bank, and they richly deserved that punishment.
Il Ia doing Mr.. Shaw no injustice to say that he
Is sort Of provincial Barnum. That he Is n
successful business man Is some credit to him,
II the strange arts-we do not mean dishonora-
bic, but simply empirical arts-by which he has
become 10, are not too curiously investigated.
The manner in which he obtained h nomina-
ton was in strict accord with his methods Of
proceeding in business. Having made up his
mind that the life that appeared with 30 many
embellishments In the chronological Journal
would be well rounded by term at Washing
ton, he Immediately invested in newspaper,
and has been blowing his own trumpet with
persistent but futile industry ever since. When
the rcturnes show majority Of from three to
four thousand for Lynch on the evening Of the
14th Of September he will probably dispose Of
his interest in the Democrat at once and de-
vote himself to business ever after.-Portiand

Lee on School Disclpiine,,"' absorbed in his duties as President of the Washington College, and seems to have forgotten, or is willing to sink in oblivion, all remembrances of the years during which he stood among the fore most figures of the world, upon whom all eyes were fixed, and whose every action was fraught with momentous interest. Content to accept the logic of events, which finally decided against his cause, he has laid aside the sword and betaken himself, accomplishing, to a field of more peaceful combats- that of education against ignorance. He seeks to establish by his later efforts, not Confederacy, but the Empire of the Mind.

 The following report on School Dis cipline was presented by Gen. Lee at the State Teachers Convention, held in Lynchburg, Va, last July. It possesses general interest, both on ac- count of the celebrity ofits author, and 1 it's sintrinsic value as an able and instruc- tive paper:

 The Committee appointed by the Educational Association of Virginia, on ''School Discipline"" begs leave to report that, in their opinion. it is inn 1 practicable to establish fixed rules for the Government of School. Public sentiment is so divided on the subject and the methods of family trainings are so various, that no uniform system can be well adapted to meet the gen eral requirement.

 If the subject of Education could ever be of more importance at one period of our history than at another, that period is the present; and that it may be advanced to the highest state of proficiency, it is important that eener- al cooperation should be enlisted in its support.

 It is therefore considered moro advantageous 10 recommend for atten- tion some general principles, and leave their application to the judgement and | bt'Ni NdtipH VI tNtNbNt

 The selection of proper persons for ! the office of teacher is matter of the l first importance: and as its duties re- quire long and comprehensive prepar- ation, it should be regarded as among the most honorable and important pro- 1 fessions, and be committed those whom 1 beneficial influence and instruction ! shall embrace morals and religion, as ' well as the intellect. The teacher should be the example of the pupil. 7 He should aim at the highest attaina- hlc proficiency, and not at q pleasing medi ocrity. Unless he can teach those committed to his care to think and to | work, and can impart to them vigor i with learning, there can be no real ad- . vance. He must study the character and disposition of his pupils, and adapt l his course of discipline to their pecu- 1 iarities. Above all. he must be uni i form, consistent, firm, kind in his con- duet, teach more by acts than words, ! and show the children under his charge | that he has their true interest at heart. He should look upon them not only as 1 the parents of the new generation, but | also as heirs of immortality, and while preparing them for usefulness in this l life. instill into their impossible minds principles of piety and religion: for if | il be true. as taught by history, that greatness depends upou virture, it is 1 equally true that religion is the fount- ain and support of virtue.

 i Should the daily business of the school be conducted on such principes, and the pupils be trained ill the habits of obedience, reverence, and truthful ness. and be convinced that they are noble and lovely in thems elves, and ! their practice manly and honorable, the main object of Education will have been attained.

 In addition to these moral influences, a teacher should be clothed with all the authority of a parent in the discharge of his duties, and be sustained by him so long as he may entrust his child to his care. That he may be kept constan- i tlv informed of the conduct ofhis child. weekly, quarterly and yearly reports of his progress shonld be sent him by ! the teacher, in which should be sent ! his absences, late attendance, and misbehavior. Certificates of advance ment should likewise be given to those who excel in study and conduct. The system of punishment ought to be as simple and mild as they can be made effective; and when coercion has to be resorted to, it should be generally lett to the parent Should admonitlon, restriction of recreation, etc., fail to produce the desired effect, and the pu- pil obstinately resist the patient expos tulation of the teacher, there will then be no other resource than to return him to his parents as one unworthy a place in the school

 I In connection with this subject, and as an additional incentive for the faith ful and conscientious discharge of parental duty, the committee refer to a statement which the present Lord 1 Shaftsburry is said to have made at n recent public meeting in London, that he had ascertained by personal obser- vation, that of adult male criminals of that city, nearly all had begun course ! of crime between the age of eight and sixteen ; and that fla young man should pursue virtuous life till he was twen- ty years old, there were forty-nine chances, in favor, and onl:- one against his continuing an honest life thereafter."

News from the Interior.


KINGSTON, JAM. July 30, 1868.


BY the arrival Of the Alma to-day from Cape Haytl,
in four days. learn that the place is surrounded by
the revolutionists, and that communication with the
interior has been cut OF, that neither coffee nor
logwood can find Its way to the coast for shipment
As q result OF this vessels cannot md cargoes Ad-
vices have already gone to the United States to coun-
termand the sailing Of vessels for Haytien ports with
provisions, as no return cargo can be furnished.
Three vessels rom the States laden have arrived in
Kingston from Hayti, having been unable to there
unload their cargoes.


The news from Port au Prince is to the 25th,
brought by her Britannia Majesty's steamer Mullet
which arrived at Port Royal on the evening of the
2stn. Early on the morning Of July % General
Normil quilted his portion Of the insurgents
lines around Port au Prince, evacuating the
Lighthouse aud Carrefours, and hurriedly pro.
ceeded to Petit Goave arriving there the same
evening. The place was and had been for some time
in possession Of the reactionts or interior parisans
OF Salnave These Normil attacked at once and after
long and desperately contested engagement he re-
mained master Of the field and OF the town. The
loss was heavy on both sides. In his abandonment
Of Carref0urs Normil had to leave behind three
pieces Of artillery for want of transportation. The
cannon were spiked and otherwise rendered unsep-
viceable. The same day Salnave's forces occupied
CarrefOurs and of course found the spiked guns.
highly selfaudatory and bOmbastic proclamation
was thereupon published by his sable Exceency, in
forming the people Of Hayti In particular and man.

was done in and about the village Of La Coupe,

tured her. This is hard blow to Sanave's fortunes
and materially lessons his chances OF success. The
insurgents are likely now to endeavor to shut up
Port aa Prince ON the sea side from the outer world
as they have done on the land side.


The corvette Sylvan is small steamer which was
purchased during the Presidency OF GefYrard turned
into war vessel and called the Twenty second De-
cember. Soon after the assumption Of power by
salnave her name was changed to Sylvan,
had lately been kept busily engaged IN
running between Port au Prince ana Cape

to Port au Prince 10 garrison The Cape and brought
the Cape troops to garrison the capital in order to
prevent local influences upon the men. Sanave
now has no vessels Of war at bis disposal his navy

New York for nOn-payment OF repairs and equip
menf. The Liberte was captured, like the Sylvan,
by the insurgents.
The United States steamer De Soto arrived at Port
III Prince the 22d, to leave for Colon on the 25th
Dr. 26th. Sanave visited her the morning Of the
.4th and was received with great honors. His fast
rend, MIR. Gideon Holliser American Minister resi-
lent, was present on the occasion.

Judcious one, such as will preclude the personal
jeaOuses that would have resulted had either of the
other three generals been selected. Despite this
wise action towards concentration OF their efforts
the insurgents are not prospcring as they had rea
sons to expect few weeks ago. Great discomfort
exists among the men OF the line because Of the
au Prince and many are daily deserting. on the
other hand the cause of Sanave is looming up. The

gain to the Presidents cause.

been very much discussed AT Cape Haytlen, on his

From Cape Hayten Mr.. HOLSTER went 10 Mole St

General Lynch solemnly AYERS that his party will
never submit TO any dospoiiation made by Sanave,
no matter IN iaVor OF what nation 1t may have been
executed.

The President sent to the Senate, yesterday


Lengthy message, giving his reasons for tn,


removsl of Stanton, which were read and or
dered Finted. The document is in the Presi
dents bwn hand writing. A large portion o.


the massage is devoted to argument showing
the pofer of the President to remove the Sec
retary Il War. He quotes section from tn


Act of Aug. 9TH, 1889, creating the Depart


ment q War, to show that Congress recog
nized he power of the President to remov
the Secretary without the concurrence o
any branch of the Government lie cites tn
Tenureof Office Act; declaring that stanton


was no appointed by him, and therefore doe


not cone within the scope of its provisions
He says that Stanton only remained In ono
, by Johson's suffrance, and the law is not In


tended o protect such an incumbent, by TAX
ing from the President the power to remov
him. lie says however, tnat ne was aNar
there we're doubts as to the proper construc
ton of the law, and he therefore deemed
feasible that those doubts should be settled a


the earliest possible moment, and the construC
ton ofthe Act fixed by the Supreme Court


His oruhr suspending Stanton in August, las


was intended to place the case In such pos
ton, 81 would make the resort to judicia
decision both necessary and proper. His ur
derstanling and wishes, however, under tina


order were frustrated, and the late order fc
J Stanton's removal was further step towarC
! the accomplishment of that purpose. he II
, peats TINT his own conviction as to the tru
: construction Of the law and its uncohstitI
tionaliy, were we'll settled and sustained b


every member of the Cabinet, including Star
ton himself. In respect to the designation {
: an officer to act as Secretary of War, ad inte
: i'm, he nys he exercised that power accordin
to the PROVISIONS of the first section of tt
act of February 18th, 1795. He argues Il

, as follows:
