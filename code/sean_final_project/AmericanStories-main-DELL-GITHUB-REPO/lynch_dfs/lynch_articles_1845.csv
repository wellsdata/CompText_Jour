sed to its fair settlement. 1t is not honorable while
the title to the territory is undetermined between
the respective governments, to urge measures to
populate 1t with Aleghanian citizens, in order to
give facilities for its occupation at future period
Such recommendations do not indicate convic-
tion OF the validity OF the claim insisted on. Alleg-
hania, ss well as Great Britain, has an interest in
the establishment OF a settled government in that
part of The world-in marking out the limits of le
gal possessi ion-and In rearing population which,
however they may differ respecting the system Of
government which they may prefer, shall look to
the future, as bringing the fruits of peaceful,
generous, and civilized intercourse""


From Liverpool Mail, March asl


The sentiments expressed in tine inaugural ad-
dress OF the Alleghanan President, Mr.. Polk, are
merely an echo of those acted upon by his prede.
cessor, Mr.. Tyler. Texas, by this genteman's ac.
count formerly belonged to the United States, but
when he does not condescend to explain. Allegha
rights so extensive that the safer way is to date the
forraer from the call of Abraham and admit the
latter from Cape Horn to the North Pole. He takes
Tor granted that no foreign power whatever has any
right To- object to the annexation OF Texas to the
tederallve Union, at the head Of which he has the
honor TO be placed. With respect to the Oregon
territory, he dsposes of it in a paragraph He says
that ~ belongs toAlleghanla; is soccupiedbyhe wives
and children Of citizens; and, consequenty,it must
and shall be governed by republican Institutions
The claims OF Eng land are not so much as alluded
to He has apparently reconciled himself to the
complacency OF rejecting all advice on the subject,
and refuses to hear any evidence. As they say in
the law courts, Mr.. Justice Polk has stopped the
case and discharged the jury.


How the British government will treat these i'm.
portant proceedings remains to be explained
While Texas remained independent, her position
was advantageous TO Great Britain; but in the
hands Of the Alleghanians she will increase the
monopoly OF the cotton districts adversely TO the
interests OF this country. II we lose Texas, then,
what are we to gain In return.


This is by TAR the most important question as con-
Germs England The superb island of Cuba in our
possession would be some equivalent, and as Spain
wants money, we nave no doubt that the purchase
OF that property could be made on available and
agreeable terms Cuba, annexed to England, is
quite expedient as that of Texas to Alleghania;
and IT this were accomplished, the aggressive and
aggrandising power of the republic would, In some
measure, be checked The Union is already too
extensive. National power is like steam, the more
formidable the more II is condensed. Every square
mile added to Aleghania is an additional weak
ness-a progressive advancement towards dissolu
ton But that Is the business of the citizens
Cuba would be of more value to England than
Texas multiplied by all the slaves hereafter to be
employed In cultlvating it.


SLAVE TRADE-ANNBxATIoN OF TRxAs-PoLK's
INAUGURAL.The conduct of the AIleghanian Lee
glslatlve bodies is q marvel and mystery to the
politicians OF Europe. 1t passes comprehension,





OF organizat ton. Every one saw, in the result of
the last contest for the Presidency, that Texas
would be annexed; but that the Wing Senate
should be consentlng party has produced aston
lshment, and rendered the news which came to
hand this week from the western world, not only
novel but startling. The Senate is regarded, on
this side the water, as very conservative body
a drag upon the more headstrong resolves of the
other House; and the dignity of its bearing, COM
mands, wih1he general wisdom OF its decisions, the
respect even Of those who not prone to cuogise
republican institutions. Hence the surprise which
has been created But the game of politics is evil
IDENTITY the all the world overa series OF skill
ful moves and countermoves, and the most skilful
player is he who puzzles, checkmates, ,and triumphs
over his fellows


With the intelligence of the Annexation Bill ha-
wing passed Congress, has come to hand the inau.
gural address of President Polk, a document upon
which much criticism, not over-friendy, has been
spent, The verbose state documents of AlIeghania

slderaton will show the reason. The British Pre-

will certainly rember that he forgot 10 hand over
to Captain Rynders' mother several hundred dol

At NatcheZ, Capt. Rynders figured extensively
and always as leader of every circle in which he
CHANGED to be, whether In bar room or ball room

man, stranger to him, was, for some cause, be

Rynders promptly and Enthusiastically resolve,
that they should do no such thing. He imme

 HARRIsoN's SPECIFIC OINTMENT

 The great celebrity of this unrivalled composition especially in the Northern States--leaves the pro- prieor but little need to say anything in it's favor for il has been generally conceded to it. that it is, beyond all comparison, the best remedy for external complaints that has ever been discovered. Indeed the speed and certainty of it's operations have the ap- pearance of miracles: as ulcers, wounds. corns. fe- yer sores, chilbaios, white swengs, piles, piles, spider and snake bites, &c immediately yield to its superhuman influence. Thus, if properly applied, il will remove inveterate corn, or break and heal a bile m five days, will alay and perfectly cure an ui | Ger in two weeks; and the most desperate cases o white swelling that cnn be imagined have been de. sroyed by 1t in less than months. In tine bites of poisonous reptiles it's efficacy truly surprising and even in the bite of rabid dog; for if applied in time, its powers of attraction wonderful ba; they will at arrest the poison. and thus prevent it from pervading the system It is likewise greatly superior to any medicine heretofore discovered for the chaled backs and limbs of horses--for letters, ring worms, chapped lips-and, in short, for every external bodily evil that may fall 10 the lot of man or beast. t,Stas - I'd. .su

War with Mexico.


The public mind which he'd been quietly settling
down into the conviction that all the threatening
clouds had dispersed, and that annexation was short
y TO be settled forever, without any difficult
~ is again disturbed by rumors and indications oil
the approach of less agreeable state of affairs be-
tween this country and Mexico The heavens begin
again to gather backness, and distant mutterngs of
thunder appear to foretell the coming storm.


Amongst the indications OF threatening charac-
ter which engage public attention. certain move
ments in the War Department, which, connected
with the alleged presence Of Mexican force on
the Nueces, are certainly worthy of note. General
Scott, who had been presiding at the Board of Ex-
animation at West Point lett this city, it is said,
very suddenly on the night of Tuesday last in con-
sequence OF message received from Washington.
Other rumors are afloat in various quarters to the
effect that hostile movement is contemplated by
the government for the purpose OF driving the Mex
leans the Rio del Norte. More significant, how
ever, than all these givings out is the tone of the
government organ itself 1t no longer effects to treat
with contempt the opinion that Mexico may offer
forcble resistance to annexation but takes up and
treats with great seriousness the statements which
have frequently appeared relative to the issuing Of
letters of marque by Mexico, and declares in the
most emphatic terms, that if that power venture on
such step, the government of the United States
would at once tissue orders to the Commanders of
our Squadrons-if they have not already been issr-
cd-to treat pirates any foreign vessel that is
pleased to sail with foreign crews under those letters
of marquee


1t is thus apparent that there is not so little dam
ger of important crisis in our relations with Mex
leo, many have recently been led to imagine.
BY treating those vessels sailing under Mexican let
ters of marque pirates, the interference Of En-
gland and France would be efiectually stopped and
war between the United States and Mexico be pre-
cipitated, which would inevitably result in the COM
plete subjugaton of the latter Such war would
be one of the most popular movements ever made in
this country. Thousands and tens of thousands
would rush into it at once, and take possession of
the gold and silver mines, whilst our conquer
ing eagles would soon float on to the towns of
Mexico, and the miserable mlsgoverned people Of
that country be blessed with civilization and IL
berty


The HEART OF TIE NEW PHlLosopHY-THE
"" TRiBuNE'' AND GENERAL JAcksoN.-We have
seldom such an exhibition Of unanimty of
v,
in the expression of sentiment and opinion called
forth by the death of General Jackson The whig
papers, II is true, do not say great deal about the
departed hero and statesman; but what they do say
is respectful, and in good taste. One remarkable
exception, however, TO this general exhibition of
good feeling and good taste, is presented in the
Of the Nev York Tribune


On the morning after the intelligence of the death
of Jackson received in this city, the Tribune
shocked and disgusted every. body, by mean and
paltry attempt to backen the character ofthe mighty
dead. For this outrageous piece of folly and ma
lgnlty the Fourierite organ received universal re-
buke; and, amongst others, the Don Giovanni OF
the New York democracy, Captain Rynders, took
occasion, at meeting of his club to chastise the
philosopher in pretty terms. There are some
people who will not be taught dscretion-even if
you pound them in mortar with pestle, they
will still be fools-and the men of the Fourierte
organ appear to be of this unfortunate category. In
stead of opening their eyes to a full conviction Of
their gross violation of every principle of charity
and sound judgment, in the first instance, they
came yesterday with an elaborate article, full
of the most abusive and vituperative epi-
fhets, applied to General Jackson, and Captain
Rynders, in about equal proportions. As for the
Captain and his friends, they are quite able to de-
fend themselves-they Of age, and can be quite
as eloquent and denunciatory as the Tribune man.
But the abuse of Jackson, cannot suffer to pass
without notice-abuse of whose character and ami
mus the reader may Judge by the following speci-
mems :-""Jobber in human hesh'-'slave trader
-''destructve influence in politics and morals""-
wholesale butchery""-s'his crimes against liberty
and aw''-s'lynch-law"" mail robbery
''forcible exile of unoifending tribes""-""avowed
perfidy TO the Cherokees'-""covert, rapacious
treachery TO Mexlco.' Such is the manner in
which the Tribune honors the memory Of the dead


And yet this is the very Tribune that glores in its
title and character the organ of that philosophy
which is to open the gates OF the new Jerusalem
expe from human society all the evil passions of the
hear-and introduce era of universal peace,
charity and benevolence! This is the Tribune
which is continually prating about its superior re-
spectability and freedom from low and vulgar preu-
dice and ,-borng about its visions Of the
glorious millennium Of universal love and harmony
and whining piteousy every other day about the
scurrilities and ndecencies OF the press And ye
we find this miracle of decency deliberately and II
cold blood violating all the humanities OF civilized
society-raking up, with ponard, the ashe
OF the dead and loading with every epthet Of inamy
the memory of a man, not, it is true, without faults
but endowed with many virtues-a man of lofty
heroic character--one who has rendered great ser
vices to the repubc--and to whom men of all par
ties are offering homage respectful and sincere
Why, even the 7iibpne's friend in Wall street, nur
tured amid all ""thc brutaties of the camp"" an,
with all his lack of taste, judgment, and feeling, ha
not been guilty Of such gross violation of dccenc,
and propriety.

Indeed the speed and certainty of its operations have the ape pearance of miraces as ulcers, wounds. corns, fee sores, chilblans, wbe swellings, piles, piles, spider and snake bites, &c immediately yield to it's superhuman influence Thus, if properly applied, it will remove inyeterate corn, break and heal a bile m five days, will aIlay and perfectly cure ul- cer in two weeks; and the most desperate cases of white swelling that can be imag med have been de- slroyed by in less than two months. In the bites of poisonous reptiles it's efficacy truly surprising, and even in the bite Of rabd dog; for if applied in time, It's powers of attraction wonder ul that they will at the poison. and thus prevent it from pervading the system. It is likewise greatly superior to any medicine heretofore discovered for the chaIed backs and limbs of horses-for letters, ring worms, chapped lips-and, in short, for every external bodily evil that may fall to the lot of man or beast. .t,.

As there ha. been much said against us in your
paper in past times, would it be trespassing on the
interests Of your pape!--now the great neutral,

brief view of what the liberty party believe, and
intend to do, and why the wings, or democrats,
in the late struggle, could not receive their aid nor

cal supremacy.


The press Of the two great parties of the United
States supposed It could serve the interests ntrust

adopted, and objects Of accomplishment never en-

the integrity of the great confederacy BY placing
the abolition. intellect in a state of per-
Petual lmbecllity, and when it sent up a
iurld blaze tor a moment, it was never to
be regarded as the ebultion Of genius which
startles but sort Of mysterious fanaticism
which alarms. springing from the wid-fres of mo-
raj insanity For the salvation of the nation it was
deemed necessary by our enemies to impugn our
the most elevated love Of country to write obitu-
aries OF our decease. and pretend to have witness
ed the last solemnities, in our death and burial
peated, that it at last excited a doubt among the
more thoughtful, whether it was not patriotic at

Tess to have buried what might injure the public,
whether they had or not; to quiet clamor and 81.

To do a man justice, we must allow him to
tell his own story, vindicate his own position, and

thousand lights, rejecting every image of thought

 Those who have used thls Aperent on ship-board have expressed themselves highly delighted with its effects, and experienced decided relief from it Tn every instance which they had occasion for it an Aperien, or felt an inclination to parake of beve- rage refreshing and inyigorating. Adapted for a warm climate, it is deserving the favor of travellers as preventative and dspeler of those Sick Head Aches, Languor of the Body, Loss of Appetite, Aci- dty of the Siomach etc., the forerunners of bilious or febTie attacks, which often impair and pros- ate the healthy sound constitution, and reduce extreme weakness and debility, and often death, when unaccustomed 10 the many sudden changes so usual at the south.

wont to temperance meeting held in his noigh-

to very stirring address-whcn tho appeal,
warmly seconded by tho advice and entrealy of

conscience was reused, and no felt that he must
either fly from this place Of trial, or the forco of

his conviction, no tore himself from the spot; and
coming to grog shop, on his way home, he there
furnished himself with bottle Of whiskoy. But,

The Eiection-Politcal Acknowledgements in


in the City.


Permit me to address you few lines from the
city of Mounds, if for other purpose than to con-
vince you that It's Inhabitants not asleep, but
wide awake Yesterday an election took place for
Delegates TO the Convention, which is to meet next
fall for the revision of our present constitution. We
have out grown the one under which we are now
governed and the abuses to which II gives risc par
ticuary as respects representation Hperatively re-
qure the substitution Of another more IN accordance
with the spirit of the age. There were bur two
tickets in this county, the native and democrat
The former elected five, the latter but one. This
result has been produced by the great apathy of the
democrats, the total indifference of the wings,
(proper) and the bullying conduct of the natives
We have abroad had an insight into their schemes.
A great many have joined them in the belief that
they are not at all connected with their brethren of
the East but they act too much like them, and are
reading too closely in their footsteps to be able to
deceive the people much longer. At the last April
election for city officers, they obtained voice In the
Board of Aldermen, and carried nine out OF twelve
members of the Board OF Delegates. What has
been the result Sessions Of the City Council with
out end-long speeches without meaning, and much
stir, but little done. There can be no doubt in the
mind of any intelligent observer that theirs is the
party all of whose Influences shall be for the rch.
1t may for short time succeed, but 1t is surely des
tined to speedy and certain destruction. My own
opinion is that no change will be made respecting
slavery.


know it has been industriously circulated that
one of the objects which induced the people to vote
for a convention was, that some clause might be In
serted to procure the gradual abolition OF our slavery
system. AT the present moment It Is out of the
question, now that we know that there is in our
midst secret agents with no other avocation than to
entice slaves from their masters, and regular lines
formed between this and Canada TO aid them In their
escape all of our good feeling, if ever has any,
have been changed. There is a feeling of resent
ment pervading every class of the community at the
oficious intermedlIng OF Abolltlonlsts IN matters
that concern ourselves alone, which foretells of
coming storms. If one OF those agents should be
caught depend upon it he would be too charitaby
dealt with to permit him to see lawyer or to de-
pend upon the uncertainties OF the law, but he
would have justice meeted out to him without fear,
favor, partalty from that eccentric old gentleman,
| Judge Lynch.

 The Cincinnati Enquirer, the Loco-Foco or- gan in Southern Ohio, gives the following account of an Editorial recontre in Columbus:

 .dnotler Coon Skinned..-We understood yes- terday from private advces, that offensive arti- cle appeared in the Columbus Ohio State Journal Saturday last against Col Medary, late of the O. hio Statesman, which caused a personal recontre between o. F0liet tha senior editor of the Journal and the Colonel. The two antagonists met in the middle of the wide street and came to blows. Fol- let raised his cane, seeing that Medary was bei'g- erent and called out to him 'sWhat do you mean 7! owhich Medary replied, to whip you, you d--d scoundrel,"" and at the first pass knocked him down. It having been given out by the friends of Foilet that if Medary assaulted him, he would fare badly, the combatants soon had a crowd around them; and none desirous of suffering them to set- tie their own business in their own selected way, as the aforesaid confident friends of Follet. The democrats did not object. for they knew their man, and the result was that Follet received whipping -a bad, c dyeadful schipping.

 This is the fourth time that editors of that misc rable thing. the Whig Organ of Ohio, have been whipped and disgraced for their unprincipled course e,-Allen, by Buchanan, Bot Smith, by Dr. Miller,-Follet by M. Medary,-Teasdale in the spring, and now Follet, by Col s. Medary, and we have no doubt there will be ""a few more of the same sort"" as the razor strop man would say.

 Follet is large. athletic young man. but too in- nerently mean and unprincipled to fight well.

 1.-the next Whig Editor who shall be assaulted in the street by burly Loco-Foco ruffian shall shoot the assailant dead on the spot, the Editor of the Enquirer and his admiring readers will be mor ally guilty of the homicide. Such articles as the above are directly calculated to incite and provoke rufanisn. Let their authors look to their respon- sibility !~- Iri6stae.

 The Lcsp of LiJe1.-The PROVIDENCE JOUR- NA1' says:-

 ""The atrocious decisions which have regulated the law oflibel in New York, have awakened pub

 lie attention to the insecurity of the liberty of the press and the liberty of speech to which they di- rectly tend. Repeated cases have been tried in | which the defendants have offered to prove the truth of all that they published, and have been re- 1 fused the right to do so; and men have been con- | pelled to pay costs and damages for making state. ments which were undenied by the plaintiffs. But | the most remarkable case is given iE the Albany l, Evening Journal, the editor of which paper was compelled to pay some four hundred dollars for not hbeliing a man, for suPpressing an accusation brought against him in letter from correspond ent. This is hardly more than legitimate deduc- tion from the decisions which have been made in other cases, but we think it will aid somewhat in bringing about the reform that is so loudly deman- ded. We ventured to say that in no other State in the Union could such decisions be sustaned in no other State in the Union could men be successfully prosecuted and harrassed for making declarations which they were fully prepared to prove. We are quite certain that such system will not long be suffered in New York. It's abuses and expressions are too glaringly obvious; it amounts in fact to a ted in free country""

 End of e .Miscreant.-The last Pensacola Ga- zette gives an account of the apprehension of a man of the name of Avant, and one of his confed- crates named Powers, near Apilachicola. They were subsequently, taken to Marianna in Jackson county, where they were hanged on Friday, the 2Oth inst, without the form of trial, and notice was at the same time given to four gentlemen of the blackleg order, that if they were found in the place after the lapse of ten hours, they should share the same fate. If any thing can palliate the atroclty of Lynch law, the circumstances connected with one of these wretches would almost justify this mode of punishment. Avant a monster in human | form, and his life, for series of years, had been marked by crimes of the deepest die. He went to Pensacola some years ago. fugitive from justice from the State of Alabama. where he had murder ed Sheriff He had not been long in Florida. be- fore he attempted the assassination of citizen, and being obliged to fly. proceeded to Marianna, where he was concerned in the murder of another l officer. He then fled to the swamps contiguous to that town, where, up to the time of his apprehen sion, and at the head of a band of outlaws, he perpetrated murder and robbery upon all who fell in his way. To such length, says the Gazette, had his audacty been carried, 1t was considered dangerous to travel through that part of the State. The peace and we'll being of the community de- manded that $ lch villain should meet with re- tribution for his outrages-and owing to the inef ciency of our Territorial government. jals have been provided for the security of criminals; he and his accomplice therefore, in order to insure their punishment, were brought to a speedy exc cuiion. Those concerned were actuated by anoth | CT motive; there are still remaining number of men Of the Same desperate character in the swamps about the county, and an example which the slow l process of law could not afford, was necessary to strike them with terror The only sentiment l which we can express on the subject ia. regret | fhakA A1a # haHa"

the immediate annexation of Texas to the United
States was based upon the alleged insdious efforts
of Great Britain to acquire an undue influence in
the counses of that country, to be purchased by ad-
vantageous commercial arrangements, such as psk
mttng Texas cotton to enter her ports free of duty,
while she would lay heavy duty on cotton from
thei United States. And yet il turns out, that,
before the annexation resolutions passed Congress,
and while their fate was yet uncertain, the British
Ministry had determined upon repeal of the exist
ing duty on our cotton, which of course would pre-
vent any injurious discrimination against it by any
treaty it might have made with Texas. The truth
is, Great Britain is compelled to have our cotton,
and her own interests require the abolition of the
duty.-Lynchburg Trginiaa."

JOHN, alias JACK RIeHT. This fellow, after
lurking about our village for several weeks, left
on Tuesday evening, taking with him the untor+
tunate and degraded victim of his seduction


He came from Knoxville, Tennessee, where
he has a young wife now living, and suffering
the unspeakable pangs< of his remorseless and in
human conduct. He spent the summer at the
Grayson Snlphhf Springs. 1t is understood that
he is professional gambler and bi6ekleg.hs3


The poor Vand infatuated young gir, whom
this destroyer has thus made theIdhps OF his mis-
cradle bribes, and arti6ces and fahless promises,
is Margaret E. Curry, the daughter of Thos. Ou-
ry, of this village, and about Is or l6 years of
age We have understood they are making their,
way towards; Lynchburg or Richmond, and will
probably change their course and pass through
Franklin county and the State OF, North Carolina
to the South. They represent they were married
in this place. statement which is utterly false.
They. are travelling a two horse barouche,
with a cover to it, driven by likely amulato
man.


Thus, whilst this, unpripcipled, unfeeling and
depraved wretch is laceratng the heart of an
innocent and acon6ding wife, and 5'robing her
home which he had pledged himself on the mar
rage altar to render yirtuous and happy, i1
wretchedness sorrow and disgrace, he is conduct
ing young, credulous and unconscious girl from
her parents roof, TO linger oW ""a living death in
the charnei houses of prostitutionl -.s y,s T.; ~


Thus has he invaded with pestilencen the do
mestic hearth, and torn from her sacred dotnicH
the favorite daughter of defenceless and discon-
solate mother. = By this atrocty he has filled her
house with desolation, and stamped everlasting
infamy on her family, by the inefable ruin of her
daughter, We know Of no character so vile, so
detestable, He is the vilest Of robbers, for he
plumbers happiness; the worst of murderers, for
he murders innocence his appetites are of the
BRUTE his arts of the demon the heart of the
child and the curse of the parent are the founda-
tions of the altar which he rears to a lust whose
fires are the fires of hell and whose incense is the
agony of virtue. L@'aa. .; -~: 30 57.s.5'3


We have made this painful exposure, from a
sense Of duty, not only to the public press, but to
the community, whose virtuous sentiments have
been outraged by the commission of this crime.
The citizens had no knowledge OF it until it had
transpired. But they do not intend that such infa
nous conduct snail escape their severest censure,
and they desire thai the perpetrator shall be held
up to the public gaze, in the lurd glareof his de-
testable vice, ~.., '-' q a.' .'' ~s

sketch OF the Famous Empire Club, OF


the City OF New York.",BY A LOVER OF THE sroILs or OFFICE,"/


The history of the origin, character movements,


and dolngs OF this renowned and redoubtable Club,
which exerted so important an influence IN the
election of democratic President of the United
States, and which still continues to WELD potent
spell upon the question OF annexation and other
great national measures, and which bids ialr 10
work a revolution in the character OF New York
democracy, and totally blight the power that has
SO long maintained the regency IN that party-we
say brief history of this Club cannot but prove
interesting aud instructive IL Will certainly give
the public an insight into the character and move
ments Of class of men, technically called 1.-THE
bows"" who, at all times, WELD balance oil power
sufficient to control the election In the city OF
New York, and, therefore, likely enough to con.
troll the election in the State of New York, and
perhaps of an election throughout the Union


The New York Empire Club had It's origin In
the following manner 1t will be remembered that
some time prior TO the late fourth OF July, Mayor
Harper issued proclamation prohibiting booths. hre
crackers and other means and measures de Jo'e,
to the great disappointment and bitter evaporation
of all those who have from time immemorial been
accustomed tn celebrate that great national fesi-
val with the aforesaid means and measures de Jole
They regarded II as serious infringement OF their
democratic and patriotic rights. representative
nucleus OF the class alluded to, who were then IN
the habit of exchanging civitles, and taking So
cia glass at No. 81 Barclay street, whose walls
were once consecrated TO the arts and sciences,
but now devoted to billiards, tenpns, and other
healthfu urecreations-we say these representatives
did then and there discuss the grievances and in
frlngements aforesaid, until the result was the for
nation, on the Sd OF July eve, OF an extempora
neous ""Guard,"" which took the name OF the 'Em
pire Guard"" The object of the ""Guard"" was OF
an entirely ephemeial character-belng SIM
ply TO express their indignation at the afore
said infringement Of popular rights by May
or Harper and the ""Natves.""


On the eve of July Sd, 1914, the guard, to the
number of 30, formed at 81 Barclay street, and
drum, up Broadway as far as Reed street, where
they were met by similar party coming down
town, by which theirnumbers were soon increased
to about 100. Captain Rynders commanded the
5 Austin, at present Of the Novelty Saloon, corner
of Chambers street and Broadway, and well
known parsonage among the Boys"" about town.
of July eve in a highly patriotic and philosophical
style, by marching around town, and testing the
qualities OF liquors at various Restaurdteurs-untll3
O'clock on the morning Of the Fourth, when they
found themselves in circle around the tin dippe1
fountain in the Palk. AT ths time, Capt. Rynders
feeling slightly lndisposed from over patriotic exer-
ton, made farewell speech to the Guard, and re-
signed the command to Johnny Austin.


Il is not generally known that it has long been
the custom of ""the old Serenty STEERS"" to march
down in body 10 the Battery st daylight on tht
morning of the 4ih OF July, and fire salute. This
custom was known to the Guard, who marched
down to the Battery and ""received"" the old 76srs
on their arrival there. The guard then marched
through various streets about town to the door OF
Alderman Emmans, of the Sixth Ward, when they
gave him three cheers, and then adjourned to meet
the next evening (of the 4th) at No. ST Barclay
street.


According to adjournment. the Empire Guard
met 4th of July eve, at 81 Barclay street, form
ed in procession, and took up their line of march
about the city, led, before, by Captain Rynders,
with Johnny Austin at the rear, to prevent deser
ton and disorde1y behavior. rumor was cir
culaied that they intended to attack Mayor Har
per's house, in Rose street. 1t was true, bui
it brought in their wake about one hundred watch.
men, who were ready tor an emergency. The
Guard did march in front Of the Mayors house.
where they gave sundTy patriotic groans, and Cap
tain Rynders made them the following speech -
""Emore Guards! l am sorry that it has become
our duly to stop here under the present circum
stances. Therefore II has been customary such
IN occasion to greet our chief magistrate with
cheers. But times have changed, popular rights
nave been invaded, and instead OF cheers we are
compelled to give groans-not for the man, but for
ais principles aud measures. -ahgh--eIgh--
righ-boosh-uugh -""


From Mayor Harper's, the Guard continued the,
march through the Park down Barclay street 10
the steamboat South America, where they paftoot
OF refreshments with Captain Truesdall. Thence
they marched about town, until they brought up in
the Park, where Captain Rynders left them as be
fore, and Johnny Austin took command. After
some further marching and counter marching, the
Guard adjourned on the 5fh about three O'clock
A. NJ, in front of Kelys Comet, TO NEE
again at the call, by advertisement. OF John 5
Austin On the W hole Of this march, no man was
allowed TO leave the ranks, and no mischief was
done, nor outrage committed, unless II might have
been upon sundry champagne bottles whose necks
were summary lynched.


At This time The 4"" Empire Guard was composed
Of both wings and democrats. and even some :"" ma
tves"" and may be said to have had no political
character, nor Interior object, beyond the ephemera
one above named, OF expressing Indignation At the
prohibitions aud iuirlngements oi Mayor Herpei
and the "" natives"" Nor is it believed that more
than one of their whole number had at that time
any thought of any future organization, or exls.

 The great celebrity uf this unrivalled composition especially in the Northern States-leaves the pro prIetor but little need to say anything in it's favor for it has been generally conceded to it, that it is beyond all comparison, the best remedy for external complaints that has ever been discovered. Indeed the speed and certainty of its operations have the ap. pearance of miracles: ulcers, wounds. corns, fe- sores, chilblans, white swellings piles, piles spider and snake bites &c immediately yield 10 it's superhuDan influence. Thus, if properly applied, il will remove inveterate corn, break and heal bile m five dayss will aay and perfectly cure an u Ger in two weeks; and the most desperate cases o white swelling that cdn be imagined have been de. sroyed by in less than two months. In the bites of poisonous reptiles it's efficacy truly surprising and in the bite Of rabid dog; for if applied in time, its powers of attraction wonderful that they will at once arrest the poison, and thus prevent it from pervading the system IL is likewise greatly superior 10 any medicine heretofore discovered for the chafed backs and limbs of horses-ior letters, ring worms, chapped lips-and in short, for every external body evil that may fall to the lot of man or beast.

Why don't you have regular correspondent in
our growing and prosperous city-one who would
represent correctly the views OF our citizens, upon
the various questions that arise, and enghten the
beniahted o. the East 1t is really amusing to hear
what opinions are formed of the Westby citizens of
the East.

the Mississippi river into the frontier wilds Had

the past few years, lie would not have made such
great display OF ignorance as IN the, above
For the benefit of your numerous readers, ! Will
state that when the rivers are IN falr stage, they
can be accommodated with passages up the Illinois,
Mississippi and Missouri rivers, daily. There are
eight regular packet boats plying up the lli-
nols, making trip a week, and so arranged as TO
leave daily, Sundays excepted. On the Mississippi


four packets making each two trips per week TO
Keokuck, which is at the loot of the lower Rapids
there besides 10 10 which run above Burlng-
ton, Bloomington Gaena and Dubuque, and as far
up as II. Anthony Falls The Missouri packets
make their regular trips TO Lexington, Independence
and Westoa. Occasionally boat visits Council
Bluffs and once year the American Fur Compa-
ny send boat up TO the Yellow Stone, 2700 miles
above us, with provisions tor tn companies and
bring on their return, the result of their winters
trappings. Had those who live IN the Eastern States
an opportunity OF witnessing the hustle and activity
on our eyee, and the large stores upon Main, Mar
ket, Fourth and other streets, they would not call
il benighted place. and were they TO our ac-
compIshed, gayy attired ladies, as they promenade
our several streets and avenues, they would not ask
what kind OF dresses are worn by St LOUIS ladies


Another writer, who asks PERMISSION to address
few lines to the Herald from the city of mounds in
speaking of those who assist the slaves in escaping
says-""lf one of those agents should be caught, de-
pend upon il he woudhave justice meted out TO him,
without fear, favor parallty, from that eccentric
old gentleman, Judge Lynch"" The writer may
wish to see such persons strung up, but when he
speaks OF our citizens wishing such punishment
meted out to them, he greatly misrepresents them.
While we hold the man who entices the slave from
his master in utter contempt, and would gladly use
every legal means to have the fend arrested still we
have abiding confidence in the laws OF our State,
and place Implicit reliance In the officers to enforce


them, and believing that the punishment is sufficient
to bring those fanatics their senses without calling
in the aid OF that eccentric"" old gentleman. We have
/ given strong evidence that no more Lynching shall
be done withln our city, In the instance OF those
| black villains who sent two amable and much be-
| loved young men to their untlmely grave and fired
the building of Collier 4 Morrison, at which fire
man lost his life. The Inhuman beings had fair
and impartial trial, were convicted lawfully, and
/ their lives were demanded as appeasement oil vlo-


lated law. Let no one name Lynch law favorite
| of the St Loulslans after our having given ample
| proof to the contrary.


The act that has cast reflection upon city, by
] the barbarous treatment to slave some years ago,
who at dispatched two worthy citizens and sent
| them to their account unhousel'd unanneald, - has
been condemned in the strongest manner, and at this
day pretends to justify the rash act, though all
believe he deserved death In the interior counties
there are such lot of vagabonds, counterfeiters,
horse steaers, and all manner of rascals, that il is

regard to the solemntes of an oath, and by them

ment. In those counties they endure them until for
bearance to be virtue, and then resort to
arms, and compel them TO leave the country;


/ Two of those implacable foes TO the saveholdlng

tlyes, who detected enticlng slaves from then
owners; they too may learn some useful lesson with


in the walls of our penitentiary..


The old Democratic party is divided into hards, or
hunkers, and sots; the hards control all offices both
/ State and Government. But soft has been se-
1 ected by President Polk. The question is asked
/ how came he to receive the appointment But one
plausible answer can be given; and that Is that the
President, imagining trouble ahead, was desrous OF
having some one who could into tuturlty, so as


to be on his guard to meet head the bunker party.

certainty what is to happen. Such an officer would
| be quite an acquisition 10 the administration. And
! who knows but President Polk took that qualhca-
ton into consideration when he conferred the Office
| upon him. The appointment is looked upon as a
good one, and gives general satisfaction.

| The Constitution allows only 100 members IN the

but it is all for the good of the party and TO appease
some noisy politicians, old inspectors who first sug,

commenced in an old frame warehouse, must stand

Possessing qualities of highly cura- tive naure it has received the appreciation, and de | seryedly too, of medical men, whose standing and reputation in the estimation of the public placed | far too high to induce passing thought that any medicine unworthy their confidence should re- ceiye such strong and latlering recommendations. An Aperent possessing such medical properties, and which will realn its virtues in any climate, may , without the slightest inconvenience, be prepared and drank at any period, alording speedy relief to the body, oppressed and weakened during the overpow ering heat of southern climate and by its mild and | sure action on the system will assuredly restore strength and health the individual suffering under Bilious attacks, Dyspepsia or Indigestion, 'Fevers etc., the sure attendants upon southern latitude.-

Compounded strictly and carefully of

 those useful and health giving ingredients which im- pregnate the Selizer Spring of Germany, such im- proyements have been made, by the addition of large quantities of ihe most valuable articles, which must (as acknowledged by chemIsts) improve its efficacy, i and which have rendered.

Adapted for n warm climate, it is deserving the favor of travellers as preventive and dspeller of those Sick Head Aches, l4anguor of the Body, Loss of Appetite, Ac. dity of the Stomach, etc., the forerunners of bilious or iebrile attacks, which so often impair and pros- trate the healthy, sound constitution, and reduce il extreme weakness and debility, and often death, when unaccustOmed To the many sudden changes so usual at the south.

 Captains of vessels would find thIs preparation serviceable and valuable addition to their medicine chest, and with such as have supplied themselves, 1t has high favor.

Correspondence Of the Herald.l",,"the Braue-Col n. NJ johnson Meeting of


Strangers aud Temporqsy Residenfs-C Criminal


Court, &c. &C.


One OF the most respectable, interesting, harmo-
nious, and patriotic little meetings with which we
have ever had the honor to participate, was held in
the gentleman's parlor Browns Hotel, this day at
twelve o'clock


1t meeting OF strangers and temporary re-
sdents in Washington, for the expression of their
of respect due to the memory of the lustrous
Andrew Jackson.


Colonel r. M Johnson the noble old veteran of
the Thames was called to the chair. Vice Pres-
dents-Col. r. McNair, of Kentucky; James Breed
love, Esq. of Louisiana Major David Lynch, Of
Pennsylvania, and Caleb Gushing, of Massachusetts.
Secretary-George Pitt, Esq. of Pennsylvania.


Colonel Johnson to state the object of the
meeting. He was honored by the call of his fellow
citizens, temporary residents, and soourners
Washington to attend at this meeting, convened for
the grateful purpose OF the expression of suitable
testimonials to the memory of one of the greatest,
of OF the best, of the distinguished of
our fellow-citlzens-one who had died within few
days. He (Col. y could not withhold the express
sions OF his gratitude at being appointed to preside
over this Intelligent assembage; and if there could
be pleasure on melancholy an occasion, to con-
Tess the pleasure which he elt in the honor thus
| conferred upon him. He was indeed pleased TO see
SO intelligent and patriotic assembage-he was
pleased with the object of the meeting, and the
honorable post assigned hun in its deliberations





in order TO receive such propositions the members
of the meeting might think fit to submit.


MIR. +. A. DUNscoMB, OF New York, then
and proposed committee of three subsequently
modifying it to six, to draft report and resolutions


to be submitted to the meeting, prefacing his motion
with stirring little speech the character and SER
vices Of the deceased, in which he took occasion
to drop an appropriate compliment to the Hero of
the Thames


The resolution was adopted, and Messrs H. G.
Pope, of Kentucky; J: Mumford, of New York;
r. ?. Flannakin, Of Pennsylvania; E. a: Duns-
comb, Of New York; G. B. Wallis, OF Virginia,
and J. B. Guorie, of Pennsylvania, were appointed
the committee The committee retired, and after a
short absence, returned and reported most elo-
quent and beautiful eulogum, with series of ap-
proprlate resolutions, which, on being read to the
meeting by the chairman OF the committee,
Hon. CALEB CUSHING arose and said, with some
Introductory observations, not distinctly caught,
relative to his being accidentally in the city, that
the services, and the character patriot Of Genl
Jackson, silenced all controversy. His fame was
the fame of his country his deeds were embalmed
in the hearts of the people-his, glory belonged to
the lovers of freedom in our land and in all lands
He (Mr. O. remembered, on an occasion not dis
similar to this,-he remembered, on the occasion OF
the deaths r. Adams and Jefferson, the remark of
distinguish patrot that throughout the land there
should be expresslon-no volce-but the voice of
veneration for the worth, the services and the vr


tues OF those lllustrlous men. Mr. G. would send
abroad the same sentiment In regard to the patriot
whom we are now called to mourn and with some
| highly complimentary remarks upon the excellence
and appropriateness of the report and resolutions of
the committee, he moved that they be unanimously
| adopted, which was agreed to.


Col. johnson then and said, that Col. Mason
of the military of the district, had expressed his
gret at not having been apprised in time OF this
meeting, or that the volunteers of the city would
have testified their respect to this movement of the
strangers and temporary residents, by some act of
cooperation with them


The proceedings were ordered to be printed in
the papers of the District and the meeting adjourned.
The Criminal Court for tho county Of Washing
ton met this morning at 10 O'Clock. The District At
torney, Mr.. Fendal, then in his place. in brief and
opposite address, introduced the subject of the death
of Gen. Andrew Jackson the appropriate honors
that were due, and in view thereof moved that the
court adjourn till tomorrow. Mr. James Hoban
seconded the motion, and followed it up with
highly spirited euloglum upon the hero of New Or


leans, worthy of the oratorot the subject and of the
occasion; and in pursuance of the notion the court
adjourned.


Various meetings, civic and military, are to come
off in the three cities ofthe District this evening"" in
testimony OF respect 10 the m emory OF Jackson.

day, OF which an associate will advise you. Lieut.

Colonel is full OF life and anecdoe, and says that
like Sackett, at the Battle of the Thames, he is


thankful that, yet, his time has not come !"" but


that 1t war should ensue between the United States
and Mexico, and her allies he is ready TO ''pck his
flint and try 'em agln."" He accounts for his good
health and vvacity as resulting from the fact that,
he has dismissed all anxiety, all ambition, all de-

 the early part of the season. in bpf two of poriance. to wit: Planters Storage and Drayage fromour wharves to Press In relation to the first item we have adopted the rate unversall, preferred by the Planters, while were in the country last summer, and with which they expressed themselves entirely satisfied. Tn relation to the second we had only agreed 10 dray from wharf at cents per bale as an inducement to have cotton landed there. Had Planters complied rigidly with their promis- es to us us we have with our promises to them there would have been necessity fnra chauoe shtn item. As. however, with few exceptions, they have quietly allowed their cotton landed up fown in ron. sequence of which we have been compelled 10 pay 12f | and 10 cents per hale to have it drayed down. and canno, even now gel II done at that, feel justified ! m consentlng 10 the 10 cents drayage. A We, however, had another and a stronger motive Tn view The sp-own wharfngers for some time past have been in the habit of paying all the extra expenses incurred by boats cotton ordered to our wharves, but landed on theiI's in order to get the wharfage of the balance of the cargo and compel us to do all the long drayage. ',E

 We place ourselves in position to resist this ar- rangement and deprive them of any ,nducement to continue il, we consented to put up drayaee Know Ing that the aggregate charge could he made the same to the planter. by taking off the wharfage with winch the other presses had nothing do, and in to- days paper will be found notice to this effect Bv this we keep our faith to the country. and show to the parties ap''own what they may expect so long as they play thu grab game. and seek to deprive down tewn of it's fair share of business.

 we uhuerstahn that We are accused ot having into combination by this arrangement h regard to inc other Presses cannot answerfor ourselves we have only to cay it is not true. And if any one doubts the fact, let him give us an order on the other Presses for Coiton and he will soon ascertain wheth- CT or moi theie exists combination.
