lsays, 4"" We have received second communication
from Mr.. Madison. from which we learn that, in
disappearing of the proceedings of the General As.
sembiy of the State, which would limit the power
of Congress- over trade, regulations having revenue
alone for their obect,' he designed to give it as his
|opinion that Congress has Alright to impose tariff
of duties having for its objects protection and en-
coa4, ageme,,t of domestic manufacturers"" This was
the doctrine Of MIR. Madison and ninetenths OF the
Congress, in 1889, and nobody could doubt that it
was his doctrine still. But, after the argument
against it, inferred from the opinions of MIR. M. on
other topics, it is well that he has suffered his
opinion upon it to be given to the world in explicit
terms.


Mr.. Madson's Letter has spread dismay in the
Opposition ranks. The great lever. the uncon-
stitutionaity of the Tariff, that theme of so much
defamation, and of so much legislative hoeu'
pocus. has broken in their hands. Mr.. Madison
