The evacuation Of Richmond ard Peters,
burg has been followed by the surrender Of
Gen. Lee and the Confederate Army Of Nor
thern Virginia. The latter event occurred
on Sunday, 9th inst,-the correspondence
preceding which, with the terms allowed,
will be found 10 another column. The army
surrendered embraces Gen. Lee, three Lieu
tenant Generals, seventeen Major Generals,
sixty Brigadisrs, and from 10000 to %, 900
rank and file. In the list of Generals are
included Longstreet, Ewell, Kershaw. Pick.
EFT, Anderson, Mosby and others who have
been prominent in the Confederate service


After Lees retreat from Richmond he WAS
vigorously pursued by Grant, the fighting
being almost continuous from the 2nd until
the 7th inst, with Lees rear'guard. Grant
seems to have thrown out heavy force on
bis own left, on the Burkesvi!le and Danvlle
railroad, 10 outfank Lee which compelled
him to adopt the BurkesvilIe and Lyncbburg
railroad as a line Of retreat, and by this
means effectually preventing junction with
Gen. 10 Johnston's forces in North Carolina.
Placed in this situation, Gen. Lee was re,
duced TO the alternative Of fighting hope
lessly against overwhelming numbers, or
surrendering his army-he accepted the lat
ter. and received, as will be seen, very liberal
terms from Gen. Grant.


1t would seem from the accounts that Lee
was reduced 10 the necessity of surrenderng
AS be failed to make good his retreat after
leaving Richmond-but the reader of dis
patches will fod it difficult to understand
why be did not provide for safe retreat
when the evacuation Of Richmond became
necessary.


The news Of the surrender has been re-
ceived with accamations Of joy throughout
the country-and cannon firing and celebra
ting has extended from the Atlantic to the
Pacific 1t seems to be a prevailing senti
ment that the war is about over, and the
country will will soon return TO peace We
would be pleased to indulge the same hopes,
and see our bleeding and see our bleeding
and distracted country once again in the en-
joyment Of The blessings Of peace, with unity
and brotherhood prevailing over the whole
under our Constitution and flag. but we can
not yet see these roseate in our political sky.
A considerable army yet remains under the
command of Gen. Johnston, in North Caro-
lna as we'll as large bodies Of troops in Ala
bama and Georgia, and the armies Of Kirby
Smith west of the Mississippi Besides the
Confederales hold an extensive territory cap
able of yet supplying large armies. If these
armies are offered no other terms than un-
conditional submission TO the Federal Gov
srnment, it may be regarded as certain that
We have not yet reached the end of this de-
plorable war.


Dates to the llth inst, place Johnstou's
army within fifteen miles Of Gosdsboro.


The siege of Mobile is progressing. The
Federal forces are commanded by Gen. Can
by-tbe Confederate by Gen. Dick Taylor.


There is report that Forrest, with bis en-
tire command bas been captured by Gen.
Wilson, at Selma, Alabama.


1t is reported that Gen. Lee intends goiug
to Europe.


Secretary Seward was thrown from his
carriage, near Richmond, and injured se'
riously. His condition is considered critical.

The official returns are now fairly upon IN

the number of deaths now At 25O day, but
il il plain enough, from the number Of dead

far below the real mortality in the city, ahd

claim that but 200 hundred prisoners were

In the balance against the moral efDeots Of the
loss to Davis Of that unfortunate oity.

dersd; the nest In which tho adder's eggs Of this
giant treason were laid and Matched; where
the bloody gauntlet Of remorseless war was

sovereign authority Of the Union; whore,
through four long years Of this stupendous
struggle, all our efforts to punish her sudacity
have been bafled and laughed to scorn-Chsrles-
ton, the head and front and moving spirit Of
this rebellion, carries with her fall the knell Of
her monstrous offspring, from Richmond to the
Mexican border. The followers Of JeG Davis,
from Virginia to Texas, hitherto among his
most confident supporters, unshaken in their
devotion by all his previous disasters, will now
begin to realize his true position. The disaffeo-
tions in his political camp viii rapidly widen,
the absentees from and the demoralizations in
his armies will increase, the utter worthless
ness of his paper money will be felt and will
precipitate the final collapse Of his rotten
financial system, and in every form and on
every side the elements Of his confederacy will
fall to pieces, and its powers Of resistance, like
those Of Charleston, will be exhausted, and It's
armed battalions will melt away and disappear
from the face Of the land.


Such will be the moral effect Of the fall Of
Charleston throughout the broken and dis
jointed rebellious States Throughout the loyal
sections, including the States and districts
wrested from Davis, the effect win be new
and powerful impulse to the Union cause, and
to the good work Of filing up the gaps in our
armies by volunteers for q short campaign,
and . glorious peace, with liberal bounties, and
honorable distinction, and all, perhaps, without
mourning the danger Of single battle hence
forward to the end Of the war. The moral ef-
fsot in Europe Of our recovery Of Charleston
will be disastrous to the holders Of the rebel cot
ton loan, and to Spectators In and builders Of
cotton blockade runners, and will very much
enlarge the pacific inclinaHons towards this
country Of Lord Palmerston and Louis Napo-
leon.


But will this war be ended without another
great battle! II may not but we incline to the
opinion that It may be. The demoralzed trag-
ments of armies under Beauregard, Hardee and
Bragg, we will suppose, are aiming for juno
ton with Lee at or near Richmond. Assuming
that they will effect this junction, we cannot
doubt that simultaneously Sherman will strike
hands with Grant What theni Richmond
goes the way Of Charleston Jeft. Davis and his
Cabinet and Congress pack up and pack Oh by
the safest route for Mexico. The so-called Con-
federate government, at any rate, will be adrift.
General Lee, then falling back to Lynchburg,

the confederacy, and, like sensible soldier,
rather than Idle in the last ditch"" be will sur
render with the honors Of war, and the so-called
Confederate States will be dissolved, and
tour erring brethren"" restored to their true
allegiance. Let our gallant young men, in
clined to join our victorious legions in the
field, come forward, or they may lose this last

honors Of the glorious work now surely ap-
preaching the attainment Of q glorious peace.

Real Purposes and E0eots.


The Tribune few dAvs ago published

the caption Of 'The RecogA tion Intrigue"" in
which the writer stated that b had ""st length
obtained clue to the European compiot where
from the slaveholding rebels 4 re comforting
themselves with hopes Of powerfA' and speedy
aid for their sinking cause""


Now, when newspaper publishes double
loaded article in its principal editorisA column.
1t is generally supposed that something ositive
and emphatic ID meant But, on reading the
article in the Tribune, we find nothing 70 com
mand even ordinary attention. We arc th,rS
told that at an early stage of the rebelliAa
Dr.. Lynch, the Roman Catholic Bishop o.
Charleston, left the South for Europe on .
sort Of rowing commission from JEFF. Davis
to the governing Powers Of the Old World
but with instructions to make Rome BITE
focus of his operations. Granting that the
Bishop really went on the mission assigned him
by the Tribune, there Is nothing remarkable IN
it II is well known that our own government,
early in the struggle for It's supremacy, also sent
distinguished ambassador To Europe-the late
Most Reverend and lamented Archbishop.
Hughes-not for ""the purpose Of search
ing for sympathisers and allies"" but
10 enlighten the European governments con-
cerning the nature of the rebellion and the
grand purposes for which the nation was CON
tending. We all know what was the result
of the Archbishops mission. He was every
where received with courtesy and attention,
both as being high ecclesiastical dignitary
and the special representative of the United
States government He had audiences with all


The leading statesmen Of Europe, to whom hs
doubtless gave much valuable information


concerning our resources, power and de-


termination to put down the rebellion.


Nothing practical followed on the Archbishop's
visit to the other side of the Atlantic. A great
deal Of sympathy-real and unreal-was ex-
pressed with the country, and there the matter
ended.


OF the mission Of Bishop Lynch-if he really
had q direct mission from the rebel Presa-
dent-tbe same must be said. Whatever efforts
he may have made TO obtain tho aid q
the European Powers In favor Of tho
confederacy. 1t is plain that they have
all been futile and abortive. 1t is very reason
able to suppose that, being in Europe and
friend of the Southern cause, tho Bishop would
use all his influence to impress the governing
classes favorably as to the chances Of success
attending the rebellion. But this is not proba-


bly, the true reason that took Bishop Lynch to


Europe. After the complete blockade o9
Charleston, his ministerial occupation was gone
for the time being. In the severe bombard-


ment which that city suffered from the federal
forces the Bishops church, with its schools and
his flock were dispersed, and he suddenly
found himself at liberty to 60 where hs
pleased. He decided on going to Europe,
no doubt TO confer with the head Of the Church
on matters purely ecclesiastical But a. .

would tend to stop tho fratricidal strife -
6ercely raging here. That he did 80 We have
no doubt, and 1t is no wonder that, a. cour-
teous gentleman himself, he was courteously
received everywhere. When at the Pont6eal
Court of Rome he handed the letter Of Messrs.
Slidell, Mason and Dudley Mann 10 the Holy
Father. This document, with some others No

reply, will be found in another part Of to-day's
paper, republished from the HERALD Of Deceua-

In a letter from Virginia, writes as fol.

Yet fin6 no man who does not admit that,


In his own particular neighberhood, the

western Virginia-the colored population
may be truly described as orderly, industri-
GUS and selfsupporting. And this seems
TO be plainly shown by the reports, drawn
up by the government officials, of the issue
OF citizens of what are known as Destitute
rations.' The exact figures have In the
case OF two counties only. During the
month of June, relief was furnished 96I
pesons In Bedford County; of these, l3
were blacks. In Campbell County, $50
persons received sustenance from the gov
ernment; OF these $50 persons, 12 were
blacks. In other counties, sometimes less,
some times greater numbers of persons
than In Bedford and Campbell were sup
piled With food, and In them all the pro-
portion OF the negroes to the white people
was substantially the same with that given
above.


walking along the main street the
other morning, met several parties Of
boys and girls with primers in their hands,
evidently on their way TO school. Turning
about In my walk followed them till |
came 10 the door Of q large brick tobacco
warehouse or mandatory. Looking In l
saw that II was empty of merchandise,
and lifted up with benches as for school.
The scholars were there also, and two
soldiers, TO whom introduced myself,
and BY whom l was invited TO stay and
see the school In session. Both teachers
were enlisted men, pivates in a pennsyl-
vania regiment. They were detailed at
their own request for this duty. No pay lie
given them. but while engaged In teaching,
they are relieved from all camp duties.
One was without experience as a teacher;
the other told me he had been q school.
master before entering the army.


by nine O'Clock, about one hundred and
thirty children OF all ages between three
and twenty, were assembled, and the school
exercises began. 4 want TO be an angle,
was sung In clear and pleasant tones, and
with great correctness of emphasis and
pronunciation. The first stanza and cho-
rus all the children knew, and the rest OF
the hymn they sang two lines at a time
as the teacher dealt IL out 10 them.


while the singing went on, / amused
mysef by counting the faces which gave
unmistakable evidence of their owners be.
ing Of mixed blood. There were all tints
and shades Of yellow among the forty nine
boys present, and could find but twenty
seven who seemed TO be purely African.
Among the girls the proportion was much
the same.


""After the singing, q chapter in the New
Testament was read, and then the al alphabet
class recited. They knew their letters
backwards and forwards, they could pick
out the letters by name, and they could
tell which were vowels and which conso-
nants. thought they had made rapid
progress In the four weeks during which
they had been under instruction.


""A more advanced class then read

OF the little girls read exceedingly well
They had been taught, they said, when
they were slaves.


In Lynchburg, besides this school, which
contains about one hundred and fifty
pupils, there Is another, taught in the
same way, which contains three hundred
and hfty more children. 1t is a pleasant
and encouraging sight to see the willing
ness with which the scholars apply them
selves to their lessons, and the very res
pectable measure of success which rewards
their efforts.


ut is a sight, too, which has attracted |
some attention In Lynchburg. The RepI5-

Army of tho Shenandoah since the COM
mencement Of Gen. Grants campagp:-


he supplies fer Sherdan's army are again
sent, at great expense, from Baltimore to the
genera! depot at Halper's Ferry; and Sheri-
dan's army is now doing nothing more, and
will DO nothing more all winter, than merely
to guard the line OF the Potomac. This is
the lame and impotent conclusion of the
campaigns of 1864 in the valley; campaigns
which, under SigeI, Hunter, and Sheridan,
have been conducted with $4,000 men, Of
whom only 2l,OO0 now survive. Here is
the whole matter in brief: On the 5th of
May Sigel had 5000 troops. lie lost in
that month 5000. General Hunter added
$4,000 fresh troops in June, and took CON,
maud also, Of the 5000 that were left under
Sigel. But he left Sigel there with 5000
troops at Winchester, while he made his
campaign agans. Lynchbur5 with bis own
II, 900 men, who were all welltrained SOL
diers. He lost 5000 Of his own troops, and
Slgel lost 1900 when he was driven from
Winchester by Early. About the 18th Of
July, Gen. Wright took into the Valley the
9th and 10th corps, 1000 strong, and ad.
ded to them the 6,0OO left under Hunter and
toe 1000 left under Sigel. Among these
was Crooks division. Gen. Wright only
lost 5000 men in bis brief campaign, when
he was superseded, on the Jth Of August, by
Gen. Sheridan. Gen. Sheridan brought with
him from the james river, u, 900 cavalry.
and from Washington division of infantry,
1000 strong. Another division Of infantrv,
OF 1900 men, was assigned to him from the
8th corps, and he also took command Of the
$4,000 men just named, under Gen. Wright.
This gave him 1000 men to start with. He
was reinforced between the Goth Of August
and the 9th Of October, by $4,000 new
recruits, OF whom 5000 were substitutes and
personal representatives, and 1000 were
drafted clen. Your readers will no doubt
have noticed the official statement made a
few days ago, by MIR. Whiting, solicitor OF
The NaF Department, to the effect that since
the Goth Of last August, there have been
10000 voluntary enlistmenis into the army.
This statement, have ascertained, is true.
But the ""voIun,arv enlistments"" include and
indeed are composed Of substitutes aud per-
sonal representatives, put in by individuals
and towns in order to avoid draft And J
have asceTtaaed also, that the last draft itself
has actually produced between 10000 and
and l3O, goo men.


Here then are 100000 men, who have
been raised since the Goth Of August. What
has become Of them? $4,000, know, have
been sent 10 Gen. Grants army, al! Of them
having reached lin before the oOth ult.;
$1,000 Of them, know, have been sent to
Gen. Sheridsu's S army, the last detachments
having bean sent up last week. But this
only makes 05 900 men. What has become
OF the ether 10000 men? Gen. Sherman
needs 10000, but have not heard of any
having been sent to him. Gen. Sheridan,
then, has had in all $1,000 men, wherewith
to conduct his campaigns. lie lost in his

Join Cox, in order to annihilate him before
Couch should come. All night long they
charged again and again. making SIX or
seven different charges. amid the roar of
musketry and cannon that was deafening
and terrible, as 1t swept and surged through
the night air. They drove our skirmsh line
from their rifle pits to the breastworks, and
seemed determined to pour their hordes over
into these. but were sent bounding back
time after time. and finally on morning OF
the 10th, as they attempted another Hank
movement upon our left, it is said that we
took from them an entire regiment. From
this time their ardor began to cool, and
yesterday P NJ, when | left the immediate
scene of action, there was every prospect that
we would soon regain the skirmish pits and
win handsome victory over the maddeneu
foe. We have probably taken from the
commencement up to last evening not lar

the commencement, in killed, wounded and
prisoners. cannot be ovor 1000.


Newburn n. c., l2th.-Yesterday enemy
fell back across Neuse river, after burning
bridge over that stream. 1t is reported that
he also destroyed rebel ram at same time
which was guarding the bridge. Timber is
now going forward to rebuild bridge. Road
is completed to within short distance of rail
road opposite Kinston. Enemy will not be
able to remain in Kinston long, even should
they decide to- make another standi OF which
there is much doubt Deserters and refugees
continue to come into our lines. Our troops
are in high spirits over the prospect OF meet
ing Sherman soon. Sherman has opened
communications with Wilmington from Fay
etteville. and sends word that he is all right
and marching on. We expect to hear graft
flying news from him in few days.


New York, 15th.-ltappe by later news
that the defense of Fort Myers, Florida, by
Union garrison was a stubborn one, and re-
suited in finally obliging rebels to retreat.


There are varions reports at City Point and
in Wilmington concerning Sheridan's move
ments. One says that he entered Grants
lines northeast of Richmond. while another
says he has kept on southwark, just west Of
Richmond.


Herald's Washington special says that no
doubts are entertained here that Sherman has
reached Fayetteville without an engagement
of any kind except cavalry skirmishes. He
will be joined at Fayetteville by Schofeld and
be resuppied. Notwithstanding boast of
Richmond papers Sherman shows that they
can't stop his progress.


New York, I4th.-Herald' Washington
special says military operations tonight are
understood to be more promising than at any
period during the war.


Richmond papers to-day are filled with
doleful comments on condition of affairs which
they represent as being desperate. Sheri-
dan, they admit, has played mischief with
their avenues of supplies, and fears are ex-
pressed that he will reach Burk's Station, at
junction of Petersburg and Lynchburg and
Richmond and Danville railroad, and gone
either To Sherman or Grant which will save
Grant the cutting of Southside Road and
leave Lee to alternative of submission or di-
viding his already depleted forces and open
ing Richmond to Grant. Richmond papers
state that rebel Congress, which was to ad-
iourn last week, have at request of JEFF Davis
postponed adjournment. He informed them
that he expected to have something import
ant to lay before them.


Richmond Wing says though it is well
known there is a Yankee cavalry force raid
ing through some of the counties west Of
Richmond on the Central Railroad, by ad-
vice of War Department it is deemed inexpe-
dent to publish anything concerning their
movements."

The defeat of the plan to use the New-iork
Clearing House as a machine to run interior banks
upon their circulation is satisfactory to all reeeiv-
ling currency from the country in the regular course
of trade. They are thus far unable to see any df'
ference in the notes whether issued IN Iowa or
New-York City; and so long as the Comptroller AZ
Washington performs his duty the distinction VIII
not be apparent. The portion of the city banks

Controller in the form of letters, when, now

When Congress assemblies the Banking Law VIII

providing for the interest upon the National Debt,
, IT NAV enter the mind of some member to propose
that the Government assume the redemption OF the
4 .,l. Not of Ia a.
limbursiug the banks for the bonds they now hold
! under the law. Under the act, the Government
pays gold interest or six per cent upon deposits as
security for circulation and prints the circulation

now receiving basis upon that of circulation iur'
nished by the Government slO, 900 per annum
lin gold. and il can reach $lS,00O,O00 per annum.
This sum may be thought worth saving, and Con-
gress may be found ready to do it rather than press
too burdcnsomc tax bills. II is already intimated
that Washington officials favor making National
Bank notes illegal tender II the wind sets in
that quarter, there Is no good why the peo-
pie who owe 1900 100000 Of currency should not
do so in the form OF plain legal-tendcrs, thus en-
ployng free of interest onc-tenth of the whole Ma
tional Debt. 1t would take from the banks a
source Of much profit, but It's benefits could be
rcaped by the profit in the form Of reduced taxation,
and in the use of a currency which need not be run
home for redemption. The National system, As
longas it authorizes only $500 900 900 Of circulation,
is in no danger of explosion. There is a good deal
of loose talk about amending the law, so as to allow
as much more, but there is small hope that such an
extension will be- made"

what he has done:


Since the 4th of October he has forwarded TO

These ara some of the principal articles for

met IN Shasta, to nominate candidates for the
suffrages of the Union voters of the County
and they did it. For particulars see report
of proceedings.


Seldom have the people of our county been
so well represented. We do not remember
to have seen on former occasion such con-
gregation of respectability and good looks.
We are more favorably impressed, than ever
before, with the idea that Shasta is the place
for unmarried ladies in Yankee land to come

them


In the nomination of full ticket by any
Convention, there must be many disappoint-
ments. In the past one there was probably
as little of it rs at any of its predecessors.
The nominees are such as every consclen'
tous man can support without eavil. Except
four, the nominees are tried men-men who
have occupied the Offices to which they are
renominated for the past two years. The
Convention wisely endorsed them. The new
men-viz: Chandler, for Treasurer; Fol
lansbee, for District Attorney; Carter, for
Superintendent of Public Schools; and
Lynch, for Public Administrator, are Off
cially untried, and successors Of men who
have ably, honestly, and carefully discharged
their duties. Of course we make ourself an
exception to the above in that connection
and here take pleasure in congratulating our
Young friend on his coming honors-com-
mending him and his curls to expectant
damsels seeking the honors of a certificate,
Girls, fear not For your sakes we would
we were boy again''-and for our own,
too.


The nominee for District Attorney, though
not member of the legal profession, is a
man whose talents and pure moral character,
industry and pride in doing well whatever
he undertakes, is sufficient guarantee that
the duties of that office will be efficiently
discharged.


What we have said of the nominee for
District Attorney, may be duplicated and
applied to the very good nominee for County
Treasurer.


Every body knows Dan Lynch. nominee
for Public Administrator. If honesty makes
a man suitable for the Office, the Convention
have struck it.


One word for our present County Treasurer
None have heen more faithful or more
efficient. lie made a strong fight for re-
nomination, and lost it, Mr. Chandler will
have a good set of books passed over to him,
in which plain road is we'll laid out. If he

count OF the defeat or Early by Clusters di-
vision. The same night this division was
pushed across the Blue Ridge, and entered
Charlottesville at p. IN. the next day. The
mayor OF the city and the principal Inhabitants
came out and delivered up the keys of the pub
lie buildings. had to remain at Charlettes-
willie two days.


This time was consumed in bringing over
from Waynesboro onr ammunition and pom
toon trains. The weather was horrible beyond
description and the rain incessant. The two
divisions were during this time occupied in
destroying the two large iron bridges, one over
the Rivanna river, the other over Morses
creek, near Charlottesville, and the railroad
for q distance of eight miles, in the direction
of Lynchburg. On the 9th of March l sent the
first division, General Devin commanding, to
Scottsville, on the James river, with directions
TO send out light parties through the country
and destroy all merchandise, mills, factories,
bridges, etc, on the Rivanna river. These
parties to join the division at Scottsville.


The Division then proceeded along the canal
to Duguidsvile, fifteen miles from Lynchburg,
destroying every lock and in many places the
bank OF the canal. At Duguidsyille we hoped
TO secure the bridge to let us cross the river as
our pontoons were useless on account of the
high water, in this, however, we were toiled,
as both this bridge and the bridge at Hard
W icksville were burned by the enemy upon
eur approach. Merritt accompanied this Di-
vision.


The Third Division started at the same time
from Charlottesville, and proceeded down the
Lynchburg railroad to Amherst q. H., de.
stroying every bridge on the road, and in
many places miles of the track The bridges
on this road are numerous, and some Of them
500 feet in length. We have found great abun-
dance in this country for our men and ami
mails; In fact the canal had been the great
feeder OF Richmond. AT the Rnrka.h -i-er

raining hard every day with the exception OF
four days since we started NV wagons have,
from the state Of the reads, detained me. Up
TO this present time we have captured fourteen
pieces OF artillery-eleven at Waynesbero and
three al Charlottesville.


The party that sent back from Waynesboro
started with six pieces but they were obliged
to destroy two of the six for want of animals
The remaining eight were thoroughly destroy.

Tho Spring Campaign-Grant and sher-


man tho Real Peacemnkers.


The time is near when the realities Of another
spring campaign will startle the country. In
1862 the campaign against Richmond began in
April, and on the 4th of that month our
troops were in front Of the enemy's position at
on the 26th of April, and fought at Chancel-
lorsville on the LIST and I'd Of May. In
1864 Grant crossed the Rapidan on the 4th of
May. In none Of those years was there any
thing done before May-for McClellan's first
battle was in that month-and the example of
those three years would seem to establish that
active operations before May are not practica-
BILE.


But in the present year the circumstances ere
different, and seem to favor the probability
that we shall get into active operation much
earlier Grant is already in front Of the posi-
ton where the enemy must necessarily light.
He is consequently not under the obligation to
wait for settled weather, and settled soil that
q general is under whose operations may in
volve many marches, and whom fifty or sixty
wagons mired in road may force to precipt
tate retreat Grant is not the same slave Of
the elements in any respect that our generals
have been hitherto in the pursuit of this same
object-and he may avail himself Of little
spell Of fair weather in March, when general
hundred miles farther from Richmond would
not dare to stir from camp, lest sudden storm
should surprise him in the midst Of a mansuvre
and render it impossible either to advance or
retire. Grant may begin at the first Of March
more safely than Mcclellan did at the first Of
April. We have every confidence that he will
begin at the earliest practical moment


And when he does begin the storm Of war
that will roll over the land will be more ter
rible than any the country has yet seen. As
this spring campaign will be the most momen-
tous Of all we have had, and may be the last Of
efforts on our part that we have yet made Our
armies under Grant, Sherman, Thomas and
Sheridan are in the best possible condition, and
are composed in larger degree Of hardened
veterans than ever hitherto. All Of them will
no doubt be moved with one purpose against
one point, and such will be their weight and
volume and the effectiveness Of such q united
blow that it is not possible to conceive Of their
failure. Grant last year, with an army COM
posed in great part of green men, forced Lee to
Richmond, and held him still six months. Sher-
man forced Johnston and Hood deliberately
backward from Ringgold to Atlanta without
the loss of battle. How is 1t possible, then,
that Grant, now with we'll trained army, and
| Sherman, with his veterans can, acting to-
gether, concentrated against Lee, fail to crush
the power that Lee has left. 1t is not possible;
| and even the enemy's own organs are hypo-
critical and insincere when they 80 noisily ex-
press their confidence in Lees success.


Such developments of the projected opera
tions as have already been made are Of course
contraband. But the general fact Is obvious
that the grand feature will be an immense at
enemy's only remaining army, at whatever
| point it may be found or forced to. Sherman
is now reported within forty miles of Charleston
with his whole force, and can take that city as
easily as he did Savannah. He will then doubt
less move for Florence, s. G., crashing through
the State az easily as squadron Of cavalry
would through field Of ripened grain. Grant,
In the meantime, will have settled matters at
Wilmington and Weldon, 80 that Lee will receive
only such supplies - come BY Lynchburg,


from the border counties Of Virginia and North


Carolina He will also, doubtless, have rein
forced the army on the James with every man
that can possibly be taken from other points;
and when all this Is done, and Sherman II
within supporting distance, the two great SOL


that they will not have to repeat


Il will be q tremendous campaign; and the
enemy have not the least confidence in their


ability TO resist it. Hence they are, no doubt, in


earnest in their present movements towards
peace. They would like to save little Of their


glory. Proud as they are, and indisposed to


bend, they can yet see how much better II Is


to 90 down than TO be put down. They see that


the North is ct last in fighting trim, and II


would give them bitter pleasure to cheat 1t OF


the final success by diplomatic lodges. They


want to come into the national councils again


on better status than they would II they suffered


the last defeat They want to come Boosting that


their main army has never been decisively


beaten. Hence they will make peace If possible


The country, however, had better rely upon


Grant and Sherman as pcacemakers. We will


not 70 SO far a. to say that II would be better
II the men now at Fortress Monroe should no


agree upon peace; but we are Of opinion tina


the country would have more tranquil future
in the event Of their failure than in the event o
their success; and we believe that the peac


that Grant and Sherman would make wou
wear and wash great deal better than on

geographical division of the State be sp-
pointed on Permanent Organization.


Lieut.. H. NJ Rankin, of Memphis, moved
to amend by making the committee one from
each county.


Considerable discussion ensued. Mr.. Wat
kins' motion was lost, as was also the amend
ment.


On motion of Mr.. Harris, of Davidson, q
committee Of three from each district of the
State was adopted. The following gentle
men were nominated:


sssss. .9g5 1FsCrI IS, 81 I5a
wilson: James T. Rapier Of Maury; B. P.
Frierson, of Rutherford.


East TennesSee-H Alexander, of Knox
c.. A. Mckinney, of Hawkins F. Maxwell
of Washington.


Vest Tsnnessee-H. N. Rankin, J. j. W.
Jones, and Warren Madison, of Shelby.


While the Committee were absent, the
Rev. Mr.. Shepherd, Chaplain of the 18th
u. S. Colored Infantry, was called upon to
address the Convention, He responded in
well-timed and earnest words of sympathy,
encouragement and advice to the delegates
for prudence and kindness in their delibera-
tions, and to the audience for good order du
ring the proceedings. In closing, the Chap
lain expressed his qualification at being pres
ent, and said for twenty years he had labored
for the good of the slave, and for the free
dom of all men.


A. Griffin, of Smith. county, was thsn
called for. Mr.. G. is one Of the very few
Southern white men who, outgrowing the
preiudices of race and condition, stands for
the inRlienable rights of man. His remarks
were earnest and sincere and warmly re
ceived.


Sergt H. j. Maxwell, I'd Battery, U. S.
Col. L. A., was then introduced. The Ser
eeant made an eloquent speech, in which he
struck the keynote Of the occasion. He was
there as an American, claiming the inaliena-
BILE rights of man. Life, liberty, and pur-
suit of happiness, were his prerogatives
Lite and liberty meant to share in the Gov
eminent by which they were protected and |
the right to live anywhere on the continent. |
Should not these rights be the rallying |
theme of the Convention. By this music we
march to victory. We shall be heard before
Congress and before the Legislature. We
come here for principles, and there will be
no discension. We want the rights guaran
teed by the Infinite Architect. For these
rights we labor; for them we will die. We
have gained one-the uniform is its badge.
We want two more boxes, beside the car
fridge box-the ballot.box and the jury box.
We shall. gain them. The government Of
this nation will not prove false to its plighted
faith. It proclaimed freedom and we shall
have that in fact It will not forswear itself
Let us all work faithfully unto the end.


The Rev. Mr. Merry followed Sergt. Max
well in allusion to the former enjoyment of
suffrage by free colored men of Tennessee.
He named, then in Convention, who had
voted for Gen. Jackson for President-the
Rev. Edmund Jones and Andrew TAFT. The
Rev. gentleman proceeded to urge harmony
in council and advise that all talk be directed
to stir the heart to action, and not influence
the tongue to noise.


The Rev. James Lynch, of Baltimore, Mis-
sionary in South Carolina and Georgia re-
sponded to call, and in most eloquent and
stirring speech spoke of the rights which had
already been achieved, and those which were
yet to be gained. The speaker made telling"

The Committee appointed to wait upon

Parrish, of Davidson; A. Williams, of Viii
hanson l.. II. Mazeck, McMinn J. Turner,

Pending discussion of the finance ques
ton, General Fisk entered the hall amid
loud cheering and applause.


Mr.. Watkins introduced the following reso-
luton: ~


WHEREAS, we, in Convention assembled,
in order to deliberate as far So we are able,
upon the present condition and future pros
poets of the colored people of Tennessee
and whereas, it is expedient, in all our delib-
erations we will put forth to them our senti-
mantss -e--@ss~1-a- a--r-s-


Resotoed, That we will publish an address
to them and cause it to be circulated through
out the State.


WHEREAS, the petition presented by the
colored people ofTennessee TO the Legislature
thereof, has not been disposed of by that body,
as we understand, because they do not know
the sentiments of their constituents-there-
fore, belt


ReSotyed That we publish an appeal to the |
loyal white citizens of Tennessee upon the |



Inasmuch as the Federal Government has |
called for our assistance in putting down the |
late iniquitous rebellion, and acknowledged |
not only our humanity and right to freedom,
but our just claim to all other citizens under |
the Government therefore, be it


ReSOlUed, That we protest against the Con- |
gressionsl delegation from Tennessee being |
received into the Congress of the United |
States, if the Legislature of Tennessee does /
not grant the petition before it prior to Decem-
Der l, 1865.


They were laid over till afternoon.


A lively debate followed the reading of the
and the Rev. James Lynch, of
Baltimore, Maryland, spoke as follows:

Rcbel Generals Early and Haygood.


Our latest dispatches received last night and
published this morning give us intelligence Of
the highest Importance from the seat Of war.


We learn from North Carolina that Sherman,


by an unexpected movement, had succeeded in
capturing, with the exception of single bat
talon, Haygood's entire brigade, which at the
time occupied the west bank Of Cape Fear
riVer From the Shenandoah our news is
equally gratifying. On February 27 Major
Il heral Sheridan, with large force Of cavalry,
seq out on an expedition up the valley. His
column moved with great rapidity, insomuch
that spies and sympathizers along the route had
no time lp raise the alarm and caution the
enemy q be on his guard.


Through several deserters, arriving at differ
ent times and at different points, we learn that
General Sheridan fell upon Early on the I'd
inst, between Staunton and Charlottesville,
capturing Early himself and his whole COM
mand. The enemy, alarmed at this sudden
appearance Of our forces in so close proximity
to his most important line Of communications,
Immediately detached four brigades from the
garrison at Richmond and despatched them in
all speed to reach Lynchburg before Sheridan.
The entrep6ts Of Lynshburg and Danville are
now the principal sources of supply to Rich
mond, and the value which is placed upon
thsm is plainly to be seen in tho large REIN
forcements sent to protect them. It is said
when Generals Crook and Kelley were brought
before Early he requested them to be seated,
remarking, my turn may come next Some
enterprising Yankee will come along and cap
ture me-"" He little dreamed that his words,
uttered in Jest, would be SO speedily verified.


Thus, as indicated u the news now published,
every day brings us nearer to tho final issue Of
our recent and rapid succession Of victories.
Gradually the armies Of the nation are envel-
oping the centre and last stronghold Of the re-
bellion. Grant holds Lee at Richmond; Sher-
man, with The veterans Of the West, is sweeping
up from the South, driving the enemy irresisti-
bly, before him; Sheridan now pours down from
the North, directly mcnacing the last resource
Of the enemy by the Lynchburg Railroad; and
Candy, ere this, is brushing away what remains
Of the rebellion in Alabama. n'he days Of Rich
mond and the rebel confederacy are verify
numbered."

There have been numerous dispatches this
week of the movements of Sherman, but SO
contradictory that it is impossible to recon
cils their discrepancies. As long ago as the
18th Of February, his army entered Colum.
bia, s. G., and while there laid the main por
ton of the city in ashes. Since that time
be has been reported at Florence, in the
same State; as we'll as at Charlotte, Fayette-
Vile, and near Wilmington, North Carolina.
As these places are long distances apart, it is
not possible that Sherman can have occupl-
ed all Of them; and be is too shrewd COM
mander to separate his columns beyond sup
porting distances Of each other. The rebe
newspapers decline to give any Information
of bis movements, and as he has no commu
uication with the coast, anything purporting
10 be news from him since leaving Columbia
is mere guess work. 1t cannot be doubted,
however, from the strength of bis army, that
he is pressing forword to North Carolina,
and many DAYS cannot elapse before correct
information of bis position will be obtained.
II would seem, that in order to secure coop
Grafton with Schofields forces, at Whining
ton. bis columns would incline in that direc-
ton, and We think junction may be looked
for on Cape Fear river, not far from that
town.


What force the Confederates are opposing
10 Sherman is unknown as well as their sit
uation. 1t was said several weeks ago, that
Beauregard was in command but that he
has been superseded by Gen. Joe Johnston,
and that the former has since repaired to
his command in the district within which
Mobile is included.


As there is no report of fighting between
Johnston and Sherman, it may be safely as
sumed that The former is gradually falling
back, with the view of selecting the point o
contest. Some correspondents assume that
that point will be on the line Of the Roanoke
river, within distance Of support of Lees ar
my at Richmond.


But at present an impenetrable veil covers
that portion of the military field, and We will
have to await-not long-the lifting Of the
curtain. The spring campaign is about com
mencing 10 more formidable proportions than
even that inaugurated by Gen. Grant last
year, and clash of arms may be looked for
that will excel in Importance the great strug-
giles Of the previous four years.


At Richmond there is watchful activity on
the part Of both armies, yet no collisions of
moment.


q There is report from various sources that
Sheridan has again met and defeated Early
near Gordonsville. This may be true, al
though Early was reported, several weeks
ago, to have been superseded by Gen. Cor
don. Sheridan is said to be aiming al
Lynchburg.


The campaign at the East seems to absort
entire interest, as little or nothing is sait
about the armies in Tennessee and Alabama
and in fact it is doubtful whether events will
be great in that quarter the coming summer
as renforcements from both the armies o
Thomas and Hood have been sent to the At
lantic seaboard to take part in the great con
test 80 near at hand.


The concentration Of troops at New Or
leans, that has been going on for some time
would seem TO be for Mobile, as it is now
stated that Gen. Candy has gone to the at
tack Of that place.


The President delivered bis inaugural or
Saturday last. 1t will be found in another
column. AS an address from so high
source it disappoints general expectation.


1t is reported that the only changes mad
BY Mr.. Lincoln in bis Cabinet, was the ap
pointment of Mr.. Mccullough, Of Indiana, a
Secretary OF the Treasury, in place OF Nj
Fessenden, reelected to the Senate Th
Senate confirmed the appointment, but hav
taken 20 action on the other names present
cd; and private dispatch received at Sal
Francisco from a prominent politician a
Washington, says in effect the confirmation
Of Mccullough is refusal to confirm th'
other nominations. In other words very
strong hint to Mr. Lincoln that the radical
demand new men, and for Mr.. Seward 10 re
tire to private life.

but we have the details of the alleged defeat Of
our troops at Kiuston. The affair seems to
have been of no great consequence. General |
Cox had an advance Of Palmers force of Fos- |
ter's army moving up from Newbern towards |
Goldsboro probably to assist Sherman, The |
rebels got between two of his sklrmishing par
ties and captured about 4j0 men instead Of the
1900 reported. About i01 prisoners we're Ia
ken by Cox. The fight did not prevent Fos-
ter'S force from advancing. 1t Is remarkable
OF this action that Bragg could not, with Hokc'
and Hills commands, muster enough troops to
arrest Fosters advance. Before Sherman
there must then be only the small garrisons Of
Charleston and Columbia, under Hardce and
Beauresard, so that Sherman can walk over
the country without fear. When Schoiield
joins Foster, there Will be an overwhelming
force in that quarter. Gen, SrhoGeld was at
Newbern on his way to juin his army cooper
ating with Fosters There is a report that
portion OF Shermans force had liberated the
Union prisoners at Salisbury, which, if true,
shows that Sherman has advanced some thirty
miles above Charlotte, in North Carolina
Salisbury is one of the most important places
in western North Carolina: it is Is miles west
of Raleigh. The Central Railroad passes
through this town. The news from this guar
ter is probable enough to be true At Mobile.
the force Of General Smith Is operating with a
fair prospect Of success.

 MORE GLORIOUS RE EWS!

THE SURRENDER OF LEE AND HIS ARMY TO GEN. GRANT.

THE VIRTUAL END OF THE REBEL

 LION",,"1he facts preceding and concluding this blessed result are briefly stated as follows :- From the hour of Sherilan's victory over Lees ] right wing. on Saturday week, followed imme- 1 diatey by the grand assault along the whole line and the capture of Petersburgh, the Con- 1 federate cause was lost. The evacuation of Richmond on the following Sunday, put Lee ! in rapid and almost disorderly retreat He l hoped to be able to escape by or around Burkes-

 vile Junction, with mere chance of getting off toward North Carolina, and perhaps with a

 fai prospect of forming junction with John ston. But Grants pursuit was :oo vigorously

 pressed His irresistible cavalry, led by the

 hero of the Shenandoah and backed by Grant

 in personal comm and, swept down the South

 side Road, seized the junction, shut Lee of

 from 50 much as crossing the Appomattox, and forced him to abandon all hope oi help

 from Johnston. That Lee struggled hard aud

 fought hard to avoid this disaster; our columns

 have already shown. He had, then, but two

 things to do to make bis way to Lynchburgh,

 where he could only hide behind his vast forti

 fcations and be starved out, or come to d com plete surrender. Lyrchburgh, strong by nature and by art, would have been place of safety for the present, if he had reached it. But Grant had already provided for this emergency Thomas was coming from East Tennessee, and | Schofeld from the Shenandoah Valley with i powerful columns, which, with Grants own

 forces, would speedily have besegel the rebel chief with circunvallation of bayonets that for half year have gistened with victory j; every avenue of supplies would have been In our hands; every railroad, canal, river and turnpike would have been crossed by our fortI- 1 fcatlons to remain would have been death-,to fight out would have been accepting odds that might have appalled, the most reckless. Thus 1 brought to bay, and hourly harrassed by pur suit that knew no such word as rest, Lee has succumbed to his fate. On Saturday, Gen. Grant sent note to Lee lntimating that he was willing to accept reasonable terms ot sub mission. This appears to have been anticipated by Lee who was on his picket-llne when the note reached him He replied desiring an inter view. Grant returned answer that he would hurry forward to meet him. The next note gives the terms proposed by Grant, which are as follows:

 Il propose to receive the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia on the following terms, to witt Rolls of all the officers and men to be made in duplicate one copy to be given to an officer designated by me, the other to be retained by such officers as you may des- ignate. The officers to give their individual paroles not to take arms against the Govern ment of the United States until properly ex- changed, and each company or regimental commander sign like parole for the men under their commands. The arms, artillery and public property to be packed and stacked and turned over to the officers appointed by me to receive them. This will not embrace the side-arms of the officers, nor their private horses or baggage. This done, each officer and man will be allowed to return to their homes, not to be disturbed by United States authority l so long as they observe their parole and the laws in force where they reside.

 To this proposition, Gen. Lee immediately returned answer in the following terms:

 have received your letter of this date, con- taining the terms of surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, as proposed by you. As they are substantially the same as those ex pressed in your letter of the 8th instant, they are accepted. I will proceed to designate the proper officers to carry the stlpulations into effect.

 Thus upon terms both honorable and gener ous, upon terms which place the responsibility of their breach upon the rebel leaders, the only really great army, the main stay and very soul of the rebellion, gracefully yields to the over whelming power of the Union-that Union soon to rise from it's baptism of blood, regener- ated, purified, and conscious of a strength that shall withstand alike the jealousles of rival powers abroad and the shocks of treason with"

As it is neither | like the model nor built of marble, and has suffered good deal lately, it has rather what the French call degraded look.

 TWO STANDARD BEARERS cF THE UNION.

 From the roof of this building floats the standard sheet of the Union and in the hand of Cfawford's noble statue of Washington, which rises on stately pedestal in the square, little way to the right of the grand flight of the Capitol steps, another ensign of the stars ands dsstrpes hutters to the breeze, placed there by some patriotic soldier of Weitzel's force. The statue of Henry Clay. which stands by itself in queer little sort of guard house with 1 q cupola roof. to the left of the Capitol, has | also been decorated with a cavalry guidon.- Who will oare uisplace it? No rebel that wears boots. venture to say!

 I In the rear of the Capitol, in one corner of the square, and as have already said, near my own headquarters, is the Governors House."" the executive mansion of Virginia, hastily vacated by ""Governor Smith and ten anted now by General Devens, who will keep 1 it warm for the next loyal governor of the Old Dominion. They tell me that in Letcher's time it's cellars were filled with prime Bourbon; but that's a matter of history or tradition. It is safe to toll you that General Devens has put more into the conmssariat of the ""Goyernor's House. already than he found in it. The house is gray stone house, neat, but not magnificent nor very large. The ensign Of the Union waves now from its flagstaff also.

 TIE ""nuBB'' OF THE REBELLION.

 The headquarters of rebeldom Were concen- trated all around this square, and it is striking fact that the first object which met the eyes of Jefferson Davis when he came out of St. Paul's church on Sunday, April ?. 1865, with news from Lee that all was lost, and he mus: leave i Richmond, was the statue of Washington. un- der which he had been inaugurated as presi- dent of the confederate states. February P, 1862.

 CAPITOL. SQUARE AND VICINITY.

 St. Pauls church. on Ninth street, was the church of President Davis, who is regarded here s.s sincerely deuout member of the Epis- copal communion. It is a large and comedy structule the congregation made up o{ the ''hest society of Richmond and the rector a German by birth, but long resident here. A good many notable funeral ceremonies have taken place in this church. including that of President Tyler, but the most notable of all in history will be the nasty ""carrYng out, feet foremost, of the ""snuthern contederacy"" by Jefferson Davis, on Sunday afternoon, April ? 1865!

 THE WAR DEPARTMENT.

 Beyond St. Pauls on Ninth street, and near Bank street, which forms the western boundary of the Capitol square, stood handsome brick building, now in smoking ruins, which was known before the wal as Mechanics Hall, and I has since been occupied as the rebel war de partment. The treasury offices were in the i'm 1 mediate neighborhood, and have also been des- troyed but half way down Bank street, and running through to Main street, the Richmond Broadway"" the state y granite building of the United States custom house still rears it's ma iestic proportions This is the finest building in Richmond, was completed just before the war broke out, and was appropriated by the rebel government soon alter they came to Richmond. to the various departments of their administrations The war and the treasury de partments eventually outgtew tbeir lodgings here. and the post office was established, under Mir. Reagan, in large building just below the custonl-house on Bank street, which has also fallen prey to the flames.

This will not, however, amount to much, for the general testimony is that all the important archives of the rebels were sent away several weeks ago, either to Lynchburg or to DaAyihe. | The probabilities are that Danvie was their destination. | The rebel cabinet ministers seem to have been comfortable in their way of living. Ben iamin, the secretary of state, who has left an enormous amount of unpopularity behind him, l cant exactly make out why-had fine house at the upper end of Main street, which has es- i capped the confagration.

 THE REBEL 'wHITE HOUSE.""

 Jefferson Davis house, as I have already said. is now the abode of Gen. Weitzel. It stands on the brow of Shockoe hill, at the foot of Twelfth street and Clay, and is in good con- dition, though rather shabby as to the exterior. The shutters are broken, and the gates of the garden swing all kinds of ways. The stables, too are planted directly beside the front door way which detracts very much from the ap- pearance and style of the mansion and all though it would be thought decent gentle mans house anywhere, it is by no means to be compared even with many of the houses in Richmond and it's immediate vicinity.

ST0NEMAN IN PURSUIT OF JEFF. DAVIS",,"CAIRO, May 8, 6P. M.-The following en-
braces all Of Importance in the dispatches
received here this afternoon.


New YORK May 9.-The Tribune's Wash
ington special says that one of the most pro-
tracted and important Cabinet sessions held
since Johnson has occupied the Presidential
chair was held at the Treasury to-day.


The subject matter of discussion was the
free trade question as regards the South.
It is understood that the whole system of
giving cotton and trade permits to a certain
class of fayorites was thoroughly ventilated
and denounced, although there was a de-
cided preponderance in favor of opening
to the Union authority.


1t is believed as the result of this pro-
tracted sitting that every facility will be
extended by the Government for all proper
commercial transactions and as u conse-
quence of this faith cotton permits are at a
heavy decline in this market tonight.


The address delivered to the President by
the delegation of the various Swiss residents
contained the hope that the glorious sue
Cesses of the Union will bear in the preser-
vation of all other sister republics on the
American continent. To the great aston
lshment and Indignation of the delegation,
the Acting Secretary of State, to whom the
copy of the address was communicated, pre-
vious to its delivery, struck out, as being
irrelevant the above mentioned paragraph.
The Tribune's special says Payne, the as
sassin of the Seward family, has made con-
| fession of his guilt. He said it was useless
for him to withhold longer. He had been
fully identified by six persons, and the Gov
ernment had other evidence in its possession
that he was the party assigned to that terri
bic crime.


The prisoners are closely guarded. Among
the precautions taken to prevent them from
committing suicide is the padding of their
heads with cotton, so that they cannot but
their brains out. This was suggested by the
attempt of Payne few days since


The Times's Washington special says the
preparation of the conspiracy cases for trial
has deVolved upon Col. Kennett, who con-
Quoted the proceedings in the treason cases
tried at Indianapolis. The ability displayed
by him in developing those cases com
mended him to the Government. He is
now sitting the mass of testimony in the
possession of the court.


KNOXVILLE, May 2, l0P. Authorization
from Stoneman's cavalry says: JEFF Davis
was ut YorkvilIe, S. c., on the 28th ult., and
Stoneman's forces came in the following day.


jeff Davis was one days start Of Stone
man. He is escorted by two thousand cav
airy, one thousand mounted, and command
ed by Gen. Debberen. He is accompanied
by Benjamin, Breckenridge and others, and
win probably be joined by al the despera-
does fleeing from justice, and from the ven
geance of the United States Government.


1t is hoped Stoneman's forces will over.
take and capture Davis, as he is burdened
with eleven wagons, supposed to contain
specie.


TORONTO, May S.-Cleary, one of the rebel
agents, against whom the grand jury found
true bill for a breach of the neutrality
laws afew days since, yesterday surrendered
himself and gave bail in $4,000 to stand
trial at the October session.


WASHINGTON, May 3.-Hon. B. G. Har-
ris, Representative in Congress from Mary
land, was arraigned for trial before gene
raj court martial in this city.


New YORK, May 3.-The Herald's CORE
spondent says the 9Th corps reached Dan
vile last Thursday, making The march of
over one hundred miles in four days. On
the route, and at Danville, large amount
of valuable property was captured, includ-
ing railroad stock and machinery stolen
from Harper's Ferry. It is ef fpected the 9Th
corps will remain at Danville come time.


Gen. Sheridan with his cavalry got as far
as near the Stanuton and Danville rivers,
but was ordeled to return on the surrender
of Johnston


Trains viii soon be running from Lynch
burg and Danville to Washington via Rich

free to 60 in any direction; but, instead Of re-
suming bis search for ""some sequestercd spot""
be forthwith returned to Richmond and to his
seat In that Congress Whyi Because during
his absence that Congress had undergone re-
volution-n had turned against the despotic
designs Of Davis; and becanse, from the move
ments Of General Sherman and the fall Of Fort
Fisher, there was . revolutionary commotion
in Richmond which promised to General Foote
successful and speedy issue, with resump-
tion Of bis labors for the overthrow Of Davis,
and in behalf Of negotiations for peace.


The extraordinary individual in this case
may go for what he Is worth. II is the incident
Of his return to the rebel Congress that serves
our purpose, as it marks the changed condi
tion of affairs at Richmond. General Foote
evidently thinks that great events are at hand;
that the day Of peace Is fast approaching, and
that 1t will be to his advantage to be in at the
downfall and political death of Davis. The
term ""servile"" win no longer apply to his two
houses of Congress. They denounce his incom-
potency; they meet his threats with defiance;
they are resolved to supplant him and to place
the destinies Of the ""confederacy"" In the hands
of man who will know what to do when fight
ing will only invite destruction. Davis has
been reduced by his troubles and disasters to
raging and senseless fanatic. He would arm
and liberate all the slaves within his lines; he
would risk the horrors Of servile revolt; he
would turn over the Southern States and people
as colonies and subjects Of England, France
and Spain; he would see them oil destroyed
and their homes given up to the flames rather
than yield to the penalties of his crimes by
submission to the Union. General Lee, on the
other hand, is an unselfsh soldier and man Of
cool reflection; and We regard the movement
Of the rebel Senate in his favor as movement
for submission and peace.


The test will probably come with the urgent
necessity for the evacuation or surrender of
Richmond. Rumors are again aioat of prepa-
tions for an evacuation, and the removal OF
the rebel concern-Davis, Cabinet and Con-
gress--under the escort Of General Lee, to some
safer place further south 1t is evident that
such an evacuation cannot be much longer de-
layed. Wilmington, if not already abandoned,
is no longer place to the rebels worth defend
ing; Sherman is heading in that direction, and
Grant is on the watch in front of Lee. The
game of the latter is blocked, except in re-
treat to Lynchburg or Danville; but in falling
back to either Of these places he will retire
only to the ""last ditch"" On the other hand, as
the abandonment Of the rebel capital by the
enemy must now inevitably complete the de-
moralization and confusion, and precipitate the
dissolution of the ""confedeacy,"" we shall not
be surprised If the peace party at Richmond
succeed in revolution, under the wing Of Gen.
Lee, which will save the honor Of his army and
yet secure the inevitable Union ultimatum Of
treaty Of submission and peace."

The Fond du Lac Press says that, in look
ing over a bundle of old newspapers, it found
the suhjoined extract in copy of the New

that some one in Tennessee had been burn~
ing an American citizen of African descent,
and the parson had essayed to defend the
proceeding:


1--WE are therefore not at all astonished to
find that certain fou -mouthed and blasphe-
nous fellow in Tennessee, whose name of
Brownlow is notorious, and who is preach
er of the religion of that part of the country.

thority of Judge Lynch. This kind of cre-
nation he considered to be sautary and in
strict accordance with the principles Of
christianity""


What notice for old 'parson Brownlow,'
who is now such pretended hater Of slave
ry. The old renegade sinner is but the type
of many less prominent preacher. The
fun of the thing, though is, that this ancient
notice should come from his now intimate

Ys, For four years past our North
ern brethrenD have been engaged in
the somewhat laborious work Of
whipping the South into the Union.
We should not be at all surprised if
they occupy the next four years in. IN q an
attempt to whip us out The signs
now point unmistakably in that direc-
tion, if the tone and language Of some,
ofthe Northern press, and the conduct
Of some Of their leading men, furnish
any criterion for a correct opinion.


Surely every Northern man who.
has one drop of the milk of human
kindness in his bosom, is already sa-
tiated with the wholesale destruction
Of property and life Of the people Of
the South. War carries with it the
punishment of the vanquishedj /; and
after it Is over, whatever is further
done blythe victorious party, to in
flict pain or suffering on those whom
they have overcome, is dictated only
by mean and pusillanimous spirit Of
revenge. This is clearly exemplifed
at the present time. The brave and
gallant officers and men of the North
ern army, 50 soon as toe war was
over, ''buried the hatchet,D and are
willing to renew friendship with the.
Southern people without further mo-
lestation to them, or the infiction Of
additional pain. 1t is only a few
civilians at the North who ""snuffed
the scent Of a battle from afar,n who
now, that the war is over, and the
Southern people lpowerless for resis-
tance, seek to wreak their vengeance
upon the defenceles. Verify, where
the lion ceases to prey, the wolf
prowls most ferociously. While the
brave and ma gnanimous have already
buried the hatchet, the cowardly and
pusillanimous are in favor Of direct
ing the keen edge Of the axe towards
hundreds Of thousands Of those whom
they dared not assist to overcome. -.

After the lecture, the Rev. Mr..
Lynch, whose address before the
Nashville Colored Convention so cleo
trified the country, took the floor, and
made good his reputation for oratory
by brief but telling speech. Mr..
Butler, the President of the Institute,
then introduced to the audience Mr..
John Needles, the white friend Of his
people for forty years past, with the
pointed remark that the Board of Di-
rectors felt as much honored by the
presence of this noble old man as
they would have been by that of the
President! And the sentiment was
warmly applauded.


~ TWO WHITE SPEECHES.


Your correspondent was then called
out, and he urged the colored people
OF Maryland to organize politically
and agitate for the right of suffrage,
which only needs a sufficient white
public opinion in its favor at their
back to secure them in it's exercise at
the State election of 1866, without
any change in the constitution. Mr..
Stockbridge, member of the aboli-
ton convention, was next called up,
and he made some effective remarks
upon the necessity Of the colored
people being true to themselves in
order to get their political rights.


A SPEECH FROM DOUGLASS.


These brief interludes served to

the revolted States to their orbits,
which, for fervid eloquence and
sledge- hammer logic, surpassed any
thing Of the kind / have ever heard.
He took the ground that the manhood

between Charlottesville and Bffalo, dist
ance OF more than forty miles, has been
destroyed. and much ofthe track torn up.
though the extent Of damage has not been
ascertained. The nearest approach they
made to Lynchburg was New Glasgow,
IL miles distant, where q small party of
them burned the railroad depot. On
""Wednesday party estimated at from
1000 to 5000 appeared at Bear creek,
supposed to be making for the south side
OF the James river. The fine bridge over
the river being burned on their approach,
they contented themselves with loud curses
upon our reserves, who were stationed on
the other side of the river. They burned
the boat of the James River company at
Bent Greek. They had captured four of
our scouts who were left in the hands of
an equal number of their troops, who,
being cut off from the main force by the
burning of the Tye river bridge, gave
themselves up to their prisoners, and were
brought to this city. The raiders burned
every mill they could find along the James
river, destroyed all the tobacco and tobac-
co houses, and carried away all the horses
and negroes they could lay their hands
upon. They shot about 300 of their bro
ken down horses on the plantation of W.
r. Cabell, below New Market, and took
off all the horses belonging to that gentle
man they could find. 1t is said that 800
Yankees crossed the river opposite Column
ba on Friday, but retreated to the north
side."

The Crisis nj Richmsmd-An Evacuation

The rshel Governor Of North c. rolina, Inn.
pressments having failed, sppeals 70 his 'fel-
low citizenJ' for-contributi0ns Of food or Lees
army. He sayA-""YOu are aware thst, N con-

months that army will have to rely for subsist-'
enoe upon North Carolina aad Virginia aloDe,
and am informed by the Commissary Depart
ment that the usual method Of collecting sup
plies (impressments) will be insufficient for the
purpose"" r


Here we find an adversary Of General Lee
against which all his elaborate triple lines of
Notifications will be utterly worthless He
must reopen his communications, or he must
evacuate Richmond, or he may be compelled to
capitulate from the pressure Of famine. He
is compelled now s'to rely for Subsistence
upon North Carolina and Virginia alone"" And
what have the people of those States to sparef
Between Sheridan and EARLY the fertile Shenan-
doah valley has been thoroughly cleaned out
the country east Of the Blue Ridge, from Lees
burg to Richmond, has been left exhausted and
desolate by the spoliations Of both armies. The
railway trains, freighted with tobacco, which
was sent up from the James river to Freder-
icksburg the other day, upon the hint that this
Virginia tobacco could there be exchanged for
Maryland bacon, tells the story. The only
part of Virginia which can still furnish General
Lee with something in the way Of supplies is
that section which lies to the west and south
west Of Richmond, extending thence to North
Carolina; and even those counties, VIC presume,
have been already pretty thoroughly drained
by the Danville and Lynohburg railroads.


North Carolina, we apprehend, is also re-
duced to a small surplus. She cannot have
much to spare, or General Lee, month ago,
would not have appealed to Georgia as the
only State capable of supplying his wants. The
seaboard section of North Carolina, in oc-
cupation Of the Yankees, can furnish him
nothing, and the surplus supplies OF
the interior, we guess, will find plenty
Of consumers in the different columns Of Joe
Johnston's forces from Wilmington, from South
Carolina and from Georgia; and what they cam
not eat or destroy will assist in feeding the
Union armies of Sherman and Schofeld. ""You
must choose between giving your supplies to
Lees army or having them taken by the
enemy,n says Governor Vance. But the North
Carolina farmer will be very apt to reason
after this fashion:-""Sherman' army Is coming.
It cannot be stopped. It must be fed. It will
not starve while there is subsistence in the
country. If give what I can spare of my
corn and bacon to General Lee, that which /
cannot spare will be taken by Sherman, and
must starve. Shall starve that Lee may hold
Richmond few days longerf No. We have
had enough of this. The game is played out""
The native cattle raisers in the wilds of Algeria
in estimating their yearly product, always allow
$50 much for the lion, which he must have""
So there is lion among the North Carolinians,
whose claims must be respected, whatever may
be the necessities Of General Lee. o.


The prospect, therefore, Of feeding his army
at Richmond for few months, or even few
weeks longer, from the supplies within his
reach in Virginia and North Carolina,
Is very slim. There Is the danger, too,
that Sheridan may interrupt Lees COM
munications with both Lynchburg and Dan
Vile; but, worse than all, there are the advanc-
ing columns Of Sherman and Schofeld, crowd
ing up towards Richmond an additional swarm
Of consumers, and still contracting and exhaust
ing their general field of supply. Thus the
alternative must speedily be chosen by Lee Of
q desperate effort to break through the lines Of
General Grant, or stealthy evacuation, or the
choice Of holding on until famine shall bring
him to surrender. Reduced to these extremi-
ties, we still incline to the opinion that the
rebels will abandon Richmond without fght
and that JEFF. Davis will lead of in the evacua-
tion."

dated Columbia, Virginia, March 10th, details
bis movements subsequent to the defeat Of
Early. Charlottesville was next occupied, and
two iron bridges over Rivanna river and
Morse's creek, near that place, we're DESTROYED.
Scottsville was then occupied and all mills,
James river canal, which Sheridan saws was
""the great feeder Of Richmond"" next received
attention. and every lock and in many places
the banks were destroyed to within fifteen miles
of Lynchburg. At New Canton, the guard
lock was destroyed, and the james river let
into the canal, causing great damage. The
bridges for ten miles on the Gordonsvlle Rail-
road were destroyed. Owing to the bad state
OF the roads, Sheridan's wagons detained him
greatly. Fourteen pieces of artillery, twelve
canal boats laden with supplies, ammunition,
rations, medical stores, etc. were among the
captures. Sheridan bad met with no opposi-
tion, but was unable TO cross the james river
Oh account of high water. Commodore Hollins,
of the rebel navy, was shot near Gordonsvile,
while attempting to make his escape from our
advance 10 that direction. Sheridan's next
move will probably be upon Lees communica-
tions with North Carolina.


The rebel Bragg claims to have achieved
great victory over the Union column under
Schofeld, moving from Newbern, y. c., to
cooperate with Sherman. He claims to have
captured three pieces of artillery and l,500
prisoners. The fight took place near kipston.
A Washington dispatch gives very different
version of the affair, and says the enemy were
elated with the capture OF two or three small
guns aud line Of shirmishers. The rebels
made several reckless charges. but we're repulsed
each time with heavy loss, losing 200 prisoners.
The fight occurred on the 9th inst Our forces
were well entreDched three miles from kinston,
and General Schofeld remained in the field
with Generals Couch and Cox, giving instruc
toDs. A renewal Of the struggle was expected
to be made soon A rebel ram was placed in
the Neuse river at knston, to protect the
bridge at that place.


The Richmond papers give an account of
a skirmish between Sherman's and Hampton's
cavalry, at u point not named, in which the
rebel Colonel Aiken was killed, and Hampton's
Adjutant General wounded. A rebel officer
from South Carolina says Sherman completely
devastated that portion of the State through
which he passed. Some of Shermans foragers
having been captured and then murdered, he
notified Wade Hampton that he would retalia-
ate. in reply to which the latter details rebel
grievances, and threatens more retaliation.


The negro enlistment act has finally passed
the rebel Congress, though protested against

ish the World""",,"Ric Lee About to ssAston-
ish the WOrld.''


We have the rumor from the neighborhood Of
Petersburg that General Lee Is engaged in
shipping of certain heavy war materials from
Richmond, as If he meditated an early evacua-
ton Of that delectable city. We presume that
II on any fine morning now General Grant
should discover that his bird had flown he
would not be much surprised, and would know
where to look for him. But we are admonished
by one Of the rebel sympathizing journals Of
this city that General Lee is preparing for .
grand offensive enterprise, and that in its de-
velopment he will ""astonish the world""


What can it bei The present condition Of
the Virginia mud roads, and the scarcity of
supplies in the Shenandoah valley, repel at
once the idea Of another raid into Maryland.
Lee has hardly the necessary water transporta-
ton 70 rush down the James river and make ON
attack upon Fortress Monroe, and II he should
move directly southwark, for the purpose Of
securing Wilmington as the last loopbole Of
escape for JEFF. Davis, or in order to ""gobble
up"" the army Of Sherman, that tenacious man
VI W0Iy uCuCLui uIuAt, WlA uuuOuOscuiy plhy
the winning card in the game. Yet we think II
very probable that Lee is meditating upon the
dangers that are thickening around him, and
upon the expediency Of providing for a retreat
before every avenue Of supply or escape shall
be cut of. In this view of the subject, what
route Is he most likely to take in search of the
""happy valley Of Rasselass""


We guess that he will make for Danville, q
thrifty manufacturing town ON the Dan river
close 10 the North Carolina border, about one
hundred and thirty miles southwest from Rich
mond, and two hundred miles inland from the
nearest point on the main seacoast. The Dan
river, rapid, rocky and abounding In
falls, 10 not navigable for gunboats
while It's productive valleys, with those Of the
Staunton river, the other main branch Of the
Roanoke, would still furnish 70 Lees army
abundant supplies for several months, though
cut OF from all other resources. In the next
place, should remnant Of Hoods army escape
from Thomas, u can be brought over TO Lee q,
Danville much more readily than to Richmond
considering the damage done 10 the roads
bridges supply depots, &C., by stoneman and
3urbridge along the valley Of the railway which
leads up from Southwestern Virginia 70 Lynch
burg.


We Incline 10 the conclusion, therefore, tina
this projected movement Of General Lee whicl
lie to ""astonish the world"" Is the transfer Of hi
army, his ordnance, magazines, machinery an'
military stores, and the rebel capital, inoludin
JEFF. Davis, his Cabinet, Congress, archives an

about by the rebellion has not only emanci-
pated the negro, but it has given liberty Of
speech and freedom to the press in oil that
section. For the period of thirty years and
more the man south of Mason and Dixon's line
who ventured to speak, print or circulate any
thing in favor Of abolition did it at the peril Of
his life. Nay, hint thrown out against a
stranger that he was an abolitionist was sufi.
cient to bring down upon him the savage
penalties Of Judge Lynch. From Delaware to
the Gulf of Mexico freedom Of speech and Of the
press was by Southern opinion and mob law
hanging, scourging, jails, tar and feathers
restricted on the slavery question to the de-
fence of the institution. These rules and regu-
lations were at last carried to such extremities
that Northern men liable to suspicion, in travel
ling South, had to 60 provided with certia-
cate from some well known Southern man or
supporter of Southern rights"" that he was
""sound on the goose"" in order to travel with
out further molestation than the inspection of
his pass, bg the inevitable squad Of loafers at
the Southern cross-road Post Office or grocery.


This, in full blast, was the condition Of
things throughout the slave States at the break
ing out of the rebellion. The deluge which has
since rolled over those States has swept all
those old things away, and buried them among
the fossils Of the antediluvian epoch. From
Maryland to the Gulf of Mexico the negro is
free, speech Is free, and the press Is free.
William Lloyd Garrison and Henry Ward
Beecher have been received as lions in Charles
ton, where even six months ago their pre-
sence would have been the signal for hang
ing match, without judge or jury. Southern
newspapers with Northern principles are
sprInging up along every trail Of the
victorious armies of the Union. Cheva-
lier Forney, for instance, with all his other
irons In the FIRE, Is about to establish
new political journal, of the gospel according to
Forney, In Richmond-that city Of ruins, ashes,
sepulchres, human bones, doleful chivalry,
bustling Yankees and swarming free negroes.
On the other hand, Richmond already rejoices
ia a new journal, called the Times, the stripe
and calibre of which may be judged from the
fact that it finds the Hon. Ben Wood model Of
penetration and political wisdom, according to
the antediluvian Southern platform of State
rights.


The press is at last free In the South, and
men and women Of oil colors may now, down
South, speak, write or print freely upon all
subjects within the limits Of decorum. Wendell
Phillips need no longer con6ne his labors in
behalf Of negro suffrage 10 the North. He may
60 down to Richmond, Charleston or Mobile,
and speak by the day, or establish q paper In
support Of his principles The women's rights
women, Bloomers, spiritualiss and communists
of all sorts, may likewise try their reforms in
the new and ample fields OF the ""sunny South""
The war has certainly left It's numerous widowed,
fatherless and impoverished women throughout
the South in a condition which appeals strongly
to their strong-minded, philanthropic sisters of
the North. They are free to 60 down in behalf
of womcn's rights, even TO the extent Of the
right Of suffrage. Why mott Are we not In

The Rebel Press ON the Wharf.-The Real


Situation.


The rebel press Of this city still puts forth
the poor trash Of Vallandigham's Chicago reso-
luton, twisting It day aftsr day into countless
ridiculous shapes ""The war b failurep
The NsDs cites the various expeditions Of ths
wear; declares, without any regard to the fActs
or 70 truth, that each was unsuccessful, and
then gives the whole - @argument"" that the
war Is failure. Il bears heavily, Of course,
ON tho fAilures Of Banks In Louisiana, and
Glasses Grants Virginia campaign in the Same
category. Il also GLASSES Sherman with Hunter.
They are failures every ONE. Sheridan's
splendid movement up the valley, with victo-
ries at Opequan, Fishers Hill and Cedar Creek,
was also failure, considered ""as movement
against Lynchburg.r We may inform the Nssos
that It was failure in smother way namely,
as an attempt to cut the Equator and move
against the South pole. Hood and Thomas are
not named, but there is great deal about the
battle of Olustee in Florida. In all this rigma-
role there is not the least reference to the real
military situation as it now is; not word
of the position Of Sherman without an oppo-
nent. Of Thomas at the heels Of Hood, or Of the
real centre ofall- Grants position on the James


Richmond is the vital point, and Lee, Its de-
fender, is held there by Grant, and compelled
to stand helplessly and wait while Grant COM
pletes his minor arrangements at other points
and gets all ready for the final blow. Before
Grant put matters in that position Lee was
very great general, who was able to throw OF
our little generals as they came at him one by
one, and in the intervals had time enough to
send men hither and thither to turn the scale
against our forces at all other points But, alasl
for Lee, we have changed all that This reminds
us Of q story. We have seen this whole history
change and all-rehearsed on our back piazza,
where the sun shines pleasantly even on these
wintry days. That pleasant sunshiny piazza
was the especial domain Of Nep-the big
Newfoundland dog-who was all the time
such Turk that he would have ""no brother
near the throne"" The piazza in all Its length
and breadth was as much sacred to Nep as
was the space around Richmond TO Lee. There
he lay all day and drowsed there he walked
up and down at his ease thence he opened his
deep throat at the distant passer by, and thence
he went to his dinner, only to return there when
the dinner was over Wo to the pointer, the
setter, the beagle or to the two terriers If thcy
ventured any intrusion on that ""sacrcd SOIL""
But bulldog was added to the number. He
was as good natured as any. He did not know
about Nep's territory, however, and he Gin
vaded"" it; for he liked sunshine, too. Nep
tried the usual game, and certainly rather sur
prised the bulldog by his weight and the sud-
denness Of the onset But the bulldog woke
up, a. bulldogs do, and thcn thore was row.
There was full argument Of the case and the
result was that the bulldogs ivories were
planted SO deeply and SO tenaciously into Nep's
throat that 1t required the Interference, u ct
aynsis, Of every person about the place to get
the ivories out, and then the application Of all
restorative remedies to keep the Newfoundland
alive. sr


That is the real state Of the case between
Grant and Lee. Lce hustled every one away
easily till the real fighter came, and now there
he is and the real fighter has him by the throat,
on his own piazza, and will hold him there and
kill him there; for in this case there is no one
TO interfere. Hood cannot be brought around
to get the ivories out, for his army is broken to
pieces. No new army can be raised to give
new life, for Sherman occupies the country that
it might have been raised in; and SO the dog
must die and in Grants own time he will die,
and nothing can prevent it


The Proposed Reduction OF the Duty ON


Paper.


There is movement on foot to induce Con-
gress to repeal the duty on paper. This move
ment originates out West and with the editors
of republican papers. Some time ago num-
Der Of these editors-principally Of Chicago and
St Louis papers-met and made their arrange
ments in the usual way to influence Congress
on this subject. They adopted resolutions,
appointed committees, delegates, and 80 en-.
Their resolutions denounced the duty as oner-
ous to publishers and not beneficial TO the
Treasury; and their committees and delegates
were sent around to influence the press at large,

tial persons, and in all ways to make a. much

5.spatches of preceding events:
New York, April 6.-The Hsrald's
correspondence from the late mansion of
Jeff. Davis at Richmond says:-The
evacuation of that city was seriously
contemplated several days before it took
pace but ths decision was not arrived
At until Sunday afternoon last, when
Lee telegraphed to Davis that Grant had
rendered the holding of the city by him
impossible. The telegram was read in
the churches, and the departure of the
leading rebels commenced at once, and
was continued through the night. jeff.
Davis left at p. IN. for Danville, and it
is understood the government archives
were sent to that place and Milton. n. G.
The city was fired by Gen. Ewell, and,
although Gen. Weitzel on reaching the
city endeavored to subdue the flames,
one-third of the city was destroyed.
Among the buildings burned were the
War Department, Post Office, Treasury
Department, several churches, two banks
and three newspaper offices.


Ii was understood to have been Lees
design to sndeavor to reach Danville,
Va, and there fortify and make another
stand. This plan Sheridan's movements
have frustrated, and Lee is now endeay-
oring to get to Lynchburg.


The Herald's correspondent says:


Davis received Lees dispatch to evac-
vts while in church. Davis left in the
first train. He escaped with lis horses
and carriage, so as to take TO the eoun-
try in case the road is Interrupted He
expressed himself as being yet determin-
ed not 10 give up, though it was certain
he had but little hope left.


Extra Billy Smith did not leave till
after midnight. He left his wife behind
as also did Gen. Lee. The news of the
death of her SON, W. IL +. Lee, in the
battles has been received.


The Legislature was in session as late
s9 o'clock, when they started for Co.
iumbia by the canal and y James river.


Breckenridge left the city as late as
SEQ Monday morning.


A large number of rebel officers were
edpLuI6u anu pdIOleO.


The Worlds special from Richmond

y the lower part of main street. The
toba go warehouses, storehouses, the ole
Bank of Virginia Building and newspa
per offices were destroyed. Higher VI
on main street many of the best shops
were in flames. Lower down the rive

The Certainty OF Oar Triumph-The


Effect OF Our Success In Enrope.


The absolute certainty Of our success is the
present feature Of the military situation. Do
what be may there b mot the least chance that
the enemy can change the result Every pos
sibility Of the military situation leads to the
Same end-rebel ruin and national triumph.
No. manipulation Of the pieces can show any
other close for the grand game Four develop
mens Of the struggle are regarded as possible.
Lee may stand still, concentrate on his present
position the forces under Beauregard, Hardee
and Bragg, and fight II out in the last ditch
style where he is. He may concentrate all the
for es In North Carolina at Raleigh, reinforce
them with column from his immediate COM
mand, and strike ut Sherman. He may con-
centrate his three detached columns at Lynch
burg, join them there and endeavor to prolong
the struggle at that point, embarrassing us by
the necessity of . long line. He may concen-
trate at Richmond, and bide his time for an ad-
vance down the valley. The first development
is the most probable. Lee is chained to Rich
mond, as Prometheus was to his rock Moral
and physical reasons of the most imperative
nature forbid him to give it up. 1t is his last
arsenal, his last workshop, his last foundry,
and it is the last home and hope Of his cause.
He cannot even risk it to reinforce the troops
in front Of Sherman; for, il II is bad to leave it,
it would be worse to lose 1t by force of arms


But il he stays there to make his final fight, let
him make it as stubbornly as he will, he must
inevitably be beaten, as Grant, Sherman, Sheri-
dan and Schofeld close in on his lines, cut off
his supplies and overwhelm him with numbers.
This, like all similar operations, is question
Of time. II he concentrates near Raleigh q
force Of sixty, eighty, or hundred thousand
men-n he puts his whole available force in
front Of Sherman-Sherman, reinforced by
Many regard this development asprobable, and
hold that . large part Of Lees army Is In readi-
ness to move for this purpose. If Lee goes to
Lynchburg he increases the decentralization Of
his army and exposes himself to all the chances
Of an open campaign on new theatre. In that
campaign he viii be matched against two Of
the greatest masters Of strategy that have arisen
in this age, and there win be against him an
overwhelming preponderance Of numbers. Both
reasons are also against movement down the
valley and against that toward Sherman. Either
would be sufficient Lee cannot cope with
Grant and Sherman II even he had equal force.
But the disparity Of force is inevitably fatal.
The great Napoleon maintained with the ut
most positiveness that, though chance, audacity
or genius might enable an inferior force to
triumph on the field Of battle, II was never SO
in extended strategic operations. In these, in
a whole campaign, numbers handled with any
thing like equal skill win always prevail. We
may with perfect safety accept that opinion as
definitive in the present case.


This absolute certainty Of success is due in
the greatest measure to our many recent
triumphs. II would have been premature to
argue such success against all contingencies be-
fore we had taken Wilmington and shut out the
possibility of foreign assistance, or before 1t had
been demonstrated that Sherman could sweep
across South Carolina as easily as he did across
Georgia. But now it is seen that there is only
Lee to face both our great leaders, and Fort
Fisher, Wilmington, Charleston, Branchyjlle
and Columbia are so many pieces Of hand
writing on the wall that tell the enemy's doom.
Those victories have shown us the certainty Of
our triumph but what will be their effect in
Europei What will Napoleon say to these de-
monstrations Of our power What will be their
press has, through four years, attempted to
""write us down."" and insisted upon the foolish
absurdity Of supposing that we could succeed
We believe that the result will be hardly less
than revolutionary in both countries. In France
our victories viii announce the doom Of tina,
Mexican empire that Napoleon is committed
to, and in England they will cause an immense
reaction In public sentiment Every lie told
against us in the last four years will help thai

sanguinary in the history Of mankind, we
naturaly recur to the causes and the instisa-
tors of this unhappy struggle. We see that the
causes underlying and cropping out on all
sides were slavery and the political agitation
Of the slavery question, North and South; that
The trouble commenced in the convention
which adopted The constitution Of the United
States, and that The trainers of that instrument
for the sake OF the Union, had to transmit that
trouble to their posterity, in being compelled
to enter into compromise on slavery, which
included among other concessions, even the
adoption of the African slave trade for term
of twenty years.


Under this compromise the country pros
percd, passed triumphantly through another
war with England, and had rest from any vio-
lent agitation of slavery for thirty years.
But then the question OF the admission
of Missouri as slave State convulscd
the nation, and threatened very serious
consequences, till Henry Clay Gained tho
troubled waters with the oil of his famous Mis-
souri compromise. But twenty years later the





of Banquo to frighten US at our feast over the
territorial spols conquered from Mexico, when
again new compromise from Henry Clay, in
Guiding the Missouri compact, gave us another
term of peace This adjustment would, per-
haps, have lasted for twenty or thirty years had
not poor Pierce, in 1854. four years after It's
adoption, under the influence OF jeff Davis,
Ill III. :.lo O., hon
democratic leaders, brought about, as a Presi-
Dental party measure, the repeal of the Missouri
compromise. This was the opening Of Pandora's
box; this act, which tore tho democratic party
to pieces, cast it out Of power and rapidly,
under their disunon leaders, hurried the bulk
of the Southern States headlong into the faith
omless abyss Of the rebellion. That Kansas
Nebraska bill lifted the curtain, and the open
ing scenes of the sanguinary drama Of civil
war which has followed were played in Kansas.


In all this business heavy responsibility at-
taches to the democratic party; and it has been
feariully punished for its treachery to itself and
tho country. But behind the old democratic
party, and controlling 1t to its destruction, wo
find The real elements Of this mischief in the
Southern slavery propaganda; just as we find
the elements which destroyed the old whig
p.rty in the Northern radical abolition faction.
Tho whig party courted the Northern aboli-
tionists for their support, and it was destroyed
by Southern reaction; the democratic party
truckled so bascly to the Southern pro-slavery
re-eaters that it was literally torn to pieces by
Northern convulslon. These discrganizing aboli-
tion and proslavery sectional factions were
started into life with the establishment of the
first Northern abolition journals, over thirty
years ago. But what with the tariff, notification,
the national bank, internal improvements, the
financial revulsion .of 1887 and other leading
questions, the power Of the abolitionists as
political faction was not made manifest until
the year 1874, on the Texas question, when, by
strange Inconsistency, fifteen thousand aboli-
ton wings, in voting for Birney, the first regular
abolition Presidential candidate, defeated
Henry Clay and elected Polk. We may now
trace to those fifteen thousand stupid abolition
votes all the troubles that have followed to the
country.


From that day commenced the active demo-
ralizanon of the two great national parties then
in the foreground-the whig party from its Jug
Cling affiliations with the Northern abolitionists
and the democratic party from its servile con-
cessions to the Southern pro-slavery fre-eaters.
Disunion was the political war cry of both
these disturbing factions ""No union with
shareholders"" shouted the Northern abolition
lists. ""Our rights under the constitution, or dis
union,"" shouted the Southern fire-eaters. Abo-
litionists and re-eaters played into each others
hands. On the one side fugitive slaves, in vio-
la.ion of the constitution and the laws, were
systematically spirited away, and their recovery
resisted in all sorts of petty annoyances; on the
other side abolitionists, by mob law, were sys-
tematically tarred and feathered when caught
south of Mason and Dixon's line, and were not
at all times exempt from lynching by the rOughs
Of the Northern democracy. These acts Of law
lcssness and violence on both sides, by aboli-
tionists and Southern disunionists, in due time
widencd the bitterness Of feeling North and
South into sectional organization of parties,
no slavery and pro-slavery, and we need not
repeat the consequences.


What we want now is final settlement with





slavery question and The negro question. The
war has killed Southern slavery. Let II be
buried and put out Of the wny as soon as posi-
ble It ends the slavery agitation. But there is yet
something left for abolition capital in the negro
agitation. Against this demand that as slavery
is abolished, and that as the African race have
powerfully assisted us in putting down the
rebellion and in saving the life Of the nation,
they should have share in the political right
of the ballot box, what valid objection con be
mades We cannot long resist this demand in
view Of the extinction Of slavery and the SER
vices of the Southern blacks during this war
With every opportunity and in every way
they have been our faithful allies. We
have had two hundred and fly thousand
of them In the service of the army"

The Bullstin's Washington special says
letter, dated near Kingston, March 10,

that on the day before, the 9th, Bragg
again attacked Cox's forces, making two

with heavy loss to the enemy. Rutgers
division I'd Corps, captured one piece Of
artillery and 200 prisoners. The enemy
left the field in confusion, and all their
killed and wounded fell into our hands.


Gen. Couches' Division, from Whining
ton, communicated with General Cox last
night from Beaver Dam, point he had
just reached, which is eight miles from
Gen. Cox's headquarters. Gen. Couch
joins Gen. Cox's forces this morning,
which indicates q battle to-day. The en-
emy show signs of weakness, and will
doubtless fall back to the other sideof the
Neuse River, and make q stand at King

Der from $4,000 TO 25,o0o. A rebel

Information from the Army Of the Po-
tomac as late Is yesterday morning re-
ports all quiet. Desorters are constantly
coming in, and aro moro numerous than
for a long time. They have averaged
over seventy . day for the past week,
among them several officers. The ut
most dependency prevails through their
ranks since the late fight, and they seem
determined TO keep the field no longer, as
they claim they can never gain their In
dependence, and see no reason why they
should remain and be killed. They all
say that deserving is so general to the
rear OF their own lines that Lee has is
sued an order to arrest every man found
half a mile away from his camp Or post.
One man said his company was thirty
strong, week ago, but that fifteen had
disappeared since--ten TO the United

The fall Of Fort Fisher is working rev.
olution in the minds Of the people Of this
State, which, if there is any meaning in
half of the threats emanating from the
State Capital, must result in the separa-
tion of North Carolina from the Confed-
eracy soon after Raleigh is garrisoned by
the Union forces, which is the necessary
protection required by the conservative
party, majority Of whom, says rebel
paper favor emancipation. The enemy
are removing their supplies from Will
mingion with view, it is thought, Of
evacuating the city. It's estimated that
there is over $l6O,Oo0,0Oo worth Of cot
ton stored from Wilmington along the
line Of the railroads reaching into South
Carolina and the southern part of North
Carolina, which the enemy will ordered
to bo burned as soon as our forces ap-
proach.

Thomas a. Smyth -


FRIDAY.


Friday morning dAwned and found th
enemy again on the wing toward Farmyll
and Appomaitox, ,Court-Ilouse. Again tn
lur3ui was resumed and again we struc
the rear Of the enemy at High Bridge
where the SonthsIde Railroad crosses tn
AppomattoX The river at this point i
about 100 leet ia width, and is spanned b.
two bridges one the railroad structur
enbuniely constructed and OF great height
and ihe o,hor an ordinary bridge for th
passage Of vehicles. Both wore fred OF

The High Bridge destroyed before ou
advance, consisting of Barlow's Division
were nble to eXtnguish il.


10 insure tho complete destruction ol
these bridges, Muhone's Division had re
manned behind on the other side, where
forming in battle line, it prepared to dispute
our further pursuit,


A sharp engagement ensued from either
side Of the stream on the arrival of Barlow
and the enemy still doggedly holding his
position, II light battery of Miles's Division
VIVA brought up and posted on the eastern
bank Of the river its fro soon compelling
theNlirement Of the Rebel Malone.


The crossing Of the Second Corps was
then made, and, covered by skirmishers, we
again advanced toward Farmville. In the
ADVANCE the brigade of Gen. Smyth led the
van, and from the High Bridge to l'armville
were constantly engaging the enemy, who
as lis chances of escape grow fainter fought
the more desperately, and only retired
when charged impotuously.


FALL or GEN sNYTG.


1t was about three miles from Farmville,
whore, with the flush ofvictory on his cheek,
and the shout OF triumph still ringing on his
hps that Gen. Smyth fell mortally wounded
while leading in person his skirmish line
against the enemy. And here the reader

derstanding that the latter, as Supreme Die
totor, would make last desperate effort with
such resources as are left within his control.


All kinds of provisions are bringing fabu-
lous prices in Richmond. Every male
inhabitant Of the city, capable of bearing
arms has been pressed into the service.
New York, 2lst-Thc Herald's City Point
correspondent says Sheridan reached White
House on the 10Th. lie lost only so men
and 2 officers. Nearly 200 negroes came
with him. He had to turn back large num-
| bers. being unable to feed or protect them
Latterly, however, he could do better, as the
negroes managed to procure their own food
on the march.


Washington, 2lst.-Sheridan is supplied
at White House with everything he needs for
future movements. Army of the James still
idle


Baltimore, 2lst.-Steamer Europa arrived
at Washington, bringing Major Compton and
dispatches from Sheridan He also brought
Il rebel flags cap;ered by Sheridan during
his raid, of which he captured himself from
Early's headquarters. Sheridan was at
White House on Sunday last, but commence
ing to move towards James river, where he
probably has arrived.


Fortress Monroe, 20th.-By mail we learn
that Sheridan's troops are in the very best
co-dition. They appear to have suffered little
or nothing in their long march from Win

QUEER CASE AND BAD FIx.-Undoubtedly
in wars such as we now have on hand many
more such cases as the following occur than
we hear of. The Altoona Pa, Tribune
of the Sth, says:


Itappears that with one of the companies
organized in this place, (for the nine months
service,) in the Summer of 1862, went man
who left wife and small family On the
bloody field of Antietam he fell, was buried.
and his wife afterwards had his body disin.
tered and brought home, and re-nterred in
the soldiers lot in the cemetery


A year afterwards she married again, and
in due time child was born, the fruit of
the second marriage. When the call for
/ 500 900 troops was being filled up. last Fall.
the second husband enlisted and is now in
| the army. A short time since. the first
| husband returned, alive and we'll, having
been taken prisoner at Antietam instead of
being killed. He had been held by the
rebels until the late exchange at Savannah.
OF course the parties are in a queer fix but
all will agree that the soldier who was once
killed, twice buried, starved two years in a
rebel prison, and yet came home alive, is
certainly entitled to his wife. Truth is
stranger than fiction The query is, who
was buried in the cemetery?'

The Impending Downfall Of Jcn. Davis


Probable Evacuation or Richmond.


The two houses of the rebel Congress have
made short work of the late special message Of
JEFF Davis Of all his budget of proposed alb
soiute powers, they have granted him only the
suspension Of the habeas corpus, and have made
haste to adjourn. They are no longer in the
mood for the discussion Of impracticable
schemes and empty distractions Each man
has the more important business Of his own
safety to look after. II is probable that by
this time, excepting the Virginia delegation,
the members of Jef.s disbanded Congress have
left for parts unknown; and that the railroads
and common highways leading off towards
panville and Lynchburg are lined with the
moving non-combatants Of Richmond and
Petersburg.


This general exodus Of all useless consumers
would be demanded by the shortness Of Lees
supplies, whether stripping for fight or pre-
pairing for an evacuation. The recent restric-
tions imposed by Longstreet in the exchange
of newspapers, the consequent difficulties of
getting any papers from Richmond, the evident
uneasiness OF General Lee, and the suspicious
activity in his lines, as if preparing for heavy
battle, all taken together with the critical dam
gers of his situation, justify the presumption
that, if not already moving off his stores, artil-
lcry and materials of war, he is preparing for
a stealihy departure


Left to his own judgment, General Lee would
doubtless elect to make fight for Richmond,
so that, in the event Of finding the odds too
heavily against him, he might at least claim
the honors of a respectable capitulaticn. But
the intractable Davis Is manifestly determined
to keep the fold while he can hold the frag-
mcnts Of IN army together. He has, per-
haps, made the discovery that while
Richmond cannot be held by Lee against
he concentrating forces of General Grant,
tho wisest course il to withdraw in time, in
order to save Lees army. Thus Hardee, when
he found that Sherman was fanking him, pulled
up stakes and abandoned Charleston in order
to escape the fate of Pemberton at Vicksburg.


AS the opposing armies now stand we are
drawn to these onclusions:-First, that as the
evacuation Of Richmond by General Lee with
out fight may enable him to effect junction
with Joe Johnston at Danvilc, and hold the
field for some lime longer, this is the course
which is most likely to be adopted under the
influence of JEFF Davis still apparently pre-"

ASorHER IMPORTANT DECISION FROM ATTORNEY GENkRA-


BOwDKS.


Tho following papers explain themselves, and sivs
them with the renaSk that they rst find their way inh
print through tho COLUMNS Of the HERALD:-
RIcHMoND, July IS, 1866
THOMAS R. Bowprs EY, Attorney General Of VIZ
sRThe question is frequsnty asked whether persons
who held office under tho socaed Confederate or any
rebellious State government ase eligible TO offce


Please give me your opinion on the subject


+. II. PIERPOINT, Governor of Virginia


RIcHxorD, Va, July H. 1885,
Hon r. H. PrERPorr, Governor of Virginia.


SrR-Your note Of the 18th instant inquirng whether
persons who held Office under the socaed Confederate
any rebeous State government are eligible 70 county
offices has been received.


am Of opinion that such persons not eligible -
The first section Of Article Ill or the constitutes
proydes that No person shall vote or hold Office under
this constitution who has held Office under the socaee
Confederate government under any rcbellious Stam
government who has been member OF the socailed
Confederate Congress, member OF any Spate
Legislature in rebellion against the authority OF the
United States excepting thorefrom county officers""


There are county offices which are ohces under thf
constitution Under the provision cited all persons en-
braced therein prohibited from holding constitutions
In this prohibition are not included such persons
have heretofore held county offices under any re-
beous State government regard TINS as ne r,M ,se m
mainly employed In describing the classes OF persons
who shall not hold Office. have therefore construed
the words excepting therefrom county of1cers 80 as
to accord with the general intent OF the provision not q
meaning that persons holding office Under the
government &C. could be elected to county Offices but
s meaning that all persons who have been mere county
officers may hold constitutional once One VI IVY
interpretations must be given 70 ne sec'In ION ~
either first limit the eligibility OF all the classes
mentioned to mere county offices; or, secondly 70 OK
cude all the classes mentioned, save county omcels,
from eligibility to any Office, and to confer on mere
county officers the right to be elected to any position,
whether county Office or otherwise. am clearly W
the opinion that the latter the true intention.


Tho contrary construction OF the section would 90 a.
tended with many anomoes Firstnt pn, womu pD,'n ~
bold a county office, when by the terms OF the article
originally adopted, and as IT stood until recenuy
amended he could not vote for another person ior inc
office ,
second-County officers Of merely local and limited
jurisdiction would be placed under the same ban with
tn highest officers Of the socaed Confederate or rebel
lious State government. III.


Again. as have already said, tho section in question
mainly employed in describing the classes of persons
eligible to Office. This construction accords with tno
general intent e. 1t construes the words excepting
therefrOm county officers decipG pe,s0nd' ssD ane
indicating the Offices to which the proscrlbeo
classes are, notwithstanding Their prescription, eligible


The opinion l am giving refers merely TO constsu-
tional Offices As TO such Offices not created ~

fight occurred at Liberty Mills, on the Rap
idan, in which the rebels were defeated. -
Arriving within two miles of Gordonsyille
that place was found to be strongly defend
ed, reinforcements having arrived from Rich

Washington, 2Sth, 1920 P. a.-The fol
lowing is from Richmond papers of to day :
The latest official advices from Georgia in
dicate that Sherman has captured and fol-
lowed up the occupation of Savannah by
sending force of cavalry, artillery and in
fantry on an expedition whose destination
can be guessed at from direction in which it
has moved These troops are reported to
have gone toward the Altamaha river. We
shall no doubt next hear they have crossed
that stream and are moving to southwest
Georgia in quest of prisoners Of war sup
posed to be at Andersonvile. Sherman's
programme for his grand campaign north
ward seems to be no secret He will start
from Port Royal and move straight upon
Branchville, South Carolina, the point of
junction between the Georgia and South

A Lynchburg paper has following: Addi-

Bristol. We learn that the place was held
by 200 reserves under Col. Preston, most of
whom escaped capture. The works were but
little damaged. We understand that persons
who have visited them since occupying by

 in skirmishing on the evening of the 7th inst

 and continued on different portions of tn,

 lines, with occasional interruptions, night ane

 day, up to the evening of the 10th, being a

 times of the most stubborn character. Gen

 Kinston. on the morning of the l1th. In $

 charge made by the rebels on the 10th they

 weresrepulsed with severe loss, and compelled

 to leave their killed and wounded on the field

 Gen. Couch's division of Uaion troops joined Gen. Cox on the morning of.the llth irstaat

 and it was thought that another battle mig Il take place onsthat day, though there were in

 dications that Bragg would fall back to ths

 north side 1.-the Mouse river. During the en

He intended to cross the James at Dugurdsville, doubtless to strike the Southside Railroad, but the rebels destroy. ed the bridges. In the meantime, another di- vision moved down the direct railroad from Charlottesville toward LYnchburgh as far as Amherst, running the road as far as they went, burning and breaking down agfeat many large bridges.

incidents of the Occupation of Richmond


The Tribune's Washington special SAYS
Gov. Pierpont is endeayoring to obtain per.
mission to establish himself at Richmond
and assemble the Legislature of loyal Vir-
ginia.


Mr.. Green, who was banished from Rich.
mond for Union sentiments returns there
as United States Postmaster. The mails
will be regularly forwarded from Washing
ton.


No appointment of Postmaster at Rich.
mond will be made until the return of the
Postmaster General.


The Tribunes special from Richmond on
the Sd gives an account Of the occupation of
that city. The second brigade, third di-
vision of the twenty-fourth corps, Gen. Rip
ley, advanced up town, Major Gen. Weitzel
and staff leading the column. A detach-
ment went to meet the Mayor, from whom
the General received the keys of the public
buildings. The Army of the James then
marched into the rebel capital, meeting with
no opposition whatever. Our army was
greeted with enthusiastic cheers by the
people.


An inspection of the rebel works disclosed
the fact of their having left in great haste.
In some officers headquarters was found
their private correspondence.


Gen. WeitZel issued an order making Gen.
Shipley Military Governor who issued an
order calling upon the citizens to aid in
putting out the fire: and referring them to
the Presidents proclamation for a DISPOSE
ton Of their rights and duties.


The rebel rear guard retreated in the d.
rection of Lynchburg only few moments
before our advance entered the town. The
main body OF the enemy commenced the re-
treat at about 10 O'Clock the preceding Sun
day. Their destination is believed to be



JEFF. Davis remained in the city till dark
Sunday night, having sent his family to
Charlotte, n. c., some time during the pre-
ceding week.


Gen. Weitzel finds much suffering among
the people; the rich as well as the poor are
destitute OF food. He is about to issue sup
plies to all who take the oath. The inhab-
itants now number 10000, half of whom are
Africans.


All the members Of Congress escaped.
Hunter has gone home. Carson Smith went
with the army. Judge Campbell remains
here.


All the vessels are destroyed, except an
unfinished ram which has her machinery
The Tredegar works are un-
harmed, and the machinery today under
Gen. WeitZefs orders. Libby Prison and
Castle Thunder have also escaped the fire.
and are filed with rebel prisoners of war.


Most OF the editors fled, and especially
John Mitchell. The Whig appeared yester-
day as Union paper, with the name of the
former proprietor at its head.


The theater opens here tonight.


Piracy-Seizure OF the Harriet Deford.


BALTIMORE, April 5, 8: 30 P. M.-AIbert
Legue, of the steamer Harriet DeFord,
which plies between this port and various
landings on the PatuXent river, reached this
city this morning, and with several passen-
gers arriving the previous night, gives infor-
nation OF an act of piracy somewhat similar
IN circumstances to that of the St. Nicholas
piracy in the summer of 1861.


They say that on Tuesday, P. NJ, while the
steamer was lying at her wharf at Fair
Haven, Chimney Bay, about twenty-seven
'ebels, disguised and claiming to be refu-
sees, who came up the Patuxent in boats
he previous afternoon, appeared on board,
md shortly after threw off their disguise
They retained the engineer and fireman
whom they compelled to steam up, and then
tarted down the river, but shortly after re-
urned and permitted the passengers to land
1t Fair Haven.


Some money was taken belonging to the
after. There were a number of negroes on
board, whom they detained claiming it was
heir intention to carry them to the East
indies. Capt. Learge was released with the
passengers, who were all put under an OBJ
igation to remain on the wharf four hours


Later from Mexico.


New YORK, April 5.-The steamer Column
oia brings Havana dates to the Ist. Late
ldvices from Vera Cruz confirm the report
Of the disaster to the commandant of Vera
Cruz. 1t appears that with $50 Austrians he
went to the neighbOrhood of Alvarado and
burned and pillaged it. On his return he
was set upon by 400 Liberals, himself killed
and l50 OF his followers also killed or
wounded. The ravages this man has com,
mitted in Mexico will brand his name with
eternal infamy. The Austrians are becom-
ing dissatisfied with the service in Mexico
and deserting daily Others are dying rapid
"" with fever


The French have abandoned the expedi-
ton to Minatitlan and other places ON the
coast, and seem to be going home. A large
number left on the steamer on the 10th ult.,
and others in transports.


1t is said that Mrs. Ovideo, Of diamond
wedding fame, is dangerously i'll with the
smallpox, of which several cases have oc-
cured in Havana.

.rnment we ever heard of. Senior Caluze,
Revolutionist, was duly sworn in as Presi-
lent.

posed them on their arrival, and three of the

EDUCATING THE CoLoRED PopULA-
TIoN SoUTH.-It is beginning to be
recognized by the thinking men of
the South that it is a a1moral duty on
their part to educate the colored pop
ulation. 1t is impossible, in the pres
ent wants of the South, to do without
the labor of it's four millions Of
blacks. AS they are part Of the So
cial system, the question arises, is it
not better to so improve this class
that the country may have the benefit
of its virtues and not be afflicted by
its vices if left to ignorance and the
mischievous self-indulgence which
arises from it - The religious asso-
Citations recently assembled at Rich
mond, earnestly debated this subject,
and the conclusion was that the col
ored race ought to be educated, and
by the Southern people, for if they
neglect, nobody else will be likely to
do it. Even with reference to mate
rial prosperity, it is of vast moment
that they have skilled and intelligent
labor, both in manufae etures and agri-

much in the right direction that 1900 citi-

highly esteemed citizen of Hawkins county,

count of the brutal manner in which he was
whipped on the 2Sth of july by six of his
rebel neighbors. He was decoyed off from
his home into the wood by a neighbor who
pretended to wish to see him on business
On halting, one Of the party drew pistol,
and ordered him TO walk on. Presently they
ordered him to strip off his coat. vest and
shirt. The old man demonstrated, but the
rufian exclaimed, ""pull them off d-n you,
or I'll shoot you."" The ringleader then
drew off his coat, and taking big c0whide,
gave the old man one hundred and twenty
lashes on his bare back. The old man beg
ged leave to sit down, when his tormentor
answered. e. d-n YOU, I'll give YOU
rest"" He continued to lash him until the
blood spattered over his clothes. After
whipping him on the back he began to beat
him over the breast. The lynchers then
ordered the old man to run. He hobbled
off. and the rufian followed, beating him
over the head with the butt of the cowhide.
At last one of them threw large rock with
violence. which barely missed his head
The ruffians then told him that if he ever
told of the affair, they would kill him and
every one on his farm. Two of the lynch
ers have been arrested and bound over for
trial. and the others are lurking in the
woods. They sent in word to their victim
the other day, that if he did not withdraw
the suit they would kill him."

The movement Of tho Army Of the Potomac,
alluded to in the HERALD of yesterday and Thursday

tfon OF RiehmOnd.",,"tensely interesting The facts reported are
that on Wednesday last, General Sheridan's
cavalry leading the way. portion Of the
Army of the Potomac had moved on in the
direction of the Southside Railroad; that the
column, after crossing Hatcher's run,
had met some forces Of the enemy, and re-
pulsed them with considerable loss, bringing in
a number Of prisoners; that General Lee was
believed to be hurrying forward troops for the
protection of the Southside road; but that
Sheridan would, in all probability, be ahead of
him. In anticipation Of his success, twas ex-
pected that the evacuation of Petersburg and
Richmond would speedily follow.


This is the news ON hand Of Wednesdays
operations. Next we have the intelligence that
on Thursday, from halfpast ten in the morn
ing till halfpast one in the afternoon, fu-
rious cannonading was heard at City Point in
the direction of the Petersburg front, which is
some ten miles above. A battle was supposed
to be in progress. Next we have the informa-
ton from Richmond that the banks there have
been sending away their effects, and that two
percussion cap factories had been also removed
to Danville or Lynchburg. From these facts,
and others before received, we are left to con-
lecture the nature and results of these late un-
developed military operations.


They may be reduced to mere demonstra-
ton from General Meade for the purpose Of
diverting the attention Of General Lee from
Sheridans expedition; but they may also have
been for the purpose of a nearer occupation Of
the Southside road, with or without gen.
eral engagement, as Lee might elect We
think it altogether probable that in these move
ments there was larger purpose in view than
the protection of Sheridan's cavalry. The
Army Of the James and the Army Of the Poto-
mac had both been equipped for an immediate
advance. Lee had been weakened meantime
to strengthen Johnston; the latter, at or near
Raleigh, was beyond supporting distance Of
Lee; but by withholding a general movement
against Lee, even few days longer, Johnston
might get up to the front considerable body
of reinforcements in advance of Sherman-the
enemy having the interior line of the Danville
Railroad for the transfer of his troops. We
think ~ probable that all these considerations
were embraced in the ""fve minute"" consul
tation the other day between Grant and Sher-
man, and that the latter has hurried back to
prevent the junction of Johnston with Lee, in
view Of the evacuation of Richmond from the
movement determined upon by General Grant


The late rains and the resulting embargo
upon the spongy roads around Petersburg may
have interfered with the operations contem-
plated; but still we anticipate very early news
of the evacuation of Richmond and the active
pursuit of Lees army, and that Sherman, too,
is again upon the war path.





Mexico AND THE REBEL ARMEs-It would
be somewhat remarkable IL our great strug-
gle should finally terminate in an extern
sive military migration, and if the difficult
questions of the rebel armies and the proud
and intractable Southern leaders should be set
tied in that way. Such an issue to such war
would not be without precedent Wars between
races of directly opposed systems of civiliza-


ion are for supremacy, whatever appearance
accidental local questions may give them; and
,ne must either submit to be overwhelmed by
he other and to lose its identity, or it must go
out in search of ""fresh fields and pastures new""
Though such migration Of any considerable
portion of people seems to be hardly in the
spirit Of the present age, we certainly have the
more essential elements of it in the remnants
Of the rebel armies; and there is very rich
and tempting territory fairly within their reach
that could easily be seized and made subject to
their arms. II Lee should move out of Rich
mond to the Southwest, and be very feebly pur-
sued, and thence continue his march to Mexico,
how il might change the whole aspect OF the
relations Of this continent with Europe.


Seward, the French papers say, will recog-
nize the government Of Macmillan, and that
will make US all right with France, while we
would be sure to be all RIGHT with Mexico on
the Monroe doctrine; for the government
established by fifty or sixty thousand rebels
would certainly be republican in form. The
only difficulty then would be between France
and the men who made such an irruption
into her province. What would the political
Messiah dos BY the employment of the utmost
military power that he could put in Mexico he
could not cope with Lee. If he should try to
hold Mexico he would fail terribly; and If he
did not try--if he gave il up, he would GER
tainly have to Ace revolution In France.

none N>-s. A strict search was instituted for
any Ii lU1r TASKS that might have been smus-
gled ..fa'--d inducing hilarity. To the credit
of the party not a drop was found; but in
the vigilance with which the search was
pushed some mistakes unavoidably happened.

newspaper. Elijah looked high and low for
his clean shirt, but it was not to be found
Much sympathy was expressed for Mr.. T. in
the loss of his clean shirt. Apples were show
cred upon him and he was piled with sand
witches. When the runner for the asProyidence
Life Insurance Company came through the
cars the company made up ten cent subscrip-
lion TO insure Elijahs life for twelve hours in
the sum of 5000 if killed and SIS per week IL
permanently disabled by railway accident
This was felt to be due to the venerable father
of two tender babes, and who had lost his clean
shirt Those who had left no such pledges to
fortune behind felt that they could be gener-
ous; Tom Lloyd headed the subscription.


BY the time all these preliminaries had been
arranged the train had sped on across sui
len Bull Run and was climbing the heavy
grade TO the plains of Manassas. Nature has
been busy covering up the traces of war and
has already obliterated almest every sign of
conflict upon this renowned field. The forti-
fcatlons at Manassas Junction have cru nbled
already TO the merest semblance of defined
outline; the myriad graves at Bristow, where
the rebel dead were buried in their tracks, are
now level with the sod; the thickets OF Catlett's
Station, the haunts of guerrillas and the secure
hiding place of rebel fianking armies are now
cleaned up root and branch; and the timbers of
the long line of block houses and stockades
from Burke's Station to the Rapidan have been
converted-not exactly into pruning hooks and
plough -shares-but into as peaceful an equiya
lent-railroad ties


The country from Alexandria to Culpeper
Court House may be designated as a desert
houseless, fenceless, treeless, and with scarce a
sign of life or useful vegetation Ii is one
wide waste of chocolate -coIored soil and scrub
growth. From the railroad near Culpeper
may be seen the ruins of the pleasantly situated
Culpeper residence of Mr.. w. D. waIlach. Not
only is every vestige of house and farm build
ing upon this property swept away, bur alse
the fine old trees, the growth Of centuries Pas

 At High Bridge, over the Appomattox, Lee again crossed to the north side of the river, and two ot our regiments, which were sent there to hold the bridge, were captured by strong reb lei calalry force. The railroad bridge at this 1polnt, very high and long stncture, was burn led by the enemy. Lee now headed directly for Lynchburgh. in the hope of reaching point |where he could move around the front of our left wing, and escape toward Danville by a road which runs directly south from point about twenty miles east ssof Lynchburgh. But Grant was too vigorous--the pursuit was too hot. Lees rear and Hanks were so sorely press led that he ws.s compelled to skirmish nearly every step, and to destroy or abandon an i'm |mense amount of property, while Sheridan was rapidly shooting ahead of him. The position Therefore, on Sunday morning, was one from which Lee could not possibly extricate himself His army lay massed short distance west off Appomattox Courthouse his last avenue of escape toward Danville on the southwest wasI gone; he was completely, hemmed in. MeadeI was in his rear 0n the east and on hls right Hank north of Apponattox Courthouse; Sher-l ldan had headed him of completely, by getting between him and Lynchburg Gen. Ord was on the south of the court house, near the railroad x the troops were in the most enthusiastic spirits and the rebel army was doomed. Lees last effort to escape was made on Sunday morning | oy attempting to cut his way through Sheri-I dan's lines, but it totally failed.

 It will be recolected that Gen. Grants frst| letter to Lee was dated on the 7th, Friday, the day of the battle of Farmville, and the cores. |pondence was kept up during tn. following day land up to II o'clock on Sunday as already published. In response to Gen. Grants last letter, Gen. Lee appeared on the picket line of the Second Corps, Miles division with a let ter addressed to Gen. Meade, requesting ces- sation of hostlities while he considered Gen. Grants terms of surrender. Gen Meade rel piled that he had no authority to accede to theI request, but that he would wait two hours bel fore making at attack. In the meantime Gen sd 6eef to d7ffra ""A flag oNqaaes -uAnldS Appomattox Court-bopse shortly after noon. and at about 2 o'clock P. N sthe tws Gamer als met at the house of Mr. Wilmer Nc Lean.! Gen. Lee was attended by Gen. Marshal, hisl Adjutaut- General, Gen. Grant, by Col Parker one of his chief Camp. The two| Generals met and greeted each other with dig nifed courtesy, and p oceeded at oucs to theI business before them. Gen. Lee immediately alluded to the conditions of the surrender characterized them as exceedingly lenient, aodI said he would gladly leave all the details toj Gen. Grants own discretion. Gen. Grant, stated the terms of the parol: that the arnsI should be stacked, the artillery parked, and theI supplies and munitions turned over to him. the officers retaining their side arms, horses and personal effects. Gen Lee pronptly as sented to the conditions, and the agreement of surrender was engrosssd and signed by Gen Lee at 3:30 o'clock.

 Gen. Lee asked Gen. Grant for aD interpre |tation of the phrase, personal effects, and said that many of his cayalrynlen owned their own horses. Gen. Grant said he construed it to mean that the horses must be turned over to- |the United States Government. Gen. Lee ad |mitted the correctness and justice of the inter |pretation, when Gen. Grant said he would in- struct his officers to allow those men who own led their horses to retain them, as they would need them for the purpose.of tilling their farms. |Gen. Lee expressed great sense of gratitca- ton for such generous consideration, and said it would have very good effect. He sub sequently expressed hope that each soldier | might be furnished with e certificate of his pa zrol, as evidence to prevent him from being forced into the army until regularly exchanged. Gen. Grano assented to the suggestion, and the

 printing presses were soon put to work to print 1the documents required.

 In regard to the strength of his army Gen. eral Lee said he had no idea of the number of men that he should be able to deliver up -

 There had been so many engagements, and

 such heavy losses from desertion and other

 causes within the past few days, and the rel

 treat so rapid, that no regular morning re-

 ports had been made since leaving Peters

 burgh but it is generally believed by the

 best informed officers that Lee surrendered

 eighteen to twenty thousand men. Of the

 army horses, wagons, etc., there is yet no of-

 Gcial account. General Lee informed General

 Grant that his men were short of provisions,

 whereupon General Grant ordered twenty-five

 thousand rations to be distributed to them

 Thus substantially ended the interview. Both

 generals were the very impersonaiion ot

AUBURN, APRIL 8, 1865.

Eastern News,",,"The great event OF the week has been the
capture of Richmond and Petersburg by
Grants Army. The Confederate forces
evacuated Petersburg on Sunday night, and
Richmond on Monday morning. These
events we're preceded by severe fighting for
several days south and west Of Petersburg,
the rebel lines being gradually forced back
until they retired to the north side Of the
Appomat.ox river. This occurred on Sun
day uight,-on the following day, Lees en-
tire force from both Petersburg and Rich.
mond were in full retreat toward Burkes-
Vile and Lynchburg.


Ten days ago the telegraph announced
that Lee was preparing TO evacuate Rich.
mond, as be was sending machinery aud
munitions Of war to Danville and Lynch
burg. 1t was also announced that he had
sent strong reinforcements to Johnston to
enable him TO oppose the march Of Sherman.
II would seem that Grant acted on this be,
lief, and moved nearly all Of his troops
north Of the James, TO his extreme left west
Of Petersburg, in order to prevent Lees
escape. Sheridan commanded the left, Ord
and Mead the center and right. Fighting
commenced as early as Saturday, the 25th,
the rebels under Gen. Gordon, attacking
and capturing Fort Seadman, which they
were unable TO hold. More or less fighting
continued through the early part of the
week, but Thursday and Friday were days Of
severe battle, in which many men were lost
on both sides. The main object Of this
lighting seems to have been to turn Lees
right flank, west Of Petersburg, and throw
it back upon Richmond, but without suc
cess. In Fridays fight, Warren's Fifth Corps
is said to have lost 5000 men. Saturday
was day Of comparative quiet, prepara'
tions being made for assault.


On Sunday Grant massed powerful force
On bis extreme left, under Sheridan, and
after terrible conflict succeeded in break
ing Lees lines. This compelled the giving
up the defenses of Petersburg. and through
out the remainder of the day the rebeI |
troops fell back to ons defense after another
until they crossed the Appomattox. Next
morning both Richmond and Petersburg
were evacuated.


Grant ordered an immediate pursuit of
Lee, but at last accounts be was at Amelia
Court House going westward.


The Federal troops found but few guns in
Petersburg, or munitions of war. They had
been mostly removed. 500 guns were found
in Richmond, and quantity Of small arms.
A large number of prisoners tsken-princi'
paly wounded soldiers.


The full fruits Of the victory are not vel
known but the'capture Of such stronghold
rs Richmond is great success; but the fail.
ure TO corral the Confederate host detracts
materially from the magnitude of the VIC
tory.


Sherman's army is at Goldsboro, North
Carolina. For some unexplained reason be
made no advance in ten or twelve days
The fight at Bentonville on the 10Th of
March. seems to have been more important
than FIRST reported. Both sides claim ,c'
tory.


Gen. Candy is beseiging Mobile, and the
place has been reported captured but the
news has not been confirmed.


The elections in Connection, and Rhode
Island have gone largely for the Admins
tration."

SAN FRANc1sco, April Sd, 1866.


To the Honorable Board of Education of the


City and County of San Francisco:

desire to hold Office, and expect no emolu-
ments or profits for serving the ""desr people,""
l am plain mechanic-a carpenter by trade

""Board of Education"" was designed for the
public good, and not as a mutual beneficial

rectors, once believed, were rewarded by
their consciousness Of doing good, and self
appreciation their pay; but ten months init
macy with your Honorable Board"" has
dspeIed the illusion. now understand the
machinery, but don't like its operation; and
in proof that speak advisedly, here point
out few Of the many invisible springs that
originate the motive power of your Board,
rendering too close contact with its presi
ent atmosphere prejudicial to the health of
honesty: Widber recommends increasing the
salary of Mastick's sister. Mastck advocates
raising the pay OF Widber's brother. Pet
teachers are furnished the questions in ad-
vance Of their examination. Your copy book
contract with Bancroft was virtually fraud
upon the Department. Gray urged the pur-
chase Of the Broadway lot Gray d. Giles
pie searched the title, and the Board bought
it. Now it turns out that the title was i'm.
perfect, and suit was pending at the time
for its recovery, in which Gray was attorney
and had an interest Lynch, TAFT and Gray,
fearing Pelton's claim TO the Superintendent
cy, wickedly turned him out of the Rncon
School on pretended charges, denied him
hearing, and although the oldest and one OF
tho best teachers in the Department, sought
to blacken his reputation and consign his
family TO want. Falsehoods bave been
spread upon your minutes, debate choked,
character blackened, and the reputation
of teachers stabbed for selfish purposes.
Teachers in the Department are losing all
self-respect and independence Of character
They are fe'tered, gagged, and required to be
unduly subservent. The monetary affairs of
the Department are conducted without econ.

extravaganza everywhere prevales. The Su

ugly coincidence occurs, that may cost the
Department $4,000 or $4,000. The use
of drugs not being incident to your duties,
Widber's brother gets, without competition,
the carpenters work Of the Department.

you d brief aeeonnt of the defeat of Early

vision was pushed forward across the Blue
Ridge, and entered Charlottesville at 2 o.
clock P. NJ. next day. The Mayer and
principal inhabitants came out and delivered
up the keys of the public buildings. had
to remain at Charlottesville two days. The
time was consumed in bringing over from
Waynesboro ammunition and pontoon trains.
The weather was terrible. Rain fell contin
ually On the 9th of March l sent the lst
division, General Devens commanding to
Scottsville, on the James river, With direc-
tions to send out light parties through the
country to destroy all mills and factories,
and the bridges on the Ravenna river, the
parties to join the division at Scottville. The
division then proceeded along the canal to
Duguidsville, fifteen miles from Lynchburg,
destroying every lock, and in many places
banks of the canal. AT Duguidsville we
hoped to secure the bridge to cross the river,
as our pontoons wee useless on account of
, high water In this we were disappointed,
as both the bridges were gone. At Rockfish
river the bank of the canal was cut, and at
New Camden. where the dam is across the
James, the guard lock was destroyed and
the James river let into the canal. carrying
away the bank and washing out the bottom
this point was partially destroyed. l have
had no opposition. Everybody is bewildered
by our movements. | have had no news of
any kind since | left. The bridges on the
railroad from Swoops river, and on the other
side of Staunton to Charlottesville, were ut
terly destroyed; also the bridges for dis.
tance of ten miles on the Gordonsville Rail-
road. The weather has been very bad, in
deed it has been raining hard every day,
with the exception of few, since we started.
My wagons have, from the state of the roads,
detained me. Up to the present time we
have captured IA pieces artillery-1l at
Waynesboro and 3 at Charlottesville. The
party sent back from Waynesboro started
with s. pieces, but were compelled to destroy
2 of the 6 for want of animals. The re,
naming s were thoroughly destroyed. We
have also captured II canal boats, with sup.
plies, ammunition, &c. Com. Hollins, of
the rebel navy, was shot near Gordonsville,
while attempting to make his escape from
our advance in that direction.

leans letter says Juarez is advancing on Mata.
moras with 5000 men. Mejia has but 1000,
and is afraid he will be coslpeled to sur
render. He sent out Cortinas with a regi-
ment to check the progress of Juarez, but
Cortinas surrendered his whole force of
Mexicans to Juarez. The reason given for
this is that Maximilian agreed to give Cor
tinas half million dollars, provided be turn
| ed over his command to the Imperial Gov
ernment, but after he had consented, the
Emperor refused to pay him. The Imperi-
alists are becoming alarmed at the increas-
ing force of Liberals, and the treachery of
the Mexican commanders and their troops in
the service of Macmillan.

ton, says that on the 10th Bragg again at.

in confusion. All their killed and wounded
fell into our hands."

A Washington dispatch of March lst says on
the authority Of the Richmond Examiner, that
Federal Generals Kelly and Cook, recently cap
tured, had been assigned apartments in Libby
Prison. The Enquirer says rebel Congressman
are fleeing from Richmond, and the Examiner has
long article to prove that the abandonment of
Richmond by the rebel Government and army
would be the abandonment of the scheme of in
dependence for the Southern Confederacy


The message of Governor Brown of Georgia,
is published. He defends his State against
newspaper charges of allowing Sherman to march
unmolested through it. He says she was en-
tirely abandoned to her fate and neglected by
the Confederate authorities. He recommends
the establishment of the militia organizations.
to be turned over to the Confederate Gov
ernment- He also recommends the impressment
of provisions from persons who won't sell sup
plies to the INDECENT families of soldiers. He
recommends law to punish robbery with death,
opposes the arming of the slaves, complains of
the usurpation of the rebel Congress in leyying
disproportionate taxes, charges upon it many
abuses and charges all the disasters upon the
generalship of JEFF. Davis. He says the Govern
ment is military despotism and the Confederacy
is drifting into anarchy. If persisted in, this
must terminate in reconstruction, with or with
out subjugation.


The New York World, of the 3D. has the fol-
lowing particulars concerning the burning of
Columbia Is. C.): Soon after a corps of Sher-'
mans troops had captured Columbia the rebel
citizens there endeayored in every possible
ner to harass our troops. The corps which en-
tered the city after its capture at once left to join
in Sherman's further advance, and was succeed
ed by Slocums corps. While the latter corps
was quietly marching through the principal
streets to their temporary barracks, a number of
citizens poured deadly fire upon them from
windows and roofs of the houses they occupied.
The insurrection was beginning to spread. Our
troops retired short distance and subsequently
fred the city, which is now in ashes. The Her
aids correspondent says Columbia was burned
by order of Sherman as punishment for citizens
firing on our troops.


mond editorials foreshadow the evacuation of
that city The Worlds Army of the Potomac
special dispatch says There is every indication
of a panic at Richmond. The old Senators and
members of the House are fleeing, and now there
is barely quorum in Congress to transact bust
ness. This has been hushed up, but the
Richmond papers openly allude to the fact, and
call upon the military authorities to bring back
the fugitives by force. a very important move
ment is now being made by Lee, and it is believed
to be the evacuation of Richmond Sheridan
has sent q force forward to ascertain whether
Lee was preparing to fall back to Lynchburg."
