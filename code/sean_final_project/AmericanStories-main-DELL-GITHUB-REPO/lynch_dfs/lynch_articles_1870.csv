This modern Pompadour has sharp eve
for business; she carried on a smart trade in
forced loans, on her own account in which
however. she sometimes got bitten. One of
her victims was a doctor on the staff of Lone,
from whom, one dav, she borrowed the snug
little sum ""t $4,000; but as the son of Eseu
lapius was innocent of coin she was satisfied
with his draft. payable in Europe. which he

The jury gave verdict in favor Of Mr..

profitable Week.",,"


Another week Of Congress has passed, and
the record still stands--time FILTERED away.
There was enough work done, but it was not
of the important kind. The Army bill was
passed in the Senate, and it is q very good
measure, and the Legislative Appropriation
hill, which is merely routine business, pro-
gressed very fairly. But outside of these the
time that should have been devoted to the
Franking Privilege bill, the st. Domingo
treaty and other important measures lying
dormant among fossil committees was devoted
mainly to discussing, without action, Mr.. Nor
rilIs proposition to secure protection by
revenue tariff, the centralizlng tendencies of
the Freedmens Bureau and Mr.. Summers
desperate effort for new departure on the
oolored question.


The past week was even more improbable
in the House. All the work done has been of
negative character. The only till of vital
Importance introduced was Mr.. Lynch's bill to
revive the shipping interest, and that, having
been discussed until the morning hour
on Thursday, went over under the rules
uutA AoAs Auccouys Au0 NOitneTu hcAho
Railroad bill, apparently huge land grab
bing job, occupied most Of the time of the
House, but it was not concluded, and, owing
to the pldcky determination Of the minority TO
ilibuster on il, will probably succeed cnly in
wasting the time Of the members. The Tarf
bill has been dragging its slow length along,
its prosy details enlvened at times by the bril-
liant jovialities Of Cox and Bltler but still
it is not nearly finished, and is on an average
an excessively dull subject for light reading.
Besides, it does not seem likely to pass when
the Committee OF the Whole have completed
revising it, and thus 1t too contributes its
quota to frittering away uselessly the time Of
the members Altogether we have an idea
that the members believe too much in play
and too little in work, and would recommend
them all to draw their full salaries for the ses-
sion and obtain indefinite leave."

IFRoM OUR OWN CORRESPONDENCE


RIO DE J,NERo. March 2j.-On the 18th inst the
,ar; nj was thrown into state of unusual excite
ret. by the arrival Of an English steamer from the
so.th. bringing the startling news of another con-
tst in which the Allies had again most sgnally tr-


s,rhed over their too obstinate foe But this time
t,o.e was something more than that wonderful dis
,,c,,rtion of loss among the cOmbatants-Of course
IN favor Of Tie Anies-whch has ever been the GUS
to,,aTy tale told since the war began. Lopez him
ST and his principal chiefs, had perished in the
flt Mrs Lynch, with her brood of little ones, after
sr-ne difficulty had been made prisoners, and the en-
Ii, Pa1aouayaa force either killed, captured, or had
ben l1t 20 night.


Jn Change, the news was received with the great
o.; enthusiasm, Some persons read aloud extracts
from tlc River Plate journals, to constant mterrup-
lions by the cheers Of those around. AS the Empe-
re- was returning from the city palace to San Chris
toyaS. and was passing through Rua Dizeita, the
pculic WO flied the space in front of the Exchange
surrounded tho imperial coach, and shouted enthus-
attic yivas TO His Majesty the Emperor, to Count
iLu. ard to Gen. CamaIa. His Majesty expressed
MS gratitude for these demonstrations, and added:
You may he certain that the war is now ended""
Crowds of people headed by musical bands and
Jearu the cOlOs 0f the three allied nations marched
through The streets, shouting vyas and dscharging
rockets Al the public buildings were at once deco
rated with flags, and joy was upon every face. AT
nislt the city was spendidly Illuminated, and the
Emperor. giving his arm TO the Empress, and with
fhe Imperial Princess at his side went on foot
through some of the principal streets, mingling
freely with the people Dom Pedro everywhere
coiyed with the Iyeliest manifestations of esteem
auo respect.


Early on the morning Of the 1st inst, Lopez, with
leOJ mon, was surprised by a Brazilian force of the
same size while encampcd on the left bank of the
AquiGayan, stream twenty leagues to the south of
the ATa. aud like the latter tributary of the Para
l1lay The Aquidavan River is the same as the Aqui-
dayaui-,e traced on the map of the north part of
Paraguay. To the north of the position where Lo-
PEI fought his last battle is the town Of San Saliva
4 J, and to the south that of Conception. The at
tackine force commanded by Gen. Camara, was the
same which set ont from Conception on or about
Feb. 10 to oyertaEc Lopez upon the receipt Of news
that the Dictator had already crossed the Apa and
va huTying bis fight to Bolivia.
s. suld n and imp stuous was the attack of the
BH2iliaus that the Paraguayans who guarded the
a.l ~ had time to give the least warning. Lo-
pz wth those officers who happened to be about him,


tried fTanticy to form his troops into line to repel
tn assault. But before this could be done to any
extent, The Rio Grandc horse were upon him. and his
little party routed and driven to the nearest woods
where but few escaped. Lopez himself was killed in
sight OF Cen Camara who in vain called upon him to
surrender The eX Dictator, already severely wounded
ohStinaely refused to yield, and meanwhile tried to
escape. The thrust of lance brought him TO the
ground. Caminos, Minister Of Lopez, met a similar
fate Vce-PTesident Sanchez was killed before be-
ing recognized. Col Aquiar, Majors Vargas Ascurra,
Estiparribia Carloso. Insfante, Soils, and various
others also perished in the conflict. Col Lopez, son
of the Dictator killed he trying to escape
with Mrs. Lyncs party. Many chiefs were taken
prisoners, including Gems. ResQuin and Delgado and
various other superior officers. -Four priests were
also taken one of whom was the celebrated Maiz.
Gen. Caballero with 40 men, almost all officers,
had, the day before gone out from Cerro-Cora to
gather up cattle they were attacked and beaten by
Col Benz 10 Martins. The General, however sue
oeeded in escaping after abandoning everything he
had, even to his sword. Valla and SOuza, who were
in charge of a baggage train at ChIiguelo, managed
10 escape, although their force was routed. ROcha,
who was in the advance with eight pieces of artil-
lery was also promptly beaten. Averio took adyant-
ape Of the general confusion and made good his eS-
cape.


few hours after the fight Mrs, Lynch, who could
not at first be found, oveItaken on the road, as
she was endeavoring to escape with small party,
and made prisoner, with her four sons, and the





Minister Paranos states in his dispatch, had been
condemned to death, and the mother of Lopez to
have been executed the very day which the
Brazlans made their attack. The families of Cabal-
lero Caminhos and Gil were also taken prisoners,
and all were to return with the Brazilian forces to
Concepcion. Seventeen pieces of artillery are also
reported to have been captured. This shows that
Lopez must have had a very large park of artillery
with him during The past year or so, or we must dis
believe much that has been said and written from
time to time about the abandonment of all his heavy
guns, and the frequent throwing of cannon into the
rivers on his line Of march.


The great spirit with which Lopez so long main
tanned an unequal contest with his powerful Toes,
and the brntal inhumanities which were generally
laid 10 his charge have attracted for him the notice
of the civilized world. The manner OF his death
will not lessen the interest excited Those who were
friendly 10 him before, and sympathized with his
course will now praise him in terms of the war1nest
admiration. Those who in him only the med
der the instgatOr Of discOrd the nsolen assalant
and Tie tcTOcoUs despOt viii regard his death simply
ss another instance of that retrbutve justice which
IS sometimes mcted ont to the wicked IN this world
The actual place. however which Lopez will fill IN
history cannot now be stated

and succeeded in eflecting treaty of peace, which


was concluded in San jose dc Flores.


Lopez the elder, ON his death-bed, September, 1862


bequeathed his power to his son. and the following
month Congress ratified the act. The people thought
that Gen. Lopez would establish free Government
but few of the wiser ones shook their heads, la
mentng the death of the old Dictator. Hardly had


year elapsed when the war of Gen. Flores In the
Banda Oriental, induced the ruler to meddle in
the affairs of bis neighbors. We say meddle, be-
cause the parties to the original difficulty were Urn-
quay and Brazil 1t was not matter that concerned
Lopez; and for him to declare war against Brazil
because that country fit to decline his offered
mediation in her affair with Uruguay is something
that all reasonable men must ever regard as high
handed in the extreme. The offer of mediation i'm
plies the right to accept decline it; and could q
nation he expected to accept the mediation of one
who had already pronounced in favor Of its oppo-
nent1 The war thus raslly undertaken by Lopez
was destined to turn his fourishing country into q
desert, though such result was not yet foreseen.
The Paraguayans still pursued their peaceful labors
without any apprehensions of the terrible calamity
which was shortly to overwhelm them. At the close
of 1863 the culture of cotton had become general
among the planters. Public works were being rap
idly pushed forward at Asuncion and railroad was
COlHpICltu Hdll way W AZ thlo tliic lbC
people and nation were prosperous.


The Brazilian invasion of the Banda Oriental in
July 1864, precipiated events. Lopez sent ulti-
matum in August declaring against Brazil If she
did not withdraw her army. On the 18th of Novem-
Der the steamer Marquee de Olinda was captured in
Paraguayan waters, and on the 18th of December an
expedition marched against Matto Crosse. At this
time the Paraguayan army was composed of 10000
men, well provided with artillery and material
aud supported by a fotla of eight or nine steamers.
II Lopez had cOntented himself with making war
against Brazil within his own territory il is probable
that he would have been still ruling in Paraguay.
But he was disgusted with the neutrality of the
Argentine Republic, and a passage for his army
across the Missions having been denied him, he
seized two Argentine steamers of war anchored in
the port of COrIcntes. From this resulted the triple
alliance The allies were obliged to take the defen-
sive for year at least. Then the war went with
varying success until the fall of Humata in Febru-
ary, 1868, when the wheel of fortune turned against
Lopez forever. He resisted for some time in Angos-
tuTa which surrendered during the last month of the
same year, and since then there has been only q
guerrilla contest, the Paraguayans huITedly retiring
from place to place and constantly diminishing in
numbers By death or desertion.


Up to very short time it was believed that Lopez
would escape to Bolivia and this was, without
doubt, his intention when he was overtaken by the
Brazilian forces. He saved the allies from grave
by not srrendeIing himself but pre-
ferIing to die sword in hand Better would it havo
been for his people if he had fallen two years since
in the defense OF HWnaita. 1t is a moulnfu subject
the comparison between what Paraguay
might have been to-day if Lopez had followed in the
footsteps of his father, and the miserable state in
he Ia f4,r
them, and century must pass before Paraguay can
recover from the terrible effects produced by the
pride and selGshness Of him who has just died by
the hands of Brazilian soldier.


Lopez left four sons by bis Morponitic marriage
with Madame Lynch. He was man Of limited in
but is said to have spoken English,
French and Spanish correctly. He was corpulent,
but agile agreeable in conversation with strangers,
lofty and arrogant with his own people. His physi
ognomy was more Spanish than Indian. Sometimes
he dressed in the garb Of Napoleon BoDapartc,
weakness also related of the first Dictator Francia
He wore his beard long, and about five feet and
eight inches in hight. During the long war Just
ended he is declared to have shown military talent
Of only an inferior order If Lopez had placed
himself at the head of his troops in the beginning OF
the contest"" says The Standard Of Buea0s AUes,
beyond question he might have gained possession of
Entire Rios Santa Fe, and the Banda Oriental He
sacrificed corps darm6e in his bady-nspired expe-
dition to Rio Grandc He lost an excellent oppor-
tunity to involve Gen. Paunero and capture large
park of artillery ia the Province of Corrientes He
destroyed his war vessels in the unequal contest with
the Brazilian squadron at RiachuclO. He wasted a
portion of his best troops in the mad attack upon
the island of Itapiru. In a word, he committed the
most fatal errors. Still, he had brave officers and
soldiers left and the reverse of the allies the 22d
of September, 1866 at Cuupaity, was an event from
which he might have drawn great advantages""


The oft-repeated declaration that Lopez was
cruel tyrant seems now to be generally admitted
His crueltes during the last two years have doubt
less been exaggerated and proof of this is furnished
in the case of his mother, whom Brazlans spoke Of
as having been whipped by his orders every day.
But, unfortunately for his memory, he cannot be abb
solved from many other crimes of ferocious charac-
ter. which are proved by unquestioned evidence.
Furthermore he is declared to have been no patriot
no true lover of his country, In August, 1861, Mr..
Could the English representative TO the Argentine
Rrpnblic. made overtures to him that were most
honorable The allies were ready to evacuate Para
quay if Lopez would retire to Europe and leave the
Government in the hands of the Vice-President. If
he had accepted these conditions in the beginning
he pretended lie would he might have associated his
name with remembrances of glory and patriotism,
and he might perhaps, ere this, have returned to
Paraguay in the quality of President by the free
choice Of the people. In the Last days of 1863, after
the dec sive contests Of December, when further
struggle had become hopeless, the true patriot,
having at heart the interests and happiness OF his
people would have yielded rather than permit any
more blood to be shed on his account.


Nevertheless, to many it will seem paradoxical to
say that Lopez was no patriot. Did he not struggle


gaIantly against the invader of his country through


a long series of years. ever protesting that hs sole


object was TO defend the national intercstsf and,"

In speaking of the Chamberlain move

the Lewiston Jonrnal says; This plan of
organizing party within party, for the
control OF political convention, is one
entirely new in the history of Maine poll
tics""


The Biddeford Union wishes to know in
reference to the Chamberlain movement
in Portland, why the arguments advanced
by Mr.. Lynch's friends in favor of his
nomination and election, to wit, expert
ence us legislator and no attention to To-
cality, should be disregarded or reversed
in pressing Chamberlain for Senator
against Morrill,


A correspondent of the Portland Press
addresses the following communication to
that paper, which appeared Friday morn
| ing:


Within few weeks past we have been
| furnished with many and cogent arguments,
as we believe, on the great value TO the coun-
try of legislative experience, when coupled
with eminent talents and fidelity in those who
are to represent us in the national councils.
We wish to recount anew our hearty concur
renee in those arguments, and In the practicaI
endorsement OF them by the late district con-
ventiun which renominated Hon. John Lynch.


Pr saltun,, there appears to-day in the
Press long and respectable list of names un-
der call Tor public meeting, to ignore, as
we understand il, the principle so strenaously
insisted upon, as one of vital Importance in
the selection of candidate for Representa-
tive.


And before responding to that call we
would like to ask the signers whether the ex-
perience of Hon. l.. NJ. Morrill, in the United
States ST nate during the last ten. or of Israel
Washburn. Jr., in the House tor eight years,
is not or would not be worth as much to the
State and the Union, in the nate for six
years to come. as that of Mr.. Lynch for two
years in the House? And it not, why?


Not being aware that Mr.. Morrill's or Mr.
Washburn's ability and fidelity have ever
been called in question by the Republicans OF
the State or nat,on, we feel somewhat curious
to know hat reasons are to be assigned for
dropping them and taking man for the u. 5.
Senate who has had no legislative experience,
at least in Congress


The meeting held in Portland on Friday
evening, favoring Governor Chamberlain
for Senator. was attended, says the Press,
by about one thousand persons. Hon. }.

remarks. Hon. Geo. w. Woodman fol-

cit is not now question whether Mr. Lynch has

question whether the nomination belongs 70 York

Here are two of the oldest largest and richest counties
I'm the State embraced in our district II it ia not accord
ing to right and justice, and policy that the candidate
should be chosen from town in the same county per-
petually long good man can bo found to accept
the nomination, then there should be some equitable
adjustment for a recognition of other localities in the
District. Ii there is argument now existing why
York should acknowledge her nonentlty and her n-
ability 70 grow men capable Of representing her at tho
capital Of tie nation, that argument will hold good
for 80 years to come. The fundamental poity which
requires officers to be inhabitants Of the District from
which they are elected recognizes tho question OF To-
cality important one""


The TRIBUNE most earnestly protests
against this doctrine. 1t is steadily Ielittling
and debasing Congress. We do not know by
whom that district should be represented in
the next House. and do not wish to influence
the choice to be made; but we insist that the
very best man who will consent to serve shall
be chosen, whether he live on one side of an
imaginary line or another. The doctrine Of
The Union would have restricted the service
Of Henry Clay or Daniel Webster in the House
to four years, and made it dependent on
some sort OF Equitable adjustment"" between
political bargain-makers. Let us have MEM
bers chosen for their worth, not their locality."

at Ashley, Mo, already reported by ,elc.
graph, has caused much excitement where
it occurred, and also at Quincy, ILL.,,
where the unfortunate young lady was
we'll known and greatly admired. We
have received several letters on the sub.
jcct, and the following is the substance
Of them:


Some months since Miss Summers went
from Quincy, where her parents reside, to
Ashley, ond engaged as a teacher in che
Watson seminary of that place. II ap-
pears that before she left home young
man named Ambrose Coe, of Galesburg,
Iii. had been paying his addresses to her
Hc was Of good family and possessed Of
some means, but his manners and char.
acter were repulsivo to tho lady, and his
repeated proposals for her hand were re
jected. This i'll luck In his suit seems to
have greatly irritatcd his naturally ugly
disposition, and he had been heard to
threaten any one who should ever be more
fortunate IN the young lady's affections.


Hopeless and desperate he followed
Miss Summers from Quincy to Ashley,
and hired himself as farm laborer near
tho town for the purpose OF acting the
spy on her actions. 1t appears that last
Sunday he went to town and attended
church, where he saw the young lady in
company with gentleman Of her acqain
tancc, Coc traced thcm home, snd fol.
lowed them into the house where Miss
Snmmars hnardna-- q Goiug into tho room
where the lady was, he asked permission
Of her to talk with her privately, which
che granted, the gentleman who accom-
panied her from church retiring. Coe
immediately locked the door aud COM
menced the work Of butchering her with
an old knife which be had procured, and
sharpeued for the murderous purpose.
The screams Of the lady Immediately
alarmed the whole house, and number
Of persons rushing to the door and fning
it locked, broke it open. They found
Miss Summers lying on the foor in pool
Of her blood, with her spine completely
severed, other fatal wounds in her breast,
and the knife still sticking in the last
wound. She died in few moments.


The maddeued lover stood by, begging
those that came in to kill him at once.
Coe was arrested and placed in Bowling
Green Jail, to await his trial, and has not
been lynched as was first reported.


Miss Summers was 90 years Of age, and
is said to have been highl y accomplished.
She was the daughter of estimable pa
rents, who reside in Quincy. The steamer
Harry johnson, which left this city on
Monday last, took her body on board at
Louisiana, Mo, attended by Major Fogg,
OF Quincy. and Prof. Watkins. of Watson
Seminary at Ashley. - Republican."

Mr. Lynch will submit the documents to-
morrow, accompanied by the proposed bill. l
will not refer to the measures, as they will be
published before this letter can reach YOU.
Quite number Of delegations have waited on
the Committee during the past few days. On
the whole the remedies to be proposed as fal
as they go are satisfactory. The coasting trade
people say, the proposition to abolish loca
harbor dues, compulsory pilotage, &C., places
them fully on level with the foreign ships
which have bounty given them.


The tonnage bill is considered to be a cleye,
and sagacious measure There may be some out
cry against the bounty proposed to be given,
proper understanding Of the proposed tom
mage law will answer that. Thirty cents pe1
ton is the tax, levied each time the vesael is
entered, except as to all engaged in The coast
ing trade, the provincial, West Indian, Cen
tral and South American trades, which once
each year, all transatlantic and transpacift
vessels pay eaoh time Now &C the a,n..;o..,
SHIPS engaged in the foreign trade get thi:
back in the form of bounty, the foreign car
rier, and especially their steamships pay the
bulk Of this tax, ard that, too, without dis
elimination such as can be so considered to
lntertefe with existing treaties. All the boun.
ty provided Tor will be more than met by the
tonnage tax. AS for instance there are 119
foreign steamers engaged in our transatlantic
trade. They will each enter our ports twenty
times year. They viii be required to pay
The thirty cent tax, which averaging their ca
paclty at 1900 tons each, will give $3.50 tax
per voyage, or $4,000 per annum, and making
total of $1,071,000 on the Atlantic foreign
steamships alone. 1t will probably amount to
a good deal more than this, and to it has to he
added dues or tax on other foreign tonnage.
There is strong hope that the bill will pass.


THE FREEMEN's MIGRATION SOUTHWARK.


The walls from Virginia are loud and
long over the colored laborers leaving that
State. The Richmond Wing says that it is
estimated that 1900 individual laborlng ne
groes, large numbers of whom have families,
have been sent from Richmond within the
last two months. mainly to TO the cotton and
sugar plantations of the South They oct SIG
per month on the cotton plantations. and
from S25 10 $40 on the sugar plantations,
with transportation paid. The labor agents
say it is utterly impossible for them to supply
the demand for farm laborers which are every
day pouring in upon them. They have thou
sands OF orders upon their books at this time.
which they have no prospect of being able TO
fill.


This is tendency worth noting. The SUI
gar and cotton States are to have nearly all
the colored people and good many are leav-
ing here. SPECTATOR,"

Maine has felt the full weight of that de-
preston IN the shipping interest which has
constituted the most remarkable exception to
the general recuperative power manifested by
the nation after the war. 1t is no wonder,
therefore, that our Representatives in Con-
gress have made the decay of one of our most
important industries an object of their especial
solicitude. Much has been said and done from
time to time to stimulate Congress to take
vigorous measures to arrest the progress OF
our maritime decay; but it was not till the ap-
pointment of the select committee OF Whic""
Mr.. Lynch is chairman, that any real pios,e''
seemed TO be made. The report hoii 'H""'
committee which we have iaiu oeioie o""t
readers can hardly .aH to produce d proiouhd
impression. and to induce on the part OF Con-
gress appropriate action. For, in the first
place. there has never before been so startling
disclosure of the terrible inToads that have
been made in our commerce. Tie statement
that from the maritime equal TO that of Great
Britain we have declined till we have only a
third of that country's tonnage; that we are
losing annually s3S,O00,OOO in ne. earnings of
the carrying trade and that only ""a per cent.
OF the imports and exports OF this country are
now carried in American vessels is calculated
TO excite the eravest apprehensions for the fu-
ture In the breast of every American.


Inc measures suggested by the committee
ior The relief OF our suffering commerce are
such as will be heartily endorsed in this part
oi tne country, at least, and elsewhere If there
Is any significance in the assent aivon 90 tho
report by members oil the committee living in
all parts Of the country. The suggestion of
certain shipowners in New York and else
where, looking to the admission of foreign
built vessels to American registry, measure
which but few days ago met with the en-
phatic protest of the Maine Legislature, was
wisely ignored by the committee. The allow
ance OF drawback on shipbuilding material
or an equivalent which has always been the fa-
vorite measure of relief proposed here in
Maine, is the principal feature of the Con-
gressonal plan. Next in order of Importance
is the scheme for limited subsidies which is
embodied in one of the bills. A subsidy or a
bounty is thing which in general is viewed
with some suspicion as involving kind of
invidous discrimination to which the people
of this country are naturally averse. But in
this case we believe that no occasion for COM
plant will be found. Instead of subsidizing
particular lines, or particular classes of YES
sells, aid proportioned to their requirements, is
granted to all. The section of the proposed
act declaratory of the law already establish
ed by a decision of the Supreme Court, forbid
ding the collection of every species of tax or
dues by State or municipal authority, will re-
move nuisance for the existence of which
there is no longer any excuse and will afford
considerable relief The proposed amend
ments TO the law relating to tonnage dues are
nicely calculated to make that tax bear eoui-
table upon all classes of American vessels,
giving the most relief where it is most need
ed.


1t is to be hoped that the Jealousy of the
South and West will not devise obstacles to
the enactment ofthese enlightened measures.
So far as we can judge from the expressions
of opinion on the part of the organs of both
political parties there is in the Eastern States
entire unanimity in their favor. A few ex-
tracts from our exchanges will show how the
report has been received:


We repeat that the report is able and ex-
haustlve. 1t ought to carry conviction and
secure the passage of the bills recommended
by the Committee. Mr.. Lynch and other mem
bers Ut the Committee, certainly merit the
thanks OF commercial men and the country.
for their patient and persevering labors in
presenting this whole subject in So clear
light and in proposing measures so well calcu-
iated TO revive and restore our commerce to
Its foimer prosperity and prestee.-Argus.


The most dT1ncuTt task OF all was allotted
to this committee, inasmuch as it was required
to weigh the innumerable remedies offered.
and to find sufficient reasons for accepting
those which were approved. as well as for re-
iecting those which were found wanting. The
members were confronted at the threshold by
patent devices, warran ted to cure or no charge:
ther were compelled 10 examine the yery
groundwork of our navigation laws, the whole
economy OF legislation, so far as it could affect
the building and sailing of ships, and the en-
couragement OF foreign trade, was in one form
or another brought before them. 1t is little
to say that, considering the magnitude of the
task, they have performed it with excellent
Judgment and wisdom.-Boston Aduertiser.

merce is interesting, and its investigation of
the causes OF its decline is Instructive; and as
a whole, it will command wide and atten- |

circumstances that have come to light since the
day of the election there is no doubt that had
Sheriff Richardson not been present at the scene
OF the riot in the evening, the affair would have
been far more serious, and perhaps the lives of a
number of innocent persons would have been
sacrificed. At the peril of his own life, the COM
batants were repeatedly enioined to desist by
him, when bullets whistled thick and fast above
his head. Two small bullet holes are distinctly
left in his vest, one on either side of the chest.
He was twice knocked or forced down, and while
on the ground one negro was about to bayonct
him, when another negro interfered and prevent
ed it, claiming that the Sheriff was there to pro-
tect both parties. 1t was about this time that
Mr.. Poynter was shot and beaten. The Sheriff
endeavored to protect the unfortunate man from
further violence and assisted to get him out of
the street. When the Sheriff requested the ne
gro Day to take his men away, the brutal reply
to the officer was /"" take your own men away""
The Sheriff was the leader of no blood-thirsty
gang and had no men to take away He was
endeavoring to persuade all to leave the street
| and go home. 1t is said that the negroes had
| some fifteen to twenty muskets beside many pis-
tolls and other weapons. 1t will thus be under
stood that the negroes were furnished with arms
from some source, and had them ready for action.
During the melee, it is said they were lead to their
headquarters corner of 9th and Walnut, by
| Day, and returned to renew the riot with these
deadly weapons; and it was after their return
that they encountered the Sheriff and Mr.. Poyn-
ter. The latter is not yet considered out of
danger, his life having been despaired of for sew
ally days.


| The riot is disgrace to the city, and was un-
doubtedly caused by Radical politicians, while
Radical policemen were, to say the least, indif-
ferent to their duty Gazette.


A SERIES OF RoBBERIEs DIscoyERrD-Mr. E. R.
Cochran having had rails stolen from his
stack-yard, has had an officer on the watch for
some two weeks past, who had not detected any
one until Monday last. Mary Cooper, colored,
who moved into one of Mr.. George Dcrrickson's s
houses without his permission, and refused to go
| out again, was on that day put out by officer
Jones' In moving her goods Mr.. Jones found
some of the rails that had been stolen from Mr..
Cochran. He arrested her and took her before
| Esquire Walker, where she confessed the crime
and made statements which led to the search of
Edward Keys house. Here they also found
rails, and besides lot of dishes &C., that had
disappeared from the hotel Of George w 9. Zip.
In questioning Keys folks in regard to how
these things ciiiie rnere it was found that Ara
minta Goodwin, living near Drummond's mill
was also in the business. She was also arrested
and taken before Esquire Walker, and confessed
to having stolen from Mr.. Ortlip, bed-quilts,
blankets, clothing, tin-pans, &c. She was COM
mitted TO New Castle Jail in default of 5000 bail.

SuIcIDE.-Mr. James L. Bewley, of the firm of
James L. Bewleo Co., commission m ,rchants,
doing business at No. 4o4 South Delaware Ave
nue. Philadelphia, committed suicide on Friday
evening last. He was on visit to his brother,

the report of pistol was heard and the family

floor in the last agonies of death, having shot
himself through the heart. On stand near by,
his revolver was lying, and some of his friends
are inclined TO think his death may have been
the result of an accident If suicide, no cause
is known for the commission of the act. The
deceased was well known in this section of
| country. He was born in Smyrna, Del in 1915
and went to Philadelphia in 1855. The Phila-
delphia Age says Mr.. B. was an active mem-
Der of the Commercial Exchange and numerous
other organizations, and commanded the respect
of all with whom lie came in contact, for his
uniform urbanity, his liberality and answering
integrity.


A MYsTERY.-0ne day last week, Mr.. Steven
Hazard was having the United States Hotel, al
Lewes, cleaned out preparatory to taking posses
sion of the institution as landlord. On entering
a room which had remained unoccuped since
last summer, he noticed blanket rolled up, ly-
ing on the floor and at once picked it up and
proceeded to open it to see what it contained
What was his astonishment on behoding its con-
tents 1.-The dead and decayed body of an infant
placed there by some inhuman hands. 1t was q
white child, and it is supposed was left there by
some visitor at the hotel during tho season. liz
discovery of course created considerable excite
ment, WHICH was greatly increased when the fact
became known that the remains of another child
had been discovered in an old basket in the attic
OF course 1t is more than probable that the mys
nsrho do flna al.
mains is likely to min unsolved, and by whom
and under what circumstances the children wer,
placed there, must be left to conjecture Autua

The Speaker announced that according to

taken on the various amendments to the sec
tons relating to the income tax.

Amendments making the exemption $1,000,
limiting the allowance for house rent TO $500

to add to exemption losses by flood; Mr.. Ella s,

Mr. Burchard's, providing that assessors shall
require all returns to be verified under oath
and may increase the amount of return upon
notice to the party that they have reason to
believe that the income is understated, were
severally agreed to; and Mr.. McCarty's, to
strike out all the sections relating to the in
come tax, was rejected-59 to 1913 All the
other pending amendments having been re-
Jected, the question required On Mr. Beck S
amendment, to include United States bonds
among those of corporations from which the
tax is to be deducted.


Mr.. Schenck, of Ohio, argued at length
against the proposition, claiming that it would
really subject the interest on bonds to double
tax, as the income from them was required to
be included in the income returns and that the
scheme was practical reputation.


Mr.; Butler, of Massachusetts, supported Mr..
Becks amendment, and proposed also that the
interest ON town, county and State bonds be
taxed in the same manner. They were not
taxed now. 1t was only the consciences of the
men holding those bonds that were taxed, and
he was sorry to say that conscience had not
been very prolific source of profit. Every
honest man now paid a tax on his income from
these bonds, and the obiecG was to make the
rogues pay also. The Committee on Ways
and Means had provided by the bill to tax saw
ings banks, thus taxing the pittance of
serving girls, widows and orphans,
but excused from taxation $21 900 100000 of
United States bond9. Now were the members
to 60 to the people with that proposition? Not
he, for one. Might his right hand forget its
cunning if he did. Had the United States
pledged their faith that these bonds should not
be taxed? They had not. No man, not even
the broker who sold any of these bonds, had
done SO. If the United States had agreed not
to tax these bonds he would sit down.


Mr.. BentOn-Did We not agree to pay the
amount specified ON the bond and interest?
Mr.. Bntler-Yes, sir; and we are going to do
1t, and then we are going to collect the tax on
1t, SO that the rascals who hold these bonds
and do not pay tax on the interest shall not
cheat us.


The discussion was continued, Mr.. Eldridge,
OF Wisconsin, coming to the aid of Messrs.
Butler and Beck, and the amendment was
finally rejected-78 to no.


MIR. Brooks OF New York offered an amend
ment to one of the sections of the provision
10 feduce the tariff on sugar and salt 80 per
cent; on coffee and tea 20 per cent; and on pig
and scrap iron % IL per cent.


MIR. Eldridge of Wisconsin made point of
order that the tariff provisions was not in Or
der TO the internal revenue bill. Il was UNDER
STOOD That this movement was an attempt to
shut out the tariff bill, which Mr.. ScheHck
proposes to attach to the pending measure
After the discussion the Speaker decided that
the amendment was in order, saying the prac-
tice contormed to that of the British paria-
ment and of the early legislation of Congress
put not wishing to force his own judgment on
the House submitted the question to a vote.-
Tue House decided, liz to 35, that the amend
ment was germane to the BILL but the Speaker
ruled that it could not be offered to the pend

question, but without dsposing of tile motion

were shocked by the report of "" horrible out
""roc cein Harlem.n A girl of thirteen years of age
,node affidavit in one of the Courts that certain
man whom she named had induced her to enter
n shanty, where she was subjected TO force'
and violated under the most cruel and shock
ing circumstances. The accused was arrested
and incarcerated to await trial; and the mdlg-
nation of the people of Harlem against hlm
was 80 great that the reporter declared he
would have been lynched if he had fallen into
tbeir hands. When the case came up for trial
on Tuesday last, the complainant, on exami-
nation. declared that all her previous state
ments were false, that the outrage never took
place, and that she had been induced 10 make
the complaint by other persons. Whereupon
tbe man who had been accused was honor
1"" ably discharged by the Court.


But is there to be no penalty for the real
culprit in this case, who not only committed
periury. but who charged man with crime
of which she now says he is guiltless-a crime
for which he would doubtless have been Sc
verely punished if she had persisted in her
original falsehood, and for which, as 1T was,
he suffered Imprisonment for nearly ten weeks
while awaiting trial There could scarcely be
a more wicked or atrocious otfense than that
of which this girl was guilty; and she, as well
as the persons who induced her TO commit
perjury, should be severely dealt with by the
law. We trust the case will be investigated
and prosecuted. We have been led to believe
from the developments in several analogous
trials of late years, that this case is not with
L., in
which conviction has followed trial on SINH
larly false charges but in which the truth did
not appear ill it was too late to remit the
penalty. These bad girls who are induced by
base persons to peEjure themselves as a means
of extorting money, or crushing some wretched
victim, should be taught that they are guilty
of crime which is followed by severe retri-
button We should think there need be no
difficulty in getting hold of the persons who
were in connivance with Mary Matilda White."

monize the action of the two houses on sections

WASHINGTON. Tuesday, Dec G, 1870


The Senate today remained in session but half an hour
Nothing Of any interest done. Notice was given OF
another bill 10 repeal the Income Tax, making the thru
already introduced for that purpose.
The first bill introduced into the House during this
session was abolish the Income Tax and the Hon.
John Hill OF NewJersey had the honor OF presenting IT,
After the admission Of several new members, fuil nan
hour was wasted in dlsposing OF proposition made by
some members who don't like the seats they occupy 10
provide for a new drawing tomorrow. The resolution
was tabled The regular order during the morning hour
in the House to-day joint resolution reported from
the Committee Public Lands in July last, by MT.
Wilson OF Minnesota, to land grant TO railroad
now building from Madison, Wis., to Lake st. CroI and
Lake Superior. This is the first whole host OF similar
propositions looking a division Of the public domain
among railroad corporations and 1t caused generai
waking up not only among those who are determined 10
defeat all such Jobs, but among those also who have
similar schemes TO advocate. The resolution was OPP
posed by Messrs Ella, Julian, Lawrence, and Wood,
the frst-named gentleman proposing an amendment 10
make similar grants to railroads In New-Hamp-
shire which the people think OF building. At engthit
was voted TO lay the matter the table-Yeas, sG Nays
s but the friends Of the resolution were not content 10
leave there and motion to lay motion to reconsider
on the table, and cnch the defeat OF the Dill was Iost
by vote of so 10 49, Then it was proposed 10 pospe
the reconsideration the opponents OF the resolution
named the last Thursday in February and the 4th OF
March as good days consider It, It's friends however,
succeeded in fixing next Tuesday as the day. There are
two interests favOrinR this resolution In the H0use-he
delegation from Wisconsin, and some others who arc
opposed principle 10 any more land grants Du1 OeeEe

Congress- for larger grus, wish TO make precedent,
and unite their strength this resolution as being one
10 which the least objection can be made. strong op
position is expected when the matter comes up again
next Tuesday Gen. Logan introduced to-day his Dill 10
abolish the offices Of Admiral and NieeAdmiraI In the
Navy and asked for its immediate passage Objection
was made, and Gen. Logan then announced that ne
would call IL up again on Monday and demand its pas
sage under q suspension Of the rules. Gen. Logan Is
very confident that his bill Will pass, and says that ne
docs not expect than 25 votes against in the
House. Mr.. Lynchs bill for the revival OF American
shipping to which much opposition was made during
the last session. and which finally referred back to
the special committee reported again to-day with
many OF the points to which the most objection
was made greatly modified, and Mr.. Schenek moved
TO commit it 20 the Committee Commerce. The Dill as
now reported proposes TO restrict the drawbacks and re-
bates Of vessels employed in the foreign trade, restricts
bountes offered for building vessels to ships Of 1000 tuns

three months in the American coasting trade, owners

mittee Commerce, with the consent OF Mr' Lyhch,
who is in favor of conference of the Commerce, Ways
and Means, and Special Committees Gen. Garfield Tor

tract with The Congressional GLOBE as to prevent

circular signed by all the delegation from Wisconsin
except One advocating the passage Of the resolution
granting land to the railroad TO be built from Madison 10
Lake Superior, distributed among members OF the
House to-day. This is a common practice among lobby
lists but it believed that Congressman have not before
resorted to il.


For several months before the adjournment Of the last
session OF the House, the Judiciary Committee did not
have opportunity to report on the business before it,
The result is, there is a large amount Of legislation
which II will recommend whenever the Committee Is
called The first of interest is bill TO repeal the Eight
Hour law The Committee have agreed to report favor
ably and Mr.. Kerr will present the report. He is at
present at home sick. The next bill to empower the
President to accept the resignation Of any United States
Judge and grant him full pay for life. Mr Butler will
present the Committees report In favor OF the bill This
is understood TO be urged in behalf OF some Judges who
are no longer able TO perform their duties from age or
other causes and IA thought by members OF the Commit
tee and Others that ChiefJustice Chase will avail him
self OF the BILL in case it determined by his physicians
that IL would be unsafe for him TO continue his duties
The bill to repeal the Law requiring new Congress to
assemble on the 4th OF March once agreed TO

delay. He contended that the Mormon outrages
would not cease until the United States adopted

The country had expended milli ms of money

Pacific telegraph cable. 1t incorporates the
Pacific Submarine Company, and grants IL a
subsidy Of five hundred thousand dollars
year for twenty years, after the completion Of
teiegraphic communication to China and
Japan. When this line is completed Puck's
work will be done. A girdle will be put round
the earth in forty minutes, and it will be a
grdle of such intelligence as Puck himself
never dreamed of. The executive session of
the Senate was devoted mainly to the discus
sion of reciprocity treaty with the Sand
wich Islands, and an evening session was held,
in which private bill was passed over the
Presidents veto--the first case OF the kind
during the present administration.


The shipping interest bill was proceeded
with in the House, and the previous question
was moved and ordered Mr.. Lynch pro-
ceeded to explain the merits of the bill, but
ments were rejected and the bill itself was
refused third reading and recommtted to
the Special Committee ON the Decline of
American Commerce. This ends all further
discussion of it for the present session, and
most likely consigns Mr.. Lynch's special plan
for reviving American commerce to the tomb
of the Capulets forever. This is to be re-
GREETED; but probably Mr.. Chandler's bill, just
introduced in the Senate, may be more accept
able to the inland members, and consequently
more likely to pass. The Internal Tax bill
was next taken up and discussed, but without
any important action."

Yesterday, in which the State Of
Mississippi as the prosecutor Of j..
d. Werles, Jr., (colOred) on the
charge Of larceny. The voluntary
statement of Werles throws some
light on the way the ""trOoly lOil,"" ""
takes possession of the peoples
property, as follows:


About q month ago, w. II. Fur.
Miss, then clerk to the Secretary Of
State, gave Werlcs three sets of
Mississippi Reports, running from
vol. 8 Smedes aud Marshall, to the
4lst vol. inclusive. Asked Werles
to box up one set and send to the
Hon. J. N Langslon (colOred,) Prof
Law, Howard University, Wash
ington, d. c., one sci for himself
{ (Werles) and one set for Furniss.
Boxed up one set for LangstOn, but
had no cover for the box and left
it in his room; took his own set
there also, and sent Furniss' set by
a boy named Willie Howard, to
Furniss' house afterward sold his,
{ Werles) to Capt. Cass, for $50.
These books were brought by two
parties from the archieves room Of
the Secretary OF State, and deliver
ed TO Werles in the Library. Was
in the room with Furniss when he
got the books down. Werles con-
suited none of the State officers re-
lative to the matter.


On the lst of October, he sold to
q man named Stevenson a lot Of
old iron aud rubbish, (inuluding.twO
eagles frOm the Capitol gate, val
ued at S50) from the Capitol, for
which he received the sum of IS.


Capt. Cass was the first witness
called, who testified to having pur-
chased from and paid Werles, $50,
for the set of books referred to, but
at the same time thought they were
worth SO per volume. Cass the same
day, Qsst tuesday, informed the
Governor of the transaction.


James Lynch, Secretary of State,
testified that books in the archives
room were the property of the
State aud that Mississippi reports
were worth IS per volume. Knew
nothing of the removal ofany books
from there. Furniss was his Clerk
up to the 9Th of September last, and
in that capacity had access to the
room indicated. Werles had in
courtesy been allowed to go in aud
out of the room at pleasure, owing
to his position as Librarian.


Gov. Alcorn testified that infor-
nation of the sale Of certain books
had been conveyed to him. Sent
for Werles who acknowledged that
he had sold the books TO Cass
Governor asked where he got the
books, when Werles in a detinanI
manner said he didn't care to tell
us they were his own property
The Governor said he would find d
way to make him tell, aud sent fol-
the Sheriff. Werles then became
some hat nervous and told how he
came in possession OF the books.


Judge Tarbell frequently missed
Pbooks from the Library, certain
books that he had seen there and
when he would want them fer re-
ference they could not be found
Several books had been seriptitiOus'
lly removed from the consulting
room of the supreme Court tC
which room Werles had access
For three months past the matter
has given him especial annoyance
and had frequently spoken tC
Werlcs on the subject and only wal
waiting for u meeting Of the Libra
ry Trustees to investigate the mat
ter.


Two complete sets of reports
were brought into Court by tn,

From BussOrah up the river to Bagdad there are

On the alst OF March. in nay correspondence for
warded by the Patagonia, furnished translation OF
the only Official dispatches received up TO that time
relative 10 the closing of the Paraguayan war.
To-day. however, am enabled to send the official
report OF the brigadier general who executed the
operations which resulted inthe surprise and death
OF Lopez and with this reportthe Paraguayan war
passes from the province OF your correspondent to
The domain OF the historian.


When Lopez left his camp near Panadero, apna-
yently forced thence by the exhaustion oil the wild
oranges and palm trees upon which his followers
mainly subslsed, he abandoned all his sick and the
majority of the women. and hid away the heavy
cannon he had al river ford few miles off, And,
In regard to hidden cannon, some.twenty or thirty
are believed 10 have been buried ut Ascurra, and
many others at various places but the allies have
been able TO discover any OF them, SO well the
secrer has been kept.


On leaving Panadero Lopez continued his march
northward along the east side OF the mountains Of
Maracaju, the Brazilians call them. on Amambahy
rs they are known to the Paraguayans. He appears
TO have had about 1900 persons with him, twenty
small cannon and twenty or thirty Carts conveying
money, some food Tor Lopez and his train,
some arms and q little ammunition. His
draught oxen were feY and they were obliged
TO be sent backward and forward to bring
mp the carts and cannon. Lopez and his
immediate suite had their store ofluxuries but lived
chiefly on the milk OF some ,siXteencows belonging
to Mrs. Lynch, and the remainder Of his followers
had 10 fnd their food in the woods, supplemented
by q little beef whenever q steer broke down and
could not work. All who could not keep up were
left to their doom OF starvation and toward
the last oil who could not travel and hunt for food
An the woods were put to death, without exception


Soon after Lopez started from Papadero to march
nWthward the news reached General Camara, then
at the Paraguay, at Conception, remounting his
cavalry and re1tting. This general at once con-
ceived the idea that Lopez's aim was TO reach the
abandoned Brazilian village and fort OF Dourados,
In MatO Crosse, where some cattle could be got
Douiad lay about $50 miles to the north OF Pana-
dero and about $50 rr0m Conception. General Ca
mara with some 1900 cavalry, Infantry and
artillery, determined to set out with forced
marches along the diagonal to Dourados
while similar force, to set out later, was
to strike the bush road, which Lopez was NOV
ing along, and 10 keep close behind him, harassing
his rear but avoiding an engagement, SO that when
Lopez would reach Dourados both the Brazilian
corps would be close to him and could strike dec-
sive blow with superior numbers.


Accordingly General Camara marched northward
towards the Paraguayan fort OF Bella Vista, on the
frontier, occupied by o Brazilian brigade, placed
there to guard the Apa country which he purposed
to unite with his, and take on to Dourados. How
ever, when not far from Bella Vista, he got word
from the commander there that Lopez had not con-
tlnued on she road to Dourados, but had left it aud

was frightful, and in few minutes it was saure

the stream beyond which was the thicket he threw
himself from his horse, waded it, but was SO ex-
hausted that he fell half fainting on the opposite
bank. There the Brazilian general summoned him



ordered him to be disarmed, which was scarcely
done when Lopez died. Near by shallow grave
was dug for him; but on Mrs. Lynch being brought
back with the body Of their son, Colonel Francisco

attempted TO murder on the night fthe 27th Of April.
The meeting was first addressed by District Judge

for vigilance committees had passed. and advising
the people TO disper9e.


The meeting was then addressed by several OF the
leading citizens, who assisted that IL necessary

band OF outlaws known to exist In the community,
and that immediate ana decisive action should be
taken In the present case.


The meeting tnen selected a committee OF treaty,

before the committee the prisoners confessed their
crime, from which IL appears that the robbesy and
murder or MI Leuhart was deliberately planned by
them.


At two O'Clock, p. NJ, the commtte reported that
both the prisoners were guilty, and sentenced them
10 be hanged at half-past four O'Clock, p NJ. At

Amendment, tho Revival of the Shipping


Interests and tho Reduction OF the Navy.


The bill to enforce the fifteenth amendment,
which has been the fruitful theme of great
mass Of familiar buncombe from Senators
lately, was laid aside yesterday, and the House
bill on the same subject was taken up. We
fear the verbose Senators hoped to make even
this slight change pretext for another dis.
play of garrulousness. There Is not enough
difference between the two to require new
argument; but Senator'S have long since got
beyond the point when they cared to say any
thing new. They are content--nay, happy
now to say anything. In this particular case
they found the pretext not sufficient, and after
short discussion returned to the original
Senate bill and rediscuss,d it all the after
noon. In the evening Mr.. Cragin had special
benefit rendered him--that is, special even
ing session ordered for him-and he de-
livered long argument iavoring the anti
polygamy bill to the usual appreciative
audience.


The bill to revive American navigation and
commercial interests reported by Mr.. Lynch
was ably discussed in the House. Mr.. Butler
argued that the way to protect American
shipping was to reduce the tariff rates on
goods brought in American bottoms twenty
per cent in wooden and twenty-five per cent
in iron ships. He did not fear retaliation,
which, he said, would only inure to the profit
Of the country. Mr.. Calkin believed In Sc
curely protecting the shipbuilding interest and
thought drawback Of duty on all shipbuild-
ing material would serve the purpose. He
thought the profit in building heavy iron ships
and the great advantages gained by in
creased employment for mechanics should
not be lost. The whole question is merely one
of competition. Sailing ships have had their
day, and as long as iron steamers can be built
cheapest on the Clyde they will be built there
by American shipowners. The bill went over
on the expiration OF the morning hour The
Naval Appropriation bill was then taken up in
Committee of the Whole, Mr.. Eldridge, demo-
crat, in the chair. The first paragraph,
amended SO as to reduce the pay Of officers,
was agreed to by yeas sc, nays 20. A pro-
position to increase the number of men to ten
thousand was rejected. Thus it seems the
House is determined to treat our navy even
more scurvily than it did our army. A good and
efficient navy is especially necessary to main
tain proper standing among nations either
in war or peace, much more 80 than large
army. AS it is even now our naval officers
and our ships of war fail to present the
imposing appearance that the dignity Of the
nation demands on foreign stations, especially
in monarchical and half-civifized countries,
where the pres,qes q formidable men-of-war
is the only protection soWeimes y 9qr citi-
zeus. It must be remembered that our naval
officers abroad are the direct supporters Of our
representatives abroad. The bill was discussed
very quickly in committee and passed in the
House with these amendments. We look TO
the Senate, which is more conservative on
these matters, to prevent such evil legislation."

pistol for her brother, and on her return with It
was shot and badly wounded. Another daughter,

For the IMddletown Transcript.
View from the Town Hall Steeple.",by PORTE CRAYoN.,"Travellers who have clambered up to
mountain SUBMITS, have spoken of pc
culiar sense of elevation which they have
experienced. They have felt themselves
above the grovelling things beneath them,
and have gazed up at the blue heavens
above them, and down upon all below,
with sense of superiority attributable
alone to their altitude. This is the expe-
rence of all persons, whether standing
upon mountain-heights or upon pnnacles
reared by the hand of man. Why it is so,
I cannot explain. l do not attempt to
give the philosophy of this feeling-I only
state the fact of its existence.


just that same kind of feeling came
over me, on recent occasion, when /
assembled the stecple of the Town Hall,
and gazed abroad upon the lovely land
scape spread out before me like vast
panorama, gladdening the eyes and filling
the mind with rapture and delight. At
ones feet lies the town, with its hive-like
activity, its industrious citizens with me-
tropolitan air, hurrying scurrying along
the pavements, intent on business, and
the wheels of passing vehicles continually
rumbling upon ones ears.


Looking eastward the observer sees the
pretty town of Odessa, and the modest
spire of Drawyer's Presbyterian Church,
pointing toward the heavens. Its orderly
and dignifed inhabitants are at ease in
their possessions, and an air of comfort
and competence pervades the place. South
of the town winds the tortuous Appoquin-
mink, with its long poetic name and
beyond are the rising grounds around
McDonough, the field of vision stretching
towards St. Georges, and away to the
broad bosom of the Delaware. One may
count the white sails of the rich argosies
afoat upon its ripping waves, bearing the
commodities of commerce, from port to
port, to meet the ever active demands of
trade.


The eye, sweeping northward, is next
arrested by Iron Mountain, or Iron Hill,
as it is more Familiarity known, just beyond
the little village of Glasgow. This is the
highest point upon the peninsula, and is
computed to be from three to five hundred
feet above tide This elevation is remark
able for the quantity and the quality of its
iron ORE It is tunneled for considera-
BILE distance, and tho ore is brought out
in little iron cars on q railway, conveyed
to Newark in mule wagons, and sent by
railroad to Principle Furnace, where it is
smelted and prepared for use. Three
miles distant is another elevation known
as Gray's Hill, upon the summit of which
is farm house distinctly visible to the
naked eye. A mile and half west of this
last named bill, lies the town of Elkton,
hidden from view by intervening forest,
but the vision ranges beyond, to the blue
hills of the Susquehanna, sixteen miles
distant, and northwest to the irregular
outline of the elevations which constitute
the chief geological features of the region
known as Elk Neck, lying between the
North East and Elk rivers. These hills
bound the vision in that direction.


Circumscribing the view, and looking
northeast by north, northwest, in nautical
parlance, the eye falls upon many we'll
cultivated fields, neat and commodious
farm-houses. closely trimmed hedge-rows
of Usage Orange, and expansive Peach
Orchards, which constitute the leading
features of the landscape in all this region.
At this season of the year, before the
trees have donned their foliage, many res
licences can be seen which in summer are
hid from view. Looking east northeast,
the dwellings of Serick Il. Shallcross, R.
T. Cochran, Thomas Cochran, and Au-
gustus Nowland, Eos. are distinctly seen.
And, nearer still, the beautiful farms and
farm houses of Messrs. VIM. A. Cochran,
r. W. Cochran, Samuel Pennington, and
Messrs. Vail, Allston, Willis, Merritt,
and others. North, lie the beautiful resi-
dences of Mr.. VIM. Brady, Mr.. Vanhikle
and Messrs. r. r. Cochran, Hayes, Bur-
roughs and others. Northwest and west
the view is bounded by the forests of Mid
die Neck, Sassafras Neck, and the region
around Warwick. Within those points
lie the fertile lands of thd Messrs. Der
rickson, Murphey, Hoffecker, Polk, and
others, which cannot be so we'll discerned
from this point of view. Within nearer
range stands the fine mansion of John P.
Cochran, Esq. and around him are planted
his four sons, all conveniently and pleas
antly located, on good farms, with COM
modious dwellings, and ornate grounds
and shrubbery. Beyond are the beautiful
residences of Messrs. Amos W. Lynch,
| Is. Il. hanson, JameS haneiy, ooSeph
Roberts, and james Kanely, Jr. and in
their vicinity the fine farms of Mrs. NJ. E.
McCrone, Messrs. Price, Reynolds, Crock
EFT, and others.


Southwest and south, are the fine estates
of VIM. Wilson, DIR. Crawford, Henry
Davis, Joseph West, Benjamin Gibbs,
Robert A. Cochran, R. 7. Lockwood, L,
| CHM. Robert A. Cochran Jr. A. s, Nau-
dain, John Drummond, Ed. r. Cochran,
and VIM. Green, Esqs. all conveniently
located. highly improved, and very pro-
ductive. Truly may the inhabitants of
this region say-''the lines have fallen to
US in pleasant places gentlemen who
have travelled extensively, both in Europe
and America, have declared that they have
never seen region that could surpass it
| In beauty and fertility, Not the Gcnesee"

The Wnfo OF to-day has information Of a most dia-
bolical crime 10 Goochland county. A few days
since a colored girl, ageG nineteen, named Alice
Brown, was sent BY her father on an errand about
the distance of mile from her home in the evening,
ana falling to return during the night search was
at once instituted for her by the family and
friends. Next morning they found the body,
lying half hidden by branches OF pine, stripped,

from the road in the woods. suspicion was at once
directed to Henry Fife and Willis, two young negro
men employed on the farm where the body was
found ana they were both arrested by party Of
colored men and lodged in jail, after desperate
resistance Willis confesses the crime but states
that Henry committed the murder. The greatest
excitement prevails among the negroes In the

Desai.. Of .Ae Death OF Lepez.",,"Details of the Death Of Lopez.


| When Lopez was surprised by the Brazil
| ians he was mounted on q gray horse, and
| troetted along with two of his aides-1e-camp.
| all the rest of the party going on foot. This
war the only tieme in which the Brasilians
surprised the Dictator, The orderly of Colo
mel Tavares, the Brazilian commander. as


soon as he heard that the gray horseman was
Lopez, gave him blow with lance, which


wounded Lopez in the abdomen. AT the
same time others fred ct him and at his aides
de-camp, one of whom foil. having been wound
| ed in the head. This was Caminos. one Of
Lopez ministers. Although wounded again
Lopez continued to ride at half gallop towards
the woods near BY. just ut the enterance of
this wood lay great swamp. wherein the
| Presidents horse began 10 sink. To avoid
any delay in his flight Lopez dsmounted rap
idly. took off his blouse, and disappeared


amang the trees.


| General Camara was then approaching. and
| was told by Major that Lopez was there.
The General doubted it, but dismountef and
penetrated into the wood. and found Lopez


crossing a stream and endeavoriEg to reach


the opposite bank. General Camara entered
the stream. and when at short distance from
Lopez, said to him, ""Surrender, Marshal;


am the Brazilian commander"" As an an


swer, Lopez fired shot in the direction Of
Camara, and, as he reached the bank. fell
on his knees exhausted In half minute


more Camara stood near him. and ordered o


soldier uf the Ninth Infantry to disarm Lopez.


Lopez did not quietly surrender, but strug-
gled With the soldier for some time.


At the same moment a soldier of the caval-


rv came up, and seeing the hard struggle,
fred at Lopez. the ball entering his heart.


The Dictator fell down, and in ten minutes


more he was dead.


When Lopez was killed his feet were in the


water, his body lying up the bank of the


stream. He wore blue pantaloons. with a


golden stripe, very hue shirt-waist. and


melico boots. His hat had been lost. In the


rocket of his waistcoat gold watch was
found; on one of its covers was beautiful


engraving of his monogram, F. S. L.. and on
the other there were the arms of Paraguay.
viz: Phrygian cap, supported by a sword
that rests near the vanquished lion of CASTLE.
the words. Paz Justicia an the top. and Re


pu5lica del Paraguay below. The pockets of


his blouse were also searched. and the only


things found were two penholders, some note


paper, and an ivory ring. with the customary


inscription, Tincir on Norir.


The Lopez family were going another road


in two carts, Mrs. Lynch and children occu-


ry;ng one and Lopez's mother and sister an
other-this one being very rude one, and
the other being escorted by a'guaTd of SOL
diers. When Lieutenant-Co Colonel Martins
met Mrs. Lynch's ,arty. Col. P. Lopez 10 son
of the Dictator, Is years old( did not obey


the order to surrender. as the rest of the par


ty did; hut with lances and revoler offered


most serious resistance. After some shots


had been fred by him. Col. Martins exhaust


ed his patience and killed the young man


with his sword. Then Mrs. Lynch descend


ed from her carriage and laid her sons dead


BODY on the front seat nf It. She wept bitter


ly. invoking ""Panchito Panchito!"" and


opening his eyes while saying this. Mrs.


LYNCH wore a black satin dress with trim
mings and fiounces of white satin. Her hair
vas dressed as is for sniree. On one of her
fingers glittered four rings which sparkled
with diamonds. The mother and sisters Oh
Lopez, when taken, were in one wooden cart,
on their knees. tharking Providence fyr the
tyrant's death. and Lietenant Murizo had re-
ceived instructions to lance her, in case of be-
ing overtaken by the enemy.


Il is horrible to consider the reason why
the Dictator had proposed himself to commit
such nefarious crime. When Lopez was
still at Panadero his mother was accused by
certain woman. the wife of Marco (who
was whipped daily, of having planned the
death of his son by means of poison. that was
to be given him in the form Of candy in ap-
preaching fes.a. Lopez Immediately SUM-
moned conncil, composed Of Resqnin, Del


gado. Falcon, Cavelleri. Presilen Maez and
Aveiro. Every member of this so-called coun-
ell. except one. pronounced the story mere
fabrication: but Lopez. hearing of the result
of the investigation. exclaimed. 'sAveiro is
nv only FRIEND"" and ordered him to collect
all evidence bearing on the case. 1t is use
less to say that this Infamous Aveiro compli
ed with the wished of his master, and did it
50 strictly that he quite often slapped the face


OF the old woman md beat her with his


sword. As consequence If this, Senorita
GARLIC was condemned to death, and the mat
ricidal hand of the tyrant appended to the


sentence, the cumprd-se of his authority.
1t is believed that this ferocious disposition


in the character Of Lopez toward his own


mother was impressed on him by the influ-


ence of Mrs. Lynch. who could never forgive


her disapproval of her Mrs. Lynch'sl rela-


tion to her son. This story was referred to
the Count d'Eu bv the lady herself. in the


presence of MANY Brazilian officers, soldiers,


and a number of Paragoayans.


few minutes after the Imprisonment OF


Mrs. Lynch and the death of her dear PAN
cho. the hody of Ell Supreme was brought in


lie had four wounds and was harefoosed; his
feet were the admiration of those surround.
ing the BODY. such was their delicacy and
fneness. While anxiously contemplating
the remnants of the man that for FIVE years


had dist1rhed the peace Of four nations for


bis own selfish sake. some Paraguayan wo-


men who accompanied the party began to
dance around the body. Colonel Paranhos
ordered these furies to get of. and the body


to be inferred with thatof Pancho. as request
ed by Mrs. Lynch. Meanwhile Mrs. Lynch
and several Brazilian officers cut Lopez hair,
the Brazilians dividing itamong their friends.
All officers Of tie Brazilians agree that


Mrs Lynch is charming dangerous woman.


The behavior after the death of hrr paramour


has been tempered with high time OF DELI
cacy and hangtiness. 1.-THE Marshal died as
a hero and the Chief of State ought to die. -

While biz own Ministers depended only for

the Marshal was a glutton; his statement is
corrobnrated by his Minister'S, now in the


hands of the Allies.


In tent lined with fine damask, and car

The Bishop was introduced by DR.. Anderson ana
IN his opening remarks drew vivid picture of the
gigantic and desperate war now raging between two

personal charity. Open-heartedness and OPEN

the lists are opened and astonishing amounts raised

WASHINGTON, May 17-Mr Cameccp, il
presenting memorial for the general aboli
ton of taxation on productions said he though
the first duty Of Congress was to reduce th,
taxes now when our bonds were at par Fl,
should be taxed upon their labor. He woul,
favor to great extent the substitution of ex-
ternai for internal taxes; and above all the ab
oltion OF taxes on incomes.


Mr.. Howard, from the Committee on the
Pacific railroad reported substitute for the
Marshal and San Diego railroad which he ex
planned was to authorize railroad from Mar
shall, Texas, to Trinity river, thence to e
Paso on the Rio Grande, and thence through
Territories and across the Colorado river Il
San Diego on the Pacific. The bill grants
twenty alternate sections of land OF each sid
of the line in the Territories and ten section
in any State through which the road nigh
pass. The bill was ordered to be printed and
placed upon the calendar


A session was ordered for Wednesday eve
ming to give Mr.. Cragin an opportunity for ad
dressng'the Senate upon the bill to provide fo
the execution of the laws in Utah.


A bill to relinquish the interest of Unite,
States in certain lands in San Francisco occu
pied the morning hour, it being passed after
lengthy discussion, and the Senate resumed
the consideration of the 18th amendment bill.


Mr.. Terry proposed a modification of hi
amendment, the purpose of which he stated t.
be to prevent the creating of any further polti
cal disabilities than now existed, and proceed
ed to reply at length to Mr.. Morton's speech O
Monday against the removal of DISABILITIES from
citizens of the South.


Mr.. Morton replied at length to Mr.. Terry
and was followed by Mr.. Sawyer, who con
denmed the system OF test oaths and proscrip
ton as contemplated in the bill.


Mr.. Revels having been called upon proceed
ed to define his position and that of the Re
publican party of Mississippi Upon the ques
tion OF general amnesty, he said he was in ia
vor of removing disabilities in the South JUS
as fast as its people gave evidence of loyalty
Wherever man gave this evidence by ceasin.
to denounce and oppose the laws of Congres
and by respecting them and laboring to carr,
them out he was in favor Of removing his disa
blities. II this could be truly said oi the Who'll,
State he would be in favor of the removal O
the disabilities of that State. In Mississippi
the Republican party had pledged itself to uni
versal amnesty and the legislature had re-
deemed that pledge by the passage of reso
luton asking Congress to remove the disabili-
ties of the citizens of that State, and -whinh- he
bad presented. The condition of things il
Mississippi was exceptional Lawlessenss and
violence prevailing in the other reconstructed
States did not exist there, but the people were
harmonious aud prosperous. He was in favor





given its pledge to that effect and the State
was fit for it,


During its discussion it was proposed to take
up the House bill on the subject which had
been received from that body, but objection
was made on the ground that the pending bill
committee while the House bill was defective.
After short executive session the Senate ad
journed.


HOUSE.


Mr.. Wood of New York addressed the House
on the bill to revive American commerce and
shipping, correcting what he characterized a
popular error, viz, that the foreign commerce
of the United States was on the decline. 1t
was not the foreign commerce of the United
States that was declining; it was the naviga-
ton interests of the United States that were
on the decline. The mistake was to comfOund
commerce with navigation. So far as the for
eign commerce is concerned, as shown by the
value of imports and exports and by their rela.
tive proportions, it was in q safe, sound and
satisfactory condition. What were the causes
that led to the decline of American tonnage?
The common idea was that it was attributable
to the depredations OF the Alabama. He ad-
mtted that it had some influence, but not to
the extent generally exposed. He assigned
several general operating causes for it, The
trst was the substitution of steamers for sail
ing vessels and iron for wood. The second
was economy in The reduction of tonnage in
consequence OF the substitution OF steam for
sails, one steamer being able to do the work of
three sailing vessels. The third was the over
production of ships from 1S4S to 1860, stimu-
lated by the discovery Of gold in California and
the trade to which it gave rise. The fourth
was the Influence of the navigation laws, in
which the United States is far behind all other
nations in the policy of refusing American
registers to foreign built vessels French
steamers were bought in England, and so were
r4r;oy oy,1 ft,ap ~
the Hamburg and Bremen lines =; but the navi-
cation laws Of the United States, founded on a
policy Of exclusion, stood at the threshold oil
American harbors and shut out foreign built
vessels from entering under the American flag.


Mr.. Lynch inquired whether the commercial
marine of England and the United States had
not obtained their highest point Of prosperity
under the very laws that the gentleman was
now cOndemning.


Mr. Wood of New York replied in the mega
tive and said that the gentleman's own report
answered his question. The fifth cause of the
decay of American tonnage was the transfer oi
American vessels to the Britis flag during
the late war. The transfer amounted to S33, 3Oa
tons, Dearly one-quarter of the aggregate ton.
mage of the United States. The next cause
was the depredations of privateers curing the
war, but the loss by that means did not exceed
100000 tons While he would hold England
to just responsibility in the matter, he would
not over-estmata or magnify the actual loss to
our tonnage. He hoped to live to see the day
when England would be compelled not only ia
make reparatiOn but restitution for the wrong.
The seventh cause was the appreciation OF the
cost of labor and materials, and in consequence
of the deprecated currency and heavy taxa
ton Was causing a large difference in The cost
of building and sailing ships


MIR. Wood then argued against the bill as en-.
tirely inadequate and Intellectual for the re.
moval of the difficulties which it sought tt
,s~IA
stimulate, but that was all. In his opinion the
true remedies were to be found in very gen
eral revival Of trade founded on sound basi.
with specie payment and currency, the aboli-
tion Of internal taxes and greater public ant
private economy. in new avenues of foreign
commerce, in the readmisson to America,
registry of American vessels which sought the
protection of foreign flags during the war, il
the modification of the navigation laws so a,

merchandise imported.


Mr.. Washburne, of Wisconsin, followed il
support of the report of the committee, afte
which the bill went over till tomorrow Mt
Lynch, of Maine, giving notice that he wou
ask for a vote on the bill on Thursday.


Mr.. Julian, of Indiana, asked leave to pre-
sent two petitions against Stephen j. Field
Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of th
United States, and Ogden Hoffman, j udge
yfacto of the United States for the district G
California, and praying that articles of im
peachment be presented against them


Mr.. Banks, of Massachusetts,, objected, an,
Mr.. Julian presented them under the nev
rule and had them referred to the Judiciar,
Committee.


The House then went into Committee of th
Whole on the naval appropriation bill, and wa
addressed by Mr. Hale, of Maine, in vindica
ton of the Navy Department.


Mr.. Morgan OF Ohio followed in condemna
tion of the navy department for having in vic
lation OF law paid to officers of the navy 33 L.
per cent in addition to their legal pay amount
ing to S3,70O,5O0. Mr.. Scofeld of Pa. remark
ed that the order of the Secretary of the Navy
under which that was paid was strictly ia ac
cOrdance with law.


Mr.. Morgan repeated the assertion and con
tradicted the statement of Mr.. Scofeld. H
denounced the extravaganza of the naval es
tablishment, showing the large disproportior

presentinI the order FIR the appointment OF
special Committee IL Investigate The paper
credit frauds, which we published in our Au-
gusta dispatches, Friday, Mr.. Hume, the young
and very able member from Cherryfeld, made
the following remarks:


Mr.. Hume said he considered this an import
ant matter to the State, and he begged leave to
trespass upon the time of the House for few
order


In 1868 the Legislature provided for a COM


mlttee upon assumption of war debts. That


committee met and performed lis labors, award


ing to the different towns of this State so


much money for three years men, so much for
Two years men, and so on. When the select
men came here to receive their bonds, which
had been adjudged to be due them from the
state Treasury by this commission, they found
various sums opposite the names of their towns
sent In from the Adiutant Generals ONCE
paid, as they supposed, every doliar oi laus 1he
! war debts They paid to brokers' ana otners
over $4,000, and they have tEelr receipts.


They raised three years ao aimat; ,hoie .nan one
| their war debt. They have been adjudged to
have so much money. They come here and
they find opposite the name of their town S4
400 sent in from the Adjutant Generals Office.


nc 'o""n VI Orrlngton is similar case and
the agent OF that town who came here and
tould e now the state OF affairs were, told his
ifiends that he hardly dared go home for fear


thaG the citizens might lynch him.


Inis is the condition of affairs. 1t might be


an right, but he thought the people Of this


state ought to know by what authority this


was DONE This commission have set. and in a


Iew days their report will be placed upon our
desks, and 1T will show the most damnable


schemes of villany that was ever known out of
hell 1t will show to the people of this State
That they have been robbed of tens of thous-
onds and hundreds of thousands of dollars
Ihe air Is filled with rumors of individual
rascallty, and the formation of firms foz the
carrying on OF the nefarious work-paper cred
IDS, navy commissions and such things
Strong men have fallen under the influence of


them, and he thought it time that we knew
the meaning OF these things. If the Republi-
can party has got men in it that are corrupt,


let us know it. The rank and the file of the
party are honest. They spent their treasure
and poured out their blood to maintain the su-
premacy OF the law and constitution. He be-
lieyed the record presented here to-day part
ana parcel OF the same villany, which the peo-
pie ought to know. He trusted the order
would receive a passage.


Mr. Hume was supported in his demand for
All Inyosugaeron ny MIR. Bonney, of this city,


both of the Adjutant General and State Treas


urer, by the Legislature, in relation to this


matter, but it had not been furnished. If this


committee was to be raised to investigate this


matter, he would let them have full power, SO


that the matter may be probed to the bottom."

One Mere Word About that whIR
Convention in October.",,"Convention in October.


The Raymond Gazette, the only
Wing paper of which we have any
knowledge in Mississippi that adj
vocates a meeting or convention
in October, dodges the question at
issue, runs off at q tangent, and
abuses the Democracy of years
ago, and reads many of the most
prominent gentlemen of the State
out ofthe party. The Major, for ""a
mid-mannered man"" grows furious
in his last issue, and for no other
reason save that the Wings of the
State won't commit the inexcusa-
BILE folly Of being pulled along by
two or three good-natured old
men into a Radical trap set by
AlCorn, Lynch & Co. Major
Harper must understand that the
bait was cautiously held out in
many places, and spurned by many
persons-that the white people of
the State have borne much and
borne patiently, but will never lick
the hand that heaped up the bur
dens upon them. Old issues that
can never be revived, past politi-
cal errors of omission or commits
sion, are of small import COM
pared to the outrages, oppression
and villainies perpetrated by the
party headed by Alcorn, Lynch,
Morgan d Co.


We can but smile at the thrusts
of the Gazette about our Wing
gerry! Fie, Major!-piease don't
read as ont.


In a previous article we began
with the honored name of Chief
Justice Sharkey, and went through

friend, Harper, says that he has
no recollection of ever seeing over

convention. Well, if Harper didn't
get acquitted with them, doubt
less they were not there, and for
the same reason are not good
Wings. Suppose we mention in
this connection q few more that
will not obey the behests and sug-
gestions Of the Gazette and Jack

Press of this morning (Juno SOY gives OF
the interesting proceedings ut tho District
Convention, not one word is said about
tho withdrawal of the York delegates.
On the contrary, it is distinctly stated in
the following extract of their report, tha,
no one did withdraw


Judge Davis novel that the convention pro-
ceed to ballot for candidate. Some confusion
ensuel and some Of the York County delegates
started 10 sccele, which was prevented 10y the
firm action Of the chairman and by the
protest Of Mr. Jefferson Sargent Of KeDncbunk,
who said that he should stand by the nominee,
whether his own personal preferences were graf.
ifed or not.


Some started to sccedc but were prcrcnt-
od by the firm action of the chairman
And this monstrous falschood the Press
attempts to palm of on its Portland read
crs with the same unblushing coldness
which has marked many proceeding state
mcnts relating to the York delegates, and
the fcelingin York County. Their princi-
pie seems to be that any means or repre-
scntations arc justifable whether true or
false TO win succcss-like tho father who
told his son rs he was starting out to act
for himself in life. ""John,"" said he, ""get
rich honestly if YOU can, 6m get rich""


1t is not surprising therefore that the
people here were not expecting any such
firm and decided action by the York dele
gates, and many feel that the ~iym per
sistenco of Mr.. Lynch and his paper and
his subordinate o flee holders have, in vio-
la,ing the rights of York rs conceded by
the convention of 1868 and by the usage
of the District, LEFT no other course To
men who had any regard for the success
of the party or their own self respect, ex-
cept that which the Y ork delegates adopted
with so much unanimity.

Tuesday night large number of York del
esates met at their headquarters at the Saeo
house. and consultel and deliberltei far into
the night before the battle. If no protest should
be made at the slaughter Of Old York which
was determined upon by the enemy, If land-
marks could be swept away at the breath OF
political adventurcr who was determined to be
nominated though he destroy the Republican
party. then it was seen that York would stultify
herself and be placed beyond the right of rec
ignition hereafter. except that which our Port
land masters should be graeiOusly pleased to
bcstow. AS private eOnyeyanees and the trains
aldel to the number Of delegates. they report
ell that their people demand recognition at all
and every harird. 1t was finally determined to
call our York people together on the morrow
and submit to them the prOpriety Of asking of
Cumberland simply that she abide in honor
and good faith heretofore existing. At half
pas, nine o'clock the York delegates who were
present, assembled and were call to orler by
the chairman OF the county committee who
stated the object OF the meeting, and called
for the nomination Of a presiding officer. Hon.
John ii. Durleigh OF South Berwick was elect
ell to preside and F. W. TOwnc, esq. Of Parsons
field was elected clerk The matter was through

ton.


Rssolrei, That the usage in this District has
been 10 alternate in the nominations between

The District Convention was called to order

upon the largest county, and urged upon the
Cumberland delegates the hct that being in the
majority they could not dodge responsibility.


After remarks by others the vote was taken
and the simple, plain resolution from York EN-
bracing nothing but facts, was voted down by
70 yeas to l56 nays. Mr.. Sanborn Of Kittcry.
moved an adjournment Of one hour to allow
York to consult upon the situation. Thcrcupon
Cumberland almost en- masse arose to prevent II.
Gen. Dow shriekei tat al this opposition arose
from pigs who were clamorous to get sow's
teat 10 suck. and because they couldn't find any
were squealing. This brought Capt Burbank
to his feet who handled Mr.. Dow politely but
in manner which probably LEFT a singing sen-
satiOu upon that gentleman's mind. Mr.. San
born informed Cumberland that York had voted
to take recess any way. Mr.. Ycaton plead
for at least 80 minutes which our Portland
friends reluctantly yielded. In sub-conyention
il was pronounced by all that the Cumberland
delegates were bound to throttle York and 1t
was useless toprcsent the name ofany candidate.
Some advocated remaining out Of the hall, but
wiser counsel prevailed, and II was voted to
once more ask Cumberland to pass the York
resolution, and in case il was refused, after what
had passed, that common dccency and self re-
spect left no other alternative but to retire from
the convention. This was done and the favor
was Indignantly spurned. Thereupon about 90
York delegates LEFT the convention or remaining
refused to farther participate in its voting.


Cumberland, with twenty-five pledged votes
from York, thus had II all to themselves. Allthe
names of the York candidates were withdrawn
from before the convention, and the balloting
resulted as follows;

he had performed his duties.

Bishop Lynch sad:-Two sounds had come TO us
in these latter times widely different in their origin
character and effects. One spoke or devotion and
the union OF man with heaven, the other OF aroused
passions and the desoatOns OF armed hosts. On
the one hand could be seen venerable men passing
norJh ana south, east ami west 10 all parts OF the
eartn, and each reached his home he was greeted
with words or cOngratuatOn and welcome, and
from many church rung out IN gladness the 1e
Deune az their safe return Here religion spoke,
here was the union or earth with heaven, for the
people believed that there had been revelation
from God. on the other side we near the
trampng OF hundreds OF thousands OF armed men
and or tens OF thousands slain and wounded. Here
spoke the passions OF men.


TWO GREAT EVENTS

Vatican and the war between the two most powerful

his youthful mnd ever after. There have been

To-day the memory OF Nice, Ephesus and the rest

WHY WAS THE COUNCIL CALLED?


That they may proclaim 10 the world that, con.
trary to the teachings of false philosophers and
snow that man can be great without God,
that there was divinely revealed religion,
and that though man may achieve great
physical results he could not when LETT to HIM

This religion has stood for eighteen centuries, and

wickedness 1t had always been equal to the emer-
gency. That spirit OF naturailsm, OF which nothing
was known few years ago, is now so spreading

Overspread the faces OF many outside the Church,
and even some Of its lukewarm children believed
with them that Garbaldi would be in Rome aud the
Pope an exile before they would have assembled.
Contrary, however, TO the expectations of those
doubtful ones, the Council did assemble and 1t was
such grand assemblage the world had never SEEN
and which no other potentate cOuld summon. He

but because Its inhabitants sought the protection
OF the Church. For eleven hundred years Its bound
aries had renamed the same and no aggression or
rapacity had marked the ADMINISTRATION OF any OF
the pontiiis. What we knew as reverence for the
Old common law OF England prevailed with them in
relation to old time customs. The reverend lecturer
here spoke OF the gradual changes which have come
over The estates OF the Church, and severely CEN
sured the government of Victor Emanuel which,
instead Of respecting the ecclesiastical pro,
seized and sold for the beneit Of private private
individuals the property Of the Church.
The temporal power of the Pope he said was OF
vital importance to the interest of Catholiccy
throughout the world. Would they say that Italy
was morally bound 10 protect him? SO were all men
bound morally 10 respect the rights and property of
their fellows. But these moral obligations never

The bishop concluded his lecture by reterating
his assertion that the interests OF the Church
manded that the Pope should be the independent
sovereign OF some little territory SO small as to
casc no jealousy or give umbrage to none Tor, said
he, in case OF q war arising between two nations

hands of both went To their breasts search OF pistols

caped but Ferguson, when he had little time reflect
on the matter went to the police Office and himself

though this should make il necessary that
individuals should die If a man wW plant
himself across the path of human progress or
human safety he must be remOved-in pieces,
il not otherwise. drunkard who lies down
by night across railroad track, and there goes
to sleep, will probably be cut in two before
morning, and this through the fault of no one
but himself


II ia sometimes necessary that men should
be killed then let them be killed because it
is necessary, and not because we deem it just.
In rude and barbarous ages and countries,
where the permanent, secure incarceration Of
felOns is impossible, they must die by Lynch
or some other law. Thus highway robbers
and horse thieves are uniformly dealt with
in mining regiOn--Often, we presume, by
gatherings composed in good part of men little
better than themselves. Society, when it can
not do as it would, must do the best it can.


But killing men in cold blood, in civilized
Christian community, is another affair alto
gether. 1t has a cruel and cowardly aspect If
Real were to be hanged to-day in the middle
of Central Park, from gallows fifty feet high,
there would be not less than One Hundred
Thousand spectators of his taking-off, two
thirds of them composed of the vilest scum
and sediment of our city. Burglars, pick
pockets, blacklegs, harlOts, and ruffians, would
flock to the entertainment, as to any other
cOngenial debauch; and the lesson it would
read them would be one of revenge pure
and simple. They would understand from
it that, as one homicide necessitates
another, so blow given requires that blow
be returned, and that any injury or wong
should be promptly and amply revisited upon
the head Of the offender. They would take
away from the spectacle all the murder that
was in their hearts before, and the reinforce
ment that lent the sanction of Government
and law to the qualification of their own
wrath and hate


The progress of civilization has overturned
the pillory, banished the whipping post, and
hidden the gallOws. In hiding from the public

but vengeance. Having made this confession,
let the cap be drawn down over its eyes, a
prayer muttered, and the malefactor turned Off,
in accordance with its own long-established
precedent."

Before Cunning s. Bedford, City Judge.


Assistant District Attorney Tweed conducted the
prosecution yesterday and disposed OF the calendar
Of cases with great despatch. His brief and clear
summing up speeches proved to be as effective upon
the minds OF the Jury as ong-winded harangues.
Thomas Featherston who was Jointly indicted
with Dennis ONsi pleaded guilty to robbery In the
first degree. The complainant, Charles Kraeger,
told the Court that between two and three O'Clock

side face ana could not swear to the identity OF the
MIR. william F. Howe, the counsel for the accused,
put few questions to the lady, and, having been
satisfied OF the innocence Of his client, awaited the
further action Of the prosecuting officer Mr.. Tweed
informed the Court that he could not establish the
identity OF the prisoner, whereupOn Judge Bedford
directed the jury to render an acquittal


This is the first verdict OF not guilty obtained by

tion Of Subsidies.",,"Congress Now Army Bil,--rae Qtcs-


tion Of Subsidies.


The Army bill is fairly under way in the
Senate and was discussed with an apparent
intention Of business yesterday. Several im-
portant amendments were made with less taiK
than usu lily characterizes some patent right
bills or bills to erect piers or establish coun-
try post road The lirst section, reducing inc
army to twenty-five thousand men, was
amended 80 as to mako the number thirty
thousand; another section, providing Tor Inc
retirement Of incapacitsted officers, was
amended 50 as to except those who received
injuries by wounds or disease in the line OF
duty, and the new pay schedule was stricken
out altogether. The bill is complete subsu-
tute for Logan's bill, passed some time ago In
the House, and although there are many Oh
jectons to it, still it is much preferable TO the
other. 1t reduces the army too much but
with our recuperative volunteer system we are
not likely to suffer for soldiers in case Of
any more critical juncture than Indian
raids. The pay Of the officers is not re-
duced, and the disabled officers are not
ungenerously thrust out into the cold, and In
that much, at least, 1t is better than Logan's
sweeping bill. One amendment however, was
adopted which we cannot favor. II prohibits
army officers, whether On active service or re-
tired, from holding civil Offices, and the result,
in one instance OF the amendment, will be TO
compel Minister Sickies, who lost q leg in the
war, to return from Spain next June, when the
years leave of absence by which he acquired
the right to go as Minister 10 that country shall
have expired, or else withdraw from the army.
In this, as in numerous oher cases, the amend
ment will work injuriously. Retired army off,
GERS, by virtue of education and patriotic SER
vice, are generally especially ft for civil
Offices, and it is as wrong to compel them to
remain idle in the army when they can perform
civil service as 10 drive them from it because
there is more pleasant work than quclng re-
bellons to be done.


The bill to revive the shipping interests was
the main topic in the House. 1t proposes to
revive American commerce mainly by a system
of subsidies and bounties, which Is at least not



the very best way to bring about good end.
The bill was discussed up to the morning
hour, when it went over under the rules until
Tuesday next. Mr.. Lynch, who takes charge
of the bill, seems inclined to discuss it fairly,
and we hope ii will be thoroughly debated, in
order that we may have the sense of the House
on the best way in which to regain our mari
time prominence. Some discussion ensued on
the delay occasioned by the slow considera-
ton Of tue Tariff bill, and Dir. Wood demanded
to know If it was the intention to work at the
same rate through all Of it, when there was
little or no probability of it's ever passing. Mr..
Schenck insisted on going on with III ani it
will probably be continued until Its number
less sections are all amended and revised ont
OF shape."

1t that the large body Of our citi,
zenS were forced to debar them


selves the pleasure Of participating


in the days exercises.


Politically, our people are op.


posed to the body Of the Legisla.


ture aud to the State officers. The


reason ofthis political dislike 10 too


apparent, and has too often been


adverted too to need further state


ment now. But in spite of that


political dislike, and even iu spite


of q personal dislike In some In


stances, our people are man.


ly aud courteous enough


to pay due respect to q
guest aud especially to guests


who represent the honorable and
to be respected offices of the State.


We Lad long wished for this visit
because we hoped 1t would prove
not only pleasant to the visitors
but advantageous to our own In.
terests. We wished to show our
proud and beautiful city to the
strangers, and we wished also to
so impress them with its merits
and deservings that they should
feel interest enough in the chief
city Of the State and the to be
queen city Of the South TO advance
our welfare and prosperity BY such
means as lay in their power. There
is a great deal Of influence exer-
ted by personal intercourse and we
hoped that this occasion would
have afforded us that opportunity
Of personally presenting and press
ing our claims.


But unfortunately we fear that
the golden opportunity has been
unimproved. The day and occa.
sion intended by our people as an
opportunity of showing our respect
for the State and Legislative de.
partments, aud enjoy a few hours
Ofsocial intercourse, whose tenden-
cy would be to soften animosities
and allay political bitterness, has
been perverted to partizAn pur.
poses, and has, therefore, excluded
our citizens from all participation
therein, and hence, we fear the
good hoped for Is not accomplish
ed. But we can only rely upon the
impartial caudor aud judgment of
our visitors to place the blame, if
any they find, where 1t should rest.
1t could not be expected that this
community would prove so inconsis-
tent and thOughtless of self.respect |
as to engage in the ceremonies
whose object and purpose were the
celebration of the ratification OF the
18th Amendment. This was no
fault Of the visitors, but solely of
those here who manipulated the
affair, and it was this that ex-
cluded the people from active par.
ticipation. However, we earnestly
hope the city's guests had q pleas
ant visit, and that they were IA
vOrably impressed with our little
town and are disposed to accede to
some of the wishes of her people.
The legislative delegation who Wis.
tied our city not long ago can at
test that when they visit us in no
partisan character they receive the
''best we have in the shop""


But, after this long preface, to the
details Of the days proceedings.


The members Of the Legislature
to the nunber of about thirty or
forty, and Lieut.. Gov. Powers,
Attorney General Morris, aud Sec.
retary OF State Lynch reached this
city on a special train about 8 Am.
yesterday.


At the depot they were received
aud conducted to carriages and &C.
cOmpanied by the Mayor and others
Of the officials, and preceded by a
band, were conducted to the boats
for them. The trip up
the river was pleasant one. The
party landed at the cemetery and
visited the graves of the Union
soldiers. Re-embarking they went
rs far as Grants canal.


A SumptuOus dinner was served
On the boats, and q general good
time was enjoyed during the feast.
roasts aud speeches were had from
Mr.. Lynch, Judge Morris, Mr..
Eggleston, Judge Simrall, Senator
Gibbs and others. About two
o'clock the boats returned to the
city. During the absence of the
boats containing the guests our
streets were paraded by q large

Unknown nlcn.","TFrom the Memphis Appeal, August ILL","[From the Memphis Appeal, August ILL.,


We have several times recently alluded to the
capture Of Charles Back the murderer of the
Goode family on Favorite Island few months
ago, and one day last week we announced the fact
that he had passed through the city in charge Of
the Sheriff OF Tunica county, en- route to the scene
of his crimes He was carried down the river on
the steamer General Anderson, and lodged In jail
at Austin where it was intended to keep him until
bis trial, which was to have been held at the next
Criminal Assizes in Tunica county. The county,
however, has been spared the heavy expense of
keeping him so long aud of his trial by the regu.
lar course Of the law. Judge Lynch convened his
court day before yesterday morning, little be-
fore day, In the neighborhood of the JAIL and
quietly took the business off The hands Of the
courts OF justice, $50 called"" The steamer Geo.
w. Cheek which arrived from Frar's Point yes.
terday morning, brought the only particulars of
the affair that we have been able to CLEAN. The
story told us by passenger on her Is briefly as


Shortly before daylight on Wednesday
morning, say o'clock, q squad Of men
presented nna snemsevs, ia, at the jail at Aus
admit them, stating that they had some horse
thieves, caught in the neghborhood of Peyton
(some few miles below Austin), whom they
wished to deliver to him. The jailcr, thus in.
formed, opened the door and was instantly seized
and pinoned by men in black masks and dom


noes. The bunch Of keys was quietly taken
possession of by two men, who went to the cell
where Back ok was confined, opened the door and
passed---the unhappy man recognized in the
hideously disguised strangers the avengers of
blood and trembingy obeyed their mandate
He was bound on leaving his cell and quickly
carried to the river, where he was put in skif,
which, along with half dozen more, was moored
in waiting near by. Tho balance of the party,
numbering In all some twenty-five thirty, got In
the other skiFs, and tho whole hotilla rowed
swiftly and silently over to Favorite Island, The
prisoner was taken out, on reaching the island,
and carried to tree which shelters the grave of
one of his victims-old Mrs. Goode--where he was
hung. Our informant states that he was told that
the unhappy man made a full confession. This
must be mere conjecture, however, as 1t IL not
likely that any OF those who heard his confession,
"" he made one, would be apt to tell about 1t."

The most powerful lobby now here Is that In The

the proposed air line railroad to New York, now
before the House. These lobbyists become SO bold
tnat they thrust themselves upon the moor Of the
House whie IL was In session and intruded them
selves upon members IN their seats. TO such an ex-
tent was this carried that Mr.. Rogers, OF Arkan-

yesterday TO enforce the rules, alleging
that at every turn ne was confronted by
railroad Lobbyists. In addition TO the fresh arrivals

Among the most active, influential and respectable
OF new arrivals w. Prescott smith, OF the Balti-

Tho Telegraph DIonorolists OvcrrenchinG
Observation-Disclosures Of the Postal TcIe.
graph system in Great Britain.


The Western Union aonopollss are likely to over.
reach themselves IN their efforts to create prejudice
against the postal telegraph project. Ever since
the establishment Of the government system IN
England stories have been set aloat by the Orton
people representing the thing as a gigantic failure,
huge piece OF acknowledgement, and grand1cause
OF general embarrassment 10 business men. The
Atlantic cable has been literally employed to dis
scminate these stories, and cunning European
agents OF the Western Union Company have been
quite industrious IN cpc King up dispatches for pub
iicaion here and elsewhere. The object OF all this
has been to create false Impression to the prac-
tlcaDlty and utility OF postal telegrapns.
and thus to deceive Congress. Reliable intel
hecncc received here proves that all these
stories are IN the main fabrcat0ns, aud that where
they are true they furnish argument In favor in
s'ead oI against the project. The Information to
winch aluae Is that the postal Telegraph mas proved


great blessing "" the people, and that its popularity
IS great that the existing lines are Inadequac to
get through the largely increased business. 10
prove that what ! state is not mere barren asser-
uon may mention the fact that General G. G.
Washburn TO-DAY received letter from Mr.. Frank l.
scadamorc, secretary OF the British Post once, and
ono OF the principal promoters OF rha postal tele
graph system in Grcai Britain, In which It is OBJ
served that despatchS We're transmitted over the
ocean cable representing the system as failure lat
a time when there was delay whatever when
there was no dissatisfaction and when 1t was not
possible there could have been any complaints. mas


much as the conduct OF the telegraph business under
the Post once had only commenced an hour or two
before the telegram transmittcd.o The letter
then continues thus


very large increase OF business consequent upon
the reduction TO o shilling rate. has caused some
delay. We are, however, improving IN working
from day to day, and have no doubt whatever or
the success OF our scheme.


thus you will perceive that one OF the os:cal
heads OF the system in England exposes the mlscra-
ble shams OF the Western Union inonoposts ana
gives the lie to all their late statements. General
Washburn Is determined not 10 be turned aside from
his work, and Will use every proper means to
bring It TO successful issue IN Cone eress this
session. He has repeatedly tried To get the House
10 authorize hlm to send for persons ana papers In
prosecution "" his investigation hut the monopoly
lobbyists on the floor have thus far defeated his ef
forts. Win such authority as he seeks he could
compel the Western Union people TO MAKE fair and
candid exhibit Oh their business; but knowing and
tearing this, orion y Co. have instructed their
friends IN the House to make objections on the
ground Of economy. General Wasnburn however,

way, should the House again refuse to give the
required authority.

braced the highest officers OF our own Govern

Everybody was delighted. There was no cause
of complaint whatever. Even that necessarv
adjunct Of all public gatherings-the cloak
room-was properly conducted; the tickets be-
ing promptly attended to, and ""the goods"" de-
livered. The ladies' dressing rooms, too, were
attended by careful servants. We have not
heard Of single article being missing, il we ex-
cept glove, which gentleman had dropped
near the outer entrance. And then as to the
pleasure of the company; the hall was not too
full to prevent dancing, and there was sufficient
room for the polka and the waltz for all who
desired to participate in them.


The arrangements of the supper room were
complete, only about fifty persons, ladies and
gentlemen, being admitted at a time. The
Prince, with Mr.. and Mrs. Thornton, the Presi-

and Foreign Ministers who happened to be in
their company at the time, Judge Fisher, Gen
eral Banks, (escorting Mrs. NcF alls,) and other

who shared in the rich and abundant hospital-
ties. The tables were supplied with everything
which the taste of the caterer could command.
with large number of servants to wait upon
the guests.


MIR. and Mrs. Thornton were lavish ip their
attentions. MIR. Thornton repeatedly mingled
in the crowd, recognizing friends, making new
acquantances, evidently happy with the bril-
liant surroundings He had pleasant words for

afforded.

EDITOR STAR:-In view of the statements
which have been made public relative to the
seems nee essary that the real condition Of affairs
- far as this Office Is concerned, should be made
known. 1t is not proposed to discuss the merits
OF the question at issue between the company

to mislead the public as to the ability of the

hardly be considered a legitimate method of
carrying on the contest.


This Office is prepared to receive and TRANSMIT;
all business offered. All business has been
promptly and regularly fOrwa arded thus far. The
force now on duty consist of thirteen operators
(instead of four as reported besides the mana
ger, and more are now on their way here: A.
to the character Of these operators, the names
which those who differ with them NAV choose
to apply is matter Of taste, but the real truth
operators as ever were in this or any Office.
Were the contrary trHe they could not have
performed the work as it has been performed.


The branch d . offices at No: 432 Pennsylvania

others will be soon.


With regard to other offices, we are working
regularly with every one of the offices mentioned
as closed in the circular issued last evening by
the ""Telegraphers' League"" In regard to the
Richmond Office especially, the last man of

the old force, are now on duty, and sent last
evening an appeal to the strikers here to follow
their example. And we have advice this mo-
ment that all the men in that district, cOmpris-
ing the lines from Richmond South to Augusta,
via Wilmington, and to Charleston via Green's
boro', and west to Lynchburg and Gordopsville,
have returned to their work


Of course the company has had to strain every
nerve to meet the demands Of the public in this
emergency, which, SO far as this Office Is con-
ccrned, was precipitated upon them at fifteen
minutes notice, and there has been literally no
time for anything but incessant work; but the
work has been done, is being done, and will con-
Time to be done As 1t always has been. Our IA

This statement Is considered due alike to the

MooNEYs EMpEzzLEMENT.


As surmiscd in my last letter, Mooney, the
phlanthropst, Fenian and elevator of the work
ing classes had exceeding good cause for his
sudden disappearance. 1t is now known that he
positors Of the Savings and Loan Society, and
there is not the least doubt but that other similar
transactions will be brought to light. When it
was announced that the Bank had suspended
payment Il crowd of several hundred-prncpal
y Irish-collected on the outside of the build
ing and the scenes witnessed were very painful
The Directors Of the Institution have been guilty
of criminal neglect in allowing n man of Moon
ey S character to have sole control Of the man
agemcnt, and they are also much to blame for



the accounts. 1t would be a novel experiment
to lynch a Bank Director but it would have an ex-
cellent effect on the future conduct of those Off
GERS. But the wonder is how people could be
such fools as to trust the man Mooney with their
dollars His career has been an uninterrupted
course of blatant demagogism and financial dis
honesty. Every position he has yet held either
in Ireland, Australia or California, has found
him either secret rogue or an open deaauter ;
but because he announced himself a friend of
ireland, hubnubbed with Savage, clustered
about the wrongs of labor, and dubbed himself
"" workingman's friend"" his crcdulous dupes
looked upon him as an incarnation of honesty
and patriotism, and would believe nothing said
against him. His flight had evidently been long
premeditated as he sold all his landed property
some months ago and three or four weeks since
converted $4,000 worth of coin into United
Sl5o0o0, and Central America is now said tc
have been his destination.


ANOTHER VISITATION.


Just when we were congratulating ourselves
that the Eastern excursion season was over, that
clcrgymen, editors, Bostonians, lecturers and
Boards Of Trade would bother us no more until
next Spring the announcement is made that n
train of ticket agents, representing the various
railroads Of the United States and Canada, is on
its way to this much visited city. The party

If ever Il convention needed to be opened with

1t will pay for every congregation in the land to
remember that crowd in their next Sundays sup.
picalions, and ask that their eyes may be opened
to the error Of the high fares that have hith.
erto governed their permanent ways.


snERMAs's ARRIVAL.


The spontaneous outburst of enthusiasm with
which General Sherman has been greeted, has
been equally worthy Of the State he visited and
the hero to whom it was accorded. His progress
from Chicago to San Francisco was n perfect
ovation and sufficient to prove that California
still recognizes the great debt Of gratitude she
owes to the Sayiors Of the Republic.


THE GENERALS MOVEMENTS.


On Thursday, accompanied by Generals Ord
and Schoheld and their Staffs the General in
spected the forts in the harbor. In the evening,
the Governor and our carpet warriors of militia
derivation, made official calls upon the distin.
guished visitor. On Friday he participated with
the Pioneer Society in the celebration of Caifor-
MAS twentieth birthday, and on Saturday de
lighted the German residents by attending their
Sanitary Fair The present week is to be given
up to a round of parties, dinners and balls, pri-
vate ana public, after which he will leave for
Portland, Oregon, and from thence will return
East by way Of Montana.


MARCHING THROUGH GEORGIA.""


If there is any drawback to General Sherman S
happiness it must be the eternal infection to
which he is subjected of "" Marching through
Georgia."" Since his arrival here every band,
melodcon, piano, hand-organ and orchestra has
been grinding out that never ending strain, so
that the air musical seems nearly rs l-pervading

tune will stick to him through life, dirge him in"

unexpectedly broken up on Friday last about 8
miles from Dover. MIR. Daniel Cowgirl, living
on the road to Cowgl's Corner, having missed
a quantity Of wheat from his barn that morning
and seeing fresh wheel prints in the Darn-yard,
tracked the same to the residence of negro nam
cd Thomas Dutton, living on Alarm about mile
and half distant. Dutton refused admission to |
his barn, whereupon Mr. Cowgirl went to Dover
for an officer leaving two men TO guard the prem
ises. Duri-g his absence five negroes made their |
escape by running to the woods. The barn was |
searched when the wheat and large quantity of
goods of nearly every description was found, |
most of the articles being packed in chests ready
for removal Most Of the clothing belonging to
Mr.. kaatz Of this town, was found, together with
the goods robbed from the stores of Wallace
Burton, of Dover, and Mr.. Stevens, of Camden
large quantity of meat was also found, robbed
from the neighboring meat houses from time to
time. The value of the goods found is estimated
| at over $1,000. The following arrests have been
made: Henry johnson, Samuel Benson Thomas
Dutton, Sy Green, Swany Saxton, Daniel STAINS
bury and Esther Duton. The last two have been
| discharged, having given security for their ap-
pearance.. The rest are in jail. Johnson was ar

and heartfelt. After the, race 1t BECAME

naturally felt the loss OF his colt very severely, which


added greatly TO the general sympathy expressed Tor
him. In the midst OF this expression vi regret 10
| was conceived by MIR. John Morrlssey, who was
present, that the sporting gentlemen present, in


their known liberallty, could make up enough pay

mind he at once started subscription paper, head

Mr. Beicner %, Of Kentucky, also interested
united efforts Of these gentlemen IN few minutes
the sum or $4,000 was raised, which has al
action made the sick turfman's heart feel glad.
This matter should not rest here and those vino SO
kindly lnaugurated this movement hope that other

The Racing.


b
received in narrowing and rolling, 1t was IN better
condition than any OF the racing men anticipated.
Good time was made in every race, which proved
its fair condition. Four races were ON the card for
this, the opening day, the first being hurdle race
of two miles eight hurdles with welter weights
The second race was between three year ods mile
heats with 100 pounds up, and the third race was
dash OF TWO miles and a half, between Three four
year olds.


The hurdle race had four starters, Lobelia Bohan-
non, Oysterman, Jr., and Morris. Oysterman, Jr.,
was the favorite at long odds the night before ut
Long Branch, but when morning came change had
taken place IN the minds OF some Of the operators and
Lobella had the call in number or the pools sold
she wen capital race, in excellent time Bohannon
running IN second, Uysterman, Jr., third Tue de-
injury he received by Ills iall over the hurdle At
Saratoga last month.


The heat race between the three year ods was q |
very exciting anair throughout. Three heats were
run, Lyncdburg winning the first anu Enquirer the |
two sdbSequent ones, both colts beng the get |
ol imported bennington There were twenty |
seven nominations for this race only OF |
that number coming TO tie post These were En- |
gurer, Lynchburg Maggie Is. b., Harlc. susan Ann |
aud Doneraie colt. The latter made fine running |
In the first heat and only beaten by Lynchburg
by nose. In the second heat, soon after leaving |
the starting post, Lynchbur suddenly stopped and !
after the heat was over 1t was aScertalned nat the
colt had broken his near shoulder blade. Tnls Is |
SAD loss, not only 10 his owner, but the turf, as
Lynchburg was one OF the most promising three |
year ods in the country, and was valued at over
$1,000 before The injury ENQUIRER won the last !
TWO heats with apparent ease. lie was the fayOrite
against the field previous to the start and although
defeated In the first heat by u bad start he had tile
call IN the betting at long odds TO the end.
Enquirer IS one Oi the most magnificent three
year ods that has appeared on the American turf,
ana should he meet Knglsier and llainburg In
race this fall OF the finest anu fastest that ever
occurred may be looked for. We would not be sur
prlsed these thre ecOs turn ont good, If
better horses than Norfolk, Kentucky ana Asterold.
Enquirer to some eyes, has a LITTLE 100 much day
light under him; but his sire was formed IN the same
way and he could run fast, carry weignt and 60
distance Maggie b. b. was second IN tne race and |
ran well, but she did not come up 10 the eXpecta-
tionS or her Dackers. some OF them think that she
was not as good nlly yesterday as she was |
at Saratoga, bnt they do not take into |
consideration the difference Of the tracks, the one
being made by incessant toll the fastest in America,
Whine the other Is entirely new, and has had little
work on 1t TO improve It. The time made was excel"

charged that the Clyde shipbuilders have had
hand in opposing the adoption of the bill 10
revive American Navigation and Commerce.
But there is no need that Western members
generally, whose opposition on other and more
honest grounds is clearly understood, should
Indignantly repel the charge as false and
""insulting."" Mr.. Lynch did not refer to them,
and the public cOmprehends clearly enough
that they were not meant. The public
also understand who were meant Everybody
knows that the Western opposition is on strictly
sectional grounds. The interior does MT want
to be taxed, directly or indirectly, for the BEN
eft, near or remote, of the sea-cOast. AS the
interest to be revived is a national one, such
sectional opposition does not appear the most
statesmanlike, but there is little doubt of its
honesty. Clyde shipbuilders know well enough
that there was no need to employ mOney-if
money could be employed-in that quarter
Western opposition was already assured with
out cost.


1t is not clear that the bill is dead, al
though Mr.. Lynch yesterday proposed to lay it
aside. The House refused to lay it on the

obtained the oor asking that the previous question be

the substitute offered by the Committee, with the amend

took the floor and made animated speech in support

 One of the most daring robberies and at tempts to murder ever recorded in the anpals of crime in San Francisco, was sne which was committed on Commercial street between Montgomery aud Kearney on the afternoon of the l7th day of August 1864, At half past o'clock, at time when people were constant Y passing to and fro along the Street named. the pawn establishment of Nr Meyers was en tered by an individual who knocked down IT. Meyers, agfd Is years, sor of the proprietor. and then he ped himself 10 watches, diamonds and jewelry of the value of several thouraud dollars, after which he n ade his escape For long time the police worked assduously to en-. deavor to discover who the perpetrater was gentleman who had arrived from Los Anreles was noticed wearing a singular piece of iewel.y

 which the officers thought looked very much like part of the property stolen from Mevers' store, and upon questioning him, ascertained that he had purchased it from a man in Los Angeles. The piece of jewelry was identified by Meyers ns his property. The officers ob-, tained the assistence of the military, and the

 man for whom they were searching was arrest. ed near Fort Prescott Arizona. At the time of his arrest he had with him carpet sack in

 which there was aquantity of jewelry. The prisoner was tal raw-bontd individual | named John Kelly. He was native of Indiana nrI q

 California with the potorious Fourteenth

 Regiment of Of U s. Infantry This last is mistake the l4th Infantry arrived in Cali ! fornia, not in 1864 n nOr previous to that date. but in December l865-ED. ARIzoXAx.7 One dark night the prisoner broke out of the guard

 house, and, before the sentinel could hail him. Kelly saped from the bluff into the abyss be- low. The prisoner it was supposed, had been crushed to pieces Sn the rocks as he fell, but when day broke and search was instituted fa- what the searchers expected to ind-the dead, mutilated body-no trace of it could be found; so it became evident that Kelly had not sus- tained serious injury, and he had made good his escape. Kelly was next heariof in Santa Rita Niue, Arizona, where he was engaged as blacksmith. For some time he worked at his trade, but he qurrreled with the superin- tendent of the mine, GrOsvener, and tried to stab him, for which he was discharged This is another mistake The blacksmith who at-

 tempted to stab Mir GEosvener, was not Kelly, but Burch, and the attempt was made ia l862. The Santa Rita mine was abandoned pre- gioua to 1864 and has not since been worked The flowing portion of the story recounts the car- eer of Burch, in l862-3, but one contemporary gives it to it's readers as recital oE thu ad- ventures of it's man Kelly subsequent to the date of the robbery on Commercial street in San Francisco. The gtory would be quite in

 teresting if true but the names ofPersons and places and the dates at which incidents are said to have transPirsd show that it is all 6 compounded mistake. The San Francisco po- iipe had, therefore better resums the hunt for Kelly ED AKIzoSAN] From there he went to Tubac, where he killed man with whom he had quarreled, and as the sympa,hies of the citizens ware with ths raurdered man, Kelly thought it necessary to have that part of tho country to escape lynch law. From that place he went to Chihuahua. near which city he murdered his travelling companion for his money. Several months ago he brutally mur- dered family of feur persons near El Paso Del Norte, for the sake ol few dollars. Kelly who had acquired the nams of the ""Arizonian Rufian,"" was arrested by some men fthe city named who wrecked their vengeance on him. They carried him into a wood some distance from the city, where they tied one end of a rope to the limb of a tree, and to the other end tied Kelly by the heels, so that his head hung within few feet from the ground. They then built slow fire under him, and all lowed him to remain suspended until death put sn end to his existence,"

WASHINGTON, May 25-Mr. Chandler offer-
ed a resolution instructing the Committee on
Commerce to inquire and report as to the most
feasible mode of restoring foreign commerce to
American vessels. 1t was laid on the table
preparatory to remarks to be made on the sub
ject by MIR. Chandler on Friday next.

out of the funds of the F-eedmen's Bureau in
aid of the Wilberforce University, of Ohio.
was passed, 3j to II.


The consular, diplomatic and other appropri-
alton bills were received from the House and
referred, and the Senate resumed the consider
alton OF the bill to enforce the 18th amend
ment.


The question of order by Mr.. Salisbury that
1t was not competent for the committee to add
TO Dy both Houses, was Overruled after full
statement of the case by the chair.


The bill was passed by 4S to IL.


The legislative, judicial and executive appro.
pr,atlon bill was debated until the recess.


Messrs. Irumbull, Conkling and Thurman
were appointed as committee of conference on
the bill amendatory of the bankrupt law


HOUSE.


Wednesday next is assigned for the business
OF the Committee on Banking and Currency.


The House resumed the consideration of the
bill to revive the navigation and commercial
posed the bill because it only aided the iron
workers of Pennsylvania and the wood hewers
in Maine, while it burdened the tax payers of
the whole country. He would vote to remit
the actual duties on materials used in ship
building. -,h


Mr.. Lynch of Maine remarked that the COM
mittee had agreed to substitute for the bill,
and he offered it to be acted upon as an amend
ment.


Mr.. Ingersol of Illinois, argued that the COM
mittee had misconceived the duty assigned to
it. That duty was to inquire into the causes
OF the decay of American commerce and navi-
cation, but the committee had confined itself
SO far as the pending bill was concerned to the
shipbuilding interest. Everybody knew that
iron ships could not be built in Maine, and that
wooden ships could not compete with iron
ships in foreign trade. If the bill were to be-
come a law it would not endanger the interests
of foreigners in carrying. American tonnage
so far as foreign trade was concerned would
continue to decline until it became actually
extinct. 1t would have been Just as sensible
when railroad bL siness superseded the old stage
coach business to have reported a bill to revive
the coach building interest as to report the
pending bill.


Mr.. Garfield of Ohio, also offered bill as
not giving relief at the very place where relief
was most needed; namely, in regard to foreign
tonnage.


The morning hour expired and the bill went
over


In the substitute offered by Mr.. Lynch the
preamble is the same as in the original bill, but
the first section is modified as follows: That
upon all imported lumber, hemp, and for iron
and steel not advanced beyond rods, bars, bolts,
plates, beams and forgings which may be used
and wrought up in the construction of steam
or sail vessels built in the United States and
furnished after the passage of this act, whether
for hull, rigging, equipment or machinery of
such vessels, shall be allowed and paid by the
Secretary of the Treasury. A rebate and draw
back equal to the duties which have been paid
on such material and where American material
is used in the construction of vessels or steam
ers of not less than 1000 tons, shall be allowed
and paid as aforesaid to an amount equivalent
to the duties on similar articles Of foreign man.
ufcture when imported. The second section,
allowing ship stores to be taken aud consumed
free of duty remains as in the original bill. The
remaining sections are struck out


The Pacific Railroad Committee reported
without amendment the Northern Pacific Rail-
road bill, and Mr.. Hawley addressed the House
in support of his amendment, which forbids
the company to sell its lands to other than ac-
tual settlers in lots of 160 acres, at prices be-
yond $3.50 an acre.


MIR. Wheeler being entitled to the floor for
an hour yielded part of his time TO Messrs.
Sargent and Poland, who favored the bill, and
to- MIR. Cox, who opposed it, after which the
Honse rejected Mr.. Hawley's amendment by IS
to los, and Mr.. Sargent's lands granted to the
operation of the homestead and pre-emption
laws, by % to 105, and without further action

storms and floods as sudden and destructive
as those of more tropical regions; but seldom
has she been visited by a storm so ter
rible in its character and effects as
that which desolated her fields during
the last week, and of which there is
yet no cessation. Beginning in the extreme
southern part of the State, the storm travelled
nOrthward seeming to increase in intensity
until the Maryland border was reached, when
its further progress was marked by no more
than the usual severity of equinOctial
storms From Richmond westward to Staun-
ton and Lynchburg, on the route of the James
River, the greatest amount of mischief has been
done. Richmond itself is inundated, and the
business districts flooded and impossible. The
bridges crossing to Manchester have been de-
strOyed, and human life placed in constant
jeopardy from the falling buildings and float
ing debris. At Lynchburg railroad cOmmuni-
cation is broken off, the bridges and the
embankments being thoroughly swept away.
Human life has also suffered, whole family
having perished, and the shocking report
comes that at Harper's Ferry fOrty-sevcn per-
sons have been killed The swelling of the
Virginia streams rushing into the Potomac has
increased the volume of its water alarmingly,
and Washington, already suffering, is threat
ened with an inundation as complete and de-
struCtive as that at Richmond. The crops of
the Summer, carefully garnered throughout the
Virginia valley, have been utterly destroyed
in this havoc of storm and food 1t is dread
full to contemplate the suffering that must
ensue in this region, not yet fully recovered
from the deSolatOns of war"

considerable suspicion here and has very bad

tanned 80 many grave errors that he means to have
it thoroughly revised ana corrected before giving it

discrimination, was not tair ana that the income
tax ought 10 either stand fall entirety with
such amendments as Congress may choose to make.

| Mr.. sCHENoK replied that then the whole subject
! OF the income tax would he lett in It's present
cloudy and uncertain state. In reply to question

Internal Revenue had decided to go with the col
and TO claim income tax for 1870 next spring,
but he tSehencD did not know any means Dy
| Mr.. LYNCH, (rep OF Me- inquired whether the

Mr. SCIiENCK stated that the whole subject would

Mr.. CULLOM, (rep.,) Of Ill., suggested like resolu.
tion, increasing the exemption to 50, 500 >. va.
Mr.. soHENCK declined to admit these various pro
positions. The Committee on Ways and Means mad
| been considering all these points and would in due
time report its conclusions In general bl that
|
that 1t was not unpopular with the masses OF the
| people, who were not much heard In Congress, who
mad not control oil the newspapers and who did not
make public opinion.


| Mr.. WooD remarked that his objection to the in
| come tax was from Its inquislorlal character aad
because 1t was In contraventlon Of the genius OF


institutions and could only be excused as a war lax
| under an extraordinary contingency. He did not
object to the payment by rich men OF large proper
ton OF their incomes, but ne objected to tax THAT
came into the household and into the private affairs
| and domestic relations Of every individual.
a
| systems Of taxation were unpopular but he believed
| that the income tax was the most just tax OF the
| whole system OF internal revenue. 1t was tax on
| capital, and If he were TO propose any change 1t
would be to increase the exemption to TWO thousand
| dollars He hoped the House would refuse TO con-
| cur IN the Senate amendment


Mr. SCHENCK thought the complaint OF che gentle
tora character Of the tax was IN some respects well
| founded and part oil the duty OF the Committee on


Ways and Means would be TO modify the law In
some such particular. But far as the tax itself
was concerned his opinion was tnat the general in.
tcrna revenue taxation could not be reduced thirty
millions OF dollars, as proposed on other matters OF
taxation, which were really more odious and vexa-
tious, II the income tax were given up. The income
tax was the most camored about because those who
paid 1t were IN the way Of raising such clamor


put 1t was regarded oy the masses OF the people d
to pay taxes The total number Of persons who
paid income tax was 212, ,s43; OF this number over


paia tweny 1oafs OF less lamar ana II the
| would be cut on. The second class, that paid be.
tween twenty and a1ty dollars numbers co. 1874. The





dollars, numbered A. 196. The fourth Glass; that PAID
| between one and two hundred dollars numbered


over $4,000, and those who paid over TWO hundred
| dollars numbered Q, 464.


Mr.. VOORHEES,, ldem.) Of Ind favored the continu.
| ance OF the income TAX, and declared his opinion


that the most unpopular thing the House could do
| would be to abolish 1t. Instead OF being too in


qulstorial, he would make IT more 80.


Mr.. COBURN, .Tep.) Of lnd., expressed similar
| views. He knew OF no tax that was 80 universally
popular was, and for the very good that


as general thing it was derived from persons who
| were able TO pay It.


| MIR. SARGENT wanted to know where evidence Of


public opinion was TO be had II not through the pub


nc press and that was strongly against the continu.


ance OF the income tax. The best argument against


it that so few returned their incomes honestly,


and that II encouraged perjury and enabled rich
| men, by liking up the schedules to evade the law,
| while poorer classes, with known fixed incomes,
| were compelled to pay


Mr.. JUDD. trepl Of H., in reply to Mr.. Woods re.
| mark, that IL was war tax and should be discon-


tnued, suggested that it was war tax still, as it
| provided means to pay the pensions OF oneegged
| sOldiers1 and the widows and orphans OF soldiers.

equal to anything, including the beating of
themselves; but that seems beyond their
strength.


They can hardly repeat the attempt under
more favorable auspices than this year. In
the first place, Gen. Chamberlain, their pres
ent Governor, is not a very stringent Pro-
hibitionst so those who are saw fit torun Tenn
perance candidate against him last year, and thus
draw Off4 743 votes from Chamberlain. Thisyear,
the Republican candidate is Sidney Perham,
through PrOhibitiOnist from the start, who was
nominated by a small majority over Gen. Hersey,
who is very popular in his section and with the
Union soldiers everywhere, and whose defeat
in the nomination has been savagely resented
at the polls. In the Ist (and closest) Congress
District, the Hon. John Lynchs reelection was
opposed Oh the assumption that he has had
three terms already, and that York County
ought to have her ""turn"" this time. His
opponent w. 2. Haines, is very rich and
popular, resides in York County, and was
warmly supported by one of its Republican
journals This is one of the districts counted
on to give the Sham Democracy the next
House but that was a miscount, and not one
of that commOner sort whereby they largely
profit.


AS if there were not already distractions
enough, Gen. Chamberlain was brought for
ward as a candidate for the U. S. Senate in
place OF the Hon. Lot NJ. Morrill,, whose term
expires with the present Congress- and the
Democrats in each city and several townships
ran candidates for the Legislature pledged
to support Chamberlain, and thus secured
the votes of the Chamberlain Republicans.
Many Republican towns have thus been car
ried, not only on the Legislative but also on
the State and Congress tickets.


With all these sdewinds to help them, the
adversary should have carried the State, or at
least Lynch's district; but they have in
fact accomplished nothing that will avail"

that has been introduced thus far, the ses-
sion would probably last year from Mon
day I; but, as it is, enough of national in
terest has been brought into preliminary
shape to prolong the meeting far into the
midsummer months In the House there
have been already introduced over six
hundred bills. This is without precedent
in the busy days of the war OF this num-
ber over twenty-four are for railroad
schemes, land grants for the same, etc
twenty are for appropriations; thirty relate
to financial matters six propose to change
our naturalization system two are inten-
ded to change the apportionment of Rep
resentatives among the people; five pur-
pose to reconstruct the State of Virginia,
and three are intended to abolish the frank
ing privilege. These are but specimens of
contemplated legislation on the part ofthe
House. In the Senate, nearly four hun
dred bills are pending in that body and
before its committees but it should not
be forgotten that two-thirds of these mea-
sures are inherited from the brief session
of last April, and that they in turn were
pending in the Fortieth Congress, and
were re-introduced as the legitimate result
of their failure to squeeze into enactments
in that Congress and, in fact in each
House, bills of the same general character,
and even of the same text, have been in
troduced OF course, action on one will
offset action on the other.


Outside of legislation on the financial
question, reconstruction seems to stand
pre-eminent Virginia comes first on the
list, and it is not easy to predict what
will be the result of the various measures
relating to this State, now in embryo,
before the Reconstruction Cmmittee. 1t
is believed, however, that while further
exactons will be made, tho State will f.
nally be restored to the Union without the
iemodeling of the Legislature. Missis-
sipp thus far stands without objection.
Military rule there has done its work, and
the result is so overwhelmingly on the
Radical side that the State will probably
slip into representation in Congress with
out further hindrance; but as to Texas
which State is to close up the great Radical
programme of Radical reconstruction
the result cannot SO well be anticipated.
General Reynolds writes that she is ad-
ministration all through, including Gov
ernor and Legislature. If this be confr-
med, the minority in Congress will be
over-trodden as in the Georgia bill, and
all opportunity to expose the frands of the
Radicals in Texas-which seem to be as
shameless as they are extensive-will be


denied by the majority,


Eollnuinn tbic ,,nactinn ooinng that of
finance. The Senate committee will soon


be incubating on Secretary Boutwelps


four and half per cent. funding bill, as


well as the measure to redeem thirty-five


millions of three per cent. certificates and


issue National Bank notes in lieu of them.
The House Banking Committee will will


also be obliged to decide between imitation


or contraction, whether it will favor the


issue of forty four millions more legal ten
dcrs, as provided in Mr.. Ingcrsoll's bill,
or let the volume of currency remain
where it is. Besides this committee
has four bills before it providing for free
banking. Then there is Lynche's bill to
provide for specie payments, and, in the
Senate committee Shcrman's bill to pro-
vide for redistribution of the national
bank currency, which corresponds with
Coburn's bill before the House COM
mittec for the same purpose. The
daily Bulletins of the Ways and Means
Committeeman inappropriatcly styled
sometimes, "" the Committee of Mean
Ways""-show that they are about to finish
a new tariff bill, and to follow it with a
new tax bill.


Going back to the Senate VIC find a.
mong its important measures Senator Fer
rys universal amnesty bill Schurz's civil
service measure; Mr. Williams's bill tc
regulate Chinese immigration; the eigh


hour question, 80 earnestly opposed by the


Vermont Morrill, the several bills to Civ,
new steamship lines the ocean postage
the bills from the House to take the nintl
5 census, to incorporate the Washington in
ternational exhibition scheme, to admi
! Colorado as a State, and to hit polygam,
blow in Utah. Much of the time of til
, House will be taken up with the twent.
f contested election cases; and, singular t.
: say, the FIRST one to be called up is to give tn
e seat to a Democratic claimant from Sout

question bills, to prohibit further treaties


and to make the bureau Independent of Il
ID Interior Department, are pending in ii
Iv House. There are half dozen constitl
IS tional amendments, one of which propos,

rs likely to pass. So it will be seen tn
IN there is enough for Congress to do, if
es keeps within moderate channels. If

the bill. He argued In favor OF expansion rather
than Of contraction and declared that II they could
not have contraction II they could not advance
they would not retreat.


Mr.. HOLMAN, ldem) OF Ind., expressed his conyic-
ton that the bill would fall, and condemned the ha-
uonal banking system, declaring nat the whoie
machinery OF the government enied 10 be In lis IN
terest No government had ever SHOWN much
favor 10 capital and much Indifference 70 labor as

movement IN the interest OF capital.

MIR. KERR (dem.) OF Ind, opposed the bill. lie
characterized II as not compliance with the order
OF the House, but as an evasion Of 1t. IL offered no
reeG to the currency. IL proposed nothing but dis
turbance and unsettuig conditions, without improv

currency that tue country had. 1t proposed TO
diminish the power Ono corporation, but Immensely

preme IN the control OF the financial policy and
future legislation OF the country. lie was opposed
to the bill Decause IT would operate as a contraction

withdrawing every dollar Of national bank circua-

TO all the existing currency.


Mr. OZARK, trep.l OF Texas. argued in favor Of re-

Mr.. BINGAxA, trep.) OF Ohio, moved to amend the

striking Out the succeeding sections except the

Mr.. GARFIELD in reply to his colleague said that

law applied to Them lie offered as substiTute the
original bill with sections three, four, five six and

Mr. lNGEKsoLL remarked that there was no ad-

In reply TO inquiries the SPEAKER stated thar tho

cedence Of all other substitutes and thar u the irs

Mr.. Voorhees,, the victim Of Chambers, the
murderer, died at his house yesterday. An
informal examination Of the prisoner and the
statement Of the proprietor Of the saloon
where the shooting took place show that the
murder was even more cold -blooded and
wanton than at first reported. The murderer.
1t seems, had drauk several bottles of wine
with his intended victim, and even after the
deed was done called for and coolly drank 4
glass Of ale. Late last night Sheriff Walters.
fearing the excited state Of the people against
Chambers, asked for detachment Of soldiers
to guard Raymond street jail The soldiers
were promptly sent, and bore with them ball
cartridges enough TO do execution upon the
mob If need be. The people Of Brooklyn are
much excited over this brutal murder. and
although We deprecate lynch law, we can SEQ
plainly in this exhibition the end to which
corrupt Judges and rampant crime ars rapidly

SEVERAL OTHER WITNESSES

and Mr.. jerks rose and moved for acquittal, the
ground that the evidence was insufficient connect
the defendant with any fraud there.


Judge Gilbert consulted with mis- associates mo.
tue evidence was not sufficient TO impcate the de-
endant. He therefore directed the jury to reuder
verdict Of acquittal which they did, and Lynch was
then discharged.


HOW BARNEY MAHoNEY WAS FIDDLED OUT OF THE


RETURNS-THE FIRST CONVICTION.


At the conclusion or Lyncn's trial Judge Gilbert
inquired OF the District Attorney as to whether he
had any other cases ready Tor trial.


Mr.. Morris replied In the affirmative and called on
the case OF Barney Mahoney, canvasser In the Sec
ond district Of the Sixteenth ward, who indicted
on the charge Of having wilfully lost the returns

admitted by the defence, who claimed that 1t was
accidental. f


The defendants version Of the story was that on
election night Mr. Bradley, associate canyasser and
himself, counted the votes. Bradley said ne could
not remain TO sign the returns as he mad to get up
early In the morning and go to work.


MAHONEY SLEPT THERE
until one O'Clock the next morning, and hep for the
nrst time ascerained that Bradley had left without
signing the returns Barney thereupOn retairned
home himself and afterwards signed the papers. He
went down to The SherYs Office during tho forenoon,
thinking that that Official would send an officer for
Bradley at the Navy Yard, wnere the latter was 1T
work. The Sheriff was not In and Barney then went
TO the ONCE OF the Superintendents OF the Poor and
LAID the returns carefully on the flo0r against the
wall moment thereafter


A WANDERING MINSTREL,
In the person OF dllapidated fiddler, appeared IN
llcatlon OF the assembly. This proposition met with
favor and ye minstrel commenced. lie fiddied away
vigorously for some time. Barney was 50 absorbed
In the music that he forgot all about the precious
papers on the floor, and 1t was only after the min
ste had departed that he awOKe from the charm
splred by the music to full realization OF mundane
afairs. lie looked for the returns; but 10 they
were gone J And from that day to this ne saw them
no more.


In his charge TO the jury, Judge Gilbert, said that
II they were oil the opinion that the defendant had
not wilfuly lost the papers they should acqult him,

OF John Lynch, who was q canvasser IN the Third
district OF the Eleventh ward. He was defended By
Aessrs. Crenvie T. jerks, Winchester Brit
ton and John II, Bergen. Ex-Judge Moore
was associated with District Attorney Morris
in the prosecution. There was an immense
crowd In the court room, among whom
were noticed number of city and county officials
and various politicians OF the smaller fry, all o
whom take an interest in these cases. But little
at about eleven O'Clock District Attorney Morris
arose to open the case for the people.


THE STORY OF THE RLEcrIoN FRAUDS.


In opening the case for the prosecution District
Attorney Morris said:-


GENTLEMEN OF THE JURy-You have been called
upon 10 discharge an important duty You are aware,
every other citizen In Our community Is are
that certain parties have been lndicted, charged with
violation OF the election laws This, gentlemen,
mas always been regarded as very serious offence,
because IL strikes al the very foundation and theory
OF our government. lt Is NOT necessary gentlemen
that should call your attention to the importance,
therefore, o. preserving the purity OF the ballot box.
You are all, ana must be, sensible OF that fact.
Ever since The foundation or our government 1t has
been among the first business the legislatures OF
the purity OF the ballot box.


EVERY CONCEIVABLE VIOLATION


OF that right has been made cnme and penalties
have been ai1xed Tor the violation Of The various
laws uesgned to protect the Dai0t. Hitherto prose.
cutons Tor violations OF the election laws have not
Oeen very frequent, and usually against indlvldu-
ais Tor voting without the right 10 vote--yer
few cases other than OF that cass-and it has always
neen considered grave crime ana courts have IN
flcted severe penarles upon persons conyicred for
Illegally depostlng or Illegally receiving single
sele ve1ous Ama nna ~ Il IS crime and It
ton OF the law, what must II be when combIna.
tion is formed to disranchlse an entire community,
TO subvcrt the very foundation OF our government
by prosutatng the ballot box for selfish purposes
Yet, gentlemen Buch mas been the allegation and
such assert here IN the prcence Of this court ana
OF tn1s Jury, knowing full well the responsibility that
have assumed, to De fact. You all recolect zen.
tlemen, the last election. You recolect that there
was


FEELING OF DISSATISFACTION
and insecurity In the community, and when the
returns began to come In the night OF the I'd OF
November 1t was apparent to every man IN the com.
munity that the people mad spoken out plainly, de-
terminedy, Irrespective OF party lines, with refer.
ence 70 our local AFFAIRS; and II was further evident
from the shape In which the returns were received
70 the most casual observer or political AFFAIRS that
the ballot box mad been IN many instances tampered
running away behind bis ticket and H,s'iSs in the
adjoining district running 200 or 800 ahead.
Such asresuit was unnatural; such result
never honestly follows an election But 1t appeared
when the returns came IN, so overwhe ming had
been the expression OF the people, that the lusru-
ments that had been emp Dyed to carry cur the be-
their purpose. And the next day you began to hear
rumors all over tnat there were


MISTAKES IN THE RETURNS


as they were sent to police headquarters on tho
night OF the election. mistake here ana mistake
the announcements was made tnat the result that
was announced on the night or the election was
not the true result. The man whom the figures
elected on the ngnt OF the election is not elected

THE TAX ON COAL.


Mr.. MAYNARD, trep.) OF Tenn. from the Committee
Of Ways and Means, reported the bill to relieve coal
from all taxation, and moved its reference to the
Committee Of the Whole.


Mr.. HOOPER, rep.) Of Mass, made minority re.
port and moved tie same reference.


The bill was read. 1t provides that there shall not
be collected any duty whatever on any coal imported
into the United States after the 3lst of December 1870
nor shall there be required any nternalrevenue stamp
on any receipt manifest, charter party conveyance,
lease, contract, or other instrument Of which coal
forms the exclusive chief subject Of considerations
nor shall any enumeration be made in taxing gross
receipts from the transportation or conveyance
OF coal; nor shall any spec III tax be i'm
posed on any vehicle or vessel, by land or water,
employed exclusively or cnieay III carrying coal;
nor snail any tonnage duty be imposed upon or
exacted from such vessels nor shall sales OF by
aucloneers or Others be Included in The estimate OF
of coal or from dealing therein be included In
putting incomes lor taxation; nor shall any other
tax be imposed on coal or traffic In it.


The minority report, which s signed by Messrs.
Hooper, Allison, Brooks and Marshal, states that
there were two members absent when the matter
with the bill as reported by the majority and, there
fore, proposed substitute: and that If all the men,
bers Of the committee had been present the minority
bill would have been adopted.


The substitute provides that ON and after the 1st
OF September, 1870, bituminous and other coal i'm
ported into the United States shall be admitted free
OF duty.


Mr. DIckEY crep.) Of Pa, objected to the minority


Mr. scnENoK, Tep.l of Ohio, Chairman Of the Com
mttee OF Ways ana Means, asked and obtained per.
instructing tho committee on. the subject had been
adopted on Monday the 9TH: He had proceeded
Academy his SssiS haa BEEN that he ,e commtes
should obey the order OF the House at the earliest
practicable moment, and reportsyacksa btl In con.
formity with what he understood to be that order.
The resolution waas, ""Tnat the Committee OF Ways
and Means Is hereby instructed at the earliest mo.
on coaiS The succeeding Words $50 as to secure
that important article of fuel to the people free from
all taxation"" he regarded as simply construction
OF inference from the ORDER and not precisely sus-
tained by It, lie had himself prepared a bill and
submitted u to the committee placing coal on the
he should, as matter OF course, have voted for that
or Its equivalent. He wished 1t TO he un derstood
now that ne conquered In o2inlon with the min orty


After further discussion the bill was recommitted
to the Committee OF Ways and Means.
THE CURRENCY BILL.


The House then proceeded to vote on the Currency
bill and amendments.


The amssdments offered by Messrs. Ingersol,
Lynch and Smith Of Oregon were severally rejected.


Mr. GARFIELD, trep.) Of Ohio, proceeded to STATE
the effect of the substitute offered by him and OF the
amendment appended thereto.


Mr.. Cox, (dem.) Of N. Y, asked him whether he
believed that by this legislation there was any step
taken towards the resumption OF specie pQymentY
MI. GARFIELD feared not.
MI. Cox-Tnen 1t Is retroprade movement. Why
does not the chairman OF the Banking Committee
stand by the recommendation Of the President, VINO
said that return to specie payment should be COM
menced now and reached at the earliest practicable
moment? All the values OF the country are depend
ing on these fluctuations. Why does not the Chair
man come forward and apply the heroic remedy9


Mr.. GARFIELD remlgded Mr.. Cox that she demo.
amendments proposing an expansion OF paper cur
rency The gentleman himself had voted for an Issue
dollars.


MI. RANDALL, (dem.) Of Pa.-Not an issue, but a
substitution.
Mr.. misunderstanding to the gentleman's own
account that would be an imitation Of the whole
volume Of the currency by at least twenty NIL
Mr.. Cox said that he had voted that way on pro-
position as between national banks and greenbacks
but even If he had done wrong that was no excuse
for the gentleman fr0m ONO, who sh0ud come up
and do his duty.


Mr.. soHENoK expressed his qualification that the
| bill had assumed, II modified as proposed, such u
form to meet two or three OF the public demands
Its section as to coin notes was inthe direction Of
return to specie payment, and he was satisfied with
| that portion OF the bill.


| Mr. CoBURN notified him that that portion Of the
| bil mad been struck out.


Mr. SoHENCK said If that were so 1t removed one of
his reasons for supporting the bill. He would sup
port 1t, however. for It's features in equazing dstr
! button. In conclusion, he expressed the hope that
adopted, saying that If so he would support the b
He congratulated The country thai, III passing the





for more equal distribution OF banking circulation
and banking facilities, without thereby contracting
| the currency.


Mr.. HoTcnKIss rep.) of N. Y, moved the adoption
OF Mr. judas amendment, and pr0iesscd his wiling
ness then to vote for the bill.
The question was taken on Mr.. Judd's amendment
and 1t was agreed TO without the yeas and nays.
The question was next taken on Mr. Allison's
amendment which was "" add to the last section the
following wOrds:-


from and after the passage Of this act shall be un


lawful for any national bank association 70 pay interest on
deposits received from and deposited by any national
include in Its lawful money any deposits on
which interest is received or paid.
The amendment was rejected-yeas CO. nays o.
The next amendment was that offered by Mr.
Burchard requiring national banking associations to
retain and Keep In coin or Treasury coin certn-
Gates, as part OF tner reserve the interest falling due
upon their ponds deposited as security for clrcula-


on, until the reserve required to be kept shall con-

The next amendment was that offered by Mr. Co.

A correspondent Of the louisville Comm rcidi
gives the following particulars OF the recent lynch
iug in Mount Vernon, Ky: Tho whole part OF the
county was thrown iuto state Of excitement some
days ago over terrible murder committed just
gcrOes R1ckcastle river, in the border OF Laurel
county. The victims name was =. ii. Bullock,
young lawyer OF Laurel county and Of good standing
~ a citizen Young Bullock resided on his ather's
nrm, between whom and some Of his neighbors and
relations, by the name of Parker, there has, for
above stated. in the death OF young Bullock. and the
woundin. OF his Httlo brother, 10 years old, Eve
times. The Buliocss were planting corn In field
adjoining a very dense wood; advancing toward IL,
they were suddenly nrc1 on on; of the brush by Eve
or six persons two persons escaped unhurt Of tie
party In the lold.


There was positive proof against the Parkers,
but great many strong circumstances pointed to
them as the murderers, AMI according ely they we're
arrested and atter some DELAY tried before an exam
bail. On Saturday morning last Qith), at about'one
O'Clock, the guards state that from two hun
dred men, all In disguise, suddenly surrounded the
Jail and demanded tho keys telling the guard they

the Pennsylvania Central has secured posses
sion OF the Alexandra and Fredericksburg road,
and also Of the charter 5f the Washington and
Alexandria road which makes its connections
with the city Of Washington through George
town, crossing the Potomac on or near tho
aqueduct- This line will give competition with
Charlottesville shorter than by the Orange and
Alexandria road, and In junction with the Balti-
more and Potomac road win give new route
from Baltimore to Staunton shorter than the
road mp the Valley, and over better grades than
BY the present road ria Harpers Ferry.


The Baltimore Gazette sees in this project an
argument In favor of the proposed subsc ription
by the city Of Baltimore to build the Lynchbure
and Danville link by which Baltimore will get 4
stil nearer route TO the great cotton center than
Pennsy lvania will attain through this new
route. Competition win then force Penusyl-
vanta capitalists to run Baltimore freiRhts over
their southern roads at Baltimore rates.
The new route will form junction with the
Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad; and ""A IL Ia
much more to the interest Of this road TO carry
its freight to Charlottesville than to stop IL at
StauntoD, the Pennsylvania interest viii have
advantages over the Valley route. The Gazette
therefore urges that the Valley Road shall be
pushed forward promptly, and says that delay
Is fraught with danger, especially to the Balti-
more and Ohio Railroad, which now has q DOW
erful and earnest rival working actively for a
most valuable trade which Baltimore ought al
ready TO control, and can iii afford to lose.


1t remains to be seen just how much Washing
ton Is to be the gamer by this contest of these
rival interests for the Southern trade: hut one
thing Is certain, We have nothing to lose by it.
and may pick up some crumbs OF advantage.
III appears that the coming season is to be one of
considerable activity in the way Of railroad con-
strueton In this vicinity and south Of Washing
ton."

We call particular attention to the fact that the
three American Archbishops who have signed the
protest represent more Catholics and larger OF
territory than united or disunited italy and the

DEAR JOURNAL; | notice in your columns the
| evidence given by Brunswick shipmasters regard
ing their present occupation. Being called as wit
nesses, they were compelled to say, one that he
''was Il gentleman loaer,"" another that he ''fed
chickens and tended babies,"" sc. We here in
Stockton not better off than our Brunswick
brethren. Some OF us are pulling rockweed, some
selling fish in the streets. One has moved west,
turned doctor, and Is etfecting wonderful cures in all
the ills that flesh Is her to, from prolapsllS ueri to
corns and bunionS. Some are trying to run porgie
presses, and many are gentlemen loafers. Such is
the condition of our shpmasters, myself among the
number Like otheIlo, my occupation is gone,""
and am casting about to how | can support
myself and family.


| For years we have faced storms, and been de-
prived of the society of our families and friends.
AS a class we have done much to enrich the coun-
try for have been in pursuit of wealth to bring
into it. All through the late we labored under
the disadvantage of heavy way insurance our
! property, beset by pirates at sea, taxed heavily
both at home and abroad and our country afford
ing not the least protection. Yet toiled on,
hoping for relief. Now that st he cruel war is over""
what relief have wefonnd Why poverty, starva-
ton, and heavy taxes that sweep away what little
we have saved. In addition our hands are so tied
| by taxes and prohibitions that we can earn no
more. Many of us are on the shady side of life,
where the learning of new trades professions is
impossible. We are totally unfit for the sharp
practices of trade and traffic A II Of the sailors
who have tried it, with few exceptions, have
| failed


| We have all looked to Mr.. Lynchs bill for some
relief and employment, by revival of com
mcrce but that has been sent to the tomb of all the
Capulets. We have now but little hope from so
selfish vile and thoroughly corrupt government.
where British gold can purchase the votes of our
| lawmakers and consign us to idenesS and poverty
We have been asked to vote for protection, and
Maine has lent her aid to the protection Of Penn
sylvania, and vet to-day that State refuses to give
us protection of any kind.


We have been led, like asses, to vote for our own
destruction. Many an honest sailor has been fired
with enthusiasm at the cry of rebellion and treason
to taking what he supposed to be his country's
side-but alas it was for the country's ruin. By


ignorance of political intrigue, he has been stabbing
the country when he supposed he was protecting
It-helping to enrich the rich, and making the poor
poorer But we are now opening our eyes to see


the hideousness of these corrupt and vile partizans


Like the maiden in the Midsummer Nights Dream,


we wonder how we could have been in love with


an ass.


Our townsman, Hon. N. G. Hichborn, has


labored hard at Washington to carry this bill


through, for which we thank him. But he was


largely instrumental, with others, in bringing


about this same state of things. And his vision,


too, is clearer, think, than formerly.
And now, my dear Journal, can you suggest to
I,c


selvest We could pick oakum, but there are no


ships to caulk, and consequently no oakum wanted.

WHAT SHOULD COMMERCIAL MEN DO


We sympathize most heartily with the unemploy-
ed shipmaster, who writes the sorrowfully humor-
Gus letter which we publish to-day, and we sympa-
thze with the class for which he speaks. Their
case is one of peculiar hardship. The American
shipmasters rs Il class have conferred honor upon
the country abroad by their intelligence, enterprise
and gentlemany demeanor, as the ships they COM
manded did upon the mechanics who built and the
shipping merchants who owned them Wherever
the american flag loated from masthead, there
were certain to be found the most faultess models,
the staunchest workmanship. and the most eX-
cellent qualities in the commander. 1t was the
pride and the boast of travelled Americans that no
country was so faithfully and creditaby represe Mt
ed abroad by its mercantile marine, as the United
States. Nor were appearances and qualities by
any means the chief merit. What was of more
importance to the country, there was profit in
building and sailing American ships. They poured
a constant stream of wealth into the country, that
flowing through all the arteries and veins of trade,
invigorated encouraged and enriched every calling.
Let our shipwrghts and mechanics of all kinds, as
well as captains and seamen, think of the flourish
ing and flush times previous to 1860, when employ
ment sought them rather than that they asked for
employment, and money came rapidly into their
handS-when they could buy comforts and 1uXu-
ries for their families, and Gull here and there
holiday for rest and recreation


| How is all this changed. The stars and stripes
are almost unknown in foreign ports; the hand
some American ships are no more; the shipyards
! are silent and deserted; the seabOard towns are
eating into the capital gained in other years. the
golden stream Of money from frcghts earned now
swell the purses of our Provincial neighbors.
These are ugly facts, but they facts, and must
be looked in the face The cause is not myster
GUS or hidden. 1t plainly lies in vicious and stupid
legislation by Congress. We say vicious and
stupid, because the terms appropriate, and
accurately describe the thing 1t is not for lack of
light on the subject, that the unwse course is per-
sisted in. Facts and figures have been laid before
that body, showing whittier we are tcndng-show-
ing that the sceptre of the seas, which our brave
seamen and adventurous merchants wresteh from
England, is returning to her grasp But it has fallen
upon cold and Indifferent ears. With the failure
of the Lynch bill, went out the last hope of Amer-
can commerce from this Congress.


Our correspondent asks what we Wond advise
as an employment for men of his class. We feel
more like counselling course for all whose inter
ests are connected with commerce. II is fact that
they have not as class been true to themselves
they have not insisted, As other interests have in
sisted, upon their rights, and emphasized their de-
mand at the polls For instance, here are the peo-
pie of the Fifth Congressional District of Maine,
embracing greater extent of sea-coaSt and more
maritime towns than any other, stretching as 1t
does along more than two hundred miles of coast
line, from Thomaston to the British provinces. 1t
is represented in Congress by gentleman, who,
however amiable and accomplished he may be- has
had no experience in the main business of his dis
trct, and but little observation of it. lie is bound
in addition, by the usages caucuses and discipline
of his party, which party is adverse to relieving or
encouraging the shipping interest. The very fact
that such man represents the district, is most
potent reply to the petitions send for relief.
We commit suicide, and ask to have our life pre-
served, at one and the same time. The iron feterS
of party usage and discipline will bring Mr.. Hale
again before the people of this district to ask for
re.eeptiOn He will come hurthnne1 with tho
damning record of Congress on the shipping ques.
ton, and his friends will ask that the ship owners
ship builders and sailors again give him their votes


Now the short and direct way for the commercial
men of this district to make their numbers and in.
huence felt, is to refuse to have themselves and
their interests bought and sold in the arrangements
and bargaining of the radical party. There are
gentlemen of intelligence, honor and weight who
are or have been engaged in the shipping business
and understand its needs, and who would wei
represent the Fifth District, in that and all Other
particulars We have such an one, in Knox Coun
ty, in our mind at this moment. If such Il mar
) should be brought before the people, could the
numerous populations of the great sea-coast towns
well protect their business and interests, as by
supporting him for Congress ? The fcttcrs thai
bind rs must be broken, and where can a blow be





and liberal man be sent to Congress from the Fifth
District OF Maine, and the party that controls Con
gress win see that the shipping interest and the
support of commercial men must be concatel
f and sought. So long as we bow our necks meekly
and INCREASINGLY, SO long we shall have burdens
laid upon us.


OREGON. The first news from this Pacific
State was to the effect that the election was
very close and doubtful We predicted
from the language of that announcement, {
decided Democratic triumph, which prove.
to be the case. The Democrats have elected
: the Governor by a handsome majority The,
= have also a majority of 10 on Joint ballot, ir
n the Legislature. This will oust u S. Senate
! Williams. and ensure a Democrat in hi
place for six years to come. A Democratic
It Representative to Congress is also chosen
The way things are going on, the radical
r will have to work pretty lively to proven
Congress from becoming Democratic body
Connecticut, New York and Oregon show
. strong tendency in that direction

e ale and liquor were seized on board steame"

DcRth Of Lopez.",,"Tho End or tho Paraguay war-Rcported


Death OF Lopez.


We have so often reported the death of
Lopez that we generally doubt even so-called
CONFIRMED"" reports Of it from Brazilian
sources; but the despatch published else
where gives such full particulars that we
are compelled to believe 1t. Only the
other day Lopez had gained decisive victory
over the allies, being in strong force and fully
determined to continue the Paraguayan war
to an indefinite issue. The allies several
months ago had withdrawn entirely, leaving
the country in the hands of q provisional gov
ernment, and so completely ignoring Lopez
that a casual student Of the war might have
believed he was of no Importance whatever.
Then again Lopez was fleeing to Bolivia, was
not quite captured two or three times and has
died oftener than any other man even in South
America. Now, it seems, he was surrounded,
and, refusing to surrender, was killed by
Brazilian lancer, while his mother, sister and
Mrs. Lynch were captured.


If it be true that he Is dead, then the Para
guayan war is ended. He was the heart and
soul, the brain and nerve that inspired,
planned, directed and executed it. The people
were his, and his slightest words were
edicts that they promptly obeyed. They
have remained unse6shly true to him and
Paraguay through six years Of war waged
with unrelenting bitterness by powerful enc
mics. With the little band Of soldiers that his
little republic could muster he met at every
turn the overwhelming force of the invaders,
and after his army was depleted and worn out
with sickness and death even the women Of
the country took arms and served. The ques-
ton of his personal character is one that needs
to be fully studied-for upon it devolves the
solution of diplomatic problem now pending
in our own Congress-bgt that he was tyrant
is ~hoiiy ~hoiiiy aaisproved by the steady devotion of
his people. With his death and the close Of
the Paraguayan war ends the record Of one
of the most hardy fights of weaker nassion
against stronger that has been seen since
the first making of history. 1t has not been
wholly fight of Fabian tactics, such as
Fabius conducted against Hannibal or Russia
against Napoleon, although it has partaken OF
that character at times. In the main, it has
been fair stand up fight, wherein bravery,
patriotism and skill have been pitted against
numbers, and bravery, patriotism and skill
would have won the day had the leader been
shared"

A FEARFUL PICTURE


Not more than ten minutes had elapsed after
the Rendalls were seen to enter the fatal house
when Mrs. Frances Weeks, living GEAR Buckhout
beard two reports nom rhe discharge OF . gan in
quick succession, but she at first paid attention
to the matter. Her womany curiosity prevailed In
D Short time, and she proceeded towards tho house.
meeting Buckhout who passed her without speak
ing. On entering the open door terrible scene
vision, ana sne fed In terror terror from the the
spot Some other persons, who were near
caught the ALARM and on gong to the house discov-
cred the dreadful extent OF the tragedy In the sit
ting room Alfred Kendall was discovered seated on
o chair his feet crossed, dead. and surrounded by
pool OF blood, his neck having received the murder
ous charge OF bucksh0t. which severed the carotid
artery and divided tho spinal chord producing
portion OF goblet, out Of which he had been drink
ing cider, and It Is thought that When he first
saw Buckhoat point the weapon at him
hlmser anu the shot striking this carried away the
upper part OF 1t. Lying bleeding and insensible on
SOi0 III INC bHWo 0puILincnt was fOunQ Charles
Kendall, having received frigntful wound in the
right temple, which had penetrated the eye and
carried away . portion OF tno face. In o kitchen
adjoining the sitting room Mrs. Buckhout lay ap-
parently Dead her skull smashed In sickenlng
manner by blows from gun, the stock OF
woman. Having emptied botn chambers Of .
double barr0lled gun into the bodies OF the Rendalls
It would appear that BuckhOnt entered the kitchen,
and having broken tho stock Of the gun into frag-
ments on the head OF his wife, struck her again
with she barrels, sinking the hammers Of the trig
gers into her BRAIN She expired shortly after being
discovered. Charles Kendall at once had surgical
attention. but no was still insenstble last evening,
and 1t was thought impossible he could survive
much longer his injuries being considered Of fatal
nature.


THE MURDERER sURRHNDERs HIMSELF.


After leaving the house BucknOut walked about
mile to the dwelling or Ira Miller OF his neigh
bors. and on approaching him exclaimed. ''I'm
ruined man; shot Charley Kendall"" The former ex-
pressed his disbelief OF the statement when Buckhout
repeated the words. ana. handing him revolver,
said, II surrender myself to you; take Tarry-
town, as iear the neighbOrs are after me and will
lynch me-"" Upon examining the revolver Miller
found one chamber empty and oil the others loaded.
Buckhouts assertion Miller drove him To Tarrytown
ana gave him into the custody OF Constable Alfred
Lawrence. who took him to White Plains Jall.


THE INQUEST.


coroner van 1agSel held an inquest on tho bodies
Of Mrs. Buckhout and Alfred Kendall, In the house
where the murders occurred, yesterday, during
which It appeared from the testimony OF young
woman diving IN part OF the dwelling, and occu-
pied oy man who titled Buckhouts farm ons

she heard no noise preceding or AFTER tho shooting
nor did she go In to see what the matter. Mrs.

THE ROBBERS HAND.",,"Let me see,"" began Mr.. Worden, in
response to a request to tell story, while
we were seated around the stove in Mills
bar room, one clustering night last win
ter. :"" Let me see. Twenty-Five years
ago, l entered the store of Day & Co. as
clerk, and twenty-one years ago came the
night of the first Of February, l had an
adventure which l shall never forget""


We drew our benches near the stove
and the retired merchant, whom we knew
had good story in store for us. At my
side, on the oaken settee, sat a man
judging by his slvered hair--about five
and sixty. He was traveller, and a
stranger to our entire party; and during
our conversation previous to the mer-
chants narrative, had been taciturn and
moody. But when Mr.. Worden began
his story his eyes were fixed upon his
face.


II was not seventeen"" continued the
narrator, "" when became clerk, and
it was great event in my life. The firm
told me that would have to sleep in the
store. ] felt proud of being allowed to do
so it showed that they had great faith in
my honesty. So lounge was brought in
and placed under the counter, and there,
after locking the door, I would lay and
dream till daylight


During the first part of the winter of
4S our neighboring county (Herkimer)
was infested with gang of daring rob-
bers, whose depredations were both bold
an alarming. Tho good paople became
excited; and we'll might they, for the
villains scrupled not to take the life of any
one who dared to defend his property.


Vigilance committees were formed, and
the gang broken up. Several of the vill-
aims were captured, and their cases decid-
cd by Judge Lynch. Those who escape
the committee went into neighboring coun
ties, and ours received few. Duriu-
January several bold robberics were c..
mitted in Dalton, which threw our ciI-
Zcns into the highest state Of excitement
but all efforts-and those made were stren-
Gus ones-to catch the robbers were una
vailng


Day & Co. during the excitement, sat
back in their easy chairs, laughing at the
peoples scare. They fancied their store
secure, and when 1 asked to be permitted
to keep gun at my bedside, twitted me
at what they termed my cowardice. 1t
was not cowardice, boys; but l wanted to
give the robbers bold reception if they
paid me visit. I thought they would
not fail to do this, for my employers
held in their hands large sums of money
belonging to other people--in short, they
were the bankers of the village. The
money was enclosed in a safe, which 1
knew would not resist an experienced bur
glar. But they thought the safe secure,
and refused to grant my request.


I had made up my mind to arm myself,
let the firm call me what it wished. 1
lived in Montauk then, few miles from
Dalton, and one Sunday night, the last
of January, when returned from a visit
home. l brought along an old sabre, which
my grandshire had used against Scranton,
at Sanders Creek. That Sabbath night,
as I we'll remember, did not retire until
near midnight, for l sat up polishing the
old blade. At last, when the light shin
ing upon it blinded me, put it in the
sheath and stood it against the head of the
lounge and went to sleep, feeling that
could overcome a dozen of the fercest
robbers that ever made woman or child."

greater contrast, than was apparent be

however, large number were present

the scholars observed and appreciated
that first requisite of a good school

The examination ofclasses showed that
all proficiency in text books was based
upon broad mental culture-there was no
questioning nor answering by role. We
did not hear all of the classes recite, but
those we did hear, Fifth Reader, Rhetor-
ic, intermediate Written Arithmetic,
Physical Geography and Mythology, de
serve our warmest appreciation.


The rehearsals were highly creditable;
a number of them, indeed, were recited
beautifully. An of them with haplly an
exception were distinctly heard inSevery
part Of the room, an improvement on
former occasions, which it is very pleas
ing to mention.


At the conclusion of the regular exer
cises, short addresses were made to the
children by DR.. DIBRELL and Hon. j. b
OGDEN. Both gentlemen spoke with con.
siderable enthusiasm. They couldn't
help it, but did just as younger men
would have been compelled to do. e.

Upon drawing the tickets it was found
that GUsSIE MILLER, the smallest of the

where treaties have been made with Indians the
whites have been faithful to their obligations and the
Indians have been the repudiators. Not q single
treaty has been made that has not been abro-
gated time after time by the Indians. They have no
idea OF the obligations Of treaty. and no disposition
TO observe Its stipulaons Every Indian within the
exterior boundaries OF the United States has made
dozens Of treaties OF peace with our government
Just how these treaties have been observed by the
Indians propose to show from certain official re-
ports now before me. The following Is small por-
ton Of well authenticated statement OF the way the
Indians In Arizona observe their treaty obligations.

| HOW INDIAN AGENTS GET RICH.
Indian agents appear to think that an Indian can
! do no wrong. They get rich by trading with them,
and are OF course anxious that their trade shall
tlnue. Major Douglass OF the Third infantry makes
| the following report-

Between the authorized issue and the sales of the

In horses and furs and lead are sold to them
most the same rate and as the bulk IS small large quantities

anxiety cannot be caused by lack OF such articles
they have plenty TO last for time but everything
show that the indians laying IN large supplies prepara

too late, that have provided enemies with means
for destruction.

tingushed himself by address which he delivered
before the Society in 1918 on ""The Early European

Seme Interesting Revelations Regarding


the Lutte Parasuayan War.


RIo JINEIRo July 8, 1870.


While Mrs. Lynch was in port on board the City
Of Limerick little romance occurred. With her
came grown-up daughter of Lopez by another
woman, Of whom Mrs. Lynch has taken charge
for many years. This girl was with the little
army Of Lopez when he was killed, and was en-
gagged to be married to young Paraguayan
officer, the ceremony being appointed for the I'd
of March. But Lopez was slain on the Ist and
the lover captured aud sent as prisoner to
Rio Janero. On Mrs. Lynch coming to the port
of Rio the young lover and several Paraguayan
officers were allowed to go on board TO Mrs.
Lynch and her family. Further permission was
obtained for the lover to spend On board the night
before the vessel sailed with the family, and the
result was that, by permission of .he government,
a priest married the officer and the GIRL and he
proceeded to Europe in the vessel.


While Mrs. Lynch was at Buenos Ayres, DIR.
Stewart to whom Mrs. Lynch had confded Els 900
to be lodged to her and her cbildren's credit in
the Bank of Scotland, as appears by a receipt
given by him, but which he alleges was extorted
from him, arrived at the same place. he having





agricultural implements and other articles to sell
in Paraguay. AS luck would have IT, he went to
the same hotel as Mrs. Lynch, but when he heard
she was there he turned white as ashes, ordered
out his trunks in haste and hurried on board a
steamer bound up the river. II would appear that
he acted wisely for Mrs. Lynch had vowed to
horsewhp him first and shoot him afterwards, and
she looks like woman who would be as good as
her word in such matter.


While here Mrs. Lynchw was very anxious 10 have
talk with the Emperor, but she could not get
leave to get ashore, and only few influential
persons were allowed to see her. She made
some revelations in regard to the war which arc
not unnteresting, of which the following is the
substance


She states positively that the war with Brazil
was projected by Lopez in alliance with General
Urqniza and the B!ancos OF Montevideo and under
conditions OF probable success which rendered
the contederates sanenine as TO the result. Ac-
cOrding to the stipnlations between them Urquiza
was to have Correntes as well as Entire Rios and
the Oriental Republic was TO receive Rio Grande
do Sui.


Urquza was always leading Lopez TO believe
that Brazil medItated war against Paraguay
and with that end was sending large Quantities
OF arms and munitions to Matto Crosse, in ad.
dftion to which she was gong TO make with the
consent OF the Argentine government. a deposit
Of military material at Corrienes to aid Ia carry
ing on the operations from below. II is indubit
able that it was the promises Of Urquiza in regard
to cooperation with him that induced Lopez 20
declare war and invade Matto Crosse, Corrientes
and Rio Grande do Sui; but Urquiza perceiving
that the furnishing of the allied army would not
only be more safe but more lucrative to himself
personally, he repudisted his promised assistance
and left Lopez to his own resources.


Madame Lynch declares that Lopez was utterly
hopeless Of defending himself successfully after
the recrOssing Of the Paraguayan army over the
Parana, but that his hopes revived during the long
siege of Humaita, as the slowness OF the move.
ments of the Marquis dc Caxias inspired him with
confidence that he could tire the allies out, which
hopes were encouraged by the sending Of sums OF
money to bribe officials in the Paragusyan service
appearing TO demonstrate weakness Oh the part of
Brazil.


How Lopez and she escaped fran Lomas yalen.
tinas TO Ascurra she cannot imagine, as, had they
been followed for two hours, ell must have been |
captured on the road Even after their arrival |
at Ascura there were no means of defence: |
but when 1t became known that the Commander. |
in Chief had gone to Asuncion TO sing Te Deunts
the battle fields Of Villeta and Lomas were |
cleared Of all the arms left there by the Bra lillian
forces. Thus, twelve months more of bloodshed |
was caused by the abandonment Of the war after |
the battle of Lomas Valentinas, as for days Lopez
could see no prospect before him at Ascurra ex |
cept to surrender; but the cessation of operations
gave him fresh courage until he heard of the an.
pontment OF the Comte d'Eu and the return of |
Osorio.


For some time Lopez was kent informed ~ |
the movements OF the allies, through General
but after the departure of this minis
ter he remained in ignorance of what was doing.
The well.planned attack of the Comte dEu upon
the position Of Ascurra, which General MscMshon
had pronounced impregnable, completely ami
hated his hopes, and left him no resource but 10
carry on guerilla war in the expectation Of
wearying the Brazilians into terms; but at no
time during the whole course Of the war had Lopey
any intention whatever of leaving Paraguay
With the desire to seetre something for Madame
Lyncn ana MS children, Lopez sent off, at Angos-
tura, large sum in god consigned 10 Dr. Ste
warts brother and had il deposited in the Bank Of
scotland; but this sum s now denied 20 her.
although she holds Dr. Stewards receipt. Now,
her only hopes are vested In General MacMahon

WAsmNGToN, Tuesday, May n. 1870


The President to-day signed the Fifteenth Amendment
and the North Pacific Railroad bills.


After the reading Of the Journal in the House to-day
Mr. Lynch sought3the floor proceed with the bill for
the revival Of American Commerce, which had gone over
by adjournment from Thursday Sohonck
however, claimed The floor for the Tax b that having
been ordered even exclude the morning hour un

cussioD Mr. Lynch allowed to proceed with she un-
dcrstandng. as Gen. schenok supposed that il would

Lynch, however, understood that the matter ysa 10 la
proceeded with to-day, until the bill was dsposed Of
ont of this grew Misunderstanding which had = effect
upon the voting Mr. Lynch proceeded to speak re-
viewing the objections made to the bill by Messrs Wood
Allison, ingerso, and others The House apparently did
not desire 20 hear further speaking and an adverse
feeling created by Mr. Lynch's criticisms which
were; to say the least, quite pungert and
pointed. He had. however not occupies moro
than 10 or ~ minutes, when Gen. schenck
interrupted with a declaration that be had not
given way for o set speech. His opposition to the pend
ing measure has all along been apparent, and Mr. Lynch
seemed to regard the int Eruption unfricndy and
discOurtcous. More time consumed in rccrimna
ton and report, than would probably have been con.
sumcd by the Chairman of the Select Committee II he
had been allowed to finish uninterruptedy. When the
reporters notes read they showed that Gen
Schenck had made the condition that, II the bill Occu

there nothing prove that HOUSE 50 under
stood It.. Mr.. Lynch IL is charged, injured his bill
by pcrsistng in speaking when the House restless

jectonable nearly all American interests. The subst

was adopted by OF ""a to 49, and as the original bill
had all but similar provisions stricken out it
substituted therefor. At this point Gen. Schenek
attempted to obtain the floor and prevent the final vote,
but the House being determined to dispose OF the sub
jec the third reading called for, and the bill was
defeated by vote OF 81 to 100. The same votes
that had been cast 10 allow foregn-built ships free

obstinacy. The quite exciting all through the
debate and there great rejoicing at the result

pass but the only thing that is clear from the debate IA
that the abrOgatOn OF navigation laws cannot yet be
secured however hard British interests may wOrk.
There those who attribute the defeat to the temper
claimed to have been displayed by Mr.. Lynch. This.
however, Is only pretense.


The Tax bill was resumed to-day in the House, and
interesting debate occurred. Gen. Butler advocated





ton of taxes the end that the whole system of inter-
nal taxation may be done away with early possible;
he said that possible to pass the bill this
sOn that it is too long and cumbersome aud that it
ought take of the time Of Congress but that
a simple, short bill is what is demanded. Mr.. Schenck
defended the bill and its practcabiity and showed his
anxiety get through with it possible, in
order that it may go to the Senate. He was
it could pass, and he intended to press it,
He showed warmth the question, and
a determination TO push 1t forward, being sure
Of a majority OF the House Mr.. Judd adyo-
Gated his reform The House has already finished
half of the b and the opinion is general that it will be
completed this week discussion is likely 10 be had on
the income question: unless schenck insists upon
pressing the previous question. He insists that all the
members have made up their minds and speeches

State delegations in the House meet and decide upon the

doubt that the sentiment of the House in favor OF

to reduce the rate OF materially, and increase the

as he wrote them; but with our hearty con-
demnation. We assume that both Catholics
and Protestants are sincerely labOring to do
Gods will and advance the well-beng of man.
kind. Their difference is one of faith and not
of morals Let US seek to understand each
other fully. and not impute motives which are
yehemently disclaimed.


Mr.. Lynch believes that, if Bible-reading and
all religious Observances were excluded from
our Common Schools, the great body OF the
Catholic laity wonld cling to them, no matter
how sternly they might be mathematical by
their clergy. Now. he ought to be far better
authority on this point than We are; and yet
we are confident he is mistaken. II the prelates
and priests of their Church should denounce
our Common Schools, the Catholic laity would
very generally withdraw their children, no
matter how reluctantly. Mr.. Lynch's views,
therefore, though interesting as those of large
Glass; we cannot accept as authoritative.


The recent lecture of the Rev. Thomas S. Pres
ton, which was listened to by an immense as
semblaRe of the Catholic laity is, in our view,
of far greater consequence; because it embod
les the view of the School Question which un-
aoubtedly prevails in Rome, has of course
been adopted by nearly every Catholic priest,
and will soon bo commended to the laity by
the whole ecclesiastical power Of the Church.
In this cautious and guarded manifesto, Father
Preston says:


""Ths vss Of the Bible 10 the schools objected 10 BY"

Catholics do not accept tho Protestant version Prot
estsnts do not accept Those who do not admit
tho authority of the Scriptures do not naturally wish
| them TO DO read where their children arc educated.
There IS no remedy for this difficulty. AS far as our
opnIon goes We have regarded the reading OF
appropriate portions OF the Bible as any great obec-
ton IN itself Public Schoos provided that It be
done without comment attempts at Interpretation
Formerly customary for tho teacher to open the
exercises OF the day with prayer in which very often he
embodied his notions OF Scripture, and the peculiar
tiles OF his religious creed To great extent we believe
that this practice has been renounoed Still In many
ways the pupil will mbbe the opinions Of those whom
he respects from whom he expects to derive light In

exceptions, stand with Father Preston and not
with Mr.. Lynch. And the laity, if they are
not already in accord with the clergy on thls
point, ultimately will be.


Father Preston further says:

owe to our almighty Creator and mercifu Redeemer We
do not hold educating If he were the creature OF
time, aud notl the child of eternity. Hence we
are obliged establish schools Of our own where we can
give truly Christian training to our children""


All this seems to us wrong as wrong can
be- Father Preston might as reasonably object
to having Mathematics or Grammar taught
otherwise than by Doctor of Theology, on the
assumption that tho faith should be paramount
in all things. We say to Father Preston and
all who side with him. ""There is Sunday, set
""apart by law as day of religious instruction
""and worship. There are your churches and
"" other edifces and apartments dedicated to
""religlous uses. If you say. these do not
""sufiice, add Saturday, when we have no secular

adopted, thousands of children must grow up
without any secular instruction whatever""
This will not answer. In our view, Education
is no charity (Which Father Preston terms it)
but Urgent pnhlc necessity. We educate
our own children for their sakes we submit
to be taxed to educate others chill
dren because we dare not let them
grow up in ignorance with the destines OF the
Republic in their keeping. The State educates
her children in order that the State may not
be DESTROYED by them but cherished and up
held as the egis of their rights, their security,
their prosperity. She teaches whatever is
universally regarded as true and impartial;
wherever opinions gravely differ, the State
should remit each child to such incubation
as his parents may prefer. That is the
fairest and best that can be done: if
we give it up, we shall soon have no
Common Schools at all and no Free Education
for the children of the Poor We are willing
nay, anxious-to concede where concession is
not suicidal and will avail but our Common
Schools must stand. Any parent is welcome
to have his children educated elsewhere; but
this does not and should not absolve him
from doing his part toward the maintenance of
Commnn Schools"

Our special correspondence and newspaper
reports by mail from Europe, published to-day,
supply details of our Old World advices by
cable kilograms to the 8th of February. The
exhibit is Interestingly varied. Public atten-
ton will be fixed on the particular account Of
the great robbery which was effected at the
counter of one of the banks in England, by
which gentleman was deprived Of the sum of
nine thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds
sterling almost mysteriously, before his eyes
and in the presence OF many individuals. He
had the money chained to his person for
greater security few moments previously.
A description of the bank notes lost appeared
by advertisement in the HERALD yesterday
morning, having been forwarded specially to
this city for such publication, so that it is to
be hoped that if the thief turned ""his face to
the West"" he may be found by our police.
After the commission Of great crime there is
generally fair show of religion, so we have
also good deal about Rome, the Council, the
Syllabus, Infallibility the Annunciation and so
forth. The Pontifcal people have come out
in ''schemata"" that means, not
scheming, certainly-whch the famous Ger
man polemic, DR.. Dollinger, seeks to demolish,
with all it's antecedents and accompaniments,
setting forth how souls can be saved much
more simply-it may be effectually-""in the
mode he mentions"" The German doctor uses
vast force, and it is hoped he may succeed in
producing correspondingly good effect. NJ.

and many items of French and English news
are given. The minor details of this European
report are spicy and entertaining, affording
material for useful, brief notes Of the progress

ssFLAT BURGLARY. THE investigation Of
the sale of cadetships promises to open philo-
sophical question as to the definite character
of bribery. The committee set out to discover
whether or no Congressman sold these appoint
ments for money. They have discovered at
least that Congressman certainly sell the ap-
pointments. Will the fact that the pay is not
given in money satisfy the Congressional con-
science on this delicate subject? II is shown,
for instance, that member from North Caro-
lima sold his appointment to the Senator from
the same State, the pay being not cash, but the
Senator's assent to the Congressman's political
existence. The appointment was the price
with which the Congressman bought off the
Senator's opposition. Now, was this any less
bribery than an equivalent in money? On the
other hand, if this is bribery what fact in the
career of every politician is without this taint9


THE CUBAN RESOLUTIONS before the Senate
committee seem to be certain Of favorable
report. Even Sumner has unbent from his

rassment of riches. The committee have two
resolutions and are doubtful which to report.
It would be too bad if too many cooks have

Because iron steamships can now be built
cheaper abroad, it does not follow that 1.-THE
""proiits of navigation would be far greater in
"" foreign built than in home-buit vessels""
encouragement of our shipping interest Is
so interviewer with our manufacturing and
mining industries, that it creates home markets.
increases the ability to consume foreign pro-
ducts, and so increases commercial profits.
Protection always gives ultimately cheaper
and better article. and it would be difficult to
show why ip-bulding should form an excep-
ton, or why we could not excel in iron steam
ships as we did in wooden sailing-vesselS before
the war. American labor commands higher wages
than European labor. We should, therefore,
build ships the same as before the war, and we
should in the end succeed in this, as III every
other case of competition with England. In
reyiving this national interest, it is not just
that private capital should alone accomplish it,
unaided by Congress.


Englands advantage in this is not the fault
of American artisans, but results from the war !;
and Congress should at once repair the loss sus-
tanned, either by removing the revenue taxes on
ship materials, by direct subsidies, or by. grants
of land The first might disturb the financial
policy of the Government, and the second
might too much drain the Treasury. The third
seems best adapted to the exigency of the case,
especially if so guarded as to insure the imme-
date settlement of the lands The wisdom of
this land policy is fully exemplifed in our
transcOntinental railways. 1t is building up En-
pire States in the interior of the Republic, and
developing fabulous mineral wealth Through
these railways, the resources of the Republic
accumulate upon our tide-waters, and call for
ocean railways of iron steamship lines to trans
port them to Europe and Asia. 1t has been
said: ""The profits of ship building are paid
""Out of the subsequent profits of navigation /;
""and, as the receipts for freights are the ulti-
""mate fund out of which all the profits of the
""whole shipping interest are paid it is more
important for the country to secure these
:"" than the partial and lesser profits of building
""the ships by which the freights are earned""
Exactly so. The profits of the merchant are
more than those of the ship builder upon the
individual ship, for the latter only gets the
excess in the price of the ship over the cost of
building it, while the former makes his profits
from year to year. but why not save both
classes of profits, the former directly and the
latter indirectly, through the stimulants of our
industries as before named


The Committee on the Decline of American
Commerce argue that to purchase and register
foreign built iron steamships would deprive us
of our mechanical skill, or compel us to main
tain it at great expense in Government works,
and oblige us to keep up a large and expensive
naval establishment to maintain the national
honor, in case it were assaicd. This argument
has been pronounced ""utterly futile"" because
Foreigners cannot engage in our cOasting
""trade.' in which the tunnage exceeds that of
our foreign trade, and for which the ships are
""entirelY built by our own mechanics"" and
therefore, ""the art of ship building cannot die
""out among u.s.""


But 10000 tuns of steam vessels now engaged
in our coasting are made up of foregn-b built
blockade runners, sold without authority of law
by the late Secretary of the Navy and without
authority of law are now running under the
American flag, doing a large part of our large
cOastlng trade. This, we think, deserves the
attention of Congress. AS our coasting trade
increases, it will require larger ships; and we
cannot see why the same policy that justifies
building abroad an iron steamship of 5000 tuns
for our foreign trade should not require the
same class of ships to be foreign built for the
cOasting trade between our great Atlantic cities,
and between them and our cities on the Pacific,
through ship canal, soon to be opened from
one ocean to the other. If it be wise that our
citizens purchase and register iron steamships
for our foreign trade, why not permit them to
do the same for the more important service of
our coasting and inland trade' We approve
the views of Mr.. Lynch and his Committee, and
of the President, in his late Message, upon this
great national subject, and advocate building
our own ships for both our foreign and our
domestic trade.

Oar Dem oralixed President.",,"


mere smoking machine whose acts are all me-
c1anical, and whose existence is that of an
altomaton which is artfully contrived to DO
certain things without thought will or emo
ton, should read with particular care the
part of his annual message that treats Of the
acquisition of San Domingo. The most dis
tingnished orators and lhetonciars would
lind il hard to sum up the advantages to be
gained by the annexation of that island with
more visor, conciseness or even eloquence
The fire that is hidden under the calmness of
Grants manner bursts out heie with such
energy that it forever sets at rest the question
rs TO whether he is made of ordinary flesh
and blood. He does not propose to throw
himself second time upon the mercy of the
Senate, where he was SO unsuccessful at the
last session, but craftily avails himself of the
traditional rivalry and jealousy of the Repre-
sentatives by proposing that annexation be
effected by means of joint resolution of both
HouseS


But the San Domingo matter does not fur
hish a fair test of the moral attitude of the
administration. We have for several months
past been assured by such 'radical"" authori-
lies as the New York Post, Chicago Tribune,
ST. Louis Democrat, Springfield Republican,
Portland Adrertiser, and by all those who de-
light to call themselves ""Revenue Reform
ers,' that the President has been captured by
,lnregenerate and willy counselling politicians
since the adjournment of Congress, and that
he has sold himself to them by as irrevocable
contract as that by which DR.. Faust sold
himself to the Devil. 1t is with no common
curiosity, therefore, that we look at the mes
eage for the purpose of discovering therein
evidences of that spiritual ruin which has un-
happily overtaken our chief magistrate, and
which has already placed the depraved Della
no in the place of the immaculate Cox, and
the debauched Ackerman twhere shone a few
months ago the peerless Hoar


In the discussion of our relations with for
eign nations this Generalization does not dis
close itself-keeping itself in reserve, proba-
by for home topics. The cold shoulder is
turned to Gen. Butler in the matter of the
Alabama claims. In the brief allusion 10
them. the impression is given that the govern
ment will allow Great Britain to reopen ne
gotiations, that country assuming meanwhile
the rather dangerous responsibility of the
continued pendency of our claims. The con-
viction is forced upon us that in this matter.
as well as in the conduct of our relations
with France and Spain, the President and
tie State Department have acted wisely, and
that the great food of wickedness and in
competency has not yet permeated every nook
and corLer of the administration. The out
RACES committed upon our fishing vessels in
Canadian waters are resented with proper
spirit, but still with statesmanlke temper
ance. Our right to the navigation of the St.
Lawrence is also insisted on with great energy,
as it certainly ought to be, under the circum.
stances.


But in our search for demoralization there
are certain places where we are sure to find
it, if it exists. Wicked Copgressmen are
quite uniformly opposed, either openly or cov-
ertly, TO the repeal of the ranking privilege
though the Postmaster-General says that it
would make his department self-supporting.-
But the President happens to be sound on
this particular question, and We must look
elsewhere for evidences of bis depravity.


Wicked congressman, and, we greatly fear,
large number of good ones, are opposed to
the competitive examination of candidates
for positions in the civil service. But the
President sagacionsly plants himself squarely
on civil service reform platform. But let
no one be misled by the tricks OF virtuous-
seeming politician. He will yet show his clov-
en- foot, despite the carnal wisdom he exhib-
its in hiding it.


There is the financial queston-a question
which in an infinite number of cases, though
not in all, serves as a touchstone for the trial
OF spirits, and discloses rottenness otherwise
unsuspected, causing men to talk of payment
of interest or even the national debt in green
backs, of a permanent paper currency, of tax
ing government bonds or Withholding their
interest, and finally of reputation itself
how does the President stand on this ques-
ton? He says very little about it, but what
he does say is unquestionaby right. He de-
slres speedy return to specie payments,
and he has shown by his acts that he
believes in paying the debt. There is nothing
upon which to found charge of malfeasance
here.


But the revenue REFORM is the crucial test
after all. What of that? Here Gen. Grant
deals very frankly, and if we detect the least
possible trace of sneer at the professional
revenue reformers, it may perhaps be forgiven
in consideration of the sound doctrine enun-
ciated. So far as revenue reform means
reduction of internal taxation till it finally
reaches the vanishing point, revenue tariff
with incidental protection and a reduced ex-
means direct taxation Or any kind of repudia-
ton, he is opposed to it. So far as it is moon
shine he laughs at it. ""Not guilty."" then,
must be the verdict so far.


But he shall not yet escape our tolls. Gen.
Grant might well profess virtuous principles
the better to conceal the notorious venaly
of his private character. His personal gains
would be larger by reason of the friendship
OF some powerful lobby assembled to force
through an appropriation for aprivate scheme
or for some great enterprise of aswinding cor
poration than by any general public immoral
ity. So far as his message is concerned it
would only be necessary for him to pass over
the subject of railroad subsidies in silence
But strangely enough We are at fanlt here
again. The message explicitly discourages
grants of either land or money to States or
corporations. The public lands he would re-
serve for the occupation of settlers under the
homestead act and for the announcement of
education.


AS for the Indian peace policy that is the
pride and boast of the administration. and
there is nothing but praise to bestow upon
that A large sized nest of swindlers was
broken up when the old system of appointing
Indian agents was abandoned.
Our astonishment at the failure of our re-
searches SO far is redoubled ON reading what
the President has to say on the subject of
American commerce. We had supposed that
he had gone hopelessly wrong on this subject,
and that Capt. John Goldman and others of |
the same stamp had got his ear. 1t was
gwen out beforehand that he would in his |
message recommend once more the registra-
tlon OF foreign vessels. But, on the contrary.
ne speaks only in favor Of encouraging the
building oil vessels here, and we infer from
the general tone of his remarks that he is in
with the select committee of which
Mr.. Lynch is chairman, and will coonera4o
with it.

SAN FnANcrsco, September /, 1870.",DEATH OF ANNIE MOONEY.,"Inc ueaJn OF MISS ANNE mooney, an OukluHu
school girl, has caused more excitement in the
community during the past few days than the
meetings of political conventions, the move
ments of great armies or any of the small Incl
dents that make up the sum of the weeks events.
Miss Mooney is described as handsome brunette
only thirteen years and five months old, but pre-
cocious in person and intellect, free and vvacious
in manner and general favorite with all who
knew her. She attended school as usual on
Tuesday, and was afterwards seen to step aboard
the train bound for the ferry landing. From
that time until Thursday morning, when she
appeared at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and asked
for II room, her movements were mystery
After being shown to room she asked for Mr..
George Wood, n conductor on the Central Rail.
rond, with whom she had IL slight acquaintance.
! Mr.. Wood called upon her and according to his
own account-which there is no reason to disbe-
lieve-asked her so many questions about her
absence from home, that she became offended and
gave him short answers after which he LETT
An hour or two afterwards police officer went
to the room for the purpose of returning her
home and found her on the bed in state of
seminsensibilty. Friends and physicians were
summoned and everything that love and skill
could suggest done for her, but without
avail and at half past one next morning the poor
girl expired, having spoken no word from her
discovery to her death.


| The public mind has been so excited lately by
the numerous outrages young girls, that it
was Immediately supposed Miss Mooney had been
the victim Of foul play and the people of Oak
land were worked up into vigilance committee
pitch of Indignation An instant demand was
made for the arrest Of Mr.. Woods, and the Brook
lyn Indepdndent did its utmost to inllame the mob
to lynch that gentleman. A published statement
by the physicians that the girl had not been vo-
lated somewhat cnlmed the community, and the
efforts of the detectives in tracing her wander
ngs from Tuesday to Thursday, soon allayed the
general feeling.


1t is proved that after leaving home on Tuesday
Miss Mooney went to Martinez, stopped there
Tuesday night, and came to San Francisco next
morning, procured situation nurse girl in n
respectable family remained with them until
Thursday, and then weat, as narrated above, to
the Cosmopolitan. She was evidently suffering
from slight alteration of mind, and her death it
| is now believed was caused by fit, as no trace
of poison has yet been discovered in the stomach
AT the funeral, on Monday, Roman Catholic
priest made disgraceful attempt to nfame the
people against Mr. Woods, and nothing but the
GOODNESS of the authorities prevented the murder
of that gentlman by Lynch law. The case has
been very peculiar one and there was good
grounds for supposng foul play, but the mystery
has now been cleared up in very satisfactory
manner.


FEMALE GyMNAsTs.


A class Of sixteen young Indies commenced
the practice of calisthenics on Monday afternoon
at the gymnasium of the Young Mems Christian
Institute. They have regular instructor who
puts them through their initatory exercises as
ruthessly as Corporal drilling an awkward
squad. No unhallowed male eye was allowed to
rest upon the scene though the Young Christians
otered longingly around the spot and would
have given their best hymn books for a key-hole
peep.


PROFESSIONAL BEGGARs.


Begging in San Francisco is fast becoming n
profession. Hitherto the applicant for charity
has been content to assume the himsy disguise
of an organ grinder, or vender of unsmokable
cigars, or has appealed for aims through the me-
dium of vile fiddle, but latterly there has been
an influx of open and avowed mendicants.-
About year ago one Of the local Benevolent
Societies had fat, lusty looking blind man ar
rested for vagrancy, and proved to the Court that
he was worth $50 900, all of which he had made
from begging He is still in the city, and on a
fine day may be seen feeling his way about the
streets with a stick, stopping occasionally at the
sunny corners, and keeping his professional hand
in by holding out his bodily one for charity.


TIE ""DEAD BROKE"" MINER.


In the suburbs the "" dead broke"" miner is a
fayorte character. lie commences operations
after dark by approaching the homcward bound
citizen with n confidential appeal. @ Can have
few words with you Misler?' is the established
formula and having gained his victims attention
he prefers friendly request for the loan of two
bits, just to get a nights lodging. 1t must be q
profitable business for when once adopted the
applicant rarely seeks any other occupation
The man who has but two ten cent pieces and asks
you to exchange them for quarter so that he
can have a square meal is also numerous nd
vidua. In nine cases out of ten the person ap
pealed to hands over the twenty-five cents and
as often refuses to take the protfered last dimes
Excellent wages can be made by any respectable
looking persons who adopt this lay.


The woman with twins, one in each arm, has
not yet paid a visit, though masculine
looking German woman has stalked about with
a baby that never gets any bigger, and persist

for some years.

REVIVAL OF AMERICAN COMMERCE..


The House resumed the consideration Of the till to
revive the navigation and commercial interests Of
the United States.


Mr.. FARNswOgTH, (rep.) of ILL.,, stated his obJec-
tons TO the bill. 1t was proposition really to hire
men to build ships and then to hire men TO run the
ships after they were built, and all for the benefit OF
the makers Of iron In Pennsylvania and the hewers
OF wood In Mainc--both bounty and subsidy to be
paid by the taxpayers OF the United States. This
was asking too much. This crowding the over
burdened taxpayers too hard. He was willing TO vote
for bill to remit actual du ties materials used In
shpbuilding but he not willing that the people
should be taxed at both ends Of the route. The
dimlnution OF the c0astwise trade was attributable
70 other causes those mentioned by the f1e1d
boanties Tney might put vessels along the coast II
they paid them enough. They might put out little
schooners TO carry the United states nag they paid
money to do 30; but that would not revive the car
rying trade. They might pay enough to allow Il ans.
portation to be done coaswise cheaper than 1t could
by road; that would be doing great wrong to
the railroad interest. The bill proposed to give q
special bounty to one branch Of the carrying trade
at he expense OF another. The coastwise trade by
vessels could not compete with that by rail. Insur-
ance was much greater; time was Lecomng very

passengers by water was concerned, that trade

authorize the Postmaster General to contract for

country and European ports. Subsidies were
already paid for lines to CHINA, The Sandwich
Islands ana Brazil, and he was Wiling that the
Postmaster General should contract to give the en-


tire postage 70 any line G shas s would carry Inc mail to
his constituents 10 pay bounty to men to try ana

posed to tn, bil and opposed 10 the wnoie idea OF
giving bounlies to shppuilders or ANYBODY else for
paiticu ar interest. He argued against that and
other features OF the bill.


Mr.. LYNCH, (rep.) OF Me-, remarked that the CON-
mttee had agreed 10 substitute for the bill, ana
he oilered 1t 70 be voJed on as an am ndment.


Mr. INGERsoLL, trep) OF H., argued tnat tails COM
tna duty was inquire INTO the the decay
Of American commerce lnd navigation; but the
biIl was concsrned, nc to the sipbullding Interest.
Everybody knew that iron ships would not be Daiit
IN Mane, and that wooden SHIPS could not compete
with iron ships In The foreign trade. II the bill
were to become law it would not cndanger the
interest OF the foreigners In the carrying trade.
American tonnage, 80 far as the lOtei0n rade Was
concerned would continue dccllae until 1t became
actually extuct. 1t would have been IusI rs SEN
ebe when tue railroad business superseded the old
stagecoacl business TO have reported bill TO revive

not giving the relief the very place where relief
was needed, namely, In regard TO foreign tonnage.
1t gave relief Where none needed, IN the coast-
wise Trade, and failed TO give rciier where IL
needed. IL did not give advantages enough 10 enable
cyde All the subsdies Dountes and and as drawbacKs %
provided in the bill would nor enable American snip
owners 10 compete with the cheap IRON Vessels built
on the Clyde. There ore for the purpose Of the
foreign trade tais bill was failure, and for the pur
pose OF me coasting trade iC was unnecessary. On
AS to the subsidy feature OF the b it was odous to
the American mind. Under these circumstances he
thought lhaS the bill! and anendmen 8 ought to be
laid on tue table or be recommiited.


The morning hour expired ANA the bill went over
until tomorrow.


In the substitute offered by Mr.. Lynch the pre-.
amDlc Is the same as IN the original bill. vhe nrst
section is modified as follows:-


That upon all imported lumber timber, hemp, Ma

The second section, allowing ship stores aud coal

in the original bin. The remaining sections OF the
bill are struck out.

Let those amendments be briefly explained.


MIR. SARGENT, (rep.) OF CAL remarked that that

The debate went on without limitation. and

A week Of steady industry on the part OF
both houses Of Congress has just closed.
During yesterday, in the Senate, Mr.. Chandler
made speech on his own plan for restoring
American commerce. He made some excel
lent suggestions, considering that he lives as far
in the backwoods as Michigan, and is usually
given to tho Incorporate use of buncombe IN
his speeches. He favored drawbacks and
took the broad ground that the Clyde builders
knew more about the business Of building iron
ships than we did, and that iron steamships
were already doing the carrying business OF
the world.


In the House q discussion ensued on
general bill for giving pensions to the sur
viving soldiers and sailors of 1912, tho debata-
BILE point being motion made by Mr. Winans,
and favored by Messrs. Bingham and Butler,
to strike out clause excepting those who
gave aid and comfort to the rebellion. The
bill was finally passed without striking out the
clause. The bill to reduce internal taxation
was then considered in Committee Of the
Whole. The sale Of gold coin through clear
ing house was taxed one-twentieth of one per
cent additional, and the tax on gambling opera
tions in Wall street was doubled.


Altogether the week has been one of the
most important in many sessions of Congress-
Both houses seem to have devoted themselves
untiringly to the transaction of business, and
the business transacted has been rather above
the average character Of latter day Congress
sional transactions. The Fifteenth Amend
ment bill has been passed in both houses and
ranks first in importance, not only on its in
trinsc merits,, but by virtue of having already
reached the midway dignity Of awaiting the
signature of the President. The Legislative
Appropriation bill, one of the most important
routine fIieas;,.l a5, was passed IN the Senate,
with several sensible amendments, one Of
which increases the salary of the Justices of
the Supreme Court. The bill for a uniform
system Of naturalization has been reported in the
Senate and will probably soon come up for con-
sderation, and Mr.. Chandlers shipping interest
bill is already before that body. In the House
the Diplomatic Appropriation bill, another





passed; the Internal Tax bill is fairly under
way; Mr.. Lynchs Shipping bill has been
steadily discussed, and the Cuban question,
called up incidentally, has received a salutary
endorsement by both political parties in the
House, and is in fair way of solution as soon
as it is brought more formally before it.


Against this record Of industry and zeal we
have nothing more serious to place on the
Senate account than the average display Of
buncombe, but in the House the zeal and in
dustry is pretty nearly balanced by the
passage of an infamous land grabbing bill
and at least two displays of Incorporate dis
cussion. The weeks record, however, shows
that both houses are anxious to make up for
lost time, and we are inclined to deal leniently
with the minor faults."

Some time since Commissioner Delano received from
John W. Garrett President of the Baltimore and Ohio

proposition rejected. Several days ago another
offer Of compromise made by the Company named.
TO pay $4,000 the Government the five per cent
tax the surplus earnings OF the Company, which
amount they had used up in adding to their stock,
depots, etc. and which had been charged to consruc-


ton account This proposition was accepted yesterday,
and the Company is to pay the money this week. The
Commissioner will accept no compromise in the case
where this Company holds as trustee Ave millions
worth Of bonds issued by themselves and indorsed by
the City of Baltimore. He has ordered
suit to be brought against the Company
for the recovery Of the tax on these bonds
for the years to 1862 The City Corporation OF Bat
more enjoned the Railroad Company from paying the
tax, and the will have to be decided by the Z. s.
Circuit Court in Baltimore. Commissioner Delano has

sisted of really hoeral changes in the French
constitution. The most important being the ad-
mission of the lower house to a controlling share
of the administration. Heretofore all bills reat-
ing to finance or shaping the policy Of the EN-.
pre had to originate in the Senate, consisting
exclusively Of the appontees of the Emperor.
This all-mportant function of government has
now been transferred to the lower house, elected
by the people. This concession is bid by
Louis Napoleon for the support of his son by the
French people. 1t only insures the speedy
downfall of the empire. Not week passes

from the West, would favor any measure looking To
the RELIEF OF the shipping interests, Mr.. Lynch moved

the whole country. He charged upon the opponen

failing 10 destroy the Union, were now here by

Plug Muss Between Congressman and g


Lobbyist-The Lobbyist Comes Or Second


Best.


The Arlington House the scene OF little bit OF
q scuffe tonight, the bellgerents being General
Negey member OF Congress from Pennsylvania,
and Captain John Goldman, a little fellow who has
been pusy as a bee here for months lobbying against
Lynchs bill for the revival of American commerce.
Il appears that Goldman and Ne9iey met at the Ar
lington, when conversation turned upon the Lynch
BILL Goldman using 1t Is stated very surong language
In regard TO the course of some OF the men,
bers Of Congress on the subject. Goldman, II

humored, fne dashing sort Of fellow, took the
hfpo p1oaa apfl for a
man continued ne letorted by charging the little
1obbyist with being paid agent of the Clyde ship
builders. Goldman, like valiant friend Hutch
ms, belongs to the OF Liliput, but he
siders he has the soul OF Brobdingnag. No
body can sneoze at him with mathemati-
cal security. When Negley threw out the
inslnuaton that he lCodmap) was a paid
agent Of the Clyde people. he eyed the member Of
Congress most Inrepidiy and, drawing himself up
three elghths Of en- inch higher than usual, said
deliberately, general Negey il pon only joking
In making that statement say nothing: but, sir, II
you are in earnest, say 1t is id lie."" Where
upon Negley, a good, stout able man, put forward
his dexter and very arstically removed the valiant
Goldman from tie standing TO the horizontal position
In other words, as the pugs would say, the first
knock down was for Negley. Goldman promptly ie-
gained the perpendicular aud struck Eegey with
cane across the breast. Negley thrust
the weapon aside and agnin and rather more forci-
bly, caused his opponent TO measure his length on
the tesselated pavement OF The fashionable Airing
ton corridor. Then Goldman got up again. Then,
- my informant states NeGley laughed. Then Cod
man apologized. Negey and Goldman shook hands.
Then there peace once more. Then Negley,
Goldman and John Roach, OF your city, all joined in
pleasant conversation. And then all three went
and took liquid refreshments. No blood split. No
bones broken. ""Let US have peace""


Captain John Goldman called upon your CORES
pondent since the fracas at the Arlington and has
given the following version Of the dlGiculiy:-


General Negley and met at the Arlington after
dinner ana in conversation on the subject OF Mr..
Iynchs blI the General remarked that the difficulty

which replied that II the remark was In Joke was
accustomed 10 IT, but II he intended it in earnest IT
was lie. whereupon General Neglcy STRUCK me
with his list ana struck back with q cane. Imme-
diste.y we were separated by some gentlemen.
General Negley said he mad spoken hastily and
Damn at ell, nor did apologize to hin. 1t was lac
who apologized TO me.


A Magnificent Land Job Consummnted.


The protracted fight In the House over the North
ern Pacific Railroad bill was brought to a termina-
tion to-day by the passage Of the bill. No bill OF the
session has been fought more vigorously defended
with greater pertinecity. Its friends, however,
seem to have had every thing fixed from the first and
sney therefore awaited patiently untf the minority
should exhaust ITSELF when they knew they would
carry the bill without fail. There seems to he little
doubt In the minds OF many members that the bill, to
0se the language OF one OF the minority, was literally
bought through the House. The land grant guaran-

WASHINGTON, Nav 25.-Mr. Ferry said that
he had received several memorials from citi-
zens Of the Dominican Republic, protesting
against annexation. Objection being made on
the ground that the memorialists were not
American citizens, the Vice President said
the papers could only be received by unani-
nous consent.


Mr.. Pomeroy objected, and the papers were
not received.


A joint resolution was passed for the admis-
sion of foreign photographs free of duty for
exhibition at the National PHOTOGRAPHIC Ex-
hibition in Cleveland, Ohio, June next.


Mr.. Harlan addressed the Senate at length
in explanation and support of the bill for the
sale of the Usage Indian reservation in the
State of Kansas and the settlement of said In
dams in Indian territory.


The report of the conference committee on
the 18th amendment bill was debated until the
hour of adjournment, the Senate agreeing to
take vote on it Wednesday at 3 O clock


HOUSE.


Mr.. Brooks, of New York, presented a petit
ton of the members of the Tobacco Associa-
ton for a uniform tax of 16 cents per pound
and protesting against any advance on smok-
ing tobacco; also to incorporate an Interna-
tional Society for the promotion of immigra-
tion.


A bill was passed removing the charge of de-
sertion from soldiers who had served out their
time of enlistment and been honorably dis
charged.


Mr.. Hale introduced Il bill for the reduction
of the internal taxes; providing that after July
1st no internal taxes shall be collected except
on liquors, tobacco, cigars, stamp tax, and in
come tax; the income tax to be per cent. on
all net gains and profits over $4,000 annually
Referred to the Committee on Ways and
Means


The bill to revive tho American navigation
and commercial interests was then taken up.
Mr.. Peters of Maine supported the passage OF
| the whole bill. Any particular amendment
| might spoil the equipoise and he saw no other
| way than for them to take the judgment o
purchase of ships; that would be a temporary
| not a permanent relief. He did not oppose
| Mr.. Buffers prescription to impose differential
duties. 1t was an absolute remedy. He OPP
posed excluding coasting vessels from the ben
efits of the bill. The navigation interests need
| ed aid and encouragement now. He believed
| that no form could more safely be given or re.
| ceived than in the shape of the pending bill
with all its provisions.


Mr.. Coburn of Indiana opposed the bill and
Mr.. Buffers amendment as encouraging ship.
| building and not commerce or navigation.
He advocated the purchase of ships where they
could be bought cheapest. The measures now
proposed were narrow, unjust, ,impolitc and in
| effectual OF good, and would result in disaster
| to the country.


The discussion was continued by Messrs
Brooks, Cox, Schumacher and Calkin of New
| York, Marshall of Illinois, Banks OF Massachu-
setts and Ferry of Michigan; then Mr.. Lynch
who had charge of the bill, moved the preyiou:
| question, first allowing amendments to be Of
| fered.


An amendment was proposed by Mr.. Butler
of Massachusetts, imposing differential duties
offered for him in his absence by Mr.. Garfield
of Ohio. Mr.. Bingham Of Ohio offered ar
amendment to that amendment, imposing
! auty OF lo per cent on goods imported in other
| than American vessels


After a number of amendments had been OF
Tered and admitted by Mr.. Lynch, the Hons,

Besides the employees Of the knitting mills, a crowd
of men belonging to the Lincoln Taylor and Hiper-

there was no strong police force to interrupt them.
About three O'Clock p. NJ, the members OF two
rival fire companies having commenced quarrel,

THE ARCADE VETO.


TO the Edftor Of The Tribune.


SIR: Will you aHOw me, as one of the in
corporaOrs in the Arcade Railroad bill. to express my
entire in what said In THE TRIBUNE OF
Tuesday the subject Of the ""Arcade Veto"" am quite
willing for one, that the gentlemen who much In
terested in the defense OF Broadway, should, you
suggest put end to the Arcade project by giving
the means OF rapid transit in some other way.


The main argument for the Of Broadway has been
with the fact that the capital for subsurface road
along the ridge of the island was assured in advance
Railroad has shown the difficulty say the mpos
sbility of obtaining the money to build one else where
gentlemen who rejoice in the representation of three
hundred Millions Of capital Let them build the Central
Sntration hat there is no occasion to make use Of
Broadway to secure rapid n cSnmunSaon @ between ,r
which operate for the defense of that street against all
intrusion.


when by favor OF the three hundred millions OF dol
or 20 miles an hour may be willing TO forget the
| unfair misrepresentation aud the abuse OF honorable
with which the arcade Railroad bill has been met; ret
The veto Of Gov. Hoffman does not put an end TO the
Arcade Railroad bill. 1t s believe, the first bill for
railroad along Broadway which ever got as far rs the
Governor Ii will surely be presented another year and
the objections Of the Governor Will be met SO that he too
can concur in the movement to to the people OF
New.York the Of travelling comfortably between
their workshops and their homes As to the Arcade plan
there is an honest difference OF opinion; bnt in spite OF
the Governors argument still fail to what danger
there could have been in allowing those who believe in
II the oppornity their facts and arguments
To the real estate along Broadway whose prop
erty alege they viii improve and not injure. Why
this unwilingness to consider project which de-
yed with especial reference to preserving Broadway
from injury, while making use OF IT to promote great
| public convenience {.

Question.


The further consideration of the Legislative
Appropriation bill was the main business of
the Senate yesterday. An hours debate was
held on motion to insert four hundred and
Fifty thousand dollars for the completion Of the
Louisville Canal, amended by another motion
to insert the whole Harbor and River Appro-
priation bill. When 1t is remembered that the
bill under consideration is to make appropria-
tions for paying the expenses Of Congress,
the President, the judiciary and the various
departmental branches of the government,
it will be seen how out of place
an appropriation for canal would be
in it. and it will also be seen how sense-
lessly the Senate fritters away valuable time
The motion was finally withdrawn. The report
OF the Conference Committee ON the disagree
ing amendments of the two houses to the Fif-
teenth Amendment bill was then discussed
until adjournment, and thus more time was
frittered away BY the Senate. In fact, the only
effective part OF tho whole days proceedings
yesterday was hailstorm, which pattered





compelled Mr.. Drake to cease speaking for at
least five minutes.


The day was rather important one in the
House. Mr.. Lynchs bill to revive the ship
ping interest was again thoroughly debated
and q call for the main question was defeated
by vote of IS to GA severe blow to the
bill. The morning hour having expired, how
ever, it went over until to-day, when the final
vote will be taken, and unless the opinions Of
some of the members undergo a change in the
meantime it will be formally defeated. The
friends of the bill are still hopeful, however.
The defeat Of the bill, if it be defeated is due,
we hope, only to the objections members may
have to Mr.. Lynch's particular way of reviving
American shipping, and not to any Indifference
on 50 important subject. Some measure
of the kind should be passed, whether
favoring subsidies, drawbacks or extension of
the registry privileges The Diplomatic
Appropriation bill was taken up, and called
forth one of the most energetic debates that
has occurred in Congress for many days. A
motion was made to omit Santiago de Cuba
ITOm tHe llet VI COuSuldtcSs dHu VOoTuccS,
OF Indiana, made such strong speech in favor
of more vigorous policy against Spain and
for the protection Of American citizens in Cuba
that he reused the House into enthusiasm on
the subject, and both sides almost clamored
for governmental aid to the struggling insur-
gents. General Banks announced that his
Committee on Foreign Affairs would be willing
and glad to present bill at once granting
belligerent rights to the Cubans, but the cooler
and more methodical rules of the House in
tervened and the enthusiasm expended ITSELF
The proposition to omit consulate at Santiago
was then rejected, and the Appropriation bill
ON being reported to the House, was passed."

| held Yesterday afternoon, the President, W. B.
| Dana, Esq, in the chair. The minutes of the

| The President then read the following COM
munication:


New YORK, June 49, 1870.
| Hon. "". S. Dana, President Portland Board
| of Trade: Sir,-The endorsement given to the
| application of the Cape Cod Ship Canal Co by
| the legislature of Massachusetts to Congress
| for the construction of breakwater by the
government at the eastern end Of the proposed
| Canal-leads us to hope that the represe nta-
| ton OF the trade of Portland would lend us
their aid IN the shape of memorial to Con-
gress.


We would be pleased to have you apply to
our ONCE or to any parties in interest, for in-
formation and facts bearpg upon the project
| Joint resolution has been un lnimousiy acted
upon in the House Commerce Committee in
Congress and is now in the Senate Committee.
Oar company are now only awaiting the ac-


non OF Congress to begin vigorous work upon
the canal.


have the honor to be with great respect
your obd't servant,


A. B. STElNBERGER,
Managing Director, c. G. S. G. Co.
Mr.. Dana then said it had been hoped that


the Board would have had the pleasure of list


ening to remarks from Hon. T. Russell, Col.
| 'ector of the port of Boston, and from General
Foster, but the former had been detained at
home by an engagement and Gen. Foster was


in Washington. Maj, H. L. Whiting, Assist
ant Superintendent of the Coast Survey, was
| however, present, who was fully acquainted
with the whole work, and he would therefore
introduce him.


Mr. Fl. L. Whiting then described the posi-
tion of the canal on the charts which would be
some eight miles in length by 800 #. in breadth
and % #. deep at mean low tide. This Cape
Cod Canal Co. were prepared to put $7,OOOOOO
iuto the enterprise and all they wanted Of Con-
gress was breakwater to cost So, ,O0O, 900 at the


mouth of the canal. If Congress builds this


breakwater then the company think the canal


will become fair subject for government pro-


lection. This canal will save distance and


avoid dangers. From Buzzard's Bay to Minot


Lights it will save 200 miles to vessels and


steamers and enable them to run inside the


shoals along the shore from the Sound right


up to the canal. He told a good story of feet


of 260 vessels detained in Holmes Hole by stress
of weather, how venturesome schooner put


out and came into Boston, discharged cargo


and got fresh one, went to New York, dis
oh arUQd fharo rot nod 70 md ho


way put into Holmes Hole and found that 26O


sail of vessels still there. There was sample
of what dependence Maine coasters had to put


in Holmes Hole and Provincetown harbors


which this canal would obviate. The Cam
bridge Gas Co. have had their coal weather
bound so is was feared they could not make any
gas.


Mr.. Farmer considered this very important
matter and that it would be of much more i'm
portance to Maine if the company would also
agree to reopen the old canal in use in 1872,
between Gloucester harbor and Annisquam
harbor.


Mr.. Henry Fox considered the proposed
canal would be great benefit to the steamers
and coasters, especially when heavy fogs we're
prevalent when his steamers had some times
had to lay at anchor for long time, it being
too rough to attempt to cross the shoals.


The following resolutions was then passed.


Resolred That the constr uctiou of Ship Canal
across Cape Cod Is work OF national interest d
Importance, and that this Board confidently looka to
Congress Tor the adoption of such measures and the
grant of such aid towards the construction of the
neces breakwater as may secure its completion
at an early day.


The following resolution offered by Mr.. j. L.
Farmer was passed:


Voted That Congress be also requested to exam
me into the expediency convenience and necessity
of also constructing ship canal across the Penn-
suar OF Cape Ann, by widening and deepening the
natur canal now in existence between Gloucester
Har6or and Annisquam Harbor, this being of G eat
value in connection with the Cape Cod Canal to an
immense coasting trade.


President Dana then read an invitation to
the Portland Board of Trade from the Bur-
lington Board of Trade to attend the meeting
in the latter city on the 23d of June at P. NJ,
for the purpose of discussing the importance of
opening steamship connection between the |
Great Lakes and Lake Cbamplain-by the |
construction of the Caughnawaga Ship Canal. |


Hon. l. Washburn, Jr., spoke very strongly |
in favor Of thi, ezru4, ~-..e-4,>-.,,,>t ;4-->.lA
be of great Importance to Portland as it would
he uniting the great Lakes with Lake Cham
plain by very easy route. The lockage the
whole way would be not more than % feet ele-
vatiOn, and when concluded the ships of 800
tons can pass through and the transit to Port
land would be shortened from sixteen to six |
days.


Mr.. Washburn ffered the following resolu- |
ton:


Reso,ved. That the Board feel deep interest in |
the OF the enterprise recently authorized bv
the Legisla ture of Canada, which contemplates the
cons ruction of Ship Canal from the Riye ST. Law
renee to Lake Champlan, the completion of which |
in conn ction with tue proposed Improvements on |
steamers of $50 tons burden the great lakes
OF the West and Lake Chdmpain, ann will give |
new freight line from Duluth, Milwaukee, Chicago
carriage.


Rssotced, That the following gentlemen be dele
lngton, Vt on Thursday next, tor the promotion of
this important enterprise, Messrs. l. Washburn, Jr
sradturg s. Dana ana gsp'e os00d


Mr. J. L. Farmer trusted the resolution |
would not pa.s aud spoke of the injury it
would be to the G. 7. road. Mr.. Washburn
said that that wouldn't necessarily be since
the canal was not open only during the open
months of the year and during the winter
mouths railroads would have to carry the
freight. The resolution passed unanimously,
and it was voted that His Honor Mayor Kings
bury be invited to join the delegates.


Mr.. M N. Rich then offered the following
resolutions in regard to the death of the late
Luther Dana, Esq


Whereas, 1t is with profound sorrow that the |
members OF tn Board Farn of the death of Luther
Dana, on the 18th inst, at the advanced age OF
enty eight years, and


Whereas, Mr.. LANA has for more than a half |
century teen identihed with the business interest,
OF this city and for many years mt mber OF this
Board; therefore


Resotoed, That in the decease Of Luther Dana
Portland sustans the loss OF OF its ab'est and
most respected merchants characterized through.
ont his long and useful life an honest, upright
Christian man, enjoying the constant respect and
confidence of all wi h whom he had business rea-
tions, and whose memory we cherish and honor.


Resotued That tender to the relatives and near

Last week Senator salisbury made fam


ing speech in the i. s. Senate in favor of the
Democratic party. tIe was fully convinced in
his own mind that We will come to destruction
II 1t Is kept from the control Of power and the
spoils of Office much longer. That party. he
said, held the reins Of government for sixty
years, during which time everything was love
ly. There was no trouble then and not a sim
gle rebellion during all that time. All was
happiness and felicity and mot wave of
troucle rolled across our peaceful breasts ~


We lived in a kind of earthly paradise.
which was next thing to the millennium. and it
was all owing 10 the Democratic party ""No
mans house was invaded"" said Mr.. s. tex
cept under legal authority, during the whole
sixty years that the Democratic Party admins
tered the Government not one public press
was suppressed. The New York T;iL,u,o
says it mortally hates to disturb such serene
reflections, but still it wants to know whether
Mr.. salisbury ever heard Of one Loyeiov. and
how his press was tumbled into the river and
Its owner killed? Whether ne ever heard of
he rifing ofthe United States mail bags. with
the implied sanction, at least, of the Post OHice
department? Whether he ever heard of the
imprisonment of colored seamen from the
North in Southern ports, for no oiTense except
that of the color? Whether he ever heard of
men being lynched and all that for their opin-
ions. 1t thinks it bad to break up such happy
reflections but when a man $ memory is bal il
ought TO be logged


We suppose it was after reading this speech
of the Senator that the editorials in the last
De,a'0oFeaa were written. 1t Is fully convinced
that the negroes do the thieying among us and
that the Radicals make them DO it."

OF Information that leaves room for doubt that
such is the intention OF the English government
and says that while 1t Is possible that in cargo OF

sion OF opinion that when proper representations

ported progress on behalf ortne Committee Pilot
age, stating In the course OF his observations
that in compliance with the request of the
association the counsel TO is had prepared
q bill Tor the state Legislature against COM
pulsory pilotage, which, 1t met with con-
siderable opposition at Albany, was remodelled for
presentation to the senate, where it is now under
consideration. The pilots who are now IN strong
force at Albany fea:ng the passage Of blll to de-
feat their ends, sent the following document to the
gentlemen representing tac shipowners interests

intentions and views OF the members.
Mr.. BRETT, on behalf OF the committee appointed
to confer with the new Quarantine. Commissioners
stated that negotiations are pending towards an
entente cordidte between them, and that he was OF

luti0n:-


Whereas the shipowners New York are opposed to the
law of the state OF New York enforcing compulsory poage
upon vessels arriving departing from the port OF New

sent from Washington BY certain newspaper
correspondents at the time Mr.. Lynch's bill
was defeated, to show that it was lost by his
mismanagement of it in the House.


These Washington dispatches were from the
introduction Of the bill to its defeat, with one
or two exceptions, of the most unirendly char
acter. The special and Associated Press dis
patches in regard to the Presidents message
urging the favorable ac ction of Congress upon
the measure, were equally unfriendly. This
was all very natural. The foreign lines Of
steamers, with the agencies in New York, rep
resenting millions of capital, could employ
agents in Washington and to spend thousands
of dollars to create public sentiment unfavora-
be to the bill. And it is not to be supposed
that so important an agency as newspaper cor
respondents and the telegraph were overlook
ed.


The report in the Globe does not sustain the
dispatches referred to, but show that, with the
exception of a few short passages, such as are
of daily occurrence in debate during every ses-
sion of the House, the discussion was conduct
ed with courtesy; and the fact that the bill was
recommitted to the committee with instruc
tions TO report at the next session, disproves
the assertion that it was defeated on account OF
the mismanagement or i'll temper of Mr.. Lynch."

The platform of the Democratic Distric

opposed to the commercial interests of the
country, and the argus man knows it as well
as ne knows his road home, and yet for party
purposes, on the day before election he attri-
butes it to bad management.


Mr.. Lynch's labor on that bill, and for the


interests it protected and advanced, were of


the most valuable kind, and his report is


most important text book and will be so used


for years to come. The first District, so large

Mr.. Lynch from the time that his report was
submitted to Congress up to about the time of
Mr.. LIS re nomination. 1t supported bis bill,
copied into its columns favorable notices of its
progress in the House, and more than once
half-defended him from the assaults of his
enemies. On the 22d of February the Arous
said, editorially:

The 81. Thomas Treaty-In Feeling Of the
Danish People.


Letters received from Denmark show that the
government and statesmen Of that country continue
70 be much mortified at the neglect Of the Senate
OF the United States on the subject OF the St. Thomas
treaty, that body having two years ago been informed
Of W ratiaeaion by Denmark. and the period for
The exchange Or Publications. having been several
times extended at the request Of this government.
The last time expired on the 14th Of April. The
Senate allowed 1t TO elapse without one word for or
against the treaty. The correspondence says the
people feel now, as heretofore, that 1t Is clear
breach Of international good breeding. and that they
have not been treated with the consideration that one
friendly Power should show TO another 1t was sup
posed that the Senate at the present session. would
take some notice OF the matter; but in this there has
been disappointment 1t seems to be settled that
Denmark will make no further movement on that
subject especially In view OF the fact that the pro-
position to purchase was originally made by the Ex
ecutve Department OF this government Denmark
being reluctant a first to enter into the negotiation


II appears from these letters that the treatment by
the senate Is more complained OF than would have
been the failure to ray the treaty and that If the
treaty had Been promptly acted on, though rejected
this would have left less unfrlendy feeling thanis
manifested among the Danish people.


The Shipbmiiding Interests I'm France.
The United States Consul General for France John
M. Reade Jr, has addressed letter to John Lynch
chairman of the Committee the Decline OF Amer-
car Tonnage, relative to the condition Of the French
naval and commercial marine. Mr.. Reade calls
special attention to the protection afforded the ship
building interests by the French government This
Is in the form or rebate drawback similar to
that proposed by the bill reported the House by
Mr. Lynch. Mr.. Reade states that the provisions of
this act seem to be inadequate to the actual require
ments Of the interest it intended to protect It
is notorious fact that shipbuildng in France has
for several years past been gradually declining. The
number and tonnage Of vessels built is growing less
with every year. In view OF these facts the principal
shpbuilders in Havre, Bordeaux and other leading
ports of France have addressed series Of manests
to the government setting forth the inadequacy OF





protection. The sense OF their memorial may be
stated In few words as follows:--The decline OF
shfpbuIlding in France Is becoming alarmngly
apparent frOm day to day. Constructors are dis.
couraged and are rapidly closing their yards, with
drawing their capital from the business and invest
ing in other directions. Since the tax on foreign
tonnage has been rendered uniform with that on
French tonnage, foreign vessels have monopo-
lized an excessive portion OF the carry
ing trade Of France The activity of the
principal yards OF Great Britain Italy and the North
German Confederation, contrasts most unfavorably
for France with the decline Of her shpbuilding in
terests the abandonment Of her yards and the de-
crease In her tonnage. The increased activity
displayed by these Powers in the building OF first
class vessels indicates that they appreciate the de-
cline Of the shipbuidng interests in France and are
preparing to mon0p0lize among themselves her very
important carrying trade In the course OF three OF
four years France will have fallen from the rank OF
first class to that Of fourth or fifth class mari.
time Power. II the present unfortunate state
OF affairs Is to be remedled the radical
difference in the aid extended by the French
government to its marine and that allowed by for
eign Powers to theirs must be taken into consdera-
ton. If the requirements Of the government rem

vessels impossible certainly foreign ships should not

planned, is now before the Chamber Of Deputies and

II possible apply remedy to the evils Of which the

that the French government now pays government

postal service to the amount OF $4,7l6,496.

PORTLAND, Me-, Sept. 12.-lt is impossible to
get returns as in former years, when there was Dom
strict party organization and great personal interest
Up TO II O'Clock less than half Of the state has been heard
from scarcely anything from back towns In the cities
and larger places there has been general cutting OF
names and settling OF old Scores which gone to the
credit OF the Democracy.


In one Ward this city, 16 different tickets were cicu
lated; people voted in all conceivable ways Portland
has elected two Republican and two Democratic Eepre
sentaves-he latter by Republican votes, on the pledge
that they would support Chamberlain. Lewiston has
been lost by open breach OF the Republicans on Ya
ous issues. Bangor has gone Democratic against al
precedent and for several wellunderstood reasons IL
l. the home OF Roberts, who is popular IL Is the nome
OF Hersey, whose supporters in the state Convention
forecast disaster IL he not nominated II has also
been the theater Of great excitement over the rigid exc
cuton OF the Liquor lw, and hundreds Of Republicans
voted square against the whole Republican ticket on
this issue alone The railroad war throughout the state
has been seriously disturbing element In all the com
merclal towns, and has suppanted In many cases all
merely sentimental tendencies 10 has been sort OF
gala day for the unbosoming Of individual greis ana
whmscaltes, and the glor.hcation OF the caprces Of
the ndepen ience Of the individual wien he cuts loose
from logic aui party bonds for season, and not even
the Democracy themselves seriously claim that 1t
a victory for them in any Of their local successes


Mr. Lynch is elected in this the only doubtful district
by about LOO majority which is great victory under
the circumstances, and the pluck he has shown s ad
mirabe. The Democracy conoedo the substantial sue
OF the Republicans throughout the state, claiming
only few gains in Representatives with possibly Sen
ator in Lincoln County. Exactly how next winters
Senator contest is affected cannot be nel gently stated
tonight. The Senate is very largely ior Morrill, but the
complexion ofthe House cannot be known for several
days Many % the NorriE men think that the Demo
cratic vote FOR Chamberlain in instances viii auay
tell against him The lowest estimate OF Perham's ma
jorty is 52Oo and the highest about twice that figure

the success of all the Republican candidates,
though we believe that strenuous efforts are
making by the Democrats, with possibly a
few disafiected Republicans, to defeat Mr..
Lynch in the Ist District, but his friends re-
gard his success as certain. Much interest will,
no doubt, center upon the choice of members
of the Legislature, as that body will have the

little pigs, was tried on a charge OF
having stolen the quadrupeds.


RECORDERS CoURT.-N Willard,
Esq presiding.-The visitors at this
Court were limited in number. but all
but one of them very unusual charac
ters. The first case presented was
that of Doctor"" VIM. Walker, the
colored man who pfofesses to
have taken sundTy and divers
living ''sarpints and varmin;s"" from
the stomach Of a cOlored woman.
DR.. Snaix was fined s. 90 for indeeen-
cy on his own admission. In addi
ton to this penalty, he got a severe
punch on the mug"" from the person
who arrested him. The Doctor""
liquidsted.


J. q. Weaver. a tall respectable
looking elderly man. with a hooked
nose and a bald head, bowed politely
to the Court, and, when asked if be
was guilty of being drunk and disor-
derly, bowed again, and said, yes sir,
if you please, SIR"" Five thirty,
responded the Judge, and Mr.. Weav-
er paid the cash. and retired with
another Chesterfeldian obeisance.


The next interviewer was u. s.
Grant, alias Louis XIV. who also
claimed to be Deity itself. IF he had
claimed to be the idol of some savage
race, the peculiar hideousness of his
appearance might have led one to be-
lieve him. His hair, which is about
an inch an q half long. stood straight
out all around his head like bristles
on a chimney brush; his nose of that
peculiar fabby rag on. a-peg look that
indicates q want of moral stamina !;
his mouth, which looks like the jaws
Of steel trap, and his face, livid
from the effects Of forty rod whisky,
and his generally miserable appear
ance might easily account for the mis-
take he made on the score of close
resemblance. He was charged with
the larceny of a quantity of clothing
from DR.. w. I'll. A. Lewis. Officer
Charles Tighe found him on Water
Street, on Monday evening, trying to
sell the articles. which are worth
about $75 90, for 81 90, and arrested
him on suspicion. Immediately after
being arrested he began to play crazy,
but before that had represented him
self as a steamboat cook, ont Of

his clothes. He was sent to the

John Lynch, the man who resisted

struck him in the mouth, loosening
his teeth was fined $14 40 on two
charges of drunk and resisting an Of
fcer. Lynch had but about nine dol
lars, and went to the lock up to serve
out his fine."

| Sales Of Revenue Stamps.


The chier OF the stamp division of the Internal Rev.
enue Bureau has prepared tabular statement show.
Ing the amount OF business done for the fiscal year
1S60-70 which will be incorporated in the Commits
sioner's next annual report. The number OF doOu-
ment stamps printed by the Continental Bank
Note Company in 1859 was 11S,O11 244 and for 1870
$780, 295, ,14l. Notwithstanding the increase In the
number Of stamps the government has realized less
BY SOC, 131 than from the sales for the year 1892
The increase IN the sale OF stamps seems to have
been confined to those OF the lower denominations,
ranging from two to fifty cents The falling Oh
in the receipts is attributable to the lessened
demand for stamps OF the higher denominations,
During the past fiscal year greater attention seems
to have been paid to the stamping of receipts and
cheeks the increase being over nine million Of
stamps. The proprietary stamps, printed by the
Philadelphia Company aud used principally on
patent medicines, in 1869 amounted to two hundred
and slxty-nine millions, and for 1870 two bun
dred and nlnety-eght millions, and gain to the
government In the receipts of $433 III from this
source. The stamps printed by the American note
type. imprinted on checks and documents, show an
increase OF nearly s200ooo last years receipts

The Decline or American Comm erce-G General


Buticr's Proposition.


The discussion OF the subject or the decline OF
American tonnage, which occupied the House yes
terday ana to-day, has revived very deep interest
IN that very important matter and set our legt Ia.
tors to thinking over the best remedy TO apply In
order to restore things to the an,e5eyum status.
The remarkable speech yesterday OF Fernando Wood
Of your city, who took the ground that American
tonnage, and not commerce, had declined, and who
ascrfbed the result 10 our own navigation laws and
other causes gave new turn to the thoughts OF
members, and the short address OF Ben Butler TO-

bottom. produced still greater eject vea's plan
IL precisely that foreshadowed In these dispatches
few weeks ago and received to-day with
very general favor Briefly it may be said to
provide for discrimination to the extent Of twenty
per cent on goods brought here from abroad IN
american wooden bottoms, and twenty five ON goods
In American iron bottoms. Ben elaborated hrs plan
In q skilful manner, and answered all objections
interposed with a promptness and clearness that
seemed to bother Mr. Lynch and the other gentlemen
iayoring the bill repor ed by the special Committee
on the Decline OF American Commerce. Ben con-
tehded that his plan would prove practically good
substitute for the long intricate tar OF schenck

Assault ON Judge Fisher by Joseph III,

This afternoon there was much excitement i'm

Gently entered upon the duties OF District Attorney

Bradley met him. and, 1t is alleged after saving,
Now, sir,' or ""Now, then,n dealt him heavy blow
with an ordinary walking stick. Mr.. Bradley then
cosely approacneu Judge Fisher when the Ia ter
threw out his ioot, tripping Mr.. Bradley, who fell
heavily to the pavement dragging Judge Fisher
Will him, the two rolling over together. At this
Juncture several parties inter ered separating the
belligerents and conducting them to their re-
spective oflces. Judge Fishers ear was slightly
cut by the fail and his shoulder was
somewhat hurt The police, after considerable
difilcuify, persuaded the crowd to disperse. Charles
Fisher, having learned Of the occurrence, declared
his purpose to resent the assault upon his lather
and started for Mr.. Brad.eys ofice in the second
story of the building at the corner, bat was pre-
vented by the crowd from entering and after con.
siderable persuasion by his father and friends was
induced to withdraw. The crowd at one time be-
came 80 great-every one arriving on the ground
asking for particulars--that Mr.. Fisher came out
and appealed to them to leave, saying that no one
had been hurt and he should not attack any one.
Mr. Bradley had meditated the settlement OF the
long standing dficulty with Mr.. Fisher whenever
the latter should leave the bench for the Attorney
ship ana thereupon took the first opportunity that
was presented since that change.


GOvernment Claims Upon Southern Railroads.


The House Committee on the Judiciary heard the
argument OF Judge Perry, Of Cincinnati to-day rela
tive to the claims Of the government upon certain rail-
road companies at the south. 1t will be remembered
that soon after the war the railroads. rolling stock and
other properly purchased and owned by the govern.
ment during the war were turned over to the COM
pan.es claiming them, with the understanding that
the government was to be reimbursed for whatever
outlay It had made ia extending repairing and i'm
proving such railroads. There are several millions
Of dollars now que, and instead of paying these
companies are making out Claims OF various kinds
against the government In the shape OF offsets to
their debt. The Judgment OF the Judiciary Com.
mitee inolnes to the opinion that the cases should
be prosecuted In the courts and that there is no oc.
casion for additional legislation to secure Justice
The Naval appropriation Bnl-ReductiOn Of


tac Pay Of Naval Ofncers.


The House has settled the pay OF officers of the
navy, In the Naval Appropriation BILL by cutting of
all allowances. including the thirty-three per cent
extra and making 1t a fixed sum per annum, as was
done by the House IN the military bill. According
to the new arrangement the scale will be as follows
for sea pay of officers per annum:-Admral $12 900;
Vice Admiral, $9,oOO Rear Admiral, so, 600; Com
modore $5,Ooo Captain, S. 200; Commander 81, 500;
Lieutenant Commander, So, 1907 Lieutenant, So 500.
This is slight reduction upon the present pay OF
officers OF the navy when their pay proper and al
lowances are counted, and good deal Of grumbllng
is the consequence.

lPRoM OUR OWE CORRESPONDENT


RIO DE JANEIRo, March 7l--The latest advices from
Paraguay show that the Brazilian commander is still
inGefatigably pursuing Lopez. Although her Platne
allies have retired from the contest as if disgused,
vet Brazil deems il necessary to her honor that the
war should still 90 on The expulsion of the Guarany
chief is regarded as the only fit termination to the
contest and SO Conde dEu evidently understands it.
This is the task that has been set him by his father
m.law, and the persistent manner in which he pur-
sues il only shows, think, the measure of the In
penal hate of the Paraguayan chief


Correspondence from AsunciOn, dated the 18th ut.,
states that Lopez had already passed the Apa, and
was rapidly pursuing his retreat to the north He
was said to DC accompanied by his mistress, Madame
Lynch his sons, and the Generals, Resquin, Cab





TO move so lesurely and securely, however that he
is supposed to carry with him large train of
wagons, loaded with commissary stores, and even
money. On the other hand, the Brazilian correspon-
dent states that the fight of Lopez is so precptate
that he is abandoning his artillery and munitions of
war and ordering those soldiers to be killed who fall
down exhausted by the march, and that he has al
ready IN this way. sacrificed many of those unfor-
tunates that he has directed even the women and
children to he turned out into the forests TO seek
their food, and that many of them have found their
way TO our forces iii Curuguaty, Conception, San
Pedro, and Rosario, but that greater part OF them
have died from hunger as they went wandering
through the thickets and marshes


UnquestiOnaby, whatever is useless and an incum-
brance would naturally be abandoned in such
mountainous country where only the highest of horse
artillery could be of service. Yet this is no proof OF
apreciPtate fight. As TO the charge of inhumanity
brought against Lopez the testimony is too uniform
and weghty 20 allow any doubt upon this point and
do not hesitate TO say, the frmest of my cOnylc-
tons regarding this whole contest that the ex
Dictator Of Paraguay has proved himself only worthy
10 be branded as an outlaw by the whole civilized
world. He appears to be making his way to the

Brazilian Province of Matte Crosse, and thence cross

tered the Province of Mato Crosse, and with all te
precautions that have been taken 1t Is not easy 10
suppose that his further progress toward lhe Duly

IL is generally believed that the termination OF
BraA's contest with Paraguay will also marx the
beginning of serious troubles between the EMPIRE
and her late Plaine allies. 1t is than probable
that the diplomacy Of Senor PaIanhas has already
created great dissatisfaction among the AIgehtlhes
and Mm.teydeans and that the sole ann OF conquest

1t is certain that Kittery, and Wells ard Ken
nebunk, and York. and Saco, cannot all secure
the nomination, and it is pretty generally un-
derstood that the respective friends OF Inc varl-
GUS candidates from York County, o, aons care ""a

the selection of a Lyman man would be a nice
compromise between the York County candi-
dates, and at tho same time prove terrible re-
buke to those Eliot, Alfred, marlborough,
Hollis and Limington Republicans, for daring
to send men here favorable to the nomination
of John Lynch.


A delegate from Parsonsfield will perhaps
say:


word ""Kittery' from the amended resolution,
and insert ""ParOnsfeld, or some one of the
Ossipee towns.' The York countyEcandidates
who have personally and through their agents
been importunate in urging their own claims
to this nomination, constitute a sea-shoro line t;





each produces head to wear, and a hand eager
to snatch the civic crown. But the don't say
""tursey"" once to us of the interior; our So
cality' is utterly ignored and our local claims
entirely disregarded, though twice as strong as
those urged for the seabOard towns. The gen.
tleman from KeDnebunk wants the canal at the
mouth OF the Mousau, river dug out, and re-
pels the idea that It was allowed to fill up be-
cause there was no occasion to use it; the dele
gate from Wells wants lighthouse and a GUS

How does that benefit s'the Ossipee towns?'
Ever since the Republican party has been or
ganized the nomination has been made all
along shore, and now it is time for it to travel
up country. Besides, we need a railroad more
than Kennebunk does its canal, or Wells its
custom house; and if we are allowed to send
our man he'll get Congress to give us enough
of the public land 10 build one. Don't run

we have no candidate; but, Mr.. Chairman, we

specting the resolution which it is said will be
offered to the Saco convention to-day. We
should have referred to the rumor before, but
Tor the fact, that a resolution of that character
would be SO sectional and disorgapizing that
we did not suppose any one would seriously
think of offering it.I ----------


There has been a rumor for several days
that the engineers of the ""York County"" move
ment will, to-day, offer q resolution TO the con-
yention, to the effect that the nomination of
candidate for Representative to Congress be-
longs to York county, and that the convention
shall confine itself to that locality"" in max
ing selection. OF course, but few delegates
will stultify the.osslves by voting for it, and if
it be not rejected with scorn and Indignation,
it will indicate remarkable forbearance upon
the part of the convention. The business of
the convention is to select man, and not to
pass resolutions which can by no possibility
have any binding force.


There will be no difficulty in ascertaining the
""local habitation"" of the candidate, after he is
nominated. More than one-fourth of the
York county delegation are favorable to the
denomination of Hon. John Lynch, and were
elected with the express understanding that
they should vote for him. If it were possible for
such resolution to pass the convention what
would be their standing in the convention?
Would they be precluded from voting for the
candidate OF their choice and obliged to vote
for candidate whom they don't want, and
whom their constituents don't want, in obedi-
ence to the command Of majority Of the
convention? Will anybody in that convent on
undertake to dislranchse the delegates
from Eliot, Alfred, Kennebunkport. Water


borough, Limington, Hollis, and scattering
delegates from Saco, Kennebunk, DAYTON.
Buxton and other towns? And yet, if a resolu-
ton OF this character were to pass and could
have any binding force, they must either not
vote at all, or vote for some person whom thew
know is not the choice of the people they rep
resent. Ifit is seriously proposed to offer such
resolution, would it not be well for the NOV
er to state what shall be done with these yari.
Gus town delegations from York county who
intend to vote for Mr.. Lynch? Will the con-
vention allow them to have little box all to
themselves in some sly corner of the hall.
where they can ""play"" holding convention,
and go through the form of depositing ballots
for the man whom their constituents want?
And what provision would be made for the
very large number of York county delegates
who openly declare their second choice TO he
for Mr.. Lynch?


Will the mover of the resolution and those
who support it allow these gentlemen to have
any second choice at all?


And supposng it possible for such a resolu-
ton to pass, would it not be advisable TO SIM.
plement it by another, declaring that the
nomination belon IS to Kitery? II it is the
BUSINESS of the convention to determine be-
fOrehand to which county the nomination be-
longs, why will it not become its dutv to
designate the city or town, and, if need be the
school district to which the honor belongs? If
the nomination is not to emoody the exDres-
sion OF the party as to WHO will best serve the
people, but Is TO be simply compliment to
l'cahty, ""hae shall prevent some gentleman
from Kittery addressing the chair somewhat
as follows:

Justice. to the head of which our parti-col-
ored friend, Acknowledgement Akerman has
been appointed. He will undoubtedly make
good law-advser. He is without doubt a
strong Republican, and his nomination will
unite the party in Georgia; while his en-
forced service among the ""gray-backs"" will
only exasperate those who were and still re-
main willing rebels. Mr.. Akerman assumes
the duties of his high Office with greatly en-
larsed powers; for the new Department of
Justice establishes the law office among the
most important departments of the govern
ment.


The other embryo Department is that of
Internal Revenue. Mr.. Commissioner Della
no is anxious for higher honors than those of
Premier Tax Collector. He has been on the
""anxious seat"" ever since he went into office,
having been chiefly anxious for something
higher, whether a cabinet portfolio or Sem
atorial curule. The latter has seemed the
""goal of his ambition"" and John Sherman,
whose place the Commissioner has been es-
toou1od on-Aio-.s sse1ry, probably aees -
wise thing personally in championing the
proposed enlargement of bis rivals present
position. He insures his silence and destroys
his opposition-to himself. So with Schenck,
who would also like Sherman's place, it is
thought, and would rather than not see Del
ano safely ensconsed in his ambitious ""Snug
Harbor""-the cabinet. 1t is not at all unlike
ly such approving energies combining with
the Presidents wishes, the Bureau of Inter-
|. nal Revenue may be elevated into Depart
ment


There are over-wise people who see in the
recent cabinet change, ia this desire to make
an Internal Revenue Department, and in the
rumored changes which are expected at the
State Department and London, flor though
officially denied these latter are generally be
lieved) a manifest determination of the Pres
ident to quietly get rid of the Massachusetts,
influence, which, according to some, has been
too largely in the ascendancy. Senator Sum-
ner is aimed at in the Motley rumor, and there
are many who think so in the case of Mr..
Fish. Certainly Mr.. Hoar belongs to the same
school. The Senator has SO bitterly opposed
the San Domingo treaty, upon the success
OF which the President has set his hopes, that
it is not to be wondered that the qaid nuncs
should suppose the President willing to pay
back in his own coin one who has checkmat
ed him. With regard to Delano, the same
busy brains suggest that to make the Ohio
Tax Collector a cabinet officer is to curb Gov
tUyplI fo cvfn ~, ALI,
quite freely about Presidential aspirations on
the part of both Secretary Boutwell, and
Charles Sumner. But who knows? The ru.
NOR is probably worth as much as the idle
WIND that blows-so far as this is concerned
One thing is to be regretted in watching infu
ences that have weight--or are accredited as
having weight-with the Administration. II
is the we-understood intimacy of Gen. But
Ter with the President; not the most desira
BILE counsellor or friend Massachusetts, can af
ford to an Executive she honors.


BUSINESS BEFORE CONGRESS-.


There are but seventeen working days left
OF the session, and large batch of appropria.
ton bills, the tariff and internal revenue bill
pending before the Senate, with the certainty
Of wide divergence between itself and tie
popular branch on many important points.


There are several appropriation bills yet un
acted upon in the House, and many of the un
fortunate employees about the capitol will as
consequence aid the filling of some money-len
der's Golfers, by being obliged this month a.
last to have their pay Ioll in order to obtain the
means needed for household purposes. The
funding bill is to be pushed through the House
so says Gen. Schenck-at least. There arc
nearly 100 bills on the Speakers table, some
OF which are sure to excite discussion. But witt
all these burdens before them, it is getting fal
too warm for our legislators to stay much lon
ger unless it be either to pass few more rail
road land grants or the appropriations for theil
own pay, at least During the last few day!
the House has done good deal of work, ant
dawding will probably be ruled Out of order.
AMERICAN TONNAGE AND ITS RELIEF.
There was good deal of hope entertained
by some of the ship builders and owners, who
desired to see American interests revived
after Mr.. Lynch's bill was rejected or recon-
mitted, that other gentlemen anxious to Sc
cure some personal eclat, would take par.
tial measure, like that embraced in the first
two sections of Mr.. Chambers bill and pass il
through curing the present session. But this
hope is likely to prove as delusive as the idea
OF expecting fair play for interests other than
their own from such western Chinese as are
some prominent gentlemen on the floor e
the House. Besides, there is strong though
not noisy lobby at work. The indefatigable
Capt. Goldman is back, and occasionally we
see others who are known to be connected
with transatlantic steamship lines. There are
at least two companies located in New York
and running vessels to Europe, the majority.
If not all, of whom are American citizens
They were swift to put their vessels, during
the war, under British colors. These repre-
sentative men are known to he British in tone
and copperhead in sympathy. In transferring
their vessels to such registry, somebody must
have come very near committing perjury-fcr
the English law requires the taking at an oath
that all or majority of the owners of said
vessels are English subjects. There is one
company running now ten or a dozen fine
ships, which is anxiously seeking re-trausfer
to American registry OF their English built
ships. Their chief has lately, through Mr..
Chambers influence, been appointed by the
State Department, the American referee to
assess the damages due from Spain for the un-
lawful detention of the ""Lloyd AspinwaIl."" !""

merce in COngress.",,"nierce In Congress.


Mr.. Lynch deserves credit for his persever-
ance in the House Of Representatives for
reviving and promoting the commerce and
shipping interests of the country. At first he
claimed too much, particularly in the matter
of subsidies or direct appropriations from the
Treasury; but seeing this was impracticable he
accepts the substitute to the original bill,
which does away with that feature of direct
bonus to shipbuilding. This shows that he is
intent on reviving the shipping interests of the
country and. that he will accept anything to
that end he can get from Congress. The sub
stitute to the original bill provides for draw
construction of ships and of stores used on
board of them afterwards. This Is undoubt-
edly fair and reasonable proposition. No
one who has the interests of our commerce at
heart or who takes broad view Of the ma
tional welfare could object to such PROPOSE
ton. There is, however, serious objection
to granting bonus-a direct payment from
the Treasury-upon American materials used
equal to the duty on foreign materials. This
would be in the interest only of limited
class of the community, and must lead to ex-
travagance and corruption. 1t is wrong in
principle, an outrage upon the taxpayers and
contrary to sound policy. Mr. Buffers plan
of favoring American shipping by reduction
of duty on foreign dutiable articles carried in
American bottoms would be better.


The debate on the bill to revive our COM
merce developed great ignorance and lament
able want of national feeling in Congress.
Some of the Western members showed con-
tracted sectional feeling that was disgrace to
the country. They seemed to think that the
West-their section-had no interest in our
shipping OF foreign commerce. How short
sighted How unpatriotic! Whatever tends
to promote the shipping interests and to en-
large our commerce must be benefit to their
constituents. But even if they were not
directly benefited these narrow-minded legis-
lators ought to remember that it is their duty
to legislate for the general welfare, and not for
would reap the advantages Of an enlarged
American commerce and an increase Of Ameri-
can tonnage as much as the commercial cities
of the East. The debate on this subject shows
what small local politicians we have in Con
gress and how much we need statesmen o
broad national views there. Still we have
hope, from the large vote of 1O5 yeas to 81
nays against Mr.. Allison's motion to lay the
bill and amendments on the table, that some
measure will be passed in favor Of revivine
American shipping and commerce."

Commodore Vanderbilt is turning his atten

will be the largest, most costly and imposing
building of the kind on this continent.


Sixteen thousand dollars of the money stolen
from the Office Of the treasurer of Vermillion
County, Indiana, has been recovered. A farm
er living near Clinton saw two suspicious look
ing men on Tuesday evening, and on attempt
ing to stop them, they ran away. The farmer
gave chase, and a large gang of railroad labor
ers Joined in the pursuit. The fugitives fled to
the Wabash river, when they pulled off most
their clothing, Jumped in, and SWAN TO the
opposite shore. One of them threw away a
package TO enable him to swim faster. Some
of the pursuing party swsm out and secured
the package, and found it to contain $4,000 Of
the missing money. When the thieves reached
the opposite shore man tried to stop them,
and succeeded in knocking one of them down,
but the other thief drew a revolver and drove
their antagonist off. The robbers then took to
the bush, with no clothing on except their
shirts and drawers. The whole country ie
aroused, hundreds of men are hunting for the
robbers, and in their present condition they
can hardly escape capture."

PORTLAND Jan. 90, 1870.
Admiral Farragut arrived here to-day to take
charge OF the naval portion or the Peabody Obsequies
He was accompanied only by his wife ana private
secretary. The party were received By the Portland
committee and escorted to apartments at the Fal-
mouth House. The Admiral remained quiet In his
rooms during the day. as he mas not fully recovered
from the effects OF his recent severe Illness. Mrs.
Farragut during the afternoon drove out 10 Fort
Prebe to visit her son Qeutenant Farragut, or the
Third United States artillery who Is stationed at that
post. Rear Admiral VI. X Thatcher Commodore
John H. Almy and the balance OF the officers de.
tailed for the Adn!rals STAFF Will be here early next
week.


The arrival OF he'Monarch and Plymouth s gene
rally expected next week. but 1t ts not regarded by
any means certain. Those best qualified to speak
think they Will not reach Portland before the 2sth.


In the evening Admiral Farragut. accompanied by
Mrs. Farragut, visited the City Hail. where the re-
mans are to lie IN State, by invitation OF Mayor Put
nam. The Admiral spent some time In viewing the
elaborate decorations.

General Ii. q. Hunt. formerly Chief OF Artillery OF

AN Interview WITH GOV. CHAMBERLAIN.",,"BANGOR, ME-, May 81.


The visit of Gen. Chamberlain to this city has had
the effect to intensity the interest which surrounds
the political situation in this State, and to further
complicate the web which is so provokngly entan-
gled. An interview of half an hour to-day with
His ENcellency, disclosed to your correspondent
the fact that great uncertainty attaches to the Rad
zeal movements, and much apprehension is felt as
to the continued aScendancy of the party in this
State. The Governor was most comfortably domi-
ciled at the fine residence of his venerable father
Col Joshua Chamberlain Although considerably
with his usual vivacity and freedom. That he .sil
lives"" is a marvel of marvcls. In reply to ques-
ton to the state of his health. he remarked that
it was surprisingly good for a person who had had
ragged bullet tear through his hips and abdomen,
and another through his breast, leaving an oritce
through which you might have passed the stick
you now hold in your hand"" Having been intro
duced as correspondent of the Boston Post, the
General remarked that when at home he was in the
habit of reading the Post, adding that it had treated
him with marked consideration.
Reporter-The Democratic press all the
country has been sparing of its criticisms Of you,
General.


Governor-I am sensible of the fact and appreci-
ate it. | presume it is attributable in part to the
circumstance that | am in no sense what is termed
a politician.


At this point the Generals father, who was an
old time Democratic politician and Sheriff Of Pc
nobscot county interjected the remark-''rhe boy
knows nothing about politics.""
Reporter-But nevertheless the 'boy"" has man.
aged remarkably well to keep the Republican par
ty OF Maine intact.


Governor-I have endeavored to discharge nv
duty to the people and have made some enemies bv
disregarding the counsels of a few who attempted
to control me. am impatient of restraint and res
tive under party discipline.


Reporter-It is given out that YOU do not intend
to enter the list again as Governor.


Goyernor-That is my intention. | have occupied
the position four years-one year longer than any
of my predecessors The office has its pleasures
and its perpleXites, and having shared both pro-
pose to leave the legacy to successor.


Reporter-Your decision limits the field to Her.
sey and Perham,


would doubtless fill the office acceptably.
Reporter--Which of the two in your judgment
will succeed!


Governor-Thc Convention, of course, will de-
eide the question, but my impression is that Mr.
Perham will obtain the nomination. I think Gen
Hersey OVerrates his strength.
Reporter-lt has been intmated that you were to
be brought forward as compromise candidate for
Congress in the first Congressional District
Governor-You can't rely upon all you hear. A
bitter feud exists in my district and is not certain
that it can be healed. If Mr.. Lynch should be NOM
mated, with the present feeling upon the subject,
the Democrats would stand Il fair chance to elect
their candidate.


Reporter-The Senatorial question complicatcs
the difficulties.


Goyernor-Unquestionab Mr.. Morrill, will be
candidate in connection with Mr.. Washburne,
and probably Mr.. Pike. do not see the way clear
for my friend Morrill,. Washburn seems to have a
good many friends in the Western counties.
Reporter-1Ou are aware that your name is men
toned in connection with the office
Governor-There was a time when the position
of Senator of the United States was yery desirable
| It would be so now if it could be bestowed by the
free and unbiased suffrages of the people, But the
means which are seemingly necessary to be en-.
ployed now to attain it. dvest it, in great measure
OF its traditional dignity and honor.


The impression conveyed by the Generals man
ner and conversation was, that he was very little
versed IN the ntrigues of politicans-that his CON
vlclons upon all topics are of positive character
and that he is thoroughly honest and sincere in the
| entertainment and enuncation of them."

not one of economical REFORM


The remainder of the session was occupied
Dy Messrs. Thufonan and Morton in favor of the

HOUSE.


Mr.. Maynard of Tennessee, from the Com
mlttee on Ways and Means, reported bill re-
ieving coal from all taxation and moved its
reference to the Committee of the Whole.


Mr.. Hooper of Massachusetts made q minor
lily report, signed by Messrs. Hooper, Brooks
OF New York, Allison of Iowa, and Marshall of
Illinois, stating that there were two members
absent when the matter was considered; that
the minority could not agree with the bill as
ren1rtGu nd fhara
posed substitute and that if all 5he members
OF the committee had been present the minor
ity bill would have been adopted. The substi-
tute provides that on and after September,
1871, bituminous and other coal imp )rted into
the United States shall be admitted free of
duty.


Mr.. Ward of New York moved that the ma
Jorlty report be recOmmitted because not in ac-
Gordance with the instructions of the House
contained in the resolution which he submit
ted.


Mr.. Schenck of Ohio chairman of the Ways
and Means Committee, stated that Immediate
ly after the House adopted resolution calling
upon the committee to report a bill relieving
coal from duly he was obliged to go to West
Point with the board of visitors. He had him.
self prepared and submitted bill to the COM
mitttee, placing coal on the free list. If he had
been present with the committee he should
have concurred with the minority of the COM
mittee. After further discussion the bill was
recommitted to the Committee of Ways and
Means.


The House then proceeded to vote on the
currency bill. and the amendments offe ed by
Ingersoll of Illinois, lynch OF Maine and Smith
of Oregon were rejected, and that OF Mr. Judd
Of Illinois to strike from the second section the
3t % mae Is 81 Gent Of the add
tional circulation issued, was agreed to.
The other amendments were rejected, Mr.
Coburn's, authorizing the issue of $45,OOO,OOO
IN greenbacks with which to redeem the per
nnf faC hV7 ff, o,,AI
tived two motions to lay on the table the bill
was passed, 98 to 81.


The House then resumed the consideration
of the resolutions in regard to Cuba, and was
addressed by MIR. Wood, member of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, who said he
had not supported either report, not thinking
that either gave any practical or substantial
aid to the Cuban cause. He thought it a yery
singular circumstance the gentleman Efrom
Massachusetts Mr.. Butler) who had been in.
structed to inquire into the premature pubica-
ton of the report of the gold investigation COM
mlttee should have extended that inquiry
without authority into the issue and use OF Gu
ban bonds, and that the President in his recent
message should have taken up the same point
MIR. Butler stated that the public statement
about the Cuban bonds did not come from any
information obtained from his committee
Mr.. Banks asked his colleague if he had not
exhibited the Cuban bonds to all the members


Mr.. Butler replied that he had exhibited a
one-half dozen bonds taken from the pockets
OF reporter of city newspaper, by paying
| him 10 cents on dollar for them. =
| Mr. Banks asked his colleague further why
subject under consideration for nearly three
months.


Mr.. Butler replied that he had brought be-
fore the Judiciary committee the question of
compelling the attorney OF the Cubans to dis
close the contract under which So, 000, 900 OF
bonds had been deposited and the question
was still before the committee.
Mr.. Eldridge of Wisconsin objected to the
disclosure of the matter before the committee
and the Speaker sustained the objection In
conclusion Mr.. Wood recapitulated at cOnsid-
cradle length the reasons which he said he
found more than justification for the recogni-
ton of Cuban belligerency.


MIR. Wood argued that the United States
would be justified in demanding of Spain au-
tonomy for Cuba like that which England
grants Canada and all her colonies, or as an
alternative that she relinquish at once her
claim to the island, which at best canaot long
| be maintained.


Mr.. Willard, another member of the CON-
| mittee next addressed the House in opposition
to the resolution of the majority
MIR. Butler of Massachusetts, spoke at length
against the resolution.


Mr.. Logan of Illinois, replied to Mr.. Butler
| in very animated manner, crticising him
| sharply in reference 10 his suggestions about
| the case OF Cuban bonds, recommending gold
as far better for eOrrupting purposes than bonds,
and said If anything had been used on either
side 1t would have been gold. He proceeded to
advocate the cause of free Cuba and to reply to
the arguments against the resolutions as to the
| arguments that there was no war in Cuba. He
wanted to know what the thirty Spanish gun
boats that We're allowed to come to New York
were intended for; was it to 90 fishing off Cane
Cod. Uaughter.) AS to the Presidents mes
| sage he said that if Gen. Grant had not been
in Pennsylvania fishing when the message was
written, he would not have signed as readily as
ne had done. He Nogan) was sorry that the
PRESIDENT had signed it; it was bad message.
| 1t did not state the law correctly, and he was
| sorry to see the President put upon record q
misstatement of the law. He appealed to the
House if it cared at all to err on the side Of
humanity and liberty; and to his fellow Re-
| publicans he appealed not to let the Democrats
| beat them in favor of liberty. (Applause)


Mr.. Banks refusing Mr.. Bingham's request
for permission to offer an amendment, CLOSED
the Gebate, after which Mr.. Bingham moved
| to reconsider the vote ordering the main ones
ton, that he might offer an amendmen


MIR. Eldridge moved to lay the motion on tn,
table. Negatived, 81 to ""A, in the midst of grea
excitement.


Mr.. Cox, of New York, moved to adjourn


the effect of which would have been to plac


the resolution at the bottom of the business OF


10l.


Ihe main question was then reconsidered


anu MI bingham offered as substitute fol

Liquor Licenses.-We give below a list
of Licenses issued by the Clerk of the Cir
cult Court for the ensuing year, from the
first of May last, for the sale of spirituous
liquors in this county. The licenses for
hotels are graded by the rental value. In
comparing the rental value of many of
them with said value given Oh the same
houses to the Internal Revenue officer, they
are found to be, in the case of the county,
considerably less. This is business for the
Grand Jury to attend to- There are prob
ably some other shops in the county, where
whisky is sold, that have not taken out a
license. 1t is the province of the Good
Templars, we believe, to attend to this, and
where any such are found, to report to the
Grand Jury, in September

Recently | hsd occasion to take q tour TO

and back, made many travelling acquairtances
from many different States. Conversation fire.
quently turned upon national affairs, and
thence upon prominent members of Congress.
was repeatedly a""ked, I'm what part of your
State, is the District represented by Mr.
Lynchr 1 learned upon that Journey, if |
did not know before, that Mr.. Lynch was one
OF the few members of the lower House who
had won for himself national reputation for
ability, sound common sepse and unexcelled
business qualifications.


In Western or Southern District the idea
OF setting aside such Representative as Mr.
Lynch 80 long as he would be willing to serve
Sns1aa %anid, not be entertained. OF Mr.. Lynch's
desires In THIS respect am not informed, bav-
ing but slight acquaintance with him. and
not enjoying the confidence of his intimate DO
lit:cal associates, but believe that the great
mass of the voters of the First District will not
consent that Mr.. Lynch should retire. simply
because there are several towns, or a whole
county even, that have not had the honor of
claiming the residence of the Representative
for a number of years past.


he must be bold man who, Simply because
ne deems 1t his turn to be sent, or the turn OF
his county or town to send a representative,
should be willing to substitute in the next Con-
gress his own necessarily comparatively insig-
nificant influence, for the extended and power
full influence which Mr.. Lynch has won by
three terms of faithful service. The compari-
sons which the country at large would ineyita-
Diy draw for a year or two at least between
such an one and Mr.. Lynch would be anything
put agreeable to the new Representative or
hattering or beneficial to the First District"

senntor Chandlcr's Speech ON Restoration Of


American Commerce.


Senator Chandler took occasion this morning TO
call mp his resolution insructing the Committee on
Commerce to inquire as to the best means OF rcstor
tng foreign commerce to American bottoms.
display Of manuscript on his desk indicated that the
pushing Michigander held pent up in MS patriotc
breast q speech OF careful preparation that he, as
chairman OF the Committee on Commerce. ana mus
peculiarly well informed on the subject before the
Senate should most appropriately deliver. senators
bccomngly seated themselves near unto the oracle,
and, after providing themselves with stimulating
chews, opened wide their ears and intel
lectuaI pores. The tenor OF the speech was
that OF opposition to the conclusions arrived
at in the report OF Mr.. Lynch, Of the House special
committee on the decline Of American commerce.
The senator stated that the committee had before
them the principal shipbuilders OF the country and
that their opinions anu he remedies suggested
as various almost as their faces The shipbullders
believed that the way to restore commerce was to
build ships, while the shpowners generally were OF
opinion that the only way 10 do it TO own ships
lie believed that we might build ten thousand ships
or own many, but that unless Il would pay to run
them they would all rot in docks. Just as soon
as the owners lost fi:e dollars on voy
age they would abandon the business. Among
the various plans proposed to restore our Ian
gushing and now almost ruined foreign commerce
he had been unable to arrive at any conclusion as to
what was the best thing to be done. The reason
why we could not compete with the English in
building ships was that the cost OF the labor was
twice great here there and that in consequence
the cost OF the completed snip nearly doubled.

yards there and had seen the vast arrangements
and perfect machinery OF establishments there, some
OF which employed 5000 men, and he believed that
the completeness that he there was the result OF
thirty years. experimenting, and the employment OF
enormous capital would prevent our being able to
bmld ships at the same cost. He discussed
the proposition Of dinerential duties, but saw no
solution Of the dniculty in that In short, the
Senator, though brlmming with commercial anu
nautical lore, which he dealt out to his attentive
listeners with most compacent liberaty, did not
have in his intellectual shop the panacea that was
to completely restore the suffering patient. But
suddenly halo seemed to beam from his luminous
face and around his senatorial head. Selling
walking cane that stood against his desk he stepped
back on the platform to the rear oil his seat, and,
with q dramatic flourish that showed some private
practice in stage BUSINESS he shot like q planet
from Its sphere and Ian ed Ofatoficaliy the Island
shores Of ST. Domingo. On the acquisition Of this he
dwet lovingly, saying that with st. Domingo would
come Cuba and the rest Of the West Indies ana
and then IN good time the Canadian Dominion, and,
then blessed be liberty the American eagle could sit
down and rest q while. He then went to the east
wall Of the Senate chamber, where map Of the
world was hung, and with hts cane in his hand he
demonstrated to the riveted eyes Of greedy Sena-
tors what natural tning it would be to pick up
these West India gems After this the audience
heard more OF sDips or aid to ship lines. The
Senator was launched on his avOrlte theme OF terri
tOral ACKNOWLEDGEMENT, and only ceased when his
shiilelah and rhetorical nourishes seemed to have
lost their effect and the Senate seemed inclined for
change OF scene and the regular business. st. Do
mmgo ingeniously made its first public introduction
IN the Senate on shipboard.


Absurd Ending Of Congressional UnpIensart-


ness.
Some very oicious people took it into their heads
to-day to obtain warrant for the arrest Of Captain
Goldman who it will he remembered, had an un
peasantness with Congressman Negley at the Airing
ton Hotel night before last. The impression got
abroad somehow, that the spunky little Goldman
was o dangerous customer, and intended to ""go
through"" all Congressman who had been abusing
him for lobbying against Lynchs BILL 1t was there
fore conceived TO pe prudent to put him in sac
Keeping or under bonds TO keep the Presi-
dents peace during MS future stay among
washingtonians. Our local District Attorney
was informed that Goldman was a great,
big ferocious Englshman, with bloodthirsty
tnclnattons towards all true Americans and Fenians,
when the officers of the law, ar med with terrible
warrant, were shown Goldman they were much
taken aback. They found small man, scarce five
feet high, and not at all vilanOus looking. There
was no use, they found. for the neavy armament
they had brought with them to secure his capture.
General Negley, hearing OF the absurd project to
cage Goldman, interfered his friendly Offices and tried
TO have the thing abandoned. Goldman, however, ,
was taken into custody and bonnd over to Keep the
peace. He was kept for some time in room Of the
City Hail. among parcel OF negroes much TO his
disgust and horror General Negey was likewise
sent for and requested to enter into his recOy-
nizance to appear on the day OF trial.

rendered in getting him his seat. Wallace is re-

the Murderer.

NEwBURG, August 80. 1870.",,"NEWBCRG, August ~, 1870.


John l.. Seaverns, proprietor of the machinery
works In this city, was murdered at seven O'Clock
this evening, while sitting at the supper table with
his wife. The murderer, Lieutenant Button. ap.
preached him from behind and shot him IN the neck,
the bali passing through the spinal marrow and caus-
ing instant death. After the murder Button retreated
to the third story OF the building and threatened to
shoot whoever should approach; but afterwards
went down and delivered himself up to Sheriff
Tuthill and Chief Of Police Goodrich, who lodged
him in the JAIL one block distant.


Button was discharged from the Worcester (Mass)
Lunatic Asylum last week, and came here on visit
to Mr. Seaverns' sen, whom he had known at the
asylum. Both have lately INDUCED IN dissipation
This morning Mr.. Seaverns upbraided Buron gave
about all day, making frequent threats, he returned
craftily tonight and performed the bloody deed.


The victim was highly esteemed, and his murder
caused fearful excitement. The streets near the
scene were thronged and threats OF lynchlng were
made. The Mayor, sheriff and police scarcely re-
strained the impulse. The assassin on Saturday
procured from General Grant, at West Point, en-
trance papers TO the Poughkeepsle insane asylum.
He represented himself breveted for meriiorious
services during the late war.


Mr.. Seaverns is well known manufacturer OF pa
per machinery and lately removed from Worcester
Mass The body remained bolt upright in the chair,
one hand retaining the knife and the other some
bread both hands supported on the table.


At the jail Button refused 10 give his name He
was yet intoxicated. The pistol was a double bar
relied one carrying half ounce ball. As a measure
OF precaution young Seaveins was also lodged in
JAIL being again unsettled In mind at the terrible
calamity."

Lad assembled to see what action was 10 be taken
Some Of the offenders were not in the ROOM hat
they were represented 10y counsel.


Paddy keenan,, the of muscle. was sitting at

perhaps, over the unpleasantness "" which he had
fallen into, while Justice Walsh who is also under

but was compelled to ask for an adjournment, not
beyond next Thursday morning, when he would be
prepared to make his motion to quash, and il thnt
should be d""red, then he would be rcady to go on
with the trials.


District Attorney Morris said he proposed to name
the indictments which he should bring on first.


Mr. Briuon thought that would be a very fair pro

Judge Troy said n the parties desired to make a

WASHINGTON, Feb. 10, 1870.


Secretary Fish has received q long and interesting
letter from Mr.. Q. f. belong, our Minister Resident
In Japan. He.gives full account OF his trip to aud
arrival ut his post Of duty. lie complains that be-
Ing but Minister Resident, he is Outranked BY the
English French Italian and Holland Minister'S: saws
that his salary sufficient and Il Is Impossible
for the American Minister to have influence Japan
to compete with other foreign Ministers II the po-
Sltl0n IL not made 1rst class. he says that our
receipts from duties for imports from Yokohama
alone were over $2soo.Ooo last year. and
Creasing throughout the seaport cities OF the empire.
The Pacific Mail Steamship Company mas given q
travellers are constantly pouring into Jeddo and
Yokohama on their tours round the world, and yet
the Minister and officers OF the Legation have nor
sufficient means from their pay TO treat their coun
trymen properly. He says that Jeddo will certainly
always be the capital OF Japan. and urges that Le
dence should be erected thero ~ once, and that a
guard OF say twenty five American soldiers should
De alw ays there under the command OF proper OIL.
GERS that man. .0fwar should always be IN port at
the service OF the Minister and Legation. This Ii
what all the other great Powers do. The
Japanese government respect only power
and tho show Of it. He Gays that the British
penses Of the Legation, houses, JAIL PSF ONCE,
ahnsh0use and hospital, and Is, therefore, enabled
to give proper entertainment. and does receive IN
consequence much attention from the Japanese
authorities. lie urges the erection Of post oiice,
jail and hospital, together with Minister'S resi-
hama. He contends that they are absolutely neces
sary, and the ground IN Jedd0 has been III the pos





awaiting the action Of Congress to erect the neces
sary buildings. He mas received notification from
the Japanese Ministers that the taxes must be paid
or the ground returned TO The Japanese govern
ment, which presented It to our government for the
purpose OF our erecting Legation buildings, Minis.
ter's residence. &C., upon 1t.


A GLOOMY ACCOUNT.


Mr.. DeLonz gave gloomy account Of the condi-
ton OF the Minister'S residence aud buildings used
by the legation and say these the best lhat can
be obtained FOR the rent paid, &c and that hours
connagration woald destroy them, with all the
MI lnt ,tu
belonging 10 our government. lie says the British
Minister mas notified nm that ne Will be compelled
and Mr.. DelOng contends that 1t ID very hUmilatnQ
to have tc depend on foreign power for such ncces
or great nation with whom we are striving to
establish commercial relations. &C. lie says the
opening OF the Pacific Railroad and the %.
tablisnment OF steamship line from JeaO
and Yokohama 10 San Francisco las revolutlonI2ed
Japan and that she VIII soon be OF the drst IN
importance IN commercial point OF view. He says
Congress must le9isate, and tnat quickly, or the
other Powers WIN gain many advantages over us:
that he feels the indign,ty OF his position when
brought in contact VITA tne japanese Ministers or
with the representatives or other Powers, With his
own countrymen, aud that he had much rather
resign or be recalled lnan occupy tie position under
such circumstances; ior, go placed, he felt that he
was without influence or power at court ana there
fore without abillLY To serve his country bcneaciay
lie deyote5 o numDer OF pages or his letter to the
subject OF naval force always to be retained az the
Japanese seaports ald along the coast. lie says the
Oneida ordered home; that two other vessels
were gold, aud that the Idaho was lately broken up
III q typloon, so that there is really no American
man-0War there to protect American citizens and
commerce and, from wnat lie can ascertain he leeis
that civil war VIII break out In some part
OF The empire. lie says the Mikado has purchased n
maii-of-w war from the English, which II Is gaid far
exceeds The SlOneWall IN lower. He fears no hos.
Tile acis from the Japanese government, but only
therefore urges the presence Of naval force always
IN the Japanese waters. Hs says the Japanese peo-
pie prefer to trade with our people, and this Of
course lrrltate5 other Foreigners and doubtless
many acts OF Violence are committed ut their instl
gallon Finally Dir. belong urges Secretary Fish
e. do sometaing in the matter in reference 10 ns
suggestions, at ms earliest convenience.


THE REMEDY.


Secretary Fish has taken the subject In hand with
earnest lie had yesterday and to-day consultations
with the President. who ~ In favor OF raising the
mission TO first class one; OF erecting all suitable
buildings At Jsddo and Yokohama, and or doing ali
that Is necessary 70 foster aud increase trade

Saturday Morning, July 2, 1870.

Unauthorized Bargains",,"Whatever shall be the issue of the coming
election in this District, land that Mr.. Lynch
will be elected can scarcely be doubted,) one
good result will have been achieved by the late
convention. The authority of precedents, be
they real or pretended, has been broken, and
it is to be understood hereafter, and we hope
forever, that the people do not mean TO be en-
slaved in their choice of public servants by
the tact arrangements or understandings
among politicians, but will exercise their
judgment untrammeled by any Unauthorized
bargains These can at best be binding only
On the individuals who expressly give their
assent to them. Nothing could be more ridic-
uous than the recent attempt to give them
the dignity and force Of law, and insist upon
enforcing them at all hazards. Those who
enter into any such agreements do it at their
own risk and cannot tasten the responsibility
upon any one else.


1t is the height of arrogance to pretend
that the people of this Congressional Dis
trlct must submit to the dictation of local
clique This is degrading public offices to the
catalogue of loaves and fishes, to be divided
round so that all may have a nibble. If this
system is to prevail, popular government is
Indeed failure, and instead of having an elec-
ton, it would be much cheaper and more ex-
pedltlous to put the names of the eligible can
didates in the locality from which the selec-
tioE is to be made into lottery, and leave the
issue to chance. That nominations have
sometimes alternated from one county to the
other in this District, is merely historical
accident. To pretend that it is ANYTHING
more is simply moonshine. The nominations
should depend upon the qualities, not the
residence of the candidates.


Nominations to office are no fit subjects for
trafhc. Delegates are not sent to conventions
with any authority to make promises for
their constituents to be performed at future
time. All such dickering is null and void
from the beginning, and if delegates from
York county acted on any other supposition
two years ago, they showed gushing sim
plicty which more experience in the ways of
the world will wear off, To trade away
present opportunity for a future expectation,
was entirely beyond the scope of their author
ity, and let the result warn them as well as
all others that the people have not yet sur
rendered their sovereignty to any such ex-
tent. 1t is to be regretted that the dsap-
pointed expectants feel so sore about it
But we trust that on the sober second
thought our brethren of York will see that
4, they have no good reason to waver in their
devotion to the Republican party. They have
not satisfactorily answered the arguments
urged in favor of Mr.. Lynch on the ground of
his valuable experience in Congress. Nosen-
slble business establishment turns off an en-
ployee as soon as he gets thoroughly broken
in. 1t is only in politics that this supreme
folly passes for wisdom."

staple. and city that has been In the
past few years victimlzed by dishonest government
ocals, and greatly oppressed IN this branch OF In
dustry by the excessive tax imposed on the manu-
acturer and dealer. Here, too every branch OF the
trade was represented, from the producer to the
manufacturer Capital and labor caine face to face
and In the discussions that took place there was q
marked attention paid TO the claims OF all upon the
consideration OF the association. Every member
seemed to feel too that great deal depended upon
the action OF the body. They were fully convinced
that the tobacco trade labored under serious dis
advantages at the hands OF the government, and
this through lamentabe ignorance on the part Of
Congress and the Revenue Bureau as to the nature
OF the trade and the capacity OF the article com.
morclal point OF view TO bear taxation.


REDUCED UNIFORM TAX.


The main object OF the present meeting, and upon
which the association was thoroughly bent, though
few had hopes OF success. Is the reduction OF the
tax upon the manufacture OF tobacco to a uniform
rate upon all grades and classes, Including snur
cigars. On this vital subject the trade there
was an interesting and lengthy debate. In which

gentlemen doubtless represented every branch OF
the trade, and though the plug Interest, the fine
seemed TO clash upon minor ponts--such as the
pnraseology OF the resolutions, the mode OF obtain
Ing the desired relief &C., yet they were all unani-
nous In the conviction that the trade required o
reduced uniform tax OF sixteen cents per pound
upon all grades Of manufactured tobacco. IL was
clearly shown In debate that the oppressive tax was
gradually making the cultivation OF tobacco un-
profitable to planters that dealers were unable TO
pay liberal price. and planters we're compelled TO
oh fnhn and hair ttat
ducrion OF more profitable crops. And again gem
tleman quoted official figures TO show that In In
stances where Congress had been wise enough 10
reduce the tax upon tobacco there was an
increase In the manufacture OF tho article,
which yielded revenue nearly equal TO the
former excessive tax. As the debate progressed
some OF the members became quite enthusiastic in
their efforts to secure the harmonious cooperation
OF the association In this laudable direction. Some
OF the Western members were In favor Of resisting
the collection OF any tax exceeding sixteen cents
per pound; Others more moderate, were in favor OF
demanding Of Congress the speedy reduction OF the
tax to the Uniform rate proposed, while Others still
more moderate, were content with asking the reduc-
ton, II consistent with the views OF Congress and
the demands Of tho country; but the latter class
were few and feeble, and the majority were loud IN


REVENUE REpoRx


In the tobacco trade. Tho Commissioner, Mr.. De-
lano and his subordinates were quite severely criii
cised-the former for his misconstrued rulings and
decisions and the latter for their dishonest practices
which demoraze the trade and corrupt the
manufacturer. Both or these were spoken OF US the
greatest evils the trade labored under, induced by
the heavy taxes and the discriminating and cumber-
some legislation which imposes them. Tne entire
system OF the revenue service In It's relations TO the
TOBACCO trade was forciby condemned, and speakers
IN many Instances not only gave ample illustrations

RICHMOND, Va, Dec. g, 1870.


The banquet given by the Richmond Tobacco Ex.
change TO the members OF the National Tobacco As
sociation at the Ballard House last night was most
brilliant affair At half past over two hundred
persons were seated at tables that fairly groaned
under load OF delicacies that would make the
eyes of an epicure gsten with delight. The
banquet was presided over by Mr.. Lewis Ii. Frayser,
OF this city, who is also Vice President of the Ma
tional Tobacco Association, and he welcomed the
visitors In short and well-timed address. Colonel
Peyton Wise occupied the extreme end OF the table,
and, In response TO toast, made the most eloquent
address OF the occasion. William II. Lawrence OF
New York; Mr. James Gallagher, OF New Haven,
Colonel Wilder OF Boston; DR.. T. r. Spence OF Gin
clnnau; Mr.. Stafford, OF Baltimore; Colonel II. H.
Withers, OF Lynchburg. Mayor Reilly, OF Richmond
and Mr. j. A. Cowardin, also OF this CITY, made ex-

ever, was


GOVERNOR Walkers SPEECH.


HIS Excellency occupied seat next TO Mr..
Frayser who presided at the banquet, and imme-
diately confronting Mr.. Lawrence, President OF the
National Tobacco Association. The toast was.
'The State OF Virginia; with good Walker FOR her

Mcclellan would have been appalled,: that
the Confcdcracy, Mt least in Virginia, was
far stronger then to compel him than
il WAS to drive Mcclellan from Manassas
or from Yorktown; that he fought Lees

something of success. So far, tho compare

leaving him only strangled victim to be
carried in his train of triumph.


The Southern Confcdericy was never
conquered by the force of arms. No des-
perate and multitudinous battle decided
its fate. There was no dramatic close; 1t

We, yesterday afternoon, published Q brief
account OF the sinking OF the United States
screw slcopof-war Oneida, of the Chinese
Squadron, and the loss of one hundred and
twenty lives by the disaster. 1t appears by the
cable dispatches that tho collision occurred
near Yokohama, Japan, between the Peninsula
and Oriental steamship Bombay and the Oneida.
hundred and twenty men. The Bombay was
slightly injured. 1t is not stated that any of the
officers or crew of the Oneida were saved


1t is stated at the Navy Department that the
Bombay is a large mail steamship, and could
easily sink the Oneida by striking her amidships.
The Oneida was considered one of the best
sloops-ef-war in the navy, and her commander
one Of the most experienced and reliable. She
mad been ordered to San Francisco, and it is
the opinion of the naval officials that she had
just left Yokohama for that place when she as
run into by the British mail steamship on her
way into the bay. OF course, this is but sur
mise. She may have been anchored in the bay,
and struck during a fog or at night. If the
Oneida was on her way home there were num-
Der Of officers on leave from the squadron who
were doubtless on board of her. No names, as
70 who were lost or saved, have yet been re-

The Secretary of the Navy has been visited
by many sorrOw-stricken friends of persons OH
the Inflated steamer, anxiously inquiring tor
further particulars of the disaster.


Mr.. TullOck, Collector Of Internal Revenue
Tor this District, whose son was paymaster on
the Oneida, received a letter from him recently
dated Yokohama, Jan. sd, announcing that his

the 24th, fifteen miles from Yokohama, it is
presumed that it must have been in the night

enough to run clear through her.


THE ONEIDA.


The Oneida was built at New York about ten
years ago, and is a third class screw steamer,
carrying about 40 men, including her officers
She was repaired at New York early in 1856, :,
and sailed from there for the Asiatic feet about
june in that year. 1t is impossible to tell who
who was on board at the time or the accident
besides her officers and crew, and rs it is the
custom when vessel is coming home from
foreign station to send home on her the officers
and men of the fleet whose times have expired,
therefore, highly probable that the Oneida had
on board besides her officers and crew some sixty
or seventy officers and seameA OF other vessels
en- route to the United States, though tho Iro-
quois sailed from the same fleet a shorl time
since, and is now on her way home with a num-
Der OF officers and seamen from the fleet. 1t is
Oneida who had not been out very long, were
detached from her and put on other vessels
prlor to her sailing for home, and their places
supplied with officers from other vessels, who
had been longer on the station.

The Ninth regiment attended church IN a body
here to-day, Colonel Fisk at their head. 1t is said
that II Is the first lie has heard In nine years.
He was greatly moved by the unusual sensation and
shed tears. 1t was better than play to him.


In the afternoon the regiment held its dress
parade on Main street, and probably five thousand
spectators looked upon the display. Ocean avenue
Main street and the adjoining streets were crowded
and jainmed with vehicles and people on foot. and
the balconies and windows OF the Metropolitan
Hotel were filled to overnowing. feet Of yachts
lying OF short distance from the shore fred saiutes
every minute during the parade, ana Luther's
Hymn was sung by the full regiment under the
direction OF Chaplain Spencer. The magnificent
Fisk, in ell the grandeur of gold and bullion. and
the i've thousand dollar uniform, which so well sets
on MS imposing figure, commanded III person, and
gave highly satisfactory evidence to his friends of
having crammed himself full or military knowledge


There has been intense excitement here all the af
ternoon owing to the fanatica denuncaton of infal
bity by Rev. Sidney A. Corey, or New York. in his
sefnion tnls morning. he MADE the following
marks concerning it,


The greatest crime that ever was committed on
this earth was done In the nineteen century by de-
CarIng the Pope iniallibe and next to Cod He be-
heved The war which now exists in Europe can be
Set down as God's war, brought on by the anger of
God towards tnls Popery question. Upon the an
n0uncement Oh the Popes lnfalliblty the needle
gun commenced cracking throughout France, ana
the war which now exists viii overthrow this I'm
p0rsant question and diminish the Catholic religion.
In consequence OF these remarks mob assembled
to lynch him, but he escaped and Is now safe. But
all day there has been an intensely everish feeling
bordering on an outbreak like the religious ene,0es
that sometimes occur in Madrid or great Spanish
American cities


Cots were spread at the various hotels here last
night for six hundred people. One year ago there
were not six hundred guests here In ALL and tonight
there VIII be at least twelve thousand.


The President did not STIR out to-day except for

Louis. a swtchman, being uncOmmoniy sleepy, 50
set his switches that passenger train and coal
train came into collision, running two locomotives
and driving the smokingcar into the first regular
passengercar nearly its entire length, killing one
fireman and two passengers. Everybody else es-
capped with bruises more or less painful, but no,
dangerous"" But the main point is that, according
to the account before US, ""the passengers did not
seem to show any special indignation toward the
switchman who is charged with the grave RESPONSE
bity for this accident"" We suppose that to be 80
nj Oh unto death and to escape it, softens the heart
and perhaps the head. To have lynched that somno-
lent swtchman incontinently would have been going
possibly little too far but this acceptance of the
boon of bare life at his unfaithful hands argues
kind of milky meekness which speaks well for the
advance of genuine non-resisance principles at ths
West."

REVIVAL OF AMERICAN COMMERCE.
The House then, at half-past eleven A. NJ, pro-
ceeded to the consideration of the bill to revive
American navigation and commercial interests.
Mr.. pErEHs, p0.Li OF Me, addressed tie House In

lie was opposed TO excluding coasing vessels FROM
the beuebIs OF the blll. There were niany objections

distinctions between the vessel That crossed Lake
Erie and the vessel that only coasted along the
AMERICAN side Another reason why IL should not
be excluded was that the coastIng trade wnlcn now
was u badly paying business, might be enabled to
compete Win the railroads. The navigation interest
needed AID and encouragement, ana needed II now.
lie believed there was no form In winch ~ could be
80 safely given or received In the shape OF the
pending bill, WIN all ITS provisions.
Mf CoBUKH, ,rep.) Of lnd., opposed the bill, and
also opposed the amendment OF the gentleman from
massachusetts (Mr. Butlerl. The bill WAS not pro-
Jecr To encourage commerce or navigation, buS
merely TO encourage shipbulldng. II Lne pgopo-
sitlon were TO encourage commerce or navigation

eicct of the discrimination proposed by the gente.
man from Massachusetts (Mr. Butierl would be
AT once 10 enhance enormously the value OF
American shipping. There could be no greater
speculation than Ia such properly, and IL would re-
duce the revenue twenty, thirty or forty millions.
Besides II was a cutthroai game. IL would STIR mp

covering the whole ground, he should vote Tor it;
bui The measures nov proposed We're narrow, un-

suit in disaster 10 the country.


The discussion was continued by Mcssrs. Brooks,
OF n. T., Cox, schumacher, Cakin, marshall. Banks
ana Ferry.


Then Mr. LYNCH, rep) or Me-. who had charge of
tie bill. moved the previous question, hrst allowing
amendments TO be offered.


The amendment proposed by Mr.. Butler, OF Mass,
imposing diIferentiai duties was offered FOR him i'll
his absence by Mr. GARFIELD, trep.) OF Ohio


Mr. BINGHAM, trep) OF ONO. offered an amendment
TO that amendment imposing II duty OF ten per cent
oil goods imported IN other tnan American vessels.


Mr.. Cox, ldcn.j OF n. Y, offered an amendment to
the first section. TO strike out the proviso removing
the drawback allowances where tue materials used
are OF American production.


MI 0oD, tdem.) OF n. Y, moved 10 strike out the
third and fourth sections allowing subsidies 10 ves-
sels engaged IN foreign commerce and repeating ton
mage dtes. IL those sections and the provisO the
first section were struck out he would vote Tor the
bill otherwise he would vote against 1t.


Mr. SARGENT, (rep.) 0f Cal, moved to amend the
third section by allowing five dollars per ton on
steamers running To and any port OF Australia

Mr. lNGEEsoI. trep.l Of fl moved an amend

second and third sections be stricken out.


Mr.. ALLISON lrep.l OF Iowa, desired to offer an
amendment limiting the allowance of drawbacks TO

Mr. LYNCH declined 10 admit that.

A Promising Sensation spoiled-A Bloody


Duel Prevented.


There has been an after piece 70 the heavy drama
ON Bullock and Georgia enacted In the Senate
last week, which promised for awhhe lead to big
results In the shape OF one or two dead
bodies on some bloody field in the vicinity
OF Bladensburg or elsewhere. But, like many
another affair which opened with fair pros
poets OF a big sensation, 1t has suddenly
ana very natly come to an end. No duel is to hap
pen Neither Bullockite nor Ferryite is to I'LL an
untimely grave, and Norton and Ferry VIII nave no
dead body' to answer for hereafter at the judg-
men seat II appears that on the day Of the furious
debate between Ferry ana Morton on the Fir
teenth Amendments bill friend OF Bullock hap
pened to be in the Senate and freely expressed
his views ON the high merits Of the Indiana
Senator's address. gentleman 10 whom these re-
marks were particularly addressed unfortunately
happened to be on the other side, and took mortal
offence at the Bullockite's freedom Of speech. He
retorted very harshly, and the result was formal
demand by the Bullockite for reiracton. A corre-
spondence followed, and 1t seemed as though bloody
business was meant The Bullockite-Major Ben I.
Hutchins by name--chose q friend, and the other
party Colonel Quntqs Curtius Washington fortified
himself likewise. The nrst chosen seconds would
not work lood-thirsty enough, and new batch was
chosen and then another. General George W.
Adams was the first a,sicus of Hutchns, and L. l..
Crounse oilciated mildly for the other side. Then
young Bright, son Of the ex-senator ana General
Ames took their places as substitutes and finally the
seconds became General Rlcnard Winter Smith and
Johnny Coyle Under the last named gentlemen
the hostile negotiations were perfected and the
choice OF weapons made l believe the hour or
meeting on the bloody field was actually fixed. 1t
was great pity, therefore, such promising sensa
tIon should be spoiled; hut was. There
was a hitch In some place. and the duel
was abandoned. Hutchins claims he comes Off with
nying col0rs, while Washington Is reticent but emil
nentIy dignihed. Your correspondent interviewed
tonight the gallant Major, who stated that friend
OF Colonel Washington informed him that soon after
the little 'onpeasanmess' IN the Senate gallery
Washington sent for couple OF pistols
which he has carried ever since. Hutchns says
he regards Colonel Washington as not wish
ing 10 fight, and hereafter lie win not
recognize any communication from him. As the
correspondence is very brief suppose 1t may be as
well to send IL TO you. The Bullockite first sent q
note by l.. l.. Crounse to Mr.. Washington, demand.
ing a retraction OF the offensive words which were
according To Major Hutchings, as f0llOws:--


God damn you, sir, don't know you; and God
damn y0u, sir, don't want to know you and God
damn you, slr II had my way would hang every
one Of you, SIR.


To this note Mr.. Washington responded as fol-.
lows:--


WASHINGTON, ID. c., May IS, 1870


SIR--Your note, bearing yesterdays date, was

Tho Cuban Question in tho House-A Re.


markabIe Debate.


The most striking features or the House proceed.
ings to-day were the temporary defeat Of Lynchs
prescription for the terrible malady aficting Ameri
can tonnage and very interesting and apparently
unprecedented discussion Of the Cuban question.
The present defeat OF Lyncn was looked for There
were rumors anoat in the air for q week past that
such would be the result Of all his labor and pains;
but nobody, fancy. anticipatedIthat to-day during
the discussion OF such a dry subject as the Consular
and Diplomatic Appropriation bill for the
second time, one Of the most remarkable debates
OF the session would have occurred and yet think
it not unreasonable to predict that out Of the spon
taneous outDurst in behalf OF Cuba ON the floor OF
the House to-day more solid results are likely to
nOw, calculated, to give shape and character to
foreign policy. than anything that has happened
here since the advent Of Grants administration.
During the life OF the present Congress many
speeches were made in favor OF lending helping
barren OF effect Members listened but
seemed Indifferent and careless about the
matter. 1t really appeared as though Congress
had no heart for anything but reconstruction and
the African. as If the great representative body Of
the great republic OF the world was unable to settle
domestic troubles and at the same time extend a
generous aid to a feeble but noble people battling
against tyranny and oppression. But to-day, when
Mr.. voorhees,, Of Indiana, IN q speech OF impas-
stoned eloquence, drew vivid picture of the
American nag, dishonored by Spanish inso-
lence, and caused to be read the account
OF the insults offered to Consul at Santiago de
Cuba, he commanded the most breathess attention
AMI reused the House to genuine expression OF
There was not single member who dared to up
hold the supine policy thus far practised in regard
to Spain. Republicans who are recognized as
the ablest leaders of the House expressed
themselves freely in favor Of prompt action,
and some Of them even attacked the
administration over the shoulders Of the
Navy Department, rather unjustly for not having
long ago indicated the sacred character OF flag
both In Paraguay and Cuba. Mr. Dawes was
very emphatic in expressing his condemnation, and
Logan, OF Illinois, in speech OF great earnesness
and power, called for a vigorous and honorable
policy In regard to struggling Cuba. Mr.. Banks, OF
Massachusetts, declared that the Foreign Affairs
Committee were ready and eager TO make report
whenever an opportunity would be given, ana that
he had been waiting for chance to do so and at the
same time stated that he and his committee would
be found as anxious and willing to defend American
rights as any body of men In Congress out Of Il.
There seems to be little doubt, from the
character Of all the remarks made that something
Will be done speedily to resent the Spanish insults
and to show to Spain and the world that The Amer-
can nag must be respected and that the rights of
American citizens abroad can not be invaded with
impuny. Indeed the feeling seemed to he so strong
verify believe had any member proposed 10
consider the subject In regular form, and moved
TO allow General Banks TO make q
report then and there there would not have been
single dissentient VOTE AS the case now stands
both sides Of the House are strongly committed to
the cause Of Cuba as against Spain, and action
may be expected In regard to Consul Phillips, the
American citizens murdered in Cuba and the entire
Cuban question within very few days.

RIO JANEIRO, May 25, 1870.


An affair something like Senior Anton's has caused
good deal OF irritation in the city. Although Rio
SPENT only three or four weeks ago, about 100000
on peace rejolcngs, the Minister or War suddenly
determined some ten days ago. 10 have official re-
jocings, the others merely being, he says, popular
ones he contracted for large temporary erection
for grand re Den,. in the Campo Of Acclan,ation,
and alter it was partly up and everybody was won-
derlng what 1t meant, asked extraordinary credit
of 100000 from the Legislature TO meet the cost OF
the AFFAIR. After hot debate the credit passed the
first readlng; but the people very indignant and
guard OF $50 soldiers is kept round the erection at
night for it Is said that there designs of blowing
1t up. The grand official rejoicings were to take
place upon the 24th; but, though working day
and night the building could not be got ready so the
ceremony s adjourned sine die. The management
OF this affair puts one in mind OF the saying that in
Germany Il you spit out of a window upon crowd
the chances are even that you spit on a Herr Coun
cor for here, IL there is financial JOB perpetrated
the odds are thousand to that the Minister Of
Finance has an irrepressible nephew son-in law or
nephew's or son-in-laws brother-in-law in it. and
the Official rejoclngs job is another instance Of this
pecularity.


The Interpolation as to the Mnistry's intentions
in regard to emancipation came OF upon the 18th.
Senor TeiXeira, Junior, the interpelator said that
owing to the injudiclous course OF the preceding
liberal Ministers and of the propaganda maintained
by the liberals and their press, the slaveowners
were excessively alarmed their slaves and planta-
tin, tIv ip
anxiety prevailed, and public opinion had COM
menced dangerous social revolution


In reply Vlscount de Itaborahy, president of the
Council declared that there very few abolition
lists who do not desire to slavery at once extn-
gushed but he believed that account of signify
ing profound transformation Of social life to effect
abolition, it becomes necessary to proceed very


ousy and slowly He greatly feared that precipitate
would be followed by serious disasters. He
however, assured the deputies that the government
ready to facilitate hasten the solution of this
the Minister of Justice who defended the Dezeseis
de Julio and maintained that the question Of eman
cpa5ion should not be takeu from the sphere OF pr-
vate philanthropy.


SENIOR ARANJO LIMA said the President OF the
Councils declarations meant nothing but prOcrasi
nation, but abolition was inevitable and they could
not trine forever with the eternal prime pies OF
religion, morality and right which were involved
in 1t. The question had been studied for
u
memoir on IT. and as for inopportuneness, II 1t were
delayed until the effects OF the war were over it
would be inopportune for very many years. II the
Cabinet was opposed TO emancipation at anytime it
should say plainly and not use prorastinating
sophistry. II 1t favored abolition, let 1t make O
beginning by bringing in bill to declare all snDse.
quent births free leaving the freed children to the
master until maturity.


On the 23d the eInancpationists returned to the
charge. SenOr Texetra, Jr., moved that o commits.
sion be appointed to report plan and measure TO
initiate gradual emancipation. Senior Arrange Lima
introduced bill to declare all births Free but giving
the owners the right to the services until OF age
with other provisions favorable to slaves
Senior Perdgam Malheiro also introduced
number Of bills, one to the sama effect another
to allow slaves to hold, will and inherit property
one subject1ng them to the ordinary criminal
law and punishments, and others to free the mo-
nastic slaves and the slaves Of the nation and to
facilitate the means OF becoming free. Besides the
above, Senator 6lveira da M0tta Is to bring In q
comprehensive bill to provide for the abolition OF
slavery In twenty or thirty years. There is doubt
ated this sesston and though looking at the consi
tuition Of the Senate and the Deputies II is not likely
law will be passed, the Legislature viii be forced
to commit itself to an abolition policy or this the

Mcdonald Cheek Is the name OF young man OF
good family. but bad personal character, who CON-
mitted most cold bloOded murder in the vicinity OF
Aurora Indiana, on the 6th OF the present month
and is now In danger OF having summary justice
dealt out 10 him by the enraged people IN that neigh
borhood. The victim or his revenge was Mr. Thos.
Harrison. well-to-do and highly respected farmer,
residing short distance from Aurora, and the ex-
citement over the affair is almost great through
out the state as that over the celebrated Clem case
The circumstances OF the aair about AZ follows,
az stated To US by relative oil the deceased:--
Cneek commenced paying his attentions TO lIarr-
sOn's daughter about four years ago, but his suit
was not encouraged by Harrison on account OF his
worthless character This action on ine part OF tho
farmer however, did not seem TO be approved by
his daughter, after the usual coursnip parties
were united IN the holy bonds Of matrinony. She
had received sum OF money as bequest from her
deceased grandfather. Thomas Kyle and "" was not
a long time after the marriage before her husband
began to follow the natural incnatons OF his char
acter and drew heavily upon his wife's patrilnony


Tor the purpose or indugilg his passion for disspa
tion. Mr.. Harrison nterfered at this juncure-
treated his sOn-in-law with the greatest Kindness,
and endeavored by every means available to reform
and make man of MIN. But his benevolent inten-
tons met with no good result, and the welded pair
separated several times on account Of Cheeks mis-
conduct. The last separation occurred about q
month ago, ut winch time Cheek made an assault
upon his wlie and cut her dress 10 pieces besides
lacerating one OF ner fingers.





feeling toward his father-in-iaw at whose door ne
appeared To lay all his troubles. On Monday, the
sth OF the present month, he started out in buggy
with man named Bailey, and drove along road
that leads past Mr.. Harrisons house. When within
short distance OF the residence his father-nl law
came driving along the road In ap opposite direc-
ton ana an altc rcaOn at once ensued between the
parties. The dispute grew in intensity, and was
named Doc Kyle Finally Cheek pulled revolver
from MS pocket and discharged tour OF It's chambers
at the unfortunate gentleman, Killing hm Instantly

boiical act the couple got INTO their buggy and
OF man named jacob Abdom Cheek remarked IN
an audible voice to his companion, Didn't do

Bailey replied, ""fes, only you didn't give him
en0ugh.' They also passed the residence OF their
ta vicnm and as they did so Cheek remarked to the
tnen coninaed their ride "" ,~' ~


The news OF the affair reached Aurora Lawrence
burg, and the surrounding country IN very short
time after MS occurrence, and steps were at once
taken TO secure the arrest OF the villain reward OF
$4,000 In all offered to his arrest,
and this golden bail had the effect OF placing every
BODY on the alert for the murderer Photographs Of
Cheek. taken about four years ago. were sent 10 dlf
fcrent places, containing brief statement OF the
facts In the case and the amount offered for his ap
IN sitting position land wth the butt end OF pistol
exposed to view, as 1t was carried inner coat
pocket, and the air OF Dravado that he has assumed
Ii said to be highly characteristic oil him.


For number or days the search was unsuccessful,
and Mr.. Frank X. DOrman, the Sheriff Of Dearborn
county, Indiana, In which county the murder was
committed, was constantly In receipt OF communica-
lions from city and village authorities, detectives


had spotted character Who 'ig heg co ay
toently supposed was the man sought after,

Indian, named Henry Bunlngton was
| however, destined to be the fortunate man. Hc had
followed clue for short time without success but
last Monday he came across the OBJECT of his search

Ind. and Immediately arrested him Cheek otierln9
no reSistaicet He was at once removed TO the
county jail, which IL situated In Lawrenceburg, and
| in which Bailey was also confined.


During the day OF the arrest Sheriff D0rman re-
ceived several mysterious mssve, warning him
that III case an attempt was made to take the pr-
soners from jai 10 be tried before The dreaded
Judge Lynch no resistance should be offered, or the
consequences wound fall upon himself and his assist
ants. He, therefore very judiciously made pre-.
force OF guards TO do duty at the jail That night,


and when darkness came on he had mustered a
| five deputies, the City Marshal and three police


men, with half dozen OF the most brave and


determined citizens OF his acquaintance. hi.

IL was well understood In the town that some Sur


ring scene might be expected at the jan that night,
| and crowds OF people began TO assemble as midnight


approached for the purpose Of witnessing the afIlr.
ABOUT twelve O'Clock the trouble commenced, and a
party OF over one hundred men, mostly mounted on
horseback and well armed, made their appearance
In the town. They at once proceeded to the Jail,
| and amld shouts OF ""IiaDg him - ""Bring MIN out y
&C., with the sgnincent display OF ropes the leader
OF the party demanded that the prisoner be turned
| over to them The crowd numbered among It's men,
bers some OF the most prominent citizens OF that
section OF the country and was made up Of delega-
| tiOns from within radius OF about SIX miles OF
Lawrencburg and from the town OF Petersburg Ky.
No masks were worn, and the greatest Indignation
toward the prisoner prevailed


Mr.. Dorman Determined, If possible, to paclfy the
would-be lynchcrs and To accomplish that purpose


ne made speech, advising them to desist from their
| present purpose and to allow the law to take It's


course, stating that IT. after trial had been had the
| prisoner should be acquitted, then would be the
proper time for such a demonstration. He was fol
lowed in q similar strain by ex-Sherin Arnold De
| putty Auditor Haynes and one or two other gentle.
men, and the leader OF the mob then asked his fol-


lowers whether they should follow MS advice or per
| sst In their design. The reply was not satsfac-
| tory one, and new leader In the person OF q no.
torious character named Pete Miller appeared upon
demanded the keys, and on being told that they had


been removed they produced number OF cr0wbars


orce an entrance The little posse OF oiiicers was
| equal to the emergency, however, and presented a
1rm front as the mob pressed on. The side steps
leading 10 the doors of the building were blocked
| with people whom the guards by main lOrce held


back, and It Is great wonder that no weapons were
drawn and brought into action.


| Sheriff Dorman now made another address to the


crowd urging the law-abiding portion to use their
| influence with the balance to prevent The breaking
open OF the Jail, and as the request was complied
| with by number OF persons and the guards still


held their own the courage Of the foremost OF the
| lynCnerS began 10 Wanc, anu tne three


dred persons assembled around the jail soon began


TO drop on singly and In groups. In about half an
! hour the majority OF the crowd had melted away
| and gone 10 their homes. but quite u number OF


people remained in the vicinity for a much longer


time, waiting dlke Mr.. Micawber) for something to


turn up IL appeared TO be the opinion OF the people


that, Cheeks friends wealthy and well versed


In the mysteries OF the law they would procure u
| change OF venue In the case, and, by shifting the


trial from county to county ultimately prevent JUS


tice being dealt out 10 him as he deserves, and 10
this feeling may the attempt to lynch him be attri-
| buted


The predicament Of the prisoners. as their fate
| was being discussed outside the jail may be imag
| med They were both closely confined, yet perfectly


aware Of the state OF affairs, and they were greatly
| terrified In consequence. Cheek IL rather a small
| man, with a beardess face, ana appears younger

ciOus smile turks In his face, and he does not look

the evening to furnish HIM with weapons oil defence
