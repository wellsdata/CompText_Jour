We took stroll day or two since through
portion Of the diggings in the neiglbor-
hood Of Virginia Flat, Lynchburg, and Gold
Hill. As large a mining population as we
knew to be dwelling near Oroville, we we're
unprepared to witness the plumber of miners
Within 50 close proximity to the town and
the extent Of their operations. It sl.auiI
be remembered that the ditch has been in
successful operation only about one year,
yet IN that short space Of time, the grounds
in the vicinity of Virginia Fiat. Carpenter 5
Flat, Robinson Hill, Lynchburg, Gold I'LL.
and in fact throughout an extent Of country
mile and half in width, and five or six
miles in length, have been thoroughly test
ed. Some estimate may be formed Of the
great amount Of labor that has been per
formed, by visiting these various places and
observing the works that have been and now
ara in operation, the shafts that have been
sunk, the tunnels that have been run, and
the acres of surface dirt that have been dug
up and washed


We believe none of the miners have ever
been successful in reaching the bedrock,
although a hard substance called by the
miners ""cement,' is found in many places
at depths varying from sixteen to thirty or
forty feet, on which deposite Of ''pay dirt
is lodged. From the many reservoirs and
ditchcs the ground has become saturated
with water, rendering it difficult to work
many of the deeper shafts, and precluding
the possibility of reaching the bed. rock
We have conversed with several Of the min
ers abaut the matter, and all agree in the
opinion that could the bedrock be reached,
stratum of dirt surprising in richness any
that has heretofore been discovered in the
ground above, would be found extending
throughout the whole of those localities be-
fore mentioned


All sorts of plans have been suggested for
draining claims of water among which are
force pumps, wind mills, and syphons, and
a correspondent in the Sacramento Union
suggests the use of the latter instrument as
a means with which to convey off the water
from shafts and other places that cannot be
drained by bitches or fumes There is no
no doubt of the practica bility of the syphon
in some places. Such claims, for instance,
as are situated near the steep bank of riv-
er or ravine could be drained in this man
ner, but where the claim is situated in a
fiat. level country like this, of course it
would not be available, the long leg of the
syphon having to be so placed as to be lower
at its end than the claim to be drained -
Wind mills may possibly be brought into
successful cperation, but we opine that the
only reliable, efficient means, is that offered
by the power of steam, and until steam en-
gines are put into use, we hardly believe
that the deeper dggings Of the bluff and the
flats can be worked advantageously"

Vile, by way of the river, is obstructed in
several places by brush fences and other i'm
pea;ments. We believe that it is public
highway, and as such should be cleared of
these obstacles. 1t is by for the best road
for winter travel, being through sandy
portion of country, while the road by way

On the 10th, nth, and 18th of April. ls4s,
great excitement prevailed in this District,
arising from the fact that a large number of
slaves had been stolen from the neighborhood
by certain white men in command Of a pirate
cal schooner, which had brought wood to this
city.


On Sunday, April l6, the steamboat Salem,
Captain Baker, and about thirty citizens started
in pursuit, and discovered the schooner Pearl,
lying in Corn6eld harbor, at the mouth of the
Potomac, on Monday morning. The slaves,
seyenty.seven in number, were asleep below,
and Edward Sayres, the Captain, Chester Eng
lish, and Daniel Drayton, (white men) were
also below. The Salem rang alongside, boarded
the Pearl, fastened down the matches, and Sc
cured the fugitives and kidnappers, before they
could resist and returned with them TO Wash
ington on Tuesday, the 18th of April. The
fugitiyes consisted of thirty-eight men, twenty
six women, and thirteen children. Seventy
four were from the District, and three from
Virginia.


The excitement was SO great upon the ar
| rival of the parties at the steamboat wharf,
that it was difficult to prevent the enraged
citizens from seizing the culprits and lynching
them on the spot.


In the Union of April Is, l84S, you will
find full statement of the above fact, with
the names of the owners Of most of the slaves.
The following record shows the action of
the Criminal Court in the case:
Criminal Court of the District of Columbia.
for the county of Washington.


March Term, l849.
UNITED STATES, VS.. Daniel Drayton
May 9Th. Convicted of transporting slaves
in 73 cases, and sentenced by the Court in
each case to pay fine of $l4O and costs, one
half Of the fine to the oa0ner Of the slave, ac-
cording to the Act of Assembly Of Maryland,
of 1896, ch. 67.


Ordered to be committed to the Jail of
Washington county, till fines and costs are
paid.


Same number Of cases vs.. Edward Sayers
and fined 500 and cost in each and commit
ted as above.


Test: JOHN A. SMITH, Clerk.


Great efforts were made by the Abo,ionists
to procure the release of the prisoners through
the clemency of the President, Mr.. Fillmore,
but without success, until after General Scott
was nominated. Then, when Mr. Fillmore
had nothing more to expect from the South
the Know-nothing party not having been origi-
nated-you will find the following entry relative
to Drayton and Sayers, viz
18th August, 1852. Discharged from Jail by
the President Of the United States Millard Fill
more.


Test: JOHN A. SMITH, CPk.
1t becomes of importance next to know who
was instrumental in procuring the release of
these wholesale robbers and pirates; and it is
to this want to call the particular attention Of
my Wing friends, who are losing their negroes
by the same means


Ifyou will turn to page 4S of q book published
by Ticknor and fields, Boston, entitled Recent
nhoa C
you will find the following:


""Argument Submitted to the President four
teenth Nay, 1852, on the application for the
pardon OF Drayton and Sayres, detained in
prison at Washington for helping the escape Of
slaves""


The argument occupies fourteen pages of
the book, and is introduced as follows:


""This case excited particular interest.
Messrs. Drayton and Sayres had already been
in prison more than four years, when Mr.. Sum-
ner applied to President Fillmore for their par
don. 10 this application, which was sustained
by petitions from other quarters, the President
interposed doubts of his right to exercise the
pardoning power in their case, but expressed
desire for light on this point. On his inuita-
tiop, Mr.. Sumner laid before him the following
paper. Shortly cfieroards the pardon ,cas
granted.


The application was made on the l4th of
Nay, prerious to the Whig Convention but
the pardon was not granted until the 18th of
august, phich 1as after Mr.. Fillmore had
been set aside and General Scott nominated.


wish my Wing friends to note one other
fact in connexion with this case, viz: That
there was requisition in the hands of the
proper officer, issued by Governor Smith, in
iS4S, for Drayton and Sayres; and that the
criminals were hurried out of the District to
evade the just demands of the outraged laws
of Virginia.


Mr.. Fillmore not only released the prisoners
from the fines and costs due the United States,
but also from that portion of the fines due to
the owners, and for aohich they haze a just and
righteous claim upon the Government

language in relation to trials generally in that
county 1t mi ght apply with equal force TO
other counties in the State.-AHa.


The Jury again failed to agree on the second
trial of this man. and his case was continued
until next term. 1t must be only the fear of
Judge Lynch that prevents the evii-disposed
from committing murder more frequently.
With Butte County Jury there seems to be no
such thing murder. Not long since, a man
near Wyandotte had some difficulty with n
negro, and five or six hours afterwards, in the
dead hour of night, he went to the negro's cab
in, run his gun through a crevce, and deliber-
ately shot the negro so dead that he never wig
gled. He was convicted of manslaughter, and
sent TO prison Tor two years. Another man ran
a knife between the shoulder blades of anotht
person, and afterwards stated that he meant to
kill him, and regretted that he had not Jury
condn't agree and the prisoner was discharged. :.
Now, IN all these cases the Jury undoubtedly
acted honestly and conscieniiousy in accor-
dance with their obligations but we would
suggest to Jurors that they pay strict attention
10 the evidence and the law as laid down 10y the
court, and our word for it, they will arrive at a
correct conclusion. Counsel in such cases. are
no part OF the court-ihey are hired for the
special purpose of specious reasoning and thew
care not whether their client is guilty; if he
pays well, their business is to clear him. Cour-
'esy demands that jury should hear him, and
admire his ingenuity. Duty demands that iury
should disregard the arguments of counsel
when not sustained by law and evidence They
should laugh at such reasoning If c, unset or
counsellors will continue TO chuckle over their
power 10 bambonzle jurors. On the next trial,
we hope to see Reisberg convicted Of something,

trial of this man, and his case was continued
until next term 1t must be only the fear of
Judge Lynch, that prevents the evil-disposed
from committing murder more frequently.
With Butte County Jury there seems TO be
no such thing as murder. Not long since, a
man near Wyandotte, had some diffitulty with
a negro. and FIVE or six hours afterwards, in
the dead hour of night, he went to the negro's
cabin, run his gun through crevice, and de-
liberately shot the negro so dead he never
wiggled He was convicted of manslaughter,
and sent to prison for two years. Another
man ran knife between the shoulder blades
of another person, and afterwards stated that
he meant to kill him, and regretted that he
had not, Jury couldn't agree, and the pris-
oner was discharged. Now in all these cases
the Jury undoubtedly acted honestly and con-
scientiously. in accordance with their obliga-
tions but we would suggest to Jurors that
they pay strict attention to the evidence and
the law as laid down by the court, and our
word Tor IL, they Will arrive at correct con =
clusion. Counsel, in such cases, are no part
of the court-they are hired for the special
purpose Of specious reasoning, and they care
not whether their client is guilty, if he pays
well their business is to clear him. Courtesy
demands that a jury should hear him, and
admire his ingenuity. Duty demands that a
Jury should disregard, the arguments of
counsel when not sustained by law and evil
dence. They should laugh at such reasoning
of counsel, or counsellors will continue to
chuckle over their power to bamfooze Jurors.
On the next trial, We hope to see Reisberg,
convicted of something, as we really believe
he ought to be, if it is nothing more than
bigamy"

...... One Of the strongest evidences OF cold
weather during the past winter was discovered
in water-pipe, on Girard avenue, near Six
teenth street, Philadelphia, few days ago.
The pipe was three inches in diameter, and
buried four feet three inches below the grade
Of the street, in gravel soil. When dug up
the bore was filed with solid ice. We are in
formed that such thing has never been known
to occur in this city during any previous winter.


...... The Maria Z. Smith, which was seized at
Boston, last summer, on suspicion of being a
SLAYER, and finally released, and sailed for Monte
video, has been captured and carried into Bahai,
having attempted to land 42O negroes brought
from Africa. She embarked 500 on the coast,
but 80 died on the passage.


...... 1t is stated that at the earnest solicta.
ton of many Virginians who have enjoyed the
rare pleasure Of hearing Mr. Everett's lecture,
he has consented should his health sustain
him, to revisit Virginia in short time, lin
which event he will lecture at Lynchburg,) ex-
tending his tour through several of the South
ern States. The proceeds of all his lectures
go the fund for the purchase of Mount Vernon.


...... Jute is an Indian grass extensively i'm
ported, especially into Liverpool, for the pur-
pose of being made into bagging for cotton
1t is manufactured from the raw material into
bagging which is sent to America; returns to
England covering the cotton; and is finally
sold to the paper-makers. 1t is proposed to
convert jute into paper from its original state


...... The English papers announce the
death, at Newmarket, of Frank Butler, the
celebrated race rider. His victories on the
turf include two Derbys and six Oaks, besides
host of minor affairs He was about thirty
seven years of age.
...... During last year there we're 5,6SS
marriages in the State of Kentucy. The
majority of matrimonial alliances were formed
during the winter months-December taking
the lead Most of the brides were between l6
and 20 years Of age, and most of the grooms
between 20 and %. Two ladies married at 70
years-one girl at II, and several uuder Is.
Three hundred and forty-six boys under 20
years of age were married during the year.


""I say, Bill, Jim's Gagged for stealing ""a
horse""


""Served him right. Why didn't he buy one
and not pay for it, like any other gentleman?""


...... Now we ask any one Of the fairest Of
our fair readers if this pair of quatrains is not
pretty? 1t is freely rendered from the German
of Otto Roquette. To our thinking, there is
nothing by Walter, Spencer or Ben johnson
more exquisite in its kind:


Oh would'si thou delye, my lady.


Within my deIth of eve


To see If there be hidden


Some pearl of rarest dyei


Oh! seek il there my lady,


And thou shalt find the best,


Thy image there reflected,


gem worth all the rest.


......A petition was presented in the Ohio house
of representative, recently in behalf Of the
""Western Anti-slavery Society"" praying for the
withdrawal Of the State of Ohio from the Union
The individuals who are dissatisfied with the
Union can easily withdraw from it; they need
not take their neighbors with them, who may
better appreciate its benefits.


...... Two expelled members of the Know
nothing party Of Lancaster county, Pennsylya-
MIA, have recently issued a pamphlet of some
thirty pages giving ""History of the Rise,
Progress and Downfall Of Know nothingsm in
Lancaster county"" Obituary notices of this
kind afford an instructive lesson.


In one Of the banks in the vicinity Of
Boston, says the Traveller worthy citizen
presented to the cashiera check for ten dollars,
receiving from that officer, as he supposed, two
five dollar bills As he reached the door ofthe
bank he thought he would look at his money,
and was surprised to find that be was in pos
session Of two FIVE dollar bills."

~ c.r,rsr,s sort was receivee. At the begin
= -hen everybody else WAS listening very at
~eptiyely. Mr.. Mason of Virginia, Mr.. Douglas,
~, Toucey and Mr.. ToOmbs took to writ
;.s letters with wonderful Industry, all
s~enipgly very intent upon the subject matter of
tAeir epistolary correspondence. They, hewever,
veooyered from their fit Of letter-writiag after
while, and became quite natural as the speech
went on. Then, again. quite number Of the
Pro slsyery men undertook at various intervals
10 show their indifference to the course Of Mr..
Summers argument, or their disapprobatiOn Of the
boldness Of his remarks, by talking in the Chamber
in such way as to compel the presiding officer
several times to call them to order. Once, indeed,
Mr. Sumner himself stopped, and called on the
Sergeant-at-Arms to preserve quiet. In this nall
way the antagonists of Mr. Sumner prefer to meet
and treat him. The interruptions, to be sure,
amounted to nothing; but they disclosed the spirit
of venomous hostility which Slavery everywhere
exhibits towards free speech. Ten miles from
this city in any direction Mr.. Sumner would
not be permitted to talk in the way he
did to-day without being a victim to Lynch
law. 1t is hard for the Slavery men to be decent
in conduct while listening TO sentiments which they
would not permit the expression Of at home with
out counsellng the doom of death upon the speaker
and for the utterance Of which his life would GER
tainly be taken without stopping for judge or
Jury. Indeed one Southern Senator to-day de-
clsred that if he could have his way he would hang
Sumner on the spot. Such is the miserable con-
ditisn of things in this Republic, and such the
violent antagonitm Of our system. 1t was impOs-
sible to help asking oneself while Mr.. Sumner was
hurDg his denunciations uponthe vilaines practiced
under its inspiration, Of what use is it to
sssail even the damnable proceedings of the con-
spiratOrs against Freedom in Kansas before this
body, so large q majority of which is composed of
the very high priests of Slavery Or why waste
time or breath In appealing to its members for
justice or even decency toward that devoted and
unhappy Territory What better is it than preach
ing against sin in the lower regions, or appealing to
the devil to set up Sunday y-school in pandemo
mum Why inyeglh against the ruthless, tyranni-
cal, and infamous efforts to make Kansas Slave
State to men who mean to see it baptized in the
blood and the FIRE of the deep desolatiOn of civil
conflict sooner than move one inch toward rescuiug
It from its invaders and oppressors' One casnOt
contemplate the question without feeling that the
battle must be fought another field. 1t is
before the people Of the Free States face to face
that the question Of Kansas and the story Of her
wrongs and the infinite turpitude of her betrsyers,
should be and must be presented aud considered.
And there ii should be determined whether the
proceedings complained of should be submitted TO-
IL the people Of the Free States shall say aye to
that then let them hug their chains and prepare
for that further debasement which will be at once
their due and their doom. But il they say no, then
let the energy of this expression of their determ
nation be so pronounced as to shake the pollution
from the skirts of every branch of the Government
The Free States can save themselves and save the
Territories if they will, But they also, and they
alone, can throw all away, install the Slave power
in seat from which even they cannot eject it,
and crown it King over South and North alike. 1t
is for them to say what they will do in this great
crisis Of the national fate.


OF course, Mr.. Summers speech is full, compre-
hensive, well rounded, and embracing every aspect
of the great question he discusses. What he has
not said to-day he will say tomorrow. He will
soon be followed by Mr.. Wade, whose radical
views are well known, but who is yet in no psrsc-
nlar in advance of the temper Of the times. Ohio
has in him spirit worthy of the hour which hangs
over the nation. s. p.

it in my shirt pocket, started homeward

ANOTHER Confidence MAS's ADVENTURES.
""A correspondent of the Lynchburg Virgin
ian, writing from Norfolk, gives the following
account of the doings Of a Colonel Prosper,
who visited that city some weeks ago.


The Col, began by assiduously courting
all sorts and conditions of the people To
the man of business he was man of busi-
ness; to the man of pleasure, man of pleas
ure; to that class who, of all others, find the
first place in the affections of hero, he was
devoted (for, be it known to you gentle read
ers, he passed as a widower) in his attention
and most liberal in his gifts-here ring, and
there pin; here cuff, and there a muff.


To those who had property to sell he was a
liberal bidder and buyer To clerks, and
those who would be clerks, he was a most
magnificent patron, engaging them at high
figures; and in some instances advancing
them a portion Of their salaries; and, with
disinterestedness beyond paralel in these
degenerate days, encouraging and promoting
matrimonial schemes Of his attaches


Now, reader, hear the deno1ment of this
story: The Col. wanted to make raise
lie bought storehouse at high figure
said he wanted to open wine and liquor
store upon grand scale; and of course left
our folks to infer that all his skirmishing
with the outpost was to attact liberal and
generous patronage OF course all this out
lay had to be provided for; all his presents
to be reimbursed him. all favors to be requit-
ed. To this end, he directed his attention to
one of the banks of the place, and generous
y give them, in exchange for their notes,
$4,000 Of forged drafts. Some $4,000 or
$1,000 Il do not claim to be posted to q
cent? he pocketed, took the wings of the
morning, aud has gone to parts unknown
Why he did not take all know not.





The following epigram is from one Of the
New York plpers:


""As my wife and |, at the window one day,


Stood watching man with monkey

Who was driving a stout little donkav"

Who was it-tohat faction was it, that forced
,Ja,aes Buchanan upon the South, as the can
didatc Ct this present sham Democracy If
The ballotineS at Cincinnati are referred to- il is
seen that the delegation from, the South, went,
almost en- masse, during the whole series of
ballotings, down to their final snrrender,)
against James Buchanan! IL the Southern
journals are referred to, Of dates anterior to
the nomination, it is found, that, with an
almost unparalleled ,unanimity, they were
AGAINST the nomination of James Buchanan !
If these Southern journals, of dates imme-
dately after the nomination are referred to, it
is also found that either'open avowals of dis
satisfaction, or low murmurs Of half smothered
discomfort were uttered If the correspond
cnce of the various editors of Southern presses,
during the sitting Of the Cincinnati Conven-
tion be examined, it is found that the nomina-
tion of James Buchanan was predacted, as a
concession, to The Frse-soil Democracy Of the
Northh ,.r, a.aan&


Docs any man deny either one of these posi-
tions2 Will the Washington Union, or the
""faithless phantom of STAR"" both Of which
presses labored zealously, continually, bat in
offectuany, to bolster up the claims of Frank
pierce-will either of these presses deny these
positions? Will the Richmond Enquirer,
which published in it's columns on the 9th day
Of Nav, letter from Charles Irving, Esq, one
of the leaders Of the Virginia Democracy, (and
subsequently appointed Buchanan elector,
and who resigned the position,) assigning
strong and irrefutable reasons why Buchanan
could not carry the South, will that press
deny these positionss 1t cannot deny them
It is true, and it stands proved by the refer
ences we have made, that Mr.. Buchanan soas
nominated as a aconce8sson to the Frse-so't De-
zaocracg of the North. Hear what Mr. Irving
saws, in his letter published as above in the
Richmond Enquirer, viz:


eff silence, during the battle, constitutes a
claim for office, how can the South expect North
ern statesmen to uphold her banner when Aboli-
tionists are seeking to tear 1t to tattersY Z II an
ability to get Free-sol votes makes candidate
available and that species of availability is recog
nised as merit at the South, Northern statesmen
ehould court Free-soilers, and not struggle with
them if they wish to be Presidents Such avail
ability may be very desirable to those who wish
success alone; but those who look to the interests
of the country may well be excused II they prefer
a different standard. / certainly prefer that the
South shall prefer the selection, not only OF a
sound man. but that she shall vote for the nomi-
nation of no man upon any such ground OF
availability The coming election must settle the
slavery agitation. / do not wish single Free
soiler to vote the Democratic ticket, nor will /
willingly afford them the slightest excuse for so
doing. A prominent Northwest Democrat told
me to-day that the nomination OF Mr.. Buchanan
would enable Trumbull Wentworth, and other
Free-soilers, to come back into the party. am
not anxious to get back such characters. These
are some of my reasons for not preferring Mr..
Buchanan


Thus spalze Charles Irving, the editor of the
Lynchburg Republican, few days prior to
Buchanan's nominaton-dnd his reasons re-
main Ia full force, though he himself may
now swallow Old Squatter Sovereign !'-
Does this letter throw any light upon the ques-
ton. sohat faction forced James Buchanan
upon the South as a candidate2 Has the NOM
nation, or has it not enabled the Free-soil
Democrats of the North to come back into the
sham Democratic partyp Where stands Matty
Van BUREN, Where stands ""Prince John""
Both regularly reinstated in full communion
with the Buchanan Democracy; the ""Prince"" ""
proclaiming, and offering reward, to any man
who viii show that he has in any respect
changed in his opposition to slavery


Noo, if all these evidences shall fail to con-
vince the South, that the nomination of Bu-
chanan was made for the purpose of concilia-
ting those ""Free-soil leaders Of the NORTH
who, in 1852 were promised their share of the
""loaves and fishes"" by the Washington Union,
and who have received, under Forney and
Pierce, what they win have just right equal.
ly o.claim under Foney and Buchanan, then
we ask the South to peruse the letter Of Col.
Thomas Hart Benton, addressed on the 10th
instant to Governor Price, of Missouri, and

show the power of an American training,
even upon the rawest of British-born subjects
who enlist under the stripes and stars:


."" In 1S48 the frigate United States was
lying in the Bay of Gibraltar, and the usual
civilities were passing between the officers of
the ship and those of the garrison. At one
Of the dinner parties conversation turned up
on the various smallarms In use, and Com
modore Read spoke of the American carbine
in terms of high praise. Few of the British
officers present had ever seen the weapon, and
general request was made that an opportu-
nifty might be afforded Of witnessing its efR-
cheney. The Commodore readily complied,
and all appointment for the next morning
was made.


Orderly Sergeant Shaw was instructed TO
select man and weapon for the trial, and
he directed private Lynch to be on the spot.
They found quite party of British officers
in waiting, who examined the weapon and
made various inquiries respecting it of Lynch,
whom they soon discovered to be son OF the
Emerald Isle. The trial began A small
China cup was placed on a post at distanse
Of thirty yards. Lynch loaded his carbine,
brought it deliberately to bis shoulder, fred,
and the cup was in atoms A second, third,
and fourth experiment had the same result
The English officers expressed their eratiA-
cation and astonishment by loud cheers. and
one of them asked Lynch if he was lot an
Irishman2


II am by BIRTH SIR was his reply.


How long have you been in the Amer
ican servicel""


About six months, Sir"" said Lynch.
The officer gave him a sovereign; aid,
turning to his brothers, said: Here is an
Irshman who has been in the American Ma
Wy but six months, and III wager hundred
pounds he can do what not one of his coun-
trymen in the British service can. The Of
fcers expressed their thanks to Sergeant
Shaw for bis attention, and proffered him
five pounds as a slight expression Of their
satisfaction. The Sergeant drew himself up
to his full height, and said:


Il thank you, gentlemen, but non-com-
missioned officer of the American Navy nes-
er receives presents on duty""


I'm wager another hundred pounds"" said
the British officer again, there is not SER
geant in the English army or navy would
have done that""


The officers of the garrison were much
gratifed; and it would be difficult to decide
whether the gallant Commodore was more
pleased with the skill Of private Lynch or
the nice sense of honor displayed by Sergeant
Shaw.


A few days afterward, Captain de Lacy,
of the garrison, inquired of passed midship-
man Brook, ""How they Americanized Irish
men so rapidly""


q No trouble at all, there is an atmosphere
breathed under the American flag that makes
every man an American who served under

DESPERATE ADVENTURE OF TWO STATE PRrsoy",,"DESPERATE ADVENTURE OF TWO STATE PRIsoS
CoNvIors.-The San Francisco Globe, of Wednes-
day, contains the following statement:


A most daring and successful plan for escape
was devised and putinto execution by two con-
victs at Point San Quinten, on Saturday last.


They were at work near the extremity of the
Point, but directly under the supervision of the
armed sentinels. A sail-Doat and a. small row.
boat were moored on the beach. The wind was
blowing very strong and dead on shore. 1t ap-
pears that the idea suggested itself TO the minds
of the two prisoners, that if they could obtain
possession of the roy-boat, they might possibly
effect their escape, as the wind being dead ahead
of a vessel outward bound, the sail-hoat would
not be able to follow fast enough to oyertake
them. The greatest danger they had to~appre-
hend was from the shots of the sentinels and
from the contents of two pieces of cannon bear
ing directly upon the course they would be
obliged to take. But there was but little to
choose between death and the chance of esca-
ping from years of hard toll and imprisonment;
so waiting until the signal was made for the
prisoners to go to dinnet. sthey sprang. into the
boa' and pulled at the oars with the energy
that men under such circq@pstances only are ca
pabe of -slsI


The movement was almost Instantly observed
by the guard, who discharged their firearms at
tiAS AuS SlNAfNS1 )ub NltHOub thcCi. lHc guns
were then brought to bear upon the boat, and
fred, but the shot oveneached, and the fugi-
tives still straning every nerve at the oars,
were soon out Of reach of the guns The fugi-
tives made landing at Contra Costa, and en-
deavored to secrete themselves; but by some
fatality one Of them, Mexican named Burgan-
dy, convicted in Nappa county Of attempting to
commit murder, and sentenced to fourteen
years Imprisonment, was recognized by one of
the jury that convicted him. and although they
succeeded for time in keeping out of sight,
the person who recognized the Mexican took
means to procure their arrest, and they were
brought over to this city yesterday, in charge
of three residents of Contra Costa, and will be
returned to their old quarters at Point San
Quenten to-day. The other convict is named
Thomas Lynch; he was convicted of highway
robbery in Yuba county, and sentenced to five
years imprisonment. They had served but
few months of their respective terms, and now
they Will have a few years added."

The fraitors aud rebellionists at Law
ence. and some few other places in the
Territory, are still at their work Of organ
izing another government. From all we
have been able to learn, they did not at
tempt to hold elections for governor and
other officers, at but few points outside Of
Lawrence.


The fate OF the Territorial Register at
Leayenworth. seems TO have produced a
COOL effect in that region; and Kirkapoo
has bocone name of terror to negro
thieves. Kickapoo is entitled TO much
credit Tor the wholesome influence she has
exercised over her ncighbofing town, Leav-

We are no, much troubled in our imme-
diate vicinity. 1t seems the very name
A,ch;son sickens an atolirionist; but we
are informed that in. the western part Of
oar county there is nest o! traitors call
lag themselves Tree white State men, who
are paving, the way to a hemp cord and
swinging linb, somewhere on the waters
Of the Stranger. .


AT the town Of Atchison. we are never
honored with even speech from any
OF lEese renegades, and as for an cleo
ton here, it is the last thing they think
Of. We still have materials sufficient
for RATS, and expect to keep on hard
a constant supply. The papers at Law
renee are full of bcas,ing at the victo-
~ they gained over the pro-s!avery par
ty, which were called there by ,he Gov
ernor 10 the relief Of Sheriff Jones, which
shows. that the leniency OF our PEOPLE has
had no good effect at Lawrence; hut their
elections show that those OF their party,
outside OF Lawrence, are becoming alarm
ed, and if not stimulated to acts OF treason
by the ring eaders a, Lawrence. and in
tie Northern States, they might IN time,
by associating with our People, become
honest men, 3 nd make good citizens. And
these things 60 TO prove, fl.at while indut-
gence and kindness may operate fayorahly
upon tie ignorant dupes to fanaticisin, the

filed with wild whirlwinds, defeaning the

mingled all the while with the sweet under
song of the softest cadence. His face was
red as drunkards, his countenance looked
haggard like that of maniac; and ever

drew picture of murder in such appal-

might be considered beautiful. He painted
the slanderer so black that the sun seemed

an accursed monster,-and then he fixed
both portraits on the shining brow of Hop

Neutrality OF the ss swashingt Unfon'-
its paternaI care OF MIR. Buchanan, and


total neglect OF such outside candidates


As Pierce, Douglas, Hunter, &c.


| How is it, that when the Chicago Times per-
verted Mr.. Buchanan's letter to Senator Slidell,
the Union failed to rebuke that journal for its
indiscretion? Does it intend to neglect Mr..
Douglas in its high office of neutrality? Could
it not discover that he might ""be made to suf
fer by the mad zeal of so indiscreet friend Z""
When the Boston Post, the quasi organ of the
port, disparages Mr.. Buchanan's position, the
Union neglects to perform its high duties of
neutrality When Mr.. Pryor, Of Richmond,
issued his pamphlet, perverting the sentiments
and detracting from the merits of Pennsylya-
MAS candidate, and circulated the document
by thousands, the Union, with all its preten-
sion to fairness, could not even dissent from
the insidious and unjust assault upon MIR.
Buchanan. Did it not occur to the Union that
this was great indiscretion on the part OF
friend of Mr.. Hunter, and might excite hos.
tility to the latter gentleman? Are not the
interests of Mr.. Hunter within the jurisdiction
Of the Union's neutrality? The Union's pur-
view should have extended further, if il de-
sired to be considered Just. The Fredericks-
burg Recorder speaks for Mr.. Hunter the
Southside Democrat for Pierce and Hunter
the Lynchburg Republican for Hunter and
Douglas-the Richmond Enquirer for Pierce
and Hunter-the Mobile Register for Pierce
the New Orleans Delta for jefferson Davis
and Douglas-the Baltimore Republican for
Pierce-the Ceaveland Ploindealer for Doug
las--the Washington Star for Sydney Webster
nd Cal Gpo he no,,
for Guthrie--although every one of these have
been guilty of indiscretions, yet not one word
of censure has the neutral Union deigned to
utter against either. The strong man alone,
and his fsiends were the objects OF the Unions
friendly supervision. This was cruel neglect
towards all the other candidates.


We do not intend to be ""unkind or illiberal""
to the Onion. We are deeply sensible that
holding the scales Of justice. is no easy task
Perhaps the Union has done its utmost to be
perfectly neutral; but we are utterly unable to
account for its keen perception of our indiscre
tions, while it has displayed such total oblvi
BUSINESS of the actions of those prefering other
candidates. Possibly we have misunderstood
the Union. Perhaps its real design is to pro-
mote Mr. Buchanans nomination. But then
the Union says it is neutral, and this forbids
the idea. Although Virginia gentlemen may
send the Union mutilated proceedings of a
County Convention, yet we are bound to be-
lieve that that journal is truthful. Although
the proceedings of the State Convention of Cal
ifornia was published in such form as to
leave the impression on the mind of the reader
that the delegates were not instructed for Mr..
Buchanan, yet this may have been all candid
and intended for the best, rs it is sometimes
| understood that it is bad policy to make can.
| didate too strong at the beginning. Notwith-
| standing the fact, that some weeks since, we
corrected the Union in the erroneous opinion
that the delegates from Pennsylvania we're in
structed to 60 for Mr.. Buchanan ''first, last
and all the time,"" it attempted, with great
complacency, to extricate itself from the
dilemma by interposing preliminary resolu
| ton to the proceedings of the Convention,
which directed that no man but a sincere friend
of Mr.. B. should be sent as delegate to Gin
cinnati. Even this presents no sufficient evil
dence that the Union is not exclusively devoted
to Mr.. B. 1t may have deemed it polite to
show that Pennsylvania aoould neuer girc up.
But we have no disposition to pursue the
subject farther. The Union has Herculean

ty of every true National Democrat to lay
aside all sectional prejudice and feeling what
ever,-to heal all dissension in our ra uks, and
to prepare for the coming struggle-that we
can enter the field with confidence of success
in the battle for principle against oppression


Resolved, That the Democratic tenets of
Estates Rights"" and mon Intervention"" are
of vital Importance to the perpetuity of our
beloved Union, and that we will maintain and
defend them among the most cherished prin-
ciples of our party.


Resolved. That we fully believe in the ca
pacity of the American people for self-govern-
ment, and deprecate any action, either thro'
Congress or the people, that will in the least
interfere with, or control the domestic insti-
tutions of any sister State or territory, so
long as they do not violate or cor fict with the
palladium of our liberties, our Federal Con-
stitution.


Resolved, That we fully endorse the action
of the brave guard of Seventeen in our State
Senate, believing that California is better un-
rpn tod in

to the contest, and manifested but little dis
position to make heavy bets on the success of
their respective candidates.

TsRMs nF sunscRIPrIoN:",,"An INoIDENr-An incident occurred on
Saturday, at the Arcade, adjoining cur Office,
which furnishes an admirable commentary up
nthe atrocious charges of the abolitionists Of
a total want of feelings Of humanity on the
part Of the Southern people. Passing through
the Arcade saloon, we noticed at one of the
auction stands negro girl up for sale, and
around q closely packed crowd that appeared
80 be deeply interested in what was going on.
Curiosity led US to pause and inquire what
was the cause of the apparent excitement. The
bids were going on IN very spirited manner,
and generally at an advance of only five dol
lars at a bid, and at every bid the eyes of the
crowd would quickly turn in the direction
whence the bids proceeded, the interest and
excitement being in the meanwhile upon the
increase. The girl, bright, intelligent mu-
latress, about fourteen years old, was evident
ly not Indifferent to what was tTanspiring.
There was no moisture in her eyes, but they
assumed an expression which indicated that
she felt some anxiety in regard to the result
of the sale, which is not generally the case.
As the bids reached near a thousand dollars
the excitement became intense, and, as that
figure was called, a spontaneous hiss was heard
from one end of the room to the other, followed
by vehement shout of Turn him outl''
'Turn him outh' A rush was made for the
door, the hammer had fallen, and the girl also
into the arms of-her mother, who had become
her purchaser!


The explanation Of it all was that the wo-
man had been freed by her owner, and had
earned money enough to buy her child, the
.mulatress in question, and being very valu-
able servant several persons were very anx
ious to obtain her, but all of them, with one
exception, had pledged the mother that they
would not bid against her, and they honora-
bly, kept their faith 1t was the conduct Of
this one, who was bidding against the mother
which so exasperated the crowd on this occa-
sion. The man made good his escape, fortu-
nately so for him, we think, as we heard sundry
expressions about ""lynchng"" ETC., as the crowd
came back to talk over the matter The moth
er was so much affected by the joy of having
obtained possession Of her child, that she
swooned away and was carried out of the sa-
loon.


We may add that the sale was succession
sale, and was not designed to be anything more
than nominal, and nobody intended that the
mother should be deprived of her child.


This incident, showing as it does the real
feelings, that predominant in the South when
the chord of humanity is touched,is worth more
than all the mock philanthropy which spends
itself in crude theory and cheap denunciation,
which has deluged the country and arrayed its
different sections in bitter hostility against
each other in modern times ~ @. Bulletin.

suits from toe constant and intense use of these
sensitive organs, we were led to make trial of To-
biass and improved discovery for the eyes, whose
name heads this article. We saw them recommend

Dear Sir-In the last is.
sue of your usually fair ard independent
paper, find two very great erfsr., to
call them by no har.her names. You
say that the last slice the legislature has
taken of of our end Of the county, as
near az you can learn, fixes our Inns a.
Hamilton, which would leave Us about
fifty PAGES on this side of the river in
Butte County. New be it known to you
sir, that said line is at Mud Creek, about
thre. miles beyond Maj. Bidwells, leav-
lug US yet more tsrritsry than the great
State of Bangor, or Little Rhoda, or
both. And be it also known to you, sir :,
that within the aforesaid territory is en-
braced Butte Creek, West Branch,
Frsnch,own; Cherokee, Oregon, Morris
Rav.ns, Thompson's Flat, and divers
other places, with all the successful
Quartz Mills in the county, beside tho
two Table Mountains, which have proved
to be equally as rich in their deposits Of
gold, sosp, pan cakes and molas,es and
coal, as the celebrated Table Mountains
Of the Southern mines. see no rea-
son, as this is to ke & fee fight for the
county seat, why we should not present
our ella ms 10 the electors for the honor.
Having the county seat located at any
Of our towns would be no pa. ticular ad>

ia ns, YOU could raise a horse OF steer,

expense than YOU could chicken either

Orovile-common chickens st that, to
ssy nothing Of the great overgrown
Shanghais yon have for ne1. seor-ysrd
nsighbors. We think it rather unkind
in you also, to praise your Inverted
hat' Of a place by trying to disparage
US, by in,imating that We are covered
by Spanish Grants. It may bs tras that
our neighbors below, and across the river
are in danger of falling into the hands of
the Philistines, by having kind Of a
""Limantour"" trumped on them. But,
sir, do you suppose that US free Ansri-
can. aud miners, en- and around these
table mountains, after just discovering
their rich deposits, strapped. by waiting
a year at ether places l mention no
Names for water. that We woullbs afraid

ands of hard-g'azod rock piled up ready
for loading, with any quantity Of Flap
Jacks and molassss in the basin below,
with few bloody furriners with shela-
lahs as kind of reserve, that any grant
holder, agent, or even Gen. "" TOOL. would
venture within four miles of US to die

we presume not-we reckon not. But
to the pin.. Down here it i. currently
reported, and generally believe that
some clique or sanhsdrlm have entered
into an arrangement with one Of our cit
liens, that he is to carry all the votes
for Oroville, in consideration for whieh
he is to be made County Judge. Now
in short, We are opposed to all such bar
gains and sales, and no threats of future
punishment nor hopes Of reward, can
make US consent to have any county
Judge from this side of the river. We
spurn such ""powsrfal inhueness""


Give yourself no further uneaslness

Look out for Thieves.",,"We are informed that there has of late
been several robberies committed in town
and this immediate vicinity. Several pock-
cts have been picked in our hotels,and many
attempts have been made at petit larcency,
but so far, no arrests have been made.


A suspicious looking stranger was noticed
by Mr.. Kimmel of the National, at Lynch
burgh, and about the time his affairs were
about to be enquired into, he came up miss
ing, and that same night one Of the Board
ers had his pockets relieved of 50, another
of So ~.


At the Empire on the Fat above town, We
are told, that last night some scoundrel stole
and carried off a gold watch and small
amount of money belonging to some of the
inmates of the house.


There are some notorious vagabonds III
town, and unless our citizens citizens are on
the lookout, their residences will be robbed
of valuables by them, who have nothing else
to do but watch an opportunity.


This is the season for harvest with the
light-ingered gentry, and its about time
our citizen police made the acquaintance OF
some of them. 1t is particularly necessary
at this time that they should be on their
guard, as dangers threaten us on every
hand. OF this fact we are admonished by
the almost daily announcement of the des-
truction of towns in other portions of the
state: Again we say be Tigilant."

lity in the outer world, about the richness of the
mines in this vicinity. Many visit us and go away
without any satisfactory proof that this Is indeed the
0phir of antiquity There is a kind OF apathy in
strangers to pitch in and prospect, and thus many
leave us unsatisfied, who, did they only follow the
example OF the old inhabitants of the place, would
not only do justice TO Oroville but also enrich them
selves. In proof of this there is not one single mining
operation upon the immense fiat between oroville and
Lynchburgh Pike Hill, Carpenters Flat, or Robin
sons Hill, which has been properly conducted, which
has only paid wages after the style of '49 80,
but has, of our own knowledge enabled many to re-
turn to the home of their childhood, husbands to
their wives, fathers to their children, and lovers to
the arms of the dear ones at home. But few facts
will serve better to satisfy the incredulous; The
claim owned by Messrs. Boulliod, Cauchet & Co, of
the French Hotel, four in all, has to certain
knowledge, produced during the last week, the neat
sum of $1,000, and that with only man at the
suice Their claim is situated near the Cemetry, and
has been paying in this Manner for some time They
have still more dirt thrown out than they can wash in
two weeks and have men constantly at work to keep
up the same stream through their suice There
undoubtedly many more doing as WELL of whom
hear nothing. Indeed. should have remained ig-
and that we have the pleasure of being considered

only so he gets Office, it is heralded forth

trines, and hence they find II necessary
te smuggle their men into ofice, and
then clam u K. \. triumph! We
should suppose It would require some
""cheek"" for even a K n Editor to
claim the election in Tehama county as
K n. victory, even in the followin-
snsaking manner, ""Although polit os

The above extracts show in what light
the Know Nothings and Black Republicans
view our foreign born citizens. The Editor
of the Pathfinder, Black Republican paper
printed in San Francisco says that the only
thing that would induce the Germans to turn
out to a Democratic Meeting, would be pay
for playing Yankee tunes"" The dirty cur
who penned the above sIander knew he was
Icing when he done so. Our German pop
uation is composed of estimable, industrious
citizens and because they are honestly in
favor of Democracy is no reason why they
should be so foully sandered by the Bla k
Republican Abolition press.

Navy communicates to the Drawer an ad-
mirable incident to show the power of an
American training, even upon the rawest Of
British-born subjects who enlist under the
stripes and stars {:


'In ls4S the frigate United States was
lying in the Bay of Gibraltar, and the usual
civilities were passing between officers of
the ship and those of the garrison. AT one
of the dinner parties conversation turned
upon the various smallarms in use, and
Commodore Reed spoke of the American
carbiae in terms of high praise. Few of the
British officers present had ever seen the
weapon, and general request was made
that an opportunity might be afforded of
witnessing its efficiency. The Commodore
readily complied, and an appointment for
the next morning was made.


""Orderly Sergeant Shaw was instructed
to select man and a weapon for the trial,
and he directed Private Lynch to be on the
ground. They found quite party of Brit
ish officers in waiting, who examined the
weapon, and made numerous inquiries re-
specting it of Lynch, whom they soon dis
covered to be a son of the Emerald Isle.
The trial began. A small china cup was
placed on post at q distance of thirty
yards. Lynch loaded his carbine brought
it deliberately to his shoulder, fired, and the
cup was in atoms. A second, third, and
fourth experiment had the same result. The
English officers expressed their qualification
and astonishment by loud cheers, and one
of them asked Lynch if he was not an Irish
man?


'I am by birth, Sir, was his reply.


''How long have you been in the Ameri-
can service p


""'About six months, Sir was his reply.


""The officer gave him sovereign and,
turning to his brothers, said Here is an
Irishman who has been in the American Ma
Wy but six months, and I'll wager a hundred
pounds he can do what not one of his coun-
trymen in the British service can. The
officers expressed their thanks to Sergeant
Shaw for his attention, and proflered him
five pounds as a slight expression of their
satisfaction. The Sergeant drew himself up
to his full height, and said


""I thank you, gentlemen, but non-com-
missioned officer Of the American Navy
never receives presents on duty


""I1l wager another hundred pounds,
said the British officer again, there is not a
sergeant in the English army or navy would
have done that


""The officers Of the garrison were much
gratifed and it would be difficult to decide
whether the gallant Commodore was more
pleased with the skill of Private Lynch or
the nice sense of honor displayed by Ser
geant Shaw;


""a few days afterward, Captain de Lacy,
of the garrison, inquired of passed midship-
man Brook, How they Americanized Irish.

""'No trouble at all,' said Brook there

 It has been related to me since my letter to Thorrlngton, that all the federalists in the re- volutlonary war were tories. My father might have been tory for ought I know. In those days, 1 was foreigner, but, however, at any rate since he did give the tories hard names: there were three classes of these people, the first class joined the enemy, and fought against their country. The second was outlaws, and plunderers and robbers. The third would not stand their draft in fear of the hardships and danger that they would have to encounter in war, but was friendly and good citizens. have good reasons to believe that the federalists was not tories, because the elder John Adams was leading federalist, and he done more in legislation than any other man, and his voice had much influence over the minds of the pub- lie men of them days. Mir. Adams was ap- pointed commissioner with Ben Franklin and John Jay by the continental Congress to ratifv treaty for peace with Great Britain, he ac- compllshed his mission. The ratification oi the treaty was signed September, 17S3, which forever separated America from the mother country. Mir. Adams was also appointed by the continental Congress the first minister pleni- potentlary from the United States to the courts of London, England, i'll the year 1785, in the reign of his Majesty, King George lII

 Ben. Franklin was, l believe, federalist in politics, he was appointed minister plenipoten- tiary from the United States to the court of Versailles, in France, in 1769, in the reign of Louis, the treaty was soon agreed upon and the treaty of amity and alliance were signed at Paris, February, 1778. Franklin was abroad over eight years. He also was appointed a member of the federal convention to form the constitution of the United States of America. He has also been member of the continental Congress, and signer of the Declaration of the Independence of the United States, he was the oldest member he was at the time in hlS 'lst year, the youngest member was Thps Lynch, he was in his 27th year, and was cast away at sea in the fall of that year.

Lynch of Virginia, who apueass to hays been the man who introduced md gave name to that wild justice which U known in our country as Lynch Law""

 Capt Lynch, just mentioned, was the author Of the Lynch laws 90 well known and so fre- qusntly carried into effect some years ago, fir tho United States, h violation of every prin- clpls of justice aud juisprudence Mr. Lynch resided in Pittsylyania in the State of Virginia, when Dc commenced legislator and carried his system into effect. The detail had from him. self and is nearly q follows:

 The Lynch-men associated for the purposes of punishing crimes in summarx way, with ont the tedious and technical .fof{hs of courts of justice. Upon complaint being made by sny member of the association of crime being committed within the vicinity of their jurisdic- fion, the person complained of Was immediate ly pnrsued and taken, if possible. If appre- hended, he was carried before some member of the association and examined if his answers were not satisfactory, he was whipped till they were 90 Those extorted answers generally involved others in the supposed crime. who in their turn were punished in like manner. These pnnishments were sometimes severe, and not nnfrequently inflicted upon the innocent through spite, or in consequence of answers extorted under the smartng of the whip, to tue inter- 1r. Lynch informed me that he had never in sny case given vote for the punishment of death; some, however, he acknowledged, had been actually hanged, though not in the con- mon way g horse, in part, became the execu- ti0ner. The manner was this the person who t was supposed ought to suffer death, was placed on . horse, with his hands tied behind him and . rope about his neck, which was fastened to the limb of tree over hIs head.-- In this situation the person was left when the horse, in pursuit of food or any other cause, moved from his position, the unfortunate per. son was left suspended by the neck. This was called aiding the civil authority. It seems al- most incredible that such proceedings should be had in e civilized country, governed by ull- known laws it may nevertheless be relied on. should not have asserted it as fact had it not been related to me by Mr. Lynch himself, and neighbor, MT. Lay, one of the original as- sociation, together with several other Lynch men, as they are called. This self-created tri- bunal was first organized in the State of Vr- ginia about the year l776, from whence it ex- tended southward, as before observed

 Mr. Lynch has the appearance of an ancient athletic, and had he lived in the times of the Olympic games, would probably have figured lon the bloody arena"" He possesses Q stroag bat uncultivated mind, is hospita5le. and gener- ous in the extreme :; to which may be added great stickler for equality and the rights of man, as established by law So contradictory are tho ideas and eonductsso the only creatures supposed to be endowed with reason and iudg- ment in the universe."

The Company, failing to receive the stolen specie. paid over the amount to the treasurer, but did not at all releX their efforts to fer. ret out the thieves. The messenger, w. c. White by name, who had charge of the treasure during it's transit by night from Chicago to De. trolt resigned his office at the end of the month and came to this State Mr. Best, detective officer in the employ of the Company, after a few weeks investigation, was at last able to write to his employers that two men, Oliver King, who formerly kept hotel in Lowell, and Wm. c. Aver, formerly a broker at No. +, Brattle Square, in this city, had, through third party wo has also been arrested, deposited $500 in gold in the Haverhill bank, and from other circumstances not yet divulged, it is thought they were in connection with White.

 It was subsequently, ascertained that King whose previous property was we'll known, had made purchases of houses, horses, and other property, and seemed to be rolling in wealth. Upon receipt of this information, officer Best with two of the partners in the American Fix. press Company, Mir. Fargo and MT. Williams immediately stated for this city. Here they held a conference with the chief of police and other officers, and accompanied by Deputy Chief Ham, officers Savage and Lynch, they proceeded 10 Lawrence where King and Aver reside.

 Arrived at Lawrence, Mir. Ham, leaving the rest of his party at the hotel, went out to re- connoitre, and soon discovered Aver riding in one of his new v-purchaSed carriapns Paturp- ing to the house he met and arrested King at the very door; and after placing him in custody went in pursuit of Aver. lie soon captured him, and returned to the hotel. In a search of the premises and persons of these two men, silver plate gold bank bills to the value of nearly S2,2OO, were found in the possession of King whose financial transactions of different kinds, within the past few months, have amount ei to nearly S12,O0O. Aver has recently pur- chased half of a livery stable, and two or three valuable watches were found in his possession

 After a fruitess search for White in New Sa- em Lltchtleld, Manchester and other places, the officers returned to this city on Saturday, and found him here. The three were taken before the Police Court in the afternoon and re- quired to furnish bail in S15,O0O each to appear at the trial, Otis F. Lord, of Salem, and l'hos A.

To persons who have have had the sight of their
eyes SO impaired as to require the use of Glasses
would recommend Mr.. John Tobias as q suitable per-
son from whom to obtain such Glasses as they may
require he has suited me with pair of Spectacles
for far and sight. Ny sight has been impaired
very much by service of years in the Post Office
Department. which berth required me to be on duty
from o'clock at night till after day, during which
time used but one light.

After most careful examination of Mr.. ]. Tobiass
Glasses am enabled to testify that their hardness,
cearness polishing and exact optical shape, render
them particularly recommendable to those whose
merely optical impairment of the eyes in want Of
such auxlliaries. / consider, moreover, Mr.. Tobias
fully qualified to determine the focus of the eye both
by his optical knowledge and experience, and by
nlea Of his optometer. In addition, can further
state that Mr.. Tobias has supplied some of my pa
tents with Glasses, to their and my satisfaction.

istence has created and is now fostering in
community. No subject that has ever Agi-
tated the public mind, has been fraught
with so much evil, or given rise to such acri-
monious feelings, or excited the public mind
to such q pitch. Neighbors regard each
ether with perfect astonishment, and dis
trust and foul suspicion is engendered among
those whose intercourse has formerly evil
denced the most honorable feelings and
friendly relations.


The press, too, has felt the influence of the
mob at the Bay, and forget that their ap-
peals should be to the judgment of the peo-
pie, instead of their passions, and indulge
10 the most bitter and acrimonious feelings.
1t is almost impossible to open paper from
below, without reading the disgusting de-
tails o. lynch law execution, or the specu-
lations of mob editors upon the next victim
of the tyrants who now rule San Francisco
with the secret conclave and the bayonet, to
everlasting disgrace of our republican insti-
tutions. AS if to add fresh fuel TO the feel
ings already agitatiDg the State, the Allan
tic papers are now favoring the California
public with republication of their pro-
ceedings, and Casey and Cora have just been
re hung by the arrival Of the last Steamer.
Editors, who have remained tranquil during
the widest political excitements through
which the country has passed, have yielded
to the deleterious influence arising in San
Francisco, and given vent to their pent-up
feelings, in bitterness of language in strong
contrast with their former course. The at
mosphere is impregnated with lawlessness-
the times are demoralized-and the public
sense vitiated and perverted into unhealthy
channels. In proof of this, is the chronicled
fact that hundreds rushed to San Francisco
to witness the execution of the first Vigi-
lance victims. On tho circulation of ru-
NOR that some unfortunate individual is to
be hanged at q certain hour by the Vigi-
lance Committee, and men. women and chill
dren--old and young-hurry to the Vigi-
lance Bastile for the puopose of witnessing
the expected execution. The depraved
taste which seeks for its qualification the dy-
ing agonies-the throes and conyusions of
q fellow being hurried into eternity, is u
disgrace to humanity. When We fnd' wo-
men bringing their young children to feast
their eyes on the horrid spectacle-ladies in
their carriages with their lorgnettes ready
to be used to bring the object nearer-moy-
als, refinement and sensibility-in a word,
all the finer feelings of our Dature must be
at Allow ebb indeed.


The evil influences which this Vigilance
movement has scattered abroad, arising
from familiarity with blood, from the sight
| of thousands of armed men taking the law
into their own hands, or, rather, trampling
upon all law, and in the language of Jeho-
vah, saying Vengeance is mine"" will not
be erased till another generation shall have
passed away, and principles of right, rever-
ence for the law, and respect for the COM
mands of God, shall have rooted out the
memory of the lavless of the San Francisco
mob. The safeguards Of the people in their
persons, property liberty and lives, are the
constitution and'laws Of the land. ""These
are cast down from their high places in the
affection and regard of our citizens. and
trampled in the dust, and in their stead, we
have the uncontrolled will of committee of
twenty nine, enforced by three thousand
cleaning bayonets."" The committee have
fearful responsibility resting upon them.
""NOt mere physical responsibility and ac-
cOuntability, bata responsibility which. in
their calmef hours, when excitement, and
passion shall have passed away-when in
aiter life they shall sit down to reflect on
their past lives--when age. creeping on
apace, shall silver Ger their locks, and the
messenger Of death shall claim them for his
Own-theu. when their own souls shall sit
in judgment on.their acts, will they feel the
weight of that moral respoasi bility. which
will weigh thsm down with a repentance
which We trust may atone for all""

telegraph has given assurance for nearly
a week that the attempt of the assassin
had failed to accomplish its object, and
that he who had been singled out as a
victim, would be spared to his family,
to his friends, and to scourge from pub
lie sight the rascality and corruption
that had appropriated our young State
to its own purposes. But e'er week
had elapsed, the telegraph again vibrates
with the sad intelligence of his death,
and the important announcement that
MS assassin was in the hands of a vigi-
lance committee and would be summarIly
dealt with.


We are not the advocate or the apol-
ogist of Lynch law. We sho uld rather
see men render their influence and ser
vice to sustain the laws, by devoting an
occasional day in the capacity of jurors,
than forming vigilance committees, and
taking even the blAckest # criminals
from the hands of the law. We are not
yet prepared to make so dangerous and
improper use IF the press, as to rec
ommend the application Of the fearful
code. There is no assassination so ma
lignant, no crime so bold, but the law
properly and fearlessly administered,
will reach it. The proper administra-
tion depends upon the people. Who
amongst US is prepared to set aside the
guarantees of the constitution under
which we live; Are we prepared to
admit by taking the law into our own
hands, that our system of government
has failed, and that the ballot-box is no
longer the bulwark Of our freedom ?


1t is true that in the present case the
assumption by the psople of the most
solemn responsibilities, although it can
not be justified, is extenuated by Sc
ries of wrongs, expressions and spolia
tions, unparalleled in the history of So
ciety in the U. S. Outrages the most
gross have been unblushingly perpetra-
ted in open daylight, and in the face Of
the constituted authorities. San Fran
cisco has been the scene OF a thousand
homicides, and of but two convictions
by due process of law Professional
gamblers and hardened villains have shot
down respectable men with impunity,
and the courts have failed to convict,
either through their own corruption or
ineficiency. The talents of ex-Con-
grsSsmen, Iured by the money of prosti-
tates, has been exerted in defence of
assassins, gamblers and thieves. No

Some place other than Bidwell must have
majority Of all the votes cast, to effect a re-
moyal Of the county seat


So far | agree with the gem of the foothills;
but when B. B. g., alias Uphir, alias Oroville,
claims exclusive advantages and to have been
the first to set the ball in motion, and to have
furnished all the means to defray the expenses
OF q log-roller in our Legislature-they talk
too much. 1t is an sundeniabe fact that. one
Of the citizens Of Lyuchburg, procured the
names of some SIX CT eight hundred voters OF
Butte county, and delivered them to the dy
nasty Of Oroyile And one of our citizens
procured subscription in Lynchburg Of some
sixty or eighty dollars, when the sum requir-
cd by their Minister was only one hundred
dollars So much for her additional claims
on the dear people for their suffrages. They
are attempting to soft-soap, or honeyfuggle
the vo.ers of Thompson's Flat, by giving them
81 litsle putf-but it is no go. There are now
in my room two citizens IF Thompson's Flat
who assure me that their vote will be divided


Sir. Editor-It would be treat to those
who have not seen our town, and our spacious
plaza, shaded by huge evergreen oaks, to Wis
ii US. The location is high and dry--the alti-
tude being about oEe hundreei feet above that
great city which has sprung up like a mush-
room Of nights growth-with nothing under
Heaven to support it save the mines of Lynch-
burg and--yes the STEAMBOATS,.


The Feather River Ditch il running through
our town with az abundant supply Of pure
mountain water. There are also two large
reservoirs within convenient distance, where
all who desire cold bath can enjoy that lux
ury


l am credibly informed that during the
months Of June and July last, there was a
difference Of five degrees between this place
and OIoyille-the latter place being that
much the hottest,


We labor under some disadvantage here a.
regards our vote. Many Of our miners be-
came tired Of wasting for water and left. and
unless they learn that there is plenty of wa
ter here, We will not be able TO poll over six
hundred votes; bat l hope that they may hear
the tidings and return in time to 1ender aid in
the good cause.


Now. word to you Bidwellites I know
you'll die hard. The people have got in their
heads that the comfy seat must be removed,
and move it they will--if not this year, per
haps the next-anl | am sure you had rather
see 1t here than at that bank of gray sand
near the ferry. Come 60 with us Our doors
are always open to true believers.


Yours,

to the county seat, aud vote for Lynchburg .


Mr. EDIroR:--The prospects are now very
favorable that she will display her disinter-
ested beneyolence, and do So | think the
conviction is becoming quite general among
the rirtu0si and sardRS Of that town, II not
among the popuii, that it would be best for
them to cast their votes fer Lynchburg.


1t has been repeatedly stated by their most
influential men, that if they could be convinced
that Lynchburg had as fair chance for an
election as 0rovile. they would most heartily
90 in for it, And they are now. sir, in CON
dition most unhappy, for it is an unpleasant
situation, when men are struggling against
the clearest convictions Of their own judg-
ments. When these declarations were made,
the individuals who uttered them little
thought that they would be so soon compelled
to confess that Lynchburg had better pros
pect of being elected as the county seat than
0rovile


The philosopher who reflects upon the varia-
! bleness Of the elements of society, is astonish-
ed to see how breath of correct public opin-
ion may come sweeping over the face of so
ciety, and change at once the entire aspect of
things. There is not probably any case where
truth has produced a revolution so sudden up
on the public mind as in this instance And
what is most remarkable is, that Oroville, with
her interests, prejudices prepossessions, pride
and principles, should be subject to such a
sudden revolution. But, sir, strange US it is
it is no less strange than true. Look out W
there, for the next you may hear is that Oro-
Vile has pledged herself tooth and nail to &c
for Lynchburg.


Lynchburg is the flag city and no mistake
Don't shut off the light up there.

throughout the comfy. We re-publish
it for we believe it will be read with in
terest by al vino desire the welfare OF
the county.


The voters Of the county should re-
member that in voting for Oroyille they
vote to abandon the only route through
Butte to the upper country, aud thus
surrender the trade aud travel Of Plu-
mas to Sierra County, and this too,
while we have the shortest and most ac-
cessible route.


Persons residing in the valley, and
who own real estate, should remember
that their property comprises a large
proportion of the taxable property OF
the county, and whatever indebtedness
the county may incur by removal will
fall principally upon them. And they
must remember that removal cannot
be effected without plunging the county
in debt, to be paid with interest by the
taxable property of the county. Do
men in the valley portion of the county
who have titles in fee to large tracts Of
land, and who viii be obliged to pay
tax upon the same, desire to see the
county compelled to erect buildings and
have their lands become liable for the
cost.


1t should be remembered by the vo-
ters of the county, that, should 0royille
receive a majority Of the votes cast, it
gou be the county seat under the law,
whether O.oville should choose to erect
buildings or not, and that, notwithstand-
ing the citizens of Oroville have an
nounced their determination to erect
buildings free Of expense to the county,
yet such announcement is not fally Gu
titled to public confidence, for the rea-
son that some who have thus expressed
their determination to donate buildings
to the county, are actually in debt to
the Hotels and Saloons in Bidwell for
the necessaries and luxuries of life-il
board and whisky may be considered
such necessaries and luxuries. Doubt
less some have signed said announce
ment in good faith; those who have
done so will find themselves compelled to
bear the burden


As evidence of deception in this mat
ter on the part of Oroville, we refer to
the fact that while the North Californi-
an solemnly asserts that the election
will not be attended with any expense,
it is charging the county two Or three
hundred dollars for services rendered
concerning the election.


Lynchbnrg, Wyandotte, Forbestown.
Thompson's Flat, Spring Valley and
Frenchtown, shoald remember that this
election for county seat has heen urged
on with haste by interested parties in
Orovllle, in order that they might fore
stall other mining localities, and secure
the county seat before other localities
can compete with them, and that too.
while relying upon other places for sup
port


Oroville is on no direct line of travel
through the county, and the travel and
business of the county can never be
turned through Oroville, any easier than
it can through Forbestown. Let the
voters take this matter into considera-
ton, and they cannot fail to see that the
present location is the most favorabl.
one to majority of the people of the
county


The people Of the county should re
member that the county seat was taken
to Hamilton, as it IS now .ught to be
removed to 0roville, for the purpose Of
speculation in town lots-and that the
removal to Hamilton created a thirty
five thousand dollars debt, which th5
taxpayers have about succeeded in pay
ing off with heavy interest.


Butte County scrip Is now at par, and
spectators desire to dabble it, and they
desire to see the county again plunged
in debt, now that she she once demon
strated her ability to meet all demands
against her Let the voters of the
county on Saturday next, lace their
veto upon this spirit of speculation.


One of the principal arguments made
use of in opposing Bidwell as the coun-
ty seat, is the oft repeated assertion
that is ''Bidwell Clique"" At least
two Know Nothing Asses have ridden
this hobby into Office, and if there ever
was such a thing as ""Bidwell clique, .
it should have died from modification at
seeing the miserable specimens of hu-

on Saturday, at the Arcade, adjoining our
Office, which furnishes an admirable COM
mentary upon the atroeious charges of the
Abelitionists of total want of feelings of
humanity on the part of the Southern peo-
pie. Passing through the Arcade saloon,
We noticed at one of the auction stands a
| negro girl up for sale, and around a closely
packed crowd that appeared to be deeply
interested In what was going On. Curios-
ity led us to pause and inquire what was
the cause Of the apparent excitement
The bids were going on in a very spirited
manner, and generally at an advance OF
only FIVE dollars at a bid, and at every bid
the eyes of the crowd would quickly turn
in the direction whence the bids proceeded,
the interest and excitement being In the
meanwhile upon the increase The girl, a
bright, intelligent mulatress, about four
teen years old, was evidently not i, differ
ent to what was Transporting There was
no moisture in her eyes, but they assumed
an expression which indicated that she felt
some anxiety In regard to the result of the
sale, which is not generally the case. As
the bids reached near a thousand dollars,
the excitement became intense, and as that
figure was called, spontaneous hiss was
heard from one end of the room to the
other, followed BY vehement shout of
'.Turn him cut !"" .'Turn him outr' \
rush was made for the door, the hammer
had fallen, and the girl also into the arms
of-her mother, who had become her pur-
chaserl' The explanation of it al was that
the woman had been freed by her owner,
and had earned money enough to buy her
child. the mulatress in question, and being
a very valuable servant several persons
were anxious to obtain her, but all of them
with one exception, had pledged the mo-
ther that they would not bid against her,
and they honorably kept their faith 1t
was the conduct of this one, who was bid
ding against the mother, which so excited
and exasperated the crowd on the occasion.
The man made good his escape, fortunate
ly too for him We think, as we heard sun
dry expressions about ''lynching,' &C., as
the crowd came back to talk over the mat
ter The mother was so much affected by
the Joy of having succeeded In retaining
possession of her child, that she swooned
away and was carried out of the saloon.


Wemay add that the sale was success
sion sale, and was not designed to be any
thing more than nominal, and nobody in
tended that the mother should be deprived
of her child.


This incident showing as it does the re-
al feelings that predominant in the South
when the chord of humanity is touched, Is
worth more than all the mock philanthro-
py which spends itself in crude theories
and cheap denunciation, which have delu-
ged the country and arrayed its different
sections in bitter hostility against each
other in modern times

preston that the contest for the county
seat, is a single handed one between
Bidwell and Oroville; but the advocates
of this presumption fail to substantiate
their position with anything like evl-
dence, and we are led to believe that
the assertion is but part of that un-
paralelled impotence which claims
Lynchburg and Wyandotte as the sub
urbs of Oroyile. 1t is undeniable fact,
and one well known to the people Of
Oroville, that there are at least four
places in the county capable of casting
larger vote than Orovile, and at least
half a dozen places in the county doing
larger and much more healthy bust
ness than Oroville. And why should
they not assert their claims, if they
choose to do so Lynchburg, Wyan-
dotte, Thompson's Flat, and Forbestown
are places capable of sustaining as large
population as Oroville, ard some Of
these places have done it for years.
There is nothing in the bill confning
the issue between Oroville and Bidwell
and we hardly know why they should
endeavor to create an impression SO OBJ
viously false and absurd, unless it is be-
cause they already see the hopelessness
of their cause ana like drowning men are
grasping after straws.


Another piece of unblushing impu-
dence in the advocates for Oroville, is
the assertion that their town is the ge-
ographical and business centre of the
county. Geographically Oroyille is To-
Gated within about fifteen miles of the
southern line of the county, while from
Oroville to the northern line of the
county is more than double that distance.
1t is only some sixteen miles from Oro-
vile to the western line of the county
while the distance from Oroville to the
eastern line of the county in the vicinity
of Forbestown, is about twenty-five
miles, and to the northeastern portion
of the county not less than sixty miles.
SO much for Oroville being the geo.
graphical centre of the county We
should have noticed this bare-faced as
sertisn while the bill was before the leg
islature. had we not deemed it useless
to oppose the magic influence Of political
grips and signs with the common sense
argument OF flcts and figures. Before
the people, who are directly interested
however, the case is different, and We
notice the assertion in order that the
people may be aware ofits falsity. Oro'
vile comes no nearer being the business
centre of the county than it does the
geographical centre. We do not hazart
much when we assert that there are
more goods and more money in almost
any other mining locality in the county
than there is in Oroville The busines;
capacity Of Oroville must be measured
not by the amount of goods sold, bu
the innumerable arrivals Of ""duns"" from
Dealers below, for upon no other pre-
sumption can the visitor form an idea o
very extensive business. The fact is, i
is all hurnbug, and CANNON. Orovillt
has been built up under excitement-th
locality cannot sustain the town-and i
is sought to dispose of it to the count,
as place for her capital. Her suburb
if they are as extensive as claimed, ar,
much more prosperous than the paren
city, and should they exert themselves
are much more likely to obtain the coun
: ty seat. There is nothing in the bill
conGning the choice between Orovill,
and Bidwell 1t is for the qualified
electors of the county to select whateve


place they choose.


Another important consideration 70
the taxpayers Of the county, is this
One Of the present lncumbents Of tht
ESupreme bench OF this State, in decid
ing upon the question of the location o.
the State government, held that the &C
declaring a certain place to be the sea
of government, made it such, whether
the conditions subsequent were complied

cation of our county seat, declares tina

enough, and fixes the county seat at tn,

since our visit to that section j. indeed a sur
prising one. 0ne year ago there were but
one or two buildings on the spot now occupied

created wondrous transformation, and were
Oroyille and Lynchburg combined, they
would present fine prospective mining

Lynchburg, as we did in the evening, it pre-

bright lights along the extensive streets,
glancing from under the ma jestic and brave
old oaks which have been left to shelter The
town from the oppressive heat Of the summer,
presented q view which flled our beau ideal

ter which has just passed, and the failure OF
the ditch to supply them with water, has
driven many to seek elsewhere for the pre-
cious treasures Of mother earth. But the
0rovllians do not despair; they have no idea
| of giving up the ship. With a perseverance
unequalled even in this fast country, they
turn the dry weather 70 the credit side of

caused them to prospect ground, for miles in
extent, which has heretofore remained un-
prospected and which is found to pay from
five cent, to sixty FIVE cents to the pan, and

Some Of the miserable and unfortunate unbe-
lieyers will say that this is another humbug,
gotten up just before the election upon the
county seat question takes place, in order
that they may create q favorable impression
before the people of the county-n spasmodic
efTort-a gavanic shock Of life. We do not so
regard it, and hope that their expectations
may be realized. But those who have wit
messed river operations are not easily led
away by rich prospects Claims which pros
pect twenty-five or thirty dollars to the pan
have failed to pay the cost Of constructing a
tume, and rendered men more careful Of in
vesting hard cash on one good prospect. We
doubt not but that the experience the inhab-
itarts Of Oroville have already had has given
them the new name of caution, and a desire
to see something real and tangible before ma
king further investments. There are many
warm and generous hearts in these hamlets
far down on the river, whose prosperity would
please us better than our own, and who de-
serve success in all their undertakings-ex
cept in getting the county seat upon a pros
pect Of from five to sixty five cents to the pan.
When 0royiile has been proved and establish
ed her ability to sustain place Of the first
Importance in the county, we will speak to
the gentleman from Africa for that corner lot
and fire proof building. But the county seat

require as he has suited me with pair of Spectaces

very much by service of years in the Post Office

After most careful examination Of Mr. J. Tobias's
Glasses, am enabled to testify that their hardness
cearness, polishing and exact optical shape render
them particularly reeommendable to those whose
merely optical impairment of the eyes are in want OF
such auxliaries consider, moreover, Mr. Tobias
fully qualified to determine the focus of the eye both
by his optical knowledge and experience, and by
state that Mr.. Tobias has supplied some of my pa.
hents with Glasses, to their and my satisfaction.

suits from too constant and intense use of these

bas new ana improved discovery for the eyes, whose

pertinent. We are more than pleased with the arti-

any we had tried before; and we see more dis

UNCERTAINTY OF ELEcusG A UNITED STATES SENATOR.


The legislature of California assemble Sacra-
city the 7th inst when the Inauguration of Mr.

California says;


Politicians already busy in canvassing for the cleo


ton of United States senator to fill the vacancy
stoned by the expiration of the time for which Doctor
Gwin elected The prominent 10 the Amer
can party are understood be Messrs Crabb Fooe
Marshall Flint Newell Of Eldorado Peyon, and Dr. Hitch
cock.


According TO the best information at present there arc
10 the assembly hny-hye Americans twenty-four demo-
crat aud who claims to be whig. In the senate
there seventeen Americans fifteen democrats and
independent ..... dis ia. -.. II. ...


From this classification it will easily be seen that the
American party easily elect United States senator in
its members into election and are united upon
candidate But there other questions which will proba
bly, make a selection difficult The American party has
been formed by combination Of wings and democrats
and II is believed that eaouses will arise by which
portion Of party will refuse to coaesce with the other
Indeed, we hear already that certain men who were
originally democrats refuse TO support Mr. Crabb any

will occur in that body for the change Of single vote


from the American the democratic party might produce
such state Of things that election could not take
place from the refusal of democratic members TO 60

cr and deposited or buried his gold in some
safe (?) place, two men were working to-
gether on whom fortune had smiled a little
more propitiously than usual. They buried
their money and each knew the place where
the other had placed his dust One Of them
having obtained as much Of the precious ore
as he thought would answer bis purpose,
gathered together his pile and started for
the States After he left, the other thought
he would examine his deposited treasure and
see if it was all right lie accordingly re-
paired to the spot where he imagined he had
buried it, and To-! it was gone-he could not
find it. The conclusion jumped at by him
forthwith was that his partner who had just
left, had taken his dust also. Off he posted
after his supposed dishonest partner, over
took him in the valley, and accused him of
the theft, which he of course very stoutly
denied. Fortunately for the homeward
bound, we had no sheril's, constables, or
other limbs Of the law in those early days,
and as the loser had no direct proof that his
partner had taken his money, he could get


no assistance in the valley to bring him


back, and was accordingly obliged to let


him go The loser returned to Weaver Civ
ing up all hopes Of ever recovering his lost


treasure; went to work again and ere long
had made another raise, and started for the
States. Some months afterwards, another
person who had dust buried in the immedi-
ate vicinity of where this mans dust was
supposed to have been stolen from, in search
ing for his own, dug up the lost money
amounting to about $l700. 1t appeared
the man had forgotten the exact spot where
he buried his dust and had dug in searching
within one foot Of it. 1t was fortunate
thing for the suspected man that he had got
ten without the limits of WeayerviIlc before
the supposed loss was discovered, for had he
been suspected and arrested here suspicion
would have been so strong against him he
would very likely have been initiated into
the arts and mysteries Of the laws as admin
istercd by the court Of Judge Lynch; for
in those days, if the community believed a
man guilty, but very little proof was re-
CURED to cause the administration ofpunish-
ment Men were sometimes hung and t,led
attercards.


We have heard of an instance in the
Southern mines where the innocent accused
was not so fortunate. A poor man had just
crossed the Plains, with a single yoke of
oxen which he sold for one hundred dollars
in dust, to some persons who left the place
soon after the purchase, About the same
time purse containing just one hundred
dollars was stolen, and good deal of inter
est manifested by the people near by to dis
cover the thief The unfortunate tcamster
took out his purse in the trading post to
pay 70"" some article, when man Immediate
ly came forward and accused him of the rob
berry. lie was of course forthwith arrested,
the amount in the purse correSponded eX-
actly with the amount lost, the quality of
the gold was the same, it was known the
tcamstcr had just arrived from the Plains
and had no time to dig that amount from
the mines, the man to whom he had sold his
cattle was gone, he had no proof Of how he
came by the money circumstances were all
against him. A jury was accordingly en-
panneIed on the spot, trial had the Jury
found him guilty and sentenced him to re-
ceive thirty lashes on the bare back, which
was forthwith administered, the unfortunate
man all the time protesting his innocence


After he was whipped, he procured pistol
walked deliberately up to the man who first
accused him, placed the pistol to his head,
and told he believed him the guilty man,
and that if he did not there and then con-
fess he had stolen the money he would blow
his brains out The fellow could not stand
the power of injured innocence, he became
frightened, acknowledged himself the guilty
party, and drew the identical lost money out
of his pocket. The enrOged crowd instant
ly seized upon him, bore him to the nearest
tree and hung him. A subscription was
immediately started and about $500 raised
on the spot for the unfortunate teamster,
who started forthwith for his home in the
east

night of the 18th inst, which destroyed
about 30 houses Loss, $4,000

since the Anglo-Saxon race commenced
the settlement Of the Pacific coast, has
the country so swarned with robbers
and thieves. Not day passes but We
hear of one or more outrages committed
on peaceable citizens by scoundrels
whose lives are not worth the rope to
end them. Not a paper reaches us from
among our numerous exchanges, but re-
counts at least one depreciation on socie-
ty. The deeds are not confined to one
section or locality, but scattered promis-
cuously and literally over the State
Armed bands of highwaymen infest the
public roads Of the country, and though
their acts are every day recorded, the
people dream on in perfect apathy, no
effective measures are taken to bring
the rascals TO condign punishment, and
not one of the pests to society has yet
received justice at the hands of the law.


At first, instances of robberies came
to our ears at intervals; but embol-
dened by experience and success, they
have become of SO frequent occurrence
as to create little or no surprise. So
long as this man can look into his drawer
and see, OF put his hand on his purse
and feel his own money safe, he borrows
no trouble at the loss of his neighbor.-
The robbery may have been committed
under his nose, he only congratulates
himself on his own good luck, and laughs
at the triAing mishap which has befallen
his fellow citizen This state of listless
ness should exist no longer Every
man ought to feel that blow struck at
the rights Of society is leveled at him
self-that not an act of lawlessness can
be committed but he is among the in
jured.


Who can read the chapter of wrongs
in another column but feel alarm at the
state of the country, and fear lest his
own turn may come tomorrow 1t is
evident the present condition of things
cannot long exist without serious detri-
ment to every department of business
Bankers cannot risk the imminent dan
ger of losing their treasure for present
profits merchants will not venture their
goods, nor teamsters their loads for the
current rates of gains and wages. Trade
must everywhere be crippled and i'm
paired


But this is not all. 1t is a disgrace TO
a free people, jealous of their rights as
Americans, and lovers of good order and
Justice, to allow scoundrelism, for even
one month, to obtain such sway. 1t is
criminal negligence to suffer indignities
to go unpunished so long. There is
power somewhere, and let it be used
1t is easier to check an evil now than
wait till it has grown emboldened by
success and become formidable If the
law and the established police of the
State is powerless to protect its citizens,
the first law of nature must obtain, and
Judge Lynch be installed to deal justice,
or its severest substitute to all offenders.


There are hundreds of faces in our
midst, familiar to criminal courts, that
ought and must be made, ere long, to
give an account of themselves. San
Francisco has purged herself of their
vile company. There may arise the
necessity of Nevada doing the same."

portion of the diggings in the neighbor-
hood of Virginia Flat, Lynchburg, and Gold
Hill, As large mining population as we
knew to be dwelling near Oroville, we were
unpreparei to witness the number of miners
within so close a proximity TO the town and
the extent Of their operations. 1t should
be remembered that the ditch has been in
successful operation only about one year.
yet in that short space Of time, the grounds
in the vicinity of Virginia Flat. Carpenter s
Flat, Robinson lEi.l, Lynchburg, Gold Hill,
and in fact throughout m extent Of country
a mile and half in width, and FIVE or six
miles in length, have been thorough = test
ed. Some estimate may be formed of the
great amount of labor that has been per-
formed, by visiting these various places and
observing the works that have been and now
are in operation, the shafts that have been
sunk, the tunnels that have been run, and
the acres of surface dirt that have been dug
up and washed.


We believe none Of the miners have ever
been successful in reaching the bedrock,
although hard substance called by the
miners cement is found in many places
at depths varying from sixteen to thirty or
forty feet, on which deposite Of pay dirt
is lodged. From the many reservoirs and
bitches the ground has become saturated
with water, rendering it difficult to work
many Of the deeper shafts, and prccludng
the possibility of reaching the bed rock
We have converscd with several Of the min
ers abaut the matter. and all agree in the
opinion that could the bedrock be reached,
a stratum Of dirt surprising in richness any
ground above, would be found extending
throughout the whole of those localities be-
fore mentioned


All sorts of plans have been suggested for
draining claims of water among which are
force pumps, wind mills, and syphons, and
correspondent in the Sacramento Union
suggests the use of the latter instrument as
means with which to convey off the water
from shafts and other places that cannot be
drained by bitches or fumes There is no
no doubt of the practicability of the syphon
in some places. Such claims, for instance,
as are situated near the steep bank of n riy-
er or ravine could be drained in this man
ner, but where the claim is situated in a
fiat. level country like this, of course it
would not be available, the long leg of the
syphon having to be so placed as to be lower
at its end than the claim to be drained -
Wind mills may possibly be brought into
successful operation, but We opine that the
only reliable, efficient means, is that offered
by the power of steam, and until steam en-
gines are put into use, we hardly believe
that the deeper diggings of the bluff and tie
flats can be worked advantageously."

""Having suffered for many years past with weak
ness of the eyes, and that defect of vision which
suits from toe constant and intense use of these
sensitive organs, we were led to make trial of To-
bisss and improved discovery for the eyes, whose
name heads this article. We saw them recommend
ed by sundry gentlemen of Virginia, whom we know,
and therefore had less hesitation in making the
pertinent. We are more than pleased with the arti-
Gle. We read with less fatigue with these lens than
any we had ever tried before; and we see more dis
tnctly with them. Without meaning to disparage the
claims of Others who have made improvements in
Spectacle Lens, we deem it but just to make the
above statement. Mr.. Tobias resides on Seventh

for it; you will hear the crying of my chill

Cottle also related that he had prevented
the murder of the jaior, and prevented
Jail delivery; whereas, by permitting it. he
might himself have escaped He also con-
tinued his remarks by repeating what is al
ready given, adding thereto perhaps little
more of bitterness and malignity against his
fellow creatures. He remarked that he might
as well talk as not during the short time left
him to live, as it could do no harm if it could
do no good.


He was finally advised that his hour had
come. During the reading Of the death-war-
rant, by the Sheriff, the prisoner remained
calm and motionless but became very pale
and considerably agitated as the rope was
adjusted about his neck. As he neared the
clark valley of the shadow Of DEATH"" he be-
came somewhat confused, and called rather
ncoherently, ""mercy"" my father in heaven""
my children"" &c He asked anxiously,
""won't they have prayer"" After which the
cap was drawn over his face, and brief but
affecting petition was addressed to the Throne
of Grace. As the minister pronounced the
word ""Amen,"" the fatal drop fell, and the
spirit of Nathan Cottle took its fight to an
other sphere Of existence.


The prisoner was dressed in suit of black.
A white muslin cap was used. The body,
after hanging until pronounced dead by the
attending physician, was taken down and
buried short distance from the scaffold.


Much credit is due the Sheriff and his as
sistants, for the admirable manner in which
all preparations had been made. The very
best of order prevailed throughout


Opinions varied considerably as to the num-
Der present Some thought there were ff-
teen hundred or two thousand; but probably
about eight hundred would be the best esti-
mate. OF this number, some eighteen or
twenty we are sorry to say were females.


This is the first execution by the officers of
the law, that has ever taken place in Anna
dor county; but large number have been ex-
ecuted under sentence from Judge Lynch.


The reporter of this is under particular
obligations to Sheriff Durham and Deputy
Sheriff Houghtalng, for their kindness in
furnishing every facility for taking notes."

OF the United States Exploring Expe-
dition to the River Jordan and the Red
Sea, in 1S4S, visited the garden of
Gethscmane, about the month of May.
He says: ""The clover upon the
ground was in bloom, and altogether
the garden, in its aspects and associa-
tions, was better calculated than any
place | know to soothe troubled spir.
it. Eight venerable trees, isolated
from the smaller and less imposing ones
which skirt the pass of the Mount of
Olives, form a consecrated grove. High
above, on either haud, towers a lofty
mountain, with deep yawning chasm
of Jehosaphat between them. Crown
ing one of them is living city, on the
slope of the other is the great Jewish
cemetery-city OF the dead Each tree
in this grove, cankered and gnarled,
and furrowed by age, and beautiful and
impressive in its decay, is living mon
ument of the affecting scenes that have
taken place beneath and around It,.
The olive perpetuates itself from the
root of the dying parent stem, the tree
springs into existence. These are ac-
counted one thousand years old, Un-
der these, of the preceding growth,
therefore, the Saviour was wont TO rest;
and one of the present may mark the
very spot where he knelt and prayed,
and wept. No caviling doubt can find
entrance here. The geographical boun-
darics are too distinct and clear for an
instant's hesitation. Here the Christi
an, forgetful of the present and absorb
ed in the past, can resign himself to
sad, yet soothing meditation. The few
purple and crimson flowers growing
about the roots of the tree, will give
him ample food for contemplation, for
they tell of the suffering and ensanguin-
ed death of the Redeemer.''"

resign. If this should turn out to be so,
a representative from the people of Kan

Woodson, the present Secretary OF the

As the Border Rufians now denounce
that weak and contemplate creature,
Wilson Shannon, the administration will
not hesitate to set him aside. But this
stuff about ga representative of the peo-
pie of Kansas"" at Washington soliciting
the appointment of Woodson, Shannon's
Secretary. is unusually audacious. Why
this Woodson is the miserable scoundrt
who used Shannon's name and influence
10 call into Kansas the Border Ruffians,

pie of Kansas were not lovers of order,
they would have lynched this Woodson
long ago.-Boston Telegraph."

Mrs. Farnham's lecture and was evidently al.
noyed. Hear what he says:


Most of those persons who leave the lecture
during the exercises, are those who have creak-
ing boots, and seem anxious to let the people
know they around; or else that class of young
foPs, whose legs being just the size of dipped
candles without their straightness, and encased
in pants hardly able to hold even them, they
leave because it is painful to sit with their legs
bent. We noticed this particularly last evening
Scarcely man left who had good leg, while
nearly every one "" ore creaking boots. If any
man ever deserved lynch law, ii is he who wears
creaking boots Intentionally, is late negigently,
and leaves in the midst of the exercises ill.man-
neredly"

Killed. bv Jim Casey.",,"Killed, Dy jim OdSoy


The city of San Francisco, and in fact the
whole State, has been thrown into an intense
excitement by an outrage of the grossest
nature. We cannot favor mob law In any
shape but could tolerate violence OF the
kind, in this case, more easily than any
former example. The act has probably been
premeditated by Casey for long time, and
the occasion was only lacking. On the l4th
it seemed to have presented itself in resenting
some remarks published in the Bulletin re-
flecting upon Casey. Mr. King referred to
him few days ago as a ballot box stutfer,
and as having served two years in the Sing
Sing prison-the latter is no doubt true, as
the trial is published. The following details,
from below, are all we have space for in this
issue. We pray God, Mr.. Kings life may be
preserved if indeed for nothing better than
to lash this spirit of rufliansm into subsection;


""At half-past o'clock, on Wednesday
last, jim Casey entered the room of the
Erening Bulletin San Francisco, and asked
Mr. King why he had used such language in
reference to him. and told him he would not
allow him to do so again. Mr.. X. replied he
would do so again when occasion required,
and requested Casey to leave the Office
Casey left, and short time after met Mr..
King crossing Montgomery and Washington
streets, when nearly in front of ""Phils oys-
ter saloon,' Casey called out to King, 'are
you armed, if so draw and defend yourself
Mr. X. stopped, folded his arms, and said
""are YOU in earnest"" Casey said yes"" and
again repeated his warning to draw and de-
fend. Mr.. King dropped his arms and made
motion as if to draw his weapon. There
are several versions Of the language used by
both parties at the moment, and it is difficult
to find out the precise words used.


Casey fired a shot from a navy revolver
which took effect in the left breast of Mr.
King, above the nipple, and within few
inches of the shoulder. Mr.. X. exclaimed
ooh, oh, | am shot,"" and walked into the
Pacific Express office where he was properly
taken care of.


Casey after having discharged his pistol,
down when he drew hisweapon, and was i'm
mediately arrested by Deputy Sheriff Byrne,
and walked off to the City Prison-a great
rush was shortly afterward made to it by an
excited crowd, who blocked up the Court
Yard and avenues to the Prison, crying out
chang HIM. hang him!!' The sheriff and
his officers and the City Marshal were prompt
ly on the spot, and took the prisoner from
the Prison to the County Jail in a hack
An immense crowd had by this time assem-
bed, who directed their steps to the County
Jail, and by the time the Sheriff had arrived
there several thousand persons had assembled
together, repeating the cry of hang him.!'
hang him.


About this time. Thos. S. King, a brother
Of James, mounted a balcony opposite the
Jail and addressed the excited multitude.
Citing the cause of the difficulty, and said,
ave have got to take that Jail, and to do so
we may have to kill those officers, unless
they give way to us. We must hang that
! fellow up The crowd cheercd him tre-
mendously.


From until o'clock, Montgomery ST.,
from Clay to Washington, was the most
crowded thoroughtare ever witnessed.


This was occasioncd by addresses in
favor of taking summary steps to punish the
assaiant BY Lynch Law. At palfpast 6
o'clock Mayor Van Ness arrived at the J all
and addressed the excited multitude, desiring
them to dsperse, that in a moment Of eX-
ctement they might do what years could
not make amendment for Some cried out
""Where's Cora? d--n such Justice, let us
hang him."" DC, &c.


During the whole evening, one living mass
of humanity was moving from the Jail to the
place Of shooting. Not till - O'Clock did
the large assembagc dispcrse from around
the Express Office where Mr.. King remained
estimated that in the assembly there was not
less than ten Thousand persons. Several
speakers appearing upon balconies and en-
couragng the people by earnest appeals to
avenge the blood Of their fellow citizen who
had fallen. The question was finally put to
them, as to whether they were ready or not,
and one unanimous ""aye"" sounded from the
vast throng. The speakers then proposed
that all should retire and arm themselves,
and meet on the Plaza at o'clock. If there
had been any organization amongst the cx-
cited populace the consequences would have
been awful at the Prison.


This building was mounted by strong
force Of Police, Sheriff's posse City Guards,
San Francisco Blues, Wallace Guards, Con
tinenlials and detachment of Light Dra-
goons. The meeting adjourned to the Plaza
and did not effect anything. A company of
military passing through the meeting, were
hooted and Kissed, but passed on not taking
any notice Of the insult. The majority of
the meeting followed the military up to the
County Prison.


From the condition of Mr.. King but little
hopes are entertained of his life. His Doc
tors were of different opinions as to the ex-
tent of his injuries. The pistol ball, which
entered the body above the left nipple Of the
breast, went through the body, passed lit
| tie upwards and came out OF his hack naar"

 The clover upon the ground was in bloom, and altogether, the garden in it's aspects and associations, was better calculated than any place know, to soothe a troubled spirit.- Eight venerable trees, isolated from the small Ter and less imposing ones which skirt the pass of the Mount of Olives, form consecrated grove. High above on either hand, towers a lofty mountain, with deep yawning chasm of Jehosaphat between them. Browning one of them living city--on the slope of the other is the great Jewish Cemetery, city of the dead.

 Each tree in this grove, cankered and gnarl- ed and furrowed by age, yet beautiful and im- pressive in it's decay, is living monument of the affecting scenes that have taken placc be- heath and around it. The olive perpetuates it. self from the root of the dying parent stem, the tree springs into existence. These are ac- counted one thousand years old. Under those of the preceding growth, therefore. the Say four was wont to rest and one of the present may mark the very spot where He knrit, and prayed, and wept.

 No cavilling doubt can find entrance here.--- The geographical boundaries are too distinct and clear for an instant's hesitation. Here the Christian, forgetful of the present, and absorb cd in the past, can resign himself to sad, yet soothing meditation. The few purple and crimson flowers growing about the roots of the tree, will give him ample food for coutem- plation, for they tell of the suffering and eu- sanguined death of the Redeemer."

Having suffered for many years past with weak
of the eyes, and that defect of vision whichde-
suits from too constant and intense use OF these
sensitive organs, we were led to make trial OF To-
bass and improved discovery for the eyes, whose
name heads this article. We saw them recommend

any we had ever tried before; and see more dis

claims of others, who have made improvements in

After most careful examination of Mr. j. Tobias's
Glasses, am enabled to testify that their hardness
cearness polishing and exact optical shape, render
merely optical impairment of the eyes in want of
such auxiliaries | consider, moreover, Mr.. Tobias
fully qualified to determine the focus of the eye both
by his optical knowledge and experience, and by
mea ms of his optometer. In addition, can further
state that Mr.. Tobias has supplied some of my pa
tients with Glasses to their and my satisfaction.

In the experience of even two years, have found
great difficulty in obtaining Spectacles that were ex-
acty adapted to the weakness of my sight This in
convenience Mr. Tobias seems TO have removed for
the present by the substitution for me of better and
more suitable Glasses. They clear, chrystalke,
and comfortable to my eyes. would commend him
to those who, from age or other inirmity, require
artificial aid in this way. J. j. SIMKlNS,pAs ID.
SIR: The pair of Spectacles you furnished me yes
terday are particularly satisfactory to me- They
very decidedly the best possess, and am the owner
of eight nine pairs carefully selected in different

account of their professional standing in France Eng

with your remarks and directions on the treatment
Of the eyes, for the purpose of preserving and mpro

says


Passing through the Arcade Saloon, we no.
ticed at one Of the auction stands a negro girl up
for sale, and around closely y-packed crowd that
appeared to be deeply interested in what was going
on. Curiosity led us to pause and inquire what
was the cause of the apparent excitement The
bids were going on in spirited manner, and gem
orally at an advance OF only FIVE dollars bid, and
at every bid the eyes Of the crowd would quickly
turn in the direction whence the bid proceeded,
the interest and the excitement being, in the mean
time, upon the increase. The girl--a bright, in
telligent muatress, about fourteen years old--was
evidently not Indifferent to what was tranepiring
There was moisture in her eyes, but they as
sumed an expression which indicated that she felt
some anxiety in regard to the result Of the sale,
which is not generally the case.


"" As the bids reached near a thousand dollars,
the excitement became intense, and IA that figure
n,as called, spontaneous hiss was heard from one
enL' of the room TO the other followed by a vehe-
,nent ehout Of Turn him out y Turn him outp


""a rush was made for the door, the hammer
had fallen. and the girl Also into the arms of-her
mother, WHO had become her purchaser. The
explanation OF IL all was that the woman had been
freed by her owner, and had earned money enough
10 buy her child, the muatress in question, and,
being yesy valuable servant, several persons
were anxious to obtain her, but all Of them, with
one exception, had pledged the mother that they
weuld not bid against her, and they honoraby
kept their faith. 1t was the conduct Of this one,
who was bidding against the mother, which 90 ex-
cited and exasperated the crowd on tho occasion.
The man made good his escape, fortunately so for
him, we think, as we heard sundry expressions
about lynching, &C., as the crowd came back to
talk over the matter. The mother was so much
affected by the JOY of having succeeded in retain.
ing possession Of her child that she swooncd away,
aud was carried out Of the saloon. We may add
that the sale was a necessary sale, and was not
designed to be anything more than nominal, and
nobody intended that the mother should be dc
prived of her child"

And bis men were close TO Lawrence. Many have de-

will be postponed are these: The intention Of the

and not the fear CT the men now around Lawrence
ITSELF that has paralyred the Free SCate men; and
they now want ON able leader whom the people
will trust. As matters stand however, the people
OF Lawrence are not exactly in the attitude 10
which their enemies want them. Hence these out
RACES by the parties around Lawrence, all Of which
are designed to arouse resistance and preciptate

and have not even the color Of Law, | think that
every such instance should be promptly met and
repelled. War has isdccd begun. Armed bands
that run about the Territory, plundering and taking
prisoners and shooting, can only be regarded
by the citizens in light, and in that light fear

avert an issue, TO evade the Territorial law and its

neither abandon their desigus nor seek repentance


Gov. Shannon has dispatched messengers TO Lex

responds by this requsitiOn. have not ascertaiued
that this requisiton is on the Governor of Mis-

Another outrage was committed at Kansas City
two days ago on the person of e. W. Brown,
Editor of The Herald Of Freedom, Published at

ness OF the eyes, and that defect of vision which re-
suits from too constant and intense use of these
sensitive organs, were led to make trial of To.
biass new and improved discovery for the eyes, whose
name heads this article. We saw them recommend

and therefore had less hesitation in making the ex-
pertinent. We are more than pleased with the arti.
cle We read with less fatigue with these lens than
any we had ever tried before and we see more dis

claims of others, who have made improvements in

Having been for years under the necessity of havN

Tobias, which answered both purposes. / have used
his for several months, and find them excellent.

After most careful examination of Mr. j. Tobias's

them particularly recommendable to those whose
merely optical impairment of the eyes are in want OF
such auxaries. consider, moreover, Mr.. Tobias
fully qualified to determine the focus of the eye both
by his optical knowledge and experience, and by
means of his optometer. In addition I can further
state that Mr.. Tobias has supplied some of my pa
tients with Glasses, to their and my satisfaction.

The Democrats of Pine Grove Precinct
met in pursuance to the call of the Demo
cratic Central Committee of Placer county.


Philip Lynch was duly chosen as Chair
man, and Lewis G. Smith, Secretary.


The Chairman briefly stated the object Of
the meeting to be to elect two Delegates to
attend the County Convention to be held in
Auburn on the 23d inst, and urged upon
the Democracy the importance Of standing
firm to their posts.


On motion, NJ X Finley and p. Lynch
were elected as Delegates to attend said
Convention.


1t was further resolved that each Delegate
be empowered to appoint proxy i'll his stead
should he be unable to attend.


On motion, it was resolved that COM
mittee of three be appointed to draft resou-
tons expressive of the sentiments of the
Democrats of this precinct. NJ X. Finley
John Grow and James Ashforth were chosen
as said committee, who presented the fol-
lowing resolutions which were unanimously
adopted.


WHEREAS, The time is fast approaching
when the Democracy Of the United States
will be called upon to battle at the ballot
box in defence of their time-honored and re-
pcatcdy endowed principles and measures.
And whereas, They have a secret and inyid-
Gus political foe now to contend against,
which is perhaps less national in its charac-
ter than the old Wing party, Gts professions
to the contrary Notwithstanding Therefore,
ReSoloed That the Democrats Of this pre-
cinct pledge themselves to use all honorable
means in the coming campaign to secure the
triumphant election Of the standard bearers
Of the Democratic party.


Resolped, That we are opposed to all secret
political or sectional parties-and especially
do we oppose the knowNothing party-be-
cause it is proscriptiye in its policy tyrani
cal in Its tendency and unable even to be-
come national party.


ReSolred, That we fully endorse the course
pursued in the State Senate 10y the Demo
Gratis therein, upon the Senatorial question
believing that California had better remain
unrepreseneI another year, than to be mis-
represented for the next five, as she doubtless
would have been if Henry $. Foote or Ewd.

There seems to be considerable ufeasness
IN the'minds of very great number Of Dor
citizens IN regard to the probable disposition
Of our public square. Itappears to me, sir,
that there can be but one opinion in reyntd
to the rights of Bird s Morris, (the presens
claimants) to the same. If they had nm nc.
tual right to the exclusive possession of the
one hundred and sixty acres of land known
as the latham Ranch, and did, on the frs,
day of June, A, D. 1856, or at any other or
subsequent time, lay off, or cause to be laid
off, town into lots, blocks, streets and npb.
lie squares, as soon as they sold one lot
within the limits of that town, they parted
with their right to the exclusive possession
of the streets. and squares within the same


1t was with the understanding that the
square was devoted to the public, and to re.
m ain subject to their pleasure, that parties
purchased lots alongside and fronting the
same, and built houses and expended money
thereon. Why, would ask did not these
claimants assert their pretended right at
the time we were harmonizing with Lynch
burg What, | would ask, was said and
done by these parties at the time it was pro.
posed to place the Court house on the Bluff
above the town Have they forgotten what
they said and dill! Is it not notoyiou,
fact that, these same parties held out as an
lnducement for putting the Court H.usc
within the limits of the town, that a public
square had been laid off for that purpose.
and was lying open and in wait to receive il?
Do they not remember that some of our
citizens proposed locating the Court House
out of the square and fronting the same, and


that they opposed il strenuousiy, declaring
at the same time that the only proper place


for it was in the centre of the public square!
Strange consistency their course at the
/ present time. Looking back upon it, one is
/ forciby reminded of the old adage--' Con .

about the month of May. He says:


""The clover on the ground was in

aspects and associations, was better calcu-
lated than any place | know, to soothe a
troubled spirit. Eight venerable trees,
isolated from the smaller and less imposing
ones which skirt the passs of the Mount
of Olives, form aconsecrated grove. High
above ON either hand. towers lofty noun
tain, with deep yawning chasm OF Jehos-
ephat between them. Growing one of
them is living city; on the slope of the
other is the great Jewish Cemetery-City
of the Dead. Each tree in this grove,
cankered, and gnarled, and furrowed by
by age, and beautiful and impressive in
its decay, is living monument Of the af-
fecting scenes that have taken place be-
meath and around it. The olive perpetu-
ates itself from the root of the dying pa
rent stem, the tree springs into existence
These are accounted one thousand years
old. Underthese Of the preceding growth,
therefore, the Saviour was wont to rest;
and one of the present may mark the very
spot where he knelt, and prayed, and
wept. No caviling doubt can find en-
trance here. The geographical boundaries
ara foo distinct and clear for an inStant'S
hesitation. Here the Christian, forgetful
of the present, and absorbed in the past,
can resign himself to sad, yet soothing
meditation The few purple and crimson
flowers growing about the roots of the tree,
will give him ample food for contempla-
ton, for they tell of the suffering and en-
sanguined death of the Redeemer."""

In our issue of yesterday, when speaking

we put them down at.

Ned Taylor's claim pays about an ounce a

i6es US to hear of his success.


Smith 4 Co, and Morris & Co., ON Carpen-

are just striking it rich. Their claims pay
from $40 to an ounce day to the hand."

Dickson, in truth, had cause To play. The painness

upon him opposition ana opprobriuul, and aiens'ed
some of his best friends. The support which many
had been vi Ing TO contnouts 20 his poverty was en-
tirely wlthdrawn. His wife, in feeble health, was
toil'ng daily beyond Ter strength; and hunger had
looked in at the door, but, each day, prayer had

On yesterday we heard of camp of Span

arrest them. They resisted; several shots were
fired on both sides. There we're two Spaniards
one was shot dead, and the other gave him
self up. The one killed is said to have been
concerned in the murder of Wall and William

killed had shot man in Monterey, and they
both intended to leave for parts unknown as soon
as they could learn what Anastacio Garcia, who
was brought from below last week. had to say.
These fellows had stolen a saddle from US few

readily complied, and an appointment for the next

Pr, ..all is fair in politics."" to carry this
.n u-Is into practice, when the subjects they
IT, Irs to deal with, are of that calibre that
inar can be hoodwinked and deceived by
r,s3ply .ne stating, and, if necessary, solemnly
a,.serrerating as fact what never has had
Nv existence But when these same
ansskers attempt to impose their crudities
I'D rumancing upon those who are equally

.Iemselyes. it assumes degree Of impu-
Ia,ce q little too much for patient endu-

f,r the purpose of deceiving the ignorant

Fillmore is tainted with Freesoilism; when
+bev know, or should know, that MIR. Fill
more is regarded by the Aboiitionists of
the North as their most bitter and indomi-
table foe.


For the edifcation of those jealous
Champions, we would commend them to
the speech of Gov. Floyd of Virginia, re-
Gently delivered to the merchants of New
York. We will first, before making an
extract from that speech, tell them who
Gov. Floyd is He is a Yirginian, and at
one time Governor of that Commonwealth,
and IS now candidate on the Democratic
electoral ticket He is moreover State
RIGHTS nan of the strictest order of that
se6ool. and was regarded as orthodox in
that particular faith, that South Carolina
once cast her vote for him as President
Such being the status of Gov. Floyd, his
sentiments will be duly appreciated by all
Of the faithful. To the subjoined extract
We particularly invite the attention of the
reyilers and slanderers of Mr. Fillmore,
whom they represent as but little better
than Seward, or Chase, or Sumner This
bigh-minded Virginian, who should know
him full as well as they do, does not so
estimate Millard Fillmore. In the first
Place, we are told by the veracious press,
AZ the corners of the streets, and by coffee
house speakers, that Mr. Fillmore is no
where; that he can't be elected, that be
viii not get over one Or two States, and
some of the most unreasonable of them
even say he will not get single State
tloy Floyd does not so regard him. He
counts him as the staunchest and most
tormida1le adversary


The Democrats in New Orleans and Gov
Floyd differ in another particular-in their
estimate, respectively, of the American
party Senator Benjamin, when he de-
CARED in his speech at Odd Fellows Hall,
that Mr. Fillmore ''degraded himself by
his association with the American party
expressed the opinion of the Democrats in
this city generally Gov Floyd thinks
that the American party is not quite so
infamous. In enc respect he claims affinity
with them. He says ''there are bonds of
union between the Democracy and the
American party, and these bonds of union
are the bonds of justice, truth, patriotism
and right-thc bonds of the Constitution
and the Union""


Of }lr- FIllmOre's merits as man and
statesman, Gov Floyd has an exalted
opinion, and in a certain contingency
would most freely vote for him as Presi-
dent The man whom the small fry poll
tieans of this meridian denounce as an
AbolitiOnist, worse even than Fremont, the
Virginia Democratic Elector is willing to
take as an instrument to save the Union.
Hear this noble-minded man and honest
Tatriot:


If yOu can show me-"" says Gov Floyd,
that the candidate of the Black Republi-
can party can only be beaten by my vote
for Hr. Fillmore, why then L will give my
vote for him, if the ground should open
and swallow me- (Applause.) will tell
YOU something more Virginia, Demo
cratic Virginia, that never failed, never
i4ltered, and never tired. In the most cfiti-
cal times, will come out and stand at my
blck In that crisis.


These are sentiments worthy the man
aud the patriot Contrast them, we beg
or readers, with the wishy-washy and
grandiloquent trash they are daily hearing
t'Om the mushroom politicians who assume
tie office of instructing and leading the
people The entire extract Is worthy of

There seems to be considerable uneasiness
in the minds of very great number of our
citizens in regard to the probable disposition
of our pu5lic sqmrc. ltappears to me, SIR
that there can be but one opinion in regard
to the rights Of Brd & Morris, (the present
claimants) to the same. If they had an ac-
tual right to the exclusive possession OF the
one hundred and sixty acres of land known
rs the latham Ranch, and did, on the first
day Of June, A. d. 1850, or at any other or
subsequent time, lay of, or cause TO be lad
off, town into lots, blocks, streets and pub
lie squares as soon as they sold one lot
within the limits Of that town, they Harted
with their right to ;he exclusive possession
Of the streets ard squares within tho same.


It was with the understanding that the
square was-devotel to the public, and to re-
main subject to their pleasure, that parties
purchased lots alongside and fronting the
same, and built houses and expended money
thereon Why, would ask did not these
claimants assert THAR pretended right at
the time we we're narm0al3lng with Lynch
burg? What, woald ask, was SAID and
done by these parties at the tin!e it vas pro-
posed to place the Court house on the Buff
above the town Have they forgotten what
they said and dill? Is it not Il notOrt0uS
fnet that, these same parties held out as an
inducement for putting the Court II use
within the limits of the town, that public
square had been laid Oft for that purpose,
and was lying open and in wait to receive it?


Do they not remember that some Of our
citizens proposed locating the Court House
out Of the square and fronting the same, aud
that they opposed it Strenn9usly, DECLARING
at the same time tAat the only proper place
for, was in the centre of the public square:
Strange consistency their course ut the

hero, in which he deied Col ponniphan to
meet him in mortal combat with fifty picked
men of both sides; we'll one would suppose
from his style of challenge and his brave

uine metal in the man; but hear what his
own father-in-law says of this Kansas hero,
whom Horace Greeley has almost elevated
to demigrd


Mr. Badrdge the gentleman alnded TO,
told the editor of the Davenport Democrat
that when Lane his precious son-in-aw, in
duced his daughter to go to Kansas, he sold
her property. amounting to $4,000, and at
ter reaching Kansas he took unto himself Il
mistress, and treated his poor wife so badly
that She WAS forced to leave him for the home
of her father. Lane told her he had paid
her passage on the steamboat for Indiana,
but after the boat started she found his state
ment to be false, and it was with difficulty
that she raised money enough to pay the
passage. Lane had robbed her Of her for
tune, been guilty OF aduItry with mistress,
and sent her home pennlt>s acd after she
had left, tried to get a divorce from her
through the very territorial Legislature
which he is denouocing as bogus and Illegal.
What choice instruments the Republicans
use to adv ocae their cause! How proud The
Republicans must feel, who have idolized
this hero Of freedom. What u happy text

 tuate those advocates and opponents un- der such circumstances. it is often diff. cult to demonstrate. The mind of no man can see farther than its mental eyes enable it to see; therefore, charity in such cases would generally compel us to conclude that these persons decide honestly from full survey of all the pros and cons their feeble minds can col lcct at one time, upon the subject.

 But some persons, with respect to their un- derstanding the nature of proposition or a measure-are blind under surrounding circum- stances that compes their neighbors to teel cer- tain that they are in the dark only because they will not see have in view the Kansas Nebraska measure and those southern citizens who oppose it, and who, in carrying out that opposition represent the views expressed upon the subject by leading northern and southern democrats. sn such e manner as to impress upon the minds of the people here that the demo- cratic doctrine upon the subject of slavery was anti-slavery in its nature, or was one thing at the north and another thing at the south.- Look, for instance, with what (feigned) gusto these southern dough-face dissimulators par ade bne-or-t,co extracts from the speeches of

 Douglas or Richardson or Breckinridge. Thus they find Breckinridge's free-soil procivities and the free soil tendency of the democra- tlc doctrlne-in a statement he made in free State lately--that ""he had DO connection agih q hoT oJ the territories"" etc. And Mr. Breckinridge was most righteously correct. For truly the demo-

 cracy makes it Gan object' to extend nothing but liberty and equal rights under the constitu- tion. It is never for the extension or the do- mnancy of any thing beyond it's constitutional

 right. For no manufacturing, for no commer- cial interest--for no institution, for no religious denomination beyond its equal rights The demagogue and the hypocrte may make the superficial think that the democracy is |"" every thing by turns and nothing long"" To produce this apperance all these haters of equal rights have to do is to aim their blows at the rights of the different interests into which society is divided, or to give some one unequal advan- tages over the rest, and the democracy in the pursuit of its duty may have to be by turns -agriculturalist, pro- Catholic, pro-naturali- zed citizen, pro-slavery-may be pro-Universa- list, pro- Unitarian, pro-M Methodist, and so on. The equal rights haters always have--and doubtless always will-give the democracy enough to do in defending the various condi- tions of society from their assaults and vile Not to go farther back, lately Catholics and citizens of foreign brth were the selected victims. Now the war is hottest against the rights of negro slave holders. Af- ter that is settled it will be some thing else

 Some of these sapient, vinegary politicians are very earnest in declaring that the action of the democracy of to-day not democratic, and prove it by showing us that the democracy took no such position formerly upon the subject! This is an old equal-rights- argument. The sentiments that the equal-rights- -haters will entertain fifty years hence would make them very good democrats of to-day; they will be ready to knock man down who would charge them with being opposed to the south ern people taking their property into any of the territories upon an equal footing with the people of any other section. They will feel insulted if any man will charge them with be- ing Know Nothings; but they will then be, as their predecessors are now, against the enforce ment ofthe equal-rights principle with regard to { b,, ,,l; .I +

 be appealing to the democracy for redress; and they will then attempt to show, as they do now. that the democratic party did not former ly take certain positions, etc. Every progress sive revolution of society turns up its peculiar phenomena-its peculiar phaze, and the demo- cratic principle and the equal-rghts hating principle hold on to their relative positions although their actual positions are changed carried Jtor'card with the progress of the age.

 Mr. Breckimidge was right l am aware the abotlonists of the north resort to the vile tac- tics of the Know Nothings-they tell the peo- pie there that the object of democracy is 10 ex- tend slavery-that 1t is pro-slavery, etc., as the Know Nothing cry from one end of the Union to the other was that the democratic party was for extending Catholicism-the influence of the Pope, etc, etc. The object of Mr. Breckin- ridge was to put down this lying impression by explaining to the people the high and noble aim of the democratic party. The clamor raised here by the Fillmoreites about the fa- nous statement of Mr. Breckinridge and oth- CT northern democrats since the passage of the kar sas- Nebraska measure is nothing but a ""de ] turkey trick. It was said certain ta-

 vern-keeper had cooked and served up to his

 boarders dead t,yhey-the people were about to lynch Eim, when it turned out the tavern

 keeper killed the turkey, by which operation 1t got to Je dead Mr. Brecknridge says it is not the object of the democratic party to ex- tend slavery! What southern man will then go for the democratic party? Mir. Breckinridge may with equal truth say that it is not the ob- ject of the democratic party to extend Catholi- cism! What Catholic then should go for demo- cracy? The answer is clear and its truth a righteous one-the object of the democracy is to secure the rights of all-the south as well as the north, the Catholic as we'll as the Protes.

 tant. It is the equa-rights haters-the Know

 Nothings and the black republicans, whose ob- ject it is to spread or extend the privileges and

 the powers of political sections institutions and interests beyond the legitimate constitutional rlght-the interests of the northeastern States over the interests of the western and southern

 States-the Protestant religion over the Ca- tholc-northern rights and privileges over southern rights and privileges. The black re-

 publicans and northern Know Nothings are cla-

 morous for restrictive provisoes against the

 south, for confning negro slavery to its present

 limits. The southern Know Nothing helps the black republican to lash his southern de- mocratc brethren because they will not con- xot- .rT.- 4l"

Our little city just now, presents rather
rare collection of out-oi-lhe- way things. First,
in order, might call your attention.to our De Il

to divine. Be that as it may, his decision was
against the law, and to act consistently, he
disregards its enactments, and treats them as
utilities. The effect of all this, you may readi-
| ly perceive.


Then we have Democratic landlord who |
claims exemption from restraints on "" his HJer- |

posing of Cora, should he succeed in getting
clear by law. Hear him:


The people of this city had right to expect
that whe the new indictment was framed, it
and the accompanying proceedings would be
free from those technical errors which alone
the defence appear TO rely for clearing the pris-
uner. But already ten grounds have been as
signed as reasons for motion to set aside the
indictment. and demurrer presented based on
two informalities in the document And yet the
trial has not commenced! SO that may ex.
pect that with objections 10 the impanneling and
accepting OF jurors. objections to the ruling of
the judge. &c.. the case, even 1t the jury should
be compelled TO find verdict Of guilty, will go
10 The Supreme Court. this trial will be set aside,
the assinine plea that cannot be put in
peril OF his life twice for the crime, will
again be urged. and Cora will be free.


These proceedings will all take time, and
by the period when the events we have lore
slladowed occur, the murder of Gen. Richardson
may be so far cast in the shade by other matters.
that it will require an effort of memory the
part of many TO recall it. Be this it may, we
hope there is sense of Justice in this commuil-
ity which will not allow the murderer escape.
even though the law may declare hum free. II
he is prored gully the trial of the murder

are no friend 10 Lynch Law, except as dernier
resort. But when guilt is unquestonabe, and
the law fails to punish after ample opportunity
has beeu given. the People who have sufficient
ly manifested their respect for The law by await
ing lis action, have the right TO make up for its
shortcomings. And in the event of Coras be-
ing proved guilty and fset free, such action be-

Everetts orstion at the Virginia University:


1T was proper that this great scholar should
speak in the public hall of the leading Southern
University 1t was more than well that every in
ducement should have been offered to the five hun
dred and ffty-odd young men of the University to
hear that grand oraton whose lessons of virtue and
deep devotion to the Union we're so well calculated
to make las we are glad to know they have done)
deep impressions for good upon the youthful minds
of the large number of students gathered together
at the University, and representing every South
ern State OF the C0nfederacy. Not those young
men alone, but older hearts we're made to feel
deeper and more intense love for our Union, and
for the Father Of his Country, than they had felt
for many long month, in these days of smbitter-
ed and unpropitious sectional strife We are con-
ident that could Mr.. Everetts Grafton be heard in
every section of this republic, that it would do more
to say the bitter sectional feeling now prevailing,
than all the speeches which viii be made in Con
gress or on the hustiDgs during the next two years


"" That one may form some idea OF the manner
in which Mr.. Everett's speech has been received,
we mention the fact that We met with several gen
tlemen who, having already heard the same speech
in Richmond, came from their homes in adjoining
and distant counties to hear Mr.. Everett's speech
once more""


1t is stated that at the earnest solicitation of
many virginians who have enjoyed the rare pleas
ure OF hearing Mr. Everett's lectures, he has con-
sented, should his health sustain him, to revisit
Virginia in short time, lin which event he will
lecture at Lynchburg,) extending bis tour through
several of the Southern States. The proceeds Of
all his lectures go to the fund for the purchase Of
Mount Vernon.


The Charlottesville Advocate says that, on Tues
day night last the students Of the University, in
body, serenaded Mr.. Everett in front Of Mr..
Schelle's pavilion. Indeed, the students and fac
ulty Of the University have taken every opportu-
nifty to express TO Mr. Everett their highest admi.
ntion Of him as scholar, statesman, orator and
patriot."

of a meeting held at Lynchburg, by the
perusai of which it will be seen that
the citizens of that place have deter
mined to put in their claims for the fu>
ture Capitol of Butte County. How
the people Of Lynclburg dare to act
thus after the blood and thunder an
nouncements from the few buildings To-
Gated near the ferry in Ophir township
and yclept Oroville, is matter of won
der to Us. If they only had water at
the little village near the Ferry we sup
pose they would inundate Lynchburg
for daring to present herself as candl-
date. 1t has been thundered forth BY
the organ of the Ophir Forty that the
contest was between Bidwell and them
selves. and yet Lynchbu~g seems not to
so understand the matter, and undis-
mayed, presents her claims for the pr'ze.
We believe with the gentlemen of the
Lynchburg committee, that they stand
just as good a chance for the county
seat as any other town, and if there is
anything in the bill, or in our free sys-
TEN of government, which prevents
them from entering the lists for the race
on the 10Th, We have failed to discover
it.


Oroville should now throw up her
claims and vote for Lynchburg, as they
have always stated that their principal
desire was to have the county seat re-
moved to some point of easier access
from the valley than Bidwell. The diff
ference between Oroville and Lynch

1t is by such arguments and assertions
that the removal scheme is sought to be

Those intere ted have waited long and
every other interest must now give way
to the spirit of speculation. The site
where Oroville now stands, was located
for a speculation, as early as 80, at
tine when laying out cities, on paper,

this bill fx""s the southern line of Butte
county at Hamilton, and leaves Oroville
the great geographical centre of the coun-
ty, within about eight miles Of the
southern line of the county, while it is
seven or eight times that di tance to
other portions of the county. This bill
has passed the Assembly, and had also
passed the Senate by vote of II to g..
\ motion to reconsider this vote was
laid upon the table, thus rendering fur
ther act OF of the Senate necessary
In all probability, this bill will become a
law previous to the election, and to Sc
lect Oroville for the County seat, is to
place it within less than one hours
drive of the southern and western boun-
daries, without regard to other sections,
because, as they openly avow, the north
has nowhere else to GO


1t is stated that many persons in
Forbestown are disposed to favor re-
moyal of the county seat TO Oroville, in
the hope that they may then be set off
into Yuba County. We know not how
much Importance to attach to this pro-
ject but we presume the business men
in Forbestown, do not seriously contep-
plate such move Butte Couaty is out
of debt-Yuba county owes over one
hundred thirty thousand dollars, and
would, doubtless, be pleased to have the
property holders of Forocstown become
responsible with them for its payment.
Persons residing at Forbestown and
having business at the county seat, can
make the trip to Bidwell and back in a
day, Remove it to Oroville, and a trip
from Forbestown to the county seat
would req lire two days. Forbestown,
we doubt not. viii so view the question,
and act as her interests shall dictate.

down river blusterer, which threatens TO
annihilate every place opposing them.


The electors should bear in mind that
in removing the county seat to Oroville
thy are placing it within the limits
of Spanish claim, and that neither the
county nor any our citizens, can acquire
titles to property in tn 1t vicinity. The
provision of the bill, which requires that
lot of land, containing the necessary
county buildings shall be donated to the
county free from all membranes or
claims whatever, cannot be complied
with, for the citizens of Oroyille have
no legal title to the land, and should they
donate lot to the county, the county
would still be obliged to purchase Of the

in the fence, when it learned as every bodywas
bound to know, that bill had been lntrodu-
ced into the Legislature authorizing the Board

place If the law is proper and just, it should
stand upon its own merits The bridge Will

the county seat is removed or not Neither

as an investment, either for individuals or the
county 1t is on the main thoroughfare to
the county to Plumas, and it is the best and
most practicable route. As to what is called
the JUNCTION Route, am now convinced, at
ter more thorough examination into the
matter, that is almost impracticable, and that
from what is called Jacks Ranch to Lynch


burg or 0royille, via the Junction, is farther
route than the one by Biiwe'l, TO the Nj
ner's Ranch, and from thence in direct line
to Lyuchburg, we have been told that an ad


mirable road can be made over that route;
which, in shortness and feasibility, is far more
practical able, if the interest of Lynchburg and
that part of the country desire such road
The road via the Junction, can subserve no


interest but that of sefsbness and spite, and
if 0roville should. 10y any means, be made the
county seat, we have not the least doubt but
that same spirit which dictated the sentiment
that il would have satisfaction against ""those
places which desire division, or that have
some local ambition to serve"" if they were
thwarted in obtaining what they were pleased
to cali their Just right, would induce them to
put the Junction road through, for the pur-
pose of injuring Bidwell, and ali of that por-
ton of the county that is in the immediate vi


entity OF the present Marysville roads. But,
to do this, everybody knows that if done it
ba ot bA of tba
county; and we look upon it as a scheme-a
speculation, that was and is designed to en-
hance the Town Lot Speculation that is being
so boldly played in tha; town. that threatens
in its wrath to cast seven or eight hundred
votes Ii the electors can be persuaded into
this scheme of aggrandizement and specula-
tion-they footing the bills, and the 0royil-
hans gathering the fruts-let il be SO.


We again say, that the bill authorizing the
purchase Of the Bidwcll bridge. mas nothing to
do with the issue before the people That it
is mot a dodge that might have been expected
from the pressure OF the times"" that it is Il
matter that, We feel conhlenf, that the stock


holders do not personally care u fig, whether
the county purchases the bridge or not, when
completed. The Californian says, admits, and
| presume the writer knows, that the ferry
proprietors have grown rich out Of the pro-
ceeds Of the ferry. Ii the ferry is profitable,
We see no reason why the bridge stock would
be bad investment. We are satisfied that
it is not. and that when that bridge is done,
as it most certainly will be this summer, that
it will be the best property in the county, and
the best investment that this county can
make, if the bill in question shall become a
law. The contract for the construction of the
bridge calls for such one, that when it is
completed, that it will be the best, strongest.
and most durable wire bridge in the State.


We cannot dismiss this subject without re-
moving the impression that the Californian
has sought to make upon the peoples mind in
regard to the bill We are advised that there
is nothing about this bill that is compulsory.
The Supervisors are not compelled to pur


chase, neither are the stockholders"" obliged
to sell If the Supervisors think that the in
vestment is bad one, why there IS an end to
the purchase; and if they should think that it
would be advisable to purchase-that ii would
be to the county interest to do so--we see
no reason why they should not possess the
power. Certainly it could do no wrong. An
other feature of the bill is, that if the proper
ty should be purchased, it authorizes the Su-
pervisors to have it kept as toll bridge, un-
til there shall have been paid into the county
treasury a sum that is equal to the amount of
the purchase money, and when this purchase
money shall have been paid, they can order


it to be kept as a toll bridge, for repairing
purposes or for the purpose of raising school
fund for this county. If it is not ordered for
some one of those three purposes, it is to be a
free bridge, and used as public highway
The idea. then, that it is to be tax upon
the county is Il humbug. The bridge, from


its own tolls, that will be paid into the county
treasury, will raise n sum that will indemnify
the county for the sum paid; and when it shall
have done that, it can be made toll bridge
to raise d school fund, which wonld dispense
with the necessity of the special tax that is
now levied upon property in this county for
that purpose. SO far, then. from its being an
unproductive purchase-a dead tax--the bill
contains those features which are highly ben
eficial to the county. Yet the Californian
thinks that it is an imposition. a trick, to au-
thorize the Supervisors to make this purchase


if they think it desirable, that the bridge may
eventually become FREE as public highway
and denoRnces it as base fraud, when it
provides the means that in the course of time
will create a school fund, that will largely as
sist in diminishing property tax, and In rails


ing fund to educate the youths in the coun-
ty 1t does appear to us that, so far from this
bill being materially wrong, it is essentially
right-one that all should be glad to see be-
come law. All, everybody, the Californian
will admit, that the bridges on all the great
thoroughfares should be free, when it can be
done without prejudicing the substantial
rights of others; that it is wise and proper that
we should build up an efficient school system,
supported by ample means. If this is conce-
ded, how can it be an imposition, fraud, to
authorize the Supervisors to make this pur-
chase, and one that everybody knows, that


knows anything about it, that is the very
best investment that this county can make
No wrong can grow out of such a law; it is not
compulsory; it is a matter of free choice and
will; designing TO give the county an opportu-
nifty of doing what every body wishes was done
throu2 hout the county--to establish free
bridges and free schools wherever it can just
ly be done. And yet, to make an effort to
attain this end, it is to be called ga dodge""
san imposition, ''a speculation"" We cannot
view the Californian in any other light than
as opposed to any and all systems Of legisla-
ton that will ultimately establish free bridges
and free schools in this county. These things
cannot be done without money, and we kno ""
no way in which they can be better done than
that proposed by the bill. We again say,
whether this bill be right or wrong, it has
nothing to do with the county seat question,
and to make it so, is a trick to give dignity
and Importance to place that has no other
merit than that of demerit, in abusing every
body that does not think 0roTille is the only
place in the county fitted for the county seat.

last weeks Californian, headed the ""Bidwell

charged:


Your committee appointed to confer with

vile for the purpose of effecting compromise
on the removal of the county seat at q point
mid way between Lynchburg and 0roville,
and select site for the same, respectfully
beg leave to report, that, after having met
and conferred with said committee from Oro-
vile, first at 0roville and second at Lynch
burg. your committee failed to effect any com
promise at all satisfactory to themselves, or
in any way just and equitable to this conmu
nifty.


Your committee would further state that
said delegation from Orovile refuse any other
compromise than that this place be required
on the coming election for the removal of the
county seat, to cast its vote for 0roville, and
in case said place received majority of votes
in this county, then the citizens Of Oroville
would fix the site Of said county seat at Cen
treville, or at some place mid way between
the above named towns Your committee
could not consent to any such proposal for the
following reasons:

liens of said town to remove the site of the
county seat after it had been fixed at Oroville

ID Although the above proposition may
have been conceived with the utmost sincer-

that it would be exceedingly difficult to con-
vince you Of the fact.


Your committee would further state that
they are fully satisfied that there cannot be
any compromise between this place and 0ro-
vile, other than an unqualified promise aud
obligation on the part OF this place to vote for
0roville.


And in conclusion, your committee would
further state that, on careful examination
Of all the facts in the premises, and from in

Observance of the Sabbath.",,"tians Sabbath"" A good idea Of the inten
and meaning of the bill will be obtained b
observing the following quotation from tn
first section:


SECTION l. That if any person Of tn
age of fourteen years and upwards, shall b.
found ON the first day of the week, commonl,
called Sunday, sporting rioting, quarrelhg
hunting, fishing, shooting, or at any common
labor or at any ordinary business pursuits O
life, works of necessity and charity excep
ted) he or she shall be fined in a sum not ex
ceeding ten dollars, nor less than five dollars
for each and every offense, with costs oi
suit


Then follow the necessary exceptions to
the rule, enumerating particular duties that
persons shall have the right to perform on
the Sabbath day. 1t is also provided that
nothing herein contained shall be construed
to extend to those who consciently do observe
the seventh day of the week as the Sabbath""
meaning that if Israelites observe Satur-
day and keep it holy"" they shall not be
compelled to observe the Christian Sabbath.


With Mr.. Fiske's bill as q whole, we are
not entirely satisfied. 1t may be improved
and we trust will be- No law should be
passed until il is made as nearly perfect as
possible, in order that there may be no bar
rier to its enforcement. This should be par
ticularly the case with reference to Sab
bath law in California. The ingenuity Of
lawyers has rendered virtually null and void
almost every moral reform act on the Statute
books of this State; and in this important
instance legislators should so digest and
amend the act that there may be no possible
mode of avoiding its righteous provisions.


There is probably no man in California,
however abandoned, who does not feel that
the present wholesale desecration of Gods
spointed holy day is foul blot on the fair
fame of the State The command from on
High cannot be mis-interpreted-""S Six days
shalt thou labor and do all thy work but
the seventh day is the Sabbath Of the Lord
in it thou shalt not do any labor"" &c. Is it
not then sin for individuals to disobey this
law ? No one will deny the proposition. If
an individual sins in disobeying a law of God,
do not governments Qor governments are
made up of Individually sin in committing the
same act We can see no difference in the
propositions; and are therefore driven ire
sistibly to the conclusion that government
should provide for the observance of the Sab
bath. How can any government expect to
prosper when it disobeys the unmistakable
command of the Most High? Does not the
history of California-the criminal records in
our courts of justice, the corruption that has
time and again crept into almost every de-
partment Of the government, the newspaper
accounts of horrible murders and tragedies,
the miserable uncertainty of the law in the
detection and prosecution Of crime the ac-
knowledged majesty of Judge Lynch--we say
does not the history of California furnish
terrible example Of the stubborn fact that
government refusing to listen to the COM
mands of Deity cannot prosper? We should
not lose the benefit of this dear-bought expe-
rience. 1t has cost too much already; let us
accept it without further expense.


Let the observance of the Sabbath be uni
versal, and no man will suffer pecuniarily in
consequence. Moreover, every man requires
day of rest-the body requires it, and the
mind should be relieved at least once week
of oil business aud pecuniary excitement
Who does not recoIlect the Sabbath at
home""-the music Of the church-going bell,
the instruction receiyed-the benefits deriv-
ed from the good old custom Of observing the
Lords sacred day? Who would rear up
children without impressing upon their minds
that there is Sabbath, and that it should be
observed? No one, we should think, would
desire to SO bring up their offspring, and yet
children are being brought up in that way in
California.


Let the present Legislature pass good,
wholesome, well-perfected Sabbath law. The
members will not only fulfil their duty, but
they will likewise receive the thanks Of the


present soyereigns, and the blessing OF the II


sing generation when the youth of our Stat


shall have arrived at years of maturity.

the lynching of Brady at Lexington, thus
touches up the editor of the Louisville Courr-

We know nothing about Mr.. Brady or his
principles, but we know, and have heard much
OF, one w. N. Haldeman, who has written
more in favor of Abolitionisna than we ever die,
although he has not seen near so many frosts.
How did it happen that he was never tarred and
feathered, while day after day he was dissent
mating his pestient heresies against the pecu-
liar institution, and in its very midst? We
venture to say he has committed more sin
against slavery in one hour Of his life, than
Brady did during his whole residence in Ken
lucky. Out upon the renegade and hypo-
crte."

been gradually working in the feelings and
opinions of our citizens, the two murders
which have occurred within the county du-
ring the last two weeks are striking IN
stances. Two or three years ago had
tyo lust such murders occurred, summary
punishment under the rules and regulations
of Judge Lynch's court would most assured
"" have been attempted, and quite likely
carried out; but now, we are proud of being
able to set forth the fact that, although in
both these cases the circumstances attending
them were Of a most atrocious and punish
cnt-descryiHg nature, yet the people OF
Weayeryille (where the first murder was
committed, and Of Canon Creek (where
the second tragedy was enacted, manifested
not the slightest indication or desire to en-
force speedy punishment on the guilty by the
rules of the court aforesaid; on the contrary,
the prisoners charged with these offences
were promptly delivered into the custody of
the proper authorities.


Although praise should not be given to
any person or community for doing their
duty, or for obeying the laws of the land
which they through their representatives
have made for their own government, never
theless, in California the practice Of thus dis
posing of persons guilty Of crimes Of this ma
ture is SO general, and people have become SO
used to regarding this course as absolutely
necessary, and, indeed, part of their duty,
that the allowing a legal investigation to
proceed uninterrupted becomes rather the
exception than the rule. We therefore con
gratulate our citizens upon this evident man

Having suffered for many years past with weak
ness of The eyes, and that defect of vision which re-
suits from too constant and intense use Of these
sensitive organs, we were led to make trial of To-
oass new and improved discovery for the eyes, whose
name heads this article. We saw them recommend
ed by sundry gentlemen of Virginia, whom we know,
and therefore had less hesitation in making the ex-
pertinent. We are more rhan pleased with the arss-
cle We read with less fatigue with these lens than
any we had ever tried before; and we see more dis
hnety with them. Without meaning to disparage the
claims of others, who have made improvements in

 The sheriff had, so far succeeded in main- taining the law, and in protecting the prisoners, but it was deemed very doubtful whether the passions of the multitude could be stayed last night. We shall not be surprised to learn that still further violence had been perpetrated.

 The same paper of the 18th has the follow ing.

 We recounted in our issue of yesterday the tragedy enacted near Marion, Crittenden county Arkansas, and probability that the mob would have recourse to lynch law. We learn from Esq Spain, of Hope6eld that the mob made an attack upon the jail last evening, with crow. bars and pick axes, and having forced an en. trance, man named Jenkins, Cousin of the murdered man, discharged the contents of two pistols and shot gun into the cell (through tbe bars) where D. Hendricks the man charged with the commission of the murder, was con hned-without effect, however. The door of the prisoners cell was then forced, and Dr. Blair, represented as leader of the crowd, was knocked senseless by Hendricks, who, armed with a piece of scantling inflicted a wound upon his head four or five inches in lenoth Hendricks was taken from his cell and led tn the edge of the woods near the lake, where ha was told that he only had five minutes to live and to make his peace with his Maker. Mr. H.s wife clunS to him, and appealed to those in the mob who appeared intent upon depriving her husband of life, to give him a fair trial by jury of his countrymen. She said, ["" the court of Crittenden county will meet on the secold Monday of May, when you can try my hus band for the crime of murder, and if you can convict him by the evidence which will be ad duced, hang him."" Mrs. H.'s appeal had it's effect upon the group assembled and her hus band was taken back to jail, where yesterday, at three o'clock, he remained

 John Garrett, formerly resident of this city, was on trial yesterday afternoon, before Esq, Peeler, of Marion, as an accessory to the murder, and we learn that strong evidence was produced to criminate him.

 There were fears entertained that another at tack would be made upon the jai and that both Hendricks and Garrett would be summarv dealt with by the enraged populace.

 Mr. Jenkins, the murdered man, was one of the most respec able citizens of Crittenden county, and the deepest regret and indignation is felt at his sudden and bloody death MT. J leaves wife and daughter to mourn his me- lancholy fate, besides host of other relations and friends. We expect to give further part- cuars of this sad affair

San Joaquin Republican publishes a portion
of a letter dated Kern River, March Goth, as
follows:


Capt Maltby is now engaged in erecting
his machinery for crushing quartz, at Kern
River Mr. Reese, the oldest quartz miner
in this part of the country, says his ledge
has paid him twenty ounces to the ton OF
rock for the last four months. He is now
using four drostras. Snowdon IL Co. have
been working their quartz ledge five weeks
during which time they have extracted
1886 to the ton of rock Lynch &Williams
claim has paid about 500, and the Messrs.
Harmon apout Sl60 per ton. The two latter
companies are new beginners and lnexperl-
enced, and think they will do better after
a while. The Lightener has been yielding
fair wages and | understood their rock has
improved very much within the last week.
Gatewood q Co. have very rich claim; they
have just commenced grinding, and their
prospects are as good as the best. Bradshaw
Il Co. have the largest vein in the country;
it is about five feet thick, and pays cents
per pound With one arasta in five weeks,
thew have taken out $l.700. A large num-
Der of quartz veins are now being prospected
and | think, from appearances, that within
two months not less than one hundred
arastras will be at work here. Capital to
erect machinery is all that is required to
make this the most productive quartz mining
country in the State We have good water
proof power, and all the veins are in the
vicinity of the river There are twenty
quartz leads here to where there is one III
the northern mines, and nnty-nlne out OF
the hundred will pay better than the best
of theirs.


N,~ Orrcrs11vER MrxE-While at the
city of San Jose the present week, we were
presented by VIM. Forst, Esq, with a very
handsome specimen of cinnabar from this
mine. From him we learn that the mine
indicates great prosperity to the proprietors
and the specimen presented us is of great
richness and beauty. The mine is called the
Guadaloupe Quicksilver Mine, and is situated
at the western extremity of the same range
of hills with New AImaden. 1t is approach
ed from San Jose by an excellent carriage
road, and the distance is about nine miles.
The mine was worked for few months in
1850, but work was suspended for want Of
funds. A new company, in Baltimore, Mary
land is now actively engaged in opening the
mine and arranging for immediate construc-
ton of furnaces. The work thus far has ex-
posed large quantities of cinnabar and of
the best quality. About thirty men are at
work and this number is soon to be increased.
The works are under the superintendent Of
Eben Faxon, Esq, who came to California
for the purpose of taking charge of the open
ing and development Of the mine.

vIIIE-The Marposa Gazette contains the
following particulars in relation to the lyneh-
ing affair at Coultervile:


In another part Of our paper we noticed
the murder of Mr.. Conway in the streets at
Coulterville, on Tuesday last, without provo
cation of cause, by Chleno named Pancho,
who Immediately fed. Through the polite
ness of Jack Metson, mail carrier, we are III
formed of acts of the people of that place
which have followed, as the consequences OF
the commission of this most foul murder.


Immediately after the shooting of Conway,
parties were organized and commenced to
scour the country in pursuit of the murderer
On Wednesday, one Of these parties came
upon three ChilenoS, companions OF Pancho
two were shot, and one Alvarado was brought
into town, tried by Lynch law and hung. IT
is also said that a number more have been
shot. One party who have penetrated to the
head of the North Fork, sent in an express
last night for more men stating that they had
eorralled Pancho, but we have no particulars
further.


Last night the people held mass meeting
appointed Vigilance Committee, and
resolved to expel all who were caught within
ten miles, after the expiration of twelve
hours were to receive not less than thirty
lashes.


Another resolution forbids the opening o
the Fandango house again; and a sub
scriptiOn was opened to assist the Sons o
Temperance in purchasing it."

tai Importance to the people of this State,
which if carried into effect will accomplish
more towards giving stability and confidence
in our laws than any other measures that
could be adopted at this time. Judge Ill
ford has introduced bill in the Senate
amending the criminal act and laws in rea-
tion to crimes and punishmcnts, and creating
a remedy for offences made criminal by the
act heretofore unknown to our statutes
The most important of the amendments is
in relation to manslaughtcr This crime IS
punished by imprisonment in the State prs-
on for term not exceeding three years and
fine not exceeding five thousand dollars
The amendment lengthenS the time to a
term not exceeding fourteen years. Tbs is
a most wise and salutary change, and es-
pecally as the death penalty IS aidxed to the
crime Of murder How many persons have
been acquitted uf the crime Of murder for
the want Of a proper punishment being fixed
by Jaw for the crime Of manslaughter. Ju-
rieS viii not convict of murder unless the
proof is positive and admitting Of not a
doubt, and to convict of fmanslaughtor, which
they have a right to do under our statute,
is making a farce Of Judicial proceedings
Sending an individual to the State Prison
for three years for Tie highest crime known
to our laws is SO supremacy ridiculous that it
is seldom done This one provision in our
laws has gone very far in making up the
black page Of our States history in relation
to mob-law 1t is to be hoped that Judge
Tilford will be successful in obtaining the
passage Of the bill into law. Another i'm
portant amendment is abolishing the death
penalty, Or in other words, leaving it to
the discretion Of the jury to imprson in the
State Prison for life, which amounts tonear-
Iy the same thing as abolishing the death
penalty entirely. If these amendments be
come law, as we sincerely hope they may
the guilty will not go unwhipped Of justice
rs heretofore, confidence viii be restored to
the Courts and the laws of our State, and
the disgraccful acts of Judge Lynch will
cease TO exist among us.


a bill has been introduced into the House
by Mr.. Rhodes, dividing the State into Con
grcssional Districts This should have been
done years ago. An effort was made at the
session Of '55 but it failed We hope it will
not receive the same fate at the hands of the
present Legislature The act of Congress
requires it, justice TO the people Of the State
requires it; why then delay the matter any
longcr?-argument is unnecessary to prove
the justice Of the measure, or the public sen
timent in relation to the subject The Leg
isiature should go one step further and say
that the election Of members Of Congress
shall take place at the general election I'M
mediately preceding the term for which they
are chosen The House of Representatives
was intended by the Constitution to repre-
sent the people. In order to carry out this
provision Of tae Constitution the representa-
tiycs must come direct from the people, 1t
would not be straining point to say that
in more than one instance in this State we
would have had a different delegation in
Congress from those representing us, had
the election taken place one year later We
say let the election take place at the proper
time, certain politicians to the contrtry not
withstanding.


If the Legislature passes a few acts of Il
general interest to the State and effect an
early adjournment, they will receive the APP
probation Of the people of California

Our attention has been called tolan ar.
ticle in the St. Louis 1ntelligencer of the
25th ultimo, with the above caption, writ
ten by a correspondents who signs the eu-
phonious name of Choptank."" The char
acter Of the St. Louis Intelligencer is so
well known, that we justly lay ourselves
open TO censure by noticing any of their
filthy and abortive attempts to SANDER US.
In this instance, we merely attempt 10 cor
rect any impressions which the falsehoods
contained in that article might cause to be
formed, did we pass it unnoticed.


The writer sets out by charging that we
were /"" born in Massachusetts; that we
are the - instigator Of mobs."" and gives US
credit for the lynching of erery abolition-
list who has been fortunate enough to meet
his deserts In the Territory. He also
makes other charges which are so utterly
void OF truth. that it would be gratifying
the perjured scamp too much to notice them.
He also offers US, g free, gratis, for moth
ing"" .tdear' of advice, which in the alb
stract we have no objection to; but advice
coming from such source we scorn and
repudiate. Let it not be thought that the
rote of neral degradation was ever drawn





so close about us, or that we had strayed
so far from the pales of honor, that We
could be benefited by receiving admonition
from the Ioathsome objects of moral stencil
and putrificatlon that cater for that infam-
GUS abolition sheet, the ST. Louis Intelli-
gencer. In relation to the charge that we
were "" born in Massachusetts"" we en-
phatically deny it, and brand the author as
a COWARD, a BASE cALUMHIAToR, and a
WILLFUL LIAR. We can stand any,
thing but heing called Yankee, and take
such language, when applied TO us, as
grievous insult If the author Of Chop
tank be gentleman, which we very much
doubt, he will favor us with his name, and
if he be not coward indeed, he will no
longer attack US under cover of an anony-
nous signature. We were born in Fred

done for effect. Our 6 limited circulated""
paper, which Choptank"" has termed lhe
Squatter Sovereign, is dreaded. by the abo-
litionists, and they have therefore attempt
ed to destroy its usefulness by charging
upon one of its editors Yankee birth. II
we for moment thought that drop OF
Yankee blood ran through our veins, we
should let it out, even though our life were
sacrificed in SO doing. We hope this de-
claration will convince Choptank, that he
was badly posted whenhe charged that we
We're 'born in Massachusetts,


In relation to the many other charges,
we have this to say, that we do not claim
the honor of suggesting the numerous
plans adopted by our friends for the rid
dance of freesoilers from this Territory
but we do endorse every act that has been
done. from the submerging Of the Park
vile Luminary to the last outrage perpe-
trated"" We 90 in for a war of exterini-
nation against the lawless nullifiers and
negro-stealers now infesting this Territory
and when occasion offers we will show our
love for Northern blood, by causing it TO
flow in profusion to enrich our soil. We
know something Of the character of the
Northern people. and a residence OF three
years among them, in our school boy days,
has convinced us that more selfish, med
dlesome and traltorous class Of humans
does not exist. They are entirely too ieal-
GUS 20 be honest, and their unwarrantable
interference in the domestic affairs of the
South, should satisfy the most skeptical
that our charges are well-founded.


But we have no desire to notice further

tank, hut must express our conviction tha,
