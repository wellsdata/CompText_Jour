ST. LOUIS, May 4.-By application just made
by some of the diplomatic corps, at Washington,
on the State department., the following points
were ascertained First-Vessels in the blocka-
ded ports before the blockade was effected, will
be allowed reasonable time to depart Second
Vessels bringing emigrants, though they had no
notice of the blockade at the time of their de-
parture, will not be allowed to enter the blocka-
ded ports. That class of persons come to the
United States chiefly by the States on the Mssiss-
ippi river, and it will be better for them to enter
an open port, than to encounter the injuries and
casualties incident to the insurrecton.


dispatch from Raleigh, N. c., says the Leg
islature met yesterday. A bill was introduced
callinga ""a Convention to assemble the goth of May
1t was passed, unanimously. There was no ref
erence made of the result of its action on the
people. The Southern Confederacy flag is flying
over the Capitol North Carolina is virtually
out of the Union. The Governor says in his
message: The Northern Government is now
concentrating q large force in the District of
Columbia, ostensibly to protect the seat of Gov
ernment, but such force cannot be allowed to
remain within the limits of Maryland or on the
borders of Virginia, without endangering the
liberties OF the people of those States and if they
be conquered and overcome, We will become the
next prey to the invaders. The policy therefore,
as well as a feeling of brotherhood, increased by
common interest requires US to exert our ener-
gies in defense of Virginia aud Maryland. Every
battle fought there will be battle fought in be-
half of North Carolina, and therefore troops
should be speedily sent.


The Petersburg Express of yesterday says that
a Kentucky regiment of 400 men are on their
way to Lynchburg. The Governor has deter
mined TO station large number of troops at
! Petersburg.


The Charleston Courier of Tuesday, says =
we learn from reliable source, that President
Davis will take command in person as G eneral
inchief Of the forces gathering in Virginia.

From information, said to be reliable, it is as
certancd that Virginia herself, does not mediate
an attack on Washington The subject being for
a consideration of the Confederate States The
introducing of troops into Virginia is said to be
in anticipation Of the declaration of war by Con
gress, it was expected that the large gather
ing in Washington ultimately intended to invade
the South.

In the Maryland Legislature yesterday, the
committee on Federal Relations made report
on the subject of communication from the mayor
of Baltimore, in relation to restoration Of rail
road communication between Baltimore and
other points. The following is an abstract. The
committee considered interruption Of travel an
aggravated evil but if facilities for invasion are
offered to fana:ical and excited multitudes from
the North, who publicly threaten our destruction,
it could hardly be consistent with prudence to
open channels to communicate with the Northern
States. They cannot be efficiently re-established
without guarantee from some quarter for safety
and peace. The report then speaks of the course
of the General Government in stationing troops
| at Annapolis, and seizing the road to Washing
ton, and considers such a as treating them
as IA conquered province. 1t is therefore the
duty Of the Legislature to ascertain the position
which the General Government determined to
pursue towards the State. The committee con-
cludes with the following resolution =


ROsolred, That there be appointed commission
ers to confer with President Lincoln, with regard
to the present and any proposed military Occu
patton of this State by the General Government
Also, to ascertain whether any arrangements are
practicable 10 maintain the peace and honor Of

As an evidence of exaggerated statement,
one of the journals quotes from the report Of
the State Fair of California, for 1865, in
which were exhibited among other prodigies
a beet weighing 73 pounds carrot weigh
ing 10 pounds, and feet inches in length :;
""A corn stalk measuring 81 feet and inches
in height, and an apple measuring l59 inches
each way. Now, we all know here that
each one Of these prodigies has been exceed
ed in dimensions in this State. The Eu-
ropean and English journals, however, set
these statements down ""to that Cyclopean
grandeur Of description in which American
fancy is apt TO indulge


The English papers do not acknowledge
that California is as rich in her gold products
as Australia How far the improvements in
quartz crushing DC. may tend to counteract
the decrease in the available surface deposits
they don't know. Well, the improvements
in quartz crushing, the shaltng, the tunnel
ing and the hydralcug have placed Cnlifor-
MIA 1--WE can tell those papers, far ahead OF
Australia and the business men Of the word
know it.


These journals furthermore say that Cali
fornia is not progressing as has been repre-
scnted.


""Do what she will she cannot attract i'm
migration to her shores, now that the gold
fever has for the present passed away. She
does not afford a field of labor attractive to
the civilized and orderly portion Of mankind.
The first check to her astonishing career was
given in 1851, when the discovery of gold in
Australia carried off at once n considerable
part of her restless mining population. Many
of them no doubt returned, disheartened by
their i'll success in n region where, though
the deposits are some"" hat richer than In
California, the labor of extraction is said to
be somcW hat greater; others, as our Annal
lists haze the audaciy TO declare, 'disgusted
with the moral contamination of working be-
side the convicts of Van DiAmen's Land and
New South Wales Still the drain westward

ever since n serious drawback California,
AT the close of 1858, contained about 35o,-
GOO inhabitants, of whom about one-hith
were females. In the last three Yeas, ac-
cording to Mr.. Seyd, she has received scarce
ly any addition to her population.' The
stream of emigration seems, for the present,
to have been elfectually diverted across the
Pacific. Seyd's book is written expressly for
the purpose of restoring it to his own state
and in a region where, as he tells us, Many

wise; even to the toughest class of inmi-
grants there are some general wants beyond
those OF mere nature; and they, too, have
a sense that security, order, and civilization
are not objects of entire Indifference. Social
Improvement has, we believed, begun; but
years must elapse before California redecms
her character from the memories OF stuffed
ballot-boxcs, Vigilance Committees and re-
sdectabe citizens pulling at one end of a
rope which was strangling some wretched
being murdered under the hap-hazard YER
diet Of a Lynch jury""


Now, we in California know well enough
what estimate to put upon English and Eu-
ropean prejudice. We know that the days of
Vigilance Com mittees and lynch law have
passed that emigration is steering annually
to our shores that social improvement is
moving on with a steady step; that security,
order, the protection of life and property,
and The general benefits of civilization exist
and are extending.


Notwithstanding all the efforts of the Eng
lish Gov ernment to bring out the resources
of Australia, that country lags behind Cali
fornia in her gold and her agricultural pro-
ducts."

States sgainst John Foley, convicted of the
murder of Michael Murphy, and brought up to
this court by a writ Of error, was taken up yes.
terday, and argued by Mr.. CarringIon, the Dis.
trict Attorney, for the prosecution, and by
Messrs. Norris and Thrift for the defence.


The case was opened for the defence by Mr..
Thrift, who argued at considerable length to
show the justice Of the prayer offered by the
defence in the court below, 6nd which had
then been refused, viz: that if the Jury enter.
tained reasonable doubt Of the defendants
sanity at the time of the commission Of the
homicide, he ought to be acquitted, the excep
ton being based upon the refusal to grant this
prayer. He contended that it was incumbent
upon the prosecution to prove the sanity Of the
party charged, and quoted numerous high au.
thorities TO sustain the position.


Mr.. Darlington followed for the prosecution,
contending that the doctrine that the jury must
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt Of the
prisoners sanity, before they could convict, was
q modern heresy. The 0nus probundi was
upon the party disputing the presumption Of
sanity, which is the normal condition of the
human mind. He referred to a number Of au.
thorities in support of this proposition, and
maintained that the principle for which he con.
tended was founded upon principle and au.
thority.


Upon the conclusion of Mr.. Carringtons re.
marks, Mr.. Norris addressed the court in be.
half Of the defendant, and contending for the
justice of the instructions asked for in the court
below.


The court held the case for consideration,
and will give decision before the adjournment
Of the term.


APPoINTNENT.-Marshal Lamon has appoint.
ed Anon Duvall guard at the jail, in place Of
N. g. Sanderson, removed.


FIRE.-The alarm Of FIRE, yesterday morn.
ing, was caused by the burning of the store
and residence Of Mr.. John Watt, on the corner
Of Twenty second and G streets. The sentinel
posted on the opposite corner, at the quarters
Of the Watson Guards, Captain Calan, gave
the alarm, and the company Immediately went
to work. They succeeded in not only saving
nearly the entire furniture, but also Mrs. Watt
who was not aware OF her danger until the door
Of her room was broken open by Lieutenant
Dobson. The Dodd Rifles, of Massachusetts,
rendered valuable service with the apparatus
Of the Union fire company. The Zouaves were
also early on the ground with the Columbia.
Communicated.


MR. EDIToR: Never before was the total in
efficiency of the police force of this city more
strongly exempli6ed than upon the occasion
Of the shooting Of young Howard, few nights
since. Upon that OCCASION the police force
proved themselves entirely inadequate to the
performance of their legitimate duties-i. e..
the preservation of the peace Of the city. Il
was owing entirely to the efforts Of the military
and not the civil authorities, that the peace o.
the city was preserved. The efforts put il
force on that occasion were by the members O
company d, Of the eighth Massachusetts regi
ment, and especially by Lieut.. Frazier of thai
company, whose promptness prevented the cit
izens and military present from lynching the
offender.

is not startling or definite. There were rumoEs
at Perryvle of a skirmish between United States

Fort McHenry has been still further re-
enforced; 1000 men are now there. Gen.

There appears to be some reason to fear that

A messenger sent from Gov. Hicks of Mary

are anxious to march upon Washington, and
that if this movement is not made the officers
will have difficulty in retaining them.


The work of preparing for tho blockade goes

1t is said that three thousand applications

vermin of the black flag as thickly as do those

bly, soon have a beneficial effect.


A number of small sailing vessels upon the

There are presses, for the most part in
the border States, though some of them are
found in cities more remote from the scene
of action, which are daily pleading the cause
Of the enemy, misreprescnting and YiIlily-
ing the Government of the United States,
exaggerating every article of unfavorable
intelligence, and exerting themselves to the
utmost to dishearten the friends aud defend
ers of the Constitution and the Union. But
such is the all but superstitious devotion
of the people to the liberty Of the Press,
that these peruicious journals have, with the
exception OF a single instance il St. Louis,
never been inteyfered with. It seems to
have been thought better by those in author
itv TO tolerate the mischief Of these unpat-
rotic presses, than to elevate them to great
er Importance by prosecution, or to en-
croach in tie slightest degree ppon that
freedom Of public discussion which in ordi-
nary times is justly regarded as one Of the
greatest safeguards ofIiberty. BUTT is pre-
posterous to sacrifice the end to the means.
We should in this respect learn wisdom
from the enemies Of the Union. While we
regard as unbecoming our Christian ciyiH-
z?tion that resort to Lynch law, by which
every expression of opinion adverse to the
popular sentiment IS suppressed in the Sc
cedjng States, we ought to remember that
in tolerating traitorous Press among our
selves; We practice aliberaIity which awak-
ems no gratitude at home, and is never re-
ciprocated by the opposing party.


1t is, in fact, an absurdity in terms, under
the venerable name Of the liberty of the
Press, TO permit the systematic and .icen
1ious abuse of Government which is
aasked to the utmost in defending the coun-
try from general disiatcgra,ion ana politi-
cal chaos. The Governor Of Malta was once
censured in Parliament for some alleged Sc
verify towards the editor of journal in
that island. and the liberty of the Press was
declared to be in danger The Dake Of
Wellington said he was as friendly as asy-
body to the liberty Of the Press in London,
but a free press in the Island Of Aalto was
as much out of place as 1t would be on the
quarterback Of man-of-war. We suppose
the most enthusiastic champion OF the ill
erty ofthe press would hardly think 1t eight

 From Capt. Pritchard gather the following: On Tuesday last, Col.

 Wright of the Georgia regiment, started for that place. On reaching the point of destination the Georgia troops prepared to land to the north

 ward of the enemy, while Col. Shaw was sent south twelve miles to cut off their retreat. The steamers with the Georgian could not otapproach nearer than half 8 mile to the shore, and the gallant fellows Were soon in the water in full sweep for the foe. Owing tO the depth of water.

record q most distressing affair which occurred
about 81 o'clock last night, resulting ia the
shooting and killing of young man by the
name of John H. Howard, q private in the
Metropolitan Rifles.


1t appears, from what We have been able TO
learn, that young Howard, in company with
several other soldiers, was arrested on q charge
Of disorderly conduct on the Island, and were
being taken to the Central guardhouse by Po.
licemen Frederick A. Neitze, Thomas Holden,
Samuel Byer, and Richard Howe, by way Of
Four, ,and.a.hslf street bridge and Pennsylva.
MIA avenue. When opposite Browns Hotel,
Howard attempted to escape from the officer
having him in charge, and, breaking the hold
Of the officer, ran across the street in the di.
rection of the hotel. The officers all started
in pursuit, following him across the street.
Howard, seeing them in pursuit, endeavored
to conceal himself behind some hacks stand.
ing in front Of the hotel but Just as he got
round between one of them and the curb, a
pistol was fred from one Of the officers, and he
fell dead, without uttering a single word.


Officers Byer, Howe, and Neitze, Immediately
proceeded to the Central Guard house and gave
themselves up; and officer Holden was also ar.
rested soon after, and taken to the Guard house,
where preliminary examination was had be





revealing the above facts. Pistols were found
upon all the officers, but it could not be deter.
mined who fred the fatal shot. Upon the con.
clusion Of the examination, the four officers were
all committed to jail to await a further exam.
instion which will be held this morning.


The deceased is q young man, about twenty.
three years Of age, q carpenter by trade, and
resided on Fourth street, between l. and M.
He was great favorite with the members of
his company, and much liked by oil who knew
him.


The affair created the most intense excite.
ment in the vicinity where it occurred, particu.
larly among the military, many Of whom were
in favor of lynchipg the parties charged with
the homicide; but cooler counsels prevailed, and
the law was allowed to take its course.


The TWELFTH RroIxESr IN franklin
SoUARE.-The twelfth regiment, who have been
quartered in the Assembly Rooms and old
Trinity Church since their arrival in this city,
marched out to their newly-erected quarters
yesterday morning and took up their abode.
On the northern portion Of the square, fifty.
four buildings have been erected for the &C.
commodation Of the men. They are arranged
in clusters Of six, with space between them.
The men have given names to the lanes be-



to the different buildings. The lanes have had
Ryder avenue, Rue de Boyle, Fifth avenue,
and Third street. Most Of the houses have
also received names from the occupants |;
among them we notice the following Ryder
House, Hotel de Union, Continental Hall, In.
dependence House, Butter6eld Cottage, Oui
well Place, Hotel de Peanuts, and Pro Patria
House.


The houses for the officers arc situated on
the edge of the square, facing southwark, with
the ColonePs quarters in the centre. The
houses for the officers number about twenty.
The buildings for the band, engineer, and
drum corps, are on the space fronting the off.
GERS quarters. The guardroom has been built
on the southern side Of the square. The
kitchens have been erected on the square op.
posite, some distance from the quarters.


The building has two rows of hunks on each
side, and no doubt the men will soon feel
themselves at home in them.


This regiment expect to receive their new
Chasseur uniform to-day. 1t consists of a
lightb blue cap, with dark.blue band short.
skirted coat, with slit in each side, trimmed
with white full light blue psntaloons, trim.
med with white, the bottoms being gathered
in and encased in buff leggings.


Franklin square will soon be one of the most
attractive spots Of the city.


KINDNESS TO OUR MILITARY GUrsrs.-In
the course of the exercises at the regular
prayer meeting at the Fourth Presbyterian
Church, on Tuesday evening, Rev. J. G. Smith,
pastor, incidentally remarked, in substance


""a number of the ladies of this church
have, yesterday and to-day, gathered together
quantity Of clean under-garments, and other
things conducive to comfort, and presented
them to members of the Pennsylvania regi.
ment, now quartered at the Inauguration Ball
Room. This Is kind, and these men 80 esteem
it. They are good, worthy, sensible, and in.
telligent men. have been among them, and
know them. Many Of them left their fields,
and other places Of labor, at a moments no.
tice, bringing away nothing but the clothes
upon their persons, being told that provision
would be made for them at Harrisburg. But
this was mistake and they arrived in this
city in great discomfort. 1t is only Just now
that their stores have been received. They
fully understand and most warmly appreciate
the kindness Of these ladies in all that they
have done. 1t is in the power Of all of US to
do much for the soldiers Of the noble army
now here for our protection and we should
not omit this duty. There are sterling men in
all these ranks, and we should reciprocate
good for good with them. Let us minister, SO
far as we can, to their physical comfort and
welfare. Let us also seek, as members of the
church Of Christ, to confer upon them some
spiritual good. The opportunity is present to
US, and, however blind we may be to the course
Of the future, we cannot err when we faithfully
perform our present duties""

A MAN HANGED ny MoB-A mulatto man,
named Jacob Hamilton, was hanged by mob
at Smyrna, on Friday last. The circumstances
as they are given in the Sunday Dispatch, were
as follows MIR. John Cloak, an aged and
wealthy citizen, lives on the outskirts of the
town with his wife and two daughters. The
latter are aged respectively eighteen and twenty
years At haf-past eleven o'clock on Thursday
night, Mr.. and Mrs Cloak were awakened by loud
screams which issued from the room of the young
ladies' Mrs Cloak Immediately proceeded to
the apartment, when she was attacked by man
who was struggling with her daughters in the
dark.


Mrs. Cloak added her screams TO those of the
girls and MIR, c. at once hastened to her aid
lie, too, WAS attacked and beaten in shocking
manner. While the struggle was going forward,
npgro servant who slept in an out. building
procured ladder, and by placing it against the
window eill enabled the three ladies TO escape.
The intruder also got away and without being
recognized Ills object was evidently to vonte
the person Of one of the young ladies'


For several reasons it was believed that the
mulatiO Hamilton was the guilty party. He
was arrested on Friday morning carly, and taken
before magistrate in the town. From the evil
dence it seems that Hamilton was employed on
the farm OF mir. Cloak He had been at the
house the day previous, engaged in putting up
stoves. While there Il small toy, or some such
triBe, had been given him, and this article was
found in portion of the pocket of the intruder,
which had been torn off by Miss Cloak in the
struggle. There were other circumstances which
tended 10 convince the people of his guilt, nad.
IN intense excitement was the result.


The prisoner was of course committed to
answer the charge against him, and he was or
dered to lie conveyed to Dover Jail, few miles
distant. Hamilton was very powerful man.
and in order to guard against his escape while
on his way to prison his arms were pinioned
behind his back.


While the hearing and the trying were in pro
eress preparations were being made outside for
lynchng the prisoner. A rope was procured,
moose was made, and when the consiables made
their appearance in the street with their charge
the crowd gathered around, seized him and ran
him to beech tree on the banks of II mill-dam
at the edge OF the town. The rope was plnocd
around his neck, the other end was tied 10 an
outstretched limb of the tree and in few seconds
the poor wretch was dangling in the air.


All this took place in broad daylight, at half
past nine O'Clock in the morning, in the sight of
hundreds of spectators. Among the lockers on
there were probably two hundred females. No
person attempted to vndchte the outraged law.
Hamilton met his fate without nurmur or
struggle, While being hurried to the place of
execution he denied his guilt but it is said that
Just Mt the moment he was about being suspend
ed he confessed


The body was allowed to hang until four
o'clock in the afternoon, when it was cut down,
and n Corners jury was empanelled to inquire
into the manner in which the man had come to
his death After POSTING examination a
verdict was rendered to the effect that the de-
ceased had died from tue effects of straugula-
ton, the result of hanging inflicted by some per-
son or persons NohnorH 10 HE juTy!' II is prOba-
bic lllnt every man concerned in the hanging was
wsll known to the jurors, most of whom were
doubtless upon tho ground Mt the time


1t is said that nfter the hanging of the mulatto,
it was found that there was fresh gun shot
wound in one OF his legs, aud ball was found
in the wound. Mr. Cloak fired two pistol shots
at the intruder during the struggle in the dark,
and it is supposed one of the balls took tfTect-
There is but little, if any doubt, of the guilt Of
the poor wretch; but, in true lynch law style,
he was hanged frat ani tried afterwards.


Mr. Cloak was seventy-tWo years Of age on
Friday, and Hamilton had been ut the house the
day previous aiding in the preparations for
party in honor of the event which was to come
off on Friday night. The mulatto was TO have
been the principal waiter on the festive OCCASION
The deceased was unmarried and about twenty
eight years of age. He was man Of herouean
strength, II is said that he was charged with
similar attempt on n former occasion, and lie
escaped punishment at that time This fact
had much to do with deciding his tragic fate.

STEAM RRyRNUE CUTTER FOR THE DELLA
wARE.-The collector of tue port of pailadelpbia
has, we learn by the Press, invited proposals
from Twelve of the ship builders Of the city for
building steam revenue-cutter to cruise in

Said cutter is to be built either of wood or of
iron, but If of iron, then with water-tight com
paTtments. She is to he manned by from TWEEN

, as we'll as justice, demand that those who have
always been loyal and patriotic and have given

RICHMOND, August 23.--I regret TO be com.
PEELED to give you most unfirorable account
OF the health Of our troops now In the field.
The inaction of the several large bodies OF
men In different portions OF the Common
wealth, for three weeks past, must be attribu-
ted chiefly to the crowded state of their hospi-
tails. Ia the peninsula the typhoid fever has
been prevalent, though happily not in moig
nant form. At Manassas and Aqua Creek also,
this malady has prostrated q considerable
number. 10 Richmond, or rather in the camps
around 1t, fifty per cent. of the troops at least,
have been stricken down with measles. Private
hospitals for the reception and better treat.
ment OF the invalids have been opened from
day TO day, until every street, almost every
square Of the city, has its long sick list, and
the ladies ore worn out In their attentions to
the sufferers. They do not weary In the spirit
Of their good work; bus excessive watching
will exhaust the physical powers As yet
there has been no great fatality among the
thousands of cases, but just as soon as a dozen
have been discharged as we'll from an hospital,
their beds have been filed, and there is no
diminution In the number of new cases. Pos
sibly tho change of temperature of the fall
months may check the spread OF the disease,
and but few weeks remain to us now before
the frost.


THE HOSPITALS AT FREDERICKSBURG.


The hospitals here are crowded with sick
from the Carolina, Arkansas, and Tennessee
r, giments. The ladies here are occupied all
their time 10 attending the sick and In working
on the necessary clothing for their comfort.
Every thing else is neglected to provide for the
soldiers. N. o. Detd.


SICKNESS IN JoHNsoN's DIVISION.


Another correspondent Of the appeal, II. S.
Abernathy, captain OF company G, nineteenth
Mississippi regiment says, under date of Au.
gust ""a:


Since we pi,chd d our camp here, gloom and
sorrow have saddened the couutenances Of all,
owing to the distressing fact that disease and
death have prevailed among US. Our expose
condition during our camp on Bull RuD, and
the want Of proper iocd and water, was se-
rious blow to this regiment and to all-the
troops that were likewise unfortunate.


In proof of this, I will mention that out of
forty y-seven hundred in the brigade, only TWEEN.
ty.thrce hundred reported for duty on the goth
instant, aud companies that before ordinarily
turned out on drill and parade from sixty five
to ninety men, do not now turn out more than
eight and ten files per day. The hardships and
suffering consequent upon the movement of
Gen. Johnson's division OF the army, which re-
suited III such glorious success to our cause at
Manassas, has, dare say, prostratsd fully one
third OF his force Nearly every day the sound
OF niusketry proclaims the death of some
Southern hero, who has fallen victim to dis
ease in camp, and over whose grave blank car.
tridges are fired, as tho last military honor paid
to the dead.


The Richmond and Memphis papers Of the
9th, and Charleston and New Orleans of the
4tl, and Nashville Of the 9th instant, have been
received at Louisville, and furnish the sub
joined intelligence:


Sickness still ieariuly prevails in the rebel
army in Virginia. At Lynchburg, Richmond,
Frederi cksburg, and Leesburg, over five thou.
sand men are in the hospitals. The small pox
is raging violently. The medical authorities
publish urgent appeals to physicians through
out the rebel States to forward Immediately all
dispenseble vaccine matter to Richmond.


The soldiers from the Gulf States suffer
greatly from the cold nights in Northern vir-
ginia. Appeals for contributions of warm cloth.
ing appear iu all the leading papers.


The New Orleans fnarciers show consider
able unwillingness to receive Confederate treas.
ury notes at par. The Mobile banks resolved
to receive them in payment OF Indebtedness."

hontas, Of the Potomac feet gives the follow
ing The line Of batteries at Aqua Creek ex-
teEd about six miles. They croes the railroad
not fer from the depot, and extend, in one di
rection, as far as Potomac Creek, where there
ID another battery. These batteries are we'll

They have some large guns, and their practice

Some Of the guns are riGed, and they appear to

miles wide. The battery at the creek is under
the command of Capt Walker then there is a
battery of flying artillery, commanded by
Capt. Braxton, and another, lately from Rich.
nonl, which consists of six large pieces, one
of th:m rihsd, two howitzers, and three Other
brass pieces, and at least fifty horses. There
is another company, said to be made up b
Blltimorc boys. The water defences are unde
the command of Capt. Lynch, formerly of th
U. s. navy. and who conducted the exploring
expediti)a to the Dead Sea. As near as cal
be aecrrtained, there are at least Is, 900 rebe

The statement Of the Paris correspondent
of the N. ?. Times, that France, England, and
Spain, have all ordered an increase OF their
naval forces on our coasts, and especially in
the Gulf of Mexico, attracts quite as much at
tention as it deserves. 1t is probably rather
good guess as to what the Powers referred to
will do, than the communication Of any abso.
lutte knowledge as to what they have done.


OF course, with the possibility of collisions
growing out Of the condition Of affairs in this
country, the nations of Europe having large
commercial interests on this side Of the Allan
tic, will naturally augment the means Of de.
tending the property and lives Of their citizens
here. The Gulf States are known to be dis.
organized and in the hands of mobs, and this
has been specially illustrated to the apprehen.
sions Of Great Britain, by the lynching Of
British captain at Savannah. Bad as the pre-
dicament Of things really is on the Gulf, it is
even worse as understood abroad, and the
European Naval Powers cannot fail to have
forces on the spot, to prevent, or punish, acts
Of barbarism which they apprehsnd in that
quarter.


But there is still another motive, and per
hsps stronger one, operating to increase the
display Of European forces in the Gulf and
that is the necessity of repressing the flibus.
tering enterprises on the side Of Cuba and
Mexico apprehended from the political views
of the conspirators who are at the head Of the
Southern Confederacy, and which are as per
fectly understood in Europe as they are here.


1t is in this matter of extending slavery,
that these conspirators will End that secession
was the worst possible policy for the object they
aim at. 1t was only under cover Of the power
Of the old Union that their schemes Of an.
nexstion were possible to be realized. De.
prived of that, and reduced to the weakness Of
petty confederacy, they will find themselves
snubbed without ceremony by English, French,
and Spanish admirals. And they may depend
upon it, that European Intervention in the
Gulf to prevent the enlargement Of their cotton
kingdom, will excite no sympathy, and provoke
no resistance, in the States which abide by the
stars and stripes.



Republic of March 29th, says that during the
three preceding days, eighteen hundred bales
of cotton had been sent east from Buffalo to
Boston, over the N. Y. Central railroad. 1t is
brought from Memphis to Cincinnati by water,
and thence by rail to Boston, at an expense
for the whole distance, of four dollars and a
half per bale Of Eve hundred dollars, which is
less than the cost of shipping from Memphis
to Boston by the way of New Orleans. As cot.
ton is now compressed, thirty bales are easily
loaded upon one car.


These inland routes to the Atlantic for the
cotton of the Mississippi valley, are growing in
importance, and mark great change in COM.
merce. But there is still another change,
which is not far distant. The cotton of the
lower valley of the Mississippi, instead of be-
ing brought to the Atlantic at all, either by rail
road, or through New Orleans and by the sea,
is to be manufactured in the upper valley,
where the manufactured products will be con.
sumed."

nance of secession will be, in the greater part
of the State, an empty form. Virginia is over
run with troops from the South, while her own
secessionists, embodied as military force, are
scattered into almost every county, to overawe
the people. Men may vote against secession,
if they choose, but ouly at the peril of being
lynched.


The Richmond Convention to make assu.
rance doubly sure, provided that, in addition
to the ordinary polling places, polls should be
open in the military eneampments. This ex.
traordnary privilege, which will be availed of,
not only by the soldiers resident in Virginia,
but by those from South Carolina Georgia, and
other Southern States not excepting the Chero
kee Indians from North Carolina, has beer
still further enlarged as will be seen by the fol
lowing from the Alexandria Sentinel:


""Gen. Lee has issued orders to our miitar
to take al once vote on ratifying the ordi
nance of secession. This vote is simply pre-
cautionary,' and is to be held to meet the con
tingency Il at the military exigencies o
Thursday next, be such as to prevent the vote
of the soldiers being taken on that day.
the election may afterwards be regularly held
the precautionary vote goes for nothing; other
wise, it is to be forwarded to the Convention
for its action. This order of Cen Lee is il
execution of an order of the Governor anC
Council""


Under this order, the vote of the soldiers a
Alexandria was taken on Tuesday, and result
ed, 1873 for disunion, against it, and refu
sing to vote."

28_1861-05-15_p1_sn82014760_00237288804_1861051501_0451,The national Republican.,01,1861-05-15,p1,"THE SITUATION,",,"


The number of troops in camp in Virginia, is
not estimated higher than 10000, principally
raw levies, and many Of them poorly armed.
They are scattered at Harper's Ferry, Lynch.
burg, Richmond, Norfolk, &C., and to concen.
trate them and maintain them in mass at any
one point is quite beyond the means of the
conspirators.


On the side of the national Government,
there is the great force in this city, in commu.
nication, (now that Baltimore is occupied
with the North, by three lines, viz: the Poto
mac, uia Annapolis, and ria Baltimore.


Under these circumstances, we anticipate the
early occupation Of such adjacent portions Of
Virginia, as can be reached and held with the
means Of transportation at command, and the
opening of the communication with the West
ria Harper's Ferry.


That portion of Virginia which lies opposite
and above us on the Potomac, is inclined to be
loyal, and would be glad to be relieved Of the
reign ofterror which now oppresses it, but which
can only be shaken of with the aid of the ma
tional forces.


This is not q war against an organized Gov.
ernmsnt, to be signalized by great campaigns.
1t is war to repress rebellion, which has no
great armies, and really few resources, and
which is to be put down by dispensing insurgent
bands, after the fashion in which Captain Lyon
snutfed out insurrection at st. Louis. This re-
bellion would become a settled war, if time
enough was given to it to harden into one, but
that will not be allowed.


What has been accomplished by the Admin
istration since the Presidents proclamation Of
April Is, in only one month, is really won.
derful.


Missouri has been saved by armng and or.
ganizing the Union men Of St. Louis.


The Union men of Western Virginia, of
Maryland, and Of Kentucky, are being organ.
lied and armed


Maryland is occupied and thoroughly pro-
tected against any enterprises which may be
attempted by the secessionists within her Dor.
der, who, although minority Of her popula-
ton, are numerous and desperate.


That strategic point, Cairo, which holds
in check Kentucky, and Tennessee, and Ar
kansas, is fully occupied.


This capital has not only been defended, but
now swsrms with troops, numerous enough, or
soon to be SO, to expel the insurrectionists
from the best portions of Virginia.


Thirty days ago, the conspirators undoubt.
edly expected to embrace fourteen States with.
in their Confederacy, and not without some
reason, as we now know from the recent de.
velopments in Maryland and Missouri. Both
of those States would have been lost, but for
the vigor Of the precautionary measures Of
the Government.


NEW FASHIONS OF CARRYING ON


WAR.


During the Russian war, we sent commits
sion Of military gentlemen to the Crimea, to
see how Europeans fought. We should not be
surprised if the compliment is returned, and
if Louis Napoleon and Victoria send some
Generals and Majors across the Atlantic, to
see how Americans fight. If that is done,
Europe will receive some new ideas in the art
OF warfare.


At Fort Pickens as matters existed down to
the I'd of May, as described by officers who left
on that day in the Illinois, Bragg's forces were
proceeding undisturbed in various innocent op
erations, such, for example, as casting cannon
balls, Immediately under the guns of For,
Pickens, without any apprehension, or appar
f emily any danger, of being disturbed. The
same forces were receiving their supplies Of
food, and indeed, of everything except arms
and powder, by water from Mobile by vessel,
passing under the same inoffensive guns O
Fort Pickens, and also of the American feet
AS, if Bragg's forces were not supplied by water
it would have been expensive to supply then
by land,it would have been rude to have CLOSED
, the harbor against them.


, On the 7th of May, as it seems, two vessel
! from Mobile, loaded with provisions were act
ually stopped by the American feet although
this was done, as is reported, against the judg
ment of one Of our naval commanders No
body apparently suggesting any such extreme
measure as seizing the enemy's provisions, th'
| vessels returned to Mobile.
, 1t is proper to be said, that General Brag,
t has manifested equal poiteness, as all account
of the recent reinforcement of Fort Pickens
: agree that the landing of men and supple
( proceeded unmolested under his guns.

LOCAL MATTERS.",,"WOULDN'T TELL LIE.-An incident was
,orrated. recently, in the Court of Sessions, il
lnstrating the veracity of the Celestials. A
.,,;nor,s cabin was broken into and seven hun
1.od dollars in coin and a watch stolen. Very
s,rour circumstances pointing to John, for
,oorly in the employ of the injured party, as the
,hiof he was seized and sentenced by Judge
lynch to be hanged till he confessed. Under
the sentence John, protesting his innocence,
ras hauled some dozen times over stout
limb. but the last ascension proving too much
for the Celestial's fortitude, he owned up, and
agreed to pilot his tormentors to the hidden
bootv. and did SO. While the miners were un-
earthing the il-gotten treasure, John looked on
vorv plum, but when the last ""twenty"" was
e,humed his countenance frightened, and slap
ming the leader Of the choking inquisition
trnmphantly on the back, he exclaimed; ""You
see, John, me no tell lie.""


COURT OF SEssIoNs.-The motion for a
new trial in the case of L. p. Huntsman, con-
yieted Of an assault to do bodily harm, was ar
pued OIL Saturday afternoon, and overruled.
The defendant was sentenced to pay fine of
$50, or, in default of payment, be imprisoned
in the county Jail for seventy-fve days. The
second trial of John Vintage. indicted for as
sault with intent to murder, was commenced
Yesterday morning, and the day occupied in
empannelling jury and hearing testimony for
the prosecution. The witnesses for the defense
gave their testimony this forenoon, and the
case is now being argued by counsel.


DISTRICT CoURT.-In the District Court,
on Monday, the motion for new trial in the
case of the Eureka Lake Co. VS.. Van Hagan,
was oyerruled. The motion for new trial. in
the case of Mcdaniel VS.. Stidger, was set for

This afternoon, the Court appointed the Sher-
if assignee in the case Of Samuel Oakes, an
insolvent debtor. In the case of the Eureka

fixed at $4,000.


CONNECTION WITH THE AUBURN STAGE.
The California Stage Company have com""
menced running two-horse stage from Auburn
to connect with the Nevada stage running to
Lincoln. The stage leaves Auburn at ten
o'clock every morning, and connects with the
Nevada stage six miles west of the former
place. BY this arrangement, passengers from
Nevada can go direct to Auburn, if they so de-
sire, instead of going to Lincoln.


GAS LIGHT.-The Nevada Gas Co. put up
yesterday, large street lamp on their building,
which is kept burning all night. This is de-
cded improvement. 1t cheers the belated pc
destrians vending their way to Aristocracy
Hill and its reflection on the adjoining brick
blocks gives that part of our town city look.
It is particularly pleasing to those who remem-
Der when our town was composed of log cabins
and shake shan ties.


THE HENNEss RoAD.-Mau's saddle train
arrived in town yesterday morning, direct from
Virginia City, by way of the Henness Pass.
We learn from the driver that good trail is
now open for hOrsemen and pack ANIMALS.


HOSE NG.-Messrs. Terry & Irving,
No. 81 Broad Street, are busily employed in
manufacturing hose for the miners. They turn
out about one hundred yards day.

which naturally attracts good deal of attention. Is
necessary 10 consider who the writer is what position
he holds in public affairs, and why he wrote THAT
letter.


Mr.. Cassius M. Clay is a Kentucky man. and rei'
alive Of the late Henry Clay; but he Las never 'o'
lowed the political track Of his eminent RELATIVE neh'!
Clay used TO boast that it was by bis doing that hen
tucky was Slave State At the time OF ts organHa-
ton as State majority OF the lnhaoltaus ueoieo 10
emancpste their negroes and encourage the lmmlgra-
ton of free labor but Mr.. Clay dscoun,enanced The
notion and used his influence, with success, TO induce
his peghbofs TO follow the Southern practice in regard


10 the tenure of labor To do this in such country as
Kentucky was to incur a very grave responsibility.
The inhabitants have taken heartily 10 Slavery
with one accord; their sill and climate favorable
the employment of white well free negro labor;
they have seen the river, Ohio using into high
prosperity while Kentucky made little no progress;
and there have been not few citizens IN Mr. Clay
State who have always felt that he answerabe 1or
its inferiorty in numbers wealth. and intelligence 10
the States on the oppotit bank Of the Ohio. Among
those who asserted the higher principles on which
the State ought TO have been organized and on Whch
it must have hourshed beyond perhaps any other re-
gion in the Uuion Mr. Csssius M. Clay has been the
most prominent. For long course of years he has
testified against the false policy of his State at the
risk of his e and to the great injury OF his fortune'
He has been hunted out OF the Stae be has been iIn-
prisoned prosecuted threatened, and brought within
az inch Of his life by Lynch aw and bis property has
been thrown into the Ohio, burnt. or broken up Dut
nothing could dsunt his sirt, or sence hS protests
His Southern habits of slfdefense, and bis Northern
habi Of political reasoning have on Tue whoe, maui

Abolitonst yet he has lived TO come to Europe as an
Embassador. He be longed to the small body OF
Abolitiopsts proper but, though he earned PISTOLS

he was DO far an Abotionie that be early emancpated
his own slaves and has since fought stout bat
tie, by his own printingpress public speaking, shu
whole Of life, behalf Of the Liberties; oil whites
and blacks, all over the Union.


Such is the man who now, having Just ianded IN
England on his way to Russia is evidently struck with
surprise at the ignorance be meets with, or Is leo 10
infer from the tone of of the newspapers on the
great American question. The impulse was to write
to The Times 10 set The clearly before US, and
recify some current mistakes He has met with rather
hard measure 10 return; bat lew more daYs in En-
gland would have shown him that a somewhat closer
and clearer statement of bis would have answered
better with an audience which he addresses ON the
very ground that ii is critical instead OF sympathetic


1t is certain, however, that The Tunes misappre-
bends Mr.. Clay when it dlsrisses as mere rhetorical
ampfcation his notice Of tal by jury liberty OF the
prees, and representative government as objects OF
conflict between North and South. MIR. Z. NJ Clay
has but too much to know what the systematic
perversion of justice 49, under the influence OF 'ne



further than the condition Of the Supreme Court under
Southern management to be aware what the North has
to do in upholdng justice. Fair jury trial Is not TO be
had in half the States the coercion Of the press Is ss
bad as ANYTHING Mr.. G. NJ. Clay will find IN Russia:
and as for representative government, we need only
point to the threeffhs suffrage of the Slave States
and the virtual exclusion from the polls there Of all
mean whites whose opinions might be supposed
likely 10 be inconvenent, Mr.. Clay 10 Ger taply Jnt
fed n saying that the Free States fighting for lib
erty under these and other FORMS the liberty and the
forms have always and everywhere been crushed oy
Southern rule. But he must allow for tnglishmen
being unable TO imagine without due explanation, that
such fundamental liberties these are really 10 be
fought for in the great Republic. The successive
Southern Governments OF recent years have enoached
more and these common 1gbts, 70 that tney are
now actually in question: but Mr. Clay must remember
TINT while he has been contendDg for them at the isk
of his life aud 10 the oss of his fortune, most OF Us
have been suppoDg them the birhrght OF every white
American, rs of ourselves.


The paragraph of Mr. Clay's letter which cites the
demands Of tie Southern Confedeiscy is certainly ac
curate. Every point Of 1t may lie proved by facts
within the memory OF most OF u.s. and Tie one truth,
that in every instance the Confederate authorities
have refused to refer their usurpai0ns TO the
votes of the people,"" should be well considered by any
Englishnsn whose mind is open TO evidence In the
case The demands are essentially barbaric in such
country at such date; and Mr. Clay Is indisputaby
justified in saying that the great question OF the is
whether this barbarisO is or is not to be allowed 10
swamp the whole Republic To smile at such state





which Mr.. Clay proposes TO Iebuke and correct.


As for whether the North repress the rebellion,
everybody judge whether Dir. Clay confidence


is rational or not This be decided by the facts of
population and the comparative resources Of food,
stores, money, &c. We not aware that nybody
preends that there is an approach to equality in the
resources Of the two secons-eNen II the Border States
ioned the South, and notwithstanding the enormous
embezzlements by which the Federal treasury has
been euptied Mr.. Clay's letter, however, confirms
the largest estimates yet made OF the strength OF the
loyal Federal element throughout The country. Per
haps the most valuable part OF his letter IA that which
he occupies with statement, not new to readers,
but too much needed generally, Of the relation which
the people individually bear to the Government, and
with which the States have nothing to do. The real
question is who and how many the rebels are. little
time will show whether there are most Union men or
Secessonists in the States over which Mr.. Jefferson
Davis processes to bear sway. II Mr.. Clay is right
in believing that anything hall the citizens are loyal
to the Union, they will soon have the means Of de-
clsring Themselves and the contest will be at end.
Ii is certainly true, Mr. Clay points out, that the
political party at the North which is answerabe for the
long domination Of the Pro-Sayery faction at Washing
ton has become the most loyal OF all parties since s
Southern comrades took 10 rebellion


Another valuable statement Of Mr.. Clays il that
there s no question Of the subugaon"" OF any State.
Our contemporaries have been raising the difficulty one
after another, of what is to be done with subugaed
territory; and Mr. Davis the leader Of the aggressive
party who met with ong-sufering to the last moment
now invites his followers to declare against ""subuga-
tOn is no question OF territory or conquest at all
Rebels must return to their allegiance OF obtain terms
which do not involve trouble TO their loyal neghbors
They will probably have the choice OF going away
living in peace and order under the laws. We believe
Mr. Clay 10 be mistaken If he thinks the Consttution
NAV remain precisely what il is. There must be amend
ments by which the Free States will be released from
all implication with Slavery; and there are other
points which will not bo again sanctioned. But his
general statement that the Constitution exists s for
the whole country, and that there is political adver
sary TO subugate will be Of great use to those who

ers. Their employers admit that they pus-
sess less ply ysicnl force than the whites. and
that they are not So fertile in expedients, in
| the adapiiOn OF means to ends; but they
boast ot their patience, their remarkable ia
cllly for Initiating the modes adopted by
more intelligent workers; and, above all,
they boast that their labor can be obtained
for almost nothing. Chinese operatives we
believe, are employed in the recently estab-
lished woolen manua story at the Mission
near San Francisco, and the celebrated Col
Harazthy, once melter aud refner in the
Mint, now the extensive farmer, vinedresser
aud orchardist of SoDoma county, works
gangs of Chinese at eight dollars per month,
per man. The initial step has been taken to
huid up sysism of coolie apprenticeship in
California, similar to that in Cuba, or in chile
and the consequence must he that intelligent
white workers will he turned .dritt and left
to starve or steal as inclination or necessity
may prompt them.


Some three months ago, several influential
newspapers of the State took I'D the Chinese
subject and argued it very ably so ably, that
1t seems strange the attention of the legisa-
|
ton. So far, however, the legislature has not
thought proper TO trouble itself with Chinese
affairs; and there is no probability that it
Will give the subject any thought during the
briet remainder of the present st ssion. 1t is
unfortunate for California that ncr politicians

and people than in those of their own. The
leading politicians are now cndeavoring to
revigity old party organizations and create
new ones, On questions and issues with which
The people Of California have no direct inter-

California it is Of infinite imrortance that it
should he protected against the insidous en-
! croachments of Chinese competition and to

| il ought to be looking instead of wearing
itself with discussions atcut the relative
merits Of coercion and anti coercion. The
secession difficulties on the eastern side of the
continent can he solved without the especial
! aid Of the people of California and it seems
like going long journey to borrow trouble,
to lug those Ear on difficulties into our midst
TO serve as food for partisan dissention. The
first and highest civic duty of Californians-
workers and ron- workers lis to take care Of
themselves. When they shall have executed
that duty faithfully and we'll, they will have
license and excuse for busyirg themselves
with the affairs Of distant outsiDers


Ihe happiness of the white workers of
California is not, in any wise, dependent on
the course the Federal Government may pug-
sue in regard to the refractory States on the
Gulf Of Mexico, but it has Il most intimate
connection with the home policy of throwing
the labor of the state into tie hands Of an

TIE New STYN-Speaking Of masked
balls and parties, Ching Foo writes to the
Union from New \ ork, as follows:


As Americans always improve on every
thing, from tooth. picks to the ten command

masquerade the unexpected pleasures of the

/ Mrs Clark, Of TIL street, were preparing to
take bit Of cold supper last Wednesday
evening, the bell rang furiously, aud the
/ door being opened in came fifteen ortwenty
masks, al! got ny to kill in the oldest cos

they all behaved we'll and showed 10 signs of

went into the lhing heartily. You must know
the way this masquerade surprise is done is
his party is made up, hut no one commu-

 WHEREAS, The inaugural address of the President of the United States of America has proclaimed the policy of subjugation and war; and whereas, as the citizens of St. Francis county, formerly Union men, have lost all hope and confidence in the efficacy of any effort to reconstruct the Union, or to preserve the ancient rights of the South and the present government; and whereas, in their judgment it is the duty of all good citizens to council together and cooperate with each other in the common defence of themselves and their brethren having a community of interest-therefore be 1t

 l. Resolved, That our representatives in the convention now assembled at Little Rock be requested to let our portion of the Union slide without further struggle. ?. That in the opinion of the citizens of this county, the State of Arkansas ought not to submit to the administration of and policy of Lincoln, and that it is the duty of the people of this State to prepare themselves for resistance to coercive po- icy.

 B. That military company be raised in Richland township, and that we recom- mend the organization of such companies throughout the State.

 4. That we appoint committee consist ing of w. B. Lynch. T. D. Chun and T. 0. Sugg, to repair immediately to Little Rock and communicate to our representa- lives the action of this meeting, and in- form the of them great change of sentiment of the citizens since they received the inau- gural address of Lincoln.

 5. That copy of these resolutions be forwarded by our committee to the True Democrat for publication.

Of our worldwide humanity, with the strocious
dogma that negro slavery is the only basis Of
real conservatism and progressive civilization,

should orn the idborer, whether phite or

The success Of such demands would send

TIE NoRTHERS REBELLIoN. Under this caption
the Harrisburg tPa.1 Union and Patriot, hitherto a
strong war journal, thus touches upon new dan
ger which is beginning to threaten the North:


Are our readers aware that rebellion against
the authority OF the Government is organizing at
the Northtbat treason is rearing its ugly head in
the midst OF the very party that processes the most
determination ia putting. down the rebellion at the
South 1t is even So Daily attempts are now
being made TO array the army against the Govern.

thorities. If#


Daily threats are made that if the war is not
pushed forward with more yigor, the army will act
upon its own responsibility and that il. compro.
mise is effected three hundred thousand men in
arms win NOT disband without administering law
according TO the code Of Juage Lynch. After all
the beautiful prattie about the Constitution the
Union, and the enforcement Of the laws, coming
from those who have spent years in trampiing
upon the Constitution, defiding the Union and yio-
lating the laws, the old law-defying instincts have
once more gained the mastery. and revolution is
now the watchword. The Government must
plunge headong into the vortex Of civil war OF be
trodden under the iron heel Of military despotism

BUTTE CREEK. March 4, 1861.",,"


FRIEND CRosErrE Under the impression
that few liBes might prove acceptable to
your readers, have concluded to give you a
little concerning matters and things in general
from this locality. As political matters and
the eternal nigger has become general
bone of contention, we pass that by in silence,
except to give the particulars of an impromptu
Inauguration celebration, gotten up under the
immediate supervision of our worthy Vulcan
Uncle Billy, and DR.. Mullen, who, at noon, to-
day raised our national emblem, and saluted
with gun for each State, including South
Carolina, and then adjourned to the bar for a
drink of old Bourbon, after which they ad
journed mutually satisfied with the days pro-
ceedings. By-the-bye, DR.. Mullen, is whole
souled fellow--in fact one of natures noblemen
barring his Republican proclivities- and, as
Chris Lynch says, Everybody knows Chris
I"" He cannot see how one Of of the name Of
Mullen can be Black A Abolitionist,' as he
calls them. He has been a Jealous worker in
the Republican cause in this precinct, and if
Cheeseman, and other Republican teachers, do
not give Doc. share of the spoils they will
deserve the execrations Of all well meaning
men of their party. Although the Republi-
cans have been engaged in bad cause, now
that the crisis has come, all hope for the best,
and that one star of the glorious galaxy may
never be removed, is our earnest prayer. And.
now, for something more interesting to the
general reader, and particularly the mining
portion of the community.


This has been very dull and severe winter,
but the worst has passed, and Deacon Collins
once more wears his habtual smile. and the
miners, generally are in strong hopes Of being
rewarded for their labor, in the shape Of big
chunks, and ounce-aday diggngs. So mote
it be-


Wells & Co. have Just completed their new
fume across the West Branch, one hundred
feet high and three hundred feet long. 1t is
one Of the best pieces of work in the county,





perntendence of Mr.. Wells. This, together
with the completion Of their new ditch, enables
them to commence operations in their claims,
known as g Freeze out"" which pays from half
an-ounce to an ounce day to the hand, with
ground enough to last for years.


Wilmington & Co. have just erected by
i \ u.
bered as the claim where they last year took
out several large chunks, among them one
weighing some $500 90. They think there
are plenty more left.


Campville Hydraulic claim, Daggett, Lynch
& Co., are doing we'll Mcpherson has just
completed his preparations ard has good
prospect Dr. Mullen is in hope that his claim,
adjoining Freeze out, and known as Freeze
out Jr' will make him all right, though he
met with a serious pecuniary loss on Thursday
night last, occasioned by heavy land slide Of
Camel Ridge into Main Butte, carrying off
about 5 acres, and making chasm 80 feet
deep; of course, sweeping off everything in its
way carrying away Mullen's cabin, containing
his derrick irons, ropes, tools, and lumber on
the bank, stored away for huming, next year.


Speaking of tluming, the present season bids
fair for such operations, and the boys are going
in extensively. In fact some are now COM
mencing. Davis, Ford & Co. are now at
work on the West Branch and Messrs. Parker
& Dyer have been at work all winter stripping
their claim and removing the large rocks in
sight. 1t is confidently asserted that this will
prove the richest claim ever worked on the
creek


Last year, Red Nick was driven out of his
claim by the fall freshet, but will be all right
in few weeks, and, next season. expects to
pay visit to Posey county, and show "" our
Mary Anne his good natured face, and in
duce her to become Mrs. Nick, and take up
her abode in the Golden State


Wishing you God speed, and a safe return
from your contemplated visit to the ""old folks
at home"" Adios,


UNCLE Brock

which had been left blank upon their banner

only say he has spent good deal OF time and

to long, weak and watery letter addressed to
the Editor of THE TRIBUNE. Why man
should keep taking when he has nothing to say
would be puzzle if il were not plain that
person may involve himself in predicament
wherein he must try to justify himself whether
be can or not. Mr.. Lynch mauuders and
muddles over much random talk about Know
Nothings and other matters which have nothing
to do with his case; for we do not think even
he will assert that the thousands who remained
and fought at Bull Run although the term oil
their enlistment had expired were all Know
Nothings. We must call the gentleman to
order. and once more direct him to speak to
the question.


Mr. Lynch Yoa enlisted in and went out
as a member Of Capt. Varian's battery at
tached to the Eighth Regiment of New-foH'
Militia The battery was sworn in on the
Goth of April; the rest of the regiment not til
the 25th. On the Goth of July (the day before
the battle Of Bull RUM you, as spokesman fol
yourself and sixteen others, insisted on being
discharged from further service, your teru
having that day expired. Capt Varian tried
hard to persuade you to hold on promised you
that he would net only let you go but go witt
you if you would stay FIVE days longer; Gen.
Mcdowell sent special entreaty that you
would hold on very few days; but no-you
would 90 then; and ycur example and your
efforts proved contagious. so tnst the oaIter!
had to be retired, and the regiment go into
battle next day without it, while yCu were
making your way homeward Z"" to the sounu o.
-"" the enemys cannon"" says Gen. Mcdowell
in his official report.


Now, If your conduct was honorable and
manly, rhy do you not get a certificate to ma
effect from Capt. Tarian1 Why does not som'
one officer of your own regiment speak good
word for you Why do you have to resort to the
Sixty -nnth-whose conduct so strongly con-
demns your own-to obtain a sort of indorse-
menti They know nothing of your case but
by hearsay: why not appeal to some one who
heard what you said and saw what you did on
the eve Of Bull Rum Why but because their
testimony would not help youl


You tell us, Dir. Lynch! that you are certain
to be chosen Sheriff. How do you know
That you arc good at running is pretty clear;
but il is unwise to be boastful. II you are
elected at all, it will be by the votes of our
Irish-born citizens whom your conduct at Bull
Run disgraced, yet who are now urged to
support you on grounds purely clannish. Had
you played your part at Bull Run like Corco-
ran, Meagher, and so many other Irishmen,
you might have fairly claimed the suiirages OF
your cOuntrymen, but if those who fight are to
receive wounds, imprisonment, and death,
while those who run away are chosen to our
best Offices, there will be poor encouragement
for Corcorans hereafter."

Reyly.-On the contrary, Mr.. Vulte is the
only candidate in the field who will elect Mr..
Lynch. The organization above referred to is
VIGOROUSLY the machine Of Fernando Wood.
Il dates its existence from an abortye attempt
by DIR. X. b. Bradford to wrest the organiza.
ton of the Peoples movement, inaugurated at
the great mass meeting held at Cooper Institute
to ratify the Peoples State Ticket from the
officers of the meeting, and pervert it to the
purposes of Mozart Hall. The attempt was too
glaring, however, and, being detected at once,
was unanimously voted down by the meeting.
Bradford then, under tho advice Of Fernando
Wood, started an independent Convention,
composed of men Of his own stamp
selfappointed. and representing no con
stituency who went through the forms O
nominating candidates. For Sheriff they nom
mated Josiah w. Brown, the candidate Of th'
Peoples and the Republican parties, and oI"

and Sergeant J. H. Murphey, charged with kill
ing Cornelius Boyd, was taken up. After the
Indictment was read, the District Attorney, +.
c. Darlington, for the prosecution, opened the
case by briefly defining the difference of man.
slaughter and murder, and reciting the occur.
rences leading to the perpetration Of the act.
Joseph Il. Bradley, SEN, briefly replied on the
part of the defence.


Officer Fl. Harrorer s,rorn-Witness is a
police officer, and heard early the following
morning that man named Boyd had been muir.
dered. He went to the house about seven o'clock
in the morning, and found that the door and
windows of the house had been shattered by
bullets The neighbors declined entering the
house, and witness, in company with Mr. Van
Riswick, went in. They went in the alley and
entered the middle room, where they found Mrs
Boyd sitting on the floor with her child. She
was very much prostrated, and asked witness
what must be done, TO which he replied that he
would do all that he could. The floor was Gov
cred with pieces of plasterng and splinters from
the window shutters and lathes. Mrs. Boyd
showed witness the blood along the steps, and
took him to the upper room, where her hus
bands body was. The body was laying on the
floor, with the feet towards the door. A bed
spread was partly thrown over it. Boyd's dog
was licking one Of his masters hands, and woulc
no, allow witness to approach the corps. Wit
ness asked Mr.. Van Riswck to remain in tht
house until he went for the coroner, but he de
cl;ued, saying that he would stay around, how
ever. Witness got horse, and went for tn,
coroner. When be came back, he summond tn,
jury of inquest. He examined the body will
the Jury, and is under the impression that th'
bali entered the left side, four inches belov
the arm.pit, and took an oblique direction, pass
ing out the right side. The wound WAS large
on the right side than the left. Witness sav
Murphy, who was killed by Foley with Mimi
ball, and thinks the wounds were made BY tn
same kind of ball. Six balls were found In tn
house, including a pistol ball found by Mis-
Mills. Witness cnt one ball from the studdin
between the rooms. One ball went into the wr
dow at All angle of not more than ten degrees
which could not have passed more than eigt
teen inches from the door. Witness then shov
ed piece cut from the door, showing the mar
Of pistol bullet, which entered from the ou
side.

 The latest fashion here is for homespun dresses and thick soed shoes. And the result is that our women were never so beautiful or so healthy.

 In St. Louis pa atriotism is a crime. Not content with making freemen of slaves, Fremont naturally makes slaves of white men. Read this and see how brave men are treated:

All these, people say, make a very palatable drink; and we have no doubt if we try, we can bring ourselves to believe that each and all make beverage equal to the best Java 9r Mocha.-Au9usta Chronicle.' e/

 We have tried these substitutes, but the best we ever found acorns. These, hulled, dried, roas- ted and ground, not only taste like coffee but have the same qualities or medicinal effects. Unless well dried, you can detect sort of soft, unripe favor but, properly prepared they are an excellent substitute for coffee. Let some of our friends try it and give us the results of their experiment. We once knew wealthy man, an epicuIe to boot, who preferred his acorn coffee to the finest Java or Mocha.

 See what John Mitchell says

 THE ToBAcco SUPPLY IN FRANcE.-John Nit chel, in his last letter, dated August 18th, from Paris, to the Charleston Mercury, says:

 ""We are not going to do without our tobacco. MT. Seward may count upon that with confidence. Not to speak of the great and royal cotton at all we must positively have the Lynchburg and Rich mond article There is not workman in France who does not smoke his pi pc immediately after his cafe Gu ait Most of the tobacco has been shipped from Norfolk or from Baltimore. It is all imported for account of the government The emperor re- ceves 1t all in public stores what he does to it in process of manufacture is more than can explain, but at any rate he turns it out for sale and con sumption very mean and inferior article. One pound of first class Lynchburg is worth a ton of cdp0rn. Nevertheless, poor as 1t is, we must put it in pipe and smoke it, for there is other, and we can by no means do without it, The French government, indeed, usually keeps in store provis- ion for two or three years ahead, 50 that men are in no immediate danger of having the supply cut off,

 We give another extract from a New Orleans paper, in relation to the free market there:

The remaining companies will start this evening at 0 o'clock for that place, and will get there Thursday morning if we have good luck. Thus far we have had most prosperous time of 1t. hope it will prove prognostlc of our future success The boys are all in fine spirits, and very anxious to be at the attack on Washington, as they are desirous to have a hand in taking old Abe's scalp.

Died on the Sd August, at the residence Of Jas

my) aged rs years He was a native Of South
Carolina; served seven years in the U s. army,
and participated in the battle of New Orleans,

take part in the present struggle, observing:

have been.'' --.--.z. .. . .7-
+ In an article upon the subject of lynch law the
Telegraph says


The, fact is, either the laws or the admfnistra
ton of them have been too lax. The people feel
and know this and while within the past year
there have been probably fifty men hung in
this State by respectable bodies of citizens, we
cannot recall more than one or two of them in
which the person hung was the victim of much in
Justice. The remedy for these things is in the
Legislature and in the courts. Let but the law
makers, and those charged with the execution of
the laws, establish the fact that they worthy
of the confidence of the people,, and our word for
it, the people will soon again trust their safety to
them. '....


We take the following from the segun Confet-
eracy: ...-5 @
Wehaye heard it said that cotton is being pur-
chased in Victoria Goliad and other counties near
| those to be delivered in Corpus Christi. We can
not say how much truth there may be in the re-
port but if it is so, we think the people in that
section should put stop to it, as it would be nc


very difficult matter, whether so intended by those
purchasing it or not for Lincons vessels to come
| in and take the cotton Off No cotton should be
| permitted to be accumulated s.on or near the
| coast. A..


The Confederacy gives the following prices of


produce in Seguin: ~, .-... NV
4 Cotton can be sold in any quantities at or 10


cents the pound. Bacon is selling at 10 cents.
Thos. N. Minter, Of the neighborhood, Assistant


Quartermaster, wishes to purchase, for the use of
| t0 no 81 Mi1lican.
| for which he gives ten cents. Barley has been


sold in a large quantity, near segnn, at rs cents


the bushe. Corn is worth 60 cents in, San Antonio.


and some of the citizens of this county have had
u it hauled for them at 10 CENTS yielding them fifty


cents for their corn sheIed and sacked, the sacks
| being furnished Oats we suppose will bring


nearly as much as corn, though we have heard Of


none having been sold"

 The Fort Smith Times says that the following message was sent by the renegade Phelps, of Mo-, to John Ross, Principal Chief of the Chero- kee Nation:

 ""Tell Mir. Ross to remain frm Twill see that the annuity is sent to him soon as the communi- cation is opened, which will be very soon."" It appears from this that Phelps is in the con- fdence of the Lincoln government. He is shrewd, unprincipled man, and as the Times justly says, has done more than any man in Mis- souri to sell his State to the black republican tyrant.

 Gen. Beauregard is Catholic. Gen. Johnston, who has taken command of the army of the West, is a Kentuckian by birth, but citizen of Texas, of which State, when the Lone Star Republic, he was secretary of war.

 MT. Caruthers, the superintendent of the Texas penitentiary says that institution can turn out one thousand yards of goods suited ! for winter clothing, every week day. Fortunate ly they have a great many sheep in Texas and wool is plenty.

 The Mississippi river pilots had an associa 1 ton at St. Louis, and large fund for the SUD- port of the widows and children of such pilots as left destitute families Fremont has stolen | $40,000 of this because it was contributed by rebels or those pilots who are on boats in the

 waters of the seeded States

 | Some of the military companies raised during

 the present war have assumed queer names.-

 We have avengers"" "" invincibles,"" !"" fenci- bles"" and ""rangers,"" without number. In our State we have, or had, company of ""yellow jackets"" another of "" hornets and one called the ""sassafras invincibles."" In Texas they have one called the Yankee hunters"" In

 Alabama one is styled the rosin hees."" Wild cats, tigers, rattlesnakes and bears, have fur nished names for other companies.

 A correspondent of the Lynchburg Republi- can says that he visited the graves of some Yan- kees killed in battle and buried by troops. | On board at the head of one of the graves he ] found the following distich by way of epitaph: ""The Yankees came in serried bands | To take possession of our lands, But this very small, contracted spot, | Shows all the lands these Yankees got.''

 The outspoken and patriotic Louisville Cou-

 rier has been suppressed. The Yoeman and other independent papers in Kentucky will go by the board in a short time: | Major Alexander, aid to Col. Thomas, lately escaped from the Bastile Fort McHenry. | Housewives should save all the quls from their geese. Steel pens are getting scarce and we may have to resort to the quill pen. By the 10th day of October the British go- vernment will have force of 22,OO0 regulars in Canada So says the London Globe. Enlisting at the North is such dull busi- ness that volunteers are offered a bounty of from S25 to $lOO. Hundreds upon hundreds of our volunteers have spent over hundred dollars each in arming and equipping themselves for the war.

 The negroes in Louisiana, Mississippi and the Carolinas have fine times hunting alligators.- The skins of these amphibia make the best leather in the world. It is soft, tmpervious to water and never wears out.

 Gu rcountry friends should gather broom straws or sedge. We will have to use home made brooms hereafter.

 A large fleet has set sail from New York to some unknown point on the Confederate coast. | They have gun boats, transports and small steamers in proportion. To give some idea of the magnitude of this armada, it is known that 25, 900 troops accompany it. We believe it's destination is Galveston, but of course this is a mere ..coniecture of ours. It may be intended to attack Mobile and New Orleans, and to occu- py the lakes in the rear of the latter city. After balloting for several days the North Carolina legislature elected George Davis and William J. Dortch, Senators from that State in the Confederate Congress.

 The sequestration act of the Confederate Congress is an important one in several respects. In Arkansas at least million dollars worth of property will come within the scope of the act. City property, lands, and some personal proper ty will be coniscated. It is made the duty of every citizen to give information to the proper OmC6f, or all ldnuoJ Soodo, A'Sh'o ""hu VicullS owned by an alien enemy, that may come to their knowledge. All attorneys, agents part ners, trustees, or other persons controlling or having charge of such property are liable to fine and imprisonment for failing to inform the receiver of the property in their charge or un- der their control, and to render an account thereof Mr. Woodruff, of this city, has the largest land agency of any person in this State. It has been estimated that he controls or has charge of at least half million dollars worth of property wned by parties resident in the north ern States. Of course all this will be seques. trated The act will play hob with the patent medicine men of the North. In every county there are large quantities of these medicines left to be sold on commission, all of which will be se- questrated. The druggists and merchants should be prepared to account for these and for such"

A FIGHT ON THE POTOMAC BETWEEN TIE STEAMER


PAwEEE AND THE sEcEssIoNIsTs. . ..


Yesterday morning, about nine o'clock,
fight commenced between the United States
steamer Pa,cnee and the Confederate troops on
Matthias Point, on the Potomac.


The Pdpnee had about seventy men, and the
forces on the Point wore estimated at seven
hundred. The fight lasted about an hour, du-
ring which some sixty shells were thrown into
| the Confederate troops, and one hundred balls,
when they retreated. The Patonee then landed
| sixty men and captured two of the cavalry,
who remained with their horses, and they were
placed on board the steamer James Guy, and
sent TO Washington.


Our informant, who was on the st. Nicholas
did not learn that any were killed but it was
| supposed, from the appearance Of the place,
that number had been killed and wounded.
None Of the PdUnee's force were injured. A
farmer named Yoe, or something like it, was
known to be badly wounded, and was taken of
| by one Of his negroes. The farmer had been
| harboring secessionists for some time, and his
house was fred by order Of the commander of
| the Pdpnee.


| A number Of the farmers in Virginia, near
the Potomac, who are Union men, have been
| compelled to leave their farms and homes and
come over into Maryland, where they meet
with very cold reception, but they get off to
| Washington, or some other safe place, as soon
as possible. These friends of the Union are
forced by the secessionists to leave their crops
and all their property to their mercy, and are
glad to escape with their lives.

Governor Stewards letter of the 4th instant to
our Minister to France, TO be found on our
first page,). has undoubtedly been made thus
Immediately public, contrary to the usual rou.
tine of diplomacy, as a method Of signalling
to the country and to the world, the fact, that
the Administration fully represent and embody
the great popular idea, that this American Re-
public is one and indivisible, now and for all
time, and that its integrity is neither to be the
subject Of peaceful negotiation, nor to be yield.
ed to any imaginable pressure Of arms. Un.
der ordinary circumstances, Governor Seward
would probably have contented himself with
giving the views Of the President but properly
appreciating the fact that the circumstances
are extraordinary, he declares that the Cabinet
are unit upon this vital point, thus dissipa.
ting all the rumors Of dissension, with which
the enemy has sought to distract the public
mind.


This absolute assurance, given in the apt
and vigorous words of Gov. Seward, which bar
out every doubt and every contingency, that





than armies, to maintain it. It gives to the
Union men Of the South precisely what they
wanted, the knowledge, in an unmistakably
authoritative form, that the Government is
determined to sustain itself, and they already
knew well that it had the power, if it had the
will.


This war is thus far no underlined and uncer.
tain object. It is war for the country, for the
Constitution, for the Union, for all the precious
legacies received from patriotic sires, and for
all the interests of ourselves and Of our chill
dren. 1t is war for the stars and stripes, for
the American Republic, and for that cont.
mental nationality, of which we inherited both
the name and the thing, from the Revolution
which WASHINGTON led. 1t is holy war, in
which there is to be no counting the cost, and
in which nothing is to be considered but the
overpowering magnitude of its object.


""There is not, nor will there be any, the
least idea,"" says Gov. Seward, ""existing in
the Government of suffering dissolution OF
this Union to TAKE PLACE IN ANY WAY WHAT
EVER""


This declaration, which is that Of the Presi-
dent and of every one Of his advisers, puts an
end to all compromises, which touch the exist.
ence and vitality of the nation. From the Lakes
to the Gulf there is to be no ensign Of legiti.
mate authority but the American flag, whether
it costs one year, twenty years, of war, to re.
establish it. The Republic, one and indivisi.
BILE! That is the rally cry for this war, which
those in authority announce, and to which the
people will respond.


Kentucky companies from Lynchburg to Har.
per's Ferry, if the report of that removal be
correct indicates the determination of the Rich
mond cabal, to hold Harpers Ferry as long as
they can. 1t is the Northern gate of the valley
of Virginia, and it controls the connection with
Baltimore of Western Virginia.


These Virginians con, of course, be expelled
from that position, but we fear that they will
not leave it without doing good deal Of dam.
age to the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, in the
way of destroying bridges, &c. Nothing else
would be gained by it, but it would be a re-
venge for them, for the refusal of Maryland to
join them in secession. Besides that, exam.

Some Of the secessionists in Fairfax county
are being cured of their folly, by the forced
contributions of the troops One of them, the
other day, redeemed an impressed horse, by
his value in oats, but after the troops had taken
his grain, they concluded to keep the horse
also, and went off with both, leaving the owner
with piece of State scrip in his pocket, which
he can put in O frame for his children to look
at. The Richmond junto are beseechng the
people to ""raise corn"" but for whose use ?
Men will neither SOW, nor reap, if their stacks
and barns belong to the captains of military
squads, and not to themselves, nor will any
amount of oratory upon the ""res buttons Of
'9S"" reconcile them to the impressment of their
horses, and mules, and hogs, and beeves. A
few months of the discipline of this Richmond
rump, will make the Virginians sadder and
wiser people.

That word ""peace"" is becoming more or less

the basis and the issue of this melancholy War'
Tf changed it will be war, not between the

their legitimate rights. But all TINS Is 10 DC

aiyidual is of the smallest account. II word
of mine could have the slightest influence,

on, there might be Convention OF the seeded
States. held within their own borders. one
representative might be appointed from each Oh
those States, by the Governors, to meet and eX-
anime the whole case as it now stands, arrange
and draw up a report Of their grievances, or
what they may consider as such, and report to
their several Governors the result of their delb-
erations, and the conclusions at which they
shall have arrived.


The same process might be adopted in the
States that have not seeded, and similar reports
be made to their respective Governors. ms
would be only preparatory measure TO some
thing more important. Ii a better feeling, or
understanding, could be even partially arrived
at, future Convention of all the States by their
representatives would have something to actup-
on. The difficulties might be Investigated and
provided for; the Constitution might be revised
by general consent, and if the platfoIm-sufi-
cienty ample for 100000 at the period when
the Constitution was formed-is found to be OF
neither breadth or strength to support popu-
lation of 33,000,0 900, wise and patriotic men
might suggest, according to the rules prescribed
in the original document, the Improvements
which the actual condition of the country would
seem to require The Constitution itself, in its
letter and spirit, is no doubt, the same as was
when first framed; but every thing around has
been undergoing change for near eighty years.


For peace of that kind l would be very
sincere, if not an influential, advocate. But to
expect that peace will spring up by the advo-
cacy of individuals in the midst of the din and
clash Of arms, amidst the mutually alienated
feelings of the people, and the widening of the
breach which has now separated them, would be,
in my opinion, hoping against hope. Still, we
must trust that the Almighty will oyerrule and
direct the final issues of this lamentable contest."

last Monday, wood cut, some ten inches
square, of what is called The Seat Of War;
in Virginia, with the numbers ofthe Southern
armies set down at the various points in fig
ures. Apparently, those figures were made
upon the same principles which governed the
deineation of rivers and mountains in the old
maps Of the interior of North America, and
which were put down, not where they were
known to be, but where they ought to be, and
where the makers of the maps would them
selves have placed mountains and rivers, if
they had created this continent.


In this Herald wood cut, 5000 men are
marked down, on the peninsula between York
and James rivers. That is a convenient place
TO have troops, if a movement is attempted
upon Richmond from Fortress Monroe, but
there is no evidence of their existence that we
know Of. Gen. Butler saw nothing of them in
his reconnaissance up the peninsula.


At Lynchburg, the Herald wood cut posts
%, 900 men, which is the most formidable force
yet heard of at the South.


At Fredericksburg, the wood cut gives 5000
men, which is mparatively moderate. This
is the right wing o the army Of The Poto

The work Of constructing fertilization upon
Potter's Hill is making considerable progress,
and some Of the bastions are rapidly approach
ing completion. A large number OF workmcn
are engaged, aud every exertion will be made
in order to have the work completed by the
commencement Of winter.


EFFECT or THE WAR on RELIGION.


The annual address of Bishop Potter, made
a few days ago, before the Episcopal Diocesan
Convention, makes feeling alusion to the trou-
blcs which afllict the country. Though the
world without was dark and gloomy, he thanked
God that all within the Church was peaceful
and placid: Tho Church, contrary to general
UublClDdtlOu. udu DtNl SuNuBbutucU, anu ncl
weakened BY the war. Charities and mission
ary work had fallen Of. but in other respects
there was great gain.


THE MUTTNous SOLDIERS NOT To BE SENT 10 THE


DRY ToRTUGAs.


A few weeks since. Gen. Wool wrote TO the
Secretary of War in relation to the mu,inecis
now confined at the Rip Raps. and sentenced
by Gen. Mcclellan to hard labor in the Dry
Tortugas, Florida. They are about one hun
drcd and thirty in number, and belong princi
paly TO the second Maine regiment aud the
New York regiments. The general desired to
hear the disposition OF the men, which was
granted, and on Wednesday, attended by his
stail, he visited the Rip Raps and. having them
drawn up in line, spoke as follows:


""Mutinecrs, you have been guilty Of mutiny
in the United States asmy, and that, too, at u
time when the Cxigcncics Of the occasion re
qured the loyal services o! every soldier. You
were justly condemned to hard labor in the
Dry Tortugas, and General Mcclellan would
have been justiiablc in shooting you on the
spot, but he did not want to shed blood Now,
came here to submit Two propositions TO you.
They arc these: You may either place your
selves under my disposal AMI submit to my
regulations, or proceed at once to Florida. All
Of you who are in favor Of the first proposal
will step three PAGES l,rward.""


II need scarcely be stated that the entire
line moved forward, and whilst some were SO
completely affected as 10 shed tears at the as
surancc of dclivcrancc, others rent the air with
cheer upon cheer for the veteran and kind
hearted soldier. The general has given orders
to have the men mustered into one of the New
York regiments.


REBEL PRISONERS. squad OF rebel prison

en- route from Columbus, Ohio, to Fort McIIenry

gloomy fulfliment ~ the prophecies which
many Southern men have made, in relation
to the effects Of the mad and REASONABLE
movements ofthe Cotton State leaders


buchanan was reported to have fled to
Canada, to escape an infuriated mob. which
threat ened to visit fearful rplribution upon
him for his prominent share in bringing about
the present convulsions. This report is. Of
itself sufficient reply to the proposition of
a Mr. Ingersoll, ment ioned elsewhere in the
dispatch, that five ex-Presidents, including
Buchanan, should attempt m arbitration be-
tween the Government and the insurgents.


At Washington, the public sentiment APP
pears to lie much healthier than it was on the
4th of March. This is evidenced by The fact
that a Secession paper--the ""Statos and
Union"" had been compelled to suspend in
order to avoid demolition of the piratical
establishment.


I Senator Douglas continued to exhort the
people of the Northwest TO show their might
in aiding the Government to crush out re-
belion.


General Scott says he hopes the protesta-
tions made on behalf of Virginia, that she
will permit no force to go from her borders
against Washington, are true but thinks Mr.
Lincoln had better he on the safe side, and
have an abundant military force in readiness
to coerce the rebels when necessary


The Presidents proclamation has been is
sued, ordering blockade Of Virginia ports
and all ports south of them.


The Governor of North Carolina had au-
thorized the robbery of the United States
Branch Mint, building and all, at Charlotte
vile. Such occurrences have, from oft repe-
ttion, lost the interest which formerly at
tached to them.


AT the South, the rebels had succeeded in
producing all the misery which their worst
enemies hao foretold Virginia is losing
much of her population by the flight of her
people to the Northern States for safety
Davis French General was tinkering up Fort
Sumter, in fearful anticipation Of an attack
thereon 10y the Government. F,om this it
appears that the attack upon Washington, if
it takes place at all, is to be entrusted to the
banditti organized by Ben McCuloch. The
5000 rebels at Richmond, and the 1000 at
Alexandria, are not likely to enjoy the in
spring presence of Beaurcgard.


Mobs and robberies were the order of the
day in the insurgent districts. AT Lynch
hurgh, Virginia, Colonel johnson and son, Of
Tennessee, (probably the Senstor) were mob
bed. 1t is not stated whether or not the in
juries inflicted were fatal.


The rebels seem to be poorly supplied with
arms The dupes of Davis were patiently
awaiting the news Of the capture of Wash
ington. and the imprisonment of Lincoln and
his Cabinet.


The Confederate troops at Pensacola were
leaving for their homes by hundreds, while
others less fortunate were sick and dying
from fatigue, exposure and hunger. This
does not look as though Fort Pickcns was in
danger.

ZANE THOUSAND SLAVES WANTED O BY HIRE OR PuRCHASE.--We will",,"o BY HIKE OK PUKCH ASE.-W We w II purchase or hire, for term of five years, Five Hundred or thousand Slave Laborefs, to work on tue Southern Pacific Railroad. in Texas, immediately west of Shreveport, La, in region secure and protected from invasion or molestation during the conflict which shall exist between the two sections of this coun-. try. The country through which the road passes is entirely healthy, and for the distance of some 400 or 300 miles west of Shreveport, it penetrates one of the finest agricultural countries on the continent of America.

 This company has magnificent land grant from Texas, i. c., 10,240 acres for every mile of road the company constructs, for the dis tance of 800 miles from Shreveport on the eastern, to Fl Paso on the western boundary of Texas. In times like the present. the com pany cannot command cash to pay for labor essential to the rapid development of the com pany's interest but for term of years, by hire or by the actual purchase, this company will make the most liberal and advantageous arrangements with slave-owners ill Kentucky, Missouri, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina, or elsewhere, for the hire or pure base, with payments in the most undoubted securities, of 800 or 1000 slaves. Families entire will be taken, either by hire or purchase. The com pany is enabled to propose liberal terms, be- cause of the munifcent land grants by Texas, and it's ability to purchase the iron ard roll

 

 with the construction bonds of the company, at rates almost equal to cash. All the rights of this company are fixed and vested by the laws of Texas. The company has secured the sympathy and the route on the 32d degree of parallel of latitude, has the sanction of several of the most powerful European Gov ernments-amongst them are France, Spain, Portugal, Belgium and Switzerland-a well as of large capitalists, commercial men and contractors of these countries The late Con- gress of the States passed pill, at it's last ses- sion, donating to this company, through Ari- zona, New Mexico and California some 13,- GOO .O00 acres of land, and loan of thirty-siX millions of dollars, to be repaid in postal or other public services. This bill passed the House of Representatives, was amended in the Senate, and only failed to become law, for the want of time and the startling political events familiar to the nation.

 | No company in the world has larger basis for it's successful prosecution, and no company has attracted and secured to itself the appro- bation of so many American States and Eu- ropean Governments promising so much benefit to it's stockholders, and to the world such stupendous results--bringing inevitably with it's completion across this continent, the trade of China, Japan, Australia, and the whole Pacific oast--distributing the trea- sures derivable from the trade, travel, etc, of each to every city from the Gulf of Mexico to the most Northern harbor on our Atlantic coast--giving each it's due and natural share ""a COMMERCE which has never failed to en- rich every nation on earth that has ever con trolled it in the PAST, and as it is annually ln- creasing, it will still more enrich those who shall control it in the FUTURE.

 We.want the labor, to progress with the work, for most unquestionable securities; and for It, the most liberal arrangements will be made for slave ye-oWners--giving them terms which must, we think, be satisfactory-wi out endangering by position, employment or terms of contract, the safety of the slaves themselves, or admitting the slightest uncer- tainty of ultimate payment.

 All applications will be made to Hon. V. K. Stevenson, President, Nashville, Tenn; Col Samuel Tate, President Memphis and Charleston Railroad Company, Memphis; Co!/J. R. McDaniel, Lynchburg, Va, or to myself, Memphis.

Officer Smith arrested q man in the act Of
leading his horse along the pavement. While
he was in the Office, the horse was placed in
yard near by. The man plead that there was
so much snow he didn't know where the pave
ments were, and he was igndfant Of the law on
the subject. The justice, in consideration Of
his plea, after explaining the law and warning
him to be careful in complying with the re.
quirements Of all laws, dismissed the case.
The liberated prisoner thereupon volunteered
to tell those present that he was constitutional
man, but, on being asked, said he didn't know
whether he was for the Union or not, for he
was from "" old Prince Georges"" After ask.
ing the officer if he was done with him. he de.
manded his horse to be brought out saying that
the officer had taken him away, and ought to
bring him back. He was in fair way for a
time to be rearrested for the disorderly manner
in which he persisted in calling for his horse
but considering the mild advice of the justice
to be worth attention, he simmered down, and
quietly took his horse aud departed.

With this warning TO the press and states-
men of this country, to forbear insulting the
English flag and violating international law IL
proceeds to say, in effect, that England must
discard what was formerly the law as prac-
ticed by herself, and net az she deems expedi'
ent at the present hour:


ftbe Cabinet of Washington propose to contend that we


must t. the year 1861 submit to ndure at the hands OF tne
cruisers every ndguy which ancestors have ever at any
time inflicted upon neutral flag, then we unoe''ana
win be the issue between U.s.


Not even the temperate appeal OF Gen. Scott
can moderate, were it but for single day, the
wrath of this oracle or British dignity and
moderation.

he believes that good relations between Aoefcs ano
are to be preserved by any such suggestions "" these we
have sent to Washington not OPEN controversy o"" 20
mspd restitution When that has been done. we shall DC
to discuss the other questions at issue at any length 'h
Americans may please""


Turning from Gen. Scott to Mr. Seward,
tie following passage from The Times IS no
doubt intended as sort OF apology ior con-
meeting the name of the Secretary Of State with
any public enterprise Of importance:.

Still further 10 illustrate the uDreasoning
temper of the English press, let us turn to its

in its feeling against the perpetuation OF the

of the Legislature to ascertain the position
which the General Government is determined to
occupy towards the State. Commissioners

 The object of this communication is to lay before the loyal citizens Of the Confederate States of America one of the most unJustlhble cases of desertion that has occurred since the flag of our common country was untured to the breezes of heaven. On the lst day of July last, Capt. Joseph D. Johnston,o of Ashley county Arkansas, left said county with volunteer company of sixty men, rank and tle Among the number was young man, heretofore of un- peachable character-by name, Thomas S Stillwell-he (Stillwell was elected second lieutenant by unanimous vote. The company, took shipping on board the Victoria at Gaines Landing, for Memphis, (the confederacy defray- ing the expenses.) In Memphis the company remained one week-being furnished with sup plies by the government-at which place some dissatisfaction arose in the company in relation to the naughty course pursued by said Stillwell to the privates of the company. Stllwell mounted the stump and affirmed upon his most sacred honor as a man, calling on High Heaven to witness the truth of his assertions, to wit: He came to fight his countrys battles for his country's good, not for the petty office of the second lieutenancy; that he wished the com pany to have reelection, and if they thought him unworthy the office he held, to cast their votes for another, and upon his sacred honor as a son of the south, he would shoulder his musket and fight, yea pour out the last drop of his hearts blood, by their sides as a common soldier.

 Our gallant Captain immediately ordered an election for lst lieutenant-Stillwel ran with out any opposition, and received every vote in the company. Some two days subsequent, we received orders to take the cars for Lynchburg, Virginia, from Col. Rust. We did so, and upon our arrival at Corinth, Miss, Stillwell applied to Capt. Christian for forlough to remain two days in the vicinity of that place for the pur- pose of visiting an uncle, who resided near by. Capt Christian compiled. Stwell, previous to leaving the cars, borrowed money from mem bers of the company, telling them that he would refund, upon his arrival at Lynchburg The men from whom he borrowed money are poor and had labored hard to get small sums to pur- chase clothing or uniforms for themselves, (the government not furnishing clothing.) Still we'll has returnedsto his home in Arkansas, and deserted the army. And 1 have reported him as a deserter to the secretary of war of the Confederate States. He had Transportation, as before stated, from Gaines Landing to Mem phis, supplies in Memphis, and transportation from there to Corinth, at the expense ofthe Con- federate States.

warrant for the arrest of Shattuck to be is
sued, returnable before the Justice of the
Peace at Fosters Bar


On the following morning, started fer
Fosters Bar with the warrant in my pocket.
Adrance was to follow immediately | ar
rived there about the middle of the afternoon
of the Sd day of july saw the Jnstce at that
place, Mr. O. P. Stidger, immediately after
my arrival, and had him deputize a consta-
bic to serve the warrant. Jno. s. Stidger. a
brother of the Justice, and DR.. J. Trask.
were duly deputed for that service.
On the morning of the 4th, they proceed
ed in the discharge of their dnties, and ar
rested Shattuck at Winslow Bar, in the midst
of crowd, who had assembled there 10
commemorate the birth day of our country
They brought him to Fosters about o'clock
in the afternoon Of the 4th. A large crowd

Adriance had not yet arrived. and as he
was the prosecuting witness and the only
one who could give any evidence concerning
the matter, the Justice announced that the
hearing of, the case would be postponed un-
iii O'Clock the next day, and that the prs-
oner should remain in the custody of the
fconstables.


Shattuck conversed freely with everybody
in reference to the charge against him, Civ
ing detailed and succinct account of all
matters connected with himself, Adrance
and Dascher, and frequently said that Dasch-
er was then either at Rich Bar on Feather
river, or at Rabbit creek. He WAS freeuent-
Iy admonished by the Justice not TO hold
conversation with any one on the subject in
his (the Justices presence. That he should
have IL fair and impartial hearing and equal
and exact justice. That moth NO that the
prisoner could say would have any weight

( Adrance did not come on the 9Th nor 9th
On the 7th the Justice issued subpoena
for him, and deputed Henry Haddon to serve
it. Haddon proceeded to Marysvllle, found
Adrance, and on the Sth they arrived at
Fosters about 4 O'Clock P NJ As they de
scended the hill to the town, they were rec
ognized anG soon almost everybody residing
there congregated at the Justices Office, all
being anxious TO witness the meeting be-
tween the accused and accuser. When Adri-
ance arrived. Shattuck was sitting in the
Justices Office. On seeing Adriance, Shat
tuck arose, stepped forward to meet and held
out his hand towards Adriance, remarking
rs he did So"" How are you, Henry?"" To
which Adriance replied, taking Shattuck bv
the hand"" How are you, De Witt?"" No
further remarks were made between hem.


The Justice in a few mon1ents afterwards
called the Court TO order, read 10 Shattuck
the complaint and asked him whether he
was ready for xE..nination. The justice told
hi'9i he was entitled to counsel If he wished
any, and that if he wanted any witnesses,
/ time should be given him to procure them.
Shattuck remarked that he did not wish tor
any counsel, as he had committed no offence
against the laws of his country, and as for
Witnesses Adrlanee was the only one he
wanted. The Justice told him that the
charge against him WAS serious one, aud
that if Dascher was living the evidence OF
that fact was of great importance, and that
| if the accused knew where Dascher was, he
would postpone the Investigation and send il

was not necessary to do so, and proposed
that the examination should proceed. Where

The country through which the road

 passes is entirely healthy, and for the distance

 of some 400 or 500 miles west of Shreveport,

 arrangements with slave-owners in Kentucky,

 Missouri, Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina,

 or elsewhere, for the hire or purchase, with

 payments in the most undoubted securities, of

 500 or 1000 slaves. Families entire will be

 taken, either by hire or purchase. The com pany is enabled to propose liberal terms, be- cause of the fnunifcent land grants by Texas, and it's ability to purchase the iron and roll- ing stock for the entire road across Texas,

every man who apologies for secession and

variousy stated at from five to ten hundred,
left New Orleans about the goth of May, under
command of Ben Mccullough, for Fort Smith,
Arkansas. The fact proves the total falsity of
the reports of immense bodies Of secession
troops raised in Arkansas. The probable OBJ.
ject of McCulloughs force, is to operate in the
Indian Territory.


On Friday night, the number Of regiments
concentrated in Chambersburg, was eleven, and
the expectation there was, that force would
be soon thrown forward to Hagerstown.


We have no advices of the Ohio troops
coming east on the Baltimore and Ohio rail.
road, since Thursday, when they were at Graf.
ton. There are no reports Of secession troops
on that road, farther west than Marinsburg.


AS to affairs on the Mississippi, we adopt
the following from the Chicago Tribune of last
Thursday:


""The letter of our correspondent at Cairo
indicates that there is o general expectation, in
that camp, of visit from General Pillows
forces, now concentrating in Tennessee. In
spite of the reports of travellers and spies we
are by no means sure that an onslaught upon
our boys is intended. AS we read the Southern
| papers, and as we cOnstrue the contradictory
and often absurd reports Of men fresh from the
| South, the danger of a movement upon Cairo
has been daily diminishing since the Chicago
troops went to occupy that place. Boosting Of
what can be done, and will be done is common
enough, especially in New Dahomey; but we
have failed to learn it, if there has been, or is
now, any serious design TO drire oar troops out.
General Pillow will take Cairo as General Lee
has taken Washington-in the newspapers !;
and if he has gathered any considerable forces
at Memphis, Randolph, and Columbus, they
are to prevent descent of our boys upon the
South, rather than to support an attack from
the South upon us. And if, as our correspond.
ent intimates, there are ten thousand rebel SOL
diers gathered along the river, and in posses.
sion Of dozen steamers, they will not move
until the Illinois boys show them their advance
guard and then they will run as fast as their


legs can carry them""


Dsyn The following items from Fortress Mon.
roe, are brought by steamer which left on
Friday evening:


""Com Pcndergrast will not allow boat to
90 up with a flag Of truce, although parties
here are anxious to bring away relatives.


""The Quaker City yesterday bsought up the

patch says the rebels outnumbered us three
to one. After the day had been won by US,
fresh rebel troops were substituted for those
who were defeated. The ammunition of
our artillery giving out, as caisson were
rushing at full speed for a new supply,
the movement was construed by team
sters and civilians into new retreat, and
panic among them occurred. They ran
for their horses, and without waiting to as
certain the facts, they cut the traces of their
wagon horses and commenced frightened
retreat. The CONSERVATION thus created
communicated itself to the soldiers in the
rear of the column, at the very moment
when charge of fresh cavalry from Man
assas Junction was made upon them. 1t
was nothing more nor less than a stampede.
The enemy were themselves unaware of it.


The result is in great measure attribn-
table to the tardiness of Patterson.


Gov. Spragues bravery through the
whole day challenged universal admiration,
and aided by Mr.. CASTOR, Paymaster of the
l4th New York, succeeded in bringing some
kind of order out of this chaos. The brave
Rhode Islanders were formed in the rear, to
be ready to oppose the advance of the pur-
suers.


The number of killed and wounded has
been greatly exaggerated.


Mcdowell behaved with the greatest bra
very. This, however, was unavailing to
arrest the panic in the rear. The Fire Zou-
aves fought like devils. The New York
list, 18th, and 9th, and the Minnesota and
Maine regiments were the praise of all.-
They were moved down like grass by the
batteries as they advanced. The flag of
the Minnesota regiment was completely rid

The comparatively hourishiDg condition oil the ihde-

Riding over to the creek we encountered some difficulty in passing the sentnes on the railroad, and in fulfilment of the pledge there and elsewhere assumed l am compelled to omit any description of the de lenses at this point. They are, however, ofsuch a character as to render the position nearly impregnable as any human agency could ac- complish The batteries have been erected by and are chiefly under the direction of very en- ergetic officers of our navy, among whom commanders Lynch and Porter. They are man. ned and protected by large detachments ofinfan- try from the Arkansas and North Carolina reg iments The only points upon which am al lowed by my pledge to make any observations, relate to the bombardment te which this place was subjected in the commencement ofthe war, when Lincoln's vessels were so roughly bearded and so gallantly repulsed. Capt. Morgan, fine officer in Col. Fagans Arkansns regiment, gave me much information in relation to this af- fair. The locality still bears strong marks ofthe severity and accuracy of the enemy's fire. The railroad wharf was burned by tReir shells, and large holes in the car and wharehouse show where the eight and ten-inch round shot and shell poured through. Several fragments of thick railroad iron, torn and doubled up by the balls are scattered around. It is wonderful how the little garrison escaped such storm of shot and shell behind such frail parapets; but not man was killed or wounded, and the only lives lost were those ofan ancient horse and res pectabe hen, whose surviving partner crowed proud defiance to the enemy over the mangled remains of his beloved slaughtered spouse. This heroic rebel is now the property of an officer of Col. Bates's Tennessee regiment, who has sent him to Memphis to crow like defiance to Ere monts gunboats, when they undertake their threatened reduction of that gallant city. Leav- ing Aquia Creek and the neighboring batteries, next proceeded to visit the various camps in the vicinity, and the headquarters of Gen. Holmes, who commands this division of the Confederate army. IL was good distance from the river, and the day was far spent before I reached the picturesque locality, in which some halfa dozen regiments are encamped, including the lst North Carolina State troops, the l2th North Carolina, Georgia, an Arkansas and Virginia regiment and fine battery and corps of ar tllerists from Baltimore. Nothing could be more agreeable and picturesque than the loca- ton of their camps, at place called Brooks Station, on the railroad from Richmond The country is hilly, broken, we'll wooded, and abounds in streams and springs of pure water. and the people around are famous for their hos pitality and kindness."

 | MEMPHIS, Sept l9-From the Appeal of this | morning reliable intelligence was received here last night that interesting military nov ements were l taking place near Elizabethtown on the Nashville and Louisville railroad, 43 miles from the latter | city. The railroad bridge over Rolling Fork creek several miles noth of Muldrough's hill, has been burned by the friends of the South. All telegraphc l communication with the enemy is cut off. It was supposed that Rousseau's division ffedetal troops 1 were pressing forward rapidly to occupy Mul. droughs hill, but wouldbe prevented by the de- | struction of the bridge. The confederate troops | from Middle Tennessee were also moving up the | railroad for like purpose, and reached Bowling Green early yesterday in considerable force where | they were reinforced by large body of Kentuck- | ians We learn that Gen. A. $. Johnston passed from Nashville up to the headquarters of the army at Columbus yesterday. We learn from passengers 1 from Columbus yesterday that excitement existed there in consequence of receiving intelligence, re- lably authenticated, that 1000 federal troops had l landed 9 miles above headquarters on the Ken | lucky side. They came down Tuesday morning and were reinforced on the following night, by what number is unknown.

 The Jackson Mssssippian of day before yester- day, says that on Saturday last Gen A $. John ston teegraphed Gov. Pettus to forward all the troops he could spare to Kentucky.

Let the sons of Kentuckv, the descendants of those gallant men, whose names adorn the brighest pages of our his tory decide the fate of our own State. Our ban ner has hoated proudly wherever it has been dis played; under it we have fought the battles of the country in the north and in the s0uth--under its folds our fathers drove back the savages from the homes of infant Indiana and Ohio. In gratitude the sons of those whose fathers were rescued by ours from the tomahawk and the sea ping knife, return to drag us in chains at the feet ot relentless des potsm which is already pressing heavily upon themselves. When in the hour of our cOuntry's peril the extreme north slunk away from the rag ing contest thousands of kentuckians poured into the frozen north to fight on British soil the bait les of New England; in return she sends us her hosts of fanatics to despoi us of our homes and our liberties, and through Wm. H. Seward, she invites the outcasts of all nations to join in the carnival of blood. Let more fling to the breeze the proud standard of Kentucky in every valley and on every hill top Let it's fold be kissed by the breezes of heaven. Let our lone star shine in emblem Of hope from the deep sky y-blue of our banner over the brothers who join in the grasp of friendship, and let the soldiers motto of State bespeak under the providence of God the strength of the cause which he commits to our hands.

Fishers body servant, who mas ms .te masters watch, sword and other effects, passed through Petersburg yesterday alter noon, in discharge of the melancholy duty of delivering the articles to the lamented Colonel's family. This servant secured splendid Colts rife from the side ot fede- ral soldiers body, and disposed of the gun in Richmond to-day for $lO0.

 The bugler of the sixth regiment found a silver half dollar and two quarters ln the pocket of dead Yankee after the fight, which had been struck by ball, and bent so as to resemble cup in appearance, thus showing the great force of balls eJected from improved arms.

 Capt. York, of company l, encountered one of the enemy within ten steps of him, with rife drawn, but the captain was too quick for his adversary. Before the latter could pull trigger, Capt. York shot hlm dead, and procured his rifle. The rifle pas sed through Petersburg yesterday, destined to the captains wife.

 The Alabama fourth regiment were Tn the thickest of the fight, and we regret to hear that they were badly cut to pieces.

 The Maryland regiment had a forward position in this wing of the army, and all accounts agree, that they fought with the greatest desperation. It is said they have suffered severely. These men are away l from friends, cut off from all means of com munication, and need all the assistance that can be extended them. Many of them, we are sorry to hear, have lost clothing and everything else that could conduce to their l comfort.

 We are told that Gen. Johnston fought most heroically, and during one hour ln the | afternoon, when there were indications of wavering on the part of our men, 1t IS sad the General dismounted seven different times, and addressed his men in the most encouraging terms. One time he seizea the colors of company, and rushing to the front, bid his men follow. This had the desired effect, and inspired his troops to most desperate enthusiastic degree. ] Monday morning, just before the train .t departed from Manassas, some of our men .''

 a painful degree.

 st Dispatches have been received at Mol tn gomery, detailing the losses of the Alal

 ma troops at Manassas. From the ten ol. of the dispatches 1t Is inferred that none ed Col. Seibel's regiment were hurt. The he regiment suffered severely-Col. Jont ct, it's commander, being reported as killed.

 Fifteen of Capt. Dawson's company, ,ls Magnolia Cadets, and seventeen of Cal

 Goldsby's company, from Selma, were Xxi as ed, among whom was our friend and cotel e. porary, J :, w. Kennedy, the Selma Issl

 It is said that other companies of this ] of giment (4th) suffered terribly from t Id enemy's fire, but they stood their groun Is. and aided the chivalric Johnston to W

 the victory.

 A company from Huntsville was in t n' 4th regiment, and the casualties among

5. Steamer Saginaw.


The Hongkopg Press of the 10th of August
says:


"" The U. S. storekeeper at Shanghae was a
politician named Judge"" Cleary. We be-
lleve he earned the title from having been n
magistrate in California. 1t seems Ly the
last advices from Shanghae that this man. in
connection with Col. Ward, Cthe celebrated
hilbuster) Capt. Allen, (Who brought the
steamer surprise from California, y and Capt
Lynch Oor some years in command of the
steamer Antelope, and lately Of The Contest, }
purchased the schooner Neva. equipped her
from the u. 5. naval stores, and intend to
cruise off this coast as a rrivateer. rhe
Saginaw hurried up yesterday on the intell-
gence being made known, and, we make small
DOUBT, will capture her.


Ward Is desperate character, and has
large sum of money, which he has made in
the Imperial service He was connected with
Walker, and is a sailor by profession Lynch
is Northerner. We fancy the affair will
end in grief The craft is too small, and
suitable crew can hardly be had in time
We hear that two Of the Saginaw's officers
resigned, upon learning the object of her
trip, but subsequently withdrew their resig-
nations""


We learn from other sources that Lynch
was formerly sporting man. in san Fran
cisco, and left here about ""A year ago on the
Nor'wester. For several years, he was in
command of a steamer on this coast.


The Neva is small schooner of GO or 20
tons, formerly a pleasure yacht on the coast
of China, and said to be a pretty fast sailer


SCme are of opinion that She is intended
only to rob Clinamen along the coast of
China, as she is too small to carry n very
large gun Allen is in command of the Neva


From Capt. Luctie. of the ship Lotus we
learn that this man Allen worked his passage
over on the Surprise, which left this port
about four months ago. He expresses no
doubt of the rebel procIivities of Lynch, who
was formerly a midshipman in the United
States Navy. He ran the Antelope for some
time in the China seas, and is perfectly ia
miiar with the coast


The Neva is a fore and-aft schooner Of
about one hundred tons, and can mount not
more than four effective guns The Naval
Storekeeper, after fitting ont the Neva with
her armament from the property of Uncle Sam
threw up his charge and went on the Neva.
Some ten days prior TO the departure Of the
Lotus, the Saginaw left Hougkong in pursuit
of the rebel craft. The Captain of the Lotus
is of the opinion that her capture is ineyita-
ble.-AHa."

order that said Congress may, if possible, ar.
range for an adjustment Of existing troubles
by means Of the ballotbox rather than the
sword""


A man must be stark mad, who can dream
of putting down by the ballot-box, what is es.
sentislly rebellion against the ballot-box.


The Gulf States have appealed to the sword,
from the lawful election Of President by the
people, and the present struggle is to enforce
the supremacy of the ballot box by the bayonet,
and there is nothing else in it.


The ballot.box has been tried, and now ii is
the cartridge. box which is being tried. We
had Presidential election last November, and
there is to be no other until 1864. If these
Maryland sympathzers with secession really
wish the ballot-box to govern, let them persuade
their friends on the Gulf to yield to the election
of Mr.. Lincoln, and there will be no occasion
for the sword. The sword is now drawn, and
will not be sheathed, until the ballot.box is IN.
conditionally submitted to.


THE MISERY OF EASTERN VIRGINIA.


Eastern Virginia has plunged herself, through
the folly Of her public men, into an abyss Of
misery, Of which the traces, in the wrecked
fortunes of families, will remain during the
present generation, and ofwhich the traditions
will survive to the second and third genera.
tions. What is happening there is rs com.
plete an extinguishment and wiping out Of the
old prosperity, as happened in the St. Domingo
revolution, and possibly to be attended with
the same circumstances of bloodshed and hor.
ror.


The negro property of Eastern Virginia,
when these disturbances commenced, was
marketable at two hundred millions of dollars.
Now, if not annihilated as an article Of prop.
erty, it has become both unproductive and un-
saleable. 1t cannot be made to pay either
principal or interest, and every day deepens
the gloom which hangs over its future.


No form Of property has escaped this whirl.
wind of destruction. Railroads have ceased
to be anything more than Government ma
chimes, kept running at the expense of the
owners. Bank stocks have become worthless,
and the banks have not even solvent debtors
enough to enable them to redeem their notes.
State bonds, in which the means Of widows,
orphans, and trustees, are largely locked up,
have ruinously deprecated, and the payment
of interest upon them must be long postponed,
if ever resumed. City property, in the few
cities in Eastern Virginia, al Of which are IN.
der blockade, cannot possibly pay any rents.
Everything is going to waste. Buildings,
fences, tools, will all be in worse condition
year hence, than they are to-day. Everybody
has ""gons to the wars"" industry is broken
up in all departments; mems minds are un.
settled; few will plant, where it is uncertain
who may gather the crop; the general poverty
must become intense; and those who have
must be eaten up by those who have
nothing but the arms to enable them to dictate
their own terms.


The lands of Eastern Virginia remain as
intrinsically valuable as they ever were, and
are very likely, indeed, to be carried up to such
prices as exist at the North, as the ultimate
consequence of current events. But this is a
consequence, not possible so Immediately, as
to be of any advantage to the present proprie-
tors of Eastern Virginia, if they even escape
confiscations for their treason. If new pop.
ulation is attracted into Virginia, it will be by
the low prices of lands, gotten rid of by ruined
owners upon any terms. The possible, perhaps
probable rise in the price Of these lands, can
only occur after they get into new hands.


On every side, and in every aspect, we can
see nothing but individual ruin for these East
srn Virginians, who are SO largely responsible
for the present difficulties.


1t was they who stimulated the madness of
the Gulf States, by the promise of eventual
cooperation. 1t was they who might, at any
time, even after the actual secession outbreak
oflast November, have arrested it by declaring
q resoute and unconditional adherence to the
Union. But they would take counsel of moth,
ing but their own folly and arrogance, and,
vainly dreaming that they could dictate terms
to the nation, have proved by the event, that
they possessed only the poor power of running
themselves.

only with Aiut.lock muskets. Only about 500

1t is innocence whose eye is downcaat real
worth which bends its head. and genuine in
tegiity that shlinks from the stare of the
world. Crime and hypocrisy and humbug
hold bold front, look you full in the face at
every turn, and seem to defy scrutiny even
while they inviteit.


Swindcrs, forgers, hotel thieves pocket
book droppers, watch-stufers, and even the
Peter Fnnks, are gentlemanly looking fel-
lows, wear good clothes, smoke the best of
cigars, indulge in shilling drinks, sport heavy
jewelry, have the most unacceptonable nous
taches and can talk honest, look honest, and
smile with all the JUNCTION of the purest and
most trustworthy man in the community


This is not unlrrquently proved by the
fact that after an extensive robbery or some
other daring crime has been committed, the
police very often arrests an innocent person
as its perpetrator, solely because he has a
down look, can't give ""di.tinct account
of himself and unluckiIy happened to be
caught in the ncighbolhood, ""un der suspi-
cious circumstances"" where the misdeed was
accomplished. Arrest an innocent man, an
honest man, and charge him with being the
of some hcinous offence, and he
will in all appearances, look and act the de-
tected rogue TO periection-i. E. according 30

ble, change color, hesitate, stammer in his
Speech get confused, contradict himself, and
feebly assert his innocence, until the crowd,
10y his own conduct, will condemn elf hand,
and be ready to lynch him. Arrest the real
rogue and how firm, how ingenious his de-
meanorl How grandly innocent he looks,
with what scorn and expression Of pride he
repels the accusation? No quiyering of the
lip, no trembling of the limbs no change Of
voice. no blanching Of the cheeks. lie tells

The importance OF the question relative to the
arrest of Mason and Slidell and the difficulty with
England arising therefrom is further manifested by
the fact that the steamer Africa which was to have
sailed for Liverpool to-day has been detained until
tomorrow afternoon, by order of Lord Lyons, for
the purpose Of transmitting by her his response
to the dispatches which came from the British go.
yernment by special Queens messenger on board
the Europa. Captain Seymour, the Queens mes
sengcr, and special messenger from our Minister
at London, Mr.. Adams, left Boston last evening for
Washington by the shore route, via this city

morning train to Washington, and thus be enabled
to bring back the dispatches Of Lord Lyons in time
for the Africa. 1t may be, however, that the
Africa will not leave this port before Friday morn

Heaven"" designed by that celebrated artist,
Mrs Lilly Martin Spencer; the other, "" A Slow

figures, and ""0ur Father who art in Heaven""
are .wo of the dneat steel plates ever published.
The double extension colored fashion plate, c0n-
tains nine figures, seven more than are given by
any other magazine. These plates have excited
the admiration Of all countries, as nothing like
them are published anywhere. We may search
the English, FRENCH aud American magazines


for anything like an approach to them. The

WASHING MAcnISE-We visited few days


ago, Mr. Jesse Urmy's machine shop, in Pye's


building, in Orange street between 9th and 9th


sts. and amongst the many useful articles we


saw, of his own manufacture, was his washing,


pressing and wringing machine, made on an


tirely new plan. The receptacle for the clothes


is three feet in diameter aud about six inches


deep, with zinc tub in the centre about one


foot in diameter, with lattice bottom. This


tub is used for pressing the water out of the


clothes after they are washed this is done by


screw which is fastened in frame connected


with bench on which the tub rests. The outer


tub in which the clothes are pllced for washing,
has u tuted bottom as well as the wooden cylin


der, under which the clothes pass when they are
undergoing the washing operation This cylin-
5 der is turned by the hand with crank and


can be turned either backward or forward. The
tub has n rotary motion. We witnessed tile
washing of several articles of clothing among
which WAS cloth overcoat, and all Of which
were washed in cold water with brown soap
The machine performed very well particularly
on the cloth cont, which was quite dirty and
J greasy. This machine is we'll suited FOR large
, hotels, although small families would find II q
grent labor saving machine. The invention dis
\ plays considerable ingenuity, aud shonld prove
i rcmunerative to MIR. Urmy.

Richmond Di-ppDch Of the 2lst says:


The strength of the enemy in Western
Virginia l. believed to lie between forty aud
fifty thousand. There are now under Gen
Reynolds, in and about Randolph county,
about twenty-five Thousand General Cox
has between six and seven thousand in the
kanawha alley, and General Bosencranz is
said to have fifteen thousand-some say elev-
en- to twelve thousand. Thus there are cer-
tainly not less than forty and there may be
nearly fifty thousand of the enemys forces
operating in Western Virginia.


We will not, for prudential reasons, pre-
sent in detail statement of the strength of
ouI forces in that qaurter. Suffice it to say
that Generals Lee and Loring have a supe-
rior force TO cope with, and that Generals
Floyd and Wise are laboring under the dis
advantage Of q considerable disparity of
numbers We understand that several regi
ments have been ordered from Lynchbugg to
reinforce our army beyond Lewisburg, and
that still further forces will be sent forward
to this same destination very promptly


The news brought down 10y the Central
train yesterday was that General Lee had
again fallen back upon his former position

| from for some strategic reason not transpired


The army of Generals Floyd and Wise have
changed their position from Sewali's Noun

Of the Seweil bat furt her to the west, in the

now occupy is upon wh4t is called the Will

his march that Generals Floyd and Wise
have proceeded up the Wilderness road to
Meadow Bluff. If the movement Of General
toseucrauz be correctly reported we may
expect to hear Of another battle in a few
days. The enemy considerably outnumber
us, and the fight viii come off, if at all, be-
fore the rrintorcements just ordered on to
General Floyd will be able to reach him.

sumo than the Board Of Supervisors will not

 ing started on Foot for Fredericksburg. Af ter walking thirty miles l got on-the train and arrived at my desi .ation, fortunate in not once having my passport demanded. At Frelericks- b,rg Union man from Maryland told me that

 it was not possible for me to get nearer to the 1 Potomac for if were to attempt it. would i be infallibly taken as spy and shot; that he himself wanted to get to ia t!more, out of the

 rebel States; but that if was of no use. He

 was not. however, going to join any of their military bodies as long as he could escape from

 it. Finding it impossible to get to the river without passport went to Capt. Thorburn and offered to ship as seaman for the rebel na- | y ance with an advertisement saw in one of the newspapers. The captain accepted me, and said he would be glad to get three or four hundred like me. He then gave me pass for Acquia Creek to Capt. Lynch, commanding the batteries there. On my arrival 1 reported to Capt. Lynch.

 After leaving this gentleman, who told me l would be put on guard duty that night (Thurs- day) turned over in my mind how l should contrive to reach the vessel of war which 1 saw riding at anchor about two or three miles from the shore, and which I subsequently, found to be the Pawnee. At length determined on swim ming. Chance favored me, for Capt. Lynch ol- dered me to go to the point to help put on some

 weather boards on the cars that had been knock

 was got through I asked a soldier if he would

 take swim. He said not till sundown, for

 which it wanted one hour. l was glad of this

 and intimating that would at once, pulled of

 my clothes and entered the water. There were

 at the time about forty men within pistol shot

 of me- l suppose none of them had the least

 idea that would dare try to reach the Pawnee which will account for my not being molested

 until had gained distance of about half g

 mile from the shore, when ri1ed cannon was

 fired to bring me back but as paid no heed to

 it, another shot was fired, which went right over

 my head, and fell into the water about eight feet

 ahead of me. Several more shots were fired, but they all fell short I now struck out boldly fol : the Pawnee, but found the current too strong

 for me, and, it then being ebb tide, was carried down the river.

 The sun had long since set, but the moon , shone out bright to light me on my way. Find

 ing it impossible to reach the Pawnee, 1 en f deavored to reach some point on the Maryland shore, occasionally changing my position, and 2 sometimes floating on my back, by way of rest

 Sometimes, too ould have to chafe my fas stiffening limbs to keep up the circulation of the s blood. But, notwithstanding the peril in whicl I was placed, never once lost heart, but looked I up to God for deliverance. Nor did I look ul I to or trust to Him in vain. Nearer and neare :, came to the Maryland shore, and as 1 gained 9 the beach, three miles below, and opposite tt IT where had started from, seven bells were strucl ? from the Pawnee indicating half-past seve, f o'clock. I had consequently, been five hour '. S and half in the water. As soon as had rest

 ed little began to walk to and fro on tn, T beach, naked as was after which walked u] T opposite to where the Pawnee was at anchor . but not daring to trust my aching limbs again, 2 oo gave up the idea of swimming to the ship tha T night. I then lay down on the sand and con r .. trived to obtain two hours sleep. Next morn E ing, at daylight started for the ship. I ha . swan considerable distance, and was about r mile from the Pawnee when was seen from tn f. ship; boat was sent off, and 1 was picked u if and taken on board, where I was treated wit :. the uraatost humo nitv and kindness hy Gantai"

FLOYD's WOUNDS.


There is no doubt that FLOYD
was wounded at the battle of Car
niiex's Ferry, as stated by our
correspondent, on the authority OF
the rescued prisoners at Cross
Lanes. A highly colored rebel
description of the affair in the
Lynchburg Republican SAYS:


""The battle had ragged but 20
minutes when our gallant General
was very painfully wounded in
the right arm, the ball entering
near the elbow and passing out
near the wrist, without breaking
a bone. We retired him short
distance under the hill, and had
the wound dressed by Surgeon
Gleaves, and in ten minutes he
was again moving along our lines
encouraging his men by his pres
ence and his voice. At later
stage of the fight MIME ball
tore through the lapel OF his coat
and another through the cantle of
his saddle. Indeed, it is the
wonder OF all how he escaped
death. None but his Staff and
Surgeon knew be was wounded
until the close of the fight. He
is now suffering much pain"""

 ""But no words of praise can give you an adequate conception of the enthusiastic greeting extended to us by the Virginians. Its warmth and cordiality surpassed our most sanguine expectations, and cold and listless must have been the heart which failed to be touched by the brilliant oya- tlons offered us

 No spectacle that I ever witnessed, sur passed in animation and gayety these gath erings of the beauty and chiyalry of the Old Dominion The men would cheer us, not merely with the lips, but from the heart, give us a cordial grasp of the hand and a few words ol kindly welcome, while the sweet smiles of the women subdued hearts which would refuse to acknowledge any other conquerer. The soldiers were liter ally wreathed with flowers gathered by fair hands and whose exquisite hues seemed to have caught additional brightness from the light of the eyes that shown upon them. Nor are the Virginians of to-day less re- nowned for elegant and courteous hospi- tality than they were one hundred years ago.

The Nevada Democrat has the following:
pretty severe snow storm occurred during
the latter part of last night, the ground be-
ing covered to the depth of two inches at
daylight this morning. The snow played the
very mischief with the fruit trees. Nearly
all the apple, peach and pear trees were
broken down, and we Judge that at least half
the fruit in this neighborhood is DESTROYED.
The loss of SO much of this years crop, and
the destruction of trees, is great disap-
pointmeut to fruit growers, who were be-
ginning to congratulate themselves that the
fruit was beyond the reach of frost.

Before leaving Missouri they burnt al the hay-stacks and corn-cribs in the vicinity, t prevent our forces from obtaining forage in cas of pursuit.

 Our latest news from the National army whic recently landed at Port Royal, South Carolina is obtained from rebel sources. A dispatch iron Charleston to the Richmond Enquirer, date, the l4th inst, states that General Sherman ha, taken possession of Pinckney Island and seize, all the able-bodied negro men, whom he had sen to the fleet. Up to that time no attempt ha, been made to land on the main land, though thu South Carolinians were evidently much afraid o 1t. The effect of the capture of the batteries d Port Royal IS described, even by the rebel themselves, to be very disheartening to them. I seems to have created perfect panic through out the entire South. In Savannah, especially this was the case-so abject being the terro which our success inspired, that all the men a! well as women were running away, Late ru mors render it probable that the fifteen thousand troops collected at Annapolis, under command O General Burnside, are intended to reinforce Gen eral Sherman-in which case it is quite likel, that Savannah will have something to be fright ened about. Meantime the authorities of Soutl Carolina-we learn from the Richmond Dis patch-have been communicating with the Con federate authorities on the subject of raising the black flag against the ""invaders."" The Dis patch believes that General Lee has received or ders from the War Department urging that those captured must be regarded as prisoners of war but intimates that the authorities of South Caro- lima will disregard this order and pursue the course adopted by Governor Wise in the case O. Old John Brown.

 We arc likely to hear soon of another exploit by our great fleet of war vessels. A dispatch from Savannah, dated the l4th, states that il passed Fernandina, Florida, on the previous day, standing southward, and it is understood al Fortress Monroe that it has gone to Pensacola.

 UNION RIsINGs IN EAST TENNEssEE.-Thc Nor folk Day Book of Thursday says that the ac counts of bridge burning in East Tennessee have been greatly exaggerated. The bridge over Hol sten river has been repaired, and the telegraph Brownlow's and Andy Johnsons gangs are in the mountains about Bristol. giving trouble. '~ A letter from Lynchburg, dated 18th says :- A train has arrived from East Tennessee, which brings later intelligence than heretofore receiv. ed. The fight on Sunday night was between 100 temporary volunteers under Captain Miller, who went out from Bristol. The fight took place at the river, about twelve miles from Bristol Two of Capt. Miler's men were slightly wounded and himself injured. He was to reach Richmond Tuesday evening. Nine traitors were killed, two wounded and two taken prisoners.

 Our forces have fallen back to Pound Gap Ky and are pursued by 1000 fedcrals. We have a large quantity of baggage, munitions, artillery etc.

 Tine Union men have camp of 1000 to 1900 at Elizabethtown, near the Carolina line, about 20 miles from Bristol and another of about 700 near Strawbury Plains. They are both increas ing. and they threaten to take possession of the railroad and burn the bridges.

 Knoxville has been placed under martial law by the rebels. Forty five prisoners have been taken by Gen. Floyd. A portion of them were captured while holding the recent election in the northwest. Their poll book was also captured with the names of the voters.

 Gov. Harris is evidently afraid of the results of his treason. He has issued an address. call ing on the people to furnish every double b,r reled shot gun and rifle they may possess, to arm the volunteers for protecting the soil of Ten nessce from pollution by the footsteps of the in vadcr.

 THE announcement of the capture of the rebel Commissioners, Messrs Mason and Slidell, who recently succeeded in eluding the vigilance ot tho blockading fleet, and escaped to Cardenas on board the steamer Theodora, will be hailed with joy throughout the country They were captured by party from on board the United States steam-frigate San Jacinto, Capt. Wilkes recently from the coast of Africa, but which, fol six weeks past, has been cruising around tn. West India Islands. Capt Wilkes, it appears while coaling at Havana, learned that the rebe Commissioners were to leave on the 7th, or board the English mail steamer Trent, and de termined to capture them. He accordingly over hauled the steamer in the Bahama Channel, ant l sent messenger on board to demand their sur render. After some demur on their part, th, Commissioners, with their Secretaries, wer, transferred to the ""San Jacinto,"" together witl their papers, which are understood to be yer, voluminous. Capt.

no excitement or disturbance whatever attending the

about the polling booths, one would not have sup
posed that State and County contest was being

was observed the votes will show. 1t Is currently

Jackson, and th , enemy under Gen. Reynolds.

 The account of the battle, as given in our issue of Saturday, Is substantially correct, a. stated by persons who were in the battle. The enemy commenced the attack at seven o'clock on the morning of Thursday, and gallantly maintained the contest until one o'clock when they were finally forced back with tremendous slang hter, and then commenced a precip tate retreat. Our forces numbered about 40O0 or 4500, and the enemy was supposed to be from 4000 to 5000 strong. Three times did they march to the assault of Gen. Jackson's positon and were driven as often back with heavy loss, supposed to be 1000 to l200 in killed and wounded. Geu. Jacksons men were securely inirenched behind stroug breastworks, and suffered but very little loss, estimated at not more than forty or fifty in all.

 The reg inenrs which took part in the fight were the 18th and l2th Georgia 23d, 3lst and 44th Virginia. 3d Arkansas, Col Hansbprough $ | Virginia battalion, aud Col. Baldwin's regi- m-ut which latter came up after the battle had

Gen. Jackson, it Is stated, did not thuk It prudent to pursue the fying enemy, being fearful of being drawn into an ambu,cade. He was busily engaged in strength enlng his intrcnchments, and preparing for a 1 renewal of the attack, should the enemy be re intorced.

stances Of every age and people The mean

nresent times, will appear 10y IA brief eXani-
nation of the CONTEXT. 1t seems that Paul,
the great Apostle OF the Genliles. had been
preachng Christ cruciIied to the ido'atrous
Fphesans, and that many were converted by
his powerful presentation of Gospel truth.


All great moral relormatons are sure to
bring trouble to those who oppose their pro-
gress Human nature remaining as it Is, this
must be so in the very nature of things
Looking 30 this feature Of opposition to NOR
al progress, the Great Teacher declared that
lie had come mot TO bring peace. but

hunted 10y both Jews and Fngans. from his
cradle, until be was Eurgup between heaven
and earth, the scorn Of wicked men and the
scoff Of devils, The truth is of universal APP
plicati0n. Begin good work. and some
bodys evil work is injured, hence the outcry
and opposition.


1t happened on this occasion that Deme-
trus, certain si,versmith of Elhesus, with
other craftsmen of the same sort. had found
lucrative employment, in making silver
shrines for the goddess Diana, who had a f-
nous temple at that city. These ,hrnes were
psrehased hy visitors and carried away as
mementoes, to be carefully preserved amongst
their hosehold gods. BY this means the fame
Of the goddess was spread abroad. and the
wealth of the craftsmen greatly increased
Under these circumstances, it's no matter of
marvel that the preaching of Pnul against
idolatry should have stirred up furious
mob against the siversmiths 1t is true that
the salvation of world was at stake in
the nIa4tes hut what was that compared with
,he gains"" Of the slversnilhs? This last
was substantial benefit that came home to
every mans business and bosom; the former
they looked upon IA as spiritual affair that
might or might not prove blessing So it
. was, they determined that ncihcir business s.
nor the fame of the goddess should suffer on
account of the new doctrine, aud we're aboat
to put the great Apostle through course Of
modern lynching, when the town clerk cane
forth and quclled the disturbance. Without
doing violence to the meaning of the text
the following paraphrase OF the language will
show its application to the American people
at the present moment:

Events are progressing with great rapidity,
and if this war continues much longer, the
slaves of the South, now used as laborers at.
tending Southern military operations, will be
employed as soldiers to fight us. That is not
thought of to-day, because slaves have been too
costly and valuable to be used as soldiers, but
when they cease to be saleable, they will be
offered liberty by their own masters, as the con.
dition of fighting in the ranks of the rebellion.
They will be less dangerous in the army, than
on the plantations, and the pressure Of con.
tinued war, will require the fighting men of
whatever color in the Gulf States, the popula.

Strongly suspecting the gold dust exhib-
tied so freely by Jim Stewart to be the same
that was stolen from the Dodges, Judge
Stidger secretly addressed them note, in
stead of going in person, which might have
created an alarm-apprising them of what
had taken place, and requesting their attend
ance at a certain hour in the evening, at Dr.
Martins room in the Hospital, together with
all those who had been depostors in the
stolen trunk. The following gentlemen were
present at the hour appointed, viz: the two
Dodges, Major Hungerlord, Wm. Fonda, j. B.
Whitcomb, Charles Dannals, and a half doz-
en- others. A table was placed in the centre
of the room, around which the company
gathered. Stewards two purses were then
produced. The contents of the smaller one
were emptied upon the table and closely ex-
amined by those present. Although the
dust bore a striking resemblance to that
stolen, it could not be satisfactorily identi-
fed. The second purse, containing about
$500 was next oTerhauled. A gambler who
chanced to be present, on the instant recog-
missed specimen weighing about five dollars,
containing his private marks. Others were
equally fortunate. Nearly all the larger
pieces Of gold were recognised and claimed.
There was now no longer doubt as toStew-
art being the guilty party. The company
having arrived at this conclusion, arrange
ments were at once made for his arrest The
necessary papers to that end having been
issued, were placed in the hands of Barr, who
was instructed, affer securing Stewards per-
son, to search his premises for the balance
of the missing gold dust and coin, together
with retorted lump weighing 100, an-'
other of the same kind valued at S625, and
a bar worth 500. All these things were
accurately described in the warrant. Mr..
Burr discharged his duties faithfully. Next
morning Stewart was arrested and taken to
the Justices Office, where large crowd had
in the meantime collected, and stood guard
over him. In further pursuance Of his duty,
Mr.. Burr made a thorough search in and
about Jim's house. lie found the gold bar
'secreied between several sacks of -four, and
subsequently, during the forenoon of the day,
brought to Fight al the other missing arti-
cles, which were discovered concealed away
in different places excepting theretorted
lump of gold valued at 81 100.


The examination Of Stewart for the gold
dust robbery next ensued. lie defended his
own case, and ayerring his innocene Of the
crime charged dispensed with witnesses.


Between l l and l 2 o'clock at night, after a
protracted and tedious session Of the court,
the investigation closed. The Judge sum
med up the testimony and announced that
he should hold the defendant to answer to
higher court, ia the sum Of So 900, or in
default of that amount commit him TO prison.
AS it was impossible for jim to give the ne
cessary security, he was passed into Mr..
Burr's hands, with an injunction from the
Justice to ""take good care Of him. The
crowd gave three cheers and started off in
the direction of the DodgeS saloon.


A short time after, while Barr and
the prisoner were at supper in canvas
house directly in the rear of the bar-room
of the Dodge saloon, with sentry at the
door to guard its approach, crowd of sew
eral handred people collected on the outside
and circulated through the saloon. Soon a
cry was raised of ""Hang him :"" ""ha'tg him.'
The excitement became intense. A rope was
procured, lanterns were brought, (for it was
a dark night and some three or four men
ascended the big oak tree which stood i'm
mediately in front OF the hotel, to make the
necessary preparations for carrying the
lynching threat into execution. The cry
was again taken up, Bring him outl' 'haDg
him !"" ''dont let him escapesh etc. TIE at
tempt of some half dozen persons composing
the mob to enter and seize upon the prisoner,
was instantly repelled by those having charge
of him.


To give the reader more perfect knowl
edge of matters, it is necessary for me to
digress a little, and to say, that the hotel at
that time was owned by Judge Stidger. He
received the profits of the establishment,
though he did not give it his personal super
intendence. His office was about one hundred
and fifty yards from the hotel, down the
river: He seldom visited the hotel except at
sneal-times and after Office hours. With this
explanation the reader will mere readily un-
derstand what follows


Judge Stidger not yet having left his Office,
was ignorant of the scene going on at the
hotel Arriving on the ground while it was
being enacted, he found the mob assembled,
and inquired of a man on the outskirts to
know 'twhat was up?"" He replied that they
were about to chang Jim Stewart"" The
Judge worked his way into the bar-room,
where he found man named Tanner har-
anguing the mob and melting it to yielence.
He did not stop long to listen, but made his
way into the canvas building containing
Burr and the prisoner. After informing Burr
of the state of feeling outside, be ordered
Burr to take pencil and paper, go into the
street and quietly summon fifty as posse to
protect the prisoner, and bring them to the
door well armed. If any of those summoned
refused to act, he was instructed to keep a
list of the names and report them to the
court next morning. Out of the whole num-
ber summoned, but nine or ten persons"

ture members have wasted days and weeks,
at an enormous expense to the people, in
the discussion of abstract questions which
have but little, if any direct bearing on pub
dc interests; on questions which, let them
be settled as they may, by our Leg stature,
would exercise no influence on the future of
the State or the people. These questions
and subjects are wholly of a partisan charac-
ter, and possess no interest for others than
party leaders, or those who make politics
trade and oflice-huntng an occupation, yet
TO their consideration days and weeks have
been devoted by our Legislature as if mat
ters of really no public moment were worthy
of the greatest attention and should be treat
ed with the utmost care by the representa-
tiyes of the people Meantime q subject
arises for the consideration of our Legisa-
tors which involves the whole science OF
Government, and on the proper disposition
OF which may possibly depend the continued
existence of our present political system a
question involving really greater principles
and requiring more careful consideration
than do the questions which divide the Re-
publican, Douglas, Breckenridge and Union
parties. This question our Legislators dis
pose of without moments thought-wilh-
'out minutes consideration thus saying in
effect that in matters of great Importance
they are competent to act on the spur of the
moment, while in matters of trining or no
interest they must needs expend more care
and thought than was involved in discover
ing the process and uses of electricity Our
Legislators must consume a week in consid-
ering who shall be clerk of some Committee,
but only require ten minutes to overthrow,
virtually, our entire system of criminal jurs-
prudence. When class of men who can
act thus recklessly and inconsistently obtain
power, is it to be wondered at that Seces-
sionism rules triumphant, and that our
whole governmental structure is trembling
from base to dome? In passing an act
Horace Smith, the Legislature of this State
did more to upset our government, to de-
stroy public confidence in its efficacy, to
create distrust in the public mind, and
awaken contempt for regularly constituted
authority, than have all the Secession re-
bellions, lynching raids and Vigilance Com
mlttees our country ever witnessed; yet to
an act involving so many momentous conse
quences they did not degn to devote mo-
ment's consideration, though they have con-
sumed weeks in debating upon questions
which, under the most favorable circum-
stances, could not advance our State one
particle in the scale of greatness, or reduce
us one iota below our present Standing
Morning Call."

By application just made by some of the
diplomatic corps at the State Department at
Washington, the following points are ascer-
tanned: First. Vessels in the blockaded ports
when the blockade took effect, will be allowed
reasonable time to depart. Second. Vessels
bringing emigrants, though they had no no.
tice of the blockade at the time of their depart
ure, viii not be allowed to enter the blocka-
ded ports


That class of persons come to the U. 5.
chiefly for the Mississippi river, and it will
be better for them to enter an open port than
to encouter dangers and casualties incident
to the insurrection.

out of the Union. The Governor has organ
lied camp of instruction at Raleigh. He
SAYS the Northern Government is now con-
centrating a large force in the District of Co
lumbla, ostenslbly to protect the State OF Gov
ernment, but such force cannot be allowed
to remain within the limits of Maryland or on
the borders of Virginia, without cndanger
ing the liberties of the people Of those States
and if they be conqerued and overcome, we
will become the next prey TO the invaders.
The policy then, as well as feeling of broth
erhood, increased by a common interest, re-
quires us to exert our energies in defence of
Virginia and Maryland. Every battle fought
there will be battle fought in defence of
North Carolina. and therefore troops should
be speedily sent.

find in an exchange, the following particu-

Tennessee, at Lyncbburg. Va, brief ac-
count Of which was received some weeks
ago. The affair happened about the middle
of April:


While on his way home from Washington,
Senator Johnson passed through Lynchburg,
and hearing that he was in the cars, large
crowd gathered around. They completely
blocked up the way to and from the cars. Some
one proposed ''three groans"" for him, which
were responded to. William w. Hardwicke,
editor ofthe Lynchburg Republican, then walked
up to him, and insulted him with several cpl
thets of denunciation, catching at his nose. The
fury of the mob ran so high, that the car doors
were locked to prevent the Tennessee official
from being molested. The Superintendent of
the road made his way to where Gov. Johnson
was seated and informed him that the treat
ment extended to him was the legitimate fruits
of his conduct in sending over the telegraph
line to East Tennessee the infamous dispatches
that had been intercepted at Lynchburg by or
der of Governor Letcher, advising them to
""stand by the Union"" and that if he was guilty
of their authorship he could not pass over the
road. Governor johnson denied that he had
sent the dispatches to which they alluded, and
thus secured his passage through."

JOHN MckEoN, AdJt b9th Regiment. and 20 Others


To this is appended a curious letter from
Thomas I. Meagher, using good many words,
whereof The following are the most significant:


The psicuu cilcum.,auce you dec, nv attention to is
fairly opsn 10 or.cm and tho rcton OF James Lynch and
fssA Of his sar1s Jtend, But asribe the step
he then ,ooi to want Of courege, knowing him >, doh
&C., &c.


Such is Mr.. Lynchs defense. Now let us
see what are the charges it is designed to
reluts. They are Substantially as follows:


/. Mr. Lynch was private iu Capt. yari.
ans Battery attached to tho Eighth Regiment
Of three months volunteers; which regiment
was sworn into the service of the United
States on the 25th of April, and was thus
bound to serve till the 25th Of July. But tho
Battery had been sworn in on the goth, so
that lis time expired on the eOth Of July.


9. Gen. Mcdowell had expected to attack
the enemy on Friday, the 18th, but did not
get bis men promptly into position, SO the bat
Tie was postponed to Sunday, the 2lst On
Saturday, the Goth. Capt. Varians Battery
was, with its regiment, in the face OF the
enemy between Centreyille and Bull Run On
that day, Mr. James Lynch, as spokesman for
himself and sixteen others, went to Capt
Varian and demanded q discharge, as their
time had expired. Capt. yarian did his best
to persuade them to stay till the 25th, when
the term Of the regiment would expire, pledg.
ing himself that he would then lead his com.
pany home at all events; Gen. Mcdowell also
sent special request that the Battery should
remain but Lynch g. Co. were incxorable;
hey would have their discharge at once and
get out OF danger; and the progress of the dis
'ussicn gradually brought the residue of the
company over to their side, so that Capt. |
Varian found himself deserted by all but his
'fcers, and was obliged to lead his Battery
lomeward on the very eve OF battle.
The above has been repeatedly sot forth in
ur columns. Does Mr. Lynch's certificate
contradict one syllable Of it ""The under
signed officers"" talk largely Of 4"" false and
malicious statements and Misrepresentation"""

 THE VIRGINIA RESOLUTIONS OF lI9S. Having had occasion to allude to the Virgin

 resolutions of l799, may observe, that of thes famous resolves, the subjects of so much polit cal romance, it is time that little plain trut

 should be promulgated. The country in l79 was vehemently agitated by the struggles of tn

 domestic parties which about equally divided i

 and these struggles were urged to unwonted an

 extreme bitterness by the preparations mad

 and making for 8 war with France By an ac

 of Congress passed in the summer of that veal , the President of the United States was clothe, with power to send from the country any alie whom he might deem dangerous to the publi F peace and safety, or who should be concerned il any reasonable or secret machinations aeans the government of the United States. Thi

 act was passed as war measure it was to b

 in force two years and it expired by it's own linn itation on the 25th of June, 1900. War; it i true, had not been formally declared but hos

 tilities on the ocean had taken place on bot

 sides, and the army of the United States Ina,

 been placed upon war footing. The mcasur

 was certainly within the war power, and on

 which no prudent commander, even wthou

 the authority of a statute, would hesitate to ex ecute in an urgent case within his own district Congress thought fit to provide for and regulate

 it's exercise by law.

 Two or three weeks later (July IL, l790), an

 otEer law was enacted, making it penal to com

 blne or conspire with intent to oppose any law

 ful measure of the Government of the United States or to write print or publish any false or scandalous writing against the Government ei- ther House of Congress, or the President of the United States. In prosecutions under this law 1 1t was provided that the truth might be pleaded in justification. and that the jury should be judges both of the law and of the fact. This law was, by its own limitation, to expire at the close of the then current Presidential term. i Such are the famous Alien and Sedition laws, under the administration of that noble and true hearted revolutionary patriot John Adams, though not recommended by him officially or privately; adjudged to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States, distinctly approved by Washington, Patrick Henry and 1 Marshall and whatever else may be said of them, certainly preferable to the laws which. throughout the seeding states, Judge Lynch would not fail to enforce at the lamp post and tar bucket against any person guilty of the of fences against which these statutes are aimed It suited, however, the purposes of party at that time, to raise a formidable clamor against tHcse laWS.- IL was III Fdll luaI Ilelf cOLStllu- tlonality was affirmed by the Judiciary of the United States. ""Nothing,"" said Washington alluding to these laws, twill produce the least change in tie conduct of the lead CTS of the opposition to the measures of the General Government. They have points to car. ry from which no reasoning, no inconsistency of conduct, no absurtlty can divert them"" Such in the opinion of Washington, was the object i for which the legislatures of Virginia and Ken lucky passed their famous resolutions of l799, the former drafted by Mr. Madison, and the lat ter by Mr. Jefferson and sent to friend in Ken lucky to be moved. These resolutions were transmitted to the other states for their concur renee. The replies from the states which made any response were referred to the committees in Virginia and Kentucky. In the legislature of Virginia an elaborate report was made by Mr. Madison, explaining and defending the resolu- tions in Kentucky another resolve re-ailirmng those of the preceding year was drafted by hfr Wilson Cary Nicholas. Our respect for the distinguished men who took the lead on this oc- casion, then ardent!y engaged in the warfare of politics, must rot make us fear to tell the truth that the simple object of the entire movement was to make political capital for the ap- preaching election, by holding up to the excited imaginations of the masses the Alien and Sedi- tion laws as an infracton of the Constitution which threatened the overthrow of the liberties of the people. The resolutions maintained that the states being parties to the constitutional compact, ina case of deliberate, palpablc and dangerous exercise of powers not granted by the compact the states have a right and are in duty bound to intsrDose for preventing the progress of the evil.

 Such, in brief, was the main purfort of the Virgin a and Kentucky resolutions. The sort Of interpretation intended was left in studied ob- scurity. Not word was dropped of secession from the Union. Mr. Nicholas resolution in l739 hinted at nullifcation"" as the appropri- ate remedy for an unconditional law, but what was meant by the Astounding word was not ex- plained. The words nu void and of no effect contained in the original draft of the Virginia resolutions were stricken out from them on their passage through the Assembly; and Mir. Madis- on, ill his report of l799, carefully explains that no extra constitutional measure were intended One of the Kentucky resolutions ends with an invitation to the states to unite in petition to Congress to repeal the laws

 These resolutions were communicated. as I have said, to the other states for concurrence. From most of them no response was received |; some adopted dissenting reports and resolutions; not one concurred. But the resolutions did their work-all that were intended or expected to do-by shaking the administration at the ensuing election, Mr. Jefftrson. at whose in stance the entire movement was made, WAS cho- sen President by very small majority; Mir. Mad ison was placed at the head of his administra- ton as Secretary of State the obnoxious laws expired by their own limitation, not repealed by the dominant party, as Calhoun with strange n- advertance asserts Discourse on the Constitu- tioD, p. 359) and Alr. Jefferson proceeded to administer the government upon constitutional principles quite as lax to say the least, as those of his predecessors. If there was any mark ked de- parture in his general policy from the course hitherto pursued, it was that, having some theo- retical prejudice against navy, he allowed that branch of the service to languish By no ad- mipstration have the powers of the general GOV. ernnent been more literally construed-not to Say further strained-sometime benefcially as in the acquisition of Louis uisana-sometimes her. niciousy as in the embargo. The resolutions of l79S and the metaphysics they inculcated were surrendered to the cobwebs, which habitualv await the plausible congregations of the canvass after an election is decided. These resolutions of 1798 have been annually walked from their slumbers as closely contested elections as par ty cry; the report of the Hartford Convention without citing them by name, borrows their lan' guage; but as representing in their modern in. depreciation any system on which the govern. ment ever was or could be administered thov were buried in the same grave as the laws uh;cT called them forth ""nion

ern latitudes, l would telegram you


You say l am reported to have spoken
strongly against the war policy of the Gov
ernment of the United States, as fraught with
much present suffering, and not calculated to
obtain any real advantage Be assured that
previous to the outbreak of military violence,
| was most ardently desirous of preserving
the peace and union but since violence, bat
tie and bloodshed have occurred, dare not
hope for peace, unless you can show me a
foundation of rock or solid ground (but no
quick sand basis) on which peace can be re-
established.


shall beg leave to make my own state
ment from point of view which is found in
the general sentiment of the people north of
Mason and Dixon's line.


They say that whatever may have been the
anterior origin of the war, its immediate
cause was the overt act of turning guns put
in place by the State of South Carolina,
against public military defense of the coun.
try at large, which of right belonged to all of
the States in the Union. The Constitution
having been adopted by the common consent
of all the sovereign parties engaged in the
and approval thereof, maintain
that no State has right to secede, except in
the manner provided for in the document
itself.


Indeed, l am not aware of any statute
passed by the national authority which could
give the South additional reasons for discon-
tent or.complaint within. the last ten or fifteen
years.


/ have thus alluded to the unofficial causes
for Southern resentment. Even In your own
letter the cause alleged is the election of the
Chief Magistrate. This does not seem at all
sufficient to warrant the course which the
South has adopted.


Yoa say that PRESIDENT Lingcs9R vas elect
ID by Black Psp6blicans in the North.
Am inclined to think that he was indirectly
,r negatively elected by Democrats North
md South. The Black Republicans present
d one candidate, and in order to defeat his
election, The Democrats, Nbrth and South,
presented three. If the latter had presented
,nly one candidate, it is probable that the
Rlack Republicans, as you call them, would
nave been found as minus hab entes. But
when the Democrats distributed their votes,
apparently with the view of rendering them
Inefficient, then, of course, the one man
,hoice was elected over che three candidates
Ind competitors that had been placed in RI
ralship with each othe., and in the aggre.
gate all against him alone. That he was
,osstitutionly elected under the circumstan-
,es, = not denied either in the South or in
he Nor,s. Then, if so elected, he is the
Chief Magistrate Of all the United States of
America, and, "" his very oath of Office, is
bound by their os-u common consent to see
that neither Maine, IN the northeast, nor
Texas, on the southwest, shall be permitted



agreed upon in the Constitution of this Gov
ernment If States shall be allowed, in the
face of that National Constitution, to kick
over the traces of common union, rs agreed
upon in the primitive days Of our Govern
ment, then it is difficult to see why counties,
and townships, and villages may not be at
liberty to do the same thing just as often as
the freak of fancy to do so may or shall have
come upon them.


There appears to be an idea in the South
that the National Government and the peo
pie af the North are determined to conquer
and subiugate them. This, l think, is
great mistake. First, in the sterner sense of
the word conquer it seems to me utterly
and, if possible, l think it would
be undesirable and injurious both to the
North and to the South. Unless / have been
deceived by statements considered reliable,
would say that the mind of the North looks
only to the purpose of bringing back the Sc
ceded States to their organic constitution
ante bellum.


That word peace is becoming more or
less familiar here in the North. In a crisis
like this it is not, in my opinion, expressive
of sound principle or a safe policy. Its
meaning changes the basis and the issue of
this melancholy war. If changed, it will be
a war, not between the South and the North,
considered, but war between
the two great political parties that divide the
country. Instead of partisan hostility,
wise patriots should rival each other in re.
storing or preserving the Union as one nation,
its prosperity, and the protection and happi-
ness of its entire people, in all their legiti-
mate rights.


1t only remains to be seen whether the
Government is what it calls itself-the Gcv-
ernment of the United States of America, or
merely the Government of a fraction thereof"

I came over from Richmond yesterday after
noon. Last night three companies Of the first
Regiment of North Caro- ina. two from Fayette-
willie and one from ncoln passed through here
for Richmond. They emerged from the cars
in front of Jarratt's Hotel and formed, where
they were greeted by hundreds of the fair la
dies of this Cockade City. They marched to
the Richmond depot and proceeded TO the en-
campment at Richmond. These were the best
equipped soldiers that 1 have yet seen enter
the service, and our State may be justly proud
of them. They will give a good account OF
themselves when the conflict does come. Seven
hundred more, the balance OF the 1st n. c.
Regiment are to be here on Tuesday. Our au-
thorities should bring them on for they will be
soon needed in Virginia


Several thousand troops have been ordered
from Lynchburg to Norfolk and they arc ex-
pected down tomorrow. The Federal Gov
ernment having ordered six Regiments to Fort
ress Monroe an attack Norfolk is expected
soon-certain!y this week. Many are Of the
opinion that Noafolk and Harper's Ferry will
be attacked about the same time, both most
probably this week The force now under
arms in Virginia is large and when they do
open the bali deadly conflict may be looked
for. All who have seen will go in to kill or
be killed.


News has been received hero by telegraph
to-day that Government vessel, supposed to
be the Harriet Lane, attempted to enter the
harbor at Norfolk last night but was turned
back by shots from the battery at Craney Is
iund. They have heavy feet there, and will
have. with the SIX Regiments just arrived there,
about l., 900 men at that point. Of course
this force would never be brought there but
for the fixed purpose of an attack, and there
can be no doubt but the Federal Government
has determined upon an active. aggressive
movement on Virginia, and that hostil,ties
will commence in few days. Here l would
again urge upon our State authorities to bring
on troops to the assistance OF Virginia.


Petersburg has doEe nobly. She now has
in the field 1900 men. and recruiting still going

Oh what place is the great Metropolis of

of about fifteen feet-with an atmosphere of
density sufficient to crush to atoms the subjects

igin of the names ofseveral of our counties So
noma' is an Indian name, and signifies Valley

'Calaveras. signifies Skulls and the county
took its name from a creek within its borders on
which a large number of skulls were found.


'Tuolumne' is corruption of the Indian word
'tamalamne,' which signifies cluster of stones
or wigwams. 'Mariposa' is the Spanish for but
terfy.


party of California camped on the stream
bearing the name of 'Mariposa' in 1907, sawmy-
raids of butterflies and from that circumstance
named the county LAS Mariposas. San Joa-
quin is said to have very ancient origin in ref
erence to the parentagc of Mary, the mother of
Christ. According to the Divine revelation,
Joachim signifies preparation Of the Lord and
hence the belief that joaquin, who, in the course
of tine was admitted into the pale of sanctity,
was the father of Mary.


Lieut.. Gabriel Morga gave the appellaton of
San Joaquin to a rivulet which springs from the
Sierra Nevada, and empties into Lake Buena
Vista. The river San oaquin derives its name
from the rivulet, and baptizes the county with
the name.

following interesting particulars concerning
the destruction of the Standard newspaper
office, at Concord, N. H. The immediate
cause of the resort to harsh measures was the
insulting tone of the Standard towards re-
turned soldiers. Says the letter;


Early in the afternoon several soldiers Of
the First Regiment went to the printing office
and asked for some of the papers, with the
intention of purchasing them The publish
ers refused to sell them. The soldiers after
ward went into the street, and by some
means obtained several copies; these were
read to an excited and increasing multitude.


The excitement continued TO increase until
a frantic collection had surrounded the build
ing. and were filling the air with loud shouts
and imprecations At this time, several per-
sons went up to the printing rooms, which
were in the third story of Lows block, and
found the doors locked. Immediately after,
revolver was fired, and the ball passed
through the floor into the second story, into
room occupied 10y Tailor Stewards sewing
machine women, causing, of course, great
CONSERVATION. From the direction of the
ball, 1t is evident that the weapon was fired
for the purpose of intimidating the crowd.


Soon after. the publishers four in number,
appeared at the windows armed with re-
volvers guns and axes. One of them very
impudently reached forth Colts revolver.
shook it. aud told the crowd they were well
prepared, and should defend themselves to
the last extremity. Those who composed the
mob answered with CALCULATIONS like the fol-
lowing: Are you n traitor 2"" Yon rebel
and Seeessionist-f fire. if you dnre!"" At
this time the City Marshal appeared and
read the riot act, and with great difficulty
prevented the soldiers from ascending the
stairway. John NJ. Hill, Esq and several
prominent citizens endeavored to calm the
excited populace, but with no effect they
then went up to the Office and told the pub
fishers that if they would give up heir arms,
they would endeavor TO protect their persons
and property. They agreed to this, but be-
fore anything could he done, the soldiers
were at the head Of the stairs, and all par
leying was at an end. The rioters att empted
to enter but the door was bolttd, and they
commenced staving out the panels Firearms
were then freely used inside and several of
the crowd were wouuded-one in he arm.
another in the hand, while bullets passed
through the clothes Of ""a number The firing
was distinctly heard in the street. and thou
sands filled the way to long distance above
and below the building


The soldiers were unatle to procure their
muskets, aud they had no weapons excepting
dirks. The publishers escaped into the attic
by ladder, and the riotors took possession
The work of demolition was now commenced
in good earnest; types, desks, paper of all
kinds, and, in (. ct everything which is used
about q printing Office. came tunbling down
on the sidewalk in fearful manner. Bonires
were Immediately kiudled, and the relies of
the Secession press We're thrown upon the
burning pile, while the soldiers gathered
around the smouldring ruins, and gave vent
to their JOY in the widest accamations -
After the fires had somewhat abated and
nearly everything had been consumed. the
City Marehnl went into the office and pre-
vailed upon the rioters to go down into the
street.


The soldiers discovered the hiding place of
the publishers. and seized their unfortunate
victims but the citizens rescued them, and
with great difficulty carried them to the Po-
lice Station Their preservation from death
was very remarkable circumstance and had
it not been for few brave men, their lives
wauld have paid the penalty of their deeds.
The victims were hurried the Police Station
on the full run the crowd folio wing after,
shouting. ""Lynch them Lynch them -
They were taken to the State Prison for safe-
keeping


Letters were found in the Office from
Union men in Virginia, asking them ""wby
they published such articles?' and saying
"" even in this country such paper could not
i've etc


Papers ia abundance were found 6xing un-
misiakab.y the edit0rship of the obnoxious
paper on Edmund Burke, of Newport, n. II.
1t has always been surmsed that such was
the fact, but now it is conclusively shown by
abundant proof.


A coat of tar and feathers was prepared
for the Paimers publishers, but the police
and the warden of the pricon saved them
from it, The streets were Illuminated in the
evening by the burning tar in front of the of
fice but the crowd, however, WAS very civil
and orderly.


The ringleader Of the crowd was Charles
p. Clark boy IA years of age who has been
with Capt SturtevaDt, of Concord, as q clerk


The soldiers. after the shots were fred,
went TO work coolly and took down the
blinds of the windows, and sign boards, at
tempting in some instances to procure their
arms but were restrained from this by their
officers.


Inc Ealu!SIe say lhey were encouraged
and urged on in their treasonabe course bv
prominent citizens of Concord and Mrnches-
ter and that they had received the pre- mise
of one thousand men from MAJ chester in ease

Strategy. from the Greek st,ateqos. a 9,",,"Applied Strategy in the United States.


Strategy, from the Greek stTategos, gen
eral, meant, in a very open signification
among the Greeks-generatship but to the
multitude of unmilitary readers, this would
be making the definition as obscure as the
thing defined. What is generalship? is the
pertinent answer. Strategy has been vague
ly deiincd-the art of directing masses of
troops on decisive points, and it implied more
clearly, perhaps-the hostile movements of
an army beyond the reach of the enemy's ar.
tillery Its field is the whole theatre of war;
its objective points and lines are mountains,
rivers. and fortified towns. Success in STRAIT
egv constitutes a great general, and, thus
explained, it appears that the Greeks were
right, that strategy is generalship, of that
kind which nav be sttdied in all its combi-
nations in library, and issued by bulletins
for inferior workmen to execute as task work.
But the general must be something more
than strategist. European strategy has
become, especially since the time-of the first
Napoleon, Il comparatively simple study,.by
reason of the war uses of almost every great
strategic point on the continent.


Tho mere mention of the Danube, with its
tributary streams. the Rhine, the Bidassoa,
the Alma, the Valley of the Po, the fields of
Saxony, and the Aceldama of Flanders-ex
amples taken at random will explain our
meaning. Let us premise few definitions.
The base of operations is a strong point or
line Of frontier, as river, coast, range OF
mountains or fortress, which gives at once a
point of departure and a safe place of return
in case of retreat This must be well chosen
with no possibility of being assailed in the
rear, and exceedingly strong in front. TO
define and use proper base is the very first
strategic problem to be solved.


Lines ofopcrdfions are the routes natural
territorial or artificial, by and upon which
the army corps move from the base to attack
the enemy or invade his country. Correct
strategy has been compared to a closed ist,
representing the collection of troops and ma
terial: open the hand, and the extending fin
gers indicate the lines of operation. These
should be always connected with the base;
and the communication, except in special,
exceptional cases, should be kept up with the
base; in this latter view the lines are called
also lines Of Communication. Political causes
often determine both the base and lines OF
operations; and divers nationalities in Eu-
rope affect the military movements constant
ly. -.~.





base or on the lines of operation. These are
formed naturally by mountain passes, bridg-
es. or fords of rivers, etc. and artlfcially by
cities. towns and forts. Thus the strategy OF
Napoleon at Marengo was dependant upon
the difficult pass of the Great St. Bernard,
and that OF Arcola and Lodi upon the storm
ing of inadequately guarded bridges.


The capital Of country is strategic
point. of the most decisive and important
kind it contains the national insignia and
archives. and is the great national represent
ative. History is full of illustrations Of the
military value of capitals. This explains the
eagerness of Napoleon to dictate terms In his
numerous wars at conquered capitals. In
his FIRST and second campaign in Italy, Ge-
noa. Turin. Milan and Venice fell into his
hands. and the treaties of Camp Fornlo and
Luneyille were the consequence. In lo0o
and 1900 he entered Vienna in triumph; the
treaty of Presburg followed the former, and
the peace of Vienna the latter entrance; IN
1906 he was in military power at Berin. In
all his wars lie had no less an aim than the
centre of hostile power.


The Allies retorted his strategy, and twice
ended the war at Paris-in 1914 and 1913.
Exile for him followed both occupations; the
last was final ruin.


1t was not until the capital of Mexico was
taken that our war with that Inntry was
brought TO an end, in 1913.


Let US apply these few principles to Amer
ica and particularly to the present war
Battle tactics will come in due time; but
strategy is our present subject. We are stu
diving our strategy almost for the first time.
That of the revolution was confined to the
Atlantic coast. and that Of 1912 only added
Canada and the Northwest, with the Cult OF
Mexico. And. be it observed, nations never
study strategy in time Of peace: 1t would be
better if they did.


The great bases Of operations are the slave
territories of the South on the one hand, ana
tho lono frontier formed by the Missouri, the
Mississippi. the Ohio, the Pennsylvania line
o,,d tbn Potomac. St. Louis, Cairo and
washington are the prominent strategic
,,o;nfs on our line and the Mississippi, with
is vast valley, its delta in the gulf, New or
leans and Cottondom near Its mouth, Is
most important strategic river


But to come down to narrower limits In
Eastern virgnia, the base OF the Federal r, ar
nv is the Potomac. prolonged by chesapeake
B3v- down TO Fortress Monroe. If the reb- |
als have really succeeded in closing the-Po- |
so,aae. as they assert, we have been there
dafc;ent in strategy, but time may show that |
tbev have not effeetually done thus.


The base Of the rebel army is the James |
river. Richmond Is strategic point h Prih-
einallv because it is the capital but Lynch
bnrr. In re-cntering of the river course, is
tbe sf-onr depot base-threatened in its rear /

falling into the hands Of the Seeessionists =
A short time before the expiration Of the
late Administration Major Dalefeld resigned
his post as commandani at West Point, and
through the influence Of SHdell, Gen Beaure-
gard was appointed in his stead Fortunately,
however. before the latter had assumed his
position, the Administration learned that there
was plot in existence, the iuldllment of which
would have been to place West Point in the
hands of Secessionisis. and at the same time
through the completely of traitors in New ork
a movement was to be made for separating the

was telegraphed Immediately not TO resign; he
replied that he had sent bis resignation Just
three hours before. He was then directed TO
resume his command, which he Immediately

 We'll informed gentleman recently from New York gives it his decided opinion from facts communicated, well understood in inter- ested circles there, that Yankee proprietors Of large interests in Brunswick, Georgia, have induced Lincoln to fit out expensive expedi- tion, with about twenty thousand men to take Brunswick, establish navy yard and open port for shipment of cotton, naval stores and live |oak Sagacious men here, think they have much reason to believe this, as Federal Gov ernment is almost wholly controlled by schem- CTS and spectators.

Johnston had just received by special express from Padu- cah late copy of the St. Louis Republican, giving full account of battle at Lexington on the 18th. fine Republican says: !"" Gen.

From the New York Ledger
.a Everett on Secession Newspa-
pers in the North.",,":. IA an old provero that the laws are 81


Nu,idst arms. The laws are, for the most
Ien. made for a state of peace, excepting
PA.% which refer to war, and the manner OF
tnOSS tnOSucting it. When state of war arises,
cUnr epa rcommunity necessarily undergoes great,
'n WI sometimes rapid change; the quiet pur-
1;,s Of society are, to some extent, checked,
su,i nJ in the immediate vicinity Of the seat OF
naT ""ar suspended, and with them the laws,
Which regulate those pursuits, must for the
,;me give way to the stern necessities of the
asw "" state of things. 1t should however be,
no S Il ;s the great effort of an enlightened
Government in civilized countries to keep
,h;s disturbance of the peaceful order OF
things within the narrow est limits; aud allow
.,a snpremacy of the law to be interfered
with BY military authority as little as posi-,
h,s It is in particular cardinal maxim OF
frse governments, that the military COM
monder should be subordinate to the civil
magistrate. There are undoubtedly cases,
when war exists, in which the public safety
absolutely requires that the operation of The
laws and the authority of the civil magistrate
hVuld yield to the paramount considerations
dhich require summary measures. The
ratriotic magistrate, of whatever rank, must
IN such cases exert that moral courage-quite
equal to the courage required for the risks of
the field-whch is needed for the discharge
Of the unpopular duty of suspendng the laws.
He must not shrink before the reproaches
which his conduct is sure to bring upon him
from the tmid, the perverse, and the diaffec
ted. Choking their disloyalty under assumed
zeal for constitutional principles. He must
take the risk even of subsequent disavowal j.;
for moor humanity is very prone to be wise
ar,or the event and brave after the danger.
nnt hs will con6ne his interference with the
,ecular march of law to the narrowest limits
and fewest occasions, and be the first to well
come the restoration of it's authority.


These are the general maxms which apply
TO the conflict of civil and military authority,
and the practical difficulty will naturally be.
not in their general soundness, but in their
application to particular cases This difficult
ty will, Of course, be much greater IN the
commencement of a state of war, than after 1t
hos lasted some time, and the community has
been obliged to conform itself to the exigen-
cies of the contest At the present time,
those citizens in some OF the Border States
who sympathize with the Confederates, think
IL hard that they cannot be at peace and at
war In the Union and out Of it, at the same
time. They claim the protection of the Con-
ettuton as in time of profound peace and





render secret and, when circumstances admit,
open aid to those arrayed in arms against
Them They assault the forces moving to the
defense of the Capital, they convey supplies
and arms to the enemy their recruit his
ranks openly and by stealth, and to effect
these objects they sometimes avail themselves
of official position and authority derived from
the Government which they assail and
when that Government in selfdefense, inter-
feres TO arrest these reasonable movements
aud Vaccinations, they clamor that the liber
ties Of the citizen are invaded.


There are presses for the most part in the
Border States, though some of them nre
found in cities more remote from the scene OF
action. which are daily pleading the cause of
the enemy, misrepresenting and riiIying the
Government of the United States, eXagger-
ating every article of untavorable intelll-
gence, aud exerting themselves TO the utmost
to disheartep the friends ard defenders Of the
Constitution and the Union. But such is the
all but superstitious devotion of the people to
the liberty of the press, that these perncous
journals have, with the exception of a single
instance in st. Louis, never been interfcred
%iih. 1t seems to have been thought better
by those in authority to tolerate the mischief
OF these uHpatriotie presses, than to elevate
them to greater Importance by prosecution or
80 encroach in the slightest degree upon THAI
freedom Of public discussion which In ordl-
nary times is justly regarded as one OF the
greatest safeguards Of liberty. But 3"" as pre-
poIeronS TO sdcrifce the end to the means. W
should in this respect learn wisdom from the
enemies Of the Union While we regard as
unbeconing our Christian civilization that re-
sort TO Lynch law, by which every express
al of pt,ippu ada tp the rppnlnr
ment is suppressed in the seeding States we
ought to remember that in tolerating l.
traitorous press among ourselves we practice
a liberality which awakens no gratitude at
home, and is never reel procated by the oppos
ing. party. 1t is, in fact an absurdity in
terms, under the venerable name of the liber-
t. of the press, to permit the systematic and
lcentious abuse of n Government which is
:asked to the utmost IN defending the country
from general disintegratiOn and political
chaos The Governor Of Malta was once
eensured in Parliament for some alleged Sc
verify toward the editor of journal in that
island, and the liberty of the press was de-
clared to be in danger The Duke of Well
lngcn said he was as friendly as any body to
the liberty Of the press in London, but a free
press in the Island Of Malta was as much out
OF place as it would be on the quarter deck of
q man of-war. We suppose the most enthu-
slastic champion of the liberty of the press
would hardly think it right to publish a our
ral within the walls of Fort McH Henry. in
which the officers of that garrison should be
daily advised to desert and the men be con-
stantly exhorted to mutiny; and whose col
umns should be filled with persistent abuse of
the Government and all engaged in its de-
fense. Why should journals of that descrip-
tlon be allowed to diffuse their poison be-
meath its walls amidst the eXcitable popula-
ton of large city?


So too with reference to the freedom of
speech in debate, one of the vital conditions
'ot republican liberty. The late session in
congress has witnessed magnanimity on the
part of the majority in both Houses of truly
romantic cast. The acts and the motives Of
ahe Government. in the suppression of the
isnlsurrection admitted by one of its most
distinguished chiefs to proceed mainly from
me disappointment of leading aspirants to
ohlce,) have been assailed from day to day
with viruence and a persistence, which
would be harmless in time of peace, but
which III time Of war cen have no other eff
leet upon the popular mind than to perplex
ana dishearten those who are stalking life and
iortune IN the cause Of the country. This
generosity excites no gratitude on the part of
t H'ose towards whom it is practiced; and so
-"" rom being recprocated, the member of
p: t,:e confederate Congress at Montgomery or
N'chmond who should assal the conduct or
pohcy of that body, as the Government of
the United States has been assailed by the
sympathizers with Secession at Washington,
would not reach his hotel in safety. He
would awipr f,or, tha pavt lnmp most"

 LYNcHBURG Sept 24.-Positive information has been recciy ed that Gen. Lee has left Valley Noun tain and is on his way to join Gen. Floyd who is now encamped at Meadow Bluff, l6 miles beyond Lewisburg, and who is seriously threatened by large force under RosencrantA. Wise is on Big Seweil Mountain. Messengers who left White Sulphur Springs Thursday says it is believed Wise was fighting and Floyd in expectation of an immediate attack.

 Accounts have been received of the arrest by Lincoln of Senators Pearce and Kennedy of Maryland. Tie Louisville Journal of the 20th, contains telegraphic dispatches from St. Louis porting hard fought battle at Lexington, Mo. between the Mssourians under Sen. Price, and the Lincoln forces under Gen. Mulligan, on the l7th. The last dispatch reports that Gen. Price oc :upied Lexington. Achievements from Gen. Jim Lane were expected by the federals during the battle, but they did not arrive. The Richmond Examiner says, Major Gen. Gustavus w. Smith is to take command of the division of the Potomac army, heretofore under Gen. Jos. F. Johnston-- Gen. Johnston will assume general command of both columns.

 MEMPHIS Sept. 27.-Passengers from Columbus this morning bring intelligence from Missouri of an encouraging character. We learn from J. w Polk, who left there at l2 o'clock last night, bearer of dispatches to the commander at this point that Gen. Johnston had just received by spe cial express from Paducah late copy of the St. Louis Republican, giving full account of battle at Lexington, Mo, on the 18th inst. The Repub- lican says: Gen. Price with 27 900 men attacked Lexington on the 18th, where Col. Muligan posted with between four and five thousand men alter three days n.hting, or rather seize of that time, the federal army surrendered with all their arms, ammunition and artillery, including also S25000O in specie, which Mulligan had stolen from the bank there giving the receipt of the tede ral government for the same Price is alleged to have used hemp bales as moving battery, and thus succeeded in cutting the enemy off from retreat bv the river. The loss (which of course cannot be aocuratel i. stated 60 killed on the part of the federal and % wounded Prices loss is put down at several hundred.

 It is further ascertained that the privates of the captured army had all been released on parole, but the officers retained prisoners, doubtless to re- taliate on in case Fremont attempts to carry out his threats. Dispatches from Quincy, Illinois, re- ceved at Paducah state that 0O0 of these prison CTS hai arrived there. The Republican estimates t e amount of art ry captured at 20 pieces. The number of small arms cannot be less than the num- Der of the enemy's force engaged, perhaps more.

Terrence Belew McManus (who died and

land, is deeply interesting to the Irish peo-
pie. The Irish journals all express a great
desire for the accomplishment of the purpose
named, and meetings have been held in va""
rious portions of Ireland upon the subject
We find the following in Moneys Express:
THE NATIoNALIsTs OF CORK TO THEIR CoMPATRI-


OTIS IN IRELAND, ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND:


Brothers-The laudable intention of the
Irish inhabitants of San Francisco to convey
the remains of our faithful departed patriot
Terence Bellew McMarus, to the city of New
York has just been announced through the
columns of the Irish American press; it is
further declared that our people Of the latter
city will undertake the melancholy yet noble
duty Of bringing to the shores of his native
land the dust OF cur deceased countryman
We have read those announcements with
emotion, and a sad yet pleasurable pride and
conceive it is but fitting that we who are de-
voted to the principles for which he suffered.
and who honor his memory, should act our
part in receiving, with due respect and be-
fitting reverence, this sacred charge, which
comes to us from the far distant shores of the
Pacific to rest in the Igreen bosom of our
motherland, and thereby bear a renewed tes-
timony to the holy faith of Irish Nationali
ty, and at the same time acqut ourselves of
some portion at least of the debt of gratitude
due to him who, in his unselfsh love for
Ireland, and in his disinterRsted zeal for her
regeneration, sacrificed his happy position
and bright prospects to become an outlawed
fugitive and (by virtue of London Law') an
exiled felon. We then, with confidence, APP
peal to you, brother Nationalist, to aid in
worthily carrying out the fond wish of Ter
ence Belew McManus-""ih his bones
might rest in Irish soil"" Let your response
be prompt and generous, as was his action in
behalf of our suffering country in Al and 4S.
Write Immediately to us or to the National
Press, and when you have given your sane
tion and approval, let committee be ap-
pointed to communicate at once with that es-
tablished in New York, to undertake the re-
ception of his remains, the bearing of them
in solemn funeral procession TO their final
resting place, and the defraying of all neces-
sary charges We will cooperate in every
and any way that can assist in this honorable
duty which we owe to ireland, MeMapus and

Editors Herald:-""Shall we coniscatc proper
ty in California;"" is mooted question by editors
and their correspondents, and evidently many OF
them are in lavor of entering Immediately upon
the policy of coniscating all property owned by
citizens who are suspected OF sympathlzlng IN
the least with the Confederate Government! To
favor such policy is no more ncr less than APP
proving the initiation of civil war into CaliOr
MIA. After becoming familiar with the horrible
state of society existing in Missouri, where the
civil strife appears to tbe about equal who can
be so hardened and thoughtess of con sequences
as to adopt the surest policy to inaugurate here
the same dreful and bloody state of affairs? No
one unless he be wholesale rObber at heart. aud
wishes to commit this misdemeanor under the
cloak of the Government. There is u difference
between coniscatng property belonging to citi-
zens suspected, and those who commit overt acts
against the Government. That is a bright idea
that many entertain that every man who says
""Jeff Davis is gentleman should swing. be
robbed OF his property Many good Union men
sympathse with the mass of the Southern people,
who were in no way instrumental in bringing on
civil war. 1t is u sympathy arising from an opin-
ion Very few think the South blameless, or but
that she has'committed great Political error, to
use no harshrr term: but the same many also
think the olcy being pursued by the Govern
ment, by retaliatOry war. not the best or the most
advisable. Sympathzers may be right or wrong





should we, having the power, punish such errors
Of the mind by so severe a policy? Unless l be-
lieve as you do, Messrs. Editors shall my proper
ty be conlscated? Would it not be better for
Callornians to mind their own business ard be
careful to exercise no power which shall iwitate,
or tend t. create civil war among ourselves?
Prudence, if not common honesty, would dictate
a different policy than advanced by some OF the
mad caps who are anxious to possess other
peoples goods, wares and merchandise.

Quite a number of prominent citizens here
have deceased within few days past. Among
the number were J. G.. Cleal. ex-County Surveyor.
Robert Lynch. of the Monongahell Hotel. and
William Metzler. This is the of the year
when if a body has any constitutional ailments,
they are sure to show themselves.


STATE TREASURY AGAIN.


Perhaps was misunderstood in my last about
the funds in the State Treasury. There are
about 5000 900 in the vault but this amount when
apportioned to the various funds, will not leave
very great sum in the general fund, from which
Legislators draw their pay. Besides. large
amount is due from the General to the Swamp
and Ovcrfowcl Land Fund which was borroY Yed
last winter. But in The in Incoming Legislators
get as short as the old members did last winter
then they can borrow again and make the session
as long Us heretofore.


SCHOOL ELECTION.


Everybody is excited about the approaching
School election which takes place on the first
Monday in December Our dailies have of ate
contained many very sharp rapS at the various in
competent candidates for city Superintendent.
The most severe Of these are aimed at Mr.. Craw-
ford who is said to be the candidate of the bhoys
Of the Fire Department. The contest is between
him, Dr.. Frey and Dr. Taylor. As Taylor and
Frey divide certain kind OF vote the chances
are that Crawford will be elected in spite Of all
the loud lamentations II Frey OF Taylor,
would decline. then the b'hoys' candidate would
certainly be deieated-as he most certainly ought
to be. lie is not qualified in any sense either in

wAsHoE MlNE| AND SACRAMENTO.


But for the trade Of WashOc, which to great
extent is thrown directly into the lap Of Slcra-
mento business would have been very dull here
the present Fall. The immense amount of ma
chnery and goods sent forward from here has
quickened every avenue Of trade. Not only our
merchants have prospered but mach niss have
been doing thriving business. The Sacramento
Iron works, (Goss and Lambard's) have been
over-taXed with orders that to fill them the pro.
pretors were compelled to enlarge their work
shops and them oitel send orders to San Fran
CISCO Sacramento is full of wagon and black
smith shops-and these have also been steadily
engaged during the Fall. The trade to Washoe
has also tended in great mea ure to keep up the
price of real estate, as well as that OF mechani
cal labor. But for the treasure shipped to this
city in return for our provisions and manufac-
lures we run no risk in saying that property
would have deprecated the present year over 25
per cent. And this trade is to steadily increase
from year to year, and add as much to building
up and enriching the Capital rs the legitimate
trade of the State. AS the population of Neva-
da Territory increases. so in regular ratio must
we grow in prosperity. That country is not a
hundrcdth part developed, and when her popula
ton shall have reached its hundreds of thous-
ands. we can hardly estimate the profits Of the
people of this State in supplying sucha commit
nifty of consumers

FREDrncx (Md), May oth.-The two com
panes of volunteers from Baltimore for the
secession array about G5 men, passed through
here about ten o'clock this morning. They
marched through, protected by General
Shriver and the Sheriff The appearance of
the men caused deep excitement There was
no outbreak, and their worn and shattered
appearance excited ridicule rather than in
dignation.


Sv. LoUls, May 9th.-It is reported that
the Collector of this port, Donovan, has re-
ceived orders from the Secretary of the Treas
ury directing him to examine the manfests of
all steamboats, destined South and compare
them with their cargOes, and if any arms,
munitions, provisions, or other supplies are
found aboard the vessel and cargo are to be
contiscated and the owners arrested for trea-

that on Tuesday morning the Virginians

he wanted him to leave. The Government

ST. LOUIS, May lOth.-Letters from Virgi-
MIA Unionists say that one of the reasons for
concentrating troops from the Confedesate
States in Virginia, was to increase the seces-
sion votes at the coming election.


The officially announced determination of
the Virginia Government to contest the oc-
cupation of the right fork of the Potomac,
opposite Washington, is expected by the mil
itary authorities here to result in a battle be-
tween the Federal forces, and the rebels in
close proximity to the Capital. Gen. Scott
is not quite prepared to advance troops to
the other side of the river, but strong force
will, nevertheless, cross the river, and assume
and fortify position near Alexandria, as
soon as the necessary preparations arc COM
peted.


There is considerable excitement in st.

Ten Bays in Foreign Parts.",,"We have spent ten days within the South ern Confederacy. Our readers might like to know something of what we saw and heard in foreign parts.

 "" feel better;' says passenger on the Nashville and Chattanooga railroad, as about midnight we dip into the southern portion of Alabama "" feel decidedly better What has come over me? Ah.-wc are out of the United States""

 ""Thought something was the matter"" responded a voice from the other end of the car. ''l've been feeling cramped and loose by turns these fifteen minutes. A night mare has been on me-horridl Now it's explained""

 But the train moved on, as though noth- ing had happened. Passports were not de- manded at Stevenson, nor at Chattanooga, neither were there any custom house off cials.

 The month of March has been unusually cold in Alabama and Georgia. Yet blow ing and planting are going on. The farm CTS are well up to their work. The main field force have not been withdrawn from their work, notwithstanding the musterings and mass meetings. All things go on with them as before They look contented and we'll cared for. The polished blow share makes its furrow, as of old, in the mellow earth. The trees are budding.- Corn is coming up. Cotton seed going in. Wheat and rye are beautiful. The flowers bloom. The singing of birds has come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in the land.

 About twenty per cent. more than com mon of corn and smaller grain is being sown this year within the limits of the Southern Confederacy. This agrees with our observation, and the most reliable rep resentations made to us. Those people mean to be independent. A few months will show that they can raise bread as well as cotton The cotton crop is now found 1 out to be about million of bales short oI the previous year. This fact has raised the price to higher figure than has been reached for many years. A few are holding back for higher prices still. But all this does not divert from the bread-producing pur- pose.

 Some things impressed us along our zig gag way and during our short stay in for eign parts. Of course the area of observa tions was not extensive. The reader vii know how to make allowances for that To our own, we added the observations O every iudcious friend and traveller we me up with, and with whom we could snatch ten-minutes' talk or take an hours set-to These impressions we give as facts, maybe new, without comment. "" hereyer th' editor is, he bears the Advocate in mind and gleans for its columns.

 l. The quietness of men and things sur prises one. From the seriousness and vast ness of the revolution that has taken place there within the last three months, ant from the accounts of mobs, lynch-law, reigl of terror, etc., one can hardly help looking out for evidences of disturbance in the pub lie mind, and commotion in affairs. w never saw people calmer. In town, village country and crossroads they are sober Il conversation and quiet in demeanor. Evi dently it is not the calmness of suppression but of conviction and determination. Les Il buster and big talk than one sees and hear at county election. No whilstling to keel the courage up. No nursing of wrath t keep it warm. They are in uncommon bland hnmor. Even the phillippics, taunts and insulting paragraphs of the abolition press do not rufle their tempers as the used to do They regard them as ontsid things, pretty much as we m the uni'e"

appointed mail agent on the Alexandria and
Lynchburg road, made his first trip up the
road that, in passing Charlottesville, he was
waited on by committee, who informed him
that he had better throw up his commission,
charging him with being Black Republican,
e,c. that Mr.. Crook consented to resign on his
return to Alexandria that, on reaching Lynch
burg on Saturday evening, he remained in the
mail car all night, not venturing to come out
This is the substance Of the information fur.

a respectable citizen Of this place, worthy
mechanic, and an old Whig, and never accused
of being or suspected of being Black Repub.
lican, and is true Virginian, and every way
loyal to his own State."

 We hope that no man in the present crisis of affairs will take advantage of the necessities of the people by advancing the prices of their goods, wares and merchant dse He who does it is no better than Hook of revolutionary memory. A mer- chant who has bought bacon at 10 cents and sells it at 90, coffee at IA and sells i, at 25, flour at and sells it at 10, is an enemy of his tace and country. No pa. triot will do it. Every friend of humanity will execrate it. Our merchants should seH everything they have on hand at their usual prices; when they have to purchase new supplies at advanced rates, then they should sell at reasonable advance only. Otherwise the poor of our town and coun- try will be unable to live at all, especially when we have hundred thousand volun- teers in the field. Every dollar extorted from the necessities of our people is just so much aid and comfort to the enemy. We hope every man who respects himself, and loves bis country and regards human ity, will frown down all approaches to ex- tortion."""

The city is in the most fearful state of agita-
ton. Troops from all parts Of the South are mr.
irving here every day, averaging 5Oo 10 ooo
daily, 20 that for some time 10 come we may
count on an increase of the Confederate army
in Virginia at the rate of 1000 per week. The
whole number of troops in the State estImn'e

mond and vicinity, 5000; at Lynchburg 3,OVo
at Hsrper's Ferry, 500; at Norfolk, $500,
and 10 the other cities and villages of the State,
5000. At the present rate OF increase from tho
South the army will reach 5000O a month hence.


On their arrival here the Southern troops are
sent nto camp near Richmond, or distributed
10 the various exposed points. Most OF the
troops are yong, having scarcely reached adult
age, entirely inexperienced, ill-clad, and i'larmed,
but thus far tclerably well fed. They require
much drill before they will bc able even TO pre-
cent respectable trout in pitched battle. The
best portion of them 10 the militia of Richmond
Charleston, aud other large cities, and this is
tolerably effective body of gentlemanly soldiery.
But neither the majority Of these inexperienced
youth nor the gentlemen soldiers, will be of much
use in q military point of view for some time,
aud the only really formidable force is mace up
of the hardy troops of Tennessee. Mississippi
and Louisiana, who have smelled powder In
actual fight with the Indians and the MeNcans,
and the soldiers of South Carolina who have
been accli mated TO war during the last five
months at Charleston. These available troops
| comprise about one.tbird of the Virglnian army,
and are increasing in about that proportion, 70
| that in a month there will be about 15,CO0 Of
! them, aud even more perhaps, as their superior
effectiveness will no doubt suggest to the Goa
federate authorities the propriety OF sending
proportionately larger number of these than
of inferior troops. Bat nust not forget that
the experience of these troops has been NANNY
in guerrilla warfare with the Indians ard Mex
leans, and that they have never yet been set face
10 face with a regular, well-organizcd army.
They are excellent for scouting parties and for
surprises, but before on enemy capable of scien-
tic strategy they will be fourd to have but few
military resources. The system, therefore, which
will be employed against tae Northern troops
will most likely be that of guerrilla warfare, in
| which these troops will be in their element. No
doubt the commanders will endeayOr to give an
| appearance Of scientific organization 10 their
men; but it remains to be seen whether they
will be able 10 make respectable troops out Of
their regiments of dashng adyenturers.


The officers present a remarkable contrast to
the soldiers. They are usually accomplished gen.
tlemen, while the privates are inferior in every
respect. have many times heard here tho
statement that the army has efficient officers but
iDeff ,ient men. The efficiency, however, of the
officers is exaggerated here. Lee, the General
in command, is cavalry officer, and good
engineer. He is man who hos the old Virginia

Just as we we're going to press last night
a despatch was received by Gen. Gwyinn,
that the Seventh regiment Of New York, in
their attempt to proceed from Annapolis to
Washington, we're met and cut to pieces by
the Marylanders, between that city and
Marlboro, Maryland.


The Lynchburg Virginian, of the 9th

patch:


Baltimore has triumphedl The Massachu-

Ter, numbering near 800 men, we're taken

100 of the Massachusetts, men were killed

public mind yesterday. Many of our reapscta'
bic citizens who have heretofore been support
ing Vult6, wheeled round for Brown when they
discovered that the only effect of persistlng in
throwing their votes away on candidate who
has no possible chance Of success, was to elect
the very worst candidate for Sheriff now be-
fore the people. As soon as it was made clear
TO the public mind that either Brown or Lynch
muet be elected, there vas quite change IN
favor of the Peoples Union candidate. Among
intelligent and observing citizens, We fancy
there are but few men now left in the city
who care to take the responsibility Of indirectly
assisting to elect Lynch."

ordered back by Col. Corcoran. Now, it
grieycs US TO the iomost soul to say, that all


this ia a rosy delusion on the part OF Mr.


James Is. Kirkor, in which he would have our


readers and tho public reciprocally indulge-the


stern reality being that the heroic tract distrib-


utor and eminently religious bookseller did no
duty whatever with the 69th, his angelic visits
to Georgetown College and Arlington Heights
being, not only few and far between, but SIM
py visits of pleasure and as assurances 70 ihe
Colonel, and other officers Of the 69th, OF Mr..


James b. Kiuker's lively interest and distin-
quished consideration. On no occasion was he
on picket duty, or or a scouting party, or at
any post either of honor, labor or danger. In
this respect, Mr.. James u. kirker's military
record is Il virgin blank. In signing himself,


however, as Captain Of The Corps Of Engi-
neers of the 69tb,"" be does a mean little
Injustice to Capt. james Quinlan, now Major
OF the ith Regiment Of The Irish Brigade, who
acted as Captain Of the said Engineers oil
through the three months campaign, and be-
haved not only with unremitting diligence, but
with decided nerve and pluck on every occa-
sion that required his services. Mr.. James b.


Kirker in fact, is no more entitled to sign
himself "" Captain of the Corps Of Engineers OF

having enjoyed the luxury Of seeing their duties
performed by other gentlemen; Thomas Francis
Meagher, for instance, acting as Major Oh the
march to Centreville and during the battles Of
the 18th and ?lst of July instead Of the de-


mestic Alderman and ex-Csptain Of the
Goth. Nor does Mr.. James b. Krker less in
nocenily endeavor to magnify bis journeying
with the 69th on the road to Manassas. One
would naturally infer, from the style in which
he speaks Of bis accompanying the regiment on
the march until ordered back by the
Colonel, that Mr.. James D. Kirker
had nerved himself for the conflict, and
was prepared to encounter al the hazards
of the advance. How coldly does the stern
reality, in this case also shine beside the illu.

have us to exuberate. MIR. James d. Kirker

Of the better elements which usually mingle IN
the political cauldron resulted yesterday in
very light vote, and a result that our City has
no reason to be proud Of. Lynch is OF course
elected Sheriff; the persistent running OF Fulte
without shadow OF chance to succeed, and
the earnest support accorded him BY many OF
our beat citizens, rendered this misfortune IN
eyitable, though Tweed polled much better
vote than either his friends or hiS adversaries
generally expected. Had he been faithfully
supported by the particular friends of bis asso-
ciates on the Tammany ticket, he must have
succeeded; for the general result Of this cleo
ton proves the Tammany faction stronger in
our City than that which follows the personal
fortunes Of Mayor Wood.


We might have chosen Mr.. Brown Sheriff if
the devoted adherents Of Mr.. Vulte had not
chosen TO defeat him. We mean to repay this
by working hard for their worthy and capable
favorite be he who he may, whenever he ap-
pears to have better chance than our own.


The firm of Fernando Wood, Alderman &C.
net and Oakley Hall have done good business
this time--Genet having secured the TanlmaDy
and Mozart and Hall the Republican and Mo-
zart nominations. For the first time, Fernando
has had to pay in advance for services expect
ed. but we will not distrust the good faith OF
his shrewd and capable allies. They may not,
however, be equal to the task of comprising
his reelection.


Yet, though the general result of this elec-
ton. 30 far as the City is concerned, is super
fcially dishearteDipg, it enfolds the seeds oi
wholesome changes. Support the Regular
{"" Nominations ~ has lost It's charm. There
was more Independent voting than usual. In
but few instances did the political preferences
of a district enable the shrewdest calculator to
tell beforehand who would be elected to the
Assembly. And, while number of nobodies
and two or three Infamous scoundrels are
chosen TO the next House, the character OF
the delegation is decided improvement on
that of either of the last two years. There
are not less than six men elected who compre-
hend that they are sent to Albany to legisate
for the good of the community, and not to be
the abect sycophants of party managers or the
purcbascd tools of mammoth jobbers.


The worst feature Of this result is the defeat
and displacement of Judges Hoffman and Wood
ruff of the Superior Court, for which Fernando
Wood is alone responsible. He had perfect
right to oppose those judges, or any one else,
in fair, open, manly manner: he had nc
right TO stab them in the dark as he did. By
nominating them in his Convention, he threw
their friends of their guard, leading them to
suppose their reelection matter OF course;
then, by secretly substituting the names OF then
Tammany competitors, Messrs. Mcneil and
Barbour, on his printed ballots, he sealed the
doom of two of the most upright, capable, ant
popular judges our City ever bad. Had II
been seasonably known that the Judges were
struck at, thousands Of votes could have beer
rallied in their favor: as it is, they are foully
beaten. We blame not their successful com
petitors but the engineer Of their prescription
Messrs. Clerke and Brady might have been re
elected without Republican vote; 20 nigh
Judge Lott in the surrounding district; bu
they are honored by o unanimous support

so much for DIR. Wood Now let us take
more general view OF the whole matter


We have never supposed, however desirous
a,d hopeful Of substantial union, that such
men as Fernando Wood, merely trading poll
tcisps. would cease TO SANDER the Republican
Party. Some live to eat, and some lie that
they may 80 live. Hence in certain localities,
in which something's Mayoralty, seat in
Congress, or the like-is to be secured by
abusing the Republicans, We shall be fercey
and falsely abused. There are men, prnci-
pally in the great cities, who are determined
that, even in the,e perous times, there shall
be dissension aud partisan conflicts and con-
tested e!ectons-that the old battles and bro
kerage shall 20 on, and that the national
crisis shall not abate in their souls ono jot of
their sefsbness The only way to silence
these men ia to nominate them for some
plenteous place, and then, maugcr
memories and misgivings, to extend
to them the hearty aud unanimous
support Of the Republican party. Otherwise,
the individual whose portrait We are about to
attempt will be uncommonly rampant and
noisy. lie will profess that he is for the Union,
outside and inside and in all his members; but
he will hint that our Southern brethren""
have, after all, their injuries. He will talk OF
cur glorious log, but express his doubts OF the
orthodoxy of the Presidents proclamations. He
will ayow himself patriotic to degree, but he
will suggest that it is cruel to lock up anybody
in Fort Lafayette. He will talk, just as Mayor
Wood has been talking, Of the sovereign virtues
of Democracy; and he will be most decidedly
Of opinion that the only way to get out Of this
difficulty is TO elect him and his friends to Of
fee. Mozart Hall can do it, if it has chance |!
Only give Mozart Hall chance


Now, the simple truth is-and Mozart Hall
and all other Halls may as well understand it
the truth is t"" our Southern brethren"" now
in arms against their constitutional rulers, do
NOT care one straw either for Fernando Wood,
or Jimmy Lynch. They like, with lazy sort
of liking, such ngrained Northern traitors as
Levi s. Chatfeld, esq.-men who just manage
to keep their hands out Of the MarshaPs fet-
tcrs-but with muskets on their shoulders and
swords drawn, what do they care for Fernando
Woods honey -sOapi The Southern Conied-
"" eracy'' is not in arms to help him to fat
contracts and opulent acquisitions. The
1"" Southern Confederacy' thinks just as much
of our opinion as ii does of Fernando Woods
opinion, and wants our good will just as much
as it wants his. Suppose that, by some exsraor'
dinary miracle, Mr.. Lincoln should to-day be
deposed, and +. Wood hoisted into the Presi
dency. Suppose majority of pure, unmitgatet

must be made for men who must say some
tbiog, and who have nothing to say. The
facilities for competing strictly party tickets
aud for the conference of strictly party organi.
cations are becoming day by day more and
more limited; and the utter insignifcance of
any mere man. however bustlipg and obtrusige
his position has heretofore been, is becoming
more and more apparent. One who thinks
that elections are now to be canvassed upon
the differences of the past, will talk the out
worn jargon of the past, as our Mayor did.
We cannot expect any selfish schemer who
looks upon all government as instituted for bis
personal aggraudzement, to rise to the hight
of the new duties which these new occasions
create. But it is relief to know that, as
time passes and public emergencies press, this
stale prattle Of the platforms will become
less welcome to the least intelligent
audience, and may even grow to be
uDfa.hionabIe in Mozart Hall. IDsolent gener-
alizatons and uucbartable imputatlons, sug-
gestions of the false and impressions OF the
true, loose Phrase. and charges thousand
times uttered, and not only thousand times
specially refuted, but refuted too BY the whole
tenor Of history, may answer the purposes oi
party SPECTATORS well enough, in ordinary
times: but when the Northern intellect has
been sharpened by the presence OF actual
danger, and all are compelled to reason

force itself upon the public mind. The num-
Der of those who now appreciatively understand
the character of Slavery, compared wth
those who comprehended it year ago.
is as thousand to one. IL Is
astonishing how much stock rubbish has, within
a few months, gone under ground, leaving only
,ncb noisome traces as are to be found ia
Mozart Hall. The Scripture argument, the
chronological argument, the Constitutional argu-
ment, in favor of Slavery; the Disuuion appeal,
the Brotberly-LOve appeal, the Raw. Head and
Bloody Bones appeal, how they have all died
away, leaving only their faint echoes in Mozart
Hall, responsive to the nightingale notes of
Mayor Wood And the nation will not go
backward. Not one District Election or one
Municipal Election, whatever the result, will
change the current Of Northern thought, or
stay the irresistible conclusions Of the Northern
mind.


Unless, iudeed-and 10 this limitation Of
our assertions we desire to call especial notice
unless Mr.. Woods extraordinarily large grain
of Mozart mustard. seed shall become the great
tree which he anticipates, with ample roosting
room for Levi S. Chatfeld, jimmy Lynch, and
himself. Then, indeed, all will be serene-f
we may take his word for il. All we need is
more Mozart Democracy. And does mt Mr..
Wood, who is one of the furthest-sighted OF
prophets--does MT he say that We are TO have
Mozart Democracy, more and stronger--not
confined to one lone hall, but spread all over
the land, healing, binding, stanching blood,
cementing gaps. and setting the National
boncs' Does mt he say that Mozart Democ-
racy is utterly to drive out, exterminate and
demolish the other kind-ths venerable Tam
many VARIETY This, we confess, is cheerful
way of looking at the matter. 1t is pleasanter
than victories, and more palatabe than defeats.
If Mr.. Wood will but undertake to restore
the Union by contract-and who understands
contracts better than he does we shall be IN
favor of paying him well for the work, with
the proviso strictly enforced, that he is not to
be paid in advance.

Gov. Jackson, in his message, reviews the
history of events since the adjournment of
the last Legislature, and gives his reasons for
calling an extra session. He severely criti'
cises the action of the President in calling out
militia to fight against the people of the
South He says the action of the President
is evidently unconstitutional and Illegal and
will only tend to still further ALLEVIATE the
people of the free and slaveholding States.
In his opinion it is sufficient to say the ques-
tion to coerce States by the Federal Govern
ment, was proposed in the Convention that
formed the Constitution in several different
forms, and was rejected, and it is an insult to
the common sense of the people to assert
that war upon individual States under the
authority of the State and by virtue of its
commission, or in obedience 10 is govern
ment, is not war upon the State. The Presi-
dent, it appears, has not only discovered

the States, but has assumed that the eXecu-
tive department can incite that war Neither"

LOUISVILLE, KY, Aug. 6, 1861


The Union triumph yesterday bas abated SOL
thing of Secession impuaepce but nothing Of Co
cession malignty. Mr.. Harneys success oleR
Ex-Gov. Meriweather is a source of particulss
exutation among Union men, because the Secss,
sonists selected the latter for his SUPPOSE
adroitness at expert dodge, and then bach,
him up with Ex.GOy. MOrehead to make extrS
stump speeches. But one thing prevented thS
Rebel party from breeding riots at tho pells-a
consciousness of their inferior strength Fss
several days before the election they were busy
in circulating rumors that the soldiers over tho
river at Camp 10. Holt would behave very
Daughtily on election day; and Secession wom'4
and children were taught to shudder and hghf
and express great apprehensioDs OF ""a mob
know of no instance throughout the day, hows
ever in which a soldier from that camp dis{
turbed the peace of any one till his own pescS
was frst broken.


The riot among the rebel soldery at Grand
Junction Town, on the I'd inst, was q whisky
riot. A Louisiana regiment commanded by .
Polish Colonel, and called The Polish Regiments
although composed Of men from almost every
nation, on its way to Virginia, Overhauled ksrs
rel of whisky at Holly Springs. The head vss
knocked out, and each man soused in with his
lineup as one would dip up spring water. One
Of them was tumbled from tho platform at the
Holly Springs depot, aud killed by the ears. As
they proceeded to the JUNCTION., pitching bayo.
nets at one another became pastime. Butby
the time they arrived at the last-named station,
they became completely insubordiDate. Aftet
sOmo rioting in the open air, a part of the rcgi-
ment entered little hotel in the village, and
those Outside, becoming belligerent attacked if
with axes, butts of guns, and other batte.ing 70
gines. Having effected on entrance, they der.ol-
ished all the furniture, and turned the house nI1
confusion. When their Colonel attempted to re-
duce them to order, fight commenced OF alI
more serious character. Several were said to DO
shot down by the commander; and during Ac
entire riot fourteen were left on the gN NJ
killed and wounded, beside many who were q
slightly injured as to be able to proceed on 40
cars. A Memphis correspondent from Gr.Ed
Junction says that the little hotel was Ike
crowded hospital, and its walls resounded with
the groans of the wounded aud dying.


At Mcmshs and at Clarksville, in Tennessee, tie
travelling public are required to present permits
from the Rebel authorities TO pass into or ont OF The
State. They have some mighty business on hand
and are jealous OF disclosure. The blockads
pinching them in many branches Of supply b..
is selling in Nashville at Is and IL cents per pond
and coffee at % to 80. i am inclined to think tht
supply of both bacon and lard has been nearly exc
hausted throughout the South; and if the blocks
ade be kept up ngdly, there must be great want os
animal food for the negroes, well soldiers, d..
ring the approaching Winter. ALI sorts Of ST. =
gems practiced upon the Louisville Surveyor, -
get bacon, lard, and lard oil into the extreme South
ern counties of this State. Now that large sap.
ments to merchants are not allowed there is ca ans
wonted number Of large families down there scnt
of whom have use for as many as ten casks of BE-.
con. One farmer wanted 20 or 80 barrels of mesa+
pork for his farm"" There is great hankeriAes
believe, to ship butter and miserable boarding.
house"" butter is sometimes seized in large lotss
making its way to the South in wagons. / am st D.
loss to know what they want with it.


Here are several rich specimens of the ""snake

press, about Manassas:

 A review of all the troops under Gen. McClel. len will soon be held in Washington. Then we shall know something about the actual force of our army on the Potomac.

 A battle between Gen.'s Rosecranz and Lee is expected beyond doubt to-day in Western Vir- ginia.

 The report of the battle near Springfield, Mo. is unfounded.

 The privatcer Sumter'' has been heard of in the harbor of Trinidad, and had captured eleven American vessels.

 The 9th and 7th regiments have been filled by the consolidation of partly formed companies, and will leave Monday, for destination now unknown.

 The 4th regiment, in Maryland, has resolved itself into Temperance society, and the officers and men, headed by Lieut.. Col. White, have signed the pledge This is much better than good.

 A reliable correspondent of the Baltimore American reports that whole Mississippi rogi- ment stationed at Leesburg, Fa., broke up on Saturday and started home

 A Richmond paper, apparently on good au- thority, sums up the confederate force before Washington to ll2,0OO men. The Southern pa pers complain of the ineticiency of the coast protection of the South, and say that the govern ment is spending all its efforts on Virginia.

 THE WEEK has passed without any movements of an important character in the situation of the hostile armies. The national scouts are adyan- cing toward the rebels, and the pickets have been removed mile nearer the enemy. On the other hand the rebel flag faunts within plain expected. There is rumor of Q rctrogade movement of Gen. Beauregartl's forces, but this is not confirmed. It is well understood how ever that he must attack Washington or suffer a disruption of his army by the withdrawal of the troops to the invaded states of the confelcracy There seems 10 be no authentic information o1 the death of Jeff. Davis. He is probably still this side of the guIf.

TIE REBEL Notifications on Munson's Hill art now completed. Monday morning masked bat tcrics in that vicinity were opened on the encamp ments of our pickcts, on Bailey's Cross Roads but without any effect. Our shsrpshooters re sponded with fatal results to two of the rebel al vanced pickets.

 A DESPATCH from Cairo reports that the rebe forces at Columbus, Ky, have been increased t, tcrv, and three companies of cavalry. Polk has also there a g.,nhoat and three steamers. Jeff Ihorapsons force remains cppotite. FovR vessels were Monday seized at prov dence, R. l., under the confiscation act. TIE MAINE State election was held Monday with the following results, so far as heard from Washburn: Republican, 7l9l votes Jamcscn War Democrat, 3,i9l; Dana, Peace Democrat 1881.

 THE WAR Department has accepted plans tol the erection of two new forts at Baltimore. FURTHER NEWS FROM IArrERAs INlEr.-Com mander Roan has written letter to the Secrea "" of tie Navy, dated ' United States steamer Pawnee, Hatteras Inlet, September 5,' of wLicl the following Is an extract:

 Ina communication addressed to the com mant:er-in-chicf at Hampton Roads, l informed him that had forwarded eleven of the fugit;ves in the Peabody, to be landed at Hampton Roads supplying them with provisiods to last thelr there. Another of the fugitivcs of this partv have retained to act as pilot in these waters should his services be required. From thc best information l can obtain, ten regiments have been recalled from Virginia to defend the state The secessionists residing near the water are de serlng their residences and seeking shelter ir the interior. The poorer classes remain waiting for protection to avow their Union sentiments

 The following despatch from Louisville Ky. was received at Washington, Saturday night: LOUISVILLE, Sept. sth, 1861. Richmond and Memphis papers of the 5th Charlcstonan New Orleans of the 4th, ant Nashville of the 9th have been received here X panic produced by the capture of the Hattera: forts continues to rage all along the Gulf Coast the papers clamorously demand the strength enng of the sea-coast defences of the rebel Gov , ernment. Their terror is greatly increased by constant reports of further aggressive movements of the Union army. Large numbers of families l are flying from Wilmington and all women and children have been removed from Newbern A regiment of infantry and batteries hurried to ths defense of the latter point.

 Evidently from the tone of the Richmond pa pers, the threatening of the Gulf coast will pro duce change of strategy on the part of the re bel government, and that offensive steps are moi likely to be taken by the by the army of the Pc tomac for some time.

 The lower house of the North Carolina legis lature refuses, by large majority, to pass an act reconvening the Convention that passed the SC. cession ordinace. The refusal produced q storm of fdenunciation by the ultra secession papers which declare that it will produce internecine strife in the old North State. Sickness still fearfully prevails in the rebel ar my in Virginia. At Lynchburg, Richmond Fredericksburg and Leesburg over 5000 men are in the hospitals Tie small pox is raging vio entiy.

We give the following extract from the
London Times, not as rejecting our own
views at all, but by way of showing what the
English sentiment is regarding the present
crisis in America


Heretofore, when a President has been
elected, he has been supported at least by a
minority In every State of the Union But
ID the present instance there Is a considera-
Ole number of States in which uot q single
vote was cast for the successful candidate-
Ihls, 1t Is said, and not without some show
otjustice, tends directly to that state of par
ties against which Washington enphatically
counselled his w-citizens-the dividing
themselves into factions designated by geo
graphical limits. 1t must always be remem-
bered, however, that if Mr.. Lincoln has not
had even minority in the Slave States, this
has happened because on questions relating
to the extension or maintenance of slavery a
great number of the Southern States allow of
no minority. A man may have opinions ad-
verse to slavery, anda man may reside in
Slave State. but he cannot do both these
things at once If he asserts bis opinions, he
must change his residence, or must prepare





the jurisdiction of Lynch Law. If, then,
there be no minority in favor of the Presi-
dent elect in some Of the States. it is because
in them, on the question of slavery, there ia
no free discussion, no liberty of thought,
speech, writing or action; and it is to this
source, and not to any peculiar factiousness
in theAsupporters of Mr.. Lincoln, that the
sharpness of the division now made apparent
between the North and the South is to be
traced In the North there are maiorites
and minorities on the slave question in the
South there is at least apparent unanimity,
Just as there is an appearance of an univer-
sal belief in the Roman Catholic religion in
Spain or in the States of the Church.


Another effect of the change which has
just taken place is one not peculiar to Amer
lea, but which was strongly felt in England
thirty years ago. The Southerners and their
allTes owing to tenure of office extending
over SO many years, have obtained q monop-
oily of official knowledge and aptitude go
long and solhrmly established has been their
dynasty that the cause of the North has been
deserted in despair by the ablest of Northern
politicians. Seeing no chance of doing that
which has just been done, Mr. Webster Mr..
Everett, and number of eminent men of the
same party, have allied themselves to the
South, and sought by concessions to the slave
owning interest to obtain position which
they believed the North would never be able
to give them. These men, the natural lead
ers of the Republican party, were lost to
them owing to this fatal miscualclation, and
Mr.. Lincoln will have to carry on his Gov
ernment by new and untred officials in the
face of an Opposition full of abilities and ex-
perienoe. 1t is, besides, asserted that, atho'
the President is Republican the majority of
the two Chambers is Dcmocratc so that the
new reign starts with that which is only too
often the difficulty of American politics-a
direct conflict between the Legislature and
the Executive Probably this reflection will
tend as much as anything to soften the first
alarm of the South. Upon the whole, though
we do not expect any very considerable ben
ett to ourselves, and although we believe
the Southern States to be a great deal more
frightened than hurt by the recent election,
we rejoice, on higher and surer grounds, that
it has ended in the return of Mr. lincoln
We are glad to think that the march of
slavery, and the domineering tone which its
advocates were beginning to assume over
freedom, have been at length arrested and
silenced."

This is no overdrswu picture. but does

and hung III the South from no other cause

atins aud ammunition to kill their masters |.
with are trumped up against them.


The matter of hanging three men az Fri I

New Orleans there is not even an alluson
made to what has been done there, and
yet can furnish proof If ;ny statement is
doubted, that there were, the week before

 FROM MEMPHIS.

 MEMPHIS, Nov. 1.-The following is from correspondent of the Argus: ',Columbus 9 P M. At early dawn we were aroused from pleasant sleep to the welcome summons that the fotilla were on us. Every man was in- stsntly to his gun; our company commanding the guns on the bluff under the direction of the gallant Keith, which includes the l28 pounder. At Il A. M, the battle began. The general obstinacy surpassed even that of Ma nassas. Our troops were overwhelmed and driven into the river, but were rallied by their brave commander and held the enemy in check until arrival of Gen. Pillows division.

THE MOVEMENTS OF THE REBELS.


There is no news of startling import, save
that which comes from st. Louis, OF which you
have full adyjces from other sources. The men
sent out from General SCOTS Office to recon-
noiter South are daily returning, and all
bring the same account of bodies of men at
Richmond, Lynchburg Montgomery, New orleans,
and Pensacola. They all agree, too, that the
troops intend to march on Washington, aud that
if that plan is abandoned, the leaders viii ind
il difficult to restrain the men


THE TwENTY-EGHTH IN. Y) REGIMENT
AS the conflicting rumors concerning the viii
lngness of tie 26th New-York Regiment to take
the oath are calculated to do harm, Will state
that majority of the members are Germans,
who did not, at first, comprehend the nature OF
tie oath, and were apprehensiye of some trick
cry. In fact, one entire company at first de-
oned to be sworn, but after explanation bad
been made, they with aacrity marched into line,
and after saluting their adopted flag, took the
oath for the requisite time. Out OF the entire
regiment, there were but l3 who were unwilling
to Oblgate themselves. No regiment here has
finer material for service than this. One OF Its
Officers served with distinction in the Prussian
army for many years, and three-fourths of the
members have seen and participated in actual
hostities


A DISAPPOINTMENT.


No little indignation is felt in certain regiments
by members who were expecting to serve their
country, and whose employers ia New-iers had
granted them leave of aoseIce, with continued pay,
that they should now be compelled to resign aud
retarp, or allow their families to suffer on account
OF the stoppSge OF salaries by the AFORESAID EN-
ployers 1t would seem no more than Justice IL
the names of such employers could be puDilshed-
As it is, however they may take sober second
thought and re-decide.

DEcoRUM AND QUIET


Notwithstanding the immense force here, the
decorum and quiet of troops is in the highest
degree commendable. Many wants are neglected,
and many fair expectations disappointed, but this
ia the natural consequence Of the exigencies of
the times. The soldiers of the Republic now Oh
the ground are in excellent health, and in the
highest spirits. They have good cause go-
rious destiny before them.

 MT. Futile was returning home from Winsted at about o'clock, P. M., in skeleton wagon when, in passing by Woodford's house, Wood ford shot him with double barrel gun, the charge taking effect in his right side, passing through his heart and coming ont under his left arm Tuttle's body was found in Woodford's yard with bruise upon his face, af if made by falling from his wagon, and his horse hitched to posi- in the yard. Futile lived about ten minutes only after being shot, Woodford immediately gave himself up to the authorities, ,and the inquest and examination was held at Winsted on Tuesday and Wednesday and is postponed till Friday.

 The cause for the bloody deed is supposed to be fierce personal enmity between the parties, oflong standing. We learn that there were strong indications of lynching the murderer by the people of Winsted on Tuesday,,

 Tuttle's funeral was attended on Wednesday afternoon by an immense concourse of people."

Cincinnati papers furnish US with the fol
lowing items of interest


Mr.. Corwin has peremptorily declined the
Mission to Mexico, rendered him by Mr.
Lincoln. Whether be will accept some
other appointment, if indeed one is rendered
him remains to be seen.


The President still holds the Mission to
England under advisement 1t is thought,
however, that Hon. VIM. l.. Dayton Of New
Jersey or Hon. Charles Francis Adams of
Massachusetts, will be appointed.


J. L. Motley, the well known historian,
is urged for the mission to Holland. Mr..
Lord and Mr.. Thayer, both correspondents
here are named prominently for the Collect
orships at Alexandria, Egypt and St.
Thomas, West Indies.


Gen. Scott has convinced great many
Republican Senators that there was no al
tentative left but the withdrawal of the
garrison from Sumter, and the report of the
| special board of army officers fully confirms
| his statement in every particular.


e. Joy Morris, of Philadelphia, an accom-
plished linguist and politician, is prominent
| ly named for Sardinia. Anson Burlin
! games name is also revived, but Geo. P.
Marsh is pressed by the New Englanders as
a better man. Carl Schurz is beginning to
turn his attention to some other post say
the Brazilian mission, since so formidable
an opposition is manifested to his going to
Sardinia.


There are quite number of office-seek-
ers here from Virginia, mostly for post
offices. Even from Lynchburg there are
five applicants, and the contest in their
cases is as vigorous as elsewhere.


Mr. Greiner of Ohio, editor of the Colum-
bus Gazette, viii probably be selected for
the Governorship of New Mexico, vice Nr.
Rencher of North Carolina.


Mr.. Jones, well-known as prominent
politician, has been appointed Marshal of
the Northern District of Illinois,


The strife over the Baltimore appoint
ments wakes warm, and great deal of i'll
feeling has sprung up.


Bids for carrying the mails in nearly nine
hundred routes in New York and the New
England States will be opened on the 8lst
inst. The annual cost Of carrying the
mails in these States under existing con
tracts is $I,oO2,065. OF this, SIPS, 762 /
paid for the transportation of mails over


5,444 miles of railroad.

Esquire Robinson, ot Shelby county, of c'mpi- ny A, 2d regiment, was captured, and was on the ho,t at the time our troops were pouring galling fire into them, ana he estimates the number of killed on the boats at over 200. He was returned to Columbus to day.

 There can be no houDJ that the troops brought against us on the 7th were the very best in the Lincoln service, as their plisouers here acknoW- ledge.

 The loss of Russell's brigade is as follows 2d regiment Is killed, 64 wounded, :3}33 missing; 18th regiment, 2S killed, 70 wounded, 4S miss ing; 18th regiment, 10 killed. 10 wounded and mlssing making total ot 56 killed, l47 wound ed and S5 missing.

 A steamer, bearing flag of truce, came to Columbus to-day, bearing Mrs. Dougherty, and other ladies, who came down to their hus bands, who are prisoners in onr hands.

 We have 100 prisoners in our possession un njured, and about the salne number wounded are iu our hospitals. The enemy are reported to have l02 of our men at Cairo, large num- Der taken from our hospital on the other side. Two gentlemen, residents of Austin, Texas, passed through Columbus today who were talk en prisoners Tn New York on landing from q vessel from South America. After being held for some time, they were released, and after making their way through Canada came down through St. Louis, and were at Cairo on the 9th, the day of the battle. They report that trans ports were continually plying between this point and Cairo on that day, full of dead and wounded, who were received and borne away from the boats at Cairo by the citizens. They further re port that there are two gun boats flushed at St. Louis, aud SIX on the stocks. They bring a Chicago Tribune, which has the candor to say the battle of the 9th was terrible on both sides. In the midst of the battle our batteries were 1 turned upon the gun boats whenever they showed themselues around the bend above. It was plain hat several of our balls from Maj. Stewart ; battery struck the boat, but the amount of the damage was not known at the time. These gentlemen now bring the report, which is con frmed, that the gun-boat Lexington has since sunk from the effects ot her injuries

stated that the Government has determined
10 order 2O,OOO m""re troops to rendezvous at
Washington. General Butler was sent to
Fortress Monroe with land force to commence
operations there between the James and York
rivers. Should Richmond and Norfolk be de.
nuded OF troops to meet ScottS main column,
General Butler will, of course, improve his op.

the preliminary attacks upon the forts are all

military operations upon Virginia must be the
possession Of Richmond. If all the rebel troops
were concentrated there, it could only be taken
after a severe battle. This force can he di.

attached to the office of Aid. Mascher. Elev-
enth Ward, arrested man named John
Zeller and woman named Mary Walder-
berger, on the charge of infanticide, the
crime having been committed at Egg iIarhor
City, New Jersey. 1t seems that Mrs. W.
had given birth to a child about a year ago
which the husband had good reason to be-
leve was the result of criminal intercourse
of his wife, with Zeler, who lived at Egg
IIarbor City. The child died from poison
ground glass and phosphonc match heads
having been given to it. The husband Lewis
Walderberger, was suspected with having
administered the poison, and about nine
months snce he was arrested and tried at
Mays Landing Atlantic county, n. J. He
was convicted and sentenced to be hung on
the 25th of January. His wife and Zeller
came to Philadelphia, where they lived to-
gether as Mr. and Mrs. Smith. After dis
covered testimony proved the innocence of
the doomed husband, and seemed to fasten

Affairs on the Potomac--2OOO Federal
Troops reconnoiHe the Enemy's coun-
uy--Gen. Met lenen's dispatch.",WAsutNaToS Sent iii,"


WASHINGTON. Sept. 1lth.


A large party started out at o'clock this
forenoon from the Chain Bridge, under Col.
| Stephens of the New York Iiighlanders As
our skirmiehers advanced the enemy's pick
cts retrented beyond LeWisville, about seven
miles beyond the Chain Bridge. Our troops
having accomplished their errand connected
with the reconnaissance of the country, cbm-
menced to retrace their steps when a large
force of rebels. consisting of two regiments Of
infantry and Col Stewards regiment of Vir-
ginia cavalry and battery of four pieces
were seen approaching The rebel battery
opened with shell, which was replied to from
Griffin's battery. Several rounds we're fired
when odr troops ceased firing to give the
rebels an opportunity of meeting them on the
open field-the rebels being in the woods.
Our forces on resuring action began with
80 pounder, shell from which soon silenced
the rebel battery they were soon sent flying
with number reelng from their saddles.
There are three killed belonging TO the 10Th
Indiana Regiment. 1t. Hancock is supposed
to be killed. Two were killed Of the Third
Vermont Regiment, and four wounded.


WAsHINGToN, Sept l2th-This morning
firing has been resumed, as If in the direction
of the Chain Bridge. The occasion of it is
not yet known.


Gen. McClelan's dispatch to the Secretary
of War is very brief lie merely says Gen.
| Smith made reconnaissance with 5000 men
to Lewisville, remained there several hours,
and completed their examination of the
grounds, when the work was completed and
the command started back. The enemy
opened fire with she'll, by which two men
were killed and three wounded. GIifln's
battery, he says, silenced that of the enemy,
and our men cane back in perfect order and
excellent spirits The men behaved most ad
mirably under fire, and he concludes 10y re-
marking we shall have no more Bull Run
affairs


WAsnINGroN, Sept. 12th--It is the opinion
here that general engagement cannot much
longer be delayed. Good military critics,
however, declare that they expect no serious
, fighting for two or three weeks.
A dispatch to the Louisville Journal dated
Sept 18th, says ""Gen. Mcclellan has carried
Halls IIill losing fifteen killed"" IL will be
remembered that few days before the
rebels had taken Halls Hill, to the great de-
light of the Richmond papers.

on the 18th instant. on the subject of Ere

the several free States that no more regiments.

sed or received by them, except upon the requi-
sition of the War Department.
The regiments now forming will 1e completed

the service TO assign the already raised to in.
complete organization actually in the field.
General Superintendents of the volunteer ser
vice will be appointed for all the States, and re-
cruiting in each will be directed upon the system
pursued in the regular army.


These Superintendents will be officers of artil-
lery not serving in the field
Depots tor the collection and instruction Of re
cruits under command of the Superintendents
will be established at the following places and
such Others as shall be considered advantageous
in each of the States in the West:

ton Barracks: Michigan, Detroit; Illinois, Spring
field; Indiana, Indianapolis; Ohio, Columbus;
Kentucky, Louisville.

their respective States
No more cavalry will be accepted by the Gov

Government can use.

that one of them, and probably two,

another in her wheel, and a third tore
off about three feet OF the iron casing

The war is but beginning, aud oil the antece


dents of the Northern justify tho belief that
their first efforts would be the least successful
They have encountered one single disaster, and
have set about repairing it with the patient vgor
OF men who can afford making sure their next
advance at any expenditure OF labor and money.
With the dignifed humility that is not above
learning from defeat and danger, they have
thoroughly fortified their own capital before
making another attempt upon the elemy's.
They have made Of Washington an arsenal and
depot, as well US a fortress. They have collect
cd there an immense store of guns, with so many
horses as to suggest to our special correspondent
that Gen. Mcclellan means to win the campaign
with field artillery. Ii the new commander has
not under his orders much larger army
than his predecessor, he has brought 1t into in
fuitely better condition. Ho has certainly
checked the approaches of Dcauregard to the
lines before Alexandria, and could probably in
ilict upon assailants severe repuse. II he is
not master of the south bank Of the Potomac
from HArper's Ferry to Fort Monroe, he has col


ected marine force sufficient to render the
passage of the river almost impossible. The
physique and morale Of the new levieJ are such
us to satisfy even the experienced eye of Mr.


Russell. The maritime superiority of the Feder-
nlists is now becoming practically manifest.
| The hardy seamen OF the New England sea-
board are entering for service on board the gum
boats built with marvellous celebrity in the dock
yards of Maine and Massachusetts. A naval
expedition of four thousand men and one hun
dred guns has left Old Point, probably for the
const OF North Carolina. On the southwest, the
hanks Of the Mississippi are likely to witness the
advance Of an overland expedition against New
Orleans. General Fremont is taid to have been
charged with the conduct Of this bold enterprise,
and to have no scruples with regard 10 the accep-

Euening Session-Mr Wallis, Chairman of
the Committee on Federal Relations. to which
the message of the Governor and other docu-
ments were referred, made very long report
thereon, accompanied with the following pre-
amble and resolutions:


Whereas, In the judgment of the General As
&Eo hxyf fho
Government of the United States upon the people
of the Confederate States is unconstitutional in its
origin, purpose and conduct, repugnant to civiliza
ton and sound policy, subversive of the free prn-
ciples upon which the Federal Union founded,
and certain to result in the hopeless and bloody
overthrowing of our existing institutions and


Whereas the people of Maryland, while recog-
nizing the obligation of their State, as member
of the Union, to submit in good faith to the exer
else of all the loyal and constitutional powers OF the
General Government, and to join as one man in


fighting its authorized battles, do ence, never
theless, the great American principle of self gov
ernment, and sympathize deeply with their South
ern brethren in their noble and manly determina-
ton to uphold and defend the same and


to turn away from their own soil the calamfties Of
civil war; but for the blessed sake of humanity and
to avoid the wanton shedding of fraternal blood in
a miserable contest which can bring nothing with
it but sorrow, shame and desolation, the people of
Maryland enlisted with their whole hearts upon
the side of reconciliation and peace; therefore
it is hereby


Resolved by the General Assembly of MARYLAND,
That the State of Maryland owes it to her self
respect and her respect for the Constitution, not
less then to her deepest and most honorable sympa
thies, to register this her solemn protest against the
war which the Federal Government has declared
upon the Confederate States of the South, and our
sister and neighbor Virginia, and to announce her
resolute determination to have no part or lot, d-
rectly indirectly, in its prosecution.
Resolued, That the State of Maryland earnestly
and anxiously desires the restoration of peace be-
fha of
the President, authorities and people Of the Confed
crate States Having over and over again official
ly and unofheially declared that they seek only
peace and self Defense and to be let alone and that
they willing to throw down the sword the in
stant that the sword now drawn against them shall
be sheathed, the Senators and Delegates of Mary
land do earnestly beseech and imploie the Presi-
dent of the United States accept the olive branch
which is thus held out to him, and in the name of
God and humanity to cease the unholly and most
wretched and Improbable strife at least until the
assembling OF Congress at Washington shall have
given time for the prevalence of cooler and better
counsel.


Resolved, That the State of Maryland desires the
peaceful and immediate recognition of the indepen-
dcnce of the Confederate States, and hereby gives
her cordial assent thereunto as a member Of the
Union, entertaining the profound conviction that


the willing return of the Southern people to their
former federal relations is thing beyond hope,
and that the attempt to coerce them will only add
slaughter and hate to impossibility.


Resolved, That the present military occupation
of Maryland being tor purposes In the opinion OF
this Legislature, in fragrant violation of the Con-
stituton the General Assembly of the State in the
name of her people, does hereby protest against the
same, and against the oppressive restrictions and
ilegalities with which it s attended, calling upon
all good citizens at the same time, in the most
est and authoritative manner, to abstain from all
violent and unlawful interference OF every sort with
the troops in transit through territory or quar-
tered among US, and patiently and peacefully to
leave to time and reason the ultimate and certain
re- establishment and vindication of the right.


Resolved, That under existing circumstances it
is inexpedient to call a Sovereign Convention of
the @ rganzation NJ or M al ming Of the militia


Resolved, That when the Legislature adjourn it
adjourn to meet at -, on the day o.
next.


Mr.. Ford moved that the report be accepted
and ten thousand copies ordered to be printed,
which was adopted by ayes 40.

BsYT The opinions of the English press on the
bombardment of Fort Sumter are interesting


They are by no means unanimous. The Times
considers the result of the fght-nobody hurt
perfectly inexplicable. Another journal con-
siders the conflict the most ludicrous affair men
toned in history. A third hopes, that now both


parties have vindicated the honor by carrying
out their preannounced intentions in regard to
Fort Sumter, peace should be made The


Liverpool Post looks upon the matter in a COM
mercal light only, and speaks of the effect on
cotton, which has advanced surprisingly, and


is likely to be still higher.


Bar The Washington correspondent of the


Baltimore Sun says :-""Some glimmerings Of


tie Presidents intended message to Congress

menced on Saturday morning last and contin-

severe, causing Feather River to overflow the
bar opposite town, aud rendering it impas-
sable for anything but small boats. The en-
bankmenis on each side of the bridge which
crosses Dry Greek between here and Lynch

on the river road near Mr.. Murray's. The
bridge across the Honcut, below the Central
House, was rendered so unsafe, on account of
the unusually swollen condition of the creek
that the stages which left Marysville on
Wednesday morning, were unable to cross, and
had to wait until the water in the creek subsi-
ded sufficiently to enable them TO do so, and
consequently did not reach Oroville until about
seven o'clock in the evening, circumstance
which has not happened for years. The Shas-


ia stage which was due on Tuesday at three

Feather river about six o'clock Wednesday

sengers were brought across the river above
Lathrops ferry in small boats, and the teams
taken to Thompsons Flat, as was also the teams
of the Dogtown stage. Though but little rain
fell on Wednesday, and none Thursday, the

 GEMS OF WAR LITERATURE The following gems of southern editorial writing are taken from the Richmond papers of May 7:

 The drunken beast now stalled in the Presi- dental mansion at Washington

 ""The north-whose mercenary legions of pick-pockets, burglars, rowdies, tape measurers and pumpkins are now attempting to organize themselves into an army""

 Are relentless, coarse, greedy and bloody. They will piliage our houses, violate our women, insult and murder defenceless citizens""

 And the following from the Lynchburg Virgin iGn.

 Let tho drunken mutineers at Washington drive on their crazy craft The breakers are ahead, and they must evince more statesmanship than they have yet indicated if they "" eather the storm that is gathering""

 And the following from the New Orleans Dela: A""There is no doubt that the northern people are at this moment fit representatives of the bar barian hordes which formerly devasted the world They are furnishing the very best evil dence that they are incapable of thorough civil ization; that they possess only the outward sym bols of modern enlightenment, while they are by nature miserable sayages.""

 ssA- John LaMountain, the eronaut has for warded to Washington proposition offering his services to travel with the army and make aral reconnoisaces,as as was done by Goddard during the Italian campaign. There are many occassions ; when such aid would be invaluable in determin. ing the character of an enemy's operations. Mir LaMountain is able to do this readily from the fact that he has portable apparatus, capa- ble of easy transportation, for making gas from the decomposition of water."
