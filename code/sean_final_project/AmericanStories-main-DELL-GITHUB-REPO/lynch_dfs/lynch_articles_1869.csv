cOusrr or ROCKY Mousr.. ""A meu,,oo,r,s,T ia",,"| CoUHrY OF ROCKY MOUNT. memorial is


being circulated and numerou;ly signed by citi-
zens ofthc territory interested praying the Gen


eral Assembly to establish new county, to be


known as ""Rocky Mount"" 1t Is proposed to
extend it from the Wilson line on the South to
the Halifax line on the North and to embnce


the territory comprised within six miles OF the
west side Of the W. & W. R. R., and eight miles


of the east side of the w. q W. R. r.


r. The following reasons are given for establish.
ing the county: lst. The great inconvenience at
tending the compulsory presence Of the citizens


at the courts in Tarboro' and Nashville, as IN
some instances the distance to be travelled Is
thirty miles. - iA asg gos


I'd. The hardship incumbent on all classes, es.
pecially the recently enfranchised- are re.
quired to perform the onerous duties Of citizen


ship, such as serving as jurors, witnesses, &C.,


and who, in their impoverished condition, are
frequently unable to make the journey to the


county seats, save on foot, and have to remain


week or more during the busiest seasons, absent
from their homes and business 1t al, expense


much greater than their legal compensation
g. The county seat could be located at some
point on the Wilmington & Weldon Railroad
which runs through the entire length of the
county; there being no spot more than eight
miles from the Railroad-and thus obviate the


above objections. asa5


T. The enhanced value Of the property, the
| new impetus that would be given to business,
all would increase the internal revenue aof the


State more than sufficient to indemnify the ex.


pense of additional Legislators. -, ~
5. 1t requiring no taxation to build court
house, Jail, and to meet other pecuniary burdens
Incidental to the formation Of q new county, as
sufficient sum could be raised by subscription
for all such purposes.


g. In any view OF the matter the number bene.


fitted would greatly exceed that of those, who


would be at all injured. sg 1ai - Ssa

HORRIBLE ATROCITIES IN ALEXANDER CoUN.
TY.-We have just heard of q series of outnges
and murders In Alexander county, the most


atrocous that ever blackened the annals of crime


in North Carolina. 1t seems there was living in
the Bushy Mountain near the line dividing Al


exander from Wilkes, family named Land con-
sisting of James Land, his wife, daughter and
two sons. Our informant states that one of
the young men had disagreement with his els
ter one day last week and she left the house and


did not return until about night. On attemp.
ting TO enter the house she was shot and killed
by her brother with whom she had quarrelled.


Her fath-r, mother and two brothers thencollec-


ted wood and burned the body almost literally to


ashes for the purpose of concealing the crime.
On Wednesday last the inhuman father mother


and brothers were arrested, taken to Taylorsville


and confined In the same room Of Alexander


jail On Friday hight the 18th, Mrs Land was


brutally murdered by her husband and two sons.


The father and sons coolly confessed the mur-
| der next morning anc expressed no regrets
though the stark body of the wife and mother
| lay before them horribly mutilated. The father


was during the day separated from the sons, as
| ii was feared he too would be murdered.
! We learn that the family are fanatical on the
subject OF religion, and are thought to be in


sane, which for the credit of humanity we hope
may be established W sfsiiians % scSsl

The annual meeting of the Portland Insti-
tute and Public Library took place at the Lii
brary Room at 4 o clock yesterday afternoon.


The meeting was called to order by Hon.
William Willis, President of the Institute,
when the minutes OF the last annual meeting
were read by Edw. A. Noyes, Esq, Clerk.


The report of the Directors was then read,
and the number of annual subscribers has in
creased from So to 394 The condition of the
books, the various departments of literature
they represent, and the very complete and rich
collection of periodical literature, is expressed
in the report of the Librarian, who mentions
the donations of Senator Fessenden, Hon.
John Lynch, the daughter of the late Hon.
George Evans, Hon. @. s. Daveis, and the peo-
pie of Portland, who have SO generously res
ponded to his appeals through the columns of
the daily papers


A high compliment is paid by the Directors
to the Libratian, Mr.. Edw. A. Noyes, for his
judieious, arduous and gratuitous services and
by the Librarian, Mr.. Noyes, to Miss M. E.
Barbour, the assistant in charge of the cata-
logue.


Some progress has been made in the fine
arts, enough, it is hoped, to incite greater in
terest in this useful and fascinating branch of
refined culture. The pictures on our walls
show what our native artists can do, and the
vacant spaces invite contributions from native
and foreign artists Sculpture is represented
by admirable specimens of the skill of our own
citizens, as well as fine copies from the antique


ANNUAL REPORT OF THE DIRECTORS.
The Directors call attention to the continued
success of the Institute, and its present useful
and prominent condition. About 5000 volumes.
besides newspapers and pamphlets, of valuable
books have been added to the library the past
year, and the whole number in circulation is
now about 1900. This increase compares fav.
orably with that of all other libraries in the
country, that of the Mercantile Library of New
York having had the largest increase the past
year, viz, 5000 volumes. Neither the Boston
Athen@um or the libraries of Yale and Harv-
ard Colleges received more than $500. This
increase in our library is very gratifying, and
gives us the hope that we may continue pro-
crossing and ultimately present not only to the
general reader, but also to the student all the
works necessary for reference and improve
lnOu1 0Ecdt SIduucdtiOu lS 10 De taken In the
fact that the number of subscribers has in
creased rapidly since the library was first op-
ened, as has also the number of those visiting
the rooms for the purpose of reading. The
number of books taken out per month, at the
start was 100 in June, and in March had in
creased to 1882 or about 100 volumes per day
for working month of twenty seven days.
The number Of life members is eighty.


We must not forget to acknowledge here the
donation of our townsmen, I. P. Harrington
and VIM. W. Thomas-the former of 800 and
the latter of $500-which coming at time of
great need were most acceptable. Such re-
membranes Of our institution and such tokens
of appreciation animate the labors of those who
are striving to place our institution on an ele-
waited plane of social and educational improve
ment. Our Acknowledgements are also due to
the many friends who have SO literally con-
tributed to the library in any form, from hun
dreds Of volumes to single pamphlet; and let
us renewedly urge our citizens to continue
their contributions without being deferred by
the idea that they may be of trifing conse-
quence. Newspapers, old anG new, pamphlets
laid aside, books which have ceased to be of
value to them, novels which have lost their
novelty to their owners; all these go to make
up the apparatus of every large library, and
even duplicates can be made valuable as
means of exchange for newer and fresher
works."

 From the New York Sun.1 e%e

 ' Over year ago, at one o'clock il

 the morning, a Brooklyn police officer

 was carelessly sauntering bown his IL sual beat when he obsoryedia man partly hidden behind a tree ou the op.

 posite side of the street. The officer stopped aud carefully observed the mans movements, In few moments man was observed commiug up tho sidewalk opposite. The man behind the tree stepped from his place oi concealment, and walked down the Tstreet 10 meet the stranger, the police officer still watching him. When the suspicious person. was within twenty feet ofthe stranger, and near gas-light burning brightly beneatlfthcstre the stranger suddenly slapped his forehead with his right hand, and fell to the pavement-a dead man His murderer began to rifle his pockets. The. officer { hastencdto the spot, but the assassin had fed

 The officer pursued him. The chase was hot. Around corners, across half tpaved streets. through slums and alleys, over high board fences and be- meath flickcring gas-lights the mur- derer fled, but keen-eyed hunter was on his track. He was captured. On his line of flight an air-gun of a pecu- liar construction was found. It had done it's deadly work. silently and cfTectualy. It was of simple mechan- ism, and could hardly be considered marvel of mechanical skill.

 The assassin turned ont to be one Skidmore, a discharged policeman. Tn his house, cvcdenee was found which proved that he had been enga- ged for several years in nefarious schemes or burglary and murder Brooklyn was thrown into a state of nervous excitement. Every undiscoy- cred murder was thrown on the shoul- dClS Ql 1AluilOlts iit VI uS "" ttSSuS- cd of being responsible for the pro foundly mysterious ""E;tst river mys- tery,"" where q mans head, pierced with two bullets and wrapped in a piece of oil silk, was found floating in ia Brooklyn dock, tlc thighs and legs, similarly wrapped, bceing after ward picked up near Gowanus.

 On his arrest, Skidmore became as silent IS a inuglca tiger, Crowds of citizens swarmcd to look at him. and loud whispers of lynch-law floated about his cars. He kept up a bold front, but occasioply . twinse was visible oneiiis countonancc as he listened to tho positive evidence before tho Coroner. The crowd surged about him, and gazcd at him as at one of the trapped anii.ropophagi. The air-gun was regarded with the greatest curi- osity. and those inspecting it handled it with circ,mspcction, fearful that a silent bullet was only awaiting signal to add anothcr 10 it's roll of victims.

 The Coroner's jury found Skidmore guilty of thc murder, and the Grand Jury brought in . true bill of indict- ment agaist him.

 Back to his cell went the murderer, with scarcely.a a ray of hope in his heart. The popular excitement did not abate. His speedy trial was demanded. His lawyers could not obtain postpone ment. The trial came on; the evil dence was overwhelming; the people thronged the court room. Skidmores tdefant front failed him at last, and at leangth in despair he cut his throat lin his cell, and escaped the gibbet. ! We do not know what became oi the air gun, but we do know that foi 1 weeks aftcrward many of the citizens of Brooklyn never dared to go Iron their houses at night for fear of si

 lent struggling bulletoy{{ a(l4

 Again we have accounts of shooting with the air-gun-this time in New

 York. A week or two ago we had t' announce the serious injury by pis

 tol shot of young man walking a

 midday on the corner of Broadwa, 2 and Canal streets. The cause is n mys terv which has never been explained

 On Tuesday afternoon, in two divers localities, there occurred circumstan

 ces fortunately less injurious in thei

 effect, but hardly less mysterious Il

 their nature, which seem to point Wit

 an equal assurance to that dabollca

 aoent-an air-gan. Two bullets il , ouick succession crashed through tn

 windows ofa grocery at the intersec | ton of the Bowery and Bond street

 With as little warning a pistol bal

 entered through the plate-glass dooi

 way of BIO Broadway with dangerou

 force. A young man employed i

 Chittcnden's dry goods store was walk

 ing down Broadway Wednesday after

 noon and felt something hit his arm 7 On arriving in his store he ascertaine

 that he had been shot through the arr

 by bullet, which had lodged and re

 mained in his side. Where the bulle

 came from, who fired it, or for what t all these points remain q secret. 0 g Monday an air-gun ball was fire t through ipawnbroker's window i n Center street. On the same evenin s one of these silent messengers of deat e came through . window in the Sun editorial rooms, and one evening lal : week two bullet holes were found"

THE NAVY REGISTER.


rle semi-annual Navy Register has Just been
issued. A notable change appears in the list
OF STAN officers, in which the rank of officers
nas been reduced in conformity with the late
general order of the department, based upon
Attorney General Hoars opinion Of March
18th last. In the present register the highest
rank held by any staff officer is that Of COM
mander, while in former registers several off,
GERS rank with captain, according to length oI
service. The new register also contains a list
OF changes in the names of vessels

that the people of New Orleans did not believe
that an Investigation would be prosecuted and

ted


Secretary Boutwell, replied that the parties
would be tried. the evidence presented TO the
country, and no compromise accented. even
though more money was offered than was due
the government; that the civil and criminal
suits will be pressed with vigor and determina-
tion, end the guilty parties exposed; that Mr.
Borefeld, Solicitor of the Treasury, has been
seDl to New Orleans to aid in the legal pro-
ceediugs, and that should there be no convic-
ton 1t will be owing to the corruption of the
judge and jury.


According to the present view OF the case the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue has d ecid-
ed that the use of a fac simile die to impress
their names upon stamps cannot be allowed
hereafter. The resolution requires the actual
sign ature of Collectors on such stamps. This
revokes the authority given by the late Com
missioner Rollins, allowing the practice of fac
SMILES of their names.


THE SITUATION IN MISSISSIPPI


Rev. james Lynch, colored, Of Mississippi
denies the recently published statement that
he pledged Judge Dent the support OF the col-
ored people of his State. Mr. Lynch has made
arrangements for an interview with General
Grant and Judge Dent on Thursday next He
declares that all further efforts at reconstruct
tion should be based on universal suffrage and
universal amnesty; that the white people OF
mississippi have as thoroughly abandoned re-
sistance to the doctrines of the Republican
party as they did to the government when the
armies of Gen. Lee surrendered; and that they
do not feel any interest in common with the
Democratic party; that the Southern white
man comedies the colored man equal political
rights, and there will be no issue between
them, and to create one would be q curse to
both races Mr.. Lynch has conferred with
many OF the leading radicals."

preserve the independence of the several De-
partments of the Government. lltprovides that

pcrsen to office, unless requested in writing bv
the President. or heads otDepartments, shall be
guilty Of mlstemeanOr and fined 81 900, unless
by a member OF the Senate in his constitutional
capacity


the civil service absolutely neces-


sary. In vast majority of cases appoint
mcnts were dictated by an influence utterly
unknown to the Constitution. Every member


OF this Senate ana OF the other House knows


that n majority of all the appointments are
made at their dictatiOn, and the President and
heads OF Departments are not left free to select


officers with an eye slngly to the public good. II
is generally the case that representatives claim
the appointments within their districts. and
where district is represented by an opposition
member the Senators will claim the privilege of
making the appointments. Often a good officer is
tnrned out because he did not go for the nomiRa-
ton OF the member of Congress from his district.
1iembelS OF Congress are often heard to saw that
they have such and such debts to pay, and tiIi>
is what it means often times. An Office j. made
Just to subscrvc the interests of some member of
Congress. All this is sIbvcrsive of tn CDnSt-
tuition, and is ,iemoralizing i'll the eNtrema.
This IL why we have the spectacle OF Senators
and members crowdjng the ante-chambcrs ofthe
President and heads OF the Departments. Ii s


m Pftral
a debit and credit account with members OF
Congress i'll this matter, charging them with
some certain Offices and crediting them with
Gel tain offices. If this bill l. passed it will allow
members of Congress to attend to their legi j.
mate duties, and relieve the President and the
heads of Departments from the pressure now
brought to bear uIOn hem.


Mr.. Davis was glad that the attention of the
Senator had been directed to this subject He
desired To know, however, how the State OF
Kentucky was to have good Officers, as she had
Senators and Representatives who had no in
fiuence with the appointing power. There was
one case in Kentucky now, in the Lexington
district where the present Internal Revenue
incumbent, q gallant soldier of the late war;
and who voted for General Grant, and who was
trusted by every one, was constantly mali sncd
by the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, who
had been seeking 10 compass his removal for
twelve months. There were other cases. The
manner i'll which appointments had been made
in Kentucky was shame and disgrace 10 the
administration.


| Mr.. Yates did not think il in accordance with
the dignity Of Senators to be signing recon-
mendatiOns oi persons to office. lie had seen
three signatures passing around, and he must
confess ii, his OWN. too, but he did not not like
il. He did not think it proper that Senators
who passed upon the nominations for Office
should solicit those nominations to be made.
Mr.. Drake offered a resolution that the Ser
geant-at-Arms lie directed to clear the floor OF

The Senate then adjourned.
HOUSE.-Immediately after the reading of
the journal, on motion Of Mr.. Schenck, the
House resolved itself into Committee OF the
Whole (Mr. Ferry, OF Michigan in the chair )and
resolutions were offered and adopted formally
referring the various portions of the Presidents
message to the committee having in charge the
subjects respectively OF which the message
treats.


Alter the resolutions had been read Mr.
Schcnck said he did rot propose to make
speech upon the resolutions. They were offered


for the purpose OF facilitating the business of the
House. Ii any gentleman wanted te speak upOn
the general subject he would yield. but lie
thought time would nc saved by considering the
matter as il came up from time to time i'm the
shape of bills from committees.
Mr.. Cox asked whether under the resolution
the Committee of Ways and Means that OF
Banking and Currency took charge of the matter
relating to the resumption of specie payments
Mr.. Sohenck replied that that question occu-
pied sort of debatable ground between the two
committees named, and he thought it could be
best left for the committees themselves TO settle
by mutual agree nent.


Mr.. Wood \. W said the resolution referred
the matter OF an inter-Oceanic canal at Darien to
the Committee OH Commerce. He thought that
was subject Tor the Committee Oh Foreign
Affairs.


| Mr.. Schenck said that was matter that had
been considered when the resolutions were pre-
pared. and it was determined to refer interna-
tiOnal postal matters, they wO uld be affected.
by the canal. to the Foreign Affairs Committee
but as the construction of the canal was clearly
matter OF commercial interest the Committee
Oh Commerce was deemed the appropriate COM
mittce.


Mr.. Lynch (AIe.) argued that the Select Com
mittee OH Navigation was the proper one TO con-
slider the subject.


Mr. Wood insisted that the Foreign Affair.
Committee was the proper one to consider Il
matter, as he did not see how anything cOuldbe
done until treaty was framed. and that would
deyOlye upon the Foreign Affairs Committee.
After some further discussion the resolution
was adopted as originally reported.

From information received here a most unparal-


eled ana awless state OF affairs exists In the
ties OF Wilkes, Alexander and Buncombc, In the
mountain region to the west OF this Murders and
outrages Of most atrocious nature are of almost
daily occurrence and 1t would that the exist


ing civil authorities are poweriess to suppress this
fearful cpidemc OF crime.


on saturday last In wilkes county two desperate
characters respectively named Joshua steelman and
Larkln Lynch, while ut the house OF one Noah


Sprinkle. twelve miles east of wikesboro the county
seat, became involved In quarrel. which grew
violent and both were ordered out OF the house.
After leaving they had proceeded but short DIS

tol and fired i've times successfully at Lynch. the


latter fighting desperately with such weapons as he


took effect IN the abdomen OF Lynch, one passing


entirely through him and the third entering The lett


lung coming out at the back. Lynch fell and Steel


soon after expired. Steelman made his escape.


This bloody tragedy. however. is far exceeded in


horror and barbarty by the inhuman ana dendish


murder OF sister by brother and afterwards the


murder OF the mother by the father and two sons OF


the same family. II seems that one OF the spurs

aiming several geese. A customer passing
~ offered TO purchase pair Of chickens,

holding In his hand large roll OF bank

woman would take for the entire lot. The
price was named when the party at once re-
sponded that he would take them all Mt the

A colored boy standing by with a push
cart was called, aud while the market woman
was still bewildcred at what she supposed
her very good fortune, her purchaser
placed the coop containing the chickens on
she cart, informing the dealer that he would
return In few moments, take the geese and
pay for the entire lot. Several hours passed
away, and the market woman patiently
awaited the return Of her customer, refusing
TO sell the geese on account Of the bargain
previously made. Finally the hour for clos
ing the market came, but the customer did
not make his appearance TO claim the geese,
and the woman was at last convinced by the
other dealers that she had bcen made the
victim Of q swindler, who had adopted the
plan mentioned above TO obtain the coop
Of chickens without paying for them. No

more to this city, carrying her children upon
her back, and applied to the Mayor to furnish
her transportation to the city Of Richmond,
where, she asserted, her brother resided.
Mr.. Bowen caused thorough investigation
In her case, and nscertained that her story
was untruthful, and that she Is not the
mother Of the children, and instead Of com.
ing from Baltimore, she is an old resident OF
Washington and frequent occupant of the
poor-house, her committal being always
caused by dissipation.

MEETING OF CoNGREss-sCENEs IN AND


ABOUT THE Capitol.


To the Editor Of the Press:


Though gloomy and cold, wet and disagree
able out of doors to-day, in the capitol, every-
thing appeared pleasant. The attendance
was large; nearly all the members being pres-
ent. In the Senate Mr.. Sumner seemed more
than usual the central figure in that cham
Der. MIR. Fessenden's death has left him the
real leader of that body, as John Sherman,
with all his activity and practical sagacity
cannot dispute the supremacy, as Mr.. Fessen-
den did by his presence alone The Massa-
chusetts Senator was welcomed with much
more apparent cordiality that of old. Mr.. Nor
rill was received with great cordiality, and
Mr.. Hamlin was pleasantly greeted. Conk-
ling looked handsomer than ever; Senator
Edmunds, Ferry, his colleague, Buckingham.
with his handsome splended ripe old man air.
eyes jolly and genial as ever, with fun twink
ling in every look or lurking in every motion
of his features; Cameron, white-haired and
withered, but looking as if full of juice vet,
provided one bit deep enough. Henry Will
son as pleasant, alert, and more rotund than
ever; Sprague, looking fresher and more boy-
ish than usual; Trumbull with his keen. nery
Gus expression, the very image of special
pleader, believing himself jurist, while the
other Rhode Islander, Anthony, appears to
have paid special regards to his good looks
during the past summer these and the 9TH
ers made up body of specially fine looking
men, dignified, striking, were qualified to look
it not to act the Senators. Most of them are
that also: Size goes for good deal in the
battle Of life; good looks for much, and the
capacity for appearing dignifed at least counts
in heavily. never see the United States
Senate together but am convinced of these
things. Garret Davis, for instance, has much
more ability than many who, even of his own
party, are able to get and hold the attention
of the Chamber. He lacks presence however.
Pomeroy and Ramsey dont do that, neither
OF them. But they are not Over-proyided
otherwise. This is all aside. There was
very cordial feeling apparent and good tone
pervaded the atmosphere. The message was
receivad with evident marks of approval, and
several points as that of Georgia, excited au-
dible approval. Senator Morton offered a
Dill TO carry out the suggestions of that mes
sage in that particular, which was put upon
its passage. =.


GEoRGIA-WHERE 1T STANDS.


There is still question as to the exact re-
quirements the President proposes. When
ever it has been proposed to require the test
oath OF persons elected to State Legislature
unoer the reconstruction acts, the decision
has always been that the only oath that could
be administered was the one required by the
constitution under which they were to act
Representatives Boutwell,, Paine and j. T.
wilson took that ground in their famous dis
patch about the Louisiana case Gen, Canby
decided the same way in the cases of North
and South Carolina. Gen. Grant himself in
the case of Florida and Of Georgia., directed
Gen. Meade not to require the test oath in
the case of the Legislatures. At later day
Congress passed supplemental act, applying
certain other rules to the States of Virginia.
Texas and Mississippi. Gen. Candy took the
ground that by this additional act the test
oath was required. The Attorney-General
however took the opposite view, so far as the
Legislature is concerned. The question there
is, what oath is to be administered? Doctors
disagree. 1t would seem plain that the test
oath is meant by the President, but his At
torney- General says ""no such thing is in the
law"" The present members of the Georgia
Legislature have all taken the oath required
by their State Constitution. A good many
have perjured themselves under it. But who
Is Is 10 decide what test they are to meet. Let
Congress fix it securely this time


SCENES IN THE HOUSE.


Members gathered early, and in large num-
bers. Different ones could be seen serving as
rallying points around which gatherings were
made. Here was Butler, looming largely in
person and mentality. He grows corpulent,
and with that great bald head-the very pic
ture OF bald eagle-ills large space and at
Schenck was near by and had a large group
about him. He has travelled this summer
put still retains the same old mastiff look
the heavy-set under jaw making one not at
all anxious for an encounter. There was the
nervous Bingham, retailing his
sharp answers, with all that querulous impa-
tlence which detracts so much from his in
fuence.


Your Maine members were all present.
MI: Peters looking pleasant, self-contented
ana anabie, Speaker Blaine important, but
anxious to know and be known of everybody
even to the extent Of taking especial care
of the anthracite coal and the annexation
questions together. Mr.. Lynch was early in
his seat, examining papers and preparing for
work, among the busiest, quietest and most
faithful men in the House.


Among the Democrats, Mr.. Cox seemed to
be the most popular. Some Jokes were at
tempted about his European tour and espec-
tally as to the Spanish part. He was often
asked j ne had brought castle back with
him. VOORHEES, of Indiana, was next in i'm
portance. OF course Brooks was well receiv-
I'd. There is an evident feeling of confidence
n the breasts of the minority, who when the
Democratic members from the South get in.
will be greatly strengthened. Some among
'hem are confident of seventy-two. They
will fight earnestly, foreign policy, Cuba &c.,5
nance, greenbacks, and reduction of taxa
ion are their cues. The reception of the
Message in the House was peculiar. Georgia
gave an outburst of applause. The financial
part seemed ito be mixed while there was a
decided surprise manifested when the yery
Ftshy paragraphs on Cuba were read.


The reference to the neglect of our COM
nercial and navigation interests was unex-
whole the message is regarded as a good
Moderate, well-written State paper, which
contains sensible middle opinions on most

voting it down by a majority of nine. The Senators
mostly based their opposition on the point that it
would be inappropriate and undgnifed TO use the
Capitol for such purposes. Mr. Fessenden seemed to
regard il as understandable that there should be
anv opposition from the Republicans, especially as
the two Democratic members of the Committee on
Public Buildings and Grounds, MessTs. Whyte and
Davis, had cheeTfully given their assent. Mr.. Pom
eroy gave notice that he wculd ask for an Executive

bill in a brief speech but Washburne and Price
fercey attacked the proposition, saying the Govern
ment had already sQuandered several millions on
this piece Of worthless land and it proposed
to burden the Treasury with an expense of several
hundred thousands of dollars year to keep up the
show of Government among the icebergs and Es-
quimaux. The bill was killed by twO-thIrds vote
without a call Of the yeas and nays. Lynch's bill
proposing plan for resumption Of specie payments
was postponed till Saturday next, owing to the i'll
ness of Mr.. Lynch. Mr. Burt Van Horn made a
speech advocating the Niagara ship canal and Mr..
Sidney Clark a speech denOuncing the Usage treaty
swindle, now pending in the Senate.


Senator Morrill, returned here this evening from
Maine. He says the Senatorial question in his State
is by no means settled. His friends insist that there
was no choice in the caucus and he and Hamlin
must go before the Legislature and there settle the
matter. The business of the Appropriation Commit
tee. Of which he is Chairman, has accumulated so
rapidly that he was compelled to return.
very curious petition was presented TO the SEN
ate to-day by Mr.. Sumner The memorialist, Mahlon
Looms Of this city claims to have discovered and in
vented a new system Of teegaphing, by which cable
wires and batteries may be dispensed with alto
gether and desires the Of $4,000 to complete his
experiments. Mr.. Sumner thought it was either
moonshine or very important, and several Senators
seeming disposed to throw ridicue upon the matter
Mr. Wilson thought it was better not to sneer Just
yet. Some of the greatest men of the country had
laughed when the magnetic telegraph was first sug-
gested but the laugh now on the other side of
the mouth.

The shipbuilding Interest i'm Congress.


The Democratic papers make serious
charge against the gentlemen who represent
Maine in Congress, when they allege, as they
do every time the topic is discussed, that thet
decline in shipbuilding, one of the most impor-
tant of our industries is due in large measure
to the neglect of our Senators and Represen-
tatiyes to give the matter sufficient attention
The shipbuilders themselves have given coun-
tenance to these allegations by seeming to ig-
more the efforts of our Congressman in their
behalf andiexhibiting feeling OF dissatsiac-
ion with what has been done or appearing not
to be conscious that anything has been done.
We have been moved to investigate this mat
ter somewhat with view to determine wheth-
er the men to whom the people have entrust-
ed the care of their interests are SO recreant to
their duty and deserve the lash that is SO vig-
orously applied.


The specific thing that our shipbuilders re-
quire Congress to do in order to secure 10
them an opportunity to compete with some
chance of success with foreign builders, is to
allow drawback on imported material enter
ing into the construction of vessels (iron, cord
age, sheathing &c., equal to the amount of
duty levied on the same. That, on the whole,
appears to be the surest and most practicable
means of stimulating this prostrate branch Of
industry and raising the United States once
more to its normal position as leading mari
time nation. To support the charge against
our Congressman it is necessary to show that
two questions can be properly answered in
the negative: Did they devise this scheme !?
Have they faithfully kept it before the body to
which they belong, supporting it as occasion
offered by suitable arguments and by forci-
Bile presentation of the facts in the case?


The record shows that both these questions
must be answered. in the affirmative. The
scheme for allowance of drawbacks originated
in Congress, and the record of single mem
Der, Mr.. Lynch of this district, will show how
faithfully the subject has been followed up
from session to session. At the first session of
the 39th Congress Mr.. Lynch introduced res
olutions, called the attention of Congress to
the decline in cur commercial marine, and a
bal providing for the allowance of drassbacks
on shipbuilding material. Up to that time
there had not been shipbuilders or shipown-
ers' convention held within the limits of the
United States, nor had any memorial been ad
dressed to Congress on the matter embodied
in the resolutions and bill introduced by our
Representative. Immediately Gttercdrds how
ever, and it would seem, in response to the ef-
fort put forth at Washington, convention
was held at Au yusta and delegates were sent
from that body to the Capital to spur up our
delinquent"" representatives there. At the
same time memorials were poured in from
Maine, New York, Pennsylvania and other
parts of the country, beseeching Congress to
take measures to prevent the utter annihila-
ton of American commerce. AT every subse-
quent session of Congress till the present, Mr.
Lynch has had the subject referred to the ap-
propriate standing committee, but without fa-
vorable results. Abandoning that plan he has
now secured the appointment of special COM
mittee of nine (and strong one) of which he





thoroughly investigating the causes of the de-
cay of American shipping and reporting to the
House an appropriate remedy.


EIn giving this resume of the efforts of the
Representative from the first district in behalf
of our shipping inte rest, having as in duty
bound watched him more narrowly than the
rest, we desire to detract nothing from the
value of the services of the other members of
the Maine delegation. We believe they have
all, both Senators, and Representatives, had
the interests of their constituents at heart and
have proved their faith by their works.


That the efforts of New England Congress
men in this direction have failed, is we have al
ways believed, susceptible Of an easy explain
alton. The allowance of drawbacks would be
an act of generosity on the part of the South
and West of which those sections of the coun-
try are not capable, and of which they cannot
fairly be expected to be capable. Protection
is the policy which our rulers in their wisdom
have established as one which is calculated to
insure, ON the whole the best results to the
whole country. Special interests must suffer
in consequence-and many people suppose
that all interests suffer. Waving the general
question of the utility of the protectionst poll
cy, it is clear that those who oppose it are able
to adduce specious arguments against the COM
plications and the confusion resulting from an
attempt to relieve particular branches of in
dustry from the necessary results of that poll
cy. To demand either for bounties or draw
backs as an indemnity for the pressure of the
tariff upon any class, they reply that these
classes must take their chances with the rest,
and that relief must be sought through radi-
cal modification Of our financial policy. 1t is
true that conclusive answer to these repre-
sentations is afforded by the fact that the COM
merce of the country is intimately connected
with the prosperity OF all classes, and that it
suffers from the high tariff in an exceptional
degree. But the answer is not needed BY
those whose jealousy and local prejudices are
excited and who suppose themselves adversely
interested.


Though not entirely germane to the special
phase of the subject we have just considered,
the suggestions contained in the following ex-
tract from an article in the last number of the
Galaxy from the pen OF Admiral d. d. Porter,
will be found of interest Steam navigation is
the subject he has particularly in view, and his
idea of buying foreign vessels may yet be ac-
cepted, if Congress cannot by any means be
induced to give shipbuilders such relief as will
enable us to build them ourselves:


We should commence now to prepare for the
great commercial struggle that is to come aid
our government should at once hold out in
ducements to our merchants to start new lines
Congress ought even (for the present) to with
draw the restrictions with regard to buying
foreign vessels, and let us purchase the fastest
and best steamers that can be built en- the
Clyde, sinee owing to the high duties impos-
ed on articles used in shipbuilding, it is i'm
possible for us to compete with foreign ship
constructors in building either steamer or sail
ing vessels. The steamers now run by the
French are English built and of superior con-
struction to the old style of vessels Why,
then, should we not adopt the same class Of
vessels and drive both French and English
from the track?


1t may be selfish consideration to wish to
deprive our neighbors of a share of the profits
OF the carrying trade, when there are appar-
ently enough for all but as this trade OF right
belongs to US we should never allow such re-
fection to be cast upon our enterprise as to
permit any other nation to snatch the rich
prize from our grasp


line power OF nation is measured bv its
commercial prosperity, as NAV he illustrated
by that little iron-bound island Enoland
which dictates laws to the maritime y1orld
and constantly holds the balance of trade
against all other nations. As a military ,o,uD
err she is respected by all the world ana poMo wv
holds, commercially, the same position tbot
we could hold if we would take ADVANTAGE of
the opportunities that are and will be thrown
in our way.

lected that the sound of the ship-carpenter's"

according 10 the BGliAt0re american, is PLAYED as

in the shop the boys overheard conversation,
the purport of which was, the boys were to be
drugged and while in an unconscious state were
TO be conveyed on board of a vessel that was
ready TO depart on a foreign cruise. The boys,
feeling satisfied that they had been deceived as

But not alone. Their Washington employer
followed them, and when he reached the depot
he called uron policeman to arrest the boys,
stating that they we're abscOnding seamen, and
had signed papers with q sea captain obliging
themselves to sail at a certain day. and. more
over, that they had been paid a portion of their
ingtonians, but the officer deemed it best to per-
NIT Justice Bone to settle the question. At the

acres, and has every variety of machinery con-
nected with making iron and building ships.
When in full blast they took in pig iron and
out of it made iron-clad ships of war. But it
has been outstripped by its more thrifty COM
petitors on the Clyde. The iron-clad monster
steamer northumberland"" was its last vessel.


1 am sorry to say it, but the truth is, am
becoming persuaded that my efforts in Con-
gress to have ship materials admitted free of
duty, if successful would not.have accomplish
ed my purpose of restoring the old supremacy
of the Maine chip. She has had her day
Painful as is the conclusion, there is no avoid
ing it that the wooden sailing ship is a thing
of the past The man who invented the screw
propeller gave the fatal blow. The advantage
of the screw over the side-wheel in economy of
fuel and in capacity for slowing cargo, although
not great-'not so deep as well nor so wide
as church DOORS enough to do the busl-
ness for us and drive us off the ocean. And
then the screws are full rugged and can help
themselves along by canvass almost as well as
cur ships. M


Mr.. Lynch's committee should take steam at
New York and come over to London. They
would then find out what the matter is with
u.s. They would see ON the way some of the
hundred steamers between New York and
Europe--steamers averaging perhaps two
thousand tons, and each Of them doing the
work of sailing vessel four times its tonnage,
thus practically running up an enormous ag-
gregate. I notice that one of the lnman line
last month made the round trip from Liver
pool to New York and back in twenty-four
days. These steamers are carrying almost all
of the four hundred thousand emigrants who
go to America this year, and have possessed
themselves of about the whole of the North
Atlantic carrying trade.


Statistics are excellent. have taken pains
to make myself familiar for years rast with
the figures connected with shipping. But go
ing round among these rivals of ours gives me
new ideas of their power. Here they not only
do foreign business by steam, but the coasiing
trade is falling into the same hands. Our
well-informed Consul, Mr.. Morse, tells me
that Goals from Newcastle are brought round


to London by steam. Will not the same thing
be duplicated with us, and the Pennsy lyania
anthracite come to us in New England by pro-
pellers? And is the lumber trade entirely
safe from their grasp?


| As things 60 we must resign the ocean to
| foreign steamers. The English pirates drove
us off during the war and now these steam de-


mons prevent our getting back. 1t has been
| all along supposed that sailing vessels must


take the low priced freights such as coal, lime


and the like, but it is not so, Iron goes over to


us in propellers and they have for some time


been bringing our cotton into Liverpool. The
| Mediterranean fruit trade has gone in good
degree into the hands of the English propel-
lers and the same dirty craft is making its
| way into the West Indies and South America.


HOW SHALL WE RESTORE OUR COMMERCIAL
| SUPERIORITY.


What shall be done? 1t is necessary to pre-
sent full diagnosis of the disease, bat equally


essential to give the remedy. 1t is clear that it
| is no use to toriG against it. We cannot, if we
would, revive the old system OF differential du-


ties Our fight against steam, foreign and do


mestic, with sails is too much like putting
pack horses and stage coaches into the lists
against rail cars. 'sThe spirit of the age -
whatever that may be,--demands rapidity and
certainty and of course steam answers the pur-
| pose better than the tickle winds.


But we in Maine must not be behind hand.
| 1t is no use to moan or grumble These
worn out governments and stationary COM
munties must not be allowed always to rule
the seas and Maine must see to it that they do
| not. But in order to compass this we must not
whimper about the loss of wooden sail vessels


Let them go. Get something better. We
shall be distanced in the great sDerby'' of the
| ocean if we stick to sails. Sails are pretty and
poetical but steam is the stuff to rule the
ocean with. could mourn over the decay of
that thing of beauty, the marine ship, as l
wosr1R a.ss~zss~-----.-a
but this competing for the control of the
ocean is no mere matter of sentiment. Black
clouds OF smoke from unsightly chimneys are
to be the embems of power on the ocean
hereafter, ugly and mighty.


If war should come on refusal to meet our
just demands for indemnity for the piratical
cruisers it would restore our maritime superior

steam.-and we should undoubtedly end the
war by the annexation of the Provinces and not
impossibly add so much to the English debt
and cripple English manufacturers SO badly
as to endanger the permanence of an aristo-
cratic government whose prerogatives will not
bear the criticism, excited by popular suffer-
ing and discomfort.


But war involves sacrifices, taxation and
distress which our own people are in no mood
to think of, till the strain of their resentment
rises much higher than it has yet for such
by-gone affronts as the Alabama's depreda-
tions. But it would do the job. And in the
present position of parties here and the tenn
per of the people, it would not be difficult 10
get up a war if we wanted to. L find them
more .fghtish than supposed.


CONGRESS MUST LEGIsLATE so AS TO ENcOUR-


AGE THE BUILDING OF AMERICAN


MERCHANT STEAMSHIPS.


Let Congress give us cheap iron and coal
and after awhile we can do the rest. 1t would
be a slower process than the other, but we
should work it out But cheap iron and coal
we must have. They are the only two ele-
ments of English superiority. Mr.. Gladstone
reckons that in hundred years England will
lose her coal advantage, but we cannot afford
to wait for that. We want the Nova Scotia
and Cape Breton coal and the English iron.
With them and cheaper food and greater nae
chanical ingenuity - as the Patent Office
shows-we should work up an opposition, but
it would take time. And of course Congress
will repeal the copper outrage of last session.


Much more might be said, but / did not set
down to write a letter ON political economy or
the tariff. 1t provoked me to be obliged to
come across the Atlantic under the British
fag-or rather that there was no steamer fly
ing our flag that could be had-and when
got here to see the British superiority on the
ocean so well established and SO rapidly ex-
tending ITSELF War OF course would be horri-
BILE, and not the least SO because its evil effects
would fall most severely upon our friends
The operatives in Yorkshire and Lancashire
deprived of both supply of cotton and market
for manufactured goods in the United States,
would suffer more severely than anybody e'se
in England by an American war, while the
landed proprietors by the enhanced price of
food would rather be gamers by it. And we
recollect how heroically the workmen stood by
us, under the lead of John Bright, although
starving, wnile the aristocratic land owners"

Novel Scene at the White House-Negroes


Advising the President in Regard TO the Dis


tributiOn of Offices.


This afternoon the National Executive Committee
OF the colored men of the United States appointed
by the convention held in washington in January
last waited the President pay their respects to
him and to present to him an address, signed by
George G. Downing, OF Rhode Island, president;
F. G. Barbados, OF Massachusetts,; Sella Martin,
Of New York; William ]. Wilson, OF New
Jersey, and George L. Matson, of North
Carolina, local committee. 1t s set forth that they
gladly took advantage Of a statement published by
trustworthy newspapers Of the republican party to
seek the interview; that the statement was to the
effect that the President intended to appoint the
Northern States to important positions such colored
men could discharge the duties with profit and
honor to the public service. Knowing this
reported intention to be eminently In
keeping with the record OF his administra-
ton. they thought that a few suggestions
made by those familiar with the North might lend
some support to the policy indicated. Among other
things they say the colored men Of the North have
already furnished such proofs Of manhood as TO
have left the question Of fitness for oice out Of the
arena Of mere experiment. They are assured the
appointment of competent and trustworthy colored
men to prominent positions in the Northern States
would give a deathblow to objections to their
holding Of such positions in the South. by con-
vincing the South that 1t is not true the
North wishes to force policy upon them which it
is not willing to accept ITSELF II negroes elected
to important places by the general government In
Rhode Island the problem OF negro of1ce-holding
becomes easy OF solution IN Georgia. Then, too
they think that II IN the Northern States where ne
groes are numerically weak, they are permitted to
enjoy some Of the honors Of citizenship with their
white fellow citizens their brethren in the South
where they are numerically strong, would the more
willingly share their political immunities with their
white fellow citizens, and the whole race would be
strengthened in its patriotism by the knowledge
that the negroes no longer regarded as a sepa-
rate class in politics. The address concluded as
follows:-


Our rights as men were recognized by Mr.. Lincoln,
and we are filled with all gratitude for the fact but
w tb9t Of mere sense n9 grst,tda hsnsa adueu 9e
have appointed members Of our race to important
positions, and thus given rebuke to vulgar
prejudice against class. In this you have gone far
beyonu our late lamented President, for while under
the necessities OF war, he made the nation ours by
calling on us TO its defence, you, under the calm in


uence OF peace, have given TO the nation by lif
ing our race into the enjoyment OF its immunites.


The interview is represented pleasant, and that
the President replied in substance that the subject
involved important points, and he would, therefore,
give TO it due consideration.

The Sale Of Tobacco Stamps by Others Than

Acting Commissioner Douglas has written letter
10 the Collector at Henderson, N c., in reply to

the arrest OF one Of them for selling fraudulent to-

claimed TO be and genuine government

rect terms prohibit the sale OF stamps by persons
other than collectors or the purchase OF such stamps
from persons other than collectors. II was. how.
ever, clearly the intention Of Congress to limit the
sale and purchase Of tobacco stamps to and from
collector OF internal revenue. The Commissioner
according to the provisions Of the law isauthorIzed
TO furnish stamps only to collectors, and they are
the only persons authorized to sell stamps. The
sale OF stamps by any other person IL an un-
authorized sale, and even collectors are
restricted in their sales. They cannot sell

Mr.. GurIER's RESOLUTION or PROTEST.


The House then at two O'Clock, resumed the con-
sderation OF Mr. Buffers privileged question pro-
orders Of the President OF the Senate pro tenn. in
counting the vote OF Georgia In obedience TO the
order Of the Senate only and IN dissolvng tne ioint
convention OF the two houses at his own VIII, as an
invasion OF the rights and privileges OF the House.
Mr. Dawes, OF Mass, occupied the chair as Speaker
pro tenn.


Mr.. BENTON, rep.) Of N. H., having three minutes
allowed him, proceeded TO conclude the remarks
when ne nad commenced at the close OF yesterdays
morning session IN advocacy OF the resolution.


Mr.. WOODBRIDGE, (rep) Of Vt. having eight
minutes allowed him. argued that in counting the
electoral votes the House OF Representatives was
not mere cipher; but mad rights TO sustain and
duties to performs; and also that the decision OF the
presiding officer was correct IN ordering the tel!ers
10 proceed with the count.


Mr., LOGAN rep.) OF ILL.,. said he should not at
tempt to go over the questions discussed by the
various gentlemen who had preceded him IN the de-
BATE He was IN favor OF having the rule governing the
count OF the electoral votes made clear andhstnct
He was opposed TO the adoption Of the resolution,
because he held that there was no intentional viola
tton Of the rule on the part OF the presiding officer.
He agreed with Mr.. Woodbridge that the error
mitted by the presiding oicer was IN receiving the
objections OF the gentleman from Massachusetts In
the first place. lie would vote for any resolu-
ton that would contain the slightest sting or renec-
ton the brave and patriotic Senator from Ohio.
and he purposed submitting resolution To lay II on
the table. SO far as the conduct which had been
characterized as dlsgraceful was concerned, he had
naught to say. lie was sorry 10 witness the scene;
II was an exciting moment. There might be some
excuse paliation for OF the conduct tnat
witnessed. He did not participate In It, nor
did he sympathize with either side then nor
did he now VINO was y that the House
was asked TO censure? man sixty-nine years OF
age, the presiding officer OF the Senate the presid
ing oIilcer Of the Joint convention, a man who has
been thirty years In harness. man who stood In
the vanguard, the Old captain Of the Legion OF Lib
erty, on whose head Heaven has showered the
bouquets Of It's sunshine who stands to-day as the
great living monument Of this great age. The
House was asked 10 inflict sting upon that man be-
cause he had accidentally done wrong. Were mem
beFs reaoy to do that? We're they ready TO assign
10 ignominy man who had been born patriot,
had lived patriot and would die patriots Moth
Ing would give hum greater satisfaction .nan m to
lleve there was man in the House who could put
his hand on his heart and say that he was ready TO
censure Ben Wade IN the idea that he had acted
from any improper motive.


Mr.. BUTLER. (rep.) OF Mass never did say that.
i never shall.


MIR. LoGAN-Hence l say that ] should prefer to
see the resolution withdrawn


Mr.. BUrLER--I never have believed, and | do not
now believe that BenWade ever meant 10 do or ever
had done an intentional wrong; but do believe that
the privileges Of the House have been invaded.
That question has been discussed Il Is necessary to
have legislation SO tnat this will never happen
again. Waving all pride OF opinion and with dis
tlnct enunciation that never nave censured Ben
Wade or meant to censure him Tor any Intentional
act Of his but that his act acting under the Senate
acting under whatever influence he was, was an In
vason OF the privileges OF the House am ready to
withdraw the resolution and accept substitute
suggested by the gentleman from New York; Mr..
Kelsey.


Mr.. Kelsey's amendment was read, as follows:--


Resolved That the subject of the Of the join,
rules the OF the two FOR counting
the electoral votes for President and Vice President be
iered 10 select committee OF i've with power to report BY
bill or otherwise.


Messrs PRuYN, (dem.l Of \. Y, and MULLINS, trep)
Of Tenn had other substitutes which they desired to
offer; but Mr.. Logan declined to yield for that pur
pose.

legged question, and tat 1t was not germane TO the
original resolution.


The SPEAKER pro tenn. (Mr. .SDawes) overrued the
point OF order.

discussion of the subject would keep up disturbing
clement IN the House. He had concluded that the
discussion ard the excitement should cease lie be-
lieved that the proper way TO arrive at that result
was to have the resolutions and amendment laid on
the table resolution might then be offered and
the idea OF censure but looking merely 20 an amend

MEssRs. EDITORS :-It would be inferred
from an editorial in the Sentinel of the Goth
instant, headed ""War in iAlamance, that
no atrocities had been committed in the
county by armed mobs of men in disguise !;
or if outrages had been committed, it was
on persons who, by their criminal conduct,
had brought upon themselves merited pun
ishment. The purpose of the article is to
mislead the public, cover up and smooth
over the brutal deeds perpetrated on peace
able and unofending citizens ;aor the editor
is ignorant of the true condition of things in
the county. He has certainly heard of but
one instance of mob or lynch law having
been applied, the case of Squire Alston,
who he says was soundly fraicd for taking
undue liberties with respectable hite girl
fourteen years old, and that the war in,
Alamance"" will be found to be a tempest
in tea pot"" y isTa


The Sentinel forgets entirely that besides
the case Of Squire Alston, four colored men,
one woman and one white man, have been
lynched and beaten until their backs were
laid in deep and heavy gashes; and they, all,
except the woman and white man, hung up
by their necks until life was almost extinct
All this may be sport for the Sentinel and his
boys in white gowns and masks, and In the
estimation of the Sentinel and its friends,
'deseryedly proper treatment for negroes.
They should nevertheless remember
that those negroes are human beings
land that all are amenable to, and entitled
to the protection of the law. The editor of
the Sentinel does not assent to this, or he
would not have styled the Governor of the
State ""our turbulent Governor"" Why is
this course pursued by this journal, its sup
porters and advisers Would they have the
scenes of violence that have occurred in this
county within the last six weeks reenacted
Would they have the streets of our towns
and the highways of our country infested
with bands of men, disguised and masked,
committing and threatening violence, and
disturbing the general peace of our county {?
1t NUT have been known to the Sentinel
that at the hour of midnight Caswcll Holt
was taken from his bed, unmercifully beaten
and lashed with hckories, and then his
bleeding, lacerated back rubbed with a
rough stick. This was noticed in the STAN
DARD and condemned; aud was replied to
abiding Democratic representative from this
county, who justified the barbarous decd on
the ground that Caswell Holt had been
guilty of unconstitutionally approprlating
other peoples property to his own use.""'


The matter has been investigated. and
out of the reluctant mouths of his democra-
tic friends Caswell Holt established his
good character, and they were lnrccd to ad
nit on their oaths that he had not been
even suspected of stealing.


Now what do they say is the reason why
they thus beat him? The reply now is
that he bad insulted white lady by indie
Gently exposing his person. That was not
thought of the night they commit
ted the outrage; for while they bad the
poor negro tied, the only questions asked
were about the chickens, and the corn. But
in this case, us in tue case OF Alston, when
one of the masked miscreants had his head
and nose split open with an AK, and he and
his companions stand detected in their
crimes. it is denied that Steel's head was
split by Aston's wife.


Thus it happens that young man, not
twenty one, by the example and teachings
of the Sentinel and its friends, is brought to
grief And although Squire Alston's wife
acknowledges and insists that she struck
| young Steel with the AK; that she split lis
forehead open, and severed his nose, while
| he and his party OF K. KS were attempting
to take her husband out of the house, YET
| they will not believe her, and this, too, in
the face OF the fact that both Aston and
his wife were wounded by shots fired AT
| them hy the party after Steel was wounded
| with the AK, and the same surgeon vas sent
for the same night, about the same hour, tc
attend to the wounds of each party. The
woman says she cut Steel; that she is the
guilty person, yet the Sentinel and his
friends will not believe word ofit-but in
| sist that Steel was wayaid.


| Let me ask one question, hope it will bl
answered. What became OF the man that til,
wife OF Alstnn cut down and who was taker
out of Alstnn's house by his companions2 III,
was badly hurt for he bled freely; it showet
for itself the next day. Who was this man


What has become of him? Speak ou
and do not be afraid to tell the truth. rAnt
let us also know why your friends shot tn
man and his wife and attempted to burr
down his house, after they had succeeded il
thrashing him soundly."" as you have stated


The fact is, Aston was not thrashed bu
that he was not, he owes to the resolute arm
of his wife and her trusty axe, and the as
| sistance rendered by her son and neigh
boring negro staying over night wit
them If the woman did wound youn
Steel let the matter be investigated, and
not done in self defence, let the law be mete,
out fully and justly


Justice is all that law abiding citizens as
in ALAMANCE.

an U. S. Senator with an equal term of
rest, when what is usually yexed ques-
ton, does not disturb them. For instance,
n successor TO Mr.. Morrill, was chosen in
january SO, and successor to Mr.. Fes-
sen,len viii bc chosen in January II, and
the subsequent election will not occur un-
til January T5. 1t does not now look
probable that the Republican party will
experience any difficulty in having lack
Of candidates. BY common consent the
candidate is conceded to the western por-
ton of the State, although Messrs. Nor
rill and FcSsendcn both from the west, {. c..
west of the Kennebec river, have held the
two senatorial offices for the last eleven
years. We have heard the name of Mr..
Lynch mentioned, though 10y what author
ity we do not know, but ire very much
inclined 10 doubt that he has any aspira-
tions for the place rs against the present
incumbent. Gen. Shepley's name is spok-
cn of; but while brilliant senator he
would be, If elected, il is not improbable
that he may be appointed to the bench rs
successor to Chief Justice Appleton, and
that he will accept. Then. there is Mr..
Drummond (Josiah III who has friends
who would like to see him grace the Sem
atorial chair. 1t is well known that Mr..
FeSsenden Is n candidate for reelection,
who has many admirers at his own home
for his great legislative experience, and
who are disposed to overlook any heart
burnings ut his course on impeachment.


Passing from Portland we find ut Bruins
wick Joshua l.. Chamberlain, whose re-
luctance to serve in the Gubernatorial
chair for fourth term his friends were
desirous to overcome, that he might be
more prominently before the people when
the senatorial election should occur. They
will rely upon the fine military record of
our worthy Governor and his very marked
executive ability. At Augusta we find cx-
Gov. COny, ex-senator Morrill, and Speaker
Blaine. The first mentioned discharged
the duties of his Office through three
years of gubernatorial service and during
the war, with patriotic talent and discre-
ton. Mr.. Morrill, has hosts of friends
who rallied To his support last winter, and
came very near being successful, and who
would like to see him again in the Senate.
Speaker Blaine is among the youngest, If
not the youngest, of the prominent names
mentioned, yet perhaps rs widely known
as either.


Without doubt there are others able and
good who may have been talked of for the
senatorship. who would conquer their re-
luctance to serve the State for the general
good of the people; mt any rate no one
need worry lest we shall be obliged to Sc
lcct from list of one. II is easier to
prophesy who will not be successful than
who will; but even short time is often
fruitful of startling events and strange
combinations. and we with others can af-
ford to wait our predictions, assured that
he to whomSoeycr falls the task of going to
the Senate, will discharge his duties with
honor to the State and fidelity TO her in
tcrpStS."

THE AMBULANCE oRDER.-The recent order of
superintendent Kennedy. relative to the removal OF
sick and wounded persons to Bellevue Hospital
in the ambuances OF the Commissioners OF Charities
and Correction, is stl the bone OF contention IN
the force. Warden Brennan OF Bellevue Hospital,
yesterday called upon the Police Commissioners and
represented that out OF thirrysix persons sent to
that institution since the order issued the records
OF the hospital show but seven patients to be in





that the woman held as prisoner at the Fourteenth
precinct station house few nights ago. on the
charge OF petit larceny and who sent the hos
pita on the report OF DIR. Luther, police surgeon,
tnat she could not live If retained In the station
house was fegnin9 illness and was discharged next
morning. The Commissioners have learned that the
precinct surgeons make It practice when called
them to be sent to the hospital 10 avoid the trouble
OF personal attendance, and II is expected that I'm a
not at all gratifying TO them. The revelations made
yesterday by the warden OF Bellevue Hospital
seriously compromise the reputation OF more than
one OF the surgeons for medical ability and faithful
ness in the discharge OF their duties.


BOARD or FIRE UNDERwRITERs.-The New York
Board Of Fire Underwriters held a meeting OF No.
156 Broadway yesterday, for the purpose OF deter
mining whether the fire patrol shall be sustained FOR
two years, beginning on the 1st of July. and of AZ
ing the maximum amount of expenses which shall
be incurred therefor. Mr. Henry A. Oakley pre-
sided. There was large attendance OF insurance
men. The treasurer read his report from which 1t
appeared that daring the past two years the sum OF
siSs,SSo was raised and si5l 14e expended leaving
$4,000 In the treaSury Mr.. Conking, OF the Etna
Insurance Company, said that he thought the fire
patrol as at present constituted, ought not TO be
continued He believed II would be proper
for the Fire Department 10 assume the
duties heretofore performed by The fire
patrol. The speaker aaid that behalf OF his
company he would tako an appeal TO another tribu
nal, and patiently await decision, TO sec II the
Etna Insurance Company could be compelled TO pay
Its proportion OF the tax. 1ir. Conkng said that II
he gave his opinion on the subject 1t might ap-
pear dscourteous TO the Board. and he would there
fore simply record his vote against continuing the
patrol. A vote was then TAKEN and Dlnetyo com.
panies voted in favor OF sustaining the fire patrol
and i've against Three companies declined to vote.
Mr.. Hope said that the Finance and Patrol Commit.
tees OF the Board had made careful estimate OF the
expenses OF the patrol and recommended that
$4,000 be fixed upon as the maximum TO be ex.
pended during the ensuing two fesrs. A1er dis
cusston this sum was agreed upon and The Board
ad ourned"

might also get on the track Of their missing valu-
ables On q centre table in the examination room
were displayed the contents Of her trunk found at
the Ashland House. Diamond rings, expensive
shawis, laces, paras0ls and uncut dress patterns
made up the inventory Of articles exhibition. But
few OF the articles were identified by those present
but the owners undoubtedly will turn up in good
time. OnlceH McGOwan and McCarty, who traced
out the r0bberies to Mrs. Miller, have quantity Of
other goods at the Twenty-ninth precinct station

The proceedings yesterday before Justice Bowling
were brief, but OF comprehensive and important
character. First Mrs. A. Is. Salter, boarding at the
Coleman House, made an1davit OF the recent theft
from her rooms OF coral necklace valued at 1925.
coral pin and earrings OF the value OF $780, thread
lace shawl worth $685. laces collars, ribbons para
SOL &c. of the value Of $2O7 and charging Mrs Miller
with taking the same. Some Of the stolen articles
were on the exhibition table, and identified by MIS-.
to having stolen OF the articles specified IN the
aldavit, but did not confess to taking the whole OF
them.


Mr.. q. Cespedes, Cuban gentleman, whose wife
and sister were also present with him. made an afi
davt as to the theft from their rooms at the Ashland
Ave dollars, and twenty-five dollars in United
States silver coin. The ring was recovered
the ring. but denied taking the silver coin. Tnere
being further afldavIts Mrs. Miller was called up
for examination. Up TO this time she had kept her
to view her face, which she did with seeming great
reluctance She was plainly dressed in black, even
to black Kid gloves. In her modest-looking face.
mild blue eyes, and quiet, lady-like bearing one
could hardly believe her confessed thief In a
subdued and tremuous voice she answered the
questions put to her by the Judge as follows:--

O. How old are your A. Thirty-eight years.


9. Where were you bornf A; Louisiana ..,


Q. Where do you liver A. Ashland House, Fourth


@. What Is your occupations A. Widow.

the restitution in ny power, and | have given the
omcef the information which leads to the recovery


The case Of the alleged receivers was next taken
up. Mrs. John Lynch, who. with her husband keeps





bail in 1000 to appear for trial at the Court Of Gem
eral Sessions. MIR. Lynch gave bail in like amount
to the charge OF being one OF the receivers In
the case Of the Lord bond rObberies


It was shown that Mr. William Il. Keys had
nothing to do with the house OF Keys Judd, 600
Broadway but that Mr. Siias C. Keys was the part
ner Of Mr.. Judd They produced their books to show
regularity In their dealings with Mrs. Miller and
proper entry of the articles received from her and
the amount OF money loaned on them. Thus arti-
ces embracing two bracelets and long gold chain,
1t was said would be given up for the benefit Of
their owners. The Judge said that Mrs. Miller had
told him that she had sold them several diamonds,
OF which no account was now given. After listen
ing to statement from Mr.. Judd az to how he first
became acquainted with Mrs. Miller at a watering
place on Long Island, the Judge decided to hold
Mr.. s. c. Keys In 1000 bail to answer The charges
preferred against him. The bail was promptly given
and Mr.. Keys set at liberty. Mr.. Judd released.


Ohicer McCarty was ordered to take Mrs. Miller in
a carriage on search for some OF the stolen prop
erty after which she was to be remanded to prison.
The result OF the trip was the recovery by onicer
McCarty of thirty diamonds, which thus far have
not been accounted for. Mrs. Miller has taken hold
o. the restitution OF the stolen property with such
determined spirit to make good her promise In this
regard that there Is but little doubt that most of the
losers by her peculations will recover the bulk of
their valuabes Future affldavits and Developments
In the case well rs the arrest OF additional
cevers OF the stolen property are expected to-day."

he was unable to make the turn at the up-

the terrified horses shot away with the re-

and flondering down over three or four
more embankments and terraces, and
smashing through second fence, the team
got into High street near Taggart's resi-

JAsuART ., 1880,",,"diately Interested in them are preparing to
urge the adoption Of the new principle OF ex-
tending Government aid to those involved In
the bill OF Mr.. Window, OF Minnesota, to aid
in the construction OF the Northern Pacific
railroad, from Lake Superior to Pugets
Sound, which that gentleman introduced into
the House on the 10th instant. They thus
sbandon the policy OF direct money subsidies
or the issue Of Government bonds. Instead OF
requiring the issue Of United States bonds, as
heretofore, for which the Government has no |
security except q second mortgage and one |
half the compensation for Government trans |
portstion, this plan provides that the United |
States shall guarantee the payment OF inter |
est only, on limited amount Of the bonds Of
the company, not to exceed one half Of the es. |
timated cost Of the road; which bonds are |
proposed to be secured by q ntst mortgage on |
all Its property, to be made to the Secretary |
OF the Treasury Of the United States, the CON-
psny being required to pay both principal and
interest as they become due.
PROPOSED sRcuRiry TO THE GOVERNMENT.
To Indemnify the United States for such
guarantee OF the payment Of interest, the plan
provides that all compensation for the trans
portation OF troops, supplies, munitions Of
war, &C., shall be retained for the Government,
for which, along the line Of this contemplated
road, the Government 10 now alleged lin the
QusrtermasterG Generals reportl to be actually
paying an aggregate OF six millions Of dollars
| annually. This sum 10 much larger than the
| aggregate Of the proposed guarantee as add
tional security to the United states, the plan
provides that In case OF any deficiency, the
Secretary OF the Treasury 10 empowered At any
time to order one-third OF the gross earnings
, Of the road to be paid into the Treasury Of the
United States until all such deficiencies may
be made good.


SECURITY TO THE BospHoLpERs.


The plan further provides that In order to
secure the payment OF the principal Of these
bonds, the company 10 required, in addition to
the first mortgage aforementioned, to pay
into the United States Treasury two per cent.
OF the gross earnings Of the road, to be In
| vested as a sinking fund for their redemption
at maturity.


THE PLAN FtsDs MANY FRIENDS.


IbelIeve l state not only fairly, but fully,
this new plan for aiding In the construction
OF railroads In the brief synopsis OF It write
above. Ia view Of the very general disposi-
tIon manifested by those who are here seek
log Government aid to construct railroads TO
concentrate their Congressional friends upon
II, 1t becomes matter OF public importance.


WHAT is CLAIMED PoR 1T.


Its claimed for It that while II requires the
issue of no Government bonds, and does not
Increase the public debt-whieh Is a point by
no means positively settled-I Apprehend II
SO extends Government aid as TO ensure the
construction Of the work without danger OF
adding to the public burdens or OF hazsrdlng
the public credit.


| THE QUESTION NOT YET sRTTLED.


Your readers will please stick a pin just
here, as upon this fact the fight 10 destined
| to be made. 1.-THE friends OF the plan make II
plain that It secures the Government against
being called on to pay the interest on the
bonds, as they substantially allege, there can
be no doubt that Congress will adopt It not
only In the case OF the contemplated road 10
| which Dir. Window proposes to apply II, but
| to all others over which the United States
will be likely to require much military or
other transportation.

plvn, that 1t meets Gen. Grants appreciation,
which fact 10 urged by not few, to induce
its adoption by Congress with reference to all
the Pacific railroads now seeking Government
aid. know not on what authority II 10 SO
stated, whether 1t really does meet his sppro-
baton or not. That fact will, owing to Its
Importance, be thoroughly ascertained how.

NOT AN UNNECESSARY DOLLAR TO DE Afro

A man with half An eye eau now see pretty
clearly that Congress will appropriate less,
far less, money, for aught except the usual an
nual expenses OF the next fiscal year tn an ever
before oflate. TRUST that the retreneh ments in
this way will reach large agure-say twenty
or twenty-five millions In addition to the
twenty or twenty-five millions to be saved by
declining to vote more railroads subsidies in
the shape Of Government bonds.

The co ndition OF Congressional sentiment
and Congressional demonstrations in favor OF

that Government securities and Treasury notes

rency will rise rapidly towards par, much
faster than Wall street, the gold gamblers or

, VIRGINIA RECONSTRUCTION.
The House Reconstruction Committee had
up the Virginia question again to-day, re-
examining Messrs. whittlesey and Baldwin
and also a eolored citizen Of Lynchburg, Va,
whose name l did not learn. As radical
meeting at Richmond yesterday appointed a
new committee OF thirteen to attend here and
drum to defeat the proposition to strike out
the Objectionable features from the proposed
Virginia State constitution, l presume the
Virginia question will continue before the
House Reconstruction Committee for some
time TO come.


RRCoNsTRUCTIoN IN GEORGIA.


The action OF the House to-day on this sub.
Ject vindicates my assurance made to your
readers weeks ago, that Congress would surely
require OF Georgia proper guarantees for the
observance of the reconstruction laws and the
fourteenth amendment to the Constitution.
Under this action Of the House, Georgia will
be compelled, In some way, to undue all she
has done repugnAnt to those laws and that
amendment, including, of course, the restoTa.

unjustly and Illegally elected, and the expuL

solid and Gble summary of reasons for
abolishing Capital Punishment, published in
Putuam's Magasine for February. We hope
our present Legislature, and the people and
nress generally throughout this State at least,
will promptly give this matter the attention it
deserves, by striking from the statute-bOok
this lingering relic Of barbarism-the cool and
deliberate killing of criminals by officers OF the
law. The custom has its rise in the same low
estimate Of tho value of human LIE which
constitutes savagery itself as distinguished
from civilization. We must not lose sight of
the fact that Legislatures, Courts, and Sheriifs,
do not create justice; they only make law.
Eternal Justice, always mightier than the law
denies that those who are pOwerless to confer
life shall take it away, or that any combination
of men, or forms tpchniOalities of statutes,
or elections or human warrants, can confer on
one man, though he be styled a Sheriff, the
right TO take the life of another, whatever may
have been his crime 1t is still brother against
brother-Can against Abel--whatever judicial
forms precede the murder.


In the earlier and rude stages of society
there was a strong argument for taking human
life for great ofienses, because society was too
weak to restrain its criminals. Its lack OF
prisons. or of the means 10 make them eth-
cient compelled 1t either TO slaughter its
prisoners or to enslave them. But we have
such ample provisions for securing and reform
ing criminals that it is wholly unnecessary to
kill them. If we compare with our present
state the lack of prisons, jails, and the means
of taking care of prisoners in the nomadlc
life of the ancient Jews, we must perceive
that Capital Punishment, while necessary for
the defense of society then, is ruthless and
useless sacrifice of life now. The world has 80
outgrown the notion that punishment has some
merit or excellence in itself which demands Its
infiction, without regard to its utility, or that
Justice, when violated by the taking or one
life, can in some mysterious way be vlndlcated
by taking another, that it seems like recogniz-
ing the Inqusition as an existing evil to argue
against such phantasies. The wounds Of JUS
tice only bleed afresh when stanched with the
blood of those who infct them.


Judicial Killing tends directly and only TO
increase murder by individuals. Abolish the
gallows, and the most depraved are taught
new lesson Of the sacredness of life. Two CEN

The abolition Of Capital Punishment In Maine

not made violent crimes moro frequent there,

Lynch cannot even wait for lawful court and

which would require his attendance at a
public landsale on the following day.


Exacting promise that he would not
delay his visit longer than necessary, and
having given minute directions as to the
route, I continued my way homeward,
while he turned back.


I was about retiring to bed on the
night of my return, when summons from
without called me to the door. A stran-
ger asked shelter for himself and horse for
the night.


I invited him in. Though a stran-
ger, his face seemed not unfamiliar He
was probably one of the men I had seen
at the land Office, place, at that time,
very much frequented.


Offering him a seat, went to see his
horse. The poor animal, as well as
could see by the dim starlight, seemed to
have been hardly used His painting sides
bore witness of merciless riding, and a
tremulous shrinking, at the slightest touch
betokened recent fright.


On reentering the house, found the
stranger was not there. His absence ex-
cited no surprise; he would doubtless
soon return. 1t was little singular,
however, that he should have left his
watch lying on the table.


At the end of an hour, my guest not
returning, l went again to the stable,
thinking he might have found his way
thither to give his personal attention to
the wants of his horse.


Before going out, from mere force of
habit-for we were as yet uninfested by
either thieves or policemen--I took the
precaution of putting the strangers watch
in drawer in which I kept my own val
uables.


l found the horse as I had left him, and
gave him the food which he was now suffi-
GENTLY cooled to eat, but his master was
nowhere to be seen.


AS l approached the house crowd of
men on horseback dashed up, and l was
commanded, in no gentle tones, to
"" stand !"" In another moment | was in
the clutches of those who claimed me as
their prisoner""


I was too much stupifed at first to ask
what it all meant. did so at last, and
the explanation came, it was terrible!


My friend, with whom l had so lately
set out in company, had been found mur-
dered and robbed near the spot at which
l, but alone knew we had separated
| was the last person known to be with
him, and [ was now arrested on suspicion
of his murder.


A search of the promises was immedi-
ately instituted. The watch was found in
the draw in which 1 had placed it, and
was identified as the property of the MUIR
dered man. His horse, too, was found in
my stable, for the animal 1 had just put
there was none other. recognized him
myself when I saw him in the light.


What I said, 1 know not. My confu-
sion was taken as additional evidence.
And when, at length, | did command Ian
guage to give an Ineligible statement, it
was received with sneers of incredulity.


The mob spirit is inherent in man-at
least in crowds of men. 1t may not al
ways manifest itself in physical violence.
1t sometimes contents itself by lynching
a character. But whatever its form, it is
always relentless, pitiless, cruel.


AS the proofs of my guilt, one after an
other, came TO light, low mutterings grad
ually grew into iclamor for vengeance
and but for the irmness of one mon-4tha
officer who had me in CHARGE would
doubtless have paid the penalty of my
supposed offence on the spot.


1t was not sympathy for me that actu-
ated my protector. His heart was as hard
as his Office; but he represented the ma
iesty of the law, and took sort of grim
pride in the position.


AS much under the glance of his eye as
before the muzzle of his pistol, the cow
ardly clamorers drew back Perhaps |
they were not sufficiently numerous to
feel the full effect of that mysterious re-
lex influence which makes q crowd of |
men SO much worse and at times so much |
better, than any one of them sipgly.


At the end of some months my trial

alone knew they lied.


The absence of the jury was brief To

vas single hideous word but I had
ong anticipated it, and it made no i'm
preston.


As little impression was made by the
words of the judge which followed it and
lis solemn invocation that God might
laye that mercy upon me which man was
90 just to vouchsafe sounded like the hol-
owest of hollow mockeries.


''1t may be hard for the condemned

carried down l. street TO 18th ana thence % The
corner Of the alley where the polls were held,

This alley was literally packed with colo-ed
men as also the alley on the opposite side OF
the street, and hardly had Major Richard. left
the polls with Stewart when a voley Of stones

struck.


The mounted officers warned them 20 ae.ist
and charged upon the crowd, but quickly the
attack was recemmen ced.


At the corner OF X street the stones COM

all parties IN the ne,ghborhood. and the police
fred into the party engaged in throwing the
stones; but this seemed 10 enrage the crowd
who threw stones in larger quantities, ana
several pistols Were fired.


The officers realizing that prompt measures
should be taken TO put down the riot were
obliged to fire directly into the crowd, when
there was a general stampede, and the police
pursued the fugitives closely.


William Smith, colored, was badly eho. and
and IL was reported that he was killed. hat at
last accounts he was still living. He Was
among the foremost in the attack upon MAJOR
Richards, and struck the MAJOR several Sc
we're blows on the arm and head with
club and fired pistol at him within
two feet OF his head. Ii was q miracle that
MAJOR Richards was not killed. The widest
excitement prevailed after this firing; The
negroes cor ngregatng in masses, yelling with
rage against the police, and calling ont that this
policeman or THAI one was the one who killed
Smith.


Meantime the policemen, who behaved with
great self-possessiOn, moved mp and down
through the threatening crowd, preventing
anything like riotous demonstrations Nalor
Richards, though much niured, remained ON
the ground IN a carriage.


Another man named John Rohrer, WHO lives
on q ST., between IIth and tsth, received = shot
Just behind and under one eye which passed
through the skull out and above the opposite
ear.


An aged colored man, who was too old 10
take an active part IL the attack, received a
shot in the head, and was taken in charge by a
policeman.


Drs. Draper and stewart were on the ground
and attended to Rohrer, and with MIN pro-
ceeded 10 the freedmen's Hospital They ex-
press the opinion that he may possibly re.
cover, bat there is but little hope


After the riot IL was found that several Of the

a mans life is not safe, where the clergyman is
shot down as he performs the marriage sacra-

year, and should not go home Eow and leave
the country in that condition.


Mr.. Dawes inquired whether the Offices in
the unreconstructed States were not to be
filed by the commanding Generals and
whether it was no just as well to hold these
States under military rule as to bring them
into representation in the manner and under
the unfortunate circumstances that Georgia
had been brought in.


Mr.. Butler agreed that in the matter of
Georgia Congress had made haste slowly but
this was a question of life and death to the
Union men of the South. Who would not say
that an adjournment of Congress now would
be desertion of them and a turning of them
over to their enemies? Besides if Congress
were to adjourn now the Senate would remain
in session, as it did last spring. and the effect
then was that no sooner had the House turned
its back than Alaska was thrust upon the
country. He thought, therefore, that under all
the circumstances, it was tha duty of the
House to remain in session.


Mr.. Davies-And take care of the Senate?


Mr.. Butler-Take care of everybody that
the peoples interests require to be taken care
of No man frightens me by saying ""Take
care of the Senate"" | desire TO keep within
parliamentary language, and, therefore, say
we should take care of everybody that wants
taking care of (Laughter.) The power is put
in our hands. We, the representatives of the
people, are entrusted with it. We are paid
Tor doing it, and are false to our duty if we go
away from here day in advance of the time

Mr.. Lawrence replied to Mr.. Dawes, and
then moved the previous question on the adop-
ton of the resolution.


The previous question was not seconded and
the resolution was laid ON the table without
division.


Mr.. johnson moved to suspend the rules
that he might offer q resolution declaring that
in passing the 18th amendment to the Consti-
tuition the House never intended that Chinese
or Mongolans should become voters. Rules
not suspended-yeas AZ, nays 106-a strict

tions of Cornell and Merritt of course, offend the ex
peetant rivals. who talk about unfair play. Politi-
clans generally are pleased. They accept the NOM
nations as an omen that the new Admnistra-
tion is in full sympathy with the party and
that it will not overlook earnest political service in
making appointments. 1t is now conceded that it
was never intended to nominate Field or Latin or
GriswOld or Cochrane. Their homes were merely
used to secure the nomination of the real candid
ates, Cornell and Merrill.


In the Senate, to-day the Hon. VIM. I. Hamilton
of Maryland, who has heretOforeibeen detained from
his seat by illness, appeared and was sworn
in Mr. Patterson again introduced his bill looking
to greater efficiency and economy in the admnstra-
ton of our Consular and diplomatic service. Mr.. Ed
monds made an effort to get up the bill introduced
by him on the second day of the session; he desired
to correct the existing state of affairs in Georgia. ana
the matter was also urged by Mr.. Sumner; but the
Senate did not seem to appreciate its Importance,
and, at the instance of Mr.. Sherman, took up the
supplementary Currency act, which was debated at
much length, but no action reached The Eastern
Senators seem very much averse to having any bank
ing circulation withdrawn from their section but ex-
press willingness to vote for an increase of the cir
culaion to supply the wants of the West and South
Shortly after o'clock the Senate went into Execu-
tive session, and soon after adjourned.


The bill which passed the Senate two days ago. on
the recommendation of Secretary Boutwell,, giving
him authority to anticipate the interest on the Coy
ernment bonds, was under consideration to-day by
the House Ways and Means Committee Gen.
Schenck on an examination OF the subject. dlscoV-
cred that the Secretary has already full authority,
under existing laws to anticipate the interest, and
that there is no necessity for the legislation asked
for lie addressed letter to the Secretary inform
ing him of the fact, and pointing out the law giving
him the authority which the Senate bill confers The
Committee are therefore of the opinion that there is
no necessity for this additional legislation.


The House Committee on Banking and Currency
to-day had under consideration the Senate bill which
contains the provisions relating to the redemption of
the currency among the States and Territories. The
bill failed at the last session. owing TO the action OF
the House Managers in the interest of the Western
and Southern combinations insisting upon Columns
amendment and the Senate insisting upon the prop
ositiOn of their Finance Committee. The bill was
finally referred to a subcommittee, composed of
Messrs. Coburn Lynch. and Jones, for the purpose
of maturing bill to be reported at the next meeting
of the Committee.


The House Committee on Territories, at their
meeting to-day, had under consideration the ques-
ton of Territorial organization for Alaska. The
Committee decided to postpone this and all other
matters relating to territorial organizations until the
next session. The woman suffrage question, which
was referred to the Committee, was also postponed.


The bill which passed the Senate relating to the
seal fisheries of Alaska under consideration 10y
the House Commerce Committee to-day. The Chair
man of the Committee was authorized to report the
bill with an amendment increasing the tax on each
skin killed to 81 80.


The bill introduced by Senator Ramsey to estab
lish postal telegraph system throughout the United
States was again under consideration. to-day by tho
Senate Postal Committee. While the Committee
favor the scheme and will probably report it to the
House il is very doubtful if it be adopted at the
present session. $3.50


The Military Committee have agreed upon bill
extending the law for payment of private soldiers
at the rate of SIG per month until Aug So 1870 The
present law will expire Aug 20 of the present year,
and the pay of the enlisted men will go back to al
and Sl2 per month""; the rate before the war, unless
the bill is passed by Congress. The Committee
have also authorized their Chairman,
Gen. Logan, to report a bill authorizing
the Secretary OF War to purchase or lease buildings
in NewYork City to be used offices, storehouses,
quarters, &c., for the accommodation of the army
detachments and for other military purposes, pro-

Virginia Reconstruction-Closing Of Argu.


ments Before tho Committee.

sutatlon with the principal officers Of the Freed
mems Bureau, and the vagrancy law was copied
from that Of Pennsylvania. John Averett, q negro
from Lynchburg, addressed the committee in oppo-
sition to the Committee Of Nine. This closed the

ing.

The Senate Committee on Post Onices and Post
RDaossds had lively time This morning be-
tween two rival interests represented in
strong force and fighting the question whether
or not the Connections river should be bridged
over in two different places. The advocates Of the
bridging theory were all railroad men, one part
belonging to the air line and the other to the shore
line, and both extremely anxious to secure quick
and commodious connection across the inconvenient
obstacle OF the Connecticut river The opponents Of
the bridges were present In equally strong force,
Senator Dixon among them, declaiming very empha-
tically against the project to destroy, as It was
termed, the navigation OF the river. 70 impair its
beautiful proportions, ana otherwise do Damage
which no amount OF railroad convenience could
adequately compensate Finally the railroad men
triumphed. and the two bills were agreed to be
reported. with trining amendment that II the
bridges interfered with shipping Congress has the
right to see remedy applied.

PoRffAND AND DOVER IN FORMER TIMES.
To the Editor Of the Press:


This city has less business and social rela.
tions with your metropolis than might be de-
sirable as we'll as advantageous In the good
old days of stages, it was the grand centre of
much travel between Portland and Boston and
Portsmouth and the Notch. Dover traded
with Portland largely in West India goods
sugar, rum and molasses, but ""days are not as
they used to was"" and railroads have reyo-
lutionized trade as we'll as travel.


NEW CHANNELS.


Rochester ten miles north on the Dover and
Winnipeseogee road is destined to be the lary
est place in Eastern New Hampshire with the
ID. & w. and the Conway Great Falls and
South Berwick roads now communicating
with it and with the Portland s. Rochester ex-
tended to it and the Concord s. Rochester
and the .Nasua and Rochester roads con.
structed to that point, Rochester has indeed a
bright prospect.


Dover is sluggish. A few men control it
and they are interested in keeping out COM
pcting roads, but the irresistible course of
events will roll over them like Juggernaut
and crush them. If the Dover and Ports
mouth road was built, thereby giving us an
other line to Portland and Boston, freights
would be cheaper and this locality would be
far better in its inducements for the establish
ment of manufactures and business generally.
The tide from the sea comes up with the very

work of dredging and blasting"" and not as a
""political sinecure"" our harbor would be vast
ly improved. The dredges that have SO finely
cleared the channel in your harbor would
make quick and successful work in this river
and the new method of blasting would do the
same at what is known as the Gulf narrOws.

MR.. ABBOTT AND THE UNITARIAN CHURCH


The Unitarian church case that excited so
much interest last year, whereby E1-Rev. F.
E. Abbott and all like him were enjoined
from preaching in the Unitarian Christian
church, is still itemized in the papers and
mention made of the same kind of trouble at
Toledo Ohio, where said Abbott went to
preach. The following item is copied from
the Springfield Republican of Sept oath:
""Since the secession of the Toledo society, un-
der Mr.. F. E. Abbott, from the Unitarian de-
nomination, which we mentioned three
weeks ago. there has been slight reaction in
of 4 ,Io-ss ;,Ia
inst, vote was taken on motion to rescind
the seeding resolutions. The vote stood so
to nothing, the conservative voters, finding
themselves Outnumbered largely, left the
meeting and probably will establish separate
organization. On the 14th, Mr.. Abbott had
delivered an address upon Humboldt, which
was much admired by his German hearers
and will soon be:published."" The transmogre-
fication of the society at Toledo was brought
about the same way as that at Dover-the
power of majority created by the rallying of
the odds and ends, infidels, comeouters, i'd
o,'ne genus who never were bona fde men,
bers. Contrary to honor and justice legal
steps are being taken by the Unitarian Chris
tians of the society to have an injunction put
upon the Abbotites. Notoriety is as good to
some men as honorable reputation to others.
Abbott is an able man and fine scholar but
lacks modesty and humility. ..l... ........,


The Unitarian Society here are by degrees
their former thrift. Such clergymen |
as Rev. DIR. A. P. Peabody. Rev. DR.. r. steb-
bins, Rev. DR.. s. X. Lothrop, Rev. w. P. Til |
den. Rev. L. J. Livermore, Rev. w. H. Fish |
(Scituate, Mass.,) Rev. s. w. McDaniels, |
brighton, Mass, and ethers have preached |
here, and such sound talent to which mem
bers of other denominations rejoice to listen, |
is indeed refreshing to the SOUL"" The Soci- |
ETY. have raised more money the past year since |
Abbot and his followers left than anv year be- |
fore-a healthy sign. We allude to this mat
ter not in any UNCONVENTIONAL sense but be-
cause all denominations were and are interest |
ed in the Abbot case as effecting Christianity |
itself, Abbot having declared himself not a |
Christian. .,st-t..s- srr..

If the Company acted we'll. Altogether it was |
! pleasant episode in our dramatic experience |
n this great"" city. We understand that Miss |

RIO JANErRo, Sept. 2i 1s6o
Since / last wrote nothing further in the way OF
fighting has been reported from Paraguay, and the
allies gave up the pursuit upon the 22d OF August,
their horses being completely worn out by the heavy
forced marches through country whose bottoms
are series Of ponds, intersected with Doggy ground
which little trampling converts into depthless
mud hole. SO after the little affair on the 2lst OF
August In which the Argentine cavalry cut up 800 to
400 Paragsayans escorting baggage before they
could cross deep stream, the advanced troops OF
the allies fell back to Earaguatay, situated on a
tributary Of the Manduvira where the other pursu-
ing troops had stopped rest and to receive rations
No dispatches have been published as yet, or I
believe, received, but the government has issued the
following summary


According to arrangement the First army corps
moved from Pirayu on the night OF July 81, and the
Second army corps the morning OF the Sd. On
the oh was taken the entreachment guarding the
bush road of sapucaya, and two pieces of cannon.
On the 9th Inc enemy driven from the bush road
TO Vaenzuela, the key OF the Cordlleras On the
7th our army occupied this village without resist
ance. Near 1t was the mine whence Bopez got sui
phur and the plantation OF his mother. where all
the vauable3 OF The churches in Paraguay were
gathered up.


On the 10Th the army encamped in sight OF Pere-
bebuY. On the 18th this place was assaulted and
taken after few minutes OF stubborn struggle, in
which our infantry showed the greatest heroism.
The place was defended by 1000 men, all of whom,
without single exception fell into our arms, dead
or alive In that village were found large stores OF
victuas, including some OF the finest wines Of
Europe, some bullion much Brazilian paper money
and all the archives Of Lopez's government. Among
the papers contained in the great number OF boxes
holding the archives are the originals OF the treaties
made by Paraguay and curious documents regard
dctator Lopez.


The taking OF Percbebuy appears to have been
what caused Lopez TO abandon Ascurra as he left IT
on TIE 18th with all his army and passed the night
ittlo beyond CaacuDe, as became known when on


the morning OF the 10Th our armygot to that village.
IL was Immediately settled to pursue him py march
more mo or lie less "" parallel The ""' march % was So
n esmy ', ar "" @ aauS M Bsn Bsmesn he q ae as
corps of ours and was obliged to accept battle
at the place called Nnuguassau, or Great
prairie. THIS most stubborn struggle was With
the First army corps, commanded by General jose
Luiz Menna Barrctto, the visconde do Herval hav-
obliged to retire that same morning. In the end, by
three r. NJ, The enemy was completely beaten, and
he lett twenty-thfee cannon in our power.
The 18th was day of forced rest the troops not
having eaten during the fortyeght hours preceding.
General Pedra was slightly wounded with lance in
that day was estimated at 1000.


On the 18TH the Second army corps also annihi-
lated 1000 enemies who guarded, with ten pieces of
cannon, the bush road leading to Caraguatay. I'M
medatey after coming to this last point the pursuit
OF the enemy was continued by the Argentine army
and the Brazilian forces under General Jose Auto,
which, not having made the flank march, were III
the best condition. The enemy was pursued 10 the





800 killed and large quantity OF baggage, amid
which were found many articles OF Lopezis and
Mrs. Lynch's personal use, but eleven leagues OF
continuous swalnp5 and mudholes had entirely
worn out our horses, besides which the food tains
had not peen able to keep up with the march. IL
was necessary, therefore, halt and reserve the
rest OF the task for later operations


ddn de Losses sqefea py tne enemy apo not less ahan
1900 at the taking OF Perbebuy 1000 in the battle
tne iSo0 more IN the bs
sun. On the 18th tho six vessels of Lopez
which were beached near Caraguatay, In the
!aguy, were burned by the enemy on his retreat.
SiXty-one cannon were taken IN the month Of
August, without counting the heaviest ones, which
individually are buried at Ascurra, although they
have no5 yet been found, and twenty two other un-
finished ones got at tine arsenal OF CaacupA AT this
place the apparatus existed for the consru ction Of
all kinds OF arms and munitions, oil of which fen into
our power. The sulphur factory was aSokdesfroyed,
aud two saltpetre ones as well. The powder factory
is said TO be at san jose, eXpediton.has been
sent 10 take an account OF the place.


Besides these material losses the August opera
tons cave liberty to upwards of go Bra2iians, who
were in the power OF the dictator, 10 seventy Eu-
ropeans, almost all employed by him in his factories
Of material, and aSo to ParaTuayan population
OF not less than 100000 souls, who, rejoicing al
coming. have In most part travelled towards Asun-
con. Inc political chief OF san Jose at once sent a
letter placing hinsef and the people or his district
and OF that OF Aio5 at the disposition OF the alliance
and announcing that he had invited the authorities
of villa Rica, Caacupe and otner places TO do the
same.


The following extracts are from the Aagio-BrGzN-
ian Times OF yesterday


The allied loss ct the taking Of perlbebuy Is given
at 6a5 killed and wounded, NEUTRALITY-SUSPICIOUS., 81
and 97 wounded. Osorio aided In laying the planGs

There Is no mistake that the war is not over yet,

Last Saturday, S0th ult, it was again an
nounced by the same clan that IS eminent
speakers would address the people, and Jim.


Lynch, the carpet-bag negro from Pennsyl-


vania. was indicated as one OF the speakers.
Quite crowd of both white and colored
congregated. more from curiosity to see this
sable demagogue than otherwise. The coli
ored people had expressed desire on the
day previous, to have a champion of the
Conservatives meet Lynch that they might
hear the issues of the canvass understand
ingly. There being no speaker easy of
access, and the time too short to pro-
cure one from distance, so the idea was
abandoned, however, nothing was lost
Lynch arrived on Saturday but was very
much fatigued, ESQ we are charitable enough


to grant, for his eyes looked heavy. and it


was with difficulty that he could stand erect.
A physician present offered his services to


revive the dropping spirits of the sanity


Elder, and conducted him to an apothecary
shop near at hand when large black bottle


containing liquid extract of corn was
brought forth and freely imbibed by the
weary traveller who soon became talkatiye


and said hard things about the ex-parson.


Lynch had no confidence In him, and would


not trust him, and invited him to take voy-
age TO a climate much warmer than the


coming winter promises to be, (tolerably


strong language for Presiding Elder and
an aspirant for Secretary Of State.) MILL
saps indicated his intention TO adhere TO
the RAIDS, but would oppose Lynch.

Comments by The Tribune.


Our Southern brethren are difficult. For in
stance: Our correspondent who entered
Raleigh with Shcrman's army, was as moral
and decent a White man as lives; but no
White whom he found there would associate
with him-or, to speak moro strictly, dare associ-
ate with him. He went to a White church ::
but nobody offered him seat, and all seemed
to regard him as a disagreeable intruder.
Thus rebuffed, he tried q Black church, and
was there made welcome, and treated like the
Christian he is. Of course, being gentleman,
he thenceforth avoided those to whom his so
ciety was distasteful, and associated with those
who priced his company; and very soon he
was threatened with Lynch discipline for fra
ternizing with niggers! You see he could MT
please our brethren anyhow.


Ashburn, Aver, and Adkins, were all 1--WE
believe) Southrons, to the manor born,"" and,
being Republicans, were of course SCALA
""wagsn The White aristOcraCy would not
harbor nor countenance them. They lived
much among Blacks, because they could live
nowhere else and, rs Chivalry presumes that
Whites associate with Blacks only for lechery's
sake, they were stigmatzed accordingly. We
do not credit their calumniators.


The TImeS'S correspondent shows"" nothing
whatever; he simply asserts. Ashburn was
boarding with colored people when killed; he
could not help that. One of the very first
lawyers in Georgia-a native at that-in repair
ing last Fall to the shire town of neighbor-
ing county to try the causes in which hc was
engaged, was refused lodging at every public
house. There was 10 pretense of lack OF
room; but they would MT harbor scallawags.""
Not choosing to take refuge with Blacks, and
expose himself 10 such imputations as The
Times showers upon his murdered compatriOts,
he stated the fact to the Judge, who thereupon
ordered that all his cases should be continued
to the next term. We trust that since Grants
election he has been allowed 10 try them


1t may be that Aver was killed by negro,
as The Times asserts; but we await the proof.
That Ashbum and Adkins were killed for their
politics, and for nothing else, and that their
murderers are and will be screened from pun
ishment by tine great body of the Georgia
| Democracy. in whose service they risked their
lives, is clear. The libcls 10 which The Times
gives currency are part of the machinery en-
ployed for the purpose. The Times lends itself
to the nefarious conspiracy. After the evil
denoe adduced 10y Gen. Meades investigation ;
there can be no plausible pretense that Ashburn
was not killed for his politics; but he is only
hated the worse and lbolCd the more on that
account. We cannot help thinking that The
Times might better leave this line of business
TO The World, whose readers will enjoy it with
far keencr relish than will those of our
nanrer npigbhor"

had been pending for some time In regard to
certain charges made by Mr.. Duffey against
Mr.. Powell, a member Of this club.


Mr.. Long hoped that rs Mr.. D. was still
recognized as a member Of the club he would
be allowed to pay, and that the difficulty, II
any, would be settled afterward. Agreed to;
but Mr.. Duffey declined to pay until the mat
ter was settled.

membership Messrs. John Curtin, John
Fitzgerald, Frederick B. Donovan, John
Donoghuc, P. Cahill, r. McCauley, William
Walsh, John Lynch and John McDeyltt.
Referred to the Executive Committee.


Mr.. Long, Of the committee appointed to
walt upon Mr.. Dufiey, reported that the
committee had attended to thnt duty, when
he (Mr. d. } acknowledged that he had made
certain remarks concerning Mr.. Powell, but
that he had done so joklngly. He had In
tended making a statement before the asso-
citation to that effect at the last meeting, but
was prevented from appearing there by more
urgent matters, but stated he would be pres
ent at this meeting and do justice to Mr..
Powell.


Mr.. Duffey here arose and said he stood
there for the verdict Of the association. He
could not be present at the last meeting. lie
understood motion had been made to expcl
him. ""A one Of the founders Of this asso-
citation, he had done all In his power to pro-
mote Its well-belng. He was now willing to

them to the time Of the organization Of the

there were only twelve present, many being
afraid to come out on the Republican plat
form. He once met Mr.. Powell and re-
marked to him: '1Iow Is II that you got a
position, when there are many loyal men
out Of work."" but he denied ever making
any charges against Mr.. Powell to Mr.. Lar
man, under whom he Is employed.


Mr.. Duffey then presented several letters
showing his (Mr. D's) good standing In the
Republican party, and asked that they bc
read.


Mr.. o'Leary said they did not wish to
know his outside character.


Mr.. Duffey. l informed you, as one Of the
committee, that could not be here at the
last meeting, and understand that you
came here and moved that be expelled.


Mr.. 0'Lcary said Mr.. Larman gave him his
information with leave to use his name.


Mr.Dufey denied making any charge
against Mr.. Powell.


Mr.. O'Leary insisted that Mr.. Larman
had informed him that Mr.. Dufey had ap-
preached him several times to have Mr..
Powell discharged on the ground that he
was disloyal, once In presence Of Mr.. Wells,
and Mr.. Larman then instructed Mr.. Bond
to investigate the matter; which he did, and
Rscertained that Mr.. Powell was a loyal
man.


Mr.. W. Murphy said ho was present when
Mr.. Dufey approached Mr.. Powell and used
language dlshonorable to any Republican as
ISOLATION, and he wanted to have a vote on
the expulsion Of Mr.. Duifey.


Mr.. Dufey said that he remarked to Mr..
Powell In substance that he would give no
disloyal man situation.


The Chair was Of opinion that another
committee should be appointed to inycstig gate
the matter, with instructions, II necessary,
to make out written charges.


Mr.. Patrick Culinan thought Mr.. Duffcy
had come here and performed his duty, and
that all these proceedings were nonsenslcal.
Mr.. Patrick Cleary thought Mr.. Duffey a
purer Republican than many who were per-
scouting him.

to have your oath If you did not say that
you ran away from the draft and went tc

BEREA, Ono, July 9, 1869.",,"BEREA, Ono, July 9, 1869.


Mn. VANDERFoRD, DEAR SIR AS my
business has called me to this Getty of
Grindstones and huge Stone Quarries,
for few days, and having a portion of
each day to while away, the desire to
spend such pleasantly led me to attempt
to interest the readers of your valuable
sheet by describing the nodus operandi of
making grindstones, aud whence they most
ly come; yet the idea of one supposing
that anything interesting could be said Of
grindstones almost deters one from at
tempting such a subject, more especially
since my knowledge of the "" beauties of
description"" is so contracted My infor-
nation concerning the early history of
these mines was obtained through the
kindness of Mr.. Curtiss, the gentlemanly
reporter of the Cincinnati Gazette.


Berea has long been known as the loca-
ton of the German Wallace College and
the Baldwin University, either of which is
sufficient to give the town position of
importance in Northern Ohio, but its
grindstones make it known in business cir
cles as the emporium of sharpening mater
ial


The quality of the stones was first dis
covered in 1880, by John Baldwin, man
OF many cccentricities but of some excel
lent qualities. For the first two years he
employed two men to cut stone in his Gel
lar, and the stone were sent to Canada to
find a market. Mr.. Baldwin invented the
present method of turning stone. Their
first efforts produced very Indifferent stones,
but success finally crowned their efforts
and the business has increased until it now
employs thousand men and over mil
lion dollars capital. During the time
from six in the morning until six in the
evening the quarries present busy scene
and resound with the music of picks, ham,
mcrs, sledges, and drills, with derricks,
tramways and blacksmithshops almost in
Vulnerable. The amount of building stone.
tagging, shauls, and grindstones, carried
from these quarries is immense, averaging
5O car loads per day. From the different
manufacturers l have learned the amount
of grindstones turned out last year; it is
almost fabulous-ten thousand tons The
stones vary in size from four pounds to five
thousand pounds. The process of manu-
featuring is not very difficult, yet it re
CURES skill to make perfect grindstone
In the quarry, the stone is broken accord
ing to the size of the stone required; the
block is then turned on its edge and with
wedges is split with the grain Of the stone,
as easily and as smoothly as one can split
stick of pine; the corners of the stone
are then rounded off and the stone is ready
for the eye. Now comes the fulfllment Of
the old proyerb, ""sharp enough to see
through a grindstone when there is an eye
in it,"" The turner now fastens it with
rings and keys to the mandril and sets it
to revolving. The process of turning is
rough and hard but requires considerable
skill to give symmetrical form to the
stone. The fine grit flying from the stone
an impalpable dust-is productive of the
grit consumption. Formerly the average
life of turner was five years: lately
fan has been invented, enclosed in a drum,
by which the dust is carried away and pure
air supplied, and turning is not now con-
sidered so unhealthy The upturned and
disturbed condition of Berea presents any
thing but an attractive appearance. One
cannot build house with any surety of
remaining in it, for where elegant man
sions stood year ago large quarries are
now opened. Even the graves of the
dead are not left undisturbed: already
have the dead in one cemetery been re-
moved and now they are agitating the
question of moving them again, for here
in this great West everything must give
way to the decision Of business and enter
prise. FIJI. W. Lynch."

terprise, it was eminently successful
Ia the second place, the good order
maintained during four days OF intense
excitement amid crowd SO large aud
promiscuous, is complimentary to the
efficiency Of police regulations, aud
speaks most favorably for the moral
dispositions of the many who attended
the Fair. Such considerations arc not
the ouly ones that deserve attention.
Communities are prosperous and happy
in proportion as individual efforts are
combined to develope their resources
and harmonic special aud general in
terests. That expansion and improve
ment Of the individual mind which result
from travel aud its new and varied ex-
citements are realized, although in les
ser degree, by those reunions which bring
together in social greetings and emulous
competitions, the individual members Of
a community. New thoughts are de-
yeloped, ideas derive q stronger impulse,
prejudioes yield to the charities Of our
common nature, tastes are improved and
habits are rounded and softened by con.
tact with the higher influences Of intel
lectual and moral culture. IL was id
this connexion that we felt grati6ed to
see on the Fair grounds so many of the
respected clergy of our community
Their presence, without restraining the
joyousuess elected by the occasion, aided
materially in the preservation o. decorum
and good order. Religion does not
whisp,r its lessons of love and charits
to the soul in tones Of bitterness and
asperity. Emincutly conservative, even
when exacting in its dogma, it seeks
the subjusation Of evil passions by lead.
ing the hayward aud fallen to quiet and
peace thro' the aowery pathways of in
nocent aud rational enjoyment. And
though it may not eradicate all the evils
that crop out on the surface of society,
it tries to render them innoxious by the
combined force Of persuasive exhorta-
tios and instructive example. Ii thus
lends charm to proper anusemcnts
and impresses q dignity upon the anne
mites Of social life.


Nor must We omit the merited praise
due to the ladies for having lent the in.
spiration of their presence to festivities
which otherwise might have lacked in
interest rs they certainly would have
failed in brilliancy. The exponeuts Of
true taste, the impersonation Of all beau
ty, aud the exemplars Of every virtue,
how can they fail to exert happy SO.
cial and moral influence in the sphere
prescribed To their action We cheer.
fully lay the tribute of our warmest
commendation at their feet, for the
interest, and enjoyment they SO success.
fully impaired to the amusements pro.
vided by the Managers of the Agricul.
tural Fair. With these, and other
influences cooperating with the music.
diseoursed by our own and other musi
clans, was 1t any wonder that our Fair
was decided success? We feel pride
10 the assurance that the results on our
urban aud rural population will be ben.
e6eent and durable.

a, WARRINGTON, Nov. 22.-The new Haytiau
tninister was formally presented to the Presi.
Gent to-day by Secretary Fish. He was in full
ulpiomatic uniform. The usual friendly salu-
tations were exchanged. The President in re-
sponse to the Minister alluded to, as one of the
results of our late civil strife, the right of col
ored people to employ ment abroad as well as
at home in the public service; a right which
has been acknowledged by the appointment OF
one OF the prescribed race to represent the
United States in Hayti He congratulated
himself on having occasion to render homage
to the change in public sentiment.


NATIONAL BANK RETURNS.


Returns were received from 1918 national
banks. showing their condition at tine close of
business Oct. 8. The aggregate of their re-
sources and liabilities was 81 ,497 ,236 ,6O4. The

three per cent certificates. The loans and
discounts aggregate 69,517,795.


PARAGUAYAN AFFAIRS.


The investigation of the sub committee of
foreign affairs into Paraguayan matters has, it
is said. developed the fact of long standing
difficulty between our diplomatic and naval
corps abroad, involving the question of ulti-
mate authority. The committee have accord
1ngly resolved to summon before them, Vice
Admiral Porter and Second Assistant Secreta-
~ OF state Hunter, to give testimony on each
branch OF the question as to the theory and
practice of our diplomatic representation and
naval officers in the discharge of their official
duties while in foreign ports. The examina-
tion concerns the charge that naval officers
have acted Independently of or have not con-
suited the views of our diplomatic representa-
tives on important public matters which should
secure cooperation or unity of action. The
investigation will, it is thought, lead to such
definite regulations as will insure this desira-
BILE object.


EXECUTIVE APPOINTMENTS.


The President has appointed Robert M.
Douglas, son the late Senator Douglas, to be
his Private Secretary; James T. Ely of ILL.,,
taking Douglas for position as Assistant Pri-
yate Secretary. These changes do not affect
Gen. Porter's important position or official re-
lations at the Executive mansion.


THE sHIPBUILDING INTERESTS.


The Secretary of State has informed Hon.
John Lynch, chairman of the special commit
tee on the navigation interest, that he has in
structed all our Consuls, including those in
the Canadian Dominion, to collect and furnish
the committee with the information desired by
them relative to shpbuilding in the countries
where they are located."

Tho Prevalence Of Crime-Where Il tho


Remsdys


The recent fearful increase of crime has
startled the whole community Almost every
law for the protection of person and pro-
perty has been so frequently violated Of late
that certain parties in this city with more
haste than reflection have determined, 1t is
said, to organize vigilance committees like
those which saved California in its early days.
II is even asserted that in two of the wards
vigilance committees have actually been or
ganized. Some of the journals which an
nounce this extraordinary movement seem in
clined to endorse and encourage it. But they
forget how very dangerous business Lynch
law would prove to be in city where, as In
Sodom and in Gomorrah, the rogues outnum-
wolves than all the sheep and watchdogs
together the wolves themselves might snap at
this idea of organizing and directing vigilance
committees. In that case the astute Dana and
the philanthropic Greeley would be liable to
be the first victims hanged. 1t would then be
too late for them to bleat forth plaintively
their old protests against hanging.


Strangely enough, murders seem to be
more numerous than any other crimes. The
killing of Pollard in Richmond was followed
by swift and terrible succession OF murders,
North and South, ending on the day before
New Years with the fatal stabbing Of Rogers
in open daylight, in front of his own house, in
New York city. Not single day has passed
since the new year began without its record
of murder or of more than one murder. !


The instantaneous and wide publicity given
by newspapers and the telegraph is not what
makes murders appear more numerous than at
another period; murders actually are more
iii;aiainerons than they were during correspond
ing period in the year preceding the war. The
extraordinary increase of crime in general, and
of murder in particular, may be largely ac-
counted for by the storm of violent passions
excited by the war-a storm which swept
over the land and which has not yet spent all
it's fury. Moreover, morbid sympathy
with the worst criminals on the part Of
certain modern reformers, so called, has
generated so great an aversion to inaicting
capital punishment even for murder in the
first degree that juries almost everywhere,
except in New Jersey and in Philadelphia,
fail to convict in any case. The would-be
murderer is thus encouraged to the unrestrained
indulgence of passion by the probability that
he may get off scot free even though he kill his
victim. This possibility becomes a certainty
If the criminal happens to be murderess. In
compassion for the criminal, whether murderer
or murderess, American juries too often lose
not only all pity for the victim, but all sense Of
responsibility for the security of society and
all sense of justice.


The time has surely come when remedy
must be found for the deplorable and alarming
prevalence of crime. To the question, where
shall this remedy be found? there can be but
one answer-in the unflinching execution Of
the laws. If during these six months every
case of clearly proved crime were to be
followed inexorably by the full penalty Of the
law the prospective criminal calendar of the
last half Of 1869 would be surprisingly dimin-
ished."

DANvILLE. Va, March 4, 1869.


After mild winter we have a prospect in this
latitude OF propitious spring and early resump-
ton OF our chief industrial pursuits, preparations
for the coming crops and the handling OF the great
money staple, tobacco. Danville is growing to be
quite important market for the sale Of leaf tobacco,
though the manufacturing interest here is not nearly
Of such magnitude as 1t from 1850 to 1860. The
enormous tax Of thirty-two cents per pound on the
manufactured article has resulted in transferring
this branch OF the business to other localities.
Our people lack the necessary capital to
successfully manufacture the weed under the
existing system. Consequently the great bulk
OF the material brought to this market for sale
from the counties OF Halifax Charlotte, Pittsyvania,
Henry, Franklin and Patrick, Va, and from Caswell,
Rockingham, Person. Guilford and Stokes, N. c., is
reshipped to be worked at New York, Brooklyn, Lou
isvle, st. Louis, Augusta or Columbus, Ga. This is
the heart Of the fine tobacco growing region OF the
United States. The season having fairly opened the
weed Is coming into market great quantities from
the surrounding country, but of the thirty to fifty
thousand po6hds daily sold here not one-fth is held
to be manufactured in this place. Dealers In the
cities named have agents here who make their pur-
ch ases. The great advantage which manufacturer
in Brooklyn, N. Y, or Augusta Ca. has over one IN
Danville is, that he can sell the manufactured
tobacco in the factory and does not have to ax the
stamps therefore, until it is sold; whereas, there
being no market for the manufactured article here
In bulk, i has to be shipped unsold, ana before
manufacturer has thus to advance the tax money,
which is very hard on him.


This people OF all classes are very S0liclt0us that
this tax shall be reduced. The way IT is now col
lected, tax OF ten cents per pound, all secured,
would bring the government more revenue than IL
at present receives from this source and at the same
time would insure the prosperity OF large section
OF people. II the HERALD would use It's vast in1u.
ence TO have this burdensOme tax reduced 1t would
confer lasting benefit upon o large and formerly
prosperous community.


The board OF officers ordered by General Stoneman
to visit the towns and cities Of the state for the pur
pose OF recommending persons to fill the vacancies
in the civil offices were in Danville last Friday after
having been to Lynchburg and Farmvllle. General

many OF our negroes have their heads crammed full
They are lust now excited over the State Convention
OF republicans which is to meet at Petersburg on
the 9th inst. to put State ticket in the field.


Immigration Is now one OF the hobbies OF our
people. II there is any one subject upon which the

anxiously look forward to the day when the surplus
capital and energy Of the North shall make these
fertile fields rejoice again IN abundant harvests
and give q new life and impetus to every
branch OF industry. Every Northern man who
comes to cast his lot with us and make permanent
residence here win be most gladly Welcomed 1t is

EXPORTS TO PREVENT THE MIscHIET.


The Objectionable provisions of the pro-
posed new constitution were engrafted upon

wise and earnest Republicans, who, wanting
no otiiee in Virginia, could afford to give the
convention honest and patriotic advice. Sem
ator Wilson, OF Massachusetts, took the
trouble to go to Richmond to that end, and
besought them not to do In this connection
Just what they did shortly after he left their
city. Gen. Schoheld, then Military Governor
Of Virginia, addressed the convention on the
18th or April last to the same end. Before he
did so 1t had been Informally agreed not to in
sert the obnoxious provisions. Upon that
point he spoke to them as followsi

INCIDENTS OF THE DAT.
As stated In yesterdays REPUBLICAN, the
colorcd Republican voters assembled about
O'Clock In tho morning and awaited with
patience the opening Of the polls. As soon
as the hour Of q. m. had arrived tho com
missioners Of election In the several precincts
opened the polls, and voting was proceeded
with rapidly, and In nine tenths Of the pre-
cincts the rush was over by 0 O'Clock. At
ono or two OF the precincts In the First, Sec
ond, Third and Fourth wards the line Of
voters was quite large up to q late hour N
the afternoon. A good deal OF scratching of
tickets was done In several Of the wards.


In the First precinct Of the First ward
there were but two commissioners Of votes
during the day, Mr.. Peter Howisou, the
Citizen"" commissioner, not appearing. In
the Seventh ward the eolorod man, John L.


aeroe,t, -ho was Q candidate for Common


open ""bluo back"" Republican ticket. Dur.


Ing the day the board OF registration was


In session at the City Hall, issuing certia-


Gates OF registration TO such persons who


had been registered and whose names did


not appear on the books furnished TO the
commissioners Of elections.


During the day several scenes OF disorder
occurred In various portions of the city.


Many OF them were Of minor Importance
eeN ""Nio piOhptly Dy the OtnCcT6
on duty around the polls. Two or three Of
the disturbances, however, were more ylo-
lent, and one OF them was not quleted until
one OF the rioters had been killed and two
others badly wounded. The frat occurred
on the Navy Yard about IL o'clock. Ii
seems that Oniccr Green attempted to ar
rest two colored men who were engaged In a
drunken row. He succeeded in getting one
OF the men, named Pool, and then attempted
ha all -
who made a determined resistance. A
crowd OF colorcd men had by this time
gathered and endeavored to rescue the
prisoner, when Chris. Bohlayer, well
known In the Sixth ward, went to the as
sistance Of the officer.


A general row now onsued, and In the
melee the prisoners were rescued, and
bohlayer was severely cut about the face
with q razor In the hands Of some one of the
rioters. He was taken to his residence, whore
his wounds were dressed.


In the Second ward good deal OF ill-feel-
ing existed BY reason Of number Of colored
men scratching"" the candidates on the Re.
publican ticket. One Of these ''scratchers,""
Sulius wallace BY name, was dragged out
OF buggy and badly beaten, but was rescued
by the police. For q time trouble seemed
Imminent, but by the determined efforts of
the police force II was avoided.


Between and O'Clock another riot oc-
CURED In the Second ward, which did not
END as quickly nor so quietly. The cause of |
this trouble was the ""irrepresslble"" Charles |
stewart, who has been so active during the |
campaign In his advocacy Of the ""cltlzens' |
ticket"" This Individual was observed by a
number OF colored men sitting In the store OF |
Mr. VIM. Y. Given, one Of the citizens can
didates, on Twelfth street, near L street. A
rush was made, but Stewart got inside OF
tl0 ii UAlllnR tho
once locked. Soon noisy mob collected In
lront Of the house, and finally became so
ooisterous rs to frighten Mr.. Giyen's family
70 such an extent as to cause them TO leave
he premises. The police force on duty In
he precinct, with detachment Of mounted
men, forced their way through the crowd
md succeeded In driving them back, In or
Ter that pathway could DO made by which
stewart could be got out OF the house, he
i1aHing requested Major Richards to protect
llm from violence.


When Stewart was brought out on the
treet, under the guard Of file OF police, a
hout arose from the mob who attempted to
5et TO him, and had they succeeded In their
'ndeayors II Is likely that lynch law would
ave been inaugurated. But they were folled
n their endeaVor by Major Richards, who |
rdered his dismounted men to form a hol-
Nv square around Stewart, aud the mounted I


|
nabled to keep the crowd at bay and pro /
oct him.
The crowd whooped, swore, and threatened /
mob Stewart, and 1t required all the exer /
onB OF the mounted men to keep him from
cling lynched on the spot. He was carried {
own l. street to Thirteenth, and thence 10 h
ie corner Of the alley where the polls were @
cid, (Fourth precinct of Second ward. \ and |,
zero he cast his vote.


This alley was literally packed with col C
'ed men, as also the alley on the opposite q
de OF the street, and hardly had Major h
lchards left the polls with Stewart, In charge al
the police, whom a volley OF stones was ii
rown and several of the officers wero Ii
ruck; among them Sergeant Harrison, Of b
G Second precinct, who was severely injured
'out the body by the large rocks with which O,


was pelted. The police, In charge of @,
ewart, with Major Richards, moved down ii
llrteenth street, the mounted men close n,
hind, halting every now and then to warn II
mob that they must cease throwing the CO
mos. Nothing daunted, the crowd, as Il Il
re, become more Violent; and one Of them, D,
,olored man, whose name was said 10 be M
llllam Smith, fired pistol at Major Rich al
is, who had already been struck several th
ies with stones. Instlnctlyoly, as II were, m
Major threw up the pistol with his arm, III
the course OF the ball was ayerted as JC
lugh by miracle. an
general tumult ensued, and the police, re
70, Dy THIS time, had arrived at the corner Gu
and Thirteenth streets, made q halt, be
u amid shower OF rocks and stones, fired isl"

men were wounded. Happily the men were
unhsrmed. The determined course Of the |
officers had the effect TO quell, In o measure, |
the disturbance, but II soon began to crop |
out again, and for little while Il looked as |
though q regular battle was 10 be fought be- |
tween the mob and the police force.


Mayor Bowen, upon being Informed oftht
occurrence, proceeded TO the ""battle ground |
and used his powers of persuasion 10 sucl |
an extent that he soon succeeded In restor.
Ing order, which maintained throughout the
remainder Of the afternoon.


Shortly after this occurrence intelligence
was received that riot was In progress In
the Seventh ward, and upon proceeding
thither Il was found that another ""cltlzenS
was In trouble. This was no other than
Samuel Cooper, . colored man, who last
year was near being lynched by his colored
brethren for voting the Democratic ticket.
Cooper went TO the First precinct Of the
Seventh ward and voted q citizens ticket,
which being made known to crowd Of col
ored men around the polls, threats were
made against him, and after he had voted an
attempt was made to beat him.


He then put himself under the protection
Of two Of the police officers, but he was soon
torn from their care by the violence Of the
mob. Cooper then made his escape by
jumping Into q wagon, which was driven
rapidly away. Two or three pistol shots
were hred,but no one was hurt. The crowd
were quleted by the appearance Of Register
Boswell, who made some forclblc remarks,
taking for his text the sentiment which
headed their ticket, Get US have peace.s


At the closing Of the polls the police force
repaired 10 police headquarters, where they
were held until 12 o'clock, but everything
being very quiet throughout the city they
were dismissed to their homea.


In the First ward all was quiet during the
day and last night, and the only arrests
made were those OF two persons charged
with disorderly conduct, not connected, how
ever, with any Of the voting precincts.
1t was rumored last night that an attack
would be made on the store OF William N.
Slowen, corner OF Pennsylvania avenue and
Twentieth strcot, and some dozen or more
| friends OF Mr.. 8. assembled at his store, pre-
ra-sa - -ersi ~-y attack that might be
made; but up to one o'ainct tbis morning
no demonstration was made, and MP
slowon and his friends retired to the arms OF
morpheus.


Bon1res were lighted In different sections
Of the city early last night In honor Of the
Republican victory, but they were Of short
duration, as Major A. g. Richards dis
patched kilograms to the several precinct
lieutcnants ordering them TO be ""squelched,"" !""
and also forbiddlng parades or assembling
Of large crowds In any Of the streets.


REcEIvISa THE RETURNS AT UNION LEAGUE
| HALL.


Shortly after dark last night the Re.
psolicans began TO assemble at Union
League Hall, when ii was announced tbe re.
turns would be secured and read out,


Mr.. VIM: A. Cook presided and Maio,
Morse, b. N. Meads, and half dozen other,
acted as secretaries. Before o O'clock IN
hall was crowded, but II was nearly 10
o'clock before any definite returns came in,
After the result In number Of precincts had
been announced, Major Morse took the Stand
and made short address, In which he OK
pressed his gratihcation at the result Of the
election. He denounced the renegadcs from
the Republican party who had scceptsf
nominations on the cltlzons' ticket, In un


measured terms. Referring to tho dlfflcnI


ties In the Second ward he said there was !
colored man who had betrayed the trust n
bis manhood, which had excited the grcatesi
animosity In the breasts Of tho cslored mon
and In their attempts TO show that animoslt,
human life had been sacrificed and Arc
side made desolate. He urged that sucf
men be left TO the pangs which God wouId
infict upon their consclences, more sever
than the knife or the pistol could possibl,
cause. Let them 60 II they will, but let ouI
example bc such as will prevent Tho occnr
renee OF any more such scenes.


MT. 7. q. Connolly, Alderman elect of tho
Third ward, was introduced, and conpratu
lated the Republicans Of tho city upon IN,
glorious future that was opened by the day,,
triumph. We would have a Republicar
e1ecutiye, Republican Board OF Alder
have common policy John sherman had
said that the future OF Washington was !
question Of railroads, and we now bad a.
surance that the city government WohId
pursue policy worthy OF itself and In har.
mony with the views OF the General Gov.
ernment: When this was done, the jeal.
ousies OF all the sections would cease and
the capital would be cherished by the ma.
tion forever.


In congratulatory address.


MT. y. M. Dalton was called for, but me,
with some opposition and cries of 'Demo-
crat,"" but he finally obtained hearing. but
gave way FOR the reading Of more returns.
during the reading Of which Mr.. Boswell
entered with the returns from the Seventh
ward, He was received with tremendous
cneering, after which Mr.. Cook read the re.
turns Cries then arose on all sides for Mr..
Boswell, and he, mounting the table. was
received with prolonged cheers.


MT. Boswell said he felt thankful 10 tho
people OF Washington for the complimentary
vote they had given him. He esteemed il NJ
a compliment from the workingmcn OF tho
city. he had been selected as the candidate
OF the Republican party, and some had said
ne was the weakest man that could have
with his cohorts had been buried in oblivion.
lie said he had promised q few evening""
since TO preach the funeral sermon of tie
citizens' party, but he was not well enough
to do 1t tonight. Ssmmes had said that n
the Republicans had put up any other man
than Boswell he would not run; but as they
had selected Boswell ho would beat him. In
the Seventh ward he [Mr. BoswelIl had
three times as many majority rs Semmes
Tomorrow night, II he felt well enough and
they would be quiet, he would preach that
funeral sermon. Cheers.


Mr.. J. A. Dalton was again called for, and
In getting upon the platform he laid his
hand upon Mr.. Boswell's shoulder, saving
he proposed to lean on Boswell, and as Bos,
well owned the Seventh ward he thought he
had pretty good support. This party of
progress, he said, proposed to redeem the
city from tho thraldom Of old fogyIsm
These old fogies had damned the canal to
death, and the progressive party would now
see that It was properly attended to. II
would give us more railroad facilities, make
our city beautiful, and give us a decent mar
ket-house. He desired to soc the hands of
thc cnlet magistrate (whom he was sorry
he did not support at the last electlon1
strengthened that he might redeem the city
from the clutches Of old fogyism. He was
proud to say that he had tho confidence Of
the workingmen Of his ward. II was not
the party that made tho man, but the live
working men that made the party.


The returns from tho First precinct of tho
fifth ward were read and loudly ,cheered,
when Mr.. A. B. Tlnney, Councilman elect
from that ward, was called for and mounted
the table, being received with lusty cheers.
He simply thanked the assemblage for the
compliment paid him, and hoped by bis
future conduct to gain their future fayors,


Mr.. Cook hero announced the majoritles |
received up to this time, amounting to 8. .4OS. |
This was received by yociferous cheering.
and cries, we will make 1t 5000.


DR.. Pardon, Councilman elect from the |
First ward, said he had felt mad AT Mr..
Boswell. The First ward had always been |
the banner ward, but he was afraid tho sey-
enth was going TO take away the banner. |
The returns wero not all In yet, and II might |
look better when they got all the returns in. |
They were slow In counting up In his ward. |
for the Democratic tickets were so scarce |
that when they came across one they stoppod |
10 look at II as q curiosity."

EMIGRATION FROM ENGLAND.


In publishing not long since some imizra-


ton stat stics we called attention TO the fact


that the emigration from England to this couu-


try was largely Oh the increase. Within a few

LANDS and colonize them with English and


Scotch farmers. Both gentlemen are members


OF an influential emigration agency In 0reat


Britain- These agencies are, we are Rlad To


say, bringing over every year thousands of in


teiligent laboring men, thus benentnx both


countries. An International Land and Labor


Agency"" has been formed at Birmingham


England, 70 facilitate the settlement in the


United States Of English farmers, mechanics
and laborers Of all occupations. A circular
ey the association sets forth that there ara
thousands of farmers sons trained to the best
systems of English agric ulture. but who cannot
nnd farms in England on which to apply their
skiiied industry, though preferring the occu.
pation 70 which they Were born and bred


Inese VIII constitute a class Of purchasers who
will do much to improve American agriculture
IN the New England States as well as in the
West and South. Then there are tnoussnds OF
merchants, manufacturers and welI.to-do
cacesmen who cannot divide their businesses
with their sons. nor set them mp in their I'm
line Of occupation. These will form another
class OF purchasers In America, If put in the
right way to that end. And nothing perhaps
would more encourage and induce them TO do
90 than some plan which would enable than to
make purchases without ineurring the risk of
being victimized or deceived by land specula
tors This agency. therefore, IS opened up
expressly 10 facilitate such purchases, by buy
ing direct from the owner, at the small charge
of ore per cent to be pa i'd by each party. By
advertising in American papers, and BY SPECIAL
agents, lists OF farms for sale, on the proposed
terms, VIII be obtained in most of the different
States. The second undertaking Of the agency
is to supply orcers for English Iaborers of ali
occupations, in ciucing skilled mechanics of
every trade, iarm laborers, gardeners, srooms.
shepherds, &c; also, governesses, female
Clerks, housemaids, dairymaids anc domestic
servants Of all kinds. There is NO doubt of he
fact that New Er rgIaDd, the West and the South
need laborers Of intelligence, and there is also
70 doubt that England Is syerstecke by lust

pledge OF United States bonds, came up, pend
ing an amendment that was offered by Mr.
Wilson, authorizing an increase of 800 900 00(
over the issue of circulating notes, and provid.
ing that in making the issue the preference
shall be given to banking associations in such
States and sections of the country as are not
adequately supplied with banking facilities


Mr. Sherman explained in detail the provis-
ions of the bill in long speech


Mr.. Morrill, offered an amendment to the

len shall be made up on the banks havingfa
capital exceeding 100000. Lost.

900, 900 instead of $350.000,OO0.


Mr.. Morton asked the Senator from Louis
lana whether the amendment contemplated
the retiring of an equal amount of greenbacks?
Mr. Kellogg said 1t did,


Mr.. Morton said that would be direct yio-
lation of the bill recently passed pledging the
United States to the payment of all their Obli-
cations in coin, and he could not consent to it.
The propriety of withdrawing the surplus
banking circulation from the Eastern States





bAted at length, upon substantially the same
grounds as in the former discussion of the
same question.


Without action on the bill, the Senate, at
410, went into executive session and soon
after adjourned.


Messrs Jencks and Benton were appointed
additional members of the Committee ON Re-
trenchment.


Mr.. Dawes rose to personal explanation
arising out of statement made by him in the
New Mexico contested election case. Mr..
Heith, Secretary of the territory of New Mex
leo, charged him (Dawes) with calling him a
REBEL He declared now he spoke the truth,
and sustained his position by proof.
MIR. Poland, from the Committee on Revision
of the Laws, reported joint resolution rela-
tive to steamboats, and other vessels owned in
the loyal States during the war; which he ex
planned and advocated at great length. 1t
gave rise to considerable discussion, which was
participated in by Messrs. Washburne of Wis
consin, Lawrence, Wrinkle, Berry, Maynard,
Hoar, Hawkins, Allison, Benjamin and Logan
The resolution then passed-yeas 81, nays 80.
Mr. Poland was, at his own request, excused
from further service on the Reconstruction
Committee, remarking that the request was
not made from any dissatisfaction with that
committee, but in order to perfect arrange
ments on another committee.


Mr.. Upson was also, at his request, excused

Committee on Reconstruction.


The Speaker announced as the special com

Mr.. Butler introduced bill to enforce the
14th amendment to the Constitution and the
laws of the United States, and to restore the
State of Georgia to the Republican Govern
ment elected under its new Constitution, Re-
ferred to the Committee on Reconstruction
and ordered to be printed


The House then took up the bill to provide
for the organization of provisional Govern
ment for Mississippi.


Mr.. Wood spoke in opposition to the bill,
when it was laid aside, and the House pro-
eeeded to the business on the Speakers table,
the first matter being the Senate amendments
to the House bill repeating the tenure of Office
act


Mr.. Butler moved to refer the bill and
amendments to the Judiciary Committee, and
desired to give some reasons therefor.


Mr.. Farnsworth desired to enter motion to
concur in the Senate amendments.


Mr.. Bingham said he had risen for the same
purpose.


Mr.. Butler declined to yield for that pur-
pose, but yielded to Mr. Logan, who moved to
amend the bill by proviso that all civil offices,
except Judges OF the q. s. Courts, that were
filled by appointment of the President Of the
United States, by and with the advice and
consent of the Senate, before the 4th of March,
1862 shall become vacant on the 30th of june,
1869


The discussion was continued by Messrs
Logan and Washburne of Wisconsin in oppo-
sition to the Senate amendments, and in favor
of an absolute repeal of the act.


Mr.. Butler, of Massachusetts,, declared that
the Senate amendment was a new tenure Of
Office bill, more wrong in principle, more fata
in action, and more destructive to the privi-
leges OF the House and OF the people, and was
eonferring more power on the Senate than thu
present tenure OF Office bill; it fettered the
Executive more. II he (Butler) were to vott
Tor either, he would vote for the one on tht
statute book in preference; the Senate was al
irresponsible body, and an irresponsible bod,
was ever dangerous.


Mr.. Poland inquired how the gentleman from
Massachusetts justified the passage of the ten
ure of Office bill originally.


Mr. Butler replied ne had 30 occasion to *
into such justification. daughter ON th'
Democratic side).


Mr.. Poland-But the gentleman's politica
associates have abundant reason to go int
their justification.


Mr. Butler-There were many things whic
we had to do to save the life of the country i
the war. for which justification cannot be foun
in the Constitution; there were many thing
which we had to do under Andrew Johnso
which had better never be done again, (laugt
teri and had better be got rid of as soon az pos
sible. Mr.. Butler characterized the Senat
amendment rs declaration Of q want of con
fidence in tie President What good had tn
law ever done? Had it cured bad President
Ruthlessly and in defiance of it, Andrew Johr
son had turned Edwin M. Stanton out of o
fee and when the House impeached hiI
therefor, the Senate held him aequit and FIRE,


Mr. Farnsworth suggested that the Senator
who had voted to convict johnson had vote
for this amendment.


Mr.. Butler-I did not know who was in fs
vor of the amendment; it had been passed
secret caucus, but he knew that the vote o
the repeal of the law did not bear out the ger
tleman's statement.


Mr. Farnsworth-The vote ON the Senai
amendment does bear me out.


Mr. Butler-Oh, bahl fiddlesticks, (laugl
ter); it was made a matter of caucus dietatioI
it was agreed to as compromise, and all con
promises in legislation are vicious. have bee
told that the President is satisfied with th
law. l do not pretend to have the knOwlede
about that which others claim to have, but
have no doubt that if President Grant sal
anything about it it was under circumstance
of the Senate committee going to him and say
ing. ""Sir. you are our President; we are
trouble in the Senate; If you don't agree I
this we shall have trouble among ourselves
and President Grant may have said, agree
that or anything else rather than you shou
have trouble: don't mean to put myself
your way: 1 don't mean to raise any difficult
in vour Darty. But if he said so it was becau
he relied on the sentiment of the country;
relied on the House of Representatives; ne
lied on our sense of our own dignity; on o.
sense of our rights; on our sense OF our oN """

Speaker Blaine is busily employed in arranging the
Committees of the new Congress, and they will be
announced at the earliest moment consistent with
proper reflection and their importance There is no
doubt that Mr.. Schenck will remain at the head Of
the Ways and Means, and that Mr. Banks viii con-
tue rs Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee
Mr.. Dawes viii probably take the place of Mr.
Washbume at the head of tho Appropriations
Committee. The probable retirement of Mr.
Boutwell, from the House. TO take a seat in the
Cabinet, viii doubtless give the Chairmanship OF
the judiciary TO Gen. Garfield, which would other
wise belong to the former The latters place, at tho
head of the Military Committee, will probably he
filed by Gen. Logan. Mr. Hooper will, it is thought
be offered his choice Of tho cbaTmanship Of the
Banking and Currency Committee, or position on
the Ways and Means. If he accepts the latter, Gen
Butler will probably be appointed to the former and
rice resa The chaiImanshp Of the Indian Commit
tee. and also that of tho Committee on Territories
are vacant and it is believed that Mr. Allison viii
be offered either, but it is likely he viii prefer to re-
main in his present place on the Ways and Means



be announced on Tuesday and the others as soon
thereafter as practicable


Informal conferences have been held by prominent
members Of both Houses in reference to the probable
duration Of the present session of Congress. When
the Committees Of the two Houses are announced an
effort will be made to bring the oharmen oi the lead
ing committees together in caucus, for the purpose
of consultations aud il is believed that they will ar
range a time for adjournment There is 10 doubt tho
session viii continue until the end Of this month at
least and there are many even who believe it will
last two months.


A curious case has been brought TO the notice Of
the State Department, by resolution of the Illinois
Legislature which viii undoubtedly give rise TO con-

that the Government Of Bavaria recognized no mar
Eiages in the United States valid, far as they
related TO Bayaran citizens, and she was compelled

study and the exact recitation of every lesson
during the month, being absent no days

embraces those who deserve laudable men

month. 1t is a matter of honor, and while
it is meant to encourage all, it especially
mentions the diligent and trusty pupil who
has conducted him or herself properly. and

THE FIRE AssEssMENTs,-The fire
committee have completed their labors, and
have placed the assessment rolls in the hands
of the collectors, Messrs. Corbin and Psyn-
ter. These gentlemen will call upon the
property holders, commencing on tomorrow
morning, for the purpose of collecting the
assessments, The committee, after a careful
estimate, require one hundred canvass buck
cts, costing $3.50 each, currency; three more
ladders, twenty-four feet long. and graphing
irons, sl25; one wagon, $3.50; house situated
on Clore street, in the rear of E. s. Wilson's
old store, $500; picks, axes, etc, making a
total of 81 ,425. 1t is TO be hoped that the
property holders who are subject to this as
sessment will respond promptly and without
complaint or grumbling, and that the duties
of the collectors will not be made more disa>
greeable than possible. They donate their
labor and their time they are actually doing
work for the public ard they should receive
every courtesy and consideration that ran be
extended 70 them. We shall, from time to
time, give the result of their labor.


CHANGED HANDs.-We learn that Hus-
sew, Dahler & Co., of Western banking fame,
have concluded purchase of the Miners
Nstional Bank, of Salt Lake City, and will
take charge of all the business connected
with that institution. IL Is, we understand,
the intention of MesSrs. Hussey, Dahler a
Co. to secure a charter for a new banking e.
tablishment, under the name and style of
the First National Bank of Utah."" This
leaves but two banking houses in Salt Lake
City, and we learn that of all the immense
business transacted there, uussey, Dahler a
Co. receive the lions share. This may be at
tributed TO their extensive business reputation,
and their courteous and accommodating man
ner of doing business.


= THEATRE.-We were shown private
letter from Mr.. LsngriShe in which he speaks
of his early return to Montana We are re-
jbIced to learn that our city may soon be hon.
ored by the presence of this distinguished
manager, and a first class company of ladies
and gentlemen. We understand that Mr..
Langrisbe has purchased the old Bank Ex-
change with the intention of erecting on the
site a splendid theatre, complete in its proper
tions and perfect in all respects. We believe
that such an enterprise would be a source of
profit, and that Mr.. Lapgrishe is just the man
to take hold of it. He enjoys an experience
as a theatrical manager of over twenty years,
during which time be has accumulated for
tune, and his well known energy, ability and
correct judment q business man, and the
generosity and liberality of our citizens,
would insure to him n handsome return.


Ii. l.. A. LECTURE,-The last Lecture
before the Helena Library Association will
be delivered on Thursday evening next by
j. Sidney Osborne, of this city, at the NJ. E.
Church. The subject selected by Mr.. Osborne
for his theme is one full of interest, and viv-
ID with pleasurable emotions-''The glimpse
of three COntinents."" Mr.. Osborne spent n
season in foreign travel, and the gllml ses
that be gives to US viii be gathered from his
personal observations. He is a gentleman
accomplished ""a a writer, and weaves words
into pictures q beautiful as the lands of sun
ny skies and vine clad hills over which he
leads US in his wanderings. We hope and ex-
pect to see a crowded house.


RUNNING AGAN.-We regret that We
faiIed TO notice the fact that A. NJ. Hotter &
Bros saw mill, which was destroyed so recently
by FIRE, has been rebuilt t.refurnished with all the
necessary machinery, and Is again In full run
ming order. This is quick work, for il was
generally supposed that it would be impossi-
bic to get il equipped and in working order

tercsts.


The prompt action in the House Of Repre-
sentatives on the resolution of Mr. Lynch to
create select committee of nine to inquire
into and report upon American maritime in
terests shows that this important subject is
likely to receive at last some consideration.
The committee is to inquire into the causes of
the great reduction of American tonnage
engaged in the foreign carrying trade and the
great depression in the navigation interests Of
the country; also to report what measures are
necessary to increase our ocean tonnage,
revive maritime interests and to regain for our
country the relative position which it once held
among nations as o maritime Power. There
will be little difficulty in ascertaining the cause
OF the decline Of our tonnage; the war and
the Alabama and her fellow corsairs explain
that. But the question is how are we to get
back to the position we held before the war.
No country is more favorably situated than ours
for erecting and maintaining vast mercantile
marine. Our immense seaboard, numerous
harbors, the seafaring character of large





portion Of the American people, our skill in
shipbuilding and our vast forests Of fine timber
and exhaustless mines Of iron, all contributed
to make this country, few years ago, first In
maritime importance, and will do so again
under proper laws and encouragement.
Everything possible should be done to en-
courage shipbuilding; but until we are in q
situation to compete with foreign builders the
government should permit our citizens to reg
lister vessels built by and purchased of foreign
ers. If Americans can build or purchase
vessels abroad cheaper than at home let them
do so, and let their property become American
and under the American flag and protection.
If we cannot compete at present with foreign
shipbuildefs let US do, then, the next best
thing-get our ships elsewhere; and, at all
events and under any circumstances, let us
restore our lost maritime position among the
nations. We hope the committee will take this
broad and liberal view of the subject and
report accordingly."

The sun would steal down, bu for once, though we had not too mucl time, we seemed to have enough to ge through without a hurry. We big boys were responsible for the young sters. and we had them safely up or the Holdemess road, by Clapp's grand. mothers, Tom Lynch driving and the little ones piled in-Sarah Clavers ir front-with the chestnut-bags, when the sun went down.

 By the time it was pitch dark we were at home, and were warmly wei. comed by the master and sMiss Try 'phosa. Good soul, she even made dip toast for our suppers, and had hot ap- pies waiting for us between the andl- rons. The boys rushed in shouting, scattered to wash their hands, and to get her to pick out the thorns, and some of our fellows 10 put on some oi the chestnuts to boil. For me. stepped into the school-room, and, in the dark. moved the minute-hand oi the clock back two bours. Before long we all gathered at tea--the master with us, as was his custom in the evening.

Well. boys, am sure am much indebted to you for one nice long afternoon"" My cheeks finglcd a little. and when the master said, ""Yes, the afternoon fairly made up the short-colnings of the morning.. did not dare to look him in the face. Singleton slipped off from table, and l think he then went ard replaced the watch-keys.

 The next day, as we sat in algebra. the clock struck twelve instead oi ten. The master went and stopped the strik- ing part. Did he look at me when he did so? He is now Bishop of New Archangel. Will he perhaps write me Il line to tell me? And that afternoon. when Brereton was on his Scientific Dialogues. actually the master said to him, Il will go back to the last lesson. Brercion. What is the length of a seconds pendulum And Brercton told him. What should you think tue beat of our pendulum here ?"" said the doctor, opening the case. Brcreton could not tell and the master explain- rd; that this pendulum was five feel long. That the time otthe oscillations of two pendulums was as the square root of the lengths. Brereton had already said SO he was set to calculate on the board the square root of sixty inches. and the square root of the seconds pendulum, 39l39. I have remembered that to this day. So he found out the beat of our pendulum and then we verified it by the masters watch. which was going thatafternoon. Then with perfect cold blood the mas ter said, And ii you wanted to make the pendulum 90 twice as fast, Brcre- ton, what would you do?"" And Brereton, innocent as Psyche, but eager as Pallas Athene, said, of course that he would take the square root ei five. divide it by two, and square the quotient. .'The square is 1925 said he, rapidly. Fl would cut the rod at one foot two and quarter inches from the pivot, and hang on the bob there. ;

 ""Very good said the master, GOT. more simply you move the bob up three quarters of the way So saying he gave us the next lesson. Did he know. or did he not know? Singleton and l looked calmly on. but showed neither guiltno curiosity.

 Dear Master. if there Is ink and pa ,,n in. A T say. did you know, or did you not know? Accept this as my confession. and grant absolution to me, being peni- tent.

 Dear master and dear reader, am not so penitent but will own, that, in a thousand public meetings since, l have wished some spirited boy had privately run the pendulum bob up to the very pivot of the rod. Yes, and there have been thousand nice after 'noons at home, or at Georges, or wi'h Halliburton, or with Liston. or with you. when I have wished l could stretch the rod-the resf of you uncon- scious-till it was ten times as long.

THE sHERIFF'S FEES.

AUDAcIoUs ATTEMPT TO INCREASE AN INCOME
OF $200000-THE BILL BEFORE THE LEGIs.
LATuRE.",,"A bill was yesterday passed by the Assembly
to increase the fees OF the Sheriff OF the City OF New
York It's necessity is based the statement Of Mr. o.
Brien the present incumbent that the Office yielded him
last year only $500 This extraordinary statement as to
the emouments Of the shrevalty has read with
prise by every citizen who has bur the slightest idea o.
this department. and the amount supposed be realized
by the Sheriff, while every really acquainted with
tand there at least 500 lawyers In New York wha
have throughout the business with the
shers oficeregards the assertion Of only $500 being
realized by Sheriff 0Bren for the past year. as not only
false but O stupid absurlity. Il..il..


Mr. OBriens two immediate predecessors. Messrs
Kelly and Lynchthe former Of whom served two terms
one before and the other after Lynchboh retired from
the office wealthy II is said that Mr. Kelly, after
his first term was wealthy enough to build number Of
brownstone houses uptown and Lynch retired from the
Office worth some s5oOo0 Sheriff Kelly retired from his
second term worth 100000 Neither of these officials
ever dreamt Of going to the Legislature for oal to
their fees being too well satisfied with the fees
they were receiving Nor is it pretended that although
they charged enormously the proper statuabe fees
OBren charges less On the contrary the concurrent
testimony of the members Of the legal profession who
have had business to transact with the shers oce Tor
more than ten years past is that OBrien's fees, in
every are far in of either Kelly or Lynch


In considering the subject there two branches OF
rascay TO be exposed the enormty OF the overehages
In the fees regulated by the Revised Code and the Gre
alton offices by the Sheriff not warranted by law. But
let 0rst glance at some sources Sueflu
oBrien's present income, and then Judge whether is
ought to satisfy him as 1t Is. t""""
THE LUDLow-sT. PRISON.
On the assumption Of office by tho Sheriff he has to
make various appointments Those within his Office

be. OBren being subject to the dication OF the Ring""

in all probability the clerks, assistants and deputies
the appontees OF this precious body There Is however
one oce which has been Invariably sold, at least by bis
immediate predecessors, at bonus Of from $500 to
s25OOc, namely, the keepershp OF Ludow-st Prison.
Mr. Moore the keeper Of this prison under Mr. Kelly, is
said to have paid $4,000 to that Sheriff When OBen
came into Office 1t Is also said that Moore offered him
$4,000 for the place. 1t was, however given to Joe""
Tracy of the Nineteenth Ward and what he paid Is not
known the ""Ring"" coming in to obtain for him the pref
erence. 1t s however said that he paid $4,000 for it,
and the place worth far money can be coined
there For nero board debtors pay an average OF SIS TO
so week. which realizes profit Of cent per cent Then
there is the milk meat bread and grocery contracts
which large percentage is made, doubtless mutually
profitable TO both contracting parties. But what Is
little Ell Dorado to the keeper is the supply Of
the wines liquors, cigars billiard table and other lux
uries which the creditor who at all afford them wll
have; and it Ia principle in human natule that If man
will drink and play and enjoy other luxures when moving
abroad, he will double his allowance Of such luxuries

Sheriff. frIrs
THE COURT CALENDARS 'iF9m


This source OF the sherrs income is gre item and
often altogether overlooked calculating tho sheffHs

OF suits on three calendars OF the Supreme Court

therein the Sheriff paid 50c often collected from Doth

Take for instance the month Of January OF the present

9_1869-02-22_p3_sn86053571_00237289031_1869022201_0193,The national Republican.,01,1869-02-22,p3,,,"he had seen an attempt on the part Of
some 10 bring politics into this discussion.
He hoped that tho colorod people would not
allow themselves TO be hoodwinked by de-
signing men. He had no ends TO serve. He
would extend the right hand OF friendship
to any man, white or black, who would be-
friend the colored race. The people did not
complain about Congress having passed the
bill, but they did complain Of Mayor Bowen
and his satellites who had forced the bill
through Congress- by a system Of chlcanery
and underhand working against the wishes
Of the colored people.


Mr.. L. A. Bowen. Mr.. Downing, you are
duplicating your best friend.


Rev. A. Bowen. Mayor Bowen Is the best
friend the colored people ever had.


Mr.. Downing claimed that he was q clti-
zen Of Washington and had right TO judge
who his friends were, and would tell them
when they did wrong.


Amid good deal OF confusion, Mr.. Down
ing closed his remarks, and gave way to
Mr.. Harrison, who was to make the closing
speech Of the evening. After order had
been restored, Mr.. Harrison took the ground
that the discussion had dwindled into the
question, are the colored men 1t 10 manage
their own affairs or have they a right to
participate In such management At some
length the speaker reviewed the arguments
which had been advanced In favor Of the bill,
and closed by saying that II Congress had
thought the bill was favorable to the In
terests Of the colorcd people they wonld not
have allowed the veto message to have
slumbered SO long In committee room.


After Mr.. Crane and the Chair had re-
turned thanks for the attention and compara-
tive good behavior, the meeting, at 1l;40,
was declared adjourned.


SERVICES AT On. BurLER's CHURCH Yrs
rBRDAr.-In the forenoon, yesterday, at 81.
Paul's Lutheran church, corner Of Eleventh
and II streets, Rev. Mr.. Alberts, of Phila-
delphia, occupied the pulpit with Rev. Mr..
Butler, the pastor, and preached very able
and instructive sermon from the following
words to large and attentive audiencoi
Sand Jesus answered him, saying, II is writ
ten that man shall not live by bread alone,
but by every word Of God. .""-Luke w., 4.


Just previous to the delivery OF this excel
lent discourse, the pastor announced that at
1880 o'clock Of tho evening Of the 4th OF
March, ""nn inaugural--(n (not ball)-but an
inaugural union prayer meeting would be
offered up In behalf Of the President, Vice
President and the Government, in accord
ancc with scriptural instruction, and he felt
that II would result In more good even than
an inaugural ball.


II Is with qualification that we state that
during all the time the Government was
struggling against a gigantic rebellion, no
""uncertain sound"" proceeded from Mr.. But
ler's pulpit; but that he took frequent occa-
sion, when instructing his flock In their
duties towards the Grand Architect Of the
Universe, TO also remind them Of faithful
adherence and strict obedience to the laws Of
their Government. Mr.. Brown, a clerk In
one OF the departments, yesterday assumed
the leadership Of the choir Of this church,
and the excellence OF the music was appa-
rent.


PoLIcR ISrELLI0ENcE.-Wm. Coggswell,
charged with selling liquor without license,
was flnod $50 by Justice Tucker, upon which
he appealed to court.


Anthony whaicy and W. II. Wood were
each fined s5 for indecent exposure In the
streets.


Richard Corbin, for carrying concealed
weapons, was fined $50 by Justice Tucker.


Phillis Jones, Martha Jones, Doctor Jones,
Charles Lee and Roy Carter, colored, for dis
orderly conduct and using profane language,
were sent TO the work house in default OF pay
ing fine of IS each.


VIM. Smith, colored, for resisting Special
Officer II. F. Magec In the discharge Of his
duty, was required to give security for court.


William johnson, colored, on suspicion OF
stealing lot Of chickens from j. A. Dun
nington, Is held for hearing by Justice
Lynch.


Thomas White, II. 8. LitchGeld and John
Comes, for maintaining nuisances upon their
premises, were fined IS each.


Michael Hamlin, on charge Of grand lar
ceny, Is held for hearing before Justice
Morsell.


Charles Putnam, on three charges of petit
larceny, was committed TO jail for court by
Justice Harper.


Edward Mccarthy, for keeping his restau-
rant open on Sunday, was fined $40 by Jus
tice Harper, upon which he took an appeal.


THE GEORGETOWN ELECTIoS.-The annual
election for municipal officers of the city Of
Georgetown will take place to-day. The
election Ia for Mayor, one alderman, Ito
ill a vacancy,) and eleven members OF the
Board Of Common Council. There are two
tickets In the field-the Grant and Colfax,
headed by DR.. G. II. Cragin, and the Citi.
zens' ticket, headed by II. N. swceny. Both
parties are confident Of success, and the
prospect is that very close vote will be
polled. The corrected list OF registered
voters In Georgetown show total OF 1880,
Of whom 1856 are white and 1908 colored;
excess OF white over colored voters, 533.
Last year the total number registered was
2,4Sl, Of whom ,525 were white and $50 col
ored; excess of white over colored voters, 500.
By these figures Il will be seen that the
white vote has increased 2l1 since last year.
and the colored vote e47; gain Of so col
ored voters. Tho Republicans, In view of
these figures, are very hopeful as to the re.
suit to-day, because here is q sure gain of
80 colored votes, besides IN expected Repub-
lican gain In the white vote since last year,
when that party elected their whole ticket.


RELIGIOUS SBRvIoEs AT TUE NATIONAL
TtEp L.ll l.As ~.
last night aud O discourse delivered by the
Rev. Mr.. Sharman, who said he would only
take for his text, ""The signs of the times
and certain thoughts and aspirations CON-
mon to every soul"" lie spoke Of Luther's
reformation, three hundred and my years
ago, and said that reformation had ended
three hundred years ago; that while every
thing else had progressed, theology had re-
mained stationary. lie argued that while
the churches had been stationary, they were
not stable and were now In a state of certain
decay, and that the time must soon come
when Il must give way to the same spirit Of
progress which had swept away other old
things. The discourse was attentlyely lis
tened to by large audience.


BRApY's PHoToGRAPIc COLLECTION OF
REPRESENTATIVE MEN and War Views Is
well worthy the attention of visitors. The
collection embraces the portraits Of distln-
gulshed statesmen, jurists, authors, travellers,
military and naval heroes, and members of
the present Congress. His war views en-
brace scenes In the various campaigns of the
late great national struggle, from Bull Run
to the close Of the war. Strangers visiting
the capital should not fail to procure selec-
tlon Of these ""reminiscences Of the war to
take home with them.

Chicago Tribune says: Morton and Thomp-
son, charged with the express robbery on. the
Hudson River Railroad last May, have with
drawn their contest to the demand for their
extradition, and 60 from Sandwich to New
York to day, in charge of Felker, Govern
ment detective, that being the condition of
their voluntary surrender. They objected to
going with Pinkerton. Felker claims that
Reno and Anderson were not robbers OF the
express at Mansfield. for which he and party
were hung, but that the robbery was the work
of five men who are known to him; that he
has offered the express company to arrest the
guilty men, and prove their crime and reco-
yer most of the stolen money. Col Wood.
Chief of National Detectives, and Rufiin,
Chief of the Cincinnati Police, made the same
offer, but the company declined. 1t IS prob
able that startling revelations will soon be
made in reference to the recent robberies and
lynchings in Southern Indiana, which must
not at present be hinted at."

INCIDENTS OF THE ELECTION.",,"


Contrary TO general expectation. fostered by par
tisan acrimony and encouraged by recent political
arguments not recognized BY the CODE tho election
passed of In remarkably quiet manner. This
was doubtless DUE In great measure, to
the extensive preparations made at police
headquarters for the suppression OF any
disturbance that might have occurred. To guard
against any possibility OF disorder effective reserve
forces OF police were stationed at the City Hall,
police headquarters, and at tire Seventeenth Nine
teenth, Twentieth and Twenty-third precinct sta
ton houses. At the different polling places no un-
usual excitement was observable ana In many
wards the loungers who invariably gather around
the doors OF the polls wore an ar OF lstless In
difference. Perhaps the most noticeable feature
OF repeating was that commenced in the Ninth ward
at an early hour In the day; but number OF police
Officers having been detailed to watch the
proceedings at each polling place promptly
arrested the repeaters and enectually checked
the fraud. In the Sixteenth ward 1t was
claimed that repeating was brlsky carried
on by both sides, but 1t appears to have been
done, with one or two exceptions, In manner that
defed detection.


Although many residents Of the Eighteenth ward
anticipated riot between the friends OF the Tam.
many nominee, John Ncsbir, and the anti-Tammany
candidate, Florence Scanned, nothing OF dIsordery
nature transpired except few street braws pc.
tween Jne ADMIRERS OF tGe opposing CanuluateS near
the polling places and the arrests Of perhaps score
OF repeaters. In some instances the latter sue
ceeded in aepositing their ballots, but
majority OF them were arrested before doing
SO and promptly lodged in the station
house. The adherents OF Florence Scanned were
conspicuous throughout the ward during the day,
and their wagers freely onereI on the success or
their candidates, were as freely taken up by his
opponents, Towards evening the voting became
more rapid, with O preponderance IN favor or NeS-
bit, which threw the Scanned men almost in hys-
terlcs, and Immediately there was rush made by his
frln lda frntn ri. fhn Unf-
Ing boxes. At this time occurred the climax,
Barney Aaron leading the army OF repeaters, and as
MS familiar countenance appeared at each polling
place, both he and his followers were at once spot
ted. and large majority OF tnem taken IN charge
by Tho detectives VINO were stationed at the boxes
Not less than ten OF AaronS friends were captured
while endeavoring TO vote under various aliases.
Judge McCunn kept open court throughout the
day and released the following alleged repeaters:-
Wallace Hennion, James Gould, John W. Phillips, A.
+. Wezner, William Pearsa and Hugh Dolan. These
men having given as their residence an uptown no.

In the Nineteenth and Twenty second wards the
amount OF Illegal voting which was carried on lar
surpassed anything OF the KIND heretofore heard OF
in those wards. The repeators kept quiet un nearly
midday wnen they commenced operations, and from
that time until the closing Of the polls at sundown

being apparently mere boys. Iney seemed TO have

The RepcRters.


These ubiquitous ""brds Of PASSAGE who OF every
election make their influence felt In every ward OF
the city, were not Idle yesterday. In nearly every
ward dozens OF them foated about awaiting their
opportunity to put in vote for their favorite cand
dates or at least those whose pocxetbooks were the
longest. The Twentieth Nineteenth, Twenty first
Sixteenth, Eighteenth Ninth and Eighth wards were
especially noted for the number OF repeaters. ln q
few instances they were detected IN the attempt and
arrested. Not O few cases occurred In which they
voted upon the names of respectable citizens whose
votes were refused when tney applied for the priv
lege OF exercising the franchise. The repeating was
not confined to the Tammany nominees only, but
was more or less encouraged by oil candidates for
0filco. Probably the greater number OF repeater5
were working on the west side Tor LedwIth and
Hardy especially. A gentleman conversant with
the district estimates that the former was backed
by 100 repesters and the latter by lao.

In England the crops are promising
better. The Australians are much insul-
ted at the demand upon Parliament to re-
imburse the Duke of Edinburgh for pres
ents made in that colony. A motion has
been made in the Provincial Assembly to
inquire into the value and personality OF
those presents. Prince Arthur it is to be
hoped, will behave better in Canada The
throne is not so firmly fixed in the colonies
as to bear the driving under it of wedge

and Edinburgh. By-the-bye the 'Domin-

finement in the Carmeite Convent u n
visitation she was discovered in dreadful
condition. She had been eonfued in a
dungeon for more than twenty years, and
was foppd ip ipdescribable filth and mise
Fy. The excitement of the populace was
so great that they demolished the building
and the other converts were preserved on
ly by military interrentiop. The Austrian
government has taken Up the matter and
the result will be to put the religions hou-
.ses under the supervision Of the law. The
ppiverg says the nun was insane If so,
the nuns were not the sufficient judges of
Insanity and certainly their treatment of
the malady was not of KIND to create
much confidence in their practice.

The Amnesty for political offences re-
Gently proclaimed by the Emperor Napo-
icon Ill, on the occasion of the hundredth
anniversary of the birth of Napoleon |, has
been received with great approval by the
Paris journals. The course of the Empe-
ror, it is asserted, is the manner in which
Government acts which is strong enough
to fear nothing from its adversarics, and
which has just revived its popularity by
entering into new and harmonious rela-
tions with the country Attention is call
ed to the fact that the decree of amnesty,
as far as. it applies to press and political
offences, is countersigned by all the minis
tiers. That circumstance it is alleged,
proves that she measure was deliberated
in Council. The amnesty is therefore
considered as a manifestation of the line of
conduct the Ministry intends to pursue
This act Of grace, it is is contended, is the
compliment and the best commentary on
the Imperial message aud the Senatus

laws will be literally applied.

THE INCEPTION OF THE CRIME.


Bonner has been living at Altoona lately, where ne
became acquainted with Bodenburg, to whom no
doubt he communicated the knowledge OF Peightal's
wealth, and the two resolved TO roo nim. Vita tnls
intention they came to Huntingdon about two weeks
ago and loitered for several days IN the neighbor
hood OF r3Ightals house. Finding that they could
not ro- the old man, they then determined to XIII
hun and the whole family. II necessary. Intent on
this, the two men, Bohner and BodenburQ came to
huntingdon from Altoona on Monday last and
walked out to Peightals place. They loltered
around the station ut Pleasant Grove until dark
when they went to the house Of Pegptal and
their supper and allowed them TO sleep
IN the barn. Ia the morning they left the
house. but fingered In the vicinity. Gong over to
the railroad they engaged In conversation with the
laborers WORKING upon It.. On Tuesday night they
again went TO the house OF Pelgnta, who gave them
their suppers, and according to one Of the prls
oners, allowed them TO sleep In the house. In the
morning he gave them their breakfast. when they
again went away, and did not return until evening,
when the murder was committed.


The Peghtas were IN the habit OF eating supper at
a rather late hour for the neighbornood In winch
they lived. On Wednesday night last they were eat
ing supper In the kitchen Of the bouse at The usual
time all unconscious OF their Impending doom. The
poured out, while Mrs. peightal was en-
gagged IN pouring out her own. A dish OF
potatoes boiled with the skins on, was upon the
table; the old man mad just taken one on his plate
when the report Of pistol broke the silence and the
old man fell dead. Then another. and the boy was
usnered into eternlty. Mira. Peightal must have
Jumped up and endeavored 10 escape ana been cut
down win hatchet and afterwards snot when the
pistol had been reloaded. The work OF blood being
accomplished the murderers began their search for
plunder.


Tney AT frst broke open a chest and then bureau
which stood in the parlor, adjoining the Kitchen In
this bureau they are supposed TO have found the
money some $1,000 in all, about 81, 600 OF which
once divided and portion or the coin. A muslin
bag was found on the door which bore very plainly
the Impression OF the money. Ine coin, TO nave
done this, must have been packed in very closely.


PREPARATIONS TO BURN THE BODIES


u Is supposed that as soon as they had secured
the money they made preparations TO burn the
bodies and the building. For this purpose they
gathered all the bedding that was down stairs, to2e
ther with some old clothing. They now went to the
barn and brought TO the house q large quantity OF
straw, which they placed over the bodies, then,
covering the whole with the bedding and clothing,
lighted the mass. They tnen put down the window
blinds TO prevent the hight from being seen; but this
act under the providence OF God. was the means OF

being seen outside also prevented the draught from

Issuing from the door tney called TO me family, but
finding that they were locked, supposed the family
to DO absent On visit to some neighbor They then
proceeded 10 force open the doors, which was easily
done, and here terrible sight met their astonshed
gaze Lying on the noor covered with the burning
mass, were the bodies OF the Old man. his wife and
the boy. They raised the alarm and extingushed

Above tue middle OF the body neither was burned.
Mrs. Pelghtal was not burned mucn, but had bled
profuscly. The faces OF all three were considerably
disdgured.

tirely through and lodging in the window Sill back

THR COURSE PURSUED BY THE DISCOvERERS OF THE


MURDER.


At first the men who discovered the bodies had no
idea as to who had done thelkllllng and were at q
loss what to do. On making some inquiries 1t was
discovered that two men had been seen lurking in
the vicinity for two or three days. ana that day
IN particular Suspicion at once fastened on them
as the perpetrators or the crime, and Q messenger
was despatched to Huntington to see If any trace
could be found OF them there lie arrived at Hun
,Ingd0n e. about twenty minutes before i0ur O'Clock


ON making inquiry at the railroad depot at hunt
ingdon il was discovered that two men answering
the description given had taken the train ut half
past three O'CLOCK that morning for the West. Their
conduct At Huntingdon had attracted considerable
attention. They were at the depot hour before
the arrival of the train and seemed very nervous,
asking four or five times how long IL would be before
on the front car and ran through the train to yet
into the sleeping Not having tickets for this,
however, they were prevented from entering.
THE ARREST.


The messenger from Pleasant Grove arrived Just
Ave minutes alter the departure OF the train. tel
AT Altoona TO arrest them. An answer was soon
received that the arres, had been made. Word was
then sent TO the CHEF OF Police bring them TO
Huntingdon by the first train.


The request was compiled with and the prisoners
arrived a. Huntington about noon on Thursday.

for them on their arrival.

were taken In charge by the Sheriff and strong
posse. The largo crowd IN waiting was IN fevcrsh
| state OF excitement Cries OF Lynch them; Lynch

town, who were very indignant at the taint which
4 the murder would put upon their nationality, were
/ provided with ropes. and nothing but the nrmncss
OF the law officers saved the wretches. In the midst
/ OF all the excitement the two murderers walked
| quietly along with their heads down, not daring TO
meet the gaze OF the violent men who were eager
for their lives The jail Ia situated about 150 yards
from the depot And this fact together with the then
| uncertainty as to their guilt saved them from as q
violent death as that of their victims.

The two men, giving their names Gottlleb Bohner

that the citizens of Newtown do endorse il.
notwithstanding this newspaper, supposed to
represent the public sentiment, as newspapers
generally are, approves the act, and seems to
give the item merely for the sake Of sanction

credit to any town to uphold such lawless, in
dec -n', ""'Wu'ily conduct. Yet this paper calls
IL. .lcritor gentleman"" and styles
his mode Of punishment ""iust retribution. -
In the first place, what was done was contrary
to law; it was highway robbery. In the Sc
cond place, it was wrong to the woman, and
In the third place it was cowardly and vulgar.


In saying what we do we have no desire
to exOncrate the negro. What she did was
mean, and could have been redressed by law.
But it was nothing to compare to the conduct
of the gentleman. Leaving her, woman,
in the condition she was, in public thorough.
fare, was not dsgracing her, because she could
not avoid it; but ifit did not disgrace the man
who reduced her TO that condition, the public
morality of that town needs reconstructing bad.

would have consigned the man to the peniten-

would not have consigned him to more terri

in putting up our lands for sale In our exchanges,
especially IN Middle Virginia, we see Immense tracts
get up 70 be sold IN one body; This must generally
in a country overnowing with funds. but much more
certainly in section as poor as Virginia. Indeed,
where such mode OF selling would be continued.

enough for he same purpose.


turn and yet we do not seem to realize the fact that
the big estates have gone with It. People don't
vate 1t and 1t will bring them into debt No one
will purchase large tracts except on speculation,
and he viii not give much for land with that object
In view.


we advise our people that have to sell to dispose
of but little will meet their most urgent present
necessities. We trust that things win soon he ar

~ Public Opinion must Enforce Law. %
= The murders and outrages committed by
the bloody miscreants who call themselves
the Ku Klux have become alarmingly fire.
quent in this State The houses of Union
men have been broken into in the; dead of
night and themselves, and sometimes their
families, murdered in cold blood. Union
men haye been driven from their homes be-


cause they dared to vote for the right.
Hundreds of citizens have been prevented
from voting at all by the threats of these
midnight murderers. Their atrocities were
carried so far as to render legislation neces-
sary and bill passed the Legislature max
ing the act of going disguised felony. The
act and the proclamation of the Governor
in relation, thereto, win be found in another
column. 1t is worthy of the high moral
qualities of Gov. Holden and evlnces his
regard for the supremacy of the. law. But
there are times when the law is powerless
to redress injuries. In communities which


are controlled by evil men the guilty are
often shielded from punishment Then the
law becomes powerless for punishment, the
innocent suffer and the guilty escape. In
such cases the good must not be left to the
mercy of the bad. They must protect them
selves, for in so doing they protect the good


of the State. The villain who enters a


mans house to steal away his property
can be shot and the act is sanctioned by
the law. How much more, then, should


the life of that man be forfeited who in the
dead of night attempts to rob another of
his life If the law is too weak TO protect
those who abide by its rules, they will pro-
tect themselves. In such cases the old
Mosaic law of ian eye for an eye and a
tooth for a tooth will again become the
law of the lamb We have ever been op-
posed to Lynch law and are so.still. The law
and public opinion should be, sufficient to
check and subdue individual or organized
crime But when the men whose social
influence should prevent crime, sympathize
with il, and foster it by their commendations,
when the law is rendered by them power


less to punish the guilty then the good


should protect themselves by every means


in their power, for ""self preservation is the
| first law of nature"" gh4aia1 gaiiislaa
The consequences of such a state of socie-
| ty are too horrible to contemplate. Let


every man, whatever may be his political
| opinions, perform the first duty Of ever good


citizen support the laws Of Of i bis country.
Let all attempts at terrorism or murder be


met with the Indignation of every man


Let those men, who may be SO situated as


to WELD influence, use it for the maintenance


OF peace and good order. Then will they


have done their duty as citizens, as men and
as Christians. ,,,....-.. s.,, ..-.,8 Is,"

A Battle In Kentucky.",,"On Saturday evening last, about 3 o'clock, q
terrible fight commenced on the public square,


in the town of Somerset, Pulaski county, and
lasted until the parties had exhausted their
ammunition. Three men-Todd, Daulton, and
William Pleasonts-were killed, and one man,
James Pleasonts, desperately wounded. About
twenty men engaged on each side. The
difficulty originated over the whipping of a man
by the name of Cooper by party of Regulators.
This man Cooper, who lives somewhere on Fish
ing creek, below Somerset, is said to be q bad
character, and was short time ago taken from
bis house by party Of men, at night, and
severely whipped. Aterward he armed himself
and made war against number of his nsighbors.
whom he accused of whipping him. One man
was shot by him, and several others taken
unawares and knocked down with his iron ram
rod, and severely beaten. He also swore out
warrant against number of persons, and had
them arrested. Saturday last was the day fixed
for their trial: On the morning of that day
Cooper and his friends came into the town of
Somerset in wagon, concealing their guns
under some hay in the bed Of the wagon Tbe
trial of the parties who were arrested was post
poned until the succeeding Wednesday. The
quarrel commenced between the parties and con-
timed to grow warmer and more aggravating
until three o'clock in the afternoon, when it
eliminated in regular pitched battle. 1t seems
that in the progress of the quarrel one of the
parties challenged another 10 shout for JET.
Davis, which was done. The fight then COM
menced in desperate earnest, being brought on
by the anti-Lynch party making the first often
sive demonstrations. The anti-Lynchers, under
the leadership of man named Logan, retreated
out the Mt. Vernon road, about two hundred
yards, to where they had sent their wagon, in
charge of one of their comrades, procured their
guns, returned to the public square, and made q
furious attack upon their opponents. Both
parties stood their ground, it is said, without
f1nching until the fight abated by mutual con-
sent, both parties being without ammunition.
Town Marshal Shepperd, with posse of three
men, endeavored to prevent the fight, but the
parties were too numerous, and he finally had to
take himself and posse to safe distance, and
allow the desperate riot and difficulty to proceed.
Over one hundred and fifty shots were fired, and
the shouts and yells of the combatants are said
to have been almost deafening. The complexion
of the whole affair is very unfortunate, uncivil-
lied and barbarious.


| Of the family of Pleasonts who were engaged
in it, one cousin was killed on one side, and
another was mortaly wounded on the other,
having his skull broken from blow, and some
very bad cuts on his neck and chest. The Dali
tons also divided in the fight, and also the Bur-
tons.


| On Wednesday last, one Of the hostile parties
which had recruited its forces until they
| numbered forty men, approached to within two
miles of Somerset, but we're warned by the citi-
| zens of the town not to come in, under penalty
of being fred upon. The other party was also,
on the same morning, in the reighborhood OF
the town, and received like message from the
citizens, and both parties retired. So much
apprehension exists in the town of Somerset that
the whole population is in arms 20 prevent the
recurrence of another such difficulty as the one
which took place on Saturday last, and Pulaski
county is enjoying reign of anarchy and terror.

The naturally navigable waters OF the Mississippi
valley aggregate nearly 1700 miles. Water has It's
currents and has trade. But those OF the latter
do not run with the formers for in the main the
great outlet Of trade Is northeast by the lakes Erie
Canal and Hudson instead of South, by the Gulf OF
Mexico. 1t is now proposed to open a way across
the Virginia mountains broad and deep enough to
drain the Mississippi valley due eastward into
the Chesapeake not OF water OF course, but OF pro-
duce. The old James river and Kanawha
Oanal-aready finished half the distance
was TO connect the waters Of the James
with those OF the Kanawha. q tributary OF
tne Ohio; but the proposed canal is to
be Of q capacity equal at least TO the great Erie
Canal of New York. Such canal, by supplying 400
miles Of the route, would open the way for trans
portation without transhpment between the ocean
and IT, 900 miles OF already navigable inland waters
The project is to be brought before Congress this
winter, and 1t is expectedthat it will be petioned
for by citizens OF every part OF the Union. Great
considerations OF national defence are said by mill
tary men to justify it, but the grand commercial
hypothesis is the manner in which 1t would effect
the grain interest OF the West and the bread interest
OF the East. Itappears by Official reports OF United
states engineers charged with surveys, &C., OF ro
posed national canals in the Northwest, that the
dangers Of lake navigation the numerous tranship-
ments, the necessity OF much railroad carriage and
the closing Of navigation 1ve-twelfths Of the year.
besides the heavy tells the Erie Canal, oil make
the cost of carrying Western grain to the seaboard
by existing routes enormous. For example:-It Is
reported that from Dubuque Iowa, TO New York the
freight and charges amount to slxty-eght cents q
bushel The effect Of this is that before the producer
gets to market he has spent the bulk Of his grain
in paying the way. On the other nand. the Eastern
purchaser, Of New England and New York, has to
pay whatever price the demand imposes upon an
article already enhanced by such heavy way charges
Now, 1t is claimed, upon very careful anaogies and
all other data, that the sixtyeight cents might be
reduced half or even three-quarters, il this great
Atlantic canal were opened, so that western grain
could reach New York, Boston, &C., through the port
OF Norfolk The far West, indeed, must now pay
as much to get grain to Chicago as they would
then pay to get it to the seaboard.
The reduction OF carrying cost would natur-
ally divide itself equally between the
consumer and producer, so that while the New
Yorker would get his bread cheaper the Buckeye
would sell his wheat higher. Indian 'vorn now
unknown as bread out Of ths country, though freely
eaten by our foreign population could then be sent
abroad cheaply enough to make 1t preferred bread
stun for the poor of Cnristendom, with the effect OF
virtually bringing into new existence an American
export that might rival cotton itself in time as q
ource Of national wealth.


Another great work proposed is the Coosa cotton
route, from Mobile up the Alabama river thence up
the Coosa river till within thirty miles Of the south
bend Of the Tennessee river; across this thirty
miles ship canal; thence up the Tennessee and
Its longest branch. the HostoD, TO the borders Of
Virginia, near Saltville; from Saltville to Lynch
burg (aready uaversed by railroad), double
track road, ut for heavy freights,y and at
Lynchburg striking the Atlantic water route
above mentioned to New York.


The railroad part is 176 miles long; all the rest
water. This route would nearly 1000 miles OF
the present route which cotton takes from the cot
ton centres in New York ana the other cities North,
and also the dangers OF the Florida Keys, for which
insurance alone Is two and half per cent on ship
and cargo.


The advocates OF these works claim that they are
more truly national than the Pacific railways, Of
which they are the necessary complement. II, as
half the thoughtful commercial men Of Europe fear,
and the HERALD has often ably maintained, the
trade of the world to abandon the routes OF Vasoo
de Cana and Magellan and cross the bosom OF the
great republic, the proposed water route from the
genial mouth OF the Chesapeake to Omaha, at least
northwardly to the verylbaseiof the Rocky Noun
tains would give the country an advantage In
absorbing the India trade Of all nations immensely
greater than railway transportation the whole dis
tance between the oceans.

HOUSE AND FARM.

From the Charlotte Democra.",,"


Grasses for the South.--Eyergreen Grass.
Mr.. EDITOR If you will avail yourself
of short ride into the country adjacent to
Charlotte you will be gratifed to see the
rapid strides that our farmers are making on
the road to prosperity. A noticeable feature,
chief among which is the great changes
brought about doubtless by the results of the
war and its effect upon labor, and which to
me affords the greatest evidences of advance
ment is the large quantity of Clover now
used. Indeed, on plantations which former
ly boasted acre lots, we notice large green
fields comprising many acres, which, while
adding much to the quality of beef butter
and milk, supplies the wheat grower with
the best and cheapest fertilizer for that and
other small gram.


1t has been my privilege to use your col
umns several times urging our people to SOW
large quantities of clover seed, while it has
been scarcely two years since my attention
was called to the benefits flowing from SOW
ing Orchard Grass, and you will remember
then how used my feeble efforts in short
article devoted to the encouragement of its
growth. Since that time have seen many
pretty lots of Orchard Grass which success
fully resisted the effects of the drouth, which
convinced me that, Orchard Grass is well
adapted to our section. ~
Now, Mr.. Editor, while would not say
one word against and much in favor of the
continuance of the cultivation of such grass
es as those named, and while am satisfied
that they are tine best grasses which have
had trial in our section, and that they are
remuneratiye both in supplying food for
stock and vegetable mould for land, l do
not think am detracting one iota from
their usefulness if introduce to your read
ers another species of grass which has
claimed my attention for the past few
months.


During the months of May and June,
when passing through the country near
Lynchburg, my attention was called to green
sods which covered the fields which before
the war we're nearly exhausted by the cul-
ture OF Tobacco. Persons living about here
who are familiar with that section will find
difficulty in noting any difference in the
characteristics of the SOIL climate and the
main features of the country, except that
cotton is raised there only in garden patch
es, if at ALL while tobacco has heretofore
been the staple prnduct, Surely it is not a
grass growing section, nor has the soil more
lime in 1t than our own. The land is very
drouthy and has suffered much by contihu-
Gus cultivation of most ,exhausting crops.
But the farmers of that section are recuper--
ating their lands rapidly by the use of grass
es, and in lieu of the bald hills which once
stared at you on every side, l notice that
Glover, Orchard Grass and Evergreen Grass
is rapidly sodding the hills, thus presenting
q most pleasant prospect to the eye. ,.l..
This Evergreen Grass to which l wish to
call attention seems to be the favorite there,
and am induced by its successful career to
give you its main features, so that if any of
our people feel any inclination to profit by
it they may have time yet left them in which
to do so. Evergreen Grass is easily gotten
rid of by the plough Evergreen grass, of
all grasses, will take hold on the thinnest
land, though like every species of herbage
it must have some soil. 1t withstands more
effectually the heated terms of the year and
suffers less from drouth than any grass
known. 1t is the first green thing to show
itself in the Spring and the last of all grasses
to yield to the rigors of winter, hence its
name. If not pastured too close it will re-
seed itself for number of years, certainly
no less than seven years. and il properly at
tended to, for much longer period. 1t is
eagerly sought after and eaten by horses,
cattle and hogs, and its fattening qualities
are not excelled by any grass. 1t grows
higher than the highest clover, hence is
easily moved and makes excellent hay. 1t
has two growths each year, Spring and
Fall. The seed should be sown in the
Fall, at the rate of one bushel per acre, on
wheat land and slightly brushed in. can
not think that the cost will be more than
One-third or one-fourth that of Clover Seed,
while the soil for its production if well pre-
pared need not be the richest. Having once
set your land in this grass, the seed obtained
from it with but little difficulty will enable
you 10 cover every field on your place which
needs rest and recuperation. ....


learn that parties near Charlotte who
have had their attention called to this spe
cies of grass, by gentlemen who have seen
it growing, have been induced to order it
through the druggists. propose sowing
fifteen bushels on land which am seeding
In oats From what have seen and heard
respecting this species of grass, incline to
the opinion that Evergreen Grass can be
successfully grown here, and that it can be
made powerful agent in restoring our
worn out lands to their former vigor and
WORTH 4r4.. ., .Il i liaA-.t. %


Hence, Mr. Editor, think it advisable
iOr our farmers to sow some seed of the
three varieties of grass mentioned, and after
having fully tested all to continue with that
from which most benefit was derived and
which seemed to suit bes, our climate and
soil.

",,"The Last NH ours of the Il EOrtieth Congress.


Whatever the Fortieth Congress does must
be attended to within the next seven days and
half. Many important measures are in a fair
way to fail offs passage, and some of them GER
tainly will. Among those that viii certainly
go over is the Civil Service bill, and among
those that will probably be passed by is Gen.
Schenck's bill for strengthening the public
credit. Both ought to pass, but the former
has had to rely for its support chiefly upon the
newspapers, and the latter, pledging the gov
ernment to pay its creditors in gold where ID
has promised to do so, is, it would seein' 700
straightforward to meet the views ol Congress
men. 1t is incompreheDsible 10 everybody OUT
side of Congress that some Dill OF the klnd was
not passed wears ago, but it looks now as if we
should be obliged to rely upon tho Forty-fir
Conpress to assure the world that the govern.
ment ofthe United States is not dishonest
bankrupt. We hope to be disappointed in this
matter.


Many thousands ofpeople would have been
extremely gratified to see Mr.. Lynch's bill for
the gradual resumption of specie payments
passed at the present session. L has gained
the support of more sound financiers than any
other similar measure Of the session, as the
best practicable means of reaching a result
held to be desirable by all except a few vision
ary people who have Joined in the pursuit OF
that ignis .tat,tus, Gen. Buffers irredeemable
paper dollar. There can be little doubt that
whatever be the fate of Mr.. Lynchs bill this
session, it will command strong support in
the Congress that assemblies on the 4th of
March.


No bill funding the public debt or revising
the tariff has ghost of a chance this session.
The mammoth bill of 100 pages, revising and
digesting the internal revenue laws, has been
passed by the House, but fails in the Senate
for lack of time. The omnibus Pacific railroad
bill, giving away to railroad monopolsts public
property enough 20 produce the revenues ofan
average empire, is not understood to be in a
prosperous condition. Neither probably are
the various schemes for ""untying the Pres-
dent"" like the repeal of the civil tenure act and
the act protecting the Chief of
the Army from the too absolute control of the
Executive. The people will not mourn over
either of these failures, and they will reconcile
themselves to the defeat of some measure oi
great public utility, like the Niagara Ship Ca
nal, in consideration that il is a part of the
same economical policy that defeated various
movements to increase salaries and to subsi-
die railroads and carried through a measure
to restrict the franking privilege to the written
autographs of members. Not SO the bill that
has passed the Senate recognizing tie Judi
ciary, providing for the appointment Of nine
circuit judges and one additional associate JUS
ice Of the Supreme Court. This has the ap-
pearance of attempting to make some provis-
ion for ten of the hundreds of gentlemen who
will be disappointed in their Cabinet aspira-
tions.


The most serious failure of the Fortleth
Congress seems at present likely to be in what
may be called reconstruction measures, viz
the constitutional amendment establishing i'm.
partial suffrage and the various bills for the
restoration of Virginia, Mississippi and Texas
to the Union. OF the latter measure there is
hardly hope, while the constitutional amend
ment is tossed back and forth between the
House and Senate and has finally gone to a
conference committee. The amendment of
either the House or Senate would secure the
negro in his right to vote and hold office, but
the quarrel is now as to the nature of the inn
partial qualifications for suffrage. The Pacific
coast is jealous of the Chinese and Rhode
Island of the Irish. They desire that the
terms of the amendment shall not be such as
to forbid the exclusion of these classes from
the polls. But there is still possibility that
the amendment agreed upon may be
liberal one. If il fails the case is not hope
less for the Republicans will have two-thirds
majority in both branches upon the assembling
of the Forty-frst Con gress"

following statistics of the Maine Central road
from the reports to the stock holders who met
at Waterville yesterday.


The Directors state that though the busi-
ness OF the country through which the road
runs has not been especially active the past
year the gross receipts have increased. No
accident or casualty and no injury to persons
or material injury to property has occurred.
Expenses have been reduced, and nett gain
accrued amounting to 33.00626. over 1867 The
directors have constantly improved track and
rolling stock, maintaining both in first class
condition. The Directors have executed a
mortgage of the road secured by $1,1O0.OOO
worth of bonds, but have withheld the bonds
from the market thus far, believing it may be
desirable TO change the amount of bonds to be
issued under certain conditions and restric-
tions. The Newport and Dexter railroad has
been so fnr completed that trains are running
under direction OF this company. The lease OF
this road for $4,000 has been drawn and ready
TO be executed according to your votes. The
Somerset road 1t is believed, 20 far as the first
division Is concerned, from its connection with
this road in Waterville to Norridgewock win
be opened for use this year. Since the last
meeting il has been agreed by the Board to
subscribe $4,000 toward the completion of the
Somerset road, subject TO your approval,
which will secure TO you fair share of the
traffic of Somerset county and eastern Frank
lin county. Ii is expected that arrangements
at no distant period, will be entered into by
the Directors Of this company and the Belfast
and Moosehead Lake company who have To-
Gated their road and are rapidly grading it,
This company is now connected at its eastern
terminus with the European and North Amer
lean railroad.


The Treasurer states the earnings of the
road above expenses were $2l3443 60. Fund
ed debt of the company is 81, ,43l OSO, of which
$l06,2 $50 is payable in capital stock. Earnings

grants Against Fraud-Savings Bank for


Kmgrants.


The cruel hardships and losses to which emf.
grants were subjected during the year 1887 and sub
sequenty up to 1s41 imperatively demanded the
interpretation OF their friends, the laws ut
tery insufficient for their protection against 0ppres-
sion, extoron or even violence and led in the latter
year to the formation Of the 'Irish Emgrant Society
OF New York, which the 2sth OF April 1874. re-
ceived charter from the State Legislature. The act
set forth Its objects. They ITO AFFORD advice
Information and protection TO emigrants from Ire
land, and generally to promote their welfare""


Although great deal had been accomplished by
the benevolent efforts Of individuals previous to this
time 1t was not until the formation OF the society
that the crying evil which 1t sought to remedy was
attacked with unity of action by men OF influence
and high social position. The society numbered
nineteen members when incorporated; 1t now num-
bers twenty-siX.


The following ls circular OF the society in 1852,
which applies as well to The present as TO that
date:-

high handed measure, taken the appointment OF
the proxies out OF the hands OF the Board OF

President, well knowing that the Board would
have appointed proxies friendly to the reelection
OF Malone and the interest OF the consolidated line.

Congress passed joint resolution, introduced
by Mr.. Lynch, and reported by Mr.. Eliot, to
repeal the tonnage duties on Spanish vessels.
The intent of this was to allow our vessels to
have the benefit of the Spanish reciprocal de-
cree of June. 1868, of which England and
other European nations so eagerly availed
themselves. As the act did not seem to have
accomplished anything, Mr., Lynch came on
here yesterday to see about the natter. He
found that in form the decree was conditional
like our act, and that our government had
lost the benefit of it by neglecting to take the
initiative. A consultation was had with the
Secretary of the Treasury, who decided that
he will issue his circular to collectors of Gus
toms directing them hereafter to collect no dis
eliminating duties on Spanish vessels entering
our ports. This circular will be sent through
the State Department to the Spanish minis
ter, and the probabilities are that in short
time our vessels in the Spanish West Indies
will be placed on footing with those of other
nations. The discrimination against us is now
one dollar ton in gold, and our tonnage en-
gagged in this trade exceeds that of all other
nations together. Washington Special to Bos-

Housn.-Last Saturday night, says the Stan
ford (Ky.) Dispatch, party of men went to
the house Of William King, who lives east of
Dix river, near PrOaohersVille, aud demanded
that he should give himself up. This he re-
fused to do, when they informed him that they
would have to burn him out. He still refused
to surrender, when they set fire to his house
and burnt it to the ground. Before the house
had burned sufficiently to compel King to leave
it to save himself, tho near approach of day
light caused the party to dsperse, and be
did not fall into their hands. What wac the
purpose of the men in taking King, it is not
known. But evidently. from the manner in
which they proceeded, it was to administer
some penalty prescribed by the ordinances of
Judge Lynch.


King has been guilty of some acts which are

his desperate resistance while an attempt
was being made to capture him by the Sher-
III oil Washington county and large posse
OF men, IN which one man was killed and


the Sheriff and several others were wounded
We, OF course, took the statement OF those


who went down from here TO assist in his
capture.


With regard 10 the details of the affair as
given us, they are doubtless substantially
truei but regarding the history OF Hilder-
brand and the motives which urged him to
take the course he has, we felt sure thero
must be another side TO the story. The facts
as related by those cognizant with his his
tory, show that he was driven to despera-
llon by the injuries received from those
Claiming TO be Union men, and that he has,
In measure, taken redress into his own
hands, with determination OF avenging his
wrongs.


AT the outbreak OF the war, in 1861, Sam


Hilderbrand and his brother, Frank Hilder-
brand, it seems, were accused OF stealing
from some of the citizens of st. Francois
county. A band of men were organized,
who captured Frank Hildebrand took HIM
out and hung him. They covered the body
in ravine. Sam Hilderbraud suspected
Flrman McllYaine, mere youth, and son of
MIR. Orville Mcllvalne, now OF this city, to
have been the leader Of the band who hung
his brother. He determined to avenEe his
brothers death, and discovering young Nc
llyaine at work In tue harvest field, cradling
wheat, he shot him dead. This occurred the
same season that his brother was hung.
Hildebrand then abandoned his home, and
became desperate leader on the Conieder-
ate side. His operations extended from the
Arkansas line 10 st. Francois county, and
many persons were killed by him during the
war. After his name became famous as a
rartizan leader, Governor Fletcher offered a
reward for his capture, on the charge oil
numbering McIlvaine, and rewards were
also offered by the citizens OF st. Francois
and Washington counties. A number OF
Hllderbrand's partizans united in offering
the reward 10 save themselves from being
dlstrusled by the Union men. But he eVaded
capture. He boasted that, with twenty feet
The start in the bush, he would bid defiance

About this time German company, Sup
posed to belong to Colonel Mueler's regiment,
posted at Cadet Station, followed in pursuit of
but the latter eluded them. They
went to the residence OF his mother-an old
woman = located on Big river, eight miles from
Blackwell Station, and asked for Sam Hilder-
brand, and, not finding him, they ordered the
Did woman and her daughter to leave the
premises They set fire to the house, and shot
! younger brother Of Hilderbrand, fourteen
years of age, named Henry, who was ordered
BY his mother to stay behind and save what he |
,ould from the destruction. The mon then took |
What pluuder they wanted, let down the fences |
and drove the stock away with them. Hilder- |
brand has, since the war, made one Of the citi- |
tens deliver up to him some of the cattle taken |
IN that occasion. The party then went to the
""a Grave Lead Mines and captured Washington |
dilderbrand and man named Landusky, and
aking them ont into lane about hundred
1ard7 from the shaft where they had been at
york, shot them. Washington fell at the first
lime, but Landusky was fired at nine times be-
ore he fell. This occurred on Friday, and |
Landusky was to have been married to sister
Of Hilderbrand 1.-THE same who was driven from |
he house with her mother) on the following
sunday.


These circumstances embittered the heart Of |
and he doubtless registered vow
% avenge what he regarded as the cold blooded
murder Of his relatives.


AT the close of the war he went to Texas, and
'eurned to 81. Francois county about year
lgo 10 poor circumstances. He gave out that |
le wanted to settle up his mothers estate, from
which be expected some three or four hundred
lollars. Poverty drove him to engage in hard |
work. He chopped cord wood for time OF |
Bush Tower Bend, some thirty miles below ST. |
Louis.


One day he went to De Soto. and friend |
who was with him asked Colonel Bill Fletcher |
I be would like TO see Hildefbrand. The Col |
mel replied that he would shoot him at sight. |
then tapped Fletcher on the shoul- |
Ter, and said he was the man. Fletcher, il is |
aid, forgot his brave words, and promised to |
ct Hderbraud alone, il the latter would do the |
ame by him.


The following incident is related: Since the |
var Hilderbrand was shot through the leg by |
lack Smith, and his wounds were dressed by o |
goman, who afterwards married q man who |
quandered all her means. He then left his |
wife and lived with her negro servant in Arkan-
Ias. Hilderbrand, sung with resentment at ths |
way in which the woman who attended to him
While sick was treated, went with few men,
ind, tying the man and negress together flung
hem into the river. For this act Hilderbrand |
vas tried and sentenced to be hung. Before the
ime of execution, two hundred men, clothed in
federal uniform, went to the jAiler and deman-
led that tho prisoner be given to them. The
ailer supposed the object was to lynch him, in-
aade his escape. Hilderbrand is described as
# tall, slender form, sharp features, gray eyes
nd red hair. He has a feminine voice, steps
B lightly as an Indian, and can clear a seven
all fence with the agility of deer. Like
icott's Rob Roy McGregor, he possesses bold
ess, sagacity and prudence, qualities highly
ocessary in war, which become vices when mis-
irected. His father was a farmer in rather
'ad repute, and his mother died Of grief after
be massacre of her family."

The company bad beautiful ride and a
splendid time. After the arrival of the train
at Portland, an impromptu meeting was called
to order by Hon. John McDuffee of Rochester,
N. H., who made Speech and then called
Judge Worcester the chair, who said:


Gentlemen: am obliged to you for the hon
or you have done me in calling upon me to
preside at this meeting; and you will allow me
in behalf of the delegations from Nashua and
Rochester, to express to the citizens of Port
land their grateful appreciation of the kind
ness and generous hospitality of which they
have been the recipients.


You will also permit me to express in their
behalf the very high qualification we have all
experienced in the evidence we have seen OF
the enterprise and successful energy of the
people of Portland. The city has recently
arisen like Phoenix from its ashes, with new
vigor, vitality and beauty, and the new enter
prise that has been the Immediate object Of our
visit, is renewed evidence of its citizens sue
cessful energy.


We have all had a most agreeable excursion
over your new Railroad, SO far as it is now
completed, to the town of Alfred; and you will
all please remember that Alfred is in the 1irec-
tion Of Nashua, Nashua of Troy, Buffalo, Chi
cago, San Francisco, Jeddo and Canton; and
that the new line of Railroad that you have
now in contemplation, is link in our chain
of travel and commerce which is soon to circle
the earth.

Mr.. Chairman and Gentlemen of Portland
I should do violence to my own feelings did ]
not express my hearty thanks for the unex-
pected, and may say unmerited attentions
which our delegation have received at your
hands, The remarks of Judge Worcester re-
fleet the sentiments and feelings of us all; and
as more formal testimonial to your kindness
and courtesy, gentlemen, permit me to offer
the following resolution:


Resolved, BY the citizens of Nashua and
Rochester present in the city of Portland on
the 10th and 21st days Of May, 1869, that we

& Rochester Railroad, to His Honor Mayor

prietors of the Falmouth Hotel, for the cordial
greetings, many attentions and generous hos
pitality which we have individually and collec-
lively received at their hands. And we pledge
to the city of Portland and to its public spir-
tied representatives on this OCCASION that we
will leave no energy unexpended and no effort
untried to complete those links of railway that
are only wanting to constitute the shortest and
best route between the commercial metropolis
of Maine and the commercial metropolis of the

by the visit of the gentlemen from Rochester
and Nashua, and thanking them for the inter
est they had awakened in behalf of an enter
prise which was des tined to be of such advan-

in the case Of Yerger, charged with murder
in Mississippi, and under trial by military
commission, came up for argument on the
morning Of the 14th inst, before Chief JUS
tice Chase in the United States Supreme
Court room. The petitioner was represented
by Messrs. Carlisle and Phillips, and the gov
ernment by United States Attorney General
Hoar.


The decision OF the Chief Justice in this
case has not yet been given.
This Yerger is what is known in ""chival-
ric"" Mississippian of the bowie .knife-derrln-
ger species.


Col. Crane, his victim, is said to have been
one of the brayest and purest of men and his
murderer was one of the most wicked and
blood thirsty of any on record. Had Yerger
been of Northern birth he would have been
lynched in true Southern style; as 1t is, his
fellow citizens have manifested their abhor-
ance of his crime, by sending boquets to his
cellsduring his confinement. The object
sought by this application for the write OF
habeas corpus is to get him out of the hands
of the military commission, in order that he
may be tried by the jury who applaud the
wretch for his act. 1t seems hardly possible
that Mr.. Chase will grant this request; but it
is impossible to say what effect his insane lust
for Southern support in 1872 may have upon
the judicial. mind.

debates in the Congress OF 1889 were in eager

up to find an excuse for Stewards accept

those who searched long and earnestly dis
covered that in the year 1922 under President Jack

hold on to Stewart for the Treasury. The story
about Boutwell, was doubtless manufactured by
people who desire to shove Boutwell, ahead by keep

false rumor was also circulated tonight to the effect
that a deuufation of New Workers. hal called unou
Stewart to urge him to resign and that Stewart

repeal yesterday have since changed their views,

fer inclosed by the Consul from another American

Cubans does not amount to more than ItVO i'on'
REGARDING these two statements the Consul writes;


The truth probably lies between the two extremes,
Ido not think the Cuban army amounts 10 @o,Uo
men but il is certainly more than l4OO' In another


mart of his dispatch Mr. Plumb says: From all that
con he oscertained there is not Cuban ma woman

with the insurrectiOn. Some OF them do TINS more

able TO hold out six months longer Spain will be com
PEELED to abandon the attempt to subdue them.


Discriminating tunnage duties are laid against
American vessels in the Spanish West Indian ports
Under our legislation, the same discrimination is

very lightly on them, while on our commerce the
tax is onerous, as the value of trade with Cuba
and Porto Rico more than equals that of all other
nations. By a royal decree, dated June 4,
1SCS, it was provided that the vessels
of all nations conceding equal privileges to Spanish
ships should be placed on the same footing as re-
CARDS tonnage dues. in her West Indian ports. Last
Winter, Mr.. Lynch Of Maine called the attention of
Congress to the subject, and the result the pas
sage Of law repeating prevlOns acts bearing the
subject and admitting Spanish vessels to equal privil

to US, and a circular was issued March 6,
by the Treasury Department. announcing the law.
The Spanish Government had removed the dscrim-
ination six months before. Great Britain, France,
and other nations had availed themselves of the
same. Our condition could not be complied WITH
according TO ""red tape"" because the thing was al
ready done. The Secretary of State tMr. Seward)
proposed to Minister Roberts, April Is, that
his Government be communicated with, and that on
a certain day telegraphic reply be arranged an

President would, on the same day, issue proclama-

lations with that Government Mr.. Lynch
presented the subject to the Secretary of
the Treasury whose common at once
cut the diplomatic puzzle. 1t was decided
to immediately issue instructions TO Collectors of
Customs announcing that, in consideration Of the
decree of June last, relieving American vessels OF
the discriminating tax. and in accordance with the
late law hereafter such tax duty will be levied
on Spanish vessels entering ports Of the United
States Upon communicating this fact to tho Span
ish Minister there be no doubt that our shipping
will be placed in the Cuban and other ports upon
footing with those of the most favored nations. The
tax is 81 tun in gold and the loss to our merchants
is about 100000 annually.


plan is being matured at the War Department to
draw the supplies for the Indian Bureau from the
Commissary and Quartermasters Departments, using
the supplies now on hand in those Departments and
thus obviatIng the necessity of making purchases
in the open market except for such articles as are
not to be found in the Government stores. 1t will be
remembered that President Grant recommended the
transfer of the Indian Bureau TO the War Depart
ment but Congress declined TO accede TO his request
He has however, so manipulated the Bureau as vir-
tually to have accomplished his purpose, having
put an army officer at the head Of the Bureau and
secured the assignment of army officers as Indian
Agents.

bic by fine and imprisonment under the Internal
Revenue Act of 1854 amended 10y the Acts of 1866

however clearly the intention of Congress to limit

the House was called upon to correct the

in legislation. Such provision should not
have been put In an appropriation hill. The
reduction of the tax on whisky had worked

therefore, could we'll afford to nay its own
officers to do its own business. The fact that

with the larger collection of the revenue from

about taZes. about Offices about finance. and
about anything else.


MIR. Batter said that the question was
whether an enrolling clerk, by accident or

The Postal Telegraph Bill Defeated.


The House Committee on Post Oiices and Post
Roads decided to-day TO report adversely upon
Washburne's bill to construct postal telegraph line
between this city, New York and Boston. Previous
to taking this action the committee heard state
ments from MI. Orton, President OF the Western
Union Telegraph Company; Postmaster Burt OF
Boston, and Mr. Stearns, President of the Franklin
Telegraph Company. Orton, Of course. opposed the
BILL and submitted some further statements to show
its impracticability. Postmaster Burt gave 1t
as mis- opinion that the telegraph postal
system would work well, and that at
Boston, at least it could be carried outewithou any
Inconvenience to the department and with great
benefit to the people. Mr. Stearns was OF the same
opinion. The members Of the committee present
when'it was decided to report against Washburne's
bill were Messrs. Farnsworth, chairman Ferry
Lincoln, Lawrence OF Pennsylvania, Hill and John
son. The absent members were Messrs. Reader, w.
Clarke Lynch ana Fox. The chairman afterwards,
1t is sald, secured the appreciation OF the absent
members to what had been done in committee so
the report against the bill might be made to the
Mouse unanimously.


The FrnncO-Americnn Telegraph Cable.


Mr.. Charles G. Leigh, one OF the original incorpo-
rators in the bill enacted by the State Of New York
allowing the Franco-American company to lay q
cable directly between that State and France, ap-
peared before the Senate Foreign Relations Commit
tee this morning and made a long argument against
Senator Morton's proposition that all cable COM
panes be required TO obtain authority from Con-
gress He described his connection with the Franco
American enterprise, saying that he was prompted
to undertake 1t for the reason that he thought
1t unwise that the Atlantic Gable Com
pany should monopolze the business OF
sending telegraphic dispatches between Europe and
America, especially during war, when all the ad
vantage would necessarily be on the side OF Eng
hand. He though the tariff OF the Anglo-Amerlcan
Company too high, also, ana went to Europe to talk
with capitalists there with view TO ascertaiuing
their views in relation to getting up new cable
company that would have one Of its termini on the
Of the United States and transmit messages at
lower rates. He was very successful In his mission,
and on returning got charter from the New York
Legislature for twenty years, ana also charter
from the French government for an equal period
After accomplishing this much he had parted with
his interest in the PROJECT and therefore now came
before the committee without any more interest In
the matter than an ordinary citizen. He came be-
cause he deemed 1t would be unjust to the Franco
American company, after having made all ITS
arrangements-2,o00 miles ofscable having been man
ufactured. and the Great Eastern waiting to take it
on board-to exact any conditions from the capital
lists who undertook the work in good faith and for
the public good. Mr.. Leigh concluded his argument
by stating that for Congress at this uncture TO pass
bill forbidding the landing Of any cable without au-
thorty from that body would In effect be saying that
when the Great Eastern has taken on board her
freight she should not be allowed to land end OF
It on the shore Of New York. Would anybody deny
that New York Is the owner OF the land under water
al along her coast below low water mark out three
leagues into the sea Has she not right 10 allow
her own citizens to bring up from the depths OF
ocean cable and lay 1t on her own property Could
she put such property to better use and In doing so
does she do any injustice to her own citizens to sis
ter States, to the general government or to any in
terest except Of the monopolss who control the





encourages In this way capitalists TO embark in an
enterprise that must cheaper and facilitate the in
tercourse OF our citizens and government with the
governments and subjects OF the Old World. Even
supposng Congress to have the right to pass such
bill. it would be extremely unwse to do so; IL would
be simply compelling citizens to pay ten times
az much for conveying their thoughts to Europe
would be the cost with rival company estab-
lished. 1t would be attempting to chain
thought and ideas TO single channel. while new
avenue Is ready to be opened over the broad Allan
tic that would be accessible TO all and be acc0mmo
dating particularly to daily and weekly papers,
which are now put to such an enormous expense In
supplying the public with hourly news over the
cable MIR. Lelghs address was unexpected, as IL
was generally supposed that he was enlisted on the
other side of the question. lie protests however,
that he could not be so dis honorable, after selling
his interest In good faith, as 10 turn around and

he Rows in Blue came off last night, and
was, notwithstanding the unfavorable state
Of the weather, a grand affair, there being
from two 10 three thousand torches In line.
Owing TO some misunderstanding, the hrst
battalion did not arrive on the ground until
amer O'Clock, and the remainder not until
an hour later. The line was formed as iol-
lowsi Detachment Of mounted pollcei the
executive board Of the Boys In Blue, consist
ing Of the following gentlemen Col. VIM.
Penn Clark, Judge N. P. Cuppee and Messrs'
G. p. Blackmar, A. D. Willard, X. Thompson
and ID. L. Eaton, In carriages. Gen. A. A.

Georgetown brass band ut the head Of the |
ed regiment, Col. Chas. Fisher; 9th regiment,
Col. Blum; Sd regiment, Col. Geo. W. Hat
ton; 7th regiment, Col. VIM. Joice.
The line was formed and the order to march |
given at about 9:20 o'clock. The procession !
moved down d street to New Jersey avenue, !
up New Jersey avenue to street, where the
regiments were masscd until the entire street
was packed, the rear OF the column being
halted In New Jersey avenue.


While the procession was filing past Gen.
Grant stood looking out Of the window Of
one Of his parlors quietly smoking his cigar,
and when the procession had literally packed
the street for the entire square he came out
upon the steps, and the band struck up
""Han to the chief"" after which Gen. Grant
shook hands with the committee, thanking
them for the compliment, and spoke of the
appropriateness Of celebrating the birthday
OF Washington.


The procession then moved on through I
TO Sixth street, down Sixth to II street,
through II to Seventh street, past the resi-
dcnce Of Mayor Bowen, who appeared at his
door waving his handkerchief In response to
the cheers given him as the procession passed,
continuing down Seventh to Z street, through
L to Ninth street, up Ninth to + street, pass.
ing the Chronicle office, along T to Four.
teenth street, up Fourteenth to II street, and
along ii to Seventeenth street and down
Seventeenth, forming again In mass In Sew,
enteenth street, Speaker Colfax standing upon
his porch meantime. Col. Clarke then In
troduced Speaker Colfax, the Vice President
OF the United States.


Speaker Colfax then said he thanked then
for the compliment they had paid him In
calling upon him. They had ftly selected
the birthday OF him who was the Father oi
his Country to pay their respects to one who





teers, served II upon the blood-staincd field
He expressed the fullest faith that the ad
ministration Of Gen. Grant would equal theil
expectations, for 1t would bring peace, and
peace would be the protection of the rights
OF all. Congratulnting them that In ten day
they would witness the Inauguration, on tn,
portico Of the Capitol, of Gen. Grant, h,
closed by again thanking them for the visit
and the line was reformed, moving dow
Pennsylvania avenue TO D street, and through
ID street to Tenth, and thence into PeunsyI
yania avenue again, paying their respects I
the REPUBLICAN Office in passing. The hea
of the column was halted when It rcache
Four-and-a-half street, and at few minute
before IL O'Clock the parade was dismissed


When we state that as the head OF the co
umn turned into | street from New Jerse
avenue the rear of the line had not LEFT
street, the length of the procession can b
Judged. Everything passed of quietly an
harmoniously, and the demonstration wa
highly creditable TO the Boys in Blue.

letters"" has recently been published, in which
the Reverend P. M. with his inimitable hu-
NOR describes the origin and working of a la
Dor union organized under his direction at
the Corners. The union was not large one,
as there are but five mechanics of the Caucas-
ian race at the Cross Roads. Mr.. Nasty di-
rected the attention OF these men to the fact
that there was a negro engaged in plastering
a house near by, and asked them if they were
content to let an inferior race take the bread
out Of their mouths ia that way. They were
none Of them plasterers; but were none the
less eager to rebuke such presumption as
""nigger"" earning his living by trade. Mr..
Nasty restrained their ardor until he had or
ganized them into efree labor unyon, which
perhibited anybody from working at anything
which didn't jine it, and perhibited niggers
from jinin' it."" This accomplished, they
started for the house where the obnoxious
African was at work. What they did there
Mr.. Nssby may tell in his own words:


""On reachin' the house we halted, and
there our eyes rested onto site wich blarsted
'em. There wuz Niger, full.blooded Mig
ger, with cap onto him, and overalls, plas-
term away, whistln' and singin' (sumtimes
one, sumtimes another, and then agin both

anon the unthnkin' man of inferiority would
stop and execoot breakdown and laff to
hisself, SO that he Good be heard a mile. The
disgustin wretch displayed his groveln nacher
by drinkin' water out ov a bucket which he
he'd handy by him.


We made short work NV it. We informed

ganized yoonun, and that no one Good be

tin members thereof

such insolence Good not Nv course be tol-
Grated. We he'd stated the case to him calm
ly and dispassionately. We he'd informed
him Nv the laws we he'd made and this wreeh
deliberately defied us by insistin that he shood
go on with his work. Therwuz but one course
to take and we took it. We snaked the plat
form out from under him, we tore up his NOR
tar bed, we broke his trowell and other tools,
and notified him ofhshelly that any attempt
at resoomin work wood result in lynchin Of
him."" leIt9


The victim of this prejudice, after trying to
work as blacksmith's assistant and as a la
borer on the roads, and being driven from
each by the union, found himself and his fam
lily in danger of starvation, and to relieve
their hunger was guilty of some petty thefts.
Whereupon, as Nasby says:


""There Good be but one erdin to such
succession Nv crimes. The citizens were too
much incenced to await the uncertain acshun
Nv the law and they hung him at site. The
Corners will never tolerate Niger thcef in
their midst, no how""


Mr.. Nasby improved the occasion by pa
thetic harangue on the Sfruits OF radicalsm
and fanaticism,"" which mad brought the un-
well deserved by the Washington unions
whose foolish rtjudices have led them to at
tempt the exclusion of colored men from
their trades, and have thus done much more
to withdraw their organization from respect
and sympathy OF the public than the combin-
ed efforts of their enimies could have done in
long time."

BY CHARLES IinvER.",,"Now am fully persuaded that the horse
whip and the hair-trigger were far more
efiectual in suppressing these otfenses than

approached by humiliation and terror is
no redress at all and if we sounded the
depth oil public feeling, we should lind there
is a more coniemptuous sentiment for her
who has gained the damages than for him
who has paid them. AS / have said before,
The real hero IS the defendant; he has had
his Clark and he has paid for 1t. Two
thousand or three, perhaps, seem a good
deal to give for Irritation and a confidential

what dangerous dog he is what terror
he might be in a neighborhood-not to say
that he has cast shadow over whole life,

where he had promised fidelity and loyalty.

depend on men for their protection, here is
the case OF all others thsi calls for that pro-
lection. To accept these men in society, to
receive them in our clubs, TO make them as

disgrace on u.s. To shun the sharper and

went TO the sepulchrc, and dwells upon the


fact TINT they had prepared thcnselycs very
carefully for their mission, viz, cmbalmng
the dead body Of the Saviour. They brought
sweet spices and ointments with them, and
every thing necessary for their labor Of love.


so now do the tender hands OF women lay
floral offerings upon the collins OF their be.
loved dead and strew with flowers the graves


of those who have given up their lives In the |
service Of their country.


The women mentioned by Marx, as they |
were proceeding towards the sepuichrc, re. |
membcred that q large stone was rolled |
against the door Of tho sepulchrc, and they |


were thinking by what means Il could be re- |


moved. But when they approached tho |


sePulchre they saw the stone rolled away


and that the body Of tho Saviour was gone.
| Tho first lesson taught by this Is that God |
| puts special honor upon those labors OF Ills


people which put special honor upon Ills


Son.


Cold speculation asks what good would It


do to put ointment upon the body Of the


Saviour. The chief value OF the action Is


as q token Of affection and remembrance.


When the woman poured ointment upon the


feet Of our Saviour, the disciples found fault


with her, but Christ approved Of her action,


and said wherever this gospel shall be
preached there shall this action which she


hath done be mentioned


To be ment' oicd in the Book Of Col Il


special honor ""A book which Is read by the


devout Of all nations.


The action of these women In proceeding


to the scpulchrc to anoint the dead body Of


the Saviour will be told of them In oil Chris
tian nations until the object of their Election


and remembrance shall come In glory.


These tokens of affection for our Saviour
arc not to be substituted for sturdy nC.yity


In His SCI 'icc. Flowers strcwn upon the
| n nnmlpCt


In life. They are In such a case only


mockery. II Is when these tokens u! alice.


ton are associat with or follow services Of


practical utility that they have my value.


&c. ices rendered by the hand Of affection


are doubly precious.


The tccond lesson taught by our subject


Is. that God chooses to assoc 'tc our actiN Iy


with Ills special providcnCCs. We must nrt


take away the stone Uf ignorance, or the


stone OF mtcmpcraucc, or Of discussions In


the Church If we wish special blessings to


come upon us. When God says take ye


away the stone, 1t is our duty to obey nrd


trust to Him for what v II follow.


The third Lesson taught by our subject Is,


that "" We do what God gives us the power


to do toward IFS work, VIC may rely upon


II's intcrposition for what is beyond our


strength. We should not stop to ask who


VII roll us away the stonc. We must DO


all VIC can, and then what remains to be
done that Is beyond our power God viii do.


II God says roll away the stone, let us do
il, trusting to him. How short q time ii
seems since TO all huu N nappcaranccs liber,y
'as cntombed within the sepulchrc.


solemn political compact had rolled the stone
aErinst the sepulchre. The stone has been
b rolled away by the earthquake, and the an
! gels Of dellverance have raised the once en-
tombcd liberty, and freed her from the
shackles Of 81 Ivcry. So truth has been often
. entombod and as often miraculously dc.
, liycred. Let US perform the work which
c q, has given us each to do, especially works
n Of charity and lubors OF love, and God w'l


subsidzc for US all needed helps.

Last Saturday night party Of men went
to the house OF William King, who lives east
OF Dix river. near Preachersville. and de
manded that he should give himself up. This
he refused to do, when they informed him
that they would have to burn him out. He
still refused to surrender, when they set fire
to his house and burnt it to the ground. Be
lore the house had burned sufficiently to
compel King to leave it to save himself the
near approach of daylight caused the party
to disperse, and he did not fall into their
hands. What was tbe purpose of the men in
taking King, it is not known. But evidently,
from the manAer in which they proceeded, it
was to administer some of the ordinances of
Judge Lynch. s ss7 $ - ~


King has been guilty OF some acts which
are horrltying to the feelings of honest, up
right and humane citizens, and has thereby
Justly incurred not only the displeasure, but
the violent and undsguised hatred ofa large
number OF his neighbors, and probably mer-
ITS punishment which he will never receive
at the hands of legally constituted tribunals
OF justice. Still, it is unfortunate for the
reputation and fair fame of our country
abroad that this deliberate burning of his
house should have taken place, and we hope
10 publish no more such occurrences in fu-
ture. $500 55i.iiee .,ri ""a 80 81 -"

Reported Horrible Negro Outrage.


The Ecening @ar Of this city publishes to-day the
following story


Yesterday morning one OF those terrible outrages
winch I'm other parts OF the country where the peo-
Pile have less respect for the law is usually avenged
by the people lynching the perpetrator took place
near the northern boundary OF the city. 10 appears
that three OF the daughters OF clergyman
formerly wei known as the superintendent OF the
contraband camp at Twelfth and q streets and more
recently clerk IN the statistical bureau OF the Trea
sury Department have since the establishment OF
Howard University been pursuing their studies there,
with other white pupils, and residing at Kendall
Green Barracks. They usually took Boundary street
for their road leaving at about Fourth street. and
passing up the lane TO Mr.. Moore's house to a by
path directly To the University building. Yesterday
they left home about eight O'Clock and took the
usual road chatting cheerfully as usual, until they
reached the lane before mentioned. back Of the Old
Catholic burial ground, when a stalwart and very
black negro who had been lying IN ambush, sprang
out before them, and seizng the Oldest one, well
grown young lady OF about seventeen years, threw
her down. Her sisters, aged about thirteen and fifteen
years went TO her assistance and with sticks and
stones beat him to make HIM desist from his helllsh
purpose and added their screams 70 those Of the vic
tim 10 bring some one TO the rescue but they did
not succeed IN driving nim OF until he had com
mtted crime for which II Is To be hoped he will be
yet made to suffer- The young ladies, who are well
grown aud look much older than they really are,
made their way back to their fathers residence,
and he immediately gave information TO
Lieutenant johnson, who with some OF
his men went IN search of inc mlscreant,
but have thus far been unable 10 arrest him. al
though they have a clue which may yet lead to his
arrest and conviction.


In addition TO the above account of the Sidr
may add there Is some difficulty In getting at the
real sacts of the case The police authorities admit
the story of the outrage to be substantially true in
all but that the negro succeeded In accomplishing
the outrage. That part. they say is not true. He
was frightened away before accomplishing the hor.
ribe deed."

A. M. the officer returned TO Ascutneyvie with his
prisoner, where he confined him III a suitable room





for his preliminary trial. The unexpected brief space
of time within which the murderer was captured
after his deeds had been discovered, and the entire
absence OF diculty attending his and safe
hnement, both surprised and gratied the inhabl-
tanis, who already had become wild with excitement
over the tragedy which had but few hours before
transplred IN their midst.

PROPOSED REMOVAL OF THE CHARLEsTowN
NAVY YARD.-Among the many wise meas
ures that Mr.. Lynch is initiating at this ses-
sion of Congress is revival of the project of
uniting the navy yards at Kittery and Charles
town and carrying on the work of both at the
former place. The following is the text of the
resolutions offered by Mr. Lynch on Thursday


ResolUed, That the Secretary of the Navy be
authorized and directed to appoint commls-
sion consisting of three officers OF the navy
and two officers of the corps of engineers 70
examine and report at the next session oi
Congress-
First Whether the efficiency Oh the naval
service requires the maintenance OF Two navy
wards at points so near together as Charles
town. Massachusetts, and Kittery, Maine.
Second Whether the territory owned by the
Upired States at Kittery is ample in area,
| suitable in location and every way we'll adapt
ed to accommodate the work now carried on
at both yards, and for such extension as the
future demands Of the service will probably
require in that section.


Third The probable cost of extending the
yard at Kittery sufficiently to accommodate
the work now performed at both yards; the
probable amount which could be realized by
the sale of the site and permanent fixtures o.
the Charlestown yard, and also the probable
annual saving in expense to the government
which would result from consolidating the two
wards"

Two young girls, residing near Station
IA. on the Georgia Central Railroad, were
brutally outraged by negroes, some days
ago; and the crime was followed up by
one of the fends cutting off the arm of
his victim in revenge for the loss of his
own arm, which he alleged he had lost in
consequence of gunshot wound inflicted
by her father, who formerly owned him.


Information was received here yester-
day that two white girls, aged respectively
fifteen and thirteen years, daughter of IL
highly respectable citizen of Rockbridge
county, whose name we withhold for the
present, were most brutally outraged on
Friday last by two black 6ends, the old
est of whom is not more than sixteen
years, and the youngest but about fifteen.
We were unable to gather the full partic-
ssulars- of these fendish deeds, but from
what we could learn it appears that
the villains waylaid their victims not far
from the house of their parents, and ac-
,complished their atrocious purpose. One
of the scoundrels was captured Sunday
morning and lodged in Jail in Lexington.
The other was still at large Sunday even
ing, but the people of the entire neigh
borhood in which the outrages were per-
petrated are securing the country in search
of him, and he has probably been arres-
ted by this time. e.-Lynchbug Ne'cs, Au-
gust Oath.


The two negroes who outraged young
lady living at Front Royal few days ago
were taken from the Jail of that town by a
party of disguised men, about two o'clock
Thursday morning and hanged."

Leading Hotels and Arrest and Confession


Of the Woman RObber--Aiieged Receiver In

Skilful audacity OF crime couplea with crownlng
glory OF unparalleled success, have characterized
some late robberies at number OF the leading
hotels in this city. The robberies were perpetrated
IN the day time Diamonds, valuable jewery gold
watches and the costest grades Of feminine apparel
such as camel hair shaws and the finest fabrics q
rare and expensive laces, comprised the cat

the victims Of the robberies, were amazed
at the sudden and mysterious disappearance
OF their valuables Hotel propretors the reputation
Of whose houses was being damaged by the frghtfu
frequency OF these extended peculations, were in
wild maze or bewilderment. Detectives confessed
themselves sadly perpleXed. Persons deemed in the
slightest degree suspicious stopping at the hotels
the hotel attaches and servants and private servants
and visitors have been under the most careful and
unreaxng espionage. And yet the robberles con-
tnued, with no clue 10 their perpetratOr The late
robber1es to which we have referred began several
months ago. First in the list OF victims, as will be
remembered, was Assistant District Attorney Hutch
ings. Shortly after New Years his rooms
at the Everett House were entered during the
wife, and valuable cluster diamond pin and other
)ewery stolen. of the value OF S2.645. Shortly ar
terwards the rooms of Mrs. A. Il. Saler, at the
Coleman, were entered, and a coral necklace ana
diamond PIN and earrings and other articles OF the
aggregate value Of $4,000 stolen. Mrs. sherman,
stopping at the Fifth Avenue Hotel, close the
heels of the last robbery. had two camel hair
shawls, valued at $500 each stolen from her rooms.
A lady at the Albemarle aArobbed of So 600 worth
OF Jewelry, and another lady az the Union Place Ho-
tel was victimzed TO nearly the same amount. AS
stated above the robberes in each case were perpe-
rated in the day time, revealing alike most marvel

guilty party. desire 10 recover his stolen property

detective officers McGowan and McCarty, OF the
Twenty-ninth precinct TO assist him. These Officers
went to work with a will and with their customary
adroitness. They soon satisfied themselves that
the boldly successful culprlt was woman. To
fnd this woman was the next thing. After
sedulous process OF research ana inquiry they found
at various times stopping at the hotels where the
rObberies had been committed was middle aged
lady OF pleasing and polished address, and uniform

different name at each hotel. At the Everett House
she gave the name Of Mrs. Amelia b. Miller, at the
Fifth Avenue Hotel that Of Mrs. Conner at the Able

Brown, and so on, assuming new alias at each
stopping place. Having lately given up stopping at

The people OF Lonuon have to-day special reason
to thiaS over the subject Of the death penalty. A
man convicted or terrible Crime--ihe murder OF
his own niece-has died on the gallows Tor his
crime. The Christmas SONGS OF praise stu echo
through our churches: songs OF thanksgiving for a
Redeemer sent, songs that tell OF ""Peace on earth
good Will toward men;n and yet, almost whiie the
words are lingering on the Christians lips and the
echo OF their music falling on our ears. poor,
trembling, guilty wretch Is brought forth to die
before the eyes OF gaping crowd. What farce II
seems, when one contemplates this awful scene to
chant and preach OF Peace earth, good viii
toward men ~ However, let preachers preach OF
that Theirs mot ours be the duty TO reconcile these
oppostes; Christians singing OF good Will tow ard
men, while within their sight another ''Chrlstan""
dies for crime that would put the worst OF neads
TO shame. The following are the particulars Of


THE CRIME.

teen years. Tle facts OF the case are these--

after her, and on the way 10 her unce's house she
met cousin, to whom she made known the object
OF her journey. she said she was looking after ner
sister Mary, @nen her cousin replied, IN hali-jest-
in2 manner:-""ilzZy, you needn't look for Mary any
more, for father and Ger have relied and ne
has killed her; you had better come and take her
away % The child returned hone and informed
her mother OF what her cousin had told
her. The mother then went out herself in search Of
aer missing daugher, and on meeting the same boy
that ner younger daughter had met she asked hun

knew nothing about ner. lite later the father OF

Execution of Two Negroes in


North Carolina.

PARTICULARS OF THEIR CRIME.

SCENES AND INCIDENTS AT The GALL0WS",,"Baker and Thomas, TWO negroes condemned for
the murder Of cO0red man named Wade Ditcher
h Weldon about one year ago. were to-day privately
executed in accordance with the law.


HISTORY OF THE MURDER.


One Sunday morning in May just year ago the
quiet little town village Of eldon, in this county,
was the scene OF no ordinary excitement among the
resident freedmen. Wade Ditcher, young negro
fisherman, OF good character remarkable for honesty
and uprghtness, was found missing under clrcum-
stances peculiarly suspicious. He had not been
seen since the Saturday evening previous, and his
friends becoming uneasy, search was made for him
and inquiries as to his whereabouts instituted, but
without arriving at any definite information. Some
thought 1t probable that he had gone into the coun-
try spend the Sabbath, as his fishing canoe was
found moored where he generally left It, The entire
day, however, passed into eternity and an anxious
night among Ditcher's friends followed with
no news OF the missing man. except the cir
cumstance that he had been seen late on Saturday
night with two or more negroes, with whom it was
ascertained he had been gambling Freedmen col
lected large numbers discussing in their peculiar
way the strange absence OF Dtcher, and when it was
discovered on Monday morning that his dshing boat
had been loosened from its moorngs on Sunday night
and drifed down the river and that one OF his oars
only was found in the boat If to give the impress
SION that he had been drowned, they shook their
heads gravely and at concluded there mad been
foul play somewhere. Naturally impulsive and ex-
citable, the freedmen now arrested negro named
Jim Thomas, who mad been seen In Ditcher's COM
pany on Saturday night, on the presumptive evil
dence that he must know something OF the missing
man. 1t had become the general belief that Ditcher
was murdered, and some inadvertent remark
dropped by Thomas strengthened this belief, and
Implicated, In their minds, Thomas with the murder.
Let the impression once become established among

II among them, and, with sort OF superstitious
idea Of ""blood for blood"" they will hunt
and quickly bring HIM to Jdstice Thomas was
Taigned before magistrates court number Of
witnesses were summoned, and testimony ELECTED
that Wade Ditcher had been gambling on Saturday
night with Jim Thomas and Gus Baker that the
two latter were winning his money, and that Ditcher
had been seen at late hour Saturday night under
the railroad she'd but he did not go home at all that
night. Nothing eliminating suspected parties was
proven, and the case was dismissed until further
developments. The gambling had occurred in
Q portion OF a apidated hotel which had been
chiefly Inhabited by negroes for some months.


DISCOVERY OF THE DEAD BODY


With redouoled zeal the negroes continued to
ferret out the hidden mystery Of the missing man.
and If possible to bring to justice any who might
be guilty OF his murder. On Tuesday traces OF blood
were discovered In the street near the railroad
depot, and from that point blood stains could be
seen upon the ground for distance OF 200 yards in
the direction OF the river. In the afternoon Of the
same day blood marks were also found reaching
from point near the old hotel where Ditcher was
last seem to the boat wharf ut the river and pursuing
Investigation still further blood stains were found
In an Old closet In the hotel, together with pack OF
CARDS which were marked with blood too. These
facts, taken in connection with the removal OF
Ditcher's boat the night after he was missing, made
she case stll more mysterious and Tuesday passed
with a a
being on the increase. on Wednesday, however, all
doubts set at rest as to the fate OF the missing
man. party OF fishermen in the river, near an alb
rupt bend OF tine stream, discovered q black mass
OF something doating towards them, and after haul
ing near enough found 1t TO be the dead body Of
cOiorea man. They quickly brought 1t ashore and
though much disfgured and mutilated about the
features the body was a. once recognized as that OF
quest was held, evidence in effect as above being
ELECTED, and verdict that deceased came to his
death by blows from clubs or ike weapons IN the
hands OF persons unknown"" was rem
dered. From the circumstantial evidence ad-
suspicion OF i've negroes, as foows-Gus Baker,
George Bayline, Jim Thomas, DICK Williams and
Frank McAnster, was considered Iustifable by
court which subsequently examined into the muir
der.


Excitement ran high among the negroes and so
intense the Indignation and feeling against the
suspected murdsrers that threats OF lynching were
sober counsel OF more experienced White men tnat
that summary punishment was not brought
into requisltou, which probably might have hurried
into the presence OF their Maker On the Monday
following their Incarceration one OF the accused sig
nifed his willingness 70 disclose all he knew con-
cernlng the murder, Notwithstanding the threats
and denunciation OF his more guilty fellow prisoners
This was Frank McAllister and his version Is the
statement OF the affair as It occurred, and
the evidence afterwards proved to be. After Wade
Ditcher had won their money, and ""broke"" Baker,
In which the three latter attacked Ditcher. Tney all
went out into the porch OF the building the hour
being after midnight when Gus Baker struck Ditcher
across the face with heavy weapon, Jim Thomas
striking him Immediately after with club on the
head, telling hun to the ground, at which George
Bayne exclaimed, with fendish joy, ""Damn himl
dats got him. Ditcher's body (life being supposed
70 be extinct was then taken and carried through
Bakers room TO the rear portion OF the old dining
ROOM which was atogetheI unfreqsented. Much TO
the surprise or the murderers, who visited their vic

time considerable cry had been raised
concerning his absence i and aarned ar, Att a. this Gus

THE TRIAL.


A true bill OF Indictment for murder in the nrst
degree being found against Gus Baker, jim Thomas
and George Baylne, they were arraigned at an
exta session OF the superior Court OF this county
Monday, July 20, 1853. Attorney General VIM. X.
Cox appeared for the state and Mr.. T.. Congland
and others for the defence. Facts as substantially
gwen above were adduced In the evidence, and
AFTER an able display OF forensic talent on both sides
the Jury retired, and In about fifteen minutes re-
ported verdict OF guilty. against the three prison.
ers. In accordance with this verdict the Judge, on
the following Saturday morning, sentenced Gus
Baker Jim Tnomas and George Bayiine To be hanged
by the neck until dead the lsth OF August 1865.


An APPEAL GRANTED.


Prior to the day fixed for the execution an appeal
was granted 10 the Supreme Court OF the state upon
the very questionable ground that the calling OF the
extra term OF the court which tried and sentenced
The condemned was unconstitutional. This lucky
circumstance prolonged their miserable existence
and cheated the gallows out OF three victims which
IL claimed for several months.

Thief.


Last Saturday will be memorable in the
criminal calendar of New York for burglary
and an attempted murder on Bond street,
most daring robbery in the Park Bank, on
Broadway. an attempted highway robbery on
Fourth street and the arrest Of boarding
house thief ON East Fifteenth street. Full de-
tails of each case were given yesterday morn
ing In the HERALD.


The Bond street burglar was captured be-
tween four and five o'clock on Saturday morn
ing in Amity street, after swift flight and
desperate struggle, during which he tried to
kill one Of the officers in pursuit of him and
was himself shot through the hand. He was
committed, without bail, to answer at the
Court Of General Sessions upon the double
charge Of burglary In the house of DR.. Beach
and attempting to shoot officer Randall. The
bold robber of the Park Bank, smashing the
large plate glass window in front Of the money
department and grabbing"" package Of
SO, 636 in national bank bills, ran out OF the
Ann street entrance Of the bank, and, after
vigorous chase, was arrested in Maiden lane,
about halfpast nine o'clock on Saturday morn
ing. On Saturday evening, at hslf-past six
o'clock, while Mrs. Lynch, keeper Of a diamond
jewelry store under the New York Hotel, on
Broadway, accompanied by her husband, was
going home through Fourth street, with bag
containing fifty thousand dollars worth of valu-
ables, they were waylaid by five Or six high
way robbers. Mr.. Lynch held stontly on to
the precious bag, and the screams Of bis wife
quickly brought to the spot officer Van Zant,
who secured and locked up one Of the gang.
On Saturday evening also suspected board
ing house thief was arrested in East Fifteenth
street, as he was leaving, he said, to visit
certain relatives In Canada. His projected
journey ended for the night at the station
house.


Surely this record of single day should
stimulate citizens to fresh precautions and the
police to renewed vigilance. In justice to the
police 1t must be added that if all the villains
in our midst, from murderers, burglars and
highway robbers to boarding house thieves,
shall be as promptly arrested as in the above
mentioned cases, the organization of vigilance
committee in New York may safely be post
poned for q while."

was dry and the pockets were entirely empty. a

EDITOR or UxIoN AND JoURSAL:- ....,


or course the great centre Of attraction at
the present time is Congress, and everybody
that can afford the time, makes daily trip to
the Capitol. 1t is surprising to notice the
change that has taken place in our city within
the past weeks. The avenue Is crowded With
strangers, and the rich, gorgeous apparel Of the
ladies, and the flashing equipagcs that are seen
upon our streets are in strange contrast with
the dull staid city life few weeks ago. One
thing is certain, II Congress holds out as II has
commenced. the present session will be busy
and important one. ,n. .a


Gen. Butler was extremely we'll pleased at the
Recommendation Of the President in relation to
the repeal Of the Tenurc-of-ofiice acts, and has


introduced bill to that effect. As indicated
short time ago, think the repeal Of the Ten
ure-of-ofiicc acts will be very likely to put q
auetus upon jerks Civil Service Bill, for II the
President has the privilege OF removing his
Cabinet and other officers at pleasure, why
should not Cabinet officers have the same privi-
lege. There Is another question which the re-
peal Of this act will suggest: II the Senate Of
the United States repeal this law, thereby lcav-
ing no law other than the Constitution to regu-
late the appointment and removal Of officers, do
thereby virtually endorse the opinion Of the
late VIM. p. Fcsseuden, that the President has
the power to remove Cabinet officers. There Is
another question that this repeal suggests. Is
il wiss CT judicious to enact special laws upon
any occasion. .,....s =.


A bill has been introduced into the House to
abolish the franking privilege. The prescn-
taton Of bill Of this nature occurs periodical
ly, and is one Of the necessary appurtenanccs OF
the opening Of Congress It is looked for with
as much certainty us the Deficiency bill, and the
only difference between the two is, the latter
will be passed and the former laid upon the Ia
BILE, where Il will remain. II Congress wishes
to inaugurate reform there Is one measure
which, IL adopted, would result In more real
good, financially and morally than nny other,-
and this reorganization Of all the departments
of government. sweeping away all Of the per-
quisites Of Office, and establishing salary to
each office. which shall cover the full amount Of
pay. I said, morally, for there is no one thing
that leads to 80 much gross misconduct In Office
as our system Of perquisitss.


Georgia is to be taken in hand by Congress
for breaking its faith and abridging the rights
Of its citizens, and bill Is to be introduced In
the House at nm early day by Gen. Butler. to
reconstruct this rccrcant sister state. Virginia.
profting by the act Of Congress, will bc admitted
this week, and will guarantee equal rights to all
of her citizens, and will, undoubtedly, keep the
promise. ,.M


Hon. Lot NJ. Morrill, will announce the death
of Mr.. Fessenden In the Senate and Hon. John
Lynch in the House. or the Senate, Morrill, Of
Vt, Anthony, Trumball, Howard or Davis will
pronounce eulogies and in the House Brooks Of
N. Y. Davis Of Mass. Hale and Peters Of Maine.
Hon. John A. Peters will undoubtedly do JUS
tice TO the occasion, and as he Is we'll known to
the people Of the state can add nothing to his
reputation. Hon. Eugene Hale from the 9th
District, is quite q young man, about thirty,
endowed with superior mind and vivid im-
agination fine scholar and an eloquent speak
er. Upon such an occasion, Mr.. Hale will, un-
display his laurels to advantage In
bcstowing merilel praise TO the illustrous dead.


The reyerses of life is illustrated somewhat in
the election of 8. T.. Morrill, from the 2d Dis
trict to the Forty frs! Congress. MIR. Morrill,
was a few years ago clerk in one Of tho de-
partments in this city, and returned to his state
TO he elected 70 Congress and now comes hack
here, with an NJ. G, attached to his name.


Joseph A. Ware, son of Judge Ware, OF Port
land, has brought suit against the Secretary OF
the Treasury for $40, being the amount deduct
ell from his salary for absence ffom the office.
Mr.. Ware was solicitor Of the 9th Auditors Of
fec, and was removed short time since by the
Secretary. This suit has been instituted in the
Court Of Claims rs a test case, as there has been
quite number Of clerks ""docked' for absence.
Mr.. Ware contends that the salaries of the clerks
arc established by law, and that the Secretary
cannot reduce that amount or stop the pay. only
by removal from Office.


A great deal has been said Mt various times,
about the ungratefulness Of republics, whatever
of truth there may be in the saying that ''re-
publics are ungrateful' il remains for the future
to stamp that character upon us. The past
has not done 1t, and we stand today rs . nation
grand argument against the dogma. AS eyi-
dence Of this, might cite the manner in which
the nation has treatei its soldiers from Gen.
Grant down to the humblest private. The ten
their interests cannot bc better illustrated, than
by glance at the figures in the report Of the
md Auditor Of the Treasury, In relation to tho
payment of bounties to discharged soldiers and
20 the heirs of deceased soldiers. lie says that
during the last fiscal year there were allowed to
soldiers and their heirs 90, ,758 claims for boun-
W, iuNoi'""B vi oAPSnuuuIo VI So,oooboAo,s<~
This in single year, and this immense sum is
part only Of the reward the governmnnt rem
ders to those who stood up between II, and its
enemies in the hour Of peril. might add that
the office which adjusts these claims is admins
tered by well known gentleman from your
State, Hon. K. B. French, and the great impor-
tance and responsibility, in connection with
the fact that one Of the FIRST acts Of President
Grant was decision to retain the present In
cumbeut, may be accepted as q compliment to
your State rs well as the gentleman himself.


The Rev. A. ID. Eearle, has been holding Un-
ion Revival meetings in the different churches
Of this city day and evening with great success.
The houses Of worship have been, nightly crowd
ell and large number Of conversions have tax
en- place. f.


l referred in my last to the fact thatthe 'Wom-
ans Rights Association were charging twenty
Ave cents admittsnce to their meetings, and rs
they had no license to give entertainments the
""Association"" was fined five dollars by the
Court. To retaliate, suits have been instituted
against various parties for being disorlerly at
the meetings Of this Association. PRESrrss.

From all quarters OF the republic we learn that
peace and prosperity are last established and 10

diately afer his assumption cf the supreme power,
the happy event owing. Railways are his great
hobby, and in this he Is ably seconded by Mr..
Henry Meiggs, now residing IN Lima. Authority
has been given 70 the latter to the survey Of
several o. the most important lines projected TO bc
immediately made, and the President Is seriously
considering the feasibility OF raising the eco 0JO
appropriated BY Congress for railways by
foreign loan, picdgmg the Northern guano ISLANDS
and the railways themselves as security, and guar
anteeing profit OF seven per cent upon the capital
invested. From the high reputation Peru enjoys in
Europe and the United states for prompatude In
d:schargng her financial Obligations 1t Ia TO be be.
iIeyed that the Presidents plan might easily be
carried out


Mr. Mclgts is confident OF his ability 70 raise the
necessary FUNDS for tine most important Of the rail-
ways spoken Of, that running along the northern
coast from IIuacho to Lambayeq and the capi-
tasts Of Lima are only waiting for the report OF the
engineers TO open the stock hooks OF the line from this
city Jaaja, town near tue Peruvian head waters
OF the Amazon and situate In one OF the most fertile
dls,ricis--not only OF Peru but "" the world. Ine
Spaniards ayailng themselves Of the almost apso-
lutte power they possessed over the aboriginal In.
hanltauts OF Peru, extracted an enormous amount
OF wealth from tho interior OF the country. NOW,
WITH the liberty OF that lazy working class establish
cd, the railway must usurp their place. ...s :. !.


The really dark spot on the present horizon OF tne
country 4 the vets unsatisfactory state of the public
health. All along the southern coast yellow fever
raging, aud Va some OF the ports a. many a. forty
deaths per day are reported. As yet but iew case
have occurred IN Lima and Callao, but physioianl

term. The authorities are at last bestrring them
selves, and the most stringent orders have beer
issued and enforced concerning the cleanliness o
the city, Nevertheless II IL dincult todvert ths

Times speaks in terms of just commendation
of the resolution passed by the House of-Rep-
resentatives at the instance of Mr.. Lynch pro-
viding for the appointment of a committee Of
nine to investigate the causes of the decrease
of American tonnage and to report what meas
ures are necessary to increase our ocean ton
mage, revive our navigation interests and re-
gain for our country the relative position
which it once held among nations as a mari
time power. The Times says:


We suppose the Committee will hold most
of its sessions in this city, as it is here it will


be most convenient to obtain the information
necessary TO the answering of these inquiries.
We trust it will call before it some of our
great ship -builders,-Or those who once sCert
our ship-builders,- s,-some of our great shipping
merchants, of our great importers, and some
of those concerned in the other great interests
connected with commerce and our mercantile
marine. We trust it will listen to the Cham
Der of Commerce; and we have no doubt that
for this occasion the Chamber will be able to
agree as to certain vital interests that deserve
the favorable consideration of Congress. Af-
ter completing such investigations, the Com
mittee should visit Portland, Boston and Phil
adelphia, so as to get thorough comprehen-
sion of the matter in all its bearings.


When those OF our leading men who repre-
sent the interests that are now broken dowI
have visited Washington to lay facts and ar
guments before Congress, they have not beer
properly received. In many cases they have
been treated as merely selfish schemers, al
men seeking their own advantage at any cost I
as men whose advances, ought to be repelled
and whose projects or suggestions ought to b.
defeated. The great majority of the members
of Congress know very little about the mercan-
tile interests of the country. They have made
no Investigations such as would fit them to
legislate on these interests, and have no expe-
rience such as would guide them in the right
course of action, As a consequence, the rep
resentatives of our mercantile interests have
long felt discouraged in regard to any intelli-
gent action on the part of Congress, and havt
felt that it was hopeless to impress their idea
ON the law-making powers. 1t is on this &C
count that they have drifted into state o
Indifference, and have come to look hopelessl,
ON the decay of the American marine."

meRt Of a Central Committee, &c.-For some time
past there has been talk of a ""secret circular
for the organization of Walker party"" among
the politicians in Virginia. 1t now appears that
a circular, dated the 25th of October last, au-
thorized at an informal conference Of some of
the members Of the Virginia Legislature on the
day Of adjournment, when too late for fun
meeting Of what is called ''the Walker party of
the General Assembly,"" was gotten up to be
sent by a subcommittee, consisting Of Chas
Campbell and William Lovenstein, for signature
Of action, &C."" This circular has been published
with list of the proposed Walker Central Com
mittee, but Ii does not appear that any of the
gentlemen so named have signifed their acqui-
escence in the scheme. The circular sets forth
that ""withOut some such organization, the party
time to have its aims thwarted by foes, open or
secret; that the name for central commit
tee at Richmond, and from Congressional
districts, were suggested, and the per
sons named be requested to answer ~
The list embraces the names Of gentlemen of
Prominent i'm all parties-Whigs, Republicans
and Democrats. Among them Mr.. Charles s.
Darlington, President OF the james River and
Kanawha Canal; James A. Corwardin, editor of
the Dispatch; Mr.. Walter Taylor, q former Ad-
iutant General OfLec's army; Charles b. t,ne.
ID. Imbotien, ex-General of the Confederate
army; Thomas 8. Flourn0y, Whig candidate for
Governor I'm 1856; ID. q. Dejarnette, former
Democratic member of Congress.


The Lynchburg News says: ""There can be but
two parties in Virginia-the Conservative and
is wholly and supremely ridiculous, and any at
tempt to form such party will but rebound TO
the shame and confusion Of the 0rigtnators and
abettors Of the scheme"""

A JURYMAN's STORY.",BY JUDGE CLARK.,"oneI Sulit Witn unlalling certainty.


The reeusant juror had stood out from thu
nrst. de acknowledged the cogency of tn,
proofs, confessed his inability to reconcile the
facts with the defendants innocence, and yet
on every vote, went steadily Cor acquittal.


His conduct was inexplicable. 1t could no
result from lack of intelligence; for, Will.
he spoke but little, his words were well cho
sen, and evinced thorough understanding o
the case.


Though still in the prime of manhood, his
locks were prematurely white, and his face
wore singularly sad and thoughtful express
sion.


He might be one OF those who entertained
scruples as to the right OF society TO nfilct
the death denaity But no, it was not that
for, in reply TO such suggestion, he frankly
admitted that brutal men, like the vicious
brutes they resemble, must be controlled
through fear, and that dread Of death, the
supreme terror, is, in many cases, the only
adequate restraint.


AT the prospect of another night of fruitless
imprisonment we began to grow impatient
aud expostulated warmly against what seem.
edan unreasonable captiousness; aud some
not over kind remarks were INDUCED in as tc
the impropriety OF trifling with an oath like
that under which we were acting.


Sand yet"" the man answered, as though
communing with himself rather than repell-
ing the imputation, ""It is Conscience that
hlnders my concurrence in verdict approved
by my judgment""


How can that be ?""inqured several at once.


conscience may rot always dare to follow
judgment""


""But here she can know no other guide?""


II once would have said the same""


And what has changed your Opinion?v


""ExPERIENCEw


The speakers manner was visibly agitated
we waited in silence the explanation which
he seemed ready to give


mastering his emotion, as il in answer to
our looks OF inquiry, he continued:


Twenty years ago was young man lust
beginning life. Few had brighter prospects
AMI none brighter hopes.


An attachment, dating from childhood, had
ripened with its object. There had been no
verbal declaration and acceptance of Iove-no
formal plighting of troth: but when / took nv
departure to seek home in the distant West,
1t was thing understood, that when l had
found it and put it in order, she was to share
it.


Life in the forest, though solitary. is not
necessarily lonesome. The kind of society afs
forded byNature, depends much on ones SEX.
As for me, lived more in the future than in
the present, and Hope is an ever-cheerful
companion.


AT length the time came for making the
final payment on the home which / had
bought. 1t would henceforth be my own; !;
and in few more months, my simple dwell
ing, which I had spared no pains to render in
vting, would be graced by its mistress.


At the land-office, which was some sixty
miles of, met my old friend, George C. He.
too, had come to seek his fortune in the West:
and we were both delighted at the meeting. ne
had brought with him, he said, sum of mon
ey which be desired to invest in land, on
which 1t was his purpose to settle,


depressed strong wish to have him for
neighbor, and gave him cordial invitation.
to accompany me home, giving it as my belief
tnat ne could nowhere make better selection
than in that vicinity.


he readily consented, and we set ont to-
gather. We had not ridden many miles. when
George suddenly recollected commission he
had undertaken for friend, which would re-
quire his attendance at public land-sale on
the following day.


Exacting promise that he would not delay
his visit longer than necessary. and having
given minute directions as to the route. / con:
tinued my way homeward, while he turned
back.


Al was about retiring to bed on the night of
my return, when summons from without
called me to the door. A stranger asked
shelter for himself and his horse for the night.


Invited him in. Though a stranger, his
face seemed not unfamiliar. He was proba-
bly, one Of the men had seen at the land
Office, place, at that time, much freouented.


Offering him seat, went to see to his
horse. The poor animal, as we'll as could
see by the dim starlight, seemed to have been
hardly used. His painting sides bore witness
OF merciless riding, and a trcmulous shrink
ing, at the slightest touch, betokened recent
fright.


On reentering the house, found the stran.
ger was not there. His absence excited no
surprise; he would doubtless soon return. II
was little singular however, that he should
have left his watch lying on the table.


AT the end OF halt an hour, my guest not
returning, went again to the stable, think
ing he might have found his way thither to
give personal attention to the wants Of his
horse.


Before going out, from mere force of habit
for we were. as yet uninfested by either
thieves or policemen took the precaution
OF putting the strangers watch in Che drawer
in which kept my own valuables.


Ifound the horse as / had left him. and
gave him the food which he was now suffici-
emily cooled to be allowed to eat, buthis mas
ter was nowhere to be seen.


As approached the house, crowd of men
ON horseback dashed up, and L was command

what It all meant. did so at last, and the ex-
pianation came, it was teriblel


My friend, with whom had SO lately set
out in comany, had been found murdered and
robbed near the spot at which /, but / alone
knew we had separated. was the last per
son known to be with him, and | was now
arrested on suspicion of his murder.


A search of the premises was immediate
ly instituted. The watch was found in the
draw In which ] had placed it, and avas
identified as the property of the murdered
man. His horse, too, was found in nv sta
stable, for the animal / had just put there

when I saw him in the light.


What 1 said, I know not. NV confusion
was taken as additional evidence. And
when, at length, / did command language
to- give an Ineligible statement it was re-
ceived with sneers of incredulity.


The mob spirit is inherent in man-at
least IN crowds of men. 1t may not ALWAYS
manifest itself with lynching character.
But whatever its form, it is always relentless.
pitiless, cruel.


As the proofs of my guilt, one alter an
other, came to light, low mutterings, gradu-
nily grew iubo q claLnOf IOT vengeance. and
but for the firmness of one man-the officer
who had me in charge-I would doubtless
have paid the penalty of my supposed offence
on the spot.


1t was not sympathy for me that actuated
my protector. His heart was as hard as his
office; but he represented the majesty of the
law, and took a sort of grim pride in the DO
sitiOn.


As much under the glance of his eye as
before the muzzle of his pistol, the cowardIy
clamorers drew back. Perhaps they were
not sufficiently numerous to feel the full
effect of that mysterious reflex influence
which makes crowd of men so much worse,
and at times so much better, than any one of
them singly.


At the end of some months nv trial came.

The absence of the jury was very brief. To
their verdict paid but little heed. It was a
single hideous word; but I had long antici-
pated it, and it made no impression.

ment.


Mr. Fessenden in reply to suggestions that
| the claim if valid ought to have been fettled
| years ago. said it would bave been settled at
| the same time with the claims of other States
/ but for the fact that the Democratic party,
then dominant in Congress, singled out Mas
| sachusetts, and by delaying payment of her
claims. sought to punish her for the action Of
/ the Federal party by which she had been con-
| trolled at the time of the war.
/ Mr.. Howard asked him whether there was
| any security that the money asked for would
be appropriated to the construction of the rail-
road spoken of in connection with it.
Mr.. Fessenden said its use for that purpose
was secured by the laws Of Massachusetts, and
Maine.


Mr.. Sherman said the proposition offered by
the Senator from Massachusetts, would appro-
pirate over five millions of dollars, and then
with the restrictions proposed by the Commit
tee on Foreign Relations would appropriate
over 81 100000. He had looked over the items
constituting the original claim and mad found
that nearly all of them were expenditures for
local defences.


Mr.. Patterson replied to Mr.. Sherman, who
he said had overstated the amount OF the origi-
nal claim He said the whole amount due
Massachusetts, and Maine under this claim
was not million and quarter as stated by
the Senator from Ohio, but only $767, 900.
Messrs Davis, Drake and Hendricks opposed
the amendment, and Mr.. Morton advocated it.


The debate continued until 1040, when the
Senate adjourned.


The House passed resolution-119 to a5-
directing the Committee on Public Grounds to
inquire into the circumstances of the proposed
return to Gen. Robert e. Lee of certain arti-
cles formerly belonging to Gen. Washington,
which were taken from Arlington House, and
directing the Secretary of the Interior not to
deliver them up until action had been taken on

Mr.. Judd introduced joint resolution in
relation to the proper completion of the Pacific
Railroads and their branches, and moved the
previous question on its passage. 1t author
ICES and requires tn President of the United
States to demand and require from the Union
Pacific Railroad Company of California and
their branches, bonds or other securities suff-
cient to guarantee the completion of such rail-
roads and branches and bring them up to the
standard fixed by the Special Commission
that has recently examined and reported ON
the Union Pacific Railroad and its branches,
and that is now examining the Central Pacific
Railroad and its branches applying the same
standard of construction to each and requiring
the same security from each; and it directs the
the issue of such bonds to be withheld until
the report shall have been received.


The previous question was seconded-ayes
107, nays not countsd-and the joint resolution
passed without discussion.


Ordered That the House hereafter meet at
10 o'clock.


Mr.. Brooks called attention to the great ex-
pense of printing the public money, which had
cost since the beginning of the system over
$1l 100000 and for which this bill appropriated
81 100000.


A paragraph in the bill appropriating $780,
600 for the construction of four steam revenue
cutters-for Alaska, for Columbia river, Ore
gon, for Mobile, for Charleston, and for the
transfer of the revenue cutter s. p. Chase from
the great lakes to Boston, elected lengthy dis
cussion.


Mr.. Kelsey moved the appropriation of $4,000
to pay Miss Vennie Ream the amount due on
her contract to furnish a statue of the late
President Lincoln. Agreed to.


Mr.. Dodge moved an appropriation Of $229,-
848 to reimburse the State of Iowa for expenses
incurred and payments made during the rebel
lion, as examined, audited and found due by a
commission appointed by Gen. Buchanan,
which was rejected.


The same amendment with a prOviso was of
fered again by Mr.. Wilson of Iowa.


After considerable discussion Mr.. Butler of
Mass. moved to amend the amendment by pro-
viso, by appropriating an amount necessary to
pay the war claims of all the States that have
been reported favorably upon by the Commits
sioner appointed by Congress


Mr.. Wilson adopted the proviso.


Mr.. Clark OF Kansas moved to amend the
amendment by appropriating $215O00 for the
Kansas war claims.


Pending the discussion the House took re-
cess.


EVENING SESSION.


A large number of private bills were passed.


Mr.. Perham, from the Committee on Invalid
Pensions, reported a bill in relation to the op-
GRAFTON of the pension laws.


After some discussion and amendment the
bill was passed 1t provides that no claim of
a widow for pension, pay or bounty shall be
allowed where she has voluntarily lived sepa-
rate and apart from her husband without re-
ceiving any support from him; that all PEN
si0na OrQutad n of
wounds or sickness contracted in the service,
shall commence from the date of death or dis
charge Of soldier with provision that nothing
in the several acts relating to pensions shall
deprive any person who was in the service of
the United States between the Sd of March,
1866, and 9th of June, 1866, of his pension dur
ing that period.


Mr. Schenck said that the bill to strengthen
the public credit having come back from the
Senate with two or three amendments, he pro-
posed by way OF abrigding the consideration of
the matter, to ask the House to non-ccncur in
these amendments and ask for Committee of
Conference. He had no doubt such a commit
mittee would come to an arrangement.


Mr.. Butler-I object.


Mr.. Schenck-I move to suspend the rules
for that purpose.


Mr.. Spalding, who had the floor on the Mis-
cellaneous Appropriation bill, declined to yield
for that motion.


Mr.. Schenck-Very WELL want it under
stood by the country that it is on the objection
from the gentleman from Massachusetts that
we cannot get at that bill.


Mr.. Butler-And I want it understood by
the country that the gentleman from Ohio
cannot get at that swindling brokers' bill on
the objection of the gentleman from Massachu-
sets. Naughter.)


The House then went into Committee of the
Whole, Mr.. Dawes in the chair, on the Miscel-
laneous Appropriation bill, the pending amend
ment being to pay the war claims of Iowa and
Kansas.


That in regard to Kansas was rejected, and
that in regard to Iowa, with Mr.. Buffers pro-
viso added to it, was passed.


On motion of Mr.. Lynch an appropriation of
$4,000 was made for lighthouse on Half Way
Rock, Casco Bay, Maine.


Mr.. Brooks moved an appropriation of $2,-
100000 for laying the foundation and COM
mencing the building of the Post Office in New
York city.


After some discussion the amendment was
adopted-78 to 40.


An appropriation of $4,000 was made for the
purchase of a portrait of Abraham Lincoln for
the White House, to be selected by the in
coming President.


An amendment to pay several contesting
members $2500 each gave rise to considerable
discussion. Finally it was agreed that the
amendment should be offered in the House,
and the Committee rose and reported the bill
to the House, which adjourned until 10 o'clock"

The Republicans OF Mississippi, in Con-
vention assembled, i'm a spirit of amity aud
peace towards their opponents. and OF ius
tice TO themselves. make the following dec
laratiOn of principles and policy:


Unfaltering devotion 10 the Union firsL
last and forever.


Faith Ia and fidelity to the principles. OBJ
jects and aims, of the great National Repub-
lican Party. with which and with the Pres
idcnt and Congress We are in full accord and
sympathy.


\ fair, impartial, just and economical ad-
nIinistratiOn of the government, National
and State.


Full and unrestricted right OF speech to
all men, at all times, and all places with the
most complete and unrestrained freedom OF
the ballot, including protection to citizens
in the exercise OF the suffrage.


\ system of free schools which shall place
the means of liberal education within the
reach OF every child in the State


Reformation of the iniquitous and un-
equal taxation aud assessments. which dis
eliminating against labor and laborers- have
borne so unjustly and unequally upon the
people.


That all men without regard to race, color
or previous condition, are equal before the
law and that To be a freeman is To possess
ali the civil and political rights of citizen,
are not only enduring truths, but the set
tied and permanent doctrines of the Repub-
lican party.


This Convention recognizes but two grea-
national parties-that under the administral
ton OF the one, the material and Industrial
resources of the country will langulsh,
whilst under the liberal and fostering care
of the national Republican party, commerce,
manufactures and internal improvements
by the general government will surely
make the people OF Mississippi what nature.
soil and climate, intend they should be-rich,
prosperous and contented.


Recognizing as peculiarly American and
Republican the sentiment that the true ba-
sis of government is the consent of the
governed"" which in a republic, is express
ed through the ballot-boX, we in the Lam
guage OF the Chicago Platform, favor the
removal of the disqualifications and restric-
tions imposed upon the late rebels. in the
same measure as the spirit OF dlsloyalty
may die out, and as may be consistent with
the safety of the loyal people, and we shall
hail with unfeigned delight, the day when
the spirit of federation now dawning upon
our State, shall be so firmly established as
| to warrant Congress, aud the nation in de-
claring disabilities and restrictions forever
at an end-when there shall be no citizen OF
Mississippi, clamorIDg for his rights.
That the present modified condition of
public sentiment in this State, renders il wise
and expedient, that the Republican party
should embrace the opportunity which is TO
be presented in the approaching election Of
ratifying the new Constitution. so far modi-
| fled in the franchise and general provisions
thereof as to conform TO the Constitution of
! the United States, and the reconstruction
| laws: and that as soon as Mississippi shall
| be fully reconstructed, according To the true
/ intent OF the laws, all disabilities imposed
upon the late rebels, should be entirely re-
moved.


| That we favor the prompt ratification by
this State of Article 10, as an amendment 70
the Constitution of the United States at the
| earliest practicable opportunity.
We declare for universal amnesty and uni
versal suffrage, the enlightened spirit OF the
/ age demanding that the fossil remains OF
prescription must be numbered with the
| things of the past.


The languishing condition of our State,
Notwithstanding her genial climate, and
| productive soil, capable of sustaining and
| inviting Il population of fifteen millions,
reminds us not only of the necessity of re-
construction on proper basis, but OF the
need of immigration. schemes designed for
! clsss immigration, such as laborers only,
or favoring one section, or country, or peo-
pie, or portions of people over another, on
account of political or an other causes, will
meet with no success; plans to Increase our
| population, must embrace all countries
climes, people, professions, politics and re
| ligious beliefs; any plan stopping short oi
this, or hcsitating to give practical, earn
est, cordial welcome to settlers, without re-
gard to race, color, locality, politics or re-
| ligion, will meet with merited failure, be-
cause indicating the existence of bigotry
and intolerance.


We recognize in Gen. Grant the chosen
leader of our party and cause, as well as
the representative man of the age. AS
! Washington was in his time, so is Grant now,
first in war, first in peace, and first in the
hearts of his countrymen."" Through his
election, peace, liberation and prosperity, mt
last dawn upon Mississippi; and ere long
throughout these States, the old flag and the
ancient principles, he and il represent will
be respected, adopted and adored. The
magic words: let US have peace"" possess
| a power, and have mission which will en-
| brace the whole world, and will cease only
| with time.


We endorse and adopt his language that
s.the question of suffrage is one which is
likely to agitate the public so long as por-
ton of the citizens of the nation are eX-
cluded from its privileges"" and in his own
words. we favor such constitution and laws,
as will effectually secure the civil and polit-
ical rights of all persons, consummation
| we devoutly desire at the earliest practicable
moment, with safety and justice to all.


We confide in and will support Major
! General Ames, Military Commander, and
| Governor of this State; we look to him as
the representative of the President. and OF
! Congress, and regard him as able and firm
/ in peace, as in war; his quiet yet decided
! administration commands our confidence
and admiration. For his order relieving the
poor of heavy burthen of unequal taxes,
and for the order abolishing distinctions OF
| color for the jury, and for the marked abili-
| tv and Independence displayed by him, the
| loyal people owe him a debt of gratitude
which they can never repay, save by life OF
like devotion to the principles he represents
| We look TO Congress as the assembled
wisdom and expressed will of the nation.
/ At whatever cost of oblOquy or life, we shall
/ in the future. as in the past yield our un-
wavering fidelity TO the laws and policy OF
/ the National Legislature. a united nation
and the principles of liberty owe their eX-
! istence to-day, TO the firmness, patriotism
and wisdom, of a Republican Congress.


The report was received and the platform
i unanimously adopted.


After the demonstrations of enthusas m
produced by reading the resolutions had
/ Dartially subsidized, Gen. j. l.. Alcorn was
j loudly called by many voices. The General
appeared IN the Hall, and approaching the
stand, was introduced Dy the Speaker amid
deatening cheers from the assembled masses.
