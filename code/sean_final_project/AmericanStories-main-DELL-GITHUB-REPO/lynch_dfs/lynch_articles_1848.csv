the friends of Col. Sewer are urging as reason
why West Arkansas should support that gentle
mans reelection, that the Indian aPpropria-
tons cannot be 60! through Congress without his
aid and influence. That Maj. Borland is indifer-
ent or against the interest of the frontier coun-
ties. We are authorized TO pronounce the accusa-
ton against Maj. Borand, as utterly false, which
we do most emphqticaHy because We know OF the
activity Of The Majors traducers, and of the foul
and corrupt combination formed agaiDs him by
these spectators in Indian claims. Maj. Borland
did not oppose any bill for appropriations to In
diuns on this frontier, or the merits Of these ap
preparations, bat in some instances he refused his
support of certain appropriations, which were
frauds upon the Indians and theGovernment ,forthe
sole benefit of Indian Spectators. We are now
procuring more information upon this sub ject,
when it is obtained, will lay it all before the
public. 1t will rebound the honor and credit Of
Senator Borland that he did not lend himself 10
these nefarious schemes, and we consider it by no
means complimentary to Col. Sewer that these
sharks admit the impossibili:y of getting their
schemes carried out by Borland, and urge that, as
their reason why Col. Sewer should be elected.


We have been spoken and written to by every
person concerned in these Indian speculations
whose acquaintance justified such an approach
and all alike have urged the election of Col. Sc
vier upon account of their priUate and personal
interests. We were called upon few weeks
since by Creek chief, who was then upon his
return from Washington city, who urged upon US
to I"" drop BorIand and go for SEWER"" and gave as
a reason that Borland was against the interests
of this frontier. Upon inquiries, we learned from
him that he did not knoU that this charge against
Borland was true, but that certain - Indian At.
tornies - at Washington told him 50 and that one
of them who we know to be a chief operator in
that city, sent US word that if we would drop Bor-
land and. go fos Sewer he would pay US $780,
At the same time we further learned that the
Creek delegation had to pay to these Indian law
yers 81 900 to get claim of Sal, 600 through
Congress. Our readers can have some idea of
the extent of this business of specuIating in In
dian claims, and account for the keenness and
avdity with which they work for the election ofCol
Sewer, if he is their reliance in getting through
certain Indiop appropriations and for these rea-
sons, we are opposed to his election. We will





his whole constituency, to attend to the private
interests of these spectators.


O|TThe Banner and its correspondent Aris-
tides presume upon the ignorance of its readers,
when they attempt 10 palm offupon them that our
advocacy of Major BorIand, is prompted by ha-
tired of the democratic party; and if the readers
Of the Banner so gulli5le to believe such
barefaced inferences they are by no means in
er,lied most spirited would be at an attempt
so derogatory TO their intelligence.


Maj. Borland's sound democracy was never
doubted he has ably defended the principles of
the party with his pen, and in party strife he has
noby peried his life on the field of honor. How
can the advocacy of such man be the prompt
ings of hate to the democratic party 'Ars-
tides"" is presumptious scamp and dares utter
under an anonymous signature bold charge
against US, that he dares utter over his proper
signature he knows that in doing he would
publish his own infamy and character for false
hoods to the citizens (both democratic and whig)
in this section of the State, where our democracy
is unequivocal, open mouthed and unmuzzIed.'
1t is well known that we never voted for whgs
nor supported them, either directly or indirectly;
and have ever occupied bold party ground. But
this is Of the :. blinds - by which the ''fami-
Iy"" expects to rope in the gulbIe portion Of the
readers of the Banner.


What say against those, to whom we are
opposed, is done at all times under the response
bity of our name, and do not have to resort to
anonymous communications like skulking towards
behind an ambush to fire upon adversary in the
open field.

that Holmes, of South Carolina, and Yancy, for
merly the State and now of Alabama, had
abandoned the Democracy. Neither of the per-
sons mentioned ever really belonged to it. The
first is weak, vain and insignificant man, and
the second an ultra and impracticahlo uuiifre,
who has such an nextinguIshable passion for
toriety, that like Cassius NJ. Clay, he adopt any

lowing good anecdote of a set
ting down which an officer Of
the ""Younited States Awmy""
received in his presence. Our
writer says:


We were travelling awhile
since ON one Of the Sound boats
where we met on deck just af-
ter breakfast, our old acquaint-
ance, John Barstow--Col. John
Barstow, who has bought and
sold more horses than any 9TH
er live man, it is said, in the u.
States. While we were ex-
changing the usual saIutations
of the morning, the sharp tones
Of the hand bell were heard
ringing along the deck, and the
almost as sharp voice of the
steward was heard crying out


""All dem passengis as has not
settle DER passage, will please
step up to de captin's offs and
settle""


There were many passengers,
and, of course, as usual, a great
crowd of peesons were gather
ed around the ""Captin's offs,""
each quietly awaiting his turn
to pay. Suddenly a tall robust
young man elbowed his way
through the mass of people up
to the window, and stretching
out his money to the clerk, said
in very load tone


""Take my fare, sir""


""What name, sir ?"" said the
clerk, as he received the bills.


Captain. Victor Henry Dig
ANNA, sir-Captain Digamma
and lady, Of the Younited States

very pompous and conccited
voice.


This was rather too much for
our acquaintance, the horse dea-
Ter. He passed rudely through
the crowd, and loudly address
Ell the clerk, while the captain
of the a,only yet stood by, and
the people seemed to be think
ing'whether to lynch him or not.


""Take my fare, sir""


""What name, sir?"" inquired
the clerk, meekly.


""Korp'ril John Barstow, sir,

sir, of the Connecticut Milishy,
STRIP was his answer, delivered
in. a most comically pompous
tone.


How blank that army captain
looked, and what good-natured
crowd that was Immediately af-
ter this answer, only those can
understand whose Imagination
can picture reality. They
laughed consumedly.

of Thursday week. give the particulars OF an outrage
committed by Joseph Jewell, landlord OF public
house in fremont Row, the person OF young
Irish girl.


The girl. lame and fragile creature, testified that
she was not quite Il years Of age that her mother
had lived with the prisoner ten months in the capacl-
ty of cook; that she herself had been employed IN
the house u week, 10 do common sewing; that on
Thursday evening, about O'Clock she was IN her
room in the second story that the prisoner knocked
at the door, and called her out that when she came
TO the door, he seized her by the wust and drew her
into another ROOM placed her on bed, promised her


$500 in gold which he said he had IN his pocket, and
two new dresses, and to take herself and mother TO
New Orleans. These offers failing to induce her to
yield his purpose, he used force, holding his hand
over her mouth in such manner as to prevent her
from making any loud outcry, &C., and succeeded
against all the resistance she could make. Her ac-
count of the struggle and the result was dreadful.


The other witnesses examined were Margaret
Magure Mary Lynch, (tke girls mother) and Ann
Floyd, and from their testimony 1t app Jared tEat
ElIzabeth's long absence from the kitchen excited
some surprise that fears were entertained that one
of the visitors of house, who had been eyelng her
during the day, had entced her away; that Miss Ma

room No. Is locked, and that there was a man, who

Mediterranean to operate elsewhere it rumored
that some Mexican privateers had appeared in that
sea, and indeed American vessel was actually
captured and carried into Spanish port, by vessel
under the Mexican flag. Our merchants became
alarmed and asked for the protection of their property
afoat In that quarter. The Secretary of the Navy
promptly acceded to their request. The steamer
Princeton was Withdrawn from the Gulf and dispatch
ed to Gibraltar; the Marion and a small schooner
being her consors. This squadron has been actively
engaged IN the duties assigned it, to the entire salts
faction of the government. 1t has of become
necessary to send out supply ship with the requ-
site stores for the station, but is well known that
vessels of this description compelled to remain
at particular ports for months at time, and neither
officers nor men can find much occupation as they
desire.


On the present occasion, Lieut.. Lynch, the COM
mander of the U. S. ship Supply, with Lieut.. Dale,
gentleman of great scientific attainments, have OBJ
tanned the consent of the Secretary of the Navy to
employ some of their leisure time in making visit
Lake Asphaltes, or what usually term the Dead
Sea. The Secretary has favored the project of these
gentlemen, and furnished them with several extra
boats, truck and some indispensable apparatus for
making the necessary observations. The whole ex-
Pense of this outlay is, however, but five hundred
dollars.


The expenditures heretofore authorised by our
Government for such purposes have added greatly
the materials of science, and the reputation of our
country. Those of Lewis S. Clark, of Gen. Cass,
of Captain Wilkes, and Col. Fremont, are esteemed
of very great importance.


The proposed exploration of the Dead Sea is not
only convenient but opportune. The world is much
interested in the condition of Palestine, and there
seems to be prevailing opinion that further impor-
tant discoveries aressoon to be made there.


DR.. Durbin has furnished US with the curious re-
suit of his personal examination of this celebrated
lake. Harriet Martineau visited it in April last and
has published an account of her visit.


The only person who is known to have crossed it
was an Irishman by the name of Costigan. He sue
ceeded in crossing the lake, in an open boat in the
month of July, 1885, but suffered so much fatigue
and exhaustion, and was lily prepared for the ad-
venture, that he fell sick and died. He made no
friends any verbal information on the subject during
his illness. His remains deposited in the Ameri-
can burying ground at Jerusalem.


""A great many important questions remain to be de-
termined, therefore, by Lientenants Lynch and Dale
