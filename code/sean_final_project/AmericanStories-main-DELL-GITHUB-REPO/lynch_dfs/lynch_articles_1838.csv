The Globe of Friday night last, contain
ed an extract of""a letter from a gentle
man of Mississippi"" to member Of Con-
gress, as it is said, which is as follows, viz:


""The times are truly ararming here.
Many plantations ARE entirely stripped OF
negroes and horses by the Marshal or
Sheriff; and to add to our other difficult
ties, our bank paper is getting worse ami
worse, every day. We cannot get planta-
ton supplies for less than double New Or
leans prices, with our money. Suits are
multiplying--two thousand five hundred
in the United States Circuit Court, and
three thousand eight hundred in Kinds
County Court-Silver is demanded, and
our citizens threaten violence and blood
shed. We are in bad situation. The
Union Bank is just going into operation,
and much is expected from it paying offour
foreign debt. Whether it can answer pub
lie expectati IN, time alone can prove; but
! fear it cannot. The board are prudent
men and will not endanger the credit of
the State.n


For whatpurpose but to crafty the most
base and diabolcal spirit, could the ""mem-
Der OF Congress"" 10 whom the letter was
addressed, have it published? But who
can that ""member of Congress"" be, that
has lent himself TO the vile purposes of
throwing discredit ON the State Of Missis-
sippi and her institutions, both at home
and abroad? That State has no represen-
tatives in one branch ofCongress now; and
we cannot believe that either of the homo
rable Senators from Mississippi would ever
have so far forgotten their duty to those
whose representatives they are, as to have
done so. In our opinion they will fail in
the performance Of their imperative duty,
if they do not ferret out the individual
member, and hold his name up TO the just
indignation of their injured State, and the
reprobation Of the country.


The bonds Of the Slate of Mississippi,
it is known, are held in Europe for some
millions Of dollars. What will be the eff.
feet ofsuch statement, and the remarks
which accompany it in the official organ
of the administration? 1t is calculated
inevitably to alarm the holders and depre.
ciate the credit of the State and the value
Of the Bonds. This, too, just at the mo.
ment when the Union Bank is about going
into operation, ""from which much is ex-
pected"" tC aid the State sin paying off her
foreign debt"" Such publication as that
in the Globe, and the awful description Of
the condition Of the State, is the sure and
effectual means to prevent the Bank from
going into operation. Its capital consists
of the Bonds of the State. These must
first be disposed Of before 1t goes into ope.
ration. Where will purchasers be found
for them, when it is announced that the
people ofthe State are about TO resort to
violence, bloodshed,"" and revolution?


We are no advocates Of Lynch Law, but
we should not like to pass through the
State Of Mississippi, if we had been instru-
mental, and it were known there, in inllc-

grasps the occasion to utter his anathemas
against the banks, the banks! as the fol-


lowing extract will show. Said he:

A FATAL AI""TEMPT AT LYNCHING.


Vicksburg has been the scene of another dis
orderly and illegal proceeding, which resulted in
boodshed and death. The particulars are given
at full length in the Register of Saturday last;
but we have room merely for general notice of
the affair. ...


1t seems that some ten or fifteen persons, ar
dent lovers ofjusce and social order, armed them
selves with muskets, ropes, &C., and proceeded,
about l o'clock on Thursday night the 23d ult.,
to lnflict summary justice upon a family of four
Germans, named Flekensten, IA father and three
sons,) who lived in the upper part of the town,
and who, it was said, kept dlsorderly house.


They demanded admission. This being re-
fused, they broke open the outer door and enter
ed, J. A. Het, German, and an unusually rash
and adventurous young fop, leading the way
Before he entered he called to his comrades
'who will 60 in with RE if | lead the way?""
Several replied that they would The family
was in the upper story of the house. He COM
menced ascending the stairs, when, perhaps
dreading the resistance of some one he saw, or
more etlectually to clear the way, he discharged
one of his pistols and wounded one Of the sons of
Flekenstein severely in the neck and jaws. A
volley of four or five shots was almost instantly
returned. Helt fell dead, piece Of the skull be-
ing torn off and almost the whole of the brains
dashed out. His comrades seeing him fall, sud-
denly took to their heels and no more was seen
of them. Some other names have been commu-
nicated to us, but we refrain from giving them al
present, lest we should either injnre innocent in
dividuals or prejudice the administration of JUS
tice. 1t is thought that the wounds of F'leken.
stein will not seriously endanger his life. An in
quest was held over the body of Helt, and YER
dict rendered that he ""came to his death by the
hands of one Of the three Flekensteins.'' Mea-
sures have been taken to bring the offenders to
justice at the next term of the criminal court."

October 2lst, in that city, to put down the inf
deity of Fanny Wright and her adherents. Every

want of sound principles is proved by the occur
renee Of so many mobbing and Lynching outra-

of mob, made them deserve similar fate The
resentment was just but the mode pursued to ap-
pease it, was wrong, and there is only one cir
cumstance that affords the least mitigation of its
criminality-the moral sense was insulted by doc
trnes whose pernicious influence might involve
their families, their wives and daughters, in the
same disgrace which attaches to their defled and
prostituted author, destroying those ties on
which the happiness of families depend. Thus
while the moral sense of the mob was very acute
on the one side in regard to female purity, on the

Why is this execrable being accommodated

interesting detailed description of the machinery
Of the Great Western, by one of the gentlemen
who went out and returned in her. AS the resi-
dence of Lieut.. w. F. Lynch, of the U. S. Navy,
is in the neighborhood Of Frederick, we presume
that we safe in assuming that he is the author
Of the excellent and perspicuous article which we
subjoin.


""The Great Western steam ship is worked by
La pair of low pressure engines, constructed SINH
lary to most engines used in British steam navi-
cation. The great distinguishing feature of such
engines is, that the whole of the machinery is
under deck, although the cylinders are worked
vertically.


The beam of the engine is not placed above
the cylinder as in our boats, but pair of beams
are placed below the cylinder, and answer the
same purpose, at the same time that they bring
la great portion of the machinery below the water
line, and do not hamper the deck. The stroke
of such engines is shortened, though not necessa-
rily, by this arrangement, and in the G. w. it is
only seven feet.


The two engines are connected to the main
shaft on which the paddles are fixed, and in case
of an accident to one engine the other continues
to work both paddles or wheels, by dsconnect-
ing the connecting rod of the deranged engine.
This was the case in the outward voyage, when
one engine propelled the G. w., during 81 hours,
at the rate of 81 knots per hour.


These engines are each 200 horse power !:
they are worked by steam, not exceeding 81 lbs.
per square inch. An apparatus for reducing the
steam by expansion is attached, but rarely used
There are four boilers, each lOa feet long, 81
feet wide and l6 high. There three fire.
places to each floor, which terminate in fiue
that runs through the boiler, an extent of about
|26 feet, before it passes into the smoke funnel.
These four boilers are connected by valves to
one general steam pipe which supplies the two
|engines. Any one boiler can be shut off at plea
sure, and as three boilers with little extra fuel
can raise sufficient steam, the fourth can be cleans
ed out whenever required. The four boilers are
more than sufficient for the work, and consume
very little more coal than three; and at the same
time the iremen are not hurried, and the doors Of
the furnaces are repeatedly thrown open to keep
down the steam.


The consumption Of coal, both on the outward
and homeward passage to the United States, did
not exceed 81 lbs. per horse power, per hour.
In the toughest part of the homeward trip, when
the ship was week out Of port, and in better
trim from having consumed a considerable guam
titr of coal, the consumption was 5 to per hour.
The inconvenience to which steam boilers have
been heretofore subjected by the deposition of
salt and earthly matters, was obviated on board
of this ship, by peculiar arrangement, the in
vention of Messrs. Mandsley, Sons s. Field.
In Marine steam boilers, il is usual to blow off
La portion of the dcnsest salt water from the bot
tom Of the boiler, by means of a pipe or blow off
cock. In this manner, portion of the strongest
brine is forced out--but the quantity is limited
and much fuel wasted by the loss OF heat.
IN octb tbo ~ Mo, br,, II,


pump is attached to the bottom of each boiler,
and draws off constant stream of brine, the loss
Of which is supplied by pipe conveying hot wa
ter from the reservoir, which, pouring into the
boiler, keeps up a constant current, thereby pre-
venting decomposition and subsequent concretion.
Supposing the density of the water Of the ocean


to be 100, and that deposition cannot take place,
| in other words that the waters would hold the
salt and other earthly matters in solution, until
its density is reduced to &c Odds, the density of
the water in the boilers of the Great Western
was rarely less than 90. At the expiration of
| each trip, the boilers were as clean as if fresh


water only had been used. To ascertain the pro-
per quantity to be drawn off, and to regulate the


pumps accordingly, the density of the brine is
ascerained by letting portion OF it cool and try


ing it with an hydrometer. This simple substi-


tute for the old plan of blowing off has proved
so effcient, llat IL VIII no dOuDt De generally


adopted.


The boilers of the G.. w. are ofwrought iron,


square, with wagon tops. The maximum pres


sure is 81 lbs. to the square inch The moment
that the pressure of steam exceeds that amount,
the safety valve raises and the surplus steam


passes through the safety-pipe, TO the upper air.


From their shape and size, these boilers could


not withstand pressure of lbs. to the square


inch-and if they TO burst with that pressure,


only those in the engine and fire rooms would


suffer-the passengers and ship would escape


uninjured. But to guard against such an acci-


dent, which, on the ocean would produce great


eventual inconvenience, and in our own boats, for


the protection of life itself, it would be advisea


BILE to have two safety valves to each boiler, one


of each loaded to the maximum pressure it woult


be perfectly prudent to carry, and then cased ant


locked up, only to be visited by the commander


The others, as at present, accessible to the engi


neer. By this means, the engineer can alway.


diminish, but never increase the pressure, and by


consequence the danger. Rash and inexperienced


as many of our steamboat captains are, it would


often be unsafe to entrust the keys of the safety


valve cases with them. Unless they have been


proved perfectly competent and trustworthy

 WAsHrNGToN July 9.

 Congress has at length adjourned, and the people may now rest for season under the consciousness that their worst enemy is no longer to be feared. The fact was, the wish of some of you Wall street merchants was fulfilled to the letter, for the Hall was lite- ral furnace, hot enough to fry the largest sal amander in all Christendom. It was also hot in another sense, to the great sorrow of the Locos who, to speak the truth. have fared worse with the Wings, than did the arch enemy in the twinge of the red hot tongs of St. Dunstan, when he was experi- menting and tinkering little on the Welsh mountains. It is hoped that you will Lynch the creatures at your next election. They are our little patriots, who like young birds, open their mouths just wide enough for son1e- thing to be put in them. But moderate as they are, the stock of glory on hand at the White House is so small, that Van Buren cannot give them a single meal. A ""big cheese"" was promised at the beginning of the session, but in that case the Magician has forgotten to follow in the footsteps of his illustrious predecessor.

 Yesterday morning, Messrs. Campbell and Maury, of Tennesse, had a pugilistic encoun- ter in the House, few minutes after it ad- iourned. They were much bruised, and each received brace of black eyes. The circumstances were as follows: It appears that early on Sunday morning, MT. Maury was very active in procuring call of the House, in order to show to the country who were the delinqucnts. MT. Campbell was among the absentees, and was brought to the bar with the rest in custody of the Sergeant at-arms. By eight o'clock, when the House adjourned, the latter went to his colleague and reproached him for his conduct in aid- ing the call, at the same time alleging that MT. M. had done it with view to injure him (Mr. O. at home, among his constituents. Continuation and recrimination followed. and each gentleman honored his opponent with the epithet ""liar,"" scoundrel,"" and so forth. As might be expected, personal conflict was the result, and blows were be- slowed in abundance. Not more than five members remained when the FRAcAs com- menced, and they, of course, did not at tempt to interfere. After the belligerents had belabored each other to their hearts content, they suspended hostilities, retired to their respective homes, and have not been seen since. It is said they are so well satis- fled with their mutual infictions, that no doubts are entertained as to further proceed ings.

 Nothing of interest occurred this morning except the resolution of MT. Adams, denying the right of the House to enforce the attend ance of members on the Sabbath, unless in extreme cases. This was rejected by large majority. At twelve o'clock on Satur- day night, the venerable gentlemen retired, after having been in attendance fourteen hours. On a cali of the House being order ed on Sunday, by unanimous consent his name was struck from the list ofthose whom the officers were directed to take into custo- dy. His age was considered sufficient cause for exemption. This morning, how ever, he waved thatsprivilege. and with much warmth insisted that such proceedings were unlawful, more especially when it was con sidered that the early part of the session had been trified away in doing nothing.--N.

MEssRs EDITORS: SIRs, have long been de-
sirous of presenting you few of my vague reflec-
tions, on the great cause of Native rights in the
United States, and as my language may approx
mate in some sort to the tone of remonstrance,
must entreat you to bear with me, and attribute it
solely to my love for the sacred principles, which
you SO boldly and so faithfully advocating


| know not whether sThe Native American
was expected intended at its origination to OPP
pose or sustain either Of the present parties in the
United States; if it were, did not so understand
1t; but grieve to say, the tone and manner lre-
quently adopted in that print, may Justly lead rs
to suspect that it stands arrayed against the De-
mocratic Party, and against the present Admin
istration.


Were Native Americaas in the United States
permitted to differ from one another, without the
interference. of third Party, then might we, if
we pleased, ''agree to disagree to any extent;
but when our conscientious discrepancies of opin-
ion are to divide us, that foreign enemy may
step in between us and ""rde rough shod'' over
both parties, then think that print dedicated to
the preservation of our rights, and the publication



madversons on either of the great american po-
Itlcal parties of the day.


/ have the honor of being an humble member
of the Democratic Party in the United States, and
my opinions are, if know my heart, based upon
the conviction, that equal rights are the lust pre-
negatives of native born American citizens; but
am far, very far, from thinking, that every foreign
er who comes voluntarily, or is transported to our
shores, and who spends FIVE years in riotous and
turbulent violations of those just and equitable
laws, which were formerly sufficient to govern
the American People; but which, in latter times,
(snce hundreds and thousands of foreign ruffians
have been permitted to affiliate with us,) are per-
petually set aside for Lynch law-an anarchcal
foreign phrase, whose very sound smacks strong
ly OF Hlbernian origin. say, | am far from
thinking, that such as these should enjoy equal
rights, lmmunltles and privileges with the native
children OF the soil, stand on an equal political
footing with the native members of the Democra-
tic Party; and | am far from being alone las one
of that Party) in this opinion.


1t the leaders of the Democratic Party have
seen fit to adopt into their ranks vascillating and
unprncipled mass of foreign s'Lazaron,"" many
OF whom have probably been disemboweled from
every transatlantic prison and penitentarv. thca,
atone Will have to rue it; and bitterly, too so far
as party elevation is concerned But why should
the whole Democratic Party be assailed for the
errors of their leading men!


l nave long since forewarned the Democratic
Party OF this city and State, New Orleans and
Lonislana,) that the tenure by which they held
the trained band of foreign mercenaries who
would throw up their caps and hurrah for ssPat-
rick Mick Buren, would prove precarious.
That these wretched tools, the majority of whom
were utterly destitute of principle or patriotism,
and, indeed, who hardly understand the meaning
n tha tarvp xubo +
reason or reflection, but were merely influenced
by selfish and base considerations, and belief
that they would enjoy greater opportunity for
Jacobnlcal RIGHTEOUSNESS bv identifying them
selves with the Democratic Party; say I have
often warned them that these degrading appenda-
ges would at some future period eventually prove
the ruin Of our Party. And have they not already
almost consummated our destruction! Already
have thousands of the purest Native American
iatrots-men who would lay down their lives
LOT their country in lingering torments-from
principle land not under the influence of whiskey
and an hurrah! )-already saw, have thousands
OF our best citizens abandoned the Democratic
ranks because they could not and would not CON
descend to be identified with all the scum and
of1al which Europe can void upon our shores


Already have foreign citizens, (unwiselv and
nnwarrantably permitted to interfere with the
institutions of our land) by their latitudinarian
or rather their levelling and agrarian theo-
ries, and anarchical projects, startled the apprehen
slons and awakened the fears of every true patriot
for the permanency of our republican form Of 90
vernment, and by the adoption of an odous for
e1gn appellation, ''Loco Foco,' almost expunged
the venerable name of Democracy from our ma
tiOnal nomenclature.


And was it reasonably to be expected when
the day OF trial came, that the principles which
they professed, and hurrah'd for, would induce
them to compromise or jeopardise their own in
terests! No! The moment they had begun to
suspect that the Democratic Party was struggling
tor existence, that moment they (as was to have
been expected) abandoned it, and many are now
Its most violent opponents in this city. Indeed
conscientously believe That large portion of the
strange and incomprehensible changes in public
opinion Ssheh have recently agitated and asto-
nisned the People of the United States, NAV be
attributed to the sudden and unexpected abandon
ment OF the Democracy by those gangs of nah,-
raiized citizens who are bound to no American
party by any tie save that of base and unprincinled
sefshness and cupidity. r'oN

Express, and beats Sammy Slick the clock ma

commend it to the immediate attention Of ]. s.
JONES' as patriotic incident which, if properly
managed, would produce piece more than equal
to Liberty Boys Mr.. Brown is the writer Of
the adventures, and in truth he has proved con-
vincingly that his imagination is most prolific.
He commenced with preamble about the scausa-
ton why of the movement, and then goes on to
give particulars item by item, of the course he
took, and what he saw and heard. He was ac-
companied by five others, and they all went
through the woods. He says at nightfall they
found themselves in tremendous windfall--the
trees crossed in everv direction, through which
they forced themselves like small fish through
salmon net. He says:


ssThe proximity of some huts prevented our

Of sleep during the last forty hours, | had the
consolation Of getting my back against tree
with my knees drawn up to keep my feet out
of the water, which refreshing posture was dis
turbed about two o'clock in the morning by

was fair and beautiful, but in the forest the
slant dripping Of the trees was like shower
bath from an ice-house. Our course was con-
tinued climbing over fallen logs, or swimming
through thick-set hedge Of brush wood, with the
expedition of fly through saucer of honey""


Almost starved to death he emerged from the
thicket with his companions, and all went to an
Irish hut to satisfy the keen demands Of appe-
tite, but finding nothing there but pates, and them
small and few in a hill, he steered his course to
another hut, which proved to be a true Yankee.
Hear him:


""Upon entering the dwelling, which was com
posed Of one room, without chimney, but with
a tremendous pile Of wood burning upon hearth,

in spite Of your vagaries, how universally does

There were nine children in the family. A little
girl pertly remarked, there was plenty of chill

was, however, an industrious man, who will one
day have a good farm; for the big boys split long
shingles all the evening, to use for boards in
covering barn, while the father shaved them.
slept among the children, who knotted up like
nest Of eels-but how would you expect children
bred in the woods, to know the points of compass
to bed!


''On Tuesday morning, after eating hearty
breakfast, crossed the branch of the Yamaska in

for the night. The rebels were near by, and

whole nights and one day mader hay mow!
He concludes as follows:

a Yankee dry-goods seller Of Montreal ordered

eating with rebels. This man belongs to a
class of Yankees in Canada, who expect to
grow fat by licking, not independently their
own paws like the bears, but the posteriors
of British Royalists. Several have come out
to prejudice the Vermonters against Canadian
freedom; but so universal is public sympathy in

We sometimes feel that we would like
more room, when we see speech like that
Of the Hon. S. S. Preniiss Of Mississippi.
His observations at the Boston dinner came
TO us with freshness as agreeable as it is
surprising. We have scarce ever seen in
a speech mainly based upon politics, such
humor, grace and dignity--such strength OF
thought--so much beauty of expression.
Although meeting a crowd Of highly edp-
Gated. intellectual stTAngers--ln land far
indeed from his home, he seems to have
felt in full possession of all his powers.
Standing on ''the broad platform of the Con

that his feelings were their feelings, and
that every word from his patriot heart must
strike the ""electric chain whereby we are

ASSAULT AND Loss OF LIFE IN VICKs-
BURG.--The following outrageous proceed
ings are noticed in the Vicksburg papers
as having recently taken ace in the vi
riniiy of that city. A family Of Germans
(the father and three sons) occupied house
on the road leading from Vicksburg to Jack
SON. To this house the father invited
party of desperate scoundres to assist him
against his sons, who he said, had m TREAT
ed him. The invitation was accepted and
accordingly, for the purpose of assisting
the father, a band Of Germans collected
and proceeded to the house 10 lynch the
sons. About III O'Clock at night thev col
lecled around the house and broke open the
door, and fired twice at the inmates who
were above stairs. Those who were above
fired down and Mr. Ieltone Of The Iynchers,
fell dead. The assauIters then precipitately
fled, leaving their comrade dead upon the
lIor One of the inmates of the house al
SO was dangerously wounded.


The three young men who were here
intended to suffer by the decree of Judge
Lynch, have been arraigned before a Court
IN charge If killing Mr. Helt, but were
promptly discharged Since then, three of
Helt's cndjntors, named Hartman, Mau-

 Terrific Tempest-This place and it's vici- nity was visited on the evening of the 10th inst, by one of the most remarkable thun- der showers that we ever witnessed-remar- kable, not for it's great extent or for the quan- tity of raiR-for in both these respects we have known it exceeded, but for the clouds being, apparently, in the very midst of us, so that the atmosphere seemed filled with the elec- tric fluid, which was playing about amongst us as it is frequently seen to do, in the clouds, at a greater elevation from the earth. It was, indeed, sublime and awful scene, we'll call culated to impress the mind with sense of mans insigni6cance, and of the matchless power of his Creator. The report of the nearest discharges, unlike those at distance, were accompanied by no reverberation or rumbling sound, but were like the discharge from an electric battery,-simply, quick, angry snap, not unlike the discharge of musket, but of more spiteful sound, such as we should suppose musket would make, if charged with percussion powder. This ap- pearance, of course, was confined to those who were near to the place of the discharge, while, to those more distant, the reverbera- tions were apparent One of the heaviest discharges fell upon the dwelling house of Samuel Daniels, opposite the Central Ex-, change, but was so well protected by the house conductors of the new construction, that the fluid was conveyed safely into the earth, without doing any damage to the building or its inmates. The barn ef Will liam w. Patch, about two miles westerly from the village, protected in like manner, also received. unharmed, a heavy discharge. Another discharge, went down the lightning rod of the factory of Wm. B. Fox & Co.,, on Green street. Alarge chesnut tree near the wire factory on Salisbury street was struck and very much rent and shattered. On Plea sant street, buttonwood tree was conside- rably injured by discharge, which, very evidently, ,oent upaOard from the earth to tie, cloud, circumstance, which, as is we'll known to the scientific, is not of uncommon occurrence, but. of which, considerable portion of the community seem not to be aware. In this instance, the splintering of the wood is all in an upward direction, and the splinters that remain attached to the tree, are attached by the upper end and the other indications correspond herewith, leaving no room for doubt as to the fact. This shows us the importance of having lightning con- ductors so constructed, as to receive the dis charge, and convey it off, in either direction, with the same facility y.- Worcester (Nfs.) Spy.

 The Diference.--A gentleman engaged in manufacturing informs us that, two years ago, he purchased six thousand pounds of wool in one lot, at .fiy-eigh cents pound.- This year he finds no difficulty in getting wool ofthe same quality for thirty three cents pound. Twenty five cents a pound, taken from the profits (for it costs as much to raise wool now as then) will make something of difference to every man who keeps sheep. It may perhaps be thought that what is lost by the farmer goes into the pockets of the man. ufacturer But not so. Not a manufactur- CT m the country is doing 90 profitable busi- ness now, as he was when wool was fifty to sixty cents pound. The destruction of the American System, the act next to the de-

 

 son most prided himself, struck a deadly blow at the interest of the Farmer and Man ufacturer, from which they will never com pletely recover.-(Dorer W. H) Herald.

 S'r Lires Lost.-Fxtract of letter, dated Berlin, (Md.) July l5. ls3s.-An awful scene took place on Wednesday last, in Sinepux- ent Bay, Md. opposite Captain John Hud- sons place, which you are well acquainted with. A party of persons, numbering about forty, went to the beach to bathe on the above day, and while returning, John Powell's boat was capsized in about the mid- dle of the channel, which is not more than 60 or 70 yards wide. There were 20 persons in the boat, six of whom were drowned their bodies were found and inferred yester- day. The names of these unfortunate per- sons are Rachel Hudson, Ann Hudson, and Mary Hudson, daughters of Thomas Hudson; Nancy Bowen, and James Hickman and his sister-the latter of the family of Bayley Hickman.

 Accident and DeGth.-A German emigrant was killed at Black Rock yesterday, on board a canal boat, in passing under low bridge. He stopped his head, but unfortu- nately laid it on chest, and it was struck by one of the timbers of the bridge, which knocked off the upper part ot his skull and killed him instantaneously.

THE HON. HENRY CLAY.",,"Clay, ia this city, who communicates 4
statement Of Mr.. Clay's early opinions OF
the subject of slavery. As one of the grea
orators and statesmen Of the nation, we duIy
honor Mr. Clay. But when his friends bring
him forward as candidate for the office o
President of the United States, it is our duty
as citizens, and especially as abolitionists
10 examine his relation to the GREAT
QUESTION, whose importance now over
shadows all others, We are seeking, anC
confidently expect to witness, the voluntary
and entire abandonment ofslavery through
out this beloved republic. In this view, l
does not become US to overlook the follow
ing FACTS respecting Mr.. Clay:


l. He is stakeholder, and has never e
mancipated any Of his slaves, or intimateC
any intention ofdoing SO.


2. He is one of the founders, and the ac
tual President of the American Colonization
Society-which was formed and has ever
been controlled, by shareholders, avowedly
for the benefit slavery, by the removal Of
the free negroes, although it's managers have
allowed, and do still allow, it to be pushed
into favor at tho North as a means of exter-
minating slavery.


3. He is the reputed and acknowledged
author of the ""Missouri Compromise"" in
1920, by which the spirit of liberty was
broken down, and the nation beguiIed into
complete subseTiency to slavery. In his
speech on that subject he treated with con-
tempt the laboring classes of(reemen, called
them ""whte slaves"" and contrasted their
situation with that of""black slaves'' and pro-
nounced the condition of the latter to be far
superior, and spoke with adherence of our
wives and daughters being obliged to per-
form labors which he was pleased to call
""servile."" There is no evidence within
our knowledge that he has altered his views
respecting the social rank of those who labor
with their hands.


A. He is the author of the project for the
acquisition of Texas, having made the first
motion on the subject in the House of Rep
resentatives, on the 3rd Of April, 1920. And
there is no reason to suppose he has ever a.
bandonsd the project. The zealofthe south
ern papers in his interest forbids doubt on
the subject.


S. Ho is irrevocably and in principle op-
posed to the abolition of slavery in the Dis
trct of Columbia and Florida. His resolu.
tons offered in tho Senate as an amendment
to Mr.. Calhoun's, virtually charge the peti.
TONERS on this subject with q breach of the
public faith. In this respect he goes quite
beyond even Mr.. Van Buren,, who rests hii
pledge to veto bill for the purpose, sole
ly on existing expediency.


@. He is on good grounds believed to be
opposed 10 the call of convention in Ken
lucky for the amendment of the State Con.
stitution, and principally for fear they will
take measures to facilitae the abolition Of sla
very in the State. All the leading papers
Of the State in his interest oppose it, and his
son as well as his leading friends who were
members Of the late Legislature were siren,
uously opposed to the bill.


7. He has openly given his voice for the
exclusion of abolitionists from the privileges
and sympathies of society. In his speech
on Mr.. Calhoun's resolution, he urged the
Importance of ""kseping the aboliticnist:
separate and distinct from all other classes
standing out in bold and prominent relief
unmixed with the rest of the community
WITHOUT GENERAL SYMPATHY,
and exposed to the overwhelming power o.
the united opinion ofall who desire the peace
harmony, and union of our confsderacy;'
or as the language is understood to mean, ex.
posed to Lynch law.


Now we have no authority to pledge OF
control the votes Of other abolitonists, but
we give it frankly as an obvious inference
from the above facts-and il IS all the in
ference we wish to make-that for abolition
lists to lend any support to such candidate
will be to renounce their principles and null
lify their measures, and that it will be more
honorable for aboltionists to allow any 9th
er candidate to be elected without their
votes, than for them to give their votes, un-
der any circumstances, for Henry Clay.
And if the Wing party are in such predic-
ament that they cannot succeed without Sc
curing the votes of THE shareholders of the
South and the abolitionists of the North, we
can only say, that, as we had no hand in
bringing them into the dilemma, we have
no wish to interfere with the due exercise
of their own best wisdom in regard to the
manner in which they shall conduct their
own affairs. Only let them pardon us for
not being able to see any good reason why
THE NORTH should be compelled to make
all the sacrifice in the case; GYespecidlly,
when-be it noted,-the abolitionlsts are
actuated by principle. and have in their
power all the real interests Of the country.
and even of the South, while the slavehold-
ers have nothing TO surrender in the COM

nate WILL.

Tom Towson was telling me story the
other day about the way he was first intro
duced TO his present wife, Colonel Ridge
ly's daughter Now can't tell it as well
as Tom told me but W ill tell it as well as
| can.


Tom, you see, was poor, and had but a
sorry education; but he was very quick to
learn, and it was said that Tom had the
clearest head in the country. Tom lived
on Poverty Plantation, as he called it, with
old widow Towson, his mother, and the
farm, which was small was all they had be-
tween them, The f4ct is, Tom was hand
some fellow, in hoElespun or in broadcloth.
One cloudy afternoon, Tom went down in
Silver Valley TO see old RidgeIy about a
division line on Joe Ginson's plat Of Power
ty Plantation.


A storm came on just abont as he drew
opposite Col. Ridgely's lane gate K. Col.
Ridgely was a proud old chap; rich too;
and report said that his daughter Lucy was
almighty handsome, now Lucy bad been
brought up in the best style, and was a
high lady in the neighborhood Some said
that she had refused several capital offers;
but that was not here nor there, as Tom
you know, could not think other.


the storm ragged, and in rides Tom,
hooks his horse to an apple tree, and goes
up the wide steps, and ends with loud
knock at the door Jim Squirrel opened
the door, an Ole negro who had carried
water to TOMS father when he (Fom's fa-
ther) Graded in Ridgey's green fields.


'1'he Col inl'


yes sir, come in was the ready res
ponse.


Tom was led into large old fashioned
parlor, where he found the Colonel read
ing, his wife sewing, and his daughter
writing. The old man nodded without
rising ,and told Tom TO sit down; while the
old lady verv reseryedly drew her chair
closer to the wall Tom felt little curl
Gus. The daughter, too, threw two or
three beautiful gances at him, which made
him feel still more curious. He made so
many bunders in telling his business, that
kind smile began to show itself upon the
faces of all in the room, which encouraged
Tom, who instantly recovered his selfpos-
session and added to their mrth by many
intentional errors and oddities.


Col, said Tom, tits quite out of the
question for us to settle this now


why so' inquired the Col.


ON account qf your daughter, sir, re-
piled Tom.


My daughteH' returned the Colonel, as
tonshed what has she to do with it ?
why, added Tom, she has knocked me
into a cooked hat with those black eyes of
hers


The old lady drew up, although she
could not suppress a smile, while the
daughter blushed, in spite of her efforts to
laugh contemptuously AS for the old
Colonel, he was so astonished at Toms
impudence, that for while he lost the
use of his tongue. They all looked at Tom
in silence, and in the meantime they re-
marked his figure, high forehead and in
telligent eye: while the irresistible good
humor of his countenance entirely dlsarm-
ed the Col who burst out with hearty
laugh at Lucy. Miss Lucy curled her
sweet lip into sort ofgood humored scorn,
and hastily withdrew.


The next thing we see is Tom, in his
homespun, seated at the supper table, de-
lighting the Colonel with his droll stories,
complinenting the daughter, and hattering
the old lady The old lady put plenty OF
sugar in Toms tea, and Miss Lucy was a
full half hour in drinking one cup.


Tom took leave shortly after supper.


sD-n that fellow!' cried the old man,
as Tom rode out into the Jane, and the
tears of Joy still stood in his eye.


lie is quite handsome quietly remark
ed the old lady.


: Not he reioined Miss Lucy, and few
months after, she was Toms wife.

THE TRUE ISSUE.",,"


The editor of the Washington Chronicle,
fMr. Calhoun's Editor who formerly gave
the appelation of monarchist, to the admin
istration, but who, since the somerset of Mr.
Calhoun, has gone over to them, keeps this
alsehood at the head of his editorial col
nmn:


""THE True IssuE-'Shall ours be a gov
ernment ofthe Banks or a governmental the
Peoplel Shall we have a constitutional
Treasury or an unconstitutional National
Rank-shall we have constitutional cur
fency ofgold and silver, or one OF irredeem-
able paper? Shall we live under the des.
potism of moneyed ariStocracy or under
The Safeguards of a free constitution?' ""


This is not the true issue. The true is
sue is-Shall ours be government of the
people or government ofthe Office holders?
Shall we have constitutional currency of
gold and silver, aided by paper currency
Issuing from Nationa' Bank, always conver-
bible into gold and silver at the option of the
holder, or shall we have an Executive Sub
Treasury system, in which the office-hold
ers will be every thing and the People moth
inga Shall we live under the despotism of
an irresponsible Executive, or under the
safe. guards of free constitution Let the
Van Buren, Sub Treasury party abide by it.
They 60 for an increase of executive pow
er, patronage and immunity. They wish to
apply the English maxim to our President,
that the King can do no wrong-as was
practically done in the reign Of Jackson
They would convert this government into
pere machine to enrich ofice-holders and
their friends. They are intent upon sus-
tanning, as they have already built up,
host of brokers and private usurers, to feed
and fatten on the labor of the productive
classes, in direct opposition to that princi-
pie of freedom and equality, which lies at
at the foundation of our institution. The
principles of the Van Burenitos and the Lo-
CO Focos are the offspring of barbarous
age, and should they be established in this
country, our free constitution must become
dead letter. Nay more instead of being


safeguard, it will be converted into an en-
gine OF destruction, and be made to over
throw the libe ties it was intended to pre-
serve.


Let the people therefore look to the issue
and be not deceived. 1t is not whether Har-
rlson, Vpn Buren,, or any other man shall
be President. 1t is contest of principles.
. Let us vindicate the Constitution and sus-
tain it as our fathers did, in the good old
days of Washington. Let us rally at the
polls and huTl from their seats the present
corrupt ofhce-hOders, who, not content with
TRIPPING the public expenditures. and by
their wicked experiments bringing hous-
ands OF industrious and laboring citizens to
ruin, now wish to yoke us to the Executive
car, and bind US TO do his will. d.

THE HON. HENRY CLAY.",,"Al one of the great orators and statesmen
Of the nation, we duly honor Mr. Clay. But
when his friends bring him forward as can
didate for the office of President of the Uni
ted States, it is our duty as citizens, and es-
pecially as abOlltionsts, to examine his rela
tion to the GREAT QUESTION, whose i'm
portance now overshadows all others. We
are seeking, and confidently expect to wit
ness, the voluntary and entire abandonment
of slavery throughout this beloved republic.
In this view, il docs not become Us to over
look the following FACTS respecting Mr.
Clay:


|. He is a Shareholder, and has never g.
mancipated any of his slaves, or intimated
any intention Of doing So -.


2. He is one of the founders, and the ac-
tual President ofthe American Colonization
Society-which was formed and has ever
been controlled, by shareholders, avowedly
for the benefit Of slavery, by the removal of
the free negroes, although its managers have
allowed, and do still allow, it 10 be pushed
into favor at the North as means of exter-
minating slavery.


8 He is the reputed and acknowledged
author of the ""Missouri COMPROMISED"" in
1920, by which the spirit of liberty was
broken down, and the nation beguiled into
complete subserviency to slavery.


A. He is the author of the project for the
acquisition of Texas, having made the first
motion on the subject in the House of Rep
resentatives, on the Sd Of April, 1890. And
there is no reason to suppose he has ever
abandoned the project. The zeal ofihe south
ern papers in his interest forbids doubt on
the subject.


s. lie is irrovocably and in principle OPP
posed to the abolition of slavery in the Dis
trict of Columbia and Florida. His resolu-
tions offered in the Senate as an amendment
to Mr. Calhoun's, virtually charge the petit
TONERS on this subject with breach of the
public faith.


6. He is on good grounds believed to be
opposed to the call of a convention in Ken
lucky for the amendment of the State Con-
stitution, and principally for fear they will
take measures to facilitate the abolition of
slavery in the State. All the leading papers
osthe State in his interest oppose il, and his
son as well as his leading friends who were
members of the late legislature were siren
uously opposed to the bill.


4. He has openly given his voice for the
exclusion of abolitionists from the privileges
and sympathies of society. In his speech
on Mr. Calhoun's resolution, be urged the
Importance of excepting the abolitlonists
separate and distinct from all other classes,
standing out in hold and prominent relief,
unmixed with the rest of the community,
WITHOUT GENERAL SYMPATHY,
and exposed TO the Overwhelming posrer of
The united opinion ofall who desire the peace,
harmony, and union Of our con[ederacy;"" !""
or as the language is understood to mean,
exposed to Lynch law.


Now we have no authority to pledge or
control the votes Of other aboltionists, but
we give it frankly as an obvious inference
from the above facts-and it is all the in
ference we wish to make-that for abolition
lists to lend any support TO such candidate
will be to renounce their principles and null
lify their measures, and that it will be more
honorable for abOlitionists to allow any other
candidate TO be elected without their votes,
than for them to give their votes, under any
circumstances, for Henry Clay.

the most violent abolition paper:

Somebody, in the London Times, is chopping
us Americans into minced meat; and all the sins
we ever committed, be they in Vicksburg, or
Arkansas, or Boston, by Judge Lawless or the
Lynch mobs, are paradcd out at length to horrify
Europeans from such a Lynch-killing, mob-de-
stroying, contract-brcaking, lawless-expounding,
stcamboat-hlowing-up set of rascals. They make
us worse than we used TO make out Texas.
However, tins is the dark side. 1t is clear that
the United States arc now the amazement Of the
European world the faith Of our merchants, the
wonderful rccupcrativc power Of our People in
crisis that would have staggered Europe for
quarter Of a century, having but made that crisis
add to our moral importance. John Bull handles
us with gloves, in comparison with his manner
when he takes up France, Italy, or Germany,
or Turk, or Tartar. He likes Brother Jonathan
