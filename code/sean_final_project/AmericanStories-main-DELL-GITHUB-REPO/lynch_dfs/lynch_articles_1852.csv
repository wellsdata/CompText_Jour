script of the 7th inst. has the following
interesting correspondence from Scott
Valley, .Siskiyou Co., date, July 25th :


Since I last wrote to you, the In
dians of this county have been COM
hitting hostilitics and depredations up
on the whites and their property.


About the first of this month Mr..
Christy, a miner, was robbed in this
valley Of his hat, blanket, and seventy
dollars, by the Shasta Indians, whilst
going from Dead Wood Creek to the
Lone Star Ranch.


On the 9Th alt., some thirty Shasty
Indian warriors came over to fight this
valley Indians, who number only four.
teen warriors, and on the evening of
the same day Mr.. Bruce lost three an
imals, whilst passing from Quartz Val
ley to the Star Ranch. , The next
morning John the Indian Chief start
ed to search for them, and the Shas-
tas forbid him, and said that he nor
the whites should search for them, and
if the Bos:ons (whites) wanted to fight
they would give them battle.


The Chief communicated this Indian
insult to the proprietors Of the Star
Ranch, and company of ten men,
well armed were raised Immediately,
and went down to Johnson's Ranch,
at the lower end of the valley, where
the Indians were camped. When we
arrived at the rancLeria they did not
want to fight. We charged them rot
to insult the whites any more, nor TO
molest this valley Indians, and then
departed. On our arrival at the Star
Ranch we saw to our surprise, Calvin
Woodman stretched upon a bier life
less. He was going from Johnson's
Ranch to Dead Wood, when two Shas-
ia Indians overlook him and shot two
yauger balls through his body. About
fifteen minutes after, some packers
came up to Woodman and learned of
him who were his murderers. The
next day Sheriff Whipple, with five
other men made an attempt to take
these Shasta Indians prisoners and
convey them to Yreka, but these des-
peradoes broke for the mountain, and
when they ascendcd the first hill they
turned upon the whites and commenc-
ed firing During the battle Deputy
Sheriff Whipple was wounded above
his hip and three Indians killed, and
a number wounded. One mule was
killed, and another wounded in the
head. 1t is surprising that no more
men were injured. There were some
thirty Indians well armed with rifles,
and standing on a hill behind trees,
and only six white men in the valley
below, and nothing to shield them
from bullets and arrows. A company
Of twelve men from Scott Bar Valley
went over to Shasta Valley and shot
an Indian whilst taking an Indian
nancheria.


They captured one of the Indians
who killed Mr. Woodman. The next
day Squire Steele raised company
consisting of twenty men and the Shas-
ia chief, to catch the other murderer
and chastise the Shasta tribe. This
company followed the murderer to
Rogue river. and there fought two bat
ties with the Rogue Indians before
they captured the desperate. During
these two battles they killed some
forty Indians and wounded quite
number. No white men were killed
CT wounded. During this expedition
the Shasta chief ran away from the
the Scott Valley Rangers, and came
back to Shasta Valley, and killed one
of bis squsws and two pappooscs. Es-
quire Crosby raised three men and
caught the old scar-faccd chief and
hung him on tree on the spot. '""


On the oath these rangers hung the
murderer of Roodman at the Star
Ranch The Scott Valley Indians
were present and witnessed the lynch
law Of California. Whilst the Indian
was hanging by the neck, an Indian
lawyer made speech to his tribe and
advised them how to treat the whites
hereafter, and that would be their end
if they committed any more hostilities.


When they cut the body down, one
of the squaws packed it away, and they
burned it with pitch pine knots.


The Scott Valley Indians have
been peaceable ever since came into
this country, whilst the surrounding
Indians, the Trinity, the Salmon, Shas-
Ia, Klamath and Rogue river tribes
have been troublesome TO the whites
continually.


The above named tribes are lazy
and thievish, and when they come

White document live at Concord. know them, and
know that they signed it They are ready to make an
affidavit to this effect.


The Cooney certificate SAYS that one Halpin did not
sign the White document. His employer is whig and
he together with Cooney, persuaded Hapin to swear
.hat he did not sign that certificate will be recoleeted
that did not get up that document simply certified
that the persons whose names appended it were

to be perfectly true. find upon inquiry that Hapin,
when asked TO sgn the paper, answered, | will but nut

These things prove that the triumph which the Coo
neyes snpposes they had gained with reference these
three cases, is no triumph at all.


Cooney went to most OF the lrishmen known to be in

fear, most OF them signed the paper So far as know
only one man refused His name is Connars The con.

With reference TO the Nashua and Dover certificates
| cannot speak from personal knowledge, but, il be
correctly informed their history very similar that of
The Manchester and Concord documents.


From the above facts it will be evident to the public
that the Cooneyte papers protesting 10 mbody the
Catholic sentiment OF New Hampshire with reference
to the test, he only matter have any lime touched

been received and have heretofore passed. and pass
as canent coin among whig politicians.


But II seems that Henry Clay wrote letter in ls4S

just such nomination that of Gen. Scott. We find

paper it is transferred from the New York Courier and
Enquirer paper that preends 10 advocate Gen. Scott
The hentcity OF the letter abundany established II
is published for the first time. and copy ii below.


The letter OF Mr. Clay is remarkable production in
respects than one II shows the sacrifice OF prn

ddaie points out the notorious incompetency Of Gen.
Taylor and it predicts consequence of his nom
inaton state of things which the condition of the whig

Jones Who doubts this with the volume of the event

But we give the letter Of Mr.. Clay, reserving other
comments for fitting occasion:


Extract of letter prittea by Htnvy Clay to the hig Err

And here, gentlemen would STOP but your request

But cannot help thinking that the Philadelphia Con.

fused be its candidate He proessed, indeed be
whig; but he enveoped himself in the dapey of quail

quarter might proceed In his letter the Richmond
Republican of the 10Th Of April last he declared his pur-

might be made by the Wing Convention. / know what

which he obtained it, What should be glad is,

On the great leading national which have
long divided parties he has any fixed opinions they

DEAR JoURNAL-lt was with feel
ing of sincere qualification that learn
ed, soon after writing my last, that the
influence of the Nevada Journal wa,
henceforth to- be thrown on the righl
side in politics, instead Of being, as here
tofore, Of a neutral character. .l.
| can now fraterni-e more fully with
you, and them shall have moro mate,
rial to write about, for will not an occa.
sional intimation of the progress of the
cause in our little corner of the State
be received with favor by our brother
Wings in the mountains Our county
is considered decidedly Wing, but as
yet the party question has never been
introduced into our elections. The fact
is, we are, as community, so generally
employed in our agricultural and kim
dred occupations. that it is by no means
easy to find good men who will consent
to stand as candidates for the Legisla-
ture. 1t is possible, however, that the
approach of the annual election may ex-
cite some sparks of party combat.


lcannot forbear noticing display Of
the Sons of Temperance, in connection
with the session of The Grand Division,
which came off Ycsterday, which have
seldom seen excelled in interest. The
order at this place consists of one Divi-
sion, the Eureka, embracing overa third
Of the adult American population, and
this merits the appellation of the Banner
Division. The Rev. Mr.. Wheeler, of
Sacramento, addressed the Brothers and
citizens, in beautiful buckeye grove
near the Mission, and the eloquent gen.
tleman did no discredit to his reputation
as an orator, and for the power of en-
claiming the attention of an audience. In
the evening collation. was served up at
the rooms Of the Division, of which the
members of the order with considera-
Bile ""sprinkling' Of the fairer portion Of
humanity partook. The hours of the
evening till long after midnight, flew
away in song and social chat, and lively
speeches. Among the ladies from abroad
who enlivened the occasion with their
presence was ""the fair one with the
golden locks the memory of whose
sunny smi G and blithsome vsice still
fingers, dare say, in the heart of many
a good-looking young miner Of the Noun
tain City Terbun sap.


In grim contrast with this season of
festiyty and social relaxation, turn 10
a couple of instances of the swift justice
which oyertakes the wrong doer in this
our land of California. Yesterday morn
ing, at the break of day, the body Of a
man was discovered on the Plaza Of the
Mission, suspended from a temporary
gibbet formed Of three scantling.


1t was found to be the body of no.
torious villain and horse thief named
Hernandez, who had been taken day
or two before by party of men whose
stock had been the subject of dcpreda-
ton. The affair was conducted with
such secrecy that nearly the whole COM
munity were ignorant of it until the
first rays of the sun revealed the life-
less body of the victim. or a


This morning The body of another Cal
ifornian, known 10 have been an accom-
plicc of Hernandez was discovered occu-
pying the same position. @s3


The Justice of the execution of these
these two miscreants is undoubted by
any, but there is at the same time
q very general condemnation of the Sc
crecy of the transactions.


Itis true that it looks too much as if
the exccutioners were afraid of the pub
lie sentiment, although there is no
doubt that body Of the citizens, after
having coolly considered the evidence,
would have consigned them to the same
short shrift. Strange to say, there is
no excitement in regard to the affair,
circumstance which probably arises
from the conviction in every breast, that
after all the strict justice of the fate
which befel these unhappy men cannot
be impeached. PEDRO.


July 29th.--A third victim of Lynch
law was expected here on the day of

citement in connection with the last, as
1t was done in daylight but the affair

service Of their country, and whose talents and expe-
Renee point them out as greatly my superos. Here,
loo are many gentleman who, though my juniors in
aars are nevertheless my seniors intellectual endow-
nsnls How happens that the claims of all these were
overlooked and the honor conferred upon humble
Individual myself, am at loss to conjecture. Since
however the position has been assigned me, and that,
TOO without solicitation on my part, take encourage
men in the belief that any lack OF mine will be sup

is true the people themselves have relieved US from
much of the responsibility which otherwise would have
deyOlved upon us-I mean on the main question. The
democracy of the State, with singular unanmity, have


declared James Buchanan to be their first choice for the
presidency That voice, so emphaticqHy expressed may
not be dsregarded trust that will not be regarded
out Of place for to say in this connexion that the
choice could not have fallen on more worthy mana

various matters growing out OF this pepexing question,

calculated to pour oil on the troubled waters than the


man Of your choice His firm but concatory tempera-

Rdent talents all conspre to designate him the
Bat gentlemen, while these are the views honestly
entertain, let not forget that there other disn
pushed gentlemen whose names prominently before

houd carry out in good faith, the wishes OF constt

A months seiourn on Fryar's Greek

morale of the diggings and opened up
scenes that I could not have anticipated
during the rosy days when the wonders
of Bailarat first flushed our Imagination,
with the prospect Of vast fields Of illimi-,

peace, unity, and security but at Fry.

reversed, and quarrels, dissensions, blood.

heard Of the matter. A surgeon is CALI

Courier, yesterday. was announced the
arrest Of DR.. G. Rayns, at Clarksville,
Tenn, on the charge of bigamy. We
have no doubt that he is the identical
operator who appeared in this city
month or two since, representing
himself as wealthy Southron, who.
orpastime, bought up, on three days
grace, some thousand bales of cotton
in this market, through the agency Of
one of our well known brokers, which
created a stir in the mork ct for a day
or two; but no one suffered except the
warehouse clerks, who had the trou.
ble Of marking and weighing for no.
thing. The speculator--that was the
character he assumed-next endeavor-
edto purchase the Bostona, and made
extensive arrangements to build a fast
packet, but he was soon called off to
Cincinnati.


Before starting to Cincinnati he fell
in with a gentleman of that city, with
whom he became quite intimate. On
the day he started to Cincinnati, while
in company with his new friend, he
met with man on the street. to whom
he spoke in very rough manner, and
demanded the settlement Of large
claim, which he pretended 10 have o.
gainst him; and the man, in presence
Of his Cincinnati acquaintance, made
over property in due form, located
somewhere down South. to the amount
Of 100000. He then introduced him
to his connexions, and in q short time
wooed and won the sister of the friend,
and they were married. The next
day he was advised by telegraph that
his presence was required immediate
ly on one of his southern plantations,
and borrowing large sum Of money
Of his new brother-in-law, started
South, leaving the wife of a day in
pledge.


The Southern gentleman next found
himself on Louisville packet, jour.
neying to New Orleans, and on the
way cultivated the acquaintance of the
Captains daughter, which were almost
accepted; his appealance and man.
ners were SO captivating and his
wealth supposed to be boundless. The
affair was wisely deferred until after
the boat should reach New Orleans,
and other preliminaries arranged. He
couldn't make it convenient to 90 to
New Orb ans, and stopped at some
way place to overlook large planta-
tion Of his, before he proceeded to the
city. On the arrival of the boa. at
New Orleans, it was soon ascertained
that the gay Lothario was consum-
mate swindler.


He was next traced to Paducah,
where he took another wife, most
lovely lady, but his true character hav-
ing been ascertained, he was pursued
and arrested at Clarksville, as VIC are
informed by telegraph.


Yesterday his Cincinnati wife, to-
gether with her brother, arrived here
on the steamer Yorktown, on their
way to Tennessee, to overhaul the vii.
lain and bring him tojudgment.--Lou.
Courier.


A later date says that considerable
excitement prevailed at Paducah, and
it was with considerable difficulty the
populace were restrained from lynch.
ing operation."

Committee, the Democratic Delegates
from the several townships of Placer
county, met in the Mechanics Town Hall
in Auburn, on Saturday, Aug. 25th, 1852,
for the purpose Of forming ticket to be
voted for (and triumPhantly elected at
the ensuing general election.


The Convention was called to order by
Philip Lynch, who proposed as President
the Hon. Seth Farewell which motion
being seconded, was unanimously carried.


The President was conducted to the
stand by Capt. John Nye. On taking the
chair the President returned his sincere ac-
acknowledgements for the honor conferred
upon him by the Convention in selecting
him to preside over its deliberations. He
reminded the Convention of the great ne
cessity of union, harmony, and cancellation,
for the sake of the principles held dear by
all good Democrats.


On motion Of J. S. Christy, Esq, the
Convention appointed the following


PIC, Presidents Capt John Nye and
Morris King.


On motion of Fl. o. Ryerson, Esq, the
following persons were appointed


Secretaries, ,--Philip Lynch and S. j..
Hubbard.


On molten, Gen. J. A. McDougal was
Thvited to take seat upon the stand
which he did, and was greeted with three
cheers.


On motion of J. S. Christy, Esq, a
ceinInittee of one from each township was
appointed to examine the credentials of
the different delegations, and report the
ratio Of repreSention.


The Convention then took recess for
one hour.


On re-assenbling, the Committee not
being ready to report, number of the
candidates in embryo were Severally called
out, and warmly applauded. They each
briefly addressed the Convention, de-
fining their respective positions, and con-
cluded by pledging their hearty support
10 the nominees Of the Convention, ,cao-
erer they might be.


The gentleman who was candidate for
Sdrveyor, Mr.. Hnman,) made quite All
original and ecceAtrc address, which kept
the house in continual fit of laughter.
The speaker remarked that this was his
frsr. or maiden speech, and he hoped to
God would he his last, as another such ii
n might prove fatal to the Convention.


The Committee on Credentials returned
and presented the following

stood. He said that it had been diligently
circulated that he was an abolitionist, and
free soiler. He discarded the idea of
ever being associated with either of these
factions; but on the contrary he was den-
tilted with the Cid Hunkers (cheers) in
the State of new York, believing them to
be the only true Democrats in the State
II had also been charged against him that
he was opposed tc the fugatlse slave law
In this he was also misrepresented, as he
was fully impressed, not only with its
constitutionalty, but its importance, and
he would ever be found among the fore
most in defending the compromise mta-
sures Of Congress. Now that he was
defeated in his nomination ne wished those
false reports cleared up, that the party
might know where he stood.


This explanation was warmly received
by the Convention.


The Convention then pssreeded to the
nomination of County Clerk, and five
candidates being named, resulted as fol-
lows:

18th OF April. The Alta California, in its
summary of news, says


There has been a marked improvement in
business throughout the State within the
present month. The rains are now over,
although the weather has not yet become set
tied. From North 20 South III the mining
di tricts, labor is realizing uniform success,
and the quantities of the precious metal
which have been put into circulation or
have passed through this city, afford the
best indication of the prosperity of the
times.


More Indian troubles are reported in the
South. The military post on the Gila has
been threatened, and a detachment Of six
ty men dispatched by Major iieintzalman
from Camp YUM, to ascertain if a supply
vessel, sent from San Diego, had arrived at
the mouth of the Colorado, was aattacked,
and seven men killed The Indians, two
hundred in number, and belonging to the
hostile Yumr tribe, were repul,cd. with
loss OF four or five. Mach difficulty in
maintaining post on the ella is apprehend-
ed The Indians remain quiet in most Of:
the northern districts OF the State; the only
disturbances which have been recorded dur
ing the month, occurred in the Shasta coun-
try. These have generally grown out OF
qmrrels with the miners, and although pro-

The emigration to this country continues
with unabated spirit. Hundreds of Chinese
arrive in every vessel from Hongkong. and

Indians is said to be the ostensible cause of tn,
rebellion, to which they have been melted by tn,
lower classes Of the native Californians, wht

Volunteer companies were organizing to marcf
against the Indians, and the Governor had ordered
Gen. Hitchcock, at Sonora, to despatch troops
forthwith to the of the citizens in the dis
turbed districts. The Governor had also ordered
down the detachment stationed at Fort Oxford

The Indian chief Antonio is reported to have
5000 fighting men under him, most Of whom are
well armed with rifles, and expert in the use Of
them.

The Nec Pear and the Weather Charge Of Kid,sap-
ping Governor R0ssutts Visit TO Annapoiis--
The Markets, &c.


BALTIMORE, January IS p. m.
The year has commenced bright and beau
tiful. with clear sky and mild atmosphere. being
most crafty ing change, in view of the character
Of the weather for fortnight past. The day, how
ever, is but slightly observed in this city, except
by the boys who burn powder and fireworks in
abundance.


Thomas McCreary was arrested yesterday charg
ed with kidnapping coorcd girl named Rachel
Parker. from West Nottingham, Chester county.
Pennsylvania. The girl is claimed as a slave be-
longing to Mrs. schoolfeld, Of this city, and
lodged in Campbell's depot, but has since been
moved to Jail to await further investigation of the
charge against McCrsary, who has been held to
bail for further examination. She having been
found in Chester county, the county in which the
late Mr. Gorsuch was murdered, il is said she was
brought to Baltimore without legal process under
the Fugitive law; those engaged in her arrest being
fearful of being vctimized also.


| The change in the weather has removed the en-
| barge the oyster trade, and quite number OF
| vessels arrived at our wharves this morning. The
supply had been entirely exhausted for two days.
Mr. Booth, the veteran tragedian, whose home is
in this city, appears night in his great character
of Richard, at the Holiday street theatre.
| The report of the death of Commander Lynch
which originated at Norfolk, turns out to be un-
founded. He was in good health on Monday even
ing at his residence in Baltimore county.


Governor Kossuth has accepted the invitation o
Governor Lowe, of Maryland, to visit Annapolis
and partake of the hospitalities of the executive
| mansion"

NEW YORK, Jan. lst.-The steamer Cherokee
with the California mails of the 5th, has arrived
having made the passage in 26a days. She
brings $l,7O0,000 gold on freight, and $780,
900 in the hands Of her passengers.


The principal matter of interest from Califor-
MIA is the alarming state of feeling among the
Indians upon the Colorado, and in the vicinity
of San Diego, Los Angeles, Santa Barbara, &c.
An outbreak had been commenced among the
Indians in those districts, and was daily assum-
ing more threatening character.


The steamer Golden Gate, from San Francis.
co, whence she sailed on the 9th of December
arrived at Panama with So 100000 in gold, be.

The snags in the Yuba river had been removed
at an expense of $4,000, by the citizens, who
are looking to Congress for aid in the improve
ment of the river. A steamer of large size had
descended as far as Marysville.


Several railroad projects were being enter
tained in different parts of the State, and of some
of them considerable stock had been taken.


Numerous murders had taken place among
the miners in the interior. Lynch law would
probably be applied to the perpetrators.


The Indian chief Antonio is reported to have
5000 fighting men under him, most of whom
are well armed with rifles, and expert in the use
of them. Antonio had sent formal declara.
tion of war, to the prefect of San Diego, and
had commenced operations by attacking the Hon
J. J. Warmers ranchero, killing one of his ser
wants, and destroying property, as well as driv-
