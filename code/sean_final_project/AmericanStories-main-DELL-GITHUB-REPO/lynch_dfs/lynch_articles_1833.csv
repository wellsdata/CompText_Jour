George. who was an orderly, wela-dispOsed lad, and member of ihe Baptist church, mildly requested him te desist, when the Oih- CT struck him a severe blow with his clench. ed hand. A rencOnntes ensued, in which l George threw Armislead on bed.

The following is an extract:

 ""The campaign for the next Presi- dency has already been chalked out by the regency, and covers but little ground.

POST OFFICE DEPABTMENq,.",,"The daily mail, which was petitioned for by most of the business men in St. Louis, has not been granted, in consequence of the peeuniary embarrassment of the Depart ment. Rumors are abundant in the papers, of the insolvency of the Department: and even the Globe admits deficiency of the revenue from that quarter.

 One of the consequences of this impov- erished state of the Post Office Finances, will be the discontinuance of many impor- tant routes in the various parts of the Un- ion. It IS already announced, that the dai- ly line to Lynchburg, Va has been diseon- tinued

 Under the administration of MT. Me- Lean, the Post Office Department yielded a revenue much more than equal to the supply of all it's wants: now, 1t Is beggared, and will have to appeal to the next Con- gress for relief from its embarrassments.- Under that administration, the extension and improvement of mail routes kept pace with the wants and the wishes of the coun- try: now, improvement IS stopped-or, more truly, Is going backwards. Under that adj ministration, there was certainty and secu- rity in the receipt and transmission of letters and papers: now, there Is neither the one nor the other.-.NisSoasl Rep.
