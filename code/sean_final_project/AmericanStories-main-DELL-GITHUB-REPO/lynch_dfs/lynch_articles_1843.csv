ion that the law did not require them to furnish a
sample Of the hhd--thus arrogating to themselves
the high perogative Of discriminating the judicial
construction Of law, enacted by Sovereign State,
for the protection of large and growing interest
of Sister States; and whereas the most prominent
factors in New Orleans did at the time of the as
sertion of the construction of the law by the said
inspectors, oppose by all means of remonstrance
in their power. the exercise of such an injustice
to the interest which they represented; and where
as their acquiescence was alone obtained by con-
straint and not willingly, the Inspectors refusing

continued from that day to the decision of the
Court in the case Of Messrs. Hill D. Snnott vs.

charge Of 40 cents per hid. in despite of every

""You must render your bill for inspection at one

South and, whereas the position we occupy is
one of high trust and responsibility, and from the
vasciflating course of the aforesaid inspectors,
ono of great danger, therefore in Justice to our
selves, and the interest which we represent, be it


Resolred, That his Excellency Alexander Mou-
ton Eovarnrr Of ho State ~ o,,;son, bo ro-
spectfully requested to grant unto us, and those
we represent, that relief and redress from the
grievances under which We labor, as is invested in
him by the laws of the State, and that he will ap-
point faithful and competent men for inspectors
of Tobacco, for the city and port Of New Orleans.


Upon which the ayes and noes were called for
by Mr.. Kelly, and decided by the following vote /:

Messrs. Price, West, Lonsdale, Yeatman, Ray
burn. Rogers, Galbraith, Garland, Crockett, Buck
ley, Lynch. ElImaker, Martin, O'Noi, J. w.
Ferguson, Peter Ferguson, Show and Reid lis.
Tho resolution of Mr.. Galbraith was then taken
up, amended, and adopted as follows:


Resoiped. That so far as the communication
from the Tobacco Inspectors relates to the discon.
finuance of the charge of 40 C. per hid, it meets
with the appreciation of this meeting, and IN PART
accomPishes the object had in view in calling the
meeting, the discontinuance of the unlauful charge;
and we now construe their communication to i'm
ply they will perform the same duties as hereto
fore, for which their fee will be sixty cents per
hid.


The chair appointed Messrs. Bowe, Kelly, Hop
kins, Price and Yeatman, tho Committee to exam.
inc into and report upon the defects in the exist
ing Tobacco laws of this State, when on molten
the Chairman of the meeting was added to the
Committee. On motion, ll r...


Resolred. That the foregoing Committee be.ro
qulred to make their report to meeting of tho
Tobacco Factors and buyers on the frs, Monday
in December next, and it shall be the duty of the
Chairman to call such meeting by public notice in
the city papers, at the expense of the Factors.


On motion, Resolved, That whom this meeting
adjourns, it will be 10 meet again on Thursday
evening next, 18th inst, at half past seven o'clock.


On motion tho meeting adjourned.


AT an adjourned meeting of the Tobacco Fac
tors held on April 18th, lS43 the proceedings
of the previous meeting we're read and approved.


On motion Of Mr.. Kelly, copy Of the cores
pondence that took place on Goth March, 1886,
between the Committee of the Receivers of To-
bacco, and The Tobacco Inspectors, was read to
the meeting, showing that the assertions made by
the Tobacco Inspectors in their communication Of
the 18th inst, were unwnrranted by facts.


On motion of Mr.. Bowe, se


Resolred, That while we depreciute extortiou,
whether in the shape of exorbitant charges or 9TH
erwise, we hold it undeniabIy due to our character
at home and abroad, that all charges for the trans.
action of the Same business, should be uniform,

Resolped, That in the opinion Of this meeting,
it is inconsistent with ordinary courtesy, and de.
rogatory to the character of an individual aspir-
ing to respectable association with New Orleans
Factors and Commission Merchants, to Interfere
with the customs of their neighbors seeking their
business by propositions to do it for less commits.

 TN THE HoTrpT Ar SESQT0N } H",,"CITY OF NEW \ ORk, To the Hon. Judges TA1L.MADeE and LYNCH:

 My humble thanks are due to the Court, for the privilege they have allowed me of preparing this commu nication, which con slider my duty to make them and the public at large, prior to sentence being pasSedupon ane on the charges on which stand convic- ted. If I were to enter into a full detail ot the various causes that have tended to bring me where now stand, should but recapit- ulate the history of many thoughtless youth who has entered upon the world with brilliant prospects, buoyan spirits, and con- fiding, generous hearts. I think circumstan- ces at present will justify mo in referring to incidents that have long since transpIred 1n this city, and under any other circumstances than the present, should be unwilling 10 ad- vert to them. stand before this court brNn- ded with that indelible mark, ""not0rious."" How this title happens to fix on me, shall briefly explain.

 In the year 1888, came to this city from the state of Ohio-the greater number of my relatives being citizens or residents of that state. Not a man with when had any ac- quaintance at home, refused me his intro. ductory letter to bis friends at New York; 2. and left my native state with every requi- site to con1g1ence and complete what might have ended in Il useful career, had not forgotten to heed that useful and wise admo. milton, ""keep good company"" My good character was maintained in this city with credit to myself until certain circumstances lam about to narrate, occurred, which swept from me my all - for clerk in this city without character, is one of the most pitia- ble objects that can be imagined. am sure an remembered (and perhaps with sorrow) by many that are now looking upon me.

 Gilbert F. Hays, at my request, 10 gratify my curiosity, in the month of July lS4l, led me into one of the store-r rooms belonging to the Police Department, and unfolded to mo the article, then almost consumed by moth, which, in connection with its owner, and cir cumstances connected with both, had the ef- feet of getting for me the bad name that now bear in the public prints. The article to which l refer is the cloak said to have been worn by the murderer of the wretched girl, Helen Jewett. l had peculiar sensa- tions as I looked upon the garment, that once enveloped so much guilt, and sadly thought too, of the unfair shufflng practised upon me- It is we'll known that my name, and the names of very many others in good standing in this city at that day, were compelled to appear to the public, before the trial of the person charged with that most shameful ot all crimes was terminated, and many still have cause to regret it - but none more so, or half so much, as the unfortunate convict that now addresses you. The pleasing man. ners of Richard P. Robinson won my atten- ton being boarder with him in the same house, his apparently harmless, gay and vo. latile character, and his simplicity and cor rect moral traits, so far as knew, gained for him my respect and admiration.

 These circumstances, connected with his standing in society, at that time, led to an acquaintance and intimacy on my part, pre- cisely in the same way that others became his friends. He, it is known, was apprehen- ded and charged with crime, that far ex' ceeds in enormity, any other that ever stain.

 S'ss'r..""''-~..""v--Ei--G. in -thia- -ctY. He and still continues in some measure, so to be, consequence ofthe result ofthe trial. In fact public indignation ran so high in this matter that vengeance was ready to satiato itself; 1; and can add with truth, did in some mea- sure Satiate itself upon one whose weak, help. less, and unsupported shoulders were little calculated to brave or withstand this nigh. ty torrent. That individual was the unfor- tunate creature who now addresses you.- During this excitement l was taken from the Washington Hotel in Q state of stupor, (which, by the by, do not plead as an ex- cuse,) and after an examination and commit. ment. Con charge which, under any other circumstances would have been overlooked,) l was ascertained to be an acquaintance of Robinson's. This, connected with the disco. very on my person of some notes that had passed between us, while was detained as witness against him., soon had the effect of gaining for me to name of ""Robinson's friend"" l was tried, could not raise funds enough to fec counsel, was convicted. Every body knows how Robinson was disposed of, and it requires but half glance to percieve the wide difference, in those days in this ci- ! ty, between the rich murderer and poor fool.

 The court at this time, in their wisdom, thought proper to visit upon me the extre- mest penalty they could inflict - and why Because my name became associated with that of rich, and {what shall ever believc) guilty murderer, whose gold and powerful friends bore him through and out, unwhpt of earthly justice, l was consigned to that bourne from whence no traveller returns,' who is possessed of sensitive feelings, with. out knowing in his heart that his misfortunes have drawn line of demarcation between friends are among the rich and respected, l that requires such moral courage to wipe out | or efface, as, frankly acknowledge, could | not practice, without such tender sympathy, | as, in cases like my own, is seldom felt by 1 the world, and l can add also, by mauy who 1 pretend to lift themselves above the trfieS of | time. Where is the man that hears me who l can enter right into the feelings of one whose 1 follies has so situated him that every face | that once met him with a smile, now frowns on him with contempt! Or where is the | man, to be plain, that from tho pure charity 1 of his heart. would extend to me his hand, one year ago. and say thou art my brother thou hast transgressed. but forgive you. and | with me the past is forgotten. am the man that will assist you in building up the wreck hnnaS int al.."

1t is really amusing to witness the efforts of the
Federal whig leaders to convince the people that
Mr. Clay is their most popular man, and that no
one else stands chance to get the nomination of
their National Convention. The following arti-
Gle from that excellent Journal, the Lynchburg
Republican, will afford some idea of Mr. Claws
availability:


In 1924, Mr.. Clay was candidate for the Presi-
dency and being the hndmost of the four voted for by
the people, he excluded from the House of Repre-
sentatves upon which body the election devolved II


In 1928, he so identified with Old Johnny O., that
condemnation of the necessarily condemna-
ton of the other The people spoke out in voice of


thunder against Old and his Secretary of State giving
majority in opposition to them of from to two hun
dred thousand ... ... ... ...-L


In 1882, Mr. Clay brought out by National Con-
Venton as the antJackson candidate and received 40
electoral votes 26l In the popular vote the


orlty against him must have coed five hundred thou
sand Even the opponents of Jackson in yvania,
New York and Vermont, refused to vote for hut r. 3.


In 1886, owing to his acknowledged unpopularty, his
friends declined placing him in nomination for the Pres
idency -.f -..-. ....-.


In 1889, he was candidate for the nomination of his
party, and badly beaten by General Harrison. Some
OF the delegates to convention instructed to vote
Internationally against him


Early in the year 1841, Mr. Clay was put forward as
the candidate the Wings for 1874 and they have
ly gained victory since Ohio, which gave Wing
candidate upwards of twenty majority in 194O
goes Tor the Democracy when MIR Clay is the WhIg
candidate In Kentucky, the "" Banner State of Wing
gerry IN the days of HARRISON there has been drawn
battle between the Democrats under Old Tecumseh, and
the Wings under their boasted commander Old Harry -


What do you say to all this gentleman? Do
you still insist, with all these facts from the record
staring you in the face, that Mr.. Clay is THE MAN ?
DO you lay to your souls the "" 1attering junction.""
that Mr. Webster is with you2 That he will
suffer Mr.. Clay to get either in the National Con-
vention or from the people themselves the votes of
New York, New Hampshire and Massachusetts
Do you sincerely believe that your champion
will not fall behind Gen Harrison by three or
four hundred thousand votes2 What do you in
tend to do with Gen Scou7 Where is he to 90 ?
Think you that he will consent to play second
fiddle to your champion? And John Nc Lean-is
he man not to be treated with indifference or neg
lcct? Throughout the West and North his popu-
larty with the members of the Whig party is deep
and enduring. His late letter upon the subject of
the Presidency is, by means, all that you could
wish. In that letter he says: "" No man who is
named for the Chief Mogistracy from rcspect,-
bic source should feel himself at liberty to say.
that he would decline a nomination for that OF:
fee"" Docs this satisfy you? He has been
'namcd for the Chief Magistracy"" and that too
from 'a respectable source"" and he says, boldly
and openly, that if nominated, he acould not de-
cline. .--......


This letter, we make no doubt, has been dYawn
ont Of Judge Mclean by the impoTtunitics of the
devoted admirers of Henry Clay. He has no
doubt been compelled, in justice to himself and to
his friends, 10 define his position with boldncss
ana exaetn""ss; and having done so, he will be
the last man to waver. He says he is no party
man that he would not receive the Presidency as
the instrument of party This is most severe
rebuke to Mr.. Clay-it cuts the skin. For what |
is Henry Clay but partizln? Ever since 1923
he has been pandering to party tastes, and ce !
nenting party aSsociations-indeed from the very
hour he left the Republican ranks, he seems to
have lived, not for his country, but for his party
And his country will never honor him with the
highest office in its gift. He has run, and will
run the career Of all those whose ambition over
caps itself; and, unless he speedily changes his
course, and disowns his low party attachments, he
will be regarded by posterity in no other light
han that of a bold and overbearing demagogue."

The Indians on the frontier have proved some
what troublesome, considerable dcpredations hav-
ing been committed by the Lpans and Tonkewas


Intelligence is also brought BY this arrival Of
another Santa Fe expedition. 1t Is announced
in an extra Cirilian of the 9th nst which states
that early this spring Col. Snivley received com
mission to raise a body Of three hundred volun-
teers in the frontier counties of the Northeast, for
descent upon Santa Fe, and the capture Of the
tyrant Arnijo and traitor Lewis, and TO infict
suitable punishment for the barbarous treatment
visited upon the trading expedition under Mcleod
and Coax. The great difficulty was not to raise
the requisite number of men but to keep too many
from Joining. The various counties readily turned
out from twenty-five to forty men each. Five
hundred, says the Extra, are certainly known to
be in The field and it is thought the force is nearer
eight. The place of general rendezvous was Coi-
fees Station--the time, the 18th of April. The
route was on the south side of Red River, and
military operations were to be exclusively confined
to the territory of Texas and Mexico. From the
information from Santa Fe, strong hopes were
entertained Of the capture both Of Armijo and
Lewis The volunteers were all fitted out at their
own expense, well mounted well armed, &c.


The Cirilian concludes its notice as follows


They are believed to have information of all
the Mexican parties which were to have left either
Santa Fe or st. Louis, and will probably inter-
cept them on the road. Their object does not,
however, end here. The city of Santa Fe will
be entered and, if it is deemed prudent, and the
people Of the country are able to distinguish their
friends and benciactors from the tyrants and
bIood-suckers who now oppress them, descent
will be made upon chihuahua and the whole of
Northern Mexico may be rcvolutionized On
this however, the men are determined: That
they will not return without Armijo and Lewis,
dead or alive."

The advantages of Paper Money.
mo 5.)",,"(No. s.


The advantaoes of hard money currency and
of paper currency can no where be better Illus


rated and compared than by looking at the con-
5aion of France and England They are both
I'D countries, with dense population in each, and


,re Governed by political institutions rs nearly
similar as perhaps any two nations which we can
fod In France we find the condition of the great
mass of the people, according to the accounts of
al travellers who have seen both the French and
the English infinitely more comfortable than that
If the British people In England with the most
hard-working people on earth, and perhaps as
bardIiving and frugal as any, we see small pro-
portion of her people wallowing in splendid luxu-
~ and possessing immense wealth, whilst the re-
mainder. constituting probably ninety-nine hund-
rphs are steeped in the ostdegraded and wretched
noverty and ignorance Thousands of the Brit
ish people every year die of actual Starvation
L is enough to make the blood run cold to read
the official and we'll authenticated reports, which
are annually made to the British Parliament, Of
the condition of the laboring classes If any Of
our Southern slaves were found in such state ol
extreme labor, starvation, and most barbarous cor
pora punishment, as is to be met with every
where in Great Britain, the owner would soon be
brought under the operation of Lynch law 1t
would be an easy matter in England 10 find one
man who is rich enough 10 buy every atom of
property owned by his fellow citizens: Let us look
at our country and see if we are not fast approach
mga similar state ofthings. Before the era of Bank
ing and paper money! the American who was
worth hundred thousand dollars was considered
immensely rich-a perfect Nabob. Now, we
have great many who can count their millions.
The art Of making one hundred per cent. per an
mum on money was unknown TO our simple and
honest ancestors But since the Introduction OF
Banking cunning ones amongst us perform the
feat quite handily l can we'll remember when it
was considered great disgrace for man to break
in this country. The fact of mans failing was
looked upon as prinpa tacie evidence of his hav-
ing been foolishly extravagan or shamcfully lazy.
Nowadays it is no more disgrace to be a bank
rupt than it is to have a fit of the cholic. The
reason of this change of public opinion is evident,
Wcsee honest, industrious, and frugal men fail
every day. through the ruinous changes in the va
lue of property produced by the doings Of the
Banks


But let US return to the comparison between
France and England. Every person at all acqualnt-
ed with the French people knows that in persever-
ing industry and economy they are far inferior tothe
British. The Frenchman, if it costs him his last
SOUS, will have frequent holiday-will drink his
wine, and have his fiddle and his dance, with an
occasional visit 10 the theatre. Yet with all these
leaks in his purse, the condition of the French la
boring man is greatly more comfortable than that
of the English. Another of the alleged advan-
ages of Banks is the stimulus which they give to
industry This too, is readily admitted. But there
unfortunately other things which they stimu-
late as much as they do industry. Among these
are shockingly long and black list of evils which
almost invariably attend the acquisition of sudden
wealth. They stimulate dishonesty. Witness
the hundreds of Bank officers who have become
defaulters, as our relaxed morals allow them to be
called; or, in plain English, haze stolen money.
Witness the thousands of counterfeit bank notes
which are daily imposed on the ignorant and poor
In fact, witnesses to prove that they do stimulate

Chez Okce Affairs--The Treasury of the United
states-.The interest of the people of Arkansas.


We commence this week the publication of the Re.
port of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in relation
to the Cherokees We call the attention of our readers
as well as Of news paper editors to this SUBJ
Ject 1t is one Of importance the Cheroke no
small moment to the neighbouring at
this particular time should call the serious conside
ration OF the politician, who desires Justice as well
as protect the Treasury of the United States


30 far as the United States concerned the uues


on may be stated thus By the of appropriation
under the treaty of 1s35the Cherokecs individually
or collectively have become creditors the
OF The United States to the amount of six Million six
hundred aad forty thousand and sixty seven dol
lars 4H Prs -.


The true enquiry then is to what amount can the Go
vernment of the United States lawfully claim credit.
or how much do they yet the Cherokees Varou.
able writers have, from time time argued through
the columns of pepper, and elsewhere that there is
yet due the Cherokees subject to per capita division
little less than two million five hundred thousan nd dol.
lars On the other hand. the Committee Indian AT.
fat ,ln nvl, L,.-l


four hundred and ninety dollars and nine cents
| in tho Treasury TO meet this sum-


But TO obtain these credits it will be seen that Mr.
Ross has been paid 1887 745 sc on his removal con-
tract In fact the Government claims credit for about
two million Of dollars for removal when had the Ross
party been removed the same economical scale on
which the Ridge party, and Judge Martin and Lynch
and Others amounting to several thousand
ed the whole business Of emigration could only have
cost about three hundred and thirty thousand dollars
The same objection to more limited extent exists to
the credit for subsistence, which double what was
authorized is centended by the anti Ross party that
the United States had right to take the money OF
the individual Cherokccs appropriated to special OBJ
Jects to pay the enormous charges of Ross for
and Glasgow g. Harrison for subsistence. That both
we're frauds upon the people of the Nation and that the
United States bound to refund the money thus n
properly paid Such also to be the opinion of the
Committee on Indian Affairs and such in fact must be
the opinion of every intelligent man who reads the
treaty. This concession being made, the mind of the
politician nationally asks whom rests the sin of this
monsrous abuse by which the United States are to lose
two million and half Of dollars and John Ross Gas
gov Harrison, and few others to gain il? There
must be fearful accountability somewhere


The report, it will be very justly saddles s5sI
S4S 80 on the shoulders Of John Bell Secretary of War;
There is escape from this; because the documents
show that tho account paid contrary to all proce
dent after the same had been denied by previous ad
minstration As MIR. Bell is candidate for political
honors just now it would be well that the Tennessee
editors should look to this grave charge.


So much for Mr.. TyIers administration. The next
great bunder seems to fall upon Gen. Scott who made
SO runous arrangement, nctoned was by the
Van Buren administration. Well might that admins.
traton refuse TO pay Ross the above mentioned,
when they had already suffered him to pocket half
million of money contrary to solemn treaty spula-
tions. ls.


1t may be asked why have these abuses been pub
iicy exposed before To this question there very
satisfactory reasons. In the first place the United

| Yes, and such has it ever been. This self
styled party of Progress and Liberty, where are
the records of its selfforgettng devotion to Free
dom? Where has it ever taken the lead IN rals
ing up any class humber than itself-such as the
Blacks, for instance-to an equality of Political
Rights or Social position Has it not ever
planted itself determinedly in the path of every
such movement Has it not generally furnished
the instruments of Lynch-law outrage and every
assault on the rights of the unpopular and the
depressed Now there is among US a general
want of true hberality of sentiment deplorabe
lack of tolerance for novel or unpopular opinions
but we have pride in believing that there is less
of this on the side of the Wings than on that of
their opponents. Wegratefully acknowledge that
we have ever been INDUCED In expressing conylc-
tons very far removed from those Of our readers
SO far that as we are assured by this case OF
Mr.. Brownson, they would not have been toler-
ated by those Of the opposite party-not even by
that naturally more intelligent and rghtfully more
liberal portion of them who are patrons Of the
higher periodicals.


| That MIR. Brownson has been constrained to
withdraw from the Review we regret for the sake Of
OF that work and Editor, in whose welfare we feel
an interest. From the establishment of the De-
mocrahc' we have endeavorcd to commend it to
public favor. We have disregarded its Politics
bitter and perverse as they were and are, and dis
graced by fragrant suppressions as some of the
Biographical Sketches of its party chiefs have
been-in our appreciation Of its Literary character,
sustained as this has been by the contributions OF
Whittier, Hawthorne, lowell, Miss Sedgwick
Tuckerman, the Editor, (last, not least,) 0. A.
Brownson, &c. &C. And now, if it were in truth
'the Democratic Review, and as such would
grappe with all the great Political and Social
questions Of the day-thc proper basis and safe
guards of true Suffrage, Slavery, the relations
of Labor to Capital, and the hke-disregardlng
entirely mere party interests and party aims-we
should still rank it first among our American pc
riodlcals. The course matters have taken with
regard to MIR. Brownson, however, have con-
vnccd us that no work can be what a true De |
mocratic Review must be without an entire di-
vorce' from party, and we rejoice to hear that Mr.
B. will soon start a review of his own. Wrong
headed as he is on every question OF practical pol
itics, ne does speak his whole mind, his boldest
thought, on any subject important tohuman we'll
beng, and this is the teaching the world needs,
whether it will hear or forbear We look with
interest for the appearance of Brownson's Re-
view, and trust it will be sustained by generous
hearts Of all creeds and parties.

severity Of the offended laps,) was hurried from
the county Jail of this county, and burnt at the
stake--and not even bill ofindictment was found
by our grand jury against the we'll known parti-
cipants in the actl Recently, respited criminal
was taken from the Jail of neighboring county,
and executed by the poPuace--and we have heard
of legal proceedings against the leaders of the
mob. In the counties bordering on the western
frontier, the Lynchng process, for years has COM
peted with the civil, almost to the exclusion of the
iatter-a fact notorious in those regions, and which
the writer IS prepared to prove. Last winter, a
stranger was shot in Buc haman county, in endea-
voring to escape from hogging, the penalty of a
suspicion Of being connected with counterfeiters
and no investigation made of the matter. In In
dependence, recently, it was declared by two of
the most influential citizens of that place, that had
they been present when certain of the participants


in the Chavis affair were arrested, those persons
should have been Immediately executed--the wri-
ter has reason to believe it was no empty declara-
ton. AS it was, they were maltreated by the mob
linen too, who have since been proven to have
had little TO do with thar ransacton-while others
were coerced to make statements, under pain of
death, which ultimately may convict the innocent.
These are facts which can be sustained by ire.
tragible teslimony-and it is but iustice when we
are considering the causes which lead to the as
peTSioh VI s'ouSatidutlC writers. mat We should
consider them. and utter against them our con.
demnation. TO pass them silently over, were to
admit tho validity Of what is not true-that thew
are the offspring of form of government which i:


is the interest the anti-repubcan to vify.


Though Lynch Law is so common in this
country, it is by no means peculiar to ia fact
which our calumniators seem entirely to overlook.


n fact the re is reason to believe that the very
term is of European origin. In late work Oh
Ireland (Thuckarys 8 Irish SKetvh Booh,} wa q 70
informed, in substance, that ""there is in Dead
mans Lane, Galway, 'raw head and bones
over door, commemorative Of the following ira
gic affair. In 1903, the Mayor of Galway, James
Fitzstephon Lynch, came to the knowledge of Il
murder committed by his son, some years before
at sea. Hereon, the Gu prit, was arraigncd before
his own father, and sentenced to death.-The clan
Lynch, however, rose in body to rescue the
young n,an, and avert such a disgrace from their
family, but the father, another Lucius Junius Bru.
tus. frustrated their designs by hanging his son
with his own hands!'' If this case did not give
origin to the phrase; it certainly deserved the ap-
|plication.


Alison himself admits and laments tho frequent
occurrence Of popular outbreaks in Europe--lhat
even the hero of Waterloo himself was ""reviled
by ma jorty Of his countrymen, execrated by
the Mob, narrowly escaping death from their
hands,"" Yet .he existence of msrue in Europe
cannot apologize for its existence here. Recrimi-
nation can effect but little of good in any case,
as ""two wrongs can never make right Let
then, being satisfied of the necessity of the su-
premacy of law, to our ultimate we-beng as
nation, use every eXertion to maintain that su.
premacy, and abide the issue. J."

that we have no longer in the next Congress the
services of those able and accomplished represen-
tatives, Goode, and Smith, and Hunter. 1t is also
true, that have lost from the House of Dele
gates few members, whose defeat is a source OF
deep regret to the Republican party. But, under
all the circumstances of the case, we have gained
proud and an illustrious victory.


We have carried the State, as the Lynchburg
Republican estimates it, by popular Anti clay
majority of4, ,319 in the Congressional Districts
more than three times the majority which we
obtained over Harrison in 184O-And this in spite
of all the difficulties we had to cope within spite
of the spasmodic efforts ofthe Wings, and in many
sections, of the comparative apathy of our friends.


We had to contend with a host of difficulties in
the battle feld-against Tax bill-against all
its misrepresentation by the Whigs-without the
necessary time to explain the law and expose their
humbugs- the complaints of a suffering
community for failure to pass a relief lava
gainst the complaints of long session--against
the complaints about non-reception of the Distrib
utable Fund-amid the backwardnes of the sea-
son, which induced the people to remain at home
and plant their corn-and against the spasmodic
efforts of desperate and determined minority
Yet amid all these difficulties, and especially the
excited murmurs against new tax bill, we have
met the enemy, and have gloriously defeated them.
In this sentiment we are not singular We have
before us the congratulations of the Republicans,
in various parts of the Union-and beg leave to
submit few specimens of the exulting tone ofthe
