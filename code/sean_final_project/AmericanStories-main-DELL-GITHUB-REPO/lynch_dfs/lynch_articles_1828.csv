 Dear Sr-Agreeably to your request, I now give you my opinion of Buffers Vegetable Indian Specitc and in doing so, must premsc that Iby no means think that 1t will make Indlscrminate cure of eve ry person, let their disease and constitution be what they may but they may rest assured tiatthey will not be injured by the use oft. do not like to speak of this medicine in the exalted terms in which est- mate it, because fearful that if it should be made public, it will be the perhaps of inducing some sangune disposition to make partial trial of it, and should the Specific not act like an immediate charm, they will be sadly disappointed. know too wei how to sympathise with others in my situation, not to be cautious in raising expectations. 1 will therefore, as briefly as possible, give history ofmy own situation; with the effects produced by this valuable medicine.

 have been for the last eight years labOriBg under pulmonary consumption, (prOnounced to be such by Professor Chapman, of Philadelphia, as well others,) during which time have consulted many physicians, taken much medicine, travelled great deal but all to but little purpose. The l2th of Jan 1895 puked blood for the first time, and continued for several days to spit blood, mixed with purulent matter, occasoned by the breaking of on abscess, which was supposed to have formed on my lungs, and on the 21st of the same month confined 10 my bed, where lay for four months, taking emetlc every other day for three months of that time. until reduced to such state of debility that my friends began to despair of my recovery. have no doubt but that the emetics were of infinite service, and swered all the purposes for which they were given for perhaps l cOnld not have otherwise discharged the vast collection of matter accommodating from the rapid secreons and which had become unable to cough up My cough for several years had been extremely distressing and appeared 10 increase. commenced using Butler's Veghtabe Indian Specific, when at my very lowest state, and when thought it unimporant what medicine took, or whether any. took the first tea-spoonful at night, in little balm tea sweet ened, which soon threw me into gentle precipitation, and procured for me happy and sweet nights sleep. repeated the dose in the morning, which had the effect to make sleep very sound till near 10 o'clock, when awoke considerably refreshed from the rest had taken, and of which stood so much in need. I continued take the medicine and in about three or four days my cough was completely stopped, that became somewhat uneasy, for fear that should have to emecs again. for the purpose of throwing off the great quantity of matter and phiegm, which of course imagined to be collecting, for the secreons regularly going and none discharged by the usua method of coughing up. began to think the Spe- cic would be ultimately hurtful, but found in few days more that the Specific, to my surprise had the effect to stop the secretons almost entirely. have been mending since took the first dose, and am now able 10 ride in carriage or horseback, for short distance at time. My cough IS greatly mend- ed and is at this time by means distressing. have used five bottles, and have bought five more, which shall continue to use, and perhaps as many more should they continue to have the same good eect or be superseded by restoration to health. In order to better satisfy myself of the efficiency ofthis med- cine, left off the use of it for six or eight days. Alter three four days the secretons became copious and as rapid as ever more especially the phlegm in the windpipe, and being little asthmatic, my breath ing became very difficult, with wheezing. took puke, and threw up great deal of Phlegm, but the day ater the secreons were so rapid, that the same difficulty of breathing occurred. then commenced happy effects am now perfectly satisfied of the su- perior quality of the Vegetable Indian Specific, over every other medicine discovered in this Country, the cure of the diseases for which is recommen- ueU Dy ne pTOprieIOf, DuleTs ours respectfully,
