 Anothcr Fdta1 AfrGy.--We find in the New Orleans Picayune of the 7th instant, the fol- lowing particulars of fatal rencontre, near Woodvile, Miss. fs.t.EL ~

 A serious affray occurred near Woodville, Miss. on Sunday morning, the 26th June.- As we have learned the particulars from n gentleman who was at Woodville at the time, it seems that a Col. D. Woodward, with his brother and a man named Glass, way laid carriage containing Col. W.'s wife, and two other ladies, with MT. Frazier. step son of WIS by his wife, and two or three small children. The first named par ty ordered the other to stop, and Col. W. immediately fired a pistol directly at the persons in the carriage, wounding one of the ladies in the cheek. Young Frazier then jumped from the carriage and fired pistol at Col. Woodward, wounding him badly in the face. With another pistol he lodged ball in his body, which killed him instantly. The brother of tho latter immediately shot ! Frazier in the back as he was running to tho carriage. Glass, in the mean time, had fled. A brother of Frazier, who was on horseback behind the carriage, now came up, when ] Woodward fired a gun at him, shatterlng bis arm badly with buckshot. At the last accounts the Frazier who was first wounded was not expected 10 live.

 One of the ladies in tho carriage showed great presence of mind, by ordering her chil- dreA to Lie down. She then picked up pis- 1 tol which had been dropped, and threatened 1 to shoot one Of Col. WIS negroes, who had seized the horses, induced him to let go, and ] then drove off. .... l It seems that there had been difference of long standing between CA Woodward and his wife, in which her children by a for mcr husband, the two FraZiers, had taken part. reward of $500 has been offered 1 for the apprehension of Woodward's brother. who is now at large. Glass has been apprc- hended and is in jail.

 Murder-John B. Slaughter murdered Jo- seph w. Pledge, in Blandford, on Thursday last, under the following circumstances 1t appears that few days ago, Slaughter, who had been a troublesome character in our town for many years, received an anony. nous letter, warning him to leave town in twenty days, under the penalty of being lynchcd. Pledge, understanding that he was accused by Slaughter of having written this letter. called on Thursday, at his door in BaM}ford, and demanded of Slaughter his reasons for charging him with the authorA ship of the ssttcr Slaughter repeated tho charge, and added some words of abuSe.-

 

 the continued abuse of Slaughter, and alight- ing from his horse, threw a brick at SlaHgh- l ter, which did not strike him-whereupon Slaughter advanced on Pledge, with pistos in each hand, Pledge at the same time req. l treating, and when within a few paccs of him fired and gave Pledge wound of which he died in the course of an hour Slaughter was arrested tn a few minutes after he had committed the deed, and is now in iail

Yes, sir, say there is no contest here, and never
can be one the has been finally and concluswey
settled IN the State Of New Jersey. This is a question
TO which the principle Of jadleafa strictly applies
and there is appeal from simply because there
no law on earth applicable the subject, either Stale
or Federal


Sir The people Of New Jersey have never contem-
plated such thing as contested Congressional cleo
on and have therefore not provided for IL and oil
natural enough Too Ia that State they vote BY gene
raj ticket and by ballot, and the idea OF canvsssing
whole entire State, and taking testimony IN every part
Of IT. in disputed election, never entered their minds
being reasonable probable; moreover they have
recognised the right OF one OF their csizsns 70 as
pne the seal Of their Sstc but have agreed among
themselves, through their representatives 10 ine na''s
their Legislature, that the determination OF the 10
vernon and Council shall be decisive oil the question


Now. suppose you refer this question - the Commit

II contest in Virginia. you are necessarily go-
verned by the laws Of Virginia and the parties are re-
qured TO give notice and to take testimony at the time
and in the prescribed By the laws OF thai State.
II contest should arise in North Carolina you mnst be
governed by the laws Of North Carolina; Of Ken
tocky, Massachusetts, and all And If contest arises
in New jersey will you subject the parties to the laws
Of Virginia, North Carolina Kentucky, Massachusetts,,
New York, Pennsylvan of which they are entirely
ignorant, and not bound to inform themselves =
Certainly ynu would not attempt il but you would
subject them to the laws Of New Jersey. But hap
pens in this case that there is no law IN New Jersey
upon the subject Of contested elections, at least was
ha onf HE aln cglap hpTa
six months AFTER and that surely cannot apply 70 this
case being, in the first place, post facfo law;
and, in the second place. the first provision Of that law
requires notice Of intention to contest TO be given
within thirty days after the election which could not be
done in this the election took place in the fall Of
the year, and the law did pass until the following
March therefore. that law does apply


Well there beng no State law, what then, viii you
dol Why, you will naturally look for the general law;
but you again stopped for there is no general law
IN existence and has not been since 1904 What next
VIII you refer me to the practice and usage OF this
House Why, ! will show that the practice OF this
body has been the colors OF the rainbow
and the usage depended at all times the political
character Of the House for these questions have al
ways been decided on party grounds And you had as
well refer me TO the practices Of Mississippi where they
Lynch people and hang them without trial, as to talk
about the practices of thus House one, think, about
as worthy Of imitation the other.


Since this view Of the subject presented itself to my
mind, which was at the moment ascertaDed that the
laws Of Now Jersey silent the aubject and that
there general law hunted for authorities and
found one very much 10 the purpose.


In the year 1882 there was contest from this ssmo
State Of New Jersey, under circumstances very smi-
lar to the present. and the question OF jurisdiction then
arose. and it will be perceived ii then decided, as
far infer from the report Of the case, TO 30
beyond the jurisdiction Of the House. obviously because
there NJ law TO govern IT, read from the volume
Of Contested Elections, page 3S

Various propositions were made by the committee

OF taking testimony IN the when the question OF
Jurisdiction arose, which debated by the mos, prom
inent men in the House, Mr. Ames, MIR. Lee, Mr. Mad
ison. Mr.. Page Mr. LivcImore and others and 1t is
much to he regretted that the papers generally relating
TO this important question were destroyed with the
Capitol in 1914 But, after the question Of jurisdiction
discussed, arrived at this result tina, the COM
miitee ultimately reported the simple facts Of the case,
without gong behind the Governors commissions to
take testimony, after the House had been regu-
sy organized by the aid Of the regularly returned
bes, whose right to take their in the first instance
was questioned. They accordingly report as
follows


""Ist. That the polls closed in the counties Of
Bergen, Morris, Monmouth Hunterdon Somerset, MID
dlesex Sussex, Salem Cspo May, Cumberland, Bur-
lngton and Gloucester and the lists Of the several
persons voted for and the number OF votes taken lor
each, received by the Governor the respective
times, appearing from the said lists and The endorsements
thereon, which lists were before the committee.


I'd. That the election IN the county OF Essex, the
remaining county of the State closed on the 9th OF
April, and the list received by the Governor on tho
Sd of May


Sd That jn consequence Of a summons from the
Governor dated the 9th OF February, to four OF tho
members Of the Council, Prlyy Council, consisting
of he and ihp fuirr etnhp
did assemble at Elizabclhown the 81 OF March, and
being so assembled Mr. Harng another member Of the
Council, received note from the Governor IN conse-
quence whereof, he also did attend the Council as
member thereof


""4h That the Governor then appointed another
meeting Of the Council to be held on the 18th OF March,
which day the Govern.r and eleven members Of
the Council did attend and then determine, from the
lists Of the twelve counties above specified Essex ex
cluded) that the four members holding seats in
this House the four persons elected members Of
this House from that State against which determina-

did protest. and copy Of the proles, subsc-

and Privy Council in the premises until the 18th
Of March, and that the 9th he did issue his procla

Resoired, That it appears to this House, upon full
and mature consideration, that James Schureman, Lam
bert Cadwalsder, Elias Boudinot, and Thomas Sim
ckson duly elected and returned in this
House Representatives for the State Of New Jersey
IN the present Congress Of the United States""


Thus It appears that in 1889 similar in every
respect this from the State did occur, and, for
the waLt OF jurisdiction, Congress confined themselves
strictly to the commission OF the Governor Of the State
as final aud conclusive Lot 1t be remembered too,
that this after the House had organized, aud the
