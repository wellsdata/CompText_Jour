your prices, too?


Editor--I willtry and keep alon


with no profit, or even at a loss, hopin
for better times. ] am struggling har
to build MY paper up.


Mr.. Brown stopped the pape
. once, but it was not so much for tn
price; / went in for paying for my farm
by extra economy.


Editor--Yes, he followed the Edi
: tors advice for 'peoplc to economics


and pay their debts now"" But let u


see if Mr.. Brown began at the righ


place. In one issue it was published
that wheat had advanced l3 cents {
; bushel. On Monday Mr.. Brown wen
T to market with his wheat, and sold 6(


bushels at one cent advance over the
old price, and thought he did well. llC


came home boasting about it, until he


met neighbor johnson, who got the


Is cents advance, because he read my


paper, and was widc-awakc. Mr. Browns


loss on GO bushels would pay four


whole years subscription.


Mr.. Brown--Don't say anything
more about that Mr. Editor, and put
me down subscriber for life.


Editor-I have heard Of several
other such losses by those who stopped
their paper. Not to be too personal, as
some Of them are here, | viii call them
A, b, G, etc. Mr. A. paid 4 per cent
more fees on S7l taxes, because he did
not see the collectors notice in his
paper, and thus lost 81 81, TO save 81 so.
Mr.. b. paid $3.50 the same way. Mr..
G. failed to bring in his claim against
an estate, because he did not see in
my paper the legal notice limiting the
time. That cost him S3i, TO save 81 80
subscription Mr. ID. sold 200 pounds
Of wool at 62 cents. because he did not
see an advertisement Of Mr.. Smith
right here at home He paid more for
lumber in Baltimore than be could have
procured the same for in Westminster,
because he did not know that Edward
Lynch, at his new yard, or Dell 4 Bill
lingslea would have sold the same ma
terih for less money He could have
got 40 cents for his wool That cost
him SIG. to save 81 30. Mr. F.'s boys
went down TO the village every night or
two to get the news aud local gossip,
because they had no paper at home, aud
one Of them icil into bad company, nnd
Is ruined | know twenty cases where
people lost money for not learning What
Is going on. ! gather up all that is
going on in business aud society, and
coudeEse it into my columns II Is
important for every mau to know all
! about home matters, aud | doubt If
there is a man in this whole town who
would not, IN the course of year. get
some information TINT would pay him
back more than 1850 year Aud th,n
think Of household sitting down to.
rether 3Gj days in a year, aud having
nothing to talk about, except thcir own
affairs and few items Of gossip, gath.
cred up by occasional contact with other
people.


Mr. Taylor-Let me help the Edi.
tors argument Wife read to me au
item he published about humbuc.
which he copied from the American
hgriculturst, Of New York city Next
day one Of those same humbugs came
round with his article and was so plaus
iblc that he almost persuaded her iuto
paying him SO for his swindlng recipe,
but the Editors caution kept her back.


Editor--Ics, and do you know that
the fellow sold more than fifty of the
humbug recipes hereabout at S3apicco,
but not to any Que Of my subscribers


Mr.. Potts-Put me down rs a sub.
scriber to the Advocate; here is your
money


Mr.. Shaw-And me too.


Editor-Thank you, gentlemen. mi
try to make a better paper than ever
Every dollar helps; a new subscriber
only adds TO my expense the cost Of
paper. If everybody took the paper,
and thus divided the cost of getting
news setting type, Office rent, &c,
could double the value of the papor to
each Please talk the matter over with
other neighbors aud see if it cannot be
done.


Several Yoices-We will


Mr. Smith--And now while you are
about it, want to make up a club for
a good New York paper.


Mr. Brown--We cant afford to take
so many papers.


Mr. Smith-You have just seen that
you could not afford to stop your home
paper; let US see if it will not pay to
JOIN our club Mr. Rich, you have
taken the American Agrieulturist for
several years. Does il pay?


Mr.. Rieh-Pay? Yes, fifty times
over. Why, ! got two ten,acre fields
ready to SOW to wheat, and put in one
of them. That night my Agriculturist
came, and ! read simple recommend
alton about preparing seed wheat. |
called John and we put 10 bushels in
soak for the next day 1t cost 80 cents
for the materials Well that second
field yielded bushels an acre more
than the other; or so bushels extra,
and better wheat too. Pretty good pay
for $3.50 expended for paper. Aud
| have got lots of other hints almost as
profitable. You know ! get better
profits on my beef, pork and mutton
than any other man in the place. Now
this does rot come from any direct hint,
like the wheat, but from a good many
suggestions that have picked up in
reading the Agriculturist, and from the
course Of reasoning that / have been"

fact IL Is certain that her Macsty's government were

given up TO the Canadian authorities. This opinion
fully endorsed by the Kanucks bat others hold that
such would be contrary to all International law

"
5_1866-09-22_p2_sn82015099_00279556677_1866092201_0368,The Shasta courier.,01,1866-09-22,p2,"The Malignity of Traitors and Their Ul-


innate Fate.",,"The peculiar policy pursued by Andrew
johnson is raridly producing its legitimate
results, and these results bear a striking
similarity to those produced by the favorlte
doctrine of Jefferson Davis, Toombs, Yancy,
Wigfall and Rhett. Under the spell of this
evil Presidential magician, the fallen spirit
of secession is reviving-its dumb oracles are
beginning to speak in the familiar language
of yore-and the PROSTATE idol of Slavery is
being lifted up and re-enthroned by the
hands of the old worshippers at the shrine OF
the ebon god. Indeed, the traitorous len
nesseean, who seems ambitious of emulating
the original knights of the Golden Circle
has succeeded in tanning the flames OF South,
ern passion and barbaric hate to such heights
as would have delighted the treason plotting
souls of the founders of the "" Confederate
Government"" in the days when they were
preparing to lay the chief corner stone OF
that ephemeral structure which rested on the
unstable foundation of human bondage.


Again the South is closing her doors
against free speech and liberty of the press
and essaying to arrest the tide of freedom and
progress The old system of violence is re
vived, and the ancient code of lynch and mob
law is reinstated with more than primal au-
thority. Citizens who honestly believe that
free labor system would best promote the inter-
ests of their State, meet in convention for the
purpose of giving public expression to their
opinions, and are dispersed and murdered by
a mob led by rebel municipal authorities, and
journals that dare publish accounts of the
affair are compelled to suspend publication,
and their conductors save their lives only by
flying to a United States garrison for protec,
ton. Distinguished men, whose only crime
consists in having remained loyal to the Ma
tional Government and flag throughout the
long night of rebellion, are ostracised, and
forbidden to speak of the wants and necessi
ties of their native States on pain of DEATH
Others are hunted down and shot like wild
animals, or hung upon trees like criminals
and their bodies left as prey for carrion birds.
Peaceable men who love the old Union sane
tilted by the prayers and blessings of Wash
ington and his compatriots, lie down to rest
with their families at night, and the morning
dawns upon their lifeless remains, and smok-
ing embers only denote the SPOT where their
habitations stood. Law is openly defed,
justice is stifed. loyalty is a crime, and
violence and death are holding high carnival,
while exultant treason tramples upon the
most sacred rights guaranteed to American
citizens.


For this state of affairs in the South, An
drew johnson, more than any other living
man, is responsible but neither he nor all
his wicked coadjutors can reverse or break
down the deliberate opinions and convictions
of the great mass of the people in regard to
the momentous issues between Freedom and
Slavery-Union and Disunion. Under the
smiles of Executive favor the malignant Co.
horts of treason may again rally and briefly
hold sway in those States cursed by
their majorities, but the advancing tide of
loyalty and civilization will ultimately sweep
them from the land they disgrace and have
sought to destroy. A few more Union mar
tyrs may be slain on account of their faith,
but never again will these disunion conspira-
tors be permitted to gain possession of the
rens of the National Government, or restore
their olgarchal institutions in the South
Their power is forever broken in this nation,
and the time will come W hen the liberal ideas
and free institutions of the great North and
West will entirely obliterate their influence
in the Republic."

There ere three candidates for Comp

Robert Bruce of Alleghany. the radical
nominee, and Tcagle Townsend, of Som
erset, independent democrat. A careful
reyies of the political situation in the State
has satisfied us that Mr. Townsend has
not the slightest chance of being elected
\ vote, therefore, cast for him is, under
the circumstances, half vote given to the
radical candidate, Col Bruce. Moreover,
the democratic press and the democratic
party throughout the State are nearly unan-

reasons, we express the hope that Col.
Leonard may receive the undivided sup

Capital Ghost Story.",,"Capital Ghost Story.


We do not generally give much credencs
to ghost stories but the following which we
find in the Lynchburg News, appears 80 in
trinsically reasonable in view Of the awful
doom which doubtless awaits the wretch
that would swindle an editor, that wa cam
not for moment doubt its truth. The
story, says the News. is ""dedicatel in an
especial manner to all newspaper readers.
That apparitons do not always wander
without sufficient cause, is proved by the
we'll attessed fact which We give below:
Last Tuesday fortnight, as Mrs. --;;
a lady Of rather literary taste and studious
habits,) sat reading in her drawing room;
the clock on the mantle piece struck .weIver
as the last stroke reverberaed through the
apartments, the door was flung wide ,openI
in the act Of raising her head to repel the
intruder (unrung for) Of her servant, her
eye rested on the form of her late husbandt
she screamed and fell senseless on the car.
petl This brought up such members OF the
family as had not retired to rest; res,ora.
tves were administered, and when Mrs.
- had regained her suspended faculties,
and being woman of strong mind and
highly cultivated intellect, she felt dispos.
cd to consider the whole distress she had
undergone as the result OF certain associa.
tons between the melancholy tale she had
been perusng and her late loss, operating
on partially deranged nervous system.
She, however, col sidered it advisable that
her maid servant should repose in her cham-
Der, lest any return Of what she considered q
nervous affection should distress herself and
alarm the family. Last Tuesday night,
fee ling stronger and in better spirits than
she had been for several months past, Mrs.
- dispensed with the presence of her
attendant, retiring alone to her chamber,
went to bed little before ten O'Clock
Exactly as the clock struck twelve she was
awakened from sleep, and distinctly beheld
the appariLion she had before seen, advanc.
ing from the table ION which stood her
night lamp) ill it stood opposite to and
drew aside the curtains of her bed. She
describes her very blood retreatipg with
icy oLi lness to her heart from every vein.
| The countenance of her beloved in life were
not its benevolent aspect; the eyes once
beaming with affection were now fixed with
stern regard on the trembling half dissolved
being, who, with the courage of despera-
sion, thus ahjured him, ""Charles! dear
Charles! why are you come agains""


""Jesse,"" slowly and solemnly aspired the
shadowy form, waving in his hand small
roll Of writing paper, Jessie, pay my news
paper accounts and let me rest in peace!""

tablespoonsful of ground mustard seed, two
glIs Of mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of
ground cinnamon, one tablespoonful cloves,
one pound Of brown sugar, three quarts of
vinegax Boil all together until quite done.
If you choose you may use one spoonful Of
ground cinnamon, and portion of CHINA.
mon bark. Celery improves its flavor. They
are excellent.


TOMATO WlSE.-It may not be known to
all our readers that an excellent wine can
be made from tomatoes. We have drank
wine OF this kind, which good judges, unaware
of its nature. prouunce still catawba. The
following is said to DO a good recipe for
tomato wiue which is said to retain all
the we'll known properties Of the fruit:
Express the juice Of ripe tomatoes, put
one pound CT sugar to each quart OF The
juice, and bottle. In few weeks it will
have the appearance and flavor of tie best
kind. No alcohol is needed to preserve it.
Mixed with water, it is delightful beverage
for the sick."

The flag was of the richest silk, but almost
ample for battle flag. The field was green,
harp was emblazoned on the center of it, and be-
meath the harp was beautifully embossed in white
strand of shamrocks. Appropriately decorated
with tassels it could truly be described as mag
nifcent, and which reflected the highest credit for
taste and good judgment on the ladies who pre-
pared it.


We heard it rumored that Major Dunpbys bat

BOARD OF POLICE CoMMIssIoNERs.-Thi body
was in session last evening, full board present,
Mayor Monroe presiding.


The tirstmatter taken up wasthe case of Edward
Kirwin, who was sworn in as a policeman after
seeing his name published among the appointments
by the mayor, and who claimed the office, although
after his being sworn in the mayor discovered that
The person he appointed was another man of the
same name. After some discussion, it was agreed
that tile mayor had the power to put in Office the
Edward Kirwin he intended to appoint and to
gnore the other.


The mayor brought to the attention Of the
board that several appointees, on the police, re
fused to report for duty since they had discovered
that the law required them to wear uniforms, and
the members of the board expressed the opinion
that, under such circumstances, he was authorized
to strike the names of the men from the rolls and
appoint others in their places.


The mayor also consulted with regard to the
power Of the chief over corporals and sergeants.
1t sometimes occurred that a very goodpoliceman.
upon being promoted to the berth of sergeant or
corporal was found to be unfit for the higher sta
ton, and his honor thought that the efficiency of
the police required that in such cases the chief
should have the right to reduce incompetent per
sons to the ranks. After some conversation, pro
and con, the members of the board unanimously
concurred with the mayor that the chief should
exercise the authority suggested The board
then adjourned to Saturday evening.


NEW ORLEANS FEN1ANs CONG NoETH.-A

1t is not often we have as sad n story nc
that told in the Tribune this morning a A
company of American citizens, holding re.
preventative positions in Louisiana, mem
pers oil Convention elected in 1864 by The
t,I1Yal people OF that State, legally assem-.
pllhg IN pursuance Of call OF the Governor
are Desieged by mob and some of them
hassacred. A riot In New Orleans is not an
ulusual occurrence, Now it is not a riot
put the uprising of the Rebel population
against loyal citizens of the United States
engaged IN the performance of loyal duties.
n ING accounts we have are mainly from
n, nepel sources-the agent of the Associated
IIess In New Orleans having been. we nre
informed, formerly soldier in the Rebel
army ills statements show his full SYM
pathy with the rioters. We arc told lint
ele outbreak was Occasioned by an assault
VI negro upon white mana white man
having Decn pushed along the sidewalk and
!uippeu up during processionl Consider
ing now men arc frequently pushed and
lrlpped up whenever militia regiment IN.
fades on Broadway, we can Imagine the ex-
.elt VI INC pfoVocation necessary to excite
iteDel mahgnity. The action of Mayor
monroe IS more intelligible. We see him
seriously proposing to arrest the members of
IN sae Convention for daring TO come together
at the call of the Governor. Then he issues
proclamation which reads TO us like an in
centiye to riot. He begins by speaking of
tne Conyention'as the Extinction Conyen-
toh oi 1864, and specially calls upon the
young men to keep quiet and not molest said
convention, for he is satisfied by ""recent
dispatches from Washington that the dolib.
erations of the members thereof will receive
no countenance from the President. and that
nc tolss sustain tte agents IF the present ctgdl
go9ernments and vindicate its laws and acts
10 the satisfaction of the good people of the
State' In other words, every Rebel in
New orleans is told by Rebel Mayor that
the President of the United States is in svm'
pathy with him; that the members of the
Convention are outlaws and not under Ex.
ecutive protection, and that whatever the
REBELS might do to vindicate the ""Recon-
strucliOn POlicyh would meet the Presidents
appreciation. Still, do nothing scandalousl
Gen. Baird's patriotic determination was
promptly overruled by dispatch from the
President, Edwin M. Stanton being Secre.
tary of War Every Rebel saw that the
Mayor was sustained, and that the President
was the Rebels friend.


Read the dreadful story The Convention
meets, There are no soldiers IN the assem-
Dly The pollce-Rebel soldiers many of
them-are Exemplary and try to prevent
""lynching and mobbfng"" One prominent
member-a citizen of many years standing
is dragged to jail. The President and
members are gradually arrested and i'm
prlsoned. A procession of negroes approach
Some whites -. endeavor 10 ""disperse ~
them, but are ""repulsed "" Shots are fired
'Three negroes are killed on Dryade Street
and two on Common Street"" The Rebel
mob surrounds the hall where the members
are are in session. A regular siege begins
Every visible head in the building is fired
upon"" ""Dr A. p. DOstie and John Hen
dersOn, JT., are brought out of the building
dead, and carried off in carts - The first
was an eminent physician, the second n we'll
known lawyer of New Orleans conspicuous
for their loyalty during the dark days of
rebellion. They are carried OIL in carts,
and it is doubtful IL 'many have gotten out
OF the hall alive"" All this time Andrew
Johnson President and Edwin M. Stanton
Secretary of War


We are telling this story as it is told by
Rebels We can make but one comment
For all the blood shed in New Orleans we
hold the Executive power responsible. The
President knew the temper of these men,
lie had but to recall very few years OF. his
own history to find himself flying before a
mob like that which murdered A. p. Dostie
and his loyal associates. These rioters were
precisely the manner of men that President
johnson claimed to be. They were loyal
like him. They opposed Secession as he
opposed il. They dared social ostracism
and Rebel vengeance, and from the safe dis
tance of Washington nor as the armed
commanders of armies-but MS plain citi-
zens devoted TO the flag. 1t was to reward
such men as the murdered DOstie that we
took the outlawed loyalist, Andrew John
son, from the dust, and stamped him with a
diadem. And in return we have our brothers
and lriends-more than brothers, indeed,
by reason of their devotion during the war
butcheled by Rebel mob, in broad noon,
with Rebel Mayor inspiring the massacre,
Rebel soldiers acting as ''police, "" and Union
soldiers, under Union officers, compelled u
stand silent, by order of Andrew johnson.
The hands of the Rebels are again red with
loyal blood; Rebel armies have once more
begun the work of massacre and the Presi.
dent of our choice, who has sworn to defend
the laws, and protect the people of the
United States, is silent. Is it too much tc
say that this silence is orime?-M T.

D. Thurston, EGG, Ushsd states Consul at Toronfo:
Sir: For your information, I enclose copy Of
aote Of this date, which I have addressed to Sir
Frederick W. A. Bruce, the British Minister here,
upon tho subject Of the conviction and sentence Of
james Lynch and John McMahon by a colonial
court Of Canada, on tho charge Of completely and
participation in the late attack on Fort Erie. In
accordance with purpose expressed in that com
munication, you are expected to procure, without
delay, for the use Of this Department, . copy Of
the record of the trial and conviction Of Lynch and
Mcmahon, and also of all further trials and con-
victions Of q similar character which will take
place in Canada, with the least possible delay af
ter their termination.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE,


wAsHISGroS, Oct. q, 1855. !


SIR: 1t Is understood that JameS Lynch and
John Mcmahon have been recently convicted In q
ooloaial court Of Canada, and sentenced to death
upon charge that being citizens Of the United
States they were actors in the assault made In the
month Of June last, at Fort Erie on that colony
1t can hardly be necessary to direct your attention
to the fact that the Government Of the United
States 10 required by the highest considerations Of
national dignity, duty and honor, to inquire into
the legality, justice and regularity Of tho judicial
proceedings which have thus taken place, and that
after making such q careful scrutiny we shall ex.
pect to make known to her Majosty's Government
such opinions as the President upon due considera.
tion shall adopt.


ronto Is this day instructed to procure, for the in
formation Of this Department. a copy Of the record
Of the trial and conviction of Lynch and McMa-
hon, and also Of all further trials and convictions
Of similar character which shall take place In
Canada.
While no unnecessary delay in the examination
Of the cases which are thus expected to come be-
fore this Government Is intended II may neverthe-
less happen hereafter that delays unavoidably re-
suit from past incidents, or from future events
which cannot now DO foreseen.


have now the honor to request you to take such
proceedings as you may think proper to the end
that such applications Of the consul shall be
promptly granted


Tho President directs mo to assure you Of his
confident hope that Her Majesty's Government will
not only cheerfully comply with the request have
thus made but that they will think it proper also
to examine the Judicial proceedings aforesaid with
careful regard to the rights Of tho United States
and to the maintenance Of good relations between
the two countries.


Such relations ars always difficult and delicate in
States that are adjacent to each other without
being separated by impossible borders For this
reason 1t would be very gratifying to the President
II you should be able to give me an assurance that
tho execution Of the sentences pronounced upon
convicted persons will be suspended If occasion for
delay shall, in tho manner before mentioned, mako
it desirable.


Finally, deem 1t proper to say that the offences
involved In these trials are in their nature emf.
nently political. 1t is tho opinion of this Govern
ment that sound policy comedies with the best i'm
pulses of benevolent nature in recommending ten
derness, amnesty and forgiveness in such cases.
This suggestion Is made with freedom and earnest.
| moss because the same opinions were proposed ia
us In our own recent civil war by all the Govern
msnts and publcists Of Europe, and by none oi
them with greater frankness than by the Govern.
ment and Statesmen Of Great Britain.


am very sure that you will find that these re-
commentators Of policy Of clsmency and for
giveness in the case Of the parties concerned are
| entire harmony with nll the suggestions and 70
Communications which this Government has made
to her Majesty's Government in regard to the az
gressions which have been made on the Canadian
frontier, and that they arc also in harmony with
the proceedings which this Government hal
thought 1t just, wise and prudent to pursue in re
gard to the violation Of its own neutrality laws
which was involved in those aggressions

 U. s. GRANT, Lieutenant General.

 Major General P. H. SHERIDAN.

 On the 25th I received a dispatch from General Sheridan, inquiring where Sherman was aiming for, and if could give him definite information as to the points he might be ex- pected to move on this side of Charlotte, North Carolina In answer the following tel- egram was sent him:

 ""CITY Po1NT, VA, February 25, lS65. l GENERAL Shermans movements will de- pend on the amount of opposition he meets with from the enemy. If strongly opposed, he may possibly have to fall back to George town, S. C., and fit out for a new start. I think however, all danger for the necessity of going to that point has passed. believe he | has passed Charlotte. He may take Fayette- vile on his way to Goldsbero'. If you reach Lynchburg, you will have to be guided in your after movements by the information you obtain. Before you could possibly reach Sherman, I think you would find him moving from Colds. boro towards Raleigh, or engaging the enemy strongly posted at one or the other of these places, with railroad communications opened from his army to Wilmington or Newborn. ""U. s. GRANT, Lieutenant General. Major-General P. H. SHERIDAN""

 General Sheridan moved from Winchester on the 27th of February, with two divisions of cavalry numbering about 5000 each. On the lst of March he secured the bridge, which the enemy attempted to destroy across the middle fork of the Shenandoah, at Mount Crawford, and entered Staunton on the 2d, the enemy having retreated on Waynesboro'. Thence he pushed on to Waynesboro', where he found the enemy in force in an intrenched position, under General Early. Without stop ! ping to make a reconnaissance, an immediate attack was made the position was carried, and ! I l oP | horses and caissons complete, 290 wagons and teams loaded with subsistence, and 17 battle flags, were captured. The prisoners, under an escort of 1900 men, were sent back to Win chester. Thence he marched on Charlottes- vile, destroying efectually the railroad and bridges as he went, which place he reached on the 3d. Here he remained two days. destroy. ing the railroad toward Richmond and Lynch burg, including the large iron bridges over the north and south forks of the Rivanna river, and awaiting the arrival of his trains. This necessary delay caused him to abandon the idea of capturing Lynchburg. On the morn- ing of the 6tb, dividing his force into two col umns, he sent one to Scottsvlle, whence it marched up the James River canal to New Market, destroying every lock, and in many places the bank of the canal. From here a force was pushed out from this column to Dui- guidsville, to obtain possession of the bridge | across the James river at that place. but failed. The enemy burned it on our approach. The enemy also burned the bridge across the river at Hardwicksville The other column moved down the railroad toward Lynchburg, destroy ing it as far as Amherst Court House, sixteen miles from Lynchburg thence across the country, uniting with the column at New Market. The river being very high, his pom toons would not reach across it and the enc. my having destroyed the bridges by which he had hoped to cross the river and get on the South Side railroad about Farmville, and de- stroY it to Appomattox Court House, the only thing left him was to return to Winchester or strike base at the White House. Fortunate ly he choose the latter. From New Market he took up his line of march, following the canal towards Richmond destroying every lock upon it and cutting the banks wherever prac- ticable, to point eight miles east of Geoch- land, concentrating the whole force ct Colum- bia on the 10th. Here he rested one day, and sent through by scouts information of his whereabouts and purposes, and request for supplies to meet him at White House, which reached me on the night of the l2th. An infantry force was immediately sent to get possession of White House, and supplies were forwarded. Moving from Columbia in iirec- tion to threaten Richmond to near Ashland Station, he crossed the Annas, and after hay ing destroyed all the bridges and many miles of the railroad, proceeded down the north bank of the Pamunkey to White House, which place he reached on the 18th.

 Previous to this the following commpn;co. tlon was sent to General Thomas:

 "" C1TY Po1NT, VA, March [, ls65-eaO.y

 ""GENERAL: I think it will be adv;sah,. DO"" for you to repair the railroad in East Tennessee, and throw good force up to Bulls aap and fortify there. Supplies at Knoxyill. l"

(Continued.)",,"(Continued)

 Among the important fruits of this cam paign was the fall of Charleston, South Carolina. It was evacuated by the enemy on the nj ,ht of the l7th of February, and occu pied by our forces on the 18th. 1 On the morning of the 3lst of January General Thomas was directed to Send cavalry expedition under General Stoneman from East Tennessee, to penetrate South Carolina well down towards Columbia, to destroy tha railroads and military resources of the coun- try, and return, if he was able, to East Ten nessee, by way of Salisbury, North Carolina, releasing our prisoners there, if possible. Of the feasibility of this latter, however, General Stoneman was to judge sherman's move ments. had no doubt, would attract the at l tention of all the force the enemy could col lect, and facilitate the execution of this. Gen eral Stoneman was so late in making his start on this expedition, land Sherman having passed out of the State of South Carolina on the 27th of February directed General Thomas to change his course, and ordered him to repeat his raid of last fall destroying the railroad towards Lynchburgh as far as he could. This would keep him between Our garrisons in East Tennessee and the enemy regarded it not impossible that in the event of the enemy being driven from Richmond he mi ght fall back to Lynchburg aud attempt raid north through East Tennessee. On the l4th of February the following communica- ton was sent to General Thomas:

 ""CITY POINT, VA, Feb. IA, 1865.

 ""General Canby is preparing movement from Mobile bay against Mobile and the inte- rior of Alabama. His force will consist of about 20 900 men, besides A. J. Smiths con- mand. The cavalry you have sent to Canby will be debarked at Vicksburg. It, with the available cavalry already in that section. will move from there eastward in cooperation Hoods army has been terribly reduced by the severe punishment you gave it in Tennessee, by desertion consequent upon their defeat, and now by the withdrawal of many of them to oppose Sherman. q take it large portion of the infantry has been SO withdrawn. It is so asserted in the Richmond papers, and member of the rebel Congress said few days since in speech, that one-half of it had been i brought to South Carolina to oppose Sher- 1 Haa.) This being true. or even if it is not true Canby's movement will attract all the attention of the enemy, and leave the advance from your standpoint easy. think it advisa- ble, therefore that you prepare as much of a cavalry force as you can spare, and hold it in readiness to go south. The object would be three fold |: frst, to attract as much of the en- emy's force as possible to insure success to Canby; second, to destroy the enemy's line of communications and military resources third, to destroy or capture their forces brought into the field. Tuscaloosa and Selma would prob ably be the points to direct the expedition against. This, however, would hot be so i'm. portant as the mere fact of penetrating deep into Alabama. Discretion should be left to the officer commanding the expedition to go where, according to the information he may receive, he will best secure ths objects named above.

 ""Now that your force has been so much de- pleted, do not know what number of men you can put into the field. If not more than 5000 men, however, all cavalry, think it will be sufficient. It is not desirable that you should start this expedition until the one leav- ing Vicksburg has been three or four days out, or even week. do not know when it will start, but will inform you by telegraph as soon as learn. If you should hear through other sources before hearing from me, you can act on the information received

 ""l'o insure success your cavalry should go with as little wagon train as possible, relying upon the country for supplies. would also reduce the number of guns to a battery, or the number of batteries, and put the extra teams to the guns taken. No guns or caissons should be taken with less than eight horses. ""rlease inform me by telegraph, on receipt of this, what force you think you will be able to send under these directions.

 ""U. s. GRANT, Lieutenant General Major General G. H. THOMAS""

 On the 18th he was directed to start the ex- petition as soon after the 2Oth as he could get it off:

 Ideemed it of the utmost importance, be- fore general movement of the armies opera ting against Richmond, that all communica- tions with the city, north of James river, should be cut of. The enemy having with. drawn the bulk of his force from the Shenan- dcah valley and sent it south, or replaced troops sent from Richmond, and desiring to re-enfor ce Sherman, if practicable, whose cavalry was greatly inferior to that of the enemy, determined to make move from the Shenandoah, which if successful, would accomplish the first at least, and possibly the. latter of these objects. therefore telegraph ed General Sheridan as follows

gives long conversations purporting to have
occurred between himself and Virginia ne

as it was the second occasion within month that
one Of our most enterprising bookseller firms have
been burnt out. Messrs. Putnam q Malone ppeat @
TO have been particularly unfortunate. ihey yI nase
on two occasions been Just inaugurahng spieh,
did business, when their stock has beeh aItaekeo
by the devouTing element. Ga both occasions the
fire originated in building three buildings from
their own. They have, however, set q n0DIe e&-
anple to the business men Of Mobile. On each
occasion nothing daunted, they have Immediately
proceeded to reestablish their business In new
locality without even twenty-iour heurs delay
Dr. Watkins suffered severely by the same fire,
and lost his whole stock of goods, with the very
unsatisfactory feeling that his insurance was q
mere song, while his loss was very extensive.


The two days of racing down the bay created
considerable excitement. The steamers taking
passengers to the spot were crowded, and the
races proved very satisfactory. The regetta on
the second day was complete success.


The dinner at the Point Clear Hotel on last Sun
day was attended by a large and select company,
and is reported to have been very recherche
affair, and was very much enjoyed by the large
party who left Mobile on that occasion to partici-
pate in it.


During the week the draymen have been very
much excited upon the subject of reducing their
prices from four bits to two bits q Load. They
propose to follow the matter up.


The board of councilmen signalized the week
by passing over the acting mayors veto, by two
third vote, the Sunday market ordinance.


Two or three days ago we copied from the
Mobile papers an account of the robbery of a
passenger on the Mobile and Ohio railroad by
the baggage master Of the train. The den0aeuee1t
was tragical, as will be seen from the following
account in the Times:


IHR GOLD RoBBERY-S Suicide Of the Baggage
Muster.-The body of the baggage master, John
Beew, was found in the station house at Kushla,
on the Mobile and Ohio railroad yesterday, and
brought down on the this morning. Deputy
Coroner Starr held an inquest on his remains, and
returned the verdict that deceased had come to
his death from pistol shot wound in the head,
inflicted by himself.


This Bellew was the baggage master charged
with robbing DR.. Grant Of S700 in gold and max
ing his escape from the cars. He probably com
rnitted suicide to escape the consequences of his
act. The 500 ia gold was not recovered. Seven
teen dollars and fifty cents in silver and seven dol
lars and fifty cents in gold were found on his
person. dirk was found sticking in a sack of
corn by which the body was discovered lying, and
the pistol with which the fatal act was committed
was found in his hand. He had probably at
tempted the act first but his courage gave way.

TsrribIs Accident on the TlshmoRd i,, and
Twelve Persons Injured


Yesterday evening, about O'Clock, when the
mail and passenger train from Greensboro to this
city lad reached about half mile east of Goalfeld
station, on the Richmond and Danville railroad,
about twelve miles above Richmond the hindmost
or ladies' car ran off the track punging down the
left embankment, killing one lady and seriously
ininring several other passengers male and female
The following are the names of the persons in
jured


Mrs Trotter, of Danyflle, killed.


Rey Bishop EARLY, Of the M. q. Church, South,
residing in Lynchhurg, it is feared, mortally
wounded internally. The bishop is over eighty


Miss Newman, of Orange county va, badly in
jaTad internally.


Isaac 0yerby, Of Messing Ford, Charlotte eoun-
ty badly injured Internally.


Mrs. S. Z. Hayward wife of Captain W. H, Hay
ward Of this city, arm broken.


@. Ed. Melcher, native of Germany, slightly in
the head.


Ms ]. c. Hobson, Of this city, slightly in the
head,


Ne. ana Mrs. J. G. Harkness, of Washington
city, slightly injured.


Robert ID, Green, of this city, slightly.


Miss D. B. Anderson, of this city, slightly.


Miss Green Pace, of DanYille, slightly.


Mrs. K a. Denier, of this city, slightly.


The facts OF the accident, SO far as we could
learn them, are these


The train was running along at rate of three
and a half miles an hour, and after the locomotive
and forward cars had passed the switch, when by
The breaking or slipping Of bolt in the rod of the
Switch thereby throwing the rails of the track on
which the train was then running out OF place, the
rear wheels Of the car ran against instead of the
track, breaking the truck and coupling irons, and
preeipitating the car down the bank about thirty
ieet making one and halt turns, and stopping at
the bottom resting on its side.


The accident was SO sudden that few realized
what was occurring excepting Mrs. Trotter, who,





jumping out Of the window on the opposite side
on which the car was falling, hut had succeeded
only IN getting partially through when she was
crushed and instantly killed by the car falling upon
her as il rolled over in going down the slope. The
other passengers were injured by being thrown
about the car in the descent.


Bishop Early of the Methodist Episcopal Church
nonth over four score years of age, was injured
internally, and is feared from Che character Of his
wounds and the extreme age of the sufferer that
they will prove fatal. The slightest movement of
AFF !. -
very freely, and also causing intense agony which
ne bore with the resignation of Christian hero
Many prayers will be offered for his recovery.


Miss Newman, Of Orange county, Va, and
isaac OVerbyt OF this city, were also severely
injured internally, and it is feared their wounds
Wil terminate fatally. The three above named
we're 50 severely injured that il was found that !
they could not be brought to the CITY, and were |
left at Coalield where they will receive avery /
care and attention.


The citizens in the vicinity Of the accident
immediately volunteered their services and lent i
wreck. = |
The scene of the accident, as described bv eve
witnesses, was heartrendng in the extreme-l
men and women lying amid the debris of the acci-
dent, helplessly wounded and moaning piteously |
for help-mothera crying for their children dread
ing to hear from them fearing the worst and chill
dreR seeking their mothers, rendered ii a sight |
which caused strong men to weep as thew nobly |
worked to relieve the sufferers This is a most |
iamentable affair; but, so far as can be learned
no blame, any, can be attached to any Of the
employees of the road but. from the facts in the
case, suppose it to have occurred by an accident
which no human foresight could prevent.
This is the only fatal accident which has hap
pened on this road for six years, when at the same
place car was thrown off the track and rolled
down the right side of the embankment, instantly
killing two hrakesmen who were standing at their
posts. In the accident yesterday none of the rail
road employees were injured The conductor, at
the time Of the accident, was just about stepping
on the platform Of the car as it broke from the
train and rolled down the hill few seconds more
and he would have been upon it, and would have
most probably been killed.
Y When the train reached the city large number
q citizens, who had assembled on hearing of the
accident, aided in removing the wounded from the
taln and seeing that every attention necessary I
was given them.-I Richmond Times

This list comprises all whose n,mes we have been
able TO obtain, and II there others injured their
injuries are only very slight It may bs remarked
that only one person in the was entirely unin-
jured, and that was Mr. A. @. Jetres, Of Charlotte
county.


The circumstances Of this sad affair as detailed
to us by an eye witness are as follows:
In passing switch about three hundred yards
this side Of Coalheld Station, by the arring Of the
train an old iron pin which held the switch to Its
place Was snapped 10 two. Tho breakage occurred
Just the engine and ali the cars except the last
ladies' carl had passed over the point As the
pin broke the switch rod fell obliquely downward,
causing the iron rail Of the track TO be moved from
its proper place. This threw the wheels Of the rear
car on top Of the rail. No chance being afforded





II notified the train continued rapidly to move for.
ward


The rear car thus od the track prooseded some
distance on top Of the rails, then Jumping and
bouncing from sill TO sill, 1t soon tore loose from
the car next In 'front.' breaking of part Of the
platform Of that car. The rear car thus detached.
was quickly preciptated down an embankment some
hfty feet high, making in its fall, some say, two,
others three, entire revolutions About midway Of
this smbAnkmsnt the iron truck and wheels under
the separated from 1t, aud falling between the
car and the bottom Of the smbAnkment, caught on
the side OF the car and arrested Its descent In that
condition, the resting on its side, about half
way down the embankment the passengers were
rescued from the wreck.


The car wrecked was one Of the new and elegant
ones lately purchased by tho Danyille road, and
cost nearly $4,000. It had beautiful yentilAting
apparatus on top tAstefuly arranged with stained
glass windows whilst the interior was comfortable,

no Conclusion Reached BY the President


and the Attorney General,",,"WASHINGTON, Nov. 1.-Gen. Dick Taylor, who,
as has already been announced, has been on a
visit to his brother,in-law, Mr. Davis, at Fortress
Monroe, returned thence to this city to-day.


Mr.. Davis is reported to be very feeble.


No particulars connected with the subject of the
visit have been made public; and it is understood
or believed that the permission granted to General
Taylor to make it, was accompanied By condi-
ton that he should observe secrecy with respect
to the circumstances attending it, This, although
it seems to be very probable, is not positively
known.


There have been several nominations for ap-
pointments in Louisiana made to-day. Mr.. Clack,
| This appears to be the name as far as we can
conjecture from the writing of the telegraph
operator-[ED CRESCENT, has been nominated
for the post Of auditor oice Ready; [Mr. Ready
is assessor in the internal revenue department,
and the word auditor . in the telegram ought to
be, it would seem, 4"" assessor.""-ED. CREsCENT1
Mr.. Smith has been nominated uice Read; and Mr..
Whitehouse Uice Norcross.


The President to-day sent a telegram to the
present United States marshal for Louisiana, Mr..
Bullitt, summoning him to Washington. From
this, it would seem that there is more doubt than
ever whether he will be superseded, ,notwithstand
ing the confidence with which the appointment
of his successor has been named


Gov. Swami, of Maryland, and Mr.. Latrobe
have had an audience with the President agair
to-day. Ella.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 1.-Gen. Grant has gone to
Baltimore. He arrived there this afternoon. Hi
presence in that city is inferred to have connec
ton with the disturbances threatening there il


consequence of the action of Gov. Swami in th


case of the police commissioners.


Mr.. Thurston, the United States consul at To


ronto, having in accordance with instructions fro1
the department of State procured and forwardet
to Washington a copy of the record of the trial 0

to be hanged for participation in the Fenian raj

They have not yet, however, publicly announce
any definite conclusion from it.

to regard these men the light Of sanctined martyrs
and that never since 1856 except solitary instance
and then by the barest majority has returned other than
the blackest republicans to Congress- If Maine veers

 oHH oIo cko1ro &Iokt ty laws which England had evaded during the was were stifl binding on the Uuited States The temp tation tofattef false hopes, and batter with the tenthusiasm of brave men was to strong to be resisted, and Andrew Johnson yielded. No doub be thought this talk of fighting for the free dom of Ireland was merely the boast and bluster of hotiheaded Inshmen, and would end in words on ly. He did not know that these men, right or Wreng in their interpretation of international laws. wereFdesperately in earnest, and that what to- him wasthes mere instrument political ambition, was to them the hoiest of causes. The Fenian delega- tons which waited upon him left his presence in- spired with new ardpr His words were quoted in secret meetings, and used as arguments to recruit theFenian army and replenish it's treasury. John Mitchell deliberately defed his power and in June, 1865, Yas,arrested and imprisoned in Fortress Mon roe, But he did not remain long in the custody of the United States. His arrest was the subject of diseussiohsin every Fenian circle, and delegates wefeMppDinted to ask his release of the President At4heearnest request of the Fenian leaders, made

 

 sential to their cause, Andrew Johnson set Mtchei free, Great was the exultation that followed this sSt, and there was not an Irishman who had not thesfight to believe that Mir Johnson approved their planss Thus he deliberately and consistently e11co1raEed the whole movement, and under his slppQsed protection the Irish threat at last became an Irish blow, and suddenly the country was start led by the report that an Irish army had crossed the frontier and that all Canada was in arms to re- ,s Ehs Irish army invaded Canada flushed with the faith that Andrew Johnson would not interfere. They believed that he would answer British do- mands for the enforcement of the neutrality laws with the British interpretation, and the precedent ofBfitsh ports opened to rebel cruisers, and rebe ghns supplied by British arsenals: They expected hewonld. .apswer the Alabama and the Florida with Montreal and Quebec. They asked no other help not man or gun-they simply trusted that this man, who from first to last had never said one word against their dear cause, but had uttered many that seemed to favor it, would do nothing against thens [. Thus their leaders have declared, and it WIS this belief that gave the Fenian movement it's strength Had they known what Andrew Johnson would do when their hour of trial came, enter prise foolhardy as the invasion of Canada would h1ver have been attempteda7 Enthusiastic as the 15ish were, they would never have measured their imperfect strength against the combined power ot Great Britain and the United States. Andrew Jph1son could have prevented the whole movement by Dne honest word. Had he even hinted his in tehtions thearnly would never have been organized to fight on American soi the lll-fated expedition lives of brave men would not have been vainly lost and Lynch and McMahon would would not be fel- onS in 8 British cell. But he let the Irishmen in America go on with their plans, till the moment when they thought victory was in their grasp-what then did. he do? 4ai.zr e-.rf.5. l.~ =

 He crushed them with tho proclamation of June &h., Five days after they had secured foothold

 n Canada, and were hurrying up troops, while even the colored men in Philadelphia had caught the fire and offered to send men to the front, Andrew John. son.ordered Gen Meade to call out the land and na- val forces of the United States to crush this unlaw fnl enterprise. American soldiers who had fought sde by side with Irish soldiers in the war for the Onion, unwiing1y confronted them as foes. The 2eaf wfth which the invaders were pursued by the UNited States exceeded that shown by the Cana dianss Canada rejoiced at this unexpected re-en- forrement and left the defense of her frontier to her oficious ally. By Andrew Johnson's orders arms and ammunition were seized, Fenian battalions captured or driven back, and Gen. Sweeney and President Roberts were arrested. This sudden, unexpected blow fell with crushing force. The Fe- nisn movement was paralyzed; it's army crumbled bands recrossed the frontier, and many an Irish heart beat with grief and indignation so much for the defeat that might have been the fate oi war, as for the betrayal which the act of the man from whom they had nothing but encourage.

 Now that the matter is ended calm considera- .ton of it's history proves beyond doubt that An drew Sotnson might have prevented all the waste warm hopes, the shame and pain of defeat by hon. estly declaring his purpose, He had only to have said, eff this invasion is attempted, will crush it, to have compelled it's abandonment. But he chose eto play with these earnest mento permit it to be attempted, and to crush it afterward. Some oi them paid with their lives for the mistake of trust ing him, and Lynch and McMahon are now by bis act placed in the shadow of the gallows. If they are hanged, Andrew Johnson is to blame. The least he do to repair the evil is to insist upon : their pardon. He has Q right to demand theil lives of the British Government, for it owes him no ordinary debt. Had he interfered before the inva- son, the Fenian force would not nave been wasted but might have been employed in Ireland, and had B he not interfered after the invasion begun, the : Irish flag might have waved in triumph over more than one Canadian city. His services to England 1 were great, and mercy for, Lynoh and McMahon would be little for her to grant, and less for him to ask.--N r Tribune.

 This party of. gentlemen stared from Philadel- phia on Monday morning last accompanied by Pittsburgh, all as the guests of the American Iron and Steel Association, for the purpose of examin- ing the Mineral regions. and manufacturing local- ties of Pennsylvania. For several days the delega- tions hos been exploring the mines and works in the Leigh and Lebanon Valleys, and this morning arrived at Johnstown where it was met by special train from this city under the care of Assistant Su- parintendent J. McC. Creighton, containing Hon k Moofhead, Hon Thomas Williams Hon John Co., vode and a number of our iron and steel manufac- turers. ..' .,-.rf-.t r.E tor. ..-.-4 .,l ;. The whole party escorted by Hon D Morrell, Member of Congress elect, then proceeded to visit the great works of the Cambria Iron Company perhaps the largest rail works in the country. Af- ter an hour or so thus engaged, the guestswere invited by Messrs. Wood, Morrell & Co.,, to sump- tuous entertainment.

 This over, the train moved on to Irwins Station, where halt of about hour occurred for the pur- pose of inspecting the Westmoreland Coal Com panys works. The Party then came direct to Pitts burgh, arriving about 73 P. M.

 To day the guests will be shown some of our ex- tensive manufacturing establishments, and to-mor- row will start pn the return ip, via the West Penn sylyaflia railroad andB Blairsyille function.

 It is to be regretted that distinguished and in- telgent party of visitors have not allowed them selves longer time in which to examine the great manufacturing facilities of the State and especial 1 of Tn tOfi fT, ot we have here to be seen, would require at least all the time allowed for the wh ole trip. We are glad, however to welcome them for even 50 brief a Yist and hope it will be profitable and entertaining Some forty of the gentlemen comprising the party above referred to-, left Philadel- phia on Monday morning the 18th ult., and wereifdr the entire week the guests of the Iron and Steel Association and several of the R.R Companies of Penn. The party was increased at various points along the different routes until it reached Pittsburgh when il. numbered about one hundred per 1t was entertained with princely munif- cence during the entire week, by the asso- ciation and R. R. Companies above refer redto, and transported from one point to another in the most luxurious manner that has yet been attained in Railroad travelling. Every facility was afforded, that one weeks time would permit, to visit the mining and manufacturing regions of that 7wealthiest of States. These facilities were made as avail ablesas possible by the whole party. The bearing of the Vice President during the whole excursion was dignifed, and com handed the highest respect of all parties. The other gentlemen were earnest in pur- suit of the objects which had led to their assembling, to wit, an investigation into the manufacturing, n mining and mineral re- sources of the Key Stone State. a.a- B ' There was no rowdyism or undignifed EEdepotment on the part of, any individual conneeted with the expedition, thus pre- sentinga quite a contrast to the wonderful political campaign. of still higher func- tionaryl of the Government, which was so slheply humiliating to the American people, E3 q A-r F.F = r and which so effectually extinguished the political prospects of several aspirants for political power.

THE DEMOCRACY FIILrBUsTER.


Immediately Mr.. Rogers, of New Jersey,
rose to debate the question % but he was at
once called to order He was followed by
several others, and for little while 1t looked
as if the Democracy intended to ""illibuster,""
viz. to delay action by lactious motions. But
after one or two callings for ayes and noes
the powerful feeling in favor of the bill be-
came 50 apparent, that the Democrats gave

al tragedy, rivaling those Of Deer6eld
in this State, and Philadelphia, Pa,
where whole families were hhtchercd,
occurred ut an early hour on Tuesday
morning, in the vicinity Of West Baden,
Orange county, Indiana l@a .usi


From what we have been informed OF
the case, it appears that shortly after
the breaking out Of the war, . man
named McCracken, enlisted in tho
Union ranks. A short time after his
departure for the seat Of war his house
and barn were burned TO the ground,
the FIRE having originated by the torch
of an incendiary. On returning home,
after having served his country faith
fully, Mr. McCracken learned from a
family NAMED Woodward that man
named William Saunders was the in
cendiary, his own daughter having
acknowledged the fact. Saunders was
arrested at the instance of McCracken,
but the case was finally compromised,
and the suit Withdrawn. The county
officials, however, took hold of the mat
ter, aud the grand jury having indicted
Saunders, his trial was set for this week.


Saunders, hearing that the Woodward
family would be the principal witnesses
against him, sworc that they should
never appear 10 the court room alive.
In fulfilmcnt Of these threats, he, on
Tuesday morning last, short time be.
fore daylight, repaired 10 the residence
of Mr.. Woodward, and with bowie
knife, coolly and deliberately murdered
Mr. Woodward, bis wife, aud eldest
daughter, and an old lady, the mother
of Woodward. The bloody deed be.
coming knowing throughout the neigh
borhood, the murderer was pursued and
finally arrested The most intense cx-
citemcnt prevailed throughout the whole
of Orange cauuty, and strong threats Of
lynchiug the assassin have been made"

YOU make a social call of evening young

come in at o'clock, an hour and a half is GER
tainly as long as the most fascinating of you in
conversation eau or rather ought to desire to use

pleasantly spent with music; chess or some other
game to lend variety but, kind srs, by no

mortal terror lest papa should put his oft-repeat

COUNTY, VA.-On Thursday evening of last
week Mrs. DrummOnd, wife of Can't John
Drummond resident of Accomac county, near
POngoteague, was most brutally murdered by
negro who was recently in the army. The
New Town Record says:


lie also attempted the murder of a colored
woman at the same time. His purpose was
robbery. lie asked Mrs. Drummond for some
money, supposed to be in the house, which she
refused to give him, whereupon he procured
an axe and burst her skull open and dragged
her to the stables. He then demanded of the
eeoored woman that she should say that the
horse kicked her mistress. -


She refused to tell the falsehood, and he then
struck her with the axe in the same manner
and left her for dead. The colored woman
though dangerously wounded, revived sufi-
GENTLY to state the above facts, and with strict at


tenton being paid to her case may eventually re-
cover. The citizens of PongOteague went in
search OF the author of the fendish act. and
capturing him, at once hung him to limb of
O tree

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 30.-At . meeting Of the

Hall this evening"" to express their sentiments on
the conviction and sentence Of Col. Lynch and Rev.
John McMahon, the following preamble and reso.
lutions were offered by James boons, chairman Of
the committee. and unanimously adopted:


Whereas the conviction and sentence of death
passed on Colonel R. B. Lynch and the Row John
McMahon, in . Canadian court, ID another eyi.
dsnce Of the brutal and vindiotive spirit Of psradi
Gus Britain, and in keeping with that bloody code
Of laws that has been inflicted by her usurpations
the people Of Ireland during the last seven hun.
dred years. and whereas Chief Justice Wilson, one
Of the representatives Of British royalty on this con-
tinsnt in passing sentence read lecture, full Of
that cant and hypocrisy peculiar to English philan
thropy, on tho hideous crime Of making war on q
people who mover did them any harm, while the
Government he represents has been making relent.
loss, bloody, and eIterminating war upon the
people Of Ireland for generations-s people
who never injured England-on the contrary
educated her ignorant kings when her people
were buried in Saxon barbarisIni and whore.
as the learned judge while filled with holy
and others, forgot in his zeal the aid and comfort
given by his government to dissolve this Union and
overthrow this Government; he forgot the depreda.
tions Of the Alabama the st. Albans raids and the
other infamous machinations worthy Of that raAliR-
nant hate evinced by England since the for nation
Of this Government and whereas the inv aston Of
Ireland in the year 1869 by English fire., hooters,
whereby cities, villages and hamlets wers, commit.
ted to the flames, and the inhabitants put to the
sword or driven to caves and mountain businesses,
was crime committed against all law human and
DIVING and every generation of our CO since that
melancholy event has protested aga' INST that in.
vasion, with arms in their hands tn erefore be 1t


RssOfved That in view o: the fore going facts the
invasion Of British territory by the fenan Brother
hood of the United States was legitimate act of
war on the part Of an oppressed people; that the
time to strife and whore to strike is question Of
policy, whether 1t be seirng the colonies of the op
pressor or sweeping her commerce from the seas 1t
was she assertion Of this Godgiven right to regain
their onglost liberties and restore their ancient
rationalty that nerved the arm Of the Fenian SOL
der to strike to the dust the hated flag Of England
on Limestone Ridge.


Rssoiosd That we look on the trials, conviction
and sentences passed on Colonel Lynch and others
as challenge to the Irishmen Of America, and we
accept 1t in the spirit intendsd and We pledge our
lives liberty and sacred honor to meet the issue

6_1866-09-29_p4_sn93052977_00279557451_1866092901_0103,Weekly Calaveras chronicle.,01,1866-09-29,p4,,,"THE SUSPICIOUS MAN.-That kind
of individual is always smelling a con-
tinuous line of rats. He sees, hears
nor dreams of anything in which he
does not ""smell a rat"" The most
harmless action of his neighbors, under
his suspicious and inquisitorial disposi-
ton, is made matter of serious inves
tigatiou, because he knows there is some
thing in the wind, for he saw his neigh
Dor MIR. B., speaking very eonfdentially
to Mrs. S that very morning in the
market. He puts that and that to.
gether, as he calls it, and con8ects this
whispering in the morning with some
thing he heard in the barber shop some
weeks before. and he is satisfied his
neighbor B. is either going to fail in
business or abscond without giving his
creditors due notice.


The most terrible part of such a man s
character is that he places such faith
upon the corrollaries he draws from his
false premises, that he does not hesitate
to give wing to the base suspicious of
his mind, and frequently is the means
of bringing about disaster which never
would have happened but for him.


Many happy homes have been render
ed desolate-many prosperous young
man brought to ruin-many virtuous
and amiable girl driven to despair BY
the feudish inuendoes of the Suspic-
ious Man. No man, however upright
and honest-no woman, however ire
proachable-no maiden, however pure,
is safe in the. neighborhood of the Sus-
picious man. He has all the curiosity
of Paul Pry without his good nature
aud the malignity of the devil without
his talent.


If ever lynch-law is justi6able in a
community it is when exercised on the
Suspicious Man. Rotten to the core of
ais heart himself, be has no faith in the
virtue and honesty of others. He exists
In a state of continual doubt of the mo-
tives and actions of others, and in con-
sequence his life is, at the best, but a
prolonged misery."

may be said to have been born. The growth
OF the infant was rapid-so rapid. in fact.
that clothes could not be made fast enough
to adorn her person. Much of the time was
she seen IN rags for this reason Attaining
In 'o4 and 80 a growth that entitled her to
consideration among her sisters, she began
naturally to put on airs She dressed up,
wore store clothes, and residents and visitors
could find rest in her bosom. Time passed.
In '5S she had attained her growth. There
was then so much bosom to rest in that her
citizens and visitors could not fill its capacity.
Then she supported two newspapers, the
advertising columns of which were filed
with advertisements, and business generally
was in Furnishing condition.


In go her citizens began to drop eff, and
from year to year the dropping off increased.
First among those seeking rest elsewhere
were those who had accumulated prineeiy
fortunes here then followed those who had
done very well, and then those who had SIM
ply done well-well enough to justify com
potency for moderate appettes and next
the miners. clerks, roughs and lawyers; so
that in '66 it may be said only those remain
who cannot from one cause or another get
away and those who are so well pleased
with the locality, its surroundings, its fruits,
its wines, its pure air and pure water, as well
as the assurance afforded of a good living for
moderate exertions and ordinary economy
That is Just about what Shasta is now, sup
porting few professional men, number of
mechanics, merchants, miners and laborers.


True our advertising columns don't show
all this, when perhaps they ought to; for
well are we aware that it is there people look
to see the amount of business done in the
place of its publication. Now let us see
what conclusion an outsider would come to
on looking over that department of the CoU-
RIER He would find that Shasta had two
dry goods stores-R. Isaaes & Bro. and Louis
Laventhal two hardware stores-A. Cole.
man & Co. and Taylor & Voluntine-in one
of which tin, sheet iron, zinc. &C., are manu-
factured two grocery and provision houses
Daniel Lynch and Bush & Carlson one
blacksmith shop-Richards & Co.-one boot
and shoe store David Beinert one assay
office-E. Levin & Co.. one house doing
general tobacco, cigar and stationery busi
ness-J NJ. Manasse and one physician
j. E. Pelham. Not hotel in the place not
an attorney ;.not an express Office there is
a stage line, but not livery stable or corral
for the accommodation of the travelling pub
lie not IA ieweller or matchmaker; not a
butcher shop or market of any kind; not
carpenter; not a billiard saloon, or any
place where one may relax from the cares of
the day by bracing up with lager, good
liquors or chain lightning.


Strangers see all these necessities for max
ing up respectable town, and of course
come to the conclusion that it doesn't amount
to much. Yet in the face and eyes of all
this we sometimes hear complaints by our
citizens that it is dull Wonderful, is it not,
that it should be so, when there is such won
derful efforts being made to show the place
up?


To progress and be great united effort is
To die is the easiest thing in the
world we have only to continue doing moth
ing jus. keep up our lick, and it is done
without an effort"

fresh and inviting than ever. The Music

there is fine engraving of ""American

dies and Childrens Costume, accompanied
by fund Of varied and practical informa-
tion on current Fashion. Altogether, it is a
splendid number, and we do not wonder
that Demorest has become indispensable to
ladies.


Beddle's Monthly -Beadle's Monthly for
April has reached us. 1t contains the best
table of contents for the general reader that
we have ever seen, embracing a variety of
literary and instructive reading matter from
the best authors, and its embellishments are
of rare merit It's model of its kind, and
should meet with an extensive circulation.


This new claimant for public patronage has
only to maintain the good taste and enter
prise which have thus far characterized it,
and it will soon become highly prosperous.


Stereopticon Erhibition.-W We had the plea
sure of witnessing u stereoptcon exhibition
at the Institute Hall, given for the benefit of


the Home for Friendless Children, by our


townsman I. Clarkson Taylor; from which


we understand they realized $130, free of


all expense. 1talso proved to be an entertain


ment such as was never before given to


Wilmington audience. Wewere very much


amused as well as gratified (when the cover
| ing was removed from the instrumenD to
| see projected upon the screen an aquarium,
| containing many curious animals, such as


are found in stagnant water They were


very agile in their movements, the result be-


ing very successful. Among them we noticed


n very long snake-like animal, which we


were informed was the gordius, from which
the word gOrdian-knot was derived. Its
movements were very peculiarly interesting.


The views that followed were nearly all new,


having been lately imported. They consist


ed principally of scenes Gnimitable)


amongst the Alps and Pyrenees mountains;


also, the glaciers of the same; some OF the


most noted royal residences, with few


choice pieces of statuary, including bust OF


our Saviour; the four Apostles, st. Matthew,


Mark, Luke and John; also, Apollo, Belve-


dere, one OF the finest specimens Of art ex-


tant. We were very much gratified to see


so large an attendance. First, on account


of the object in view. Secondly, as an ap-


probation of Mr. Taylor's efforts in procur-


ing so admirable source of entertainment


and instruction; for truly the instrument in


his possession is an honor to the city, and


we would repeat the proposition made by


one Of the audience, That he (ir, Taylor


give an exhibition for the purpose of procur


ing a collection of those slides"" For really,
it would have taken very little imagination


to have placed ourselves in the midst Of those


romantic scenes of that noble little Republic


guarded by the lofty Alps, Further com
I : ment is unnecessary. Language is made


quate; and our injunction is, if you have
another opportunity, do not neglect it o


seeing them for yourselves

likely that the Canadian authorities con-
founded the prisoner with Brigadier General
Lynch, of Illinois, who was ordered by me
to superintend the carrying out OF the expe-

have been present as newspaper reporter

by the name of Kendell was standing
against the fence when Van Foukc ran up
to him with knifsin one hand and catch
ing him BY the head with the other hand,
stabbed him in the neck. While Van
Fouke was doing tlis Ward ran up and
strsck Kendell, knocking him down and
then stamped him With the heel of his boot
in bis face. Mr.: :Ksndell testified that for
six weeks he was confined to his room from
the effects nf the wounds he received that;
day. and for sometime was in such con :.
dition as not to1 be able to recognize or
know what was. doug, about him.. These
parties were not found guilty Of an as.
sault with intent to kill, but gsilty Of an,
assault and battery The judge in. sen.
fencing them said that it was surely an
aggravated case of assault and battery, and
that il deserved severe punishment, but
being assured shat the parties had in a
great measure reformed since this unhappy
occurrence. he would sentence them to be
confined three months in the county Jail,

The President md Thad Stevens-The Moral


and Social Effect OF their Political Course


ON the Country.


During the last session Of Congress the
chiefs Of the radical party denounced the
President in the coarsest language Thad
Stevens spoke of him contemptuously as .the
man at the other end of the Avenue"" They
have called him ""traitor,"" sscoundrel,"" and
other vile names, and have gone so far
even as to say that in other times he
would have lost his head like Charles the
First. These implacable Jacobins and their
satellites are pursuing the same course at
present in their harangues to the people. The
language Of Governor Oglesby and General
Logan in Illinois lately was Of the
same character, as well as that of Speaker
Colfax and other prominent radical poll
tcians throughout the country. When we
see the Speaker Of the House Of Repre-
sentatives, governors Of States, generals
who have distinguished themselves in
the war and the leaders in Congress Of a
powerful party descend to such base and false
denunciations OF the President, what can we
say but that we have fallen upon evil and dan
gerous times! Such discreditable and debas-
ing conduct in political life must lead TO great
social generalization.


In the early period Of our history refinement
Of manners and courtesy universally prevailed.
However opposed the public men OF that day
were to each other on political questions, they
always behaved like gentlemen. We read now
with pride and delight Of the charming, digni- |
fed and refined manners Of the leading men
in our revolutionary times, and all along
from tI,o t;nno ,r Wash,uctcr - Tohv S...n
This condition Of society continued until |
the conflict between. the sectional factions
Of the North and South-the abolitionists and
essionists--commenced Then We began to
descend to vulgarity and barbarism. The
vilest abuse and personal violence were wit
messed in the halls of the national legislature.
Senator'S and members bullied each other until
that resulted in personsi assaults, as in the case
Of the assault Of Prestoa Brooks on Sumner.
This social barbarism led in q measure to the
war.


The war being ended, President Johnson was
disposed to exercise q humane, Christian and
gentlemanly spirit-was disposed TO forgive
ness and reconciliation. There was hope that
we might return to the mutual forbearance
and courtesy Of former days and to social
amenities in public life. We had reason to ex-
pect that the fiery ordeal OF war would have
purified us. For the FIRST few months after the
war closed everything seemed to be going on
smoothly and well. The wise and humane
policy Of the President appeared to have few
or no opponents. Then arose that spirit of
political and party ambition, Of discord and
vindictivcness OF scurrilous abuse Of the Chief
Of the republic, and of violence similar to that
which Immediately preceded the war. During
the last nine months such public men as Thad
Stevens, Wade, Coliax and others have been
carrying us back to social bsrbarism. The
lanrnare of the factions in Congress lust pre-"

the 18th OF July had In part for fs object the nomin
ton Of stat officers under party organization those

might unite In the Philadelphia movement. Although
Maryland ID small State her central position in the
Un on and the ties which bind her section Of
the Union make the sent ments or her people a farer

and hence the importance in great national movement
which rises above the range Of pary politics that her
citizens through all their distinctive organizat0 and
under all their party names shond individually and col
lectvely pledge themselves 10 the Of national
integrity Indeed, after the invitation which had
given 10 the convention Of the 26hyof July In their
resolution nsrnctlng their delegates confer and CO.

From the Richmond wbg, August 81


In regard 70 the compos ton Of the delegation selected
20 represent the state We have not spoken It due to
people Of the Sae that wo should express a. We now
do our entire satisfaction with ths selections made
will make fair representatives of the state There
are some not 30 prominent as others in their districts
who were not appo nted. There are hundreds of
able and influential citizens whom all Of us
perhaps have thought OF in connection with this
convention gentlemen who would have been
an honor 10 the State We may and do regret that any
such bad 10 he passed over. The committees acted
under duo deberation from the st motives and with

from the Lynchburg virgnian, Augnst4l


We are not dsposed 20 cricse sever Iy the appoint

were doubtless difficulties 10 be encountered the
very START for the committees represented many shades
Of aniecedcnt political opinion Such be tho case
Demen OF one party doubtless being inclined n defer
TO those OF the other, In matter OF much doracy
the most prominent mon OF each OF tho old parties
were, In some instances ignored In the selection IL
was not TO be expected that old party world be
selected; though there was eminent proprctv in thr
cho co 0f sucn men as Rives, Stuart. Robertson and
Brockenbrorgh, together with Others that might be
toned some of whom named nv the committee
Ihee arc some persons 10 he delegation that we would
not have preferred and who scem TO have neither

the trust. Some ''retred political philosophers are
named az sernaes, but they do no harm aud upon
the whole the delegation respectable wc trnst tha.
the wisdom and patriotism they will evincc in the con

them from wide feld Of selection. Tho Committees
acted with great prop-ey In attempting frame

tFrom the Rnic'gh IN. c. Sentinel. August IL


Judge Curtis formerly Of the United States Supreme
Court, In letter to the Hon. Q. H. Browning, says OF
the approaching convention:

ssili more u the homes Of women and which civil war
mot of all brings to the homes Of all and these pas.
OF pervsrssy rno snd m"".s OF snry ~ sp

man who b acquainted with the nature Of aud the
necessities Of civil government can contemplate such
passions without the deepest fail TO do what
ne htiy may to a'lay them Hard enough the work
will prove 70 be At the best bat scrupuous regard for
the rights OF all and magnanmous cemency are twice
blessed; they both elevate and soften the powerful ara
they ach and subdue what law and bayone,s cannot
control


These are The words Of pure and eminent statesman
and y 10 be earnestly hoped that their spirit coun.
sei viii prevail In the convention To refuse To the
southcrn delegates In the hecausa OF
her parcipancy IN the rebellion"" would be but to
revive and strengthen tho passions 10 graphically des
cribcd by Judge Curtis and to initiate nacvoient
fanatcism Of Congreu 10 which he audes rs ''nerce

II 10 nonsense TO pprse that the Southern States will
send any considerable number OF delegates who were
not one way another decid dy connected with the
Confederate The leading OF the south thoss
who control and direct public sentiment we're all en-
eased In the evolution and those leading The
very ones with whom Northern conservatives should
hold counsel


The South Is most directly and decrly Interested in
the purposes for which the CONVENTION called and
~ therefore eminen y proper that she should be heard
thru eh her chosen representatives. ff she he
thus heard the return OF faicrna feelings between the
lately warrinc sections, VIII ch u Ia prnripal oIet
of tho convention 10 promote cannot be attained ~

from oui Special Correspondent


Noarols Va. April q, 1866


On the 10Th ult., Gen. James b. steedman and Gen.
John H. Fullerton accompanied by Col. ucCloskey and
Others left Washington for journey through the South
ern States their purpose being ascertain the exact feel
ing of the different classes toward the Freedmens Bu-
reau with the view of reporting the 10 tho War De-
parmeDt The party landed Aqua Creek and proceeded
by rail to Richmond where number oj gentlemen repre-
septing the different sentiments OF the community called
npon Gen. Stecdman and gave him Their views on divers
subjects, having reference TO the Freencns Bureau.


There seems to be no doubt but what the Bureau has
been great advantage in the bringing about OF the state
OF affairs that now exists. lie freedmen are
TO have employment than they did few
months since. They complain that theiI wages ore
not sufficient and that notwithstanding the ENLARGED
mice of everything are not SO mach as their masters
ceved for their hire before the war The more Intelligent
sangune however, that wher the oPs are harvested
money will be more plenty and times better Iutehsens
farmers with whom have conveEed ay that they can
accomplish more than so per cent more Work with nee
labor than they did with slave They also say that
they lind that the education The freedman receives,
the more useful and industrious he becomes In many
places the citizens are using every eldeayor 10 insruct
The freedmen, and encourage every effort on the
uar of the more intelligent freedmen 10 teach the rodi
men,s 10 the juvenile portions OF their ftmilies


With reference TO the Bureau. There sceems TO be
feeling that il is the last remnant OF military power and
as such regarded BY many as calculated 70 give rse 10
some unpleasant feeling That il has been OF great adj
vantage the testimony OF many 6a are now 70

telling his views the subject said that be was torn IN

that there is no part Of the country where the whites

Other coloed men thought that the people have bat

considerable pride they add Now are on cur feet and
are able take Of ourselves and those that the Bu
has been caring for too The only thing We fear Is

we do now, the strong protection OF the Government""


THE better classes WILL know, do all that may be
in their power to keep from harm. But there great
satisfaction in knowing that we have something 70 depend
on and the Government has been very kind TO u.s. Some
subjects brought to the Generals notice that are
amusing but entirely foreign to the style Of information
sought. The gastronomc powers OF one freedman was
considered by coorcd man TO be bad for the soup
houses of the Bureau aud suggestion advanced that
the able. bodied feeder should be limited But the Gen.
dscamed any power to prevent any man, eoored or
white, from eating all that he chose, always PROVIDED he
could obtain the food. Other freedmen were greatly ex-
eresed because the officers Of the Bureau had srdeod
them not TO give entertainments where dancing was m
dulgcd in. ""vey select too the parties is that we gye
written invitations and only the most respectable people
is invited too. And the Frcedmens Bureau says hatts
not right, and shuts us up


The freedmen seem think that General SteedmaD is
the party that can remedy all their little grievances and
so come him with all manner Of cases 10 be arranged,
and go OF with extremely doubtful countenanee when
he tells them that he has no authority IN tie premises

Rrs0lred that the proceedings of the Eapo-
raj Conference Of the Methodist En;sco',al

adopted satisfactory to both churches which


shall ultimate in their formal union.


Rev. Mr. Barr submitted a minority report
containing his individual objections to the ac-
tiOn Of the majority


Rev. l.. W. Bates fraternal messenger from
Maryland, said that the question created CON
siderable interest III Maryland, but he suggest
ed the proprlety OF avoiding an actual commit
tai OF tins body to the proposed union. Union
might be 4 necessity. There was not a mem-
Der OF the Methodist Protestant Church i'm Ma
ryland who wanted 10 merge their Church into
the Methodist Episcopal, and vet there were
thousands who believed that the time had come
when union would be Il necessity. He said
that the Methodist Protestant Church had ey-
erclSed an important Influence upon her sister
denomination, tending to produce the reform
that Was now bringing the churches closer to-
gcther, aud might result in ultimate union =
But IN Maryland, unlike Virginia, the Mrtho.

button OF ministerial labor and SAID that. with
out this the proposition for union might aS we'll
not be made. And set he deemed il possible
mat an offer might be made that our commits

Methodist Episcopal brethren offer terms that
We can accept We may not refuse them. He

OF the minority report because it declared
uhe4iuvocalIy against all union. He wished
that the proposition had never been made, hut
we should have some better reason for reject
ing 1t than simple refusal to unite on any
terms.


Rev. i. y. Valiant, flatcrnal messenger from

tried Colonel Lynch and Rev. Father Nc
Mahon, arrested at the time of the Fort
Erie raid, convicted them, and sentenced
them to death. Colonel Lynch is man
about sixty-eight years Of age, and AYERS
that he was not combattant at the time,
but was there simply as the correspondent
of the Louisville Journal. The Reverend
Father Mcmahon was there in discharge Of
the duties pertaining to his order. A more
high handed violation of the law of nations
cannot be conceived, and if the sentence is
carried out, lesser stigma than murder
cannot attach to it.


Our Government has sent a letter OF
remonstrance to the British Minister at
Washington, and to the Canadian authori-
ties, but with what result is not of course vet
known. The latest advices are that the
President has promised to protect these vic
tins to British malice but when we reflect
who the President is, we do not feel great
confidence in the fulfillment of the promise
Meanwhile, the Fenans are recruiting men
and donating money throughout the Atlantic
States, and the opinion is rife that another
raid upon the Canadians is close at hand.
Let us hope and pray."

written to Col. Lynch: II regret to tell you
that do not believe you are to be hanged"" /""
He believes that Col. Lynch's execution
would result IN the conquest Of Canada by
the Irish. This is carrying patriotism to an
excess which Col. Lynch will scarcely ap-
preciate. The following Is the letter OF Mr..
Roberts:


NEW YoRk, Nov. 10, 1855.


Sir: Your letter requesting that should
have sent to Washington affidavits Of your
non-military connection with the Irish re-
publican army has been received, and the re-
quest therein complied with, in the case of
Captain Fitzpatrick, and will also write to
Gen. ONeil on the subject. regret to tell
you that do not believe You are to be
hanged. So great crime upon non-com-
batant like yourself and against humanity
q Fenian, and furnish our exchequer with the
necessary means to clear Canada Of English
authority-in short, aconsummation devout-
ly to be wished for; and therefore regret to
tell you that you are not to be hanged. II
would be glorious death for you, and life
that will otherwise pass away unknown, o
few years hence, would become IN honored
portion Of the history Of our race, and Of the
age we live in. But whatever be your fate,
pray God that you will act brave and
dauntless part to the last. Remember that
you will not alone represent your own weak
nature in the position in which you are
placed, but your country and your race also,
and though much regret that you are in
the power Of bloodthirsty foes, l still trust
and hope that under any and all circum.
stances you will make your countrynen
proud Of your name. / remain yours, very
sincerely, WILLIAM II. ROBERTS,


President Of the Fenian Brotherhood.

ton Hall.

THE PRESS EXCLUDED.

WHAT THE CONVENTION DID

SPIRIT OF THE SENATE.",,"The principal excitement in Fenian Circles,
ard indeed in the CITY, yesterday, was the meeting o.
the Convention Of Delegates at Clinton Hall. This
Convention called together by President 0Mahony
some time ago. and was In effect appeal TO all the
Fenians Of the United States to rally around his flag
and oppose the course Of the rebeiOus Senate.


The Senate at first ridiculed the Convention as
thing entirely unconstitutional and coDteuded that
its action whatever it might be, wond have no effect
toward disturbing the position of President Roberts
and his supporters They seemed to treat the whole
thing kind Of farce from which nothing could fow
but fustian resolutions and addresses But at last wlen
the Convention really did meet ana the numbers which
attended it were known TO be very large, even the
Senatorial leaders could not safely derde its Import
ance. 1t became evident that the reticenee OF the
Mahony party during the past few weeks, had meant
something and there no retreat from the fact that
the Convention would exert a powerful influence on
tue Fenian population of the country at large
THE DELEGATES

about fifty passengers in her cabin, and
one hundred on deck; one hundred men
Of Company f., Of the Third United
States Infantry, and mixed crew of ff-
ty men.


The boat reached Napoleon about sun
down, without any symptom Of mishap,
and rounded from the Mississippi into
the Arkansas river, well-controlled by
engineers and pilot, until about seven
miles up from the confluence of the riv,
ers, when the starboard boiler exploded
The cause Of the explosion was unknown
The boat then caught fire, and burned to
the waters edge, carrying to an awful and
untimely end, 225 human beings. The
accident occurred just after tea, and just
as majority of the cabin passengers
were congregated around the stove in the
forward part Of the cabin.

at the thought of being burned, chose to
meet death by suicide and rather than
drown, deliberately blew out their brains
with their rcvolvers 1t is further stated
that two soldiers, who had been tied ur
for disorderly conduct previous to the
explosion, were forgotten and left to per

True. Communication, paper puo-
ished in Baltimore.. We can testify
that it is the prevailing spirit in the
Old Dominion. They are still hold
ing on to the dead carcass Of slavery;


Mr.. EDITOR: You will allow sub
scriber to say a few words through the
columns of, your paper, concerning
the good and loyal citizens OF one OF
our adjoining counties, village bear
ing the initials of A. H., which ranks
among the first class cities Of the far
and sunny South. But for the nara I
tive a gentleman employed by the
Pennsylvania f. R. Association. went
to.the place above mentioned for the
purpose Of establishing school for
the benefit Of colored children. Hay-
ING arrived in town, he repaired to the
best hotel in the place, stationed on
principal thoroughfare of this pleas
ant and beautiful village, and made all
necessary arrangements for board and
lodging, went out in search of some
place to commence his business. Dur
ing his absence the facts Of his inten-
tions were ascertained, and. hence in
dignations Of the landlord, There
fore, upon his return to the hotel, he
was informed by the clerk of this
fashionable place of resort, that he
could not get board there that he
would have to go somewhere else, for
if he intended to put himself on
level with negroes, he was not fit to
be with white folks but as for the
id niggers they did not care q
cent about them, he, might take them
and 60, but that they did not mean to
hare anything to do with any white
man who would condescend to mingle
with the negroes, or who would use
any means to advance their education,
or even promote their moral habits.
My private opinion is, that President
johnson will have matters settled in
hurry if he trusts to such people as
these to do it. Mr.. Editor, how
strange and astonishing it is to see
how ungrateful the Southern whites
are, after enjoying the fruits Of negro
labor for nearly two hundred and fifty
years; they are unwilling that we
should breathe the same air, or tread
the same, soil, upon which we have
been forced to remain and submit to
all their. unkind and inhuman treat
ment, without saying a single word
in defiance This, however, is most
confined to the poorer class, but all
we ask is Education and lawful pro-
lection, and with our efforts and
Northern benevolence, that. will be re-
quired, for our inclination and sus-
capabilities to learning far supercedes
theirs, and cur means of knowledge
are quite abundant, for we have plenty
of schools andt teachers according,
and new schools dre rapidly springing
up through the surrounding country,
besides the Board of Education Of this
place has given us teacher, for which
we are truly grateful The schools
are in progressive condition. We
have children among us who never
knew letter prior to Lee 5 surrender,
who now read very well, and some
few whose emphasis is excellent.

CnfCAGo. November 6.-The following are the
details of a terrible tragedy which took place in
GgdwateF, Mich, ON Saturday, which resulted in
the almost instantaneous death Of George A.
Brag, a law student, and MF5. h6enezer Leach,
by the hands of Ebenezer Leach, husband Of the
lady. About four years ago, Leach separated
from his wife. Incompatibility of temper Wasthe
cause Of their separation. The wife then opened
asmal millinery shop, and to the date other dsath
supported herBelf by its profits. Leach was an
idle worthless fellow and followed the trade OF
carpentering and joining for living.


Though the man had Fenounced the secretly OF
ms wife and had withdrawn from her hI9 pro-
tecton yet he scanned heT actions closely. OF
late ne has continually watched her. Mr.. Geo. Y.

two objects Of his jealensy.


Saturday night the two men above named yvay g
at Mrs. Leach's shop when about to 30 boTae sSha


lived with her father, Mr.. Dougherty, about SaIr
mile distant. She requested them to AZ
1 company her. Brown accepted the invitation
pears, stood in fear of her husband and K vra. n
this account, more than any other, that she re-
quested protection. When the two reached tbe.
Oriental Hotel they were oyertaken BY Leach with
revolver in his hand. He stepped mn ~ LEM
four feet of Brown, aimed the pistol At hin. a5
fired. Before word was uttered he fredat N,s-
Leach, and scarce two minutes had elanaaS frors
the opening of the awful drama til two as IL
principal actors lay on the ground strngeno, n
the last agony of death. -
The discharge Of the pistol aroused the naisy,.-

diately gathered around and the murderer vas

causing almost instant death. Brown received the
fatal missile in the left side; it entered below th

between the seventh and eighth RIBS He was re-


moved to his house, but died within twenty min
utes after being shot The affair took ulaee he
tween 8 and 10 o'clock.


Mrs. Leach was woman Of thirty-four wears
handsome, yirtuous and well educated, She was
never known to have committed anv aet yThicb
could have called down so summary a vengeance


upon her head. She leaves two children. a boy of-
fourteen and girl Of eight years
George O. Brown was young man Of huE
twenty summers, very popular and Industrious

death will be deeply and widely lamelted. He
had lust graduated at Ann Arbor law seho0l hnt

A corener's inquest was held on the bodies ana

been wanting. The product, however, even in
those counties, has been better than was antici-

misrepresentation OF tho Radicals-Thelr


Schemes for the Next Presidency.


The radical dfsorganizers in Congress and
their organs throughout the country are doing
their utmost to create a false impression in re-
gard to President Johnsons course in reference
to restoration. On no one point is this more
marked than on the position of Mr.. Johnson in
regard to the admission Of Southern represen-
tatives in Congress. They are constantly harp
ing upon a statement that the President is try
ing to force Congress to receive late rebels and
secessionists into that body. Their organs are
filed with misrepresentation of this kind, all
tending to create an impression on the public
mind that the President is insisting that the
doors ofthe national Legislature shall be opened
TO the leading sccessionists and the important
trust of the nation placed in their hands and al
their disposal. This is the burden OF
the radical speeches and the song of the
radical editors In this course they
have to . certain extent misled that
portion Of the public who take only super
fetal glance at the policy Of the Executive.
Their frequent reiterations of these false state
ments have had the effect Of convincing many
that they are true. But nothing can be further
from the truth than their assertions about Presi-
dent Johnson's position on the admission OF
those representatives, and none know this
better than the radical leaders. But IL serves

We are informed by w. A. II. Loveland,
that on Monday evening last, while Mrs.
Kenny and lady friend were going to their
home from meeting of the Good Templars
at Golden City. they were brutally assaulted
by q Mexican. knocked down, and otherwise
matreated. 1t is supposed that. failing in
his hellish design, be intended to commit
murder, to cover his crime. Mrs Kenny
struck him several blows with heavy glass
lantern, and finally drove him off. and es-
capped to her home, which is about quarter
of mile from town. The Mexican was
shortly after arrested by the Sheriff. and
placed in the custody of Williams for safe
keeping until morning. During the night
some parties came to the room where he was
confined, took Williams away by force, and
in the morning the Mexican was found hang
ing to an outrageous cottonwood on the
banks of Clear Creek. From the indications
it is supposed that he was first killed at some
distance from the tree, and afterward
dragged t. ere and hung up. Both Mrs.
Kenney and her friend, Miss Ward, were
considerably injured. but not dangerously."

A correspondent of the Detroit Post tells
the following tale Of elopement and baffled
love: ""An elopement almost occurred q few
days ago in the town of Thornapple, near
the village of Hastings, Michigan. A long,
lean, lank specimen of the genus homo-a
regular n.footer-fancying that he had
discovered charms in young lady superior
to those possessed by his wife and family,
made vigorous attack upon the fortress OF
her affections, and carried it by storm. An
attempt to'elope was the natural result. The
two lovers started together on foot, for, no.
body knows where, all the time indulging in
blissful anticipations of future happiness
But, alasl their experience verified the truth
of the old adage, the course of true love
never did run smooth, for the friends of the
young lady, having becoIue advised of the
state of affairs, soon started in pursuit. The
short step and small track of the young lady,
close by the side of the long stride of hei
lover, pointed out Enthusiastically, the direc
ton taken by the fugitives; they were over
taken in the town of Irving, about six milei
from the starting point, and the girl wa'
taken back to the paternal mansion. The
gay lover, when he discovered the pursuit
broke for the woods, where he was subse
quently found in the top of a tree, and cap
tured. A disappointed lover up tree, hi
idol ruthlessly snatched from his embrace
and all his bright anticipations blasted, it i


no wonder that his feelings took religion

Horrible Murder near Medina.-.A Chilli
three years old Beaten to Death BY it,
Father, a CLERGYMAN.",,"| 80. az ~>>ssA~'


lhe Rochester papers contain an account
Of the most thrilling tragedy that has evst
come under our notice-a deed Of which tho
une,nbellisbed statement is sufficient to ,sud
a shudder of horror through any hearer.-
gyman named Lindsey, residing about .
mile south of Medina, whipped bis child, :
boy three years old, so severely that he died
in two hours afterwards-ail, forsootb, be.
cause the poor little martyr could not OF
would not say bis prayers. The statement
made by the Reverend murderer, to Corou.
er's Jury, is this:


On the 18th Of June the child disobevsd
bis stepmother, and commenced correcting
him, using Il shingle for the purpose, and
continued to chastise for more than TWO
hours, when the child began to show signs
of debility, and ceased to punish him. and
laid him Oh a couch, and called my wife,
When she saw the child she said he was dyi
ing, and before l2 o'clock he was dead
The Coroner's jury returned a verdict Wed.
nesday ""lhat death resulted from chaslise:
ment by the father'


We know of nothing to surpass the terri.
bic pathos Of this brief account. Can any
mother read it with unmoistened eyes! How
| plainly one can see the little fellow supplied
under the blows of the remorseless fend--
probably so that he did not know what &as
required of him-and still the father, ac,us.
ted by blind fanatica zeal and perhaps, ha.
tired of the child fostered by the step mother;
continues the Observation-Disclosures save
the mark! Lynch law would be mercy for
the Reverend Mr.. Iindsley. No punishment
this side of the internal regions would do
him justice-we doubt the capabilities Of the
tortures there to ftIy reward him. W.
hope that the law will speedily convict and
send in disgrace from an outraged world
this sauctimonious BRUTE Buffalo Courier

The New York Rochester Union of tie
22d, speaking upon the same subject, SAYS
the account of the whipping 10 death of .
child three years old, by its father a clergy.
man, because it would not say its prayers.
near Medina, published yesterday, awakened
the greatest Indignation of our citizens q.
ganst the inhuman father. The report was
hardly credited, SO unnatural and monstrous
was the crime committed. We blush 10 say
it, but the most sckening and dread full part
OF the unparalleled horror was not published
A/uuo'oy \tudt Nuo IuOuStoT O6m9l
statement before the Coroner's jury, given
yesterday, was corroborated by other wit.
nesses before the jury. The body of the
child told more plainly and psthetically than
words could Of the terrible punishment IL
had undergone. Several Of it's fingers were
broken, and the blood had oozsd from every
pore. TO conceal the crime, the father tied
the little ones hands behind its back and
placed i; in its coffin.


While physicians were making a post
mortem examination of the body, be sat BY:
cooIly looking at the proceedings. After d
time he spoke, and asked them If they bad
not carried this thing about far enoueha' The
physicians discovered no disease about the
chid-it died solely from cruel and exces.
sive punishment. The little one would have
been three years old next August-w whipped
to death because it would not say its prayers.


We are told that Lindsey iustiliss bis
horrid work. lie thinks it was bis duty TO
punish the child until his will was broken
and he obeyed. Lindsey was arrested yes.
terday and commii ed to Jail in Albion. II
was with the utmost difficulty that the off.
GERS who had him in charge could keep The
citizens of Medina and neighborbood from
lynching the murderer on the spot. Linds'
ley is a man about 1--WE feet eight inches in
hight, we'll proportioned, has black whisksrs
and dark complexion.


The murder is the allabsorbing topic Of
Orleans county.

Government Is involved not merely the basty trial
and unjust sentence Of our countrymen, but an in
dignity 10 Indicted on tho whole American nation
through the insult and cruelty heaped upon her
citizens by foreign power; and the question as
sumes importance In proportion not merely to the
condemnation Of few Of her people, but to the
disregard Of American nationality and to the slight
shown regarding the will and ability of this great

Of the President Of the United States, and of the
Secretary Of State In interposing the shield Of na-

thanks Of this meeting; and We trust that the same
bold front and decided stand against British in
humanity and oppression will bs sustained by this
Government to the close Of the present international
imbroglio.

ardent hopsthat out Of all struggles Of Irishmsn,
ultimate liberty and happiness will accrue to Ire

upon all friends Of ireland and others who may be
unwilling to have border warfare carried on in .

quet was thrown to Col 0'Beirne by q lady In tho
audience.


Tho hrst speaker was Mr.. Francis McNerhany,
who said that England took counsel Of her fears and
not Of her love of merces when the lives Of Amer-
can citizens were thus impsrlsd, and they imprs-
oned for crime. Whom that socalled British JUS
tice seeked to wreak its vengeance on American
citizens who committed no crime, 1t was tho duty
Of the Americans to stand up and denounce the out
rage It was the duty Of our Government to stand
American people, and he thanked God we had q
man In the Executive chair who would see to It,
tapplause that neither Of these prisoners In Can.
ada shall suffer tho penalty Of death unless the rec
ord Of their trial shall conclusvsy show that they
had committed an offence which was justly punish.
able by . forfeiture Of life. The American people
would not stand BY with folded arms and witness
the execution Of two Of their citizens guilty Of
crime In this case, as In the case Of Costsr, tho
shield Of the American Constitution would be inter-
and that shield was strong enough to do It. Let
send forth from this the capital city Of this go.
rious Republic, the bold sld fearless declaration
that England shall not, dare not, consummate so
foul, bloody and lnlquit0us deed.


Capt. Gsyce, of Pennsylvania, was the next
speaker. He said he would be false should he not
respond to tho call Of Ihshmen at all times. He
pledged his honor. his life, and all to serve the
Irish people, and be with them in all their efforts
to free Ireland. Never, in the darkest hour Of
American history, had the Irish people failed to be
true to our country and our proved this
fact.


Gen. II. II. Heath, of Nebraska, was next intro
duood, and said: He was here tonight as an Amer.
loan citizen to minge his proteststions with those
Of the Irish citizens against the contamination oi
such an outrage by England. The speaker said
were he President Of the United States he would
take 1t for granted that those freemen had been en-
gagged In war against England, and yet he would
say to England, ""You shall not execute those
men"" It was enough for him to know they were
American citizens, and under our broad shield they
were free. American freemen should try American
frsemen, and not bloated British judges who knew
nothing Of law.


1t had pleased the Almighty to place in the Ex
ecutivs chair Of this nation man who loved and
appreciated liberty. Both he and the honored SEQ.
rotary of State had addressed to the British Gov.
srnment q paper which was stronger than ten mil

races, says the Lynchburg (Va.) Republican,
in letter written by the Hon. +. w. Pick
ems of South Carolina. AS some people
profess to find it difficult to make the doc
trine OF distinct races barmonize with the
Mosaic account of creation, we present this
for their consideration. It has not been
many years since 1t was almost the universal
belief of Christendom that this physical
globe Of ours was only about six thousand
years old according to the bible, and any
belief to the contrary was considered infdel,
ity But no educated theologian or gentle
man now pretends to deny that the globe is
Of an indefinite age-perhaps millions of
years and that there is nothing in the bible
that conflicts with the progressive deyelop-
ments of geology or physical science May
it not be that similar conclusion will be
reached at no distant day in regard to the
plurality Of races, and that, in the lights of
progressive knowledge, there may be found
to be nothing in the Bible to conflict with
She idea that the negro and the white man
are two distinct creations, and never can be
equals, morally, mentally or physically


MIR. Pickens says: The two races are en-.





contents of negro's skull of the same size
as white mans weigh many ounces less,
showing more specific gravity in the latter
The brain of negro man is n OF so condens-
ed or soldified as that of white man. The
brain of white boy of l3 is more condeus-
ed, more solid, than that of negro man 2G
years old. The hair of negro is a shaft,
with outside scales containing the coloring
matter, and Is, in fact, wool; whereas, the
hair OF the whiteman is a cylindrical tube,
and the colorng matter is the fluid of this
tube. No mixture of the races can ever
amagamate the formation of the hair. The
mu!atto has the cylindrical tube alone, or
the shaft without change. The atlas of the
vertebral column in negro man enters the
head one inch further back than it does in
a white man, making the head of the latter
work more on balance and erect, while
the head of the former has a tendency to
drop or hang down. The nasal angle in the
negro is far more acute than in the white
man, showing its approaches to the nasal
angle in the brute creation. The bone from
the knee joint to the ankle joint in negro
of the same height with white man, is one
inch and quarter shorter than in the white
man, showing his power to rise with weights
The arm, also, from the shoulder to the el
bow is shorter in the negro than in the
white man. The toe of the negro is longer
and more of heel behind his ankle. He also
secretes more through the glands of the
skin, and the white man more through the
kidneys. There are far more glands near
the skin in the negro, and hence bis capaci'
ty to throw off the heat; and its diffusion is
greater, and hence the general odor of body;
whereas the white man secretes more through
the kidneys and does not throw off heat so
readily, but is more easily depressed for con-
gestion. The races never amalgamate per.
manently, for after the fifth generation the
hybrid mixture runs out and is lost. Quad
rooms are mostly barren, or have but few
children, and they are generally week.
Their power for production with white
man soon loses itself, but if interningled
with the black man, or even mulatto, the
race grows more vigorous and numerous and
will come back to the black race in few
generations. But for this there would have
been more anal gamation in our cities and
villages than there has in 200 years. The
races in the rural districts are far more re.
pugnant, because there is there a higher
tone of morality. Northern men and for
eigners settle in the cities and towns, who
are not acquainted with the distinct charac
teristicts Of the races, and have no instinc,
tive prejudice against licentious amaIgama-
ton. The truth is, the two races were crea-
ted at different periods and for different pur'
poses, as is distinctly declared 10 The first
and second chapters of Genesis. In the
first chapter, after a particular account is
given of the dif1ernt creations made on the
first days or periods Of time, then on the
sixth, in the Goth verse, it is declared, ""And
God said let us make man; so God created
man in his own image, male and female
reated be them."" 9th verse-""Apd God
blessed them, and said be fruitful and multi
ply"" And God said, ""Behold have given
you herbs bearing seed, and every tree in
which is the fruit Of tree yielding seed, to
you it shall be for meat"" 3Oth versa--""And
God saw everything He had made, and be
hold it was very good, and the evening and
the morning were the sixth day."" This
closed the work of six days creation, but it
is not to be inferred that these days were
ouAJ 'no icoSeh VI ouA P1oSonI uoJS, uoCouoo
it says ""the evening and the morning were
the first day, etc. 1t was not measured by
the rising or the setting of the sun, for the
sun itself was not created until the fourth
day. 18th verse, lst chapter-""And there
had been three days of creation before the
sun and moon were created at all, even the
solid land and the water were made
before there was any SUM-"" There certainly
then was some other measure Of day, and
the plain conclusion 10 that it was an era,
period for gradual formation, rather than
what is commonly supposed to be only the
ordinary day as measured by the sun. AT
ter this six days work was finished, i! is dis
tinctly stated that ""God rested on the sew
enth day from all his works which be had
made""-2d verse, I'd chapter After the
seventh day, the Sabbath of rest, it is said in
the 5th verse Of the I'd chapter, ""The Lord

THE BALL OF TEE FEN1AN BRoTHEREoop-
Many years and oft we have been at joyous
gatherings in the great festive rendezvous Of the
Crescent city-the ODD Fellows Hail. In the old
times, the gay and festive and gallant members of
the Washington Artillery were wont to bring to-
gether the elite of the city of New Orleans
And SO, also, in eminent style did that
glorious organization, the Continentals, and
that other one, under the auspices of the 'young
mem, against whose management no reproach
was ever uttered. We were on hand at all of
these and many another one, but we must
confess that we hardly ever enjoyed our
selves more than we did at the ball
of the Fenan brotherhood. When we say
that the ball was crowded, we poorly express our
idea in regard to the attendance. Our Odd Eel
lows Hall is one of the most spacious ball rooms
in the country, but it did not begin to ac-
commodate all who desired to participate
in the gay doings night before last. However, we
do not wonder at the grand turn out on this occa-
sion. The spirit and patriotism of our citizens of
Irish birth descent were called into action, and
the result was worthy of these noble sentiments.
The ball, besides being graced with the lovelest
and restrepresentatives of those who admire aud
sustain the brotherhood, was ornamented with the
| glorious symbol of Irish nationality, the green
| flag, with the sunburst upon it.


The State government was represented at the ball
| by his Excellency Gov. J. Madison Wells. The city
government was represented by one of its prom
| IneOt members. q ont
B. L. Lynch Esq, ex-Attorney General of the
State, and many other gentlemen distinguished
either by position, personal worth or by past
glorious record in the latter days that tried men 8
souls.


The managers of the ball deserve the most


unstnted praise for the admirable order preserved


throughout and their attention to their numerous


guests. Long may they wave, say we.

| MIsINFoRMEp.-In our report of the private meet
ing of persons claiming to have been original
Unionists, at the City Hall, on Thursday night,
| from information received, we attributed to Mr..
Cooley certain profanity in his remarks, which
that gentleman informs US was misrepresenta-
| ton. Having been excluded from the meeting,
we were necessarily dependent upon others for in
formation as to its proceedings, and the misrepre-
sentaton is owing to the exclusive character of


that political assembly, and not to any disposition


on the part of the reporter of the CRESCENT to do


injustice to Mr., Cooley or any other citizen.

of the charges against Sam Green, Nelson, Plum


mer and other colored men as principals, and Ed.

self as Plummer's wife, said that she had received
| the album a present. Witness found the other
| coat in the kitchen. Witness found the watch in
court at Mr.. Leon's, corner Of Basin and Bienvlle

Gen. John Armstrong testified that on the morn
ing of the 26th Of January his house was entered
by breaking open the shutters of his dining room


A gold watch, belonging to his wife, and two
\ doubloons, were taken from his own pocket. The
thieves then went into an adjoining room, and one
| of them applied chloroform to q lady but she
awoke and gave the alarm. One of the burglars
| ran down stairs, and dropped bundle of clothing.
! Mr. James Brennan testified that his house was
entered in the early part of January, through the
back parlor window. The burglars took every
thing away that could be easily carried. The
| overcoat in Court belongs to witness, and was
| stolen that night from his house.


Mr. John II. Jlsley testified that he awoke be-
| tween four and five o'clock in the morning and
found his house all open. He discovered that all
his clothing had been taken away. Witness went

lett them burning. They eat bread and meat,
drank milk and whisky, and smoked up nearly a
hundred cigars; In approaching the house, they
walked on the flower beds, so as not to make any
noise.


Mr. O. Valeton testified that on the morning of
the 4th of February, he found his door open, and
check and an album missing. The album in court
was the one missing, to the best of witness knowlf
edge The pictures in it now were not in it whe1

all the revolutionists are committed to
this wild scheme, calculated to pro
duce anarchy and confusion in the
South, and overthrow the present form
of government. The New York World,
a leading Democratic paper of the
North, does not, however, look upon
this measure as of any great impor.
tance 1t thinks we should feel neither
terror nor depression at the growing
favor with which it is received by the
Republican party, for it proves that
the Republican leaders despair of get
ting their heels on the necks of the


Southern people by any other method
They perceive that there is no other
way to get control of the suffrage and
introduce the negroes to the ballot
box; no other way to carry such
amendments as they wish to engraft
upon the Constitution; no other way
to subject the domestic concerns of the
South to federal control Turn and
squirm as they may, they cannot es-
cape the ugly fact that thirteen States
stand like an immovable barrier against
every amendment to the Constitution
which the Radicals wish to have
adopted; that the number of States
must rise to fiftytwo to over
come this opposition and that that
number will not be reached in this
century, if ever Hence we see efforts
already begun in both Houses of Con
gress for degrading those States into
Territories, and the Republican press
everywhere wheeling into line to march
in this movement.


Our friend of the World thinks we
should take courage at this practical
confession of Radical weakness. and
declares it cannot succeed and its
failure will perhaps weaken and de
moralize and divide the party. This is
a very happy view to take of it, but
we tell you, Mr.. World, that the ac
ton of Congress is having telling
effect upon business down this way
1t is paralyzing commerce, checking
labor on the farms, and causing thou
sands of people to seek homes in other
countries.

DOUBTS OF REV. Mr.. LUM8DEN'S CONVICTION",,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 28.-The secretary of state
has addressed letter to Sir Frederick Bruce in
behalf of James Lynch and John Mcmahon, re-
Gently convicted in colonial court in Canada and
sentenced to death upon charge that, being
citizens of the United States, they were actors in
the assault made in the month Of June last at Fort
Erie, in that colony.


The secretary says the United States consul at
Toronto has been instructed to procure for the
information of the government a copy of the
record of the trial and conviction of Lynch and
McMahon, and also of all further trials and con
yictions of a similar character which shall take
place in Canada The secretary says:


""The President directs me to assure you of his
confident hope that her majesty's government will
not only cheerfully comply with the request thus
made, but that they will think it proper also to
examine the judicial proceedings aforesaid with
careful regard to the rights of the United States
and to the maintenance of the good relations be-
tween the two countries. For this reason 1t VIII
be very gratifying to the President if you should
be able to give me an assurance that the eGecu

AN ENGLIsHMRN IN HAYTI.",,"Daily Ne1gS portions OF letter written
to that journal by Mr.. Henry Yates
Thompson, a gentleman known in this
country as the author Of proposition to
establish an American lectureship at the
University of Cambridge in England.
Mr.. T. has lately visited Jamaica and
Hayti, on his way to this country. He

to the opinion that the capacity OF men

have made the acquaintance in this insig-
nfcant town Jacmel of a mert hant who,
as far as color goes, is entirely, or al
most entirely, of African origin, who in
manners and conversation might orna
mcnt any drawingroom in Liverpool or
London. This man talks French and
English not sensibly and dramatically
only, but with the accent and ease of a
perfect gentleman. He has travelled,





life at least as long as that of his country !;
and prepared as | was, and as | suppose
all Englishmen are, to acknowledge the
capacity Of the African races for improve
ment, | own that it has been a surprise
to me to find, not from this instance only,
but from many instances both here and
at Port-au-Prince, that they have already
advanced so far""


We hope that when Mr.. Thompson
reaches our county, he will not fail to
place himself under the chaperonship
of some person Of African or semi African
origin, at convenient opportunities. in
order that he may again be surprised at
our advancement. We will undertake to-
convince him that it is by no means an
uncommon thing for such men to "" talk
French and English sensibly and gram
matically. 1t is fact that they acquire
languages with pc ,ular facility and we
have met with many colored persons
whose acquisitions as linguists were so
respectable that they conld converse flu
emily in from two to six different tongues.
One of the persons alluded to was a cook on
on steamboat we'll acquainted with Eng
liSh, French, Spanish, Danish, Swedish,
Portuguese, and German, and whom we
have frequently heard when engaged in an
mated conversation with natives Anoth-
er, a colored girl in st. Louis, could con
verse readily in four different languages.

es during his stay in our country, he will
probably hear logical and perhaps an
abstruse discourse, preluded by an oven
ture from Bach or Sphor, and followed
by an anthem fIom Handel, Mozart or
Beethoven.


The fact of the business, Mr. Thomp-
son, is, that we Africans and semi
Africans are good deal more like peo

deal more than many are willing to admit ,
and while it is true that we have vast

true that we have a very respec table"

 ""The account of the whipping to death of child three years old by its father, a clergyman, because it would not say it's prayers, near Medina, published yesterday, awakened the greatest indignation of our citizens against the inhuman father. The report was hardly credited, so unnatural and monstrous was the crime committed. We blush to say it, but the most sickening and dreadful part of unparalleled horror was not published. Lindley's Chats the minister's name) statement before the cor oner's jury, given yesterday, was corrobo- rated by other witnesses before the jury. The body of the child told more plainly and pathetically than words of the terrible punishment it had undergone. Several fingers were broken and blood had oozed from every pore. To conceal the crime the father had tied the little one's hands behind its back and placed it in its coffin. While the physicians were making a post mortem examination of the body, he sat by, lcooly looking at the proceedings Af ter while he spoke and asked if they had not carried this thing about far enough The physicians discovered no disease about the child it died solely from excessive and cruel punishment. The little one would have been three years old next August whipped to death because it would not say it's prayers We are told that Lindsley justified his work He thinks it was his duty to punish the child until his will was broken, and he obeyed. Lindsley was ar rested yesterday and committed to jail in Albion. It was with the utmost difficulty that the officers who had him in charge could keep the citizens of Medina and neighborhood from lynching the murderer on the spot Lindsley is man about five feet eight inches in night, we'll proportion ed has black whiskers and dark complex ion. He has the appearance of man oi violent temper. The murder is the all absorbing topic of Orleans county -[Av alanche."

 This negro is from Ohio. During the year 1868 he enlisted in Sherman's army and was with him in his march from Atlanta to Colum- bia, South Carolina, where he says he found one hundred thousand dollars. After the burning of Columbia he was transferred to East Tennessee, and was with Gen, Burbridge in his attack on the Virginia Salt Works. Here he was captured by the Confederate for ces and carried to Lynchburg, where he was sold to farmer named Giles, living in Rock bridge county, and lived there until the 9th of October, 1865. On that day Mfr. Giles said something to the negro which so enraged him that he struck Mir. G. on the head with Q staye, killing him instantly. The negro next went to the house, took all the valuables he could find, and then set fire to it, burning up the wife of Mr. Giles, who was in an upper room asleep. He was arrested few days after, tried before military commission and sen- tenced to be hung on the 5th of May. He was brought to this city and confined in the Libby, and every preparation made for his execution, but, he being ''ward of the nation,"" re- prieve was granted him. He is still in close confinement, and we hope soon to have the pleasure of recording hanging in which he will be deeply interested. He admits having killed the man, but denies firing the house. or in any way being concerned in the death of ] the lady. M o1 i"

as to bring himself almost directly over the

getting warm to his work, and was about to
pronounce the words, "" I baptize thee in the
name.n ETC., the branch on which the jew
was sitting broke off suddenly, dropping him
squarely on the back of lady of rather
ample proportions. scattering her all over the
ground promiscuously. Medical aid restored
her, however, but not before twenty minutes

nate wight, who was the cause of this mis-
hap, and who was the innocent instrument
of transforming a solemn and interesting
ceremony into a comical farce, was forced to
flee for his dear life, as the exasperated
friends of the lady hunted all through the
woods in quest of him so as to give him a
taste of Judge Lynch's recipe. 1t was un-
necessary for the minister to wet his fingers,
as the accident threw a sufficient amount of
cold water over the child as well as the whole
affair to answer all baptismal purposes

THE JURY RETIRE.


The jury retired at ten minutes past four,
and the Crown officers not being willing to
commence any other trial, at that advanced
hoar, business was suspended, and his Lord
ship, the counsel and the public awaited the
return of the jury for an hour and twenty
five minutes. The Court remained crowded
during the entire period, scarcely any one
moving from their places, as the jury might
come in at any moment. During the interval
the prisoner, like the rest, chatted freely with
his counsel, the Sheriff and some others who
went to the dock to converse with him.


THE VERDICT.


At twenty five minutes to six the jury
returned into Court, and the roll being called
by the Clerk, he inquired d-Gentlemen of the
jury, have you agreed upon your verdict?


The Foreman-The jury have come to the
conclusion that the prisoner Is guilty.


The Clerk having recorded the verdict,


The Solicitor General rose and said : -

on the prisoner""


His Lordship-Robert B. Lynch, have you
anything to say why the sentence OF the Court
should not be pronounced on you for this
felony?

tunty of urging any legal objections, if you
had them. 1t ia too late now to discuss the
facts of the case.


Prisoner-Well, my lord, you must be
aware, with regard to legal objections, that
am not cognzant enough of law to make any.
| only know that | am innocent of the crime
charged against me. and of which have been
found guilty. And | here pledge myself

The Court then made the usual proclama
tion, prior to passing sentence of death.


SENTENCE OF DEATH.


His lordship, addressing the prisoner, said:


am very sorry to find man of your age
and experience stand where you do to-day.
You are a man who must have seen good
deal of the world-a man not without educa-
tion and intelligence. The evidence brought
before the Court is perfectly clear and con-





reporter on the occasions charged in the in
dictment; but that you were armed and in
some kind of command. What that was does
not distinctly appear. But even though you
were there only as a reporter. you ought to
have known that no war had been proclaim
ed that those men with whom you were
seen were making an atrocious, almost un-
paralleled, inroad on a peaceful country, and
that under the circumstances you were there
to report the ravages of these men to others
interested, in order that they might gloat and
glory over the slain. While single word
would have influenced the case to your pre-
judice, | carefully abstained from saying any
thing against you. But now it does not lie
on me to extenuate your fault, or affect not to
see it in its darkest light. You professed
with others, to redress the grievances of cen
turies-to right the wrongs of an oppressed
people-and TO remove the iron heel which
you say the Saxon put on the Celt centuries
ago; and yet you began by inheting on us
the very injuries of which you complained -
Why should your iron tread be forced on US :?
Why should our homes be desolated and our
young men be slain by you? Will any man
of sense answer this plain question? Was it
less than murder for you to come here in the
dead of night to ravage our country and slay
our people! Ana all TINS was done under
color of relieving Ireland Could any right
you may have authorize you to commit such
wrong as you then perpetrated? This is
putting your case in very plain and clear
light You stand here surrounded by the
friends and relatives of the men you slew on
that occasion. If you were there as reporter
even, you were not guitless. Your object
was to encourage others to come if these men
had been successful or keep them away if
the reverse had happened. Looking at your
conduct in that light, you cannot be surprised
that the law should be enforced and that you
should suffer the dread penalty of that law
as | very much fear you will-for how could
we punish the young reckless and unthink-
ing young men to be brought here for trial
who followed such you, and placed conf
dence in you, if you were to be allowed to
escape? Could you see any justice in pun
ishing them in such case? You complain
unjustly that those who were in command on
that occasion were not allowed to come here
to give testimony in your behalf. But l
cannot pervert the law, and the Crown can
not over ride it. If the Crown had given any
such pledge of safe conduct as had been
spoken of, it could not be carried out. You
have had all the justice you could possibly
get, and had every advantage of the forms of
law. Every one also abstained from urging
too hardly against you that which might have
been urged But would fail 10 my duty
now if | did not put your crime in its true

of murder was progressing at Hagcrstown.
similar work was going on at Westmin-
ster, Carroll county. showing similarity
os purpose and intention to pervade that
party through the State. There, as here,
we presume the matter will be hushe up
and passed by without the guilty party
ever being brought to justice.


On that day there was very large mass
meeting of the Conservative voters of Car
roll county. held at Westminster
Addresses were delivered by Colonel
Maulsby, Gen. Helm. Gov. Parsons and
others. There was quite serious affair
in the afternoon growing out of the shoot
ing. and We believe slightly wounding, of
four persons by man named Henry Bell


This Bell was the ringleader of the par
ty of FIVE miserable wretches who brutally
murdered in his bed Joseph Shaw, editor
of the Carroll Democrat, because after his
Office was destroyed. he would not leave
the place. The trial attendant upon this
affair is still too fresh in the minds Of our
readers to be recalled now. All can re-
member how, with corrupt partisan Judge
a low drunken District Attorney, whose
very presence is q disgrace to that commu-
nifty, and suborned Jury. those FIVE mis-
creants were allowed to go free, amid the
plaudits of an admiring crew.


Judge Lynch came near holding cour,
last Saturday however; when the news Of
the shooting spread an excited crowd rush
ed to the Jail where the Sheriff had locked
Bell up for protection, and dem loi en-
trance. which being refused they forced
open the door. The Sheriff here inter.
fered. and by expostulstion good counsel
prevailed, and the masses dispersed. AL.
though this murderer is allowed to 90 still
little longer unpunished for his crimes, il
is matter of songra tulation to know that
the people of Carroll county show a de.
termination to put down the Williams who
for so long time have disgraced her fair
name. One year ago such men as Bell
could order the best citizens of that county
from their homes, and the order was al
ways attended with threat that none dar,
disobey. The days of the Vigilance Com
mittec are over we are pretty sure."

Il bases this estimate on various considera- fions and adyices, including decided in crease of energy aud productive industry among the poor whites of the upland re gions of Alabama and other States. It is aware that the war has cahsed much ruin aud poverty. but says the South is devoted 10 cotton as itnever was before-has a great many negroes and some whites hard at work ia. the cotton feld-nRds hopes for crop of 2,50eeV0 bales.

BOARD or Police CommtsaEoncrg.. =",,"The regular weekly meeting of the Board Of
Police Commissioners was held last evening
present. Messrs. Conway, Lynch, Moore and
| 5oul6 Mayor Monroe presiding
Charges Against several members Of the police
were read and fixed for trial.
Mr. Moore intr0duceda resolution intending that
policemen required to appear as witnesses before
the board, should not lose pay during their at
tendance.


MI. Soul5 suggested that the board had no CON
trol of the matter. The action of the board could
only be advisory, Or presented in the form of a
recommendation The finance committee or the
council only could act effectively on the subject.


Mr.. Conway submitted that the proper course
for the board would be to address request to the
finance committee to take into consideration the
subject matter of the resolution. 1t was SO OBJ
Fiousy unjust that police officers, compelled TO
attend Che meetings of the board as witnesses,
should lose their days pay, that to request the
attention of the committee to the subject would
suffice.


The president remarked that in the police
arrangements this matter had already been
attended to. The meetings Of the board we're
held at night. Night officers, therefore, only
could lose time. Instructions had been given and
were carried out shat, whenever a night officer
was required to be present at q meeting Of the
board, all he had 10 do was to report the fact to
lis superior in immediate command, and he was
reported as on duty.


Mr.. Moore said his only object was to endeavpr
to prevent an injustice, and the explanation of"

The speaker proceeded in humorous
manner to describe the different kinds Of
advertisements adopted by different people.
Some people may say that they could never
do this dasbing style Of advertising for the
community would call them humbugs.
Well, what then! Mr.. Barnum had known
men who lived through that. Laughter.
HumbuCging simply consists in putting on
glittering exteriors to suddenly arrest public
attention. The great English blackiug ma
ker once sent bis agents to Egypt to print
on the pyramids the words. TRY Warrens
Blacking. 80 Strand, London"" lie was
hnmbugging the tourist who saw it, but it
was not cheat, for the article WAS a good
one. The English who read it were indig-
nant at the sacriIege, and like al Englshmen
do, or threaten to do. they wrote to the Times.
What was the consequence? The letters
were copied everywhere, SO that all through
the country the papers teemed with the AZ
vice. ""'rry Warren's Backing"" and the
maker thereof made his fortune.


When Jenny Lind first sang in America
tickets were sold at auction. One enlerprs
ing trademan outbid the aristocrats and took
the first ticket at $3.50. As the result of
this Act the name Of ""Genin, the hat'er,""
WAS spread all over the country, and every
man looked to see if he did not wear a
'Geuin hat"" That man also made his for,
tune by his ingenuity.


The speaker said he himself had been
spoken Of as one Of the most notable hum.
bugs Ct the day. In his acceptaton of the
term, he did not deny it. He had for many
years been sending up little skyrocke,s, all
intended to attract the popular eye. Twen-
ty-two years ago he took the American
Museum for song, for it bad been losing
money. lie determined to spend all the
money he made the first year, in advertising.
lie placed advertisements in the papers,
covered walls with flags and hand bills, and
did everything he could to attract the popu.
lar eye. One day he employed artists to
cover his museum outside with pictures of
about every animal that ever lived, and
about half dozen thrown in that had never
existed.


As consequence Of the advertisements,
he soon saw the people crowdng into his
patronage than he could accommodate,
Men should be careful in their business that
thav have g guuu si.,o
verlise it, for the greater the number Of peo-
pie who know Of the existence Of The genu-
inc article the better it is for the owner.
The ways of advertising may be different,
but always the public should be made aware
of the article which the advertiser has for
sale. Advertising must be persisted in
The nail must be hammered well iu and
then cinched. A French writer has we'll
said that the first time an advertisement is
inserted man doesn't see it; the second
time he does not read it, the third time he
reads il but does not think of it; the fourth
time he thinks about il; the ffh time he
speaks to bis wife about il. and the sixth or
seventh time be was ready to purchase.
This man will be found to bs nearly correct,
and man must remember that il be doesn't
advertise his goods the sheriff will advertise
them for him; in this case it is better to act
personally than by proxy.


CALCULATING THE HoRsE- Power OF EN-.
oINEs.-In the English accounts Of condens-
ing steam engines-more especially those
for marine purposes-and their power, we
generally see statements of the nominal
horse power and actual horsepower: the
actual power being always several times
greater than the nominal. The actual horse
power is calculated from the record of the
indicator; but the nominal is estimated BY
an arbitrary rule. which is explained as fol
lows in letter to Engineering, from John
Bourne, the we'll known engineer and author:


In Boulton and Watts original rule for
determining the nominal power of an en-
gine, the pressure Of the steam which was
considered to be effective on the piston was
6.S lbs, in the horse power engine, and in
creased up to 694 lbs. in the 100 horse
power engine. The vsloci,ies of piston for
different lengths of stroke were taken as
follows;


Length Of stroke


inf in r.; !, 1851 ,;;.; ""a 81 Sc


it. per minutcl6O ITO lsO l79 200 2l5 22s 245 256


The pressure speed per minute multiplied
BY the assumed pressure, and divided by
$4,000. gave the nom;oal power.


As it was difficult to remember these
speeds aud pressures, gave new rule in
ls46, which assumed uniform pressure Of
seven pounds por square inch, and which
further assumed that the speeds varied near
ly as the cube roots Of the length Of the
stroke, which found that they did very
nearly This rule, which is now very gen.
orally adopted, is as follows: Multiply the
square Of the diameter Of the cylinder in in
ches by the cube root of the length Of the
stroke in feet, and divide the product BY Al,
which will give the nominal power.

 ""U 5 GRANT. Lieutenant General.

 Major General II w Halleck."" General Hunter immediately took up the of. fensive. and moving up the Sbenand ,ah valley, met the enemy on the 5th of June at Piedmont, and after battle of ten hours, routed and de. feated him. capturing on inc field of battle l,500 men, pieces of artillery, and 300 stand of small arms. On the Sth of the s,nne month he formed junction with Crook and Averill at Staunton. from which place he moved direct on Lynchburg, via Lexington, which place he reached and invested.on the l6ih day of June. Up to this time he was very successful, and but for the difficulty of taking with him sufficient ordnance stores, over so long march, through a hostile country, he would no doubt have cap. tured that, to the energy. important point. The destruction of the enemy's supplies and manu. factories was very great. To meet tbis move. ment under General Hunter, General Lee sent a force, perhaps equal to corps, part of which reached Lynchburg a short time before Hunter. After some skirmishing on the l7th and lstb, General Hunter, owing to want of ammunition to give battle, retired from before the place. Unfortunately this want of ammu. milton left him no choice of route orhis return but by way of Kanawha. This lost to us the nse of his troops for several weeks, from she defence ofahe north .is,i ss ik

 ing the day, but failed. The a was spent in

 getting troops into position for an attack on the 3d. On the sd of June, we again assaulted

 the enemys works, in the hope of driving him

 from his position. In this attemptour loss was

 heavy. while that of the enemy,I have reason s, 10 belsre vas comparatively light. It was the Ionly general attack made from the Rapidan to the James, which did not inflict upon the enc.

 my losses to compensate for our own losses =

 I would not be understood as saying that all

 previous attacks resulted in victories to cur

 arms, or accomplished as much as had hoped

 from them; but they inflicted upon the enemy

 severe losses, which tended in the end, to the

 complete overthrow of the rebellion. Fromths proximity of the enemy to his de. fences around Richmond, it was impossible by any flank movement to interpose between him

 and the city. was still in condition to eith-

 CT move by his left flank and invest Richmond

 from the north side. or continue any move by

 his right flank to tbe south side of the James.

 While the former might have been as cover

 ing for Washington, yet full survey of all the

 ground satisfied me that it would be impracti. cable to hold line north and east of Rich-

 moad that would protect the Fredericksburg railroad-a long. vulnerable line. which would exhaust much of our strength to guard, and

 that would have to be protected to supply tn e army. and would leave opea to the enemy all his lines of communication on the south side of the James. My idea. from the start, had been to beat Lees army north of Richmond, if possible, Then. after destroying his lines of communication north of the James river, to transfer the army to the south side and besiege Lee in Richmond, or follow him south if he should retreat. After the battle of the Will. ldernessit was evident that the enemy deemed it of the 6rst importance to run no risks. with the army he then had. He acted purely on the defensive behind breastworks, or f.ebly on the offensive immediately in front of them, and where, iG casa of repulss, he could easily retire behind them. Without greater sacrifice of iifs than was willing to make. all could not be accomplished tkat-I had designed north of

 Richmond. therefore determined to continue to hold substantially the ground we. then occu- pied, taking advantage of any favorable circum- stances that might presen themselves until the cavalry could be sent to Charlottesville and Gordonsville, to efsctually break up the rail- road communication between Richmond and the Shenandoah valley and Lynchburg and when fhs cavalry got we'll of. to move the at my to the south of the James river. by the ene- my's right flank, where felt could cut of all his sources ofsupply except by the canal.

 F On the 7th. two divisions of cavalry, under General Sheridan. get of on the expedition against the Virginia Central Railroad, with n- structioDs to Hunter. whom l hoped he would meet near Charlottesville, to join his forces to -sheridan's, and after the work laid ont for them vas thoroughly done. to join the army of the Potomac by the route laid down in sheridau's instructions.

 On the 10th of June General Butler sent a force of infantry under General GiIImore. and cavalry under General Kauiz, to capture Ps- 'tersburg if possible, and destroy the railroad and common bridges across the Appomattox The cavalry carried the works on the south side, and penetrated well in towards the town. but were forced to retire. General Gilmore, find ing the works which he approached very strong. and deeming an assault impracticable, returned to Bermuda Hundred without attempting one d.JAttaching great importance to the possess ion of Petersbure, T sent back to Bermuda Hun Idred and City Point General Smith s command by water, via White House, to reach there in badvaoce of the army of the Potomac. This

 was for the express purpose of securing Peters burg before the enemy, becoming aware of our intention, could re-enforce the place.

 1.-The movement from Cold Harbor commenc- ed after dark on the evening of the l2th, one. division of cavalry. under General "" ilson. and thel5th corps. crossed the Chickahominy at

 Long Bridge, and moved out to White Oak Swamp, to cover the crossing ofthe other corps. The advance corps reached James river at Will COTS landing and Charles City Court House, on the night of the 18th.

 During three long years the armies ot the Potomac and northern Virginia had been con. fronting each other. h that time they had fought more desperate battles than it probably

appalling colors, that in comparison hell
itself might be considered beautiful; he
painted the slanderer SO black that the sun
seemed dark at MONDAY, when shining on
such an accursed monster; and then fixing
both portraits on the shrinking Hopkins,
fastening them there forever. The agita-
ton of the audience nearly amounted to
madness. q g.s.I'' l..aaaa ~ 'ayu...


All at once the speaker decended from
the perilous height His voice walled out
for the murdered dead and the living-the
beautiful Mary, more beautiful evera mo-
ment as her tears flowed faster, till men
wept and sobbed like children. ,....,.,


He closed by o strange exhortation to
the jury, and through them to the by-stand-
ers; he advised the panel that after they
shoulc bring in verdict for the plaintiff,
not to offer violence to the defendant, how
ever richly he may deserve It; in other
words, ""not to lynch the villain, but to
leave his punishment to God"" This was
the most artful trick of all, and best cal
culated to insure violence.


The jury returned verdict of fifty
thousand dollars; and the next night Hop
kins was taken out of bed by lynchers,
and beaten almost to death. AS the court
adjourned the stranger said. ""John Tay-
lor will preach here at early candle-light.""
And he did preach-and the house was
crowded. I hsve listened to Clay, Web
ster and Calhoun-to Dwight, Bascom and
Beecher-but never heard anything in the
form of sublime words, even remotely ap-
proximate to the eloquence of John Iay-
lor, massive as mountain, and wildly
rushing. as a cataract of fire. ,...r-..' p"

from several simultaneous attempts to burn the


place. A vigilance committee was formed, and


matters looked as if extreme measures would


have to be resorted to before quiet could be


resiored-the hanging Of the incendiaries being


among the remedies proposed.


Titusviile, although comparatively a new
| place, is prosperous borough of some ten
thousand inhabitants Being the centre or hub
of the great oil region of Western Pennsylvania,
| it has during the oil excitement been a resort
| for many adventurers of different classes in
cluding unprincipled spectators, gamblers,
highwaymen, horse thieves, and all those aban-


doned creatures who rush to places where sud


denly acquired wealth makes people profigate.
| II was the same with California in its carly


days. 1t was so with the rich mining regions


of Nevada, Idaho, Colorado and other gold and


silver producing countries, including Australia.
| Many thousands of people focked 10 those re-
| gions under the glttering infatuation that they


would quickly realize fortunes; but they were
| doomed to disappointment Then followed


dependency, then recklessness, then drunken


ness, all ending in crime This class of people
Joined their fortunes with those naturally de-
praved and only survived in an atmosphere of


villany. United they became powerful band


Of marauders. They robbed, burned, murder


ed and destroyed as they liked. The arm Of
the law was not sufficiently powerful to protect


the honest citizen, miner or trader; hence the


latter had to provide for selEprotcction. They
formed what they called vigilance committees,
and summary and condign was the punishment
inflicted upon the assassins and plunderers.
Many were hanged without mercy, and others
were banished the country, never to return under
penalty ofdeath. II must be rcmea- bered that
these scenes occurred in an entirely new coun-
try. where laws were almost unknown, or, IL
known, generally UNDECIDED Therefore, if
vigilance committees or any other unlawful


assumption OF the civil power could ever be


justified, California and other new gold coun-
tries might possibly furnish examples.


But how is IL with the oil regions Of Penn
sylvania! No doubt vast amount Of money
has found It's way there, as high a sum as fifty


millions OF dollars. it is said, having been re-


ceived in Venango county alone du. ing the oil


excitement a year ago. 1t is equally probable





found its way from there, and been expended
in extravaganza and high living in large cities.
But considering the large amount Of money
suddenly thrown upon hitherto humble, il not
impoverished community, it is wonder, not
| that the people now think themselves obliged
| 10 take the law into their own hands against


marauders, but tha' they have not thought so
L.r Vat tlax, tba


for this exercise Of extra.judicial authority that


the remote Californians did during their early
domestic troubles. Titusvillc il in constant
telcgraphic communica ton with the capital of


the State and with the county seal II ii were
necessary to summon assistance from the
Sheriff Of the county or from the Governor, of
the State, in order to enforce the laws, aid
! could have been furnished within iweniy-iour


hours. II would have taken month before Cali


fornia could have been so assisted. What might
have been justifable in California under a GER


tain state of things cannot, therefore, be justl-
| fable in any part Of State like Pennsylvania
under similar circumstances. The citizens Of


Tiiusville were fully justified In arrcsting the
villains who set their dwellings and storchouses


in flames, and in keeping them in close custody


until the proper authorities could be apprised
| of the troubles. But we do not think they are


or would be ngh, in going any further, unless
| II became manifest that neither the county nor
the State authorities were competent to enforce


the laws. The question Of banishing people
unfortunately, men and women, whether
criminals or not, at this season Of The year, as
has already been done, Is one upon which the
authorities Of the towns adjacent 10 Titusvile
may have something TO say. These miserable
creatures certainly cannot live in the woods.
| They must be housed somewhere, or perish


The officers Of The law are also the proper per-
sons 10 take cognzancc of cases like these. In


short, however great the provocation- no
doubt II was extremely so--the citizens of
Titusville should, before resorting 10 final and
| irremedable measures, have tried the strength
Of the local authorities; IL Il were found incom-
pctcnt they should have added their weight as
q posse comitot,ls; II that was not sufficient,


they should have called upon the Sheriff Of the
county, and II that again was not competent,
the Governor Of the State might have been
called upon to vindicate the law II seems to
us that In great and enlightened State like


that Of Pennsylvania the legal enactments of
the Commonwealth can be maintained without


resorting 10 the terrible code Of Judge Lynch.


We trust, however, that the people OF Titusville


have not actually appealed TO that code during
their prcsent term Of excitement, and that later
intelligence will be OF . less sanguinary char
actar than that which Ia now befnra M."

Nothing Campaign will be forgotten The secret
order had made fast gains in few months all over
the State, and it was the firm belief of the men,
bers that the election of Mr.. Flournoy was secure
beyond a peradventure.


They knew not, however, what adversary
they had to meet Henry ""A. Wise attacked the
powerful order with fury unknown before in
political warfare. Wherever this formidable me-
gatherium bent his steps, the Know Nothing lodges
were crushed out by him, and the result showed
that the overthrow of the American party in Vir-
ginia was due to the personal exertions of Henry
A, Wise alone.


'Stumping the State "" is no easy matter under
any circumstances. The physical exerton is
enough to wear out most men. Wises constitu-
ton was feeble at best; and, moreover, the annoy
ances and vexations he endured in this memorable
campaign seemed enough to kill dozen such as
he. His indomitable will was all that sustained
him in gaining his victory.


1t was painful to behold him near the end of the
contest. His whole appearance was that of man
thoroughly broken down by mental and physical
exertion; for he was reduced to almost skel
eton.


In his youthful prime it is said that Wise was
much admired by the ladies'; but we do not think
that we magn !"" Eboshn,"" if we say that at
this period of his life his most ardent admirers
could notfor moment imagine the used-up orator
to be an Adonis.


But to our story. Mr.. Wise had just reached
depot on the Tennessee road, at which point were
collected a squad of people, drawn together to
await the arrival of the cars, or to get sight of
the man whom they politically admired or detested.
As soon as Gizzard-foot got to the station he was
introduced to every man of the crowd; among
among others to a famous sportsman, Mr.. F.,
celebrated for his wild, reckless humor. Wise
TODD his measure'' at q glance, and after the
first few common place remarks, the following
conversation took place:


""Glad to see you, Mr.. Wise""


GAS | am also to see you, Mr.. F,'


Been long looking out for you in these dig
gins, Mr.. Wise.'' sr..





''Why, yes, Mr. Wise; and you are very re-
markable looking man too. am glad to see YOU
personally, Mr.. Wise; but I can't vote for you
nohow.'


""Well then vote against me; this free country,
and every man votes as he pleases.n


''But hear me out, Mr.. Wise. Though can't
vote for you. | will bet on you""


""Ah, Mr. F., that's what | call talking. | ac-
cept that remark of yours as good omen, coming
from so distinguished a member of the society Of
sportsmen.'


""Mr. WISE let me explain myself by telling you
story. Some years ago was at a race at New
Market. There were six fine nags entered, all in
good condition; everyone bet on this or that
horse but to my eye they all lacked some good
point or other, and would not bet on any. Pre-
sently they brought in an old, lean, ugly scrawny
concern, whose appearance raised shout of
laughter. went up, however, and examined him
closely, found he had plenty of mettle, and, de-
spite of his looks | knew he must have bottom |





/ asked. They started; and though the dandy
nags went ahead at first, my old fellow was found
to be tougher than the whole batch. In the end
he won the stakes and when I came off that race
course my pockets could not hold the money
won. All this came of my betting upon the ug.
lest, scrawniest horse on earth and Mr.. Wise
I'll bet on you, too, and win.""


The crowd OF bystanders roared with laughter
9 in which Wise joined most heartily. All hands
shrieked, and Gzzard foot'' went on REJOICING
to Lynchburg. Norfolk virgnian.


A CURIOUS LAwsuIT.--The Paris Tribunal nj
Commerce has recently disposed of a very curious
lawsuit, which illustrates the way in which theat
rical matters are managed in that city. NJ Goud.
chou was the leader of the caque, or corps of pro
fessional applauders, at the Porte St. Martin Thea
ter. BY the terms of his contract with M. Marc
Fournier, the manager, he was to receive daily
eighty tickets of admission for the claqueurs free
of charge, and moreover tickets to the yalue oi
a year.. In May last NJ. Fournier seems to
have made up his mind that M. Goudchou was
""a dear purchase. He refused to give him
the eighty free tickets day, and as the claoueur
persisted in demanding them, that important func
tionary was dismissed, and another employed in
his place. M. GoudchOu now brought suit, de-
manding first, either restoration to his position
or the immediate repayment of about $4,000
which he had lent the manager for specified time
not yet expired; and secondly, $4,000 damages
for breach Of contract. M. Fournier replied with
cross action to compel payment OF $1,000 dam
ages for the Inconvenience caused him by his
chief cldgaeur's conduct, and $500 the price OF
the tickets already furnished to the corps


The Court dsaioweAboth claims for damages
holding that the contract was against public mo-
rality, and the tribunals could therefore take nc
cogLizance of it. NJ Fournier was obliged to re-
turn the borrowed money, and M. Gouchou waf
compelled to pay the $500 for tickets

THE TOBACCO CRoP IN VIRGINIA.--The Rich
mond Examiner estimates the tobacco crop in
Virginia at two-thirds Of the crop of 1860. The
general quality is excellent. In some of the to-
bacco counties, such as Dinwddie, Meckenberg,
Prince Edward, Amelia and Chorlotte, the labor
has been wanting. The product, however, even
in these counties, has been better than was anti
cipated. In those counties in which there was
less Of interference with the negroes, the results
are vsibly better. Halifax does pretty well, but
the counties Of Pittsyyania, Henry and Patrick
in Virginia, as well as Buckingham and Caswel
in North Carolina, have tobacco crop excellent
both in quality and quantity. In the neighborhood
of Lynchburg, too the results are comparatively
gratifying. There has been much less made of
the heayy, black and rich tobacco whichis usually
valued in the English and foreign markets, but of
the lighter and more attractive brands, which are
the tavorltcs of the home markets, and which con
sequently command higher prices, there is a very
fair crop, actually above the usual average.


The HOG GMARKETs.-L0utsrMe, Nou. l2.-Hoes
may be regarded as merely nominal in this
market, though we hear Of a sale to packer of a
lot of liz hogs, weighing an average of 204 It's. at
33c. gross. Buyers are still holding off, and
droyers are not pressing the market, though evil
IDENTIFY anxious to realize. Several fine dr0ves of
athogs have been sold in Shelby county at &c.
gross Courier.


Detroit Nov. l2.-Owing to the decline in other
markets, prices here tend downward. To-day
packers pau SLU IOF good IOl5 averaging Z0U lbs,
but this evening they declare themselves out of
the market at that figure. As the offerings are
light, it is possible there may be no material de-
cline until the last shipments are made to Lake

 Thus it will be seen that in March, 1865, General Canby was moving an adequate force against Mobile and the army defending 1t, un- der General Dick Taylor; Thomas was push ing out two large and well-appointed cavalry expeditions from Middle Tennessee un- der Brevet Major General Wilson against the enemys yitai points in Alabama, the other from East Tennessee under. Major General Stoneman towards Lynchburg-and assem- bling the remainder of his available forces, pre- paratoy to oiSsnasive operations from East Ten nessee; General sheridan'sy cavalry was at White House the armies of the Potomac and James were confronting the enemy under Lee in his defences of Richmond and Petersburg ]; General Sherman with his armies, re-en forced by fhato of Genetal Schofeld, vas at Goldsboro' Gsneral FopeMas making preparations for q spring campaign against the enemy unde Kir- by Smith and Price, west of the Mississippi 1; and General Hancock was concentrating a force in the vicinity of Winchester Virginia, to guard against invasion or to operate offensive as might prove necessary.

 After long march by General Sheridan g cavalry over winter roads, it was necessary to -..st ..1 -e4is at .trhite He~se.- At this time the greatest source of uneasiness to me was the

 fear that the enemy would leave his strong lines about Petersburg and Richmond for the purpose of uniting with Johnston, before he was driven from them by battle, or was pre- pared to make an effectual pursuit. On the 24th of March General Sheridan moved from White House, crossed the James river at Jones's landing, and formed junction with the army of the Potomac in front of Peters burg on the 27th. During this move, General Ord sent forces to cover the crossings of the Chikahominy. ,- ....

 On the 24th of March the following instruc- tions for general movement of the armies op erating against Richmond were issued:

 ""GEAERAL: On the 2eth instant the armies operating against Richmond will be moved by our left for the double purpose of turning the enemy out of his present position around Pe- tersburg and to insure the success of the cav airy under General Sheridan, which will start at the same time, in it's efforts to reach and destroy the South Side and Danville railroads Two corps of the army of the Potomac will be moved at first in two columns, taking the two roads crossing Hatcher:s run nearest where the present line held by us strikes that stream both moving towards Dinwiddie Court House.

 ""The cavalry under General Sheridan, join ed by the division now under General Davies, will move at the same time by the Weldon road and the Jeruselem plank k-road turning west from the latter before crossing the Notto- way, and west with the whole column before Stony creek. General Sheridan will then move independently, under other instructions, which will bc given him, All dismounted cav airy belonging to the army of the Potomac, and the dismounted cavalry from the middle military divisioE not required for guarding property belonging to their arm of service will report to Brigadier General Benham, to be ad- ded to the de6ences of City Point. Major Gen. eral Parke will be left in command of all the army left for holding the lines about Peters burg and City Point subject, of course, to or ders from the commander ofthe army of the Potomac The 9th army corps will be left ] intact to hold the present line of works so leug as the whole line now occupied by us is held: 1f however, the troops to the left of the 9th | corps are withdrawn, then the left of the corps may be thrown back 80 as to occupy the posi-. ton heldby the army prior to the capture of the Weldon road. All troops to the left of the 9th corps will be held in readiness to move at she shortest notice by such route as may be designated when the order is given. |

 General Ord will derach three divisions, two white and one colored, or so much

In the absence of fur. ther orders, or until further orders are given. l the white divisions will follow the left column | of the army of the Potomac, and the colored division the right column. During the move- ment Major-Ge Weitzel will be left in command of all the forces remaining behind from the army of the James.

 The movement of troops from the army of the James will commence on the night of the | 27th instant. General Ord will leave behind the minimum number of cavalry necessary for picket duty, in the absence of the main army, A cavalry expedition from General Ords com mand will also be started from Suffolk to leave there on Saturday, the lst of April under Col onel Sumner Tor the purpose Of cutting the railrcsd about Hicksford.

Ia lie case Of City Of New orleans rs. William

on the ground that the tax was imposed after the


city had sold to him tbs right of collecting tne


revenues of the market; that consequently inc
ordinance imposing the tax was nnconstttuuohai'
as il impaired the obligation OF the contract en-


tered into by the defendant with the city, s!nce u

been effected, it might virtually annul and Destroy

the city, although acontraeting party, did NOT On


that account, surrender the taxing power 1eae 9s


gated to it by the egislature that tae aelenuant NV
should have known that the city had the fght ta9

additional Particulars Of The Hoyri5i,
Murder Of Tho Deering Fdmay-There re
mains little to add to the details of the terri
Bile work of the demon who murdered the
Deering family, Gs reported in our last issue
The body of the bound boy, Cornelius, was
found on Thursday morning. The authori
ties coniectured that he too had shared the
late of the Deerings II was supposed that
he had been flung into ditch, but the dis
covery of his body under some hay, near Il
stack, about three hundred yards from the
house, relieved the police from their intend
cd task of dragging tho bitches that bound
the road through the premises. One of the
uead boys hands was seen protruding from
the hay that the murderer had thrown upon
1t from the stack. The skull of the unfortu.
nate lad had been crushed in, evidently by
blow from hammer, that was found aflel.
wards in stable, with tell-tale clots of blood,
mingled with human hair, adhering to il.
The body of the boy was a ghastly sight.
Inc throat was cut, and hay fork had left
Two poisoned wounds in his breast. The
lad must have resisted, his garments showing
evidences OF struggle for his life.


The house was diligently searched on
Thursday, and strong police force posted
to prevent any intrusion upon the premises.
The bodies OF the dead were taken to Cyrus
Hornes, the undertaken, the night before,
and on Thursday DIR, Shapleigh, the Coro,
ner physician, made postmortem upon
the bodies.


The victims were Christopher Deering,
aged 40 years; Julia Deering, aged 80 years;
Elizabeth Dolan, aged 90 years; John Deer.
ing, aged years; Thomas Deering, aged @
years. Annie Deering, aged years; Emma
Deering, aged IA months


The supposed murderer was so Obscure A
person that beyond his bearing the christian
name of Antony or Antoine, nothing is
known as yet concerning him. He speaks
English very imperteclly, and was probably
stroller when hired by Mr.. Deering. He
claimed to have served in the army. The
best description of him that the authorities
can get is that he is about 2s or 80 years of
age D feet IL inches in height; light COM
plexion; light hair; slight moustache and
goatee OF light color; pimples in his face;
round shouldered; stoops when walking;
walks slow and takes long strides; very mus.
cular, and presents a generally awkward
appearance. The thumb of his right hand
was gone, and he was marked with a mole
under his right car


The examination Of the premises showed
no evidences of struggle, nor anV other
marks of blood than those upon the axe and
hammer already spoken OF, and upon the
clothes OF the murderer that were found in
the house. He had left there his working
hat, coat, pantaloons, and shoes, the latter
covered with mud. The coat had blood
upon it, and one of the sleeves appeared as
il one of the dead had been carried upon it
The front of the pantaloons was much torn,
as ii some victim had struggled for his life
An empty pocket-boOk, belonging to Mr.
Deering, was found in a cupboard. Mr.
Mitchell states that il had nothing in it when
he received $50 from Deering on Saturday.
Three regular policemen, named Atkinson.
Welden and Dorsey, arrested n man on Fri
day, who was identified as Antony Probst
alias Ganther, the man employed by Mr.
Deering, and supposed to be the murderer
OF the entire family. A messenger was des
patched for Mrs Dolan, the mother of the
murdered neice of Mr. Deering, who soon
arrived at the spot and at once identified the
prisoner as the man PrObst, whom she had
known as laborer in Mr.. Deering's employ
When Mrs DOlan was confronted with him
IN the station house, he did not deny his
completely in the murder What he did
deny was that his own demons hand alone
performed the work. He admitted that he
had Killed the bound boy Cornelius, but
would acknowledge nothing further AT Al
subsequent examination he said he had an
accomplce named Jacob Ganther, formerly
OF the llth Pennsylvania Cavalry. He un-
blushingly stated that this man killed all the
family, the boy Cornelius excepted, and car.
rled OIL the plumber in satchel He got
altogether between three and four hundred
dollars in money, and lot of iewelry. The
bag, it is claimed by Probst, had been left at
the house of Mr.. Lakefeldt, corner Of Front
and Noble Streets, by his accomplice, This
statement Mr.. Lakeieldt denied, alleging that
Probst left it there in person.


man named Charles Smith was arrested
/
TO be the accomplice of Probst, but the latter
denied ever knowing him, and he was dis.
charged.


crowd gathered in front of the Mayor
ONCE during the examination, who threat
ened to lynch the prisoner, but the officers
succeeded in taking him safely to Moyamen-
sing prison.


The remains of the victims were inferred
on Saturday. The dead family were all mem.
bers of the Catholic Communion.


The authorities place little confidence in
Probst statements, and it is generally be.
lieyed that this wholesale murder was the
work of his own hands


In Memoriam.-Thc flags upon the Custom
House, Citv Hail. and other public and pri.
yate buildings, were displayed at half.mast.

OF the assassination of President Lincoln.

woundi for this reason many persons con.
slider the 14th of April as the proper ami.
yersary. Our people generally kept the flags

the especial attention of our readers to tho

Conn This company was the first in this
country TO successfully introduce the prac,
uce OF Insurance against Accidents, of what
eyer kind. 1t has been in operation since
the first of April, 1864, and has issued over
torty-iive thousand policies, and paid over
fourteen hundred losses. During the last
lew years this matter has been claiming the
attention of the public, and latterly has be-
come quite popular. Large numbers have
taken out policies, and every day shows that
Insurance Companies established on thi.
principle are growing in favor. in shor
time, we apprehend that it will become as
common to insure against accidents 10 tic

TERRIBLE MURDER IN ORANGE


COUNTY, INDIANA.


The Cincinnati Gazette, of Friday, says:


""A tragedy, rivalling those of Deerheld,
in this State, and Philadelphia, Pa. where
whole families were butchered occurred at
an early hour on Tuesday morning, in the
vicinity of West Baden, Orange county,
Indiana.


From what we have been informed of the
case, itappsars that shortly after the break.
ing out OF the war, a man named McCracken
enlisted in the Union ranks. A short time
after his departure for the seat of war, his
house and barn were burned to the ground,
the fire having originated by the torch of an
incendiary.


On returning home, after having served
his country faithfully, Mr.. McCracken learn
ed from family named Woodward that a
man named VIM, Saunders was the incen-
diary, his own daughter having acknowl-
edged the fact. Saunders was arrestedat the
instance of McCracken, but the case was
finally compromised, and the suit with
drawn The county officials, however, took
mold OF the matter, and the grand jury hay
ing indicted Saunders his trial was set for
this week.


Saunders, hearing that the Woodward
family would be the principal witnesses
against him, swore that they should never
appear in the court room alive. In fulfil
ment of these threats, he, on Tuesday morn.
ing last, short time before daylight, re.
paired to the residence of Mr.. Woodward,
and with bowie-knite coolly and dellber-
ately murdered Mr.. Woodward, his wife,
and eldest daughter, and an old lady, the
mother Of Woodward. The bloody deed
becoming known throughout the neighbor-
hood, the murderer was pursued, and finally
arrested. The most intense excitement pre-
walls throughout the whole of Orange county,
and strong threats of lynching the assassin
have been made"""
