Editor Placer Herold-SIR:-Tn the last
Democrat | notice an article which says
great deal about Boilers, and which tries to
make out that many of our candidates are
boilers, but says nothing about some who are
running on the Broderick ticket. Now l
don't believe that people who live in glass
houses should throw stones happen to be
acquainted ith two of their candidates for
the last two years-Scoby and Parker-and
although am their friend, 1 will just state
for the information of some people that the
charge of Bolterism would apply to them just
as much as any one else. Two years ago we
had democrat living here, who done perhaps
more. and spent more money for the Demo.
era ic party than any one in the place. and
who is not unknown in this county, mean
Philip Lynch. He was regularly nominated
at a township convention of Democratic del.
egates, for justice of the peace; and when the
election came off he was beat by small ma
.iority and DR.. Hawthorne elected in his place.
Now how was 1t done? Why, by just such
Boilers as Scoby and Wiley A. Parker
scratching his name off the regular Demo.
cratic tickets, putting Hawthorne's, Wing
on instead, and then pedling them around the
polls as the reg ular Democratic ticket
gambler named Whtcomb, made the third
one OF the gang who DID mat Trick upon the
democracy of this precinct. Does Scoby and
Parker think the honest voters here are going
to overlook their bolterism Of two years
standing? Wonder whether the imported ed.
itor, who does not know his men half as we'll
as some of US, can explain away this dark
stain from Scoby and Parker. do not know
whether Mr.. Lynch would like to have this
treachery told on these two worthless or not,
hut we Ophir Democrats still remember the
trick and those who played it, and shall con-
tinue to remember it at the ballot box in
September Who are bolters?

were expelled from the camp. A cry was raised
that the Indians had attempted to rob and murder
the whites; they were pursued by forty or fifty
armed men, two ofthem shot dead, and the third
mortally wounded We are glad to see that the
people were so indignant at this brutal butchery,
that the emigrants crossed the river in haste for
fear OF a lynching The same paper mentions
another murder Of an Indian, as was supposed, by
some reckless emigrant.


Can we wonder that ""Indan outrages' are so
frequent, when such brutal butcheres as the above
are perpetrated almost daily with impunity What
better than bloody retaliation can be expected of

Mr.. Editor.-Sir: Will you please in
form US who this newly imported apostle
of democracy is that talks so flippanty in
the Placer Democrat? Who is this man
,hat talks of right. wrong, and the law of
right? | have resided in this county since.
40, have always voted the democratic
ticket, and even swallowed some of the
outrageous schemes that have been fas.
tened upon the party as democratic, and
am still prepared 10 go as far as any other
man in the dernorratic party, in the sup.
port Of the candidates fairly and legally
nominated by the democratic convention.
The writer Of this has never resided in
Auburn, is connected with no ""Auburn
clique"" has never held an office, and de-
sires no official pap. He has always
heen contented to serve as private in
the ranks of the democratic party, is con.
tent to do so still. But he desires no
man, imported from Sacramento to come
here preaching democracy, when in the
same paper he publishes the names Of
Walton and others, rs delegates from
this precinct. 1t is we'll know fact
fact that these persons were never chosen
to represent this precint in convention,
and that they never could have been cho.
SEN At the primary meeting held at
Lynch's they were beaten 100 to S, and if
they were elected at all, it was after mid.
night and after the regular meeting had
adjourned. Now the attempt to intro
duce these men into the convention was
un outrage upon the democracy of this
precinct, All outrage upon the delegates
Illegally chosen, and done, no doubt, to pre-
vent the legal delegates from voting at
the organization of the Convention. IT.
the editor OF the Democrat calls this
right, this the law Of party, then we con-
fess that we are ignorant Of democratic
law. 1t is an imposition to which the
democrats Of this precinct will never sub
nit.


Those who attempted this fraud may
be very good tools, but they cannot play
this kind of a game upon the people here
abouts.


Another apostle of democracy is among
us-a State official, sent from San Fran
cisco to look after the benighted demo-
Gratis of old Placer. Why should not
State officers be nye their posts attending
to their duties? What a hue and cry
was raised last winter against interference
in political matters by the officials OF the
general government. What business, we
say, have State officials holding situations
in San Francisco, with the politics Of
Placer county.

eight convics were started off for the penentary.
They were handcuffed first, and then blacksmith
sent for, who riveted them in couples with heavy
iron. Afterwards they were marched from the


prison hall into the Office, 10 await there the


rival of the coach. II was humiliating spectacle,


and the dogged eye and burning cheek of more
than one prisoner told that tender cord was


touched amid all the surrounding obdurateness.
But there was passage in the scene which was
| imbued with peculiar feeling of another kind.


Among the criminals was Daniel Cullen, con-
victed of the most foul murder Of his own wife,
and sentenced TO term OF ninety-nne years in
the penitentiary-a prisoner for life. Shortly be-
fore the arrival OF the coach, woman, bowed and
decrepid with years, and bearing infant in her


arms, entered the Office hesitatingly Scanning
| the faces of the crowd her eye fell finally upon
| Cullen and with shrek of recognition, pain and


half JOY il appeared, she to him. and fell weep


ing on his breast. II was his mother, come TO bid
him farewell, and show him his own child for the
last time. The scene was moving one. The


man at first was ashamed to give way TO his feel
| ngs, and for while demonstrated gently with his
| old mother she fondled with him. AT last,
however, nature could contain itself no longer
he fell back upon his seat and cried like child.


The marshal and jailer, with all their familiarity
| with distresses OF the kind found difficulty in


mastering their own promptings. When the con-
veyance arrived il required no little exerion TO
| part the mother from her son.

! Novel Case.-The Lynchburg Express has an


account of an extraordinary case, from which we
| gather the following: James Going, young man


of Lynchburg, forged the name Of Mr.. John Che


naut to note, giving the clerk of the court per-


mission to grant marriage license for the said
| Going to marry Mr.. C.'s daughter. The trick


succeeded so well that the license was granted,


and the parties were married on the following


Tuesday night. But alas, for the frailty OF human


hopes! Mr.. Chenault broke rudely in upon the


felicity of the young couple; the fresh and beau-
| ful flowers of Hymen withered before the blasting
| breath of the constable, and the husband was
| dragged before the mayor. 10 answer the serious


charge Of forgery The father of the lady testified
| that he had opposed the marriage, and never
| signed the note in question: and the mayor com.


mitted the late happy bridegroom TO jail, there TO
await further examination on Thursday. ""
| Bryant, who signed his name TO the forged paper
as witness, declared that he was Ignorant OF
what he swore 10; but he was nevertheless re-


quired to give bail for his appearance TO answer
the charge of misdemeanor The parties reap


peared before the mayor on Thursday last Mr.
Chenault took an entirely different ground from
that taken previously, and stated that he had told
his daughter that she might marry Going, but that
when she did so she must leave his house forever.


He also gave her permission to write the permit
to the clerk to issue license. Mr.. Going was,
therefore, released from custody.

7th ultimo about quarter Of mile from the
Astor House, while Master Charles Gotten was

away. Charley quietly walked 10 his fathers

Recapture of an Escaped Bank RObbcr.-
Ia November. 1852 John Rand was tried at Nor
folk for robbng the Farmers Branch Bank,
Portsmouth, Va, OF about 100000, and was con-
victed and sentenced TO ten years in the State
prison. but while in jail at Norfolk, awaiting the
decision on exceptions which had been filed, he
managed TO effect his escape. This was year
ago. Officers from Virginia arrived in this city
last week, in search of Rand who was not 10 be
found and they returned home leaving authority
with Constable Clapp for his arrest. Yesterday
Rand was seen in Court street by Constable
Clapp, and he was shortly again in custody. In
default of $4,000 ball. he was committed 10 Jail
to await requisition from the governor Of Vir-
ginia.


Rand effected his escape in this way. Two
females from Boston arrived at Norfolk, and as IS
the custom there We're allowed unrestricted in
tercourse with the prisoner. One night the fe-
males gave an entertainment in the Jail, at which
the jaor and Rand were present. During this
entertainment the females managed to obtain the
jailors key and they and Rand walked of to-

She attended church not many Sundays ago, at

A Sailor Hero.-Although instances of hero

few can be adduced more striking than one that
has recently come to our knowledge. The British
brig Venilia, Captain D'Entrement, left ST. Eus-

seven in sumber, were taken down with lever,

~To THE PEOPLE OF THE INTERIoR.o",,"with yenaly-and attempts to create dstrust in the
minds of the mountain people against their men,
bers Of the legislature, and the inhabitants of the
cities In taking this nefarous course they pretend
to be actuated by the purest Of motives, and affect
virtue that would become honorable and high
minded men. Such incendary attempts to create
jealousies between the different portions of the
State, are unworthy any man of standing and char
acter, and is fit instrument only of those who are
sunk to the lowest depths of moral degradation


The plea set forth by the writer Of the article in
question: for his attempts to inaame the minds of
tho mountaineers is, that the Legislature of this
State violating their oathS of Office, the conSti-
tuition of the State Of the United States, and are
usurping of the highest privileges that pertain
to froemen The apparent candor with which the
reasons are urged-the srccious arguments used
the holiness Of the appeal to the people, and the
denuncitatory tone towards the members of the le-
gislature, would induce those nnacquaintcd with
the real facts, to believe that serious infracton
on the fundamental principles of our government
was intended to be perpetrated by our legislators,
and by that act the birtright OF the people would
be in jeopardy. This spccous course Of reasoning
fit only for the lowest of the scrvile-nlay find
an echo in the demagogue the dissolute hangcr-on
for political crumbs, for doing the dirty work OF
those who would ruin virtue, honesty and integrity
to obtain place and power but men who have the
good of tho State in view--mcn who understand
the question in all its bearings and ramifcatons,
will not second the base purposes Of those who
arc striving to poison the fountain Of political power
virtue and integrity.


The interests of the inhabitants Of the mountains
are intimately blended with those of the dwe!lers
in the valleys and the cities. Emanating from the
came stock--actuated by the same mpuses--haying
a community of interests at stake, it necessarily
follows each is dependent the other to carry out
the great designs of rational and moral intelligence
Like the limbs TO the human body, the diversity
of population and pursuits are necessary for the
arteries of commerce to flow freely and hcalhfaly
throughout the land Block up any of the avenues
through which it is dispensed and an unhealthy
and feverish action takes place So it is with the
agricultural pursuits. Twin brother with commerce,
and its necessary adjunct it is necessary for the
veal of the state that they should be left to the
harmonious workings of mutual interest So it is
with the mining interest. Corrclatiye with the
other great interests of the taking the same
relation to them as the manufacturing interest does
in the older State--iS the mining interest. These
three combined form the basis of our wealth and
greatness Together they have brought our State
from its wild and rugged appearance to one which
can proudly vie with the older States. Our COM
mercial interests are as important rs that Of any
portion of the world. Of the mines it is unnccca-
cary to sneak at present, as all must admit their
Importance.


Scattered throughout the vast extent of our
State, inhabiting the cities, villages, and hamets
on the plains, in the mountains ravines, gulchcS,
flats, and by the river side, are q set of hardy en-
ergetc, industrious and talented mcn--men who |
have withstood the iuclemency Of the elements, and
the ravages Of disease, to make this State what it
is. These men have a community of interests, both
pecuniarily and political. Whatever affects one
portion affects the other. Acting in concert, the
WELD power equal in weight to that Of any other
of the consolidated States of cur Union as the mate
rial for that purpose is here congregatcd in greater
proportion to numbers than in any other portion
of the habtable globe.


Such being the relation between the various in
tcrests of the State, and acknowledging, as we all
InuSt tIle upon cuGn Otltf tNat
necessarily must exist, hold that press as recrc
ant to our interests as State that endeavors to
array the rreudccs of the Inhabitants of the differ
ent portions Of the State against each other As a
citizen Of mountain county, we object to this pam
dering to the baser passions of men to arouse a
jealousy which never should be entertained by
people of the same State. More especially should
caution in this respect be observed, in country
like our own, where great variety Of people
from the different nations arc c0ngregated, and
where the various interests are so dependent on
each other. Let the people reflect on these things.

DAYS of Hersd that pOtentate would have been spared
the trouble of sending armed the country to
murder the children, and his fame mi ght have come
down to these times rcdolent of the odor of
sanctity instead of reeking with infamy. Had
he operated in legal manner, as our mod
ern poisoners do, his evil design would have
come quite as near success and Rachel would as GER
tapy have mourned her Children though without heap
ing curses upon the head of the Tetrarch. The bills
of mortality in this city present uniform report
from week to week. of sixty per cent. of the whole
sumber Of deaths as occurring among very young
children and about fifty per cent under the age oftwo
years-the mark fixed by Herod for bis slaughter
1t were preposterous to assert that this excessive in
fantle mortality is natural necessary 1t arises
from many different causes all at time other
under human control, and all the result of ignorance
carelessness, or wful wickedhess. OF the varied
we propose at present to advert to single one
the use Of poison sold Throughout the city under
the rame of milk.


At the foot of the Tenth avenue there exists great
dstillery OF itself an intolerable nuisance but so
strongly intrenched by the wealth and influence of
its proprieters that all efforts to break it up have
failed. 1t has been presented by the Grand Jury we
believe more than once but no law has been found
strong enough TO put stop to it, probably because
Of the magnitude of the nuisance, as the man who
robs by millions is likely to go unpunished, while the
ragged pferer of dollar gets his full allowance of
Justice. But it is not in its immediate filth aud
stencil that this distlery is most perncious. Its ul
innate effect the substance it produces and sends all
over the City in the form of poisoned milk, is curse
of much more fearful nature.


We have heretofore described the premises the
stables, cows milk and other matters thereabout;
but official report just made to the Health Officer
by the Sanitary Inspector, which we print in another
column, is worthy of attention, not much for new
facts for recalling those heretofore set forth in
Grand Jury presentments and Police Reports. The
Inspector found in three Of stables reaching
from TeUth 10 Eleventhavs., more than fifteen hun
ired cows, each one tied in stall but three fee.

nearly all of them in advanced stages OF disease.
These cows are fed exclusively on warm
swill. made for the purpose in the dis
tillery The Inspector says the stencil in
which the live was so potent that his assistants
were forced TO quit the stables for time in order to
recover from its sickening effects These poor, dis
eased animals are MIXED twice day, and the nasty


LIQUID that comes from them is doctored with chalk,
burnt sugar and other drugs until it has the appear
snce OF good milk and is then put into wagons labeled
""Westchester County Milk. "" Pure Country Milk ""
and other lying devices and sold throughout the City
OF course the greater portion of it goes to the poer
classes, those who through ignorance or inability
not be sure of getting real milk and put up with any
white liquid that may be offered SUCH And il is
from these classes that the of infant mortality
returned The cows in these stables are owned by
hundred or more different men the owners of the
distiery receiving for stable-room and swi nine
cents per day for each COW.


We take it that no stronger evidence of the respect
of our people fer law can be required than the simple
fact that with full knowledge of the above facts,
they have neither burned the distlery nor the
stables nor lynched single one of the heartess
lures engaged in this Wholesale destruction of chill

enormity of their ofense If they were 20 distribute

a motion passed, one delegate from each
township to report on credentials and the
permanent officers Of the convention


That committee retired, and parties
contesting seats went before 1t with their
witnesses and written evidence. The
precincts contested were Mad Canon,
Lynch's Ranch, and Volcano Canon. G.
A. Tuttle, proxy for +. Belcher Of Mad
Canon, appeared before the committee,
and after an investigation Of all the facts
presented, was reported in connection
with Messrs Byrnes and Courtney as the
legal delegates from that precinct.


In the Lynch's precinct contest, it was
proven before the committee that some
eight or ten persons assembled at Lynch's
Hotel, on the evening of the primary elec-
ton and organized by placing NJ Walton
in the chair, and appointing w. D Taber,
Secretary. AT this juncture the meeting
was increased by the arrival of democrats
who lived in the precinct. Motions were
made which the chairman at first refused
to put to the meeting. Mr.. Taber, the Sec
retary, moved that Capt. Thompson take
the chair. The evidence before the COM
mittee proved that the chairman put the
motion and declared 1t carried, and ga
Gated the chair to the Captain, who took
it and went on with the business of the
meeting; and the minutes as presented to
the county convention show regular pro-
ceedings and the election Of Messrs. Cof-
fee, Vanderbilt and Black as delegates to
the convention.


Notwithstanding the above facts, we
find persons contesting their seats, who
were elected after the regular meeting had
adjourned, and the democrats who com
posed it had gone to their homes. All
this was in evidence; and yet we hear of
Broderic kites talking of fraud, on the
part of their opponents.


In relation to Volcano Canon, it was
proven before the committee on creden-
tias that some nine persons, who resided
at Sarahsvlle, in Michigan City precinct,
went down into Volcano precinct, while
the miners were at work, and held meet
ing and appointed E. B. Boust, and Mr.
Fisher to the County Convention, al
though neither Of them resided in the
precinct, while the call for the election
was for 8 O'Clock in the evening, and had
been made so at the request of the demo-
cratic miners in the precinct to suit their
convenience after working hours, and yet
the Brodericktes talk of fraud! Here
was as fagrant an outrage as ever was
committed upon sovereign people. A
band Of men deliberately marching out of
their own precinct to assume the rights of
the voters Of another precinct. There
was no reason, justice or democracy in
the act. The democrats of Volcano con-
vened at the hour they had called the
meeting and elected Messrs. Hungerford
and Merriman as delegates, democrats re-
siding IN the precinct. In substantiation
of the above facts the following petition
was laid before the committee:


WHEREAS, 1t is understood and expected
that there will be an attempt made on the
part Of Messrs. Roust. Craig and others, to
occupy the seats of the regular delegates
from this precinct, Therefore, we, the under
signed, voters of Volcano Canon precinct
would respectfully represent to the Democrat
ic delegates of Placer county at Auburn as
sembled, that we look upon any such effort.
as an attempt to defraud the democracy of
this precinct of their just rights OF represen
taton in your convention, on the following
grounds:


1st. That the nine men who arrogated to
themselves the right to appoint the delegates
from this precinct, were not residents of this
precinct but of Sarahsville and never before
claimed the right to vote ut our polls.


2nd. That there was notice given in the
precinct of a meeting to choose delegates,
previous to their coming. Said meeting to
be held at o'clock, p. m and that even al
lowing their right to vote in this precinct
they had no right to supercede the regularly
notified meeting in said precinct.

This was finally agreed to, and the impatient mob let in, when, to their astonishment, they found their victim ready for the sacrifice, with nothing on him but a pair of socks, while his naked state seemed particularly adapted to the eccentric costume which they proposed to fit him out with The tar and feathers were at hand, and men willing ly pitched in to give him his new suit The brushes and mops were dipped into the tar buck et and speedily applied to his naked form, while the victim stood 1t like martyr. What was their surprise, however, to find that the substance wouldn't stick and slid off his person as fast as 1t was applied. It was in vain they worked, for the tar wouldn't take hold. Upon questioning him sharply and examing him close ly, they found that the Reverend gentleman had actually greased himself all over, in an- tlclpat1on of the course that would he pursued toward him. Hisingenuity, however, wouldn't save him, and vengance finally triumphed.- Some genius in the crowd suggested method which was immediately adopted. It was no- thing more or less than to sprinkle him with ashes, and little dirt and sand. The plan succeeded-the priming stuck, and the tar and feathers were applied and adhered; after which they trotted him around on a rail"

 The steamship Empire City, arrived at New Orleans on the 12th inst We gather the fol- lowing items of news from the New Orleans pa- pers of the 18th inst:

 State Items.

 The steamer Sea Bird arrived on the Sd inst, from Los Angeles, bringing intelligence of new ly discovered placer diggings, located about five miles beyond the Tejon upon the river Possi- uncua. The yield is from $4 to $25 per day, to the man.

 Capt. Harry Love, we'll known as the captur- CT of the celebrated robber, Joaquin, was mar lied on the 31st of May last, to Mrs. Mary Ben nett, of Santa Clara.

 The result of the election for Congressmen and State officers, which took place on the 9th inst, has been another democratic victory. The returns render 1t certain that Messrs. Denver & Herbert, the Anti Frederick candidate for Con- gresS, have trumphed by handsome maiorities There will be also a clear majority in both branches of the next Legislature. Joseph R. Beard, the whig candidate, is, however, elected Clerk of the Supreme Court.

 By the arrival of the Southerner on the 4th nst from San Diego we have the particulars ot desperate affray at Monterey, resulting in the death of an American and the lynching of na- tive Californian. The American was a peace off. cer named William Hardmouth. He was at tempting to arrest the Californian for disorderly conduct in dance house, when he resisted, and finally shot him in the abdomen with buckshot. The Californian was afterwards dragged from his bed by mob, and hung from the caves of the house in which he had committed the mur- der.

 Southern California. New diggings have been discovered and are yielding finely.

 The Los Angeles Star says:

 Mr. $. Kaufman, of the firm of H. Mayer & Co.,. for some time engaged in the Santa Fe and Chihuahua trade, arrived from Fl Paso last week, with twenty large Chihuahua wagons and about 300 mules, the largest and finest train that ever before arrived in this valley The train left Ell Paso on the 12th of June, being including stoppages, about two months and a half on the route. MT. K. reports the Apaches very hostile, committing depredations whenever and wherever an opportunity offered. On the Rio San Pedro the Indians killed MT. Whit hey, partner of Madison & Co.,, with large drove of cattle for this country, and their ma jor- domo, by the name of Edwards. Messrs. Whit ney and Edwards were in pursuit of some cat tie about a mile ln the rear of the train when they were surprised by large party of Indians and shot with rifles. There was also another man badly wounded, but succeeded in making his escape, and is now recovering. The feed for stock was very good from Fl Paso to Tuson, but from the latter place until they arrived at Warmers ranche the feed was very poor, SC much so that it was a matter of surprise that 1iuo crossed the Rio Colorado at the new ferry known as the Pilot Knob Ferry, and speak in the high est praise of Messrs Mclean, Little & Arm. strong, the proprietors, for their gentlemanly attention and quick dispatch they received 1T crossing the river The following gentlemen all with large drovcs of cattle, from San Anto nio, Texas, were encamped near Tuson, wait ing for better feed on the Gila river: Messrs Pyron Edwards, Fully, Sweet, & Co. The weather was extremely hot, and there was nc rain on the route after leaving Tuson.

 From Oregon--More Indian Massacres.

 The Oregonian says: We are indebted to Stewards Express for the following information n relation to the murder of eight American emigrants, and the capture and carrying of oi four women and several children by the Snake Indians. An express had arrived at the Dalles with the startling intelligence that few days since, an immigrant train, consisting of four wa gons, eight men, four women, boy of l2 years old, and several small children, were attacked b6y sixty Indians, about fifteen miles beyond Fort Boise The men were all killed, the boy badly wounded, and the women, children, stock and property carried off John F. Noble, Esq. formerly of Vancouver, found the wounded boy and the bodies of the killed. He immediately came on to Fort Boise, whereupon MT. Frui started tor the Dalles with the information, anc 10 get assistance to, if possible, recapture the women and children. Gov Gaines, who wal at or near Fort Boise, awaiting the arrival O ms sons, who are coming across the plains, ral iied some fifteen men and started in pursuit o tne Indians, determined to overtake and pun !sn M these murderers and recover the prisoners we also learn that all the disposable troops al 'ne Dalles were immediately mounted and de. sSPatched to Fort Boise, and that company Jeff vancouver on the steamer Belle, on Thursday nnl,ofhlng, n, for the same point Also, that Nathan 0Oliiey had raised some twenty volunteers at the Dailes, and had gone after the murderers.

",,"The Trouble at Praya, Peru.-The following
is said to be a true account of the trouble at
Praya:


Don Domingo Elias, who, awhile since, was
banished from Peru for sundry obnoxious political
publications, entered the town of Tumbex, on the
northern line of Peru, October 2l, with twenty or
twenty-five men. Now, Tumbez we always sup
posed 10 be a town of Ecuador, and not of Peru,
and hence are at loss TO know why they were
almost Immediately surrounded by the national
guard Of 200 men, headed by Senor Portalauza,
Governor of the town. But so il was and the
guard firing into Elias company, and that exiled
gentleman forbidding his men 10 fre-we cannot
see whv-eight or ten Of Elias men cap
tured while he and the uncaptured balance fled TO
the United States consulate. This was early in
the morning, and before he was fairly out OF bed,
our consul, Mr. g. J. Oakford, found his house full
Of fugitives claiming the protection of Christian
and an American, against an armed mob of two
hundred men and that to have surrendered them
would have been grossly barbarous and un-Amer-
ican They were protected, though the guards
did not cease from firing into the house until they
had shot one man dead and wounded two others.
Some five days afterwards, Governor Antonio
Bene videx, OF the province OF Paira, came into
mort in a small vessel, and sent for the consul TO
come and see him. Mr.. Oakford went, and being
abused by the governor, talked up TO him-even
going so far as TO hint, and the governor took the



that a Peruvian stramer Of war had come to
anchor--that the tickle people of the town, being
disgusted with the whole affair, were meditating
his honors arrest. But the arrival Of the steamer
reassuring him. he ordered the consul 10 give up
the arms Of the men, which order was obeyed. On
the same day he ordered the consuls doors TO be
forced, and the men themselves TO be given up.
Being defenceless, resistance was In vain, OF
course. The inner room was entered, and all the
men, except Elias, who had managed TO escape,
were seized and borne away""


Boiler Explosion-One Man Killed-Sey-
eral badly Scaldcd.--The boiler of the steam
propeller Petrol exploded at seven o'clock on
Saturday morning, while the vessel was passing
through Hurlgate on her way from Provideace.
Rhode Island, to this city. Peter Lynch, the fire,
man, was instantly killed. and several others We're
badly scaded. Their names Joseph Ander-
SON. engineer; Peter Williams, assistant engineer;
Henry Hughes, James Herman, Smith, Thomp-
son, Henry Nichols, and Joseph Crosby, deck
hands. OF these, the engineer and his assistant,
il Is feared, are fatally injured. The wounded
were brought to the city as quickly as possible
and convened to the residences of themselves or
their friends. The body of the deceased was left
on board the steamer, which was towed 10 the
foot of Albany street, where Coroner Gamble yes
terday held an inquest upon it, The evidence OF
William M. Forbes, captain Of the vessel, was
taken. and is as follows:


aPeter Lynch, the deceased, has been employed
on board the Petrol for about two weeks. We
left Providence at noon yesterday for New York;
all things went well until seven o'clock TINS morn
ing; we had then reached Hurlgate. was in
the pilot house, and heard an explosion; found
that the water bottom Of the boiler had been
blown out. On going into the freroom, found
the deceased dead. The steam escaping from the
boiler, caused the two engineers and five deck
hands 10 be scalded. The steamer Granite State
soon came up, and placed the injured persons on
board of her, and they were brought to the city.
The steamer Nahant towed us to the pier at which
we now lie We were running at moderate
rate of speed, and were carrying about thirty-hve
pounds of steam to the inch; think our certlhcate
allows us to carry fifty pounds, but believe we
have never carried over forty pounds"" The above
was the principal evidence taken, and the jury
rendered a verdict ssthat the deceased came 10
his death by scalds received by the blowing out OF
the water bottom Of the boiler Of the steam-pro-
peler Petrel."" The deceased was native OF
Canada, twenty-three years of age


Fatal Accident.--Thursday afternoon, as Mr..
Sorrel (clerk at the Broad Street HoteD and Mr..
George w. Howell principal operator OF the
Washington and New Orleans telegraph office in
this city, were passing through Marshall stsee. y
buggy, the horse became unmanageble and dashed
off, when nearly opposite the residence OF James
Lyons ESQ., into 7th street, thence into Broad: and
ransdown Broad street at fearful pace AS soon
as the horse became unmanageabc, Mr.. SorreI
fell out of the buggy, and escaped without injury.
Mr.. Howell unfortunately retained his seat, and
endeavored to- guide the horse This, however,
proved to be hopeless task. The animal dashed
madly towards the northern side walk of Broad
street. and in endeavorng to gain It, shattered the
buggy against tree in front Of the depot Of the
Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad. The
concusson caused Mr.. Howell 10 fall from the ve
hice, and in falling, his forehead struck the pave
ment violently. He was picked up and borne to
the Broad Street Hotel, where he lay insensible
the whole night breathing with much difficulty
Drs Beale and Gibson were promptly in attend
ance, but their acknowledged skill proved un-
avaling; this morning, at 20 minutes past six
O'Clock, he breathed his last.


An incident in the life of the deceased-whch
occurred many years ago-is no doubt fresh in
the memory Of most of the citizens of this city.
He was rescued them when mere boy, from inn
pending death, by stout-hearted youth, (now
Lieutenant KeIum) who braved the angry food,
and at the imminent hazard Of losing his own,
saved the life of companion. II thus seems that
IN accordance with the insctutable DEGREES of
Providence he was rescued then only to meet
more deplorable fate in after years.

June 1st, 1854.",,"Eds. Citizen Some time ago you re-
quested me to give short history Of Jim
Grow Canon, how it got that name, and
under what circumstances, which now
propose TO do in . few words.


Toward the last Of April, 1850, it was
reported in Downieville that large party
Of Kanakas, under the direction Of one
Jim Grow, had discovered very rich Dig,
= gings somewhere between the South and
Middle Forks of the Yuba. The bump of
marvelousness was then largely developed
on everybody's Uranium, and no report
was too incredible to be believed. Little
knots of knowing ones were observed here
and there, talking in subdued tones, and
glancing furtively around, lest eavesdrop-
pers might be around and discover the
secret. Just in the nick of time the re-
doubtable Jim Grow appeared in town,
and by his mysterious bearing confirmed
the suspicious that were already enter
tanned. After making a few purchases
and displaying a well filled purse, he
strolled leisurely out of town. But Mr..
Crows movements had been remarked,
and his departure was the signal for the
shouldering of packs in fifty different
camps. Each party laboring under the
deluson that the secret was known only to
themselves. The wood was alive with
men with picks and shovels and three days
provisions, one party trying to dodge the
other, and all in hot pursuit of Jim Crow.
The result was, that that individual was
tracked to his camp by about two hun
dred men, who found that the secret was
known elsewhere, for eighty or hundred
Americans were camped close by the
Kanakas, keeping watch of their move
ments.


A meeting was called, laws passed for
the regulation of the new diggings, and
Jim Grow was requested to point out the
richest place in the diggings. That gen.
tleman was somewhat uncertain about the
matter-could' say positively, but his
opinion was that in the ravine East of the
camp, the richest deposits might be found.
This was enough. All were allowed fair
start, and the race commenced. Each
one stuck his stake wherever he happened
to strike the ravine, and in five minutes
all the chances were taken. The owner
ship of the ground settled, all returned to
camp satisfied that nothing remained to
be done but to dig the gold. The next
day prospecting began. Holes were dug
in the bank, rocks turned over, and gravel
paned from the bottom of the brook, but
melancholy to relate, it wouldn't pay
Some talked of lynching the Kanakas,
and others of taking vengeance on the
Americans who accompanied them; but
one after another took his departure
until nobody but the Kanakas were left.
After the snow melted away, Jim Grow
and his party gathered up their traps and
left for parts unknown, having camped at
that place for no other purpose than to
wait for the melting away of the SNOW. l
forgot to state Jim Grow was renegade
American, who had resided several years
in the Sandwich Islands, had Kanaka
wife and several children, and was regarded
As leader Of the party.


This wild goose chase induced others to
make examination of the ravine in the
vicinity of the old Kanaka camp, and
some very rich spots have been found, al
though Jim Grow and party knew nothing
of their existence.


In one of these ont of the way places
your humble servant is at present. l have
no big strokes to report, though l now
and then find slug which is slowed away
to be thrown at the wolf should he come
nosing about my door in after years
There are not many miners here. Stranger
get discouraged because the gold is SC
spotted"" and take their departure aftel
weeks unsuccessful prospecting; but fo1
my part / make out very well, and dom
feel inclined to migrate. If you can maxi
out my peuciIlinss it is more than | ex
pect, for l have forgotten the use of let
ters, and become fixture about mining
camp. Cayotes take the liberty Of bark
ing at me, and are only restrained from
carrying of my dinner by respect which
they entertain for an old musket which
they have several times accidently dis
charged by meddling with string tied te
the trigger. Respectfully, Yours,


HERMIT.

Fellow- Citizens of Sacramento County:


Having been selected by your partially
to represent you in the Assembly, have
/ devoted my entire time to discharge of
my duties. In this, trust, have not dis
appointed your expectations. In conse-
quence Of my many engagements, have
not been able to confer with you as freely
as desired My great object is to know
and to do your will.


The question of the election of a Unit
ed States Senator at this session Is now
before us This is question of great
difference of opinion.


| have all the time doubted the propriety
of bringing on the election at this time;
but whilst at Benicia, was informed by
several of my Democratic felow-citizens
Of Sacramento, that the whole party Of
that county desired that the election might
he had at this session. | was therefore
induced to consent to bring on the election
at this time. But, since coming among
you, | find was greatly mistaken as to
your wishes, and that many-l think IA
| large maj jorty-of my constituents are
opposed to it. If |, as your Representa-
tive, have mistaken your wishes and gone
into a caucus, agreeing to abide by its
decision, am only bound so far as 1t is
not opposed to your interests or to your
will; your rights should not be affected
by it. Your will, not mine, shall be done.
Again, if men wrongly represent to me
what you desired, no caucus obligations
can restrain me from doing your wi |,
when shall know what it is The first
principle of Representative Democratic
Government commands the Representa-
tive to do the will of his constituents
and no party usages, caucus, ru es, or
promises, wrongly extorted, can excuse
| the Representative.


/ A Democratic Representative, when he
goes into party caucus, agreeing to
! abide by its decision, is only bound by the
decision when it is constitutional, when
it is consistent With Democratic principles,
and when it is not in violation of the viii
of his constituents


doubt the constitutionaIity Of the cleo
ton at this time. 1t is without precedent
in any State do not believe it is in ac-
cordance with Democratic principles. 1t
removes the Senator still farther from the
people, when he was before for six years
beyond their reach. 1t is the exercise of
a power which can as vel, if not better,
he exercised by our successors elected
for that purpose. The voice of the peo
| pie of this county seems opposed to 1t.
/ therefore dec are myself ab>olved from
/ all obligations to vote for the election of
a Senator If in this err, that error can
do the people no wrong; for their next
representatives., elected by them in refer
ence to this subject, will reflect their will
/ in due time.


But if should wrongly elect now,
might violate popular wi and encroach
on popular rights, to the shame and dis
grace of the ever revered name Of Demo
cracy |, therefore. felIow-citiZenS, de
cline to exercise this doubtful right, as
believe it my duty to do under the solemn
oath have taken. You were not afraid
to trust me as your preventative; am
not attraid to trus. you. and to leave IN
your hands all the power you did not in
tend to give me. My sentiments are too
Democratic to allow me TO encroach on
YOUR rights Determine hereafter for
yourselves who shall he your Senator,
and when he sha be elected.


Having The fullest confidence in Presi-
dent Pierce and his Administration, am
unwilling now to elect United States
Senator, lest we might elect some one OPP
posed to him, and thereby further distract
the Democratic party, and paralyze the
influence of our present Senators and
Representatives so long before the eX-
piration Of their term of office.

| EDS. CouRIER:-The want of news to write


about, more than anything else, has caused that


silence which you seem to think may have been


occasioned by drowsy insensibility to this
worlds affairs. We have had our weather eye
open, but have only discovered one remarkable
feature in the winter thus far-that is, the in-
tense coldness OF number of days. We noticed
the thermometer to stand, on the mornings OF
four days at from two to ten degrees below
Zero which was colder than ever before known
here.


The rainy season has not been as prolific as
was expected or desired; and, as conse-
quence, we are experiencing duller times than
we otherwise should. The scarcity of water
has given a backward tendency to almost
erythng; but, as spring draws nigh, our hopes
brighten at the approach of that day which shall
see commenced again and completed that work
which has promised so often to give our mines
the desired water, and our business men that
| .' good time coming"" tot


We have the unpleasant duty of chronicling
another death by violence. The affair origin
ated about mining claim. The facts are as fol-
lows as near as we can learn. On Thursday
ast meeting of miners called, about hals a
mile above town, to settle dispute in regard
to claim. While the miners were congrega-
ting, one James Stewart said something about
the claim which was denied by Mr. Henry
Smith, the claimant. who al the same time step
ped towards Stewart. Stewart Immediately
drew his revolver, telling Smith not to advance
any further Smith did not advance, but Stewart
fired, the shot taking effect in the abdomen.
Smith turned to retreat, and in doing SO was
shot again by Stewart, who was following him
closely Smith having no weapon, then closed
on Stewart, felled him to the ground, and assis-
ted III securing him from escape, when he was
at once taken to Jail. Smith died on Friday
morning, and the morning following was bur-


ed Over two hundred persons followed him
to the grave.


Immediately after the funeral the miners held
meeting at the Court House, to take into con-
sideraton the propriety of organizing and try
ing Stewart according to the rules of Judge
Lynch, but being assured on the part of the
county officers that justice should be done, the
meeting adjourned.


On Saturday afternoon Stewards examination
commenced, but was not concluded, on account
of the great excitement prevailing. In the eve
ming another meeting was held, above town,
and resolutions We're adopted to demand the
prisoner on Sunday morning. The Sheriff how
ever, had determined never to release the pris-
oner from his custody, except at the bidding of
the law. and accordingly made every prepara-
ton 10 resist any force that might be brought
against him. tk
The most intense excitement prevailed all Of
Sunday forenoon. AT two o'clock another meet
ing called, at the Court House, and as there
were more people in town than there had been
for long time, disturbance of the most seri-
ous nature was anticipated. Upon trying to pass
resolutions. however, to 90 and take the prisoner
by force, if necessary, the law and order party
out voted the mobocracy. The meeting then
fizzled out Whether it was owing to the rain
at the time, some other canse, unable
to say. Everything then resumed its usual
quietness, save that occasiontd by sundry small
squads of people discussing some point of the
affair. We presume there will be
demonstration on the part of the people. but
that the law will take its course. Let mob be
ever SO we'll meaning it is disgrace to any
community.


Smith has been known here for over year as
a qnIet, peaceable man. He came to this
try from New York in 49, member of Col.
Stevenson's Regiment Stewart is from st.
Louis. Respectfully, Yours."

of his own explanation of his position, and
what does it amount to, after all. Why
that he came here and found Manypenny
unpopular, and therefore we suppose, he
thought it would be popular to abuse him.
For we here reassert, Mr.. Chapman not
only censured Mr.. Manypenny, but that he
spoke of Mr.. McClelland in no very COM
plimentary terms. It is useless for him to
say now his remarks were made upon what
he heard In Leavenworth. Ii he means to
insinuate he heard at this office that Col.
Manypenny was in danger efssLynch Law
we have only to say he got no such lnfor.
nation from us, nor from any one as. we,
believe in any way connected with this office.
Besides we never heard of it,untill we saw
it in the above very remarkable letter. II
he had been told as he now says he was.
that s.lCol. .Manypenny done the best he
possibly could do in making that Treaty.""
why did he not tell the people of it here in
his speech!


We have yet to learn that the people OF
Leavenworth have any quarrel with Col.
Manypenny, and if SO they certainly would
not have applied to Mr.. Chapman to take t
off their hands.


We may have been in error in stating
that Mr.. Chapman connected the admins.
tration with the acts of the agents he so Bit
terly complained of, but certain it ishe COM
mented severely on the course of Manypen-
nv, McClelland and some of the Indian a.
gents, as we reported in our synopsis Of
his speech.


We could have had no object in doing
Mr.. Chapman injustice, for certainly no
man ever considered he was in the way Of
any person. If, as he says, he knew We
were unfriendly TO his election. certainly
we could not have posted him about what
he refers to in his letter, and if he has been
,nisinformed, and thereby led to do injustice
to officers of the Government connected
with the administration, it is his fault not
ours. 1t aUW at least learn him, to keep bet
ter posted up in the future."

Not being subscriber to
your paper, and no mails to the interior of
Kansas Territory, had not the opportunity
of seeing your paper until now, OF the 10th
of November, in which discover an lllr1-
sion made to my speech at your town
( (Leayenworth City. In your synopsis as
you call it, you have done me much injus-
tice I knew you were unfriendly to my
election, but did not suppose, you would
be malicious, merely for the purpose Of O.
pening the way for another candidate.


In regard to Col. Manypenhy and the
Delaware lands, on which your Town site
is located, knew nothing of the difficulty
only what the people of your Town, and
those connected with your office had told
me. They chaged Manypenny with refu-
sing to lei. the Indians make another Trea-
ty, and said if ever he came outhe re again
he was in danger of""Lynch Law"" he was
charged with having ordered the settlersof
the land, and dusing the Military force for
expulsion. This was quarrel between
the people of Leaxenworth and Manypenny,
and not me. As a political man if elected
would examine into their grievances, per-
sonly have no concern about it, I Thought
justly if Manypenny was in danger ofbe-
ing Lynched he had better stay at home IN
his Office. But my opinion as political
man, was that the superior Officers ought
to be held responsible for the misconduct of
agents. said emphaticaly that had been
one ofthe strongest supporters of President
Pierce, and supporters Of the Nebraska Bill,
vet ifthe grievances complained of, had been
committed, it was to him, / would look for re-
dress and hold him responsible, 'sbutmy ad-
vice was to petition Congress for redress""
/ would now ask what possible interest L
could have to take the quarrel Of Leaven-
worth City for disputed half section OF land.
Iknow nothing personally ofthe wrongs COM
planned of. am told by Col. Vanderslice that
Col. Manypenny done the best he possibly
could do IN making that Treaty. ! think"

In the examination of witnesses the stran-
ger eylnced but little ingenuity, as every one
thought. He suffered each one to tell his
story without interruption, though he con-
trIved to make each one tell it over two or
three times. He put some cross questions
which with keen witnesses, only served to
correct their tales and he made notes. which
always tend to embarrass mighty memories.
The examination being ended, as counsel for
the plaintiff he had a right to the opening
speech, but to the astonishment Of every one
ne declined, and permitted the defence to lead
off Then a shadow might have been observ-
ed to fit across the features of Pike and to
darken even the bright eyes Of Prentiss.
They found that they had caught Tartar,
but who he was they found it impossible to
guess.


Col. Ashley spoke first; he dealt the jury
q dish Of tn 1T close dry logic that has render
ed him so famous in the Senate


The poet, Albert Pike, succeeded in a rich
vein Of wit and a hail-torrent Of ridicule,
and you may be sure neither the plaintiff nor
the plaintiffs ragged attorney were forgotten
nor spared.


The great Prentiss concluded for the de-
fendant with glow of gorgeous sentences.
and a final burst of oratory that shook the
house with cheers the jury themselves join
ing. notwithstanding the stern 'order"" of
the bench. Thus susceptible are the South
ern people to the charms of impassioned elo-
quence.


1t was then the strangers turn. He had
been perfectly distracted during all the pre-
vious speeches. Still, straight and motion
less in his seat, his pale smooth forehead
shooting up like a mountain cone of snow ;
but for that eternal twitch that came and
went perpetually across his cheeks, you might
have taken him a mere man of marble, or
man carved in ice. Even his dim, dreary
eyes were Invisible beneath those shaggy eye
brOWs.


But at last he rises before the bar railing,
not behind, and so near the wondering jury
that he might have touched the foreman with
his long bony finger. With eyes half shut,
and rigid as pillar of iron, his thin lips
curl as if in mcasureless scorn, slightly part,
and the voice comes forth. At first it is low
and sweet, insinuating itself into the brain
as an artless tune winding its way into the
deepest heart Ike magic incarnation while
the speaker proceeds without gesture or
the least sign or excitement to tear in pieces
the argument Of Ashley, that melts away at
his touch as frost before the sunbeam Eve
ry one looked surprised. It's logic seemed at
once so brief and SO luminously clear that
the merest peasant could comprehend it,


Anon he came to the dazzling wit Of the
poet lawyer Pike. Then the curl of his lip
grew sharper; his face kindled up, and his
eyes began to open, dreary no longer, but
vivid as lightning, red as fire globes, and
glaring Ike meteors. The soul seemed in
the eye. The full heart streamed out Of tie
face. In five minutes Pixies wit seemed the
acme Of folly, and his finest satire horrible
profanity, contrasted with the inim;table sal
lies and eXterminating scarcasms of the
stranger, interspersed by jest and anecdote
that filed the forum with rOars Of laughter.


Then without so much as hestowing an al
lusioD on Prentss, he turned short on the
perjured witnesses OF Hopkins, tore their tes-
timony TO atcms and hurled in their faces
such terrible invectives that all trembed as
with an ague, and two actually fed dismayed
from the courthouse.


The excitement of the crowd became tre-
mendous. Their united life and soul seemed
to hang on the burning Of the stranger. He
inspired them with his own passions He
saturated them with the poison of his own
malicious feelings. He seemed to have sto-
len Natures long hidden secret of attraction
He was the sun to the sea Of all thought and
emotion which rose and fell as he chose. But
his greatest triumph had yet to come


His eyes began to glare furtively at the
assassin Hopkins, and his lean taper finger
slowly assumed the same direction. He hem
med the wretch with a decentralization of
evidence and impregnable argument, cutting
off all hope of escape. He piled up huge
bastiOns Of unanswerable facts.


He dug beneath the murderer and SANDER
er's feet. bitches that no sophistry could over
leap, and no stretch Of ingenuity evade; and
having thus. as one might say, impounded
his victim. and girt him about like serpent
in circle of fire, he stripped himself for the
work Of massacre.


Oh then, but it was vision both glorious
and dreadful, to behold the orator His ac-
tlons became impetuous as the motion Of an
oak in the hurricane. His voice became
trumpet filled with whirlpools, deafening the
ear with crashes Of power. and yet mingled
all the while with an undersong Of the oft
est cadence. His face was like drunkard's
his forehead giowed like heated furnace
his countenance looked haggard like that
of maniac and ever and anon he flung his
long bVny arms on high as if grasping after
thunderbolts. He drew picture Of murder
IN such appalling colors that in comparison

painted the slanderer so black that the sun
seemed dark when shining upon such an &C
cused monster, and then lie SO fixed both the
portraits on the shrinking brow of Hopkins
that he nailed them there forever. The agi-
tation of the audience nearly amounted to
madness.


All at once the speaker descended from his
perilous height. His voice walled out for
the murdered dead and the living--the beau
tiful Mary-more beautiful every moment
as her tears flowed faster-till men went.
and lovely women scbbed like children.


He closed by strong exhortation to the
jury. and through them to the bystanders.
He entreated the panel, after they should
bring in their verdict for the plaintiff, not to
offer violence to the criminal, however richly
he might deserve it; in other words, ''not to
lynch the villain Hopkins, but leave his pun
ishment to God"" This was the most artful
trick Of all, and best calculated to ensure
vengeance.

sand dollars; and the night afterwards Hop"

of moral leprosy, which can only be hid
den in the grave? The very streams that
gush from the mountain are contaminated
and poisoned, to pander to the lust fol
gold; and yet the voice Of reform is toe
feeble to break the drunken stupor; every
one is too eager in pursuit of gold, to OBJ
serve his fellows staggering down to death
If nothing else can avail, let our Legis
lature pass ""Maine Liquor Law"" or by
some enactment check the traffic in ardent
spirits, and its coadjutor in moral death
gambling. Who has the courage to move
first in the matter? That mans name
will become household word in Cali
fornia, and little children will be taught
by their mothers to con over and spell it
as they do the name Of Howard; and the
sound Of the church-bell, and the silence
round the house of God, will suggest the
name to the worshippers.


And not till these measures are taken
will our towns enjoy the quiet of the holy
Sabbath, nor will the more orderly inhab-
itants be freed from the drunken brawls
and blasphemous orgies, which sound more
like the rawlings of enraged fends than
like human voices. Like Lynch Law, Ii
quor selling and gambling must yield to
good influences, and their votaries must
pursue some other calling or be thrust out
of society. Strange it is that good men,
honorable and upright in their dealings,
will embark in business that has made
so many hearths desolate.


How often is ones ear startled by a
brawl in the street, where the young inc
briate is appearing perhaps for the first
time, in state of beastly intoxication.
Here he is free from the stigma which
society elsewhere places on the name that
has been connected with riotous assem-
blages; he has nothing but principle and
self-reliance to sustain him, and if his feet
slip he may recover without being brand
ed as drunkard. In this false security
he goes on, step by step, until that burn
ing, quenchless thirst, eats out his life.
Even in the faces of men of talent, whose
intellects grapple with the subtlest sub
jects, the plague-spot Of intemperance
may be seen; you observe the bleared eye
and faltering voice, yet they are too proud
to acknowledge that they are in the power
of monster that is gradually crushing
them in its folds.


But | must stop this homily, or you
will be advising me to take the stump and
begin a crusade against the prevailing
vices of the day. Do not, however, do
me the injustice to think me one of those
misguided zealots, who would throw aside
all womanly modesty, and rail at the wick
ed world from the rostrum. 1t is only
while seated in front of my own fre-side,
that | would appeal to the better feelings
that still linger round the heart of Califor-
nians-the same feeling that is revived
when the last goodbye recurs to memory.
1t is painful to think how many watchers
there are, watching with hopeful hearts
for the return of the gold hunter, with his
sunburned face and hardened hands, and
sack Of gold, that is to add comfort to their
home. Little does the wife and mother
think that her husband is half demented
vagabond, flinging down his last dollar on
the gambling table or fishing up the last
quarter for rum. | thank God that the
blight has not fallen upon our house, but
cannot forget that many wife and aged
mother will watch in vain for the coming
of their hearts idol and should some good
angel snatch him away now, and set him
down by her fre-side, do you think that
aged woman could trace in his bloated fea-
lures and swollen eyes, the features of her
idolized boy? God pity thee, good wo.
man your son may return, but with crime
and debauchery stamped on his face, try
ing to flee from himself, trying to quench
the fire that is burning in his brain, wild
and unconquerable as the fire sweeping
across the prairie.

Huence, and milk and water poets and lee
turers have beggared their invention IL

who have grown so habituated TO danger ard

not surprising that there should be many

George Wilkes, for Mr.. Washburn and Messrs
Wake, Briarly and Philip L. Herbert, for Mr.
Washington. At the first fire, Mr.. Washburn's
rifle went off in the air, and his antagonist
lowered his weapon without firing 1t was

Atthe second fire Mr.. Washburn's ball struck
the ground, some yards in advance of his ad-

from the American Valley, that case of
lynching recently occurred at Black Hawk


1t seems that Jim Catron, whose claim among


Cthers, We recently noticed as vie ding a


large profit, had saved his dust. run in debt
ior provisions, and borrowed varions sums
from different persons, until he concluded he
had his pile and made up his mind TO leave


He got as far as the mouth OF Nelson Greek
when he was oyerhauled by some of his cred
itors and taken back. He was advised to set :
tie with those he was owing, and admit his
ability to do so, but refused, stating that he
would rather die than give up his money!
They then gave him thirty ashes, well laid
on. lie then promised to pay them, and they
started with him, to the place where he had
concealed his funds. lie then informed them
that the money had been taken away. If we
understood our informant correctly, they
gave him thirty more lashes. and let him go.
He has since been heard of in the neighbor-
hood, and it is thought he will not leave until
has chance to secure his il-acquired and
worse kept treasure. He owed something
like seven or eight hundred dollars. He was
doing well, but could not stand prosperity.
He would have made a good Broderick man."

nell. OF the largest, most desirable and
valuable tracts of land ever Offered for
sale in Little Creek Hundred, consisting
of EOUR FARMS, in one body, and con
tanning, in the aggregate, 1902 acres.


No. 1. A farm containing 1924 acres,
called the ""Bacon FARM about one half
of which is well set in valuable timber !;
large portion OF which is heart pine Of
the best quality. There is pfobably
more of this rare and valuable species of
timber on this tract than is to be found
upon any other of equal size in the Hun
dred. Besides which there is an ahun-
dance Of oak and other varieties of tin,-
Der. and the land is of excellent quality.
This farm adjoins the lands of Henry Ba-
con, Nathaniel Hearn, Alfred Adams
Josiah Cordry, and No. 4, hereinafter
described


No, Q. A farm, containing 1884 acres,
called the ""McGee Farui,"" with very
superior soil, unexcelled in natural ferfil-
ity by that of any farm in the Hundred.
This farm has long been celebrated as
one of the best corn-growing farms III
the State, and though it has late been
much neglected and impoverished, such
are its recuperative properties, that with
a trifling expenditure for lime, and clear
ing bitches, it would very soon regain its
former character, and rank among the
most productive and profitable farms in
the State. About one-third of this farm
is well SET in valuable oak and pine tim
ber large part Of which might be sold
off. This farm is adjoining lands of Jo-
sah Cordry, John Lynch, Burton w
Galway, Hannnh Morris, and Nos. ]
and 8.


No. 8. A farm containing 109 acres,
called the ""Culver Farm, adjoining lands
of Hannah Morris, aad Nos. l. 2 and 4.
1t is very neat little farm, with soil
of good quality, and timber amply sutfi-
cient for all the necessary purposes of
farm.


No. 4. A farm of513 acres, called the
""Polk Farm The soil of this farm is
naturally good, and though much worn
by continued cultivation without manure.
it is very susceptible Of great and rapid
improvement. It's chief value, however.
consists in its immense quantity Of val
liable timber, more than half the tract
being set in very fine timber which off
ers rare chance for an enterprising man
TO realizs handsome fortune by erecting
thereon a steam saw.nill. This tract
adioins the lands OF Hannah Morris, Han
dy Beach, John N. Z. Galloway, Clay
ton Kinney, Thos. W. Records, and Nos.
1,2, and 8, above described.


All of the above. described land is sit.
uated about 81 miles south from the
Gourishing town of Laurel, the greatest
business place in the country, and is in
a good and healthy neighborhood, con-
venient to schools, mills, churches, &c.


The Delaware Railroad when extern
ded through to Laurel and Salisbury
TO Ami Messic, or Cherry Stone, las it
certainly will be, at no distant day,) will
pass directly through this body of land,
which from all past experience must in
evitably enchance the value of this and
all other land through or near 10 which
ii may run With all these advantages
combined, ii may well be said, that these
lands hold out inducements to purchasers
which are very rarely offered in this Sec
tion of county.


The Buildings and other improvements
on all the farms are in tollcrable condi-
tion, and each farm has good Apple
Orchard and other choice fruit trees.


The old Mill Seat, OF about one acre,
commonly called the cold Mill"" be-
tween the Bacon ard Polk farms, will be
reserved and decided to the purchaser of
the McGee Farm, to protect said last
mentioned farm from flooding with wa
ter, by erecting mill thereon.


No. s. A Town Lot in the town of
Laurel, called the cooper Shop Lot""
containing about hall an acre. II has a
small frame Dwelling House stauding op-
on it and is a desirable location for a
building lot.


The terms will be made 10 suit the
purcha er, aSmy object IN disposing Of
this valuable real estate is to change
property which requires much attention
out of my power TO give, into security
requiring little or no attention. but pay
ing regular annual interest. Judgment
note with approved security will be re-
quired, and ii no understanding, in re-
gard 10 terms is entered into by the pur-
chaser before the sale, instalments with
interest annually on the whole amount
unpaid.


For plot ofthe land and other infor-
nation call on c. c. Windsor, Esq, at
Laurel, or on the subscriber.

the Alexandria Gazette, sends the following to
that paper, with appropriate vouchings of its
truth:


At the breaking of ground for the commence
ment of the Lynchburg and Tennessee Railroad
at Lynchburg, the Rev. J. E., by appointment
acted chaplain on the occasion. At the time
appointed for prayer, the chaplain raised his
hand, Let pray In an instant all hats were
doffed, and the chaplain commenced slowly
and solemnly, to read very appropriate man
ascript prayer, which he had previously pre-
pared During the reading OF the paper an old
negro man, who had been engaged with his
spade resting, with one foot the spade
and his arms on the handle, looking intently in
the chaplain's face. At the conclusion of the
prayer, the old negro, Strengthening himself up,
remarked audiby: well, l reckon dats de fust

14_1854-07-22_p2_sn93052117_00279557955_1854072201_0119,The weekly Placer herald.,01,1854-07-22,p2,,,"ton adjourned sine die.


The assemblage at Carpenters Hall, as
we find from the papers, nominated Mes
srs Latham and McDougal the present
incumbents, for Congress, and Mr.. w ood-
side to the cerkship of the Supreme
Court. The nomination OF these gentle
men to Congress is the asst trick of the
consprators. They know full well that
neither of these gentlemen desire or VIII
accept, under existing circumstances,
nomination and particularly from that
faction.


But they hope to draw of many of the
democracy from the support OF the regu-
lar ticket, by placing their names before
the public, whilst these gentlemen are in
Washington City, and cannot be heard
from, until after the election. Fortunate
ly, we understand, there are plenty of evil
dences in this State of their determina-
tion not to become candidates., and these
will be given to the world in due time


Fellow-Democrats, our candidates are
before you, they are gentlemen of spotless
putaton and excellent rtptclry.


Rally to their support. We have
double enemy to fight, but no false friends
to stab us, in the moment of vicory.


The conspirators and wings are both in
the field, but all before us, let us


""Nail to the mast our holy flag,


Set every thread bare sail y


And vindicdte the justice of our cause,
or die with our faces to the foe.


The last issue of the Placer Democrat
contains series of editorials, singularly
rare and undignified. There, for instance,
is the ""Attempt to bribe delegate""
The writer starts out with the remark,
that correspondent of this paper charges
Mr.. Tuttle with having cast the vote of
Thomas Belcher in the county convention,
and that he, Belcher, is not a naturaized
citizen. The fact as charged by the Her.
AIDS correspondent is not denied, hut it
is attempted to hide their shame under
great noise about bribery. ""Several
prominent Boilers waited upon Mr..
Belcher,"" and attempted to buy a vote
which they charged to lie illegal and
which the Democrat does not deny this
is the charge as set forth in their columns.


We have in our possession some very
reliable Information in regard to MIR.
BeIcher's course, and we desire him and
the editor of the Democrat to make the
charge Of bribery in some specific form
name the time, place and men-and then
we promise such refutation as will si
lence the foul sander forever.


The next choice bit of editorial fungus,
is the comments upon our correspondent
of Lynch's precinct, headed by Capt
Thompson, are alluded to- as Il set of ruff
fans. This imported scribbler assumes
to know more of the transactions at that
place than the gentlemen who were pres
ent, and has the unblu>hing inlpudence to
brand as good citizens AS there are in Cal
itornia, with the name of ruffian


The editor regrets exceedingly his want
of time and space to notice our Iowa Hill
correspondent We do to. Doubtless he
would have produced ii regular tit bIt of
low flung >curriIIty-at such composition
his genius would have reve ed i'm IA glorl-
Gus field. However, he satisfied himself
by informing ""a Jeffersonian Democrat""
that thunderboIt could he hurled at him,
that certainly would anIIIhilate al ''his
sort"" at one blow, and for the present re-
fers him to the crusher in the State Jour
nal.


Stand by to dodge, my brave .Ief1erso-
nian, there's heavy Jumps coming.


Next in the category is the ""audacious
proceedings at Dotan's Bar


At this precinct they we're badly disap-
pointed, and therefore their defeat be-
comes an ""audacious proceeding"" and the
Editors account of that proceeding forms
quite a picturesque view of puddle in
thunderstorm.


We are not aware that the seats of the
two gentlemen who represented this pre-
cinct in the convention were disputed,
and we cannot see the object of all this
TRADE.


We are authorized to say that it is not
true, that the person with whom the no.
tice was left, for the election, was request

their error, and bitter denOunce the
little clique of wire -pu' Hers who latored
so strenuouSly to get up the convention.
| After sending their eniSarieS al over the
County Gpr several weeks, when the day
arrived which was to see demolished the
old Committee, 10 on'y t,centy -four del
egates made their appearance. ne con-
ventOn was so lneagre IN numbers, that
orders were given by a leading member
of the trio, to form themselves into a
mass meeting, which is something unu-
>uaI in any regular County Convention.
| Ii is needless to say that the orders given
were Immediately carried into effect, and
runners Dispatched to bring in anybody
| and everybody to make as they said, ""a
respectable show"" This heterogeneous
mass, thus co ected together. took upon
themselves the responsibility of voting
our of the party certain members of your
committee, and actually haG the audacity
| 10 select a spurious committee. With
portion of the gentlemen who composed
that convention we find no fault. They
were innorenty led into it hy the arch in
| triguers, office seekers and hangers on
who got it UP.


Another false issue is attempted to be
raised by these psuedo democrats, wiz
| That some of the democrats who com
! pose the old committee, and the only legal
one in the county, voted the whig ticket
at the last election. The charge is false
| false as the heart is base, which utterS it,
| that any gentleman composing the com
mttee ever voted other than democratic
trket. 1t is needless for Us to 60 into any
defence of our political conduct Many
of us have resided in PAGER County be-
fore it was organized. We have often
fought the good fight together in days
gone by, and now hope that no miSrepre-
Sentations of ii clique, many of whom
have iattened upon the labors of the
democratic party, can affect your course
in the coming campaign.


But, who are these holters of demo-
cratic princi pies, who attempt to read
men ont of the democratic party? Why,
they are such men as Philip Lynch, the
repued editor Of diSorganiziug sheet
published at Auburn-a man always
ready to do the bidding and dirty work of
his masters, and who was one of the pub
fishers of the Index, a Wing paper at
Sacramento City, and who was the agent





vemher-the author of the caIl-Lay,
more, after using strenuous eXertions to
obtain IA nomination at the last County
Convention, in which he only received
six votes, which made him so indignant
that he wished ''the Democratic party
might go to hell, he would never ask them
for another Office"" and abused Mr.. Fair
| field, his opponent in convention, in un-
measured terms, and on the day of cleo
tion actually voted against him and for
! Mr.. Crary, one of the Wing candidates
/ for the legislature. If the democratic
party is now divided, it is through the
agency of such men as the above, and not
by any attempt or wish of your commit
tee.


These disorganizers have had timely
warning what their suicidal course was
| likely to end in. From the time the
Senatorial question was first thrown into
! the party as fire brand to distract us,
I we foresaw what was likely to he the re-
suit and as early as the 3rd of November
! last, u>t previous to the ASS ,mhling of
| the Broderlrk convention, your committee
| issued hand bill setting forth what was
the ostensible object of that Convention
and cautioned you to beware of tt
! Our statement at that time was denied hy
the ''rule or ruin' faction. who called that
Covention-tine has long since verified
the truth of the statements we then set
forth. Your committee have done all in
their power to keep the party together,
without sacrificing every principle Of
right and Justice.


Every step that this boiling faction
have recently pursued, has h d Il tendency
to still further widen the breach between
us. Not content with prescribing t'roml
nent Democrats, and their agitation of the
Senatorial question, they must raise hy
subscription among the unhoIy alliance,
the means of purchasing IA small printing
press and establishing II paper As but
very few Democrats ever see the sheet
referred to, we would state for their in
formation that, from week to week it
teens with the gros>est talSehoods and
abuse of your Committee and al 9th
er Democrats who have had III. inde
pendenre to oppose di>organizarion and
corruption. Does such conduct as this
oOk like wishing to harinoni>e The party.
Every Democrat will answer, No!


Democrats, place no reliance in the
hollow hearted pretenSons OF these men.

reSentatinn, that it is impossible for them
to speak well of amy one who may he

retired, and the meeting took a recess tor
half an hour.


Upon re-assembling the committee pre-
sented the following preamble and reso!u-
tions, which were unanimously adopted:


Whereas, We have seen with feelings
of regret, a want of harmony existing
among the Democratic members of the
legislature in relation to the election OF
United States Senator, and believing that
discord in any great political action is
pregnant with evil, and subversive OF the
best interests of our party, which we con-
ceive to be identical with the true inter-
ests of our State; and believing that the
principles Of Democracy have always
taught an acquiescence to the will OF the
majority, in all bodies and in all cases;
and observing that ma jority of the rep
resentatves of Placer county have ex-
pressed themselves in favor Of the cleo
ton of u 5. Senator during the pres
ent session Of the Legislatures; and also
believing that a majority of the Placer
county Democracy are III favor OF the
same, and that the opposition to the mea-
sure has originated in great degree with
those who used their exertions and in
fluence to defeat us in the hard fought
campaign of last fail. Therefore,


Resolced, That the Democracy of this
Township have full confidence in the abll-
ity and honesty of our members OF the
Legislature, and would Willingly have left
the matter to them, as their legitimate
business, if we were not called upon to
give expression to our opinions.


Resoiued, That we now earnestly ex-
press our opinion, and recommend to our
LEGISLATORS, to use their influence to Sc
cure the election Of a u. ;. Senator du'
ring the present session.


Resoloed, That it is our opinion, thai
anv other course would tend seriously t6
iniure the influence and energy OF ou'
party hereafter, and thus exert banefu
influence on the best interests OF ou
adopted and beloved State.


After the adoption of the foregoing pre-
ambe and resolutions, the meeting wa
addressed for the space of about tw'
hours, by w. B. Greer, Esq, Judg
Lynch, Col. G. G. Newman and other
who were frequently applauded by tn
meeting.


On motion it was


Resolved, That these proceedings t
signed by the officers and published in tn
Democratic State journal, with reques
that the Young America, Marysville Ex
press, Stockton Post, Placer Herald, AM
San Francisco Times and Transcrlp
copy the same.

DEMOCRACY OF PLACER COUNTY.",20 The,"


Fellow DEMocRArs:-- The following
IS the report of a Committee appointed at
a meeting of the Central Committee, held
in Auburn on the 29th ut., to draft an
Address to the Democracy, which they
beg leave to submit for your perusal.


As most Of you feIlow-democrats, who
reside out of the town of Auburn, where
nearly all the schemes have been .concOct-
ed which now divide the party IN this
county, may not he aware of the original
cause of the difficulty we propose in this
brief article to set them forth fully and
canddIy before you.


In accordance with long established
usages of the Democratic party, at the
last County Convention Central Com
mittee was chosen until the next annual
convention In that convention which Sc
lected them, no opposition was made to
any member placed on that committee,
aud for time every thing went smoothly
on-al acting in concert together.-
Shortly previous to the last election,
your committee had occasion to meet
a majority convened, and on mo-
ton of Col. Mcclure, of Yankee jim,
Philip w. Thomas was elected Chair
t0du. mo uitIlCuItN OCCuiCu III tHC COIj-
mittee until after the election, when a re
fractory and disorganizing spirit began to
manifest itself, owing to the fact that ""A
large portion of the committee could not
be induced to join with another portion IN
recommending the election Of a United
States Senator before the proper time, con-
trary, as we believe, to the wishes of
nne-tenths of the people. Indignant be
cause of our refusal to join in this Sena-
tOral movement, portion OF them bolted
from the old committee and issued a cal
for a convention, to he held in the town of
Auburn on the 18th November last
This bOting convention assembled, and
under the guise of democracy, without
explaining the real object Of the movers
who got it up (Which was the endorse
ment of the Senatorial move,) induced a
few sound democrats to participate in its
proceedings, who now hearti Y repent of
their error, and bitterly denounce the
little clique of wire-pu'lers who labored
so strenuously to get up the convention.
After sending their enissaries al over the
County for several weeks, when the day
arrived which was to see demolished the
old Committee, 10 only tocenly -four del
egates made their appearance. = The con
vention was so meagre in numbers, that
orders were given by a leading member
of the trio, to form themselves into a
mass meeting, which is something unu
sual in any regular County Convention.
1t is needless to say that the orders given
were Immediately carried into effect, and
runners dispatched to bring in anybody
and everybody to make as they said, ''a
respectable show"" This heterogeneous
mass, thus collected together, took upon
themselves the responsibility of voting
out Of the party certain members OF your
committee, and actually had the audacity
to select spurious committee. With a
portion of the gentlemen who composed
that convention we find no fault. They
were innocently led into it by the arch in
triguers, office seekers and hangers on
who got it up. ...... ...


Another false issue Is attempted to be
raised by these psuedo democrats, viz
That some of the democrats who com
pose the old committee, and the only legal
Que in the county, voted the whig ticket
at the last election. The charge is false
false as the heart is base, which utters it,
that any gentleman composing the com
mittee ever voted other than democratic
ticket. 1t is needless for us to 90 into any
defence Of our political conduct Many
of us have resided in Placer County be-
fore it was organized. We have often
fought the good fight together in days
gone by, and now hope that no misrepre-
sentations of clique, many of whom
have fattened upon the abors Of the
democratic party, can affect your course
in the coming campaign.


But, who are these boilers of demo-
cratic principles, who attempt to read
men out of the democratic party? Why,
they are such men as Philip Lynch, the
reputed editor Of disorganizng sheet
published at Auburn-a man always
ready to do the bidding and dirty work Of
his masters, and who was one of the pub
fishers of the Index, Wing paper at
Sacramento City, and who was the agent
to get up the little convention Of last No.
vember-the author Of the call-nay,
more, after using strenuous eXertions to
obtain nomination at the last County
Convention, in which he only received
six votes, which made him so indignant
that he wished ssthe Democratic party
might 60 to hell, he would never ask them
for another office,' and abused Mr.. Fair
field, his opponent in convention, in un-
measured terms, and on the day of e.ec-
ton actually voted against him and for
Mr.. Crary, one of the Wing candidates

colored, who plunged it against the door, until
it was stove in. Meantime, several brickbats
had been thrown at the windows, and the glass
ratified in all directions. The leaders, or those
those who appeared to act ringleaders in the
melee, continually shouted: ""Rescue him 7""
Bring him out 70 6Bring him out !"" ""Where
is he!"" de-, &c. The court house bell rung an
alarm at halfpast nine o'clock.


When the doors were opened, two or three
persons rushed into the entry, but the officers
in the building, who were mustered in full
force on the stairs, gave the valorous rioters so
warm reception with the clubs and swords,
that they quickly retreated to the streets. Two
shots were discharged in the entry, which ap.
peared to intimidate the rioters somewhat, and
they retreated to the opposite side of the street.
AT this time, q large deputation Of police from
the Centre watch house, arrived upon the
ground, and in a few moments arrested seve-
raj persons, and took them to the watch house.
Stones were occasionally thrown at the win
dows, and shouts continued to be made, but
the firm stand Of the officers stationed within
the building, with the support they received
from the police, prevented any further demon
stration.


The saddest part Of this outrage on the part
of the mob rests in the fact that human life has
been sacrificed.


At the time the mob beat down the westerly
door of the courthouse, several men, employed
as United States officers were in the passage
way, using their endeayors to prevent the in.
gress Of the crowd, and among the number was
Mr.. James Batchelder, truckman, in the en-.
ploy of Colonel Peter Dunbar, who, almost at
4 fha met nf ha IF fhaI
pistol-shot (evidently very heavy charge,)
in the abdomen. Mr.. Batchelder uttered the
exclamation, /"" I'm stabbed and, falling back
into the arms Of watchman Isaac Jones, ex-
pired almost Immediately. The unfortunate
man resided in Charestown, where he leaves a
wife and one or two children to mourn his un-
timely death.


At the time of forcing the door, and just as
the fatal shot was fired, one of the rioters, who
was standing on the upper step, exclaimed to
the crowd, +"" You towards, will you desert US
now?"" At this moment the exclamation of Mr..
Batchelder, I'm stabbed, was heard, and the
rioters retreated to the opposite side of the
street.


In the meantime white man rushed into the
crowd and distributed several meat axes, with
the blades enveloped in the original brown pa
pers. Two or three of these axes were subse-
quently picked up by the officers, and were de-
posted in the centre watch-house.


Shortly after the death of Mr.. Batehelder
Coroner Smith took charge of the body, and
will hold an inquest to-day.


After the arrest had been made, the crowd,
although excited, remained quiet, but new
element was introduced by the arrival of a mill
tary company. The Boston artillery, Captain
Evans, were in the streets for their usual drill.
When they marched up Court street, the mob
at once supposed them to be the United States
marines, come to preserve ORDER and they were
at once saluted with Kisses, groans, and other
marks Of derision. Captain Evans, seeing an
excited crowd and not knowing anything Of the
Immediately marched his com
mand down the west side of the courthouse,
and halted in the square, the crowd giving way.
When the cause Of the appearance Of the com
pany was explained, the crowd gave them three
cheers. and the company departed.


By order of the mayor, the Boston artillery
and the Columbian artillery were ordered out,
and about midnight they took quarters in City
Hall, where they remained during the night,
waiting further orders.


A large force of officers were detained for
duty during the night outside the court house,
md throughout the whole evening and night,
an additional strong force was inside fully
armed and prepared for any emergency.


Such arrangements have been made by the
United States marshal and by chief of police
Taylor, together with the orders of the mayor,
that any and all attempts at rescuing the fngi.
tive, or creating an evildisposed mob will be
met with the most certain and successful de-
eat


The examination of the fugitive now in Gus
'ody will be resumed at o'clock this morning,
Monday,) and none who are knowing to the
acts, doubt that justice will be administered
Ind the laws Of the country duly executed.


The Washington Union Of Sunday says:


The following despatch was received in this
,ity yesterday morning about Il o'clock:

iouse last night, for the purpose of rescuing

Men Shot By DR.. Linton, formerly Of The y.
S. Nacy-Li,,ton Lynched.-We have learned
from several persons who have recently arrived
from Laredo, that most shocking affair oc-
Cured in that place about two weeks since.
Achilles Centro, an Italian, and Don Pedro
Carera, a Mexican, were killed by DR.. Lin
ton. The former was band master of the 9Th
regiment of infantry, and the latter principal
of the Mexican Maroma and It was during Don
Pedros exhibition that he was killed.


There are various reports in circulation rela-
tive to this transaction, and the only definite
conclusion we can arrive at from all the inform
alton received is, that two men we're murdered
without any apparent cause or provocation, and
the murderer hung, under the solemn condem-
nation and sentence of his honor Judge Lynch.
We have been informed that the difficulty by
which three persons were launched into eter-
nifty grew out of an insult given by the doctor
to the wife of the band master, who was pre-
sent at the exhibition.


The band master reprimanded the doctor for
the insult, the latter retired for moment, but
Immediately returned with his pistol, and in
attempting to shoot Centro, shot Don Pedro at
the first fire, who had placed himself between
the parties in endeavoring to quiet the distur-
Dance. Inc SecOnd bnOt ne killed Centr0.
After committing this bloody deed, he escaped
to The west side of the Rio Grande, but on COM
mtting another outrage, as stated, on the Mex
ican side of the river. he was apprehended by
the alcalde and placed in the calaboso.


The next day the citizens of Laredo held q
meeting and appointed committee to cross
the river and demand Linton Of the Mexican
authorities. The alcalde refused to give him
up, but informed those who composed the COM
mittee, that if they would 60 the calaboso about
nine o'clock, a. m, the key would be found in
the door. They did SO, and removed Linton
from the Jail, and brought him over to this side
of the river, erected gallows upon the public
plaza, and hung him that night. Thus termi-
mated the existence Of man who has hereto
fore figured in nearly all grades and conditions
Of life, an accomplished scholar and eminent
physician.


DIR. Linton, il is said, was formerly surgeon
in the United States navy, and was on board
the brig Somers when Spencer was hung. We
believe that he was one Of the witnesses who
testified. upon the trial Of Commander McKen-
zie on the part Of the defence.


Since writing the above, we have been in
formed that the citizens Of Laredo had nothing
to do with the lynching, it being altogether
confined to the soldiers. After his execution,
it is reported that the body was horribly mutt
lated by the soldiers-such was the intense ex-
citement against the deceased."

persons saved the town. Such is the appre-

suspicion Of having set fire to the building;
box Of matches and other combustible
matter was found in his possession, and he
was committed to Jail. Within the last
few weeks there have been three or four
alarms, and in every instance with good
reason. It is generally supposed that it

 These reflections are unjust, as is usually the case with the censures of that paper. The sheriff, MT. Crawford, did all in his power to arrest the violence of the mob and to save the life of the prisoner On Saturday night he pre- vented company from forcing the iail and taking the negro Waiting for several days for more such demonstrations and not hearing of any, he started for this place with prisoner sentenced to the penitentiary at the last sitting of the circuit court. On his way he met the mob going to Benton, immediately returned. and was only beaten to the jail house by the necessity which compelled him to go by his house to get his gun. He reached the iail, however, before it was broken open, and did everything to prevent such a result He call- ed upon the posse comitatus in vain. He even threatened to take life, but the crowd was so much excited that they could not be controll- ed. They caught the sheriff and his deputy and held them until the deed was perpetrated

 We understand from citizens of Saline that the sheriff is held bameless even by the most uncharitable of his enemies. He did all in his power to prevent the enactment of the trage- dy.

 It is nothing more than what we would ex- pect from the courage and honor of such man as Wm. A. Crawford."

13_1854-08-04_p2_sn84026884_00279557487_1854080401_0744,The Nevada journal.,01,1854-08-04,p2,George w. Hall.,,"During the past week petition has
been in circulation praying the Governor
to pardon George "". Hall, who is now
lying in our county Jail, awaiting the &c &c
ton of the Supreme Court. In August
last this Hall was arrested for the murder
of a Chinaman. In September, he was
tried and found guilty of the murder; but
his friends insisted that his trial was not
satisfactory, and he then insisted, and still
insists that he is innocent of the CRIME -
We do not intend to decide, or even give
an opinion ON his probable innocence or
guilt. But his detention in our county
Jail has been protracted to such an extent
that sympathy in his behalf, in this COM
munity, has, we fear, almost lost sight of
the matter of fact; and as the case has
been delayed so far beyond a reasonable
or even excusable time, we now have rea-
son to apprehend wilful if not intentional
neglect on the part of the Supreme Court,
and many are led to the belief that this
neglect will be continued for an indefinite
time. We are not, in the abstract, favor
able to lynch law; but on the contrary
think It better TO suffer great many evils
from regularly constituted authofiitt;;ccss,
than to put the execution of laws, or the
punishment of crimes into the hands of an
excited populace,


But when these authorities are found
wholly inadequate to the duties devolving
upon them whether their inadequacy
arises from weakness or from bad motives
and when their duties are neglected and
the limits of their legitimate authority dis
regarded, so very often, we cannot hell but
think it sometimes is the part of mercy, for
the populace to refuse to give criminal
up to those authorities. There are ex-
ceptions to the rule of weakness or cor
Tuption that prevails so extensively among
our judicial officers but these exceptions,
from the predominance of incompetent
superiors, become mere cats-paws in their
hands; who, after having commenced the
performance of ary duty, are arrested in
their labors by an order purporting to come
from higher authority, and which they are
bound to obey-tnus rendering the SER
vices Of what few honest men VIC have,
entirely useless in any important case.


1t has been suggested to us. and we are
inclined to believe, that pardon from the
Governor could not issue, under existing
circumstances. He and his friends con-
tend that he is not guilty, and they have
formally declared that innocence, Which,
in the eyes of the law at least, makes it
matter of uncertainty, whether he is guilty
or not. If he be innocent, he has right,
by legal investigation, to prove that inno-
cencc. But should the Governor pardon
him, and thus place legal investigation
out OF his power, he must go forth into the
world with the indelible stain Of murder
upon him; and the fingered scorn will be
pointed at him-aad the unimpeached
records of Nevada county will justify them
in. saying she is a murderer"" convicted Of
his crime, but through the influence of
sympathising friends, who operated upon
the mind OF weak Governor, was torn
from the officers Of the law, and cast out
upon the community, without any cxcul
patton, or suffering any penalty of the
law


This, then, instead Of charity, would
fastening upon him disgrace of which
1t would be utterly impossible for him evcl
TO escape so that if he be innocent, a:
alledged, a pardon now, would be to him
the most utter ruin, beside setting pre-
cedent of executive pardon that could moi
help but result in the worst consequences


But another view of this matter should
have some influence in fastening the action
of the Supreme Court. The trial of KaI
cost this county something near $4,000
and ever since that time, now about eleven
months, he has been regular expense o
nearly SlOO per month. And for wha
purpose Not that the prisoner asks this
time to enable him to get witnesses, or to
prepare for trial-not that it is necessary
thus to kill time, for him to recover from"

is sometimes said to be worse than his legal
thraldom in the slave States; but this is only
one Of the many spurious pretexts Of the advo-
oates Of q cruel and depraved institution. The
communities Of the North do not burn negroes
nor oan such deed be contaminated where
Slavery is not.


The Nstchez Free Trader contains an ac-
count Of o scene OF this character, which was
witnessed near that city but a few days ago.


""The slave, according to the account, struck
iohite man, and the people Of that region, not
waiting for Justice to take its course inflict-
ed Lynch law. The victim was chained TO q
tree, fagots we're placed around him. When
the people had arranged the pile, in reply to
question If he had anything TO say, he is re-
ported TO have warned all slaves to take exam
pie by him, and asked the prayers Of those
around. He then asked for q drink of water
and after quafkng it said-t Now set fire | am
ready to 90 in peace When the flames be-
gan to burn him, in his agony he showed gi-
gantic strength, and actually forced the staple
from the tree, and bounded from the burning
mass! But he instantly fell, pierced with rifle
balls and then his body was thrown into the
flames and consumed, to show that no such be-
ing had ever existed Nearly four thousand
SLAVES from the neighboring plantations were
present. Numerous speeches icere made By the
magistrates and ministers of religion 10 The
slapes soarning them that The same fate otcaited
them If they proed rebeiiious to their o,oners.""


Who can peruse such narratives as this with
out awe and horror? What American can
contemplate this deep and damning stain upon
our country's fame without modification and
shamea How can civilized and Christian men
and women lift up their voices in the support
of an institution that calls for such practices
and fosters such feelingsi 1t is dreadful,
horrible recital. 1t is disrcputable and dis
graceful to the South, whose interests and
whose fears prompt to such deeds but how in
fnitely more foul and demoniac il the spirit in
the North, where such motives do not operate,
that can basely yield it's aid, not only in sus-
tanning the institution Of Slavery, but in aid
ing to extend il over regions now free from its
dark reproachf Opportunely this wretched
and miserable narrative comes from the South,
as an overwhelming appeal to the Legislators Of

In excited times, weak men become foo Is,
and eviLdisposed men williams. The first be-
come the victims of the last. Fanaticism
seizes upon both, and what in one case becomes
folly, in the other case becomes crime. Both
are rendered furious and frantic. Whenever
any question arises in this country that involves
the subject of slavery, the abolitionists and
agitators seize hold of it with blind passion,
and run entirely mad with fanaticism. They
claim that their great object is philanthropy,
and to promote that object they think that they
are released from all the obligations Of honor
and Of common truthfulness. Like all fanatics,
they believe, or affect to believe that the end
ustifes the means;"" that they may do wrong
in order that good may come of it. One of
their favorite modes of exciting the members
of their vile and pestilent crew is to strike off
and circulate pictures of slaves in chains, on
the gallows, under the lash, or in consuming
flames. Another is to coin, rake up, print and
circulate heartrending accounts of the barba-
rous cruelty of masters to slaves Children at
the north are thus taught to abhor the south,
women are impressed with the same prejudice,
and ignorent men who read nothing but what
is brought to, and forced on them, catch the
same feeling.


In the whole north, there is no more danger
Gus, unscrupulous and virulent enemy to the
peace of this country, to the institutions OF
this country, to the Constitution of this coun-
try, than that talented, but disorganiz;ng and
crazy journal, the New York Tribune 1t is
thoroughly unsound and diseased. II is un-
sound in religion, in morals, in manners, and
in politics. In its love of liberty it runs into
licentousness, in its hatred Of law, it runs into
Iawlessness. 1t tforgets thatto all human things
the law of limit applies, and it loses sight of
the old saying that extremes meet. But to the
point.


The Tribune Of the 7th of February, with the
view we presume of getting up among the
northern people an excitement against their
brethren of the south, and thus injuring the
success of the Nebraska bill published the fol-
lowing:


""a SLAVE BURNED TO DEATH.-A mob was
collected together and lynch court was held
to determine what was best to be done with a
negro who had the. impudence to raise his hand
against white man. The lynch court decided
that he should be burned at the stake. A
Natchez paper, the Free Trader, giving an ac-
count of it, says the negro was taken and
chained to tree Immediately on the banks OF
the Mississippi, on what is called Union Point.
Fagots were then collected and piled around
him, to which he appeared quite Indifferent.
When the work was completed, he was asked
what he had to say. He then warned all to
take example by him, and asked the prayers
of all around. He then called for drink Of
water, hich was handed him; he drank it and
said Now set fire, | am ready to go in peace
The torches were lighted and placed in the
pile, which was soon ignited. He watched un-
moved the curling fame, that grew until it be-
gan to entwine itself around and fix upon his
body, and then he sent forth cries Of agony,
painful to the ear, begging some one to blow
his brains out at the same time struggling with
almost superhuman strength, until the staple
with which the chain was fastened to the tree
(not being well securely drew out and he leaped
from the burning pile. At that moment the
sharp ringing of several rifles were heard, and
the body of the negro fell corpse on the
ground. He was picked up by some two or
three and again thrown into the fire and con-
sumed, not vestige remaining to show that
such a being ever existed. Nearly four thou
sand slaves were collected from the plantations
in the neighborhood to witness this scene. Nu-
merous speeches were made by the magistrates
and ministers Of religion, to the large concourse
of slaves, warning them, and telling them that
the same fate awaited them if they should prove
rebellious to their owners""


The above extract went the rounds of the
abolition and freesoil press. 1t was eagerly
caught up and circulated everywhere. 1t bore
upon its face strong evidences Of truth. 1t was
minutely circumstantial. 1t purported to be
taken from the Natchez Free Trader.


1t is, however, one of those. base frauds that
unscrupulous men will get up in times of ex.
element. Il has some foundation, but in all
its particulars is essentially false. The aboli.
tionists have missed the mark in this instance
The barbarity of which they give such terrific
pictures, is all on the side of those whom they
represent as gentle, patient, christian victims


The Natchez Free Trader, whose attention
has been called to the above extract thus
speaks of it, and we beg to call to its remarks
the attention of our readers. 1t says:


In our issue Of the 18th instant, we pro-
nounced the story an entire fabrication and
so it is essentially. 1t processes to relate re-
cent occurrence, pretending to quote the Ian
guage of the Free Trader, and altogether pre-
sents picture Of horror such as has never be-
fore been witnessed The circumstances on
which the fiction is doubtless founded, occurred
from the best information we can get, in the
summer or fall of l84l.

This Is to be by from Knoxville Tennessee and
win therefore do its part in recovering for Virgna not
lost advantages but little Of her lost trade in that
quarter.


There used to be q considerable wagon trade from Bal
tmore to Western Virginia and East Tennessee These
wagons were wont to bring down feathers dried fruits
beeswax and honey with little ginseng nuts and the


like They reminded of Jacobs going down into
Egypt the second time to buy with the best fruits
Of the land"" ""a little balm and q little ho-
ney, spices and myrrh nuts and almonds"" They went
back well filled, carrying merchandise far west
Nashville and supplying the whole intermediate country
with foreign merchandise.


| When the James River Canal finished from Rich
mond to Lynchburg the people Of Virginia received the
benefit of this trade for the wagons ceased going Bal


more and stopped at Lynchburg But they ceased
coming to Lynchburg for in short time South Carolina
and Georgia had reached Chattanooga with their rail-
ways These wagons now 60 there, and are actually
hauling merchandise into Western Virginia. And this
trade, which Virginia content to have carried in
wagons and which in her hands did net to
than $l500 600 year, Charleston has expanded
into thirty forty millions year for such is the
figure with which Charleston merchants express the value
Of the trade which rails bringing to that city from the
back country that they have opened up.


Then there is the Alexandria, Orange, and Lynchburg
Railway, which, though only partly finished has, with
the Manassas road given great impulse to Alexandria


is bound to Lynchburg to compete for the trade and
travel which the Virginia and Tennessee road is to bring
up all the way from the Gulf and from the States and
cities the wayside.


There is also the Richmond and Danville Railroad ;

country, and win bring rich part Of North Carolina in

to you He takes two stars that will the meridian,

Of your zenith as is to the north Of you know there
FORE that your zenith is just midway between hem and


that its decinaon which is your latitude, is exactly
37o. You may construct formula for it. By this
problem our boundary lines now and all nice
field determinations Of latitude made.


Besides these roads there the Petersburg and Nor

burg and Gordonsvle roads that just begun These
with the exception Of those that built fifteen
twenty years ago. mostly for the accommodation Of the
great through travel between the North and South
the principal railroads in Virginia, and not one Of them
is at this moment finished


There is spirit, therefore, Of internal improvement
In the Old Dominon but tho point and the fact to and
upon which seeking to draw and fix your attention
just is the effect it s exhibited this and every
other correct map, of the policy which the State has
thought proper pursue with regard to her internal i'm
provements Be that policy what it may it has produced
as yet no satisfactory results


Between Baltimore and Charleston there is not single
seaport town dewater city that is in connexion by
railway with the western border of any State beyond Vr
gniao North Carolina. Here is gap in the middle of
the Aantc seaboard equal in extent third of that
wav fha Val
ley, seeking connexion with the seaboard around
these States at great increase both of distance and
pense and Virginia is at this moment completely cut
off from all commercial intercourse by railway with the
Western States is your native little town Of Frede-
ricksburg from the upper country that used to be bu
tary to it.


The Central with the Orange and Alexandria Railroads
have made island Of this little place, by divertng the
produce Of the Piedmont country away from her wharyes
and carrying to those either of Richmond Alexan
dria These works have stopped the mountain wagons
that Piedmont country is concerned have made Frede
rcksburg about dependant upon it for
the oasis is upon the desert And just in that condition
have the States North and South with their internal inn
provements, left your native State also.


But before proceed to discuss the mode by which
the State may recover great boon trade with the
West, should explain to you how Virginia to be
far behindhand with her internal improvement system
as to lose her share Of that business.


Or course many agencies concerned in bringing
about such state Of things and this growing be


very long letter. we will discuss and that briefly, but
few Of them.


As prominent among these agencies should not be
far wrong in naming of those very natural advan
ages that preponderated powerfully in favor Of Nor
folk the great commercial city of the continent viz
those beautiful rivers creeks and branches which,
pandng out into the Chesapeake Bay nterace Eastern
Virginia with perfect network of natural canals.


From the Revolution until now IL not now, Eastern
Virginia has ruled in the Legislature for the wealth and
population of the State have generally been on this side
Of the mountains.


All the internal improvements, therefore, which the
planters Of Eastern Virginia wanted for their per-
sona convenience spout from their farms, which
generally the banks Of the rivers through which
they could schultz their wheat and their down into
the hold Of the vessel that to take it away They
therefore, wanted canal and did not to have
good turnpike roads, and why should they build them
the people beyond the mountainsf


The Erie Canal met with very much the same kind of
opposition from the tidewater counties Of New York
but fortunately for New York, she had net been
blessed with such extent Of tdewator country and
natural cdadlizdtion.


There another circumstance which probably was
not without influence in producing this neglect with
gard to internal improvements Virginia took the lead
in the Revolution and afterwards in forming and putting
into operation those great and glorious institutions under
which We live and rejoice She became "" the mother Of
statesmen"" With her Washington and Jefferson, her
Madison and Monroe she governed the country up to
1925 There was only short interregnum during the
while Besides these great lights she had host Of other
Judge Marshall and John Taylor Of Carone-the
best thinker Of them all perhsrs-among them. They
were all from Eastern Virginia.


The mind and the talents of all Of these great and good
msn were devoted not to the development of these
Of their beloved State to system Of in


erna improvements for reaching the West but to the
Federal Government How material it that the heart"

bay in either Of theml


Continue the examination little further by casting
your eye upon South Carolina and Georgia There again
with their main stems also back to the Mississippi Valley
and stretching on far into Tennessee their way to
Kentucky and Ohio, thus cutting off all western trade
from Virginia. You observe how in Tennessee the rail-
roads also skim Virginia and down to the southeast
to meet the South Carolina and Georgia improvements
Charleston is at this time actually importing for Nash
vlle and all the country thence to Abingdon in Virginia


Thus Virginia that ought to have been the rst to tap
the Mississippi Valley with her internal improvements is
the last All the States West shun her with improve
ments They 60 round her. and, by the disconnexion,
she presents herself isolated and island like the grand
together What has she lost by it. The commercial
dependency and the business of empire loss which,


fear, cannot now be made good by any Of money,
even though It be as enormous the British debt.
do not wish to make any impression upon your mind
my that is either unfair unavorabe the State
where we were born; nor do mean convey to you
the idea that Virginia is without any internal improve
ments; far from it. The people have constructed, or
rather have In hand fine works. and the State has
helped them But the State has as yet planned and
cuted nothing like great State work nothing orthy

cy with regard to system Of internal improvements,

of lynching at Monterey


Al one o'clock on Sunday, the Sd inst,
Jose Higuera, native of California, was
hung without good cause, at the corner Of
a house opposite the building known as
the Casa de Gobierno, by some riotous
Americans, some of them in a state of in

that on the night before, he went with a
countryman and friend Anastasio Garcia,
to ball, where the two got into a dispute
with these Americans. Garcia shot and
mortally wounded Deputy Sheriff, and
escaped. Higuera was mortally wounded
by shot, and received the extreme unc.

DEAFNESS of Provisions.-A writer in the
National Infelzgencer suggests, as a remedy, in
part, for this great pecuniary evil, that all the
market places in the city be opened every day in
the week, except Sunday This, he says would
have tendency TO bring in people from the coun.
try with their ""fresh eggs"" which are now col
ected by spectators and kept for high price, or
until they are stale. The time has passed, in his
opinion, when tri-weekly market will answer
the wants Of this city, with its foryfve thousand
inhabitants. ""The crowds are so great at market
that people have to elbow way through, and,
besides the Inconvenience, the rush during market
hours, is one cause ofthe high prices, the same
articles sell at lower price as the day advances.
This proves that it is not the scarcity Of the arli-
cle but some artificial cause, that makes the exor-
bitant price,""


We are sure there is another cause for the
dearness Of provisions, namely: the habitual vio-
lation of the law against forestaling by the huck
sters, who not only set and maintain the high
prices, but monopolize the larger portion Of garden
products. The market-masters are almost if not
quite, useless officers, so far as that law is con-
cerned.


Warlikc.-During the present week there
have been numerous fights, batteries, and as
saults in different parts Of Washington as if Bel.
Iona herself were in the city to ""gender strifesn
and 10 stimulate violation of the municipal laws
for the preservation Of order.


The particulars ofthe fstcufs, the stone throw.
ing, and the head-cracking, would not, we pre-
sumo, be edifyng to our readers.


Some Of the combatants have been arrested,
and held to bail for their appearance at court.


Heretofore, excessive lenency has been ex-
tended towards such rioters, but the tender hand
ling of them by the judicial authorities has proved
but little more eficacious than the grass thrown
by the farmer at the boy in his apple tree.


The excessive heat Of the weather, one would
have supposed, was unfavorable for belicose dis
plays: but it appears that the temperature, instead
of enervating the bodies of those disposed to be
dsorderly, irrita,ed them to the fighting point,
with the aid, in some instances, ofspiritous drinks
and lager beer.


Pleasurc-Seeking.-The season for steam
boat excursions and pcnics has fairly commenced,
and numerous are the participants in such diver
sions. A day given occasionally TO such innocent
pleasures cannot fail TO be promotive of much
good both TO the body and mind and business
men especially should, now and then, forsake their
offices and shops for the river or the country. Not
only would they find their physical but social con-
dhion improved, and thus be better prepared for
the active concerns Of life.

any more than being foreman of the
Placer Times office, wherein, and by
whose proprietors, at their own risk, the
first Whig paper north of San Francisco
was published State Journal


The ssknowing"" editors of the State
Journal are intensely ignorant in many
subjects, as reference to their columns
will prove. Their knowledge on many
things amounts to vague assertions, un-
supported by facts, and having no founda-
tion but IN their erratc Imagination -
''We happen to know' that Mr. Lynch
was one Of the proprietors of the Inder,
and that he offered to dispose OF has in
terest to gentleman now a resident of
this town, practical printer. The gen.
tleman alluded to declined the purchase,
and for some time subsequent the paper
continued to be published by Mr.. Lynch.
When his connection ceased we are un-
able to state, but the fact that he was one
of the proprietors Of ''the first Wing
paper published north of San Francis
co."" we can prove.


Mr.. 'sP. Lynch, Editor Placer Demo-
crat,"" has an ingenious and original way
of getting himself out of difficulty. In
the last Democrat we stated that he had
established the first achig paper north of
San Francisco. In the State journal of
Monday last he published ''card"" in
which he erades the point at issue by a
clever quibble. He does not deny that
he was one of the proprietors Of the lnder,
but does deny that he ever ""edited avhig
paper.' Who charged him with having
""edited whig paper?"" We made no
such charge, and his disclaimer therefore
is wholly unnecessary. To our thinking
it was rather violent assumption on his
part to even intimate that he had ever
""edited'' any paper."

FeIEND MIrcHELL:-In the ""Placer
Democrat"" of May 10th, an account is
given of a ""kiIing affair"" which does not
set forth the facts they as really exist, and
as they were really drawn out at the exam
ination. do not wish to prejudice the
public mind against the offenders, but to
correct Il prejudice, which is exhibited in
every line of the Democrats version of
the affair.


The facts are these, as elected from
witnesses at the trial. and from farmers who
live in the neighborhood: Foreman, the
deceased, had a ranch in Salt Spring Val
ley, on which he had smade few perma-
nent Improvements. Having leased it for
the present year he determined to devote
his time in putting such improvements
upon the place as his means would per-
nit. In order that his claim would be as
favorable as possible to the United States
survey, he got Col. Finley to run the
line, Of what would be that survey when
made, and at the same time stating his
object to the Colonel and his neighbors,
that in making the survey he did not in
tend to relinquish his old one Horton
dlJtl LII CWSlCl DUu3HL IdtICH UCUL OIC-
man, and to make up another by location
they took part Of Forman's land, lying
otside of the new survey and within the
old one. Foreman took a witness with
him and in his presence forbade Horton
& Brewster trespasslng upon his ground,
telling them that his line was as formerly.
They however persisted in their claim to
the land, and few days since commenc.
ed building a house in a grove where
Foreman was cutting fence TIMBER
Foreman took took two men and went to
Horton, who was at wolk on the house,
and requested him to move his house, at
the same time telling him he could get
men enough to remove it in half an hour
if he wished to. Horton refused to move
his house, replying that the ground be-
longed to him and Brewster. Foreman
then left Horton and commenced chopping
some trees, which he had girdled a short
distance from the house. Horton got
down from the house, where he was at
work, and with pistol in his hand, went
to Foreman and commanded him to stop
choppng. Foreman replied, that it was
his own ground and he would chop as
much as he pleased, and that no one but
coward would come there armed to en-
force his rights. Horton then left him
but soon returned accompanied by Brews-
ter-one armed with a slung shot the
other with pistol, went to Foreman and
requested him to leave. Foreman again
replied that he was on his own ground
and that he should not leave. Horton
and Brewster then advanced towards
Foreman, when he told them if they came
nearer he would strike them with the axe.
Brewster made another advance when
Foreman struck at him, Brewster lodged
the blow and struck Foreman twice,
when he ordered Horton to fire with his
pistol Horton did so, hitting Foreman in
the abdomen. Brewster again struck
Foreman two or three times, whereupon
F., threw his axe at them, turned and
run, Brewster followed him few rods
and then returned, Foreman kept on some
twelve rods, when he fell upon his back
and expired in few minutes.


One of Foreman's companions told
Horton and Brewster that Foreman was
dead, and requested them to come and
stay with him uutil some of the neighbors
could be sent for Horton went and felt
of Foreman's pulse and pronounced him
dead, at the same time saying that Brews-
ter and himself would go and give them
selves up to the authorities. They ac-
cordingly went before Justice Lynch, who
after elcitng the foregoing facts from
different witnesses, discharged Brewster
and bound Horton over in the sum of five
thousand dollars, to answer the charge of
manslaughter.


We do not call in question the propriety
of such course, but it is impossible for
US ''hard fisted miners"" to appreciate the
difference in the guilt of these two often
ders, and do not believe there was a
man present at the examination, save his
Honor, the court, who could come to such
a conclusion.

9th of November, issued proclamation to its in
habitants, calling upon them TO arise, that I"" the

After denouncng the ilibusters as vagabonds,
contemplate band of punderers and pirates, he
states they are destined TO find their graves in
Sonora that handful Of awless men and free
hooters cannot conquer more than one hundred
thousand inhabitants, The proclamation winds
up with an earnest appeal TO the citizens 10 de-
tend the State. and severe anthemas against luke
warmness and Indifference.


On the following day Governor Canada issued
an Order decreeing that a war of determination be
waged against the flibusers, which, minus the
preamble, consisting mostly of severe epthets
against them, reads as follows:


/. That all strangers who invade this depart
ment without the proper permission of the autho-
rites, and form armed bands, will be considered
and treated as pirates.


2. That all captains Of vessels that bring armed
invaders, all owners Of such vessels who authorize
such use Of their vessels, all who maintain friend
ly relations with the invaders, all who in any way
protect, aid, and serve the piratcal expedition all
who conceal or attempt 10 save any individual OF
the invaders, all who willingly act guides, and
all who give them information, will be treated as
pirates. ..,.. .,. ... .... -h. II.


3. That all who withdraw from the towns with
out permission of the authorities to avoid taking
up arms, and all who remiss in the iuflment
of their duties to their country will be considered
"" suspect"" and will be tried by court-martal,
the least punishment being enrolment in the stand
ing army. .""'. ..."".

A British vessel of war had started for Quay
mas TO aid in repelling the invaders, but subse-
quenty returned, saying that they thought that
the MeXicans would need no aid. They seemed
TO have the intention however, of taking part if
necessary. Some officials said that if they saw
any flibusters acting with violence, they would be
treated as pirates. ..: ;. .... ~,

the desperate efforts Of the Propagandists in
the border counties of Missouri to establish
Slavery in Kansas and keep out emigrants
from free States. They Will succeed with some,
who prefer peace, at whatever cost; but they
will soon have to confront moro ""rough GUS
somersn than they can manage. They who
yield to blustsr and bullying are not fit to be
pioneers Of new country


Meantime, we lay before the public another
letter from settler in Kansas, addressed to
member Of Congress- and handed to us for
publication. He exposes the bae, trickery of
the Propagandists. His allegations concern
ing Mr.. Atchison deserve investigation. We
wonder If Messrs. Douglas Cass Dodge Of Iowa,
and other champions Of ""Squstter Sovereign
ty,p are taking any measures to rscure it fair
play! What with the Administration and
Mr.. Atchison, ""Squatter Sovereignty"" is
knocked in the head, and few slaveholding
advcnturers are made lords Of the whole Ter
ritory.


But what care these gentlemen for the rights
OF the free Statss2 How much have Dodge
and Jones' Douglas and Shields, Bright and
Petit Cass and Stuart, done, and what are
they doing, 10 promote free emigration into
Kansas, to protect ""Squattcr Sovereignty""
there, to see that their States have fair play in
Kansas, despite the Vaccinations Of Atcbison,
Pierce, s. Coz They pretsnd to stand up for
Popular Sovereignty and represent free
State constituencies and yet they tamely stand
by, while industrious, enterprising emigants
from their owa States, are threatened by Mr..
Atcbison's friends with Lynch Law, if they
dare put foot in the Territory.


OF corrse, citizens Of the free States will not
be deferred by any such demonstrations. The
Territories Of the United Statos are open to
them and they wiH 90 into them, peaceably if
possible, forcibly If necessary. The bullying
Of lawless vagabonds will only stimulate them

KANSAS TERRITORY, June IL, 1854.


DEAR SIR: The effects OF the unwise and
wicked Legislation of Congress in relation to
this Territory are fact being developed. Meet
ings have been held in various parts OF Mis-
souri,, and resolutions pas5cd that no Anti.Sla-
very man should hold claims in Kansas. This
extends TO all the citizens of the free States,
who are indiscriminately called Abolitionists.
The treaties have been formed with direct ref
erence to the establishment OF slavery in the
Territoricl To effect this, an unusual plan
was fix ~ upon, namely: Delegations with pow
ers to treat were sent for to 90 to Wellington,
generally from one or two tribes at a time.
Here the treaties were concocted, and informa-
ton privately sent by the shareholders in Wash
ington to their friends, and the coded lands
are overrun by shareholders, before anybody
else knows that treaty has been formed.
For instance, Mr.. Atchison, as soon as treaty
was formed with the Delaware Indians, sent a

stances Of ferocous brutality bya negro IN Danoridse

Mrs Moore and Miss Lospetch, asister OF Mrs Moore.
The carse Of the murder was that he fell in love with
Miss Iotspeteh and Of course his advances were re-
ected as often as made The young lady finally acquan
ted Mr. Moore with the circumstances, VINO threaeheu
the black with fogging for his conduct. lhereupon

Mr. Moore with an AK while sleeping; but Mrs. Moore

give the alarm. He then attacked Miss Lotspetch,
who resisted his advances-broke her arm wtha blow,
stunned her and then violated her. He then entered


canoe and went to sleep in it as it oated down the
river. He was suspected. pursued and overtaken;
and new comes the most remarkable part of the incl
dents. He was put to the torture to confess by
""screwng his fingers and then his hands In vice uh
""i all the bones were mashed, (and other treatment
(Which cannot be mentioned in print aud he acknowl'

was tied to tree in front of his late masters house.
""a large pile of pitch pine built around him, and then


set fire to and burned to ashes in presence OF l20O
..or 500 persons who did not leave the spot until
he was completely reduced to ashes.


Now we make no wonder and offer no ""senti'
'.mentaism' this circumstance we deem 1l
these incidents legitimate cause and effect. First
there is Slavery; then that peculiar institution Is de-
prived of the IN lder qualities which belong to 1t In

speak thus because in the newer settlements the

subdued accordingly by the antecelents of infancy
and boy hood which make up the moral compensations
such IS they are of the system. The slave in ques-
ton was probably so related to new master. But
he conceived passion-crude, coarse, and brutal, no
doubt, for young lady in the house. and lust over





kills his master with original intent; next his mis-
tress with a secondary purpose; and ravishes aud
kills the still resisting young lady. These are all
sequences. Next the hunting. the torture,
tie burning are all natural enough. We
do not expect community imbedded in
negro slavery, living in the midst of dangers, to wait
for the process of the law quick or slow in such an
emergency. Lynch law is inevitable. All we con-
tend for is that negro burnngs must take place in
punishment for murder and Iape in a community
where The negro can nourish only revenge-ferce,
lid, inhuman-as he hears the bay of the blood
hound set on his track and nought but bondage
in prospect. We must look for hideous savageism
worthy of original Africa in crime and punishment
under such system Ard the responsibility of it lies
primarily and supremey on those who maintain the
inhuman relations OF slave and owner"

lightning, red as fire globes, and glaringlike twin
meteors. The whole soul as in the eye-the
full heart streamed out in the face. In nve
minutes, Pixies wit seemed the foam OF folly,
when contrasted with the inimitable sallies and
exterminating sarcasms of the stranger, inter
spersed with tests and anecdotes that filled the
forum with roars of laughter. :,


Then without so much as bestowng an allusion
on Prentiss, he turned short on the perjured w.t.
nesses of Hopkins, tore their testimony into atoms
and hurled in their face such terrible invectives
that all trembled as with an ague, and two OF
them actually fed dismayed from the court house.


The excitement of the crowd was becoming tre-
mendous. Their life and soul appeared to hang
on the burning tongue of the stranger. tie insplr-
ed them with the power Of his own malicious feel
ings. He seemed to have stolen natures long hid
den secret of attraction. He was the sun to the
sea of emotion which rose and fell as he chose.
But his great triumph was to come.


His eyes began to glare furtively at the assas-
sin Hopkins, and his lean taper fingers slowly as
sumed the same direction. He hemmed the wretch
in with decentralization Of strong evidence and
impregnable argument, cutting off all hope OF es-
cape. He piled up huge bastions OF insurmount'
able facts.

nailed them there forever.

amounted to madness.

treated the panel, after they should bring in 9
verdict for the plaintiff, not to offer violence to

other words not to lynch the villain Hopkins, bu
leave his punishment with God!


This was the most artfaktrick of all, and wa:

In New ol on Friday morning about . o'clock, Jake, Bob and Stephen Pembroke. werearrest, ed at the instance of David Smith and Jacob Grove. of Washington 0o., Nary land. They were taken before COmmis> sioner Morton, of the U. s. Court. and it was understood they would be exam- ined at II o'clock. Instead Of that, how. ever, the case was heard at once, when no one was present.. The claimants ;tes. ti6ed that they were the owners-of the slaves as aforesaid, and that they esea. ped from their service at Baltimore. On this testimony they were given up, and immediately hurried on board the cars, A telegraphic message was sent to Phil, sdelphia on the discovery of these pro- ceediugs. and an attempt was there to be made to rescue them on their arrival

 Their father is a brother of the Rev. Dr. Pennington, of New York city. .l.

 In Boston, on Wednesday evening, a colorednan,, named Anthony Burns. was arrested. and next morning taken before the Commissioners Court, where evi. dence was presented to show that he was runaway slave. belonging to Col. c. r. Suttle. of Alexandria. Va, Before the hearing was finished. however, the lawyers who appeared as counsel for the fugitive, asked for postponemento of the case till Saturday, which was granted. Burns was therefore placed in an upper room of the Court House, under keeps ing of the U. s. Marshal. and all was quiet During the evening following, be had an interview with his master, and expressed a willingness to return home with him. eTs5 ldrG ..f..

 On Friday evening. after tremendous meeting at Faneuil Hall, where Wendell Phillips, Theodore Parker, and Francis w. Bird, made inAammatoty speeches, three or four thousand persons proceed ed to the jail where Burns was confined, and attempted his rescue. A trial was made to break open the Court House doors on the east side, which. owing to the strong fastenings, failed. The lead : ing rioters then went to the west en> trance, and with heavy plank used as ""a battering engine, stove through the panels of tie door and broke windows

 Numerous pistols were fired, and the mob became formidable.

 One of the Deputy Marshals, named James Bachelder, was shot immediately after, while endeayoring to prevent the passage of the leaders up the stairway. Two companies U, s. troops arrived soon after this, from Fort Independence. and the rioters desisted f,om further active

 

 operations. A company of Marines from the Navy Yard. and two infantry cons panies of the city were also called out to assist in defending the Court House. On Saturday. the hearing of the case was resumed. bat the counsel of the fugitive again asked for a postponement till Mon. day, which was granted. Eleven per- sons were arrested on Saturday. seven of them colored. charged with being cons cerned in the murder of the DYputy Mar, shal. All were committed without bail.

 On Sunday. the case was still affect ing the public mind. Some 500 or 1000 persons were around the Court House, which was guarded by ropes all day. Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker were denounced by many as the mur> derers of BacheIder. An attempt was made to lynch them, but the Mayor de. tailed a strong force to guard their pro- perty and persons. It having been re- ported that Sut,ls had sold Burns, the following handbill was circulated :--, x

The recent case Of lynch law at Jack
son has excited much feeling in Calave-
ras county. The particulars, as given
by the Chronicle, are interesting. The
Chronicle says, that horse was stolen
from Messrs. Askee & Evans, about a
week since, and suspicion fell upon an
individual who had been seen lurking
about the place for some time. The
horse was tracked to the Sacramento
road and followed by Messrs. Askee and
Campbell to the South Yuba, distance
of some hundred miles, where they
found the man who had been suspected,
and the stolen horse. They Immediate
ly secured the man and started for Jack
son, where they arrived early OF Thurs
day morning. Without going through
the form Of a trial, a party seized upon
the prisoner and swung him to the ""old
oak, : SO famed for being the point from
which the mob-triod criminals have made
their exit This makes the seventh
who has paid the penalty of his life
without law or judge, on this tree. The
victim was Swiss by birth, rather good
looking and went by the names of Sch
wartz, Black and Bennett. About an
hour after the execution, q box was
brought, the victim lowered, . gold ring
taken of his finger, and after mailing the
lid, his corpse was taken to the vicinity
and buried. Judge Emo has issued
warrants for the arrest of all the parties
concerned in this affairs. J. Repa5-

FROM THE PROVIDENCE JOURNAL OF FRIDAY


Yesterday We had an oldfashioned snow storm, one
that must have satisfied those who constantly
referring to the past and complaining that not the
thunder and the storms of the present degenerate days
are equal to those of the good old times


The commenced falling at eleven o'clock We'd
nesday evenings and continued until four o'clock yester
day afternoon. although it continued blow that the
air filed with the fakes. Till four five o'clock
Thursday morning the fell pretty level but at that
time the wind rose and has been blowing since al
most gale. The drifed in of the streets to
the depth Of four five feet and in other places the
ground is quite bare. 1t is easy estimate the
depth to which it has fallen on a level.


Against some of the sidewalks it has been cut down.
and presents WALL ranging from three to five feet
in height Very praseworthy efforts made by many
of the good people to make the walks in front of their
houses and shops passabe, and this in degree
accomplished in the central streets.


Mr. Garfield, with great difficulty and with steady per.
severance, pushed the morning train through Worces
ter. He met the Lonsdale train, which he backed up
Lonsdale and the down train which he backed up to
Worcester with his Of three locomotives He left
Worcester at quarter four and arrived at Prov-
dence Mt a quarter past seven.


vigorous attempt was made to get through the
Boston road train of three locomotives and or
two cars made its way out seven miles, when it encoun
tered drift that proved too much for it. At FIVE
o'clock the snow was drifting over the tran the wood
| and water exhausted and the fire out.


No attempt was made to get train the Stoning-
| ton road.


The only mail that reached us before o'clock last
evening from Pascoag, driven through by jeremiah
Sheldon r who deserves honorable mention for his per-
severance As this mail did not bring any very stirring
intelligence, have devoted to old files the time
that we usually give to the papers of the day. and
are unable to give readers the of the world
around US, we will remind them of the events of bygone
years.


THE STORM OF 1881.


One of the heaviest storms record commenced
on the morning of Saturday. January 18th, 1881, and
continued till the following morning The snow was ac-
companied by high wind and was drfted in places
to the height of fifteen feet in the city. The citizens
turned out to make passage through the Streets and
oxen and horses kept in readiness to draw the
gnes in case Of an alarm of fire.


On Sunday the churches were all closed and the bells
were not rung. Indeed, high the piled up
against the doors of of the churches that they could
not be opened This circumstance recorded in the
papers rs without precedent.


The General Assembly was in session at East Green
wich and the members detained there till Tuesday,
the roads being quite impossible. Between Greenwich
and Apponaug the was drifted in some places to
the depth of twelve feet. On Tuesday two fourhorse
sleighs started from Greenwich for Providence The first
contained Gov Fenner and the greater part of the Sena
tors the other was filed with members of the National
Republican party, and it was noted omen that al
though the first had the start by half hour the latter
overlook it and passed it ut the first virgin

| H. Arnold was elected over Gov Fenner.


number Of lives lost in this great storm. The
driver Of the Hartford stage pershed and boy in Foster
was frozen to death in snow-drift. The steamboat
| McDonough went ashore Norwak Island, dragging
both her anchors with all her steam and her head to
| the wind.


Some persons who had rendered ycoman service in
breaking out the streets determined to have little
joyment, and accordingly excavaed room, under
bank, ten feet high with buffalo robe for door and
ventilation through the top In this apartment twelve
gentlemen partook of hot oyster supper and reported
good time. Whether it conducted on the principles
of the Maine law not do not know but, considering
the early period should soy probably not The storm
extended over wide region and was pronounced the
heaviest in this vicinity since 1850.


THE STORM OF 1929.


Some of matrony readers who we dare say lecture
their daughters and nieces upon the mprudence of going
out parties in bad weather, will remember when they

patriotic times not suffered to pass unnoted occur

violent to prevent the ladies from attending the
ball. As the night the storm increased. and
while music and dancing were going within the snow

ricade the windows of the hall The time of breaking up
was postponed from hour TO hour bat therewas abate

that which had been explored.
An INTEREsTINa LEGAL DECIsIoN.-A
suit was recently brought against Messrs.
Parish s. Co. of Lynchhurgh, Va, to
recover the value Of the contents of II
trunk, which had been cut from their
stage and rifled In the trial, the plaintiff
himself WAS introduced, 10 prove by his
oath, what the contents Of the trunk were
The objection Of the defendants counsel
that no man could be witness in his own
case, being OverruIed on the ground of
the necessity of the case, AS no gentleman
could be expected to show another what
he put in his trunk. The court observed,
however, that this rule applied only to
wearing appear. The defendant offered
to prove that notices were posted in con-
spicuous places, thar call baggage WAS at
the risk Of the owners"" The court
held however, that carrier is liable for
damage, except sich as occurs at the act
Of the owner, the act Of God, Gas of a
stroke of lightniDgO or the act of public
enemies Even if n special agreement
should have been previously made be-
tween the carrier and the owner Of the
baggage, that the carrier should not be
responsible, It might be question wheth-
er such agreement would remove his
liability or not; at all events, no general
notice would.


The Lynchburgh Virginian, from which
we have gathered the above facts, men
tionI also another point, which, though
not arising in this case, is generally mis-
understood, that stage owner has no
mir m ~ hncenrA
said persons will not agree to be responsi-
bile for their own baggage. 1t is por-
ton Of their duty towards the public to
carry both passengers and baggage for a
certain sum, and the law regards the fare
as compensation for both the trouble and
the risk.


MINING NEws.-Russell, Neafe g. Co,
on Gold Point, are working to good ad-
vantage. There were four men engaged
in working the claim, last week, and we
are informed they realized from 5000 to
1921 per day. One of the hands elong-
ing to this company, a few days ago, dis
covered gold in seam in the Gay, and
whit is quite unusual, it was entirely des-
titute of gravel; co !ecting Il pan of this
dirt, he washed it-snd to his surprise
found. by weighing, that he had 5 ounces
and Il half Of pure gold dust.


Other claims on this point are also pay
ing we'll; among which, we might men
ton the Eagle Company claims, the pro-
prietors of which are averaging from an
ounce to twenty dollars TO the hand per
day.


During the dry weather which we have
had within the last two weeks, the Miners
on Pike Flat have been working again
with their usual success. We might

Mr.. ARGUs-I have been much interested for
some days past in reading files of newspapers
Newspapers are a sort of weathercock of public
opinion. Occasionally an editor fills up his col
umns with complete catalogue of murders-then
he will deal in poetry and fancy, and perhaps call
his readers the honest ncorruptible people Again
the newspaper opens its battery upon some Office
seeker and damns him with praise, and pufs him
into prosperity with astounding developments; then
chronicles the news seizing upon prize fight or
duel with eagcrness


BY the way, John read me an account of bru-
tai fight of recent occurrence, in which of the
combatants broke his arm, and con tinued fighting
afterwards until he was horribly beaten. What a
pity that he and his adversary did not both break
their necks A duel fought with rifles passed of
lately with glorious results, one party being killed
on the ground. If the other had been shot by the
seconds, and then the seconds shot by the specta-
tors and the spectators had then all been hung by
Judge Lynch, the affair would have been termina-
ted just right. The fashion of fighting duels may
do we'll enough for those who likeit besides giving
an opportunity occasionally for the expression of
holy horror and pious precepts. In fine if one is
killed in q uel by his adversary, should we not
call the affair a suicide, induced by mental excite
ment!

of clay, with stem three feet two inches and five
eighths long exactly, and quantity of Turkish

pernicious habit among the Celestials, and in the

The Foreign Tax Collectors in this county work
hard, and collect large amount of money from

they collect more money this year in this county,
than will be collected from equal number any

A SWEET little girl in New Haven, only three
years old, was promised one evening that she
should accompany her parents 10 Boston the next

the journey, and when she had finished repeating
her little prayer as she laid down TO sleep, she said

The New Orleans Bulletin adds that it is not

The besieging force was reported al two thousand

have been made which could be accepted by the
United States government.

advise that all projects for building the

The Democratic State Journal has pri.
vate advices from Washington which state
that the California pre-emption law.
which expired by limitation on the 81 inst,
has been extended for two years. Also,
that law donating 16O acres of public
lands to actual settlers, had passed the
Senate with positive probability that
the House would concur.


IMPORTANT PosT OFFICE ORDERs.-In
the United States Senate, MIR. Sumner of

ResolUed, That the Committee ON the

consider the expediency of providing for
the convenience and security oi remittances
abroad, in small sums, by authorizing
orders or drafts by our Post Offices with
which it is in correspondence, constituting

orders.


HuNo.-Thos. Motley and VIM. Black
lege were to be hung in Charleston, s. G.
on the Sd inst, for hunting down runa-
way slave with bloodhounds and then tor
turing him to death.


A FATAL rencontre occurred in Lexing-
ton, Va, between cadet of the Military
Institute and student of the Law School,
in which the former, Thos. Blackburn, was
killed. The affair created great excite
ment among the popu'ace, who threatened
to lynch the murderer, and were only pre-
vented by the strong guard stationed at
the Jail. 1t appears that the murderer,
G. b. Christian, was waiting upon Black
burns cousin, and he, Blackburn, know
ing something derogatory to the honor Of
Christian. warned her against assocating
with him. She subs. quently informed
him of what had been told her and re-
quested that he would not come to the
house any more, whereupon Christian be-
came much excited and seeking out Black
burn murdered him in the most shocking
| manner.

of two gentlemen of standing, relates the particu-
lars Of most shocking crime said to have been
perpetrated by DIR. Thompson of Covington,
Allegheny county, Virginia. 1t says:


""It will be remembered that some time during
last spring. an item went the rounds of the pa
2ers chronicling the sudden death of Miss Agnes
Pharr of Covington, Va, and stating that she was
within few days of her marriage to one Dr.
Thompson, her fathers family physician. We
learn from private source that it is so strongly
suspected that her death was caused by strych-
nine administered by Dr. T., that several public
meetings of the citizens have been held to con-
sider the matter. The circumstances seem to be
these; Miss Pharr had been indIsposed for some
weeks and had been taking medicine from Dr.
Thompson. On the morning OF her death, DR.. T.
wrote her note, asking a postponement of her
marriage and urging her to take the remainder of
the pills he had left for her Among these pills
there seems to have been one considerably larger
than the Others and this was the only one LETT
Miss Pharr having refused to take it. Upon this
last request, she took il and in fifteen minutes
was a corpse Her death was pronounced at the
time to be similar to that propuced by strychnine
but there was no suspicious of foul plav, until the
ladies' engaged in dressing the body, discovered
certain sigHS which were more than confirmed by
the further discovery of box of ergot pills
When the suspicious assumed public character.
DR.. I. demanded that the body should be disir-
tered and examined by committee OF physi-
clans named by himself; but when the consent OF
the parents of the unfortunate girl was obtained,
he refused to have anything to do with it, alleg-
ing as a reason that he did not wish to wound the
feelings of the family.


These are the facts as they have been detailed
70 US by two gentlemen of standing. If they be
true, there is certainly good ground for demand
Ing an investigation. If DR.. Thompson be guilty,

I was prepared by those who witnessed the who'll affair, and may be relied on as authentic:

 To The Public

 Whereas the public attention is and will bt called on to inquire into the following report as to the wholesale butcheries committed in tht town of Smithville, Mo-, now be it known tba there had been gang of thieves and outlaw. quartered Ill this vicinity, which fact has been established by court Of enquiry accor- dlng to the laws of the country. Those thieves ana mcendlarles were notified to leave Clay and the adJolnng counties by more than one hun- urea respectable citizens of this vicinity Theil answers were that they would not leave and 1nat M nlty armed men could not make them leave. mus the matter passed on for season, until Monday, the 7th day of August, the day of the election, when they sent word that they in- tended to clean out the town, commencing on those who had used the most exertions in pros- ecutlng them with the law, even telling their friends where they wished to be buried if they fell in the conflict.

 They then armed themselves with two pis- Lols, (revolvers) each and bowie-k knives and dlrks. Thus equipped, they made their ap- pearance ln town. Their leader Samuel Shack teford, commenced conversation, in an insult lng manner, with John w. Douglas, and allud- ca to Wm. Ross, both respectable citizens of ehls community. MT. Ross replied in a calm manner, but was dared to the onset by Samuel i>hackleford, and at that moment person, a re- latlon ot Shackletord's, passed between them for moment; Shackleford drew revolver the person passed on, and Shackleford shot Wm. Ross twice, wounding him severely, perhaps mortally Shackleford then turned and shot Douglas twice, and then shot at M Imhof twice Douglas then returned the fire on Shackleford twice, wounding him, and then Douglas drew a bowie-knife, he, Douglas) being the only cti- lzen on the ground who was armed. Wm. Shackleford seized Douglas and got his knife and pistol, and then commenced the work of destruction on Douglas inflicting several wounds, of which Doug las fell dead. He then shot twice or three times at M Imhoff but without effect.

 Persons then interfered to stop the effusion of blood.-Samuel Shack leford stabbed every per- son whom he suspected his enemy inhicting a mortal wound on s. J. Ross, and also cutting and stabblng Ira Witt, who was a stanger, and Tony engaged for peace, as also young Ross.- John w. Galloway ran in and shot at M. Im- hof and missed him. as did Samuel Shackle- ford. Galloway then shot Wm. Slator, wound Ing hltn slightly ln the leg By this time the light became general. Stones and clubs were III order. The Shacketords and Galloway re- treated, and Ill so doing attempted to kill others, whom they considered their enemies. Samuel Shackleford's pistol, which he drew with the in- tention of shooting MT. Payne, missed fire, and he then threw the pistol at him. They then entered drug store, and locked themselves up for defence, but owing to Samuel Shackleford being wounded, and the people threatening to fire the house, they surrendered to the popu- lace.

 The populace was frenzied. Ropes were call ed for, guns and pistols procured, and all hands calling for immediate vengeance on the 1nur- derers. Thus it passed on until the people were alarmed in all directions, and notified of the circumstances. They came from Platte county. Ridgely was precinct, and 1t being a public day the people iocked in gangs to this place. The cry Was"" Lynch hang the thieves and murderers."" Two or three hundred per sons were present. Wm. Shackleford was then hung. John w. Galloway was next hung, who stated that Saml Shackleford was to blame fol all the trouble; that Sam. Shackleford had in- duced hIm into stealing horses; that Sam. Shack etord stole the mule that he was arrested for and he took 1t and sold it in St. Joseph; and that they had concluded not to kill the people ot tsmlthvlile and vicinity, but for the over per- suasion Ot--that he would stand up to them and see them through. The same was affirmed by Mrs. Shackleford; although they had agreed among themselves to go into the massacre be- fore-came. Sam Shackleford was hung next, all to the same limb

 Now the community claims the right to stop such wholesale butcheries, when every effort on their part is made for peace and no peace given them, only being shot down like beeves in a slaughter pen, or slaugtered like hogs in sty. Now the people are satisfied with what they have done, so far as civil authority is concern. ed. The peace officers made speeches against mob law, and used every exertion for the civil authority to have its proper course but all to no effect. Order was confounded; confusion reigned. Men paraded the streets like drag 'ons in military service. Now the whole of his resulted from an effort on the part of the ,itizens to bring these thieves to justice accor- ling to law, for the commission of crimes, their quilt of which they acknowledged.

thousand dollars worth OF gold.


The dates brought from San Francisco are TO

anticipated by the late arrival at New Orleans
The San Francisco Herald says:


We have received by private adyices intelli-
gence from the adventures by the barque Caro-
line, which sailed from this port in October last,
with the acknowledged intention Of conquering
Sonora AT la Paz, after the reduction Of the

Frenchinan, who had killed citizen, was ar
rested and placed in confinement by the legal
authorities. Some parties from Greenhorn creek
came over and took him from prison, gave him a
Lynch trial and hung him. He had been sick for
some time, and it is sad was partially deranged.
The Herald thus describes the closing scene


""The trembling victim was led to a tree hard
by, where stood galows, which had heretofore
been used to trice up butchered cattle-a fit place,
truly TO consummate such a tragedy. Then he
was placed on horse and the rope adjusted TO the
tree. The prisoner, seeing that his doom was
sealed assisted them in adjusting the fatal cord 10
his neck. Some one cried ut.to tie his hands,
and, while some oficious individual was accom-
4 ~. -.
lost his balance and swung from the horse, amid
the wild, savage yels of his executioners. There
being no sudden force the moose caught under
the chin and did not slip.


''The stranglng victim, with face full of agony,
and eyes starting from their sockets, gazed wildly
around upon the crowd beneath. The cries and
yells that rent the air would have been becoming
in hungry wolves or halfstarved hyenas they
seize upon their prey But all was not yet over.
The rope refused to do its duty, and several per-
sons caught hold of the quiverng body of the dy-
ing man and mercifully lent him additional weight
10 stop the current of life; while another person,
in the tree, with commendable perseverance,
shook the rope with the same benevolent object""


A Captured SIaver.-The schooner N. II.
Gambr Lieutenant De Camp commanding, ar
rived at New York on Thursday, in ffty-three days
from Loando, South Africa, after having experi-
enced succession of violent gales, which stove

completely filed with water-casks, which were
all panked over. In addition TO the regular stove
for cooking provisions for the crew, a large galley
had been put up the day previous. The cook, on
being questioned, said that the captain had told
him that ""the galley was for him to cook the food
have received from 800 to $50 slaves, in the mar
row space between the deck and the planking
over the water-casks-a space i'll which man
could not stand erect.


Her crew consisted of eleven men all told-the
captain MIST and second mates, cook, steward
four men before the mast and two passengers,
who went out in her. The captain was an Ameri-
can the two mates were Englishmen.


When the Gambrill was ready for sail, perms-

for the murder of a schoolmaster in Kentucky, is
exciting great interest throughout the west. The
Wards have become somewhat famous from the
influential position Of their family in Kentucky,
and the public scandal in connexion with the cell
ebrated divorce of Miss Sallie Ward from Colonel
Lawrence now attache of the American embas-
sy 10 London


Mr.. Mat Ward has acquired something of a
celebrity by a book of travels in England--the
English Items"" published by the Appletons of
New York Ward, however, is said TO have had
the aid of Butler in its literary composition. But
ler had been formerly terms Of the closest in
timacy with the Ward family, having been once
their private tutor and travelling companion. The
Cincinnati Commercial, referring 10 the progress
of the trial, says:


1--WE observe, by what has been published of
the trial, that the policy pursued by the counsel
for the defence in this case is similar 10 that usu-
ally adopted in others, where the object is to pro-
cure an acquittal irrespective of the question Of
guilt or innocence. The courthouse and vicinity
is thronged wththe friends of the accused. Emf
nent advocates are permitted 10 torture and insult
the witnesses for the State, and TO distort their
testimony Attempts are being made 10 put the
prosecution upon the defensive, and give il the
character of prosecution OF innocent individuals.
Time is consumed in wrangllng over pretended
questions of law before the court, but intended 10
misead and prejudice the jury. Essays are made
to show that the defendants the victims of vio-
lent and groundless popular prejudice, and that
there is imminent danger that the accused will be
sacrificed TO public thirst for blood. What will
be the result, we are unable 10 predict; but that
justice may take place is our most devout wish
and prayer""

tragedy. The Vuginiaa says:


son Saturday, while sitting with his wife, in
company with members of the family, without
warning or sign of any character, he seized her
and inflicted trightful cash upon her throat with
a pocket-knife She attempted TO escape, but he
rushed after her and succeeded in inflicting two
other cuts. She staggered out of the house and
fell in the yard. His attention was then arrested
by the children of his brother, DIR. Lambeth, and
he made an attempt to seize them, but was thwar-
ed by negro woman, who threw them over the
paing. He then made at his uncle, Mr., Bingham,
but, he escaping, the murdcrous but unconscious
maniac returned TO the spot where his wife lay,
and tore the bloody knife across his own throat
falling and dying almost instantly. II is believed
that while engaged in the struggle with his wife
he inflicted one or two cuts upon his owu throat.
His mother, having interposed TO shield his wife,
received an accidental cash on the hand


""Dr- Murrell was soon in attendance, and sue
ceeded in arresting the homorrhage from the
wound of the unfortunate wife, and restoring con-
sciousness for awhile; during which time she en-
gagged in conversation, and true 10 the instincts OF
the wife, exclaiming TO the last oh, my dear hus
band But the loss Of blood had been SO great be-
fore the doctors arrival that it was impossible TO
save her, and she died in three quarters of an
hour""


Murder at Sea.-The Panama Star ofthe 10th

ger on board the steamship Yankee Blade, detailing
the particulars Of the murder of Miss Susanna
Russell by Edward H Avery, Of Springfield Mas

passage for her on board the Yankee Bladc for
California, and agreed TO work his own passage
He represented her, the writer says, as his sister,

said TO have become jealous of her from attentions
which she received from some of the other pas

near her person, he plunged Bowie-knife into
her right breast, severiug the ephemeral artery,
the knife passing through her back. She only
lived about five minutes. Immediately after COM
mitting this deed, he snapped pistol twice at his
own breast, but finding II would not go OH, he
drew razor from his pocket, with which he cut
deep and severe cash in his throat; but the
surgeon succeeded in sewing up the wound, and

We have heretofore exposed the inten-

what they desred-the passage of reso-
luton in favor of the Senatorial election.
A number of gentlemen attended deter
mined to prevent any action of the kind,
and who have, with the exception of
few who have been whipped into the
Broderick Traces steadily opposed this
outrageous scheme ever since. To these
faithful Democrats the party owe much;
hut to the faithless partizan who would
sacrifice every democratic principle at the
shrine of his personal ambition nothing is
due. And we are glad to know that the
people of this county are determined to
select from the Democratic masses men
who have steadily and honestly opposed
the great Senatorial fraud, and who will
never sacrifice the principles of their
party to crafty the blind ambition of one
man. We say, we are pleased to know
this fact, and the editor of the Democrat

The Albany Evening Transcript is responsible
for the following, which is so much in unison with
our own views, that We commend the article to
the particular attention of our readers:


J Wesdo not profess much knowledge OF phre-
nology, but venture to say, that if head which
should be the type of American chronological
development could be obtained, the bumps indi-
eating want of care, recklessness and rreverence,
would be more largely developed than in the spec
linen head of any other nation. There are many
reasons why this is so, but why the alarming
increase in size of these bumps should not be
checked. The enormous labor we have had to
perform, as a nation, since fathers first began
to colonze the country, has led us to acquire a
rapid method of transacting business, has induced
a want of preciseness and completeness in our
habits, which has tended to impart the appear
ance Of not to give the reality, of carelessness or
recklessness, to our characters. Thus far we are,
as a nation, exonerated from the charge which
foreigners bring against us, of that vice which we
ourselves must see has existence, although, in
a measure, innocenty, as far as we concerned
individually. But our progress is carrying us
ahead rapidly, and, in fact, has already borne
beyond the furthcrest point which any other ma
tion has reached, we have time to correct the err
rors circumstances have developed in our charac-
ter, and to restrict the proclivity which may prove
fatal to the perpetuty Of our institutions.


This national reckessness has of late been ex-
hibited in many different forms-some painful and
distressing, others ludicrous; but all warning us
that it is time the check should be applied to
desire to outstrip all others in the march of inn
provcment. 1t has been exhibited in the terrible
accid nts that have occurred within our territory.
or to our citizens elscwhere-in the tendency
American patriotism has shown to appropriate to
the realm Of freedom, despite the law of nations
and our national contracts, soil enslaved by des-
potism-in the disregard of individual rights, of
personal liberty, of the legal barriers erected for
the safety and security of life and property.
The result of this national recklessness has ta-
ken so many forms-railway, steamboat, and
nautical accidents of all kinds, Lynch law, pro-
cedures, fillibustering and reckless speculation
that we cannot pause to illustrate its pcrnicious
and fatal tendency by example. We have strong
belief in the good sense Of Americans generally,
and think that where the nationa..will has been so
steadily and uncompromisingly directed towards
the removal of the natural obstacles in the way
of cultivation and colonization-towards the ele-
vation of the mental and moral instincts Of the
people-towards the opening of the great chan
nes that lead to wealth and power-there should
be a conservative, restraining influence, brought
to bear by that same will, by that same sense and
judgment, upon the exultation which follows the
greatest victory mind has yet achieved


If, as people, we will stop to think before
cmbarkng rashly in speculation and adventure,
as heretofore we have been too apt to do-if we
will learn to regard human life as of greater inn
portance than the speed of our locomotives and
steamships, and national honor at stake in the
performance of our part of treaties and compacts
entered into by our government, then we will have
accomplished the great result that all thinking
men should aim at-the correction of our great
fault, national reckessness.

close TO our own doors. As yet, however,
from our experience Of the time and man.
ner of its approach, it appears to migrate
from East to West In the words of Mr..
Simon 1T filtered along the blending line
of land and water, the shore, the river bank
and the marsh Conducted by the Odor
and the Vistula, from the swamps of Poland
to the ports of the Baltic. it ragged east and
west from St. Petersburg to Copenhagen,
with frightful severity, and obedient to old
precedents, has let US witness its arrival in
Hamburg. Twice previously, and again in
this, its third visitation, travelling from the
last mentioned town, it has reached the
northeastern seaports of our islands""
1t is forcibly and emphatically declared
by Mr.. Simon, that the epidemic preva-
lence of the cholera does not arise in some
new cloud of venom floating above reach
and control, high over successive lands, and
raining down upon them without difference
its prepared distillaton of death but that
so far as scientific analysis can decide, it
depends on one occasional phase Of an infu-
ence which is always about US, on one
change of materials which in their other
changes give rise to other ills that these
materials, so perilously prone to explode in
to one or other breath OF epidemic pestilence,
are the dense exhalations of animal un-
cleanliness. which infect, in varying proper
tion, the entire area of our metropolis'-
In short. it appears now to be a matter of
comparative certainty. that if there be pres
ent DO foul hot-bed Of corruption for the re-
ception and developent Of the migrating fer
ment, the complete poison will Lot be gene
rated.


We may here notice a singular observa-
ton, which shows the influence Of increased
temperature on the development of morbid
poisons, and the increase of mortality cob
sequent thereon. In the healthier districts
Of the city of London, it is shown by the
tables that the cold season produced its usu-
al effect in a higher rate Of mortality, in
accordance with the well known unfavora-
bic influence Of irclemercy of the weather
on the aged and infrm. But in tho un-
healthier districts, the rate of mortality in
the hot and cold months is exactly reversed,
and sumner becomes the fatal season This
is shown by Mr.. Simon from the olServa-
i0ns of other diseases which result from
the defective sanitary conditions; and it may
be presumed that the result will be seen
still more strongly marked curing the pro
bable prevalence Of cholera in the ensuing
London summer.


The cause, then, of the disease being so
clear, We have not far to seek for a prevent
ative We are all familiar with the old re-
plies of Demosthenes when asked what was
the chief part of an orator. We may init
mate the questions and answers in the pre-
sent instance. What is The chief remedy
for this evil? Cleanliness What next?
Cleanliness What next again ? Still
cleanliness of the city, of the
house. of the person. When this first and
last requisite shall be fully attained, then
the deadly enemy will be stripped of all
power to harm us; then the subtle ven
om' will be to Us so subtileth its presence
will never more be recognized. The pres
ence of the touchstone of poison will be lit
/ tie matter when the development of the
poison is no longer possible. But, alas here,
as in many departments Of the healing art.
/ it is far easier to point cut the effect which
We desire to produce, than to find the due
means to accomplish our end.


VANITY OF LIFE-The following, from a
late speech of Mr. Benton, lisa touching ex-
hibition of the vanity of political ambition :


I have gone through a contest to which
| have no heart, and into which | was
forced by combination against life and hon
or, and from which gladly escape. What
is a seat in Congress to me? have sat
thirty years in the highest branch Of Con
oress. have made name to which can add
nothing, and l should only be anxious to
say, what has been gained Z? | have do
mestic affections, sorely lacerated in these
latter times wife whom have never
neglected, and who needs my attention now
more than ever children, some separated
from me by the expanse Of oceans and con-
tinents, others by the slender bonds which
separate them from eternity. | touch the
age which the psalmist assigns as the limit
of manly life, and must be thoughtless in
deed, if | do not think Of something beyond
the fitting and shadowy pursuits Of this life,
of all of which l have seen the vanity.--
What is MY occupation Ask the under
taker that good Mr.. Lynch, whose face.
present on SO many mournful occasions, mas


becume pleasant to me. He knows what
occupies my thoughts and cares; gathering
the bones of the dead-a mother sister,
two sons, grand-child planting the cy-
press over assembled graves, and marking
the spot where and those who are most
dear to me are soon to be laid.


When man stops his newspaper on ac-


count of pecuniary forebodings, we consider


him about as gone case as if he should


conclude to stop bis daily bread for fear lie
eaor1d come To royerty"
