JUAN B. ARIS3IENDI. CARACAS, Feb. 25, 1880.",,"

 The following views from the Lynch burgh yirginian, in relation to the ac- qulsition of the Canadas, are cogent and enlightened. We hope every man who values the Union, will set his face firmly and steadfastly, against the purchase ol another foot of Territory. Political scheners forends of selfish and crooked ambition, can only think, that spreading l5 degrees of latitude, and from the At lantic to the Pacific, we have not land enough. The claims now set up by some of the new States to the National lands, as a right pertaining to their Sovereign ty, reads lesson which ought net to be disregarded.- Constitutional Wklg.

 The Canadas. An energetic and for cible writer in the Boston Patriot adyo- cates with earnestness the "" purchase of the Canadas.n He takes the broad ground that as the Instructions to the navigation of the Mississippi, and a de- sire to avoid hostile collision with France and Spain, induced the United States to purchase Louisiana and Florida, so q similar state of things with regard to the navigation of the St..Lawrence, and to the safety of our Northern and North eastern frontier, in case of war with Great Britain, should influence us to at tempt the acquisition of the Canadas. The extension of our territory, already spreading over such vast and untra- yelled space, 1t seems to US Is net at all desirable. i'he annexation of the Ga nadas to the Union, however, independ- ent of this consideration, is matter el extremely doubtful policy. Enlighten- ed as the people of those colonies are and at any moment possessing the pow If they had the disposition to shake of their provincial character, and thei1 monarehiai form of government, they 1 have, on the contrary. .manifestedastrong attachment to their condition, in the midst of the calamities of war, and ever while they were oppressed in peace.- We do not, therefore, feel any anxiety to purchase them, when their transfer from monarehiaI to republican form of government might be- and apparently would be, so dissonant to their feeling and wishes. There are already enougf causes existing to accelerate dissolu tion of the Union, without voluntaril, adding this to it. But, it will be time enough to enter into more serious ane full discussion of the question when hl go9er7anaent shall show any disposition tt embrace within it's grasp either Canada iii the north, or Texas in the sonth.- The population of Canada is said to be about 750,000 and rapidly increasing."

 The Richmond Wing gives the following

 called for the examination of this case. On

 course, three weeks hence. Granted.

 The prisoner appears to be about 25 years

 about two years of age. Her husband was

 also in cOnsk She seemed to feel deeply the awful nature0f her situation. Awful indeed

 tt is-especially when c0ntrasted with what she was a few years ago, befure her marriage. . She is represented by those who then knew herin Norfolk, where she was brought up

 and married, to have been the admiration of the circle in which she moved, as we'll for < Fer personal heauty, as for her amabe con- \ duet. What has brought her step by step from that happy. to her present miserable 3 state, IS generally known; but it is not our e province, at least at this time, to speak oft.

 It will be remembered, that for the last two weeks, we have promised to give our readers 3. synopsis of the trial of JosEpH BowERs, for the murder of Samuel I1yaeh, Jr. of Miller county. At the time this pledge was made, we had the assurance of the Counsel concerned in the case, fnot having ourself been present during the trial to furnish us with the testimony to- 9 gether with the outlines of said trial.- This information, we regret to say, we have failed to obtain. Ne will, therefore, 4 have to content ourself with making few q desnltory remarks, taking as our data com mon report.

 < The trial Of said Bowers was taken up on # Friday morning, l6th ut. The whole of Friday was consumed by the Court, in en- deaYoring to obtain a jury, and not suc- ceeding, adjourned until the Monday fol- lowing, when the case was again taken up, and on Tuesday, full jury was impannel. fedsin the course of the forenoon.

 The testimony appears to have been full and conclusive. The offence was com mitted upon the body of a youth of r E years, who had in no way offended, much I less injured the perpetrator. It also ap- pears that young Lynch, seeing his father engaged in fight fought in his defence, and wounded one of the assailants of his { father-he was afterwards taken into GUS < tody, and while in custody, Bowers entered the room through window, and with a # tailor's press board, held in both hands, 2 2 struck Lynch violent blow on the right side of the head, which fractured the scuil, < and terminated in death on the the same # evening.

 About dark on Tuesday evening, the s s ease was submitted to the jury, who, after having been together only few minutes, returned into Court with verdict of @ GUILTY.

 The prisoners Counsel moved an arrest % of judgment, on the ground of defects in she indictment in laying the venue. The offence charged, having been committed in the Indian country, and beyond the civil Jurisdiction of the Territory, was founded Aon certain acts of Congress, relating to 8such offences. The defects pointed out in tte indictment were confidently expected to be sustained, by the Counsel on the part of the prisoner, who urged upon the Court enat the acts of Congress giving jurisdio- Ron of such offences, had not been strictly ~ # compiled with, in stating the charge in the z indictment. The motion after having oeen laboriously argued, was after advise & nent overruled by the Court.
