LYNCHBURs, VIRGINIA.",,"Lynchburg lies. At midday strolled out


to survey the town. The September sun


poured terrible heat upon the broad james


River, which, opposite the network of
tracks at the depot, flowed placidly at the


base Of an immense cliff, from whose stony
sides quarrymen were blasting and chisel-


ing blocks for building purposes. A few


RATS and fat-boa,s, steered by bare-armed
and bare-hcaded negroes, drifted lazily on


the stream. Along covered bridge spanned


the water, and glance through its little


windows showed quaint mills and houses


upon the banks, high bluffs, crowned with


humble cabins, were rendered accessible


by precipitous paths and flights of stone
steps and, in the distance, were blue out
lines Of mountains, with tiny cloud -wreaths
around them.


Returning from the bridge toward the


town | came to a wide street, stretching
straight up the hill. On either side were
stone pavements, crowded with negroes
colored children gamboled on the flags
colored mammas smoked pipes in the door


ways Of shops, where colored fathers sold
apples, beer and whisky colored damsels,


with baskets Of clean linen in their stout
arms, joked with colored boatmcn from
the canal colored draymen cursed and
pounded their mules as they hurried down

sloped other streets filed with roomy TO-


bacco warehouses, and with rows of un-
painted dwellings half way up the hill


broad and well-built business avenue cross
cd at right angles, and there, at last one
saw white people, and the ordinary sights


of a city. The plaintive sound of horn


was heard above the hustle Of traffic ; it was
in the hands of negro, summoning to-


bacco buyers to an auction. Entering the
warehouse, one saw hogsheads of the pop
ular herb opened and inspected, and heard
the familiar jargon of the auctioneer.


Turning once more towards the ascent
of the hill, came into an open-air market,
which, for picturesqueness, wed with any
in Italy or Spain. On the curbing of the
sidewalk, aud even on the stones in the
middle Of the square, dozens Of negro
women were seated before baskets con-
tanning vegetables, or various goods Of
trivial description. One venerable matron,
weighing, perhaps, two hundred pounds,
had her profuse chignon overtopped by a
dilapidated beaver, and was smoking a clay
pipe. Many young women were cleanly
and nicely dressed, and had folded back
the huge flaps OF their siarched un-bon-
nets, so that they seemed to initiate the
head-dresses of the Italian maidens at
Sorrento; and hosts of colored buyers,
market-baskets in hand, hovered from one
seller to another, talking in high-pitched
voices, and in dialect which Northern
ears found difficult to understand. Leay.
ing the market, and yet ascending, / came
to another broad street, lined with comfor-
table dwellings, and, looking, saw, still far
above me, the Courthouse perched on
the topmost point


Lynchburg lies ''among the mountains,
on the south bank of the James River,
nearly in the center of the Piedmont dis
trict of Virginia, and not far from the base

population, and one Of the most remarka.

fortunes were amassed and enjoyed there,
in the days when internal revenue was not,
and slave labor titled the fields; when the
products Of tho Virginian and North Car
Gilman plantations filed its warehouses and
manufactures to bursting, and all Europe
came to buy. An Irish emigrant gave his
name, in 1856, to the town; and the ia
nous term ""Lynch law"" now so universal,
sprang from the summary manner in which
this hot-headed Hibernian,--a colonel in
the Revolutionary army,--treated such
tories as were caught by him. During the
late war the town did not fall into Federal
hands. The tide Of war flowed all around
it, but never mounted to the summit ofth
reddish hills on which it had safely perched.

The mostimportant rencounter that
has taken place in the streets of New
Orleans was one between ex. Cover
nor Yarmouth and Dan. G. Byerly,
manager of the New Orleans Bulletin.
Yarmouth and Byerly met on the
street. ard without exchanging O
word Byerly knocked Yarmouth
down with a club. when the latter
drew knife aud stabbed his antago-
mist six times, from the effects Of
which Byerly soon afterward died.
Yarmouth was arrested and put in
prison.


The riots so far have been confined
principally to small parties of negroes
and whites. which generally result in
several negroes getting killed. while
the whites entirely escape. What
will be the end of this deplorable state
of affairs is not easily determined,
but the end is not yet.


From the beginning of the election
campaign in Louisiana, the white
leaguers determined and pledged
themselves to ban and prescribe all
republicans, black or white; and
openly declared. as well as secretly,
that they would elect their men at all
hazards. And for this end they have
imtlmidated voters contrary to law.
and tampered with ballot boxes, and
because they are brought to account
for their misdeeds, and their knavery
exposed, and because justice in some
degree is being enforced by the re-
turning board, they who break laws
and set at defiance all law and right
by the might of their secret COM bina-
tions, proceed TO knock down those
they cannot vote down. and to threat
on even resistance to national author
ity. Let them resist. They will,
possible, ""get their rights"" again as
they got them at the end Of the Jeff
Davis rebellion. It is hoped that at
all events they will got their just de-
serts."

RICHMOND, Sept. Z, 1874.


The proposition of the HERALD to call national
convention for the purpose Of considering the war,
its causes, consequences and results and now best
the Union can adjust itself to the new condition OF
aairs has attracted good deal OF attention among
the leading politicians and statesmen of the South.
1t is very fav0raby discussed and seems to
meet the general appreciation of the really con.
servative men OF this section. AS proof OF this
l called on no less distinguished gentleman than
Governor Henry A. Wise, in his law ofice, to whom
handed copy OF the HERALD OF the 4th inst.
with the request that he would read the leading
article and give me his views upon the PROPOSE
tions treated OF In 1t. He carefully peruseG the
editorial, and, without any further preliminary
conversation in reply to the general inquiry Of
what his views were, the Governor answered.


Views OF Governor Wise.


A ""called session Of Congress- was to be depre.
Gated. There Is no condition OF the South which
calls for any extraordinary measure OF the sort.
Any extraordinary exertion Of federal power will,
just now especially, exaggerate any existing evils
and exasperate oil the antagonisms which
threaten collision. The South mas been seven
years in the exhausted receiver OF politics, and
very naturally makes some throes for breath.

WILL first OF all, herself seek repose and need be
only let alone. Drive OF the vultures and vermn
and she can be resuscitated In q reasonable time
Constabulary force Is sufficient without the order
ing or stationing OF any military force by the
federal authority. The latter should never be
resorted to but when called for by the federal
Judges, or BY state executive and judicial power,
In cases OF serious insurrectiOn, where the
laws, state and federal cannot be exc
cuted without military force. IL Is quite

OF mobs or mere Lynch law violence. The North

SEIZURE OP A BRITISH STEAMER BY TnB

senger steamer by the Turkish authorities


Messrs. Lynch Brothers, OF this place. lately i'm
ported small steamer, Ell Burk, to ply with pas
sengers between Mahommerah ""a Persian pOrt)
and busreh The ii Burk had made but few
voyages under the British dag when the Governor
OF Busreh addressed protest to the British Vice
Consulate here against her running, on the
ground that the Porte had not been asked for
It's permission, and demanding her detention.
Her Majesty's Vice Consul, replying TO this
communication, stated that as Manommerah
was u foreign port ana Busren free
port, open to foreign trade, 1t was not in any way
necessary to ask the permission OF the Porte TO
enable her TO trade between those places; but
that the affair should, however, be referred to
Her Majesty's Consul General at Bagdad, on re-
cept OF whose reply the nature OF it should be
communicated. The Governor, however, would
not walt lor this; but the same day, without any
further notice the Admiral, a. his request, seized
the FL Burk and towed her under the guns OF the
guardship KhoJa Beg, lying at the entrance to
Busreh creek. Here the FL Burk lay for five days,
wncn her Malesty's Vice Consul received an ntl-
nation rom the Governor TO say that 1.-THE Porte
had oeen graciOusly pleased to order ner release""
The seizure OF this vessel II need hardly be said,
was illegal In every respect; contraventton OF
the articles o 4 treaty. and q direct insult TO the
British nag. AS yet no apology has been added to
the curt order OF release. The owners OF the FL
Burk intend pushing their claim Tor damages."

which we took before we acted.


Mr.. Chrigty. In this connection desire TO
say that we have awitness now under subpoena
the president of the company which has oc-
copied streets, we are informed, not only In the
city Of Washington, but also In the city Of
Georgetown-and he may be present-who
could perhaps give us this information. We
desire not simply that the principle should be
stated, or rather the claim admitted, but we
desire to go beyond that, and offer proof as to
the extent to which these railways have been
laid. We have proved, of course, in the testi-
mony of Mr., Cullinane in regard to Four-and-
s-half street. The question Of time Is material.
In several Of these charges # Is very important:


Mr.. Jewett. II the location and the extent OF
the railroad-time when laid-can all be agreed
upon between the parties II would be well.


Mr. Christy. Then we are content.


Governor shepherd. We should be glad to do


Mr.. Christy. And the charters likewise being
produced.


Governor Shepherd. We will furnish the ad-
vice upon which we acted.


The Witness, (Mr. Lynch.) I will state that
they laid the track beyond where the charter
required them 10 90. The charter confined
them to Ninth street, and they went to
Eleventh.


By Mr.. Jewett, Ito the witness, Mr.. Lynch }
Q. What have you TO say about the lowering
of the Waterman and the water connecticut
A. The Waterman running down East Capitol
street, when they commenced to improve there
I would state after the first improvement In
1873 was made the grade was very little. The
curbs for the foot pavement were nearly the
same before they touched the street at all. The
crown of the street, principally, was taken oil
The Waterman was lowered some four feet,
think; lead connections made to all the vacant
lots, and the next day some of them plowed up
The Waterman, afOer being lowered, was filled
in, puddled down, and settled, and some two
or three weeks after 1t was lowered six feet
more, again filed in, puddled, settled down.
and in a few weeks afterward 1t was taken
away entirely. Then a four-inch pipe ran or
each side of the street, which was great con-
venience to property-holders.


Q. Is it q great convenience A. Yes, sir,


G. But at great expense l should suppose
for the various changes? A. Yes, sir; twenty.
five and thirty men at work q week at q time


Q. By whose direction were those changes
made? A do not know.


Q. Was that work done by contract? A.
am not able to say. All know is that It wal
done, I presume, by the Board of Public
Works.


@. Who had charge of it, any officer of the
Board of Public Worksl A. There was q mar
by the name of Fletcher who had charge of the
lowering of the main. think a man by the
name Of Rothwell made all of the bad connec
tions. He had to break his connections twice
and finally took away all of his pipe.


Mr.. Chtisty. We desire, also, that this wit
ness should be asked as to the extent to which
the improvement for the railway was com
pieted.


By Mr.. Jewett: Q. Was the improvement
for the railway completed previous to the lay.
ing of the railings2 A. The entire railroad-it
was as complete q railroad as it could be. ex
cept the iron rails.


Q. Everything else was donel A. Yes, sir
and portion of the iron rails down on Eleventh
street, where 1t turns on Eleventh, the iror
was there, and the very moment after we re.
ceived our bills-I don't think it was but few
days afterward-they commenced laying the
iron rails.


Q. Immediately after this pavement was
laid and the track prepared, at the expense oi
the individual property owners, then the com.
pany followed It up with their rails? A Yes
sir; few days-not long after we received our
bills for the improvements.


Mr.. Jewett, Ito Governor Shepherd.) ]



Were those railroads, under the circumstance
stated here now by Mr.. Lynch, run in front OF
Government property or through Government
reservations Did you collect from the Govern.
ment the full amount for preparing that street!


Governor Shepherd. The Government Is
treated just as the property owner under the
law. We acted in accordance with the legal
advice of our counsel. / will state that we
have had two or three controversies with those
and
sylvania avenue east, and tried to carry out the
law there, but we were enjoined, and the court
divided on it, so that 1t requires new legisla-
tiOn on the subject.


Mr. Christy. desire the Governor to state
what company that was-the one with whom
he had the controversy


Governor Shepherd. It was the Washington
and Georgetown railroad.


By Mr.. Wilson, Ito witness, Mr.. Lynch:) Q.
What was done with the curbing that was
hauled away from East Capitol street, A.
Well, sir, it was taken away. do not know
exactly what became of it.


@. Who hauled it awayl A. The parties
who hauled 1t away-I do not know whether
they were in the employ of the board.


Q. You do not know where they took ~ A.
No, sir.


Q. In this wooden pavement-the last pave
ment that was put down-had the grading all
L LlerG
nowl A. You know they changed the grading
last year in one square -ouly, between First and
Second That was cut down according to the
grade established by Congress. The former
one was done in violation Of that.


Q. That is not what am talking about. Had
the grading been done ready to receive the
pavement A Yes, sir. OF course they could
not have put down the wooden pavement other
wise.


Q. Did the man putting down the wooden
pavement have any grading to do before he
could put it dowul A. o, no, sir; the contrac-
tor did that. All the man who laid wooden
did was TO put the sand along there,
or what he cailed sand.


Q. Was the grading done by one contractor,
and the wooden pavement put down by anotheri
A. Yes, sir; the last grading was done Just pre-
vious to the laying of the wooden pavement by
Andrew Gleason.


Q. Who put down the wooden pavement A..
A man by the name of Albert Gleason put down
the wood pavement. He was O sub-contractor
with John o. Evans.


By Mr.. Mattingly: Q. This stone pavement
that you refer 10 as having been laid, did not
the property holders petition TO have that re-
moved and q wooden pavement put down IN
stead? A. That might have been. The prop
erty-holders petitioned for two or three differ
ent kinds on that street.


Q. Did they not insist on the stone being
taken up and the wooden pavement put DOWN
A. / do not know that


Q. Do you not know that there was dele
cation there waiting on the boardl A. Yes,
sir; l was one to get the board to carry out
their first contract-to have It macademized
TO the contract with Fletcher.


Q. But after the stone pavement was down,
10 you not know that there was delegation
here to have 1t taken upl A. understood
here was.


Mr.. Christy. would like the witness to be
nterrogated in regard to the grading upon that
street and adjoining streets, as to the places
where the dirt was deposited.


By the Chairman: Q. Do you know where
The dirt taken from that street was deposited
g.: Yes, sir; great deal was deposited inside
Of the Capitol grounds.


Q. Where was the balance of 1t takena A.
The contractors told me themselves they were
selling 1t TO Mr.. Clark.


Q. Where was the balance of It taken tot A
do not know. There was very little but what
was taken here.


By Mr.. Christy: Q. Do you know as to the
trading upen any other streets in the vicinity
'f the Capitol A. Not of my own knowledge.
The committee took recess until O'Clock

am glad, for the honor of the county, to
say that the j. F. Mcguire National Testimo-
nial movement has turned out a very respecta-


bic success. About ten thousand pounds in all


were collected, three or four thousand of which


Mr.. Mcguire lived to receive. The rest has


been invested in the names of trustees in Dub


lin and Cork, for the benefit of his wife and
children, and will, it has been stated, suffice
for their maintenance in comfort if not in
afiuence. 1t is to be noted that this subscrip-
tion for Mr.. Magnire, with the single exception
of that for Captain Nolan, NJ. P. for Galway, is
the largest got up in Ireland for any public
man or object, for the last quarter of century.
The subscription to the OConnell National
Monument amounted to only about ES0GO or


G90e0. And John Francis Mcguire deserved
it all and more. He will always figure in the
history of Ireland as a bold, and eloquent, and
consistent, and nnpurchasable champion at
once.of his religion and his country's rights.

movement are squelched. He still has his page
in the Irishman, and is publishing there vari-
ous little spiteful things against the Home
Rule movement But that is all he is doing,
and that is all he can do. MIR. Egan's accusa-
sation that he was wirepulling "" for the paid
Secretaryship of the Home Rule League and
that it was his failure to get that post that
made him a deserter, Mr.. Smyth has denied.
But Mr. Egan in letter to the Nation chal-
lenges him to deny that he expressed to Mr.
Butt his willingness to accept that post if it
were offered him. We have to see what Mr..
smyth will have to say to that. MIR. Butt, at
Mr. efafa
ment. Besides, proofs are accumulating that
Mr. Smyth in denouncing Federalism, is about
the most Inconsistent politician ever heard of.
1t now turns ont that he was one of the origi-
nal committee which IN 1870 first promulgated
the Federal proposal that it was actually
upon his motion that the terms of the requisition
for the National onference of November last,
which affirm the Federal proposal, were adopt
ed and that when he was first elected for
Westmeath, he placarded at his own expense
and traded upon resolution of the Home
Government Association which declared him
worthy Of support having adopted tEeir
principles. Yet Mr.. Smyth now denounces the
Federal proposal dishonerabte and degra-
ding! All because he has found it impossible
to be the leader of the national movement
He has appealed in sort of way to the Fenian
party but they will not touch him with
forty foot pole, for they recollect that when
they appealed to him as editor of the Irishn'dn
for support in 1865, he refused and opposed
them. He is applauded by only one party in
this Countrywide bigoted anti-Irish Protestant
party. Last Saturday the Dublin Evening Mail,
one of the organs of this party, published an
article in which it represented him as having
at last succeeded in his object. A small party
of Irishmen in Stafford England) had formed
themselves into a I"" Simple Repeal"" Club, and
had published an address echoiDg his senti
ments and probably written by him. That was
the sole foundation for the article in the Nal,
and even this slender one was knocked away
completely on she following day by the an
nouncement that the Anti-Home Rule Repeal
Club of Salford had collapsed and been dis
solved!


Since Pistol swallowed the leek there has

The Pope in answer to the announcement of
the withdrawal of the ship-of-war Orenoqne,

Subsequently, the act of March IS, 1869, pledged the faith of he United States to make provisions at the earliest practi- ticable period for their redemption in coin. Initiatory steps towards the fulfllment of this pledge ought no longer be delayed, he says. As 8 preliminary step, the 'a:v making the notes legal tender ought to Dc repealed the repeal to take effect at some future date-bay, in three years. At the same time authority should be given for the redemption of the notes in bonds bearing a low rate of interest, which, while inviting their conversion, should not be so high suddenly to increase their value.

rotng came into vogue there was no law TINT
could in any way arrest it We are quite sure
that if tho kidnappers of Charley Ross could
be arrested and within twenty-four hours of

o tree the universal sense Of the community
would be that they had swift and speedy
justice. If there were any possible case in
which we should be disposed to regard Lynch
law as ''higher law"" in criminal juris-
prudence it would be in that of these nefari-
Gus men IN Philadelphia. But as that is not
to be considered, then we should take lesson
from the English. AS soon as it was found
that there were villains capable of assaultinS
peaceable men on the highway for pur-
poses of robbery law was passed
declaring that all prisoners convicted
of the offence should, in addition
to Imprisonment, be aogged. The re-
suit of the law has been that the crime
is almost extinct Experience shows that
foggng is the one punishment that the GRIM
inal breads We should be far from welcom-
ing the return of this custom, or of anything
that looked like the pillory or the whipping
post, but law flosging men found guilty of
kidnapping, and in addition imposing upon
them q long term of Imprisonment at hard
labor, would do more to suppress the crime
than any other expedient. We think also that
nothing should be done in Philadelphia to in
terfere with justice The first duty of the
officers of the law ia to discover these offenders
and punish them. However painful it may be
to the family, nothing could be moro unwlse
than for the officers to make such terms with
the kidnappers that they could escape with
impunity. If this is once demonstrated then
no child in the community is safe. Let every
effort be made to restore the boy, but none
that will in any way compromise the crime
or permit immunity to the merciless scoun-
drels who have committed it."

orders issued and sne correspondence wnich,
Ondciauy passed in what was then and subsequently
done. More serious trouble Is anticipated next
January than any which has yet occurred TO mar
the peace Of the State. or this the President has
Deen fully advised, and the sorry condition OF
afrairs in Louisiana as well as Arkansas exeltes
serious attention on his part.


This weeks HERALDs dispatches from New Or.
leans, already published, narrate that The White
League OF that city threatens to lynch the men,
bers OF the Returning Board and that the White
League OF Shreveport volunteers to march down
and assist In the fell work. few days ago the
Shreveport Times, which Is conceded by the re-
publicans to be the ablest democratic organ In the
State OF Louisiana, demanded that every man,
from Congressman to constable, whom the Board
should return as elected should be killed. All
these facts are IN the Presidents possession and,
while he is most heartily dlsgusted with the un-
settled condition OF alairs, in which he has the
sympathy Of the Attorney General, ne recognizes
the obligation to prevent anarchy and stay riot.
The defiant attitude Of the people OF Louisiana Is
thought to portend mischief, and 1t s generally
apprehended in administration circles that In
January, when the Legislature shall assemble,
White League rides VIII gainsay the title OF many
of those returned by the Board. 1t is SAID that
the lear OF federal interference win not deter the
League from making It's effort any more than did
the two years. Executive recognition OF the de
6ucto government dissuade that League from Its
bold experiment Of september last And YET the
President has been assured that large element

Judge Lynch, Of the Fourth District Court
in the following case:


Charles T. Howard VS.. f. T. Denechand snd nj.


Egan. Constable. No. 42.557. Fourth District


Court, Parish Of Orleans.


The plaintiff in this case alleges that IN tne
Third Justices Court for the PARISH OF w
leans E. F. Denechaud did institute a SUIT
against him for $40 %, on the lotn o. 'uiy
1873. at which time and since, plaintiff owed
said Denechaud nothing and without any
legal service Of citation, did proceed 70 taKe
default and final Judgment against s'id Peu,
toner for said amount, and without any le8ai
service of notice Of judgment upon petlroner'
did cause the issuance of writ OF Il. t0.
against him. to said constable, who thereupon,
on his own motion and by order OF said De-
nechaud, did proceed to levy said writ
by seizure and garnishment OF several
friends and business acquaintances OF
petitioner to his great and serious
damage and injury in his business,
and to his business reputation and credit, and
in his personal feelings: that the absolute
nullity Of all said proceedings OF said Dene-
chaud and said constable, was well known to
them when they took said proceedings ana
that said proceedings were taken by them
malic,ously and with the intention OF defraud-
ing him out of the amount OF said claim of
Denechaud, by preventing him from making
anv defense against such demand that the
said Denechaud and the said Egan, conspiring
together, did cause a false return to be made
upon the citation in said case, to the effect
that it had been served upon petitioners SER
want, at petitioners domici, upon which false
and fraudulent return said defendants herein
based their other proceedings against petit
toner, who never knew anything OF them un-
til garnishment process had been served upon
his friends. Petitioner prays for judgment
for the sum of $500, as damages, against de-
PENDANTS IN sOlidO.


The answer OF Denechaud is general de-
nial and special denial Of malice and fraud.
The Constable answers by general denial
and q call on Denechaud in warranty.


The record OF the suit in the Third JUS
tees Court is in evidence. 1t discloses the
fact that Chas T. Howard was sued in that
court on the 18th of July, 1873 on claim OF
$40 25; that citation issued, on which the
Constable made the following return:


""Received, New Orleans July ID, 1873, and
on the 18th day of July, 1873, l served a
true COPY Of the within citation, at the domi-
cile of the defendant, Chas. L. Howard. on
Prytania street, No 1872, in the hands of MI.
Joseph Lewis, above the age OF IA years. re-
siding there (facts which l have learned by
interrogating the said Joseph Lewis), defen-
dant being absent from the city.


A Judgment by default was entered, which
was afterwards confirmed and made final
Notice of judgment issued, and was served IN
like manner as the citation at No. 1872 Pry-
tsnia street. A writ Of il. fa issued to the
Constable. Before the return Of the writ,
citations and interrogatories issued to Pike,
Brother & Co., the Louisiana National Bank
and the Bank of America, as garnishees On
the 25th of August, 1873, Chas. T. Howard
applied to the Third District Court for and
Obtained writ Of Injunction restraining the
execution of the Judgment aforesaid. A
trial was had, and the Court perpetuated the
Injunction, with an order to the Justices s
Court to cause new citation to issue,
and to be served upon Charles T. Howard.
1 take the judgment Of the Third
District Court to be conclusive proof
of plaintiffs allegation, that he was not
legally cited by the Third Justices Court, and
under those circumstances the judgment of
the latter court was an absolute nullity, and
conferred no authority to seize the property
of Chas. T. Howard, either in his own posses
sion or in the hands Of third person. But
it is urged in behalf Of the defendants that
the Third District Court was without juris-
diction of the injunction suit in which the
inyalidity of the citation and notice Of judg-
ment was determined; that that court can
issue an injunction only when necessary to
carry out its appellate Jurisdiction that the
Third Justices Court alone had the authority
to enjoin its own judgments that the pro-
vision of section 2O13, revised statutes Of
1870, under which the injunction issued, is in
conflict with the portion Of article 126, Q. r,
which defines the jurisdiction of the Third
District Court, and that when such conflict
arises, the article of the code of practice
Overrides the said section OF the revised
statutes.


It is true that if there be such conflict the
article of the Code OF Practice must govern.
1t becomes necessary, therefore, Nor the Court
to ascertain whether or not the lawgiver has
given us two enactments during the year
1870 which are antagonistic to and inconsist-
ent with each other, to wit Sec. 2O13 Il.
Stat. and art 1876 G. P. The said section pro-
vides that ""in all cases when party shall
have cause to complain of any judgment by a
Justice of the Peace, or act of any Constable
of Justice of the Peace, or his deputies,
and shall think proper to apply to higher
court for relief, by writs of injunction, man.
damus, sequestration, action of nullty, OF
otherwise. it shall be to the Third District
Court only, and to no other that he shall
apply for relief.


Under section 2O14 Revised Statutes: ""The
District Courts OF the parish Of Orleans are
without jurisdiction in all civil cases when
the amount in dispute does not exceed 500,
exclusive of interest and costs, except the
Third District Court in its appellate jurisdic
ton""


Article 126 c. p, provides that the ''Third
District Court of the parish of Orleans shall
have exclusive jurisdiction Of appeals from
the Justice, of the Peace, and to restrain aud
enjoin seizures made under orders issued by
Justices Of the Peace for said parish, whether
the same be made under mesne or execution,
when the value of the property exceeds one
hundred dollars""


Taking said section 2Ol3 in connection with
the requirement of section 2Ol4, which fixes
the minimum amount necessary to give the
Third District Court original jurisdiction IN
case like the injunction suit brought by
Howard, l find no conflict between the pro.
visions Of those sections and those Of article
12G, C. P. On the contrary, the sections and
the articles aforesaid are in perfect accord

 A party of white men went to the cabins of two negroes, with the view of arresting and lodging them in jail, for some crime committed. They were fred upon from 8 cabin and one of the party instantly killed. The negroes then attempted to run to the woods, and they were both shot and killed by the party attempting to make the ar rest. The negroes of the vicinity armed, and the whites picketed the vii cinity.

 Two men, who were on one of the posts, halted negro who was coming into the town with sack of buckshot. He paid no attention to their command to halt, and ran off into the darkness, being fired at by one of the party, with out effect, however. The men immedi- ately went into town to report what had occurred, and were returning to their post, when they were accosted in the streets of Coushatta by two notorious negroes, armed. They had 8 few mo- ments' conversation with them, not of a violent nature, and had turned round to proceed to their post, when they One was mortally wounded, and the then ran off.

 That night and next morning T. g.. Edgarson, Homer s. Twitchell, R. A. Dewees, w. F. Howell, Q. Holland and M. O. Willis, all white, besides mum 2 Der of negroes, were arrested and placed under guard. All of the party who held office then voluntarily ten dered and wrote out their resignations. and they, with others, voluntarily pro- posed if guard was furnished them to Shreveport that they would leave the State and return no more. This was at once assented to, and the prisoners re- quested MT. John Carr to take charge of the guard for their protection. On Sunday morning, MT. Carr, with 8 guard of about sixteen men, started with the above-named prisoners, except the negroes released afterward. A party of between forty and fifty men, who had come into Coushatta, started in pursuit with the avowed purpose of lynching the prisoners. Later in the day MT. Carr was appraised of this fact and put his horses and those of the prisoners to the top of their speed to | avoid being overtaken. While nearing the Hutchinson plantation on Red river. some thirty miles below Shreve- port, with the view of crossing there and destroying the fatboat to prevent further pursuit, he was overtaken by the pursuing party. The guards were overpowered and the prisoners taken away from him, and three of them-Ed. garton, Twitchell, and Dewees- on the spot. The other three-Howell, Holland, and Willis were carried back short distance to near Wards store and there shot. The citizens in the neighborhood assembled the next morning and buried the bodies, the first three in a graveyard near Hutchin' sons plantation, and the last three or the spot where they had been killed near Wards store."

lYRoM THE SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT OF THE rRfBUEE'I


NASHVILLE, TenH., Oct l9.-The history OF the 0ip-
son County troubles and of the Julia Hayden murder
in this State is well known to the readers OF IS
TRIBUNE that have not considered special inves-
tigation of them necessary at this late day The at
tempt to give them political significance failed when
met by the energetic measures OF Gov Brown TO dis
cover and punish the guilty men, and the manufac-
tory of outrages in Tennessee for the Northern po-
litica market was found to be an Improbable bus
mess when such strong partisan as Senator Brown
low felt himself constrained to thank the Governor
publicly for the course he had pursued. My enief
object therefore, in calling at the Executive ONCE
during my visit to Nashville was to obtain better
understanding of the relations existing between
the Federal and State authorities in regard to these
cases. and to ascertain whether the interference of
the United States likely to result In promoting
Justice and bringing the murderers to speedy punish
ment or whether it promised to have contrary ef-
feet.


1t is no uncommon thing. as every lawyer knows.
for criminals about whose guilt there is and can be
no question to escape through the meshes OF the
law, especially when those meshes are strained or
broken by conflicting claims Of jurisdiction set up
by independent courts, or even when the officers OF
the same court fail properly to cooperate with each
other. ParadOxical it may seem, believe 1t is
fact that man has about twice as many chances OK
escaping conviction and punishment for his crimes
when two tribunals dispute the question Of jurls-
dction of his case as when he is called to answer
before the bar Of only one court.


DOUBLE JURISDICTION or A SINGLE CRIME


The Gibson County lynchers guilty Of murder
according to the laws of Tennessee but will be held
by the United States authorities If held at all, for
violating the Ku Klux or Enforcement act. In two
separate trials they might be convicted and
acquitted OF both Of these crimes and escape all
punishment. found curious instance Of this kind
among some late cases In the Supreme Court OF
Alabama which was looking over in Montgomery
the other day. The Grand Jury of the City Court
of Montgomery found several indictments against
two men caught in the act of rObbing house. Two
of these indictments were for burglary and for
burglary and grand larceny They were first
tried for burglary and convicted. The case
was appealed to the Supreme Court on
the ground that the crime described in the iDdict-
ment was known to the laws of Alabama as grand
larceny and not burglary, and that the men ought
therefore to have been acquitted of the latter crime
The Court sustained this plea. The men were then
taken back to the Court below and tried on the
second indictment for burglary and grand larceny


This time they were convicted of the former but not
of the latter. The case went to the Supreme Court
again on the plea that the men having once been
acquitted of burglary they could not again be tried
for that crime and that the last verdict was there
fore void. This position was sustained by the
Supreme Court and the men having been acquitted
Of both crimes discharged, although they had
really been convicted of both. IdOnt say that the
Gibson County murderers of this State are likely tc
escape in the same manner, but there is no doubt
that such thing is possible and know that Gov
Brown has been embarrassed more than he has beer
aided in his attempts to discover them by the Cnlteo
States officials.


TRUE HISTORY OF THE GIBSON COUNTY TROUBLES.
brief review of the case will think, fully dem.
onstrate this fact. The Gibson County trouble,
arose from threatened nsurrection OF the negroes
1t is matter of record that several of the negroes
who were arrested and who were aftcrward taker
out of Jail confessed that of their leaders, mar
in whom they all had confidence, and whom they
were bound to obey. told them that the time had
come when they should no longer work for til,
white people, but that they should arm themselves
form into companies. and kill the whites on GER
tain Tuesday. He told them that all the property
in the country was the product Of their labor anC
that Gen. Grant would sustain them in seizing it
The white people heard of these preparations, and
became greatly excited and alarmed especially
when they saw the negroes actually gathering, anc
bringing their guns. don't believe that the ne
groes would have dared to make an attack upon the
white people any way, and yet no one can blame the
citizens for preparing for selfprOteetion They did
So and, after a day or two of excitement, during
which many houses were deserted aud the people
gathered together where they could better deienC
themselves. some of the negroes were arrested anc
put into Jail. The first night they were guarded az
it was feared that an attempt to lynch them nigh
be made, but the excitement having apparently sub
sided. guard was not after that considered neces
sary.


The next night. as you will remember the jail
was broken open by large band of disguised men
and sixteen negroes were taken out 1t was reported
in the North and / suppose, is still generally be-
lieved that every one of them was killed. This i,
not true: four of them were killed, two wounded
and the other ten escaped unhurt.


ENERGETIC MEASURES OF GOV. BROWN.


Gov. Brown, desiring to give justice an Opport-
nifty to take its usual course in the courts without
the interference of the State authorities waited until
the last day of the term of the Circuit Court whichw
sitting at Trenton, and then did what suppose nc
Governor of State did before visited the scene
of the outrage consulted with the judge. caused .
special term of the court to BE- Immediately called
gew jury to be impaneled and employed detect
ives both professional and amateur, to work up the
case Up to this time the United States authorities
had taken no steps in the matter, aud while the
State investigation was proceeding, Gov. Brown
sent three times to the United States DistricAttOr
ney to ascertain If he had any evidence that
would assist in detecting the murderers. In each"

In the chair,


The Finance Committee recommen-
ded the acceptance of the Wilmington
Savings Funds proposition to change
the mortgage for $4,000 on the City
Hospital, held by the Society, into city
bonds Adopted.


Same committee reported that they
had examined the lien book, and found
q large number of liens still open salts
faction not having been entered. The
report recommended that the Auditor
be instructed to prepare book show
ing the settled and unsettled liens. -
Adopted.


The Street Committee reported in |
favor of granting permission to the Au-
tomato Telegraph Company, to erect |
poles on certain streets, provided the |
Company allow city business to be |
transmitted over the wires gratuitious- |
ly Adopted.


MIR, VIM. Candy, from this commit
tee, moved that the subject of macada-
mizing Fourth street, from Market to
Orange be laid over until the first meet
ing in April. Adopted.


The Water Committee was discharg-
ed from further consideration of ""
Miller's bill.


The same committees report in re-
iation to laying water mains from the
new reservoir to various parts of the
city, was laid over until next meet
ing.


The Law Committee reported favor
ably on the following Ordinance -
""Authorizing Henry Pretzschner to
erect frame she'd"" 'Authorizing
John Hagan and Hon, Z. w, Gilpin to
erect frame buildings"" ito amend:the
pay roll Ordinance"" !"" regarding the
duties OF the Clerk of Council Adop-
ted
The report of the City Treasurer sta
ted that the sale of bonds during the
past week amounted to 50 500. Total
sold to date, 500, 800
The Auditor reported Il balance in
bank of $50, 2s8 O3.


The Street Commissioner reported
| ""a men and 10 horses and carts en-
ployed in the Street Department. &
The Chief Engineer reported IS men
employed in the Water Department
This report stated that three painters
were employed, and Mr. Febiger asked
what Ii meant.


Mr., Lynch said the Water Depar-
ment office was being renovated, hy
whose authority he knew not.
Mr.. VIM. NJ. Canby said 1t was thu
Chief Engineers duty to keep the Ms
ter office In repair, and as the repairs
were needed, and would not cost $5U,
the Water Committee decided to have
them made.


Mr.. Febiger said 1t was contrary to
all usages OF Council for any coumit-
tee to do such work without first ask.
ing permission. He said II was ssser-
ted by ono of the Water Department
officers that the Office had been occu.
pied by negroes, and was not fit for
occupancy by gentlemen until 1t was
painted and fixed up.


Mr. Candy said the wall paper was
In strips, tho window glass broken and
the paint rubbr,. OF other repairs were
also needed, and he thought that by
the terms OF the Chief Engineer under
the supervision of the Water Commit.
tee was competent 10 have tho repairs
made.


Mr. Fcbi. u said the Office had got
lu such a dilaridated condition since
September last.


Mr.'Canby said that many, repairs
were needed in September last, and
had then been needed for long time.


The Committee onFu reported that
they had purchased and distributed 271
tous of coal among the poor and asked
for an additional appropriation of 81
500, for the purchase of more, as there
were still about 100 applicants.


Mr.. VIM. N. Candy moved to amend
by requiring the Committee to adver'
tisc for proposals for furnishing the re-
quired amount of coal.


Mr.. .Johnsyn oppored the amend
menl, believing it would be false eco
nomy. The coal was mainly furnish
ed to all parts of the city in half and
quarter tons, and if it was procured by
proposals at reduced rates, the coal
dealers wonld be likely to make up
their loss in price by decrease in
weight. The committee had always
endeavored to get coal at the lowest
prices.


After long and acrimonious debate
| In which many political personalities
were indulgcd in, the amendment was
defeated and the report adopted
Mr.. Baker presented petition Tor i
street lamp on Fifth street between
Poplar and Lombard. Referred.

RICHMOND a. DANVILLE IL. II.",,"RICHMOND & DANV1LLE H. rs
| The railroad track between Rich
mond and Greensboro, like that OF the
Air Line south of Charlotte, Is five
feet in width; while the leased con-
Meeting link, ninety-onemiles in length,
| living between Greensboro and Char
lotte, is only four feet eight and half
inches wide. The Danville railroad
people have made persistent efforts to
bring about an uniformity of gauge on
these connecting lines, but have been
foiled by injunctions from the North
Carolina Courts. If would, of course,
be easier to change the gauge OF the
ninety-one miles than of the one hun
dred and ninety that lie between
Greensboro and Richmond. Antagon-
izing interests, however, render the
cheapest course impracticable.


A bill is now under consideration in
the Virginia Legislature, which au-
thorizes the Danville road to alter its
gauge in any way that the company
may deem necessary. The plain mean
ing of the bill is, that the Dapvllle
road proposes to conform in gauge to
the section south of Greensboro, as
the only remedy that the circumstan-
ces of the case admit OF.


The Richmond Chamber of Com
merce has adopted a resolution in favor
of the project, although it is contend
ed by many that the effect of the pro-
posed change of gauge will be
injurious to the trade OF that
| city. The advocates of the change,
on the other hand, allege that
it is necessary to be made II Rlch-
| mond would retain the trade she now
haa. They say that if the Danville
road does not make such connection
with the Carolina roads, Garrett, who
now controls the Lynchburg and Dan
vile road, will do SO, as that road is
of the same gauge -four feet eight and
a half with the Carolina road, and
need only be extended distance OF
four miles to reach the Carolina bor-
der and make the proposed connec-
ton, in which event, all the freight
from the South will be switched OFF at
Danville and be carried to Baltimore,
thus leaving Richmond out in the
cold.


The fight in the Legislature over
the bill will doubtless be long and
hotly contested, but with what result

towns. The committee ON Wednesday re-
ported the following which were adopted


1. That no resident pauper shall be relieved
unless on the written recommendation to
three responsible persons, such recommen-
dation to state the name of the applicant or
applicants, and if any children the number
of such with their age.


2 That all single persons deemed worthy
of aid shall receive the same only by being
sent to the county house, provided that they
cannot be kept at less expense to the COun'
ty in their respective towns.


3. That actual necerries only shall be sup
piled TO INDECENT persons by the overseers of
the poor.


S. That overseers of the poor shall not pre-
sent for payment to the county board any bills
except such as were ordered by them.


8, When medical aid is required for pau
pers, the Ovcrseer OF the poor may provide
such, but shall before employing physician,
stipulate with him as to charges for such visit,
and on presenting his bill he shall state the
nature of the disease and the rate per visit


g. The County Clerk shall procure for the
use of the Supervisors such books and blanks
as may be necessary for the proper fulfill
ment of the law.

In the last days of the Administration OF
Franklin Pierce, there was an Attorney-Gen-
eral in Washington named Caleb Cushing IN
whom the slavohclding party Ind full con-
fidence. IL was not sure that his successor
would be so ready to obey orders from that
ouarter and IT was therefore desirable 10 get
from Mr.. Gushing good strong opinoh
authorizing Southern p0stmasters to exercise
an esDlonage over the mails and to throw Ort
all poitica, matter which did not suit tho
dominant party of That section; such matter
being invariably called ""inGendiary and tend
ling to incite insurrcCtOn."" Mr.. Cushing
justified the confidence rcpOscd in him ana
wrote an elaborate opinion. of which the gis.
is this at seems clear to me that deputy
"" postmaster or other officer OF the United
Estates il not required by law to become know
""ingIy the enforced agent or instrument or
""enemies of the public peace to disseminate IN
""thoir behalf, within the limits of any ono
""of The States of the Union, printed matter
""tho design and tendency of which are to pro-
mote insurrectiOn in such State This oi
course left the Postmaster free to judge wh""'
was the design ard the intention OF every
journal ia The country, and to steal OF destroy
at his own sweet will any papers he liked, Or
disliked


They went on in that course for year or
30 One of them was not satisfied with silently
carrying out Dir. Cushing's suggestions. The
Postmaster of Lynchburg, Va, III iSj9, wrote
a letter to Mr.. Greeley, the Editor OF lie
NEw-YoRK TRIBUNE informing him that ne
would not thereafter deliver that paper to It's
subscribers in Lynchburg, holding 1t danger
Gus 70 the safety of society and subyersive of
the laws of tho land, and directing Mr.. Gree
ley to discontinue sending 1T. 10 that ietter
MIR Greeley replied a. follows:

A gooG many thousand Republicans thought,
in 1872, that if the man who wrote that letter,
and VITO never, in his long and active life,
uttered a word or conceived Il thought incon-
sistcnt with it, should be elected President,
the Union would be betrayed and the princl-
pies of freedom fatally endangered. They
therefore voted for Gen. Grant, and he has
shown them how sagaciOus they were by
nominating as shc supreme eNDOunder OF the
law Of the land the superservceable Attorney
General who gave the Lynchburg Postmaster
and his kind license to rifle the mails in the
interest of Slavery All of which, if it proves
nothing else, proves that human Judgment is
fallibe. even when it receives tae sanction Of
a caucus of Office holders."

of Judge SHayue, of the Supreme
Court He was by the death Of both
fathcr and mother left an orphan IN
his infancy. His parents were poor.


Aliens cister, elder by many years
than he, was married to Pleasant Thur
man, and they were living at Lynch
burg. Va, where their only son, Alien
G. Thurman. was born. They had, ]
think, three daughters, but one Of
whom is living. Pleasant Thurman
had cen originally possessed of means,
but b. becoming surety was rendered
poor. He was not man Of more than
ordinary intellect or energy, but he
was still ""thc noblest work Of God-an
honest man."" This reputation he bore
through life. and has lett behind him
as an Inheritance to his children and a
remembrance to others. He lived and
died a member and exhorter of the
Methodist Church. To Mrs. Thurman
both her brother and son are more i'll
ucbted than to any other person for
their advancement in the world.


When Allen G. Thurman was but
four years old his father and mother
removed from Lyrchburg, Va, to
Chillicothe, Ohio, where they resided
until their death, and where the son
lived until his election to the Supreme
Bench in 1852. William Allen remain
ed at Lynchburg, supporting himself,
working, I believe, as sadler's appren-
tioe, until he was about sixteen years
of age. He then collected together his
worldly goods, tied them in handker-
chief, and set out on foot to seek the
home of his sister in Ohio.


After taking up his residence in
Chillieothe, at which place he has ever
since resided, young Allen was by his
sister placed in the old Chillicothe
Acade any, where he received his only
real instruction from a teacher.


Aliens sister, Mrs. Thurman, selec-
ted and supervised his general It aiding.
In this he considers that he derived
the greatest advantage.


Shortly after his election to the Sen
ate Mr.. Allen married Mrs. Effie Coons,
formerly Macarthur, the beautiful and
accomplished daughter of Gen. Duncan
McArthur-his early, true, and only
love. She chose Allen from among a
host of distinguished suitors from sew
eral States. She inherited the old
homestead and farm, where Allen, hay
ing added many acres to the latter,
still. with his daughter, Mrs Scott, her
husband, and their children and his
grand children, resides. Tt is well
known that prior to her first marriage
she and MI. Allen were devoted to
each other and while her father, Gov
ernor Macarthur, was not personally
unfriendly to Mr.. Allen, yet their op-
position in politics and strong positive
qualities caused him to think that their
connection would cause them to antag-
onize, and ultimately to produce dis
eord between them, and he therefore
disapproved of their union.


He ever maintained fearless and un-
tiinehing integrity, and the voice of
calumny itself never accused him of
RIGHTEOUSNESS. mall these respects his
life has been as pure as that of John G..
Calhoun-far above the reputation of
Clay or Webster, or even of Washing
ton himself. Mrs. Allen died shortly
after the birth of their daughter and
only child, Mrs. Scott. In health and
in sickness Mr.. Allen WAS a most deyo-
ted and affectionate husband and
when she died he rode oa horseback
with the corpse from Washington City
to ChillicOthe. He has never thought
of marrying since, and it is almost
certain that if he had not married her.
his only love, he mover would have
married at all.


Aliens vocal organization is a mar
vel. His ability to make himself heard
when with General Cass at Buffalo, in
lS4S, inspite of two steamboats, attempt
ing to prevent his being heard, is
true."

ward, of which there has been $4,000
offered for the three, besides various
other rewards having been offered by
the Governors of Missouri and Arkan-
sas.


Reeds body had become very much
decomposed, particularly about the
| head, he having been shot just between
the nose and right eye. The drayman,
in carrying HIM to the potter's field,
mlstook the place, and in returning,
with the breeze to the windward of the
corpse, he took sick, and was compelled
to abandon it on the roadside. 1t was,
however, taken charge of by the sheriff
and finally inferred. 1t is hoped that
the others may be taken and dealt with
in like manner.


The alleged virtues of madstones
are discredited by scientific men. The
only efficacy they can have is that of
being imperfect cupping glasses, they
being generally porus coralits which
will adhere to raw wound. Still, the
Lynchburg (Va.) Republican tells a
story which is important, if true. A
Virginian whose name it gives, was
lately bitten by moccasin snake, and
before he could get any means of help
his bitten leg was very badly swollen
and his suffer,ngs were great, if not
threatening to be fatal. A maidstone
was applied to the wound, and seemed
to suck the poison from it; the leg
soon resumed it's natural size, and the
uncomfortable symptoms disappeared.
It is curious that the belief in mad
stones exists in the East Indies as we'll
as in this country, and many marvellous
tales are told of their origin."

ELLINaswoRTH PREPARING TO RETURN The
| flight of VIM. t. Ellingsworth from this city a
week or two ago, and his pursuit almost to st.
Georges. will be remembered by the readers of
the COMMERCIAL, the particulars having been full
| ly published in it at the time. Mr.. Ellingsworth
made his way into Sussex, his former place OF
| residence, where he employed COUNSEL to whom
he related the whole transaction. Mr. 7. Y. de-
Normandie, one of the victims of the supposed
| forgery, was sent for, who confronted Ellings-
worth, when the latter convinced him that he
| had not committed the forgery as alleged and
can 80 prove. He ran away. he said, to avoid
| being thrust into jail. So plausible s Mr.. ELL
ingswerths statement, and 10 implicitly il it be-
| lieved, that arrangements are being made by
which he will be permitted to return TO the city
unmolested, it is thought, and resume business


CARRIED HOME ON SErTEE Last evening,
a party of four or five young men who had i'm
bibed rather too freely betook themselves to the
| depot to have some fun. They first fell in with
a party of corn cutters from Darby, two of whom
| they assaulted and bruised about the face, but
escaped without injury although the injured men
had their knives with them. Shortly afterwards
| they came i'll collision with a carter for one Of
the coal yards named Murphy, who almost
| knocked the breath out of one of them by a
stone which he hurled against his breast, and


another one was struck in the face by still
larger stone, which proAtrated him and wounded
him 30 badly that lie had to be carried homo on
| a settee This seemed to sober up the crowd,


and no further dist urbance occurred
The KNOWLES FAILURE AT NEW CAsTLE.-The

pect of resuming work at the mills, it being un-
derstood that Mr.. Knowles has effected some ar
| rangements with his creditors which will allow


him to continue the business, and in short

been thrown out of work will be employed.

and had the reputation OF being knd.hearted

the city police, was the resort Of those who ses
the law at defiance, for they knew that something
more than an ordinary carousal would call for the

Mr. Febger said he offered the amendment for
the reason that we would not need the s4U,OoO
this fall, before frost, when work must cease,
and further because the city would have to pay
; interest ON money lying idle.
MIR. Hayes read the ordinance requiring all
work over $50 to be given out by contract, and
contended that the resolution was contrary TO
the ordinance.


Mr.. Baker said the committee wanted the
work done by contract, but wished to separate
u | the different kinds of work into separate con-
u tracts. The proposals asked for were for horses
and carts by the day, and the proposals are to
be in the hands OF the committee: MIR. H. gave

letter to n. Y. Herald, Oct. o6th.]


MINGAur VALLEY. New York.",,"On Saturday last an itinerant pcddler
entered the house Of James Tolin, liv-
ing near this pace, and proceeded to
display his wares to Mrs. Tolin, de-
spite hcr,assertions that she did not wish
to buy anything. Mr.. Tolin was con-
fined to his bed and had been so con-
fined for many years, being so crippled
with rheumatism that it had been long
impossible for him to leave his bed un-
less carried from it. After showing his
goods, and Mrs. ToliG not buying any
thing, the peddler commenced CONVEX
sation, in the course of which he learned
the helpless condition Of Mr.. Tolin. FL
nally he made an insulting proposal to
Mrs. Tolin, and she Indignantly or
dered him to leave the house.
Instead he approached her and
seized hold Of her, saying, with
an oath, that she was in his power, as
her husband was as good as dead. Mrs.
Tolin, being delicate woman, ran
screaming into another room. The
pecdlec followed her, and, before she
could escape by the door, caught her
again. A desperate struggle ensued
between them, and Mrs. Tolin was
thrown violently to the floor by the
powerful villain. MIR. Tolin had been
all the time witness of the struggle,
lying powerless in his bed. At the
sound of his wife fal' ing on the floor,
however, and her frantic shrieks for
aid, he seemed to be endowed with


SUPERNATURAL POWER.


Under the influence of that power he
sprang from the bed he had been I'm.
able to leave for years. Seizing heavy
crutch that stood near the bed, he
! rushed into the room where the strug.
gle was going or. Mrs. Tolin had sue.
ceeded in regaining her feet, but the
peddler had grasped her around the
waist, and was endeavoring again to
throw her. As Mr.. Tolin entered the
room, the singular spectacle Of bed
ridden cripple hastenening to the de.
fense of his wife seemed to paralyze
the scoundrel, and he stood
staring as if in a
trance at the approach of the husband.
Mr.. Tolin, nervod by unnatural
strength, brought the crutch down
over the head Of the peddler, and felled
him like an on to the floor. The next
instant the excitement and superhuman
effort that had supported the husband
left him. With q shrek, that told of
the intense agony of the relapse, he
clasped his hands to his foerhead and
dropped to the floor and almost


INSTANTLY EXPIRED.


Mrs. Tolin succeeded in getting the
body Of her husband back in the bed
and the started for assistance. She
was obliged to go over a mile before
she was able to obtain any. When
she returned with several neighbors
the peddler was gone. He had recov-
cred consciousness and fed, leaving his
pack in the house. When the news of
the attempted outrage and the tragic
death of Mr.. Toiin spread throughout
the neighborhood, the most intense ex.
citement prevailed. Squads of men
started in every direction, searching
for the peddler, but as yet he has not
been found. In the present feeling, if
he falls into the hands Of the populace,
that he will be lynched there is not the
slightest doubt."

the Catholic Church can point to its marvel
lous increase in population and churches,
schools and religious institutions. Though


there is less said about it than in most other
countries, Ireland can point to some extraor-
dinary revivals of the power of the Church


within the past fifty years. Such facts as those
told in letter to the Belfast Examiner by q


Ballymena correspondent, are almost won


derful as anything we can point to in America.


We quote: The Most Rev. DIR. Dorian, Lord


Bishop of Down and Connor, attended by forty
FIVE priests of this district, held conference
at the Catholic Church to-day. 1t is worthy


of notice that about seventy years ago there
was only one priest in all North Antrim; now
there are about forty. Forty years ago the
Rev. Mr. Lynch, p. p, was one of the three
priests who attended to the spiritual wants of
Belfast, Ballyclare, Carrickfergus, Hollywood,
etc. At present there are more than thirty
priests in Belfast alone Fifty years ago there
were only seven there was no Catholic chnrch


or Catholic school. Churches schools and paro-
chial houses, that would do honor to any dio- 1
cese, have of late risen as it were by magic
through the county. What a contrast between
these fine churches and the Protestant and
Presbyterian houses of worship. In the Catho-
lie churches, music, painting, sculpture and
architecture made to contribute to the
beanty of Gods house and the enlightenment
of his people, while in other places of worship
the mind finds nothing but rGcuun, Really

An extra OF q Lexington. No., paper, received
late last night, gives a long rambling and ambgu-
Gus account OF the murder Of i. H. Johnson and
wife, at North Lexington Sunday night brief
mention OF which has been already telegrapned.
1t appears that Johnson had not lived happily with
his wife. Some months ago he left for Kentucky,
but returned suddenly on Sunday evening, accom-
panied by Lorenzo johnson, a cousin--one riding
""a line horse and the other mue-and stopped at
the mouse OF Mrs. Lindsey, the mother
or Jonnson's wie. In tue night, about
two O'Clock A. NJ, pistol shots were heard
IN the room occupied by Johnson and his wile,
anu Wnen the family entered the room johnson
was found with bullet hole in his head and the
skull broken, and his wife's head mad been mashed
toa Jely with an axe. A letter was round on the
table addressed TO Lorenzo johnson, and signed
by u. ii. Johnson, in which he says be committed
the deed and had determined to do IL before leav-
ING Lexington on account OF his wife's inddelity.
The statement In the letter s not believed. how
ever ior the reason that Johnson could not write,
and 1t is suspected that Lorenzo is the murderer,
though there Is no positive evidence against him.
About ten O'Clock Monday morning the train
from the west came down, and lust as Lorenzo
was getting aboard he was arrested for horse
stealing. The horse and mule ridden hy him and
bis cousin proved TO have been stolen from O,Fal-
ton Of the thieves. Lorenzo was taken 10 Rich
mona and az last accounts fears were entertained
that he would be lynched.


The verdict OF the Coroner's Jury in the case of
Mr.. ard Mrs. Johnson was that they were Killed

formed, but Lorenzo Johnson was not charged

VACATED.


The Board OF Public Education met, last even
ing, in regular session, President Shortlidge in
the chair.


Mr.. Mclntire, from the committee OH Finance,
simply reported progress i'll the settlement of the
accounts of late Treasurer killgore, Supernten-
dent Harlan being absent from the city. He
also reported balance in the Treasury of S12,-
299.6S, with note of 81, 500 to falli due on the
Goth instant. There is $4,000 in the hands of
the City Treasurer subject TO the order of the
Board, and the last of the bonds for school pur-
poses, amounting to 81, 900 have been sold On
his motion the proper officers were instructed TO
draw upon the City Treasurer for $4,000 He
stated that the 81, 900 realized from the sale of
bonds would be paid by check from the City
Council, without an order from the Board. The
amount of available funds in the Treasury would
then be 529, ,299.63.


Mr.. Lynch reported that the committee of No.
IL (new SCHOOL, had employed Ellen Simpson as
1anltor OF the school at an annual salary of $780,
and moved the adoption of the report.
DIR. Grimshaw inquired by what authority the
committee made the appointment, as no COM
mittee has yet been appointed for the new school.
He moved TO postpone the action on the report
until the next meeting.


Mr.. Lynch supposed that as the pupils were to
be transferred to the new school, the committee
would be transferred with them.


The motion TO postpone being lost, Mr.. Lynch's
motion to adopt the report was agreed to.


DIR. Grlmshaw then raised the point that as
the committee was to be transferred with the
school, the janitor should also be transferred,
which point appearing to have considerable force
Mr.. Baird moved reconsideration of the
adoption OF the report, which was carried
and the subject then postponed until the next
meeting.


After considerable debate, owing to the neg
! lect Of the Superintendent to make out a pay
roll for the officers OF the Board and the iauitorp
Of the schools, it was agreed to draw orders for
the said officers andijanitors for the month Of Ju-
"", being guided by the June pay roll in doing
so. This was in accordance with letter from
Mr.. Harlan recommending such action.
Mr. Morrow, from the Committee ON Medals.
reported that the medals would be ready for de-
livery before the next meeting OF the Board,
when on his motion an order for s479.50 was
drawn to pay for the medals and the cost of en-
craving.


On motion OF Mr.. Roberta, tile committee of
No. school was instructed to have the cutters
in the yard repaired.


The resignation of Maggie w. Stewart as LIST
assistant Of No. school. End grade was accept
ed and referred 70 the Committee on Teachers.


On motion OF DR.. Grimshaw. the Committee
en- Teachers was discharged from the considera-
ton Of his resolution offered at the last
meeting. to Vacate No. y school at 10th and
King streets.


Dr. Grimshsw then called up his resolution
and stated that the school was small one, vir.
tnally isolated from all the other schools, un.
graded and uncassihed and with other new
school houses being built all around it, there
was no necessity for its continuance.


The resolution to vacate was adopted. and the

 Restoring the Waste P1aoes.-D. J.. Warner, Esq, is employing workmen to re store the earth washed away from the lot in the rear of his house. The lot begins to look as of old.

 Patrick Lynch and assistants are busily engaged in making new bed for the water course back of his house. The soil re moved IS being carted on to his own premi - ses, thus covering up the stone and gravel in the rear of his house. Pat believes in making things look bright and fresh.

 By this change the creek will run several feet farther back than it did originally; and will be much straighter.

 The Syracuse Disaster.-On the night of the 23rd ult, while church festival was being held in the Central Baptist church of Syracuse, N. Y., at which about five hundred persons were present, the church parlor floor, forty feet square gave way, precipitating the throng fifteen feet amid broken beams and blanks, clouds of suffocating plaster and shattered furniture. Thirteen persons were killed outright and others will die. The number of wounded foots up to 133. The building, as usual in such cases, was lmperfectly constructed. The pastor, Rev. Geo. T. Bowling, and wife, went down with the rest, but they miraculously escaped with scarcely any bodily injury.

 A Model Fire Departmental would have afforded us much pleasure to have witnessed the Twenty First Annual Parade of the Norwich. N. Y., Fire Department, which came off with so much eclat, on Tuesday, June 23rd. The Chief Engineer, Rev. s. Scoville, formerly of Cornwall, ex- erts good influence among the members of the department, not only by his exam pie as a Christian minister, but by his mark ed executive ability. In his address to the members previous to the parade he gives tUo ao0rds of caution ""One against drink ing intoxicating liquors-In view of all that has been done expect that no mem Der will bring reproach upon the depart ment by this indulgence""

 ''The other is against profanity-lt is an unmanly vice and entirely unworthy fire man. Let us have no more of it from any member while in the service.""

 Noble sentiments these! Would that all similar and other organizations would em- brace the views of the Rev. Chief Engineer.

 Claverack College.-The commence ment exercises of this institution, under the presidence of Rev. A. Flack has just closed. It was my privilege to be present as a mem- Der of the visiting committed. The build ings of the institution are beautifully locat- ed in Claverack, Columbia county, about three miles from the city of Hudson; the presidents mansion is really a princely af fair. The examinations showed thorough ness on the part of the teachers and appli- cation on the part of the student. The class in moral philosophy attracted special attention. The military drill, reunion of the alumni, and public concert were deeply interesting. The students are taught self reliance, and that mental and moral cul- ture, combined in due proportions, are in dispensible as elements of a thorough edu- cation and well balanced character. The current of educational influence pouring out from this living fountain so pure and deep and wide, known not by rolling boul ders and noisy water falls, but by the belt of beauty, greenness and yerdure that may be seen along it's banks. Such school is great blessing, and such teacher public benefactor. W. 0. g.

 P. & E. R. R. and Hudson River Bridge We regret to learn that the Poughkeersie 6 Eastern railroad has been put in the hands of a receiver for the benefit of its creditors, &c- Its financial condition must be in a bad state. A New York paper states that the city of. Po'keepsie will lose $6OO,OOO, and that individuals must also lose large sums. The road is at present running under the charge of the receiver, ex-Judge Carpenter, and of course can have no immediate injurious effect upon the business of our Conn. Western road, with which it connects at the state line on the western border of this town. But we feal that in connection with the present condi- tion of financial affairs generally, it will tend to prolong the completion of the Hud son river bridge at Poughkeepsie, and that it will be long time before coal will be and elsewhere, direct by rail from Pennsyl vania mines without the expense, loss and delay of breaking bulk as it is termed, as was contemplated by the sproiectors of the bridge, and the construction of the Pough keepsie 6 Western railroad from the west ern terminus of the bridge to the Walkil valley, which extends by connections tc the coal mines, and in our view the only salvation for the road consists in the early completion of the bridge but this would call for an expenditure of money to bs counted by millions, and at the presen time the outlook is certainly dark one.

est, when OH motion of Mr.. Febiger the commit
tee was instructed to enter into a contract with

ed that owing TO the absence OF the City Solicl-
tor from the city, none of the pending ordi-
nances had been acted upon, in consequence of
| which the committee asked to be continued.

adopted he would give notice that he would call
up for final action the ordinance exempung the
excavation for the new basin from the proyi-
! sions of the contract ordinance.

Mr. Candy wanted to know if council had the
power to amend the report of a committe.


The chair stated that it had, but to refer back

and moved its reference back to the committee
with instructions TO report forthwith.


Mr.. McIutire contended that Council could
moi interfere with tine report of committee,
and that 1t was violation OF the ordinance re-
quiring all ordinances and resolutions to be re-
ferred to the Committee on Law He for one
would not sign another report. He called the
yeas and nays OH the motion to refer.


Mr.. Hayes contended that all such papers must
take their regular course and be approved or
disapproved by the City Solicitor, and reported
back by the committee, exactly as the committee
had done.


air Pickles said that did not amount to any
thing. The City Solicitor simply gave his opin-
ion as to whether the ordinance was correct or
not. Time rapidly rolling on and Council
could not well wait another week.
Mr.. Baker said Council made its own laws, and
it WIS fully competent to repeal the ordinance

for the work of excavation now in pro.
gress for the stone building about being
erected by Mr.. John Wann, on the cor
ner of Sibley and Fourth streets, and
Patrick O'Connor is his foreman.
There were three brothers named Rose
employed on the work, one Of whom,
John H. Rose, was discharged on Mon.
day morning for incompetency. This
evidently excited Rose, who went away
and, as it appeared, INDUCED frequently
in liquor, and was heard making threats
Of revenge against O'Connor. He re-
turned to the work in the course of the
forenoon, and Immediately proceeded to
abuse O'Connor and make threats
sgainst him. Mr.. Elliott interfered,
got between the parties and tried to get
Rose away. but the latter, pushing Mr..
Elliott aside, rushed at O'Connor, who
was standing on the edge Of the pit
where the excavation was in progress,
and who had no resource but to strike
Rose with q club wich he had in his
hand or be knocked into the pit. Rose
fell, having received a slig ght scalp
wound, but was up again almost imme-
d ately.


Rose Immediately left. and proceed
ing to the Police Court procured war
rant for O'Conner's arrest and the case
coming up for hearing the defendant
was discharged.


Roses two brothers and himself were
examined on the trial and two of them
gave their evidence in a very excited
manner, Henry appearing to be the
coolest of the trio. On leaving the
court room they made several threats
against O'Connor, Elliot and the City
Justice, and, as will be seen by the
sequel, with a full determination to
carry them out.


About half past 4 on the evening of
the 10th Rose was seen approaching
the spot where O. 'Connors was standing
with deuble-barreled shot gun in his
hand. Rose walked up the south side
of Fourth street, near to Sibley.


O'Connor was at work patching up
temporary fence about the excava.
tion on the corner opposite the Sher.
man House. When within twenty or
thirty feet of his victim Rose, leveled
his gun and exclaiming, ""Now, you
s. Of B.. -, I'll be even with
you,'' fired directly at O'Connors' head.
Some ono had shouted to O'Connors
relative to his danger and looking up
he had only time to hold up two pieces
of light boards nailed together, (which he
had in his hand. before his face, when
the shot, passing through the boards.
struck him upon his forehead and
and face. That he did not fall dead in
his tracks was owing to the board
warding off the force of the charge.
FLIGHT OF THE MURDERER.
Rose, still carrying his gun, started
on run down Fourth street, pursued
by large and excited crowd. Two or
three hackmen started in pursuit with
their teams. A policeman sprang into
one of the hacks and joined in the
chase. Rose turned from Fourth
street into Rosabel, from Rosabel ran
up Seventh, and was taken into custody
by officer Pulitzer, on the corner of
Seventh and Jackson. The crowd was
greatly excited, and cries of !"" Lynch

Ing, having left Homburg Immediately on receipt
of the despatch about the attempted assassination
OF Prince Bismarck Though The eventtook place
at one O'Clock Of the afternoon of the 18th. the
telegrapnlc despatch was not published in Hon.
burg until iate in the evening, and in Frankfort
not until ten or eleven O'Clock on the morning OF
the l4th. such Is newspaper energy in Germany.
Well arrive in this idyllic watering place find
the excitement Of thlrty-siX hours ago somewhat
subsidized but the attempted assassination the sub
lect OF general conversation. | am informed by
Bisnarck's physician that the Princes wound
Is not at all serious and is doing well, but that
the patient suffers from considerable nervous
prostration consequent on the recent excitement.
The would-be assassin, Franz Edward Ludwig
Kullmann, is In prison. A priest, who
was supposed to have had some con.
nection with the criminal, was arrested
at the neighboring city OF Schweinfurth yesterday
afternoon, and Is at present in this city, Public
opinion here is tbat he i'd guilty OF completely IN the
attempted murder, while there others who be-
ueve that he was only accidentally present when
the shot was fired. But permit me first TO tell the
story of the attempted assassination in proper
form. Short accounts have been published in q To-
cal newspaper, but nothing very full. The best
and most trustworthy account, however, has been
told me this morning by NJ. Jose Lederer opera
singer from the Court Theatre at Darmstadt, who
saw the whole occurrence and succeeded in captur-
ing the would-be assassin, thereby receiving Sc
we're wound himself upon the hand.


THE NARRATIVE OF AN EYEWITNESS


found NJ. Lederer, a handsome, aYable gentle.
man, pacing up and down his room, with one arm
In Sing. He told me that. although he had a
German name, he was native of Hungary. The
following is his account as taken down and trans
lated by me at the time -


M. LEDERER-It was quarter past one on the
afternoon of the 18th when l crossed the promen-
ade bridge towards Count BismarcK's house, with
the intention OF seeing the Chancellor ride out.
stood near crowd OF persons mostly ladies' who
had gathered near the mouse, and saw the Prince
leave his house and take seat in his carriage.
The people cheered heartily, and while the Prince
was beckonlng TO them with his uprased hand,
thanking them for the welcome at the same time,
If requesting them not to cheer him any more,
heard the report OF a pistol, saw Prince Bismarck
fall back in his carriage II startled, and, in the
same moment, young man break through the
crowd and attempt to make his escape. Know
ing that he must have fred the shot lmme-
diately ran after him and succeeded in collar
ing him by the neck He resisted energetically,
selzing savagely at my throat and grasp
ing my right hand. During the struggle he
pulled my right thumb out of joint. In the excite
ment attempted to grasp him by the throat, but
reached too high. and he succeeded in getting my
right thumb between his teeth and bit it clear
through to the bone. Alter wrestling with the
man, who was thickset and powerful, for about a
minute and q half the Inspector OF Police, M.
Weber. came TO my assistance. Together took
the woud-be assassin TO prison. but with no little
difficulty, rs the crowd had by this time grown
violently excited and stopped US at every moment,
crying that the wretch should be lynched. We

reived blows anmadvertly given in the confusion.
la fact my own person being covered with blood
and my dress disarranged, think the crowd mis-
took me occasionally for the criminal. We de-
vered him up to the prison authorities, and then
went to my rooms


PRINCE BISMARCK AND NJ LEDERER.


While soothing my wounded hand with cooling
applications Prince Bismarck visited me, bringing
with him his physician in order TO ascertain the
nature OF my wound. Though wounded himself,
he greeted me in very cheerlul manner and
asked me my name and wnere was from. told
hlm was Hungarian. ""a am glad 10 know you,""
DC said, ""and to be able to thank you personally
for your assistance"" After looking at my wounds
he took me IN his carriage to MS house and pre-
sented me TO MS family, the Princess, his wife,
Countess Bismarck ana Count Herbert his son.
was received with the greatest amiabIlity and re-
manned there some time. This Is all the story. In
the evening deputation Of the guests came to me
TO thank me for the modest part had taken in
the affair, at the same time requesting me to
accept the position speaker IN the evening,
since u was, INTENDED to bring the Prince a
serenade and torchght procession and to con-
gratulate MIN on his miraculous escape


CoRREsPoNDENT-Wa the shot wen aimed, do
you think, NJ Lederer?


N. LeDERER-Yes: the ban entered the neshy
part OF the thumb, ana sped along near the sur.
face Tor a lew inches and then making its exit. It
was what Is called In German Sti'eifsc1uss. But
it IS my conviction that had not the Prince JUST
neld up his nand to wave the people to be quiet,
the bullet would have struck him full in the face
BY the motion of his hand the direction OF the ball
was changed and the Chancellors lie preserved.


KIssINGEN UNDER EXCITEMENT.


The excitement that prevailed in Kissingen all
the afternoon was something extraordinary.
Hundreds OF guests assembled before the Cnancel.
lor's house, and the Joy ana thankiuness of the
entire people were unleigned and heartfelt. Cath
olics and Protestants were alike filed
with feelings OF thankiulness at the
wonderful preservation. AT seven in the evening
divine service was held In the Evangelical church
TO give thanks TO God for the preservation OF the
Prince. Shortly afterwards the torchhght process
sion was formed emDodying certainly 1000 guests
and nearly an the natives Afler the serenade
Prince Bismarck appeared on the balcony, and,
holding up his wounded hand, exclaimed ""Es hat

At No. 352 Fifth street, Jersey ct.y lived Mr..
William Livingstone for a long time past. He was
mason and bricklayer. and moved mostly In that
circle Of mechanics who either through lucky
stroke OF fortune or through stern perseverance
make their mark In the world. He worked chiefly
for his brother-In-law, Mr.. Whyte, who has long
been prominent contractor and builder, Lty-
ingstone was OF medium height, good looking.

words OF a well known cltiZen, ""He would be


THE LAST MAN
in the city to provoke quarrel"" THIS would
seem to be the strongest reason why gang OF
roughs would make HIM their sport and their
target


During Saturday evening Livingstone and
companion named James Bennett were


QUIETLY ENJOYING THEMSELVES
over game OF CARDS. IN respectable liquor store
on Grove street. When the night waxed late and
the store to be closed, the two started out on
their way home. Seeing McFeeley's oyster saloon.

Within the saloon was company OF young men
who were acting in bOsterous manner. some OF
them being too plainly under the influence OF
liquor. This company included Phil Reilly,


NOTORIOUS PRIZE FIGHTER,
James Hunt and three or four others. When men
or this stamp are bent on mischief 1t Is only q

moved to the door, ana the gang moved too.
q long stride he passed beyond the doorstep to
the sidewalk, and that stride was


THE STEP INTO ETERNITY.


With terrific rush Reilly was at his side, ana,
swinging his arm to give force to the attack, he
dealt the unfortunate Livingstone tremendous
blow on The left side OF the face that


""FELLED HIM LIKE AN OK""
as bystander remarked his head striking the
curb with such violence that he never afterwards
moved nor spoke word. Whether any OF the
gang kicked him while prostrate IS not yet made
clear but the back OF his head was fearfully bat
.ered. The murderous brute ran around the cor
ner, followed DJ HUNT, and they are


STILL AT LARGE.


Off1cers, Lee, DOYLE and Nicholas were soon on
hand. They raised the prostrare form, but the
last breath had gone forth. Gllligan and Bennett
were held as witnesses but they were discharged

Horrible Fate of a Detective Too


Bold and Jealous.",,"""Dead men tell no tales' Is the idea acted upon
by the lawless bands In Tennessee designated Ku
Klux, ana woe unto the informer that betrays
them Detectives that hunt them down have to
summon all their sagacity to keep out OF their
clutches, and avoid the fate that overlook the
rl-starred BarmOre In 1858. The whole country at
the time was shocked, even in those days Of
bloodsned, at the secret but death. dealing blow
that struck him TO the ground At that time the
lawless organizations had grown to such magni.
tude that reward OF $500 was offered for every
one that was apprehended. Tempted by the re.
ward Barmore undertook to discover who and
what they we're. He visited different points looked
around, picked up wnat Information he could
and started In pursuit OF the Ku Klux. He was
an individual whose own peculiar character
istics would have made him remarkable in any
| community. He called himself the ""Great western
Detective"" OF Chicago, and was successful in
hunting down great many criminals He was
fond OF show and was very foppish in his dress.
His ordinary costume consisted OF q black velvet
suit, with broad and conspicuous trimmings coat
cut claw-hammer style. He wore heavy watch
and chain, carried large gold headed cane,
adorned his fingers with heavy seal rings, and.
most conspicuous Of all. wore large cross pin in
| his necktie OF Alaska diamonds.


BARMoREs FATE


He circulated around in Middle Tennessee, and
mask and black gown being found in his trunk
after his death 1t was supposed that he had joined
the band in order 10 more fully discover their
plans and identify them for arrest He was the
only man that had ever succeeded In
ascertaning the names of those in any
OF the organizations. He had ferreted
out many Of them, and was only biding his time
to deliver them over to the authorities. Thus
driven to the wall, as 1t were, the ku Kux had no
alternative short Of actual assassination of the
man who thus held their lives in his hands. They
summoned councils and devised means TO make
away with him IN a manner so as not to be dis.
covered. plan matured, they sent decoy des-
patch to their victim, which stated that the trial
OF negro, whom he had arrested at Pulaski was
TO be neld next DAY at that place. He took the
evening train In order to be in Pulaski by the next
morning. When the train arrived at Columbia
several men, heavily disguised, boarded 1t.
| The night was very dark and the men had been
before unobserved. They entered the car and be-
| gan looking around for the detective. AS he saw
them he instinctvey felt that he the object Of
their search, and crouched down as much as DOS
slble without attracting observation between the
seats. But it was all to no purpose, the unmstaka-
BILE garb would have betrayed him anywhere. The
men seized him and hurried him out Of the Car.
After this tidings could be heard OF the missing
Barmore for several weeks. when his body was
| found IN the bed of Duck River, SO disfgured BY
decomposition that q hare lip was the only means
by which he was identified. In the same manner
the Ku Klux will execute one Of their own number
should he betray them.


! ORIGIN OF THE KU KLUx.


The first band Of Ku Klux was formed in Pulaski
Giles county, and was organized in opposition to
the Loyal League, q secret society, composed of
| carpet baggers, scalawags and negroes. At first
they meant only to ward OF the depredations
hwt latV
defensive in protecting themselves and their
families. At this time tue band was composed, it
was thought, OF the best citizens of the STATE but
as time passed on the better class Of members
dropped out OF 1t, and 1t soon ceased to be a

OF the first obligations OF these bands is be true

other Is their only safeguard.

was boast that no ku Klux should drive him

This was repeated around, and q party Of men
wearing masks undertook to punish him for the
remark. They appeared at the door OF his cabin,

The Council met at the regular hour,

The Special Committee, on the petit
ton for modification of the Ordi- |
nance relating to the cleaning of cess |
pools, reported that there was no Ordi- |
nance requiring privies to be cleansed
by machinery, and recommended that |
the Board of Health be requsted to |
grant licenses to night scavagers, as |
well as to the Odorless Excavating
Company.
Mr.. Baker asked if any of the night
|scavengers had been stopped from
performing their usual avocation.


Mr.. Mc1ntlre replied that none had
been licensed save a monopoly COM
posed partly of city officers and that
the Mayor had been requested to pro-
secure the old scayengers for perform
ing their duties.


Mr.. Baker insisted that the Mayor
had failed to perform his duties in not
prosecuting the old scavengers, as they
violated the law


Mr.. Hayes said that the Mayor had
enforced the law, in every case brought
to his notice. But hepeople had bee n
asking for redress at the hands of
Council, and this body should relieve
them of the monopoly.
Mr.. William M. Candy thought the
old scavengers had no right to perform
their usual avocation, but such an in
fluential set of citizens as those who
signed the petition should have re-
dress when they asked it.


Mr.. Baker held that Council had no
Jurisdiction in the matter, the subject
properly resting with the Board OF
Health.


Mr.. William Candy thought that the
Odorless should be brought into fair
Icompetition with the old system, and
not made Il monopoly.


Mr.. Baker moved to lay the matter

Occasional Correspondence OF the sentinell


BLooMINGToN, IND, Nov. 2-Since the
killing of David Jacobs, your correspondent
has awaited the result of the investigation
of the affair by the grand jnEv, which has
been in session the last two weeks under
the especial orders OF the court, in order to
give your readers the facts. in what, per-
haps, is the most my sterious case of lynch
ing ever recorded within the bounds of the
state. Without casting any reflections up-
on past grand iurics of this county, it may
he said, with truth, that the one jusS ad-
Journed, was the most practical and
efficient of any which has found ""irue
bill, within this baihwick for years. The
very fact the VI. l.. 0IcCulloush their
foreman, is sufficient guarantythat no stone
was left uDturned in order { ferret out this
whole transaction, And vet with one
weeks arduous labor, and the examination
of one hundred witnesses, nothing could be
learned which would justify an Indictment.
OF one thing the Jury is satisfied;and that is
that none of Jacobs neighbors had a hand
in the killing, although one or nore of
them might have been cognizant of, and
helped mature the plot. Numbers of good
reliable men, living on the road leading
from Bloomington to David Jacobs, testi-
fed to having seen different bodies OF
mounted men on that road, and in fields
and roads adjacent, on that evening who
were utter strangers and un-
known in the country. William

ner of this county. on the road leading from
here to Brownstown in jackson county,

O'Clock, which, he judged, two abreast,

Several places in the immediate vicinity ei
the killing bore evidence of having been
trampled by numerous horses, and all the
facts and runsors go to prove that the killing
was done by parties not residents of thu.
county. Who they were Will probably
never be found out, but the next grand
jury will take up the case where this
one left of, and as it will be enabled to Sc
cure the attendance of some witnesses
whose presence could not be had by the last
jurv, some light may yet be shpown upon
this dark and bloody deed. Bat come of il

In the Sunday issue of the Sentinel, Oct. 25,
in speaking OF the Jacobs lynching, edito-
rally, some errors occurred which, perhaps
it would be well to correct. In the artIclE
referred to it is stated that ""the man Jacobs
was, by a strategem, separated from two
companions while riding home at dusk. ?
This is mistake. Philip Bond and Wm
Hays, his companions, were his friends, an6
used no strategy to separate themselves
| from him, but they simply rode on, while
David Jacobs stopped to talk with hi:

the lane, and met Jacobs and killed him

were being guarded, saying: ""Go back

At the meeting OF City Council, last evening,
Mr.. Pickels, from the City Hospital Committee
presented the following report of the investiga-
ton of the charges preferred against Hospital
Superintendent Stewart at the last meeting:


WILMINGTON, Aug. 4, 1874.
To u,e ity Council of Wilmington


Your committee, to whom was referred the
charge made against John M. Stewart Superin-
tendent Of the City Hospital, of conduct unbe-
coming gentleman, beg leave to report that
after careful investigation, they find that while
Mr.. Stewart was mprudent in his actions, yet the
evidence fails to sustain the charge made against
him,


II. +. PIoKELs,


THos. JOHNSON,


JOHN L. RICHARDSON,


ISAAC MURRAY.


Mr.. Pickels moved the adoption of the report,
when Councilman Lynch, the only member OF
the committee who did not sign the report, dis
claimed any malicious intention against Mr.
Stewart, in offering the resolution, he being a
gentleman whom he knew only by reputation.
He referred to the letter of DIR. Reynolds, an
inmate of the Hospital, an invalid wheeled about
in an arm chair, who wrote the letter to mem
ber Of the committee, giving information of the
conduct which led to the charges, yet
his intellect was not impaired, and
being an Intelligent educated gentleman his in
formation and evidence were given in such a
straightforward and intelligent manner az to
leave no doubt of the grossest immortality being
practised DR.. Reynolds, too, had the dsadvan-
tage of testifying in the presence of the Super
intendent, and of afterwards being subject to
his displeasure. His name Gynch's) was not
appended to the report for he could not sign
conscientiously without certifying to his disbe-
lief of the testimony of DR.. Reynolds. whom he
believed to be high minded, intelligent honor
able man, having forgotten more than the
whole of the committee, including himself, ever
knew.


Mr.. Pickels defended the report, and in reply
to Mr.. Lynch, said that the committee was not
of the star chamber ORDER where the accused
was prohibited from being present. He did not
defend Mr.. Stewart in all his actions, but the
testimony showed that all the witnesses knew Of
occurred in the presence of his wife and other
members of his family. In order to give the
City Council an opportunity to elect another
superintendent, and take the appointment out OF
the hands of the committee he had prepared an
ordinance for that purpose which would be sub
mitted during the evening.


Mr.. Richsrl lson defended the action of the COM
mittee and said that of ten witnesses examined
the only evidence adduced WAS that MIR. Stewart
was imprudent with female domestic, and not
guilty of any criminal act. He accused Mr..
Lynch of making misstatements, and of asking
DR.. Reynolds questions in the absence Of Mr..
Stewart from the committee room, which he did
not ask him while he was present His mind
was full of predjudice against Mr.. Stewart when
he rstheard of the affair, and he had very little
doubt Of the truth of the accusations but after a
full investigation at three different meetings OF
the committee, all he could sift from the testimo.
ny was embodied in the the report.
| Mr.. Hayes spoke against the adoption of the
report, for even in the mild language with which
| it is clothed, it shows Mr. Stewart to be guilty
of imprudence, which should unfit him for the
| office which he holds.


| After considerable further discussion between
Messrs. Lynch, Pickels, Richardson and others

Judge A. Il. Giddngs, well known throughout
the State OF Michigan as man OF marked ability
and an able lawyer, attempted to commit suicide
In this city, yesterday afternoon, by jumping into
the river or Clark street bridge. At about half
past one O'Clock tho crowd Of pedestrians con-
stantly crossing this structure was considerably
excited and surprised TO see q wel-drsssed and
gentlemanly looking man, who had been leaning
over rafting at the south end OF the structure.
musingy looking into the dark aud turgtd waters
below. Chamber over the barrier and throw himself
into the stream: His inten tion, undoubtedly. was
fell on the dock and stones below.


some Of the spectators Of this singular conduos
il Was discovered that his right leg had bees
broken by tho fall, just below the knee joint and
that hts head was somewhat. but not seriously.


O0lcer o'Nen, Of the bridge squad OF police. TOOK
charge OF the sufferer, bestowed him as comforta.
e ssa as
enjoyment Of an apparently painiess rest.


Mr.. Glddings resides In Newago Mich. where he
the az fs o o. S the
and Is without q family. Holding this nigh judi
cal position, he is widely and favOrably known In
his native state. He Is q man OF fine culture and
talent. but. unfortunately nkc many other suc9
men, he - addicted to on inordinata
use OF strong drink. He frequently visits
this city, where he has many friends, ana
INDUCES In prolonged seasons OF excessive inv0xi-
cation. This depi0rable habit has partially I'M
paired his fine talents and induced at times par
tiai arrangement OF his mental faculties. 1t was.
probably, IN one OF these moods that he committed
his fatally intended deed.


On last evening, when visited BY a Times re-
porter he talked lntelllgently for time, and them
made OF EXPIRE ssiOns which indicated the PAIN
fui fact Of q diseased mud. He was told by the
warden Mr.. Mclaughlin, that he would soon be
able to be abroad again, when he said ~ viii 20

shall have to die tonight""


He was told that he was safe from all violence
and that he would be amply protected, but he In.
sisted that he was being hunted down BY an or.
ganized mob, which was intent On having ms llf8,
and to TINS belief he frequently recurred. H6
often asked for Mr.. o. f. Fuller OF the drug house
OF Fuller Fuller, to whom he says he is related.
In his possession was found number OF annual
passes over the Michigan Central and other roads.
The warden. who deems him quite deranged, has

Interesting Description of the Great Fire

 in Chicago by an Eye Witness.",,"Q Interesting Description of the Great Fir 3 in Chicago by an Eye Witness.

 A Chicago correspondent of the N Y. World writes of the fire as follows {: f "" As the fire was brought under con , tzol at point after point, the engine , came galloping up and were brough z into position till some thirty-five wer ranged about--a park of water artillery The flames made final effort to cros Michigan avenue. Had they attacked

 the Matteson and Gardner Houses anG the hve-story blocks adjoining, no hu

 man power could save the Palmer House and the Exposition building, and iron this foothold there would have beer

 naught more easy than to creep insidi

 ously through the palaces of trade ol

 to leap across the river into the north

 division and repeat the work of 1871

 It was the charge of Ehe Old Guard al

 Waterloo for empire or defeat, and the

 tiremen whose work, after Harrison

 street was abandoned, compensated fol

 their earlier errors and shortcomings,

 met the furious rush with steady de.

 termination. The roar and hiss of the

 flames as they Tapped, lowered up,

 rolled over each other in fiery pillows,

 made inaudible all other sounds. In

 deed, people had got quiet, and no

 longer yelled and rad madly to and fro

 in causeless panic or excitement. All

 along the streets where it was possible

 to crowd or cling, and upon the roofs

 and at the windows were faces, faces,

 faces. The ruddy light that made win

 dews of lofty houses in the suburbs

 glare as if they were illuminated, and

 at distance of three miles west made

 brevier type legible and faded the street lamps to ghastly white smears, brought out these faces in strong relief, while the bodies of the spectators could not

 be seen. There was on all the faces

 but one regard-a look of intentness, a concentration upon one place and thing such as will, perhaps, be seen on the last day ere it gives way here to ecstacy and there to agony. One way the avenue was paved with binders the other it glowed like a fiery furnace, seven times heated.

 Compared with the roar of the flame the busy Babel within the line of the human party to the strife was unno- ticed, the whirr of engines that vomited

 black smoke and tingling sparks into | the air, the hiss of water from bursting | hose that turned to steam in the air (which was no longer air but fre), the hoarse orders of men who moved en- veloped in clouds of moony vapor such as enveloped King Arthur when he passed forever from the sight of the fair, false queen. The fire sallied fu- riously from it's fortress, but from tenn porary barricades of charred and smok- ing boards, hastily put together as l shelters, the pipemen met it with Q steady volley. Again it fared madly out, and for 8 moment made good it's footing on the defended block, but 8 we'll l-directed stream brought down the leader of the forlorn hope. And yet once again the fire belched out furious ly like dragon of gigantic bulk seek ing to overwhelm it's opponent, but white, shining, slender as sword 8 stream of water was plunged into it 1; there was hiss and hutter the fiery pillows receded for 8 moment the blackened wall was exposed half 8 dozen streams fell on the same spot. Where flame had gone up in livid sheets, only sullen smoke ascended. The fire hung out steaming flag of truce at quarter past twelve, and with a great shout of triumph the crowd, silent and stationary hitherto, poured away to catch late cocktail and the twenty minutes to one car. T

 Con hardly believe that Eastern city readers would take much interest in an attempted description of the ""scenes and incidents of the fire. One fire differs from another fire in magnitude, and Chicago fires differ from all other fires in intensity, and this fire differed from all other Chicago fires in tbis last regard. A full report would be full of the stock incidents, most of which are probably false. It runs within my memory that in 1871 the local and for eign press combined to establish lynch law-so many lamp-posts so many pen. dant incendiaries-and prefer to wait till |"" the third day after"" when truth, like a drowned body, should come to the surface. There were the usual dis plays of personal heroism in the saving of babies, and of personal idiocy in leaving babies behind. There were probably four or five deaths from ex- plosions, falling walls, and neglect. Marrow escapes galore. Instances of great personal sagacity and calmness innumerable. have seen at least thirty men whose advice, if followed, ""would have saved the city, sir"" Thrilling incidents that specially im- press themselves on ones memory at | such a time-not many. Robbery and incendiarism nothing to speak of, and | drunkenness comparatively little.

 Taken as an aggregate the little Chi cago fire was worth describing. Re- | member that it turned into the streets 4,OO0 or 5, ,O00 people, including an un- usually large proportion of women, and | that almost all of these were of those nationalities and occupations that give most thorough vent to their excitement. Given the streets over which the fire is raging with indescribable rapidity, houses bursting everywhere into flame, barely time to catch up something and fly into the street, and on attempt ing to return finding the house flame instantaneously changing to a puff of smoke and an ember. People 500 or 1000 of these houses with prostitutes, negroes, Celts, Poles. Italians, all ter rified out of their wits. Now, let these all rush into the streets this with the leg of chair !; that with jug; the next with lot of dishes and clothing tied up in quilt, and carrying bird cage one woman carrying child under each arm, with two clinging to her skirts another shrieking for her child, her child, and all the while flying from the place where she left it; Cyprians with all their wardrobes on their backs, and though abominably drunk, scared into decency, and only able to mutter with lips made doubly white by their flaming cheeks, My God my God P the ejaculation by hiccough- ing the popular refrain

 Walk off on your ear, O!

 Germans and Swedes, in tears and seeking advice and assist"

the Governor of Tennessee, communicating
the refusal Of the President to allow certain
prisoners to be tried in the State courts for an
offence which was crime against the
State. presents . singular conflict between
national and State authority. The prisoners
are, or are assumed to be, the parties who
took certain colored men from the Jail in
Gibson county and lynched them by hanging
them. In other words, If guilty, these men
committed the crime Of murder, not in any
place within the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States, but on the soil and within the
jurisdiction of State. They are to be in
dicted and tried in federal court, under and
by virtue of the acts of Congress known as


the Enforcement acts"" SO called because
they purport ard undertake to enforce the
fifteenth amendment Of the federal constitu-
tion. If that amendment, at the time OF
derstood to authorize legislation by
which the ordinary crime Of murder,
when committed upon a negro, could be tried
in the federal courts to the exclusion OF the
State courts, probably it would not, certainly
it should not, have been adopted. The life of
eye Of the law and Of reason as the life of
white man but to assume that the murderer of
q negro cannot be, and is not likely to be, prop
erly tried and punished in the State courts,
and must be tried and punished in federal
court, is to make the life of negro more So
cred than the life OF any white man. But
there are two very grave questions involved
in this matter One is, whether the Enforce
ment acts have made the crime of murder of
either black or white man, when not COM
mittod within the exclusive jurisdiction Of the
United States, triable in federal court. The
other is, whether the fifteenth amendment
authorizes such legislation.


The fifteenth amen lment is that which
prohibits the States from denying or abridg-
ing the right OF suAraga on account of color,
race or previous condition Of servitude, and
gives power to enforce the prohibition by
appropriate legislation"" May 80, 1870,
Congress passed law to enforce this provis-
ion. 1t enacted certain punishments of in
dividuals who may have hindered or OBJ
structed other individuals in the exercise of
the right of suffrage. Whether the constitu-
tional power conferred by the amendment
authorized any legislation but such as would
counteract and nullify the laws Of any State
that might deny or abridge the right Of suf-
frage on account Of color, race &c., is certainly
q question. But, passing this question by we
call the attention of our readers to what this
Enforcement act undertook to do. Its fifth
section punished by fine and imprisonment
any person who should intimidate or attempt
to intimidate any other person having the
right to vote from exercising that right by
bribery or threats. The sixth section punished
with heavier fine and imprisonment and also
with disfranchisement any two or more
persons who should conspire, or go in dis
guise upon the highway, to injure, oppress,


threaten or intimidate any citizen with intent
to prevent or hinder his free exercise or en-
joyment of any right or privilege granted or
secured to him by the constitution or Laws of
the United States or because of his having ex-
ercised the same. The offences created by
this section were made felonies. The seventh


section then made the following provision =
''That if in the act Of violating any provision
| in either Of the two preceding sections any
other felony, crime or misdemeanor shall be
| committed, the offender, on conviction Of
violation Of said sections, shall be punished
for the same with such punishments as are at
tached to the said felonies, crimes and mis-
demeanors by the laws of the State in which
the offence may be committed"" The eighth
section gives Jurisdiction to the District
Courts of the United States over oil offences
committed against the act. Now, the natural
and obvious meaning of the seventh section
Of the offences created and punished by the fifth
and sixth sections, murder, for example, is
also committed, the federal Court may increase
the punishment Of the offences committed
against the fifth and sixth sections by admins
tering the punishment attached to murder by
the laws of the State. If the Attorney General
supposes that the seventh and eighth sections
give jurisdiction to the district courts to enter

MURDER ON THE VERGE OF THE


GALLOWS.


A CONDEMNED MAN KILLS HIS KEEPER ON THE
DAY BEFoKE ExECUTION-THREATs OF MOB
VIOLENCE.


HUDSON, N. Y, April 30.-Joe Waltz, the
murderer who is sentenced to be hanged at
Catskill tomorrow, killed his keeper,
Charles Ernst, in his cell, at O'Clock this
afternoon, by striking him on the head with
a piece of iron, smashing in his skull. Dur
ing the past week, Officer Ernst has guarded
Waltz in his cell, in order that he
should commit no injury to HIM
SELF The murder to- day had been COM
mitted sometime before it was discovered.
George Olney. with reporter, went to see
Waltz, and called for Ernst. but, no answer
being returned, they looked through the cell
door and saw him lying on the floor uncon-
scious. The officers revolver was found in
the possession of Waltz. The victim lived
only fifteen minutes after medical aid was
summoned. The prisoner manifests
a stoljd indifference as to his
horrible deed. The excitement at
Catskill is intense and at least 1000 persons
are collected around the Jail threatening to
to break down the doors and lynch the pris-
oner. The sheriff is determined to maintain
order and carry outthe sentence ofthe court.
If the mob does not take the affair into its
hands Waltz will be hanged to- morrow. The
governor has been appealed to and two COM
panies of militia have been ordered to pro-
ceed from Albany to Catskill forthwith."

SanbUrn contracts was in order, but, at the re-
quest OF General BUTLzK who is sick and who
desired 10 speak, the discussion was postponed un-
til Tomorrow.


THE POST OFFICE APPROPRIATION.


The House then resolved itself into Committee
of the Whole on the post office appropriation bill,
mir. PARSONS in ths chatr) By orler of the
House general debate was limited to one hour and
Mr. HOLMAN, Of Ind called attention to the in
crease Of three and quarter millions in this bill
over last year, and said it would be we'll to stop
and inquire whether this iron the extortioEs
Of railroad corporations lie referred to the tables
Showing the rate paid tho Erie railroad which
had grown follows: In 1859, SIPS 175; lS7O sl22-
575; ISL sl225T5 lsT2 SI3S COO 1878, Sl72OoO and
for the present year 1923 59S. This rate, he said,
was greater by sls7 900 than If the same space was
devoted to the transportation Of passengers.


Mr.. HOLMAN had read the confidential circu-
lar Of Giles A. Smith, inviting railroad co-opera
tlOn ia securing an increase Of compensation, and
charged that the present enormous increase was
the result of the plans then laid in 1872 by Giles
A Smith, who had held the position OF second
Increased payments to the railroads, and said 1t
was hundred per cent. more than was paid dur
ing the war when the currency was deprecated
and values of all kinds inflated.


Mr. WOOD, of n. Y, said he desired to know

he thSn proeeeced TO reply TO some remarks by
Mr. e. II: ROBERTS. of n. Y, made yesterday, in
relation 10 the responsibility Of the Republican
party. He charged that Mr.. ROBERTS had taken
undue advantage Of the last ten minutes of the
aiiaEIons to party had been avoided by W himself
And by Mr. BECK and the others on that side. He
lhen proceeded to arraign.the Republican party,
Especially in New York, for alleged favortism to
defaulters and others guilty Of q violation Of the
iaT, for partisan purposes.


that he felt 1t his duty TO reply to remarks made
by Messrs. WOOD and BECK. who had, when o
bill to reI cal the tax on matches was under con-
Slderati0n, assailed the Republican party and
charged upon It the moiety system.


He again asserted that it was Republican
member who insugurated the cancellation OF the
.tnoiety law, a Republican House that bad sup
ported him. and Republican committee that had
reported the bill He, however, paid complf-
knent to the members Of the Ways and. Means
Eommittee, Democratic and Republican, who had
reform.


Mr.. RANDALL Of Pa, charged that the Re-
puDllcan party was responsible for the molety
eysten, and said the clause under which the San
Pern contracts were made was put in by almost
MI. ROBERTS said the vote was not upon that
1isCnSt question, but on the adoption OF the re-
port OF conference committee


Mr.. RANDALL said MI. Hale and him sslf
had called the attention OF the House 10 this
Slause, and the issue had been made upon IL.
Once It had been rejected in the House, but, by
feoruiting, they were able 70 pass il by a small

he been prophet, he could have said nothing
pnore prophetic than the words that he uttered a.
that time; He said the Democratic party had
almost solIdly opposed II, and the Republican

fest-had voted for the clause.


Mr.. DAWES. So did NIBLACK.
Mr. ROBERTS said there were many other
distinct propositions voted upon m adopting the
conference report and 1t could not be claimed that
this Hes the issue. ---- =
Mr. TYNERth then took the aoor, and in reply
10 Mr. HOLMAN, he said the Smith circular was

same month . number Of railroad corporations

TO LICENSE THE scAyENaERs.


Council met at the usual hour, last evening,
and WAS presided over by President Maris.


The City Auditor reported balance in bank
of $50, 1879.


The Chief Engineer of the water works re-
ported IL men employed in the Department, and
$50 men and : carts on the new basin. The
Street Commissioner reported SO men aud II
horses and carts employed.


The special committee to which was referred
the petition for modification of the ordinance
requiring the cleansing of cess-pools by the
Odorless Exeayator reported that there was no
ordinance to require the cleansing of cess-pools
by machinery only, and recommended the grant
ing of license to night scayengers as well as to
the Odorless machine.


Mr. Baker inquired If the cleaning of CESS
pools was not sort of free business-if any
night scayengers are prevented from their work


Mr.. Mcintire replied that monopoly had
been granted to the Odorless Excavating Co.,
and that the Mayor had felt constrained under
the city charter to fine the old scavengers who
had been arrested while in the performance of
| such work


| Mr.. Baker said that the Mayor had declined to
interfere in these cases. but had he been called
upon to arrest a poor negro for illegal voting he
would have hauled him up aud fined him. Less
| than two weeks ago he saw two carts engaged In
| this business, and if he was not mistaken the
Mayor was an eye witness to the same thing.
| Mr.. Hayes thought it time something was
| done in this matter, as considerable complaint
had been made of monopoly, and while many
persons were opposed to it, it is natural that
those who are nearest it should not be. The
Mayor, he said, had imposed fines in all cases
| brought to his notice, and the friends of the
monopoly had bailed the parties.
| VIM. NJ. Candy remarked that he didn't know
that the Board of Health had the right to license
the monopoly, but it had been done and the
| scayengers under the law had no right to pur-
sue their work. The report only recommen DIS
| the licensing of the scayengers, which he
thought proper thing. He thought Council
had acted unlawfully in the matter.
| Mr. Baker stated that the Council had no au-
thorty in the matter, having delegated it to the
Board Of Health.


chine, but was OF the opinion that the men
| should be licensed. If the machine Is as good
as it III said to be let it be brought into compe-

possible.


Mr. Baker moved after some further remarks
by Mr.. Johnson to lay the subject over one
week, which WAS lost by vote of ayes and nays
as follows ayes nays, 9.
Some further discussion then ensued, when
Mr.. Baker said that if the report was adopted il

following as having occurred iD Texas:


""Abouta month since colored man
killed a white man in a fracas in this
place. The colored man was much
alarmed, knowing that should he be
caught he would be hanged to the
nearest tree convenient for the pur-
pose, there bsing no hope for fair
trial in that section. A friend of his
hearing of his situation went to see
him in his hiding place. and promis-
ed for consideration (of money of
course) to give him q powder, which
he should take when he was captured
that would prevent his being hanged
or shot. The poor man, believeing it
to be charm, readily paid the cum
demanded and received the powder,
which he should take when there
was no other hope, believing it to be
charm against being hanged or shot.
The next day the man was discovered
in his hiding place by q crowd of
white men, who were determined to
carry out the decision of Judge Lynch.
and were about to hang him to a tree
which they bad already selected. The
prisoner. with great reluctance. yet
having faith in the power of his pow
der, was taken to the tree, and when
all arrangements were made he took
the powder from his pocket and swal-
lowed it. The effect was quickly seen
as he fell dead Immediately."

 particular spot; going, as he would have to in one place, through..a small forest of scrubs, brush and small timber. and be left a half mile below, on very clear. nice, pretty place to deposit him, may seem clear to some, but almost all our citizens think that if regiment of men should go over that dam, one at time, and if one could struggle along and get as far down as this man was found, he would have to come out of the stream and go by land.

 The question will be asked, what motive was there to murder this man, if murdered he was. It cannot be surmised there was an intent to commit murder for robbery or anything else, but theory is advanced by some as follows that after leaving Mr. Lynch's, he fell among others, whom he joined on grand drunk, and which ter minated in fight, conducted in that beast ly; brutish manner characteristic of some drunken fights, and in the melee was kicked to death or killed by blows from stones or other sharp instruments, and after it was found he could not be restored, the plan of taking hat, coat, Sc. to the stream above, was part of ''put up job,"" to mislead Tn the detection of the true cause of death. What further action will be taken in this case, we are not informed, but that further attention should be given to it, is the opin- ion Of many.

 1Hose Me0ing ROcEs.-CoNN. WESTERN NEWS. A correspondent of yours, in your issue of January 9th, 1874, makes some enquiries respecting the moving rocks in the Washinee lake. The greater number of the rocks. or rather boulders, lie near the northwestern shore of the lake, and within hundred rods of the Twin Lakes station. They are of all sizes. from a square foot up to one of eight feet in length and four by four feet in width and helght. Some of them are with half their height above the surface of the water, and all of them in water not exceeding 1-2 feet in depth. The shoal water extends in some points thirty or forty rods from the shore. The movement takes place only in the win ter, and always shoreward, and the distance travelled is probably not uniformly the same from year to year. It is generally supposed by those who have observed the workings of the ice in our lakes, that it expands in severe cold weather and pushes from the center towards the shore. Where the shore is not too precipitous, it is frequently forced up the banks three or four feet, or washing, pile up in masses few feet from the shore. These rocks in the Washining all lie in shoal water, on & sandy and gray ely bottom, and when. imbedded in ice from l2 to 20 inches in thickness, are car ried by the expansion of perhaps one hun dred acres of ice. Mounds of gravel i'm mediately before them, and depression in their rear, indicate their change of locality. The track of the largest rock is plainly to be seen for several rods. There is also on the shore of the lake ridge evidently formed by the picking up of rocks by the ice in ages past, similar to those noticed by your correspondent near Pittsfeld, Mass. But, Dr. R., come down some still day in May or June next and investigate the mat ter yourself. and if you will give an old friend day or two's notice l should be much pleased to meet you there. N.

 F. S.-1t may be asked why these phe- nomena are not witnessed in other lakes. In reply I would state that in many of our lakes the water deepens too rapidly from the shore to have them strongly marked. Also there are few, or none, in this vicini- ty which have powders scattered in such shoal water, and on such sandy or gray ely bottom. N.

 Lakeville, Jan. 12th, 1874,

 Distressing Suicide. e.-Thursday evening of last week, Clan. sth,) John A. Shute, a New York ''drummer,"" 26 years of age, and who .appeared to have been con- nected with the firm of Wm. Shute & Co.,, AT & 429 West 18th street. New York, ar rived at the Dudley House in Falls Village He was shown to a room, and the next morning after his breakfast. walked over to the tin store of Mir. Dean, ostensibly for the purpose of seeing him on some busi- ness. As Mir. Dean was away, he returned to the hotel to await his arrival home. He was seen to pass through the hall of the Dudley House and up stairs at about II o'clock in the forenoon. At noon, lady belonging to the house cssayed to go into his room, but found the door locked, and hearing him in there, went directly away, and nothing more was thought about him, except the fact that he had not been at din- ner or tea Friday, but was supposed to be somewhere about the village on business j; nothing unusual having been observed in his conduct to occasion thought that any thing was..wrong with him. At about 10 o'clock Saturday forenoon, chambermaid attempted to go into his room to make up the bed for the morning, and found his door locked. Notifying Landlord Dudley of the fact, he, with his clerk ascended to the room, and observing through the key hole disarrangement of the room furni- ture, creating in his mind an impression that all was not right, succeeded in push ing the key of the door, which was on the inside, out on the floor, and unlocked the door, when he discovered young Shute sus- pended by his neck with his neck tic, in the closet ot his room. This clothes press is very small, being perhaps four feet one way by two and half the other. Through this small room, large square timber of the house passes diagonally, at an angle of about 45 degrees. This timber stands out from the inside wall, leaving space be- tween it and the wall of eight and three quarter inches. Above on the wall back of this timber was a row of clothes hooks, also two or three at each of the two ends of the room. One hook on each of the

 iSeuere Practical Joke.-Not long since an acquaintance of ours had an Emerald Islander at work for him, and being in the woods one day with him, found wild tur nip and pulled it up. Pat asked what that was. Our acquaintance replied Ia sweet turnip,"" and commenced pairing as he would field turnip preparatory to eating. After pairing, he cut off slice and handed it in an indifferent way to Pat, who at once took generous mouthful. After chewing very short time he rushed to spring nesr by and commenced bathing his tongue, which only added to the excruciating fire. He then attempted to scrape his tongue with his knife, but for time found no re- lief, and finally in desperation he turned to our friend and piteously besought him to take him home that he might 'sdie on his bed like man."" After the intense burn ing sensation had somewhat subsided, and he could begin to talk, our friend innocent lY asked him how it tasted, when Pat very soberly answered, ""Be jabbers, was jist agoin to say how good he was when he at- | tackled me-"" M

 Our Tesegraph Station.-ED1ToR CONN WESTERN NEWS We have Waited long and patiently for the telegraph station promised us that would be located at thls place in fact so long that our patience is we'll nigh exhausted, and yet no telegraph. It is true the wires run through our village, and on winday days we can hear their s'mournful cadence as they vibrate in the breeze, but that does not bring the cherished object. Cannot you, MT Editor, stir up the people to the subject? The Press is all powerful to direct the public mind. Let their attention be called to it. Let it be kept before them. Let them become united in their call f0r it and will warrant we will have it. The argument may be used that it will not pay. Who knows that it will not, until it is tried /? Let us have the ex- perimcnt. Ask the people of any little village who have it. They will tell you it pays. Ask any private business firm who have it in their offices even in our town, and they will tell you it pays. Go to our large cities that are covered with net work of wires, hundreds of which are prl- vate lines, simply running from the office to the factory or warehouses. Ask the owners of those lines. They will tell you pays. To be without the telegraph is to be behind the age. Stir up the people, Mr. Editor. CITIZEN.

 Salisbury, Jan. lltb, 1874.

 Exactly so, MT. Citizen, the business of gett ing for our people the benefits of a tel egraph,> ought not to have slumbered so long. To have the wires pass through our village, and not be able to make them available is most surely what ought not to be. The Hon. Wm. H. Barnum h as promised faithfully that telegraph sta tion should be located in this village. This promise was made in our presence, so we know whereof we speak; and is this not enough? Mr. Barnum's word is good enough for us, and his attention to the matter will secure it at once. He unques. tionably would have attended to it long ere this. had not a multiplicity of every thing else in the way of business driven it from his memory, and this allusion to 1t is now probably all that is necessary for the prompt establishment of an office here. Taat Myste,1ous Death. Below we give the verdict of the jury in the death of Andrew Neville, who was found dead in the small stream which passes through this village, last Thursday morning.

 L1ToHFIRLD COUNTY ss. Salisbury, January 9th, 1873.

 The undersigned jurors, being duly i'm | paneled and sworn, to inquire of inc cause | and manner of the death of Andrew Nev- l file of Salisbury. having viewed the body of said deceased and considered the evi- dence given us, do on our oaths say, that | said Andrew Neville came to his death while in state of intoxication, by receiv- 1 ing severe wounds upon the head, either by falling upon rocks and stones or by being beaten with some hard substance upon the head by some person or persons to us un- known.

 In their investigations the jury eliciteG the following facts: Andrew Neville left his home on Wednesday morning to work in the ore bed ss usual, but the superin- tendent theresdecided not to have the men work on account of the..water and mud :; Neville left there between ten and eleven o'clock and went to Lakeville, where he became intoxicated, and remained about there in that state until after four o'clock, when he started for..Salisbury and reached Patrick Lynch's, his brother-in- law, near the depot, about five o'clock, still very much intoxicated. He remained there about an hour and drank something while there, and started for his home as they sup posed, about six o'clock, and was not seen afterwards until found dead as described in THE NEWS of last week. His hat was found in the Hume of what is called the Forge Pond his overcoat.abcut 100 yards below, and his jacket in the meadow near the junction of the Pierce brook with the Riga stream. The jury were all satisfied that he came to his death by the injuries received on his head and not by drowning,"

RebubIican Rally. The Third Term,
There was an immense gathering in Cooper

meeting to ratify the state ticket. Hon. VIM.

of the propriety Of giving preference to those

would soon have all its debts except SS, 900. 900

The Wool Tariff


A meeting called by the Chamber of Com
merce committee was held to-day to consider
the simplification of the classification of wools
and the alteration in the mode of collecting du-
ties. Various branches Of the wool interests
were represented. James Lynch, chairman,
said that the act of 1867 is so complicated that
the best experts cannot understand it, and be-
sides it is unequal and unjust and prejudicial to
American wool growers. The fourteen rates of
duties and the heavy penalties for mistakes in
entering deter foreign shippers, and the COM
merce in foreign woods is to large extent de-
CTR I'm II,fiac fro,
cent, as the port appraiser may fix them. This
certainly should be remedied. In the course of
the discussion it was shown that since 1867 the
wool trade in Canada had sprung up and is
f1ourishing under free trade, while in these
states trade is declining and mills are idle. A
committee was appointed to report to future
meeting

with so little effect in securing redress

thoroughly are these ruiiiins en- rapport

not bring to justice the outlaws that in

with them their ill-gotten gains.


These transactions have become


so COMMON AND NOTORIOUS


That nobody hercabouts any longer re.
CARDS them as otherwise than matters Of
course, and the repeated faiares of such
men as Ross Adar, Boudlnot, Wright
and other prominent Indians to secure
action at Washington for our relief have
at last brought the people here into sort
Of apathetic Indifference to the whole
matter. The thieves take what horses
and cattle they want, and the law abiding
people are thankful for what are left.
The deputy marshals sometimes come
with posse of soldiers and arrest some
Of the outlaws, who are either permitted
to escape or else released on straw bail,
and then in few days tie outlaws will
come into town here or at Gibson, and

BOAST THAT TIILY COR OFF


By wliacking up y with tho officers l
will relate an instance 10 show how it is
done.


About the first or May, Deputy Mar
shal WiIkeson, with posse Of fourteen
soldiers, arrested the notorious half breed
Joe Queen and another desperate named
John Morgan, on q charge Of robbing a
passenger ON the NJ X. and T., coming
down from Chetopa. ltdoes not appear,
from all that can bc learned Of the affair,
that Morgan was directly concerned in
the robbery, but Qaccn was; and his
partner in the affair, Jack Blythe, escap
ed, and eluded the search Of the officers
Morgan, however, is notoriously in com
plicity with the gang of which Queen is
the leader. Shortly after his arrest,
Qucen, who, who was not at all discon
certed by his arrest told Mr.. Beck of
this place that he should get OF all right
but


IT WOULD COST HIM ABOUT 5000.
They were then put under guard of one
soldier a piece and the balance Of the sol
diers were sent out of the way. Shortly
afterward they both escaped. The sol.
diers ran after them firing their revolvers
high in the air, but gave up the pursuit
before they had gone ten rods. These
facts, taken in connection with Queens
boast, satisfied our citizens that the mar
to let the men go. Queen had been twice
arrested before by Deputy Marshal ohm
son, for violating the liquor law, but al
ways managed to get off without being
taken to Fort Smith. He gave straw bail
on one occasion, Johnson and Morgan
certifying to the security of his bond.


Some time ago Johnson was here and
was informed that there was n box in the
express office containing smuggled H.
quor. He went and broke open the box,
tasted Of the liquor and then told the
man to whom it was consigned to take it
along and keep his head shut. A man
who was presented asked Johnson why
he did not arrest the man and johnson
replied that


THERE WAS NO MONEY IN I'M CASE
He then added that he was uG, ~ .O0i !,
he knew what he was about ae worked
for money the same as Dybody else
would do in his place.


These are two instances They are
simply given as illustrations The peo-
pie down here are thoroughly satisfied
that they cannot look to the United
States officials for any sort of protection
from the gang of thieves and outlaws
which roams about the Indian territory
north Of the Arkansas river. There is
but one remedy aud that the people may
be driven to apply before long. 1t has
proved cllicacious before and il may
again. And if lynchlaw should be in
augurated it is impossible to say where
it would stop The temper Of the peo-
pic is such that some of the deputy mar
shals might suffer as we'll as the outlaws
if they should get in the way."

DEAR WHIG:-Traveling through the
southern country is not the most pleasant
way of passing the Summer months, but it
is beyond doubt the best season-for any
one thinking of settling thereto make
the trip. At this time it presents the most
uninviting features not only of climate and
inanimate things, but of animate creatures
as well, and our estimate of its attractions
and advantages is not SO likely to be exag-
gerated, as is too apt to be when coming
from the North in Winter.


You no doubt read in iScra5ner's, some
time since, a series of articles descriptive of
Tennessee and adjoining States, particu-

Norfolk, via Lynchburg. All these articles
as we'll as those appearing in the New York
GrapAic, were written under Ito the writers
thereof peculiarly auspicious Gas Mr.. Wegg
would say circumstances. These letters
were calculated to deceive and lead many
persons astray. The writers were induced
to see this country in the exaggerated con-
dition of beauty and wealth of which they
write, through the medium of sunGry CLAN.

OF the Mountain Meadow massacre. Mr.. Mclean,

and made his seventh vile. Mr. Mclean sent his
two children. after this happened, TO hts iather-ln-
law, in New Orleans. They were a boy and girl,
and as interesting as children could be. Some
time after they arrived at New Orleans the
mother lett Salt Lake and went and got them
and started 10 utan with Them. The almost
pr0ken-hearted father lett his business TO look
alter his children. ON arriving at New York he
heard or Pratt IN the city and tracked him 70 ~.

letters written in CIPHER TO Mrs. p. r. Parker, the
assumed name Of his wife. Having become abe
TO declpaer the letters ne learned from

known TO the laws OF tue United states under
which he could be held he was released. Never

When Mr. Mclean appeared IN Court and read the

stated The history Vi his so aapay family beng
broken up, the p ope desired to lynch Pratt, and
he was put IN jail to prevent 1t being done. Mclean
himself became so highly o1ended and so deeply

was secretly discharged early The next morning,
but the watchfulness OF Mclean ioulu 1t out, and

Agricultural Fair at Waco, Texas, on the Goth

nonsense that it is worthy of notice In
stead of indulgng in stale rhodomOntade
about the Sunny South and the Lost Cause,
the speaker cried: Rotate your crops, hori-
""zontaize your hills, drain and underdrain ~

ernOr that can produce corn and all the
cereals, cotton, sugar, and various minor
""crops. You have innumerable herds Of

is because Texas does not know how to

Texans is always Cotton! cotton !
""cOtton"" So the State annually pays
$5,OOO,OO0 when she might export $10,0OOOO0.
She sends to Missouri for her -four, when she
might ""grow more grain than all the North

peculiarly fitted for cotton culture. she has
been selling ""a priceless heritage for mess

factories of her own7 Why should she 60 On

corn also. Texas wants yankee labor, Ger

""and above all she wants as laborers her own
"" brothers across the Mississippi"" ""Texas
wants education"" adds the speaker; and
then he sounds the keynote of his ad-
dress pirate less of politics !"" says he.


There could not be more sensible advice than
was given upon this point of ""politics"" to
those Texan farmers then and there assem-
bled. ""a spirit of reverence for law and
""order"" was inculcated. The danger of the
mob and of all manner of violence was
pointed out. Better times for the South were
promised. 81 believe"" said Mr.. Hubbard,
uttering prophecy which seems already upon
the point of ful6llment, ""though sounds of
""woe come up from despairing States, that the
masses are determined to eject organized
corruption from high places, and the coun-
+"" try of Washington, with the associations OF
the happier past, will be restored""


81 would not pluck single star"" said the
orator, "" from the flag that fOated over
""our ancestors and u.s."" This was the Ian
guage addressed by Southern speaker to
Southern crowd inf 1874; and it was received,
we are told, with great satisfaction"" Then,
though a denunciation Of whining, sickly
demagogues was uttered with fervid force.
nobody spoke of lynching the orator. 1t is
evident that he took it for granted that he
was before honest sensible, well-meaniDg men.
The character of the address vouches for the
character of its auditors. And this was in
Texas-a State which only o few years ago
had character which it is unnecessary for US
to describe. Evidently Texas is producing now
something better than bowie knives, horned
frogs, and fever vt is producing men! 1t
would be strange if this State, born of ultra
Southern infatuation, should take the lead in
Southern restoration upon sound principles of
political economy and of public and social
morality."

particulars Of the tra7edy referred to in
last nights dispatch have come to light
The murdered party consisted of a taml-
ly of one man, his wife and a child, about
TWO years old. The man was about TWEEN
five and the woman about twenty-five.
They passed through this city OH the twon
tv-fuurth OF November, on their way TO
Texas, arriving at Rock Creek, seven
mi, S out from this city, about twelve
O'Clock on that day The water was very
/ high, and they took ""A side road leading
of from the main road, striking it about
a half mile above the regular crossing
At this point the man was shot through
the head, the woman and child had their
skulls crushed with a club, aud the bodies
were thrown into the creek The bodies
OF the man and woman were found on
Sunday, the child was found last ght
All three Of the bodies were brought tu
this city to-day. The wagon and team of
four mules were found in possession Of ""a
colored man named Medlock, who lived ""a
short distance from the scene of the trag
edy. Failing to give any good account OF
how he came into possession Of il, he was
arrested, and the evidence developed al
the coroner's inquest pointed to him as
the guilty party The jury found him
guilty, and he was sent to jail to await tn
action Of the grand jury. The wagon is
new one, made by A. Garish, Rolu,
Missouri. No clue has yet been obtained
as to the names OF the murdered party.
Great Indignation is expressed ut The
tragedy, and there is some talk of lynch
ing the negro.


From papers and clothing found at the
house Of the negro Medlock, arrested on
the charge of numbering the family refer
red to in last nights dispatches, there re-
mains 10 doubt that the negro committed
the deed. The boxes and clothing, every
thing, in fact, that belonged TO the fam |
lily, were found in the negro's house. On |
the boxes were marks OF blood, a. we'll ~
on other articles. A paper found shows
the name OF the murdered man TO have
been George w. Ritcheson, or Richardson,
or j. j. Ritcheson, and that he came from
near Rolla, Missouri."

which is corroborated by Mr. Lynch, Chief OIlcer,

time he would prefer that the committees be composer
of two or three members, matters would come

been sold, an ordinance was introduced in Coun-
ell, last evening, to exempt the building of the
new city reservoir from the provisions of the
contract ordinance and allow the same to be done
under the supervision of the Water Committee.
The ordinance was passed to its third reading,
and in order to ascertain the views of the men-
bers upon the subject, the vote by which it was
read second time WAS reconsidered and again
put, Messrs. Burke, "". NJ. Candy, Hayes and
Lynch voting nay. Those who voted i'll the
Affirmative are not bound, Of course, to vote for
the ordinance on its final passage, although an
effort was made to pledge them to this course.


1t therefore seems that there is determine
ton on the part of Council TO avoid the cheapest
and best way for the city in the building of this
new basin. They seem to have already made
up their minds to disregard the evident wish of
the taxpayers in the matter, and to push for
ward the work on the principle of jobbery. Be-
meath this whole effort there Turks a suspicion
which haunts the chambers Of the mind with its
phantom forms. 1t bears upon its face a stigma
which the pretended deep interest in the well
fare of the working people will not etface.
1t is a fact and we'll known to all men
that no matter whether this work be done by
the day or by contract it will afford employ
ment to our idle population. The supervision
OF the Water Committee does not guarantee an
impartial employment of the idle; on the con-
trary, it will have entirely different result. II
the work is let out to contract TO the lowest bid
der, the contractor, whoever he may be, will be
obliged to find work for our own people because
his own interest will lead him to SO. Home la
Dor is always tine cheapest, the most reliable and
the best.


The step which Council is about to take is an
important one, and We urge that nothing be
done hurriedly. Let TINA be taken, the subject
be considered in all its bearings, and then lei
whatever course may be determined upon be
forwarded in wisdom and with view to the true
interests OF the city."

majority in the Lower House of the
Forty-iourth Congress, there will be a
good deal of speculation as 10 what they
will do with il. The first thing the coun-
try wants done. is an honest and unspar-
ing investigation Of every department of
the Government that has fallen under sus-
piGon-the Department of the Inferior
with its Indian rings, and the Department
of Justice, especially. Hew these semi
naries of fraud and pillage and partisan
iniquity, have been closed against the in
quiries of the people. Is well known.
Then will follow some pretty active opera
tons in the impeachment line. unless the
present Congress shall take the hint and.
by undertaking this work. shall give the
Delanos. Williamses and Darrells chance
to escape the wrath TO come. The hero
oe the Landaulet, particularly. should be-
gin at once to get out of the way and COW
er up his tracks. He is responsible for
the most infamous usurpations. as well as
for some of the worst cases Of malfeas-
ance and corruption In Office. He Is at
the bottom of all the carpei-bag conspira-
cies in the South. But for him the plots
of Spencer i'm Alabama. of Kellogg and
Packard in Louisiana, of Moses in South
Carolina, and of Clayton and Mcclure I'm
Arkansas, would never have become such
successful agencies of anarchy and
mischief. He is the author of the outrage
campaign which has just panned out so
miserably. In carrying Ii out he has not
9nly disregarded the decisions OF L. 5.
Courts, bur has openly violated the very
law he was pretending TO enforce. While
negroes were being lynched with impuni-
tv and without question from him in Kan
sas and Pennsylvania. he was looking for
such crimes only where the aid of his
troops and marshals was needed to sustain
carpet-bag usurpers in pending elections.
He assumed command of the army and
navy. hurled them against Alabama and
Louisiana, and sent partizan dcputities TO
make wholesale arrests, filling every cor
ner of those States with terror. He had
claimed authority under the enforcem Mt
acts TO police the country with troops and
marshals. and order arrests wherever he
NAV choose to think such course neces-
sary TO keep the peace. His whole out
rage campaign has failed of its object. lie
stands to-day guilty of the highest crimes
against the liberties Of the people. and If
he dafes 10 remain I'm office till the 4th day
Of next March, he must confront n House
that will impcach him az sure as IL meets.
All we fear l. that the Administration will
find him. at the peoples expense. an asy-
lum where he will be safe from the wrath
Of the peoples representatiyes.-Kansds

Buckingham county has sensation. A
wonderful cave has been discovered
there. which writer in the Farmvllle
NJ rcury tells about. After describing
several chambers, the account contln-
ues


eve had satisfied our curiosity and
were about to leave the cave, when be-
hind large rock, or rather a spur of the
main rock which formed the bottom, my
son discovered a larger passage than
any we had before seen. This we en-
tered, and after following some SIX or
seven feet merged into an apartment OF
immense size. The light of our torches
falling upon the stalactites revealed
scene of beauty which was talrly daz-
zling. The size of this apartment
cannot tell, as the roof and sides were
lost in darkness. We penetrated to
considerable distance, keeping close 10
one of the sides so that we might easily
fnd oar way back, and would have gone
farther but for finding in a recess, some
seventy feet from whAre We entered, ly-
ing directly under shelving rock, the
body of q man wrapped Ill some dlngy
cloth-like substance. We did not know
it was the body of man at first, and
"" re not positive it was until We had
gotten it outside of the cave.


'' Mr.. Bovd discovered the body, and
when we moved it from under the rock
nv son found several large and beautl-
ful pebbles where the body had lain,
and a small round vessel some four
inches in diameter and about two inches
in height, shaped very much like an
ink-stand with handle this and the
stones or pebbles he put in his pocket.
| We took the body and at once went out
of the cave. The clothes with which it
was wrapped were very rotten, and when
we had laid thesbody down after leaving
! the cave, they had nearly all been rub
bed from it. What YeAa left crusnol .,

Of means. She was killed within few yards
of her residence. in broad daylight, BY a
colored man named Joshua Griffin, armed
with club, who knocked her down after

suit and a near escape from lynching, he was
arrested, charged with the commission of the
deed, and lodged in Jail at Belair.


The murderer was raised by Miss Taylor.
and lived with her until a few years since,
when his bad habits nscesstated his dis

while the other members Of the family were
at work in distant field, and committed the

On Saturday last an itinerans pedier entered
the house OF James Tolin, living near this place,
and proceeded so display his wares to Mrs. Toln,
despite her assertions that she did not wish to buy
anything. Mr.. Tolin was confined to his bed and
had been SO confined for many years. being SO
crippled with rhe amatism that 1t had been long
impossible for him to leave his bed unless carried
from IT, After showing his goods, and Mrs. Tolin
not buying anything, the pedler commenced .
conversation, In the course OF which he
learned the helpless condition OF Mr..
Tolin. Finally he made an insulting
proposal to Mrs. Tolin, and she Indignantly or
dered him to leave tie house. Instead he ap-
preached her and seized hold OF her, saying with
an oath, that she was In his power as her husband
was as good as dead. Mrs. Tolin, being delicate
woman ran screaming into another room. Tho
pedler followed her. and, before she could escape
by the door. caught her again. A desperate strug-

thrown violently to the noor by the powerful vii

around the waist and was enoeavoring again 10

singular spectacle OF q bedrldden cripple hasten
ing to the de tense OF his wife seemed to parayze
the scoundrel, and he stood staring as n III Q
trance at the approach OF the husband.
Mr.. Tolin. nerved by unnatural strength,
brought the crutch down over the head OF the
pedte and relied him like an OK to the nOOr. Tne
next instant the excitement and superhuman
effort that had supported the husband lett him.
With shrek, that told Of the intense agony OF the
relapse, he clasped hts hand to his forehead and
dropped to the floor and almost

one to the PenItentiary. Those taken to the jail
were taken out BY an armed mob OF negroes shot,
mutiIated and buried. the mob called for all the
negroes but the incarceration Of the other in the
Penitentlary saved his life.

examined, and the Coroner's jury sat nearly two
weeks and yesterday rendered verdict. The
verdict was that ""The parties lynched
were shot to death on the night ol

John owen, Columbus Perry, Ell McClotchy and
Bill Hughes, and other negroes unknown to the
Jury: that the taller and his guards were guilty ol
gross neglect in not taking proper precautions,

murder the prisoners and in disregarding the POSI-

Jail where they would have been Inaccessible to
the mob; that the Sheriff took all the precautions
he believed be necessary, and that there Is and
was general indlspositiOn TO testify as to any
facts which might furnish any clew to the discov-

In that portion of the letter in which he
attempts to explain his action toward the

placed himself in a truly pitiable position.
In his second letter to Col. Mosby he writes
'It were better to elect Grant the third

Hughes and his negroes"" and further on,
Surely Gen. Grant and all Northern gen.

What did Kemper mean when he wrote
that letterf The two conventions had been
held. Judge Hughes had been nominated
at Lynchburg and Gen. Kemper himself
had been nominated at Richmond. The
issue was fairly made up between the two
parties. What did the offer of fifty thou
sand braves mean except that Gen.
Grant might count upon him and
upon them for third term, if he would
only consent to throw his influence for
Kemper against Hughes. General Kemper
now denies that he entertained sentiments
of this character at that timei and he en-

Mosby's letters to him? 1t is impossible to
understand correctly the one without the
other. In December, 1873, he writes to
Mosby: 81 bear in mind all that you say,

to which Mr.. Kemper was so much ''alive?""

OF a mile, has q rise and ia OF only six inches

was called the invited guests began TO crowd
into the enclosure, and when the contestants IN
The hali-mile run took their positions the attned-
ance was very large, the iairer portion OF hu-
manity equalling in numbers those Of the sterner
sex. Many of the visitors came to the track in
carriages and remained seated in them during the
whole OF the sport There were on the programme
five events, embracing hal-milc run, three mile
walk, 100 yard run, In heats, open to all amateurs
100 yard run lor members and one-quarter OF a

OF age. These were all decided in quick succession
and IN q manner that drew from the assembled
hundreds cheers OF appreciation Messrs. G. f.

running contests, and Mr. j. Simonson as referee
in the three mile walk. Mr.. Charles H. Pierce

Some ordinary routine business having been trans
acted, the Treasurer presented bills for supplies TO
Wards Island and Castle Garden, amounting to
$l4,2B Is, and pay rolls for the month S. IA 67,
the whole amounting to $4,000 IS. These were
passed by the Board.


The resignation Of p J. Macpherson. interpreter,

Mr.. Forrest made application for the vacancy,
but, on the motion or Mr.. Stephenson, the matter
OF Charles Schn, gatekeeper, was accepted; and,
on the nomination Of Mr.. Stephenson. Louis Ciuf
was appointed in his place. John 5. Robinson was
appointed agent OF the Commissioners at BufJalO

solved that the agency at Poughkeepsie be discOn-

DR.. Philip Essroger, as resident physician at
Wards Island, was accepted. The matter OF ap-
pointing assistants TO the chief clerk IN the Labor
Bureau was referred to the Castle Garden Commit

The agent OF the Alsace-Lorraine Society ap-
peared before che Board and strongly urged that
the employ es OF that society might be allowed IN
gress immediately on arrival to the emIgrants
from their country, to protect them from lodging
house runners and other injurious persons. The
members OF the Board coinclded with C0mmis-
sloner Lynch that the rule should, without excep-
tiOn be sustained that the agents of no society or
nationality whatsoever be admitted to the emi-
grants until the officials OF Castle Garden had fully
completed their duties.


This concluded the proceedings, and an adjourn

They claim to have discovered new island, or conti- nent, about 200 miles north of Nova Zem- bla. By means of sledges they pushed their exploration of this country to lati- tude 30.

 The Redemption Agency organized by the Treasury department finds it impossi- ble to attend to notes of small denomina- tions sent in, and has suspended tempor- arily the redemption of amounts they could not attend to. There seems to have been no sufficient provision for the addl- tional labor thrown on the the department by this law.

 The government secret service detec- tives employed at Washington are turning out worse scoundrels than the fellows they were set to detect. One Nettleship is Q specimen biood-sucker. He had $6, a day, salary; B per day for subsistence, beside heavy Sinc1dentals; and, in addi- tion, has been drawing for three years past salary of 8 day as an inspector in the New York custom house.

 New York Republicans have done well in renominating Gov. Dix. He has proved an excellent executive and deserves the mark of confidence the convention ac- corded him. In one matter we are disap- pointed with our New York friends They denounce the revolution in Louisiana, but have not word to say of the fraud and oppression that have caused the revolu- tion. That may be good partisanship but it is very poor patriotism.

 The railroad war in Wisconsin seems to have resulted in complete victory for the grangers. The last bit of railroad uncov- cred by judicial injunction to compel obedience to the Potter law, was section of the Milwaukee and St Paul road suppos- ed to have been organized under d close charter. A careful examination, however, shows that no such feature now exists in their act of incorporation.

 In his attack on the present New Ha- ven school board Dr. Carmody tCatholic) claims that member of the board receiv- ed $1,0O0 from Lippincotts < Go. for in- troducing their books into the New Ha- ven schools. Dr. Bacon ''calls for an in- vestigation."" He has done that once be- fore, if we recolIect.

 The report that the Spanish Bourbon claimants had united in the support of Don Carlos pretentiors to the throne seems improbable on it's face. If there is any restoration it must evidently be of the family of the late Queen, not of Don Carlos The former are too we'll aware of their advantage to compromise them selves with the Carlist movement.

 Senator Schurz made very sensible speech at St. Louis, last week. While condemning the present usurpation in Louisiana, he thought 1t would not do to allow its overthrow by armed force. He spoke in severe terms of the lynching out rages in Louisiana He also said, ''It Is to be hoped that by this time the people of the south have learned that those who disgrace them by deeds of bloody violence are their worst enemies and that 1t is their duty to protect. not persecute the ne groes.'

 The World argues that the right of rev olution is one that applies to the case of Louisiana, and justl6es the action of the insurgents there. Local revolutions in states are just as inconsistent with the sovereignty of the national government as a revolution against the authority of any city, town, or county would be inconsist- ent with the sovereignty of the State gov ernment. Armed strife in or between the various states of republic like ours is utterly inadmissable even in cases where, were the states independent republics, revolution would be justitiable.

 In the October Scrlbner Dr. Holland ayers that ""not one author in twenty can live on his authorial earnings. We have altogether too many men who are still drudging for the bread that feeds them and their families, though they have done good marketable literary work all their lives"" This view, not a popular one, is. no doubt, the correct one. i good part of this is owing. as the editor of Scribner maintains. to the want of an international copyright. It is so much easier for pub fishers to steal the product of some Eng Gshman's brain than it is to pay the Amer ican author fair price for his work, that most of our literature IS really foreign.

 On Monday next our citizens gre called on to vote upon constitutional amend ment giving all such towns as now have but one representative, and who have population of 5000, one additional repre- sentative. There are, We believe, but four or five towns that will be affected by this change. Bridgeport, Meriden. and Derby arc the chief sufferers from the present arrangement. There can be no doubt of the passage of this amendment Towns of 20, 900 inhabitants, like Bridge port, cannot justly be refused an equal representation with towns of less than thousand inhabitants, merely because the latter were organized earlier than the for mer.

Prohibition has been the settled policy ol
Maine for well nigh ""A quarter OF a century.
In the mean time the merits of the law have
been heralded il the utternost parts of the
earth. | have recently read II very interest
ing document, which has been much crcu-
lated in England. 1t is entitled ""A Cloud
of Witnesses Success of Prohibition ii
Maine"" The document comprises about
eight pages of testimony from the ""most
auhortive and most unimpeacllabe
sources"" including the Hon. Sidney Per-
ham then Governor of Maine; our Rcpresen-
tatives in Congress at that time Messrs.
Blaine, Frye, Hale, Peters and Lynch; our
Senators Hamlin and Morrill,; the exMay
or of Portland, the pastors of the various
churches of that city, besides Judges of
municipal courts and others throughout The
State TOO numerous to mention. They all
give it as their opinion that Pr libiIion has
heen ""a wonoerfu success"" Ex-Governor
Prrlmm in his opinion, which was given in
1872 says: ""lhe liquor trade IN this
State, think it safe to say, is Very much
less than before The enactment of this law
probal ly not one-tenlh as large"" Gen


Dow, in the State Temperance Convention
Of 1873 in an address TO the people, said ::
""Prohibi,ion has been a success in Maine.
Tho amount of intoxicating liquors CON
Sumed in that State is not one-tenh so large
as it was before the Maine Law"" And eA-
Mayor Wheelrght, of Bangor, in his opin-
ion. says lit is safe to say that in our city
not one tenth rs much is sold now as in
years prsl;"" and ga Professor in the Theo-
logical Seminary"" the exMayors, lie Col


lector Of Internal Revenue. and hosts Of
others, all ''fuy concur in the above state
nent"" Judge Lane, Of the Supreme
Court of Portland and other officials, also
say: ""We are OF the decided opinion that
the liquor trade is not one-tenih of what IL
was prior to the Maine law"" Ard Senators,
Congressman, and hosts Of clereymen all
concur. 1t may seem like presumption,
therefore, in one to question the above
statements Opinions Of men who have
gained name are always looked on as a
( ind of authority. These opinions may moi
be questioned with impunty. | suppose
we may be allowed to ask TIE question:


Are they founded OIL facts? Certainly no
facts appear in the document. That is Il
mass Of opinions. Now | would call a
cloud of Witnesses men who have
| lived in tile State all their lives, men who


nave won name and place, men of equal


learning, of equal observation, friends and
workers even in the cause of temperance
who would tell you that the Prohbilory
law was failure; had failed utterly to pre-


vent iniemperance, or even to close the grog
shops. This would simply present a war of
opinions. 1t would prove nothing. What,
then, are the facts in the case? for facts
alone must decide the question. Take first
in order the statements of ex-Gov. Perham
and others who say that not one-tentl' as
much liquor is sold now as before the en-
actment of the Maine LAWN other words


that ten times as much liquor was sold be-
lore the law as now. II that is so-if ten
times as much liquor was sold before The
law as now then there must have been
ten times as mucl, drank, and, consequently


ten times as much drunkenness. How
much drunkenness was there in Maine IN
1878? Get that fact and you have the
data to show the amount of drunkenness
before the Maine law. The report of the
inspectors of the State Prison shows thai
for the year ending Nov. 30Ih, 1873, ilerr
we e il, Maine II ,S0S arrests for drunken
ness. Now, suppose that every man who
rot drunk in Maine in 1873 was arrested


Then. according to Mr.. Perham and others,
as there was ten times as much drunken
ness before the Maine law there must have
been then ten times II .S08, making 49,
OSO drunks each year before the Maine law


This would allow a drunk to every man,
ministers not excepted, who voted for Gov
ernor in 1S50-S0 6G5-and still leave 9S,
$50 to lie accounted for. The statement Of
Mr. Perham and others proves too much.


LIQUOR SELLING AND LOU DR. DRINKING.


Another observation. Mr.. Nye, in his
Constahulary report for the year ending
1867 saws: ""It is estimated on reli'l''e au.
rloritv that. in 1866. more than 81 800.
600 were p,id for liquors brought INTO This
State"" The ProlI,itory law was IN Il""


lo,ce that year. !. had been for welI-''g''
len unbroken years. Mr.. Nye further says
More than 5000 PERSONS in this State
we're engaged in Ihc illegal sale of intoxichi.
ipa liquors in 1866"" Yet Neal Dow and
Others had already been proclaimlng the
""wonderful success"" Of the Prohihitory law
for fifteen wears. What evidence il there
to show that matters have mendcd since
1866. or in fact at all sin tie birth Of the

An Incipient Negro Riot at Ridge
Springs Is. CJ Suppressed-Prompt
Arming of the Whites Effective-Happy





AUGUSTA August 20, 1874.
Last Monday an alteration occurred at Ridge
Springs, small village situated ON the Charlotte
Columbia and Augusta Railroad, in South Carolina,
and distant forty-lOur miles from this place, be-
tween Henry Smith, colored, and Henry watson,
white, about small sum OF money which the
former owed the latter. Some words used by
Watson toward Smith lncensed the younger men,
bers OF the colored population, and vengeance was
threatened upon the white people OF the village
and vicinity. These threats became so pronounced
that the white citizens deemed 1t best to prepare
for any emergency. An agent was, therefore, sent
to Augusta early on Tuesday morning for


ARMS AND AMMUNITION.


This agent succeeded In purchasing before noon
about one hundred rifles and quantity Of liked
ammunition. short time alter twelve O'Clock
rumors began to be circulated TO the effect that
the negroes would seize the arms on their arrival
at Ridge Springs, and at three O'Clock despatch
was received announcing that Smith, Bonyer and
Raliord, three negro leaders at that place, had
lett tor Columbia, where they expected to obtain
arms, and that the negro militia had been ordered

and of1erlng to give up their arms. Warrants nave

did not seem to be very popular one with the

The papers north of Los Angeles in
Ornnge-growing sections are as usual,
at this season of the year, making u
terrble cackling over the immense
superiorty of their ripe oranges over
the green ones sent to market from
this section. Owing to the extreme
heat of the Summers in the interior
valleys in the northern part of the
State, all kinds of fruits ripen from
4 six weeks to two months earlier than
s here; their oranges are now as fully
matured rs ours will be by the first of
March. If our fruit growers are so
foolish as to sell their unripe fruit in
competition with ripe, it is their own
business, but it hurts the reputation of
the country.


The following rather curious story
comes to us well authenticated and
VIC ~ W OuI IctNGIS us lnG
most convenient and easy way of
catching deer yet discovered. A few
days ago Mr.. Robert Hall, who is liv-
ing on II bee ranch in the mountains
near Richland, was passing up a caiion
adjoining his place and came upon u
couple of buck deer who were engaged
in fierce warfare. Mr.. Hall attempted
to frighten and separate the animals
by throwing stones at them, but
found, after repeated efforts of the
kind that his presence was entirely un-
needed by the combatants. A happy
thought then struck him, and, taking
IL lariat which he had with him for
the purpose of catching his horses, he
tied the antlers of the deer securely to-
gether and left them while he pro-
cured butcher-knife from his house
and killed both of the animals. A
more novel way of securing venison
we have never heard of, and were it
not that the story is told us by an ac-
quaintance in whom we have the most
implicit confidence, we should be a
little incredulous of it."

Mr.. Hayes did not oppose the building of a
| basin. He only wanted it kept out of a clique
who would use their power for political purpo-
ses. Only take it out of the hands of such men
and he would guarantee that every Democrat in
Council would vote for the work to go on. 1t
had been stated that G. H. Gallagher, Chief En-
gineer of the Water Department, had said he
would employ no man except he was Republi-
| can.


Mr.. Baker (interrupting) said the report was
| not true.


Mr.. Taylor the report is true.
| Mr.. Febiger it is not
| Mr.. Taylor: it is.


| The chair called to order and reminded coun-
Gil that the debate was only by unanimous con-
| sent of council and the privileges should not be
abused.


| MIR. Candy objected to any further privilege
being given, but at the suggestion of several
members he withdrew his objection, to allow
Mr.. Hayes to finish his remarks.
Mr.. Hayes, resumng, said that it looked as if the
whole management OF the building of the new
basin was to be left in the hand of the Chief
Engineer of the Water Department and
the force of hands employed would
be made to vote upon the 500 tax receipts
locked up in the safe of that department. The
work can be done as well by contract as by the
day. 1t is no trifing matter to add 5000, 900
more to our already accumulated debt of $780,
900. We are the friends of the poor man, but
we want the work to be given out by contract,
to give work to all poor men promiscuously.
VIM. M. Candy said the work en the new basin
ought to proceed. He had recently inquired into
the experience of other cities in building basins,
and similar works, and had found that their pref
erence was to construct the embankment by the
day. AT Hartford, Conn, the work had been
given out by contract aud the contract afterward
Cancelled and the embankment built by the day.
In regard to the removal of the top soil, and the





done by contract. He then offered an amend
ment to the ordinance in accordance with this
view.


BY an amendment offered by Mr.. Febiger, Mr.
Canby's motion was defeated.
Mr.. Adams warmly contended for the contract
system, and lnstanced its success applied to
the building of railroads, steam ships, public
and even private buildings.
Mr.. Plckels Not all done by contract.
Mr.. Adams Nearly ALL
Mr. plckels. Oh no NOT near nil.
Mr.. Adams Perhaps not Grace Church
Qaughter) but nearly every other building of
| Importance WAS built by contract, He was in
favor of giving it out by contract so far as it
could be, and he was in favor of everybody that
could work being employed upon it without re-
gard to race, color. or nationality.
Mr.. Candy offered an additional amendment
requiring the work to be placed under the sup
ervision of a non-partisan committee of citizens
under the direction of the Water Committee, and
| to be approved by two thirds of the City Coun-
Gil, and the hands to be employed without regard
| TO political sentiment.


Mr.. Adams said he could not vote for the
amendment. Non-partisanB are hard to find
and it would be difficult to get two thirds of the
City Council to endorse any action of said COM
mittee


Mr.. Febiger considered the amendment di-
rect thrust at the Water Committee, and if it
passed he and other members of the Committee
would Immediately resign.

gram says about half past seven o'clock this
morning MS Edward Madden. editor of the Mer-
ced Tribune, going to his office he was shot
md killed by Harry Grcnice, step-son of Robt
J. Steele, editor of the San joaquin argus. It
appears that the Argus and the Tribune had, for
some time, been in constant war with each 9TH
er, but nothing serious was expected to come
from it, until about two weeks hgo when an ar
ticle appeared in the Argus, rejecting upon
young lady to whom Madden was deeply at
tached. Madden made no reply, until the is

stepped ont of Linton, Jacob & Co.'S store, be-
hind Madden shooting him in the back Mad

Granice fired four more shots, one lodging in
his right breast, another i'll the left, another in
the face little left of the nose, and another in
the thigh, killing him instantly. Granice gave
himself up. The whole trAnspired SO quickly
that those who witnessed the shooting had no
power to warn Madden or stop the firing until

well as the high standing of Madden, served to
create an excitement, which will probably ter

years of age.

to lynch Gran ce. rope was purchased and
everything prepared; but going to jail after
dark, it appeared that the prisoner had been

Grafton of the navy appropriation bill, our Rep
resentative, Hon. ]. III. Burleigh, made Sc
we're attack upon portions of the bill, particu
larly the contingent fund, which he proposed
to have reduced because it was used without
the authority of Congress. Mr.. Burleigh said
that in the Forty-second Congress two sinecure
places in the Kittery navy yard were abolished,
and that the Secretary of the Navy, although
he knew that they were sinecure places, had
reappointed the incpmbents since that time, on
the ground that the reappointments had been
desired by influences which 1t was difficult to
withstand. Mr.. Burleigh quoted the remarks
of Mr.. Lynch of Maine, in the last Congress
upon this very subject. Mr.. Lynch then said
that the Receiver at that yard had nothing tc
do but to receive his pay, and IL was robbery to
take the money out of the Treasury for that
purpose. Mr.. Burleigh said that these sinecrre
places still remained Notwithstanding his own
protest. He said the places had been retilled
by the commandant of the yard, who had been
requested to do so by request which was
equivalent to command


Mr.. Burleigh also opposed the paragraph rel
ative to the Bureau Of Construction, and made
remarkable statement 10 regard to one Grif'
fiths, who is contractor for one of the new
sloops-of-war in process of construction at
Portsmouth.


MIR. Burleigh stated that a member of the
House Committee on Naval Affairs In the last
Congress had received letter from Grif6ths,
in which it was stated that the Chief of the
Bureau of Construction was in the habit of re-
ceiviDg presents, and that he, Griffths, had
given five or six thousand dollars TO the Chief
of the Bureau for his influence in getting the
Department to buy timber bending machine.
During the recess Mr.. BurIeigh says this let ter
has been withdrawn and another letter written,
in which the complainant represents that his
previous letter must have been written while
he was crazy. This man Griffiths, Burleigh
went on to say, had already had three extrava-
CANT contracts for completing ship now in
process of constructions. These facts, he said,
would be abundantly proved by the contracts
on file at the Kittery yard The sinecure places
at Kittery were always filled even il the yards
were closed. Mr.. Burleigh claimed, howeyer,
that this abuse was not the result of a Repub-
liean rule, because the chief incumbent of the
siuecure place had held it for twenty five years.
Mr.. Burleigh generally charged that the naval
expenditures were excessive, and he succeeded
in having adopted an amendment which pro-
vides that all the work on steam engineering
shall be done in the navy yards as far as practi-
oahle"

The coming convention derives much
where manifested in the movement by the
Catholic hierarchy and clergy of the coun-
try. Among the distinguished prelates
from whom expressions of approval and
encouragement have been received during
the past few days by the Genera! Commit
tee of the Union are Archbishop Purcell,
of Cincinnati Archbishop Lynch, of Tor

Gibbons, of Richmond, Becker, of Will
rningtop, Corrigan, of Newark, and many
Others high in the Catholic order. In
letter just received of the committee here,
sent by Archbishop Purcell, he announces
himself as practical teetotaler of at least
ten years experience, aud strongly sua-
talns the present movement. He adds:


If the Union could include in its ranks all
those who are victims of intenperance or in
danger of becoming so. it would be work
only second to the romulgation aud estab-
lishment of Christianity but while all this
cannot be hoped for, owing to human frailty,
from the thraldom of strong drink would be q
glory and triumph for the Union from month
to month or from year to year myself have
years have totally abstained frem drink,
though doing my work in the vineyard and il
causes me very little Inconvenience now.


The present strength of the Union is
nearly 500 societies, spread all over the
continent. The national officers of the
societies are composed OF the leading mem
bers of the Church.


The growth in membership has been very
remarkable during the past few years.
The following figures will show the con-
tiDued prosperity


From the first convention held at Baiti-
more, 1872, to the second convention held
at Ciev Gland in October of the same year,
there was gain of l9, 900 members. From
that to the third convention in New York,
in October, 1873, there was a gain of 20,-
600. From October 1873, to the forthcom-
ing convention, the pro rata gain will be
SC, 900 members. The following figures
will chow the increase by months since

The Commissioners of Emigration held a regular
meeting yesterday afternoon, at which were
present Commissioners Starr, Stephens, Setback,
Quiutard, Lynch Marier and Forrest. The report
OF the Treasurer OF the Board, showing that the
expenses OF the Emigration Department for the
past month were s17,516 A, was received, and
then the Board considered an application OF the
Commissioners of Charities and Correction for
permission to establish a Jerry TO Wards

it was decided that the Charity Com

tive Mullen to arrest some OF the swindiers. That
officer found TWO oil them on Monday in Canal
street, but was able to arrest but one, an Italian
named Juan Cessna. He mas been identided by sew
eral immigrants as the man who swindled them.
The Commissioners decided to provide for these
victims until Cessna can be tried and convicted.
The President OF the Board also stated that 1t has
been learned that tue German steamship cOmpa-
MES have landed steerage passengers at their
docks instead of sending them through
Castle Garden. Several infrm people have
claimed the AID of the Emigration
commissioners whose names were not on the
books at Castle Garden; and it was atterward
found That they were landed at the steamship
dock. II this practice were allowed to continue lG
would be useless to maintain the Immigrant depot,
said Mr.. Starr, and the country would be overrun
with infirm and INDECENT from all European conn
tries. 1t was proposed by one OF the Commits
siOners to direct the counsel OF the Board to
bring suit against the German steamship COM
panles but Commissioner Setback moved that they
be warned, and II in the future they put of steer
age passengers at their docks they would be pro-
oeeded against. The latter motion was adopted."

PROCEEDINGS, LAST EyENING-THE CITY HOSPITAL
Mr.. wooLLEY AND THE TREASURY AoooUSTs,
ITC., ETC.


A regular meeting Of the City Council was |
held last evening, President Naris and Council |
man Underwood alternately presiding.
Favorable reports were adopted on the follow |
ing named petitions TO pave cutters on east |
side of Van Buren above Front street, estima- |
ted cost Sl25 &; to pave cutters on east side OF
Adams, from Seventh to Eighth streets, estima- |
ted cost $3.50 of the City Solicitor on the Ord |
nance to establish fish market every Saturday |
in the old market house between Shipley and
Orange streets on the ordinance to prevent
market wagons from standing in front of the
Post Office.


The City Treasurers & and City Auditor reports
were read, showing balance in the Union
National Bank to the credit of the city of SlO3,-
1885. The Registrar of the Water Works re-
ported S211.47 collected and deposited. The
Street Commissioner reported 49 hands and II
horses and carts employed, and the Chief Engi-
neer of the Water Works reported 81 hands en-
ployed.


[For action on the City Hospital Report, see
| special heading, elsewhere.]


| Mr. Baker, from the Street Committee, report
ed in favor of rejecting all bids for paving Or
ange street. from Tenth to Twelfth, and favor
of advertising for new bids which was adopted.
| MIR. Hayes resolution which was postponed
from the last meeting providing for dispensing



3lst 1874, coming up for action, Mr.. Hayes spoke
| at considerable length in favor of its adoption.
he said $4,000 had already been paid Mr.. Woolley
in ten months and all the City Council had i'll
return was an imperfect balance sheet and a re-
port of the defacation of the late City Treasurer
Killgore covering only one year (lS7l) which he
also criticised as being imperfect. The most OF
his time was taken up in keeping the accounts
of the City Treasurer, for which duty he was not
appointed, and for which duty the City Trea-
surer is paid salary. If this latter officer is in
capable Of performing his duties, then appoint
an assistant, and either let Mr. Woolley attend
, to the legitimate duties for which he was ap-
pointed or dispense with his services and save
the enormous salary paid him.


Mr.. Adams though in part agreeing with Mr
Hayes, in the main defended Mr.. Woolley, and
said it was because the Finance Committee had
employed him that he had not completed the
work for which he was appointed. The labors
OF MIR. Woolley had been of great benefit to the
city, compared with which the $4,000 paid him
was but a small part. He had discovered
$4,000 in gold interest bearing bonds which had
been entirely lost sight Of. He had discovered
= \ deficiency in the late City Ireasurers accounts
of from $4,000 to $1,000, and had opened at
set of double entry books which onabied aaIy
person conversant with keeping accounts to see
the city's indebtedness and Treasury balances al
| a glance. He thought too that an assistant
should be appointed for the Treasurer, 80 thai
Mr.. W. could pursue and finish the work he wai
. appointed to do.


AIr. Pickels also defended Mr. Woolley and thu
= action of the Finance Committee, and hope,
/ that no interference would prevent Mr.. W. frou
d finishing his work.


Mr.. Adams moved to indefinitely postpone tn
further consideration Of the subject, upon which
N | Mr. Hayes called the Yeas and Nays, which result
II ed as follows; Yeas, Messrs Adams, Baker, W. NJ
Candy, Febiger, Foulk, Phillips, Pickels, In
: derwood and Maris, 8; Nays, Messrs. Burke

The following petitions were presented ali
referred To curb and pave both sides of Rul
2 inson street, between Spruce and Church con
II plants of the unsafe condition OF Tatnall stree
n below the railroad for city lamp on Wes


between Fourth and Fifth streets from Brandy
J., wine patrol policeman Dollard, asking Counc
IN to pay s25, half the cost of his police uniform

IL Saturday afternoon next at 5 o'clock, at Twelft
I'D and Jackson streets, to take into considerable

W Mr.. Febiger stated that unless objections WEI
m made the Water Committee would send a for
ck of hands to assist IN repairing the lower dam G
u- the Brandywine which the city by its charter WI
se bound to do or pay one-half the expense of sui
dy repairs. 1t was true that the city had

delayed about half an hour but made the trips
without accident. The snow along the line Of this

cerning the Wearing of Uniforms

The Board OF Police held protracted meeting
yesterday afterno oon. President MatseN occupied
the chair and all the members were present. After
the readi ng OF the minutes OF the last meeting and
the transaction OF some minor routine matters
Commissioner Disbecker created q sensation by
the Introduction OF the following resolution


Resolved, That the resolution amending Rule No 9,
IS e be s Is a
amended so as to read as follows-


Captains shall wear the prescribed uniform at all
citzens Clothes BY the Board or superintendent Of


serSeants, roundsmcn, patrolmen and ooormen shall
the prescribed uniform at all times when their re-
when the OFF platoon may be called duty extraor-


But ains authorized order grant leave
members OF their command to wear citizens dress on
duty, SHAH report all such cases in writing to the
superintendent.


Considerable discussion followed the introduc.
tion OF this motion, and 1t was finally referred to
the Committee on Rules and Discipline. Mr. Dur
zee moved that Commissioner Dsbecker be made
q member OF that committee, and the motion was
carried.


Commissioner Voorhis moved that Rule 33, which
had been suspended by the previous Board, be
again put into force ana q general order to that
effect issued to the department. This rule re-
lates TO the suppression OF gambling houses and
other places OF disreputabe character, and refers
10 a State law which the Board OF Police had no
authority to interfere with. Il instructs the
police to break up these dens when the knowl-
edge OF their true character IS ascertaned. The
late Board Of Police destroyed the effect Of the
rule Dy instructlng the captains to AVOID
all such houses until ordered by the Board, and
though gambling he'll should be opened directly
opposite q station house, as was the case in one
instance, the captain dared not tOuCh until the
Board ordered MIN to DO SO. Mr.. Voorhis' resolu-
tion puts the rule In ITS former place, and the
Board Will in future hold the captains responsible
for the suppression OF these places. DR.. Thomas
reported 10 the Board that Uficer Mckenzie. OF
the Thrtysecond precinct who was recently
attacked and beaten by burglars on ST. Nicholas
avenue, was unfit for outy in consequence OF the
houses selling liquor without licenses, and tnat
keep their doors open ior the sale of liquor on

superintendent of Police to deal with according to
law. strangely enough tine list contained but
very few names. Either the Excise Commissioners
have no laith in the efficacy OF the Police Depart

tics of their department are meagre on the SUBJ

covered that they were all in disguise, either
by wearing masks or with

visit; but as quick as thought he was pir-
ioned by several of the party, pointing
cooked revolyers at his head, and demandiug &

into the streets, the jaiior saw large num-

Evans, the prisoner who was taken from
Jail but a few hours before. The culprit was


suspended in such way that his feet nearly
touched the ground by the bending of the
limb, but he was dead and cold.


A corners inquest was held, in the pres


ence of a vast crowd of people, who had


gathered from all quarters. The corpse was
taken down and placed in rough box
made at the saw mill near by. and then de-
posted in the Providence graveyard.
OF course, the authorities have not the re-
motest idea as 10 who composed the lynch.
ing party; but the whole affair was well


planned and adroitly executed. One of the
J buggies evidently used by some of the
MIDNIGHT VISITORS,


broke down within a block from the Jail, by
, running of of small bridge. Doubtless a,
quick as the horses could be removed from


it the parties accompanying it fled as in the
buggy were found an old felt hat, the sleeve
, of an old coat two plugs of tobacco neatly
j wrapped in portion OF one OF the county


papers, a quart bottle with about half pint
of whisky in it, and small leather valist
: containing some heavy twine, cold chise
} and hatchet. This buggy has not been
, identified or claimed, but rumor prevails
. that it belongs to q party near Whitehall
The whole affair has created profound
: sensation, and so outrageous was the muir
? der committed by Evans that but few are
disposed to blame the parties who have ia
ken the law into their own hands. The


broken buggy is in the hands of the sheriff
/ and will probably never be claimed."

tives q month or two ago that in the Organi-
zation of their White Mans Party they had
chosen the surest means to perpetuate the
Carpet-bag and BayOnet Repubicanism to
which they traced the worst of their misfor-
tunes, we little imagined how quickly the
verification of our words would come. Hardly
is the ink dry upon the resolutions which
call upon the white men of the South to unite
for the purpose of thrusting the negro out of
politics and resuming possession of their birth
right, than the cry goes up all through the
North that the wards of the nation are again
in danger, the Ku-Klux are reviving, there
must be fresh measures of reconstruction and
new enforcement laws, and the President
must interfere once more to ""crush the re-
""belion.' Sensible men may comprehend
the cause of this sudden outcry, but it is
beyond question that it has produced great
effect. The negro, timid and excitable enough
before, sees a masked murderer in every bush.
and stands ready, with rifle cooked, to shoot
the first wayfarer he meets by night upon the
highway. Ridiculous personal quarres are
magnified by his fears until they not only
assume to his disordered vision the bgness of
civil war, but end in bloody riots which draw
into their inflamed circumference all the evil
humors and private hatreds of the neighbor-
hood. - Nor of course is the colored man the
only disturber of the peace. The South is
full of turbulent and lawless whites, and has
been full of them any time within the men,
ory of man. Belted swash-bucklers and swag-
gering regulators, full of strange oaths and
Colts revolvers, will not draw the line very
distinctly between the legitimate political OPP
position which the White Leaguers recon-
mend in public and the summary and severe
measures they are charged with practicing in
secret. To many of them lynching a nigger
or running off a Radical holder is merely
an exercise of the Southern white genteman's
erogative-sightly irregular perhaps, but on
the whole rather good thing for the COM
munity.


1t needed no great shrewdness to foresee
how the two dangerous classes of the South
would be affected by the stern division of
races which the White Mans Party proclaimed,
and how quickly the first symptom of dssen-
sion would be seized upon at the North, not
merely by political schemers but by honest
philanthropists as an argument for prolonging
the rule of the carpet-bag governments, which,
though they have plunged the South in misery
and bankruptcy, have at least protected the
colored men from wholesale persecution. Thou
sands of wavering voters, disgusted with the
corruptions of the Republican party have re-
newed their allegiance to it since the outbreak
of these disorders, and the Administration,
half minded to turn cold shoulder hereafter
to the adventurers of the Moses stamp who
have so long plundered under its protection
is almost compelled to continue its support
and yield to their demand for more troops""
In every respect the White Mans Party thus
far has been disastrous experiment; and
unless its leaders adopt at once a very differ
ent policy still graver misfortunes are proba-
bly, yet to come. The regeneration of the
South is Impossible by any process of indis-
criminate ostracism. The negroes are part
of the body polite, and q strong part. 1t is
too late to attempt their exclusion from pub
Lie affairs, and there is no hope Of q general"

NOTES AND INCIDENTS,",,"


The result as can readily be seem is a
complete triumph for the Democracy
In the First Ward, it was only the bread
and-butter inducements held out to the
poor men which elected Johnson. The
Second Ward, as usual went strongly
Democratic.


In the Third Ward, notwithstanding
the assertion of Erery Erening that our
candidate was not the strongest man we
could run, Mr.. Bickta developed u really
wonderful strength. He ran ahead Of
his ticket, and proved himself. the strong
est and most popular man in the Ward.


The Democrats in the Fourth, Sixth
and Ninth Wards, did nobly, and deserve
great credit for their efforts. In the 9th. =.
er Wards, also, our men did their whole
duty.


The result is entirely satisfactory
Last year the Republican majority in the
city was 800. This year. the Democratic
majority ranges from 80 to 800, on the
various tickets. Grow, Chapman, Grow""


In the Seventh Ward. just before the
polls closed, colored man attempted to
vote the Reform ticket, but was drag.
ged away by the black hirelings of the
Ring.


In the evening, shortly after the polls
closed crowds began to collect around
the various voting places, awaiting the
announcements of the result Market
street was lined with people, and by eight
o'clock the GAZETTE business office was
jammed with interested Democrats, who
were anxious to hear the particulars of
the victory which they had lust won.
Owing to the delay in counting out the
votes OF the Seventh and Fourth Wards,
we could not issue our extra as soon as
We desired. Two ""scallawag"" extras,
containing incomplete returns, were ia.
sued by other offices, but the GAzErrK
extra was first upon the street with full
and complete returns.


In the Americus Club rooms, a joyous
crowd OF Democrats received the news
with great joy. Councilman elect Far
rell, of the Ninth Ward, who was present
made an enthusiastic speech which was
loudly applauded


When the returns were dcfinitel,
known, band was brought out, and
followed by large crowd, serenaded

man made response returning thanks
Tor the support of friends and congratu-
lating the party on the glorious victory
achieved.


Serenades were also rendered to VIM.

shaw, OF the Seventh Ward, both of
whom responded, declaring anew their
hostility to the Ring"" which they
had partially broken up in that Ward


AT the handsome residence of August
Bickta, ESQ, N. W., corner of Fourth
ana Tatnall streets, IA number of friends
assembled early in the evening to con
gratnlate the worthy gentleman on his
triumphant election. The house was
kept open until late hour, and hosts
OF Mr.. Bickta's friends stepped In TO
wish him JOY, and partake Of his abun.
dant hospitality. With music, singing,
and dancing tho evening passed away
pleasantly TO all who were there. Mr..

but in dignitled manner,

crowded his parlors all evening.
Col. Grimshaw will contest his defeat
in the Seventh Ward, and the friends of

expose sufficient Ring frauds TO secure
him his seat.

take no further notice of it than TO see that
the proper representations are made imme-
diately to the president. This is no lawless
mob, no rabble. 1t is the uprising of the
whole people, the commercial bushes
and professional elements as well as
the laboring and industrial. The kellogg
government is without even the shadow of
power or authority, and we would be base
and pusillanimous to confess its existence
for one instant. Let our people maintain
their present attitude, and If our strength
and dignity do not secure respect and
recognition, let the rule over us be military,
pure and simple. Let us disperse at no die
tum. IL would be wrong, and foolish, and
cowardly to do so. We believe that when
President Grant knows the truth he will ap-
prove OF what we have done.


SUMMING IT ALL UP,


this has been a remarkable uprising. 1t has
been conducted with great discretion, the
leaders having kept their forces well under
control. No property rights have been
violated that were not regarded strictly
necessary. Not colored man has been
killed to my knowledge, who was not in
the ranks of the Metropolitans. No one has
been lynched. Sergt. Vankirk, OF the
police, who was once captured and released
on parole, but returned to the
Metropolitan ranks, was again cap
with the idea of hanging him to a tree in
Lafayette Square, in front of Gen. Ogden's
headquarters. The general came out and
made speech, advising that no acts of vio-
lence be committed, and that the men dis
perse to their homes. They accordingly re-
leased the sergeant, whose face was pale as a
ghost. The street cars placed across the"

When the people of the 1st District
read what Gen. (Senatorl Gordon has
said abou: the effect of Col. L. @. G.
Lamar's great speech ON Misrule in the
Southern States, they will congratulate
themselves on the wisdom of their choice
in selecting him to represent them in
Congress despite the fears of the timid
who imagined that terrible consequences
would follow the election of man of
his antecedents to the National Legisla-
ture. Col. Lamar's success has shown
how idle these apprehensions were, and
that the intelligent people of the North
above all others, are anxious to meet IN
the common Councils of the country,
genuine Representatives from the South.
Gen. Gordon says:


''By all odds the most powerful and
effective speech made in the House since
the war, and probably as remarkable an
effort as was ever made upon the floor,
was Mr.. Lamar's speech on louisiana
| never saw such a scene as the House
presented during its delivery. There
was not a member in his seat-every
member was on his feet, straining to catch
every word that fell from Lamar's lips.

carried them with him. 1t was as abso-
lutte triumph as ever saw. Lamar

short time. During the voyage across the
Atlantic the weather was very stormy, con-

preate, whose malady demanded ease and repose.
For two days during the voyage he was in such

SKETCH OF BISHOP BACON.


Bishop Bacon was born In Brooklyn In 1914 and
was known to most OF the old Catholic citizens OF
that city. he was educated for the ministry at
Mount st. Mary College, Emmettsburg Nd, and
ordained in New York BY Bishop Dubois, in the
year 1888, and was at the time OF his death the
oldest ordained Catholic Bishop In the Archdiocese
OF New York. with the exception OF the ven-
erabe Archbishop himself who has been in tho
ministry Q few years longer. He was the rrsr
regular pastor OF the Church OF the Assumption,
on the corner OF Jay and York streets, Brooklyn
and OF which Father Keegan is now pastor. Here
for many years he ministered to the largest
Catholic congregation In Brooklyn. His desire,
however, for church extension was soon gratifled
by the purchase OF site for an edifce at the lower
end Of Court street. anu BY his efforts the Church
or st. Mary Star OF the Sea was erected, on the
corner OF Luqueer and Court streets. 1t is to-day
one OF the largest and most elegant churches In
Brooklyn. The diocese OF Portland, Me-. was
created and the mitre accepted by Father Bacon
In 1866, his conservation taking place In the
Church OF the Immaculate Conception, thus estab-
fishing its nrst blsnopric. The elevation to the
prelscy, In thus removing him from the scenes OF
his rrst labors, was subject OF regret by those
who knew him best In Brooklyn, although they
knew Maine had gained worthy accession TO her
religious teachers.


his LAST MOMENTS.


the Bishop up to within few moments OF his
death, although weak and exhausted, retained his
fne intellect to o remarkable degree. Sister
Mary Francis was ceaseess IN her efforts to
alleviate the suffering Of one beloved by so many.
DR.. Wood paid visit to the dying man, but saw
that all medical aid was vain, and impaired the
Information to those around him, ard that mis- dis.
oution might be expected at any moment, The
sorr0wful intelligence was listened to by saddened
hearts, among whom were the venerable Arch
bishop McClosKey, Sister Mary Francis, Fatnel
Farrelly, the ArchDishop's secretary; the Vicar
General, Father Quinn; Bishop McNeirney, coadiu
tor Bishop OF Albany Bishop Loughnn, OF Brook
lyn; Father Keegan, OF Brooklyn, and Bishop
Lynch, OF Charleston, s. G. Shortly before ri!
death extreme JUNCTION was administered, and 81
balfpast seven O'Clock the soul OF Bishop Bacor
had gone to Him who gave 1t.


THE MTERMENT.


Last night the body was embalmed by DR.. Miller
and will be taken hence BY steamer to Portland
Me-. for interment. A pontlncal high mass Will
be held IN Portland, at which Bishop Loughlln, Of
Brooklyn; Bishop Lynch, OF Charleston; Bisnor

positively known.


With reference to Bishop McNeirney. OF Albany

For our part, we cannot see the policy OF
making people of different races citizens OF
the same Republic. The negroes of Hay ii
have, in our opinion, acted with more dis
cretion on this question than the whites of
the United States. They have, at least it
is SO aa;d, provided in their constitution
that no white man shall be citizen. This
we think right, and would have favored the
adoption of a similar principle in this coun- :
try, which would result here, however, in
making q white mans country of it and ex-
cluding colored people from citizenship.
We have heretofore given onr reasons for
this conviction and will not now repeat
them.


But it is q question which we are willing
to consider as settled for all future time,
for the reason that it will continually be
getting of less and less importance practi-
cally. The area of country now inhabited
by our ex-slaves will soon contain popu-
lation of twenty millions of white nhabi
tants, while the colored people and their
descendants will very probably be con-
stantly diminishing in number. We there
fore think that the question may be left in
allegiance until the next time.that nation
finds itself in the same position as the
South did at the end of the Confederate
war.


In the meantime the situation seems to
the numerical preponderance of the whites.
The colored people of this State have re-
Gently put forth an address which no pa
triot could read without pleasure. There is
no antagonism whatever of real interests
between the white asd colored populations
of the South. Their interests are identical,
yet through a groundless distIust of their
white fellow citizens, the colored people
have uniformly thrown themselves into the
hards of a set of hJ pocritical miscreants,
who had no use for them but as dupes and
no object in view but the plunder aud ruin
of both races.


Circumstances have of late, however,
contributed 10 weaken this tendency Of the
colored people. In the first place the resent
ment of the whites in the interior of the
State has taken a more reasonable turn.
1U5ttdu VI UldmiuB tuo noSiueS 80 uuCH
as heretofore for the prevalent ruin they
have considered that the blame really at
taches To the white rascals who lie to them
and mislead them. We can not and do not
approve of Lynch law, yet the lynching of
the five white outlaws at C""ushatta, while
the colored people were untouched, has, no
doubt, had a most beneficial effect in dissipa
=; h.Sr Than
the revolution Of September l45h in New
Orleans. This convinced them fully that
no harm was intended them and, further,
that those mighty Keloggites whom they
had looked on as demi-gods were but little
better than paste board men.


In the meantime, while their distrust of
their white friends has been wearing of. i.
they have been getting dissatisfied with
carpet baggers. The address to which we
referred above sets forth quite lucidly some
Of their grievances. They do all the voting
and get comparatively none of the perqui-
sites Of Office. Some few of them for ap-
pearauce sake are given lower seats at the
official banquet, but all the carpet baggers
are first provided for. The ex slaves, as
stup'u as 'ue iusoie""' Col pe'- -o""SSeiS euih6
them, are shrewd enough to see all this.
They feel the hypocritical meanness which
fawps on them at the polls and spurns them
in the parlor. They are dissatisfied.


The proof of this is that we now see them
making overtures to their white fellow. cit
izens, and these overtures ought to be
frankly and heartily met. This has beeu
done already in Terrebonne parish, but in
New Orleans how is it7 Because we have
q majority here, are the colored voters to
be therefore spurned This would be about
as hypocritical friendship as that of the
carpet -baggers.

carel and Beaudry. Absent-De Cells

session held August 10th were read
and approved. The minutes of last
regular meeting were also approved
after reading.


The Committee on Lands reported
favorably upon the petition of John
Deverede, as referred at last meeting.
By permission, Mr.. Mcpherson APP
peared on behalf of p. Bellard to pro-
test against the adoption of the report;
requesting that the matter be laid on
the table for one week to allow fur
ther examination on his part. On mo-
ton the report was laid on the table
according to request.


The Finance Committee reported ad-
versely to the petition of E. E. Hew-
lit, special agent of the Southern Pa
cific Railroad referred at last meeting,
wherein the company requested re-
turn of the 750 shares of railroad
stock held by the city, which delivery
was provided for in their contract.

asked for certified copy of the action

tee to examine the town clock, and

tion as when new for the sum of sew
enty-fve dollars; also offering to keep
it in repair and to regulate it by
transit observations, for twelve
months for the consideration of tif-
teen dollars per month. Mr. Dock
weller favored the removal of the
town clock entirely to the copula of
the High School building. Mr. Mas
carel stated that the clock is the prop
erty of the county, and cannot be re-
moved on the authority of the city.
t. ha
clock is the property of the county it
county. Mr.. Beaudry thought that if
the county is willing to furnish the
clock free of cost to the city, as our
citizens are most benefited by it, the
! city should willingly pay the expense
of keeping it in repair. Mr.. Gerkens
moved that the proposition of Messrs.
Fisher & Thatcher be accepted for re-
pairing the clock, and that they be
allowed ten dollars per month, for
the term of one year, to keep it in re-
pair and regulate it. Amended to
make the monthly compensation
$l2 so. Carried, as amended.

that he would not have to work SO hard

Murder in Talbot County, Md.


On Saturday night last named Whit
man accompanied by his wife, while returning to
their home from store, near Song Woods Tai
bot CO., Nd, were followed by two negro men,
named Geo Wheeler and Wm. Hines. When the
negroes overlook Whitman the one named
Wheeler struck him violent blow over the head
with heavy piece o. carriage shaft, knocking
him senseless to the ground. The black fend
then turned upon Mrs. Whitman and struck
her also with the shaft breaking her skull and
killing her almost instantly Mr. Whitman, in
a short time, returned to consciousness and went
back to the store and told what had been done
A number of persons went to the place and found
the woman lying dead upon the ground. They
then went in search of the murderers, and on the
next morning, the negro, Wheeler, was found
behind the barn of DR.. Neal with his throat bad
~, though not fatally cut. He had tried to
commit suicide He confessed that he had kill
cd the woman, and implicated the other negro,
Hines, rs his assistant.


The excited people could scarcely be prevented
from lynchng the villains. They were lodged
in jail.


The negro, Wheeler, is said to be desperate
character, having already served two terms in
the penitentiary. The reason for this brutal
murder was stated in letter to the Baltimore
Sun as follows :-ssIt seems that both George
Wheeler, negro, and Mrs. Margaret Whitman,
white woman, have been in the employ of Dr.
Neal One day last week, during busy season,
Wheeler quit work on the plea of sickness. Mrs.
Whitman, who passes the house of Wheeler in
going from her house to DIR. Neal's saw Whee-
Ter at work in his garden and reported the fact
to the doctor. By some means Wheeler learned
that Mrs. Whitman had informed upon him and
vowed vengeance""


The Agricultural Association.


The regular quarterly meeting of the PENN
sular Agricultural Association, to be held to-day,
will be the most important meeting since the
organization, as the report of the several Com
mttees will be heard, and the time of holding
the Exhibition fixed. The Oxford fair will be
held Sept 3Oth Oct. lst, and End. The Chester
County Fair, at Westchester, Oct. 7th, 9th, and
9th, and, doubtless, will be well attended, as
those associations are in flourishing condition
The exhibition here will doubtless attract very
many persons, particularly from the South and
East, and it becomes our farmers to endeavor to
make our Fair second to none. The grounds
are rapidly approaching the appearance of a
first class Fair Ground, and we learn from the
committee that nothing will be omitted, if possi-
Bile, that will add to the comfort of visitors and
everything that will render it pleasant, as well
as profitable to exhibitors, will be DONE Certain
ly this place, being easy of access from all parts
of the Peninsula by rail, and in central posi-
tion as regards location, should be able to make
such display of products, grain, fruit and
stock Of all kinds, as to properly exhibit the
productiveness of our soil, and the thrift of our
people. Actuated by such feelings, there can be

From present prospects, there will be an ami
mated contest in nearly every ward of the city,

eral disposition not to complicate State issues
with local differences to city affairs will have
the effect OF making the result no indication Of
the vote in November. No one doubts that there
is large Republican majority in the city, but
the several phases which the contest for MEM
bers Of Council has assumed prevent strict
party test, and even the vote for Assessors will
| hardly be fair standard for Judgment.
ELECTION RuMoRs AND FALsEHooD,


The usual crop of election cdnards has been
sprngng up, within few days. Among them was
one, issued in the Republican OF SAT lrday, to
the effect that the friends of Messis Candy and
| Grimshaw, in the Seventh Ward had agreed with
the Democrats that those gentlemen, when elect
ed to Council, should ""yote on all party ques-
items, especially in eecting all the City officers,
| with the Democrats We ARE able to state that
this is a lie out of the whcle cloth, there being
no such agreement whatever. The Citizens
| Reform ticket for Council in the Seventh Ward
will receive Democratic support simply because
it is considered ''anti Ring. 1t ia true, how
ever, that committee Of three persons, whose
names we have, all being supporters OF Phillips
and Lichtenstein, went o Thos. ]. Bowen, the
| Democratic candidate for Assessor. on Friday
| evening"" and besought linn to use his influence
| to have Democrats vote for Phillips and Lichten-
stein, promising. if he wonid do that, to give
| him all the Republican votes they could control
in the 9th and 9Th wards. thus ""selling out"" Pro-
vost, the Republican candidate for Assessor. An

on the previous evening by one Of the same

Alexander B. Cooper Esq, from the Commit
tee on Resolutions reported the following:
The Democratic party of New Castle county
pledges itself to the maintanance OF the follow
ing principles:


2. The right of the States to administer their
government in their own way, subject only to
the Limitations imposed by the Federal Constitu
ton, strictly constructed in favor OF the Rights
of the States.


2. A tariff for revenue only
3. An irredeemable currency is the fruitful
parent of public and private extravaganza and
dishonesty, and should be remeded at once by
wise legislation.


| 4. The repeal of the tax imposed by the United
States on the circulation of the State banks.
| 5. Such amendments to the costition of our
| State shall provide for increased representa-
| ton of this county in the Lower House of the
General Assembly, and. the election of Represen-
tatives and members of the Levy Court by dis
| tricts.


G. Economy and honesty in the administration
of the General and State Governments.


I. We believe in the superiority of the white
race, and regard any attempt to effect social
| equality by Legislative or other coercive meas
ures as fraught with danger to our institutions,
and to the best interests of both races.


The policy of the Civil Rights Bill seeks to in
wade the sanctity of our homes aud to inject dis
cord Into our churches and schools. II passed,
it will subvert the right of the State to regulate
the domestic life of her citizens, and will, i'm
properly legalize condition of things repngnant
TO The natural laws of God. We pledge our
selves to oppose in every way the aiders, sup
porters and advocates of the measure.
S. We do farther take occasion to express our
sincere and hearty approval of the course of the
Hons. Thomas F. Bayard and Eli salisbury, in
the Senate of the United States. Whilst by the
faithful discharge of duty they have earned our
commendation, by their great ability and chival-
rous bearing, they have excited our highest ad-
miration

be struck out Mr. Vim. Dean then suggested


that the resolutions he read and adopted Scriutin,

resolution because he didn't believe in asking


Congress to undo what they had done illegally:


that they had no right to pass law taxing

Mr.. Dean favored the resolution in q long
+ speech showing up the advantages of state banks
i with plenty Of currency over national banks


with limited currency, etc.
John 0 Byrne Esq. also favored the resolu-

| timid conservatives, who then now wero ready
for any sacrifice of principle for the sake of
harmony and to save tho party-tho only effect was
to arouse profound indignation at the inhumanity
| and brutality Of the fugitive slave act.


The hostility of the North to the Fugitive Slave
law had been anticipated in some measure but it
was not believed either that it would be enforced in
so aggressive and offensive manner on our side, or
opposed SO vehementy and to such extreme lengths
on the other, as afterward appeared. In
the discussions which preceded its passage it had
been violently assailed unconstitutional In some
of its provisions and President Fillmore was care
full to take the precauOn, before signing it, of pro-
curing from the Attorney-GeDeral written opinion
in favor Of its constitutionality In this opinion
his own judgment concerned No one ever doubted
slr. Fllmore's peority of motives, that he fol-
lowed his conscientious convictions of duty in sing
lug the fugitive slave bill. But it cost him personal
popularity and his administration tho
confidence of the people and no doubt
was largely the of the overwhelming defeat of
the Wing pacty in 1852 and its disappearance as a
political organization shortly afterward. Being
sincere in his suppart of the Compromise measures,
and honestly believing that the differences between
the two sections could be amcably and honorably
adjusted by carrying ont the provisions of the COM
promise he endeavOred, by tho use of such force as
was at the command of the Government, TO COM
pei acquiescence at least if not cooperation
on tho part Of the North, in the enforce
ment of the odious Fugitive Slave law
Resistance having been made TO the execution OF the
law in Boston, Syracuse, Christiana Ponn and SOW
era other places, tho President by proclamation of
Feb 49, 1851 announced his purpose to enforce it, and
called upon woll-disposed citizens to sustain him.
IN ia fnllOWuu
of the Senate calling for information, he sent to
that body special message communicating these
facts. and repeating his determination to execute
faithfully the laws. and suppress all forcbe oppo-
sitIOn to them.


The weakness of the craftsmanship Of that period
the closing hours of tho old Wing party-was IN
its failure to comprehend tho absolute incompat-
blty of the two systems or labor and the impossible
ity of ever adjusting any terms upon which tho two
could exist together. The efforts of tho great po-
ltcal leaders of the term, and all the resources OF
craftsmanship were directed to devising plans OF
rocOncling the two and compromising the
constantly recurring collisions between the
two sections growing out of Slavery. Mr..
Fillmore of naturally conservative
temper and all his training, associations, and habits
of thought led him into sympathy with the great
body of conservatives in lis party, and into hos


tile relation to that class whose convictionsupon the
subject of Slavery were more intense, and who were
frat then beginning an aggressive uncompromislng
war upon the institution itself The attempt to
execute the Fugitive Slave law wdened tho breach
between the two elements in the party, and Mr..
FilnOre's well meant efforts to consolidate the
party upon what he deemed a measure OF fair
ard honorable adjustment, and to preserve the
Union by restoring peace between the warning ana
discordant sections, resulted only in weakening
and eventually disintegratlng the party aud in
tensifying at the North the hostility TO
Slavery which few years later, under the stress of
new encroachments by the slave power crystaized
in the political organization which came into posses
sion of the Government in 1860 and put an end to
the whole monstrous system.


The adoption of the compromise measures OF looO
and the subsequent attempts to enfore the Fugitive
Slave law were the chief features of Mr.. FilmOres
administration Events have shown how utterly
futile were these endeayors to reconcile the two
systems of free and slave labor The compromise
of 1850 embodying the wisest and most sagacious
craftsmanship of the political period which claimed
Clay and Webster as shining lights, was not
only fatal to the party which adopted it,
but was the means of embittering the con-
iict it was intended to allay, and OF
Fastening the final attempt at separation and resort
to arms. With that the period of compromises
passed; the game between the two systems was
from that time forward life and death struggle. 1t
was Mr.. Fillmore's administration that made
the last great effort to avert rupture and go ON
peaceably Whatever may have been the errors OF
that policy it cannot be denied that its authors
were sincere and that in all their acts they
evinced patriotic purpose. No other
measure of Mr.. Fillmorc's Administration
was especially unpopular Many of his recon-
hot
branches having an opposition majority. Having
learned that an attempt to be made to in
wade Cuba by lawless citizens of tho United
States he promptly on the 18th OF April,
1851 issued proclamation warning them OF the
consequences and enjOining upon the law officers OF
the Government the duty Of arresting and holding
for trial all persons engaged. BY the cOnniyance
of the Collector of the Port of New-Oreans
the Lopez expedition did sail from that port ON the
ith of August. Those engaged IN it were captured,
and some of them executed. The Collector OF the
Port was removed, and the steamer IN
which the expedition set out was seized and
condemned for violation of the Neutrality
laws The foreign policy of Mr.. Filmores Admin
istration was dignifed and selfrespecting and by
the character of its representatives abroad, as well
as by its manly Independence, did much to give the
Government position and influence with other ma
tions.


There were many other admirable features in his
Administration not the least among them being the
countenance he gave to important exploring exped-
tions such as that of Commodore Perry to Japan,
that to the La Plata River; Lynchs exploration Of
the Dead Sea; Ringgolds expedition to the Chinese
Sea; and Herndon and Gibbons to the Amazon.


After the expiration of his term of office, March A.

AS fair journal, 1 am sure you will allow
your patrons to discuss both sides of the ques-
tion, if the writer does not unnecessarily take
up your space. Assuming that this is the case,
I desire to notice briefly an article in your last
weekly on the proposed execution of Wagner,
several statements in which 1 think are mere
assumptions, without particle of proof to sus-
tain them and calculated to convey an erron-
eous impression.


In the first place, do not understand that
the people, through their representatives, de-
cided against capital punishment at the last
session of the Legislature. The effort, stren-
uous and persevering, which was made to
sweep the law of capital punishment from the
statute book was voted down. The Talbot bill,
to establish that law on more sure and def
mite foundation, it is true shared the same fate,
leaving the matter just where it was before.
Whether majority of the people are in favor
of, or against this law, is not and cannot be
known, unless the law be referred to them for a
direct vote, inasmuch as no representatives
have as yet been chosen on any issue of this
kind.


Again, the statement that protection to
prison officers was the sole reason for re-
tanning the law as It is, is wholly an assump-
tion. l cannot believe that the atrociouS mur-
ders, the heartrendng butcheries of men and
women which have been enacted in this state
within the last two or three years, and the evil
dent necessity, the imperative duty of setting
up the strongest possible bulwark against the
repetition of such deeds, had no influence in
producing this result. And here let me ask,
what is the strongest possible bulwark against
rutfianism and murder? Mark the admission
OF the writer in the article referred to. 'sThe
shadow OF the gallows,"" be says. twas left to
fall in terrorem on such bloodthirsty prisoners
as might have miud to destroy their keep
ersp' This is an evident admission that the re-
straining power of the ""gallows' far exceeds
that of any other punishment. And what can
did mind can doubt that this penalty is the
only one having any considerable terror in it to
restrain desperadoes aud protect human life.


The lull in the commission of murders the
present year, referred to, if it has any assign
able cause, points far more evidently, think,
to the summary execution by lynch law, of that
murderer who killed the sheriff and another
man, and expressed the wish that he had mur-
dered two more; and perhaps, also, to that
shadow of the gallows"" which still fits before
the eyes of the lawless, than to any shock the
law had received the past year.


That the Governor is in duty bound to wait
for the action of another Legislature, before ex-
ecutIng the law on any of the murderers now
awaiting their ifate in prison, seems to me ut
terly groundless and absurd. The Legislature,
after special recommendation by the executive,
failed to render the law any more definite and
binding. What has he to do then but to exc
cute 1T as it is, according to his understanding
of its spirit and intention?


And is there anything in the case of Wagner
to commend him to the sympathy and clemen
cy of the executive? The negro Harris was ex-
ecuted for the murder, or for aiding in the
murder of two defenceless women. Was the
crime of Wagner any less appalling or afro
it stands With a vote of five councillors Of the
seven, we see not lhow the Governor can we'll
avoid executing it; and if the people are op-
posed to the law, let them speak out clearly
and strongly through their representatives, who
should, indeed, be chosen with some reference
to this question; or, better still, let the LIE gs-
la.ure refer this law to direct vote of the
people. ANTI-TRIsTAM."

KNOWN PARTY WHO ESCAPES.


The particulars in horrible tragedy, enacted
iu our sister state of Maryland so long ago
last Thursday have just come to light. The
facts in the case seem to be as follows


At an early hour on the morning named Will
liam q. 18 years old, son Of Rector Humphrey,
farmer in Prince Georges county went out into
the meadow to catch his horse, the meadow be-
ing only about five hundred yards from the
dwelling. Not returning during the day, great
anxiety was felt for him. and the next morning
a search was instituted.


Finally about IL o'clock, the missing young
man was found lying in a corner of the meadow,
still alive, though quite insensible. He was then
removed to the house and med
ical aid summoned, and although the skull was
fractured in several pieces and the brain oozed
out the young man lived until Saturday when he
died.


How young Humphrey met his death is not
knewn A club, bloody and with matter, hair
and brains upon it, indicate that with this lie was
dispatched, but in whose hands, or for what
purpose is not known. He is not
known to have had any enemies.
The most common theory is that he had ordered
tramp (the country is full of them) from the
premises, and on his refusal to go scufile en-
sued which resulted as above. Pumphrey did
not recover sufficiently to give an account OF the
affair


There is a great excitement on the subject
among the citizens of the neighborhood, and
should the murderer be caught it will require
some care upon the part of the authorities to
prevent the people from visiting the miscreant
with lynch law."

plain; the ducks are allowed every day and
every night in which to feed on the flats;
and on regular ducking days, as soon as
the duckers make their appearance, the
ducks leave and go to forbidden waters
and there stay, as a general thing, during
the day. When we take into consideration
the limited space in which they are allowed
to gun, the limited time in which they are
allowed to do it, and the amount of money
which they have to pay for the privilege,
We think it very unreasonable law and
deserving the attention of the next session

repeal.


Quite number of the friends Of the Rev.
George r. Kramer, preacher in charge of
Charlestown Circuit, visited the parsonage
on Thursday, the 18th instant, taking with
them as donations to the Reverend gentle.
man and his good lady, flour, coffee, sugar,
butter, chickens, jellies, preserves, corn,
hay, wood, &C., in abundance. Having
come with the intention of breaking bread
with him, the ladies took immediate posses
sion of the parsonage, which was surren-
dered without a murmur, or evon an at
tempt at resistance; and in very short
time table was spread, which proved that
the ladies present understood the business
of getting up good meal, aud we think
the gentlemen present will bear with US in
this assertion, for the way the rich viands
before Mr.. D. T., Mr.. J. B. G.,
Mr.. G. w. S. and others we might name,
was something astonishing. A short time
after the assembling Of the party, young
lady member of the Charlestown NJ. E.
Church. in neat little speech, presented
to the preacher small purse of money,
which she said ""she had collected from
among his friends of Charlestown, as an
evidence of their high appreciation of him as
a gentleman and christian"" Mr.. Kramer
in reply, expressed his heart felt thanks for
the donation. After little conversation
among friends and pastor, and the singing
a few pieces, reading chapter from the
Bible and prayer by the pastor, the COM
pany departed for their homes amid the
thanks of the preacher and bis amiable
lady. Mr.. Kramer was originally a Mary
lander, but latterly of the M. E. Confer
ence South, stationed at different appoint
ments in the State of Georgia, marrying a
lady of that State. He withdrew from the
church South, and was in Washington
City when the vacancy occurred on this
Circuit by the resignation of Rev. Joseph
Cook, and through the course of Provi-
dence, Mr.. Kramer was appointed to fill
the vacancy. Had he proven all inferior
preacher, the Circuit would have had to
put up with him for a couple of years, at
least; but as it has proven to the contrary,
and he is highly esteemed, not only as an
able preacher, but as christian and gen
tleman, efforts are being made by ap-
pointments which perhaps may have more
in this Conference than has this
1t is hoped that justice be will dealt out.

The ceremony took place at the Broad St.
M. E. Church, corner Of Broad and Arch
Sts, on Wednesday evening, 18th inst !.
before large and fashionable assembly,
composed Of relatives, friends, and the
elite Of West Philadelphia. The church
was brilliantly lighted, showing to advan-
tage the varied costumes o. the fair sex.
among whom, your correspondent noticed
some faces familiar in the Capital and
other portions Of your State. The bridal
party was quite punctual, arriving shortly
after P. N. (the hour 6xed for the cer-
emony) They proceeded up the aisle in
the following order First, the four ush-
ers, two and two; next the three brides
maids with their attending groomsmen ;
then the groom and the brides mother ;
finally the bride leaning upon the arm Of
her father The party arranged themselves
fronting the minister, Grew. j. Walker
jackson, and the ceremony commenced.
The answers of the groom we're clear and
distinct, those of the bride being at times
quite inaudible. She was attirod in a
very handsome white satin dress without
trimmings. large train, veil and the
usual bridal wreath of orange blossoms.
The bridesmaids were arraycd in white
silk and tarletons, tastefully trimmed with
flowers. After the benediction had been
pronounced the entire party proceeded
down the aisle to the strains Of ''Mendel-
sohn's Wedding March,"" and the large
audience slowly dispersed, being much
pleased with the sight they had witnessed


A reception was held at the house Of
the brides parents, No. 3442 Chestnut
ST., West Phila, from 9 until II p. NJ,
at which large and select company were
present, and congratulations we're poured
in from all sides, upon the happy couple
The bridal presents, consisting mostly o.
silver, were numerous and valuable, occu
pying large space devoted for that pur
pose in an upper room. The display o
flowers was in short, magnificent. A
long description might be given of tht
decorations beautiful to behold, and filling
the house with sweet ordors, that one
might almost imagine he was roaming
through some garden in the month o
June. One large pyramid in particular
was beautifully arranged. 1t stood in th
centre of table its point almost reaching
the ceiling. Upon close examinati !
this pyramid was found to be composed o
moss baskets filed with cut flowers ant
boquets, which. later in the evening, wer
distributed amongst the guests. The en-

sessments for Main street sewer had
been paid by property-owners. Mr..
Beaudry moved that resolution be
drafted providing for the collection of
assessments by the City Marshal, CIV
ing him therefor commission OF one
per cent. Carried.


BY permission Mr.. Riley addressed
the Council representing the great
necessity for the immediate building
of that section of sewer between Ar
cadia and Commercial street, asking
if that portion could be built, provid-
ed the assessments therefor be paid at
once. A lengthy debate ensued, in
which Mr.. Mascarel stated that an
error had been made in making plans
for sewer, and portion of the proper
ty lying on the east side of Main below
Commercial cannot be drained by it.
Mr.. Beaudry thought that the neces-
sary steps had been taken for the
building of sewer, and all that re-
m aims to be done is to collect assess
ments at once and proceed to built it.


On motion the City Clerk was au-
thoriZed to issue warrants for the
amounts issued against property
owners for Main street sewer. Mr..
Beaudry moved that separate fund
be created to be known as the Main

A correspondent of the New York
Evening Post, in letter from Healing
Springs, Va, writes as follows: Last
Sunday assisted at baptismal meet.
ing conducted by ""Yaller Moses"" at
the pool on Jacksons river, in front of
the ""Oak Swamp Meetin'- House.""
Moses is what one might call a sensa-
tion preacher. He can read, but other
wise is totally uneducated, and speaks
in the broadcast negro dialect. On this
occasion there were only four candi-
dates for baptism-three women and
one man, Zeb Jenkins. Jenkins had
long been looked upon as hardened
sinner. He was born and raised in Din
widdie, was brought up by a gentleman
from Lynchburg, and has for the last
ten years gained a precarious hveli-
hood by working around here and there
for the farmers in the upper valley of
the Jackson river He is between fifty
and sixty years of age. There was
sermon before the baptism. Moses is
very fond of showing his knowledge of
the holy book, which he always quotes,
verse, chapter and page. He apparent
ly thinks this gives him importance in
the eyes of the simple people whom he
addresses. His sermon on the Sunday
in question was so remarkable as to
make me take short notes of it, which
1 here give: Belubbed breddern and
sisters, / take my text dis day from de
gospel of st. Matthew, chapter nine
teen, verse twenty. four. 1T is easier
for camel to go through de eye of ""a
needle than for rich man to enter into
de kingdom of God Likewise, also
from de gospel of st. John, chapter
fifth, verse twenty-nine 'Sarch ye de
scriptures 1 often hear de cullud
man complain of his hard lot in dis
life; he say he do nothin' but
hoe corn, split wood, and plant
potatoes, while de white folks
dress up fine, and ride round de
country on horseback smokin' Lone
Jack tobacco. You, Bill Flanders, who's
sittin' thar on de second bench, wild yer

A corrssnoDdeut Of the Lynchburg, Va, Re
,.,.bl,1,,. writing from Chatham, Pittsylvania
-copntv. March 25, gives tho following de-
tofls Of one of the most deliberate brutal and
horrible tragedies which has ever occurred In
that section of the country: ''The people of
this usually quiet village were thrown into con-
siderable excitement yesterday by suspicion be-
ing aroused OF foul play having been used about
negro named Albert Barksdsle, who has been
missing about three weeks. .Itseens that Al
bert receiveda a summons on the night Of his
disappearance to visit his sick mother, who re-
sides in Halifax county. The man who brought
him the message was negro by the name OF
Joe Clarke, who has for q long tine oeen on
very intimate terms with Barksdale's wife. He
told him that he had just meta man from
Halifax, who had been sent In great haste to
summons him to visit the BEDSIDE oil his dying
mother; that the messenger, beingVery tired,
had stoned at a barn about two miles distant,
and asked him to come and bring him (Barks-
dale) to him.


Barksdale and Clarke immediately departed
for the barn to see the messenger, and that was
the last seen of him until this morning, when
one of the most horrible sights ever witnessed,
in the shape of human brutality, was presented
in the form of Barksdale's body, buried in
mud hole, with his head manglsd into = perfect
Jelly. Suspicion was aroused on yesterday by
his wife stating that she had received a letter
from him, and that he was Gtwork for Mr..
Hart, at Clover depot, on Their. & d. railroad;
but Clarke had returned the next morning
after the disappearance, and told it around
that Rarksdale had asked himto do his work
while he was gone, and he accordingly made
BarksdsIe's house his home,. staying there
every night.


Some of the negroes who knew the relations
existing between Clark and Barksdale's wife,
not being satisfied that ell was right, tele-
Rrsphed TO Mr.. Hart, at Clover. depot, to know
ifBarksdale wGs there, when he Immediately
replied that he was not, and had not been about
there. Clark was, after consultation among
the authorities and citizens, then arrested as
being the murderer of Bskksdale; but he stoutly





then interviewed, making several conflicting
statements. Among other things she said she
had washed some clothes for Clark, all stained
with blood; said she had not received letter
from Barksdale, and such other things as led
the officers to believe that she knew all about
it, and they also arrested her as an accompliee
in the crime. They were both confined in the
Jail last night to await further, developments
this morning.


By this time the whole village was thorough
"" aroused to the highest state ,of excitement,
and early this morning large party of officers
and citizens started in search of the body Of
Barksdale, dead or alive. About eleven o'clock
the news came to the village that the body had
been found, when the whole town, with one in |
stinct rushed out in the widest state Of excite
ment to where it was reported the body was |
found. On reaching the place designated, it |
proved to be spot rarely if ever hequeDted by |
the citizens of the neighborhood, ION branch |
which was thickly overgrown with bushes and
briars, and it was almost impossible to pene-
trste into the spot. 1t seems he had tried to
dig grave few yards higher up the branch,
which he failed to cover up, and then dug an
other, apparently round hole, into which he |
threw the head of the body, and then dug out |
q trench for the feet, which were only about |
two inches under the ground.


By this time there had assembled about five |
hundred negroes, who expressed themselves as |
highly indignant at the brutality Of the murder,
and spoke of lynching both Clark and the wo- |
man. A jury Of inquest was summoned, and |
the body dug out and examined, when, to use |
the words of the doctor who examined It, 1t was |
the worst mashed uphead he ever saw. He was |
knocked down frstswith stone and then hit on |
the back of the head with an ak. The body pre- |
sented truly horrible sight. 1t was placed in |
q wagon and driven to the jail, where the pris-
oners were allowed to view it through the bars
It was then placed in the basement of the court
house, decently shrouded, placed il. a plain
coffin, aEd exposed to the view of the curious |
hundreds


In the evening an immense crowd, of white |
and colored citizens, Assembled to hear the |
funeral discourse, which was delivered By col |
ored minister He ,counseled his colored |
brethren to Let the law take its own course; said
he was better prepared to preach the funeralofl
the assassin Oh the gallows than that of the
deceased; he said the law of both God and mani
had been violated, and the criminal must meet
his just doom on the scafTold.. This somewhat
Hliayed the excitement for while. But inthe
meantime Clark, who had stoutly declared his
innocence, asked to have al interview with the
murdered mans wife. he was accordingly con-
Quoted TO her cell-when he kissed her and said |
he hoped she would meet him in, heaven. He
then confessed TO the brutal murder; said he
was alone connected with the deed; that he |
killed him about three-quarters of o mile from
where he concealed the body. but that he did it |
in selfdefence. The colored population are
clzmorous for his execution. They say he
should be tied to the stake and burned.


About the time of the confession another
negro came up, whom it was known was too
intimate with another mans wife. There was
strong talk of visiting summary vengeance
upon him. He was finally let of, and given
twelve hours to leave the place. The negroes
declare their intention of driving all such char
acters from the village. In this action they are
encouraged by all the white citizens of the
place.


Barksdsle has the character of being one of
the best negroes in the county, while Clark is
one of the nost notorious rogues and gamblers
to be found In the Stete of Virginia.

by several gentlemen of unmentiona-

bruised and battered by them, his
money and valuables were stolen by
some of their female confederates.

sion OF sorrow that evinced In this city to-day
over the death and funeral rites of her honored
citizen, patriot and gallant soldier Of two wars
Major General John G. Foster. The morning
dawned ioggy and heavy, but menowed into au-
tumnal splendor, while the populace seemed sub
dued in thought and mindful that one was being
consigned to mother earth who had performed his
duty to his country wisely and well. The mills nd
workshops, stores and ofices were closed, and the
citizens and citizen soldiers OF Nashua and Vicinity
wed with one another In paying the last sad trlb-
ute of respect to a son of New Hampshire who has
honored her Oh many fields Of carnage, and whose
name Is q household word with her children.

lace oil the dead, which, although emaciated by
disease, bore the soldierly impress 1t was won't to
bear In life. the arrangements at the house were
under the direction OF Captain solomon Spalding.
y The City 6ags were at haf-mast, minute guns

the bells in the city were toled. The corteQe re-
ceived the remains at his mothers residence and

mourning, VIA orange, Concord Main, East Pearl
and Temple streets. where the body was placed In

Last Saturday night TINS usually quiet city was
the theatre Of one OF the mos: tragic occurrences
that has ever taken place in the limits o: the State
1t threw the community into state of the widest
excitement and even now an unsettled feeling
prevails


About seven O'Clock Saturday evening Captain
A. Butler, agent Of the South Carolina Railroad
got OF q street car with his wife, at corner ON
one OF the principal streets. muatto named
Michael Murrel jostled against the lady, and was
expostuated with by Captain Butler who tnen
turned to walk on, with his wife By his side AS he
started Murrel deliberately


POINTED PISTOL


at him and fired. The ball struck Captain Butler
over the lett eye and he iell bleeding profuse,y.
He was carried to his residence, near by and died
about four hours afterwards


As soon Michael Murrel fred the shot he
jumped from the platform OF the street car and
endeavored to escape. county constable, how
ever who was standing by him on the car and
saw him shoot Captain Butler, threw his arms
around him al and & ns!d , him until two policemen
Murrel, brother OF Michael, who was on the car
when the shooting was done, ran across the street,
out was halted Oy policeman, who shot him In
the mouth, wounding him slightly. Both men
were hurried 70 the Ruardhouse, but a rumor
beng In circulation that Iorce was being organ.
LYNCHING THE MURDERER
the Chief OF Police deemed 1t best to send the
prisoners to jail, where they were lncarcerated in
separate cells. The excitement In the city over
the unprovoked murder ragged high, andil was
soon evident that the murderer would meet with
summary punishment. Stern and determined men
met In council, and at eleven O'Clock about 800 Of
them, armed with Springfield rines and oayonets
marched to the Jail and demanded admlttance
The jailer was without guard and therefore, was
compelled TO obey the demand: The gate was
into the building. seized Gabriel MurreL who al
nrst was supposed to be the murderer ana carried
""HanQ him hang MIN ~ halted under lamppost
aud prepared TO launch the mulatto INTO eternity.
The latter cool and collected, protested his i.
nOcence and SAID, Gentlemen, you have


THE WRONG MANI


His fate, however, would have been soon sealed
but Tor the efforts or a few men who persuaded the
crowd to wait until the guilt OF the accused had
been positively ascertalned. Mlcnael Murre, the
real murderer, was then taken from jail, and the
two brothers were hurried to lonely spot just
outside the city limits. jury was organized and
a formal trial entered into. About one O'Clock the
Jury decided that GABRIEL was the guilty party and
SO stated. The crowu, however. cried ''Hang them
botn Hang them both !"" and this would most GER
tainly have been done but for the efforts OF o
number OF armed men VINO formed line across
the road and threatened to bayonet any one who
should attempt to advance upon the prisoner.
This enraged the excited crowd 70 such an extent
tnat many called out ""TurR the negroes
loose and hang the committee"" number
of similar threats were uttered fast and thick.
Apprehensve that rush would be made, the
committee or jury sent Michael Murrell under
escort and by circuitous route, back to jail and
retained Gabriel who had been adjudged guilty.
Gabriel was then notified that he had but fifteen
minutes to live. He was still perfectly collected





that his body be turned over to his family
and expressed some other wishes In regard 70 the
disposition OF his affairs. In the meantime, how
ever. q gentleman who was not satisfied with the

Lynch, formerly connected with The San Diego World, has lately interviewed Col. T. A. Scott and given the result of it to The St. Louis Repub- lican, and it amounts to about this: The company intend to relinquish the land grant of the Atlantic and Pacific road from its junction with the Texas and Pa cific, which will be made at point east of Double mountain in Texas; it was sheer nonsense that the company intend to abandon San Diego or take central route through Arizona, but would keep all promises with San Diego and adhere to the 32d parallel through this Territory.

 A recent letter from a member of the Texas and Pacific company to gentleman D in Fort Worth, says the company has re- ceived an offer to take S2, 2,250,000 of its first mortgage bonds which will be ac- cepted and work on the road at once com menced. A Dallas, Texas, dispatch com firms the news of said letter.

 Col Scott is reported by MT. Lynch as saying the company expected aid from Congress and that it would be granted at the next session. There is surely light nearer ahead than has seemed to be since last September Commerce needs the load and its contraction will not be de- layed many years, and within two or three, we may expect It will advance far enough to materially benefit us who are right in , the line of its determined route"

freely when the comforting announcement
was flashed across the wires that ""Bowley
"" and Jones, the radical negroes, whose rivalry
caused the Georgetown riot, had signed an
""agreement declaring that no impediment to
""their cordial friendship remained"" Pre-
sumng of course that this covenant of recon-
ciliation would be ntrusted to the custody of
some mutual friend competent to enforce its
observance, even if it cost $1,000 to do 1t, we
felt that all danger of war OF races was
over. But the sense of security was OF short
duration. Though BOwley and Jones are dis
posed of, Ben Ballard remains. Ben Ballard
has made a terrible cOmmotion in Tennessee,
spreading the widest excitement through the
western part of the State, and causing the
white men generally to look after their rifles
Ballard confessed to an organized negro con-
spiracy. 1t originated in a dispute about
fifty cents, and in the course of five weeks
grew to such dimensions that nothing would
satisfy the cOnspiratOrs but the extirpation OF
the whites and the seizure Of their lands. A
great many details of the plot were given,
which are not worth repeating, but it appeared
that the negroes professed to believe first
that they were menaced with a revival of the
Ku-Klux, and secondly that Gen. Grant
would back them in asserting their rights
The result was the arrest of sixteen negroes
by a Marshals posse, and the horrible lynch
ing of which we have already published the
particulars.


Now we have no faith in the existence of
this so-called conspiracy, and we look upon a
war of races as practically out of the question
There has been no riot or violence anywhere
which decent local government ought not to
have suppressed in half an hour. Neverthe-
less we do regard the situation at the South
as full of peril. The danger is not from the
turbulence of the negroes but from the reck-
lessness and folly of the whites. Every little
disturbance is followed either by mastering
of regulators or call for Federal troops. The
white citizens seem to have no confidence in
the officers of the law, and no disposition to
strengthen their hands by the regular methods
which the law itself provides for emergencies.
If two men quarrel over fifty cents the United
States of America must step in and settle the
dispute. If negro turn highway robber, a
whole county must fly to arms and the United
States must restore order. And for this fever
ish condition of society the conservatives of
the South seem to imagine only two remedies.
One is to keep the negro out of politics; the
other is to reflect Gen. Grant. We make these
remarks not with reference to Tennessee par
ticularly the Governor of that State has acted
in the present case with commendable firmness
and judgment; but we speak of the South
generally, where the feeling among the whites
seems to be one of distrust not only of the
negro but of themselves.


Nothing can cure the misfortunes of the
Southern States but reform in their local
governments And this we can assure them
will never be attained by the cultivation of
prejudices of color, the prescription of one
race by the other, and the perpetual inter-
ference of troops, marshals, collectors, and
Cabinet officers with the functions of con-
stables and police magistrates. There is only
one way to peace and prosperity, and that is
by the union of all parties and both coors in
setting up and sustaining honest State admin
istrations When that is done we shall hear
no more of these negro conspiracies."

Of this address: He announced Iii

IN human government, and the opera

The address was one of great powe
and eloquenee, and deserving of
more lengthy report than We are abl,
to give, owing to the pressure of othe
matters upon our columns. NaturaIl,
following up the subject the speaker
called attention to tine inevitable turn

wrote-the tendencies and ultimate
effects and results of the new revolu
tions in England and America. The
Queen is but a symbol of power, where
no power exists-the power at last
rests with the people. British plegm
makes the wheel turn slowly, but il
does turn, and the democracy in form
will be established

PETIT LARCENY FRAUDS


1t must not be supposed, because have so far
given only cases of frauds in which you fraudu-
lars, that there were none OF the petit larceny
order Under the law fixing the Sherins fees
hity cents for summoning constabes to attend
court. This was allowed because constables, II

under q penalty OF IS tor every days neglect, but
they were only allowed 81 SO a day for attendance.
AS tnat was an inadequate price to pay constables
In this city those officers would have gone to the
Legislature and had the law changed rather than
submit to It; so there was compromise all around.
The Sheriff ceased to summon constables and the
Court allowed him to select whoever he pleased
soa sen a Gns ocer hsG @
made no charge Tor summoning consta-
6les, but was content with the patronage.
But during your term there was a resurrection Of
everything that could be used for an ntrance
into the county treasury. You summoned no
appointed number oil your hangers-on as officers.
For every one OF them to whom you gave an APP
summonlng Him 70 place that that he WA Was ase Begging
you to give him. by that fraud you obtained
$65 60 under your Arst term and s6i under your
second, which l put down against you accord
ingly. little extra point is gwen to this small
grab by the fact that during your second term

known; but am confident that bill against the
county WIN be lound from every constable"" you
Another little grab OF the same kind was for
notices OF elections to newspapers. SaeriGs had
ceiviIg notice of an election from the Secretary of
State, been required to communicate IL to the
newspapers. You to save yourself trouble made
the county pay for printing the notice, to which
make no objection; but you also. without authority
Of law or usage, obtained from the county 81 Ior
each newspaper under pretence OF ''servingn the
notice in the newspaper-wOrk that boy could do

which which include % as part Of your lraudulen! re.
half q century the law had required the Sheriff to

have concluded that the 81 So ought to be fee to

charged $43 Is for the advertisements. In Sep

Tor advertising and in December 81 s5 IOr your
self and SIS go Tor advertising but am not able to
6aN that you made more than S24 25 by that little
grab.


PETIT JUROR FRAUDS.


will now specify another OF your large frauds.
There is no provision OF law authorizing payment
to Sheriff ior summOnng petit jurors In criminal
cases. and presume In most oil the counties OF the
State no allowance Thereon Is ever made. As the
Supreme Court declared, in the decision quoted
tended that the perquisites allowed to the Sheriff
should pay him Tor the service. This is particularly
The law allows the sherir fifty cents for each term
Q civil case is on the calendar. to be paid by the
plain TN IN the action In this county the caen-
dar many terms before 1t is reached. understand
tnat In many years there has been no time when
there have been less than 1000 5000 on the calen
dars OF the three courts-Supreme superior and
Common Pleas. Such number-nlne terms in the
year-woud give the Sheriff over So, 900 a year.
petit jurors tor the criminal without charge
That the Legislature never Intended that the
Sherln should be paid Tor SummOning petit Jurors
In criminal cases, would seem to be clear, from the
fact that whie an allowance is provided for sum-





jurors. In 1s4a, however, Monmouth B. Hart the
Sheriff, and his predecessor, Jacob Acker, one OF
each political party, having suffered severely from
the terrible financial revulsion, which commenced
In 1887 the Supervisors under the Influence Of the
sympathy felt lor them, were induced TO- allow
them $40 Tor serving regular panel of petit
jurors, and twenty-five cents each for extra jurors
THIS was not accomplished without stout resist
ance, especially In respect to jurors for the oyer
and Terminer, who also served In the trial of civil
causes IN the Supreme Court. Afterwards the
allowance for serving petit jurors increased,
not by law, but by the Supervisors, thirty cents
for each person summoned. and at that rate The
Sheriff was paid when you were elected.


DEFRAUDING THE COUNTY TREASURY.


Your predecessor also induced the Supervisors
TO allow nim fifty cents each 1or summOnlnR
Jurors for the Marine Court In which only civil
cases are tried. This was as clear robbery Of
the County Treasury as II would be OF q bank to
walk INTO IT. and take money from It's vaults. AS
your predecessor was paid for the service, how
ever, 1t Is not included in this account against"

County Jail-provisiOns fuel. &c. For six quar-
ters the amounts for these supplies are stated
separately In the proceedings OF the Board OF
Supervisors and are not included above. They
ranged from 1920 so TO 1861 ""a quarter The
six quarters not stated separately are deducted
at tue rate OF the smallest amount $420 SO.


KELLY AHEAD OF HIS PREDECESSORS.


THESE frauds appear to have been initiated by
Whett, but you carried them to perfection and
added new ones. Under yOu hey 0nd question,
sherIn's bills became an Institution OF great
power-for the depletion Of the County Treasury.
Each time you were Sheriff You were able to 70
ABOUT $4,000 more than your Immediate prede-
cessor. One deplOrable consequence of such
frauds Is that they produce others. They not only
bring others around them at the time, but
are continuous ""rhe evil that men do lives
alter them."" TO this day the County Treasury
Is suffering from the game that you may
be said TO have opened. l have not included in
the above totals the amounts paid to you and
Lynch Tor fees IN excise suits, because they were
temporary winotalls that should not disturb the

The recent contest in the Tammany Society

The object sought the control OF the Tammany Han

reorganlze the Tammany Hall General Committee by
means Of conesng delegations whose regularity Woulu

who shall meet in Tdmmany Hall. To achieve this oD
iect number Of cOntending factions brought to
support the ticket agreed upon. Matthew T. Brennan

personal enemies, from their efforts to control

dominant faction in Tammany Hall. If they had been
successful believed that the leaders could have
dictated the nominations for county officers this FALL as

and had they preserved sufficient secrecy they
might have But they oyerrated their
strength. and ssome OF the incautious boasted OF

Alderman Cooper was called to the chair, IN
absence of the President.


A petition from the New York Law Telegraph
Company was presented by Alderman Billings,
asking for permission to place their instruments in
the Registers once and the various court rooms
In the Conrt House, After the petition had been
read a resolution was offered by Alderman
BILLINGS TO give the company the permission re-
auested He said a subscription list had been
opened by lawyers, who wished to have tee-
graphic communication between the courts and
their law offices.


Alderman MCCAPFERTY thought this was valu-
able privilege, for which other telegraph COM
panles would be willing to pay He moved to re-
Der the matter to the Committee OF Works.


Alderman BILLINGS said If 1t should appear


THAT THE COMPANY MADE MORE MONEY
than they ought to do it would be time enough to
take subsequent action. Lawyers had frequently
to wait all day, not Knowing when their case
might De called and by having teegraphic COM
munication they would stay in their Ofices and
their clerks could telegraph to them any time they
were wanted.


Alderman McCAEFERrY said the resolution in
yolved great many rights and ought to be
ferred. He thought the franchise would sell for
$4,000 10 $4,000. The case was, happily, Illus
trated by the Western Union Telegraph Company,
which obstructed many Of the streets and made
mint OF money.

 Colony of Desperadoes in the North- - west.

 {. Now comes the news that the mount ed police expedition to the northwest ern territory has been signal failure. The history of this expedition has par ticular interest for Americans. It is more than year ago since the news came to us through the Canadian papers that thieves colony, formidable in numbers, had been established in Dominion territory. close to the Rocky Mountains. When fuller details ar rived, the fact appeared that this colony was made up entirely of persons who extent in various parts of the United States that they were compelled, in order to escape ""Judge Lynch"" to seek safety in flight. Repeated rein forcements from over the border soon swelled the male population to five hundred. There was then no female population. We were told that, after having devoted much time to building Notifications to guard against surprises from possible enemies, the colonists longed for the possession of wives. The leading minds were set to work to conceive plan for gratifying this de- sire. It was decided that the Indian tribes should be made to supply the required number. It was not consid- eled wise to use force, and how to at tain success without it rather puzzled the heads of the outlaws.

 | At last, suggestion of whisky-dis- tilling as chief industry of the colony was the means of developing a very pretty scheme for relieving the Indians of their choicest furs and handsomest women. So soon as the still-house was m good working order, agents were sent among the Indians, and negotia- tions opened for a profitable trade. Samples of whisky sent out te hasten operations were 80 highly approved that the Indians presently pitched their wigwams close to the colony and began quite brisk trade. After many days of drinking and yelling, the whisky gave out. There were no more furs to barter for it. The colonists' oppor. tunity had arrived. They proposed to exchange whisky for squaws, and the proposition was eagerly accepted. In this way matters progressed until the colony was we'll furnished as to wives. Nothing was needed now but few heavy guns to guard the principal ap breaches to the stronghold. A raid was made into the United States, which re- suited in supplying this necessity. h addition to several pieces of artillery the colony owned a large number ot rifles, from each one of which it was possible to fire seventeen shots without reloading. Having succeeded so well in their undertakings, the more adven. turous spirits thought they could dc still better. They procured feet horses and inaugurated marauding excursions that were the terror alike of settlers and Indians.

 This was the news 7 that reached Ottawa. A mounted police force, three hundred strong, was speedily organized under the direction of an English colonel, for the purpose of capturins the stronghold of the outlaws. Iii July last it set tifor the Northwesi with an advance guard of forty men It was we'll equipped and carried { large amount of stores. During three months, we are told that this force has been securing the plains in quest ,o the colony of which such an elaborats description had been given to the gov ernment, without having found any trace whatever of it. One of the cap tains, in recent letter to his father says: %&& #

 ""We have at last got to the end ol our journey. We started homewarc last Monday. Our destination was g fort of whisky smugglers supposed tc be near the forks of Boy and Belly rivers. We arrived there about two weeks ago, but could find neither tho fort, smugglers, nor any traces of them We sent our scouts for about eight, miles around, but could not find ever an Indian. We are all to be divided here. We will have cold trip back""

 The account of the expedition givel by the privates of the force is more il detail. They say that in the marcl across the prairies it was reduced b, bad management, desertion, sickness and death to eighty; that of the ad vance guard of forty mounted men there remained but st eight weary mel on foot"" and that great portion o the three months had been spent il wandering about in search of river that were not found. The last lette sent home by private states that ol the 28th of September the provision had nearly given out, the horses tha had survived the march had been takel flom the men and put to the wagons ""We are now,'' says the writer, ""burn ing buffalo chips for fuel. Starvation stares us in the face, and cold, relent less fall before us. If we go to For Benson, eighty-four miles distant, W must walk there, jaded as we are, an, T then discard our arms and enter int an American fort for protection for tn winter. A sorry spectacle.

No secretary could keep correct minute, and it


would become almost impossible to know what

The chair then stated that the remarks of the

hoped that he, (Alr Adams,) would apply the


rule to his actions.


Mr.. Adams; THANK you; always endeavor to

A serious affray took place between
whites and blacks in Versailles last

killed. The Town Marshal arrested

to-day.


Shooting and Killing.

Washington Items.


WASHINGTON, December 27th.-The
Louisiana Legislature meets January
4th. Opposition is expected to the
ruling of the Returning Board. 1t is
reported that Gen. Sheridan has been
ordered to proceed to New Orleans and
take command in case there should be
trouble.


Four hundred men and women were
discharged yesterday from the Engrav-

ury Department. Part of the work
has been sent to New York.


The Internal Revenue receipts for
December, to date, are $7,6S4, 159; and
for the six months ending Decem-
ber Slst, they will be over $53, 900, 900.
Sheridan does not go to New Orleans.
CHICAGO, December 27th.-General
Sheridan stated to reporter this eve-
ming that he had received an order to
go to New Orleans. But the story of
his departure is unfounded.


Woman Found Dead.


ERIE PENN, December 27th.-
Catharine Hannah, widow, mid
wife by occupation, was found dead in
the gutter just outside ofa low grocery
called the Franklyn House. The in
quest is not concluded, but there is
no doubt her death was the result of
violence, and that the deed was COM
mitted by John HoutZ, man sixty
years old. He is in custody. Deceased
has family of highly respectable
children. There is great excitement.


Mob Law.


EVANSVILLE lind. J, December 9th.
""A party of patrolmen are guarding
Uniontown, KY, from negro incen-
diaries. They hung up a colored
woman three times to extOrt from her
the confession of plot. The town
is much excited and strictly guarded.
Reaction i'm favor of the Pacific Mail.


NEW YORK, December 28th. There
is a strong reaction in favor of the Pa
cifie Mail Company in consequence of
TWINS refusal to testify how the
money was spent. Inview of his dec
laration that he returned from Europe
to destroy the Pacific Mail Company,
the general conviction is that he
would prove the corruption of Con-
gressmen if he could. His frequent
communications with the representa-
tives of the Central Pacific Railroad,
show his cooperation with them in a
desperate effort to break down the Pa
cfic Mail Company and help Jay
Gould in his bearing speculation. If
Irwin don't make clean breast of it,
his attitude will be unfortunate, and
will destroy the value of his other tes-
timany. Some say his brain has not
recovered from the effects of fracture
of the skull."

Tomorrow the Southern Republican Con-
yention will assemble in Chattanooga. to wave
the bloody rag of ""Ku-Klux outrage"" and
persuade the country, if it can, that nothing
but the continuance of Republican rule in the
South, with tho prospect of a third term for
President Grant in the near future, can save
the negroes from a general massacre. Some
of the choicest representatives OF reconstructed
Republicanism are among the delegates. Mr.
Pinchback is going to speak for Louisiana,
and Mr.. Darrall of the same State
will be there to enlarge upon the
letter he wrote to Kellogg last Janu-
ary. about the Presidents scheme to
upset the Kellogg Government so that
Casey might come to the Senate and promote
the project of third term. Mr.. Packard, as
one of the signers of the call, will probably
occupy a prominent position in the assem-
blage, and Senator West, who is also signer,
will have good opportunity to explain what
he did with KellOggs check for $1,000 Arkan-
sas contributes an astonishing amount OF hon.
esty and craftsmanship. Mr.. Powell Clayton's
name speaks for itself, and whatever he says
will doubtless be substantiated by Chef-Jus-
tice Mcclure, commonly known as Poker Jack.
From Alabama will come Senator Spencer,
who once made bargain to give Gen. Grant
the control"" of the State, and several other
eminent persons, the most important of whom
by all odds seems to be the Hon. Charles
Hays.


For Mr.. Hays is the living embodiment of
the present campaign. His letter to Gen.
Hawley condensed into two columns of type
every variety of falsehOOd. misrepresentation,
and cruel suggestion of slander with which
the managers of the Administration party
have been flooding the Northern press. He
told tale of murders and brutalites so hor-
rible that the whole country stood aghast.
If these deeds were done under Republican
State Administration Gas that of Alabama is),
what might we not expect in those unhappy
regions of the South where the White League
holds the reins of power and tramples
upon the lowly without let or him
derancei Last week we published reply
from the prosecuting officer of one
of the counties included IN Mr.. Hays's
black list, and it certainly seemed to convict
the Congressman of gross and inexcusabe
laundering in that part of the State for which
the writer claimed the right to speak. Our
special correspondent in Alabama afterwards
exposed the falsity of what Mr.. Hays said
about the condition of things in Montgomery.
To-day we have from the same trusfy, clear
headed and unprejudiced Investigator a gem
eral review of all the stories in the Hawley
letter which it had been possible to test
at the time he wrote, and we have also had
brief notice by telegraph OF his subsequent
inquiries. The result is soon stated. Except
in Sumter County, where the murders of Joy
and Billings are universally execrated by all
parties, the Outrages reported by Mr.. Hays are
purely fictitious. In not one single instance
so far has the honorable gentleman told the
truth! Most of the alleged Outrages were
never committed at all, and the others seem
TO have had no sort of connection either with
antipathies of race or animOsities of politics.


AS in Alabama, so in other parts of the
Soutb. The War of Races in South Carolina
turns out to be a negro scrimmage. In Ken
tucky it is q ruffanly feud between white out
laws. In Tennessee it is case OF lynching,
OF the familiar pattern which has always been
SO lamentably common in certain parts of the
limited States. In New-Orleans the White
League takes possession of the government
and Immediately orders that One-third of the
appointments on the police force shall be given
to the negroes. If we can believe the bull
letins issued from the office OF the
Attorney General who seems to have
added the duties of court-newsman to
his other functions as general superintendent
of elections and commander of the troops,
rampant rebels are harrying the whole South
with sword, pistol, rifle, and raw-hide, shoot
ing and scourging Republicans. and making"

.yICKsBURG, Miss, Dec. Q, 1874.
The diniculty here mas been called riot. but
that was misnomer. 1t was an attack In three
separate columns by negroes upon The city Tho
cause OF this attack can be stated ia a few words.
For six months Sheriff Peter Crosby dcolored) has
been exercising the functions OF the once without
having given legal 0ond The Board OF County
Supervisors refused to order him to give
the regular bond, and the time drew on
to pay the county taxes some S200, 900.
The Chaneery CLERK was without any bond what
ever, and under an Indictment for emnegzement
and forgery, as was his predecessor. Cardosc, the
present State superintendent OF Education.


CHABGEs AGAINST THE sHEsIFF.


Notwithstanding his indictments rhe Sheriff was
notoriousy packing jures, and three weeks ago
the county records, bearing evidence Of the guast
Of the o1lcials. were stolen from the Court House.
The Taxpayers Association. composed Of the best
citizens and property holders. held meeting last
Wednesday, and in q body went to the Court House
and demanded the RESIGNATION OF the Sheriff.

Coroner. The Sheriff only was found, and he
resigned. The Sheriff then went to Jackson to
consult with Governor Ames. On his return on
Saturday q caro- appeared on the streets and was
circulated throughout the county, signed by
Crosby, calling on republicans, white and black,
to come to his aid and sustain his posi-
tion. Crosby publicly and through the
papers denied the card; yet on Sunday
rumors came that negroes were arming and
gathering at dincrent points to march the city,
but little credence was given to the report then.


THE ATTACK.


On Monday morning at lve O'Clock the alarm
was given thar the negroes were approaching
from several directions. The white citizens armed
and organized in companies. At nine O'Clock
general alarm was given, and . detachment Of
citizen soldiery marched out OF Grove street, and,
near Point Lookout, just inside the city limits,
met body Of 200 negroes The commander OF
the citizens warned them to disperse, when the
negroes replied, ""we have come for a light and
We are going to nave It,""


Firing then commenced. The negroes were
soon routed, with loss Of six killed, several
wounded and some prisoners taken. Among
the latter was Andrew owens, the negro com.
mander.


FIGHTING ON THE OLD GROUND.


few minutes after the engagement derach.
ment OF citizens, sent out on the Jackson road on
the northeast side, encountered q large body OF
negroes, strongly intrenched in the old federal
breastworks, Just west Of the monument
where Pemberton surrendered. The nghr
here lasted an hour, and was the most sanguin-
airy tight OF the day. The infantry In front
engaged the negroes while the cavalry charged
their hanks. The negroes ned In wild disorder
and twenty-five were killed and wounded. oliver
Brown. white, was also killed.


THE THIRD BATTLE.


ABOUT the same time three companies OF citizens
met $50 negroes on Cherry street, South, and,
with yell, charged on them driving them from
their strong position on the hill with light loss.
The cavalry at other points dispersed the negroes
and by noon the war was over


Sheriff Crosby was arrested early and put under
guard at the Court House. ON Monday night an
effort was made to lynch him. but the deed was
prevented by the white guard. On Tuesday after
noon the funeral procession OF Oliver Brown,
while passing Snyder's Biun near the city, was
fred into by negroes, and william Vaughan,
citizen, was killed.


To-day everything is quiet and business has been
resumed In the city. The Board OF County Super

resignation. and ordered An election to I'LL the
vacancy.

tured, says ne was ordered BY Crosby to come to
the city on Monday morning with all the armed
negroes he could gather together. Stackhouse.

in a negro church in the lower part OF the county
on sunday.

cerning the murder of B. H. johnson.
and wife, at North Lexington, Mo-, it.
appears that johnson had not lived
happily with his wife, and left for Ken
lucky some months ago. He returned
suddenly last Sunday evening, accom-
panied by Lorenzo johnson, q cousin.
one riding a fine horse and the other o
mule, and stopped at the house of Mrs.
Lindsey, mother Of Johnson's wife.
About two o'clock on Monday morning
pistol shot was heard in the room oc--
cupied by johnson and his wife, and on.
the family entering, johnson was found
with bullet hole in his head and his
skull broken, and his wife head mashed
to q jelly with an axe. A letter was
found on the table, signed by B. H..
johnson, addressed to Lorenzo john
son, in which he says he committed the
deed, and determined to do so before
leaving Lexington, on account Of his
wifc's infdelity. The statement in the
letter is not believed, for the reason that
johnson could not write. Lorenzo is:
thought to be the murderer. although
there is no proof Of it.. About ten
o'clock Monday morning, train from
the west came down, and just as Loren
20 was getting aboard, he was arrested
for horse stealing. The horse and mule
ridden by him and cousin proved to
have been stolen at Ofailcn, Mo-, and
these two men answer the thieves de-
scription. johnson was taken to kich-
mond, and at last accounts fears were
entertained that he would be lynched.
The verdict Of the jury was that john
son and his wife were killed by blows Of
an axe and pistol shots after being chlo-
reformed. Lorenzo johnson is not


charged with murder, but the matter is


involved in great mystery."

/. WHEREAS: The principle that there
should be no Taxation without Representation
was the foundation of the contest for American
Independence, and it is joined to, and supple

allowing wages Of labor to be attached fo

now most frequently heard in New York,

what il the matter with trade e. This
question, says tho Lynchbur News. is not
proposed BY the great merchants of the
Northern cities, for they know the cause.
They know il better than Congress knows
it. They know il better than Cabinet min
listers or evsn editors know it. Collectors
and drummers, the Ieportorial correspon-
dents Of the great merchants, never make
errors In their rsports. They work with the
certainty that purely business habits bestow.
Ask them what Is the matter with trade, and
they will tell you in single sentence. That
sentence is"" No money at the South-po
property worth rush IN the South"" That's
what Is the matter With trade There is no
collecting money In the South, there is
no selling anything there and if he venture
North, the southerner il now sure that with
out buying q single bill Of goods he can find
credit enough to pay his bill at the St. Mich
olas and purchase return ticket.

PORT JERvIs, n. T., Oct. %, 1874


The following are the particulars OF a nendish
crime perpetrated near Gibsons. a small m,n.ng
village in Pennsylvania. and as nendlsh, however
merted. retrbution following it:-Martin
Groves. an ignorant and dissipa-ed man about
thirty-dve years old. had lived Tor years on the
mountain back OF Gibsons. he was IN the habit OF
making periodical visits to the village, where he
Invariably became more or less intoxicated.
Drunk or sober, he was always considered man
OF british and unbridled passions. On Saturday
last he was in Gibson's. He was not very drunk
and about the middle OF the afternoon was
missed. This was something unusual as 1t was
his custom 70 continue MS orgies late into the
night before departing for home. As hIs absence
was OF no Importance II mercy excited pass
ing remark.

carried INTO the house 6y two men In an Almost
Dsibe conditions. They said they had found
her lying near the road IN piece OF woods about
hall mile out OF the village Her clothing was
badly torn and ner lace was bleeding from large
but not dangerous cut above the lett temple.
Wen spoken 10 she opened ner eyes and essayed





nlz' z the girl. the men brought ner as quickly as
possible to her motner's house. 1t was clear that
she had been violated by some fend, who had
evidently Knocked ner senseless by the GLOW on
ner head. The mine surgeon was summoned and,
| unuer his trea ment. about nine O'Clock
4 Her story was that she was on her way home
after doing her errand. and when she reached the
piece OF woods ne Moons creek she saw Martin

AFRAID OF HIM. and Stopped, undecided whether g

she concluaed TO go n0sees sly by him III the road.
When SHE got about opposite TO where he sat
/ he raised his head and then rose to his feet. He
stepped IN front OF her ana said:-

""Yes Martini"" said the girl, 'but please don't
He made no reply to this, but took hold OF ner
by botu shoulders and pushed her towards the
woods. She screamed loudly for help, when he
struck her a blow with mis- hst on the side oil her
head, and she remembers nothing until coming to
her senses some time before the men IOund her.
sac knew she was lying in the woods, and her con-
dlton, but was too weak to move.


Wnen TINS story was made known throughout
the village the greatest excitement prevailed. A
crowd OF twenty-five men gathered and decided
upon seeking out Groves and giving him summary
justice They proceeded In body up the noun
tain aud captured him in the woods. They then
took him down into a deep depression between
two OF the lotv hills. In tnat lonely vale. by the
light OF the moon struggling through heavy

hands bound behind MIN, ana then ne was hanged

he was dead. lie was afterwards buried near the
hut wAere he had lived Tor years. N


The outrage the Davis girl was not Groves
first cline OF tnat nature. The commission Of
tbree smiar Outrages was laid at his door by
general Denel, which had maue him terror TO all
women ana children. But all this aoes not just fy

Valley Railroad. aud the Baltimore and ONO Rail-
road also passes through It, 1t Is struggling, un-
prepOssessing country town, containing about
5000 or 6,0OO inhabitants. The houses are mostly

by workmen OF the Baltimore and Onio Railroad,
which has extensive shops here. The nam street
runs north and south, and where II Is intersected
by King street Is The public square, a large open
space, which Is supposed 10 be the centre Of the

Mr.. Kellogg has now been reinstated at New
Orleans by MajorGen. Emory, after remaining
in seclusion at the Custom-house just long
enough to convince the world that no party
whatever in Louisiana sustained his preten-
sions to the Governorship. More than year
and a half ago Mr.. Carpenter, speaking in the
name of majority of the Senate Committee
which had made a careful investigation OF the
condition of Louisiana affairs, reported to the
Senate that ""if Federal support were with
""drawn Kelogg's Government wonld be i'm
""mediately supplanted."" The result has justi-
fed his prediction to the letter. The bay
onets which propped up Mr.. Kellogg's chair
having been taken away. that doughty magls-
trate instantly tumbled into the mire. His fall
was so sudden that he cid not make even
momentary pretense of ability to stand alone;
so dsgraceful that he can never recover the
prestige he has lost by it and so disastrous
that the Federal General had great difficulty
in picking him up again, and could not per-
suade him to resume his usurped authority
until forty hours after the last of his armed
opponents had gone home and the troops had
kept the city for him during day and two





Louisiana is ruled not by officers of her choice,
but by procOnsul from Washington.


While these transactions were going on,
Senator Morton made defense of Kellogg at
indianapolis, and it is the only defense of
him that we have seen from any source en-
titled to moments consideration. lie as
sured his hearers that the fraudulent charac-
ter of the alleged election of McEnery was
fully established by the Senate investigation;
that Kellogg had been recognized by the Su-
preme Court and that the Senate, by reject
ing the bill for new election, had declared
his to be the lawful Government OF the State.
The shameful story of Louisiana has been told
over and over again, but we cannot
allow such gross Misrepresentation as
these to pass unnotced. Gov. Morton, as
member Of the Committee to which he
refers, ought to know, better than he
seems to know, what it discovered and what
it reported. The judgment of the majority
was written by Mr.. Carpenter, whose preju-
dices were all on the side of the Kellogg
party, and whose position as a friend and
supporter of the Administration is quite as
conspicuous as that of Gov. Morton himself.
That Judgment declared the De Ferret return





and Penn by majority of about 1000, to be
the only legal one, and the only one which
had any returns before it, and found that
Kellogg was intruded into Office by an irregu-
lar, unprecedented and wholly void order of
Judge Durell, enforced at the point of the
bayonet. 1t is impossible"" says the report
""to conceive of o more irregular, ille-
q"" gal, and in every way inexcusable act
""on the part of judge"" Viewed in
""any light in which your Committee can con-
""sider them, the orders and injunctOns made
""and granted by Judge Durell In that cause
care most reprehensible, erroneous in point of
""law, and wholly void for want of jurisdic-
""tion, and your Committee must express their
""sorrow and humiliation that Judge of the
""United States should have proceeded in such
""fagrant disregard of his duty"" But for
""the interference of Judge Durell in the
""matter of this State election, matter wholly
""beyond his jurisdiction, the McEnery Gov
""ernment would to-day have been the dc facto
Government of the State. Judge Durell in
""terposed the army of the United States be-
tween the people of Louisiana and the only
Government which has the semblance of
regularity, and the result of this has been
""to establish the Kellogg Government, so far as
""that State has now any government"" And
as for the proceedings of the Lynch returning
board, upon which Kellogg based his title to
Office, the Committee say There is nothing
+"" in all the comedy of blunders and frauds
under consideration more indefensible than
""the pretended canvass of this board.
No person can examine the testimony ever
e"" so cursorily without seeing that this pre-
""tended canvass had no sembance of
""integrity. The proceedings of that
""board cannot be sustained without dis
regarding all the provisions of the law
applicable to the subject, and ignoring the
distinction between good faith and fraud.n
Your committee are therefore led to the
conclusion that if the election held in
November, 1872, be not absolutely void for
frauds committed therein, McEnery and his
associates in State offices and the persons
certified as Members of the State Legislature
""by the De Feriet Board ought to be
recognized as the legal government of the
""State.n


That makes it clear enough what commit
tee of the friends of the Administration thought
of Kellogg's title to office. What shall we say

inclined to believe the statement.


Another statement, now gong the rounds
here concerning Mr.. John Mitchell, am equally
inclined to dscredit. 1t is to the effect that,
although Mr.. Mitchell Intends returning to the
United States at an early date. he wishes to
end his days in his native land and that he
will be enabled to do without fear of being
sent to prison ordered into exile by the au.
thorities; that influential parties are endeav-
oring to obtain :"" a Royal pardon for Mr..
Mitchell; and that he will DO pardoned before
Mr.. Disraeli's visit to this country, which is to
take place next month. 1t is possible, how
ever, that Disraeli may do this to render him
self popular, and pardoning Mr. Mitchell would
be different thing from pardoning the Fe-
mans. One thing is certain-tbe ilustrious
Z"" ""felon"" will himself never ask IL pardon
from any British government.


The p. j. Smyth controversy is at present
almost completely in allegiance. MIR. Smyth
has in effect confessed bimself beaten by the
Nation. He has not gained single adherent
after his three months' campaign against
Home Rule. The only persons on his side known
beyond the locatlty in which they live, num-
Der exactly the same as they did three mouths
ago, and they are the Marchioness of Queens
berry, DR.. Grattan, of Kildare, and the Rev.
Mr. Carroll, Protestant Incumbent of St.
Brides, Dublin. The Marchioness is thor
ough patriot, but she knows nothing about the
respective merits of Repeal and Federalism,
and is led completely away by empty phrases
about Irish liberty such P. J. Smyth, in inn
itation of Thomas Francis Meagter, is so fond
of weaving. Dr.. Grattan, of Kildare, is, in
deed, q nephew of the great Henry Grattan,
and is honest, but be is eighty years of age,
and if the truth must be told in painest
phrase, he is doatipg Although be goes in for
's2 clubism, like P. J. Smyth, he still con- Times
a member of the Home Rule League The Rev
Mr.. Carroll does exactly the same. He is not
q man of any weight influence. Aud this is
Mr.. Smyth's following!


The Grattan statue to be erected in College
Green, opposite the old Parliament House, was
left complete by the great sculptor, Mr.. Foley,
and will soon be erected and unveiled. The
O'Connell Monument am afraid will not be
ready for years may mention here story
heard of the deceased sculptor day or two
since. 1t is to the effect that hls Illness was
brought on in part by Queen Victoria's unfortu-
nate, frequent and ill-timed requests and
commands in the matter of the memorial to
her husband, Prince Albert.


The Bishop of Galway, DR.. MacEVilly, has
accepted what seems to me at least right
geod way of advancing the great cause of
temperance amongst his people. He has just
finished his annual Confirmation tour, and all
the children and youths whom he confirmed
took teetotal pledge at his hands.


Mrs. CulliDan, about whom 1 wrote at length
last week, is now being looked for anxiously
by the police, but so far both herself and her
children have eiuded capture, and I believe
they will not be captured.


The ceremonies ordered by his Emnence
Cardinal Cullen, last week, took place on Sun
day and Monday, and will be continued on
Sunday next, when they will conclude with q
sermon by Father Burke. Amongst the dis
tinguished ecclesiastics who attended the Pro-
Cathedral here on Sunday and Monday were
the Bishop of Bathurst (Dr. NJ. QUINN, the
new Bishop of Ballarat CDR. O'Connor), the

Death Of the Negro Boy, Ernest


Smith, on the Scaffold.

CONVICTED OF A REVOLVING CRIME.

Singular Composmre of the Prisoner Dur


ing Trial and Condemnation.

THE SCENE OF EXECUTION.",,"EAsroS, Talbot County, Nd, August 7, 1874


The crime for which Ernest Smith, a colored lad,
about eighteen years Of age, was executed here
to-day, is, in the eye OF Maryland law, more
henous than murder. The law OF this State pro-
vides that the outrage OF white woman by negro
shall be regarded as the highest crime known to
the law. and out Of eight cases that have been
tried In Maryland during the past three years not
one OF the accused has escaped the death penalty.
The story OF the condemned mans onence is the
same told Of the other wretched negroes who have
suffered death for this crime. In this instance
the hend would have added murder to the other
diabolical deed had he not been discovered In
time.


rHR HORRIBLE CRIME.


1t was Sunday, the 10th OF April last, that the
community In and about Trappe, a small town in
Trappe district Talbot county, Maryland. was
thrown into great excitement by the most daring
and villainous outrage ever perpetrated in that
vicinity. Miss Kate Bartlett, about sixteen years
of age, very attractive and prepossessing in ap.
pearance, Is q daughter Of Mr.. James Bartlett, OF
Trappe district She resided with her father,
about two miles from the town OF Trappe. On the
occasion in question she was going TO a Sunday
school held In q church about a mile and
hall from her home. When about half
way on her journey, and near place





for her, emerged from his hiding place, and sezing
MISS Bartlett. fOrctbly dragged her to the road
side and attempted his brutal assault. Though
but eighteen years OF age his great strength and
athletic build made him master Of the girl who,
with all the strength OF her wOmanhood, resisted
desperately the purpose OF her assailant She,
too was stronger than most girls at her time
OF life, and the struggle to free herself from
the grasp Of the black devil completely ex.
hausted her. Smith finally throttled her. threw
her to the ground in the middle Of
the highway and succeeded in accomplish
ing his purpose. In the struggle all the
poor girls underclothing was torn from her
person and injuries inflicted which rendered her
perfectly helpless and unable to move. In the
moment Of triumph two citizens were seen by
Smith short distance down the road, and he
made hts escape without doing further violence to
his victim. When they reached Miss Bartlett and
discovered her terrible condition they secured
help and removed her to her father's house, where
she received proper medical attention.


THE ARREST OF SMITH.


Before mndown the country for miles around
had been apprised Of the crime OF Smith
neighborhood so free from the more grtevous
crimes was doubly outraged at the assault on the
daughter OF an estimable citizen, and all the
feeling OF honor among the descendants OF the



The men turned out en- nsdsse, on horse. in
vehicle and on foot, determined to visit summary
punishment II Smith could be found. Constable
Simpson, hearing OF the crime, and knowing the
Indignation which the report had aroused, was
fearful that lynch law would be enforced. He,
with his posse, was on the alert and toward
evening traced Smith to o coiored meeting house.
where he was arrested. 1t was with the greatest
difficulty the enraged citizens were prevented
from executing him upon the spot, but ultimately
the counsels OF some OF the more conservative In
the community prevailed, and Smith was safely
lodged In Jail in Easton, the county town OF Talbot


THE TRIAL.


At the May term Of the County Court the trial Of
Smith took place, and was very brief. The sullen
nature of the depraved criminal was apparent
throughout. he heard with unconcern the direct
and over whemng evidence which was certain to
result In his strangling on the galiows. The story
OF his victim was corroborated by the two citizens
who saw Smith running away. During the trial
the deepest interest was taken by the citizens OF
the county, and at the recital Of the girls story OF
the prisoners crime only respect for the Court pre-
vented them from hanging Smith before verdict
had been rendered. His counsel saw how hopeless
was the case and not one word could be said in
defence OF their client. the jury were hardly In
their room before a verdict OF guilty was reached,
and on the afternoon Of May 26 that word fell upon
the Indifferent ear>of Ernest Smith which to every
body else meant death. few days after he was
brought into court and


SENTENCED TO BE HANGED,


and from the Court House he was conducted to the
dungeon In JAIL his friends knowing how utterly
hopeless was his case. In Maryland the Court SEN
tences, but the Governor fixes the day of execu-
tion and on the 9th OF June Governor Groome
signed the death warrant of Smith, fixing the 7th
OF August rs the day OF execution.


On the 1st OF July the death warrant was re-
ceived b.. the Sheriff Of Talbot county and the
prisoner brought from bis cell to the Sherirs
apartments, where. in the presence Of a number
OF citizens, the warrant was read.


! Following the reading the Sheriff impressed
upon the condemned the brev1ty OF MS earthly ca
reer and the Importance Of an early and an ear
nest preparation to meet his doom. The Rev. Mr.
Newman, Of the Methodist Church, offered q
prayer In behalf Of the young mans soul. The
plain announcement that on the 7th day Of
| August, before the hour Of two O'Clock, he would
die felons death brought out all there was human
in him and he wept violently for several minutes
this unusual exhibiuon of feeling, however, being
followed BY his accustomed demeanor and look OF
I indifference. Rev. MIR. Newman continued TO visit
him. and Of Smith it be said as OF others Of hts
! race sentenced to DEATH that the gallows has
been to him


THE ROAD TO PARADISE


! He has oflate listened attentivey to the exhor-
tations Of his spiritual adviser and professed that
he had found peace with his Maker and said he
was ready to die. During his imprisonment he was
treated with the utmost kindness BY the Sheriff
and his family and appeared to be grateful for
their consideration Of his wants.

long rivals to the last extent In fact opposition
could only go ON while the several railroad sys-
tems were levying on each others territory. The
main light. OF course, was between the Pennsyl-
vania and the Garrett company, the latter to pass
through Maryland to Washington and the South,
the former to build In to Plttsburg and get hold Of
the mighty freight business at that point. Both
were disappointed. Although the Baltimore COM
pany crossed the Allegnanies a second time and
proceeded down the Youghiogheny to Pitts
burg the reights did not leave the old established
route. The Connesvllle road has been q disap-
pOintment to Baltimore.


In the same way the Pennsylvania's intent to
be great Southern line has tailed at three several
points. Building South from Cincinnati, the panic
struck them and stopped work. They began to
extend their Cumberland Valley ROAD down the
Shenandoah Valley, but the Baltimore concern got
the start Of them, and is already at Staunton.
Trying the same thing from Washington City to
Richmond, they got no farther than Quantico and
are suspended there In mid-air, utterly unable to
capture the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Baiti-
more road. So have their designs to run up the
Monongaheia and take the State OF West Virginia
which is one OF Mr.. Garrett's pocket boroughs from
his grasp tailed. They have tapped the Baltimore
and Ohio system at Baltimore, Cumberland and
Martinsburg but have failed at Wheeling and
more vital points. They have struck the New York
Oon< Dvx(po Oh
Erie, Ashtabula and Cleveland. But these many
partial advantages have weakened the central su-
perstition Of this road In mems faith. The Scott
design has been too wide, wild and sptdery for
prudent men to understand its merits. 1t goes BY
double routes to Cincinnati St. Louis and Chicago,
thus rivalling itself-a competitor-running
out rival at the added expense to ITSELF Van
derbilts and Garrett's roads, plain, powerful and
lucid, yet command the conservative Judgment Of
men.


THE ERIE ROAD. 81.
And now we have all these people apparently
coinciding IN the settlement OF the Erie railway
under Hugh T. Jewett. The Erie has been pulled
and hauled between those delectable people, Gold
schmidt and Bschonshetm, Gould and Fisk, until It
has got to be stock manufactory and the terror
both of the street and Of its rivals Wide and wild
in range yet the sratghtest OF all highway to
the great West, and essentially New York cor
poratlon by geography and aim, it seems hard to
see 1t pass into the Presidency Of an ohio man.
Jewett has just passed out Of Congress from
Columbus, Ohio The battle he gave the District
government at Washington will subject him to
equally cool and searching investigation in his
management OF shis great railroad. He is by the
slow growth OF time q man OF prudent judgment
and strong cumulativeness. Cold, austere,
with strong visage and capacity to listen as wen
as to be emphatic, he looks as II he would be the
best President the Erie has ever had.


THE ORIGIN OF THE CONFERENCE.


This conference, which will probably lead to q
long truce both personal and commercial, be-
tween the great belt lines, grew out OF small
local fight between the Philadelphia and Bati-
more roads over the matter OF the passage Of their
trains between Philadelphia and Baltimore. The
Scott interest owned q rather devious line by
Columbia and York to Washington. They could
not make time over this road and finally agreed,
after bitter years OF contention to divide oppor-
tunity and run two full express trains per day
over the short intervening road which neither
owned. About this time Mr.. Garrett, literally worn
out with railroad work, was ordered to Europe for
long stay. He was q man OF powerful intensity
oil character and a long hater. After he departed
his representatives, John King and MI. Keyser
Thomson. who had somewhat of the obstinacy OF
Mr.. Garrett, in coming paciflcay together and
vital Mr.. Scott has an easy. sugges
tive nature, rapidity and despatch, and

ATLANTA, Ca Dec. 81, 1874.


This morning between seven and eight O'Clock
suicide took place in our city which IN deliDera-
uon OF purpose and execution exceeds anything
we nave ever known. The name OF the unhappy
man Is W. Samuel J. Anderson. 1t seems he
mad managed to accumulate no money during his
career ana three or four months ago he was
out OF employment and out OF money. At this
time General Robert TO0mps was busy push.
ing his famous suits against the Mitchell
heirs, and also the suits recently tried
against the railroads under the tax law or
1874. Finding Anderson unemployed, Mr. Toombs
hired him to assist in fixing up papers and law
authorities on these cases at stated salary OF
Sl25 per month. To the complications arising
from tnis appointment may be attributed the un-
happy mans suicide. 1t seems that some months
ago Anderson drew upon General Toombs for his
first half months salary. The draft was met and
paid. subsequently he drew through Mr.. Jerry
Lynch second draft upon General TooHbs for
whole months salary. THIS draft was cashed at
Lowry's Bank here and also promptly paid by
General Toombs. A few weeks later General
Toombs met Anderson, ana. ascertaining that ne
was in need Of money. gave him $lco in addition
to his salary. On December l An1erson again
drew upon General Toombs, as foiiows:-

for non payment. Anderson also received a note
from Toombs, informing him that ne owed him
nothing. Mr. Anderson had stated and thought
that his engagement oy General Toombs was per-
manent When he received the money from
Lowry's he was In his usual cheerful spirits.
Alter the draft was returned he became much

or It's agents or clerks.


MANIPULATING RETURNS ON THANKSGIVING DAY.


Two clerks Of the Board swear that the chief
clerk, Campbell, and another clerk broke the
seals Of the returns, and on Thanksgiving Day
were engaged for three hours, when the Board
was not In session, In manipulating some OF them.
One afndavit very seriously compromises TWO
members Of the Board.


WHAT THEY WOULD DO IN KANSAS.


republican Kansas Judge, sitting beside me-
listening TO the amdavits, and learning that the
action OF the board cannot be reviewed by the
courts, declared that II such attempts were made
In Kansas to defeat the voice Of the people the
guilty parties would be hanged by the populace.


THE BOARD RESPONSIBLE.


II the forgeries were not committed BY the
members OF the Board they cannot shtrk the
responsibility for the action OF others, the
turns have been under their seal and lock ana Key
since the election.


WHAT THE BOARD WILL DARE TO DO.


The democratic counsel at the Returning Board
now express the belief that In face or all the
frauds and forgeres tney have traced to the
Board or It's subordinates and party supporters
since the returns OF the parishes have been made
to them, they will not dare to return less than
sixty-nlne democratic Assembymen, which Will
make the lower House stand sixty -four democrats
to thirty.two republicans; but they have doubts
whether they viii give them all the Senators they
have elected.


A REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE REPUDIATES FRAUD.


The republican candidate for State Assembly for
Sabine, to count in whom the returns were altered
after they were In the possession OF the Board,
teleeraphs that he was defeated fairly and does
not approve the attempted fraud.


DANGER OF VIOLENCE


The people are more incensed than ever to-day
owing to these revelations. and 1t is believed that
enough Of them would be willing to lynch the Re-
turning Board and trust to facts to vIndcate their
conduct were 1t not that they are afraid that
Grant would I'LL the State House with troops and
prevent their meeting as q Legislature IN Janu-
ary. Many OF them believe that when the legally
elected democratic majority peacefully assembled
In Senate and Assembly recognizes McEnery as
the Governor, they, as the highest authority In
tho State, will be entitled to respect, and the
people, having settled by their votes what
Congress failed to DO In Its last session, Grant
Will pause before dispensing the people and the
Legislature BY the bayOnet, and before installing
q Legislature composed Of defeated candidates.
This view, which has taken deep root In the minds
Of the masses, win probably save the Board from
violence, II they do not escape from the city
before promugating the result OF the election.


REPUBLICAN HKELMas MIMIC INTIMIDATION.


After thorough investigation am satisfied
that the unarmed men who appeared In the
streets early last week were not Americana, but
were probably foreigners, and were employed to
give the impression that the republicans are in
Inundated.


Colonel Marr asserts that he has had no con-
sultation with Colonel Angel or any OF the other
leaders. and all deprecate any violence.

NEW ORLEANS, Dec. IA, 1874
In the Returning Board to-day John b. Davis,
Supervisor OF Registration, and six Commission.
ers OF Election OF st. Helena parish, made am
davits that the election returns from that parish
now in the hands OF the Returning Board have
been tampefed with, and changes and alterations
made In them since they were delivered TO the
Secretary OF the Board


Mr.. Arroys offered the foll0wing:-


whereas according to the sworn statement OF
the Supervisor OF Registration of the parish OF ST.
have been tampered with since said returns have
bean nled with this Board;


upon said Supervisors returns, Investigate the
charges made in the above statement, in order
that the guilty parties be dealt with according 70
law.


This was adopted and the investigation viii be
held tomorrow.


THE PROOFS OF FRAUDS.


Governor Wells proposed that the democratic
counsel submit all evidence and examine all an.
davits relating to contested parishes. and then
submit the whole to the Board for their action.
To this proposition the conservatives OBJ
jected, for the reason, they stated. that
certain papers have been placed among
the records without their knowledge, or
the contents Of which they are not informed, and
requested that, while the protested parishes are
under consideration, as each case Is taken they
may be notified, so as to Inspect the
papers In each case and see that none
of the proofs onered by them have been distracted
or suppressed, nor that any new contrary proof
has been died unknown to them, 80 that all legal
proof and none other, may be before the Board
for its consideration. This request was acquiesced
In, and the Carroll Parish returns were taken up.


THE PROCEEDINGS BROKEN OFF.


Before anything had been done Q messenger
came In and whispered something to the Presi-
dent, Governor Wells, who at once arose and
stated that he had just been o11cially informed
that armed White Leaguers were stationed In the
adjacent building ready at any moment to dts
turb the proceedings Of the Board. He therefore
moved an adjournment until tomorrow At eleven

Cline to overtake him, which he did, and

Our correspondent at Shasta sends the

here to night under strong guard, and
was Immediately lodged in Jail. After
being strung up five times near where he
committed the crime he confessed his
guilt, and under promise of the parties
that had him in hand that they would
take him to Shasta and give him trial,
he offered to show where he buried the

from his horse. Baker dismounted and
shot Cline through the head, killing him
him instantly. Baker is a young man
about 2S years of age. Public sentiment
is strongly against his being brought here

a riot, but that was a misnomer.-
1t was an attack in three separate
columns by negroes upon the city.
The caus, of this attack can be sta
ted in a few words. For six months
sheriff Peter Crosby (colured) has
been excising the functions Of the
office without having given legal
bond. The Board Of County Su>
pervisors refused to order him to
give the regular bond and the time
drew on to pay the county taxes
some 5000, 900. The chancery clerk
was without any bond whatever, and
under an indictment for embezzle
ment aud forgery, as was his pre-
decessor, Cardoso the present State
Superintendent of Education.


CHARGES AGAINST THE SHERIFF.
| notwithstanding his indictments,
the sheriff was notoriously packing
juries, and three weeks ago the
county records, bearing evidence of
the guilt of the officials, were stolen
from the courthouse. The Tax,
payers Association, composed of
the best citizens and property hold
ers, held meeting last Wednesday,
and in body went to the cour,.
house and demanded ithe resigna>
tion of the sheriff, the chsncery
clerk, the treasurer, and the coro.
ner. The sheriff only was found,
and he resigned. The Sheriff then
went TO Jackson to consult with
Governor Ames. On his return on
Saturday card appeared on the
streets, and WAS circulated through.
out the county, signed by Crosby,
calling on Republicans, white and
black, to come to his aid and sus
tain his position. Crosby publicly
and through the papers denied the
card yet on Sunday rumors came
that negroes were srning and gath
ering at different points to march
ON the city, but little credence was
given to the report then.


THE ATTACK.


On Monday morning at 5 o'clock
the alarm was given that the negr9sss Pr
rections. The white citizens armed
and organized in companies. AT
9 o'clock general alarm WAS given,
and a detachment Of oitiz n SOL
iirry marched out of Grove street,
r and, near Point Lookout. just insid.
the city limits, met body Of 2OC
negroes. The commander of tn.
, itizens warned them to dlspersr
/ when the negroes replied, ""Wc have
t come for a figh, and We are goiue
to have it"" Firing then commenc
h ed. The negroes were soon routed
with a loss of six killed, severa


wounded, and some prisoners taken
Among the latter was Andrev


Owens, the negro commander.
u FIGHTING ON THE OLD GROUND.


a few minutes after this engage
Il ment detachment of citizens, sen
- out on the Jackson road on tn,


northeast side, encountered larg
: body OF negroes strongly entrench


ed in the old Federal breastwork
Z! Just west of the monument wher


Pemberton surrendered. The igh


here lasted on hour, and was tn

The Infantry in front engaged tn

r. their fanks. The negroes fed j
'e wild disorder, and twenty-five killet
k and wounded. Oliver Brown white
l. was also killed.


THE THIRD BATTLE.
, About the same time three com


panies of citizens met $50 negroe


on Cherry street, south, and with
i yell, charged on them, driving the,
\ a from their strong position on tn
u J. hill with light loss. The calvar
- ~ at other points dispersed the ne
""a groes, and by noon the war Wa


over.


u Sheriff Crosby was arrested eal

us of what Orator Phillips said of BOnaparte
it is grand gloomy, and peculiar""
! reducing to reality the grim ideals OF the
| saffron paper rOmances. In some of the locali-
ties, murder seems to be the rule, and people
| who go on living appear to do SO by excep-
| tional accident Oifenses personal, which IN
| other States culminate in temperate nOse-pull-
ing or cheek smiling, end there in a gum


powdery and plumbcous denouement. Where


we mild hammered men shed ink and


relieve ourselves by libel. these more


ardent souls find homicide the only mitigation
of their exacerbations. The newspapers are
| nothing if not obituary. You look into them
| to find the state of the wool or hide market,


and you read how in such a county the unfor-
| tunate 80 -and-sO was ""badly cut in the abdO-


""men during an alteration"" with so-and so.
| The Lynch law reports, with the decisions OF
boOdthirsty BlackstOnes, crowd the tame


doings of the common law courts out of sight.
| There are bandits meandering and carrying
| off mules not their own in Bandera County; the
noble Indian tOmahawk ks and scalps at will in Me-
nard; the Sheriff of Brown has been madeaway


with by outlaws; the dreadful Mexican is
ravagng the frontier, and all is horse steal


ing homicide, and narrowing horror! No


wonder that Texans of the pacific sort at last


lose their tempers, and holding conference


with their consciences, resolve that patience
has ceased to be virtue. No wonder that


sef-cOnstituted courts indict, arraign, try, find


puilty, and then incontinenty hang the rest


less and red-handed No wonder that sick OF
the snail pace of official Justice, the Lynchers


do to death rowing rascals whenever and wher-


ever they are caught. Has the reader heard


of the nice little Jail delivery in Bell County,
on the oath ult. 1t was very curious.


There is a Jail, you see, in Bell County, and
| naturally it was full of thOughtlessly energetic
men. most of whom had yielded to passion
for the mules of their neighbors. There were
| a few charged with the minor offenses of mur-


der and burglary, but the mule marauders


were in the majority both as to numbers and


importance. This being the situation, down


upon the donjon of Bell County
came a crowd of the orderly, peace
able, and law-abiding mule-Owners of the
| yicinage. Into Jail they broke with celerity
and easerness never displayed by anybody in


breaking out of it. Hanging was by far too
long q process for the hungry stomachs of
the avengers-neat and rapid shooting was
the operation resorted to. Mr.. Coleman, who
killed his wife in Carol County, fell first /;
Mr.. Crone, lover of other peoples horses, then


succumbed then Mr. McCowen, also horse
conyeyancer then yielded their lives to the


fierce fusllade few murderers, including an
operator bearing the dissatisfied name of
william Henry Grumbles. AS may be sup
posed, Mr.. Grumbles found q great deal of
fault, not with his execution, for that


the man, used to Texan ways, seems
70 have accepted as matter of course, but at
the bungling manner IN which the judicial job


was done. ""Mr. Grumbles"" we are told, even


before the firing, ""cursed the killing party
considerably His opinion of the execution
ers, delivered with great freedom and vigor,


and backed up by his personal oaths in great
number, probably interfered with the point


blank of the rifles. Mr.. Grumbles had reason


to complain that he was missed entirely at the
first discharge, and he Immediately returned


brisk fire of sarcastic illusions to the
bad quality of the Lynch shooting.
He sneeringly invited the party ""to
""try again. and under the stimulus of


this sarcasm Mr.. Grumbles was so peppered


that he ceased grumbling at once and forever.


When the Sheriff. who had been wandering
in some far distant region in search of an


escaped prisoner, got back to the cage he
found nine corpses therein-the prisoners of
Death! SO he buried them, swept out the
cage, and made all ready for another batch.

A SAD SEQUEL.-Some of the newspapers
of this State, as elsewhere, published solely in
the interests of the Democratic party, seem to
be pleased at the troubles between the whites
and negroes of the South and hAunt every
trivial circumstance of this character as war
of races"" and as a winning political card. Every
negro who is lynched for shooting a white man
is set forth in big head lines and with infinite
satisfaction, because it is so much stock added
to their party capital, they seem to think


So it was in the days of slavery. Every
slave who attempted to gain his freedom and
was intercepted in the act in one of the I"" free""
States was paraded in just the same style as
these present outrages-as so much political
capital. But what they hailed as political
capital was the very thing that showed up the
sin of the peculiar institution and urged
on its overthrow, with the party that sustain
ed it.


Already some Of the journals of the South
are learning that TOO much lOoseness is being
allowed to these cases Of lawlessness, and that
there is not the political hope arising from
them that may seem on the surface. The
LSuH Is CUuluB W lulS OplulOus IL
refers to the two cases of lynching that occur.
red last week, one in Augusta, Ca, and the
other in Martinsburg, w. Va. In both o.
these cases negroes, upon prOvocations, killed
white men and were lynched. 1t was no "" wal
of races"" but pure prejudice that lead to the
affair in both cases. The Sun comes to th,
following conclusion in the matter, and we copy
l. O.. Al
cannot be doubted. 1t says:


Both cases occurred in old and long settled
communities, where all the agencies aud ma
chlnery OF criminal justice were in full opera
ton, and where there was no pretense that tn
constituted authorities were either unable o
unwilling to administer justice and execute tn
law. lO both instances the unhappy victim
OF mob violence were negroes, in cOmmuni
ties were the whites we're largely in the ma
jOrity, and where none OF the terrOrs and con
sequent provOcation to take the law into thei
own hands existed, which are found in som
of the exposed districts of the South, wher
The white population is largely outnumbereC
and where the administration Of the law
the hands OF ignorant blacks affords no SECT
rity for either life or property. Mo
violence was resOrtcl - not because the ""lyncl
ers' feared the law 9,l' not have due cOurs
but because they unwilling that it shou
nave due course. Inc TACT that Il
victims mentioned in both cases we hear
were negroes, is also unfortunate, in view
the example which the white race in the Sou
especially owes to the colored, OF patient su
mission to the law and confidence in its deere
and forms of procedure.


That is the way a conscientious Southe
paper talks about two Of the cases over viii
our Democratic papers have set up such
howl about war of races"" There are II
other of these cases, viz the one in Tennesse
where drunken white man rode up to a EeR
and shot him down for no reason than that t
white man was drunk, and the exaggerated CT
at Austin, Miss, in which il has been herald
abroad that the negroes wero arming to 81
the white people. The Sun says this lat
case was an exaggeration and need not have
CURED. The negroes thought that VIII
man, d.. Smith, purposely killed mel
child and was not going to be tried. III
raised complaint and the whites armed the
selves. Many of the negroes then left


town, ""to get reinforcements"" it was te
grsphed, but their real object was to keep Fl
being shot by the whites, as it has since ira
pired. There was no war of races"" in


OF these affairs. They oil resulted from Ia
administration Of government or through


intrigues of politicians We find all the

a misnomered Democratic sheet, we learn
that the Confederate flag"" is still dis
played on the James river; but CORE
spondent of that paper explains that it
floats from the staff of boat ''rowed by
"" two rebel boys and steered by an urchin
&"" of four"" We want no better evidence
than this of the insincerity of the professions
of a return to loyalty of particular indtVid-
uals interested in this foolish display of the
emblem of treason against the General
Government. When parents write COM
munications to the press, in which they
deliberately characterize their children as
'srebel boys"" we cannot deny the charge
so frequently made that the people Of the
South, or rather certain classes of them,
still yenerate the 'lost cause"" so much as
to seek to perpetuate the fallacious and
reasonable theories of the rebellion with
the rising generation. 1t is said that the
display of the flag in question will do no
harm, that it is a meaningless tribute to an
exploded and almost forgotten sentiment
and that it is not worthy of public attention
and discussion; but the truth is that four
year old boy, ""whose curly head now rests
| in the folds of a tiny Confederate flag, ""
may grow to be q man whose strong arm
and earnest desire may be devoted to the
success of that flag within the lifetime of
those who are now resting after the bloody
contest of our late civil war under quiet
belief that their victory over the rebelsof the
South was complete. GAS the twig is bent
the tree will grow"" is an old, true,
and, to this case, a pertinent saying
It is so pertinent that we cannot fail to
find in it reason for the belief that the four
year-old, as well as his two rebel brothers,
have been taught to revere the doctrine OF
secession and 10 deride the sentiment Of true
LOYALTY. But the incident suggests some
things connected with the homesteads and


iresides of the Southern people. 1t shows
too plainly that in this case at least the
teachings of one freside are not in accord
with the public professions of its head. 1t
shows further determination on the part
of a representative of the so-called upper
class, the ''chivalry"" of the State OF Nir'
ginia, not to abandon the theory of seces'
sion, and taken in connection with the well
defined opposition of the Gentleman
party'' of the State to the principles Of Re


pubiicanism, proves that design to con
tinue the rebellion, even in the cradles o


Virginia homes, is not altogether imprac

TO MAY 6.


Little progress was made yesterday in the
investigation OF the murder OF Mrs. Hujus at Manuel
Rockand County. In an interview with TRIBUNE re-
porter n citizen Of Spring Valley said that on Sunday
afternoon he met man on the road that leads from
Manuel to village who exactly answers to the de
scrpton given by MISS Pearce the lady who the mur-
derer ran against when escaping from the yard after
shooting. Michael Murphy, tho supposed murderer,
was taken to New-City by the way OF Tarrytown He
was not taken to Manuel because 1t was feared that an
attempt would be made TO lynch him. HIS brother,
Thomas Murphy, however, was taken to Manuel ana
aferward to New-City. He has the appearance OF
common laborer, is about five feet and four nches IN
hight of light complexion, and wears full blonde
beard.

said that he there to represent the DstrctAt

THE MURDER OF JULIA HAYDEN


Tho ppr,,or NJ JuIia HAYDEN occurred in Trous-
dale Conntv and as she was mulatto girl, engaged
in teaching n negro school, this outrage has been
renresepted throughout the country as having re-
suited from hostility to negro education. AS this
case has also been the subject of careful investiga
ton under the direction of Gov Brown and as this
inquiry has resulted in the indictment Of several
persons who will, no doubt be very soon arrested.
have been able to learn more particularly about the
circumstances attending the death of Miss Hayden
than have yet seen in any newspaper. 1t may not
be generally known at the North, but 1t Is O fact
which any visitor in the South will soon discover
that the negro men, as a class have the reputation
of being thieves and the negro women OF wanting In
chastity OF course there are honest colored
men and yirtuous colored women in every
Southern community, but I suspect that
they are in small minority. Keeping
this fact in mind it may easily be understood why
three young men who had been drinking freely
should stop at the house where Julia Hayden lived,
supposing that she would admit them and submit to
their wishes. But in this they mistaken. for
she refused to open the door. Finding that persua
sion was in vain. they did not so far as can iearn'
make any attack the house or attempt to force
open the door, but turned to 60 away but when they
d
fired his pistol toward the door. The shot passed
through and killed Julia Hayden who happened to
be standing near II was q reckless fiendsh thing
to do and the men engaged in it ought be punished
as they probably will be, but there is no evidence
that the girls occupation or that hostility to negro
schools had anything whatever to do with the hOmi
eide.


TWO GOVERNORS CONTRASrED.


Now why is it that while the Democratic Governor
- hnrn OF hn IfQt
visits the scene where half dozen negroes have
been lynched. calls special session of the Court,
employs detectives secures the best lawyers in the
State to conduct the prosecution and in fact spares
neither time nor expense in his efforts to bring to
punishment the murderers of half dozen OF his
political opponents, the Republican Governor of
Alabama has not yet raised his hand. although &C
cordng to reports sent by his friends to Washing
ton, more than 60 men have been murdered In a
single county for opinions sake Why Is 1t that II
lawlessness and violence prevailed in Western Ala
bama to such an extent as to defy the local and
State authorities, Gov. Lewis did not raise his
voice solemn protest last Spring against
the withdrawal of United States troops If
such state of affairs Hays and Spencer
have described in Washington exists, why has not
the Government called together the Legislature. de-
clared martial law called out the militia, and gone
TO the rescue of his political friends who we have
been told are daily shot down like dogsf The reason
is that Gov. Brown places the life of the citizen
above party success, and values the good name of
his State more than political triumph. But Gov.
Lewis is willing to see the good name of Alabama
dishonored before the world; to capital and i'm
migration turned away from her borders; to see her
people injured in business and reputation. and even
to stand by in silence while her citizens, his party
friends shot down in cold blood, as he has in the
lin ont nj n
State the lies the exaggerations, the murders
ihe can construct q ladder over which to climb for
another term into the office he has dishonored."

in New England and educated in
Great Britain. He lives in Col~

law partner is said to be an ultra
white Democrat, a statement that
we doubt.


A Northern correspondent thus
describes his wife:


His young wife is quadroon,

hue of the Southern magnolia, just
tinted with a suggestion of the
prim roses on cheeks and lips; her
eyes are large, brown and express

Northern Methodist preacher, anc
an editor.


Mississippi has the younges

The Bloody Shirt Preparing for

ing Presidential Message an effort is


to be made to alarm the country again


about Louisiana. According to cor


respondents information, the keynote


is to be struck in this wise ""More


serions trouble is anticipated next Jan


uary than any which has yet occurred


to mar the peace of the State"" This


more serious trouble is to come about


by the lynching of the Returning


Board by the White League, and a


VIOLENT packing of the Legislature in


the Conservative interest by the opera.

which -""facts,"" it is said, 'sare In the


Presidents possession"" and the init.
nation is that they are to be produced
In the message by the President, who,
while he is most heartily disgusted
with the unsettled condition of affairs,
IN which he has the sympathy of the
Attorney-General, recognizes the OBJ
rigatIon riga !"" to prevent anarchy and stay
That the President and the Attorney.
General will seek to cover over the or
lgnal wrong that was done by foisting
the Kellogg Government upon Louisi,
ana through the illegal enforcement of
Judge DurelPs decree-a wrong and an
outrage from which all the subsequent
troubles have fowed-we do not doubt.


The readiest way to do this is to dis
tract the attention of Congress and the
country to the anticipation of new
disturbances. If things are to be al
lowed to flow on smoothly in Louisi-
ana under the tranqulizing effect of
the late elections, there will be moth
ing to stave off the inquiry that must
be instituted, sooner or later, into the
origin OF Kellogg authority and the
reign of Radical faction that under
him usurped the control of the State.


There is nothing in the past-nothing
down to the present moment-that
will serve the purpose of diversion
OF the Inquiry. II can only be accom-
plished by the anticipation of some
greater trouble that will happen in
the future, which will serve to throw
all the complications and troubles of
the past into the shade and afford
preteXt for putting the State under
martiallaw. The invention of ""plots'
is an easy trade, and even in this intel
ligent country and enlightened age it
has sometimes been successful one.
On this occasion it will fail.


In the meantime, while waiting for
| the evidence that is to disclose this
| greater trouble"" we have Just two


things to say. All our information


leads us to feel entirely assured that
| the Conservative classes and tho Dem


ocratic party of Louisiana will do


nothing whatever that their friends In
the North would have occasion tn re-


grct, either in the organization of


their Legislature or in any other mat


ter. They may be hampered with le-
| gal difficulties; which have sprung


from the original violence that was
| done to their public affairs by the i'm
proper interference of the Federal
Executive, and by the uncertainties
| that have been created in their laws.


But they will have no disposition to


solve these difficulties by violent meth


ods, because they, as everybody else,


must know such solution can accom-
Iplish nothing."

where the local statutes fail. They are in
tended to supplement State legislation, whereas
Mr.. Williams assumes that they supersede it.
Justice Bradley in his opinion in the Grant
Parish case quotes the same passage from
Justice Grier which Mr.. Williams cites, but he
also says: This power Ito enforce the &llith
Amendment does not authorize Congress to
""pass laws for the punishment of ordinary
crimes and offenses against persons of the
""colored race or any other race. That be-
""longs to the State Government alone. All
ordinary murders, rObberies, assaults, thefts,
land offenses whatsoever are cOgnizable only
ain the State Courts, unless indeed the State
should deny to the class OF persons
referred to the equal protection of the laws.
""Tben of course Congress could provide rem
""edies for their security and protection. But
in ordinary cases, where the laws of the
State are not obnoxious to the provisions
"" of the amendment, the duty of Congress Ill
""the creation and punishment of Ofenses Is
""limted to those Offenses which aim at the
deprivation of the colOred citizens enjoy
""ment and exercise of his rights of citizen
I"" ship and of equal protection of the laws,





edition of servitude."". The indictment OF the
Grant Parish murderers attempted to meet
this point by count alleging ""a conspiracy
""to deprive certain citizens of African de-
""scent of their lives and liberties without
""due process of law"" But, says Justice
Bradley: every murderer and robber
""does this. Congress surely is not vested
""with power to legislate for the suppression
""and punishment of all murders, robberies,
""and assaults committed within the States""
Here is precisely the same sophistlcal pretext
upon which the Gibson County arrests are
based swept away Certain negroes. in jail
for murder, were taken out and lynched. just
as. we are sorry to say, hundreds of prisoners,
black and white, have been before in various
parts of the United States. The Governor
offered reward for the apprehension of the
assassins, and his officers seem to have pur-
sued them with zeal and fidelity; but IN
stepped the Marshal with a company OF SOL
diers, and took the case out of the Governors
hands.


The Enforcement Acts can be made to cover
almost any transaction to which negro or
politician is a party. In Alabama we have
seen the United States Courts enacting the
shameful farce of indicting certain persons for
conspiracy to prevent Mr.. Billings from voting
by killing him three months before the cleo
ton. In nearly all the reconstructed States 1t
is O common thing to bring the merest street
rows land drunken quarrels within the pro-
visions of these Enforcement laws, and the
tendency to ignore the jurisdiction of the
State grows constantly stronger and stronger.
The danger of this reckless course is mani
fold. It imposes an unjust and sometimes
crushing burden upon tho accused, who are
taken great distances for trial and compelled
to transport witnesses at their own expense ;
it throws a vast and illegitimate power into
the hands of petty Federal officials and it i'm
perils the cause of justice for it is extremely
doubtful whether convictions obtained by a
forced construction of questionable laws will
stand the test of appeal."

On Monday, two members OF Congress from
Mississippi made rather remarkable speeches
on the condition of political affairs in the
South. Both men are persons OF some note,
""A the representatives of the two great classes
into which Southern society has always been
divided and in both speeches we find matter
not only for immediate interest but for care
full thought. Mr.. l.. O. G. Lamar in old times
was n typical planter and fire-eater. He left
Congress to take a seat in the Convention
which voted Mississippi out of the Union. He
was a colonel in the Confederate Army. He
was diplomatic envoy from the Confederacy
to Russia. He is a man of culture and a Pro-
fessor in the University of Mississippi. No
one could be better qualified to speak for the
class which ruled the South before the war;
and which still embraces nearly all the eduCa-
ton and social refinement of that unfortunate
region. 1t is only few weeks since Mr..
Lamar won the respect of the whole country by
his noble tribute to the memory of Charles Sum-
ner; he deserves no less honor LOT his address
on Monday, in which he reiterated those sent-
ments of union and brotherhood which, in spite
of the bloody past and the cruel expressions
of the present, do unquestiOnably animate the
Southern white population. Mr.. Lamar con-
fessed not only that the Lost Cause was lost
beyond all hope of recovery, but that the war
had utterly Overthrown the principle upon
which it was founded. Secession, hereafter,
was not merely impracticable and unwise, but
it was false in theory, and repugnant to the
well-settled principles of the American Gov
ernment. Slavery was not merely destroyed.
but it was acknowledged on all hands to be
gigantic wrong which the South would not
restore if it had the power. And with the
downfall of Slavery the South recognized the
full personal and political rights of the freed
men, and the sacred force OF the Constitu-
tional Amendments enacted to secure their
privileges. But Mr.. Lamar spoke with honest
indignation of the outrageous abuse OF the
Federal power i'm the reconstructed States (the
contested election case of Sheridan against
Pinchback being the subject of dcbate), and
warned his Republican hearers that ""no party
""cOuld endure tho infamy and disgrace that
chad been brought upon the American name
""by those grotesque caricatures of the Gov
""ernment."" All which was strictly true ana
most proper to be said.


On tIle Sa1no uty, MI VI MiSoiooipPi
made speech in the Republican caucus,
where the faithful were discussing the pros
poets of the party for the next campaign, and
considering what principles it should profess
during the canvass, or whether it was prudent
to profess any at all. Mr.. Lynch Is young
negro, born in slavery. He was entirely with
out education until the Union armies at
Natchez made him a cOntraband. Then he
picked up little schooling, and after the war
was made a justice of the peace under the
carpet-bag government of Gen. Ames. From
one Office to another he worked his way along
until he got to Congress. He seems to be
type of the shrewd, glib, active, ambitious
colorcd men i'm whom Northern adventurers
find their aptest allies and instruments in the
manipulation of the Southern satrapies. We
know nothing discredtable to him personally.
but there can be no question of the class to
which he belongs. Mr.. Lynch spoke of the
Civil Rights bill, and he was of course not
we'll pleased at the manner in which the
House had treated it but he assured the cau-
Gus of the strict party fidelity OF the cOlOred
people. There was to be no reconciliation be-
tween them and their old masters. They
would not believe that Slavery was beyond
revival. They would not trust q Southern
white man with their liberties. They cared
comparatively little for honesty in Ofiice-this
at least was the general drift of his address
they could pardon fraud, corruption, licen-
tlOusness, anything mean or disgracoful, to an
orthodox Republican politician; and they
would sooner vote for a thief like Moses than
an upright gentleman like Lamar. These are
the conclusions logically to be drawn from the
remarks of Mr.. Lynch, as We cOllate them
from the reports of the various papers, and it
will be seen that they are equivalent to no
tice to the party that it may nominate any
rascal they please, and the Southern negroes
will swallow him.


These two speeches are the platforms of the
two contrasted forces between which the
future of the South remains to be decided-one
caring little for party and everything for
pure and honest Government, the other valu-
ing party above everything and official integ-
rity not at all. We need not ask which offers
the country the fairer prospect of peace and
prosperity. But we ask the Northern Repub-
licans if they have no moral duty to fulfill
toward their ignorant colored wards, and if it
will not be their fault if Republication in the
reconstructed States become merely q syno-
nyme for fraud and embezzlement

ST. BRIDGET'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH.
The Fitch-sherman Bridal Party


Father Mooney on the Loss OF tho


Soul.


St. Brdgets Roman Catholic church, corner OF
avenue and Eighth street. was the scene yes
terday morning of such crush as Is rarely wit
messed even within the walls OF u Catholic church.
The occasion was the celebration OF q solemn high
mass. but the special attraction was the TACT that
Lieutenant and Mrs. Fitch faaee Sherman) were ex-
pected 30 be present. Lieutenant Fitch was born
and brought up in st. Bridget's parish. 1t was in
st. Bridget's church he received his first commu-
nion and IN her parochial school the groundwork
OF his education was laid. AS early as
ten O'Clock the church was crowded. The
galleries were crammed and the aisles closely
packed Seats had been reserved for the bridal
party, but 1t soon became problem as TO how
they were to get to them. About quarter
to eleven O'Clock the mother and sister OF the
groom took their seaLs, and the orchestra struck
up the wedding march. passage way was forced
Tor the bride and groom through the centre AISLE
and this was the signal Tor such rush to see the
young couple would have disgraced secular
place OF amusement. Father Mooney was justly
indignant, aud in few terse and well chosen
remarks rebuked those persons who had no re-
spect for the house OF God and who were present
fn Ahnnt halt
past eleven the ceremony oil the mass was CON-
inenced. Father Thomas J. Mooney pastor of the
church, was the celebrant; Father John Lynch,
deacon; Father John Kane, OF the Cathedral, SUBJ
deacon; and Father John Sater, OF the Cathedral,
master OF ceremonies; The mass chosen Tor
tlon, Mozart's Twelfth. and the superb man
ner in Wacn Nv was rendered % % long
privilege OF hearing 1t. The choir consisted OF
Slgnor G. Guell organist and director; Mrs. A.
Jawarski, soprano; Mrs. Gesdortf and Mrs.
Znuhscn, altos; signors Adams and Barbens
Dassos; Messrs A. Exkorm and cannon, SIgnor G.
Cacclnoa, baritone; extra tenor, signor Lotto.
Tney were assisted by q lui chorus the
orchestral part OF Grafullas Band. Indeed, the
musical arrangements were perlect IN every
respect. The rich tones OF the organ, the clear,
ringing voices vi the Choir, combined with the IN
spirltng strains Of the band, poured forth
very walls of the sanctuary. During the service
the choir also rendered the ""iialienjan Chorus""
the robes OF the oillclatlng priests OF the most
elegant and elaborate designs, just IN
ported from Italy, and the ere ceremony was was
CredO Father Mooney preached on the immortal
1ty OF the soul. taking his text from the sixteenth
chapter OF Matthew. Before entering upon his
discourse, Father Mooney, IN o few appropriate
remarks, assured the bride and groom, their rela-
tions anu friends Of their being cordially welcome
at st. Brldgets church.


THE SERMON.


The text of the sermon was ""For what is man
prohted II he shall gain the whole world aud lose
hls own soul, or What shall man give in exchange
Tor MS soul"" This my brethren IS a question
emanating from the lips OF God himself God, not
only the Creator but the Redeemer the universe.
Wnen Jesus irst put this question He did not mean
destined 1t should be written ndehbly upon the
minds and engraved upon the souls OF men TO the
end OF all time. This question Is daily, yes
hourly, being answered by two classes, Man has q
soul, an immortal soul. That soul he can lose, and
when lost he can never, never recover It, Goa
formed man out OF the dust of the earth. and into
this senseless clay he Infused spirit so beautiful
tnat man was tit to be u companion to God. He
endowed the object he created with will, memory
ana understanding, and these intellectual endow-
ments fitted that soul to associate with Him. BY
the power OF intellect man can soar into the stars
from our own. Heaven Is not too high, the
lightning fash not to quick Tor his intelligence.
there are accessible to him. All of these things
are but evidence OF the fact that the soul was
created not ior the earth, but Tor heaven,
can be lost TO heaven, but then 1t is
gained to he'll read then the value OF mans
immortal soul, not in his achievements here
beow but in the tears of the saviour, in HIS drops
or blood in every lash inflicted and IN every paiig
He suffered. so great was the love He bore us
suffer for us, but He must lay down His life to
us. IL man could only be awakened to reallZa-
tlon OF the Importance OF this subject, this earth,
lnstead OF being Whirlpool OF vice, would be
changed into a steady stream of crystal virtue.
We must all answer this question sooner later.
Ten thousand worlds are no comparison In value
to the worth or one immortal soul. We pamper
the body and seek after worldly richest but once
God has done His part, and now you must do
yours. He puts the question to you, and IN
love and mercy He awaits your answer. Millions
upon millions have been swept down to the
BARK and can be saved II you but will. Keep this
question ringing IN your ears. what will 1t pro-
ut you II you gain all things else and be plunged
into gulf of eternal woes May the blessed spirits
now around the throne OF the Saviour, intercede
Tor you l Will cherish the hope that you Will
this day decide firmly to shun vice and embrace
virtue. Follow the cross and Climb up 1t as by
the angels.


THE BRIDAL PARTY.


After the mass was finished the bridal party,
which consisted of the BRIDE and groom, Mrs.
Maria Patterson, Miss Lizzie sherman, Miss
Philips, Mr.. TDomas sherman and several other
riends passed through the vestry OF the church to
the pastors residence, where they were enter
taned for short time and received congratua-
tions. Mrs. Fitch was dressed IN gray silk, nightly
trimmed with black and large black buttons on
the polonaise. black lace scarf was thrown care
lessly around her neck, and her head was adorned
match the dress, the somDre nues relieved by
small light blue ostrich plume. Gloves were worn
shade lighter than the color OF her dress. Out
side or the parsonage an immense crowd, which
the combined efforts OF several policemen could
scarcely control, mad gathered to catch parting
glimpse oil the bride anu groom."

NEW ORLEANS, Dec. 25. 1874


The Returning Board, In closing Its labor OF can,
vasstng and compiling the vote Of the State given
at the election OF November last, states that It is
but just and proper that the returning ofncers
should give statement OF the dinculties attend.
ant on their labors and the principles laid down,
drawn from law, to direct them in the discharge OF
their duties. In the frst place this election was
very loosely conducted by the Commissioners OF
Election-so much 80 that at not one-tenth Of the
polls in the state were the forms required
by law observed. The law requires that
the Supervisors OF Registration forward to the
returning of1cers the original list OF votes kept
by the Commissioners OF Election. Second-A
statement Of the persons voted Tor and the num-
ber OF votes received by each. and thlrd-the
tally sheets. All OF which the Commissioners OF
Election are required to furnish to the super
visors, and they to forward them to the returning
ofncers. In many cases no lists OF voters were
kept by the Commissioners, or II there were, they
were not forwarded to the Returning
Board by the supervisors, ana many that
were forwarded to the Returning Board were
not signed or sworn to as the law
requires. In many cases there was no statement
OF the persons voted for and the number OF votes
received by them forwarded to the Returning
Board, Tor the reasons that none were furnished
by the Commissioners OF Election to the super
visors. and many that were returned were neither
signed nor sworn to, and in many cases thele
were


NO TALLY SHEETS FORWARDED


to the Returning Board, to ena BILE them to test
the accuracy OF the statement OF the voter, and
In some instances only tally sheets were returned
to the Returning Board, without q list OF voters
or statement OF votes, and they not signed or
sworn to as the law requires. This being the
case, 1t became necessary that the papers received
from the polling places should be carefully
examined. There were over $50 polling
places IN the State, and there was large list of
Candidates, 80 1t became q very laborious duty,
which occupied the Board nearly month, labor
ing from eleven A. N. to four p M. and from seven
to eleven p. NJ. every day. Tue law requires that
in such canvass and compilation returning
board officers shall observe the following
order:-Tney shall compile the first statements
from all polls or voting places at which there
shall have been fair, free and peaceable regstra-
tion and election. Whenever from any poll or
voting place there has been any riot, tumult acts
of violence, intimidation, armed disturbances
bribery or corrupt influences which prevented or
tended to prevent ialr, tree ana peace

tied to vote at sucn poll or voting
place, such returning officers shall not canvass,

such poll or voting place until statements from all
other polls or voting places shall have been can.
vassed and compiled. The Returning Board Of
fcers snail then proceed to investigate the state
ments of riot, tumult, acts Of violence, intlmlda-
ton, armed disturbance bribery or corrupt in-
nuences al any such poll or voting place.


The Board has


FOLLOWED THIS REQUIREMENT


Of the law, as 1t was their imperative duty TO do,
and in examining the proceedings OF the Commits
soners Of Election for warded to 1t by the SUPER
visors. When either Of the counsel appointed py
the political parties objected to the count OF any
poll and laid before the Board any evidence to
sustain such objections such polls passed over
and not canvassed until the Board had compiled
tae vote from all the polls not objected to- In the
progress OF the examination q large number OF
polls were objected TO, including some in twenty.
seven OF the parishes, and in some OF these par
isnes all OF the polls were then objected to- The
grounds OF objection to some OF the polls were
the failure OF substantial compliance with the
law IN conducting the election and making the
returns to the supervisors; to some, that the
returns OF the commissioners mad been changed
alter they had been made to the supervisors;
and, to the far greater number, that the
voters had been intimidated so that they did not
register or vote, or were compelled to vote DIFF
ferently from what they desired. Had the Board
decided that anything like strict compliance
with the forms OF law In holding the election and
making the returns to the supervisors would be
Hqured the erect would have been that so many
OF the polls would have been thrown out that there
would have been no election in the state. The
Board then adopted rule that when the super.
visor had returned any evidence


SHOWING AN ELECTION WAS HELD,


although 1t only be tally sheet unsigned or
sworn to, that In the absence or raul or intim.
datlon 1t would compile the vote as shown by such
evidence or document, 1t may be called evidence.
This decision disposed OF good many protests TO
the reception OF polls but when substantial
iorms ol law had not been observed,
anu evidence oil fraud or intimidation
was produced, the failure OF substantial com.
plance with the forms or law was considered a
badge OF fraud and the pQ,l was rejected We be.
lieve this to be just and reasonable ruie and the
Board strictly adhered 10 1t.
