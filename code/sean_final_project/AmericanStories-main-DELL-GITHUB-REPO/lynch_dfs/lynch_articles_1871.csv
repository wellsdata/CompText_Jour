Gen. ]. r. West was declared the
choice of the Senate on the first ballot,
he having received the majority of the
votes necessary for an election by that
body A-ti@ ---'i 'a''--' -


Mr.. Blackman said that he had just
heard that Gen. j. r. West was chosen
in the House of Representatives by
large majority. Since those in the
House have cast their votes for Gen.
West, the Democrats have discharged
their duties as incumbent upon them,
by voting for T. Green Davidson, but
as it was impossible to elect a Democrat
to fill that position, the Democrats were
now willing to make unanimous the
nomination OF Gen. J. r. West as
United States Senator, which remarks
brought out Senator Mcmillan, who
said that Gen. West was not a partisan
candidate nor recognized any Republt-
can organization, and that he was not
the candidate Of the Republican party
of the State as f'1ffF


Mr.. Pinchback said his candidacy
was simply to test the faith Of the Re-
publican party; that he had no chance
Of election, but wished to see If one of
his race and color had any prospect of
being elected to the United States Sen
ate from the State Of louisiana; that
he labored under misplaced confidence
from the fact that he did not believe
that they represented their constituents
by the vote given.

 THE FIRST LoooMoTIvE.-The first loco- motive that ever did service in the United States is now lying outside of foundry at Carbondale, Luzerne county, Pa. It ought to be preserved somewhere as an interest ing relic of the early days of railroading. The following description of its trial trip, taken from Dr. Hollister's History of the Lackawanns Valley, will be read with in- terest: ..t -

 ''The first locomotive engine introduced and worked in America was run upon the Delaware and Hudson railroad, in the year 1928, and Hone's Dale (named from the late Philip Hone) offered its friendly glen for the purpose of conducting the experi- ment. This locomotive, called the Stour- bridge Lion, was built in England, of the best workmanship and material, and most approved pattern of that date. The road passed out of Honesdale by sharp north westerly curve, with moderate grade, and was carried over the Lackawaxen by hem lock trestlng considered too frail by many to support the great weight of the mysteri- ous looking engine all ready for the haz- ardous journey. naz sfloala Eae-

 'sAs the crowd gathered from far and near, expecting that bridge, locomotive and all would plunge into the stream the moment passage was attempted, no one, dared to run the locomotive across the chasm but Major Horatio Allen, who, amid exu!tation and praise, passed over the bridge and portion of the road in safety. The engine, however was abandoned, as the slender trestlin forming much of the body of the road, sufficiently strong for ordinary cars, was found too feeble for the weight and wear""

 ''Major Allen in his account of the first trip of locomotive on this continent, says: ""As placed my hand on the throttle, was undecided whether would move slowly or with fair degree of speed; but believing thatthe road would prove safe, and prefering if we did go down to go down handsomely, and without any evidence of timidity, started with considerable veloc- ity, passed the curve over the creek safely, and was soon out of the vast assemblage.

 At the end of two or three miles I re- versed the valve and returned without ac- cident, having thus made the first railroad trip by locomotive on the western hemis- phere."" a. hfuls e R

NINTH DAY OF THE WHARTON TRIAL.


ANNAPOLIS, Dec. 15.--ln the Wharton trial,
Charles KetChum, son of the general, testified
that his fathers books showed that Mrs, Whar-
ton owed him twenty-siX hundred dollars. He
had told her so, and she replied that she had
paid the debt in two instalments, half July II,
1870, with one hundred and thirty dollars inter-
est the rest Jan II, 1871, with siXtyfive dollars
interest; and that she, on the latter date, de-
stroyed the notes i'll the generals presence.
There were no witnesses to the transactions, and
she had no receipt for the payment. The wit
ness subsequently visited General Brce's office
with Mrs, Wharton, she desiring to secure the
payment of four thousand dollars in bonds,
which, she claimed, belonged TO her


Brce was astonished at the demand, and told
her that Gen. ketchums books showed that she
was in his debt $1,000, and there was no evidence
that Gen. Ketchum was in her debt $1,000.
BriCe asked when she had given the bonds to
Gen. Ketchum; she said about eighteen months
ago. Brice asked what kind OF bonds they
were; she replied, four One-thOusand dollar
500 bonds, to be converted into 10-40's for
safe keeping Gen, Brice then asked about
the S2600 when she made the same statement
as to witness. Gen. Brice asked in what man
MOI & hn moi m 10 TpnIipl n
backs. Gen. Brce asked il she was not afraid
to carry so large a sum of money about her;
she said no. She was asked if she had any
receipt or any witness to the transaction; she
answered no; was asked if Mrs. Chubl did
not know something about it,; she replied
that no one knew anything about it.


Brice then told her there was no possible
means of getting the bonds at that time, as the
estate of Gen. Ketchum was in court, and If her
trip to Europe depended upon getting the bonds
she had better give up all hope of going She
received this announcement with no apparent
concern or emotion. The witness stated to Mrs
Wharton that, on the 23d of June, the day pre-
vous to his fathers leaving for Baltimore, while
at his fathers house, he asked his father if Mrs.
Wharton had paid the money due him, when
his father answered that she had not; that when
she was in Washington, the Tuesday previous,
she told him she had some misunderstanding
with her daughter, and could not pay him; had
asked Mrs. Chubb, himself and witness to spend
Saturday with her in Baltimore and promised
to pay him that day.


His father said he had no objection to her
keeping the money as long as she remained in
the country, as she paid good interest; knew
she was in delicate health, he might never see
her again, and he might need the money to help
pay for his house; witness asked Mrs. Wharton
how she had received the interest on the bonds,
and she replied, in gold, greenbacks and coupons,
at different times, which my father paid her;
witness went with Gen. Wharton to examine The
bonds they found no indication that any be-
longed to Mrs. Wharton they also looked
among the papers for some evidence that the
payments were made by Mrs. Wharton, but
none were found; witness had not seen Mrs.
Wharton since that time, July 4th, until in the
court houre; the amount of bonds was $50 100,
all in ten-iorties; witness said his father bought
a house in Washington, June 18th, for 81 900,
for which he had a receipt for the payment in
full. A cancelled cheek for the amount was
shown, but objected to by the defence.


Witness continued On the occasion of bis
going to Baltimore for his fathers effects, Mrs
Wharton took him to a room where his father
died, showed him valise, umbrella and hat
she then went down stairs and returned with Il
key and other small articles; he opened the va
lse in Mrs. Wharton's presence, taking out
the clothes and searching the pockets to see if
he could find her note; he found nothing; his
father never used drugs or laudanum.


The prosecution now offered in evidence the
books kept by Gen Ketchum, to show the in
debtedness of Mrs. Wharton.


The defence objected, and the argument lasted

Railroad. AS the regular passenger train, which
left this city yesterday for Greenve, neared
Smiths Branch. at Ex-Grbble the engineer
observed o man walking on the trestiework armed
with q double-barrelled shotgun. When the train
came up with him he stepped OFT the track and, de-
liberaely drawing his gun TO his shoulder. dis
charged both barrels at the engineer and fireman in
rapid succession, The engineer who had no idea the
villain was IN earnest when he ievelled
the gun at him, stood and received the contents of
the gun full in the face, not even moving his head
within the carriage in rear OF the engine Both his
eyes were destroyed, ana the buckshot with which
the gun was loaded are said to have penetrated the
brain. Both The fremen were also badly wounded.
The train was at stopped and reversed, and rs
1t put back towards this city the assassin stood
cooy reloading his gun, but did not make any other
attempt 10 fire. The employees on the uan being
unarmed made no attempt 10 arrest the villain. The
engineer VIII die, and the fremen are badly
wounded. The outrage created the most intense
excitem ens among the passengers. A sherins posse

The driver of the truck which took the body to the depot, noting the accounts in the papers, at once went to an officer and told the following story: He said that as he was waiting at his usual stand, young woman accosted him and said to the Hudson River Railroad Depot. He had asked her for the service $1.50, but upon her demurring, he had con- sented to carry the trunk for $1. The woman said she was going to Chicago that afternoon, and she would he at the depot, to receive the trunk which he would find at No. 697 Second-ave, in the basement. She then left him. He immediately went to the house men | toned and knocked at the basement. It was opened by stout fleshy man, apparently foreigner, who appeared to understand his mission. The truckman detailed the particulars which have al- ready been given, and with the officer went to the house from which the trunk was taken, and it was discovered to be the residence of Jacob Rosenzweig, a pretended doctor, known to have com mitted the crime of abortion, who was found at home, but who on the approach of the officer attempted to escape. The officer was too quick, however, for his bur]y adversary, and seized him securely before he had got into the street. A orowd of loafers seemed to detect in an instant the fact that Rosenzweig had been arrested for murder. The Doctors profession was so notorious that his connection with the trunk murder was immediately surmised, and the crowd gathered around crying ""Lynch him lynch him."" Rosenzweig upon arriving at the station-house denied all know ledge of trunk having been taken from his house on the previous Saturday, and I on being confronted with the truckman I denied ever having seen him.

 The body has been identified as that of Alice Bowlsby, of Paterson, N. J She was first recognized by doctor who was well acquainted with her, and hi testimony was verified by dentist who had filled her teeth, and knew his. owl work. A handkerchief was subsequently found in Rosenzweig' s house bearing he name, thus making the Identification positive"

The announcement in the HERALD some
days ago in regard to the organization of the
leading committees of the present House OF
Representatives has evoked very general
discussion, and the programme laid down in
our special despatch has been controverted
by number Of newspapers and politicians.
A venerable contemporary declares that the
Committee of Ways and Means will have q
decided majority Of outspoken revenue re-
formers, while the journals in the protectionist
interest are equally clear that only high tariff
men will compose it. All are united in OPP
posing Mr.. Dawes appointment as Chairman,
some taking the ground that that gentleman
would hesitate in accepting the place because
he would thereby incur the enmity of Judge
Kelley and General Garfield, and others
assert that Mr.. Shellabarger, of Ohio, will
be the coming man. Pennsylvania is very
willing to sacrifice Mr.. Dickey's advancement
to the Craftsmanship Of the Committee on
Appropriations If she can thereby secure the
control of the revenue and the manipulation
of the tariff question, and Garfield would





stand In the shoes once filled by General
Schenck Nobody is satisfied, as it was not
to be expected anybody would be, and the
only effect of the quarrel, If it goes on as it
has begun, will be to make Speaker Blaine
adhere to his original determination.


Al least one journal is apparently satisfied
with the Speakers programme, and it, strange
to say, is the organ of General Butler Con-
soling itself for the fact that the Essex cham
pion is to be compelled to take back seat,
it boldly declares that ''where McGregor sits
Is at the head Of the table,"" This is such q
charming way Of making the best of an un-
pleasant situation that we commend it alike to
the revenue reformers and the protectionists,
and ask them to possess their souls in patience
while Mr.. Blaine is tempering the character
of the committee with non-committalism.
After seeing what he has seen in the past few
days he will be more likely than ever to
adhere to his original programme, and insist
upon making Mr.. Dawes the leader of the
House.


Looking at the matter calmly and carefully
we are brought to the conclusion that the
Speakers programme is a political necessity.
There are three vacancies in the committee as
before constituted, occasioned by the absence
of Schenck, of Ohio; Allison, of Iowa, and
Mccarthy, of New York, from the Forty
second Congress. As the committee now
stands Hooper, of Massachusetts,, has the
strongest claims to the Craftsmanship, but it
would be mere madness to put him at the head
of the committee. 1t is seriously questioned
whether Dawes has the ability to lead the
House, but Hoopsr's inability to do it is
scarcely matter of doubt. And, after all, this
idea of the leadership of the House
is, to great degree, fictitious. Who was
the leader when Mr.. Morrill,, of Vermont, was
Chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means
and Thaddeus Stevens Chairman Of the Com
mttee on Appropriations? What grounds are
there for assuming that Mr.. Shellabarger
would make better leader than Mr.. Dawes |?
The Massachusetts Congressman has filed
more important places than the venerable
member from Ohio. The one was for a long
time Chairman Of the Committee of Elections
and at Stevens death he succeeded to Stevens
place. The other has never been chairman Of
any important committee. Whe1 Mr.. Shella-
barger was in Congress before he was q
member of the Committee of Elections, and
now the absence of Mr.. Paine, of Wisconsin,
will open the way for him to become its
chairman; but argue it as we may, there
seems no escape from the conclusions at
which the Speaker has arrived, and which
have already been announced in the HERALD.
His programme is one that was forced upon
him by the existing state of the country and of
parties and interests in Congress, and should
he attempt a modification he would drift from
the waves of an open sea to the breakers upon
the shore.


the Forty-second Congress will be something
like this chairman of the Committee of
Elections, Mr.. Shellabarger; Chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, Mr.. Dawes !;
Chairman of the Com mittee on Appropriations,
Mr. Dickey; Chairman Of the Committee on
Banking and Currency, Mr.. Hooper; Chair
man of the Committee on Naval Affairs, Mr..
Sargent and Chairman of the Com
mittee on Commerce, Mr.. Lynch. Gar
field and Hooper, and not Dawes
and Shelabarger or Dawes and anybody else
are clearly Mr.. Blaine's Scylla and Charybdis,
and the best thing ho can do with them is to
compel them to ''swap horses"" putting Gar
field in Hooper's place on the Committee Of
Ways and Means, and Hooper in Garfeld's
place as Chairman of the Committee on Bank
ing and Currency. BY this means he will
come as near harmonizing all the opposing ele-
ments with which he must contend as is pos
sible and be able to unite the Gordian knot of
organization without absolutely cutting it.

Stomach",,"We were informed yesterday by Mr..
George "". Lipscombe, who resides about
four and half miles from Lynchburg, on
the Campbell Court House road, that he
saw negro man, DAILY Wigans, who lives
in his Immediate neighborhood, vomit u I
living snake three and half inches in
length. His snakeship wriggled about for
a while after being tjected from the mans
stomach but its life was of short dura-
ton, as it died Il few hours afterwards.


TIE negro is about fifty years Of age,
and has been sick 70, some time, com
planning frequently of sickness about the
ston ach. He IS evidently under the i'm
preston that he has been tricked by some
Of his race, whose i'll will be has engeu-

be genuine black snake.

Our dispatches from Havana and Washing
ton give the particulars of another wholesale
outrage on the part OF the weak Spanish
government 10 the Island of Cuba. Eight
OF the medical students In Havana who
desecrated the grave of General Castaiion
on Thursday last and who were at once ar
rested, were tried by court martial yesterday,
in obedience to the clamors of the volunteers,
found guilty and sentenced in the morning
and shot in the afternoon. There has proba-
bly, never been so outrageously summary
o proceeding transacted, under pre-
tence of law, even in Spanish American
countries. For cruelty aud wantonness
it will cast our Indiana lynching ex-
periences far into the shade. 1t shows
not only the vindictiveness Of the Spanish
volunteers in Cuba and their almost supreme
power over the regularly cons ituted authori-
ties of Havana, but it shows, also, that the
Spanish American people, ignorant, fanatic
and brutal as they are, have not sufficient
sense of the value Of human life to be en-
trusted with the government OF others. In no
other nation under the sun, civilized or savage,
neither in Mexico or the Fijis, would such
number Of young men, the rising strength of
the nation, have been so suddenly and remorse-
lessly butchered, for crime comparatively
SO insigni6cant-a mere youthful indiscretion,
doubtless-or to satisfy so unreasonable
demand for vengeance as the volunteers sent
up in their rage. Such mockery of govern
ment is not only unfit to govern at all, but it
is unfit to be trusted by the other Powers Of
the globe. The United States should not
leave her commercial interests in Havana
and her numbers of citizens carrying
on business in that city or else visiting
it for the winter exposed to the unruly
temper Of this volunteer mob. Indeed,
our Consul General has already cause to fear,
and has telegraphed for ship-of-war or two
to protect the Americans and American in
terests which he has in charge. The fact that
there is only one ship near at hand-the Nip
sic-and that it was sagely debated in the
Presidents Cabinet yesterday whether they
had not better have the monitor Terror towed to
Havana from Key West are enough to show
how lily appointed is our naval service in the
West Indies. Finally Admiral Lee was
ordered to depart at once, but il was doubtful
whether he would 60 in the Severn or wait
for the fitting out of the Worcester. Alto
gether the muddle in which the United States
Navy finds itself at this sudden threatening
of hostilties in Cuba is almost as disgraceful
as the wanton murder of the students by the
volunteers themselves."

 FAITHLESs HUSBAND.

 The other case is this: A poor woman came to me. sick, downeast, heartbroken, under the shadow of a great impending crime, to ask for counsel. Her husband, whese unfaithfulness she long had known. had just sent word to her that she should mend and make ready his linen. and pack his trunk. and that at certain hour he would call for it, as he was intending to live with woman whom he had selected for his mistress. All day long she sat among her children, working through her tears at such task as was ever a wife set upon before? and now she had come to me to ask If there was no law to hinder this awful calamity. I was obliged to tell her No! If she had lived in Connecticut, in Massachusetts. Ohio. if she had lived al- except in England. or under these tradi- tions of English jurisprudence. the law would have laid its hand on the shoulder of f io foh hokf flo frck oe deed, and warned him that he could ven. s;e-.-a f,silS Of f~se.y- Rnt thnsA -~e had revised code, and an advanced civil ization, and adultery is lawful-not even punishable by fine of ten dollars. And 90 I counselled her to go home again and finish mending and the packing, and meek ly and gently without upbraiding, to say goodbye to the husband of her youth, and make up her mind to labor on alone Ill her sickness to support her worse than orphan ed children, and put her trust in God who, though kings are false and states may cow ardly and meanly betray the cause of the helpless, hath declared himself to be the father of the fatherless, and the widows judge. That was New York law. Mary land law is worse, by as much as adds in- suit to injustice.

 THE IMMEDIATE RESULTS.

 have now stated to you the facts con- corning the condition of the law touching crimes against the family. By.and,by, if there be time, may say something con corning the causes that have lead to the origination and perpetuation of such monstrous series of legislative abuses. But just now ask your attention to the results, T snkn l nd t- ton of the laws. s,..s.. .

 l. l will not insult your intelligence by citing facts to prove, what no one will against such crimes is attended with vast increase of them. a

 2. Neither will argue with you to show penal law against this whole class of offen-- egory of personal differences, tends to the the consciences of the people. Will any. public comment in this community upon these base and dreadful and infectious crimes? Gan any one inform me how much of the staple evening reading of our fam. flies is made up of the daily infamies that SkO SA0A0SsSsC0 AA knO GOM4Au4lUy uEOEy into numerous adveE lures by the small newspaper, wits who exercise their ribaldry therein? Fools, who make mock as sinl Bnt consider. O citizens who groan and grumble at this nuisance, what excuse they have, to whom the majesty of the State itself has set so eminent an example, and whether it is altogether strange that they should somewhat better the instruc- ton.

 ASSASSINATION INEVITABLE.

 3. But the most miserable consequence of the dereliction of the State in it's duty of punishing crime, is that which is exem plied in that great class of bloody assas- sinations to which a new case has just been added in this State. The sure and infal. lable result of the abdication by ysociety of the duty of pnnishing criminals is not that crime becomes innocence, and that the and hearts of men are revolu- tionized by stroke of reformatory legisla- tion and the abhorrence of the guilty abol- the result is this, that the exer- else of punishment, which should be firm ly and temperately held by the hand of or derly and impartial justice, is delivered over to the wild justice of the mob or of the lynch court, or to the more frantic hand of private vengeance Where, tell me, lies the great safeguard of the public order in times of great public indignation against atrocious crime, or of the wild stirring of revenge for the fighting of a personal"

Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord.''5 And when human government cannot make like apI peal, armies and constabularies are of no avail. The instinct of wild justice fings1 aside police clubs like grass, and leaps with an irresistible fury upon it's victim. Who has ever known lynch law to pre- vail, and private revenge and assassination to abound, in communities where strong and faithful government is quick to Hollow crime with thorough trial and adequate penalty? Such acts as these are the oppro- brium of any government, as it is written, ''Whosoever judgeth his brother judgeth the law"" The murderer of every assassin. ated malefactor, of every victim of the hasty sentence of the lynch coRrt, is re- corded to the shame of derelict State.

 What now has the State of Maayland to say for the sesnrity of public order against the instincts of private revenge and pub lie justice outraged by the infamous crime of the ssducer or adulterer? When for gery has been tampering with your bank account she rebukes your headlong re- venge, saying This is my business. She lays her hand upon the enlprit, and filings h1m into a felon's dungeon. and clothes him in disgrace and casts him forth from the honors of the citizen. When murder has broken into your dwelling. or, raging in the streets, has made the very stones to cry out with the voice of brothers blood, she stretches out her sword to suppress the tumult of the outraged citizens, and points to the gallows and the executioner, saying Vengeance is mine"" But when lust and adultery are neighing at your door, and defling the sanctuary of your home, des. polling you of treasures which cannot be valued with gold. embittering your life with bereavement such as the clumsy arts of the murderer could never have ac. complished has the majesty of this sovereign State to say to her subject whose bosom is boiling with grief and just re-t venge? What, but to pat him on the shoulder and tell him ""be quiet, now; be cool! There may be money in this thing if you will manage 1t right"" O foolish peo- pie hear the word of God, if you will not re gard the voice of your brothers blood, ""Jealousy is the rage of man, therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance. He will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content though thou givest many gifts"" Proverbs vi: 34 and 35. .ssg

 fJo! tJo! Lot not the State that at- tempts to abrogate the law of God, and erect adultery into Q lawful act, think that thereby it protects the criminal from hurt It puts him under law more sanguinary than the code of Draco. It initiates from that moment common law stronger than any statute, which does more than author. ize assassination which invites scorn upon all law and all authority implies that the law shall be affronted and insulted in its own courts, misinterpreted by its own expounders. and that juries are to kiss the book to solemn oaths, in open expecta- tion that they shall perjure themselves be. fore they leave the box, and march forth under the applause of the people.

 THE LAW AS STATED BY THE ATTORNEY

 GENGHA1

 With great clearness of statement the acute and able Attorney General of the State in the late trial thus defined, in the form of an imaginary statute, the principle under which it must have been obvious to him that the prisoner against whom he ap- peared was to be acquitted. Enacted into the form of law it would read thus: ""Ev. cry person, upon being informed that his wife, daughter or sister had been seduced in- to intercourse with any man, shall be and he is hereby constituted grand jury, court, petit jury, sheriff and executioner, fully authorized and empowered upon such in- formation as he may choose to believe, to condemn, and at his convenience, and by any means or instrument or weapon of death he may choose, to put such man to death, without 8 moments notice or warn ing, and this shall be deemed and held iustiiable homicide"" Against such an he said. common sense and ,ommon reason would protest.

 A PUNaENT PARAPHRAsE..

 Yes: but Mir. Attorney General and cit. 1 izens of Maryland, hbat is hbe laaO. It has not been engrossed on parchment; it has perhaps not been enunciated from the Bench-but it is the law; and while the rest of the statute and thecommon law book continues as it is,you may argue in vain to break the uninterrupted series, if not of judicial decisions, Ut least of jury verdicts. by which 1t is sustained. It is . fierce and cruel law. It is law that makes no dis as the Mosaic law does, be. tween the grades of these crimes of i'm purity which it punishes It is-a most in effective law, atoning for the general im- punity of the worst crimes that infest so- ciety by now and then an outburst of dead ly fury. But 1t is the laaO, for all this, and will continue to be. so long as the only al- that you have to offer for it is the more naonstrous absurdity of such law as this: ,4aa a5 aa4AasE aaeis 4sla <

 ""Any person committing adultery shall on conviction be punished only by fine of not more than ten dollars Seduction, prostitution and all other crimes against chastity and against the peace. purity and honor of the family shall be free from all punishment; ard any person committing them shall be protected by the power of the State from all violence, damage or an, noyance which may be attempted in con sequence against his person or estate, { whether by personal or by public yen- geance. and shall be eligible as before to all officers of honor and emOlument.""

be seen magnificent painting by Harry
Brown, which has lately been disposed of to q
gentleman in Cincinnati. 1t is in Harry's best
vein. The scene represented is off Cape Split,
Nova Scotia. On the right rises up sheer from
the angry waves, moaning and beating around
its base, precipitous cliff, to the height of
several hundred feet. Then comes level ex-
panse covered with verdure, on which are
pitched the tents of the tourists, and again,
above this plain, the cliff ascends, attaining a
tremendous altitude. Far out towards the hor-
zion stretches the cliff, coming to an abrupt
termination in the distance, broken off short,
aud beyond this arise from the water several
fragments of rock, the first OF which, shaped
like an irregular pyramid, rivals the cliff itself
in height, and is surrounded by other rocky
fragments, forming colossal group. Over the
broken SUBMITS the sea gulls futter in hun
dreds, while round their bases the billows break
and thunder, throwing the spray aioft in clouds
Of foam. The atmosphere, and all the details.
are worked up with great care. We hear that
another picture has been ordered from Harry,
representing the same vicinity, by gentleman
of this city.


AT Hale's also may be seen fine photograph
Of Hon. John Lynch, by King. and beautiful
little picture by Brown, entitled ""Ouiet Fish"

This story comes from Sharp Mountain, in
Pennsylvania: Two young girls a few days ago
left smaller one, about four years old, alone
under tree for a short time, and on returning
to the spot found the little one standing still and
speechless-neither replying to their questions
nor wishing to leave the spot. They finally car
ried her home against her will, where every
question was asked and effort made to make her
speak, but inYain, until they inquired if she had
seen a snake when she Immediately went into
convulsions, with which she has been afflicted
at intervals ever since.


But few weeks since, says the Lynchburg
Yirginian, there was hardly a squirrel to be seen
in days journey, for they were rusticating in
the cliffs and hollows of the Blue Ridge, and
living on the buds of the poplar tree. But no
sooner does the wheat get ripe enough to be
eaten, than they come down from the mountains
like the locusts in the days of Pharaoh, and
threaten TO give the farmers serious trouble.
This is more especially the case in the mountain
districts of Bedford, Botetourt and Amherst.

mountains.


Mr.. John D. Fries, of South Coventry town
ship, Penn, is trying the experiment of raising
an eagle, Matched by hen. The Pottstown
Ledger gives the following account: ""About a
month ago, while on Nice's HILL he saw large
bird fly up from lonely place among the rocks.
Proceeding to the spot he discovered two eggs,
of nearly the size and appearance of turkey eggs,
which he picked up, brought home and placed
under setting hen. About two weeks ago the
eggs were Matched out, and Mr.. Fries was aston
ished to find that they were eagles The old
hen must have been considerably surprised, too,
for she spluttered about and tramped upon one
of her rare progeny and killed it. The other
one will probably grow up and do we'll Eagles
sometimes carry off chickens, and it would be
rather joke if this specimen would some day
gather up the old hen that hatched it and fly
away with her."""

ravished her person, and afterward took her

The child told her story to Mrs. Potter, who at
once informed some friends who had the negro

So great was the excitement, caused by the
outrage, among the citizens, that they collect

with his deputies persuaded the men to depart.
A second attempt was made by force of from
one thousand to fifteen hundred persons, to
force the Jail with battering rams, but the
Sheriff had made his preparations, and his
posse being well armed the rioters were resist

The DefaIcations Mt the Treasury Depart


mCah


A resolution viii be offved in the House to-mor-
row by Mr.. Lynch. Chairman OF the Committee on
Expenditures an the Treasury Department., instruct
ting that comrittee to make an investigation into
the late detacations in Treasurer Spinner's Office
and report to the Hease now matters stand in that
office and what measures are necessary TO the bet
ter protection OF the deposits In Jhe Treasury.
Mr.. Lynch has communicated his purpose
TO General .ptnner and Mr.. Boutwell,, and
these officeIs have invited him TO 60 ahead with
his investigation and make It as thorough as he
picases. This Is the only answer that they could
make with pr0priety, but, for all that they are a
little piqued au the offlclousness OF Congressman
Lvnch In cutting out work for committee that has
had no other existence tRan its name In the men,
ory OF the oldest innabttant OF the capital Besides
they were doing the work Of investigation them
selves and as General Spinner claims to be respon
sibe for the amount OF any defalcatlons In mis-
once, the action Of Representative Lynch is re-
garaed to some extent as q rejection upon them.
selves. But Mr.. Lynch no more intends that Mr..
Blaine shall put him OUT OF sight by assigning him
to an obscure committee than General Butler does
and as his successful management OF the special
committee OF the last Congress on the decline OF
American commerce mas not brought him to what
he had right to expect in this Congress he intends
making the most OF what he has got, and the
general impression IL that he will succeed. The
proposed resolution Will give him ample powers
however restrictive It's formal terms. and the
Treasury Department affords wide field Of explora-
tion. MIR. Lynch does not offer report contain


ing lvelier reading than Senator Patterson's report
on the New York Custom House he will disappoint
those VINO know hts energetic character, as well
as those who think they know the department TO
be Investigated. With such leaders as Butler and
Lynch-each with grievances to stir up their ag-
gressivencss-ths Is to be the day Of small commit
tees in Congress. as past sessions have been the
day OF small men and smaller measures.


Resumption of specie Payments.


The bill introduced by Senator Sumner for the
resumption Of specie payment has awakened a new
interest in the proposition to put currency Oh q
gold basis, aud ne has already received many letters
from prominent merchants encouraging him to
pcrsevere In the good work inaugurated.
To-day letter was read by MIN from
one Of the leading members OF the National
Board of Trade, now in session in st. LOUIS, in
which the views OF that body are concisey expressed
In the following quotation:-


1--WE lind among the members general determi-
nation not TO be satisfied with a meie declaration
that specie payment ought TO be speedily resumed,
but an attempt win be made to suggest definite
plan""


Senator Sumner is assured that something will be
done at this session to wipe out the difference be-
tween paper and gold dollar


Attorney General Aikcrmn and the Cabinet.


Attorney General Akerman has said nothing
to the President about his leaving the
Cabinet. has the President SAID anything to Mr..
AKerman on the subject Members OF Congress
and others have, however, freely expressed them
selves in favor OF change. and are endeavoring to
eject it.


Testing the Claims Of the Southern 10y yaIists.


The Southern Claims Commission are holding back

are anxious TO gain the connde nee OF Congress and

THE PICTURE SALE.-The sale of Harry B.

In our account of the sale yesterday morning
We placed the proceeds for the day previous al
about $4,000. At the time we left the halls
o'clock-that was the case, and we understood
Mr.. Brown that only One-or two more pictures
would be sold, but as tie bidding was well
kept up, although the crowd had very much
thinned out, he concluded to proceed and the
sale ended at 10 o'clock, the receipts being
$500 for LAG pictures.


1t will be seen that the average price of the
paintings was $24 This is doing very vel

The nesting was numsrously at
tended and the large audience was
ably addressed. We copy the
summary given of the speeches Of
Messrs. Revels and Lynch.


Hon. H. r. Revels, late q. s.
Senator, was called for in that
earnest manner that proved the
people desirous Of ofhearing him, and
DR.. Revels responded by an hours
speech, in that earnest. frank, easy
and eloquent oratory of which he
is so eminently characterized. DR..
Revels showed up the bad faith OF
Democracy, as evidenced by the
Democratic Legislature of Oregon
and other States in withdrawing
their sanction to the 18th amend
meht, which had been cheeriully
given by Republican Legislatures
preceding them. =: Dr.. Revels lucid
ly pictured the fact, that where
Democracy was in power, they
were unitedly opposed, and unre-
lenting in the opposition to the
18th amendment yet in the South,
where Republicanism predominates,
Democracy, in order to deceive
colored men, adopted and swallow
ed platforms apparently plausible
and honest /; yet if accepted by
colored men, would prove their
eternal political ruiz. DIR. Revels
though highly esteeming mMy
Democrats personally, yet political
ly, he advised all Republicans, il
Democrats advised. them to steer
left, to be sure and 60 to the right,
and rice versa, and time would
prove that they were in the correct
political channel.


DIR. Revels closed his remarks
with an earnest appeal for Re
publicans to register f; and was
followed by Hon. Jno. R. Lynch
the champion colored speaker Of
his age in Mississippi. Mr.. Lynch
confined his remarks principally to
the Importance of Republicans
coming out in force and registering
and showed that the Democrats
political love and sympathy for the
colored man had ""panned out"" o
little too late ; Democracy had
fought and resisted the colored
mans right of suffrage to the last
moment ; but now that a Repub-
Icon nation had given to all men
who are American citizens the right
of suffrage, Democracy steps up to
the colored man aud says, we are
your only true political friends, &c

was Democratic consistency, but
colored voters could never ""sce it

back way, and walked td the front hack, in
which she and the ladies With her seated them

She said she preferred the other hack, and Wds

was driven rapidly 10 tile iail, Mr.. Crawford

letted. She expressed little surprise at the ac-
tion of the gland jury, denied emphatically her
guilt, and said she felt confident of being able
to establish her innocence.


On the other hand the detectives WHO have
been engaged in working up the case, express ii
as theif 6plhion that the evidence is perfectly
damning. Mrs. Whdttan is Il tall woman, very
slender, with sunken eyes, shdrb check bones

herself as she might be seized at night and die
for want of attention, 1t is, therefore, proba
bic that the request of her daughter will be
granted. The impression scents to he gaining

What Radicalism wants us to do is
to vote the Radical ticket. If we will
DO that, and rc-clect the Grant Admin

negro race into the Atlantic without
mourning the displcasure of the party
in power. We rather think that in
that event they would like to see us do
1T. If we choose to have peace we can
have it by surrendcring the power of
the General Government to Radicalis,n
without resistance. If the Southern
States will go for Grant they will hr
left to manage their local affairs as they
please. Whether that, on the whole.
would be the wiscst policy is question
which those who sec tit to entertain if
may ponder at their leisure. But moth
ing short of that will be satisfactory."

gan to assume so serious an aspect that
it became imperatively necessary to
throw ssoil upon the troubled waters""
and in the same way to assuage the
wrath of the little coterie of Democrats
who held in their grasp the destiny of
Gov. Warmoth's political power in this
State. AS the rampant and terrible lion
is sometimes made tractable and docile
by filling his belly, the idea suggested
itself to His Excellency that similar
treatment of his political antagonists
would accomplish with them similar
result, and hence the secret of


THE HOWARD DINNER,


which took place at the st. Charles Ho-
tel, last Tuesday evening, and described
with such accuracy by the Jenkins Of
thePicaynne. That politics make strange
bed-fellows is clearly demonstrated by
this famous dinner. Mingling around
the ""gay and festive board"" tipping
glasses and quaffing the red and spark
ling wines provided with bountiful
hand, we find in close communication
Gov. Warmoth and Senator Blackman,
Senator Hunsacker and Senator ThOm-
as, Senator Campbell and Senator An
derson, Representative Ong and Rep
resentatives Stevens, Swords and Mon
cure, Lynch and Bowman, J. B. How
ard and L. E. Lemarie, Col. Carter and
Col. Jack Wharton, Col.Jack William
son and Col. J. ]. O'FallOn, with Col.
Hatch (nOt Frank but the other Hatch)
the Governors Judge Dibble and the
Governors jester and clown George
Sheridan. Here now was motley
crew, in comparison with which, in
point of talent, wit and learning the
names of Ben. johnson, Charles Lamb,
and Hazlitt can only be mentioned.
Now to analyze the cOngenial spirits
that seemed to mingle so harmoniously
on this memorable occasion, we must
begin wit Mr.. j. B. Howard,


THE CHIEF DE CUISINE,


who having exhibited to the entire sat
isfaction of the Governor a wonderful
adaptability for undertaking what no
one else could accomplish for lack ofim-
pudence, temerity and utter unscrupu-
lousness, was selected to act as master
OF ceremonies, and permitted to enjoy
the honor Of having paid for that COM
plimentary dinner to his Excellency
and the Democrat members of the Leg
islature. The Impeachment of that
prince Of Republican theieves who have
infested this State since the war, Ex-
Auditor WickliHe, is still fresh in the
memory of every one, and especially
with Senators Blackman, Anderson
and Lynch, who voted for the convic-
tion of the notorious Wickliffe. These
gentlemen will recollect, among the
charges preferred by Governor War
moth against Wickline on his trial was
""a collusion with one J. B. Howard,
whereby an appropriation of the Leg
islature for the Bureau Of Emigration,
of some ten or fifteen thousand dollars,
was paid 10 the said Howard after the
amount had been previously paid to
DR.. Noyes, the Commissioner of En-
igration, and Successor to Nj. Kath-

be denied, and yet NE find Governor

Extensive Forscries In Lynchburs, va.-A
Merchant AbscOnds With Large Sums Of
Money-Ie Leaves for Europe, Never to
Return.


LYNCHBuRG, Va, May 2, 1871.
On Thursday last quito sensation was created In
the business circles OF this city by the discovery OF
numerous alleged forgeries, which were committed
by former prominent merchant, Mr.. Ambrose
Woodruff, well known as the senior partner OF the
late frm OF Woodruff & Co., grocers and commits
sion merchants. Mr.. Woodruff has for years past
been largely connected with the trade OF this city,
and has always occupied a high position In society,
as well as being leader In mercantile transactions.
1t was known that he had recently been engaged in
some very heavy financial operations and for three
or four months past mad been so


PEouNIARILY EMBARRASSED
that he failed to meet his monetary engagements
that suffered his paper TO go to protest. Notwith-
standing this, however, he was regarded as an homo
rable and correct business man, who was possessed
oil SUFFICIENT means to extricate himself from his
financial difficulties, ana the reasons he assigned to
his creditors for his failure 10 fulfil his Obligations
allayed suspicion and luled them into the impress
sion that he would eventually be able to pay out
Thus matters remained until sunday, the 2sd OF
April, when Mr.. Woodruff left this city, ostensibly
to be absent Tor lew DAYS on private business and
when at the railroad depot ne borrowed atty dollars
from gentleman whom he met there, promising 10
pay him on his return. Strange TO say he did noc
come Dack as promptly as mlgnt DO expected In
business man and nothing was heard from him until
Thursday last, when MS brother received letter
from him, dated New York, announcing briefly his
purpose 10 sail for Europe,


NEVER TO RETURN


Inc nteiligence was received WIN no ORDINARY
degree or surprise, as neither his family nor friends
had had any fntination OF his ntenloR 10 cross the
ocean. The news among his creditors naturally
gave rise to suspicion, which then led to an ex-
animation OF his transactions with eacn, and soon
the glaring fact became disclosed tnat he had per-
petrated q number OF forgerles, the full extent OF
which are not yet known. II Is estimated that the
loss suffered by the mercantile community here Will

FEARFUL CASE OF MYDROPHOBlA.",,"Among the prisoners in the Pennsylvanfs
Western Penitentiary there is young Ger
man suffering from that dreadful disease,
hydrophobia. His age is about twenty-cight,
and be was a member Of the Virginia cav-
airy. In the Spring of 1865, when near
Lynchburg, his company was ordered to sack
railway freight depot where large amount
Of provisions were stored. The prisoner was
the first TO enter the depot, when large
dog jumped upon him and bit him ilrthe back
of the neck. A comradc of the prisoner
killed the dog, and the man was taken to
the hospital where the wound was dressed.
Nine days after this occurrence the man was
seized with convulsons, and so violent did he
become that he soon after was discharged
from the army and returned to his home.
lie had been with his parents but a short
TINT when his died, leaving him IS goo
with which to visit Europe and be treated
for the awful disease from which he was
suffering. This he did, and under advice
of several English doctors, to whom, i'll Lon
don, be stated his case, he proceeded to
Berlin where he was treated FOR about six
months. At the end of this time, having
gone through nearly all bis funds, he returned
to America, and about one year ago made
bis appearance in Pittsburg. He had not
been long in this city until he was arrested
on charge Of larceny, tried, found guilty,
and sentenced to the Western Penitentiary.


Shortly after his incarceration he was
seized with convulsions and consigned to thcr
hospital. A few days ago, while sitting on
the edge of bath tub in the hospital de-
parlment, dog which had found its way
into the chapel adjoining suddenly began to
bark, which caused the man to fall into the
bath tub in a terrible fit. On getting out Of
the fit he dropped upon his hands and knees
and began to bark at his keepers; his eyes
glaring and of that brilliant appearance which

George V. Perry had !dimculty with Mr.. Lewis F.
Watts, In which Watts was whipped. Watts then
employed two negroes ana a white man to go to
Perry's at night time for the purpose of heating
his antagonist The white man remained in the

they were after stepped behind the door
as 1t was opened, and the negroes, not
seeing him IN the ro0m went up stairs in search Of
him. AS soon as they started up stairs he sprang
out and ran to the railroad for assistance. The
grOes, after searching In vain for him up stairs
came down and fell upon Mr.. Perry and his young
son and beat til EN- fearruly. They then seized Mrs.
Perry threw her on the bed and tied her by the hair
to the bed after which they brutally outraged her
person. The fcnds then attempted to outrage little
girl only twelve years OF age. doing her the most
serious injury in their helsh efforts. Mrs. Perry IN
her struggles to escape had nearly all her hair pulled
from her mead By the roots but she finally succeeded
and fed to a neighbor's in her night clothes for
protection. The man who had gone for as
sistance returned with others and captured
the offenders. They then went to Wallis and ar
rested him and his son, and kept them secure until
next day. The news spread rapidly, and the people
nocked In with guns, determined on lynching all the
guilty parties. These, however, were secured IN a
strongly built house. that they not reached,
although desperate Efforts were made. They were
tried and sent to the Monroe Jat, where they re-
main securely guarded."

The democrats, being aware of the fact tnat Gene

In the HERALD Of tO-day-lor the protection OF life
and property at the South began early to libuster,
wish the double view of preventing the bill from
being brought before the House and OF secur-
ing an adjournment. The yeas and nays
were called upon dilatory motions for nearly
three hours without any signs Of yielding upon
either side In the republican caucus last night
General Butler had eighty-two republicans pledged
to support mis- bill With this strength at his back
ne expected finally to get the bill before the House,
1t appears however, that while the democrats were
dhbustering on the one nand, certain republicans,
VINO are anxious to adjourn were putting up job
on Butler which turned out more disastrous for his
bill than the attempts OF the democrats to defeat it,
Speaker Blaine who has been all along
the leader in the movement to adjourn, prepared
. resolution providing for the appointment Of Sc
lect committee OF thirteen. whose duty it shall be-
during the recess, to inquire into tine condition Of
the late nsurrectionary States and to report the
Speaker left the chair with this resolution in his
hand and went among the republicans to see how
they would take to the proposition. Dawes
Garfield, Wheeler, Bingham and Others,
who were wearied with the fbuster-
ing tactics OF the democrats, recognized
In Blaine's resolution plan to end the deadlock
and prospect OF an early adjournment They were
anxious for both and promised to support It, In
the meantime the democrats were consulted. They
saw chance to defeat Ben Buffers Ku Klux bil
and embraced 1t without hesitation. II was agreed
that there should be call Of the States for
bills and resolutions. Butler heard of the pro-
gramme, and knowing that the StaCe OF Maine
would be the first called he handed his
bill to Mr.. Lynch, OF that State, to offer
Lynch did his part Of the work, but Sam Cox OBJ
jected, on the ground that bill could not be intro
duced without previous notice. The Speaker sus-
tanned the objection, and Buffers bill was ruled out.
The Blame resolution had been handed to Mr..
Peters, OF Maine to offer. Like Lynch. he carried
out his part OF the programme. Butler. following
the example OF sam Cox, objected to It's inroduc-
ton without previous notice, but the Speaker
ruled that q mere House resolution was
in order under the call, and it was
promptly passed. General Butler In view
OF all the circumstances was OF course indignant.
He saw that he had been 1anked by what he calls
parliamentary trick"" Worse than all. he saw the
solid ranks Of the eiahty.two caucus men breaking





Gratis. He had no chance to protest or explain.
Could he have made speech it would PROBABLY
have been brief and to this efect:-


For ways tha. are dark and tricks that are vain


Which explain.


But he had no show. In sort Of soto DOce he
SAID ne had been sold out by a man VINO was not In
the caucus peters, and accused his fellow repup.
licans Of going over to the democrats. The whole
thing was over in less time than it took 10 call the
roll once. On the heels of this action followed
. joint resolution to adjourn on the
10th (Mondayb which was carried. The
Speaker announced the special committee provided
for BY the resolution after motion to adjourn had
been carried, thus foreclosing any possibility OF the
members appointed declining. General Butler Will
tomorrow decline to serve on the committee; so
will Judge Kelley, Horace Maynard and others. In
the meantime Butler mas issued the following
manifesto


10 THE REPUBLICANS OF THE HOUSE OF REpREsEN-


Having been appointed against my wishes, ex.
pressed both PUBLICLY and privately, by the Speaker
rs chairman OF committee to investigate the state
OF AFFAIRS In the South, ordered to-day by democratic
votes against the most earnest protest Of more than
two-thlrds majority OF the republicans Of the
House, and certainly against the almost unanimous
wish OF the republicans OF the States whom it most
specially concerns my selrespect and difference to
your good opinion requires me TO explain to you,
ana through you TO the country. why shall not
serve on that committee being convinced as / am
that no good, but harm only can come Of it to the
Ftrst-Because the committee was forced upon
the republicans by the nearly unanimous vote OF
the democratic party In the House, aided by some
twenty or thirty republicans only, against the de.
cislon OF majority of that party in u duly called
caucus Of the members OF the House.


second Because this committee was raised by a
combination "" the high tariff republicans with the
democracy, the one class willing to permit the
friends In the South II the tariff could be saved
even for nine months by an early adjournment

carefully concerted In my belief, to murder
and outrage enough Union men of the South to over
come by fear, intimidation ana injury the republl-
can majority there at the next Presidential election
they well knowing that this committee do them
no HARM and that 1t I'll furnish an excuse for the
tarn republican 10 vote with them for an early ad-
journment without legislation 10 protect Union men


Tnrd-Because such committee would be wholly

Henry w. Barry, the carpet-bagger
who claims to represent the second
district of Mississippi in Congress, has
repeatedly been denounced as Il thief,
a swindler, and a forger, by a general
in the federal army, and recently the
Brandon Republican denounced him
as horse thief. That paper says;


In a late issue of our paper we
charged the carpet-bag Congressman
from the Columbus district, II. w.
Barry, with having tried to steal Il
noted ""yallar pony from Hon. Frank
Lynch. Of Texas. and asked the Pilot
to add this item, together with several
other charges, to its biographical sketch
Of the infamous scoundrcl. Neither
the Pilot Barry himself, nor any Of
his friends, has disputed the charge,
and as Mr.. Lynch is now in this place,
we renew it, and dare the curget bag
scoundrel to dispute it. We may, at
some future time, give our readers a
few more items in the history of this
yankee villain, who was kicked out OF

the federal army for being, as a brother
officer expresses it, the d-dest scoun.
drel unhung. One Of his speculations
in Texas was hiring his negro regiment
out to pick cotton on shares for the
people in the ncighborhood Of hii
quarters, while they were being fed a

received over fifty bales from one widow
as his share, and a great deal more
from other parties."

In the lull exercise OF their functions and the
munity in the most peaceful state it had been
the close OF the war, when Kirk and his lawless
rabble IRON East Tennessee were precipared upon
them. This looks bai for his Exceency, and gives
color to the charge that the whole insurrectIonary
programme, Kirk war. and the arrest tOrtures and
imprisonment OF the citizens of Caswell were all a
part OF conspiracy to throw the State into actual
insurrecton, by which the President would be
called upon to declare martial law, and thus defeat
the August elections when the conservatives gained
such signal triumph About ninety Of the Gov

from jackson at shearing sheep. Jackson en-
! ployed one of them, who forthwith laid hold of
a sheep and began to cut and slash away in a
very reckless manner, every now and then taking
n piece of flesh out of the poor animal. After
lie had worked about half an hour, Jackson put
his hand in his pocket, pulled out half dollar
and told Mr. Sheep-shearer to let his sheep alone.
The discharged hombre then sat down, looked on
and talked sheep, knowing more on that sub
ject than anybody else. After while jackson
got tired of that and says to him "" Look here,
you know too much about sheep want you to
60 away"" This rebuff started the fellow and
he left together with his companion. The wor-
thy pair spent the four bits for whisky, and jour
neyed on. Arriving at the American Ranch,
they told Charley Hamin they wanted some
whisky. Charley told them he had none "" les
yon have, said they, ""and we must have some,
so just bring it out and say no more about it,""
Apparently yielding TO intimidation, Charley
went down cellar and brought up demUohn of
whisky which he sat down on the floor. Then
taking down double-barreled shotgun, Char
ley turned the tables on them handsomely.
Says he, g There's plenty of good whisky, help
yourselves if you re dry and amt afraid of me-
But my friends don't believe | can persuade
you to take single sip of it,"" And he was
right, for they suddenly concluded they weren I
dry, and left instantcr without saying good bye.
Our heroes then went on to the toll gate on
Scott mountain. Entering the toll house, they
told the keeper that they were hungry and
wanted something to eat. Upon being informed
that travellers were not entertained there they
again resorled to bluff talk Said they That's
played out we re hungry aud must have some
thing to cat so come out with it,"" But in this
case, as before, these big talking gentry met
with more than their match. Going to the cup
board and opening it, the toll-taker, instead
of producing grub for his unwelcomc guests
Unexpectedly exhibited a Colts six-shooter.--
""Now you rascals,"" said he, "" if ain't man
enough for you, pitch in and fill your bellies
There's lots of grub in the cupboard"" Fooled
again, the prowers lost their appetite and
sncaked off like ours of low degree"" Upon
reaching the house kept by widow Masterson,
they managed to impose on the good woman s
hospitality, for which they should receive all the
stripes allowed by the articles of war and as many
more as Judge Lynch might decide just and eq !
utabe."

all articles used in Its composition are the best of
the class to which they belong, being highly Ton

 On yesterday, an American named Lyons, and Louis Campa (Mex.) had a quarrel ill Campa's store. Campa was behind the counter and Lyons out side. They got excited, when friend of Campa's (don't know his name, but who is known as ""The Harpero, "") stepped up and struck Lyons ;s severe blow with his fist, knocking him down. The Harpero was arrested and brought before Justice Lindsey, who took the the case under advisement until six o'clock yesterday evening Court was adjourned, and as every one present gained the sidewalk, Lyons pulled his pistol, shot The Harpero in the ankle and Campa in the arm. Lyons was arrested and put in jail. Mexicans talked strongly of lynching him, and, report says, were encouraged very much to do so by one J. L. Smith known as ""Hualpai Smith,"" Smith was finally arrested and put in jail. As he went into jail, he used very pro- fane language to Lyons, and told him he ""had a good notion to chaw his head off ;''-whereupon Lyons picked up stick, lying close by, and struck Smith several severe blows over the head, and 'downed him. before he could be stopped. Before Smith was put Tn jail, Judge Lindsey fined him $100 and A hours imprisonment for contempt of court. Both parties are in officers hands as yet."

IN the annals OF q civilized community. Even the
most extre ne democrats acknowledge that the state
OF affairs IN Alamance county, as developed by the
testimony, Is horrifying end appalling beyond con-
ception. One tact Is, however, noticeable that Will
operate against Governor Holden-that all the long
list Of crimes now developed were perpetrated a
considerable length OF time prior to the date OF his
FIRST proclamation declaring Alamance county in


A STATE OF INsuRRECrIoN;


and not single outrage occurred between that date
March 0, 1870, and the Goth OF June OF the same
year. when he brought Kirk and his troops into that
co snty 1he courts open, the civil authorities
In the lull exercise of their functions and the CON-
munity in the most peaceful state it had been since
the close CT the war when Kirk and his lawess
rabble from East Tennessee were precipitated upon
them. This looks bal for his Excellency and gives
color to the charge that the whole insurrectlonary
programme, Kirk war. and the arrest, tortures and
impri. onment OF the citizens OF Caswe were all
part OF conspiracy to throw the State INTO actual
insurrecnon, by which the President would be
called upon t. lecare martial law, and thus defeat
the August elections, when the conservatives gained
sucn signal triumph. About ninety OF the Gov
ernor's witnesses have been examined so far, and

Besides these there four others the testimony

The Alabama ClniDls aud the Statement on


Behalf of the United states.
From the Providence Journal Senator Anthony,


Dec a0.l


As IS already known, the arhtrators on the claims
Of the United States against Great Britain, under
the Treaty OF Washington, assembled at Geneva,
switzerland at the beginning OF last week. They
as ao,n,ea vc @ to e d eea or
treaty. one by the United states, one by Great
Britain, and one by the governments or Italy,
Switzerland and Brazil, respectively. Mr.. Charles
Francis Adams represents our own government,
and tile Right Hon. Sir Alexander Cockburn thatof
Great Britain. Tne counsel who are TO argue the
case behalf OF the United States are Messrs Caleb
Cushing, William NJ. Evarts ana Morrison II. Waite.
Al the opening OF the session last week the case on
the part OF this country was presented III printed
statement prepared by Mr.. j. o. Bancroft Davis late
Assistant Secretary Oh State, who was the American
Secretary OF the JOINT High Commission. He is now
III Geneva, and presented his statement IN person;
venton, is allowed four months for the preparation
or It's answer the arguments OF counsel Will not he
heard till April, When the tribunal OF arb1tral0n
will hold second session at Geneva. Meanwhile
they will have before them this statement OF all the
claims OF the United States thus fax aScertalned,
growing out OF the Alabama depredations, as they
are Called together with The evidences or various
kinds on which these claims are made 70 rest.


The statement is contained. together
with the references and facts under each mead, III
volume OF 500 pages, printed both III English ami
In French. 1t is accompanied by seven additional
volumes, containing the documents. official cor
rcspondence ana Othec evidence on which our
government rests its various claims, and the
right is reserved TO present hereafter still
be required NO one can even glance at the out
lines of the question now before these arhitrator5
without being Impressed with the vast magnitude
OF the claims presented by the United States, and
also with the exceeding delicacy and difficulty OF
the task which the treaty has assigned to The arbl-
traitors under Its provisions. We do not see, how
ever that the claims could have been made any less
perfectly express the magnitude OF the wrong In
fiicted on US by Great Brilain-a wrong which no
tribunal OF arbitration can estimate, and which only
those who experienced 1t can even understand."

that the amendment proposed 20 change an existing

man 0yerruled the objection


Mr.. HALE. lrepJ OF Ne, moved to make the salary
retired Justices $4,000.


Mr. POTTER. tdem.l OF n. Y. opposed Mr.. Hale's
amendment and favored the motion Of Mr.. Arm
offces in l7S9-S4,500 for the Chief Justice and
81 900 for the Associate Justices-were nearly





than TO the sums indicated IN the amendment or the
gentleman from Pennsylvania Those salaries were
increased in 1855 TO 500 and 50, O00 which were
equal In purchasing power TO S12 900 now. He con-
trasted the liberal policy OF the English governments
In fixing the compensation OF judges with the parsi-
mony pracficed by the United States government.
Mr. DAWES, (rep.I OF Mass. was satisfied that the
time had come when IL was not only proper but
absolutely necessary to increase the compensation
Of the Judges OF the Supreme Court The only ques-
t0n was to the sum OF which IL ought to be fixed
In considering that question the provision OF lite

He believed that the present compensation should
be increased by two thou and dollars year, and he
would. therefore, support the amendment offered by
Mr.. Hale.


Mr.. ARMSTRONG argued in support OF the amend
ment which he had offered as being a fair and pro-
per one.


TO enter on the system OF increasing salaries when
the people were already overtaxed As TO the nc
cessty OF such increase on account of an increase

expenses OF living mad decreased more than fifty

ment oiiered by Mr. Armstrong, conrendInc that the
upright Judge was the poor mans counsel, anl
therefore, to the interest of taxpayers have
the judge literally compensated.


Mr.. HoAR, (rep.) OF Mass, argued on the same
side He SAID that when the ablest members of the
bar entered English court room they found them
selves in the presence OF an intellectual superior.
The Judge brought TO the determination OF the case
weight OF learning and Intellectual power which
nothing at the bar could match. On the contrary,
the policy which prevailed In too many OF the Amer
lean states mad brought about that saddest OF all
spectacies. justice administered by feeble Judge In
the presence OF able and powerful advocates. The
Supreme Court OF the United States Ia dignity
and importance and as source OF national pride
immeasuraDly superior TO any other tribunal on the
lace OF the earth. To II were brought sovereign
states as plaintiffs or defendants. II tribunal
which, IN the last resort, exhausted grave consitu-
toDal questions on which the political rights OF the
people were TO depend: and vet those judges were
accorded salary not equal to the ordinary income

interior State.


Mr.. KELSEY. rep.) OF N. Y, warned the House
that If 1t went to increasing salaries Of judges-and
he was Lot prepared to say there should be none-lt
could not close the food gates; it would be compelled
to 60 into general raising OF salaries OF all en-
poyes of the government. The increase Of judicial
salaries. II made, should be made In a special BILL
not In a general appropriation bill.


Mr.. BECK tdeml of KY, favored the amendment
proposed by Mr. Bale Cabinet Officers were now
paid $4,000 a year. They began with about the same
salaries as the Judges; but were gradually raised to
that sum.


Mr.. BINGHAM rep, OF Ohio, suggested that the
gentleman from Pennsylvania tMr. Armstrong;
Should accept the amendment offered by Mr.. Hale,
although, IL the matter left to himself ne would
vote the larger SUN, and would then be satisfied that
he had voted no more than due TO the court
Itself and the people behind the court.


Mr. BUTLER trep.) ol Mass, said he would vote
for the larger sum proposed, and argued that in
proportion TO the wealth aud prices OF the country
OF the two periods the first salary fixed for the
judges was much more liberal than that now pro-
posed.


The debate was Ydrther continued by Mr.. Potter,
In favor OF the proposed Increase, and by Messrs.
BENJAMIN. Ella and Benton against it,


Mr.. ARMSTRONG, in conformity with suggestions
made to him. accepted the amendment ohered by
Mr.. Hale instead or his own.


The amendment was adopted fixing the salary Of
the Chief Justice at 800, and Of the Associates and
retired Justices at sS, 900 each.

The Montgomery White Sulphur, the Allie

vertisements of this group of delightful
Virginia Springs appear in to-day's paper.
Preparations for the coming season are 60

June. Located within convenient distance
of each other, on the eastern slope of the
Alleghaney Mountains, they present very
strong attractions to the seekers after pleas
ure and health.


At the Alleghaney extensive improve
ments are being added, and Capt. Calhoun is
putting himself in trim TO give even greater
satisfaction than heretofore.


The Montgomery White, with its superb
accomm Odations, its beautiful lawn, its
grand mountains, and with Capt. Wilson,
late of the Old Sweet, to Superintend, will
be immensely attractive this season. 1t is
also to run an opera house, and its ball
room is always attractive.


And the charming little Yellow Sulphur,
nestled beneath its majestic oaks, is putting
forth new energy and promising great
things for the coming season. 1t is in
good hands now, and we may expect the
most satisfactory season there they have
ever had.


We are glad to see these three Springs
working together. Their interests are COM
mon, and they ought to move in harmony.
Combining their efforts and their influence
they can offer immense inducements to the
public. They possess great advantages, and
they ought to exert themselves in making g
them known.

The following is Q copy of the petit
ton: aJ ~ ...
To the Honorable President and Members of the |
Senate. |
We, the undersigned, citizens OF the
corporation Of the city of Carrollton,
parish of jefferson, Louisiana, and five
hundred others whose names will be
furnished, do hereby most solemnly pro-
test against the contemplated action OF
the Legislature to annex this corporation
TO the city and parish Of Orleans, and We
hereby declare that we are positively OPP
posed to said annexation, and do most
earnestly pray your honorable body to
liscA,ntcnaiice the said proceeding, to
which we are opposed for the following
reasons (: "" p"" '''-
insFirstA We are opposed to the plan Of
annexation because certain"" interested
parties, who are advocating this measure,
have other objects in view, such as the
erection Of immense wa.erworks in this
locality, thereby augme,iting the public
debt and consequent increase of taxation
to such an extent as would virtually
amount TO confscation of our proper
ty. r9h rooy ,1-3ish


Second-Becauce the population OF
this suburban district is almost exclusive
Nv composed of poor, Woodworking
people, white; and colored, vino, from
their scanty earnings, have boarded suf-
ficient means to purchase small home
steads for themselves and families, and
that this unexpected and overwhelming
increase of taxation must work their
complete and utter ruin.


Third That the city of Carrollton is
the only corporate body in the State
which is entirely free from debt the u.s.
sets of said city amounting to sixty-fve
thousand dollars, while her liabilities or
outstanding Indebtedness only amount
to some twenty thousand dollars and


the warrants of the city of Carrollton are
, now worth ninety-fve cents, while those
of New Orleans are quoted at but eighty
cents on the dollar. ..ttl p ''1,a


Fourth-That the citizens of Carroll


ton are now assessed at tire rate of but


two per cent per annum, while the rate


of taxation in New Orleans is from five
. and half TO six per cent.


FifthLThatlo~ing to theelow rate of
taxation, this corporation has attracted
: to itself large though poor population


of struggling people, whose sole means
consis. oi their little property and that
the immediate result Of this annexation
! will be not only to ruin those whoaro a.
ready here, but also to drive away those


who would otherwise settle in our midst.
a Sixth-That it is the universal OPT
D Mon, that tho benefits to be derived from
T immediate annexation are by''no means
! commensurate with the burden to be as
: sumed, and that we would for q long


time to come occupy the unenviable posi-


tion ef dead members attached to tho


body corporate p"" 8 ,f''


Trusting yoar honorable body vii
n perceive the justice of our claims and
e protect us from tho threatened calamity
: Your petitioners will ever pray, etc.

unwcrsaly discussed in the national capital to-day.
Certain New York papers, which did not have the
important Information published Id the HERALD
yesterday, have undertaken TO deny the facts
set forth in these dispatches. But the
manner In which the denial is made only confirms
the truth Of the HERALD's statements. One OF the
washington morning journals now comes out with
sort OF denial on authority, but what that autho-
Ffty Is It does not say. Parties at the White House
assume be ignorant OF any intention or necessity
TO reconstruct the Cabinet. Notwithstanding
these disclaimers however, the absolute necessity
and the ultimate intention to make sweeping
change Is reiterated by prominent republicans and
real friends OF the President. WHAT has created SO
mnch astonishment In oficia and public circles is
not so much the fact that reconstruc-
tion OF the Cabinet Is demanded by party
policy, and has been seriously contemplated
as what is regarded as Its premature publication In
the HERALD. The wonder is how the cat was let
OF the bag but, beng out, tue animal is every
where recognized. Whether the proposed reorgani.
zauon be carried ont month hence or not the fact
still remains undisputed that there is strong and
. growing desire that 1t may be speedily consum.
mated and a clear conviction that the success OF

Repeal OF the Income Tnx-Dlsngreement Of


the Conference Committee.


The conference committee on the repeal OF the
income tax met to-day, and after short session
found 1t impossible to como any agreement The
conferees ON the part OF the Senate stood up
squarey for what they conceive TO be the rights ana
privileges OF the Senate In the matter OF originating
and passing such bin as that for the repeal OF The
tax on incomes. The House managers were equally
stubborn as TO what they conceive TO be the pecu-
liar privilege Of tne House. namely, to originate all
bills relating in any way to the revenue. 1t was not
expected that they would come TO any agreement,
for the reason that both cemIartees met with their
minds made up in advance.


Tho Brooklyn Navy Yard Removal.


General Slocum appeared before the House Com
mitree on Naval Affairs to-day and made an argu-
nent TO show that the removal Of the Brooklyn
Navy Yard would not necessarily make the ground
upon which it stands revert to the State OF New
York He endeavored to prove that the title to the
property was vested in the government OF the
United States. The committee agreed TO report
bill for the removal OF the yard, with proyiso that
II shall not be removed until the state OF New York
gives the government a fee simple title to the
ground upon which the navy yard now stands. The
bin viii be vigorously resisted IN the House when it
is reported.


The Pacific Railroad Bonds.


q
session 10 day on the resolution before them rea.
tive to the Pacific Railroad The proposition was
to compel the railroad company to pay the interest
due on their bonds, amounting altogether TO some
SIX millions OF dollars. 1t Will be remembered that
the Attorney General decided that the Secretary OF
the Treasury had the right to refuse TO allow the
roads credit for transportating government ner-
chandse until they paid the back interest due the
government. The committee. after discussing the
whole question, have come to the conclusion that
the opinion OF the Attorney General is not good
law and will not stand the test OF the courts. II Is
understood that this is the opinion OF some of the
best lawyers in and out Of Congress. From this it
would appear that the Attorney General is not as
good lawyer as he should be. The committe will
report a resolution suspending all action on the
matter By the departments until ii Is decided by the
courts.

13_1871-12-02_p1_sn82015099_00279556690_1871120201_0195,The Shasta courier.,01,1871-12-02,p1,Thrilling Incident of 1853.,,"One pleasant afternoon, in the month of
September, 1858, we found ourself on the
Oakland boat, in company with large del
egation, on our way over to Oakland for the
purpose of witnessing balloon ascension
which was advertised to take place from
that city. Upon arriving at tha PlaeO of
the contemplated ascension, We found the
balloon in process of inRation but the ap-
paratus for the manufacture OF the gas was
defective, and the imitation Of the balloon
correspondinglJ tedious. 1t was cold, and
the afternoon was already far gone, and the
crowd, as is usual at such places, was be-
coming impatient Finally, as the sun was
rapidly nearing the horizon, the proprietor
made the announcement that he did not
think that he had gas enough in his balloon
for successful ascension, and as he could
not possibly make any more, still ne would
make an effort to ascend. He accordingly
seated himself in the basket and cut the
cord, the Office of which was to hold the
balloon to terra frma; but, to the utter
disgust of the crowd, it set as still as an
old lumber wagon in a potato patch. He
threw out his ballast, but still it would not
rise. He then stepped out of the car him
self, but it refused to depart for the skies
even then. Now, it simply consisted of the
balloon. with the ropes encircling it, ard
extending some feet below AT this juno
ture, believing that it would not go up un-
der any circumstances, he carelessly relin-
quished his authority over it, and allowed
it to get into the hands of some boys, who
began to experiment by throwing pieces Of
boards across the ropes and testing it in
that way At last an orange boy threw a
narrow piece of board across the ropes, not
more than four inches in width, and jump
ed on it, when to the amazement of all
present, it shot up like rocket, and before
any one could render him assistance he was
beyond reach. The string for opening the
valve and allowing the gas to escape had
been broken during the melee, and the boy
was at the mercy of circumstances over
which he had no control. It was an awful
moment, but scene Of sublime grandeur
There was little boy suspended in mid
heaven, with nothing but a board four inches
in width to sit on and a string to hold to.
As he found himself going he yelled to his
partner, ""Jim, take care of my oranges !""


But little did any one who saw that spec
tacle believe that he would have any further
use for oranges. Up, up, up, higher and
higher and higher did he ascend, gradually
floating oceanward, until he hovered, a mere
spect to view, over the city Of San Francis
co, VIXEN all at once counter current of
atmosphere struck him and rapidly carried
him over the Contra Costa range of noun
tains. He kept on ascending higher until
lost to view. We watched him in the
most breathless state of suspense that ever
mortals experienced-expecting every min
ute to see him tumble to earth, for no ono
supposed that he could long retain his seat
on the narrow board, to say nothing of the
benumbing effect of cold upon him. There
was bitter feeling toward the owner Of the
balloon for his carelessness, and there were
not wanting those who freely canvassed
the propriety of lynching him. But when
the Sacramento steamer came in the follow
ing evening, to the amazement of every
body in San Francisco, the orange boy was
on it The balloon took course over
Martinez, crossed the bay, or straits, and
finally came down in the Suisun Valley
when he went to a farmhouse and remained
over night, and on the following day footed
it to Benicia and took passage on the steam
er enroute to San Francisco. His account
Of his voyage was more than thrilling 1t
was horrifying He says that after tying
the board on which he sat to the rope, sc
that it would Eot fall out, he actually
climbed the rope to the balloon, distance
of ten or twelve feet, and with his knife
punctured it, in the hope that the gas woulc
escape and so descend to the earth. Bu
of course he could only puncture it at the
bottom, where the gas could not escape
He said the view, as he passed over th,
mountains, was grand beyond description
San Francisco, Suisun, Sacramento, Marys
vile, Stockton, San Jose, and, in fact, al
the towns within hundreds of miles, looked
as fthey were all huddled together beneath
him. He said !: GAS | was passing owe
Martinez l took an orange out of my pocke
and dropped it, but didn't stop to SCI
whether they got it or not Had the bal
loon have descendeda little sooner he woult
have been drowned in the straits. TakeI
altogether, his preservation was the mos
marvellous escape from terrible fate tina
We had ever had any knowledge of.-Pet

Writ Of Habens Corpus.",,"


| A suspension Of the writ Of habeas corpus
by the federal government in any Of the States
In time OF general peace would have been
regarded formerly as very serious matter.
Both Americans and English-all people Of
the Anglo-Saxon race-have ever carefully
guarded their civil rights as protected by the
writ of habeas corpus, and have taken alarm
at the first step to deprive them Of these rights.
The writ OF habcas corpus has been regarded
as the bnlwark Of liberty and it is this which
more than anything else led 10 the freedom
that we enjoy. But times have changed.
Our late civil war and the de-
moralizatiOn which resulted from 1t have
destroyed iu measure that watchful-
ness Of the American people over their
liberties and jealousy of the encroachment
Of arbitrary power. Now the President
of the United States suspends the writ Of
habeas corpus in q section Of our common
country and little notice of it is taken, as If
it were matter of ordinary occurrence or of
no tmportance-as II, in fact, no great priuci-
pie were involved. The proclamation of the
President, dated Washington, October IL,
1871, which was published in our issue last
Wednesday, places the counties of Spartan
burg, York, Marion, Chester, Laurens, New
bury, Fairfield, Lancaster and Chesterfield,
| South Carolina, under martial law on the
| ground that combinations and conspiracies
exist to obstruct and hinder the execution Of
the civil law, and that the federal government
is called upon to suspend the writ of habeas
corpus and to govern by military authority,
in accordance with the act of Congress passed
last April If the public mind were not so
dcmoralized and so indifferent to this exer-
else of military authority in time Of general


peace there would be o more searching in-
quiry as to the causes for or necessity Of this
extraordinary ac.ion of the government.


Fortunately, the Independent press of this
country is free to discuss the conduct of the
government and to call public attention to
this important matter. The indepen dent
PRESS as Junus said, is the palladium of our
civil and religious liberties. Let us see, then,
what foundation there was for prOclaiming
martial law and creating such dangerous
precedent for exercising arbitrary power in
Was hSC iCPuotS. AuO AOoAuCut tciio 10 III
his proclamation that combinations and con-
spiracies exist in the counties placed under
martial which cannot be reached by the civil
law, and these he calls rebeious and insur-
rectionary. By this he means what is gener-
ally known as the Ku Klux. The changes
are rung on such expressions as conspiracies,
organized and armed combinations, violence,
defiance Of the constituted authorities, aud 80
on, but there Is no evidence of rebellion or
insurrection either in the sense generally
understood or OF the constitution of the United
States. The law of Congress ON which he
bases his action may have given new inter
probation to rebellion or insurrection which
was never meant In the constitution, and he
may be acting strictly in conformity with
that. But the lawlessness of few
individuals which at most only extends TO a
sort of lynch law in Furnishing obnoxious per-
sons or those who are guilty Of crimes, cannot
be construed into rebellion against the govern
ment. In fact, there has been no such rebellion
or nsurrection. Nor have the proper const-
tuted local authorities called upon the federal
government to suspend the civil law, as is
required by the constitution.


Governor Scott. of South Carolina, when
asked less than three weeks ago If he were
opposed to martial law, replied, ''Most unequi-
vocally / am, aud those men who are 80
clamorous for martial law are pursuing
mistaken policy"" He said, moreover, that he
had no idea General Grant would declare
martial law, that he (the Governor) was not in
favor Of 1t, and that he thought the civil law
was more efficient. What better authority
does the administration want than the Governor
of the State, who is one Of its own partisans?
Then the State is under radical government,
and most of tae authorities in 1t are opposed
to martial law. The clamor for such an arbitrary
measure comes from only few reckless and
corrupt dsorganiz;rs and aspirants for office;
from men who have little interest at stake in
the State beyond what they can make out of
the offices or the disruption of civil govern
ment. No doubt there have been deplorable
ou,rages upon individuals by local bands,
and probably the Civil Rights bill of Congress
may have been violated in some cases. No
good citizen would attempt to justify these
But such crimes are not peculiar to South
Carolina. Crimes as bad or more hcinous
are committed in all the States, and IL would
be easy enough to attribute them to Ku Klux
If it should suit the federal government TO do
50 for political ends. Indeed, there might be
no limit to federal interference in the local
affairs Of the several States, or even in this
city Of New York, If the proclamation Of
martial law is to follow the commission of
similar crimes as those perpetrated in South
Carolina. Should the clamor OF few partisan
politicians be needed more than the principles

APPEARANCE OF THE PRISONER.


Justice Joseph r. Barnard County Judge Robert
Cochran and the Justices OF Sessions having
seated themselves on the bench, the prisoner was
conducted from the jail into court by Deputy Sheriff
Ford. In appearance Buckhout has undergone no
perceptible alteration since his first trial In
March, ls7o-his full face and firm step at
once denoting that his conscience has not
affected his gastronomic desires at least

deavoring TO empanel a jury.


BUCKHoUT'S FEARFUL CRIME.


1t Will be remembered that the terrible crime with
which the prisoner is charged at the resi-
dence Of the accused in Sleepy Hollow, near Tarry
town, on the Hudson during the forenoon Of January
/, 1870 Buclhout who had the reputation Of beng
shiitless disspated fellow on that day invited

Kendall, TO his house that they might rcrpetuata

where he told what he had done, and re.
quested to be taken to a constable who would

that the neighbors would lynch him."" The

conviction and three for acquittal.

attacked ex-C0ector Murphy's administration of
the New York Custom House, referring particularly
to the exposure OF the carriage business by the Re-
trenchment Committee last winter and Murphys re-
ply 10 sharp note OF the Secretary OF the Treasury
that there were men whom 1t was necessary for
him take care Of for the good OF the party Mr.
Murphy's tenderness Tor one Lanin was especially
commented on. The Senator then went on to dis
cuss removals from ONCE, saying that In the early
history OF the government changes In the civil SER
vice were OF infrequent occurrence. He pointed
out that tnat there were only nine removals
during Washington's administration ten IN the
administration OF the elder Adams, twenty-nine
IN Jenersons, with an entire change OF party and
policy, i've In Madison's and two In John Quincy
Adams. Political patronage. he said was the
poison Of the civil service. In closing his speech
Mr.. Trumbul remarked that he had heard nothing
In regard to the dolngs OF the present Collector Of
New York. but that II that offcer had corrected
the abuses OF the Custom House It was due 70
the country that II should be known. Senator Ed
munds replied, but before his speech was finished
the senate went into executive session. and the
conclusion OF the light was deferred till tomorrow
General Artnur's nomination has not yet come up
for confirmation, but this debate and the general
tone OF the Senate indicate dinnculy unless the re-
cacitrant republicans allowed to have their own
way.


Champions Of Civil Service Reform.


The Civil Service Reform agitation continues to
arouse the mental activity OF aspiring Senators and
Representatives Mr.. Willard, a member of the
special committee on the subject, has onered bill
which provides for the appointment of Commits
sioner of the Civil Service with two Assistant
Commissioners, who are to constitute q Board
OF Examination, which is to be competitive IN
character. Senator Edmunds offered bill
OF similar character, only differing somewhat In
its details. Mr.. Trumbul mas pending PROPOSE
ton to revive the joint Committee on Retrench.
ment enlargng Its powers so as to take In the ques-
tion of civil service reform investigation. All Of
these matters are straws which indicate that the
current Is rising In opposition to the plan which, 1t
has already been suggested In these dispatches, Mr..
Curtis Commission viii submit In their forthcoming
report. Nothing will probably excite and inname
hostility to the administration more than an attempt
OF the President to carry any plan Of reform in
the civil service without asking legislative approval
In the first instance


A practical step was taken to-day towards achiev-
ing that intelligent supervision over the several
departments and their operations, without which no
reform can be made thoroughly effective. 1t Is o
curious illustration OF the tendency centraliza-
tion OF control in legislative bodles to find that
several OF the House standing committees which
by the rules are charged with very important
functions have for years past allowed their
powers to become obsolete and their duties
to remain unperforne1. The committees referred
to those ON expenditures in the state Treasury,
War, Navy, Post ONCE and Interior Departments,
and also that on public buildings They are
charged, according to the rules with ascertaning
whether the department expenditures are justified
by law, whether claims are satisfied on sufficient
vouchers, and whether they are paid from funds
duly appropriated whether such funds are dis
bursed In accordance with law, and what provisions
are necessary to provide more efrectuay for these
Objects also to report as to abuses in the matter OF
public defalcatons, and further to report from
""time TO time such provisions and arrangements as
may be necessary to add to the economy OF the sew
eral departments and the accountability Of the ON.
GERS"" They are also to inquire whether any ofices
have become useless or unnecessary, and to report
on the expediency OF aboshing them and further to
examine into any necessary reduction or increase
OF pay and generally to report what legislation
may be necessary to increase efilcency In the de-
partments under their supervision. It can be
readily seen that committees carrying out such
duties would be very useful and influential The
memory Of the Oldest Congressman runneth NOT
back, however, to the time when any one OF these
committees ever did anything.


Representative Lyncn, Of Maine, whom the
Speaker tried to snelve as Chairman Of the Com.
mitlee on Expenditures OF the Treasury Depart
ment nanKed his colleague to-day by introducing
resolution directing the committee to make an IN
vestigaton into the AFFAIRS Of the Treasury Depart
menL As Mr.. Lynch used the words OF the House
rules In his resolution, except as to ordering a
special inquiry into the most recent defalca.
tions, there was no opportunity by any
ruling on the part Of the Chair to declare
the motion out OF order In any otner way to in
cite opposition to It's passage, Mr.. Lynch intends
to do the work he PROPOSES In thorough
manner, and from his previous record
there Is little doubt the promise will be redeemed.
In conversation on the subject Mr. Lynch says that
there was no hostile intention towards Secre.
tary Boutwell,, aud tnat he consulted with that
functonary before his motion was made.
lie regards the resolution which passed
the House to-day as requiring the committee
of which he Ia chairman to investigate all
treasury transactions, including the Syndicate ne
gotiations Mr.. Lynch is not an admrer OF Bout
Wells financial policy. though having full faith in
his integrity and general administrative sagacty
II the maine Representative u allowed to carry out
his present intentions the report that will be made
is sure to be valuable and Interesting document.
The other members OF the committee besides Mr..
Lynch are Messrs Sypher, Of Louisiana, and J. B.
Hay, of Illinois, republicans and Messrs Barnum, Of
Connecticut, and Kendall OF Nevada, democrats.
Bills from the Docket.


The Docket Clerk OF the House was for an hour or
two to-day the busiest man In the country. The
number OF Congressional eyes turned toward dis.
tant constituencies, while Congressional hands
were sending up bills and resolutions for refer
ence only, under the rule, was beyond the
average OF this bunc0mbe day of the
House. General Banks, who had faith

The Senate then proceeded to elect a
United States Senator.


Mr.. Ray nominated 0. j. Dunn.


The President returned thanks for
the honor conferred upon him, but de-
clined the nomination.


Mr.. Campbell nominated Gen. ). Il.

Mr.. Antoine nominated P. b. ;.

Mr.. Ray, after expressing regret that
the President declined the nomination,
nominated P. ]. Kennedy.


Mr.. Thompson nominated T. Green

mocracy.""


On motion, the nominations were
closed.


Gen. J. r. West received 10 votes, P.
B. S. Pinchback 7, T. Green Davidson
5,P.J Kennedy 2, Gen. Mcmillan l.


The following voted for Gen. West

Daigle, Futch, Thomas, Thompson.


For P. J. Kennedy-Harris, Ray.


For Gen. McMillan--Pinchback.


Gen. j. r. West was declared the
choice of the Senate on the first ballot,
he having received the majority of the
votes necessary for an election by that
body.


Mr.. Blackman said that he had just
heard that Gen. J. r. West was chosen
in the House of Representatives by a
large majority. Since those in the
House have cast their votes for Gen.
West, the Democrats have discharged
their duties as incumbent upon them,
by voting for T. Green Davidson, but
as it was impossible to eject a Democrat
to fill that position, the Democrats were
now willing to make unanimous the
nomination of Gen. J. r. West as
| United States Senator, which remarks
brought out Senator Mcmillan, who
said that Gen. West was not partisan
candidate nor recognized any Republi-
can organization, and that he was not
the candidate of the Republican party
of the State.


! Mr.. Pinchback said his candidacy
was simply to test the faith of the Re
publican party; that he had no chance
of election, but wished to see if one of
his race and color had any prospect of
being elected to the United States Sen
ate from the State of louisiana; that
he labored under misplaced confidence
rom the fact that he did not believe
that they represented their constituents
by the vote given.

Ex-Governor Mccormick, now delegate In Con-
gress from Arizona, called upon the President to-
day with delegation OF leading citizens from that
Territory, who protested against the statements Of
General Stoaeman IN his late report, and declared
that many OF the Indians pronounced peaceable by
him were intensely hostile. They asserted that
life and property were never 30 insecure
IN the territory as at present, and
that the proposition to abandon certain
forts had greatly alarmed the people. They said
that the mineral discoveries of the past year were
more promising than any before made in the Terri
tory, and that with anything like adequate protec-
ton the mines would pay largely and the Territory
We'd handsome revenue to the government. The
President referred the delegation to General Sher-
man, who said Congress alone was responsible Tor
the lack OF the needed military force, the army hav-
ing been reduced to an extent that prevented the
assignment OF more troops to the Territory.

accompanied by searching cold wind.
The morning dawned, and His Excellency
awoke In Portland, where the train had arrived after
six hours ride. The enthusiasm OF the trip, which
eliminated In BangOr. coulI scarcely he recalled by
the Imagination, so cold and forbiddng was the
weather. At an early hour three or four gentlemen
representing the city government OF Portland called
to know the pleasure OF the honorable rarity for
their short but expected stop here. hurried lunch

South and the recognition of the rights of oil
citizens everywhere, it will be hard to compre-
hend many incidents of these days. The
cruelty and barbarity of the outlaws of the
South will be easy enough to understand.
There never was in that region any law or
Justice for negroes suspected OF manhood, or
white men from the North The debasng i'll
huences of Slavery and whisky have been re-
enforced by the passions and feuds bred OF
civil war, and the long impunity afforded by
the disordered state of the country has re-
suited in many portions of the Southern States
in complete chaos of law and morals. There
are many regions of Kentucky and of Missis-
sjppi to-day where violence and murder, If
committed against negroes or Unionsts, have
ceased to be regarded as anything more than
the ordinary friction of political life. This Is
state of affairs which, however disgracefu Is
not ncomprehensible. Given tho special
conditions and antecedents of the perpetrators
and their acts are natural and logical. They
are to bo met with means of punishment and
repression, ""a criminals and highwaymen. But
what is far more difficult to explain or handle,
is the stolid, brazen effrontery of Democratic
journals in the North, which steadily refuse To
recognize the existence of this state OF things.
Nothing is gained by this persistent and shame
less Justification. Everybody knows OF the
outrages daily perpetrated in the South. South
ern Journals, Southern judges, and Southern


governors have denounced them. The disorder
and anarchy of these disturbed regions are
most disastrous in their present and future
results on the general prosperity. No man
doubts that hearty and unanimous denuncia-
ton of them by Democratic Journals and con-
ventions would bring about an Immediate
change for the better. But these outlaws only
exist by Democratic tolerance and support
They are the last desperate hope of that un-
principled organization which seeks to carry
the next election by intimidation and violence
throughout the South, and interference win
them now would impair their efficiency next
year. This is the only possible explanation OF
the course of those papers which receive IN
their correspondence and exchanges every day
numberless instances of infamous outrage,
and vet continue to deny the existence OF the
Ku-Klux, and to meet every proposition OF
repression with impertinent sneers.


What is the moral condition of the organs
of party which regard with silent approval
the daily occurrence of infamies like the fol-
loYingf


w. W. Wheeler, piOus and exemplary man,
Trustee of the College at Berea, KY, went
last month to Fitchburg, in Estill County, on
business He attended n prayermeeting OF
colored people in the evening, and on his way
back to the tavern where he had left his wife
and child was shot at by two or three rui-
fans, but escaped Long after midnight, the
house was surrounded by gang of ku-Klux;
the craven landlord came to Mr.. Wheelers
door and made him get up he was seized
and dragged into the street in his night-dress;
taken quarter of mile into the woods;
beaten until he was nearly senseless; then al
lowed to breathe and refresh himself while bis
torturers discussed the prOpriety OF hanging
him. II was decided to give him dozen
more lashes and order him out of town. This
WAS done ""to whip his Northern principles
"" out of him."" as the gentlemen engaged In
the business asserted. There were twenty or
thirty dodgers at the tavern, and large num-
Der of the employees of the neighboring iron
works within call, but no one lifted voice or
hand. This statement of Mr.. Wheeler Is not
substantially denied by any one, and is ener-
getically supported by the Rev. j. G. Fee,
well-known minister of the Gospel in Ken
lucky.


These lawless outrages are the inevitable re-
sult of pusillanimous tOleration. The torture
of the defenseless has always an irresistible
attraction for barbarOus communities. Amuse-
ments are few and simple in these remote
districts. The only excitements known to their
turbulent youth are those of drinking, gam
bling, and fighting. Whisky and cards cost
something, and fighting is attended with more
OF less danger. In the present paralysis of
law, and the moral apathy that has settled
upon the terrorized neighborhoOds, the lynch
ing of an occasional schoolmaster or parsOn is
at once the most delightful and economical
of diversions. 1t has all the charm OF the
tavern spree and the woodland picnic. 1t Is
a fascinating and perfectly safe escape-valve
for the exuberant animal spirits OF the grow
ing hone of the South. The pride of these
rural rufiians is tickled by the terror they in
spre in their homes, and the cOwardly sub
servience Of the Democratic press confirms
them in their brutal contempt for law and or
der. With their deficient moral perceptions,
with their dense and half-savage ignorance, it
is not reasonable to expect that they should
see anything wrong in acts which their decent
neighbors cOndOne by silence and the North
ern journals cover with shield of lies.


1t seems hopeless to address to the repre-
sentatiyes of the Democratic party any ap-
peas founded upon decency or patriotism
But there ought to be some residuum OF these
qualities left among the better class OF Demo-
Gratis. We ask of such whether it is wise, in
the hope of a possible trfling gain of votes
to nourish and foster throughout wide ex-
tent of country a spirit of defiant savagery
which will plague us all for years to come

The Lynchburg Republican (democratic) is
hardly correct in stating that history indi-
Gates that all the President makers are more
apt to be wrong than right in their surmises as
to the next occupant of the White House.
The triumphant election of Grant was
predicted by independent journals long
before either party thought of him as
an available candidate. And when he did
loom up as candidate there was terrible
scramble between the republican and ,mo-
cratic leaders as TO who should secure him as
their standard bearer. As it was in 1868 so
it will be in 1872. Grant will be reelected
unless the great reform movement shall unite
the best men Of all parties and sweep corrup-
tion from the halls of federal, as it already has
swept it from the halls OF our own municipal
government."

Mr.. Jabez Griffing, went to the city and
brought up some hands, white and black, as
he could get them. Among them was a
Scotchman or Irishman named Blake, who
proved so unruly, factious and worthless
that Mr.. Grifing soon discharged him. Blake
then hired to another planter near Warsaw,
on the Bayou Macon, but his behavior was
so reckless thai he became nuisance to the
whole neighborhood, and he was admonished
to behave himself, without effect. Unscru-
pulous and intrusive he went where he
pleased and did as he pleased, regardless as
to who he pleased or displeased. Taking a
notion to widow in the neighborhood, he
sought to marry her or possess her any
how, but he failed. He then commenced to
work ON a young colored girl, and, watching
his opportunity, ravished her. This act
filed to overfowing the cup of public for
.bearance towards him. He was brought
before Judge Lynch, tried convicted and
sentenced to be hung, and his body thrown
into the bayou, and the sentence was duly
executed on last Monday."

But all this we have nothing to do with,

Citizens Arrested by IL. y.
Troops, without War
rant, and Put On


Trial Without


Indictment.",,"The horrors of the Lynch Law enact
ed by the vindictive Radical majority in
Congress at the dictation of Grant, are
being illustrated in Holly Springs by a
form of trial unknown to the jurispruden-
tial system of the country. Its victims
are citizens of Oktibeha county, viz /;
Jas. Graves, N. Maxwell, Y. Harring-
ton, JAS Bell, S. Watt and - Cur
~. The last named is one of the ma
tion's wards and in the list we have
been informed, is included one of Gov.
Alcorn's Justices of the Peace.


These citizens were arrested without
warrant, by U. S. soldiers, forced away
to distant part of the State, and put
upon trial on charges preferred without
indictment by grand jury. These ex-
traordinary proceedings were instituted
at the instance of one McLachlin, who
came to Starkville from the North several
months ago established intimate social
relations with the negroes and was detec-
ted in arming, organizing and training
them for mischievous work, at the dead
hours of night. On the discovery of the
plot, he was notified to desist, and was
further informed that the peace of the
community he was seeking to endanger,
as well as his own safety would be best
assured, if he would take up his abode
elsewhere. He was conducted to the
railroad by citizens pledged to protect
him against any violence which might
have been provoked by the discovery OF
his incendiary plot.


This proceeding of the citizens was
followed by the seizure and transportation
of the persons named; and their prose
cution is conducted in Marshall county
before a U. S. Commissioner. The trial
could have been had as well in Oktibbeha
county where the persons arraignad were
convenient to witnesses and where they
would have been spared the trouble,
hardship and cost attending their trans
portatlon 10 a distant part OF the State.
But this did not suit the malicious intent
of the prosecutors, which was to infict
punishment in advance of trial whether
the parties were found guilty of the
charges trumped up against them or not.
The proceeding is not only in violation OF
the personal right of the citizens to be
tried by jury of the vicinage and to be
arrested only upon warrant, but is in
contempt of the present State Govern
ment with its Radical Executive, Legis-
lature and Judiciary, and of the pledge of
its chief that he is able to conduct it, and
law without the Intervention of the Fed
eral authorities."

Mr.. MOORE. lrepl OF H., introduced bill for the
relief or settlers on public lands or claimants under
the existing law who have served IN the army or
navy. Referred.


THE HOUSE IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE


me House then, at twenty minutes TO Two, went
into Committee OF the Whole Mr. Scofeld In the.
cnair and resumed consideration OF the Legislative,
Executive and judicial Appropriation bill.


A discussion took place ON q provlso reported In
the bi directing that hereafter no laws or treaties
snail be published IN newspapers except those
which are OF general nature, and which laws or
parts OF laws shall be selected by the Secretary OF
State.


MIR. BENJAMIN, rep,) OF NO., offered an amend
meat repeating the law authorizing such publlca-
ton. He said that the expenditure was useless for





which 1t cost might as well be thrown into the
Potomac. The only object OF 1t was to enable some
partisan papers To exc out sort or sickly existence
Mr.. MAYNARD, rep.) OF Tenn, made the point of
order that the amendment proposed general legis-
lation and was not IN order In an appropriation BILL
The CHAIRMAN sustained the point or order


Mr.. MAYNARD differed entirely with the gentle
man from Missouri to the utility OF such publica-
ti0n This was a government OF the people, and the
government should be brought as closely IN commu-
ncatlon with the people as possible, and in no way
could that be done so readily and effectively as by
the publication OF the laws.


MIR. LAFLIN, Tep) OF N. Y, offered an amendment
limiting the publication to two papers In State
and Territory. Agreed to.


Mr.. ROGERS, (dem1 OF Ark, offered an amend
men requiring these to be papers having the largest
circulation. Rejected.


MIR. BENJAMIN offered q substitute for the whole
paragraph as follows:-


For publishing the in pamphlet FORM 80 600 and all
by repealed.


He repeated his argument in support OF the pro-
position.


Mr.. MAYNARD repeated his point OF order, but
the chairman ruled that the objection was made too
late After further opposition by Messrs. Palmer
and Patt the substitute was agreed to by vote Of
90 to so.


An amendment offered by Mr.. ALLISON, (rep.) OF
Iowa, to insert the paragraph making apprOprla-
tons for the office OF the First Comptroller or the
Treasury an item for four chiefs or divisions, at
s. 500 each gave rise TO long discussion.
Mr.. DAWES opposed the amendment on the ground,
chiefly, that the Secretary OF the Treasury was pre-
ment aud that Congress should not inter-
fere sporadcaily with such reorganization.
He mentioned as an instance OF tbs necessity
OF u teat ne met 3 few days ago. fn the
Treasury Department q gentleman holding war
rant for payment who had then been in eighteen
bureaus and had st three bureaus to visit before 1t
The amendment was rejected.


After proceeding In the bill as far as the thirty
seventh page the committee rose, and the House, at
halfpast four O'Clock, adjourned.

Many Of these officials are related to the


controlling powers. Starkweather is the


father-in-law of Governor Hoffman.


Politicians Of the worst and most ignorant


order are found scattered throughout the


roll of the sinecures, which includes retired


rum sellers, bar-roOm loafers, ex-convicts,


gamblers, bruisers, and other bad charac-
ters. 1t is believed that to support this ring
of hireliDgs costs the city upward Of one
million two hundred Thousand dollars per
year. One of the citizens committee states
that his examination of the records Of the
at least thirty three per cent of the money
expended in the various departments was
stolen by the ring.


An immense number OF politicians took

Numerous Tammany rOughs and repeat

Of the Representatives of Tammany to the

with general acquiescnce and approval.


The committee Of seventy had long
meeting last night, and adopted constitu-
lion. A committee of conference with the
Albany council Of reform was appointed,
and instructed to request the mayor to ap-
point such inspectors of election as they
may nominate.


There was NO quorum at the meeting of

ast evening.


At meeting Of the sinking fund commits

Hall, and acquiesced in by the rest of the

the Military Academy, Congress is bound to
correct the evil by the sharpest censure Of the
faculty and the severest punishment of those
pupils who, under pretext of whatever provo
cation, undertake to infict the penalties of
''Lynch law"" upon their comrades. At the
same time, If the charge against the latter that
they were gully Of the disgraceful and unpar-
donable offence of lying should be proved, we
cannot consider them entitled to being restored
to the privileges which they may have forfeited
by conduct unbecoming gentlemen aspiring to
the distinction of officers in the United States
Army.


Brutal collegians should nowhere have
s'rights"" which Massachusetts, is ''bound to
respect above those accorded by it to the
prize fighters whom it justly imprisons. The
laws Of every State should be rigidly enforced
alike on those within and on those outside of
college walls. And Congress should see to it
that the cadets at West Point be henceforth
subjected to discipline so strict as to render
impossible repetition of the scenes which
havs lately disgraced the Military Academy.


Since the above lines were written we
have received from the War Department
at Washington official news of the disas-
trous conhagration at West Point on Sun
day morning 1t is but just to say that
the commentators of Lieutenant Colonel
Upton upon the gallant conduct of the cadets,
as well as of the men, on this occasion,
attest better state CT discipline at the
Academy than the recent insubordinate be-
havior Of the majority of one of the classes
might have led us to anticipate. 1t will not
be unfair to count among ''extenuating cir
cumstances"" the manly conduct Of the cadets
at the fire on Sunday morning."

Appeals for Mercy.",,"We have before briefly mentioned the
lynching of Meard, or Meara. the child
murderer. A more extended report appears
day, which follows:


CHICAGO, July 9.-The following are the
particulars of the lynching of Meara, the
child murderer, at Watseka, Illinois, on
Wednesday last:


hundred, led by DR.. Daniels, of Orange
When they demanded the prisoner the
sheriff refused to give him mp, and, upon
Daniels attempting to enter, discharged his
revolver at him. Daniels struck up his
arm. and wrenched his pistol from his hand
The crowd then, with a sledge hammer
battered down the door of the cell where
Meara was confined The poor wretch
begged for mercy, but nobody gave heed
pinioned his arms, and carried him into the
street. Dr. Daniels then addressed the
crowd, saying that he had sworn not to
return home until the murderer was exc
cuted, and asked the crowd it they would
stand by him. All responded in the affir-
native. Meara was then placed in a wagon
which was drawn by the crowd to tree
a short distance from the jail. A rope was
placed around his neck, the other end at
JdcHeu 10 JHo lIlnU OI lHe Tree, au0 lie was
told he might have twenty minutes in which
10 prepare for eternity.


He spent the first half of his time in pite-
Gus appeals for mercy. While doing this
he was dsrided by many of the crowd. One
man offered to pray with him, but he re-
piled that he could not pray without
priest. de then called upon the Masons
present to keep him. but none responded,
and he cursed the Masons. He then called
upon the Catholics to rescue him. One of
them shouted, Call on God, He alone can
save you"" He prayed during the remain
ing moments.


At the expiration of twenty minutes the
wagon vas pulled from under him, and he
was left hanging At first not ii muscle
moved, but in few seconds his struggles
became fearful. The crowd then disap-
peared, but, before doing so, several brutal
fellows discharged their revolvers into his
body. About one thousand persons wit
messed the hanging. The leaders of the
lynching party did their work iI quiet
and orderly manner, but many of the
crowd betrayed brutality in speech and
gesture.


No movement has yet been made looking
TO the punishment of the lynchers."

19_1871-12-23_p4_sn83030313_00271743762_1871122301_1058,The New York herald.,01,1871-12-23,p4,Our shippiss .Inscrc.ts Before Congress.,,"| Our Shippius Intercsts Before Congress.
The members Of Congress who are most ac-
tive In the matter OF providing some remedy
| for the depressed ana declining shipping inter-
| ests of the country begin at the wrong end.
Instead Of giving the utmost freedom to our
capitalists and merchants to buy ships wherever
they can get them best and cheapest, and thus
add to the tonnage Of the United States, as


well as giving the profits OF the shipping busi-


ness to this country they arc intent on pro-
noting some little interest OF few individuals
or Of some small section Of the republic. The
bill which Mr.. Lynch, of Maine, has just sub


mitted to Congress, and which has been re-


ferred to the Committee on Commerce, bears
this character. The State of Maine, or por-


ton Of it, is interested in shipbuilding, and,
therefore, Mr.. Lynch, who is Repre-


sentative In Congress from that State,
proposes to tax every ton Of foreign shipping


that enters our ports, and to pay four dollars
| ton per year upon all American vessels


engaged in foreign trade. A tonnage tax Of
thirty cents ton on foreign vessels, as pro-
posed by Mr.. Lynch, would not amount to
vast sum in the aggregate--to not more, prob
| ably, than . million and half dollars
year; but IL would bear heavily on certain
I class of vessels A. four thousa nd ton steam


ship, for example, would have to pay tax or


duty Of twelve hundred dollars every time she


entered New York or any other United States


port All this would tend to restrict COM


merce; and, after all, the American con-


sumers Of goods brought In these foreign


vessels, and American passengers and emf


grants carried in them, would have to pay the


tax. Besides, it Is doubtful If this would have


any perceptible effect Ia stimulating ship


building. The principle is wrong, contrary to


the spirit Of the age, and opposed to the inter-


ests Of this country generally. So, TOD. Is that


other proposition In Mr. Lynch's bill to give


bonus Of four dollars ton from the Treasury


on all American vessels engaged in foreign


trade. This, in round numbers would amount
| to about five millions Of dollars year, and,


therefore, would be positive burden upon


the taxpayers and the Treasury of about three


millions and half year over and above the


receipts from the tax on foreign tonnage.
| This is all wrong. 1t is peddling way Of


meeting the shipping difficulty. And if the
people are to be taxed to pay gratuity to
few hundred shipowners aud shipbuilders why
| not for other kinds of business? Why should


not the farmer, the planter, the shoemaker,
the tailor and others be favored in the same


way2


While this scheme of Mr. Lynch would put
money into the pockets of u few and tend to
restrict commerce it would not have the effect


needed. 1t would do little or nothing in the


way Of increasing the tonnage Of the country.
The only way is to abolish or amend the reg
istry law 30 as to permit our citizens to buy


vessels everywhere and to place them under
the American flag. AT least the present reg


istry law might be suspended for
few years until the result could be
seen. We have no doubt that if this


law were abolished or suspended the tonnage
Of the United States would In the course of
ten years rival that Of the irst maritime nation
in the world, and place this country in the
| same relative position II occupied just before
the war in shipping interests. The yearly
profits on such increased tonnage, and the
other advantages to the country, would be
worth far moro than all the shipyards In


Maine. Our peddling Congressman are look
ing to small thiugs-to petty local interests


instead Of 10 those that are large and national
Shipbuilding will be restored in this country


in due time, as taxation becomes reduced,


living cheaper, labor more equalized, mate


rials produced with greater facility and at less


cost, and as population and commerce in
crease. That must be q growth. Our tom
| mage, however, we can restore and increase
by simply acting upon the principle Of buying
| in the best market. Most of the great ocean


steamships coming here under the German,


French or other national flags, and carrying
| the profits Of their business home were built


In Great Britain. Here is an example for us.


Nothing but broad, liberal and comprehen-


sve policy, and change in the registry law,


will restore our tonnage and give this country


that maritime position which it ought to hold
| among the nations.

We desire to call the attention of those

In the United States Circuit Court, yesterday,

art The National City Bank, Duncan, Sherman * Co.
and others, came for argument. Commodore Balm

beaueathing certain specific egacies he appointed VIII

his estate with instructions to invest portion thereon
I'm trust for the and benefit Of his daughter the
plantf in this suit These trustees were at their own
option discharged from their trust in 1885, and Samuel
Jandon one OF the defendants and brotherin-law or
Mary T. b. Jandon was appointed In their stead.
According to the complaint during the years le6l-s,
Jandon borrowed money for his own use from the Ma
tonal City Bank, and from Duncan sherman Co.. ahu'
without authority, security therefor over
S 600 in shares stock OF the Delaware and Rltan

We know nothing of the facts i'll this case,
but, if it be true. and this can be readily
ascertained by application in the proper
quarters, we suggest that this is
matter for the serious consideration
of the Committee of Seventy. If the
proceedings which have been begun with
such universal acquiescence of good citizens
are not merely farcical, they tend not only to
the removal Of our corrupt rulers from power,
but to justice upon them for their trangres-
sions. If it be proved that they have stolen
the money of the taxpayers, they
should be compelled to make restitution,
even to the uttermost farthing of their
possessions. Merely turning them out
of the positions they have disgraced
would be to them no adequate punishment.
Secure in the accumulatiOns of years of rob-
berry, they could bid defiance to public opinion
and await favorable opportunity for enter
ing again upon the field of politics. They
have no social position to lose. They would
be no more dcspised by decent people than
they arc at present. Their wealth would gain
them circle of retainers and parasites very
much the same as those who surround
them now, and after a while the pub
lie conscience, wearlcd with the power


full effort required for dismissing them,
would begin to neglect and at last to forget
them. But if they are prosecuted to the point
of making them disgOrge their plunder, they
would go into retirement with none to do
them reverence Their evil example would
become pOwcress for harm, if the influence
of their stolen millions could be taken from
them. 1t should therefore be matter for
immediate consideration to the Committee


whether an injunction should not be at once
applied for restraining these men from alien
ating any of their property pending the legal
investigation of their cases by the Courts.

rapid and hot-blooded journal, The Nation,

ductOrs OF that paper know anything OF Amer

absurd and 80 savage. mob sometimes

inevitably be composed in great part OF the

the fact that the persons punished often de-
served it. Haggerty was q noxious animal

!. The Ku Klux investigating committee to-
day examined Col. N. Fl. Taney, a LAWYER OF
Alabama, mainly with reference to the Satoria
disturbances last year, when several colored
persons were taken from jail and lynched,
Taney admitted the existence of bands OF arm
ed and disguised men, and the preparation OF
occasional Outrages in that county. He con.
adhered the purpose of their organization to be
to keep the peace and prevent negroes from
stealing.


Sheriff Chisholm of DeKalb, Miss, testified
that disguised men had committed a number
of lawless acts in bis county, but they were
not now frequent. The great majority of citi.
zens of both parties had aided him in putting
them down and preventing their recurrence.
just before leaving for Washington, however
he had been told by leading conservatives th al
the Democrats were getting up an orgauiza
tiOn which would control the colored vote and
enable them to carry all the elections."

degree against Henry Aschenner and Louis Lep-
pard. The prisoners demanded o separate trial
and the District Attorney chose to try Aschenner
first. The complainant, Michael Frentz testified
that about three O'Clock In the morning OF the sth
OF October he was on his way home, and while
passing through Clinton street was met by the de-
PENDANTS. Leopard took mold OF his gold watch
chain and asked what time II was. FrenJz told hln

REMARKS OF THE COURT ON THE DETENTION OF


WITNESSES


Judge BEDFORD said:-I am going to follow the
excellent suggestion made by Judge Barnard, OF
the supreme Court, which believe to be eminenty
proper, that all cases where witnesses are confined

cent men up because unable, by reason or their
poverty, To lind security for their attendance In
court Is a great hardship, and shall do every
thing In tins Court TO relieve Them

Christianity In the Ninereanfh Century.
To THE EDITOR OF THE HERALD


1t may be truly said that Christianity at tile pre-
sent moment is nearly as feeble in robust life and
aggressive vitality 1t In the second and third
centuries. 1t Is quite true, however, that there are
In Europe and America ana in the whole world
about three hundred millions Of nominal Christians
but out OF this large number now many true and
faithfal followers Of Jesus Christ are there, who
would suffer all manner of persecution, like the
early Christian, for the faith OF the benign Saviour
In fact II the early Church was feeble in numbers 1t
was strong In faith, which the modern Church not
During the second third, fourth and fifth centuries
the primitive Church was evangelical consisting Of
a band OF tineranr evangellsts going about from
place to place to spread the Gospel OF Christ. But
after many converts had been made II found ne.
cessary therefore, to look within as well as without
and preserve the faith OF those VINO were already
converted. Hence the Church became more eccle-
siastical and hierarchica more authoritative more
imposing In liturgical FORM and, from mere mis-
sionary society, became a compact, united church.
She went on gaining strength-asserting her power
far wiz 10
Europe; bringing men from nature into grace and
finally covering all Europe with the beautiful gar
ment OF the Christian religion. Having in view the
great commission and authority given to the
Apostles ana their successors, recorded In st.
Matthew, therefore earnestly believe that the holy
Roman Catholic Church never could teach false doc
trines; but as far as she depended on human judg.
ment and power, she could become weaker, and. to
u certain extent, fall short OF her great mission.
We find, therefore, the world In the days Of
Luther, lax In morals, and many fat ecclesiastics
enjoying themselves , here below; put the power OF
thoritative Church, TO great extent reached the
hearts OF oil. But Luther perhaps not Intentionally
broke the spell OF grace and over since his protest
the werld has been going down, step by step, back
to nature back TO heathenism, like that from which
the Apostles redeemed IL. 1t has been gradual but
at the same time 1t has been sure VITA the adj

September, 1858, we found ourself on the
Oakland boat, in company with large del
egation, on our way over to Oakland for the
purpose of witnessing balloon ascension
which was advertised to take place from
that city. Upon arriving at the place Of
the contemplated ascension, We found the
balloon in process of imitation but the ap-
paratus for the manufacture Of the gas was
defective, and the imitation of the balloon
correspondingly tedious. 1t was cold, and
the afternoon was already far gone, and the
crowd, as is usual at such places, was be-
coming impatient. Finally, as the sun was
rapidly nearing the horizon, the proprietor
made the announcement that he did not
think that he had gas enough in his balloon
for successful ascension, and as he could
not possibly make any more, still ne would
make an effort to ascend. He accordingly
seated himself in the basket and cut the
cord, the Office of which was to hold the
balloon to terra tfrnaa but, to the utter
disgust of the crowd, it set as still as an
old lumber wagon in potato patch. He
threw out his ballast, but still it would not
rise. He then stepped out of the car him.
self, but it refused to depart for the skies
even then. Now, it simply consisted of the
balloon with the ropes encircling it, ard
extending some feet below AT this june
ture, believing that it would not go up un-
der any circumstances, he carelessly relin-
quished his authority over it, and allowed
it to get into the hands of some boys, who
began to experiment by throwing pieces of
boards across the ropes and testing it in
that way. At last an orange boy threw a
narrow piece OF board across the ropes, not
more than four inches in width, and jump
ed on it, when to the amazement of all
present, it shot up like rocket, and before
any one could render him assistance he was
beyond reach. The string for opening the
valve and allowing the gas to escape had
been broken during the melee, and the boy
was at the mercy of circumstances over
which he had no control. It was an awful
moment, but scene Of sublime grandeur.
There was little boy suspended in mid
heaven, with nothing but board four inches
in width to sit on and string to hold to.
As he found himself going he yelled to his
partner, ""Jim, take care of my oranges !""


But little did any one who saw that spec
tacle believe that he would have any further
use for oranges. Up, up, up, higher and
higher and higher did he ascend, gradually
floating oceanward, until he hovered, mere
spect to view, over the city Of San Francis
co, VIXEN all at once counter current of
atmosphere struck him and rapidly carried
him over the Contra Costa range of noun
tains. He kept on ascending higher until
lost to view. We watched him in the
most breathless state of suspense that ever
mortals experienced-expecting every min
ute to see him tumble to earth, for no one
supposed that he could long retain his seat
on the narrow board, to say nothing of the
benumbing effect of cold upon him. There
was bitter feeling toward the owner Of the
balloon for his carelessness, and there were
not wanting those who freely canvassed
the propriety of lynching him. But when
the Sacramento steamer came in the follow
ing evening, to the amazement of every
body in San Francisco, the orange boy was
on it The balloon took course over
Martinez, crossed the bay, or straits, and
finally came down in the Suisun Valley,
when he went to farmhouse and remained
over night, and on the following day footed
it to Benicia and took passage on the steam
er enroute to San Francisco. His account
Of his voyage was more than thrilling it
was horrifying. He says that after tying
the board on which be sat to the rope, so
that it would cot fall out, he actually
climbed the rope to the balloon, distance
of ten or twelve feet, and with his knife
punctured it, in the hope that the gas would
escape and so descend to the earth But
of course he could only puncture it at the
bottom, where the gas could not escape
He said the view, as he passed over the
mountains, was grand beyond description.
San Francisco, Suisun. Sacramento, Marys-
vile, Stockton, San Jose, and, in fact, all
the towns within hundreds of miles, looked
as fthey were all huddled together beneath
him. He said: GAS was passing over
Martinez | took an orange out of my pocket
and dropped it, but didn't stop to see
whether they got it or not Had the bal
loon have descendeda little sooner he would
have been drowned in the straits. Taken
altogether, his preservation was the most
marvellous escape from terrible fate that
we had ever had any knowledge of.-Pet-

down from Columbia, IS. c., this season
on fishing excursions lasting from week
to fortnight. Why not bring the edl'
tional corps out some evening. bathe IN the
healthy waters, and be back to } our sane
tum at the regular hour next mosning.


We must defer to another article notice
of the Improvements at EIemlDgtOE, ana
the new places which ar9 being opened
along the line. Evidently somebody II
thinking all the time or these things would
not develop.


1t is subject of general congratuIatlon
that the murderer of Stanciii was so soon
ARE sted and that Sheriff Richardson has
succeeded in obtaining such mass Of evil
dence against him. Even the very earth
in which he cleaned his murderous axe has
been carefully removed in the state IN
which he left it, and boxed up for the con-
sideration of the Court and jury. Every
body says ''give him fair trial before the
Court, and although he has murdered a
quiet, industrious and peaceful citizen let
there be no mob Ia W brought against him -""
This is right and just as it should be. We
incline to the opinion that If every officer
of the law in the State would take the
same pains that the Sheriff of Columbus
does to arrest and bring TO justice offend
ers we should hear less of Ku- -kIux out
RACES, lynch law and Vigilance Commit
tees.

Church Born and educated in this town, de-
pending entirely upon self for his mental attain


mcn,s we feel sure that his future Is destined TO
cast lustrc upon the Conference 10 which he bc-
came attached two years ago.


Upon this occasion hc did himself credit. In

crucilicd with Christ"" he delivered n plain prac-


teal discourse upon the Importance Of christians
So living tina, the ""pcarl OF grca, price nny not


be a mere myth, but n reality. Al times he grew


sloaucnt, and IL could readily be perceived that
| he had made mn impression that we hope may be
| lasting. In the evening from the words, "" How


shall we escape IL We neglect so great salvation'
| he showed clearly from the words Dt scripture
| that there was none save the narrow road that


leads 10 iife Ills appeal 10 his former friends and
| old school mates, aboundcd in heartfelt feeling


for their welfare, and there was none in all that


large audience but felt proud Of the only minis
| ter of the gospel this city has ever sent forth:
| That he may become successful MS ""A great moral


teacher Is the wish OF all who were so highly ct-


icr,nined and instructed by his two sermons last


Sunday.

ming, by cutting her throat with pocket

girls. Her husband is in Baltimore.
CHICAGO, July 8.-A coroner's inquest


over the body of lynched man elected the
following facts:


Mary Meard, the mother of the child,
testified as follows:


My husband, Martin Meard whipped nv


son Martin, aged ten years, two weeks ago
Tuesday night; my babe was born that day,
and | did not see the whipping; it was
done in another room; heard the blows.
and heard the child beg for mercy; the
child went to bed about ten o'clock; the
next morning the child came to my bed
room, followed by his father, who
was whipping him very hard with
a blacksnake horsewhip; the child
lodged around the room to avoid the blows
and begged for mercy. The child was COM
pletely naked, his father having compelled
him to strip himself. His face was swollen
from the whipping he had received. The
night before his father whipped him very
hard for ten or fifteen minutes. At last he
stopped and told the child to put on his
shirt. He made an effort to do so and failed.
His father repeated the order, when
the boy said, II can't see, | can't see;''
""yOu can't see it e. responded his father;
""No, father, can't see you; can't see you;
boy with spirits and forced some down lis
throat; the child raised his hand, moved
his lips and expired; Meard then took the
body and put it under the bed where the
sick mother was lying, and it remained
there until evening, when he buried it.
The testimony OF the boys sister is still
more horrible.


At the Meard inquest, Sarah Meard,
daughter of the murderer, aged fourteen,
testified that her father often whipped her
brother very severely with a horsewhip.
On tuesday, two weeks ago, he brought my
brother in and said he had not worked, and
whipped him and knocked him down twice.
Father continued to whip him, and said he
up-he would whip the life out of him.
Two or three times he would say this. and

The body was entirely nude, and had been
shocklngly distorted in the effort to pack it in
so small space. In the top Of the trunk and

trunk was trlghttul. The trunk was but two
feet eight inches in length, yet the Young wo-
man Was over five feet IN height, aud had been
HtteraIly crushed into it. Her head was fore

THE PRESIDENTS FATHER.


PRESIDENT Grant has received dispatch from
Covlngton, KY, announcing that his father
was not considered dangerously ILL.,


THE PRESIDENTS MESSAGE ON CUBAN AFFAIRS


The President sent brief message to the
House to-day in response to resolution offered
by Gen. Banks on the 9th inst, requesting in
formation relative to the execution of medical
students at Havana and the failure of the Span
1sn government to carry out in the West India
colonies reforms voluntarily promised by the
statesmen of Spain in their correspondence. 1t
SHOWS that our government has continued to
urge the fulfillment of the emancipation de-
cfeeS anu Otner prominent reforms.


A letter from Vice Consul Hall details the
alleged action of the Havana authorities in the
matter OF execution of the students who were
alleged to have desecrated the grave of Casta-
non, and says that there were well founded ap-
prehenslons that a general massacre of Cubans
was intended, and to this possibly may be at
trlbuted the compromise with the volunteers
and the sacrifice of the young men,


Copies of the instructions of the Secretary of
the Navy to the Naval Commanders of the
United States, show that ON April Z, 1869, he
instructed Admiral Hoff that all citizens of the
United States native born or naturalized in
Cuba, engaged in lawful pursuits, respecting
the laws of the country and taking no part in
the measures to overthrow the government are
entitled to protection.
On May 9th, 1870, the Secretary notified Hoff
that while the United States wishes to observe
strict neutrality in regard to the difficulties
arising in Cuba, it cannot consent to our mer-
chant vessels being molested i'll lawful pur-
suits, or overhauled and examined unless found
committing some violation of the Spanish
authority. This they can only do by landing
arms and munition of war; 1t will be your
duty to give full protection to American citi-
zens and American commerce, whenever op-
portunity occurs.


On June Sd, 1870, the Secretary notified Ad-
miral Poor to keep some of his vessels station
ed on the north and south ends of Cuba or such
ports, as the so-called insurgents should con-
vene for escape.


While the Department does not desire you to
seek opportunities to encourage these distress
ed persons to seek protection of the United
States flag you will in no case refuse them
shelter on board the vessels of your fleet and
when they are once under the protection of
the flag, their persons and property are to be
held sacred against the Inference of the Span
lsh authorities. In no case will you give up
any person escaping the island except by au-
thority from this department.


Instructions were sent by the Secretary to
Rear Admiral Lee on the 18th of July, 1871 to
visit Santiago in the Severn or send some other
vessel to that port and elsewhere in the vicinity
for the protection, if necessary, of our citizens
and interests. On August 11th, 1871, the Ad-
miral was instructed to send vessel to inquire
into the subject of the Hornet Since the exc
cution of students at Havana, the United States
iron-clad Terror and steamers Nipsc and Kan
sas have been ordered to that port. On the 18th
inst, commander Weaver, the senior officer
present, called upon the Captain General in
company with the commander of the Nipsic
and Consul Hall He reports that they met
with a courteous reception and at the date of
the despatch (the 9th inst) the city was quiet
and orderly.


PROCLAMATION.


A Presidential proclamation declares that on
and after the 1st of January next, so long as
merchandise imported from any other country
excepting the Islands of Cuba and Porto Rico
into ports of Spain and the islands adjacent
thereto in vessels belonging to citizens of the
United States they shall be exempt from dis
duties, any such duties on mer-
Spanish vessels excepting from the Islands of
Cuba and Porto Rico shall be discontinued and
abolished"

Almost without an exception, More
house planters unite in Il general COM
plaint of the season. Some appear
gloomy and less hopeful than others,
it is true, but none wear very bright
faces in view of the chances. Every
body was sadly behind hand to begin
with, and then to this may be added
wind, rain and hail-one storm fol-
lowing another in quick succession, rem
ders the prospects anything but flatter-
ing.


CLAIBORNE.


The Advocate, we are glad to see, re-
appears, after the recent fire, in a new
dress, and retaining its original size.


The 2nd annual Fair of the Claiborne
Agricultural Society will be held in
October, commencing on the 25th and
continuing four days. Considerable in
terest is already felt in the exhibition.


FRANKLIN.


An imported Irish or Scotch laborer
named Blake, who went to Franklin
last March, has come to grief. AS a
man INSCRIPTIONS, as a laborer worse
than worthless and as a citizen a gen
eral nuisance, the people gave Blake a
warning to behave. The Sun, Of the
3rd tells the balance as follows:


Inscriptions and intrusive, he went
where he pleased and did as he pleased,
regardless as to who he pleased or dis
pleased. Taking a notion to Il widow
in the neighborhood, he sought to mar
ry her or possess her any how, but he
failed. He then commenced to work
on a young colored girl, and, watching
his opportunity, ravished her. This
act filled to over-fioWing the cup of
public forbearance towards him. He
was brought before Judge Lynch,
tried, convicted, and sentenced to be
hung and his body thrown into the
Bayou, and the sentence was duly ex-
ecuted on last Monday.


The crops in Franklin are very back
ward. The cotton, says the Sun, is al
most totally ruined by the winds and
rains.


ROSSIER.


d. Charles Minis, and two accom-
pliccs, killed Jas. Woolcy and shot
Jas. McCianallan three times while the
two were working in the field on the
23rd ult., in the vicinity of Fillmore.
The wives of Minis and McClanahan
are sisters, and it is supposed the
trouble grew out of McClanahan's in
reference in Mrs. Minis behalf, who
had been brutally treated by her hus-
band, the murderer. \ reward of $1,000
is offered for Minis delivery in the par
ish Jail Of Bossier. His description is
thus given in the Banner:


Minis is lean man six feet in hight,
about thirty years Old, fiorid complex
ion, with dark red or auburn hair, light
red beard and thin when worn, and
gray blue eyes. He weighs about one
hundred and forty-five pounds. His
complexion is Of the sort that burns in
the sun. Hands freckled. Several
wounds are thought to be on his body.
One gun shot wound, of considerable
SiZe,i on his left arm above the elbow.


Minis loves to trade horses, and often
plays the fiddle around groceries. He
came from Alabama to BoSsier parish
some three years ago, and has lately
resided in Rusk county, Texas,


JACKSON.


The Standard of the End, says there
will not be Il half-crop made in Jack
son, should the rains continue a few
days longer.


Vernon has had 4 concert and tab
lcau; proceeds about S16O net, to go to
repairs on churches.


The Record has two paragraphs, of a
discouraging character, in reference to
the crops. In places the heavy rains
have actually beaten down corn knee,
high. The farming interests, says the
Record, have suffered terribly, and
that paper ''counsels peas, potatoes and
economy""


Jno. l.. Barrett, Esq, is visiting Col
arado, and looking for Il new home.


Nose Daniels has 4 four-lerred
guinea-fowl; Mr.. Green has seen a two
headed snake, and Mr.. Webb has a hen
who has laid two eggs at the same eff
fort, one being within the other and
both having hard shells. We pass
Union for the present.


RICHLASD.
The crop prospects are noticed thus
by the Beacon of the 3rd:
After the long continued and hard
rains that we have had, we presume it
is perfectly safe to predict, even this
early, that there will scarcely be a half
crop OF cotton made in Louisiana thus
year. Leaving out of consideration the

varied by armed conflicts between the two

upon anarchy, and the only remedy for it lies in
the presence Of United States troops. Lynch

WASHINGTON, Jan. Q, 1871


The despatch received here this morning from
San Francisco announcing the total wreck OF the
United States steamer Saginaw and the loss Of four
OF her crew while attempting TO make landing on
the Island OF KanaI after having braved the perils
OF The ocean In q small open boat for more than q
month during which time they sailed over 1000
miles, created deep sensation among the COM
munity and fell like pail over the officials OF the
Navy Department In the brief details that
have reached here, and which In all proba-
hlllty will be oil that will be received Tor
some time to come, 1t Is thought by many
that tales of horror are hidden. Among the higher
naval officers stationed here are several who have
repeatedly traversed the waters contiguous to the





acquainted with the character of the shoals on which
the Saginaw was wrecked. These officers entertain
serious doubts OF the safety OF that portion OF the
ships crew which remained on Ocean Island. From
their description 1t appears to be bleak, barren
spot exposed to the erces fury OF the elements. and
wholly destitute of everything that would support
life. II 1t be true that quarter raons only were
issued to the ships company after the striking OF
the vessel these officers say that many must have per-
ished from starvation, the boats crew were much
| more literally rationed than their comrades, and
| yet their food was almost entirely exhausted in
the month spent at sea. Further developments are,
therefore looked for with anxiety, and the depart
ment has elegraphed to the United States Consul at
Honolulu TO transmit full details of the wrecklng Of
the vessel and the fate OF the survivors as soon as
he possibly ascertain them. 1t Is a matter OF
great surprise at the Navy Department that the
Saginaw should have been lost at that particular
point Ocean island Is far removed from the ordl
nary line Of travel, and is at least a thousand
miles from the Midway Islands, where the Saginaw
was supposed to have been engaged in taking
soundings preparatory TO the establish.
ment OF coalng station for the
steamers running between San Francisco and
Japan. On the chart the French Frlgate Shoals lie
in southwesterly direction from the Sandwich
Islands from which II is separated by parallel lines
OF reef. that TO reach the scene OF the wreck
vessel coming from the Midway Islands, which lie to
the north OF the Sandwich group would he forced to
| make long detour OF several hundred miles. In
the absence OF any known or supposed reason for
the presence OF the Saginaw at this point the de-
partment Is inclined 10 the opinion that she became
disabled in some way while at sea, and was forced
there by stress Of weather. The Saginaw was

Resolred, That this Convention in behalf
of the Republican party of Cecil county
cordially endorses the proceedings and
resolutions passed by the Republican State
Convention which met in Baltimore, on the
18th inst.


Resolred, That in the Hon. Jacob Tome
we recognize we'll tried public servant,
who has shown by his talents and business
capacity, that he is worthy the confidence
of all tax payers, as man Of great execu-
tive ability, who, as Governor of the State
of Maryland, would retrench the reckless
expenditure of public money for private
ends, which underDemocratic rule has sad
died the State with it's present heavy load
of debt.


Resolced, That the ticket we have this
day placed in the field is composed of gen.
tlemen Of intelligence, honesty and capa-
bility, whom we can cordially recommend
to the voters of Cecil county as in every
way worthy of their confidence and sup
port.


Resolced, That this Convention, believ-
ing the county expenses to be largely in
excess of the requirements of the public
necessities, owing to the fact that since the
accession to power of the Democratic party
in the State and county legislation has
been promoted looking more to the crea-
ton of offices and the expenditure of the
public money, for the reward of patty
fav Irites, than to the public interest,""
therefore, that we pledge the Republican
party to work for the repeal of all such
oDncxi ms laws and to a rigid policy of
retrenchment and economy in county AMI
State affairs.


Resoloed, That the expense to the people
of the offices of Clerk of the Circuit Court,
Register of Wills, Sheriff, Justice of the
Peace, etc., etc, are oppressive at their pre-
ent rates, and that great saving to the
people in their taxes and the transaction of
public business, might be affected by .ju.

the following handsome tribute to Hon
Carl Schurz, Senator from Missouri:
Carl Schurz, so far as we are capable OF
Judging, is the one man in the United
States Senate who recalls its former days
of greatness. At the capital structure
has grown grander and more magnificent,
the men in it have dwindled to intellectu.
al dwarfs No more spendid yarliamen-
tary edifce, so far as we know, can now
be found on the face of the earth; on
meaner set of legislators Throughout the
vast domains Of the universe


In critical, dark periods IN old times,
the cry used to arise, Look to the Sen
ate"" And men did look to it, as dis
tressed mariners to lighthouse. The
sky mig ght be overcast, the tempcs furious,
and the breakers roaring for their prey,
but as long as the steady, clear flame
could be seen from the lighthouse, the
most timid heart had hope. The great
names of Webster, Clay, Calhoun, were
in themselves an inspiration But how
is it now? Who looks to the Senate for
aught but encouragement failure and
modification The race OF giants has
disappeared from that arena. We can
think of but one man in that body who
deserves to be called at once q superior
debater, q scholar, and q statesman. This
is Carl Schurz And Carl Schurz is not
an American"

Found Dead.",,"We find the following account of the dsstl
of Col. j. :. Hay maker, Of Fort Smith in III,
81. Louis RYutiieaa Of the 27,h:


AN ARKANSAS BANKER TAKrs AN OVERDOSE


oF MoRPHINk.


Coli. ). Haymaker prominent man In the
Sout Invest WAS found dead in his bed at room
20 90 Barnum's hotel yesterday morning
Coroner Dudley was notified and promptly
repaired there TO make AN Informal eNanina'
ton


Col. Hsyinaker was originally from Woos-
ter, Ohio. and for SOME time past has been en-
gagged in heavy speculation. In tir vicinity
of Fcrt Smith. Ark. where his wife ane
daughter now reside. His property Is esti
mated at about $50 900. and We understand ht
i. PRECEDENT Of the National bank there. Al
n business man he has been regarded as among
the leading men there, and of good standing
lie had baen on a visit to his old home In
Wooster, Ohio. aud was on his Way home, anC
had talked OF leaving on Friday last.


During the afternoon or evening of Friday
he went to his room, and from then until yes
terdsy morning he was not seen IN life. The
chambermaid had been AT the room number
of times but could gain no entrance. Finally
she notified the man in charge OF the rooms
and access WAS gained and the corcner noti-
fled as above stated


Mr.. iaymaker appears to have gone 10 ms
room to rest and had laid aside his over and
uhdercoat and vest and got into bed with
his pant. on. When found he was lying on
his right side In comparatively AN easy posi-
ton as il death had come to him quietly and
with but little pain. The features even did
not indicate suffering. The left hand lay par
TALLY cramped under him. The deceased was
evidently about fifty years old He had full
beard, with hair heavily tinged with gray and
,1t .1a I.., In, Ia a.
been undisturbed. On searching the body
Coroner Dudley found some S275 In the pock-
cts, and valuable papers relating 10 land and
land excavation, etc.


The body WAS taken from Barnum's hotel
about noon and conveyed to Lynch's under
takers rooms on Olive street where the coro-
uer performed post-mortem examination
What had been the vital portions appear to
have been in n fair healthy condition, and IN
for two day, appearances Indicated that he
could not have died over ten or twelve hours
from the time OF discovery.


The Jury take charge Of the case this morn
ing, 1t IS not certain that the deceased had
any suicidal intention, although death is be-
llevcd TO have resulted from an over dose OF
morphine. A glass on the washstand had n
small amount OF this powerful narcotic evi-
IDENTIFY taken in water, aud in yalisc was
found vial 4 \ oz.l about two-thirds full.


Since the above was IN type We find in the
Fort Smith Ncer Era, the following state
ment;


Gen. Il. 7. Armstrong, who arrived here
Yesterday from St. Louis In company with
Mr. Frank Parkc. Mayor Of Scullyville, {. n
Both these gentlemen were frequently IN
company with Mr.. Haymakcr, who seemed TO
be very much troubled. The last seen OF the
latter was about 2 p, m. on Friday when ne
retired to his room. On sunday morning
Mr. Parke stated to Gen. Armstrong mat ne
feared that there was something wrong Win
Mr.. Ilavmaker and both went to his room,
but found It locked from the inside. lhe
chambermaid on being questioned, SAID that
she had not been able 10 get into the room ne
day previous. Gen. Armstrong on looking
through the transion, saw man lying on the
bed, h,l, could not see his face. Sending for
the proprietor and clerk, they forced the door
and found Mr. Ilaymaker In bed diNested OF
hi. coat. vest and boots with bis hand on the
side Of his head like person ENJOYING com
Portable nap, Every thing was in good order
about the room. His watch was beside him
and between . and 800 dollars were found on
his person. His valise was packed and locked
and everything had the appearance as though
the deceased had laid dow II to take some rest
before starting, as was known to have been
hi, intention. on the s p. IN. train for Little
Rock, That he took a sedstive to obtain the
desired rest was evident from the remains of
some morphine found In tumber on tho ia
bic. That lac took too much the sad result
proved. Gen. Armstrong thinks there was no
intention on the part of the decease to de-
stroy hie life."
