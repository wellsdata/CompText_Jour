tai affray at Leavenworth on the day of
election for Delegates to the constitutional
convention. The names of the parties we
have not been able to learn, one of them
being the Clerk of Judge Lecompte's court,
and the other former resident of that city,
who two years ago was tarred, feathered, and
sent down the Missouri River at the in
stigation of the first named. The latter in
dividual was standing at the polls in compa-
ny with anotheTperson, when the Clerk came
along and recognized his former victim, and
turning to companion, exclaimed, 'By
God, there's that id Abolitionist we sent
down the river The odd Abolitionist''
replied by an oath, and quick as thought
drew sword from cane In his hand and
pierced the clerk through the bowels. The
weapon went In on one side and came out
on the other. A great excitement imme-
diately ensued; the pro-slavery men rally
ing, threatened vengeance on the assailant,
and were preparing TO lynch him, when he
was rescued from their hands by the Free
State citizens, and placed in the custody of
the proper authorities We wonder whether
Lecompte or packed jury will convict this
person, after the late acquital of Fugit !."

The NAvIEs OF FRANCE AND ExGLAND-TLe
washington tRtOn OF the 9th INST, contains a
carefully prepared list Of the Navy of France.
from which we learn that it is COMPOSED #
3II sailing vessels, carrying 0,l76 guns. and
220 steamers carrying 90l guns-making a
total Of 537 vessels and 1907 guns Acco
ding to the Navy list Of Great Britain for 1856,
The effective force Of that coeptry was 2G9 SAL
Ing vessels, carrying 1862 guns, and 25s
steamers, with 4,0lS guns. 1t will thus be
seen that the Navy OF France exceeds that Of

This is u very small difference, and the uavies

rope may therefore be set down as about equal.

And this is the head and front of his offending in both
North and Souththe extreme sections ON the opposite
sides of Mason and Dixons line expected each that Mr.

and both are disappointed and dissatisfied but not 80 the

From tho Iarrisonburg Cva) Democrat


We invite the attention readers to the admirable
letter of President Buchanan in another column in reply
to set of natical theoogians and professors OF Connee
tcut who have arraned the President before the bar Of
public opinion for his policy in regard TO Kansas The
reply of the President is calm and dgnled and admins
ter whitening and crushing rebukc TO the meddesome
spirit of pio fanatics who attempt TO control the pot
cal movements of the country 1t beahes the spirit of
patriotism and should satisfy all of the determination Of
the President TO do his duty in the Kansas dculty in
defiance of protest of s clcrgynen and the denun
Citations of extremists of both sections The letter will
be read and endorsed with pleasure and satisfaction by
every conservative citizen Of the land


From the Milwaukee Cws) Daily Nows


President Buchanan then the elected executor Of
the laws and the Chief Magistrate of the people is guilty
of what? OF recognising the government that he, by
virtue of his office and in obedience TO the oath which he
has taken before the world appointed over Kansas and

finds them For doing that he is admonished by tho
forty clergymen that he defes the popular intelligence
and the judgments Of Heaven s'lf true, cooly the
President answers, these grave charges; and ho
proceeds in manner of irresistible logic to prove that
they are not true Ii is true indeed that he
but few arguments the whole case has before been
presented to the country but e arrays the facts and
gunens that yincate his administration so strikngy
that the fanatics when aided by the asute editor of
the Sentinel cannot get around them. The very men
to whom the opposition address their ncendiary appeals
instead 0unless we underestimate their shrewdncs)
of gulping down their candysticks of sophstry will
stand amazed that any person whom intellect and
culture have elevated to the post OF editor
should the doctrine that the President of the
United States may choice as to the laws he
shall admnister-when he is to see that ""(AID

He must do it or reract his unmanly structures upon

But if this letter is the monstrous production that the
Sentinel declares it s why does not that paper publish

the Sentinel under the dark wing of aboitionism, wishes
to grope in the bacness of negro equality why it can
The people, however, are going another way.


From the Lynchburg Cva) Republican.


According TO our promise we present in full this
ing the letter of President Buchanan to Professor Sill
mans committee of New England abolitionists. II is
able and patriotic document and is cutting rebukc
to those who provoked it by their ocious inermcddng
in affairs which did not concern them, and about which
they evidently knew nothing.


From the Bay State.


There has been SO much misrepresentation about af
fairs in Kansas 80 many contradictory accounts and
MANY wjlfu and apparently malicious misstatemcns of
the true issue and the position which the national gov
holds in relation to it, that all who not in
sanely bound to party and rasly influenced by mere
party spirit will hail with pleasure and read with high
satisfaction the calm and dgned answer of President
Buchanan who, while he annihates those who rashly
and ignoranty assai him, puts the whole Kansas ques
ton in so clear light that it cannot be misunderstood
and the government in strong position that 1t can
not be oyerthrown.


We are glad that the President has considered this mat
ter Of sufficient Importance to make it the subject of com
ment before the people The right of any body of elec
tors to address the President in respectful way cannot
be questioned and when their petitions, remonsan
ces, advice brought before the public in such
manner to do injustice to him whom they have ad
dressed and the administration of which he is the head
it equally clear that it is his privilege nay more, it
his duty under the solemn obligations that rest upon
himo vndicate himself and tho government of which
he is the head the true position before the people


1t is for these that we heartily commend the
course taken by President Buchanan in replying to the
communication addressed to him. We in it the gen
une, democratic, jackson spirit. We see in it that
which, if mistake not, many more than those who
aided in elevatng him to his high position will commend
and which cannot but have great influence In engh
ming the public mind upon the true issue involved in
Kansas question. There politicians who are de-
ned that the Kansas difficulties shall not be settled
Th, Occupation is gone when affairs quiet in Kan
sas al hence Kansas must keep bleeding to satisfy their
insatiate thirst for place and power.


From the Binghamton N. Y) Democrat


We publish this week the memorial of sundry Connec-
tcut ministers to the President of the United States on
the subject of affairs in Kansas, which has to be
known the protest of the forty clcrgymen together
with the Presidents answer We invite their careful pc
rusal Extended comment is entirely unnecessary. IL
will be that political prejudice and priesty imperti
and ignorance rebuked in terms pointed,
dignifed and just to leave nothing which the most
ardent democrat wamest friend of the President could
wish said or left unsaid


From the Ectrot Free Press.


Had these parsons and professors understood the merits
of the question involved they doubtless would have been
guilty of the impernence of presumng to instruct the
President of the United States in his duties But being
profoundly ignorant Of the merits of the question they
have In their action, made themselves douby ridiculous
before the world Parsons and professors pretty
to make themselves ridiculous whenever they leave their
appropriate concerns and interfere with affairs with
which they have Perhaps it would have been
the part of charity for Mr. Buchanan in this instance to
have forbone exposure Of the mpertnence and gno
of his correspondents but he evidently deemed that
considerations of charity ought TO give way TO consdea
tons of truth and right."

.,os Thomas Lynch, alias Punkins, convicted
:, The late term of the Court of Sessions of
rraud larceny, and sentenced to three years
;mprisonment in the State Prison, made an at
tempt last Saturday evening to escape from the
;au. He was securely hand-cuffed, and bar
.f iron was fastened to each of the shackles, so
ss TO keep his hands some tive feet apart. The
handouts were riveted closely around his wrists,
and we're the same formerly used on Moore.
Hs first broke the iron bar near one end, by
putting it under rock which he had loosened
from the cell floor, aud then broke the rivets
which fastened the handouts. He then put the
bar through the CRATE door and pried off one OF
the locks that fastened the door down, and pried
the door off from its hinges, so that il could be
ouened with little difficulty. His intention was,
As he says himself to knock the jailor in the
head with the iron bar, when he brought in his
food on Saturday evening, but he heard so ma
nv people around the Jail that evening that he
concluded to defer the attempt until q more Ia
yorable opportunity presented ITSELF The next
morning. Mr.. Lindsey the jalor, discovered
that the door was out of place, which lead to
an examination and the detection of the plan OF
escape He has since been confined more secure
ly, If possible, than before. The breaking OF
the iron bar and rvets which fastened the hand
cuffs must have been a severe operation, as his
wrists are now swollen to near double the ordl-
nary size. Edwards answers the description OF
prisoner who escaped from the penltentlary
short time since, by the name of Thos. Lynch
alias Punkins.


Since the above was in type, we learn that
Edwards again broke the iron bar which fasten-
ed the shackles on his wrists, yesterday after
noon. The bar is about aa inch in diameter
and how he managed to break it, hand-cufeo
as he was, is more than we can account fer."

that il was ia the cases cited The Lecompton con-
venton called by act Of the very Legislature
which the blackrepublicans denounced as illegal aud
invalid and which the editor of the Press and other
democrats, recognised valid legislative body.
The elections now held in pursuance OF that act
and the convention to all ntents and purposes,
was legally constituted body-tegGity constituted by
the admissions of all democrats, hlcladng Presi-
dent Buchanan, Governor Walker and, we believe,
the editor of the Press. But what do the black
republicans say Of that conyention7 Exactly what
they said of the Legislature which called it into
existenee--that the law which originated il was
invalid that the delegates which constituted il
chosen by minority Of the people; and that
it did not represent ''the viii of the majority and
was therefore bogus assemblage. What is the
answer to these positions! Just what it was be-
fore--that the law calling the convention valid |;
that the people Of Kansas had full and fair oppor
tunity to vote for delegates that il their own
fault if they refused to vote that the delegates
were legally chosen and constituted legal conven-
ton. II the majority of the inhabitants refused to
vote for delegates il does not follow that the cleo
tons were void or that the convention not valid.
THE WILL OF THE MAJORITY CAN ONLY REcoo-
NIsED THROUGH LEGAL AND LEGITIMATE CHANNELS


We believe that the editor of the Press has not in


times past hestaed to admit the legality Of the Kan
sas conventon---in this respect differing from the
black-repubhcans--but whilst he has conceded the
validity of the law which originated tho convention
and the legality of the convention itself, he insists
that because it is said by the black-repubcan oppo-
nents of the Kansas convention that its action is not
in accordance with ''the will of the majority there
fore, in Difference to that great doctrine, he de-
nounces the convention, repudiates its action and


joins with the backrepublicans in clamoring for the
rejection of the Kansas constitution by the admins


ration and by Congress-. He is exactly in the posi-
tion of the black-repubcans whom he so gallantly
fought in former contesshe is perverting and mis-
applying tho great principle that the will of the maori
ty should prevail. Such perversions Of that princi-
pie could justify mobs lynchlaw, and all overthrow
of law and order."

EXcITEMENT.-During the late Christmas
holidays, information having been received
in Scottsville that Benjamin Hunt, citi-
zen of this county, residing near that vii
lage, had been using language tending to
encourage insurrectionary movements
among the slave population, deputation
of several citizens repaired to his residence
to arrest him. On being brought to the
village, the charges against him were sub
jected to a rigid investigation, and during
the examination, the following facts were
incontestibly proved One witness testi-
fed that he had heard Hunt say that the
white man had no more right of ownership
IN the negro than the negro had in the
white man, and if it came to the test, he
would sooner fight for the negroes than
the white people. Another witness testi-
fed that he had heard him say that he
would have rejoiced in the election of Ere
mont, as in that event the negroes would
have been freed; and that in case of a col
lision between the whites and blacks. he
would take the side opposed to the white
people; whereupon the indignant populaee
seized and compelled him. to be ridden
upon rail, borne by several stout negro
men, through the streets. When they
had paraded him through the streets to
their hearts content, they were ordered to
take him to a more retired part of the vii
lage and administer an application of tai
and feathers, which they did with equal
satisfaction and delight. When this was
done he was ordered to leave the county
within ten days, and seek his fortunes
where the institutions were better adapted
to his anti-slavery feelings. = Charlottesville

Journal of Commerce, in q highly aggravated state
of mind, looks forward with disgust and bitterness
of spirit, not unmxed with certain degree Of
alarm, to the discussions of the Slavery question


likely to occur in those meetings, and which, indeed,
in one religious conyOcation now holding its meet
ings in our neghborhood, have already commenced.


The attention of The Journal Of Commerce is
principally directed to the two Presbyterian Assem-
bles in whose welfare its interest Is hardly less
deep than,in the course of the cotton market and
the fourishing state Of trade generally. As the
Old School Presbyterian Assembly is to meet o.
Lexington, Kentucky-a part OF tse country, as
The Journal delicaely hints, not favorable 10 the
Operations of Abolitonists""-it seems to entertain
pleasing hope that wholesome dread Of bowie
knives, gutta -perchs canes and lynch law may keep
the discussions of that reverend body within rea-
sonable bounds and that the opponents OF Slavery
who have seats in it may be induced, by considera-
tons of personal safey-hsving the fate OF Senator
Sumner before their eyes-to defer their onset till
the next year, when they may expect to provoke q
battle on free soil.


No such consolation. however, offers itself 10 the
nase of the New School Assembly, which is TO meet
At Cleveland. Ohio. set down by The Journal Of
Commerce as ""a very different sort Of place""
As no exterior influences exist there for enforcing
gag law, The Journal expects, to use It's own ele-
CANT phraseology the ""blowing OF OF great deal
of steam"" For our part, we think the Assembly
will be lucky to escape with nothing worse than
steam. even if it should prove OF the hottest and
most scadina sort. 1t has occasionally happened
in that Assembly, if We mistake not, that some of
the Pro-Slayery diyines in their easerness TO with
draw subject so delicate from Pubhe inspection,
have attempted to surround it with what had very
much the odor and pitehy darkness Of smoke from
the bottOmless pit.


In anticipation of what is likely to come, The


Journal of Commerce goes back with JUNCTION to the
halcyon times of 1918, when the Presbyterian
Church wss q unit on the subject when both
North and South concurred in passing strong reso
lutions about their desire TO obtain the complete
abolition of Slavery throughout ChristendOm, and,
| if possible, throughout the world That similar
harmonious sentiment on this question does not ex
st at this moment The Journal Of Commerce
charges entirely to the violence of the AntSavey
men. No. content with merely good desires as to


what somebody else might do hereafter; forgetting

OF whom had been tried and aen.eaced 10

One Of the Prisoner had murdered his

murdered an old man and his wife, in or-

An attempt was made ON the night of the 24th of oc

issued order for re-arres but the criminal still ut
large at the latest accounts being kept in concealmcnt by
his friends Mr.. Monsolves wounds not very severe,
he expected TO be able to his business in
eight or ten days.


The Assembly of Panama has passed act of pardon
in the matter of the persons engaged in the lynchng OF
the murderers of Mr. f. Tracy in Iaboga in May 1868.
The Aspinwall Courier states that the railroad bridge
the Chagres river rapidly approaching completion,
and is expected to be entirely finished during the present
month


The Panama Herald says


private letter from San Jose states that troops had
been ordered by Costa Rca to Fort San Carlos and the
report is confirmed by letters from San Juan del Note,
which say that Costa Rca is determined to hold the river
until the transit question is definitely arranged


There has been later arrival from the southern coast
but the following extracts from letters in the Panama
Herald furnish additional information

ol our contemporaries appear to bc considerably
alarmed at the formation Of Vigilance Committee
for the protection of their property and lives by
the citizens of two OF our Wards. But Vigilance
Committee, per SC. is not necessarily affair from
which any evil consequences are to be appre-
hcnded, but just the reverse. When a Vigilance
Committee transcends the limits within which any
:tizen may act in selfdefcnce, then it will be
come amenable to the laws, and be dealt with as
any other disturbcr of the public peace would be
but until these Vigilance Committees sha II be
gElty Of taking the law into their own hands and
infctng summary punishment upon offenders,
we think they are to be commended rather than
condemned. 1t does not by any means follow
that Vigilance Committee in New York must
infict Lynch-law upon offenders, because Vigi-
lance Committee did so in California. There are
private watchmen all over the city, and in Brook
lyn. and we imagine that nothing more viii be
attempted by the Vigilance Committee of the
Fifth and Eighth Wards, than to establish pri-
vate watch OH a large scale. If the Police De-

good working order, so that our citizens shall

too often causes mortality at sea. When the
passengers were transhipped into the Orinoco
at st. Thsmas it was hoped that the pestilence
wus left behind. Quite the contrary for, with
out going into the distressing details of each

death he called some ofhis neighbors, and told

communicate to them. He then stated thet he
had for thirty years been connected with gang
of robbers aud counterieiters; that he had
never stolen any hlnseli, but had concealed a
large amount of stolen property; that the band
he belonged to was Composed of some hundred
and fifty persons, well organized, and some et

 In the county of Giles, in Virginia any amount of the very best burr millstones can be had. The valuable properties of the burr mill stone consist in its exceeding tough hardness, and sharp serrated cellular porosity And in the adjoining county of Montgomery, white flint conglomerate stone aboundS, which is ex- tenslvey manufactured into miistones that can- not be surpassed. Mr. Hawkins, near the line of Bedford and Campbell counties, near the Lynchburg and Tennessee railroad, has a quarry of white flint of quartz which has the most singular character of cleavage in every direc- tlon; which property combined with its exceed ing hardness and coseness of grain and texture qualities it for mllstones of the first rank. par ticularly for making flour. In Greenbrier and Monroe counties, conglomerate stone of va. rlous character exists, out of which milstones are made that cannot be surpassed iu usefulness by any other.

 In Giles county, Virginia, near Newport, the finest Photographic marble exists; in the coun- tv, and those adjoining of Wythe, Smyth Washington and Cabell, the black marble and black most beautifully interspersed with white veins; also, the white, gray. red, yellow, and the variegated are found in large bodies.

 The same section of country likewise has the best stone for grind and whetstones The best of olstone is found in mary places in the same, and in many other places in the counties oi the State, east of the Blue Ridge have in my possession as specimens, several hundred va rleties. Among them are several kinds snpe- C.

 can be had in Monroe county. south, and with. in mile of the Red Sulphur Spring. Noim- ported hone can surpass or scarcely equal them

 On the farm of General Cooke, on the Ja- ques river canal, sxty-fve miles below Lynch burg, is quarry of the best oistone for car penters' tools; he has had fence built of it. From Arkansas and Missouri, stones can be had which, when fabricated with oi cannot be exceled by any found elsewhere, for shar- penlnS razors, engraving instruments or tools winch require fine smooth edge; the hardest steel cannot scratch them. The white and vel low stones found near Deep river, North Ca roiina, for tools are not surpassed by any

 In various localities near the Blue Ridge and each other throughout its whole range, very valuable stones sharpeners for tools exist And in the whole range of the Allegheny mountaln and the numerous ridges connected with 1t, are vast beds of valuable stones, i'm. portant for sharpening tools, mllstones, build ing etc.

 Plaster of gypsum, of the very best kind is found in northwestern Virginia, New York, and on the waters of Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico etc.

 Coal and iron of inex haustibe abundance and ot several or all varieties of each of the finest quality, are found throughout the whole val ley of the Mississippi, from the Allegheny mountain to the base of the Rocky noun tnin"

France and Kansas.


There is a marked resemblance between
France and Kansas. We do not wish t
be understood as saying that Lecomptol
is like Paris, that there are any Boulevard
at least not any levelled into streets
in Lawrence, or thatany in Ossawatomie ar
altogether up to. the Louvre or the Arc d
| l'Etoile. We do not mean to say that tn
Big Blue flows through so cultivated an,
embellished landscape as the Seine, 0
the Kickapoo Rangers will compare wit
the Zouaves and the Curiassiers of tn
line; and we nave no idea that the bes
eating house in all Wyandott could pos
sibly be mistaken for the Trois Freres, G
the Maison Doree. We make no sue
pretensions. But in the way of govern
ment we will put the Democratic rule i
Kansas against any tyranny from the day
of Nero down to Bomba of Naples. En
| gland may boast of her Jeffreys, but w
proudly answer the braggart with LIE
compte; Spain may bring forward he
Alva, and Austria her Haynau; we ca
match them with dozen volunteer so
diers in Kansas, who have happily unite
all the cruelties of civilization with th
native ferocity Of the savages, over who's
grounds they have driven the men an
women guilty of opinions favorable
| freedom.


But tits in the government of Kansas tn;
we find the resemblance to France. Lou
! Napoleon would make capital pro-sl;
very Democrat. He believes in popul;
sovereignty and holds his place by virtu
of it. but he modifes it by external fore
and expounds its principles by seer
police and a standing army; he holds


universal suffrage, yet allows nobody


vote against his government, or only
many as may give it the appearance of

ends, he governs France much as IL

EFFECT OF THE New ASTI-GaMBLING LAW
Last night, says the San Francisco Herald, not
q light was seen to burn III any OF the gam
bling houses on Commercial street. nor were
there any people to be found standing around
the doors This was owing to the new gam
bling law, which makes it felony to be found
either dealing or betting in game of chance.


ANOTHER OUTRAGE-The Governor Of Cali
fornia and the Supreme Court of the State seem
determined to vindicate murder, and reward
with ""a premium the many bloody deeds
which are daily occurring around u.s. But
few months since and the whole social system
OF this State was agitated, and all the better
feelings of our human nature turned into a aspirit
of fearful retaliation and revenge, by the COW
ardly murder of Mr.. Wesley Bond, near Sonora,
by two stab and shootruffians of Tuolumne coun
ty, who had long deserved the hangmans rope.
The murderer's were promptly arrested, tried
and convicted, but now comes in the Executive
and the Judicial officers of the State, and pro-
tect the criminals from the ends of Justice. On
learning these facts, ION the day set for the ex-
ecution, Friday, May lst inst. apublc meet
ing was called at Sonora, which would have
doubtless ended in summary executing the
prisoners by the lynch process, if the father of
the murdered man had not advised differently.
In commenting, freely, on this excitement, the
Sonora Herald, says:


AT o'clock P. NJ. meeting was held at the
Court House, for the purpose of ascertaininp
the general sentiment regarding the stay of pro-
ceedings in the cases of the criminals. fMc
Cauley and Davis. The meeting was addressed
by Mr. Geo. M. Bond, father of Wesley Bond.
the young man who was murdered by McCau
ley. Mr.. B. counselled the asscmbage to let
the law take its course, which had the effect of
calming any who might have been inclined to
resort to violent measures With q determin-
alton to abide the action Of the law. the meeting
dispersed.


4"" 1t is evident from these proceedings, that
there is great deal of feeling abroad in the
community relative to the many horrid murders
perpetrated in this county the past year, and
strong desire to see commensurate punishment
inflicted. tits hoped that this feeling will con-
tinue to manifest itself, until all the wretches





expiated their crimes Oh the galows""


Again says the Herald:


GA MocKERY OF JUsT1cE-The recent action
OF the Supreme Court and Governor Johnson
In granting stay of proceedings and a respite
to the murderers, McCauley and Davis, who
were to have been executed yesterday, affords
positive evidence ofhow unjusty the laws are ad-
mlnlstered and how untrustworthy are those
high III station and power in California We are
lrreslstably led to the conclusion that the action
OF those officers, in interposing and postponing
the execution of the sentence of the law on
these convicted criminals, has been procured
through corrupt means. These prisoners or
their friends, must be using money somewhere
or they would not be able thus to battle Justice
II this is so, then the next thing that we shall
hear will be, that Governor Johnson has granted
communication of sentence to both of these
criminals.
What mockery is law in California what
stranger is justice A foul murder is COM
mitted, the murderer is convicted by Jury |
sentence OF death is passed on him. and still his |
money or the corruption of those in high place |
stays the execution of his sentence from month |
to month, and affords him opportunities to es-
cape the dread vengeance of the law. Thus it !
is that the law and its officers are brought into
contempt, and the people driven to the dread |





turning executioners themselves.
""We warn those corrupt officials occupying
high stations at the capital, that they had bet
ter not trample on the patience of the people
too much. Their next corrupt act may be more
than the people endure; it may lead to their
being hurled ANONYMOUSLY from their posi-
tions. The jail of Tuolumne is now filled with
murderers of the deepest dye: the people here
are determined that they shall be punished
and Gov. Johnson had better not interpose his
clemency, especially when suspicious enter
tanned that it is purchased""
STILL ANOTHER OuTRAGE-SExTEScE OF BLAIR
CoMMUTED-Chas. f. Blair, sometime since
convicted of killing Chinaman in Shasta
county, has had his sentence committed from
death to Imprisonment for life. The petition
was numerously signed, but there appears to be
conflict Of opinion upon the propricty of the
commutation. The Shasta Courier, which op-
poses it, says:
I"" If Imprisonment for life meant for life, then
perhaps we might have no reason to complain,
but when our land is infested by robbers, and
robbers let loose upon US through Executive
clemency, we think we have reason for COM
plant A man who will murder Chnaman
will kill any one else, if he can do it without in
curing personal Danger, ana tllS same man
would. if guilty of the offence with which he
stands convicted be an invaluable auxiliary to
the Trinity murderers and robbers

true sense, consist only in constant, active
excrtion, not only of the body, but also of

OPENING OF TUE SPRINGS. We understand that the

near Warrenton, Virginia. Mcssrs. Baker Ingram have
determined to open to the public this popular place of

of complaints being made of the extreme heat of the past
few days, and feel quite that those who will
avail themselves of the refuge thus offered to them

Judge Lake, the Agent of Wells, Fargo

and officers were all out with a will after
the robbers and treasure A messenger
was sent to Vallecito and Murphy's, and in
short time those camps had their best
detective police, their merchants and Off
GERS at the scene of the robbery The
tracks of the robbers were found and meas
ured; they were on foot, consequently, they
were in the neighborhood-the money was
a heavy load, and it must be near, for it
could not be carried far by .three men,
which was the number who attacked the
stage Thus reasoning, the tracks were
followed over the soft ground, and so long
as they were deep and heavy made, they
knew the treasure was before them. But
when they became light, the party sepa-
rated, some to find the money, (for the rob-
bers had, part of the way, taken to the
creek and followed its watery coursc) and
others to trail them over the hills and
through the woods till they were lodged in
a cabin near the g forks of the road""

and the man David Waldin who had them
on, was arrested. Being taken out and
promised and threatened by officers Shroe
bel and Robedee, he finally made clean
breast of it, and told the names of the
other two, and started to go and show
where the money was buried But before
he got there, it was found by the other
party hunting for it.


Cpon his information the officers pro-
ceeded to arrest most base and desperate
character who has been hanging round this
Camp for several months, known as Bic
Brown. They also arrested another noted
parsonage by the name of Harry Browning,
for whom it has been predicted for years
by those who have known him, that he
never would de natural death. The
citizens arrested man whose name have
not learned correctly-but think it was
Langly-with whose hammer the box was
broken open. He was mining near the
place and the robbers had got the hammer
from his sluices. But when the constables
saw him they detained him for the COM
mission of robbery in Campo Seco and
in Jenny Lind.


The officers from all parts of the county,
were present In an incredible short time, and /
were active and vigilant in their duties.
The person who turned States evidence
and the one detained for robbery at Campo
Seco, were taken by the Deputy Sheriff
out of town towards Mokelumne Hill, but
the other two are here In irons There
was great excitement at one time, and
had not the money been recovered there
would probably have been some lynching.
But as it is now, all are rejoiced at the sue
cess in finding the treasure and the arrest

need be anticipated, although they are

the lynchings which have recently taken place
in Iowa were called by their right name. The
hanging of William B. Thomas, in Montezuma,
was as foul murder as was ever perpretrated
by midnight assassin The Oshkosh Herald
gives the following additional particulars of the
event:


""No sooner was the decision of the Court CIV
en- [changng the venue, in order that he might
have fair trial. than a regular organized mob
of about two hundred men proceeded TO the old
court house, where the prisoner was confined,
and demanded and by force took Thomas from
the custody of the sheriff, and amid the terrfy-
| ing shrieks OF the prisoner and the most hellsh
revelings of the mob. carried him away to q
tree which they had previously prepared, in the
suburbs of the town. Here, without even ad-
herring to the customs of lynch law, or abiding
by the honor of mob force, they placed the rope
around the prisoners neck, and demanded q
confession of the crime The prisoner plead his
innocence. The rope was drawn over limb
and the prisoner swung into the air. After
few struggles he was let down, and again de-
manded to make confession. Again he plead
innocent Of the crime. Again he was hung up,
and fire kindled beneath his feet. The mob
threatened to burn him if he did not confess the
murder Again he was let down. From the
strangulaton received he had lost his strength
and his voice. The mob still demanded con
fesson The prisoner, in the faintness of death,
persisted that he was innocent Again he was
hung up, where be remained until he was dead.


The Herald says that this makes the tenth vic
tim of mob violence in Iowa since the first Of
April-four in Jackson, five in Cedar, and one
in Poweshiek."

There is no doubt difficulty the authority of the

issued The naked questions then presented whether
the United States government has the power to enforce
the process of its courts within the State of Ohio whether
the popuace or State authorities upon their private

of Congress aside and disregard the authority of the
federal Judiciary and whether the general government

dark and damnable deed, and blight forever the
hope of heart that was concious Of its own pu-

essary to find some man who was competent to
act as just and impartial Judge, While the dis
cussion in reference to the propriety of this step
was being carried on there were many who did
not participate, but who were intent upon apply
ing the dictum of Judge Lynch. This rash inten-
ton was however abandoned and by vote of the
assembled multitude it was resolved to give the
young gentleman trial, and if found guilty, to
inilict the punishment his crime deserved.


Our old friend Portable was unanimously elect
ed Judge. He presided with dignity, and decid-
ed with unorng judgement. The plaintiff in
the case was young lady Of about 10 years, and
Of great beauty and refinement. The defendant
was young man who had many friends and who
possessed the advantages of finished education
He had also knowledge Of the law, and was per
mitted TO act in this case as his own attorney
lie seemed in measure proud Of lhc OCCASION
while every one else predicted it to be the dark
est hour that had ever cast its shadows on the ray
and accomplished libcrline. The young lady's
honor and virtue was as pure now as ever, but

ed the crowd who were seated in circle on the
ground, as follows


Fellow citizens Though informality may
to some extent characterize our proceedings, it
ought not to defeat the ends of justice | feel
that yon have imposed upon me Il solemn and i'm
portant duty. 1t is true | am not acting under
thc power of a sealed commission, nor under the
solemnity of an oath but the heart conscious Of

only remains now for you gentlemen. to select
some person to prosecute without this we shall
not be able to proceed with the trial""


Here then was a halt. The difficulty of find
ing some one who would undertake the prosecu-
tion was evident. The friends of the defendant
were chucklng with sort of triumph apeing
at the same time singular sympathetic decep-
ton, which endeayored to cast de pair upon the
young lady's case. The defendant superior tai
ents his power to express his scorn the confu
sion he was bound to throw the plaintiff in the
probable shame and contempt which his oratori-
cal powers might bring upon the dofenceless wo-
man the rdicule, suspicion and notorety which
would undoubtedly follow the innocent plainti1.
was all talked over with a cool delberation and
mock seriousness Of countenance by the defend
ants friends, that had nothing real but the char
acteristics of shrewd villiany. The young la
dy at this juncture made her appearance, and ad-
dressed the Court as follows:


""May it please your Honor, am but feeble
woman, and cannot plead my own cause, but
when say have not been fortunate enough un-
Ill within the last half hour to secure the service
of counsel, speak not for the purpose of elicit
ing sympathy or partialty in my favor nor do
desire to brand the ioTeheads Of the assembled
multitude with shame who should by every emo
bling quality implanted in the heart of man,
have been the first to demand ample reparation
for an injured womans insulted honor but may
it please your Honor, gentleman who has been
absent all day on hunting excursion, and has
just returned has kindly volunteered to act as my
counsel. / have stated to him my case, and tho
a stranger to me, have yet the assurance that
have found an able and honest advocate, who
will present my grievance to you fully, and also
present the black-hearted demon who stands tc
my left in his true light


When she had finished these remarks the men
who sympathized with her, and who would have
torn to pieces the defendant if she had only de
mandcd his death, began to warm up and smile
in each others faces at the hope of seeing her in
sulter punished


The defendants face colored and mortifyinl
grin played upon his lip, which plainly told tina
his feelings had undergone great change with
in the last half hour. All eyes were turned
quickly upon tall young man who entered th'
ring exactly in front Of the Judge. Her counsel

Editor Herad,-Dear Sir: As the day
Of election approaches, so do office seekers;
and | wish to inform you. that we had
one Of the most extensive fzzles here that
| have ever seen in the way of political
demonstration. According to notice the
people assembled to hear three Of the Black
Republican Champions. The two candi-
dates for, State Senate, and one Representa-
tive. The audience was composed of nine
Republicans seven K. Ms. and seventeen
Democrats. Speaker No. l was introduced
and told us that in consequence Of the au-
dience being small, and none of his ''com-
petitioners"" being present, it would be hard
work to speak.


He pitched into John B. Weller for
slandering his party Then taking up his
national platform, denounced S. A. Doug
las AS a traitor to every moral virtue; said
he loved Andrew Jackson, and believed
that the Slaveocracy should be excluded
from our territories; and finally went in
for reform in our State Government. Speak.
er No. 2. said how he was no public speak
or. No. 8. about the same.


Friend Lynch was then called out by
the audience and repled-literaly ami
hilating the Republican doctrines,-in fact
did not leave cease spot. Col. Newman
closed the discussion at late hour, when,
three cheers long and loud went up for
Weller and Democracy. Nary one, for
Stanly. JAcK."

Hon. C. E. WILLIAMS, Presiding.",,"Court met pursuant to adjournment.


The jury in the Clpfell case came into
Court and returned a verdict of murder in
the second degree. The Court set Saturdy
the 14th inst. as the time for sentence At
torneys for defendant gave notice of motion
for new trial.


The case OF Hess & Larcomb vs.. Samuel
Bliler, was by consent, stricken from the
calendar.


In the case of the people vs.. Charles Jones,
indicted for murder, the following persons
were empanneled as trial jurors:

The following evidence Of Mr.. Kleine sets
forth the merits of the case more fully than
we can otherwise detail them, he being the
District Attorney at the date of the alleged
murder, and having interested himself to
learn the facts. Mr.. Kleine being sworn,
said

there late in the afternoon, and stopped at a
cabin on the outskirts Of the town One of
the party went into town for provisions,
after which proposition was made to rob
Chinese camp. They planned the attack,
and about 8 o'clock they went to the camp
1t was arranged that defendant should stand
guard while the others committed the
robbery. The three then went toward the
cabin one of them knocked at the door; it
was opened by a Chinamhn; soon after the
door was opened n shot was fired, (probably
by the Chinaman) after which two othsr
other shots followed, (these we're fired by the
robbers) Immediately after the firing they
all retreated One of the party remarked
shots. They all started for the Oregon
House, from where they went to the Yuba
river, in the vicinity of which the party was
arrested, and taken to Bangor, where, pend
ing an examination before magistrate they
were all taken out by the mob to be hung
When at the tree, the other robbers had told
the crowd that defendant was innocent of
murder, whereupon he was released.

of the families are brothers and originally
from Chill. They are each the father of
a prodigy of devils, incarnate, and one of
the sons of the Mexican Garcia family was
a captain of the company which butchered
Crabb and his party, and 1t aoos done IN
a spirit Of rsuenge, for the lynching of his
cousins in California When we landed
in California, there were seven of these
Garcia boys, now there are but two living,
and one of them is destitute of LEG which
he lost fighting against Fremont, at the
battle of the Salinas, near Monterey; the
other five were either killed in pot-house
broils, or were strangled by the lynch
code. Not more than three months since
one of them was hanged in the Monterey
jail, by the people, for the murders of
Messrs. Wall, Williamson, Hardmont, Lay
ton, and some other well known citizens of
Monterey. So that it was a Garcia, in the
foul spirit of rerenge, who brought about
this outrage by the numbering of innocent
parties. For five years we lived in Mon
terey, close by the Garcias, and there it
was an old adage, ""wherever there is a
Garcia, there is danger to an American""
May not this saying also be known in
Mexico?


We were personally acquainted with
Hon. Henry A. Crabb and Rasey Biyen,
and know that they were brave and gen
erous, to a fault, and would be the last men
to enter into an expedition to Fillibuster
any country outof dollars worth of prop
erty. AS to the report that Crabb's party
fired on Roderigues and party, while ap-
preaching with white flag, it needs con-
frmation,-we do not believe it.


Should Walker fail, and lose all by his
illibustering career, we might regret his
misfortune, but would have no sympathy
for the man, as he has boldly and defantly
trampled on the rights of those whose in
terests he pretends to be subscribing.


We hope "" Mustang"" will freely give
us his views and opinions on this and all
other "" expeditions, and also discriminate
between Crabb, Crittenden, Lopez, Walker,
Crockett, Milan, Travis, and Kinney, who
have from time to time suffered from Mex
ican treachery and cowardice EDITOR."

Our town was visited on Saturday at two o.
clock, p. m. by most terrific tornado, which
has laid our village in ruin almost complete.
The scene beggars all attempt at description.
Men, women and children were hurled, pel-mell,
with their dwellings, with appalling screams,
mingled with prayers, all in momentary expecta-
tion of death which seemed inevitable. The
storm lasted twelve minutes, and then subsided
into a general calm. The scene which followed
was heart-rending. Young and old men and
women and children crawled forth from ruined
dwellings on every hand, calling in agoniZing
tones for the restoration to them of dear ones
believed to be lost. Mothers wailng for their
children, fathers running wildly bther and thi-
ther frantic with grief-some nearly denuded of
clotbing-the garments Of all drenched with rain,
and many one marked with blood. Some found
kindred mangcd and dead, others recovered
friends with arms and legs broken, or bruised
and helpless. Thirty three dwellings were de-
stroyed, and as many families rendered homeless

that has not suffered more or less damage

Events have transpired in such rapid sue
cession during the week, that we have not
found time to refer to the imposition practis-
ed upou the county, and in opposition TO the
interests of Oroville, particularly, in the
matter Of road surveys between this point
and Jack's Ranch These surveys were
made under the direction of Judge Lewis at
the time the County seat question was in
agitation, and were designed to convince the
voting public of Butte county that Bidwcll
was the only accessible point in the county,
and that it was impossible to make a road to
any other place We have letter from
Judge Lewis, written at Sacramento, during
TIE session of 1886, while lie was at the
State Capitol, lobbying a bill through the
Legislature authorizing our Board Of Su-
pervisors to pay him fifty thousand dollars
for his Bridge, urging these surveys and
pointing out the manner in which the routes
should be run. We may conclude to pub
lish it at some future time.


The road to the junction as surveyed un-
der the above mentioned direction, runs
south from Orovlle to Lynchburg, thence
east to the Miners Ranch, and from thence
in a northwcsterly direction to the Junction.
This survey was introduced before the Board
of Supervisors, as evidence to show that
it was higher to Jacks Ranch, via Bdwell,
than by the Junction, to defeat the arpica
tion for a ferry at the latter place. 1t was
defeated, but whether it was done by the
powerful influence of the rams horn route,
or by the insutflciency Of testimony on the
part of the application, we know not. We
do not suppose the Board of Supervisors
were bought, because we know that one of
them respectfully declined Judge Lewis
offer to furnish him with money to make the
canvass


We have felt deep interest in this mat
ter. for the reason that road to the June
ton would permit the immense trade of
Plumas to pass through Orovile. If we
continue to send that travel and trade
around by the Miners Ranch, we ca2not
expect them to ship their goods here, for
that point is within twenty-four miles of
Marysville, and with the means at the
command of that city, they ean always Sc
cure this vast trade, whatever our facilities
for transportation may be. We desire tina;
this trade may pass through Oroville, and il
they coul d find it to their advantage to ship
their goods to this point or to make their
purchases here, it would add materially to
our commercial Importance. If not they cod
pass to any point below by more direct
and better route than that now travelled.
These are the motives that have actuatcd US,
and we are still strong in the faith that the
ferry will be established, and that we shall
yet have the privilege of seeing the wagons
and pack trains of Pumas loading in our
streets. The course now pursued by our
county authorities upon this question, is
wrong, and will meet with speedy CON
demnation Their sacrifice of the public
interest to that of individuals, places the in
habitants Of the valley portion Of the county
in the position Of Russian serts, instead OF
that of American citizens.

visited Frankfort upon private business 10 no way

II was soon bruite that they were Ito use the ee-

fessiop, thought it prudent to comply, and, with
stomach. full of Southern hospitality, departed.


The people of Frankfort have thus set notable
example to their brethren throughout the Southern
States and we suppose that it will be SO improved

the 9th inst, number of young men played off some
extraordinary and highly censuable tricks upon the
congregation of the Methodist Church in Lynchburg
Va. The Courier gives the following account of the
affair:


Itappears that on Sunday night last sacregious
wretch managed to obtain to the gasmeter and
let off all the water The consequence was that the
gas soon went out, leaving the church in total dark
ness. Then it was that the same wretch, together
with his accompces, scattered many pounds of finely
powdered pepper on the floor, benches, ratings
and elsewhere. The house was densely crowded, and
after theg gas lighted again. and while the preacher
was was in the midst OF stirring appeal to the
sciences Of his hearers, the ladies commenced to ply
their fans and the persons standing in the aisle to
move about to get little fresh air. This reused up
the powdered pepper and started the whole congrega
ton to coughing and sneeZng at rate so terrible as
to put speedy stop to the services. Unable to en-.
dure their suerings, many of the congregation rose
up and made for the doors. The doors could not be
| opened There were wretches outside holding them
with ropes? How long this state OF things lasted we
were not told What the consequences must have
been we leave to be imagined,"

amined yesterday before Justice Elliot.
District Attorney Kleine appeared on be-
half of the State. and Messrs Granger and
Rhodes for the defendant


The evidence on the part of the prosecu
tion was OF a very similar nature to that
eicited before the coroner's Jury


Dr. McGuire was called to the stand and
stated the cause of Thornton's death to be
pistol shot wound which originated ON the
right side, about four inches below the stom-
ach, and went through to the skin on the
other side. The Doctor exhibited the ball.
1t was about the size Of q common revolver
ball or buck shot


Witnesses differed as to the number of
tumblers thrown by Thornton, some saying
that one, and others that two were thrown
before the firing of the pistol. MIR. Delany.
and Mr.. Maher stated as their impressions,
that three tumblers were thrown The lat
ter witness states that after the first shot,
Thornton retreated behind brick pillar
which stands in the room, and that Liner
ick then advanced and fred the second
shot


Thomas Lynch, o2e of the bar keepers at
the Bank Exchange swore that he saw
Thornton throw the first tumbler, saw it
strike near Limerick's head He stated that
three tumblers were thrown, the last Of
which struck Lmericks head


Mr. Ritchey saw Thornton grab the crib
bage board, but did not see any tumblers
thrown; said he thought Thornton tried to
dodge behind him while Limerick was shoot
inr Didn't know whether the tumbler
was thrown, or the pistol shot first.


After the arguments Of Counsel. Lloyd
was committe to answer charge Of mur-
der in the first degree."

FRIDAY MORNING. NOV. 18TH. 1857.",,"LYNcHISG CHINAMEN The Cinnamon in
the vicinity Of Campo Seco. says the Gala
veras Chronicle, have been committing de.
predations upon the sluices almost every
week for the last six weeks, but were finally
caught on Saturday, 3lst October, by some
miners on French Hill, who had suffered by
them on a former occasion, and we're ther
watching for them. Having secured the
two thieves, they brought them up en- the
bank, stripped them, and administered fifty
lashes on the bare back of each, and then
cut their tails off. However, it appears
there are some honest men among the Chi
nese in this country. The same Journal
says that the Johns caught one of their
countrymen stealing the other day, where
upon they took and tied him up to a tree
aud gave him regular good licking 1t
was done, the Chronicle adds, as well as
Judge Lynch could have done it."

ing of existing parties, draws the following
contrast: ""There is just the contrast between
the democratic party and the party by which
it is opposed, that there is between an army
of United States regulars and band of Mex
lean guerias. The one is permanent or
ganization founded on principle and necessity
with one common flag and uniform, of which
they are ever proud, and the coIors of which
they never change without experiencing an
instructive sense of shame and disgrace.
When summoned to battle in the cause of
their country, its legions are formed in mas
sive columns upon the open plain, and they
march to battle with flags flying and drums
beating to conquer or die. The guerilla is a
different animal. His mode of warfare is
fixed by no principle-hs flag, he has none,
except now and then, when he assumes a
false one, with which to deceive and decoy
his adversary-his uniform is changed to suit
the change Of circumstances-he conceals
himself in the chapparal instead of meeting
his adversary in the open feld--he fights for
plunder and the spois, instead of for God
and liberty-and when fairly driven from his
hiding place, instead of honorably capitula-
ting, he skulks to the rear of the army, and
when opportunity offers, falls upon the bag
gage wagons and plumbers them of their
contentsn"

1t must be evident to everyone familiar with {
the termination OF eases in litigation, that sue
cess. nowadays, is more the crowning-work OF {
srtifice, cunning and trickery, than OF stern and
deserved Justice. Read the proceedings either
criminal or civil, as they are published from the
record of the courts, and it viii be found that
the question of JUSTICE is almost nullity that
instead of being the pivot on which the whole
fabric should be equiposed. 1t scarcely shares
nominal part in the matter. Cases are now
mostly carried by the cunning of lawyers, IN
stead of by just and rigid weighing and silt
inc of evidence pro aud con. For instance, a
suit is brought to court, attorneys are engaged
an indictment is found and read, and here fre-
auently the whole matter is arrested, from some |
infor.naity.-- .--an or, or an i, has been lett out,
or an / has not been dotted or a crossed |
Then again, by the questions crossed and re-
crossed an hundred times, until the lawyers
themselves could not tell what was asked, TO save
them from the gallows, timid witness Is pro-
nounced Incompetent because his testimony
conflicts in detail! Why is not justice oftener
found! Is it because the law is not right, or
that we have not enough of 1t We think not.
The true cause may undoubtedly be found IN
the lawyers, ,whoare as so many avenues through
and by which rogues may escape justice. All
know instances OF their success even In releas-
ing m Barabbas' - from merlted punishment,
when he is known by the counsel to be guilty,
considered as a dangerous man throughout the


Oh fhaf full
penalty of the law. Why do we hear so much
complaint in late years about Lynch Law"" ii
it is not from the cause we have just named
When law is by artlice made protection to
felons, what other resource is left all outraged
community! We are no apo!ogist tor such pro-
ceedings-they are to be deprecated; but IN
stances may occur, such as the one IN Cali.or-
mia the past year, when public and private In-
terests demand it.


Law, courts and juries are necessary, but we
believe that, in niue cases out of ten, true and
more proper verdict would be rendered by a
Jury of twelve men, after hearing a plain
straight forward evidence from the witnesses
and charge of the Chief Justice, than if they
were to hear the pleadings Ofall the lawyers II
Christendom. There were ten times the chance
ofa lust decision before self-constituted cour
in the Back. woods, or the Gold-diggin's, thar
in our courts, where everything is mystifieC
and doubly confounded By our learned ""attor

Walker, late of Mississippi, ex-Secretary of
the Treasury, ex-senator and now called
Governor Of Kanzas. Some steps ought to
be taken to stop the frightful mortality
which prevails among the Governors of
Kanzas. Four of them IN the space of
three years have found for themselves
graves 50 deep that the resurrection trump

At Big Springs while the Free State men
were voting they were startled by the ap
pearance of the q. s. Dragons, who were
on their march to Fort Riley. Many sup
posed it to be a detachment sent TO close
their polls, so the ssBallot Guards"" as the
newly organized companies are called, were
formed around the polling place, and the
citizens proceeded regularly but speedily to
cast their votes. By the time the Dragons
arrivedsevery ballot had been deposited and
was ready to be counted. 1t was soon found
that they were only on the march to the
Fort.


The Troops with Gov. Walker passed
through Topeka, and on Tuesday evening
the citizens of that town were amused and


surprised by their disappearance and camp


ing near. The army had reached Silver


Lake when they were met by a messenger


with dispatches, stating that the alarm at


Fort Riley was groundless, and ordering


retreat. As the citizens of Topeka were


just completing their municipal organiza-
ton, the immortal Pacifcator could not lei


such an opportunity of gaining new laurels


pass by quietly.


The returns from the State Election so
far as heard from give indications of large
vote having been cast. In Lawrence two
votes were cast against the Constitution,


while 652 were given for it. VIM. A. Phil
| lips and J. B. Abbott were elected Senators,
and Robt. Morrow, G. w. Deitzler, VIM.


Hutchinson, G. Fl. Crocker, E. P. Vaughan,


T. Prentice and G. F. Warren Representa-


tives from this District The entire vote


of Topeka was given in favor of the Con-


stitution- Walter Oakley was elected Sena-
/ tor.


/ We have at last seen a copy of the Law


regulating the Territorial Election of Octo-
| Der next, and find it to be substantially as


we have before stated. The principal sec


tons are those which give the power to


make the apportionment and define the quail
i ifications of voters. The latter requires a
I six months residence previous to the day OF


election, and, in contrayention to the Or


ganic Act, allows none but citizens of the
United States to vote, thus cutting off a
large mass of Free State foreigners, who
under that act would be entitled to vote. Il


leaves the power of deciding what consti-
tutes 4 residence, entirely in the hands Of


the judges, who it viii be remembered, are
according to the provisions of their first
election law, appointed by the County

provision is virtually saying that none bu1
those who are on the Bogus Register shall
vote. The law makes no provision for elec'
tons in Counties without an organization,
and any election held therein will be Illegal


Judged by their standard of legality. Every

similar districts, easily accessible to the
Missourians who can legally be voters, by
reason of their being on the Register o.

Pro-slavery judges, appointed by Pro-Sla.

clause, and an apportionment which virtu'


ally disfranchises twenty counties south O

The people of Leavenworth are in a
great state of excitement, resulting from
the discovery in their midst of an organ
lied gang of murderers and robbers. Two
men were murdered-some persons were
accused of and confessed their completely,
revealing at the same time the existence of
a gang of the same description. On Mon
day two men were hung by the people.
under the ruling of Judge Lynch, and ru-
mors are afioat that three more have been
served in the same manner. Here is a work
for Gov. Walker, for Leavenworth takes
the law into her own hands, setting aside
the City Government and treating the inter-
ference of Leeompte with Eidicule.


The Land sales are still progressing at
Osawkee. Gen. Lane and III. j. Parrot had
n public discussion on Kanzas matters with
Harlequin Perrin and some other person.
A most barefaced piece of yillainy and
fraud is now being praeticed at the above
place. The Commissioner, DIR. Eddy, has
formed Squatter Court of Appeal /; ap-
pointed E. O. Perrin, and Stevens, the Free
Speech of Paoli notoriety, as judges.
Every disputed case has to be brought be-
fore these Immaculate Judges, and a fee of
SO each is exaeted for their services.
This has TO be paid whether the squatters
are willing or not, for the Commissioners
will not let them have their laad until he
feels assured of its being done. None but
the regular Border Rufian lawyers can get
a chance before this court of iftsqtity, and
large fees are paid to retain these fayorites.
Is this not shameful ?


There Is no more news of interest STIR
ring, and unless Gov. Walker marches back
again TO Lawrence, or invests Topeka. as
the present movement indicates, we are"

 SLIDING DOWN THE HILL.-In the forma- ton of Lynchbur-, mother nature had an eve to the comforts of boys. She male number of hills, and one in particular, which for sliding purposes, beats the world This bill descends by grade something short Of the absolutely perpsudIcular, and when it is covered with snow, 1t Is good deal easier to go down this hill upon sled than it Is to fall in love, or run in debt; or if we are to believe the ftcths do- census theory of the ancients, to go to Guinea.

 The slider commences somewhere about the reservoir, going at first very slowly, like the evlldoer, when he begins to stray from the paths of virtue; the speed quickly becomes ac- celerated; little below Dr. Pains it grows very rapid; at the Episcopal Church it is terrific; and after that 1t Is like streak of greased fight ming through an apple orchard. In fact a Lynchburg boy, with moderate sled, can beat your ordinary tame lightning and give it two in the deal.

 Nothing can be finer than to look at this hill of an afternoon, when it Is crowded like an ant hill, with boys, ascending and descending, like the angels upon Jacobs ladder; and not only boys, but great big men, grave professional men, lots oi them, tearing down towards Black Wa ter Creek faster than parcel of bed bugs with a chdmbermald and kettle of boiling water behlnd them. The side walks are crowded with lookers-on, many of whom are young Ia- dies Everybody is excited. Here they come look out look out One sled darts by like an arrow-then another, and another-two more -three more-four-half a dozen-a dozen score--alI going like mad The rush is awful. IL almost equals he rush ot know nothings for a warehouse inspectorship. Goodness, how they fly! The ladies fairly dance with delight; the boys hurrah; everybody stretches d neck out to see the last of them as, enveloped in snow w-dust they shoot past Main street, down to flares factory, cieau out of sight.

 Now they came back, slowly dragging their sleis behind them. Once more they start; and here they come. d perfect shoa of them, faster than ever Hoo wee don't they go i, Beau tiful, beautiful, glorious, glorious

 Hello hello! whats that? Somebody is tossed high in the air as if from the horn of a mad bull; the sled is keel upwards, the rider on his back, kicking his heels at the sky as if he thought some of the planetary bodies were boot-i jacks. He is in the middle of the track, and every body runs into him, everybody is up- set and every body is kicking more heels in the air. It ridiculous spectacle, and resembles a strange sort of black wheel--all hubs and pokes--revolving six ways for Sunday.

 Then rises a roar of laughter that rends the very hcavens--glorious, full-lunged, open mouthed, loud and prolonged laughter-that does soul and body real good. Boys laugh, men tough, and the ladies (God bless their larynxes,) laugh such healthy human music that the walls of the houses take up the sweet vibration and give it back again ill hearty, ringing echoes, as if they were women too. No pretty paror gigsle, this: no smothered gas- light chuckle, no Brussels carpet cachination, but genuine broad-shouldered, deep-chested laugh that scars up from the depths of sound pulmonary abysses, like the full notes of an organ when the loud pedal is pressed and the biggest sort of negro is pumping himself to death at the bellows.

 To hear Lynchburg girl laugh at Lynch burg accident upon Lynchburg hill, is worth a trip from London or Grim Tartary. It is as natural, as jolly, as beautiful, and almost as good ay horsolaugh,"

The sliding commences with re. newed gusto; there are more upsettings; more glorious roaring laughter until it gets too dark to see. Sliding in Lynchburg is real fun, it is."

Wells, Fargo & Co.'s box was then bro
ken open with hammer, and from it they
took about s27 900, leaving $1,000 scat
tered on the ground, and leaving the box
OF the Pacific Express Co. unopened,
which contained about $4,000. They
carried their booty about two hundred
yards and buried it under the leaves. and
proceeded by devious ways to their rendez-
vous. When the driver was liberated he
proceeded with all speed to the next sta
ton at Forman's, and having aroused the
slumbering citizens, he took horse and
came back to the office here, and arousine
Judge Lake, the Agent of Wells, Fargo
& Co., it was but short time till citizens
and officers were all out with a will after
the robbers and treasure A messenger
was sent to Vallecito and Murphy's, and in
a short time those camps had their best
detective police, their merchants and Off
GERS at the scene of the robbery The
tracks of the robbers were found and meas
ured; they were on foot, consequently, they
were in the neighborhood- money was
heavy load, and it must be near, for it
could not be carried far by sthree men,
which was the number who attacked the
stage. Thus reasoning, the tracks were
followed over the soft ground, and so long
as they were deep and heavy made, they
knew the treasure was before them. But
when they became light, the party sepa-
rated, some to find the money, (for the rob-
bers had, part of the way, taken to the
creek and followed its watery coursc) and
others to trail them over the hills and
through the woods till they were lodged in
cabin near the g forks of the road""
where most naturally, the self-same boots
were found as made some of the tracks,
and the man David Waldin who had them
on, was arrested Being taken out and
promised and threatened by officers Shroe-
bel and Robedee, he finally made clean
breast Of it, and told the names of the
other two, and started to 90 and show
where the money was buried. But before
he got there, it was found by the other
party hunting for it.


Upon his information the officers pro-
ceeded to arrest a most base and desperate
character who has been hanging round this
Camp for several months, known as Big
Brown. They also arrested another noted
parsonage by the name of Harry Browning,
for whom it has been predicted for years
by those who have known him, that he
never would die natural DEATH The
citizens arrested man whose name have
not learned correctly-but think it was
Langly-with whose hammer the box was
broken open. He was mining near the
place and the robbers had got the hammer
from his sluices. But when the constables
saw him they detained him for the COM
mission of robbery in Campo Seco and
in Jenny Lind.


The officers from all parts of the county,
were present in an incredible short time, and

committee, led away by evil companions and
the counses of men who should have set q bet

Of two horse thieves, one named Kelso was
hanging in the balance The lynchers took a
vote on the subject and when the fatal hat
came round Finch dropped into it His ballot,
inscribed with the word Death"" On counting
the ballots, a majority we're found to have de-
clared that the cuprits should die, and Kelso
and his comrade were accordingly hung to n
neighboring tree. Young Finch, after witness
ing their dying struggles went home, when his
mother anxously asked him if the thieves had
been caught ""Yes,"" he told her, ""and hung,
and he had voted to hang them"" His mother
sadly aud solemnly told him he had no right
unlawfully to take that which he could not give
the life of fellow being-and continued a
few moments speaking of the enormity of the
act. He then left her, and went out to plough,
but after ploughing few furrows he tied his
horse, took off one of the reins, and with it hung
himself to the lower limb Of tree When found
his knees almost touched the ground, and he
evidently could have arisen to his feet at plea.
sure had he changed his purpose before insen-
sibility supervened. All attempts to restore
the unhappy youth to life proved useless. The
affair produced considerable feeling among the
members Of the vigilance committee."

to see Camel, and requested him (Camcl) to take
back certain things which he had said. Upon his
refusal, Donnelly left the place where Camel was
working, but returncd, and shot Camel with a
large sized dragoon pistol.


Apprehending that the miners would lynch him
at Orleans Bar, prompted Sheriff Holt to bring
him to this county


Sheriff Holt says the first symptoms of insanity
he noticed in Donnelly. was after he got to Big
Flat; he commenced talking, and betrayng some
dcrangement of the mind. On Sunday evening
the Sheriff had Donncly secured in the county
Jail, where he remained until Thursday morning
when it was asccrtained, by the examination Of
physicisns, that Donnelly was insane. A certf
cate Of the fact was signed by the County Judge
and Donnelly taken to the Insane Asylum, al
Stockton, by Sheriff Holt. This is very strange
matter, take it all through."

From the Louisville Coulier Dec oa,b",,"-----$ss>e<s<---

 From the Louisville Courier Dec 9th A Whole Family Murdered by Negroes.

 In the Courier of Monday we briefly alluded to the probable murder of a family of Joyce in this county, and the destruction of their property by fire. We are now in full possession of the facts of the horrible affair so far as ascertaned from one of the relatives of the murdered family Tn this city The house was the property of Wm. Joyce, young man, who was fortunately away from home on the night of the murder to attend a wedding. He had however, left a brother, Richard Joycc, aged 19, at the house to take care of his property and the family during his absence.

 The house was what is denominated double log house, consisting of two rooms, divided by an open passage. The house is situated on the borders of Jefferson and Bulltt counties. on Brlar creek, the dividing line of the counties. about fifteen miles from tue city, and not near Salt river, as was stated. The inmates of the house were Mrs. Lydia Joyce. her son Richard Joyce young man of 19, Mrs. Welsh, her daughter widow, and the latterS little daugh- ter, child of three years. The oldest son, Wm. Joyce, the owner of the house, as before stated away from home. The house was burnt to the ground last Thursday night, and the next morning an investigation led to the horrible belief that the entire household had been murdered The charred remains of the two women were found near the fire place, while those of the young men were lying in the place supposed to have been occupied by the bed.

 MT. Wm. Joyce returned to his home to find 1t mass of smou:dering ruins, and with the assistance of the neighbors, instituted vgor- ous investigation of the premises, and the cause ot the disaster. Suspicion at once fastened upon several ot the negroes in the vicinity, and on searching the premises of Mir. Pendleton, a watch coat, pants, and other things, the pro- perty of Wm. Joyce, were found secreted un- der the house. Bill, slave of Pendletou, was then arrested, and confessed that he and three others murdered the family, plundered and then tred the house. At this revelation the greatest excitement prevailed, and lynch law was about to be enforced at once, but calmer Judgment overrued the action of the more has "", and the three other negroes Implicated were caught and tied to stakes to make them con- fess their participation in the bloody deed.- They were Jack and George, slaves of Hiram and Lewis Samuels, and boy of Samuel Browns, resident of Jefferson county, and the nearest neighbor of the Joyce family.- The others are residents of Bulitt county.- The slave of Mr. Brown was arrested late in the evening. They all deny the murder, though suspicion, aside from the confession of Blll, Is very strong against them. An exami- nation of the negroes was about to be instituted by local magistrates, but the feelings of the community were so highly excited that it was deferred, and we learned that strong force was bringing them here to be lodged in iail.

 Ernp ba ,,f. PendIeton, 1t appears that the negroes hearing that Wm. Joyce was absent from home, had determined to rob the house, under the belief that he had large sum of money. They went to the house about midnight, broke open the door and encountered Richard Joyce. the broth er of William. He was brained with a club in the presence of his mother and sister. The aged mother seized d pair of tongs to. rush to the defense of her son, but on the instant was attacked by the negroes, one of whom knocked Ter senseless with club. The daughter, Mrs. Welch, attempted to escape out of a window. but was caught by the feet dragged back and and then beaten to death. The infuriated ruff fans then sacked the house, took the little girl ot Mrs. Welch, threw it upon the bed set fire to It and fled, the child being actually burnt alive. The house aud contents were destroyed and the murderero thought their horrible crimes would not be revealed, but the discovery of a portion ot the property and the confession of one of their number has brought the awful cnme to light, and terrible will be the punish. meht. The people are aroused and vengeance dire Will be visited on the heads of the mis- gn1ded watches. The strong arm of the law should deal with the guilty, and it Is to be hosed that it will prevail

 Wm. Joyce Is well known in this city as a thrifty husbandmau, who regularly sent the product of hls farm 10 this city for marke and had amassed about one thousand dollars n cash. His mother, and Mrs Welch, her daughter, were auch esteemed by all who Knew them, and leave many sorrowing friends to mourn their untmely end.

 Nlnce writing the above, we learn that the people of the ncghborhool assembled and avowed determination to hang the murderers on the spot. They were then in custody of a Iarty ot the friends of MT. Joyce, who started with them to this city. On the TO d they were met by deputation of citzens of Jefferson county who, together with several from this city. hhally persuaded them to bring them here and let the law have it's course This was finally acceded to, and they were lodged in the Jal yesterday afternoon. A hand axe dyed with blood was found in the possession of one of the negroes.

 From the subsequent revelation it appears that the negroes contemplated saving the life ot the child, but fear of discovery induced them to sacrifice the little innocent. and it was ruthlessly cast into the flames.

 It appears that one at least of this party is very desperate fellow, having attacked the keeper of atradins boat at the river some time last spring. He went to the boat, and under the pretense of buying some trihing article made an attack upon the man, and knocked hlm down, but was prevented from doing furth- CT misch ef by the wife of the man, who came to his relief with gun."

This was repeated three or four times, when not
receiving any confession from him, they took

homicide, which in any country but Cal
ifornia would be called murder, occurred
at Grass Valley, on Saturday evening
last. w. Alexander McClanahan, who
has resided in that town some seven
years. occupied mostly as miner, but
for the past two years we'll known as a
Foreign Miners Tax Collector, was shot
by one Frank Moore, man of doubtful,
or rather of bad reputation, under the
following circumstances Moore, ac-
companied by several of his friends,
went into Heywood's store, about l / p
NJ, where McClanahan happened to be.
Moore, addressing the latter, says. (at
the same time drawing pistol You
have insulted me, by refusing to drink
with me- If you are a gentleman, you
will defend yourself"" On being remon-
strated with by Judge Haywood, Moore
put up his pistol, notwithstanding the
advice of one of his friends to shoot
McClanaban, on the spot. The latter
then left, saying to Moore that be would
see him again. In ten or fifteen min
utes he returned with pistol in his
hand and on his advancing towards
Moore, the latter fired, his ball passing
through McClannahan's arm, into the
ola hrooc+ thro,,rh +Io l,,,,or, III 70
the heart McClannahans pistol was
discharged almost simultaneously with
Moore's, the ball lodging in box. three
or four inches above the floor He then
walked few feet, and saying, al am a
dead man."" expired in minute or two.
Moore exclaiued that he was shot, and
went directly to DR.. Tomkins, who on,
examination found not shot wound.
but cut in one ofhis shoulders. Moore
was then arrested and placed under
guard, in DIR. Tomkins house.


A Coroner's inquest was held by JUS.
tice Hum ston, on Sunday, and the Jury
returned that McClannahan came to his
death by pistol shot, discharged at him
by Moore, with intent to take his life
a warrant was also issued against Moore
by Justice Humiston; but by advice of
the physician, the examination was
postponed, on account of Moore's wound.


The general opinion among the citi-
zens is that the killing was preconcocted
by Moore, who had fortified himself by
drinking freely on the evening of the oc
currence. Ill feeling had existed be-
tween the parties for some time. 1t is
generally believed that Moore's CUT
which was slight one, but for subse-
quent exposure, was inflicted in a drum
ken carouse, before he went into Hey
woods saloon. A good deal of excite
ment prevailed at Grass Valley, and
there was some talk of lynching Moore,
but while a great number of the citizens
would have sympathised with such
course, there were not enough ready to
take the lead in it.


McClannahan was an amiable young
man, about twenty-seven years old, and

 According to general report, there was kind of special Assizes Court held night before last below the city, near the site of old Fort Rosalie, and beneath the early light of the waning moon. It was one of those courts over which neither our high court or circuit judges preside, but which are called into being occasionally by the necessities of the case.

 It seems that quite number of val uabIe negroes have been stolen or run off from this neighborhood within a few weeks back. The absenting slaves are generally believed to have been en- ticed away by white men, un;a,cc:c the pretence of a safe conduct to a north ern cline, but who, after getting pos session of the negroes, have heartless- ly sold them. One or TWO slaves thus decoyed away, have been recovered, while others are still absent.

 It is generally reported that man by the name of Foster, or who gave himself that name, and who had been implicated in this wholesale business of negro stealing, was taken some where below Fort Rosalie, night be- fore last, and had administered to him most royal cow-hide fagellatiOn, we'll laid on, after which a skiff was rendered him with free permission to travel to some other vicinity where ne- gro stealing was differently punished. Under the effect of his punishment, it is understood that he made full con- fession, duplicating some other per sons in this vicinity. We presume the latter will find Natchez an undesirable place of residence.

 Public feeling is somewhat excited with regard to this matter, and with no small degree of justification. About three weeks since, quite large num- Der of negroes made their escape from neighboring county, and upon ex- animation 1t was found that book and pamphlet pedlar had been about and that amid his multifarious pursuits had been that of distributing tracts within the paper cover of which was g pocket and in that pocket, printed slip addressed to negroes, of a most infamatory and wicked nature. It is hardly to be wondered at, that wher cases of tampering with slaves become frequent, society rises superior to its own laws, and frees itself of those pests which it would be unable to cast off, did it wait for or depend entirely on the laws delay."

excited to which and which are not redeeming

have compiled the following list which, we believe in

Stanley Ryland, of the steamer Emma from the Missouri river yesterday, has kindly furnished us with the particulars of late mur- der and robbery, and subsequent lynchirg, at Leavenworth City.

 The Emma arrived at Leavenworth at l o'clock, P. M, on Sunday last and found consid- erable excitement prevailing in town on account ot murder committed, and summary punish ment inflicted on the perpetrators The ac- count ot these transactions Is, in substance as follows:

 From what we learned and our information comes from good authority--an eye witness It appears that there has been a regularly or ganized band of rutfians, desperadoes and thieves--for some time, infesting the ctv and neighborhood. They have made profitable business of killing strangers, robbng them, and throwing their bodies into the river to avoid detection. Several strangers, known to have been possessed of money, have very mysteri- ousy disappeared lately, and no one was able to account for their absence

 On Friday last man named Stephens went from Kansas City to Leavenworth and present. ed check for one hundred and eight dollars at the bank, and received the money. He was seen to count his money by man named Quarles, who kept gambling house in Leav- enworth, and who entced Stephens to spring | near the town, under some pretence and where they were promptly met by some members of the gang. Stephens was immediately killed and his money taken from him. His body was then thrown into the river. From some uu- explained cause, Quarles gave the alarm that he and Stephens had both been robbed He stated, moreover, that the occurrence took place at the aforesaid spring, near town, and that Stephens had been killed

 Some citizens. suspectng that all was not right, took Quarles into custody and proceeded to the spring, where the murdered man was discovered. and also some of the gang, who were arrested on the spot

 One of the arrested parties, young man, quite youth, made full confession of the murder of Stephens and also exposed numer- ous achievements of the gang.

 | The crowd of citizens took Quarles and a man named Bayse, and kept them until they | had such evidence as they thought sufficient to convict them of being implicated in the numer- ous murders recently committed in the commu- nlty. After some deliberation and hearing a speech from Judge Lecompte, who endeavored l to qulet the excitement, the crowd, fearing in terterence from the troops at the Fort, took Quarles to a tree below town and hung him. Soon after Bayse shared the same fate On Sunday, as the boat passed down, the ringleaders of the gang man named Wood and another named Knight or Knghton--were in the hands of the citizens, and were to be hung ill the evening, Wood was making his will and Knight was writing a confesson-- Wood is supposed to possess a considerable amount of property-probably the proceeds of his diabolica deeds.

 ! The names of those who were implicated by the young man who confessed were unknown. Some twelve or thirteen citizens, however, were missing when searched for on Saturday. The citizens of Leavenworth appear to be determined to lynch every one found connected with this band. The entire community ap- prove of and sanction the course pursued in re- gard to the hanging of Quarles and Bayse.-- $. Louis Repnbiican.

 Later advices represent that Wood and knighton have been hung. It is a amentabe fact that wherever gamblers congrey gate murder and violence follow"

agreed to give him a Lynch trial. on
the charge Of being ""traitor TO the

The Marshal. and some of the prom.
inent citizens OF Lecompton, who had
heard of his arrest. used their influence
to prevent an outrage upon him. 1t
seems the Marshal feared to exercise
his authority in the case. and could
only try to persuods his posse to in
form him OF whatever sentence they
passed against him. before carrying it
into execution. A personal search
was made from head to foot, and even
his money counted, his papers taken
away, also his horse and revolver.


AS it happened. two pro-slayery
men who were ii izens of this place.
on their way to Lecompton. were stop
ped by the guard and taken into the
same camp. They were called upon
to testify in regard to the prisoner.
They testified that Mr. Miller, though
a strong Free State man, formerly
editor OF the Free State"" had pur-
sued a candid and honorable course,
that had gained for him the respect
even Of his political opponents. Upon
this he was acquitted. and his papers
returned to him. DR.. StringfellOw

and it may be proper to state, that a

A SLAVERY ExTESTIoSIsT SPEECH.


On Wednesday, the 18th, party OF
the MsrshalPs force a dozen or so OF
South Carolinians, arrested the hands
at Shimmon & Lanes Saw Mill, at Be-
nicia, a short distance from Lecomp-
ton. They, after swearing at them
awhile, threatened to hang them if they
ever found them with arms in their
hands, then released them. The leade:
of this guerrilla party was Major, and
something of a stump orator. Just af-
ter releasing their prisoners, he noun
ted saw-log and made speech. the
substance of which is this:-Kansas
belonged to the South, and she was
bound to have it if every pro-slavery
man lost his life in getting it. The ab-
olitionists had no business here-why
didn't they got Minnesota or Ne
braska. There Has llenty of land
there, and the South made no preten.
tions to own these Territories. They
sould leave Kansas. or by G-,erery
one ofthem would stretch hemp. Law
renee was an abolition town, and they
were going to tear it down. There
could not be one stone left on another

Bargar, the murderer, in Iowa, an incident
occurred which can hardly be credited in a
civilized community. Yet it was the Iegiti-
name effect Of that brutality which scenes cf
violence inevitably endanger in the human
breast, and an emulation of the spirit of
lawlessness and reckless disregard of the de.
cencies of lie shown by those citizens who
snatched the criminal from the hands OF
justice, and inundated him on the altar of
human passion. The body of Bargar, after
hanging for several hours upon t Q tree on
which he was executed was cut down; The
corpse was placed in rough box and nailed
up, and hole being dug in avacant lot, the
box was thrown into IL, the earth rudely
filled in. and the murderer's corpse left to
decay like that of brute, his only funeral
service the curses of an excited mob. Yet
this MAS not the end, for the next morning
earl some Of his quondam execuoners of
the lower order, themselves probably fit sub
jects for the State prison and the hangman,
opened the grave, took the body from the
box, and placing it in wagon with clothes
and hat on drove it to the door of Cobbs
Hotel, where the horrible thing remained
for brief time with eyes and tongue pro-
truding, and its agonizing and blackened
features making day hideous In the hand
Of this strange boon of their revels, the per
petrators of the CHASTITY joke placed slip of
paper on which was call for dinner and
horse feed, and then left the body to be re-
moved and again buried by those who chose
to take upon themselves the disagreeable
but necessary duty."

 apparently rendered all efforts of a like kind perfectly hopeless Indeed this meridian. at that period, was most uncongenial to relgious and moral enterprise. The country borderino on the Sabine has been occupied, rather than settled, by class of adventures almost as wild as the savages whom they had scarcely expel- led, and the beasts of prey which still disputed thelr domaln of the prmeva forests. Profes- slonal ambers, refugees from the iail, abscond- ed debtors, outlaws from every land, forgers of false com, thieves, robbers, murderers, inter- spersed among race of uneducated hunters and herdsmen, made up the strange social miscella- ny; without courts, or prlsonS or churches, or even the shadow of civil authority or subordi- hatlon--a sort ot unprnciped pandemonium, where the herce passions sat enthroned waving US bloody sceptre the naked bowie knife Let ho one accuse me oi exaggeration for the sake oi dramatic effect; l am speaking now of Shel oy county-that home of the Lvnchers- terrible locate where, ten years later, forty per sons were poisoned to death at marriage sup. per!

 It will be obvious that, in such community. very lew would be disposed to patronize camp meetings, and accordingly dozen different trials, at various times, had never collected a hundred hearers on one occasion. But even these were not permitted to worship in peace: uniformly, the first day or night, a band of armed desperadoes, headed by a notorious Watt Foeman chief judge and executioner of the Shelby Lynchers, broke into the altar and scat tered the mourners, or ascended the pulpit and treated the prea hers to gratuitous robe of tar and feathers. Hence all prudent evaneclists soon learned to shun the left bank of the Sa- oihe, as II It had been infested by cohort of demons; and two whole years elapsed without any new attempt to erect the cross in so peri lous field.

 At length, however, an advertisement ap- peared promising another effort in behalf of the gospel. The notice was unque-a perfect oack Wood'S curlosty-both as to its tenor and mode of publication. Let me give it verbatiua ct liter atim:

 BARBECUE CAMP MEETING.

 here will be a camp meeting. to con- mence on the last Monday of this month. at the Double Spring Grove, near Peter Brinson,s. Ill the county of Shelby.

 The exercises will open with a splendid borbecue. Preparations are being made to suit all tastes; there will be a good barbecue. better llquor and the best of gospel

 ""PAUL DENTON,

 September l. '36'

 This singular document was nailed to inc door of every public house and grocery: it was attached to the largest trees at the nter,ections ot all cross roads and principal trails: and even the wandering hunters themselves found it in remote delIs of the mountain, miles away from the smoke ot a human habtation.

 At hrst many regarded the matter as a hoax played oil by some wicked wag in ridicule of popular credullty. But this hypothesis was heSatlVei by the statements of Peter Brinson proprietor oi the ""Double Spring Grove;"" who ihio med all lhqWrers, ""that he had been em- II""yeo ana pali stranger, calling himself me'hoHlSt misslonarv, to provide an ample bar becue, at the period and place advertised.""

 "" The missionary said he would attend to that hmseIt,' replied Crimson.

 need hardly add that an intense excite ment resulted. The rumor took wing; flew on the wlnd; turned to stnrm-of exaggeration- every echo increased it's sound till nothing else could be heard but the Barbecue Camp Meet '5' """"ec""lle tile IocuS of thought, the staple ol dreams. And thus the unknown preacher had Insured ole thing in advance, congrega- uoh emOracIns the entire population of the country which was, 1t is likely, the sole pur- pose of his stratagem.

 l was travelling in that part of Texas of tho time, and my imagination being nflamed by the common curiosity, I took some trouble and attended. But although my eyes witnessed the extraordinary scene may well despair of the undertaking to pantit-thc pen of Homer, or the pencil of Ilogarth, were alone adequate to the subllmity and burleslue of the compli- cated task l may only sketch the angular outlines.

 space had been cleared away immediately around the magnificent Double Spring."" which boiled up with force sufficient to turn a mill ""heeI, Tn the very centre of the ever green grove. Here pulpit had been raised, and be- lore It was the lnseparable altar for mourners. beyond these at distance of fifty paces sue cesslon of plane tables extended in the form of great clrcIe, or the permeter of povgon, completely enclosing the area about the spring. An oderlerons steam, of most delicious savor, dlitused itself through the air; this was from the pits m the adjacent prairie, where the fifty slaves ot Peter Brinson were engaged in cook ing the promsci barbecue.

 he grove itself was literally alive, teeminn sWarmng running over with strange figures in human shape, men, women and children in every variety of outlandish costumes All Shelby county was there. The hunters had come, rifle in hand, and dogs barking at their heel,; the rogues, refugees, and gamblers with pistols in their belts, and big knives peepnc rom thelr shirt bosoms; while here and there might be seen a sprinkling of well dressed tHair rJ

 The tumult was deafening, tornado of bab- ling tongues, talking, shouting, quarrelling, betting and cursng for amusement Suddenly cry arose ""Colonel Watt Foeman. Hurrah for Colonel Watt Foenan,"" and the crowd part ed to the right and left, to let the lion lyncher pass.

As to the rest, he was tall. ath- letc, very powerful man. His train, dozen armed desperadocs, followed him.

 Foeman spoke in a voice, sharp and piercing. as the point of dagger. Eh, Crimson, where Is the new missionary: We want to give him plumed coat?

 He has not arrived yet"" replied the plan ter.

 Well, suppose we must wait for him; put the barbecue on the boards; I am as hungry as a starved wolfe""

 ""l cannot till the missionary comes; the bar becue is his property""

 fearful light blazed in Foeman's eyes as he took three steps towards Brinson, and fairly shouted

 Fetch the meat instantly or I'll fill your own stomach with dinner of lead and steel!,'

pendence.",,"! Among the signers of the declaration of
Independence were men engaged in almost
every prominent pursuit Of life. There were
twenty -four LAWYERS, fourteen farmers, OF
men whose only business avocaion was ag-
rcuture, nine merchants, four physicians,
one gospel minister, and three who were ed
ucated for that profession but chose other
fields of usefulness, and one u manufacturer.
large proportion of them lived to the age
of three score and ten years. Three OF them
were oyer ninety years of age when they
died; ten over eighty; eleven over seventy;
fourteen over sixty; eleven over fifty; and
six over forty-four. Mr.. Lynch, who was
lost in vessel on its way to the West In
dies, was only about thirty years of AGE.
The aggregate years Of life of the whole
band of patriots, was three thousand gix
hundred and eighty-seyen.


It is q fact worthy of record, that of the
fifty-six members of the continental Congress
of 1870, who signed the Declaration of In
dependence, and hereby took position of
great eminence in the sight of the nations
not one fell from his proud estate, either by
the effects of political apostacy or lukewarm-
ness, or by moral degradation. In public
and private life they remained pure; and in
that glorious constellation of which the
Patriot of Monticello is the chief luminary,
there is not single star whose light is dim,
or unworthy of the highest homage that
may be paid to man by the patriot and
Christian. The memory Of their achievement
accomplished with an eye single to the
general good, should make us, the inherit
ors of the resulting blessings, bow in reverent
alteration before the omnipotent spirit of the
Union, in which alone, AS in the group Of
celestial orbs, is strength and beauty. They
were band Of brothers, indeed; and the
family hearth, consecrated by their protec-
ton, which we have inherited, extended over
every broad acre of the Republic. Let us
see to it, that no disunion lines are traced
upon it; for


80! 'tis noble heritage this godly land of ours
1t boasts indeed, nor Gothic fame, nor ivy man


tied towers;


But far into these closing clouds its purple


mountains climb


The sculpture of Omnipotencc, the rugged Twins


of Time.


""OM surely high destiny, which we alone can


mar,


Is figured in the horoscope where shines our risen
star;


The monarchs all are looking on, in hope some
flaw to see,


Among the yet unbrollen links that guard our
liberty


''But we may disappont the hope of every des-
pot lord


And keep our Unions gordan knot unclcft by


Factions sword


And as, with those girt in of yore, new provin-
ces are twined,


Still let us with fresh bands Of love the sheat Of
Freedom bind!""

chase and settle on the land, taking with him that
which is recognised as property by the constitution
of the United States


In the latter case where territory was subse-
quently acquired by conquest or purchase, the argu
ment is if possible, still stronger against the distnc
ton set up by the freesolers. Territory acquired
by conquest is gained at the expense of the blood
and treasure of all the citizens of the United States
whether shareholders free-soilers it matters not
War ia the act of the whole people, and there is not
a man of them who is not, directly indirectly,
party If acquired by purchase, it is paid for out
''''NN'
every man who oats and drinks, and wears clothes,
contributes his full proportion. Setting aside all
laws and constitutions, and simply applying the
great principles of natural justice and equity to the
case we would ask if those who equal parties to
the attainment of good not entitled to equal
share of it's benefits This is universal law equal
ly recognised by the ignorant and the wise the
savage and the civilized man. 1t is OF those great
principles implanted in the heart of every rational
being without which he never would have become
anything more than an isolated savage utterly unfit
ted for acting in concert with his fellowmen in the
attainment of common object. community of
men--nay, two men--could not associate together
day without respecting the rights of each other.
This is the basis of the social compact; and without
it men would be compelled to become hermts to
avoid the necessity of exterminating each other.
The government of the United States is in the
habit of expendng millions ont of the common fund,
contributed by the whole people of the United
States in the purchase of territory from the Indians.
Yet the free-soiers say to nearly onehalf of those
who paid for this land ""You shall not share in its
benefits. You shall not go thero-at least you shall
not take your property with you (which equivalent
to prohibiton.) The ground is tabooed to you,
1t is to be kept sacred the elect, to the privileged
order, to those who governed by the higher law
and the scrupe of conscience; and, though expect
you to pay your full share of the reckoning, can
not in conscience allow you to partake of the FEAST
Would not-the people OF the South be perfectly JUS
tifiaDle in retorting these exc'usonists, 'Wel
if we cannot sit down at the feast, we will pay no
part of the reckoning"" and oppose appropriations
for the purchase of new territory?


The protection of property being next to that of
person, the most important object of all good gov
crnment, and property III slaves being recognised by
the constitution of the United States, well as orig
inally by all the old thirteen States, have
doubted that the emancipation of slaves in those
States where it previously existed, by an arbitrary
act of the legislature, gross violation of the
rights of property That slave property had become
less valuable in these States, that their emancipa-
ton was in accordance with the spirit of the age
and all that sort of can-is sufficient ground for
deprving one single man of his property without
due process of law due compensation. The
will of the majority is not supreme in the United
States, except within constitutional limits. No
ten men ten thousand men, whether private citi-
zens or Legislators, have right to deprive single
citizen of his property except be absolutely neces
sary to the defence Of his country to the attain
ment of some great public good--not mere specu-
lative abstraction, but visible, tangible benefit
which all feel and comprehend. Even in such cases
the rights of property far respected that ade
quate compensation is always allowed, In all other
cases citizen can only be divested of his property
'by due process of law""


| And what is this duo process of law? Is it amere
arbitrary dctum of legislative body is it trial,
| Judgment, and execution according to the pre-
scribed forms of law, where there two parties,
and both are heard before Judgment is given. 1t
certainly does not mean lynch law, mob law, nor
! the higher law, nor the law Garrisonian, nor
the Abby Foster Theodore Parker w l-Phps-
Ward-Beecher law. 1t means that law which is
aptly called the perfection of reason"" and deserved
that name until from blessing it perverted into
curse by the qnihhline of lawyers and tho reynss

The emancipation OF the slaves of the northern
States was then, as previously stated gross out

not voluntary accomplishment on the part of the
owners. 1t was an act Of coercve legislation. We
have distinct recollection of conversations with aged

 More Lynohing in Iowa-A Gang of Horse

 Thieves Broken Up-Hanging the Ring leader.

 For some years past tte farmers of Clinton. Cedar and part of Scott counties, have been greatly troubled by horse thieves. Some farm CTS have lost as many as six and eight horses

 and others three or four, and so on. Several

 recent thetts, and knowledge that regular | organized band of horse thieves existed in said reglon, who seemed to Jofy all law and all ef- l iofts to punish them, iulure1 the farmers of

 these counties to organize a committee or sccie-

 "" to break up this band. Such committee | Nas formed q short time since, aud in it are aohie ol 'he most substantial farmers in Clinton,

 Oeaar ana Linn counties. The following facts

 have beem given us bvarelabls informant. who

 Is acquainted with the names of good many oi the committee, and of certain persops whom the committee are in search of The facts We give are direct from mcnberof the committed i to our informant.

 l Some days ago the committee arrested two l men, and placing rope in the wagon started 1 for the timber. Ihis so frightened the pgisou-

 eFs that they made a full confession to savo their oWn lives. They told all about the or- G1nlzation and who were cnga-e1 in it. giving

 names, etc., in detail. With ths information

 the committee proceeded to the house of man named Page, living in the back part of Clinton

 county, to arrest horse thief who was SUD-.

 posed to be concealed there. When apIIoach-

 iu9 the house, they were fired uuou They re- turned the fire, and shot Pare in the hoH,e1s who has received fatal wound. He is rroh,. hly dea by this time. We presume the thiof was not arrested, as wo did not hear the facts

 mentioned. This happened about last Tues dav.

 Day before ycstorlay (rhursday) at half past one o'clock, the committee proceeded to

 arrest an old man named Benjamin Warren,

 who lives in the Warren settlement"" of Cedar

 county He had long been suspected of horse

 th.cying, but he hal been sharp enough to coy-

 CT up his thefts as they were committed, 50 that

 he bad escaped justice. The committee now,

 however, had the direct evidence.

 When some distaco from lis house, about

 forty horseman of the main gang loft their com panlonS and gailoped up to tho house, to tak o him hy surprise and prevent bis escape. He

 was secured and taken into tho woods, where

 the crowd were gathercd Here regular iury was impanenel, and a committee took charge oG the invcsti@l ltion. He passed through q 1 formal trial, in which number of witnesses were examined. He WIS asked f hc had any 1 sad ne had not. The question then arose. ! whether to lynch him or hang him, and wa.

 put to vote. About thirty were for lynching,

 and the balance, probth'y ncar three huaIrod, were for hanging. The decision was made known to him, anA he was asked if he had anv rremratJrs to make. Ue sail no oulv wanted time 10 make out his wi.l, ani ho had about thirty bcquosts to make to a5 many hors Tho committee dccjdeI that this would take too

For the Placer Herald",,"A MONSTER TooTH.-A friend informs us,
who has seen the curiosity, that last week,
while some miners were working on Haw s
Flat, several miles below Lynche's Ranch, on
Secret Ravine, they picked up from the bed
rock, eight feet below the surfece, monster
tooth, which certainly exceeds anything of
the kind we have yet heard of in California.
1t is a veritable tooth, and is seven inches
long, three wide, and eight high from the
end of the roots to the top 1t had four
roots; and the top was formed not unlike a
wheel with coos an inch and half high, so
formed that similar tooth above would fit
the ndentaions Of the other The tooth
seemed to have been set in the gum of the
Jaw five inches, according to the line below
the enamle, which had become as black as
charcoal. The question is, was the tooth of
a Mastadom. And if so-the animal must
have gone his heath on 'tooth and toe
nail:"" A monster with such glienders must
have chawed up trees-grass and chapparel
being but slender forage."

held on the 26th ult. by the citizens of Memphis,
under the excitement occasioned by the murder Of
John Everson by gambler named Able, came near
resulting in an execution under process Of Judge
Lynch. The Appeal says, that during the delibera-
tons resident of Mississippi arose and proclaimed
that if 100 men would follow him. Able should imme-
dately be taken out of jail AMI hung. The assem-
bage started to their feet with shouts and in spite Of
the efforts of few conservative men the hall was
soon emptied. The Appeal thus relates what fol-
lowed:


The crowd went into the jail forced open the doors
and took out John Able, the murderer Of John Ever
son. With chains upon his person he was hurried
two squares, to the end of the ropewalk where
it was proposed to hang him. Arrived there, the
crowd having him in charge, found his wife, mother
and sister, who made such pathetic appeals that by
nearly unanimous vote. it was resolved to take him
back to jail and let the law haveits course Able was
taken back and lodged in cell, and for few min
utes all seemed satisfied.


A cry arose, +"" hang him."" and soon crow.bar was
brought into requisiton and the outside door of the
jail forced. Several speeches were made, and finally
the crowd dispersed with the understanding that the
law would be permitted to have its course.


The rope was placed around Able's neck three
times, but he displayed no signs of fear. He ad
dressed the crowd, as did his mother Able said he
desired to settle up his accounts, and in a cool man
stated he had very nearly got through with his
arrangements, SO far as his property concerned"

yot day passes but we hear of more or

Our political disturbances have brought
bere from all sections of the Union, class
of desperadoes, who live without labor,
sustaining themselves by crime, and right
etive are they at their illicit operations.


We have stated this fact before, and
urged our people to take measures to
bing the offenders to justice. 'Name
them,"" has been the cry, as if it was the
pToyince of a journalist to become crimi-
nal informer. Crimes have increased to
such a rate that at last the people of Law
renee have become aroused. An organiza-
ton was effected few days ago, and, as a
result ten persons was arrested from
among our population charged with horse
stealing. Whether there is proof to sus-
tain the charge against any, or all of them,
is not for us to enquire; but we do repeat
most earnestly, that there must be horse
thieves in the country, or so many horses
would not be stolen. 1t is the promise OF
every good citizen to aid in ferreting them
out, and in bringing them to Justice
Though TO advocate of Lynch law, and al
ways deprecating it when it occures, YET
the popular impulse will sometimes give
way, and when such is the case its action
cannot always be restrained. 1t will sup.

longer, and allow horses to be unlawfully
removed, even out of Lawrence in bust

JUDGE LYNCH, Chief Justice


Judge Chastity Associates


Judge Purity, A''o''""""'


As usual, the Sheriff of Judge Lynch's Court
acted with astonishing promptitude and vigor,
and in twenty minutes from the issuing Of the
warrant, the guilty Mr.. C-l stood in the au-
gust presence Of the supreme terrestrial justice.
Having been regularly indicted, petty jury
was empanneled and the public prosecutor APP
pearng against him, the chief justice appointed
counsel for the defense, and the trial at once
began.


The Court Room-gents' eabin--was crowded,
and all eyes were fixed upon the physiognomy OF
the accused, while the aforesaid countenance
grew white and red by turns, as either fear or
shame took possession of its possessor.


Witnesses for the prosecution were examined
one after another and all testimony went straight
to show that the lady was put on board the MINI
nebaha, at Council Bluffs, by her own liege lord,
and that the prisoner came on board at the next
landing and took possession of her as his own
welded wife, and that as such they had roomed
together since. Parties from the Bluffs, who
knew the injured husband testified to the mar
riage with the frail lady passenger, which trans
pired only same two months since.


The case looked dark. There was no testmo-
nv in contradiction to the above The prose
cutting attorney looked triumphant. The jury
grew solemnly dignifed The Chief Justice and
his associates waxcd still sterner and looked still
more morosely grave. The counsel for the de-
tense took the prisoner to one side-a few mo-
mcnts conversation ensued and again they APP
peared in Court. The counsel and his unfortu
nate client seemed like men in desperate circum
stances. Hope and fear alternated on their eX-
pressive but diabolcally sedate countenances
AT length, however, the counsel rose and put in
the following document conclusive and sufi
cient evidence of the innocence and purity of
bis client. Amidst mingled Kisses and murmur
ings Of wrath, it was admitted evidence in
Court


SUPREME BENCH-SHOEMAKER'S COURT


CouNcIL BLUFFS CITY, Iowa, May I'd, 1857.


TO all to whom these presents may come
greeting:


Be it known that !, Simeon Shoemaker, JUS
tice of the Peace Of said city and State reposing
special confidence in the statement that an un-
pleasant row has existed for some time between
Job @ and his wife Betsy, do hereby dissolve
the bonds of matrimony heretofore existing be-
tween them very much to their mutual disgust.
And furthermore be it known that having been
duly elected to this position by the Mormon vote,
do, in harmony with the sublime polygamic doc
trines Of Saint Brigham Young, hereby seal and
deliver over the said Betsey to C, Esq, to
have, to use and to hold in any manner that to
him may seem good. Witness my hand and the
great seal of the Court hereuntO appended, on
this, the 2Gth day Of May, A. d. 1857.


SIMEON SHOEMAKER, j. F.,


exonicio marriage breaker and maker.


This record, from the authenticated docket of
ESQUIRE Shoemaker was introduced with appa-
rent confidence on the part of the defense ; and
the prisoner being put on the stand, testified in
substance the same thing, assuring the jury that
he was the lawful husband Of Mrs. Q-ley.
The Court however, ruled that Shoemaker had
no authority in law, and did not amount to much
as a man, and thai the prisoner an unmtiga-
ted liar. The Chief Justice then launched out
into q moral dissertation. distinguished alike for
its parity and beauty of thought, and its elegance
and chastity of expression.


The jury retired, and in just one hour and
twenty five minutes, returned with the following


VERDICT.


We the Jurors of this august Court, after
solemn and deliberate delberalion, and reflective
consideration in the momentous case submitted
to us do find


|. That Esquire Shocmaker's commission ex'
pirod on the lst April 1867.


q That Esquire Shoemaker had no authority
to grant divorce in the case of Q. vs. Q.


5. That the defendant c. is guilty in man
ucr and form, as he stands charged in the indict-
ment


We recommend that C. be put upon log and
sent down the river rolling, That Mrs. Q. be
locked up in her state room, and kept securely
until she arrives at the place of her destination,
when she shall he delivered over to her friends
and that sentence be executed forthwith


PETER JONES, Foreman.


While the Judge was preparing to pass sen.
tence upon the convicted and truly wretched
man, the steamer stopped at a woodyard-pris-
oner's counsel obtained private interview, and
advised culprit to agitate his pedal extremities
and disappear in the thick hazel brush and un-
derwood that skirted the shore. Prisoner sweat
ed in his great agony, and trembled with much
fear, was secretly assisted up the gangway plank
by his counsel--fourteen deck hands firing pis
tolls and yelling like devils incarnate, were soon
bowling on his track. Bnt darkness covered his
person and his shame with a robe of common
charity, and he escaped, never to return. Next
morning the sentence was completed, and the
disgraced female was delivered over to her
friends, who awaited her arrival at R."

utes.


Committee reported the following resolu-
az IL 1,>,zt zta1
Resolved, That we heartily endorse the
proceedings of the State Republican Con-
vention, recently held in Sacramento, and
we recognise In the candidates nominated to
fill the various State Offices, men of such in
telligence, ability and integrity Of charac
ter, as to inspire US with the greatest con-
fidence and hope, Regarding it as far the
ablest and bes ticket presented to the peo-
pie for their suffrages in California, and we
hereby pledge ourselves to use all honorable
means to secure their election


Resolved, That in view of the various can
didates presented by the Democratic and
Peoples parties of this county, we deem it
inexpedient to make nominations at the
present time, holding ourselves in readiness
to aid ia the election of such candidates as
we may find we can consistently support, be-
lieving it to be a duty we owe our county, to
assist in placing none but the best men in
Office adopting the Jeffersonian rule, Is
he honest? Is he faithful? Is he capable :""
and, Is he true to the great principles Of Re-
publicauism


Resolved, That n committee of fifteen be
appointed to present at some future time, if
in their discretion deemed expedicnt, the
names of suitable candidates for the re-
spectve Offices in this county, whom we rs
Republicans can consistently support.


Mr.. Cummings spoke on the first resou-
tion said he attended the State Convention
and endeavored to discharge his duty for the
best interests of the State. That the con-
vention was composed of the most intelligent
men from all portions of the State That
it was harmonious; no og.roling the Office
sought the man, and the best men through
out the State were selected that the nOm-
nee for Governor was chosen for his states
manlike qualities, morality and sobriety;
that man was Edward Stanly. (Applause)
Mr. G paid high compliment to the nom-
nee for Lieut. Governor, Mr.. Cheesman, of
Oroville. That the nominee for aSupreme
Judge, Mr. Bennett, was chosen TOR his emf
nent fitness for the position, and his election
may be considered certain. Mr. reviewed
the list of nominees, and endorsed them as
able and dignited men, with whom the best
interests of the State would be safe lie
did not think the ticket could be beaten, now
or at any time


Upon the adoption of the second resolu-
ton, declaring it inexpedient to mako nomi
nations at the present time, one man voted
no, a1d on being asked to explain his rea-
sons, stated that he liked to stand up to his
coors and believed it would contribute to
the success of the State ticket to have an in
dependent organization As the majority
appeared to be against him, he would not
insist upon making nominations.


Mr. Cummings spoke in favor Of the reso-
luton and argued that two tickets were in
the field from which men could be chosen to
fill the offices with honor and dignity; re
ferred to the fusion of the Republicans and
Peoples party in the State Of New York;
was down on the Peoples party here, be-
cause they did not appoint committee OF
conference, and the Democrats, because
they had proposed to cut off the heads Of
Republicans, but thought they could take
good men from both tickets and elect them
that the interests OF the county were superb
or to those of party; that very pretty
fight was getting up in the Democratic ranks
which might be Of advantage to the Repub- |
licans.


In accordance with the third resolution
committee of three was appointed to nomi- |
nate the committee on nominations. Messrs |
Cummings, Lincoln and Hurd were appoint
ed said committee.

During the week we made our usual jaunt,
prospecting for items. Every one appeared to
have plenty of water, and their claims yielding
well. In order to show our readers, at dis
tance, what San Andreas really is doing, in the
way of mining, We took down some of the
items, collected from the best authority A
miner, from the northern mines, who has been
prospecting the past three weeks near this Camp,
says from his experience he is firmly convinced
that nearly all the diggings in this vicinity will
pay three dollars per day to the hand, over all
expenses. But here is our notes:


The claim of Richardson Co.. Vague Camp,
yields ten dollars per day to the hand.


Lovett, Starring l. Co.'s claim, Vague Camp,
