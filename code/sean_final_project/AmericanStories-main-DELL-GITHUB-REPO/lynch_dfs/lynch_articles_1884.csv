acres of excellent land nicely situated and in high
state of cultivation Only 6S acres have been laid
off into building lots, any of which superb sites
for residences, as the ground is elevated slightly
above the central section of the city. description

through the centre of each square each way, which
gives rear entrance to every lot. All the lots on

| Guilty in a saloon, in what is known as Hap
py Hollow, in Jonesboro, a few nights ago.
There was a crowd of men in the saloon
| drinking and carousing, when one of the
party was found to have pistol. Deputy
| Sheriff Lamb and City Marshal Bryant un-
| dertook to arrest the man, who resisted
when general melee arose. During the
fuss several pistol shots were fred, but
| fortunately no one was hurt, and the party
was finally arrested and lodged in jail,
when the disturbance ceased, and quiet was
| restored.


A sensation was recently caused in
Little Rock by the arrest of Il. Alexander,
| Tor several years connected with f. G.
| Reeds pawnbroker establishment. Mr..
| Reed charges him with embezzling during
| the past few years about $4,000. Alexan-
| der was on the point of leaving for Menu
Dhis when arrested. He showed power
| of attorney from his mother, and says he
| was going there to settle business for his
mother, who is Reeds partner. The
| Young man stands well in the community.
Much Inconvenience has been felt by
| reason of tho irreguiarity of the mails
| since the high water commenced. What
| can not be cured must be endured, and our
| citizens will remember that Arkansas is
not the only State thatha suffered.
A Little Rock dispatch of tie 18th,
| speaking OF the fools, SAID: 1.-The Arkan-
| sas River here fell twelve inches to-day.
| The lrvec on the south bank of the river at
| Warner, twenty miles from here, broke yes
| tcrlay, washing ont the track of the Little
! Rex, Mississippi Il Texas Railroad. No
| trains will leave Little Rock for two days.
| The Gih5ons' lcvee, between Lewis City
| and Riverside and between White and
| Coche Rivers, broke, overlooking n large
| stretch of country and flooding the track of
| the Batcsville 81 Brinkley Road. Freight
| and passengers were transferred across the
| break by boats. Fears are entertained that
White River viii break the embanknent
| OF the Memphis Il Little Rock Road at
Devall's Bluff. All rolling stock has been
removed from the line between Madison
! and Hopefield.""


A Little Rock special of the Goth says:
| ''News WAS received to-day of the lynching
| of Thomas Wilson, colored, at point thir-
| ty miles north of this city. Wilson lived
| near the dwelling of a planter named Will
| liam Gritty, who was called to a neighbor-
ing town on business and remained over
night. About midnight the negro entered
| the house and assaulted Mrs. Gritty. She
| screamed for assistance and fought him
| with fire shovel, driving him from the
| room. He had not been gone long before
| he returned, this time more determined
| than ever. He had wrested the shovel from
her hand and had her completely in his
| power, when her screams were heard by
two men, who arrived in time to take the
negro in charge. He was delivered to a
| constable, who started with him to the Jail
| at Conway. \ swollen creek compelled
| him to sop on the way. About ten o'clock


that night n body of masked men took the
| negro from the officer and hung him to the
| lower limb OF a trec.''


Information is wanted of the where
| ahous of w. G. Blunton, from Missouri,
supposed to have died in Little Rock durS
| ing the month of January or February,
| 1863. He was Il colonel of regiment; af-
| tcrward ton account of reorganization


was captain of company a."" of Lieu

The Little Rock Conference of the


Methodist Church (colored) held re-
Gently in Little Rock, Bishop Wiley, of


Cincinnati, presiding. Quite a number of
| in. .cligpnt colored men, with few whites,


90 forth throughout the State to labor for


tie upbuldinG of the cause Of the Gospel.


The Bishop is exceedingly well pleased


with tie behavior of the preachers, and no


doubt viii carry back to Cincinnati good


reports of arkansas as shown forth by the


coored people.


The waters. at latest accounts from


the liver towns, were reccding and the


threatened danger disappearing.


A few weeks ago a colt. the property


of Mr.. Gibson Dyer, of Yell County, strayed


away and went to Frank Boyd'S, some eight


miles from its home. While there at


;achment sprang up between its coltship


and Il goat. The colt returned to its home,


the goat following it. The attachment be-


tween the two animals was great that


whenever any body approached the colt he


was summarily attacked by the goat, and


the colt would fl ght for dear life when the
| goat was moles ed.


Several days ago James L. Wilson,


one OF the largest planters on the river in


the vicinity OF Fulton, left home in skif


with two negroes to try and save his stock,


a.lG had not b en- heard from since. Relief
| parties have been hunting for them unsuc-
cessfully, and there is no doubt now that


the whole party were drowned.


A. Erbcr, general merchant, of Tex
arkana, has failed. A number of attach
, | ments were served by Sheriff B. F. Har-


gett of Bowie County. These claims


amounted to 5000. The other outstanding
Indebtedness will swell the liabilities to
about $4,000. The assets will be about


$1,000 or 5000. The Citizens Bank of Tex


arkana is the principal creditor.


Travel to Hot Springs is brisk.


II. l.. Wilson, a prominent planter of


Miller County, was drowned at Fulton, to-


While endeavoring to cross Red River at


that point, their boat capsized in mid


stream. Mr.. Wilson's and the body of one


of the negroes were found subsequently y


lodged against some drift about two miles


below Fulton.

concerning the epidemic in Wise, Dickinson

Guests River in Wise county, within a radius
OF four miles, there are thirty cases of the dis

The disease Is assuming mildcr form In some

The excitement IN Cincinnati over the
Bsruer case is growing. 1t is now reported
that an organization is being formed by the
Germans who will not only hang Berner but
other prisoners in Jail charged with murder.


Ten thousand persons gathered at Music
Hall in response to a call by the reputable
citizens, to take action on the Burver verdict.
Many could not get in. Strong resolutions
were adopted condemning the verdict, and
committee on the legislation was appointed.
Upon the adjournment the crowd moved di-
rectly TO the Jail, where they began an attack
on the front door. At $40 p. NJ. an alarm
sounded. summoning the entire police force
to the Jail. Crowds gathered in that vi
cinity. Berner was removed after receiving
his sentence this afternoon, and is now on
his way Columbus, but il the mob succeeds
in getting into the Jail, the other murderers
will be lynched. The police on arriving at
the Jail commanded the crowd to move on.
and not being obeyed, fred, but as no one
was hurt ii is presumed they fired in the air.
1t is said that was the intention of the police,
they being deeply in sympathy with the
movement to condemn the verdict. A shot
or two has been fired from the Jail, but the
crowd refuses TO move. They have a good
leader and are still 90 o'clock at work at
the Jail door.


At ii p. m. the report from the Jail is that
the crowd has got into the building. They
had previously broken into a blacksmith's
shop and taken all the tools they could find.
There is difficulty in getting information
about the movements, as the streets all
around the court house are jammed with peo-
pie. The associated press reporter saw

 ""How dare you be abusive on board this ship"" he said. ""Go ashore and don't let me see you again.""

 The astonished mate went ashore amid the contemptuous smiles of the ladies. In week he came skulking back. ""Halloo,"" said the Captain, ""where have you been all this time?""

 ""You-you told me not to come back"" said the poor fellow, trembling in his boots.

 The Captain looked at him pityingly. ""Well,"" he said, ''you are chunk. Go to work at once.""

 Capt. Waterman made so much money for his shipowners, and was so remark able in running quick passages, that in 1851 N. l.. < G. Griswold contracted with William H. Webb, to build him a new clipper ship, the Challenge, calcu- lated to outrival anything then afoat. She equalled all expectations, and flew over the water on her trial trip as grace ful and feet as bird on the wing. When lying at the foot of Pine street, her bowsprit at high tide reached clear across South street, and over the roofs of the stores. Crowds Hooked to see her. Capt. Waterman was anxious to make her first trip @ memorable one, and he was harder than ever on his crew. One of his best men dropped off the yard into the sea. Before the vessel could be put about and the boats low cred he was drowned.

 The Captain accused the men of being slow and shortened their watches below in other words, robbed them of aI- ready insufficient sleep. It is said of him that on this voyage he actually shot sailors down from the yard arm. All who could do so escaped at the first port. When the Challenge arrived at San Francisco, crowds of indignant sail ors awaited the Captain and the mate, Douglas, on the wharf. They threat ened to lynch them, if they caught them. The mob ignored the vigilance committee, and took the law in it's own hands. Capt. Waterman became really alarmed, and he and Douglas landed in a small boat and escaped to the coun- try.

 The two men were finally captured, and there was trial, and shipping mer- chants in N. Y. city subscribed to fun to defend them. Capt Waterman was not allowed to take command of his ship again. He settled in San Francisco, and as times were prosperous, made money. Up to two years ago he was Inspector of Hulls for the port of San Francisco. He owned a ranch some- where out in the country, but always lived in San Francisco, at the Lick House. Some of his old sailors used to meet him there years afterward, and he always invited them to drink wine with him. He died rich. The Challenge finally drifted into the foreign service.

 Capt. Waterman visited New York twice since he left there on his memor- able cruise in the Challenge. He came overland each time. Once ho visited Sailors Snug Harbor, and the old vet erans there were permitted to see the man about whom they had heard so many hard stories. ""He had his faults, said one who was acquainted with him, ""but he also had his virtues. His suc- cess lay in his strict discipline. He could not tolerate a lazy sailor. Good men, who were able to work had always got along with him."""

Henry testified that Mrs. Schwartz gave
himself and Drake to understand that
her husband intended to kill them both
on sight. Mrs. Schwartz came to his
house Saturday evening and informed
them that her husband had gone to the
mill and that favorable opportunity
would offer itself to kill him on his re
turn home. Drake and Mrs.
Schwartz then went to the spot
where the deed was committed
and when Schwartz appeared, Drake
shot him first with shotgun and then
with revolver, being only about ten
feet from his victim. Schwartz fell from
the wagon and never spoke afterwards.
All three then mounted horses, tied near
by, and returned to Henry's house, where
they burnt their shoes to avoid detection
by their tracks. The examination ad
journed till tomorrow morning. A large
crowd fol owed the prisoners on their
return to jail, and it will net be surpl isiny
il Dfake should be lynched."

sion",,"CHICAGO, June 3.-The Republican


National Convention, the eighth in the


history of the party, convened at noon


to-day. The immense hall, having a


seating capacity of 1900, was flied


in every part. Looking from the
platform the view presented was
one Of an almost unending mass Of
solid black garments relieved by the


variegated colors of ladies whose toilets
made 1t an imposing one, not alone from
the fact OF the number present, but from
sense of the great and responsible con-
siderations which brought SO many to-
gether from all sections of the country.
The interior arrangements of the build
ing for the exposition of business have
been admirably carried out. One thou
sand seats are occupied by persons Of
national reputation who are present by
the grace Of the National Committee.
Swinging over the desk Of the Chair
man aud touching the arches
is a wide spreading sounding board.
The delegates and alternates occupy
level space bounded by square lines.
They are hemmed in on two sides by a
tier OF boxes occupied manly by guests
OF the delegates. The section OF the
nall occupied by the working body of
the Convention is broken by four wide
aisles frcn, the edges Of which rise Roman
standards pendant with blue silk BAN
ners imprinted on gold with the names
of the States and Territories. Bordering
on the left, facing the State Of Alabama

number Of United States Senators and
Representatives were present among the
delegates.


At q meeting of the Indiana delega-
cation this morning twenty nine voted to
present Harrison as candidate, and it
is understood that twenty-five Of these
will surely vote for him. This action
has created intense excitement and prom

Lad of Savannah, Missouri, Confesses to


the Murder of Two Little Girls-Lust the
Cause of the Crime.


Several days ago the two young daugh-
tiers of a man named Mclaughlin, residing
near Savannah, Mo-, were found dead in u
thicket near that city. The body of the
eldest was horribly mutilated and outraged.
Certain circumstances threw suspicion
upon one Oliver Bsteman, and he was
accordingly arrested and charged with the
murder of the girls.


For some time he was in constant danger
of being lynched, and this so intimidated
him that he made the following confession:
He was at home when the girls wentthere.
He saw them go to the woods to pick hazel
nuts and followed them within fifteen min
utes afterwards. They were near the edge
of a cornfeld when he came up with them.
While talking with them he saw Henry
Knappenberger passing. He then induced
the children to go further into the corn
field, and while the eldest was walking in
front fhim he shot her with q 22-caliber
ball, and when she turned around shot her
with 52-calibre ball, killing her instantly.
| The smallest girl started to run, when he
followed and caught her. She begged so
hard for him to let her go that he says he
came very near allowing her to do so. He
did let her 60, but knowing she would tell
he followed and caught her again, threw her
down and cut her throat. 1t was fifteen or
twenty minutes after Knappenberger passed
before he shot the eldest girl. After kill
| ing the youngest girl he went back to his
| first victim, outraged her person and
then mutilated her body, to crerte the i'm
preston that it was the deed of q
Grassy man. He relates that the eldest girl
said nothing after he shot her, and that he
held his hand over the mouth of the young
est to prevent her cries being heard. He
says that after all these terrible occurrences
he went to the creek washed his hands,
threw his knife in the stream and went
home. When the father of the girls came
to his house inquiring for them, he wanted
to 60 and help search for them, but his
friends would not allow him. They thought
he was ill. The fiend declares that he was
induced to confess owing to the circumstan-
tial manner in which Henry Knapenberger
had accused him of the crime.


The prisoner was taken to st. Joseph,
and is now confined in the Jail there, where
he is safe from all lyuching."

There were some movers camped there

Island lately are indeed enough to rouse to
wrath the residents OF the various towns 1t
cannot be denied that such occurrences
seriously damage the reputation of any
community in which they happen. But the
threats of lynching the negro who committed
the Spraguc assault do not help matters. In
deed they make matters worse, for lynching is
the extreme Of lawlcSsness. There are other
entirely proper methods, however, that the
authorities of the excited towns might adopt
which would make Long Island disagrceable
for tramps. Strict vagTancy ordinances rigidly
enforced in every village would probably an
swer the purpose."

 ""While Judge Kelley's speech last night was interesting, powerful and thorough, that of Powell Clayton who followed him while it may have been interesting to those fond of vui- gar witicisms, was light and most indecent. If Mr. Powell Clayton cannot deliver any other speeches than such as he treated the people of Pittsburg to, last night, we think it would be well for the republican party to supercede him in their lis, of speakers by the colored gentle man from Mississippi, Mir.

 Judge Lynch's Hand.

 CosTELLA, Texas, Aug. 17.-Inquiry into the history of Green Mccullough, who was hanged by vigilantes on the night of the 18th, reveals @ record of series of eight bloody murders in which Mccullough has figured as getting the drop on his victims in the same way as he did on Charley Bragg, his last man. The first knowledge of him dates from Antrascora county, where he laid out his eighth man and had so terrorized the people that he did very much as he pleased. Con- ing to this county he made his debut about a year ago in an encounter with Bragg growing out of political differences. Bragg knew his man and opened on him by shooting off three of his fingers, defecting his aim so that Me Cullough's return fire missing Bragg acci- dental1y killed County Judge Williams. Since then Mccullough had gone his way until meeting Bragg again, he renewed the trouble by shooting him down with rifle.

 LEXINGTON, Ky, Aug. 17.-It was learned yesterday that Alsop and Graves, the con victs who escaped from the penitentiary at Frankfort during the late revolt, had been seen in Woodford county coming westward. Notice was sent all around the country to watch for them. On Friday word was brought to the city that they had demanded dinner at Tom Winn's house, seven miles from town, Began in that neighborhood on Tails creek pike. A sherifFs posse was quickly made up and started. The sheriff asked Stephen G. Sharpe, county attorney, and George Cad wallader to join the party and go down Jacks creek pike and then join him at his house, six miles from the city. Began lives about a mile from the sheriff. Sharpe and Cadwallader went down Walnut Hill pike as the convicts had attempted to get across and proceeded half mile beyond the toll gate on that road, taken a horse and buggy and hid at 8 place commanding view of the country some distance both ways. They soon saw two men pass some straw stocks down to- ward the toll gate. The pursuers searched through the church yard and were informed by w. Estill that Q lady had seen two. armed men pass back of the Me Fadden place. Sharpe took Estills horse and Cadwallader drove the buggy, both turning into Walter Scott's front gate on the Richmond pike. Then one went each side of the house. They saw two men going through the hemp field and Sharpe galloped after them. When he got within about sixty yards of them both leveled their guns at him. Sharpe slipped off his horse and took to tree. The convicts also sought trees A running fight opened. ! Sharpe fired at Graves and then tried to get a shot at Alsop, who followed Graves across ! As Alsop ran Sharpe rested his gun on the 1 fence, fired and hit Alsop in the ! left shoulder. The posse now came up. | Sharpe galloped round through the woods and again sighted the fugitives going through l the stable and into cornfeld. He rode along by the corner of Shelby's house into | the cornfield and all around and seeing no | tracks coming out reported to the posse that l the convicts were still in the cornfield. The | men were posted all around the field and the | party went in on the track of the fugitives Cassel and James Veal joined the posse 1 here. Sharpe, Cassen and Veal followed 1 the track in the corn across ravine | and struck the track again. Their l first intination of the whereabouts | of the convicts was a couple of l shots and Cassel fell, saying to Sharpe, ''Oh, Steve, oh Steve"" Veal fired on the eonvicts. Sharpe fell in the corn and Veal went back and reported both killed. Sharpe, who was playing ''possum,"" !"" getting sight of one who 1 proved to be Graves, fired, dropped, reloaded and everything again remained quiet. Sharpe now crawled out of the corn to the ravine and waved his hat to the posse, but receiving no response crawled through the ravine and l joined the posse. The whole party now took the rows through the corn toward the bodies. Sharpe crossing the rows saw the convict raised on his arm with pistol pre- sented at Deputy Sheriff Rogers. The weac pon snapped and the posse fired volley and rushing up found Graves dead and AlsoI dying Each of the eonvicts had 8 needle gun and five pistols between them, foul Colts and one Smith & Wesson.

 SCRANTON, April 13.-A girl named Sadie

 McClanaghan escaped yesterday afternoon

 from back room on Spruce street, where

 she had been chained to the floor for nearly three weeks by quack calling himself W. s.

 Madden. She made her way to the Susque-

 hannah hotel, where she begged Mrs. Car

 penter, wife of the hotel proprietor, to save

 her. Madden, following in close pursuit,

 dashed into the hotel and seized his tremb- ling victim. The girl breke from his grasp and, clasping her arms around Mrs. Carpen-

 ter, begged her piteously, 'sFor Gods sake save me; don't let him take me back again or he will kill me-"" Madden was compelled to go away without her, and was arrested shortly after at his office, where the chains and locks with which he had bound her were found.

 The girl appeared against him before May or Beamish and told sad story. She said she had known him for two years. He be- trayed her, and promised that as soon as he secured divorce from his wife, who is iv- 1 ing at Altoona, he would marry her. Sadie WAS then living with her sister in LsWistown. Madden wanted her to come to Scranton, and after much urging she consented. Find ing that there was no sign of a divorce she wanted to go away, but this made him angry, and he threw her down in his office, put chains on her ankles and fastened one to staple in the office and the other to bed. Whenever she

 raised an outcry he jumped on her and choked her until she thought she would die He nailed down the windows, and often left her chained to the floor all night. Her food consisted of sandwiches and pieces of bread

 and butter which he brought home from the neighboring saloons in his pocket. Some 1 times he came home drunk, and then he beat her. Yesterday afternoon he took of her chains for a short time and she rushed into { the street and escaped.

 Madden at first denied her statement but finally admitted having chained her to the floor for fear she would go away. In default of bail he was committed to the county jail There is an intense feeling against him, and

 threats of lynching were freely indulgsd in on the streets He is about thirty five years old, and came to Scranton little over year ago in company with one Gibson. and he has been practising quackery here ever since His victim is g farmer's daughter, about twenty years old."

No baseball game is booked for to-nior- TOW, this season being somewhat disastrous to the Milligsn nine in their contests with the Rifles and no further games are looked for

 A number of our young people think it is about time for another social hop, and would like to see either the Milligans or Rifles start the ball rolling and not have so much time elapse between dances here after.

Hatz has probably more warm per sonal friends than any other man ill the County, IS noted for integrity and strs ight forward dealing and if elected will make good Sheriff.

There was another session of the Danville
investigating committee yesterday. DIR. W
I. Voolfolk, of Orange county, Virginia, tes-
titled that an armed column took possession
of tho polls at his homo aud prevented
colored men from voting the democratic
ticket. He saw two white mon armed on
election day, but was not armed himself.


William L. Ray, of Washington county,
Virginia, denied the statement Of a previous
witness that thero had been violence aud in
timidation in that county on election day
Ho bad accepted the color line drawn by the
coalitionists and had on tho stump advised
white men to avenge at the ballot box the
death of their white brethren at the hands of
q colored mob. 1t was reported in his county
that both whites and negroes had been killed
| at Danville.


Ex-Congressnan A. f. Fulkerson, Of tho
same county, corroborated the previous wit
| ness.


G. +. Frigg testified that tho riot had little
| or no effect in Russell and adjoining counties
where he had canvassed.


Isaac Christian, of Charles county, Va,
said the best relations existed between whites
| and black, and between democrats and read
justers, but not between readjusters and
| straightout republicans in his section. Tho
Danyillo riot had little effect on the election,
| but the supreme court decision In the civil
rights case had much effect.


II. j. Cohen, a white transfer agent Of Dan
willie, swore that he saw House Lawson and
| William Llewellyn, colored men, loading
their revolvers in the hall Of saloon on the
morning before the riot. He named several
coiorod men whom no said had pistols, but
could not remember any whito men who
were armed. He said that Matt Lawson
colored, fired the first shot. One negro
showed him pistol and said ii was ""loaded
for good use."" Another negro exhibited q
pistol to q companion and said, ""If you vote
the democratic ticket, that's my game""
Lawson was n bad man, and witness had seon
him chasing a mulatto boy with pistol.


w. p. Everett Of Danville, testified that
Hense Lawson traded one of two pistols
which he had for pair Of shoes week
before the riot.


Mr.. Charles II. OFarrell, contestant for a
seat in congress from Harrisonburg, Va,
| testified that the Danville riot was to the
disadvantage Of the democrats, becanse il
drove people from the straightout republican
| attachment Of the democratic party over To
the coslitionists. For that reason the demo-
Gratis tried to suppress the news Of the riot.


Senator Sherman put In evidence a copy of
tho Richmond Dispatch, dated Oct. 80
1888, with The following passage marked:
| Every day the Main. street idlers put out the
| report that there has been riot at Danville 1t
excites great many people, ana Goes no good


]. r. Peterson, of Petersburg, testified that
he knew of no attempts Of the democrats to
draw the color line.


William Long and A. G. Jackson, of Peters
burg, described the assault upon Gen. Malone
on election day.


George W. Wiemly, OF Tappahannock, a
white coalitionist, testified that on Nov.
2 he was at Paul's ocross-rosds and heard
that report had been circulated that the
negroes were about to rise in Lynchburg
Danville, and other places, and the people
we're sending to Richmond for arms and am
munition. Ho wrote to the Richmond IVhi.
that night asking that the report be denied
as it would tend to reduce tho coalition vote
Thomas Fricker, of Ashtabula, Ohio, gave
his opinions concerning the negro race. Ii
1876, when he was in North Carolina, dcmo
cratic negroes were persecuted by their re
publican brethren. Lately the negroes hat
become arrogant, assumed an air of owner
ship, got in the way OF passing carriages, ant
generally annoyed white ladies and gentle
mon. Witness had been in Danville sine,
the riot, and had formed the opinion tina
there never was little blood shed with bet
ter results than there."

 From the Committee Meeting. But a Successor to Purcell Is Chosen Banker Kelley of New York the Man Governor CleveIand's Letter of Ac- ceptanee.

 ALBANY, July 23.-Al was hustle and ex- citement around the Delavan House this evening Big and little politicians were there from all parts of the State. The political situation was discussed, the talk being of course Cleveland, since none but his friends were in the crowd. The State committee meeting was tame affair. There was one significant feature about it, however While every other district was represented the Tam many members did not show up either per sonally or by proxy. It did not seem to bother the other members, who are now strong for the Governor, but it caused out siders to rub their noses in wonder and cough or cry 'ahem!'' when they were told all would be right in time. The representative of the United Press talked with a number of the committee members They averred that Tammany was perhaps little in the sulks, but that her absence had no real significance. Senator Murphy said he could assign no reason for their absence. 'sI presume they are waiting for the formal organization of Tammany hall,"" said the Senator, E'before taking any official action. The expressions of the members of the organization convince us that Tammany is all right. Moreover Daniel Manning has appointed s. P. Nichols member of the executive committee. That does not look if Manning attached any significance to the circumstance"" The Tam many absentees s. P. Nichols, Seventh district; Edward Cahill, Eleventh district; Thomas F. Grady Twelfth district; Edward J. Wood, Fourteenth district. Lieutenant Governor Hill remarked to-day that the meeting was merely formal one and he could not blame the Tammany men, who were presumably taking vacations, for not attending. All the other districts, it will be remembered, were represented,

 It was about 3:30 before the State com mittee was called to order. It met in room in the Delavan hardly large enough to ac- commodate bridal couple. Yet into this room were crowded at that time about forty politicians and dozen reporters. The lat ter, however, were not allowed to stay long.

As soon as ponderous l Daniel Manning rapped to order he snapped his teeth and uttered some words which, be- ing interpreted, were as follows: ''As this is an executive meeting of the committee it is necessary that all who are not members should retire."" The hint was somewhat reluctantly taken. In a few minutes the committee were alone with their thoughts and their tongues. The roll call showed the following present: First district, c.

About one o'clock John E. Devlin telegraphed to ex-Mayor Cooper to the effect that the sentiment of the committee was in favor of his being chairman of the executive commit tee. A reply came about five o'clock stating that he would accept. His election was of course a foregone conclusion.

 NEW YORK; June 26.-The corridors of the Fifth Avenue Hotel swarmed with RepubIi- can politicians to-day. Nearly all the mem bers of the National and State committees ar. rived this morning and meetings of both committees were announced to be held at at noon. Stephen B. Elkins, ex-Senator Chafee, John R. Lynch of Mississippi, the temporary chairman of the Chicago conven- tion, Powell Clayton of Arkansas, ex-Senator Fessenden of Connecticut, Garrett H. Hobart of New Jersey and Colonel George w. Hooker of Vermont were conspicuous in the gathering. Early in the day Stephen B. Elkins and few other gentlemen, members of the National committee, whose names were not divulgsd, held private consultation at which it was understood an attempt was made to complete the slate before calling the committee together. It was well understood that there was no opposition to B. F. Jones, the wealthy manufacturer of Pittsbnrg, who had been decided upon as chairman of the committee. It was not 50 easy, however, to agree upon secretary as it was on the head of the committee. Colonel Hooker wanted to be his own successor and announced that he would make vigorous fight for the place. Ex-Senator Fessenden was Colonel Rockers chief opponent and his friends said he would stick to the last. Garrett H Hobart, of New Jer- sey, was also mentioned for the place, but If that gentleman had any ambi- tion in that direction, it was of short duration The National committee met at 12,3O, half an hour after the time set for the meeting. The roll was called. It showed that each State was represented by it's committeeman or by proxy, with the exception of Georgia, Minnesota, Texas and Utah, Wyoming, Mon tana and Washington territories. The only business done was the appointment of com mittee of three on organization consisting of J. Manchester Hayes, of Maine, Gar rett H. Hobart of New Jersey and Frank Mercy of Louisiana. The oom- mittee then took 8 recess for half an hour. It is understood that the reason the committee did not go right through it's work and finish it was on account of being unable to decide between Colonel Hooker and ex> Senator Fessenden for secretary. The ma jority of the committee favored Hooker personally, but hesitated about making an

 

 which of the two gentlemen was preferred by MT. Blaine. It would be naturally sup- posed that Elkins would know all about this, but if he did he unable to satisfy some of MT. Rockers friends this point. After reassembling the National committee completed it's organization by the election of B F Jones as chairman, and ex-Senator Fes- senden and Colonel Hooker as secretaries. Mir Elkins succeeded in satisfying the committee that MT Fessenden was MT Blaine's first choice and Connecticut's representative was accord ingly made secretary with Colonel Hooker his assistant. A Derrick and Birdseye Blaokman were chosen electors at-large and Charles Minzesseimer chosen to fill the place of Joseph W Harper, resigned. The National executive committee consists of Messrs Chaff-e, William Mason, Haynes, Crapo, Saunderson, Elkins, Hobart, Hooker. Lawson, Humphrey, Blair, Clayton, Mercy, Conger, Sanborn.

the Death-Bed Confession of the Murder


ess-The Victim Her Own Daughter.


DAYTON, o., March IL.


A horrible and somewhat sensational
crime of seventeen years agoh been re-
called by the death-bed confession Of Mrs.
Catherine Kett, that she murdered her
own daughter on the evening of January
IL, 1867. Christine Kett, bright, pretty
German girl of eighteen years old, was
found dead at her mothers house. Her
head was pounded into a shapeless mass,
and by her side was a bloody axe which
told the story. Part of the skull
had fallen into the cellar
and her brains were spattered
about the room. The widest excitement
ensued. Several parties were arrested
and narrowly escaped lynching, her lover
among them. Her mother seemed frantic
with grief, and urged lynching the prison
ers. In course of time all the accused
proved their innocence, and the crime has
been almost forgotten. The mother soon
removed from that house. She grew old
rapidly and looked haggard. She had hor-
rible dreams and slept poorly, awakened
with screams. Once she got mad at her
son, caught him by the throat and said:
81 have shed blood once and may do it
again"" Aweek or so ago she was taken
sick, but refused to have physicians.
Last Sunday, seeing she must soon die,
she called her son and after charg
ing him to keep her secret till death,
confessed with minuteness how she had
got mad at her daughter for staying all
night with a friend and struck her with
an axe, killing her. She then SO arranged
things that no suspicion attached to her,
and caused the arrest of innocent parties.
She soon died. Her son meant to keep
his mothers secret, but somehow an ink
ling of it reached the ears of the report
ers, and two of them have, after much
hard work, succeeded in getting the
whole story. Mrs. Kett was sixty years
of age when she died."

Grow of Pennsylvania, from the minority OF
the committee, offered a substitute for the
tenth rule, which prescribes the mode of

Parks accepted the proposed amendment,

that the manner of the election of delegates
from the District of Columbia should be pre-
scribed by the national republican committee.
The rules were then adopted.

Phelps that he was not only not a candidate
but did not want to be a candidate. There
had been no doubt about his preference any
where He was not tied to anyone, and
would exercise his best Judgment in aiding

A Pertinent Inquiry.


Roosevelt of New York inquired what had
become of the proposition in regard to repre-

States.

nation as 20 the effect of the civil service law

The amendment offered by Mr.. Sanders
was adopted.


The minority report changing the order of
representation in national conventions giving
greater representation to the republican
States, excited warm discussion and was
withdrawn.


The platform was then reported. 1t rec
ommends such revision of the tariff as will
protect American labor, and denounces the
importation of foreign labor either from China
or Asia.


y ) The Platform.


The republicans of the United States in national



principles upon which they have triunphed for six
successive presidential elections, and congratulate
the American people on the attainment of many re-
suits in legislation and administration by which the
republican party has after saving the Union, done
80 much to render it's Institutions just, equal and
ben .cent, standing the safeguard of liberty and
the embodiment of best thought and highest pur-
poses of her citizens. The republican party gained
strength by its quick and faithful response to the
demands Of the people for the freedom and equality
Of all men, for a united nation, for assuring the
rights of all citizens, for the elevation of labor and
for honest currency for purity in legislation and
for integrity and accountability in all departments
of the government. and it accepts the new duty of
leading in the work Of progress and reform.
I'VE lament the death OF President Garfield, whose
sound craftsmanship, long conspicuous in Congress,
gave promise of strong and successful administra.
tion promise fully realized durdg his short period
of ofce as President of the United States. his dis
ringuised in and peace has endeared him
TO the hearts OF the American people.


In the administration Of President Arthur rec
oguixe that wise, conservative and patriotic policy
under which the country has been blessed with re-
markabl. prosperity, and we believe his eminent
services are entitled to and will receive the hearty
approval of every CITIZEN


Il is the first duty Of good government to pro-
tect the rights and promote the interests of s
people. The diversity of inndustry is produc-
tive of the general prosperity and of the indepen.
dence Of the people.


We therefore demand that an imposition Of duties
ON foreign imports shall be made not for ''revenue
only but in raising the reQu1site revenues for the
government such duties shall be levied to afford
security diversified industries and protection

Their house at Avondale was burned down, on the night of the 16th inst, since which time the in mates have been missing. The find ing of their bodies aroused suspicion of foul play, and they were taken to an undertaker's establishment for ex- animation, where it was discovered that the skulls had been crushed and the bodies otherwise mutilated. Sev- eral persons were immediately arrest ed on suspicion of being implicated in the murder; two of these, Ingalls, and Johnson, by the confession of the for mer, are now known, to be the mur- derers. Ingall relates the following story of the crime: ""On Friday morn ing Ben Johnson, who lives with me, said, I have three ""points"" for to- night He explained that ""points"" meant subjects for the medical college l asked Johnson where they were, He replied, Tine three people at the Tay- Tor cabin on the hill. They are no good. We can knock them on the head agreed, and then went to the Ohio Medical College and told them I would bring them three subjects that night. They agreed to pay $l5 apiece, and gave me note to express man R. B. Dixon, whom 1 engaged to meet us on Avondale pike at 9 o'clock that night. After dark Johnson and I started for Taylor's. We had a bot tie of whiskey, took several drinks and felt good. The door of the cabin was not locked. We entered and found the old man sitting by the fireplace, his wife Tn front of him and the girl at work in the room. Johnson had club, a little longer than a po- liceman's club, and began striking them over the head, right and left, as he would cattle. The woman strug- gled and offered resistance, and I finally choked her to death. Johnson easily disposed of tho others"" Then they stripped the bodies, put them in sacks and carried them to tho wagon. They then drove to the college and delivered them. Ingalls, says he knows nothing about the firing of the cabin. Sixty negroes threatened to lynch the prisoners, but found the Avondale jail too we'll guarded. In- gals confesses to have stolen several bodies from the new cemetery beyond Avondale, and sold them to the Ohio Medical College,"

CAN CONVENTION.

: BLAINE AND LOGAN


SELECTED AS THE STANDARD BEARERS.",,"The great National Republican con-,
vention which convened in Chicago at
high noon on Tuesday the Sd inst. con-
cluded its labors at 10 p. m. Friday.
On Tuesday nothing was done beyond
efecting temporary organization and
the appointments of committees. Hon.
John r. Lynch (colored) of Mississippi
was elected temporary chirman over.
Gen. Powell Clayton of Arkansas. This
result was brought about by q combine
tion of the anti-Blaine men on Lynch.


On Wednesday the convention held
two sessions, but nothing was done be-
yond hearing and accepting the report
of the committee on permanent organi-
cation. which named Gen. John 3.
Henderson of Missouri for permanent
chairman. .


The real work of the convention did
not begin until Thursday. When the
committee on credentials made its re-
port, admitting the Malone delegation
from Virginia, the convention went
wild with enthusiasm. Considerable
time was taken up with the report of
the committee on rules The reading
of the platform was repeatedly inter-
rupted by cheers, and the sections re-
ferring to the tariff, Arthur's admins
tration, equalizing soldiers pensions,
the restoration of the navy and other
clauses, being applauded to the echo.
The nominating speeches were made at
the evening session. The names of all
the candidates were received with more
or less enthusiasm, but the names of
Blaine and Arthur elicted such scenes
as only can be enacted at a great ma
tional convention. The followers of
the two leading candidates were very
nearly equally devided, and each tried
to outdo the other with loud and long
continued applause. The convention
adjourned at a. m. Friday, after a
continuous session of seven hours.


The convention met again ,,at II a.
NJ, and balloting at once commenced,
with the following result:

The delegates opposed to the nomin-
alton of Blaine then made a strenuous
effort to carry a motion for a recess un-
til 1880 p. M, but they were defeated
by vote of 451 nays and 346 yeas,
whereupon another ballot was ordered:

sion.",,"The other day an obscure sheet pub.
lished In Los Angeles gave a garbod
extract from paragraph which appeared
In the Anahcim Gazette. As thus ropro-
duced 1t was made to convey slur upon
che editor of this paper. We therefore
reproduce it as II was written and pub
lished


Joseph d. Lynch, editor Of the Los
Angeles Herald, announces editorially
that he Is not candidate for Congress,
because his paper has become such valu.
able properly that re cannot afford to
abandon its management even to enter
Congressional marble halls. We have
IN idea that Mr.. Lynch could not have
been elected; and we have another idea
that II he had, by any turn Of the politi.
cAl wheel, been elected, he would have
made mn exceptionally able and iudustri.
ous Representative, and Southern Cali.
fornia would have been the gamer by
hia presence in Congress.


Tho editor Of the HERALD Withdrew
from the Congressional contest when his
chances for nomination and election
were quito hattering, and he did so for
tho reasons stated in the brief paragraph
Of the other day. That is to say, the
exigent claims Of newspaper business
which is growing with the rapidity Of
Jonnh's gourd require his attention, and
no proposes TO concentrate all his ener
gies to its management.


As 1t Ia he has no preferred candidate
for the honor, holding himself in readiness
i 10 support any good Democrat. Without
question, should tho HERALD choose to
do so. it could exert very potent influ.
ence in determining the direction which
the honor would take, but this is not
Democratic precedent, and this paper
prefers TO await the natural and proper
z drift of things.


So much by way Of introduction TO
brief word of criticism Of the course Of
conductors of newspapers towards each
other. They entirely justify the old
adage that no two of trade can agree.
Although nine out Of ten of the public
men OF the United States owe their very
creation to the gentlemen of the press
or to put 1t more forcibly-to the press
gang-these gentry seem to be inspired
with an Unsuitable Impulse to see to it
that none of their own profession shall
attain political honor or distinction
with their help. Many newspaper men
have achieved front rank in the polite
al councils of the nation; but, almost to
man, they have accomplished this
distinction in the spite Of the jealous
dispraise Of members of their own
profession. This was remarkably
tho case with Simon Cameron,
who began life at the case, but
who attained personal political
power never possessed by any other
man in the United States save Thurlow
Weed and Horace Greeley, both news
paper men, since Jefferson aud Jackson
were laid in their graves. On the other
hand, what myriads Of pompous and
bulbous nothipgs owe their whole rcpu.
tation and standing to the newspapers
Of all tho strutting nobodies who figure
In both houses Of lhe national Congress,
how few there are who cannot refer their
Importance to the friendly and genial
offices of n newspaper?


The editor of tue HERALD admits that,
for moment, he should have liked to
gosto Congress, but he claims that he
has an office, in assisting TO develop and
, mold public opinion in this section, of a
for higher function than the legislative
one, useful as that may be made ty able
and honest men. There are 80 many in
ferior men in both the Senate and House
Of Representatives, of late years, that
the honor of belonging to either body
has greatly miniiied. The man who, at
the head of daily journal, works in
cessantly for the best good of his sec
tion, and makes it his diurnal duty to
develop all the excelsior impulses of his
fellow men, enjoys far higher honor
than office, as such, could confer upon
him. 1t seems to us that our brethren
of the press too often overlook this fact

armies in the field are successful or no,

The secretary has, during the year, sent to each of the Senators and members of Con eress of Connecticut copy of the resolu- tions relative to the necessity of providing a freproof building in Washington for the preservation of the army medical museum and library of the surgeon generals office. Since then 8 bill to accomplish this object hes been introduced in Congress and will likely pass. The secretary says concerning the defeat of the proposed law introduced at the last session of the Legislature relative to the publishing of the working formulas by which patent medicines are made, that it was defeated mainly on the ground of injustice resulting to druggists who had large stocks of these medicines on hand. Concern | ing the publication of the early literary trans actions of the society authorized last year, | he reports that the expense it was found will amount to $500. The Hartford County so- @c lRI9 1S | which was the contribution of one member | The New Haven society will furnish $1O0 more and Fairfield $25. In view of other I assurances made before the meeting of the | fellows Wednesday, the secretary was instruct | ed to print ,0OO copies for distribution.

 The treasurer's report compares very fa- ! vorably with that of last year. Five counties report $22O arrearages for dues of 1883, and the total for the remaining three is $48.2 President Nye then read a paper, the title of which thoroughly we'll gives it's import, ! ssThe Medical Profession and It's Claims to l the Respect and Gratitude of the Oommuni ty"" It was received with applause The Rhode Island and Massachusetts fol- lowed. and Dr. W. C. Vile, of San | dy Hook, made the report of the commit tee on matters of professional interest. and then Dr. R. W. Mathewson, of Durham, read pleasing and instructive paper on Medicine Fifty Years Ago"" He said that out of four hundred members of the society fifty years ago, but fifteen remain; six in New Haven county, two in Litchfield county. one in Fairfield county, one in Holland county and one in Middlesex county Of the medl- cal class in New Haven in 1883, of 62 stu dents only six are now living. Half Of the United States were represented in that class; the hospital was new at that time and had but few patients. There were no clinics, and the school was closed eight months l in the year. Bright. Graves or | Addison had not then become immottalized by having their names prefxed to a disease. I The hypodernnical syringe, chloroform and | the bromides were not then known, and the | practical use of anesthetics had not been dis covered There was quite rage for taking gas and ether for amusement, and 1t was said I that Professor SiIliman would occasionally | administer air from the gas bags to hoax the students But it was left, said the doctor, to Horace Wells years after to make practical use of the discovery. Gyneeology | was not considered of much importance Tn 1 those times and only three or four lectures were given on diseases Of females. Indeed, Dr. Fordyoe Barker's and Dr. Bedfords ' manner of treating these last were severely denounced for time by some of the medical journals But the old-time customs were l bound to be swept away eventually. The remedy in all sorts of cases was the lancet.  the stage of collapse or reaction. All used | it. Blood letting, easily, often and largely, was the rule Some claimed that acute dis eases in little children were frequently eured ! by drawing away four-ffths of the blood ir ! the body.

 Dr. N. E. Wordin, of Bridgeport, read 6 | lengthy paper of particular scientific interes! | on the ''Germ Theory of Disease"" Dr. E. |, Wilson had paper on ''Cases of Conjunc ! tivitis"" and G. W. Harris, Old Lyme, ou ! ''Hernia."" Then followed the introduction of general business and cases of interest and dissussion. Surgical cases from the New l Haven hospital were oited, and the most un 1 pronounceable of words were shot across tho | room by interested doctors as they warmed I up to their york. Dr. George B Packard had paper on the ""Early Diagno | sis and Treatment of Potts. Disease of tht ! Spine.''

A Nebraska Wan Lynched and Resus-


citated-A Curious story.",,"


Sheriff Joseph Warren, of Webster
county, and his deputy, George Ball came
into Lincoln, Neb., the other day with
prisoner who has undergone an expert
ence OF which few parallels are on record.
The Journal thus relates the story: Ii
was Joseph Cook, who was taken from
the sheriff at Blue Hill on the 18th and
hung by mob and subsequently taken
down and resuscitated. He was brought
to the penitentiary for safe keeping. The
murder for which Cook is rnder arrest
was that of Leonard Rail, farmer liv-
ing near Blue Hill, for whom he had
been working. The murder was com
mitted on Nov. l, and Cook was captured
at st. Joseph about week ago.


THE preliminary examination had
been completed"" said the sheriff. ""and
we were just taking Cook from tAe hotel
to a special train that was to carry us to
Hastings and then to Lincoln, when we
were surrounded by small crowd of
men, that poured out of the stables, and
alleys, and stores around until they must
have numbered 500. My four deputies
and myself were armed, and we drew
our guns and warned the crowd back,
but il was of no use. Lynchers and spec
tators were mixed up indiscriminately,
and shot INTO the crowd would have
been as likely to kill an innocent specta-
tor as anybody else. The lynchers We're
all armed, and we were covered by their
revolvers until we were seized and held
while the prisoner was hurried away.

GALVESTON. Nov. 14.-Bctwcen four and five
o'clock this morning the through express on tho
Houston and Texas Central Railroad was wrecked
at BrazOs River bridge near Hampstead, Texas
and twelve persons instantly killed and
twenty injured. The disaster was the work Of
tramps as an examination of the track showed
that spikes and plates had been removed and the
rail- twisted so that the train would topic down
nm embankme thirty feet deep The intention of
thosc who planned the wreck was to
plunge the entire train into the river, which at this
point is deep and has a rapid current. The scheme
was partly successful and this accountsfOr the large
loss of life


A heavy fog hung over the river and obscured
the moonlight as the train approached the bridge.
The locomotive crossed the rail in safety. The bag
gage car jumped the track and the coupling to the
tender parted. The locomotive reached the
other side in safety but the baggagc-ca trembled
for an instant the brink and then dashed
over into the Brazos. The express and
smoking-car followed, crashing into each other and
ping the wreck high above the surface of the
water. ladies' coach and sleeping-coach followed
the smoker, but the had only a few passengers,
most of whom were killed outright. Many of the
passenfiers were asleep at the time of the disaster
and the exact number of the dead cannot yet be
ccrtained.


JUMPING TO SAVE THEMSELVES.


When the baggage-car went over number of the
passengers who were awake realized that some
thing was wrong. They rushed to the back plat
form of the smoking-car, and when they
saw the forward part of the 90 down they
jumped into the rlvcr and saved their lives. Org

cries of tho wounded could be heard
for long distance. 1t was only
few feet from the bank to the first and, armed
with axes from the locomotive, Il rescung party set
to work and in short time recovered twelve dead
bodies, and rescued nearly twenty passengers who
had been seriously injured. One body was found in

remainder in the ladies' coach.

Mrs. Hendershot.",,"Mrs. Hendershot.


CANNELToN, Oct 1.-THE Cannelton En-
quirer and Reporters account of the horrible
butchery of Mrs. Hendershot, in Perry county,
| leaves little doubt that the whole scheme was
concocted and carried out by her son Marion,
who was lynched The Enquirer and Reporter
says that Marion made three confessions, in all
of which he stated distinctly that he alone was
guilty. In a fourth confession made by him he
said he had help, but it was neither his father
nor his brother


His statement was that he induced his mother
to tart with him to Grandvew on pretense that
young woman named Gwin, to whom he said
he was to be married in few days, had 800 to
pay for the farm owned by the Hendershots in
Salina county, Ill. His eyes were sore, and in
| order to get his mother to leave home with him
at night he told her that the light hurt his eyes
! so badly in the day time that he could not see.
Before leaving home he made arrangements
| with his father to go to Tell City next day.
| where he, his mother and Miss Gwin would
meet him in the afternoon with the deed (which
was to be drawn at Grandvlew and there signed
by the mother) for him to sign. On Wednesday
| night about o'clock Marion and his mother left
| the Hendershot residence in a two-horse wagon.
When they reached the barn on the unoccupied
| farm, where the murder occurred, and which
| contained large lot of straw, Marion says he
persuaded his mother to stop, saying they could
take little sleep, and be up again and on their
way by daylight.


The mother being weary, consented, and they
| entered the barn. Here Marion drew his pistol,
and shot his mother through the head. He then
| went to the wagon, where he had an ak secreted,
| and got the ak and commenced the work of
| butchcry. He says the shot killed his mother,
| but claimed it accidental, and that what fol
lowed was the result of his fear that he would
be arrested for murder In his effort to cut off
I, ~, IL ltolyC
woundng her in the shoulder and breast


Il then took her head and carried it out about
200 yards and threw it into the bushes. went
back, took off her clothes, put them in my
satchel, and then took the naked body and threw
it in the cistern. My father and brother were
at home, ard knew nothing about it.""


Only part of the womans clothing was found
in the satchel. Marion told the mob that he had
buried the balance hearth bridge between Troy
and Tell City. They have not yet been found.
Marion was man fully six feet high, and stoutly
built and could have handled the mothers body
| without help.


1t is nearly certain that the youngest son,
! Thomas, had no knowledge of the diabolical
scheme of his brother to murder his mother and
there is a growing sentiment that the husband
and father had nothing to do with the awful
crime. Both the father and Thomas state most
positively that the father did not leave his
home till o'clock the day after the murder
Many believe, had he not been arrested on
Thursday, that Marion would have added to his





his brother Thomas, SO as to come into posses
! sion of the entire property.

| was clearly demonstrated A discussion

| presbyterial societies was opened by Mrs. Judge
Bonner, Of Greensburg at the conclusion of
which an adjournment was made until afternoon.


The afternoon session was opened with the
usual exercises, followed by an address by Mrs.

work ""Among the Indians"" and ''Our Work

spectyely by Mrs. r. w Miers of Bloomington,

splendidly written, showing very clearly the alb
solute necessity Of more vigorous work amo ng
these people Viewing it in their light the
tinction of the Indian race only be prevented,
and the suppression of polygamy affected only
by bringing to bear proper religious influences.
Mrs A. Y. Moore of Logansport spoke for a

has for some years been president aud

prosperous organization composed OF
several Newark capitalists.


From what can be learned at this
writing, the Newark Brick Company has
made an assignment to the National Bank
OF Newark, comprising kiln of new
bricks, real estate and all the accessories
of finely appointed yard. The failure
Of the brick company brought with ii
complete surprise, as no one ever thought
financial embarrassment possible. 1t is
generally conceded that the assets wlI
cover the liabilities of the company


The company recently took the CON
tract for grading three of the railroad
sections lately deserted by John Gray.
These sections are just back OF town and
| extend over two miles eastward to Har
mony mills. 1t ia supposed that Jnhn
son had foraseen the utter impossibiity
of completing these sections with any
profit TO himself and has consequently
sbscOnded.


The Nawark Bank cashsd him L check
for 81 700 yesterday morning and he i'n
med,s.eiy deoamped. A friend OF Mr..
Johnson stated to your correspondent las,
-vening that he had received dispatch
from johnson yesterday afternoon to the
effect that he would not return. The
laborers employed under him have beau
lef, unpaid and they threaten immediate
lynching should he return.

 FROM ALL QUARTERS. SWEPT OFF BY DEATH. One Hundred and Fifty Miners Killed

 IN A G0LLIERY EXPLOSION. Fire Adds To the Horrors of Death.

 FiIZJOHN PORTER REINSTATED Put Back Om the Retired List.

THE SOUTH.

Virginia.",,"LYNoHBURa, March 13.-A few minutes past midnight this morning the village grouped around the mines at ePocahontas, Tayewell county, was startled by terrific explosion which shook every foundation and aroused the sleeping families of the 15O miners constituting the night force working undergrou nd. The terrible sound was sufi cient to inform everyone that a calamity had befallen the midnight lahorers. In an instant screaming women, children and men, all rushing for the mouth of the principal mine on the southern suburbs. Here dense volume of smeke was found pouring from the shaft and scattered around within 8 radius of quarter of mile were broken timbers, shattered cars, pulleys and machinery on all sides. For more than an hour wild and the louder manifesto tions of grief from desperate men filled the air. No one seemed to have any idea of what should be done and all rushed here and there frantically seeking for some evidence of the fate of relatives below. At a more than ordinary shriek of an guish would tell that some searching party had found 8 token which realized his or her worst fears. The scene was terrible in the extreme. Houses, buildings and trees several hundred yards away were completely torn to pieces. showing that the force of the explosion must have been terrific. It was not until two hours had passed that any effort was made by the panic stricken crowd to ascertain the condition of affairs. Then 8 ghastly faced man with 8 blanket thrown around his shoulders sprang on stump and cried, ''We all have friends and relatives below and perhaps we can help them"" There was then hurried movement toward the mouth of the mine and led by the man in the blanket and amid the shrieking of frantic women, some of whom plead with the men to remain out of danger, the little band disappeared in the gloom and smoke around the mouth of the mine. They soon reappesred, however, and it was announced that all attempts to get in to the men were fruitless. A dense volume of smoke soon con- menced to shoot upwards and illuminated the scene for a half mile, rendering the ghsstly spectacle, which had heretofore been NACW0O OLAy ny tOAOAAABAG3 LCA S4hCo HUI Q impressive. The crowd had gathered help less in little groups, others discussing the situation or lamenting the death of some loved one. It was agreed that the explosion had taken place at Flat Top mine and had been caused by fire damp. The situa- tion remained unchanged until day. break, when the horrors of the scene became glaringly apparent. The men who still retained their composure com. menced to gather the fragments of humanity scattered about. These were evidently the limbs of those miners who had been working near the bottom of the shaft at the time oi the accident and were blown upwards. Not one of these. numbering about fifty, sur. vived. When the sun had risen. the inhabitants of the village for the first time commenced to think of appealing to the outside world fol aid. Telegrams were sent right and left ii every direction, but it was not until noon that aid reached them from Lynchburgh anG the villages nearer. All the morning mer from the surrounding country came pouring in, having been attracted by the great volume

 of smoke arising. The hunters in the noun

 tains were numerous among the body and

 invaluable in aiding the panic stricken fam

 flies. The greater part of the victims ars

 known to be Italians and Germans, ant

 such is the confusion and terrol

 manifested on all sides that the names of tht

 victims could not be asoertained except in {

 few lnstancee. A party of miners from tn!

 Coal Field mines under Colonel George

 Dodds arrived during the afternoon and tooA

 charge of the camp. The residents were compelled to retire from the vicinity of the

 mine and the newcomers then gathered th.

 fragments of humanity and plaeed them 1T

 adjoining houses The collection was g

 ahastly one and the fifteen hundred population remaining above ground

 seemed to have lost all reason

 There YVES not one in the crowd but lost

 relative, and all seemed to have lost all hopt

 of ever seeing any of their dear ones alive

 Young girls dashed around aimlessly, man! of them coVered with blood stains secured in their ghastly search. Men sat on logs ol lay prostrate on the ground staring stolidly | terrible mental strain. About every hal

 hour body of men would proceed to tht

 mouth of the mine and make an effort tt | force sn entrance. Again and again thu great pail of smoke and the bursting flames 1 from below would force them back and somt or them WouIo pc poTno nAl1 1aintlnB lnIt l the fresh air.

 Tonight at o'clock it was thought ar | entrance could be made as the smoke showed signs of decreasing. A party of men at 1 tempted to go down, when volume of fam, shof up and they were hurriedly aided to th'

 surface. One of the number, an Italian pamed Carlo Ersnchi, was missing and hat evidently dropped from the cage. All of thu

 party were badly burned and this showet hou frnisIesa were any hopes oi

 rescue. The shaft at g p. m. wa

 a roarine funnel of flame. All the out

 buildings in the vicinity ignited and the fan

 house, which had been looked to as the sal

 vation ef any of the men who might b. | alive below, caught fire also. A 'shriek O l dsspsir vent tip again at this catastrophe

 which was regarded as fatal to all hopeg o

 rescue. Tie Eae1 fought mahfplly Ia save the building, but withou

 avail and 1t was soon mas 1 of cinders It became evident at this hou

 that the whole mine was sblaze and it i doubtful whether it can be extinguished fo l weeks if at all, This settles the fate of tn,

 one hundred and fifty unfortunates be low ground and they have absolutely n | chance for life Not thb least distressinl | 6hasS of the calamity is the fact that all fam | flies of-ths dead will be utterly homeless il the wild mountain region.

1882, was bright and clear. Perry
walked up and down. the road
which ran past his deserted
home in gloomy meditation. AT
last muttering to himself that he
must at least see his wife once
more, he started out for the Price
residence. When he approached
the house his father-in-law, as if
waiting for him, was standing at
the front door with shotgun AS
soon as he recognised who was
coming he commanded him to de-
sist. Perry continued to advance.
Qalck as thought Mr.. Price
brought his gun to his shoulder
and fred. Perry fell with groan
and by the time the inmates of the
house had rushed to him he was
dead. Standing in low
ing attitude, looking, at the dead
man, was the guilty wife and her
paramour. The crime created an
unbounded sensation. The posi-
ton OF the families, the scapda-
lous connivance Of father and
mother with their daughters
shame, the age and Venerable ap-
pearance Of the murderer, all con
spired to give interest to the trag-
edy,


CONVICTED AND SENTENCED


to death. Price was arrested and
tried before the March term, 1882,
of johnson Superior Court. He
had among his counsel some of
the most eminent lawyers of the
State. He entered upon his trial
surrounded by his four brothers.
The appearance Of the five men,
with their flowing white boards
was most striking The proof on
all points was clear and conclusive.
The prisoner sat looking to the
evidence with the utmost indiffer-
ence. Only once did he change
countenance. When the suit of
clothes in which his son-in-law
was murdered, besmeared with
blood, was held up before the jury,
Price looked upon tia moment,
and then turned away his face
with sickening smile. The case
given to the jury, he was speedily
found guilty and sentenced to
death. An appeal on points of
law was taken to the Supreme
Court, where decision of the court
below was affirmed. On the ODD
OF September he was taken from
Sendersville jail, where he had
been confined, to Johnson county,
to be resentenced. As there had
been rumors of a plot to capture
Price, whether for the purpose Of
rescue or of lynching, was uncer-
tain, a heavy guard accompanied
him across the country. He was
accordingly sentenced to be execut-
ed on Friday, the l4th day OF No
vember, 1884. During the last
few days an effort has been inaug-
urated to induce the Governor to
commute the sentence Of the un-
fortunate man to Imprisonment for
life. Petitions to that effect are
being numerously signed.


THE SEQUEL OF THE TRAGEDY.


Mrs. Perry, the beautiful child
bride of two y ears ago, is now a
coarse looking woman of large
build and unpleasant face. In
dictments for unlawful cohabita
ton were found against her and
her paramour, Mandal Powell.
Nosooner had the Judge pronounc-
ed sentence of death against the
father for the murder Of his SON
in-law, than the case of the State
against Mandal Powell for fornica-
ton was called. The guilty wretch
whose crime has laid hus-
band in the grave, dishonored a
wife and brought and old man to
the gallows, taking adyantange of
the provision OF law which per
mits the settlement of such cases
by marriage, announced that Mrs.
Perry and he were prepared to
become man and wife. They were
ordered to stand up IN court, and
with the convicted father as the
principal witness, the faithless wife
of Perry became the wife of
Powell.

CHICAGO, June 5.-It was ifty-three min utes after ten this morning when Chairman Henderson arose and dropped his gavel, the buzz of conversation died away, the band ceased playing and the Republican national convention entered on it's third day. Rev. Dr. Fellows, of Chicago, in 8 ten minutes prayer reviewed the country from the time of the Revolution, and thanked the Lord for all he had done for the Republican party during every decade. He ended his prayer by asking that the party be saved from the results of error, pride and ignorance. Heads were then raised, and the gavel again fell at 11:07. The convention then settled down to the business of the day. MT. Ballard, of Vermont. presented the

 REPORT OF THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE to the effect that the sitting members in all the contested cases are entitled to their seats, except in the case of the Nineteenth district of New York and the Fifth district of Ken lucky, where both delegates and contestants are admitted, to cast half vote each. In the Virginia cases the committee found unan- imously that the delegation headed by sena. tor Malone was entitled to the seats The report was adopted without discussion. MT. Marks, of California, then presented the

 REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES,

 which showed that the committee had adopt ad l1ufo hn ruYo oSk kho tion, except that it recommended the adop. ton of Cushing's manual as the parliamentary law of the body instead of the rules of the House of Representatives, saying that the previous question is to be in force as in the House. Mir. Grow, of Pennsylvania, from the minority o& the committee, offered sub stitute for the tenth rule, which prescribes the mode of electing delegates to the next national Republican convention. He pro- poses that delegates shall be elected in the same manner as members of Congress. MT Parks accepted the proposed amendment, MT. Grow having explained that the dele gstes-at large are to be elected by State con- ventions and that the manner of the election of delegates from the District of Columbia lican committee. The rules were then adopted.

 THE PROPOSED NEW PLAN OF DETERMINATION in future national conventions then came up. On this two reports were presented. Mr. Parks, of California, for tue majority report ed that each State shall be entitled to four delegates-at-large, with two additional dele gates for each member of Congress at large (if any); that each territory and the District of Columbia shall be entitled to two dele gates, and that each Congressional district shall be entitled to two delegates. Mir Bishop, of Massachusetts, on behalf of the minority of the committee, reported rule that each State shall be entitled to four dele gates-at-large and one, additional delegate for each representative-at-large eff anyl; that each Territory and the District of Columbia shall be entitled to two delegates that each Congressional district shall be entitled to one delegate and to an additional delegate for ev- cry ten thousand majority of votes or frao- tion thereof cast for the Republican presidential electoral ticket at the last pre- csding presidential election and that the Republican National committee shall within a year after each presidential election certify the representation to which each State is en- titled. Messrs Bradley of Kentucky, Lynch of Mississippi, Townsend of New York, West of Ohio, Long of Massachusetts, Filley of Missouri, O'Hara of North Carolina and Clay of Arkansas spoke for the majority report, and MT.

A magnificent floral l helmet surmouuted by 6 white plume was hoisted on a pole in front of the stage and the token aided in maintaining the enthu- siasm. 4 card on the helmet bore the in- soription ""The ladies of Ohio send greetings I to the plumed knight May the heaven smile upon the champion of the nation that above nations champions and respects the cause of i women"" The cheering continued for a 1 long period and was renewed when the speaker concluded. Ex-Governor Davis of Minnesota. MT. Grow of Pennsylvania and Mir. Platt of New York supported Blaine's nomination in eloquent speeches. The crowd, however, gave evidences that 1t was tired of talk and both Grow and Platt were frequently met by ironical applause and cries of ''We want ballot tonight"" -.fs et.., WHEN NEW YORK WAS CALLED

 the demonstration equalled that accorded speaker-Ar. Townsend-however,s soon lost the sympathies of large portion of his hear CTS by the tenor of his references to Messrs. Conkling and Platt and at one time the yelIs and hisses lasted for two minutes. This so incensed the speaker that in stentorian tones he shouted that he would speak his mind if It was the last act of his life. Townsend's concluding remarks were almost lost in the disorder that prevailed, but the tenn perate and withal powerful speech of Con- gressmau Bingham, of Pennsylvania, in seconding the nomination once more put the audience in good humor. Bingham eulopized the presidential career of the man who, four years ago unknown, was to-day the best known man in the world and of whom all men say: ''Well done good and faithful servant. D MT.

 AROSE TO SPEAK FOR SHERMAN.

 There was no incident of note until he said no man had greater admiration for Blaine than he, when the convention again broke into confusion which lasted for seventeen minutes, during which the helmet and plume were carried out of the hall MT. Foraker in his speech said if noise could nominate or elect Q candidate as President of the United States he would not take the stand But in view of the fact that such demonstrations do not elect he was emboldened to appear in be- half of very humble but very great man {cheers). Ohio was Republican State and would cast her electoral vote for the nomi nee of this convention. He was not present to ask anything therefore for Ohio 8 condi- ton precedent Let her do what she may in of years, she was ever ready to do her part ia the presidential year, and as 8 man to sweep the country he nominated John Sher- man.

When Edmunds' name was mentioned the convention was liberal in applause. George William Curtis seconded Edmunds' nomina- tion in his usual clear cut, incisive manner.

 WHEN MR. CURTIS HAD CONCLUDED at 1905 a. m., MT. Foraker moved to proceed to ballot and after debate the secretary called the roll of States. When Maine was reached large majority of the votes were for ad- journment. New York voted 29 in fa- vor and 43 against adjournment. When New Hampshire was reached the vote stood yeas 253 nays 341.

 Demand was made tat the roll of the New York delegation be called under the rules. It was granted. The tactics are changed and the Blaine men are voting to adjourn, the Arthur and Edmunds men to proceed. New York on the roll call voted 27 for adjourn ment and Al against.

 

 Mr. Fisher challenged the count and de- manded the calling of the roll, which was proceeded with.

The 925 gas jets shed their rays over the immense gathering and the dia- monds and silks of the thousand or more ladies on the stage and in the galleries sparkled and glistened responsiveiy. The Kansas delegation marched from the Palmer House to the hall led by band and followed by thousands of people shouting and cheer ing for Bisiae. They carried sn immense banner surmountsd with shocks of wheat and tassels of corn bearing the inscription ''Kansas will give 5O,O0O majority for the nominee,

The civil rights suit brought by
Chas. G. Edwards,a colored man from
Baltimore, against the proprietors of
Guvernator's and Matters concert
gardens, took another turn to day,
when three we'll known ice cream
dealers were summoned before Judge
Irving on a similar charge The

judge deciding that the new law does
not cover cases of this kind. The
suits against Guvernator and Natter
will come up for trial at the circuit

on September 9. Edwards has en-.
gagged ex-senator Robson as his
counsel, and expresses his determina-

long to the frontier, where society is not Or
ganized. They are foreign to Indiana and
Ohio They have been forced upon the peo
pie and are not sought by them. The security
of life, of property, and the home are the three
points about which the sanctions of conscience
arrange themselves. Men have stood for
these principles until the moral sense has be-
come strong enough to guard men
against assassination, until fine sense of
honesty has grown up in the race, until the
security of family relations has been assured.
Woe to the community, to the city, to the
judge, attorney or jury that does not uphold
them. The puplic conscience is a terrible
thing to trife with.


The significant fact in the Cincinnati troub-
les is that ten thousand law-abiding and
peaceful citizens were compelled
to assemble and denounce the
processes of their criminal courts. That the
temple of justice, with its musty library, the
cardinal teachings of which had been ignored
or warped in the interests of thieves, murder
ers and corrupters of homes, was destroyed, is
a secondary matter. Cincinnati is a typical
American city. There are no more or other
elements of corruption there nor in greater
proportion, than in a score of American cities.
The conditions for discord and riot were pres
ent and have matured, as they may in other
cities which do not take warning by her ex
ample. Whatsoever men SOW that shall they
reap, and if we sow iniquity we shall reap
vanity These sayings report the results of
the worlds moral economy, and are as true
to-day as in the days of Paul and Solomon.
In spite of all precept and teaching, the moral
sense is still in the rough, and conscience,
which is growth, not fully de-
veloped. There are all kinds in Gin
cinnati as in Indianapolis as
in London, as in every community, as in the
human heart. There is no homogeneity, no
perfection; but there is an ideal, moral ten
dency in society, surging toward the right,
as with armies in battle.


In every community are men who are lead
ers, wise and considerate, having all at heart.
Then there are the masses who, under tie in
fuence of superior will and ideas, keep their
places and do their duty in homes and as citi-
zens, like the soldiers in an army These con-
sttute the element in Cincinnati whose moral
sense has been offended and to whom we look
in this democratic nation for redress of in
juries from whatever quarter Beside these,
we have the wolves and hyenas, the element
of the commune, who have, in most cases. no
homes, no property, no strong hold on life,
and, therefore, little respect for these things.
This is the class that, not having moral sense,
must be restrained by the law-indeed for
them the law is made and administered
These classes are not well Defined
yet they exist in every city, and
not until the education OF conscience"

Nov. as there are two very different modes of toasting individuals and collective bodies, this silence IS omnibus. For instance, the conmittee migh, nave said '' The Judiciary, the protectors and defenders of the cons.i.n- ton. the dispersors of equal justice be- tween suitors, a terror to evil doers, the shield of the innocent, and the safe guard Of society"" or on the other hand they might have said, The Judiciary, the Actions, forms, ceremonies and techni- cslities, with which they have clothed the administration of justice, has licensed crime, rendered life and property inse- cure, defeated the attainment of justice between private parties, and left society without other protection than mob vio- lence and lynch law""

 You see how differcn, the two modes of toasting are. On this occasion, with out paying any money for the privilege. VIC can take our choice.

 have no prejudice against judges. think they are entitled to the same rights as ether accused persons. and are pre- sumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved. Judges belong to very ancient order, and spring from very re- spectahle source. In ancien, times, in all countries, the office of judge, and the profession of medicine as well, were an- nexed 10 the priesthood.

 There were no judges as such no physicians ss such-but there was the priest to whose sacred office the duties of judge and physician were annexed as mere incidents The addition of these temporal or secular duties to the priestly office grew naturally out of the faith of the adherents to all religions in early times.

 Men believed tha, all their diseases were inflicted by the immediate dis pleasure of the Deity, and, therefore, very naturally concluded that no one could be of 90 much service to them as those who were particularly employed in His scrviee, and believing the priests to be in direct communication with the eternal throne of wisdom and justice 1t seemed obvious that they were the only persons compe- tent to administer justice and whose judgments would be righteous alto gexher."" The judgment of the priest was clothed with sanction greater than hu- man power could confer. It proceeded from . divine source, and was not the judgment of an ering man.

 The priest, as a doctor, resorted to magic and incantation, and as a judge a6ected to speak by divine authority.

 Whether 1t was because the priests made poor doctors or the doctors poor priests, know not, bat for sopae sui hcient cause, the practice of medicine vas divorced from the priestly office. The divorce has proved beneficial to priest and doctor alike, and the public as we'll. The priest in the exercise of his spiritual office, and the doctor in the practice of his profession, meet at the bedside ot the sick and the dying, each better qualified for his duties than either could be to discharge the duties of both The lawyer and the doctor are still agreed on one point of practice their customers. The administration of civil and criminal justice is no longer committed to the priesthas&, A&i the pEetense that the judge is divinely in spired in pEonouncing his judgment is abandcned.

 The divorce between the off -es of priest and judge is not difficult to account for. lt is not recorded that the priests made particularly bad judges; and they were probably not deprived of their offics of judge on that account.

 The most reasonable and probable ac- coant ef the divorce is that they con- 6nusd to act as judges until law yen came into existence, and began Q pracfice before them. The poor piest soon found he could not suc- osssfary contend with :he devl and the lAWyers both, and that he must either gise ID his warfare on the devil and de- vuoe his whole time to the lawyers, or give up the lawyers and devote his ener- gies to Sasan, and having had experience vifh bod, be wisely concluded that his peace of mind would be promoted by giving up his ofsce of judge and thus get 6ng i'd of the lawyers. and sticking to Ais warfare on his Satznic majesty.

preceded it was that of man named |
Berner who had confessed that he had
participated in the murder of all old
man named Kirk for his money which
he divided with a negro named Palmer
on whom he laid the chief blame. In
the face of such testimony verdict of
manslaughter first shocked the Court
and then angered the community.
The courtroom audience freely ex-
pressed its dissatisfaction on the first
rendering of the verdict. For fear of
more emphatic demonstrations, the ju-
rors were hustled out by back way,
but the news Of their verdict had pre-
ceded them into the street and they
were obliged to run for their lives,
with any angry mob in pursuit.


This scene occurred on Monday
morning of last week, and for days
Cincinpati was in a tumult which cul-
minated in the disgraceful riot and
bloodsAed of Friday and Saturday
nights. The local press reflected and
stimulated the general dissatisfac ton
of the community. One paper spoke of
Berner's acquittal as evidence of the in
ability or indisposition on the part of
the authorities to punish crime in Gin
cippati. THE Berner trial farce"" it

 tInued PrOsperfty-A Surprise To,

 Faithful WOrker-The Election of

 Officers.

 The annual convention of the Catholic Total Abstinence union of Connecticut was held yesterday in Irving Hall, Waterbury. Forty-seven societies were represented and sixty-ive or seventy delegates beside the State officers. The delegates on arriving quartered at the Scoyille House, Smiths Ho- tel and other places. The Catholic clergy of the city were present, Rev. Fathers Duggan, Harty, Donohoe, O'Donnell and Curtin The delegates attended mass in 6 body at the Church of the Immaculate Conception at 9 g. m Father Harty's address at mass was very eloquent. He said: You are doing Gods work and cordially and sincerely ex- tend to you warm welcome from the house of God before you begin your deliberations. The church will take 8 deep interest in your work at the convention because it is intended to suppress an evil which is an obstacle to the salvation of souls. He hoped their in- fuence would be felt while they remained in the city. The traffic has grown in Water bury to an alarming extent We pay be- tween S19, 900 and $20,OO year for the privilege of selling distilled and fernented liquors, the sale of which costs in round numbers the sum of $70O,OOO annually. Some time ago it was great dis grace for man to be seen drunk but now adays women and even small children arc addicted to the use of strong drink. As an instance of the crime caused in that city by the use of strong drink he cited the fact that it cost about $17,000 annually to run the police court. Nor did it's evil effects end there. It was making further inroads into society. A great man had said some time ago that universal suffrage was a sham while rum ruled the large cities. He hoped there would be even 8 stricter guard upon the Sun day laws and the law which prohibits the sale of drink to minors.

 : From the church the delegates went to Irv was called to order by the president, the Rev. Joseph w Zones, of Thomaston, whose re- port for the past year was the first thing in order.

 The societies had not been active, he said in raising the necessary funds for campaign purposes, and consequently the promised temperance rallies had not been given by the union. He said nothing so promoted the cause of temperance as the public meeting, as it is by agitation that the good work is &C., compEshed. He urged hearty cooperation with the clergy as the best means for the suc cess of the societies in the different towns. He briefly stated disadvantages derived from such cooperation and the disadvantage of an opposite course. The presidents report stated that at the convention held at Middle town September 18th last year there were 43 societies in the union with @ membership of 2, ,437; since then there had been an actual gain of 489 members, making total Il ow of 2,926 members. The societies which were admitted last year were St. Joseph's T. A. and B. society, of Willimantic, St. Patrick's cadets of New Haven, St. Joseph's Y. M. T. A. andB society of Thomaston, and St. Patrick's T. A. and B. society of Tariffville

felled him to the ground. He was unconscious
when the youthful murderers jumped upon his
PROSTATE form and began their bloody work.
Snyder held the head of the victim while Ander-
son sat astride the body, and with very dull
pocket knife cut his throat from ear to ear.
The first ncision of the knife had the effect to
revive the victim, who in an in
stant realized his awful position.
Vainly he cried for mercy, piteously begging
the young butchers to spare his life. He
struggled desperately for an instant with al
most superhuman strength, to free himself, but
he was overmatched, and was soon rendered
powerless through the loss of blood, which
flowed in streams from the CHASTITY cash in his
throat. The work of murder almost accom-
plshed the young demons then turned their
attention to securing the money and any valu-
ables to be found upon their victims person.
In order to cover up the traces of their bloody
work, they dragged the body to the river and,
before life entirely extinct, threw it in, one
of them holding it with his foot beneath the
surface until the last sign of life had dsap-
peared. They then swan some distance from





that the swift current would carry it far beyond
thedanger of discovery by anyone who had known
the deceased in life.


THE DISCOVERY OF THE CRIME.


They then returned to town by circuitous
route On the way they hid the knife used to
perform the horrible work, and also the hat of
the victim. On the following Saturday evi-
dences of fearful struggle, in the shape of the
blood spots upon the weeds and ground,
were discovered by countryman
passing along the road Hurrying
on to Mount Vernon, he reported
the circumstance and his suspicious. Soon large
numbers of persons had collected at the spot in
dicated, and various theories, which ignored
murder, to account for the blood and the dis
turbed condition of the earth were advanced. 1t
was the general opinion, however, that q great
crime had been committed, and searching parties
were Immediately organized to scour the coun-
try III the nelghborhood and to drag the river.
The search was kept up until the following after
noon, when the body Of the murdered boy was
discovered. 1t was much swollen and discolored,
but was easily Unidentified.


The excitement among the citizens when this
result became known was intense and hundreds
OF persons OF both sexes and all ages visited the
undertaking establishment to view the remains.
Among the number were Anderson and Snyder,
neither of whom betrayed the least emotion





discussing with those about them the probable
motive of the crime. Both however from vari-
GUS circumstances, were suspected, and on Mon
day morning they were arrested and locked up.
Their arrest was SO sudden and unexpected that
they had arranged line of denial between
them, and as they were confined in different por-
tions of the jail, it an easy matter to obtain
a confession. Snyder was made to believe that
Anderson had told everything"" charging the
crime upon him (Snyder), and vice versa. Each
wishing to shield himself, accused the other.
By this means their guilt was established beyond
the shadow of a doubt But, to make assurance
dOubly sure, they were taken separately TO the
places where the knife and hat respectively
were concealed, and, without hesitation each
walked directly to where the damning evidences
of their guilt were hidden


At the preliminary examination, which oe-
CURED soon afterward in the face of his confess
sion Anderson pleaded not guilty on the ground
that he did not do the cutting' On the follow
ing day, however, he withdrew this plea, and,
with Snyder, entered plea of guilty They
were held without bail to await their trial at the
September term of the Circuit Court At the
trial an acquittal was asked for on plea of in
sanity, but it was, of course, not entertained for
a second. The trial was brief, and the Jury
promptly returned verdict of guilty and Judge
w. F. Parrett pronounced the sentence of
death, and named to-day the time for the exc
cution. Executive clemency was invoked in
vain.


From the day of the arrest Snyder was APP
parently full of penitence, frequently closing his
conversations with those who visited the Jail.
sobbing and moaning like child Anderson,
on the contrary, at first was very defiant, and
showed his Indifference by dancing and singing
in his cell and making clown of himself gener-
ally. But he became more subdued as the time
for the execution approached, and within the
past few days frequently expressed his regret at
the crime. Public sentiment from the first was
strongly against them, and lynchng was fire.

law would be allowed to take its course and that
the crime would be punished, spared Mount
Vernon the threatened disgrace,


Zacariah Snyder was born in Mt Vernon, and
and twenty-one years of age, being four
years older than the boy he helped to kill His
parents were poor and illiterate, and his father
during the late years of his life was hard
drinker and generally worthless He did odd
jobs about town, but nothing steadily and moth

simple minded, good -natured woman, who has
the respect of all who know her. ''Zack,"" as
the boy was familiarly called, was a shiftless,
idle fellow, but had never been regarded as mean
or vicious; in fact, he was generally looked upon
as kind hearted and inoffensive though his asso-
ciates We're for the most part, hard cases""


John Anderson was also born in Mt. Vernon
and was about the age of Van Wyer. He was

In his forehead and that afterward his
own pistol was taken from his pocket

work. When found his hands were
stretched out at full length by his side

The citizens closed in upon them, and the fighting becoming so warm, Taggert proposed t9 surrender. Deputy Sheriff Hall then ordered him to throw up hls hands and come out of the brush, the sheriff keeping him covered with hls gun while he ap- preached; Charles M. Shannon searched his person for arms, and finding none, was informed by Taggert that his pis- tol was in the brush, with all the loads discharged, which was the reason of his surrender.

M., who, if discovered, should be lynched for assisting a murderer to escape.

 Upon discovering that Joseph N. Laffer, one of the citizens in pursuit, had been killed, it was determined by his comrades to at once dispose of Lee and Taggert, which was done by hanging them to tree. The four bodies were placed in a wagon and carried to Silver City, and became the indiyided property of the coroner, who, having no use for them, gener- ously presented them to the grave digger, and who, in turn, gave them as food for worms. The life of Spen- cer was spared for the reason that, upon an examination of his gun, no shot had been fired by him. He was returned to his quarters in the jail. Those who pursued and engaged in the killing, are entitled to the warm est commendation, and are receiving it upon every hand.

 The escape was effected by over towering the guards and locking them in the cells. The guards guns afforded the means of resistance."

 SANTA FE, March 13.-Gov. Sheldon to-day received telegram from the governor of Montana announcing the capture at Helena of the noted New Mexico desperate known as Tom Bowe. Wm. Steele of Helena was appointed by Gov. Sheldon as territorial agent to escort Bowe to New Mexico and de- liver him into the hands of the Grant county authorities. It is thought he will be lynched on arrival. Bowe went to Silver City from Arizona in 1874 ill company with two men named Hart and Phillips, both of whom were murderers. The trio had just robbed stage in Arizona and rob bed a man named Sam Bullock of $1,60O.* A month after their arrival Bowe killed man named Jack Clark over faro table in Wards dance hall, and skipped for the mountains. He brought up at Lime Kiln. Sheriff Whitehill and a posse of four trailed him down and took him in about 3 o'clock in the morning. He was given a hearing be- fore a justice and was cleared. In September, 1877, he killed one ofSilver City's wealthiest citizens--Dick How lett-over game of poker, in Geo. Spears saloon, and made his escape to Mexico. Thence he went to California and Montana, and finally showed up in New York, where he remained short time, and again returned to Montana, where he was going under the name of Pat Delaney.

 Rewards were offered for his capture as follows: By the territory $500; by the citizens of Silver City, $450; by Howlett's estate, $500; by Charles Hewlett, brother of the murdered man, $200--making a total reward o$1 ,650 Detective Edward Connors of Lords burg is the man who effected his cap ture. Bowe also killed a man in Pueblo, Col, and was run out of Santa Fe for attempting to run the town with shotgun.

Sunday morning, surrendered their
guns and keys and the work was
finished in few minutes. This it
was that brought the large crowd of
people into the village on Monday.
They were anxious, or at least curl
Gus, to learn the particulars and see
what action the Circuit Judge would
take and what he would have to say
about the work of the mob when he
came TO impannel aud charge the
Grand Jury. The court did nothing
on Monday and gave only . brief
charge to the Grand Jury, making
no reference whatever to the pro-
ceedings of Judge Lynch.


1t was a highly injurious piece
Of wantonness and is quite general
ly so regarded, for white men thus to
resort to mob violence and hang
four negroes on the day before the
assemblage of the Circuit court
which was to have tried them. To
say that four negroes in Jail in a
white Democratic county, with a
Democratic Circuit Judge, District
Attorney, Clerks, Sheriff, Grand
and petit juries-aU Democratic
couldn't have a fair trial, and that
it was necessary that a mob should
anticipate a court of justice-will
sound badly even in our own State,
and much more so abroad,


The cases of Dan and Brown Sui
livan, indicted for the murder of
Freeman in Jefferson county last
Summer and brought to this county
by a change Of venue, are set for
trial on next Monday. This is
likely to be the only interesting
feature of the term.


Should this meet the eyes of
Mr.. Yellowly and Mr.. Bailey, We
say, come again, young men, for
your presence here on Monday
awoke among many Of us memories
of other days, when vulgarity and
bullyism on the stump were almost
unknown. Come again, young
men; but let the Major go else
where. There is no filth here for
for his shovel. Yours,

 DENVER, Jaz1. 27.-The inquest on the bodies of the miners who lost their lives Thursday in the explosion at the Colorado Goal and Iron company's mine at Crested Butte began yesterday. The most important testimony given was that of Fire Boss Rich ardson, who testified that on the morning of the accident he had found two boards broken from the brattiee in room Is, second entry, and considerable gas in the head of the drift, and had given the man who was to work in there positive orders not to enter until he re- turned and repaired the brattice. He came out to get tools.' Before he got back the ex- plosion occurred. Superintendent Robbins explained the workings of the mine, and said he had given positise orders that no miner should go in the mine without having received a report from the fire boss, so as to know positively there was no danger from gas. and when gas was found safety lamps were always insisted on.

 Twenty-three more burned bodies were yesterday recovered from the mine, making 6fty-seven in all. Those recovered were ali IOunO 1Q cuhmDor NO. z ana 1n a paSSag9Way in the immediate vicinity. Many have arms and legs broken, skulls crushed in and cloth- ing so burned in many cases that it drops of in rags when the body is moved. The hair, too, is burned from their heads. The skin is burned of the faces and other exposed psr- tions of the bodies, leaving an unrecogniza

 besides the erection of the building spoken of, will bear all funeral expenses and make ample provisions for the needy families of the deceased.

 The inquest was continued until midnight when an adjournment was taken until Mon day. The evidence showed that the air pro- vided was five to six times the quantity re- quired by law and that the explosion occur red while the brattice of chamber IS, which was full of gas, was being repaired. The two remaining bodies, making 8 total of fifty

 nine, were brought up to-day. Both pre- scented ghastly sight. The frame building for funeral services, on which forty men had been working for two days, was completed early this morning and the bodies placed in 1t. No date has been fixed for the funeral. There has been no renewal of the excitement, although fears are ex pressed that an attempt may be made to lynch Mine Boss Gibson."

ored for his personal worth and gener-
Gus and affectionate nature. The cas-

lessness is not corrective of lawlessness.
In the eyes of the law, that upon which
with all its faults communities have to de-
pend for safety and existence, lynching is
murder and nothing else. The law is ex-
pensive and often tails to do and promote
justice; but the attempt to enforce lynch
law in this one instance in Cincinnati will
cost the city far more than the administra-
ton of her courts for a long period. and
its woful want of efficiency to execute
Justice is witnessed In the fact that Berner
still lives while scores of innocent people
have been shot dead in the streets OF Gin
cinnati, and hundreds of others have been
wounded and MANNED for life.


There is safe and sure remedy for the
evils in regard to the courts of which
there is complaint in Cincinnati. 1t is
peaceful but effective. 1t is in the hands
of the people of the city. They must
hunt out corruption in their courts and
drive it out in the manner prescribed by
law. Failing to do that they are false to
duty, and if riot comes in consequence
the responsibility as well as the loss,
shame and suffering is legitimately theirs."

atrocious scenes of lawlessness ever wit
messed in this country. For about two
days and as many nights her streets were
pandemonium. only the power of the
military availiug to check the incendiary's
torch or prevent great destruction of
human life.


The immediate cause of the riot is found
in the lax or partial administration of JUS
tice by the courts in the case of Berner. of
whom our dispatches have given an ac-
count. He and another person were tried
for murder. Both were alike guilty. but
while the other man was convicted OF
murder and sentenced to be hung, Berner.
through the influence of friends and cor
rupt means. was convicted only of man.
slaughter and sentenced to confinement in
the State Prison for q term of twenty
years. The best people of the city were
Justly incensed at the result in Berner's
case. Public sentiment ran high against
the court and the murderer. A meeting
of the citizens was called to take action
against the outrage. Ii is not probable
that many of those who endorsed the hold
ing of the meeting had any thought of
countenancing lawless measures to coun-
teract the action of the court. but the mad
ness of the hour prevailed. moderate and
prudent advice was disregarded, and the
meeting proved but hotbed for the
growth of the spirit of lawless destruction
that soon overspread the city. crimsoned
its streets with blood. and laid in ashes
some OF its finest public buildings.


Now that the riot is over. there is prob
ably not man of intelligence and sobrie-
ty in the city who does not regret that an
attempt was made by brute force and law
lessness to seize Berner and hang HIM, as
corrective for the corrupt. partial, un
just course of the court that tried him.
The case was outrageous. exasperating.
But the attempted remedy was worse. The
setting aside OF justice through the courts
by corrupt means deserves the severest
punishment, and is a proper subject to
stir up the righteous indignation of the
populace; but lynch law is no law. is the
handmade of riot and anarchy. the instiga.

Mr.. Jones, the permanent chairman, made
happy and modest address, saying that he
had many misgivIngs Of his ability to per-
form the duties involved satisfactorily, and
asking the full benefit of the superior juds-
ment, energy and experience of the commit
tee. Referring to Blaine, he said: 1t was
my good fortune to have known him init
mately for over thirty years. l have watched
his career during that time with unusual in
terest. and 1 have never known any one to
be actuated by purer motives or governed by
a higher standard of morals. HIS lofty pat
riotism and splendid abilities are recognized
aud acknowledged everywhere. He is al
ways on the American side of every question.
These virtues and accomplishments account
for his wonderful magnetism and for his
nearness to the American heart. The
speaker said the Democratic party must be
held TO its record of free trade and tariff for
revenue only. After alluding to Logan's
splendid record, he said In conclusion:
With such candidates and such principles as
are set forth in our platform, success Is as
sured, aud victory will be ours in November
as surely as the sun will bless us with its
light.

submit to his Infamous desires. He
was released on bonds and started for
home As he was stepping into the
buggy his son drew revolver and fired
five shots, all Of which missed the un-
natural parent. The excitement was so
grea. that his sureties withdrew from

An Overdose or Morphine.


PORTLAND, Ogn., April H.-A. G.
Flurrey, of Lagrange, Oregon, who
came here to attend the blooded horse
sale, was this morning found dead in
bed at the Quimby House. 1t is sup.
posed he committed suicide with NOR
phine, as an empty bottle that had con-
tanned that drug was found in his coat
pocket. The coroner's jury rendered a
verdict of death by his own hand, but
inclined to the belief that in his desire
to produce sleep, an overdose of the
drug had been taken. Flurrey killed q
man named Dudley, in Tacoma, eleven
years ago, for which he was sentenced
to fourteen years in the penitentiary,
but after serving four years he was par
doned. Since that time he has had no
peaceful sleep without drugs, remorse
seeming 10 prey on his mind. Deceased
was aged forty five years.

 SHERIFF J. l.. WARD.

 This efficient officer has been bothered by your correspondent all day. His equanimity of temper IS astonishing. In reply to inquiries he stated that after their sentence, the prisoners had been furnished with extra rRtiOns. Besides receiving the usual food allowed the county prisoners they have been sup piled with fruits, cigars and liquors the latter, of course, not to supertuty. Their allowance Ill this respect was three drinks of whisky per day. The only complaint they have ever made of him is that he covered them with too many irons. This was merely a security he was bound to adhere to. To-day he purchased for each of the doomed five, n broadclOth suit and white shirts burial garments. He Is bothered con tinuany by applicants for passes to the ilil yard. and at three o'clock all the cards printed had been disposed of, num- beriug a thousand. If closely racked the jail yard wlll hold LAO people.

 rHE PRISONERS INTERVIEWED.

 Shortly after noon today, the CITIZEN man called upon the sheriff and asked the privilege of interviewing the uOtor- ious prisoners. The courteous official answered.:

 Why, certainly, but it IS of no use. They won't speak to reporters. You will not get word out of them""

 Well. let me try, please, urged the reporter.

 A knock on tbe outer iron girdled door brought the question, Who IS there ?"" The reply, Ward"" caused the inner door in the same cell to open an inch. The eye of a keeper peeped through. Recognizing the sheriff, both doors were opened, and the officer and interviewer passed within. Another grated barrier was unlocked before a look could be had into the corridor to which the cells of the doomed men opened. The reporter waited while the sheriff gave orders to let two men, confined in one cell, out into the corridor. A lever from without was turned, cell door flew open and out stepped two strongly built, broad shoul- dered, and ruddy-fgced men. Neither could have been over thirty years old, and neither was less than five feet ten in height. Stepping to the corridor grating they laughingly asked: Well what Is it?""

 The sheriff turning to the reporter in formed him that the two men standing there were Tex Howard and Wm. De Ianey, then facing them be said, Here is q reporter who wishes to talk with you.'

 The CITIZEN man fearing an imme1i- ate retreat of the desperadoes, duIckly said: Boys, l am from Tucson, not I would like tO publish what you have to say in the CITIZEN there, and promise you faithfully not to misrepresent your remarks in any man. her; and also that nothing will be printed until after Friday""

 This seeming to satisfy them he ad- dressed Delaney, asking bis opinion re- garding the lynching of Keith.

 ""I don't know anything about Heith. 1 tell you never saw him from Novem- Der 27th until he came to jail. He oughtu't to been hung anyhow

 What have you to say about your self ?"" asked the reporter.

 II can gay We hadn't a square trial. If we had We wouldn't be here. l am in uocent.""

 You remember that Castaneia stated that he lost something like SI0G0 from his safe. That money has never been found Do you wish to tell where 1t IS ?'

 Don't know anything about the no Dey."" exclaimed Delaney, and then How ard who stood near interrupted by say ing: ""The man that's got the money knows where 'ds.'

 Delaney being asked hIm how he felt over his approaching execution, answered No man will stand mp better than l. By the way"" he added, weren't you Tn Clifton last August. No? Well some CITIZEN fellow was, and I sub scIibed for the paper""

 At thIs juncture Dan Kelly who was locked in a cell called out:-'Iell him now the lawyers defended us""

 Howard repied:-""Didn't defend us at all""

 In reply to a question: Howard said his family did not know where he was and would never know.

 The subject of the trial again coming up. Delaney said that if everything was as fair in the proceedings as Judge Pin ney's charge, they would have been all right.

 ""He might have done better"" ex- claimed Howard.

 By the way"" interrupted Delaney, tine jury had a lot of MOrmons on. How many? Six, anyhow, and you bet, when some witness said 1 had a horse with a Mormon brand on, that hung me sure. Why, 1 don't even know bow to steal a horsew

 ""Yes,"" added Howard, ""Nary witness told the truth. The whole evidence was false, and the jury was no better""

 This ended the conversation with Delaney and Howard. It was evident to the reporter from the first that the men were not ready to make any honest confession as to the parts they took Ill the Bisbee affair. If they had been on a spring picnic they could not have been more cOntented. Laughing and joking continually, 1t seemed incomprebensible that the two men were on the verge of the grave. They seemed as reckless of death as they were proven to be of the law. Before the reporter had been with them five minutes, they took advantage of what they considered their cOndescen- sion to be interviewed by calling upon the Sheriff for whisky.

 Daniel Kelly, Omer W. Sample and Daniel DOwd were then released from AiAtai CCiAs GlI Aub NDlLlNDI tOILdAutu the five. All excepting Dowd wanted to engage in irrelevant talk at one time. The latter was quiet, and the reporter only ventured to ask him if Dowd was his right name. He answered-""Well, that's what l am known by here, and no one will know any other while live""

 Kelly was quite talkative. He said that Heith was wrongiully hung. He left Heith November 18th in she Chiri- cahua mountains. ""How will I hang? Well, 1 will walk up. The sheriff will not have to carry me, and if hang as brave as l walk I'm all right"" He said he had no relations; but being more closely questioned he said he lad some ID the old country. He sad, ""I only left there two years ago"" This made the sheriff laugh.

 Confirming the conversation himself. he said he believed Jud-e Pilney ap- pointed as able counsel as c0uld be pro- cured.

 HOward-""But the jury?""

 They all expressed contempt for the jury.

 Delaney -""It the jury had ot hung

A RObber Shoots Car-Driyer, But Is Caught


and Roughly Handled.",,"Street-car robberes have been of frequent
occurrence in indianapolis for several months,
and although in one case, less than three months
ago. there was deliberate, coldblooded muir
der, there has not been a single arrest of the
highwaymen until last night, robber who shot
driver on the South illinois street line
was captured by citizens. The end of
the Ilinoise-street line on McCarty
street is place where several of the robberies
have occurred, and it is regarded as dangerous
point


Last night at II o'clock James Finigan, a
driver the line, after turning his car at Nc
Carty street, stopped for moment before
starting on the return trip, to warm himself by
swinging his arms While engaged in this exers
else, a man entered the rear of the car
and walked through to the front platform,
where he thrust revolver into the drivers face
and commanded him to give up the money in his
possession. Instead of complying with the de-
mand, Finigan grabbed the hand in which the
revolver was held and the two clynched
in a rough-and- d-tumble fight, during which
they fell from the car A shot was
fired by the robber, which attracted
the attention of Mr. Phisterer, who
was going to Schmdts brewery. where he is em-
poyed, and seeing that there was trouble, he
discharged the contents of his revolver as an
alarm Four men employed in the brewery,
which is situated near the scene Of the trouble,
came 10 the assistance of the driver
and secured the robber who was taken
into the brewery and placed under guard
Finigan returned to the city with his
car The police were notified. and the patrol
wagon was sent to the brewery.


While I'd n Oya
of the men in the brewery he seized a stove poker
and made an attempt to escape. He was knocked
down and badly beaten, and was then securely
tied to the wall. When brought to the police
station he gave the name of Charles
Haden, and was charged with making an
assault with intent to kill, and attempting
highway robbery. He is young man, ard does
not look at all like a desperate. When asked
how long he had been in Indianapolis, he at first
refused to tell bur afJotward said that he had
been here four five months. He was en-
ployed in the indianapolis Foundry works until
they suspended and since then he has done no
work He claims that he entered the street car
as passenger, and that the driver, who, he
says, was drunk. Immediately drew revolver
and began firing at him. He claims
that he wrested the weapon from the driver and
that during the fight the men from the brewery
come upon them He saws that he had no re-
volver but that the driver fred several shots
However, the weapon that was found in Havens
possession shows that only one cartridge was
empted. The robbers head was badly cut and
sweled from the pounding that he was given by
the brewery men, and when broUghtintO the police
station he was covered with blood. 1t was
necessary to call the police surgeon to dress his
wounds


When Finigan, the driver, reached the street
car stables it was found that he had been shot in
the groin, and badly wounded, but how seriously
is not known. 1t is is of a dangerous nature
and his exposure to the cold, it is feared will
have bad effect upon the wound."

 RICHMOND, Va, July 20.-The announce ment of the pooling arrangement between the Bankers and Merchants, the Baltimore and Ohio, the Postal Telegraph and the Com mercial Cable companies meets with marked approval and gives general satisfaction throughout the South. The Southern Tele- graph company, which is part of the Bank CTS and Merchants combination, is already making a strong competition with the West ern Union for business in this section, and as it's lines are extended the prospect for cheap. CT rates becomes more apparent This com- pany's lines, which run from Washington to Richmond, thence to Norfolk, Lynchburg, Charleston and Savannah, have recently been extended and completed to Montgomery, Ala; and will soon be open for business at Macon, Ga., Selma, Ala, and other southern points. The material is also being rapidly accumulated for the further extension of it's lines to Mobile and New Orleans. Another branch is also being constructed from this city via the coast to Wilmington, N. O., Charleston, s. O., and intermediate points, with the prospect of ultimately reaching all important points in southeastern Georgia and Florida. The new company has received the most liberal patronage and hattering en- couragement from the southern public. This, coupled with the statement that the new pool will hasten the completion of it's south ern lines and produce consequent improve ment in service and reduction of rates, gives assurance that successful competition with the Western Union will soon be opened at all points, to the advantage of the general 1oub1ic"

of two runners, with one strongly braced

the base of stump, around which the snow
was melting, and he stopped his steers to
prospect. He found that the cavity beneath

enlarged the entrance and stirred Bruin up,

end and made q moose, which he dropped
over Bruins head. He then gave the steers
the haul-away word. They brought the bear
to the surface, but becoming frightened at
the sight of the bear at the other end OF the
line, they broke for the camp and in the

him at a decided disadvantage, would ""set

The cause of the disaster was collision between a special eastern bound freight train and a suburban train which was composed of dummy, engine and two passenger cars. The freight locomotive drove the dummy engine clean through the Car to which 1t was attached, and mounted both, piling freight cars still higher What had before teen Car full of strong, hearty men became in an instant a sickeuing death trap filled with mangled, 1 bleeding humanity. A second later the boiler of tie dummy engine exploded, and the steam and water carried death or awful injuries to 0 majority of the poor creatures. Fire followed and completed the calamity. The agonies of the sufferers were indescrib- able. Some of them piteously besougLt those near by to pour water upon their scalded limbs and bodies, to do anything to ease their intolerable pain. Their limbs were bruised, mangled, half eaten away by fire, or swollen by the action of the steam and water. Tweuty-seven passengers are said to have been killed and as many injured. It was fifty minutes before any man could walk back two miles through the snow to the telegraph ofioe and apprise the railway officials of the disa ter. The headquarters of the Great Western branch are in Hamilton, forty miles distant. Word was at once sent to Agent Gormally in Toronto, and he sent out relief trains. The dead and wounded were brought to the city in passenger cars.

carry the Pacific States without an el-
fort is based upon scanty information
concerning the political situation on
that coast. That Blaines anti-C Chinese
speech made him popular in California
is nnque>tioned, but the passage of the
restriction act in the face of Republican,
opposition and Republican veto-s
showed the people OF California that
they must look to the Democratic party
for protection against the ruinous com
petition of Asiati. labor Blaine did not
represent the attitude of his party on
the Chinese question; he simply joined
the Democratic party on that issue.
Moreover. Eastern people generally do
not realize that the Chinese question is
not ayitaling the Pacific Coast to day
and will not be the important issue in
the contest of 1851 that it was in 1850.
1t is virtually settled for the present,
and Calfornians understand perfectly
that the Demo can be depended
upon to keep it settled. while in the
event of restoration of Republican su-
prcmacy at Washington it would surely
be reopened by statesmen OF the Hoar
school.


The Chinese question is rarely re-
ferred To now hy Caliiornians. The
subject which absorbS their attention
and governs all their political action is
the rapacity of the railroad corpora
tions. The Pacific coast is being dev-
astated and laid waste by the gigantic
railroad monopoly, and the people have
been in turmoil for two wears in their
efforts to head OIL the robbers and save
themselves from ruin. The fact that
the ablcSt and most respectable jour
mails in California are seriously advocat-
ing lynch law Is the only remedy for
the existing state of affairs, indicates
clearly that the railroad question is The
absorbing political issue in that section.


Blaine is VIGOROUSLY the frie.ld and
tool of rairOad monOpoli>ts. His rec
ord is composed largely of railroad
scandals, railroad jobbery and railroad
subserviency The enthusiastic Blaine
delegation from California to the Re-
publican Convention was composed Of
men wholly in the railroad interests.


Any anti-monopoly Democrat can
beat Blaine out of sight in California.
Blaine can he beaten there by anybody,
if the Democrats devote themselves -
showing mp his railroad record. Cali
fornia does not stand among the Re-
publican States. II not surely in the
Democratic column, she can be counted
as exceedingly doubtful.


As to Nevada, principles and politics
may be left entirely ont of the discus
sion. There are now but 1000 voters
left in the State. and they have no pr;n-
ciples. The Statc is bankrupt. and her
only assets are her three electoral votes.
which are for sale to the highest bidder.
There is no attempt in Nevada to con-
ceal that fact The votes are for sale
at public auction. and the side which
offers the biggest sack of coin can have
them. Nevada does not care a rap for
the Chinese question. or anv other ques
ton. Blaine. the devil and Tom Walker
are all the same TO her. She sold her
votes to Sharon for half 4 million, to
Fair for 4 quarter of a million. and 10
willing 70 sell them again for what they
will bring. Nevada is not worth talk
in@ about. She ought to vote for Blaine
out Of natural sympathy and affinity.

Further Particulars of the Fire.
NEW YORK, Aug. 4-ll:45 P. M.-The
fire at the Pennsylvania Railroad depot
ut Jersey City is spreading, and the
heat is so great that the iiremen and
employees are prevented from saving
anything on the shore, while the tug
boats cannot get near enough to tow out
the ferry boats and the freight boats,
and they must go in the general destrue-
ton. The depot piers are also burning,
and this involves the loss of all freight
aud cars upon them. The wind is light,
| yet sufficient TO give the fire q northerly
direction. The loss will be very heavy.


1870 A. M.--The Pennsylvania Rail
road depot and ferry houses are destroy
ed. The flames, however, burn furious.
| ly yet and have attacked the Adams
Express Companys pier, and that por-
tion nearest to the shore is on fire. The
iremen are laboring hard to save it, but
fear the shed which covers it will carry
the flames throughout its length aud
breadth. The entire fire department of
jersey City is at work pouring water
upon the flames, while the river boats
are contributing number of heavy
streams. The Pennsylvania Railroad
depot and ferry houses being of wood
and stocked with every sort OF combusti-
BILE material, the flames made sure
and rapid work, mocking the conpanys
fire department, and an organization of
employees, and defying the labors Of the
city fire department while there was
stick of wood standing for the flames to
feed on.


One o'clock-The fire was caused by
the explosion of gas in the ferry en-
trance. The flames spread rapidly to

and n Brilliant Ball.",,"The Montgomery Guards Receive the


sarsHeId Guard-A Glorious Welcome


and N Brilliant Ball.


The Montgomery Guards received the Sars-
field Guard of New Haven yesterday, and with
their many friends in this city, rendered them
royal Irish welcome, striking parade, and
brilliant ball in City Hall. The day was all
that could be desired for the affair; cloudless
skies, bright snn and the warmth OF early
summer all striving to make the occasion a
red-letter day In the memory OF both COM
mands. Flags and bunting were spread to the
breeze on every hand, public buildings were
decorated, and the fronts of the Falmouth
Hotel-the headquarters of the compsny-the
Montgomery Guards armory and the City
Hall, were especially noticeable At the City
Hall large shield on the centre of the front
balcony bore the date MAY 10Th, 1884,"" flank
ed on the one side by the word ""Montgom-
erys,"" and on the other side by the legend
""Sarsfield."" A number of clubs, noticeably
the Peters, Grsttans and East Ends, kept open
house and dispensed most lavish hospitality
during the day and evening.


At 845 a, m. the reception committee of the
Montgomery Guards took the train over
the Boston and Maine and proceeded to North
Berwick where they met the special train from
Boston bearing the Sarsfeld Guard and es-
corted them to the city. Arrived at Portland
at II a. m. the visiting company was received
at the station by the Guards and escorted up
Park and down Congress and Middle streets to
the Falmouth Hotel, where the guests were
glad to seek their rooms and remove the travel
stains left by their long trip. The Sarsfelds
took train from New Haven at ia. M, Sun
day, arrived at Boston at an early hour, and
breakfasted in that city with Mr.. John Walsh,
formerly of the Montgomery Guards, who re-
ceived them with magnificent breakfast.
They then proceeded by special train to Port
land and as sleep had not visited their eyelds
to any extent, it may well be believed they
| needed rest. AS they marched to the hotel
from the station they looked exceedingly we'll.
They were in heavy marching order, with great
coats on, rolled red blankets on knapsacks,
and wore their regulation helmets, like those
OF the Maine militia, while their gray fatigue
caps were slung at their belts. Their unifsrm
is very similar to that of the Cadets. The
American Band of New Haven, George B.
Streit, leader, of 21 pieces accompanied them,
and made striking appearance in their white
coats.


The Sars6eld Guard are named for Patrick
Sarsfeld, Earl of Lucan, who was brave SOL
dier OF the stirring times of 1645-93 William
LII was forced by him to raise the seige of
Limerick in 1890, and he was killed at the
battle of Landen in 1893.

After rest, and a hearty dinner, the two
commands drove about the city visiting all the
various points Of interest, and partaking of the
many hospitalities extended them.


Shortly after four o'clock the city companies
performing escort duty assembled at their re-
sDective armories and the line was soon formed
on Congress street, the right resting on Preble,
and then the battalion marched down Middle
street to the Falmouth Hotel where it was
joined by the Montgomery Guards, the Ameri
can band and the visiting company. The or
der of profession was then asfollows

The line of march was then through Mid
die, to Exchange. to Congress, to Smith, to
Cumberland, to Pearl, to Congress, to High,
to Deering, to State, to Spring, to High, to
Free, to Middle, to the Falmouth Hotel,
where the parade was dismissed.
Crowds Of spectators thronged the streets,
squares and corners, and the battalion and the
Connecticut company made an imposing ap-
pearance, the latter being nailed from all sides
by applause. The Guard in the afternoon
paraded in light marching order and with
their white cross belts and fountain plumes
over the cadet grey made the company pleas
ingly conspicuous. After the parade capital
supper was informally enjoyed by the guests at
the Falmouth.


At an early hour in the evening the hall was
came upon the stage and most charmingly
played several selections which were we'll re-
ceived. The American Band next came on
and pleasingly rendered an overture and Sc
lection interspersed with an admirable cornet
solo by Mr.. j. A. Gould.


Meanwhile Mayor King accompanied by
Mayor Lewis of New Haven and followed by


the reception committee, the distinguish
military and civic guests both from Connecti-
| cut and Maine entered the hall and occupied
seats expressly reserved for them.
After the concerts, the Montgomerys and
the Sarsfelds marched in upon the floor amid
| tumultuous applause, and were reviewed by
Col. Lynch and staff. Next followed the COM
pany movements, manual of arms and bayonet
exercise, by squad of ""a men from the Mont
gomery Guards, to whom much praise is due.
Among the well executed company move
| ments, the left and right fronts into line, the
| obliques and the left wheel were loudly ap-
plauded. In the manual of arms, the firings
| by rank, both kneeling and lying down, were
| handsomely introduced while the bayonet ex-
ercises, from front open file were skilfully

lam Murrell, the colored orator. who has made
many effective speeches In Maine, New Jersey

rell is an cN-sugar planter, and was Tor several
years member Of the Louisiana legislature
before 1879, when he was counted out. lie
thoroughly understands the southern system of
elections, and said.


About ten days ago told the editor of the
Philadelphia Press In u private conversation
that before election day he would hear OF MUIR
dcrs of republicans and negroes in Kellogg's-
the third cOngresslonal-distriet OF Louisiana,
and that 1t would be sent to the country that
the niggers' started the trouble. ] lsaw In this
mornings Tribune that the prediction had
been verified. The report says that Joe
GilfouS, whom l know to be bitter, bull
doing democrat was murdered by republican
negroes. How strange 1t is that he should go
to a republican meeting to keep republican
'nggors' from fighting. l see, also, that Judge
rontelieu has been shot. He was one of the
south, and was native of the town of New
Iberia. lie was twice elected district Judge,
and served eight years. He was then elected
state senator, and aiter serving in that ollce
for four years last spring he was again elected
district judge. The governor however, re-
fused TO commission him. but gave the COM
mission to his opponent and sent the state
troops to the parish TO Oust Judge Fontolieu



the democratic candidates who had been
overwhelmingly defeated at the polls.
""The shooting of Judge Fontelieu insures

| cratic candidate. Tho most significant thing
about this affair is the fact that all the repub-
! liCans who were shot were leaders of the re-
| publican party In that district, aud not
merely local politicians The next Associated
Press dispatch which you read from Louisiana
| will say that the state has gone democratic by
| $1,000 majority, and that the entire delegation
| TO congress Is democratic. The fact of the
whole affair Is this: Tho democrats in the
| south have given up all hope of elccting Cleye-
land, and have said in language not TO be mis-


taken that they will control Mr., Blaine with Il

""on what did you base the prediction OF

""On the tone OF the democratic press OF the

was taken witt, like result. Then the
question came on ordering the bill to
third reading.


Del Vale said that the two amend
ments which had passed had killed the
spirit of the bill and that he for his part
was in favor of hurryiug it out OF sight,
lest it should stink in the sight of God
and men. Similar sentiment was ex-
pressed by Reddy. A vote was then

STAuNroN, VA, Jan. 9.-Fridsy night
last lynohing affair occurred at
Monterey, in Highland county. Owing
to the blocka AIDED roads for so miles across
four mountains, the particulars did not
reach here until to night. 4. d. Atchison,
the man who was lynched, was confined
in jail for stabbiDg Sidney Ruckmsn, a
prominent resdjuster, on Christmas Day,
while the two we're drinking together
Atchison, who is said to be Vermouter,
and a desperate character, was arrested
against the protest OF Ruckman,
who is recovering from the cutting.
Atohison was heard to make some threats
that when he got out of Jail he would kill
some of the men who procured his arrest.


Friday night last 10 rough fellows, with
masks on, came to the jail about mid
night and demanded the keys of j. Hiner
the person in charge. He said they were
not in his possession. The mob then,
all of whom are said to have been under
the influence of liquor, commenced to
batter down the door, meanwhile shoot
ing with pistols and guns through the
doors and windows. Atchison fought
furiously inside for his life, though shot
three or four times. Once he knocked
pistol out of the hand of man who had
thrust it between break in the door.
The desperadoes were two hours in fore.
ing their way into the cell of the doomed
man, during which time the masks
fell from the faces of five of the
men, who were recognized by
the man Oh guard. Atchison was finally
secured, aud bleeding from four wounds,
almost dead and unable to walk, was
tied and dragged away about or 3
O'Clock in the morning. The lynohers
told the guard he would find their
prisoner on certain tree about half
mile from town. After daylight be fol-
lowed the track where the unfortunate
man had been dragged through the snow,
aud found him hanging dead from the
tree indicated.


The Law abiding community of High
land is said to bs indignant over this out

 sketch of Lieutenant John Underhill Rhodes, renowned for his heroic efforts for the preservation of life at the City of Colum- bus disaster, is given in the Boston Post of Saturday and likeness of the gallant officer copied from portrait taken in Wilmington. He was born in the town of Fair Haven, Connecticut. on the 23d of September, 1850, and is therefore in the thirty-fourth year of his age. His father, William Rhodes, was sea captain, long in the employ of Messrs. H. Trowbridges Sons, and the lad having Q taste for water, his father took him on board the celebrated and fast sailing ship ""Golden Fleece"" and gave him thorough training as seaman. Young Rhodes made repeated voyages with his father and when he left the merchant marine was very intelligent and practical navigator. The time came when the young man tired of his life aboard ship and wishing to add to his experience as 8 landsmRn:. he engaged as clerk in the store of Francis & Chidsey. It was while serving in that capacity that the old longing for 8 sea life came back to him, and he applied for an appointment in the revenue service. He served first as cadet, and after short ap- premiership was examined for promotion, passed the rigid ordeal of the examining board, and was commissioned as third lieu tenant.

 He was first assigned to the revenue cutter Grant, with which vessel he remained about two years, when he was transferred in the latter part of the year 1875 to the revenue cutter Colfax, with headquarters at Whining

 ton, N. C., on which station, with 8 brief intermission, he remained for about eight years. Some four years ago he was again colled before the revenue marine examining board, at which time he passed the exsmina

 ton with high honors and was accordingly, in May, 1880, commissioned as second lieuten- ant With this rank he continued on the Col

 fax until about three months since, when, at the special request of Captain Eric Gabriel son, of the revenue cutter Dexter, who had previously commanded the Oolfax, he was transferred to that vessel at Newport, R. l.

 Lieutenant Rhodes in May, 1877, was united in marriage to Miss Mary Wharton Hard wicke, the eldest daughter of George W. Hardwicke, of Wilmington. N. O., and one of the loveliest women of that cultured and hospitable city. The father of Mrs. Rhodes has been a resident of Wilmington for the past eight years, and was connected with the Star newspaper of that city. Previous to his removal to the old North State MT. Hardwicke had resided in Lynchburg, Va, where for 8 number of years he published the Republican newspaper, Democratic journal well known in Virginia and other southern States. In September last, after brief illness, Mrs. Rhodes died at her home in Wilmington, N. O., which event seemed to cast dark shadow over the life of her husband. He had looked forward to a long life of marital peace and happiness, but such was not the ruling of Providence.

 The fond bride of only six summers was tenderly laid away beneath the southern mosses, and two sprightly little boys-Wil- liam Clarence and George Wharton-aged respectively five and three years, were left to tighten the sorrow of the bereaved hus- band. The eldest boy is now with his moth er's family in Wilmington, while the younger one is with his fathers family in North Mad ison, Conn. Lieut.. Rhodes has ever enjoyed the reputation of being superior in all nau- tical matters, and has on several occasions given substantial evidence of heroic daring in moments of the greatest peril. His commanders have ever had the utmost confidence in his su. perior seamanship, and it has not been unu- sual in cases of great responsibility that the post of honor has been assigned him. By his brother officers and the community gen. orally, wherever he has lived, he has ever been held in the highest esteem. He has several times had fortunate escapes from dis aster at sea, notably at St. Thomas. when the island was swept by 8 great tornado, hurri cane and tidal wave, some thirteen years ago. At that time there were eighty vessels in the harbor of St Thomas and Lieutenant Rhodes, then in the merchant marine, was on board one of the only two which were saved.

 The Boston testimonial to Lieut. Rhodes, amounting to $2, ,053, is accepted by him with the condition that he be allowed to divide it with his brother officers and the ships crew."

That section of the country is tho most
beautiful ever saw, with Its high rolling
hills, its primeval forests, and its crystal
rivers, but outside of our line Of sentrieJ
we had no mind for tho beauties OF
nature. We had always to keep our eyes
skinned for the bushwhackers, who
swarmed in the vicinity, aud the mon
never left camp for any distance by spe-
cial orders unless In squads OF three or
four, and then always with loaded rifles.
The people Of the country were almost
universally sullen toward us. and the
women aud children in tho farm houses
especially regarded us with cold dislike.
As q rule, they would tell us to help our
selves to fruit, &C., but they refused to
sell us anything. and there was not
horse, OF a cow, or a pig, or o chicken TO
be seen anywhere. They had, OF course,
been run off vt our approach. Evidently,
East Tennessee had no love for confoder-
ates. One morning tho scouts came in
and announced that Gen. Blount, with
force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
was advancing from the direction Of
Bloun tsville to hustle us up. -""


Besides the four regiments of the bri-
gade, we had q cavalry. or rather mounted
infantry, regiment and splendid battery
of six pieces, among them 1O-pounder
Parrott gun. Gen. Corse soon had his
force in position on high ridge crossing
the Blountsville road, couple of miles
or so, and here we awaited Gen. Blounts
assault, confident that he would find him
self in hornets nest before he was done
with the matter. About 10 o'clock In the
day his skirmishers appeared on the ridge
opposite, q half mile away, and then he
run up some howitzers and began to shell
our position. We huggod the ground
without replying for some timo, but,
finding that Blount did not sd-
vance, Gen. Corse ordered the Goth Vir-
ginia TO charge the battery, which they
| did, and at tho same time all our six guns
opened on the enemy cavalry aud In
| fantry) massed mile beyond. The guns
were captured by the Goth, and Gen.
Blount got out of the way in short order
as our other infantry regiments left the
wooded crest, advancing in limo Of battle,
which is all that need be said Of this
little affair, although, perhaps, the knowl-
| edge Of our presence saved the salt works
for the time being.


The next morning the telegraph brought
the news that Longstreet had raised the
siege of Knoxville, and we were again
bundled into the cars for the return triT
to Petersburg. The trip was without in
cident, except that Gen. Corse took care
thss time that we should not enjoy th'
delights and hospitalities Of ""Lynchburi
on the James,"" MURRAY."

IL Ia because the endeavor has been made
TO view events and operations purely
from the standpoint Of the private SOL
dier, and to relate as faithfully as may
be the experiences Of men in the ranks as
far as can recall thom to mind. The
official reports Of generals Are doubtless
the best record of the bare facts Of
campaign, but they are worthless as to
che lights and shadows Of army life; and,
after all, the latter are much more inter-
esting to the average reader. / would
prefer to read the diary Of n private SOL
dier as to the operations in which his
regiment participated to the report Of his
general relative to the same.


When Gen. Lonstreet in September,
1868, was detached from the army of
northern Virginia to ro.enforce the army
of Gen. Bragg in Tennessee no carried
with him but two divisions of his corps.
Pickett's was left behind at Richmond and
Petersburg. Corse's brigade of Pickett's
division was stationed at Petersburg. Af-
Ter the battle of Chicamauga, and when
Longstreet was besioging tho army Of
Gen. Burnside at Knoxville, Tenn, ono |
beautiful autumnal morning tho entire |
brigade was bundled on the cars on the |
South Side road and headed for Lynch
burg. The transportation of troops by |
the railroads in the confederate service
was very ugh-and-ready arrangement, |
something as we read of the transporta- |
zion of cattle and hogs in the good old
days before Henry Berg inaugurated the
establishment of societies for the preven-
tion Of cruelty to animals. Tho cars
were invariably old freight or box cars,
with the planks knocked of at intervals
for ventilation, without springs, and to
ride in them over the ill-ballasted tracks
was like jolting over cobblestone pave
ment in lumber wagon.


Into these dilapidated vehicles the
troops were packed, with just about
enough room for tho men to lie down
spoon fashion. On the top of the cars,
which sloped from the center to the sides,
was placed another contingent, as much
crowded as those in the body Of the car.
Now. just imagine how pleasant it was
for the men, with the train moving ut
forty miles an hour, the cars jolting,
rocking, and swaying from side to side,
as If they would overturn at every curve.
Men could scarcely stand up under such
circumstances, and even when sitting
down they would be thrown against each





1t is said that ""eels can get used to being
skinned"" and Corse's brigade at tho time
spoken of had been treated to SO much of
this sort of transportation in guarding the
railroad between Richmond and Gordons-
Vile that they had become accustomed to
it and were able to derive certain enjoy
ment from tho whistling wind and the
rapid motion. You see, when the brigade
was wanted anywhere by rail, it was
wanted quickly, and every pound Of
steam was cracked upon the engines that
the boilers would bear. In spite of the
proverbial csrelessness Of soldiers don't
recollect of any accident happening on
these quick trips, except once, and that
vas on the Petersburg and Weldon road.
Across this road the bridges overhead arc
frequent and low, so that the cry Of
""BridgeW caused all the men standing
up on top Of the cars to duck down until
il was passed. The cry was SO often re-
peated out Of mischief that it began to
be unheeded, and, as consequence. three
tall men of the 11th regiment had their
heads takeno # as If by cannon ball.


When we arrived at Lynchburg tho
brigade was halted on the side of the
river opposite the city, and as only two
passes at time were permitted each
company, and as the only access TO the
city was across covered bridge quar-
ter of mile long, and as a strong guard
was posted at the entrance OF the bridge,
the men were in quandary as to the best
means of visiting the ancient burgh to
get some applejack. Some of the men
of the 18th soon solved the problem.
They found some stringers on the out
side Of the bridge at point out OF view
of the sentries, and, clambering up by
these to the top of the bridge, they were


IL a .haar tnf fhA hnr
side. Once inside the town, having been
recently paid of, they began to fill up with
apple brandy and to paint the town red
In good humored way. The climax of
their antics was reached when they cap
tured COW, upon which one of the
uumber, dressed in such fantastic trim
mings and feathers as were procurable,
mounted, and with sword Of lathe, with
ell the dignity of colonel, led his fol-
lowers down Maine street, while they
startled the indignant burghers with the
clamor of their pasteboard horns


Gen. Corse was quickly Informed of
this, and sent over strong provost
guard, who soon captured every mothers
son Of the revelers, who were as happy
as clans at high tide over the success of
their escapade. II was well for the pris-
oners that orders were received that
night for the brigade TO proceed with all
haste to Bristol to defend the salt works
which supplied the confederacy with salt,
and which were seriously threatened.
The prisoners were at least hundred in
number, and their services were too
much needed to punish them as they
fully deserved. Anyhow, the writer was
willing to cry ""peccavi.'

that Oh one occasion at lvor station, on
the Petersburg and Norfolk railroad,
some of the 18th, hearing that an old
farmer had several barrels Of brandy
which he gave and sold to the principal
officers to curry favor with them, but who
refused to sell or give any of the precious
stuff to the rank and file, procured by
hook or crook an officers uniform, which
the sternest looking one of them put on.
A dozen or more got their rifles and &C.
coutrements, and off they went to tho
farmers house, a full l-dedged provost
guard. The pseudo officer declared that
he had been sent to destroy the liquor
because the farmer had been selling to
soldiers. He plead and protested his
innocence, and finally tho officer agreed
to defer the seizure if the farmer would
give him two or three buckets.full to
carry back to camp as present for his
superiors to appease them--a compromise
that was eagerly acceded to by old hay
seed. That night one-half the regiment
WAS uproarously drank before the officers
were aware of what was going on, and

considering the names OF, Hon. w.
w. Dudley, the present Commits
sioner of Pensions, and Hon. w.
III. Caikins, member of Congress
from that state, in connection with
the nomination for Governor, to be
elected in next November. 1t is
hoped that the Indiana Republl-
cans will seriously consider the
great risk they will take of loos!ug
the election by nominating such a
man as Mr.. Calklns.


The record Mr.. Calkins made in
the 47th Congress as chairman OF
Elections, is such that no colored
man who Is true to his race, nor
white man who is a true republi-
can, can vote to make Mr.. Calkins
Governor Of Indiana. He has
convinced us that he is unworthy
of the support and confidence OF
the colored people, and that he
has acted the traitor to his party.


Notwithstanding the knowledge
he must have had of the way In
which the Democratic Bulldozers
and Ballotbox suffers, defrauded
Southern Republicans out of their
rights at the polls in 1880, he, ear
ly in the session, took strong sides
with the Democrats on the election
committee, and opposed the seat
ing of every colored contestant
who had cases before his com
mittee. He opposed the seating
of such able men as Lynch, OF
Mississippi Smalls ana Lee o.
South Carolina; Witherspoon, o.
Florida; and Jones, Of Alabama
He assured a prominent Southern
democrat In the early part of th'
first session of the 47th Congress
that the democrats whose seatt
were contested should not be dis
| turbed in their seats by report;
| from his committee at this session


Surely the Republican eonven
ton of indiana will not foist such
man as Mr.. Calkins, upon the coloret
voters, if SO, they invite and desire
defeat at the polls, especially when
the name of Hon. w. w. Dndley
is before the people as a candidate
for Governor. Mr.. Dudley is al
able, true and staunch republican
and has not shown himself oppos
ed to the Negro race."

dead. But / am speaking of Maxwell


vicinity. In the first place, Mr.. McShane


has failed to put in an appearance at this
point, therefore l beg leave to correct his
errors. In the statement he has
made, concerning the losses and
cause of the disease amongst
the cattle here and at Brady's Island
he says Lynch and Mccullough lost forty
head each out of herds of not great size.
True, Lynch had only forty head all told,
thirty eight died. He has two skim
milk calves left. But Mccullough had
700 head and 200 of them are dead at
this date and lots more in dying condi-
ton. He also says out of Plumer's herd
of 800 between fifty and sixty head have
died. I would say to McShane he had
better visit Maxwell before making an
other report and get posted concerning
the cattle interest here.


Plumer & Jewett had l, 500 head be-
fore this epidemic set in-52 died last
Sunday out of that Number, and tonight
they count 200 hides taken off dead
cattle from the ""P"" brand, pastured
from four to ten miles northeast of Max
well, instead of along the line of the
Union Pacific road, as Mr.. McShane
states. This shows how utterly ignorant
this gentleman is when he says all of
those cattle were shipped in from
western Iowa or eastern Nebraska,
when as a matter of fact not one head of
those cattle were shipped in here except
30 head of COWS he speaks of belonging to
Green & Burke, seven of which died
few days ago, south of the Platte river.
Those were culled by Mr.. McShane,
and Mr.. Burke left them at Brady
Island, where they contracted the
disease from the Rankin herd, shipped
from Texas and unloaded at Brady Is
land on the 9th day of last May. Of
course McShanes old COWS were not to
escape because they came from Blair, any
more than the native cattle raised here,
belonging to several parties, besides those
aforementioned. Jeremiah Snyder has
lost so head out of 100, George Roberts
80 head out of 250, and P. F. Dolan %
out of 150, Dolan has 800 head in pas
ture that did not come in contact with
the trail of the Rankin
herd, and are free from the disease as are
also several small herds in this vicinity,
that were not exposed to the trail of the
Rankin herd, which is proof positive that
the disease was contracted from the afore-
said Rankin cattle instead of Western
Iowa and Eastern Nebraska herds, as in
timated by Mr.. McShane in his particu-
lar phase where he says none but those
from the above points were infected with
the disease. This is not only absurd but
ridiculous on the whole, and shows how
ignorant he is in the matter.


1t is we'll known that the Plumer
Bros. were extensive stock raisers, and
is now known as the firm of Plumer 81
Jewett. John Mccullough has been in
the cattle business the last twelve
years; also DR.. A. l.. Flict, and others
too numerous to mention, whose cattle
are on well matured range north of
Brady Island station, where the
Franklin herd was unloaded from cars,
and driven out on this same range,
mingling in with the above herds, and
as Is proven by Professor Hopkins, vet
erinarian of Wyoming territory, who
verifes that the Texas cattle will convey
the disease in their system and although
apparently well, and will
convey the disease to any
northern cattle they come in contact
with. This Rankin herd not only inocu-
lated our native herds here with the dis
ease, but they also infected them with
the Texas wood tick. Cattle that are
sick and dying with. the disease are liter.
ally covered with those ticks, thing
never known to exist in this locality be-
fore. We now believe in Mr.. Hopkin's
theory and find his statement true where
he says one native herd will not carry
lAO oioOdcO W dhoeiiCh hdtiNS hOEos LILO
causes more quiet feeling in the com
munity, as we are in hopes of saving the
cattle that did not come in contact with
the through Texans.


There were about $500 head exposed
to the disease on this range, where
the men in charge of the Rankin herd
held them for several days to rest and
recruit up before driving on their own
range, which goes to show that they lost
the virus in this vicinity before they
were driven of, thereby, perhaps, saving
both ..Rankin's own herd, and all herds
adjoining his range, including Mr.,
Bratt's and others. But assure you the
losses here are suppressed more than
exaggerated. Out of the above number
of cattle there are at least 700 head dead,
and no sign of its letting up,
although not dying as fast as they did
last week.


would write more on this subject,
but 1t might tire your patience, and per-
haps would destroy, or convey it to the
waste basket, but there is no use In sup
pressing the truth of the matter, as it is
well known that the disease is not con-
tagious amongst native cattle, and only
those exposed to the thorough Texans
will be liable to infection. and as you had
no true report of the disease since it

reSpOndent-P",WiLLIAMspoRT. June 25.,"ter, of Bellefonte, is visiting friends
In the city.


Master Robert Williams, JOURNAL
agent, of Bellefonte, came down to
our city on ""Wednesday to look up
the interest of the paper.


Cyrus Woodson, of this city, took
trip to Danville last week, and he
returned on Monday and reported
Blaine and Logan booming down
there.


William Shadney is suffering with
very severe attack of the rheuma
tism. He is unable to leave his bed.
We hope he will speedily recover,


Tomorrow Sunday will be the
children's day of the Mill Street
Church. The exercises will be held
at the court house, commencing at 2
o'clock in the afternoon. The usual
services will be held in the evening
at the church.


Are you going to Elmira in Au-
gust?


The lawn festival that was held on
the lawn, on River avenue last week,
was grand success. The ladies who
composed the committee were Mrs.
Charley Kelly, Mrs. William Allen,
Mrs. Mary Willis, Miss Hannah
Green, Miss Matilda Cooper. The
ladies were assisted by Messrs. VIM.
Allen and VIM. Alexander. They
succeeded in raising $4,000, or three
cents clear of all expenses, which was
handed to the new church fund.


Elmira's colored people are prepar
ing for lively celebration on August
IL, and a paper Of that city speaks as
follows of it: 1t is now several years
since rousing celebration has been
had here At that time Frederick
Douglass was the orator. This year
this great day falls on Tuesday, Au-
gust 12. The orator is John Il.
Lynch, the late temporary chairman
of the Republican convention at
Chicago. At one time arrangements
had been partially made with Hon.
B. X. Bruce, but two or three days
since definite arrangement was made
with J. r. Lynch. The following
are some of the companies aud bands
that will be in attendance, all colored ;
The Fowner guards, ofSyracuse, fifty
men and we'll drilled; the Delhi hook
and ladder company, of Delhi, n. Y,
forty men; the Norwich Hose COM
pauy; the Horseheads Protection hose
company, accompanied by the Spen
Ger band; the colored G. A. r. Post
of Williamsport; the Steelton colored
brass band, of Harrisburg; the Merry
makers club, of Geneva. 1t is also
very likely that the Sumner club, of
Ithaca, will be present. The co!ored
brass band of Corning will accom-
pany the delegation attending from
that town. Delegates from Wilkes
Barre, Havana, Watkins, and many
other towns will sweep down on the
city and capture it. Blaine and
Logan club, of Williamsport, will be
present.


The Blaine and Logan club met on
Monday night at their hall on Wal
nut street. After a three hour dis
cussion was INDUCED in by Ajax
Jones and others, the meeting was
ready for business. After adopting
the resolutions and Bylaws a few
speeches were made. The election
of officers for the street procession
was the next in order, when the fol
lowing gentlemen were declared
elected:


Captain-Eugene Stokes.


First IIieutenant-John Fairfax.


Second Lieutenant-Wm. Stokes.
There is music in a scolding wife that set a
home in awe,


There is music in a Thomas cat, or the filing
of a saw,


There is music in a dinner horn, or bug that
flies about,


There is music in some girls we know, but it's
hard to bring it out.

 Rinks-The Ten Mile Walking Match -Thousands of ofSpectatOrs.

 Yesterday was lively day at the shore one of the most animated of the season. ] There were three picnics at the shore, a ten mile walking match and various other

 settlements. The Newington Congregation al church and Sunday school, Rev. MT: El-

 liott pastor, and Joshua Belden. superintend- | ent of the school, composed one party They numbered 190 and had 8 fine time, judging | from the g1ee of the boys and girls and their ! intense interest in everything that could be seen or talked about. About thirty of them enjoyed a sail on the Hattie J., the large l sharpie of Captain Johnson, and visited the | new lighthouse, inspected the breakwater l and made themselves familiar with the points of interest along the coast within scope of I the vision. They returned at about 6 | o'clock, extra horse cars conveying them to ! the Union depot in this city. Another throng of excursionists came from | Middlefeld on the Air Line railroad. It was union picnic of the Congregational, Episcopal and Methodist churches, and there l were about 200 in all. Captain Charles | Smith, of West Haven, took out 45 of them including a number of the leading officers of the church and Sunday school in his famous sharpie Mary. The wind was fresh and ac- tive and the parties reported that they had had splendid time. Everything was right for a fine sail

 Another party came from our neighboring town of Bethany. They numbered about sixty, and jolly ride they had down the Woodbridge hills. About twenty drove in with the four-horse turnout of MT. John Warner with John at the reins, and there were double teams and single team loads. About thirty of the party had fine sail on the roomy and well known sharpie of Cap tain J. E. Futile, of Fair Haven East, and though the F'white-caps"" were not, the waves were just high enough to give all taste of 'lifs on the ocean wave"" The party paid their respects to the thew light"" and the breakwater and other points of interest which engrossed their attention. Among them was an old friend and former Bethanyite, Mir. N. C. Goodspeed, of Cleveland, Ohio, for two and half years past. The day was all that could be desired and the party returned after dusk, the evening ride being delightful.

 At Howes skating rink there was enjoy ment for all Tuesday night, when the.colored population had the rink and there was great sport over the contest for prizes-two silver cups Last evening there was another fine exhibition of fancy skating given by Miss Minnie Drew, the Compress of skaters"" and Archie Dajan, re- gently from Saratoga, an enteIprising twelve year-old man who travels alone and makes all his engagements fearless and independent, while his skating is reckoned among the best of the many interesting exhibitions of the kind that has been given at MT. Howes' rink. Tomorrow Friday) night Miss Bertie Mann, the champion of New York State, night Melrose, the young champion one legged skater, will hold forth. Melrose lost one of his legs by railroad accident. The West Haven brass band oeiciates on exhibi- tion evenings and is doing finely.

 BHadley's Point cottage, one of the most delightfully.""- situated cottages along the coast, has been rented this season by MT. Fitzger- aid, of Waterbury, very popular caterer. He has had his house full constantly, and many Waterbury people have been or are now sojourning there.

 Between forty and fifty of the friends of

  residence on Albert street Tuesday evening to help them celebrate the twenty-ffth an niversary of their welded life. The invasion was complete surprise to MT. and Mrs. Johnson.

 Great interest was aroused at Railroad Grove yesterday afternoon by the ten mile walking match The contestants were Willie Me Cormack, waiter at Putnam & Hale's, for merly manager at the Skeeles' skating rink, Sayin Rock; Hawley, colored man of about 35 years and young Ralph Nickerson, son of Captain Nickerson of West Haven The judges were. A. Lynch and T. Carberry of West Haven. The score board was fastened to tree near Hale's restaurant, and the course was circle around the grove for a mile. The crowd thiekened fast as the walk progressed, and Specials had busy time to keep the track clear, ,as so many quiet and meditative ladies would persist in sauntering on the track, oblivious of the fact that three perspiring pedestrians were bearing down directly upon them. Among the spectators here and there were prominent business men of the city and many pienickers from out of town. Hawley, the eolored man, took the lead at the start and Mccormick made it lively for all by his energetic spurts of speed. Niekerson went easily and in the l srly stage of the walk was well n the rear, but closed up the ""a p near the 9th mile and was making it lively Or the two competitors who were put to heir best to keep up their advantage. The con est. a11ts were frequently warmly applauded md Ile ladies took great interest in the race The day was not hot and the walk was in the hady grove, but the exertions of the walkists brought out the perspir ation.

THE ELECTION IN MAINE.",,"| A Sweeping Republican Vfctory-The Majority Seven To Eight Thousand Larger Than Two Years Ago-The Legislature Republican And Four Republican COnSressmen. PORTLAND, Me, Sept. 8.-The citizens of 1 Maine to-day elected Governor, four mem ! bers of Congress, thirty-one State senators, 151 State representatives and full boards of

 county officers inthe- whole sixteen counties The gubernatoria1 vote in 1880 stood: Plaisted, fusion, 73,713; Davis, Republican, 3,544; scattering, 545; total, 147, ,902. The presidential vote that year stood: Garfield, 74,052; Hancock, 65,211; Weaver, 4,4O9; Neal Dow, 92; scattering, 139; total, 143,- 9O5, showing Republican plurality of S. 841 against minority of 169 in the guber-

 material election in September. The vote at

 the last State election in 1882 stood: Robie

 Republican, 72, ,481; Plaisted, fusion, 63, ,921; :;

 Chase, Greenback, 1924; Vinton, independ-

 ent Republican, s69; Eustis, Prohibition,

 381; scattering, 1O2; total, 138, 8,479-a Re

 publican plurality of S,560. The campaign which closed at the polls to-day has been

 ably and sharply contested by the Repubi- cans, many of the ablest speak CTS in the party having spent the past month among the pine trees.

 Their canvass of the State has also been the duly impressed with the importance of speak ing loudly for effect on the October States. At to-day's election the Republicans claimed majority of 10000, but hoped for and ex- pected at least 10000. The Democrats, who have made but a weak fight, conceded 10, ,000, but claimed that any ching less than 25,000 would be Democratic victory. The Repub ican vote has gained about ten per cent. in all the sections heard from, which if held throughout the State will give Robie total vote of 79, 900 to 80, 900 against 72, ,481 two years ago. The Democratic vote two years ago was 63,921 and to-day it will apparently be about GA, 900 or 65,000. MT. Blaine claims the State for Robie by 12,000. The returns indicate that it will exceed that and possibly pass 15, 900.

 Fifty-three towns give Robie, Rep, for Governor g, 304; John Redman, Dem., 15, 979; Republican plurality, 7,425. In 1882 these towns gave Robie 20,757; Plaisted, i'd sion, 16, ,426; Republican plurality 4,331; in crease of Republican plurality 3,094.

 Sixty-four towns give Robie %, ,451; Red man F, ,5e4; Republican plurality 1867. In 1882 these towns gave Robie g, 746, Plaisted 18,O57, Republican plurality 5,689; Republi- can gain 2, ,705, about twelve per cent. Democratic loss 473, about three per cent.

 The vote of Portland is: Robie Rep, B. 919; Redman, 3,181; Eustis, Prohibitionist, H. scattering, 30; total 7,023; Robie's ma jority 637. In 1882 the total vote was 6, 462 and Rpbie's plurality was 243.

 The only doubtful congressional district was the first, in which Congressman Reed 1111{ ex-Governor Chamberlain, owing to an al legged violation of civil service reform princi- pies by the supplanting of armed sol dier as postmaster at Brunswick. Fifteen towns, not including Portland, give Reed, Rep, 4, ,735; Nathan Gloves, Dem., 4,870; running well up with his ticket, and his re- election is expected. In the second, third and fourth districts Congressmen Diagley, Milliken and Boutelle are reelected, the only question being as to the size of their ma jor- ities.

 The temperance women claim that they have carried the prohibitory constitutional amendment by over 50,000 majority. There is no doubt about it's adoption, the only question being as to the majority. Twenty three towns, including Portland, Saco and Biddeford, give Reed, Rep, for Congress 11,OS7; Gloves, Dem, 1,167; Cleves' plurality, 80.

In 1882 these towns gave Robie 47,667, Plaisted 4O,367, scat, tering ,2S7; Republican majority 6,013; in crease of Republican majority over 1882, 5,528.

The ChllInn Dummy Having Hard


Time of II as Ruler.","Sn,nlnL LeNm.","Special Letter.


CALLAo, PERU, Feb. ""a. 4 wrote you some
time ago of the taking of tho city of Gaia
marca by. mountainoer named Puga; also
that ho held the city for q while, and then
returned to his mountains. Well, i heard
some time ago that he had reappearod, and
that the brother of President Iglosias Gen.
fglcsias, with quito number of troops, had
been, sont to put him down. Tho next thing
was simple announcement in tho papers
that Gen. lglesus had returned. Nothing
was said of his troops for the very good reason
that he came back without any, they having
joined Puga aitor he had defeated them. Dr.
Puga ho is now called since his successes.


Tho next ominous fact was that 10 cleo
tiOns were held in the northern departments,
and few days ago came the intelligence that
the ports of Pacasmayo aud Salaverry wcro in
tho hands of Dr. Puga, and that no freight
would he allowed to leave here nor pass
through in transit on the steamers for those
ports. IL was useless for lglcsias to send
more troops against Puga, as that simply
meant re-onforCing him and giving
him arms, so then the Chiliaus made
n mistake. They sent 200 soldiers from the
garrison in Chorrilos on board their gunboat
Angamos and sent her to Saavorry to put
down Puga. OF course before they get there
Puga and his men will be leagues away in
tho mountains, and all they will do is fine,
imprison, or shoot unohending citizens for
having allowed Puga to do the same that they
are doing.


The Chilians are trying to make the world
at large believe that lglesias is not their
dummy, but free and independent prcsi-
dent, and that the people arc supporting him,
and that he ought to be recognized by foreign
governments. which would be equivalent to
acknowledging the Chili-Iglcsias treaty.
I,.g t,
Puga shows the weakness of her dummy,
iustiflos all who have refused to recognize
him, and does herself no good, because If she
had quietly waited three weeks longer con-
gross would have met and ratified her treaty
and her army could have gone home, where
they are not wanted, for the people are hall
afraid that large army of such troops as
! theirs are might inaugurate series Of revo'
lutions.


There are about seventy men in Lima who
claim to bo the regularly elected deputies
1t requires a few moro than IA hundred tC
form quorum but as congress here has
often had TO meet without the necessary
number, thanks to revolutions, those prcsen;
assemble, and then they elect, haphazard
enough more members to make the requisite
number, and proceed to transact business
The world at large would not trouble itsel
as to what kind of congress ratified Chilis
treaty, and Peru will not be strong enough
to successfully rcpudiate it by taking forci
| BILE possession ot her guano and nitrate de-
posits for many years. but if Chilli, by send
| ing armed forces to put down all opposition
to her dummy, forces foreign nations to SET
his impotence and that of his so-called con
gress she can expect no sympathy from otheI
nations when Peru Is strong enough to pay
her back, if she ever is.


/ have just been reading two copies of IL
| NnCud Era, small sheet published in Tru
.illo, where Puga has his headquarters, thu
| Era being his organ. 1t is perhaps unneces
sary to remark that my papers di d not cont
through the mails, being none the less inter
csting for that. One contains lon patriotic
! proclamation, headed, Proclamation. Th
political and military chief of the depart
ment of the north to the people of fETruiill
and all the people of the department of Ii
LibGrtad."" In it he announces his adhesion
to the Caldcron presidency aud to Gen
Caceres, as its representatives abuses Iglessa
and the Chilans, and swears to free his coun
! try. He probably thoroughly enjoys abusin
lglesias, as there is bitter vendetta botweeI
the two families. There is also piece O
poetry dedicated to tho ""Redeemers,"" an,


written by Hisriato de Brehom.


The second paper contains most friendl


letter from taceres to Puga, in which he say
that he has $500 well armed men who will
be faithful to the death9 and $4,000 enthu
siastic guerrillas as an auxiliary force. II
also says that Igesias shall fall future tense

There were lively times at most of the voting places, particularly so when there were two tickets in the field, the friends of the different aspirants for honors doing their best to get out full vote. In some of the wards the vote was very close and the anxie- ty of the politicians was apparent by the loud talking while the votes were being counted. From all that could be gleaned at the various wards last evening to the number of votes each mayoralty candidate would receive in convention on the first bal lot would be about as follows: Mills 30, Holcomb 23, Andrews 15. The figures may be changed, however, even before the conven tion meets, as delegates to city and town conventions are often very uncertain.

 So far as the town ticket is concerned it is very plain that the town agent, town clerk and other members of the present board will surely be renominated.

 FIRST WARD. In this ward there was no excitement to speak of There was but one ticket in the field, and that represented Mills for Mayor, h6YnOlQS TOT COWn aReuG, IluSO 1OE IOMu clerk and O'Keefe for registrar.

 BATAVIA, Jan. 31.-At the conclusion of MT. North's summary in the Powell trial Judge Haight began his charge to the jury. The judge was one hour and five minutes in the delivery and was strictly impartial Dur ing the delivery Rowell's eyes never left the face of the judge and his face as usual gave no sign of his feelings. After explaining to the jury what constituted excusable and inex- cusable killing the judge called especial atten- tion to one feature of the law. He said: ''Where the slayer has been attacked and is in fear of bodily injury or death at the hands of the assailer, or if such man has like fear for his wife's safety, or his daughter or sis ter, he may kill him. Or if a man finds an- other attempting to forcibly wrench from her her virtue he may kill and be justified; but where two are engaged in adulterous practice with the consent of <the wife, then the man cannot kill and be justifed.'' The judge then touched upon the reconciliation of 8 murderous act. He also described and defined the crime of manslaughter in the. first degreel and then carefully reviewed the testimony and the various branches of the defense, closing by saying: ''It is for you to say whether the defendant was in 8 state of mind that would recognize the difference be- tween right and wrong. You must consider carefully the whole testimony. If he knew that he was doing wrong, or if he was not acting in defense of his life, you must find him guilty. If he did not know that he was doing wroEg, or if he was acting in defense of his life, then you will acquit him."" The judge was asked by Judge Sutton to charge. 'If Lynch came at Rowell and Rowell having great fear of bodily injury feared and retreated and in the darkness kept firing under the belief that Lynch was still following, then, if Rowell killed him by shooting him in the back or shoulder blade, it would still be self defense"" which was accepted, as were also a number of other things that MT. Sutton ampliied, although already covered by the charge given.

 The jury retired and the court took a re- cess until D. m. At 1880 p. m. the jury entered the court room, the seats and aisles being at the time filled. The clerk asked, Gentlemen of the jury, have you agreed upon 8 verdict?"" The foreman answered, ''We have;"" and in reply to whether it was guilty or not guilty replied, Mot guilty"" burst of applause rang out lasting nearly a minute. The judge asked whether the prisoner had been acquitted on the score of insanity. Mir. Town, the foreman, answered: ""We find that E. N. RowelI acted in self-defense."" ""Then,"" said Judge HaiRht,' T see no reason to hold the prisoner longer and he is dis charged"" .

 From the foreman of the jury it was learned that on the first ballot as to "" neither Powell was guilty or not guilty, the jury was unanimous for acquittal, and as to the ground the ballot WAS again unanimous for self defense. Partner Palmer was among the first to congratulate Rowell. Ro~elis greeting in return, however, did not appear to be over cordial Powell at once repaired to the Washburne House. Mrs Powell is still here. Horns are blowing and an i'm mense fire is lighted at the head of Jackson street. When the result was announced to Mrs. Powell she expressed herself much pleased and appeared much elated. A crowd is now burning Palmer, RowelPs partner, in efigy' on Main street. Late last night he was hung in effgy in full view of his place of business and of the room occupied by Judge Haight at the St. James Hotel. The figure was a very correct representation of the man, and was suspend ed on wire across the main street, Across the legs board fastened bearing the words: s'Sneak Palmer, author of the crime"" It was removed this morning by the sheriff. but not before many had seen it and it had served it's purpose."

Further Particulars OF the City


Of Columbus Disaster.


BosTos, Mass. Jan. l0.-Ths survi-
vorp OF the City of Columbus disaster,
saw one boat, containing seven women
upset by sea, which soon demolished
the boat. 1t was fearful the way the
women were swept away. Some rushed
on deck with their husbands, and, as
the full force of the storm broke upon
them. realizing that all was lost, they
threw their arms around their husbands
necks. bade them goodbye, and few
moments later they were swept over.
board. A mother with q child held
tight in ber arms, was borne away by
the waves almost before reaching the
deck. Not one woman reached the rig
ging, the majority having been washed
overload by the waves. Anumber were
probably smothered in their bcrths.
After the vessel struck, quarter
master came and said the vessel was
making water. He then got oil the boats
ready, but the ship listed, aud as oil
could not get on the starboard side, some
were washed from tho port side into the
sea. Devils Bridge is formed like q
shepherds crook. 1t begins near the
shore just north Of the light and runs
westerly about half n mile, then extends
on in northerly direction few hun
dred yards further. The buoy marking
the outside Of the rock is distant about
quarter of mile from the west end of
the reef and not over three quarters of
mile from the shore. 1t is not usual
for steamers bound from Boston as far
south as Savannah to take the course
pursued by the Columbus. They gen
orally sail south OF Nantucket. giving
the dangerous shoals, extending fifty
miles south of that isl md,

Ia Captain Wright, in layin, his
course for the ocean, departed from the
usual course too soon, steering relatively
northwest, course which brought him
inside the buoy marking the outside Of
DEVILS Bridge, consequently full upon
the reef. Edward Sprague Rand, who
with his wife, is among the lost, was one
| of the oldest and best known convey.
ancers of Suffolk county. and nearly rs
years of age. He was graduate of
Harvard in 1928. Oscar Iasigi, Consul
General for Turkey for the last seven
years. also Treasurer Of the vassalboro
Wooden Mills, was 3S years of age. Mr..
and Mrs. Wright, of Lynn, are among
the lost. Wright was q brother Of Col.
Carroll D. Wright, Chief of the Bureau
Of Statistics and Labor, and one of the
hest known men in Lynn. DIR. Horace
C.. Bartlett. Of Lyndon, Vt, and wife,
were going to Florida, on account Of Mrs.
Barilett's health. DR.. Bartlett was a
son of ex-Congressman Thomas Bartlett,
aud about so years old. Mrs. Dwight

not appear on the passenger list, be-
cause she was making the voyage as the
guest of the Captain, was among the

steamer was saved, and only one of their
bodies has thus far been recovered.


The ..Tribune"" and '.VVOrld"" on the


Failure of the Mexican Treaty.


New YORK, Jan. l9.-The Tribune
says, on the failure of the Mexican
treaty, that the objection to it has come
chiefly from the sugar, tobacco and
hemp growers, who believe their inter
ests would be severely damaged by let
ting in these articles free. The vote as
finally taken may be considered as rep
resenting the views of the friends of pro-
lection.


The World says severe blow was
dealt to the Southwestern railroad sys-
tenn and its attendant speculative enter
prises, by the failure of the treaty. A
number of spectators had made condi-
tional purchases of rich l,nds in North
ern Mexico, suitable for raising sugar
and tobacco, hoping that their value
would be increased from one to twenty
dollars an acre by the ratification of the
treaty. They had so carefully worked
up their schemes that the treaty lacked
only one vote of ratification.

A Pair of Human FIends Lynched


DENVER, Col, Jan. l9.-Some three
months ago Mary Rose Matthews, a
bright, winsome little girl of 10 years,
was adopted from the Denver Cathedral
Orphans Home by Mike Cdddigan and
wife, living on ranch ten miles from
Ouray, small mining town in the
southern part of this state. Last Sat.
utday little Rose suddenly died and was
buried by the Caddigans in distant
part of the ranch. The little girl had
been cruelty treated from the
first, the neighbors said, and her
mysterious death and hurried burial
aroused suspicious and the coroner of
Ouray was notified. He re. aired to the
ranch, found the grave, and exhumed
the body, when unmistak cable evidence
of her cruel death was revealed. The
body was covered with wounds. One
leg was broken. the skull crushed and
the limbs frozen. She had no doubt
been driven into the storm to die. Cad
digan and wife were arrested and lile1
Yesterday they We're tr ell and found
guilty of murder. About one O'clock

men went to the hotel where the
Cadiigans were temporarily held in
custody, overpowered the Sherirs
guard and took the prisoners away.
They both pleaded loudly for mercy,
but as their ears had ever been deaf to
the pleading OF Rose for mercy, so the
vigilantes closed theirs to the cries of
the prisoners. They were taken out

was hanged to the ridge pole of a vacant
cabin, while the husband was strung to

| humorous as anything in Dickens. In the Blythe
will case n Young girl is being put forward as the
daughter of the dead millionaire and chief heir to
| his coin, but her legitimacy Is dubious; and what
casts more doubt her is the fact that her guar
dian Is an English Qusck and astrologer. The
mother of the girl, hard-featured Engllshwoman
of the working class. tried to be dramatic in
court, but failed miscrably. She ac-
knowledged never having been married
to Blythe, but produced a number Of
letters written by him. nquiring about the child
The claim of the opposing counsel is that Blythes
child is dead, and that the girl produced now is
spurious heir. As there are more than score of
heirs the lawyers will get good slice Of what re-
mains 10 be divided.

to his bad record by the wholesale pardoning of
prisoners ont of san Quontin. One of the latest
cases is that of O woman who conspired

Beyond it rested an article to which all eyes had been directed. It was hid from

 view by covering and was an elegant Rogers group, which was to

 be presented by the employees to Messrs. Bolton & Nicely. The grand march was opened shortly before 9 o'clock, led by Assistant Superintendent J. A. Don- nelly and Mrs. H. o.

The only business for which the Commissioners
Of Emigration met yesterday was the awarding OF
contracts for certain exclusive privileges at Castle

TIL nearly o'clock, and was an excited one. the
Commissioners indulging in cutting personalities,
insinuatons and lllngs at each other. Mayor Ed
son, who is ex Oici0 a member OF the Board, was
detained at the CITY Hall looking after municipal
affairs. Commissioner Forrest was kept ut home
by sickness. Commissioner Lynch, after voting TO
the eontrast for the exchange brokerage to give I'VE
meeting, owing to business engagements. The
compliments of the season exchanged between the
Commissioners were soon forgotten, and Commits
siOner Ulrich who was IN the minority, or, as
termed by the Others, the kicker suggested
that the votes the contracts showed that every
thing was cut and dried before the meeting"" 1t was
also intimated that Commissioner Stephenson, IN
voting to take away the privilege Of the Castle
Garden Express from Bernard Biglin should feel
m Vdns ss sr a I Wor%e or s r
as Mayor in the recent campaign. IL was SAID also
that Commissioner Taintor voted against NJ, Big
lin to give an indirect blow at d"" johnny OBrien.
with whom he is said to be in enmlty.


Commissioner Stephenson aDdlStarr submitted the
majority report of the Committee on Contracts
to the highest reputable bidders :"" that they file
their bonds or before Monday, or the contracts
be given to the next highest 'reputab e' bidders.
Finally the majority assured the Board that they





siOner llauselt submitted the minority report of
the committee in which he regretted that he could
not agree with the majority and concisely gave his
reasons. He thought that efforts should be made
to provide help for immigrants and to provide them
with necessarcs ut the lowest rates rat her than to
encourage high prices in order to give large pr0hts
10 those holding the privileges that they might pay
high rents. He wished the baggage expressage
gwen to the New York Transfer Company, which
offered S3 800 year for It, that company having
every facility. The restaurant privilege
he wanted 20 be awarded to Renke u liertzb0rg at
their bid of 81 200. with a promise to reduce the
present schedule of prices 20 per cent. lie Thought
that the interests of the Commissioners and OF the
immigrants would be best subservcd If the contract
for the exchange business was given TO two per-
sons instead of to one.

Casey had passed through the aperture he made Tn the grating above the cells by springing an Iron bar from its socket. and was quietly sitting on the top of the further end of the cells. Knowing that another pistol was missing, they called to him to come forward and throw up his hands, at the same time leveling their pistols upon him. He came down the ladder from the top of the cells and dodged into the vault at its foot. He refused to come out until four shots had been fired through the light wooden screen partition of the vault, which passed over his head, he having crouched down to Its floor. On coming out he told the guards that the pistol was in the closet of the sink, and 1t was found where he said 1t was.

coin, was chosen. Here the party chose
that great chieftain, General Grant. Here
it nominated that honored soldier, that
great statesman, that representative citizen,
James A. Garfield. Cheers.] Every
action OF the party on this historic ground
had been followed by victory. Having sue
cceded against its opponents on all former
occasions it was about to put its house in
order for another conflict. AS a con-
sequence Of a vote adopted by the last con.
vention, the present body is largely formed
OF men instructed by their own constitu.
cnts. and it was therefore to be hoped that
the voice of the people would be largely
puissant in its deliberations. [Appla.se.
lie closed with an expression ot hope for
victory, and proposed for temporary chair
man the Hon. Powell CLAYTON, of Arkansas.

mentioned the name Of Mr.. Clayton, Mr..

name as one acceptible to the Republican
convention. Silas b. Butcher Of New

y warm debate ensued. The roll call
was then proceeded with. When It was
announced that Lynch had 43l votes and
was elected temporary chairman, over
Powell Clayton. who had 3S7, a scene OF
tine Widest confusion ensued. Delegates
rose in their seats, cheered, swung their hats
and shouted. The spectators joined in the
demonstration. On motion OF Clayton the
vote was made unanimous.


The vote Of Montana was: For Clayton,
Wilbur F. Sanders; Tor John X. Lynch,
Lee Mantle.

A SOLDIERS WIFE AND MOTHER SOLD INTO


BONDAGE


The National President is in receipt Of let
ter from Comrade John Arthur Lynch form
erly Captain Artillery Brigade Fifteenth Army
Corps whose present address is 106 / street,
Washington, ID. c., to the substance of which
she calls the attention of any who can send her
any additional facts in the case. Relief from
this terrible bondage must be given this poor
woman. Comrades of the Grand Army, will
you help to do itf The following are extracts
from his letter:


TAKEN TO A LOGGING CAMP.


In the Cincinnati Commercial Gazette of the sth
of June last, there a very painful and graphic
description OF the sale at public auction the 9Th
of June, at the town of La George, Tucker Co, w.
Va. of several indigent persons consisting of men,
women and children sold on account of their pow
erty, and among them is described one poor woman
who was put upon the auction-block, as in slavery
times in slave State, and sold for seven or more
dollars, and taken by the purchaser to logging
camp. The poor woman is described as being IN
great distress at her shocking situation and praye
to God to release her from her sufferngs by death
at the same time she declared that she WAS the
widow of a Union soldier, who died for his coun-
try and the mother OF another who also fell fight
ing that the Republic might live. By calling at
tention to this mode of dealing with the poor and
friendless, you may help put stop to the sale of
human beings for being impoverished.


ANNA ELLA CARROLL FUND.


The National President, Woman's Relief
Corps, approves of the proposition Of the COM
rade who writes as follows. and it also meets
the approval of the committee TO whom the
letter has been referred, who will prepare a
brief memorial to be submitted to the Posts
and Corps of the GAR. In the meantime, con-
tributions to this most worthy object will be
received directly by the National President
from all who choose to forward in such sums as
they may see fit. Anna Ella Carroll is in great
need; funds must be secured to enable her to
avail herself of hospital treatment at once, or
a woman who spent health, strength and for
| tune for her country must die of discourage
| ment and neglect.


DEAR Mrs SHERWOOD: I viii make a motion
that we old soldiers, readers of The TRIBUNE, con-
tribute 10 cents piece for the benefit OF Miss Anna
Ella Carroll. Ten cents is not much. Each one OF
us can get along one day without smoking cigars
for her benefit. So here goes 10 cents for her

that another Legion OF Select Knights.
A. o. u. W., would bs organized at Po-
mona ON Saturday night last, by Los
Angeles Legion No. !. the first Legion
established ON the Pacific Coast. At that
timo 1t was supposed that the newly Or
ganized Legion would be No. 2, but Of
icial information came that San Fran
cisco aud Oakland had each organized a
Select Knight Legion within about q
week, making Pomona Legion No. ON
the coast. The time Of departure for
Pomona was fixed for five and half
o'clock In the afternoon, and a HERALD
reporter was invited to go by the special
train, aud take notes OF the exceedingly
interesting proceedings.


About live o'clock forty Of the mem
bers Of Los Angeles Legion No. |, Select
Knights A. o. U. W., marched from
their headquarters in Odd Fellows Hall,
preceded by the Eagle Corps Band, to
ths new depot, where the special train
WIS waiting. The uniform Of the baad
was Ia great contrast with the varied
uniforms Of the Select Knights. The
Officers had soldier caps, silver banded,
and with elaulets on their shoulders.
The uniform of the majority Of the
Knights, with their swords, gloves,
handsome uniform and red plumss in
their chapeaus, attracted much atten.
tion during their march to the new dc.
pot aud embarkation. Ihere were forty
members In line, but several other
Knights joined the delegation at the de.
pot, making over fifty in nil. The train,
consisting OF engine No. |. ). Z. Of A,

the train would not stop and night
make very fast time. But no, II was
thirty three miles to Pomona, and 1t
would take over an hour. But the train
started, with clear track at 5:55 p. M,
railway time, and after the curve around
over the river had been made, Euylneer
Sells pulled out for forty.six miles
per hour. increasing it on the
down grade below San Gabriel station.
A word to Knight or two showed them
that they could not drcss for the march
and installation at Pomona too quickly.


Thirty tive miles an hour Was made
up the steep Puente grade, but near
Curriers' place the speed was resumed.
Only lew people VINO knew the road
told them when they passed Spadra,
when the exodus to the forward car was
surprising. Pulling up ut Pomona, the
baud got out and played, while the
Knights disnounted, drilling for several
minutes, after which they marched out
through the town, escorted by two Po-
mona men whose names had been sub
scribed to the new Legion, to the Hall,

Tightening Around o. A. Carpenter
..-Audicted by the Grand Jury for
the Murder. Of Zura Rurns",,"Sno muruer or Xura Burnss


LINCOLN, Ill. Jan. 28.-The grand jury
found an indictment against Orrin A. Car
penter, for the murder of Zura Burns. This
has been expected all along, although many
thought it unwise to attempt to convict him
with the scant evidence in hand, and dis
approved of the grand jury taking the
matter up now. But the prosecu-
tion has been making dilligent use Of the time
since the prehssinary examination, and from
present indications, have much stronger
case than they then had. Part of the new
testimony is that of Dr. Belfield, Of the Rush
Medical college, who, it is said, will dissent
from the decision of President Wheeler on the
analysis Of the blood spots, and he has also
photographed multitude Of hair-pins, and
is prepared to say that the pins found in Car
penter's buggy and the one found in Zura's
pocket are ""as alike as two pins"" The
lies of Detective Barry, however, de-
tract materially from the weight OF
the heir-pin clew. The latest rumor falls
like blazing fagot among the friends
of Carpenter. It is to the effect that an old
negro lady kept Zura on the Saturday night
and Sunday during which she was missing;
that Carpenter called at the old woman's
cabin on Sunday night and took Zura away;
that day or two after the killing the old
negress suddenly disappeared from Lincoln,
and was subsequently traced to Kentucky;
that her deposition was before the grand
jury, and the old lady herself will be forth
coming at the trial Diligent inquiry failed
to discover the womans name or her present
whereabouts, but an intelligent colored man
assured the reporter in private conversation
that the above story was substantially
true, and that the witness in question would
tell much more when called to the stand.
Reason for not giving the woman's name was
for fear she would be intimidated or got out
of the way by the defense.


When the Indictment was returned Car
penter, accompanied by one of his attor-
neys, went to the court room, was called
before the bar, and the document
read to him. He exhibited great distress in
his countenance, but sat down and COM
posedly listened to the arguments on theques-
tion of admitting him to bail. Judge Herd
man decided that, since the jury had found
bill against defendant for murder, the fact OF
such Indictment gave great presumption Of
his guilt, and added, II cannot and will not
admit the defendantto bail. He must go to
Jail. The sheriff will take charge of the pris-
oner.""

citement in the court room.


T. T. Beach, of the defense, was highly
wrathful at what he termed the uncalled-
for emphasis of the court. and let out several
big round oaths at the judge as they walked
down the street.


In conversation with Zura's father the
other day he told your reporter that all
that lay between Carpenter and Judge
Lynch last fall was his Burn's) word. A
crowd, he said, was organized and waited
only for his consent. A repetition of the
circumstances may not result as safely to Car
penter, and guilty or innocent, he is in bad
row of stumps. The die is rapidly casting."

hands to get out piling-having q


contract TO furnish same to the gov.
ernment. A raft was Aoated down


from shove and landed after night,
at what was thought to be Ayres'


landing, but which proved to be op.
positc D. w. Lynchs land. During
the night, Is an sct Of neighborly
kindness, the raft was cut loose by


Lynch; the logs were Lost, and two
Of the hands came near losing their
lives while attempting to save them.


At the last term of the Circuit Court,


d. w. Lynch was indicted by the
Grand Jury for cutting the raft loose,
since which time, it is said, he has
sworn vengeance on Capt. f. NJ.
Ayres. D. w. Lynch was in town
Thursday, drinking, when Ayrcs al.
50 came in on business; accidentally
meeting, Lynch commenced to curse
and abuse him. Ayres tried to shun
and avoid him, laughed At him as he
told him that he wanted no trouble
with him, that he was drunk, and to
wait until he got sober; but all to no
purpose; still no pursued him, cursed
and abused him, applied the most
foul and insulting spithets, when
finally Capt. Ayres went into the
nearest public house-Mr. Garlicks,
thinking to avoid him; but there he
was followed, and with . drawn

abuses were continued rs be pressed

The permanent chairman read brief ad-
dress from manuscript. in which, after re-
turning thanks for the distinguished honor
conferred upon him he said:


1t 10 my good fortune to have known Mr..
Blaine intimately over 80 years. l have
watched his career during that time with un.
usual interest, and have never known any
one actuated by purer motives or governed
by higher standard of morals. His lofty
potriOtism and splendid abilities are
recognized and acknowledged everywhere.
He il always on the American side of every
question. These virtues and these accom-
plishments account for his wonderful magnet
ism and for his nearness to the hearts of the
American people. l have not the honor of q
personal acquaintance with Gen. Logan. but
who in this broad land does not know of his
magnificent order as . soldier and grand
career IS . statesman. The democratic par
ty must be held to its record on free trade
and tariff for revenue only. Too many yet
live who remember languishing trade, scant
employment and poor wages, and the burn
ing of corn in the west for fuel because there
was no other use for it, under the democratic
administration to vote for . party which
threatens a return of that condition of af.
fairs. Our people believe that reasonably
prosperous times are attainable in this coun-
try. The working classes especially ask,
claim and demand that they shall continue
to have an opportunity to earn such wages as
will enable them to live as American citizens
should. With such candidates and such
principles as are set fourth in our platform
success is assured. Victory will be ours in
November as surely as the sun will bless us
with its light.


Secretary Fessenden read a communica-
tion from the Young Mems Republican Club
of New York city, suggesting that they would
be able to contribute to the election of the
republican candidates in November. Sena-
tor Chafee reported in behalf of the sub
committee to select headquarters in New
York that No 242 Fifth Avenue could be Sc
cured. The report was accepted and the
subcommittee was instructed to consummate
arrangements for that house.


The committee then adjourned, subject to
the call of the chairman, and the meeting of
the executive committee was held in the
same room.


The executive committee organized perma-
nently. with ex-senator Chaffee ~ chairman
and Geo. w. Hooker of Vermont a. secre-
tarv.


Mr.. Hooker is secretary and B. F. Jones
chairman Of the finance committeet which
adjourned subject TO call of the chsirman.


1t was decided to occupy the new head
quarters at 242 Fifth avenue, Immediately.


The executive committee delegated full
power to the sub-committee to act during
recess. The subcommittee consists of
Messrs ChafYee, Elkins and Hobart 1t is
understood that these three gentlemen will
supplement the work of the chairman on
actively organizing.


At the meeting of this sub b-committee to.
night it was resolved to add to the member
ship Conger Of Ohio and Clafkson of Iowa
to have more especial care of the committee
and the party's work In the western states."

The temporary chairman having announced
that it was 10 order to select permanent OH
GERS, HAYNES of Maine moved that the chair
appoint q committee Of three to nominate
permanent officers. This being adopted, the
chairman named J. Manchester Haynes, G..
A. Hobert and F. E. Morey as committee,
and these gentlemen retired. Pending their
deliberations the national committee at l2. So
took re cess for half an hour.


Among the prominent republicans not
members of either committee. whose faces
were seen in the corridors we're Senator
Aldrich of Rhode Island, Senator Blair of
New Hampshire, John R. Lynch of Missis-
sippi, chairman of the Chicago convention.
Chauncy 1. Filly and others.


The general feeling among all was one of
and upon all sides could be heard
of confidence in the success of
the republican ticket in November next. John
X. Lynch said:


II have not been home since the nomina-
tions were made, but from letters have re-
ceived can tell what the sentiment of the
party in the south i.. The ticket is regarded
as q strong one, and is received everywhere
with satisfa ction. II 10 sure to be an elec-
ton. and will no doubt carry many Of the
southern states.


In virei,ia. North Carolina, Mississippi,
Louisiana and South Carolina the
will without doubt get . ma
jority If it il fair election and fair count,
but We are not sure of any Of these on that
account. The same may be said of Alabama.
and West Virginia, and West Tennessee can
be carried by the republicans if proper effort
is made, as there is no doubt there will be
fair election in those States.


1t is the duty of the republican party to
make an effort to carry some of the States,
and not conceed them to the democrats with
ont q struggle. In regard to Mississippi
can say that there is . marked improvement
in public sentiment among all classes in the
State in favor of protective tariff which in
dicates that q majority Of the people are in
sympathy with the principles of the republi-
can party""


D. Cole. of Florida, said that the repubIi-
cans could carry that State il they made an
effort, a. there vas great dis satisfaction
among the democrats in that section and
Blaine vas very popular there.


NJ. W. Garry. of Galveston, Texas. col
ored delegate TO the Chicago convention, said
that although his State was democratic, there
was every procpect that the majority would
be greatly diminished this year.


The republican ticket is very popular
among the young, and viIl be supported By
many young democrats. In his opinion, the
republicans would carry North Carolina.

for the fact that Chlcsgo Is never quiet
/ would say tha. quietness has pre-.
vaded our city since the departure Of
the great Republican host, but
could not say this and be strictly
true. While there is less noise, less
Of the busy hum Of voices and fewer
people in the corridors of the hotels,
yet the hotels are well filed, and the
only people enjoying any relaxation
are the bartenders and walters. The
smoke has cleared away, and in going
over the late field of battle broken
pledges; broken gamblers, handker
chiefs soilcd with the tears OF mad
and disappointed delegates and wire
pullere, and here and there are traces
of oaths uttered by delegates soon
after the third ballot. Al Of these
things remind the casual observer
of the late contest which will take its
place in history as the most remark
able National Convention ever held
by any party. TO the co!ored people
Of America especially will it be re-
membered as one step higher upon
the plane they are yet to occupy,
while the elevation OF one OF the race
TO the high position Ct the presiding
officer over the deliberations of nearly
a thousand men representing the
brain and wealth and the power of
the greatest party in the world, sit
ting in the midst of his colleagues
presiding With calmness, dignity and
intelligence with twenty thousand
pairs Of eyes watching his every me
ton, is an honor long to be remem-
bered. The colored people are not
going to become intoxicated over
thing the Republican party could
easily afford to do when it is remem-
bered what it cost such men as
Lynch, Bruce, Pinchback, and host
OF others in the South, to sustain its
standard. On looking into the great
exposition building | found that ex-
tensive preparations are being made
for the Democratic convention, which
meets here shortly. Larger accom-
modations are being made for the
press and for the outside crowd
There won't be any scarcity Of tick
cts to this convention. as the boys
want crowd and they don't care
who is in it. Such a crowd of the
unwashed. unterriied and unkempt
as it is expected will be here cannot
be imagined All the hotels will
take on an extra force of bartenders.
There will not be any need of SC
many walters, as the mob that Is
coming are unused to such attentions.
Chaplin and Gore have hoisted in
several barrels of sour mash, while
the fremont House has filled it's eel
lars with '76 Kentucky bourbon.
There were many features of the last
convention that think Of with pride.
Among them the class of delegates
from the South men Of intelligence,
well dressed, honest in their convic-
tions and manly enough to express
them, and any man who could look
upon those colorcd delegates, with
their manly bearing, and accuse them
of bartering away their votes, OF
being ignorant and poorly dressed, IS
mean enough to rob the dead.


Another feature was the number OF
colored journalists. Although not
given seats at the press tables they
were here Pelham and. Anderson,
of the Detroit Pldindealer ; Pied
ger, of the Atlanta, Ga, Elevator ;
Adams, of the Louisville Bulletin ;
Howard, cf the Harrisburg, Pa
STATE JOURNAL; Col. Murrill, OF the
Washington Bee Horn, of the In
dianapolis World ; Barnet, Of the
ConSerydtor, and many others whom
| did not have the pleasure TO meet
But perhaps the greatest feature OF
all was the NJ S. Quay Club, Of
Philadelphia, with a band. A more
manly, genteel or finer appearing SET
of men never walked the streets OF
Chicago. They were the cynocuIe
OF all eyes, and the compliments
passed upon them by white and
colored were numerous The under
taking was big one. To come all
the way from Philadelphia to Chi
cago at their own expense, with their
own sleeper and dining car, accom-
panied by an excellent colored band,
is star in the crown of the movers
of the trip that will shine brightly
for a long time. The people OF Chi
cago only regret that they were not
advised of their coming, for they GER
tainly would have given them re-
ception worthy OF the occasion.
Among those who spared no pains to
make it pleasant for the members Of
the club were Our Derby Boys,
headed by Mr.. Sanford Edwards, the
genial President. and assisted by ].
B. Williams, that excellent fellow,
John Skinner, Jimmie Watson, Jas
Brown, always reliable, and many
other citizens.

A Probably Fatal ARRAY on Penn


sylvauta Avenue Last Evening.",,"syivanta Avenue Last Evening.


Be.ween 8 aud O'Clock Sunday nigh,
Pennsylvsnia avenue was the scene Of an
ARRAY which may result In the death Of
one OF the participants. The situation is
peculiar one, a, though one man now
swstts in jail the result of the victims
injuries, 1t Is by no means certain that be-
struck the blow, nor indeed Is there
any immediate probability Of the guilt
being fastened upon any one.


The parties directly Interested are
Michael Lucy John Dougherty and Daniel
Rearden. The victim, W 10 lives at Ris-
ing Sun. is Dennis Lynch. Dougherty,
Lucy and Lynch are under Reardsn, who
is boss on the B. K P. railroad. The
latter was in the dock Monday morning
charged with being the assailapt.


DR.. Richard p. Greeplesf WAS the only
witness in the case, and he testified that
last evening he was called to see Lynch
and he found that the latter WAS suffer
ing from a long slsnting cut on the
abdomen, and that the knife had pens-
trated the bowels. He thought the
wound was very serious one, and that
peritonitis setting in WAS not improbable,
in which event death would be the
result.


He asked Lynch who out him, and the
patient, who was stupifed, said: ""Rear-
den did it,"" This concluded the DOCTORS
statement. His hesrsay evidence WAS
the only thing against the prisoner.


Resrden was allowed to make a state
ment. He said that last night between
and O'Clock he IVES walking out Penn
sylvania avenue to his boarding house,
when Dougherty called to him to wait.
Looking back he saw Lynch, Dougherty
hnd Lucy. When they came up
with him, Dougher,y said (: 'Resrdsn,
you insulted Lynch's daughter and we
are going to kill you"" 81 thought they
were only in fun"" said the prisoner, land
replied oarelessly Il insult nobody 5""
Without further notice, he said
Dougherty and Lucy drew knives and
sprang at him. He jumped behind
Lynch, and he thinks the victim received
Luoy's knife in the stomach.


Rearden's story is not an improbable
one, and belief in its accuracy is greatly
strengthened by the absence OF Lucy and
Dougherty from court. When officers
went to arrest the defendant, Sunday
night, they found him in bed He is a little
mahb DuiIt huu ID dDuut oD ybhTb
old.


The stabbiug of Dennis Lynch is still
shrouded in mystery, although Rearden
is under $4,000 bail to answer the charge
of being the asssilsnt. In an affidavit
sworn to by Lynch before H. R. Pening-
ton, Esq, as notary public Monday, the
former says that on the night of the
affray, he, with Resrden, Dougherty and
Lucy had been drinking in saloon on
Pennsylvania avenue and they we're on the
Kennett pike when Rearden quarreled
with Lucy and Lynch for not taking his
part in fuss he had on Saturday night, and
that after quarreling with the wounded
man personally he suddenly struck the
treaoherous blow. The wounded man
did not know he was cut until he had
walked some distance snd felt his cloth
ing wet with blood and became conscious
OF psin."

Hotel, from the beautiful and bottomless waters of the bayon Teche. His alligatorship thrived and grew fat in his new home-the court yard of the hotel. He was, however. of very irritable disposition and would show fight at the slightest provocation. How ever, just before tue meeting of the National Republican Convention, the nature and habits of the alligator seemed to have changed entirely. He no longer spent hours in dreamy repose but moved around very lively, as if in search of votes; he even became chummy of the young wild cat chained in the yard near to the fountain. A close observer informs us that the 'gator grew livslier and livel- fer until the news came from Chicago of The selection of temporary chairman. One conli scarcely believe the effect that the news Di oduced upon the round sualian. Tears fell from his eyes like an Arizona cloud burst. His face-that IS to say his jaws opened. and such a plaintive story did it :ell; uotes of disappoin tment and sorrow filled theair. There is no doubt that the poor alligator belonged to an upper crust Of aligatordom, and believed that the great and oily tongued Pinchback should have been chosen in- stead of the honest colored man Lynch, and thereby race of politicians with crocodilian methods kept afoat.

A class Of men, who were very numerous when he first came to London, have now become extinct-those good and respectable gentle men who never got drunk but who were in the habit of getting tolerably mellow.

 ""kelly is not worth the price he asks, /"" says the Charleston News (Democratic). 'He Is even dear at any price. The national De- mocracy, we firmly believe, will be stronger without him than with him. Under no cir cumstances can be be depended on to be true to the Democratic candidates. Under no circumstances will the American people have faith in 8 political party which trades with or relies on Tammany. The time for declaration of political independence has come It is meet and just that when honest Republicans prefer party defeat to national disgrace the undefiled Democracy should be equally conscientious and courageous The Republicans repudiate Blaine; the Demo- crats owe it to themselves to repudiate Kelly. political party which is afraid to cut loose from political dishonesty can scarcely expect to be trusted by the people.

 It is the unpleasant declaration of Chi cago detective, locally famous, that no more than one murder in ten ever comes out. ""Think over the recent known cases"" he says. ""Can you recall one in which the life wasn't taken with shot or blade?"" In other words, the means of killing were such that there could not possibly be any concealment of the crime itself, though the criminal might escape. He held that to prove beyond doubt that the comm onest form of premedl- tated murder-by poisoning-is prach ed to 8 dreadful extent without detection. About the only murders that do come out, he thinks, are those sudden, unplanned ones that arise from passion. ''It may not be a pleasant thing to think of,' he remarks, ''but it can't be denied, that any cool, intelligent person can murder a member of his family by using a poison that doesn't produce violent symp- toms, and run very slight risk of being caught at it. It is my firm conviction that only g small percentage of the murders are distinguished from ordinary de- ths.""

 During the last six months there has been a large increase in the number of murders and suicides in this country over the correspond ing period of last year. The murders com lnitted have averaged nine and the suicides four per day. Sixteen hundred and six per sons have died at the hands of their fellow men, an increase of nearly 500 per cent. over the first six months of 1883. In the roll of states Kentucky and Missouri head the list with 95 each; New York furnished 65, 23 of them committed in the metropolis.

 THE Tobacco Growers Mutual Insur- ance company held their annual meeting for the election of officers, on Saturday, the 29th of March. The meeting was largely attended, and notwithstanding the fact that the last season was an ex- ceptionally trying one to insurers, be- cause of the heavy losses sustained by the company, and the consequent neces- sity tor an assessment of the premium notes, there was hearty and unani- < nous indorsement of this organization S of tobacco growers for mutual protec- tion against damage by hail to the grow ing crop.

 This company has done business four years and has paid all claims in full and to the entire satisfaction of those insur- CTS who have been so unfortunate as to have their tobacco damaged or ruined by hail.

 The season of 1883 was undoubtedly the most disastrous to the tobacco crop from hail alone, of all the years during the history of tobacco growing on this continent; this company having had as many as twenty-five losses in single day, and the fact of their being able, through iudicious management, to pay all losses occurring in such an extraor- dinary season, establishes the company on sound basis and commends it to the patronage of every thoughful and intel igent grower of tobacco.

 It is no longer an experiment. It has evidently come to stay. When the company was first organized, the insur- ! ance of tobacco against damage by hail was a new idea, which had never been put into practical operation and like all new projects, especially if they have any merit in them, 1t was met in many in- stances with hesitation, distrust and the ominous shake of the head. The croak- CTS predicted its speedy failure, but it has passed through most severe ordeal perhaps the critical period in its exist ence, and it is not dead yet.

 It has at least been shown that tobacco insurance is of great practical importance to tobacco growers. and that 1t can be successfully accomplished.

 The officers who initiated and inaug- erated this company were of course without practical experience in this particular business and 1t would not have been strange had they made some mistakes. It would have been still more marvellous if they had not met with the criticisms and oppositions of the chronic fault-fnders. But notwithstanding all the difficulties and unfavorable circum- stances they have had to contend with, they seem to have conducted the busi- with intelligence, prudence and energy.

 The object of insuring tobacco in this company IS the same as any insurance. The company agree to protect the in- sured against certain losses and for this protection he agrees to pay certain equivalent consideration. The note he gives. is not given as an investment which is to be returned with interest and dividends, but as qaid pro quo. He has received the value of his premi- nm by the company assuming the risk. This main object this company has met in every instance. All losses have been paid in full, and the company has therefore fulfilled all their contracts, and the main object of it's organization.

 THE riot ct Cincinnati has been quel- led, and business resumed, yet the city will be guarded until tomorrow. The latest reports state that 39 persons were killed, and 120 known to be wounded, but the slightly wounded went to their homes and their number cannot be ascertained.

 William Berner, the self confessed murderer of William H. Kirk, last De cember, has been on trial at Cincinnati. Two weeks were occupied in securing a jury, and nearly two weeks in taking the evidence and summing up the case. The defence vainly tried to shut out the damaging confessions of the prisoner. Last Friday the jury rendered a verdict of manslaughter. Judge Matthews re- marked to the jury that the verdict was an outrage"" Public sentiment was in favor of hanging the murderer and an indignation meeting called by the leading citizens was attended by 10000 people. No inhamitory speeches were made, but resolutions were passed con. dening the verdict, and on the adjourn. ment of the meeting, the crowd, led by few rash men proceeded to the jail, determined to lynch Berner. From that time riot commenced, with results as above, stated Berner had been remov' ed fnpm the jail to Columbus, but the rioters were not aware of this. They nearly destroyed the jail, burned the Court house, and destroyed hun dreds of thousands of dollars worth o property."

Poisoned-Three Dead and the Others


Not Expected to Live-A Neighbor Sus-


pected of Having Placed the Poison in


the Water Bucket.


DALLAS, TEX, Jan. g.


The details of horrible crime come from
the neighboring county of kaufman. A
poor, but honest and respectable, family
named Byrd have resided several years
past near Kaufman, renters of the farm of
DIR. Bennett. Last Thursday night one after
another of the family, beginning with the
father, was attacked with violent spasm-
like sickness until seven out of the nine
members were prostrated at the point of
death. Medical aid was summoned. Ev-
cry symptom indicated poisoning, and the
treatment was for that specific kind Of
sickness, emetics and otaer antidotes being
administered, but to no saving purpose.
By Sunday evening last the father and two
of his little daughters were corpses, and
four other members of the family were not
expected to live through the night. The
theory of the poisoning is that whatever
article was used was put in the family wa
ter-bucket about Thursday evening
as investigation established the fact
that every one or the SICK had
drunk from the bucket, while the
two who were not stricken had not tasted Of
the water. Who the poisoner is has not
been thoroughly established, but farmer.
name not learned, is strongly suspected
The reasons for suspecting him are that a
few weeks ago one of the Byrd boys wore
suit of clothes of the accused without his
consent to attend circus at Dallas. He
had young Byrd tried before justice OF
the peace for theft. Byrd was acquitted
and set free. IIl-feeling has since existed,
and the accused is said on several occa
sions to have threatened to have revenge
for what he terms persecution Of himself
by the Byrds. The dead have all been kept
in the house awaiting results of the other
sick members, that post-mortem examina-
ton may be made on the bodies of all, that
the fact Of death from poisoning may be
fully established and material for criminal
prosecution secured. Sheriff Wilson, who
arrived in Dallas this afternoon from Kauf-
man, saws that two more of the victims are
undoubtedly dead, as they were given up
by the physicians at late hour lasG night.
He saws the affair has created great excite
nient in the community, and the most ex-
treme feeling against the suspected parry,
against whom strong threats of lynching
are freely made. He had not been arrested
when Sheriff Wilson, left Kaufman this
morning, but it was probable that he
would be, or surrender to the authorities
for safety during the day."

New YORK, April 5.-The Socialists
labor meeting at Cooper Union, to con-
slider the Cincinnati riot, was an imposing
affair. Three hundred policemen were
on duty about the building. The presi-
dent of the meeting said their party was
opposed to riots or violence. Resolutions
were passed declaring that the Cincin-
natl riots were the result of political and
judicial corruption, and that the Social

chairman stated that Most would not

TOLEDO, Ohio, April 6.-The CONNER
cial Telegram will tomorrow publish a
remarkable letter from distinguished
citizen of Cincinnati, giving new ver-
sion of the story of the riot He states
that the home papers dare not tell all
that their reporters know about the riot ;
and that the coroner dare not hold an
inquest, because the testimony would
show that there was no mob; no need OF
the military, and no need of them to
open fire. That they fired on an unof-
Tending people, and that such of the
policemen and militia as were shot were
shot by the military; that Sheriff Hawk
ms has no brains, and lost his head; that
the firing was utterly uncalled for and
cowardly and that the bystanders could
not believe that bullets were being fired
until they saw men falling. The letter
is very lengthy and criticizes the entire
management of the governor and his
military staff, speaking with the utmost
severity of the fear and foolishness, and
bloodthirsty frenzy of the sheriff, and
with which he infected the militia.

THE TERRIBLE PUNISHMENT IN-

 ELECTED UPON A CRIMINAL.

The Wonderful Powers of Endurance on the Part of Russian PrIsoner-390 Blows, and then the Mines of siberia.",,"Mazof had murdered man, a woman and little boy. Before the magistrate he had made a full confession of his guilt. A determined attempt was made by the soldiers to mob him while he was making his confession, but it was re- pressed. He was reserved for a much more terrible punishment than that ac. corded by lynch law. He was sentenced to three hundred and ninety-nine lashes with the knout.

 He was marched out to punishment in company with two forgers, all St. Petersburg turning out to witness the spectacle. This horrible show is thus graphically described by the old chroni- cle:

 'The stake prepared for him was a strong block of wood fixed in the ground with three grooves at the top and two rings near the bottom; the middle groove was for the neck, and the two others for the armpits, the rings below to lock round the ankles; about the stake were laid coarse skins, especially where the knout-master trod, upon which lay his whips, marking irons, pincers, etc. An officer then read paper to the people, signifying that forgery upon the I'm perial Bank being a capital crime, two of the prisoners convicted of it were condemned to receive eleven blows with the knout, to have their nostrils pulled out and be banished for life to Siberia; the murderer of so many people to re- ! ceive three hundred and ninety-nine blows, to be branded three times in the face. have his nostrils pulled out, and, if then alive, to be banished for life to the mines of Siberia.

 ""The executioner and his assistants then stripped him, tied his hands across and led him to the post. After fixing his ankles they bent his neck and arms over it, and drew the rope with which his hands were tied through the ring on the opposite side, which seemed to stretch all the muscles of the back. He then retired about four or five yards from him, and, taking up one of the knouts, worked it with his hands to give it proper elasticity. Walking toward the criminal with four or five steady steps, then taking a spring, he struck a perpendicular stroke with heavy, loud crack. The first stroke cut from the right side of the bottom of the neck to the left armpik The effect was visible in a moment, and by the violence of his screams afforded reason to suppose that the pain was very great. The second was about half an inch below the first, and so on till twenty-five, when, changing the whip, the operator erased the former wound, striking from the left side to the right, and afterward quite perpendicular. The strokes were given with the greatest regularity. Be tween each a person might deliberately count eight, the executioner always walking slowly to and from the stake. ""His cries were now so terrible that some of the spectators were obliged to turn their backs and put their fingers in their ears. All was quiet and silent, and the crack of the knout was heard a great distance. After receiving three hundred lashes, the culprit's voice grew faint, and during the last one hundred he showed no signs of life whatever, the whole of the upper part of the back be, ing beaten to black mummy. After the last blow the assistants lifted up the face by the hair, and the executionel struck him three times with an instru ment that left the initial of murderer throwing each time handful of blacl dust into the wound; after which, at twC pulls, he tore the gristle of his nose and loosened him from the block. Th' whole lasted about three quarters of al hour, and it was generally thought tha he had been dead some time; however he made a feeble attempt to put on hi coat, and recovered sufficiently to b able to make some reparation to societ. by working the iron mines."

EXPERIENCE OF YOUNG WOMAN IN THE REGENT DISASTER NEAR AMHERST, VA.

She Feels the Car Descend Rt n Rapid Kate, but does not Suspect Danger Brave Men Come to Ihe Rescue.

LFrom the Augusta Ga ) chronicle.l",,"The following extracts are from let ter by Miss Fannie w. M. Platt, now in Lynchburg, to her father in Augusta:

 We left Washington on Saturday on time. l was alone in my berth, mother and Annie were together across the aisle and only little while before we struck the bridge I awoke, sat up and found to my relief it was day, but noticed that We were tearing like mad over the road, swinging SO from side to side that I lay back on my pillow again. In moment I felt great jerks, jumps and fearful turn of the car to one side, back again to the other; and I saw through my. curtains, which, through Gods mercy, had remained nearly closed, that mother and Annie had been thrown out of their berth to the floor. I saw things falling at the forward end of the car, and as we began to go down, down, down, I thought, Great God it has come at last And tore back my curtains. Not seeing mother or Annie anywhere, l commenced calling and begging to know if they were hurt, but could hear nothing from them. I reached back for my crutches. which were in my berth next to the window, thinking must get to mother and Annie somehow. The car settled easily, and Tn some way my window shade went up and I saw that we were in water ard that men were standing on some floating logs. But not for one in- stant did realize where we were, or I would have died then. I turned to spring out of my berth and, to my joy, saw mother standing there, but with a wild, dazed look in her face that to my dying day will never forget. asked:

 ""'Where is Annie Are you hurt ?

 ""Annie stepped to my side, and mother said:

 Something struck my head

 ""Annie said: The water is coming in.'

 ''Some man said Climb to the upper berth

 ""Mother and Annie caught my hands and began to drag me up. We clung to the curtain rods and stood on the lower berth while the water rose nearly to our shoulders

 ""The car seemed to have settled, for the water came no higher, and feeling that we would be saved came over me, but how could not tell, as the ventila- tors in the car-top were the only open- ings that remained above water. They are little frames of glass, seven inches high and about eighteen inches long. The lady and gentleman broke the glass in front of them, and he twisted the | frame from its hinges, making for them, however small, an opening to the beau tiful world outside. Annie broke our glass, but her weak little hands were not equal to the task of twisting the | hinges of what use, anyway, when the outside was covered with a stout wire network that imprisoned us still but our hearts bounded with joy as we heard | the voices of men in boats outside. We | quietly begged them not to leave us and were assured we would be saved. Mrs Farden handed her baby out through the ventilator, and the next thing we saw she was going out of the seYen-inch hole in the quickest possible time. l could scarcely believe my eyes when her husband followed, apparently without an effort, and then a sickening feeling came over me when I saw that we were alone in the car-all had gone. Do uoi think mean to blame anyone. Oh, no | God forbid, for Q truer, braver set o gentlemen never lived. Some one called | for an ax, and told us we would bt saved; then came the first stroke on tht roof with dull ax that a man brought from the shore in the first boat tha came.

 ""Annie very quietly directed them where to cut so as not to strike hel head. I do not think this quietnes' came from our not being frightened SC much as it did from kind of des pair Every stroke of the ax rebounded like mallet, and we wondered how long WI must wait, how long we could wait, fol our suffering from the cold was very great, and it was so hard to have tC stand and see the agony in each other'i face, yet never dare to say a tendel word, fearing it would unnerve them and all would be over. We heard then say:

 ""'Oh, what dull sx; can't you ge hatchet or something better ? | ""At last there was a crash, and th' blessed light shone through; more cut ting and waiting while the lamp was be ing torn out and the floating mattressea and curtains handed out by Annie tha we might pass to the hole. Then on, after the other Annie, myself and moth CT, just as we stood, were lifted from ou horrible prison by noble, brave men | who had worked so hard to save us."

 DAYTON, March 16.-A crime of seven teen years ago has been reached by the death- bed confession of Mrs Catharine Vett that she murdered her own daughter on the evcn- ing of January II, 1867. Cristine Vett, a bright, pretty German girl eighteen years old, was found dead in her mothers house. Her head was pounded into shapeless mass and by her side was bloody axe which told the story. The widest excitement ensued. Several were arrested and narrowly escaped lynching, her lover among them. Her mother seemed frantic with grief and urged Iynching the prisoners In the course of time all the accused proved their innocence, and the crime had been almost forgotten. A week or so ago Mrs. Vett was taken sick, but refused to have physicians. Last Sunday, seeing she must soon die, she called her son and after charging him to keep her secret till death confessed with ninuteness how she had be- come angry at her daughter for remaining out all night with friend and struck her with an axe, killing her. She then so ar- ranged things that no suspicion attached to her and caused the arrest of innocent per- sons. She soon after the confession died."

which newspaper man, Of whatever or

painstaking editor. Typography has

field far more interesting than any which
could be exploited in Congressional MAJ

JACKSON, Miss, Oct 49, Democrats in por-
tioDs of the Sixth Mississippi District, where
Hon. John Il. Lynch, and in the Seventh Dis
trict, where Hon. j. B. Yellowly are Republi-
can nominees for Congress, have begun sys-
tematic intimidation of Republicans. In Will
kinson County, strongly Republican, in Lynch q
district Winchester rifles, furnished by the
Democratic State government, have been dis.
tributed to every Democrat who would receive
them, and a reign of terror is inaugurated. Mr.
Lynch's friends met him on his way to speak
in that county, and implcred him not 10 come
into the county, knowing violence and blood
shed would be the inevitable result Mr..
Lynch thereupon Cancelled all his appointments
In that county.


Last night, in Crystal Springs Copiah coun-
ty, the same county in which Print Matthews
was murdered at the election last year, a Re.
publican meeting was TO be addressed by the
Hon. John b Yellowly, nominee for Congress;
Judge MCMILLAN, Republican candidate for
elector, and Hon. James Hill, collector OF In
ternal revenue. Mr.. Yelowly attempted to
speak, when mob of Democrats threw bot
ties and brickhats, mingled with most oppro-
brlous epithets. He was forced to leave the
stand. Making his escape to hotel, accom-
panied by friend, he wac pursued by the
mob, who continued to throw missiles Of every
description. All Of the party were more or
less bruised, and one mans skull was fractur-
ed from which he will die. Yellowly took
refuge in barber shop, connected with the
hotel, and while doing SO was fred at several
times, fortunately without fatal effect. He re-
mained concealed until the midnight train ar
rived, when he succeeded in eluding the mob
and got away.


1t is not probable the Republicans will poll
many Blaine and Logan votes in Copah and
Wilkinson counties. In the Third, or shooting
district, where Hon. A. G. Pierce is the Re-
publican nominee, and the Republicans have
about Is, 900 majority, the same reign of terror
has been inaugurated by Democrats, who have
distributed Winchester rifles in that district.


leading Bourbon Democratic organs and
speakers in that district openly advocate vio-
lent methods to carry the election. The more
intelligent Democrats have given up all hope
of the election OF Cleveland and Hendricks,
and are directing all their energies to send up
a solid Democratic COMPRESSION al delegation in
order to control the next House of Representa-
tiyes."

Sunday morning when the news Of the
death Of Mr.. Robert s. Lynch, the city
editor Of this paper, was learned. Mr..
Lynch had left the city on Saturday af-
ternoon for short paseo at Santa Moni.
ca. He had been in the best possible
healthand spirits up to the moment Of his
death, and no physical pain or wasting
disease had interfered to give its terrible
warning of that end to which all that is
mortal must come. As announced in
the HERALD on Sunday morning, he had
gone with party Of friends to little
dance that had been given out to take
place at Santa Monica Canon,
and while there, surrounded by laugh.
ing faces, joyous hearts and the merry
music Of the dance, his summons came
to start en- his journey for that
bourne whence 10 traveller returns. The
light Of his life went out, while
the smile Of happiness and entire good
will to all his fellows was still lingering
on his lips. His death was caused by
heart disease, with which his family has
been, in instances. threatened, and to
which an elder brother succumbed sew,
eral years ago.


RoBERr STEWART LYNCH was born in
the city OF Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. ia
August, 1884, Of Roman Catholic pa
rents. His father. Major David Lynch
was the bosom friend OF President
Buchanan. and staunch and leading
Democrat. The friends II his father
were the most eminent Statesmen of the
country, in consequence Of which the
son at an early age was brought in con
tact with the greatest intellects and
most refined men OF the national capitol,
to which he removed in his early man.
hood. Mr.. Robert Lynch commenced
his newspaper career as member of the
press Of Pittsburgh, in which avocation





his employers always found him ready,
painstakipg and faithful. Later in life
lie served the Government in the Depart.
ment Of the Interior, with Thomas A.
Hendricks, the present Democratic nom
nee for Vice President, as his superior.
Henry Watterson. the editor of the



Louisville Courier Journal, was for q
time his desk mate. With o change OF
political power 10 the Republican party
ended Mr.. Lynch's career in governmen-
tai employ. His strong sense Of truth,
the inaexible lines Of his great horror Of
deception and rare fidelity to the po-
liticsl faith and principles of his father
prevented his longer continuing any con-
nection with a government office, al
though offered advancement it he would
but be silent as to his political tsnets.
The same upswerving and chivalrous
devotion to his own self respect charac-
terized life which had exactly spanned
a half century. In July, 1872. he came
to California and settled in San Diego,
where he assisted his brother, Mr.. 10.
seph u. Lynch, in conducting the San
Diego World. In 1876 he removed to
this city, where his brother had already
come, and was carrying on the editorial
management Of this paper. For nearly
ten years he occupied the position Of
city editor and business manager Of the
HERALD. into the ownership Of which
hisbrother had come, and was engaged in
the occupation Of the above named posi-
tion when death bsde him put down his
pencil and deafened his ears to all the
cares and troubles Of responsible jour
nalistic position.


Nature had moulded Robert Lynch Of
d clay with which she has ever been all
too sparing in the fashioning Of her sons.
In disposition he was warm-hearted,
affectionate. singularly pure Of purpose
and upright in character. His utter
detestation Of duplicity, his horror
Of dishonesty, his manly alteration Of
truth, and chivalrous reverence Of
women made up character that at-
Dtraoted the admiration Of all who knew
him. To him principle was part and
parcel Of existence. He knew no ex-
cusing Of wrong; he could not turn his
back on right. His love Of children and
Of dumb animals was . deep seated
feeling in his heart, and showed the
springs Of gentlencss Of character
which drew around him many warm
heart. whose silent manliness of grief
could be seen at every turn on the
streets. as the news Of his death spread
from mouth to mouth.


The writer, 10 common with other
friends and his attached employees, de-
sires thus publicly to convey, to the
grisf-stricken brother the profound
sympathies they feel for him in this
timo Of his awful woe. To him, now
standing alone in tho bare forest Of his
life, with the dead leaves Of his affections
lying strewn around. and tho sohs Of bi,
great agony moaning in his ears. goes
out great throb Of love and coincidence
In this hour Of his loneliness. when he
has seen the last chord Of family love
snapped in twain by the cold hand o
Death, let him know that warm hearts
ache for him in his agony, and true
friends hold out to him the fullest vial,"

wish to say now what We have so long be-
lieyed, and that is, that North Carolina is
the best State in the South. There exists a
better feeling between the races, more
Christian spirit obtains among all classes,
and justice in most sections is held more sa-
cred, the law being thereby upheld and sup
ported Now and then horrible crime is
committed by midnight marauders, and
Judge Lynch not unfrequently holds high
carnival in hanging an innocent victim; but
an honest public sentiment does not endorse
such conduct, and it is freely denounced by
the better class of our citizens. But for the
drawing Of the color line during the heated
campaigns, and the consequent ill-feeling en-
gendered thereby, there would be q state of
affairs in the Old North State reminding one
of the millennium. But SO long as drawing
the color line, and the cry of Negro rule
will save the State to Democracy, so long
will the cry be raised. We will be thankful
when something Of a political, or moral, or
religious, or material nature, will be injected
into the campaign to quiet this hullaballoo,
that is valuable only in doing the very thing
which should never be done-arraying the
races one against the other Hot-headed
politicians who seek to subserve their own
selfish ends, regardless of the welfare of the
people, raise this cry to retain themselves in
office, and are often afterwards as intimate
with colored people as with white, and often
times more so. 1t is policy that drives them
to raise the cry. Down with such dema-
gogues and demagoguery, and have some
issue more worthy of place in great cam
paign,


The State Exposition will prove more
than all else the relation that exists between
the races in this State, and whether or not
the old cry of Color and ""Negro rule"" is
not all bosh, delusion and snare.-Senti-
mel (N CO. Iarboro."

 Ravages.

 LYNCHBURG, Nov. 30.-There have been so many conflicting statements concerning the scourge prevailing in the back counties of this State that it is difficult to understand the nature of the plague or the extent of its de vastation. The Scott County Banner, pub lished at Estillville, in the very heart of the infected region, and conducted by reliable and cautious journalist, says in it's issue of Thursday, the first received here, that 150 deaths have occurred in Wise, the adjoining county, within the past few days. ""In Dick enson and Buchanan countless"" it says, ''the disease has ragged with equal violence. There have been numerous deaths in Scott county, though the disease here is now abat- ing""

 Although the nature of the disease is yet undeined the people call it cholera, and were it so it could not be more dreaded or disas- trous The symptoms are described as those of Asiatic cholera, followed by terrible hem orrhage of the bowels, and those attacked either die or recover in week. It is ire quently fatal in six hours, and sometimes in even much shorter period. In most cases the disease visits an entire family and is so contagious that in some instances persons have been left by their friends to die alone. It is estimated that 800 persons have died from the disease in the four Virginia counties named. The more intelligent of the people believe that the disease arises from the drought and poisonous waters, and that it will require heavy rains to check its prog

 DETROIT, Dec. 12-At 5:15 this evening the girls employed in the second story of Gray, Toynton & Fox's candy factory on Woodbridge street were terrified by seeing fire break out in the department in which they were employed. A rush was made for the escape at the front of the building. The upper sash of one of the windows had been lowered and the young women had to climb over it in order to reach the balcony. One in descending slipped and fell to the ground and was seriously injured. Three girls were then seen to advance to the window and then afterward 8 volume of fire and smoke burst over their heads and they were hidden from view. The fremen arrived in large force, but the flames had all ready made such progress that it was some time before an entrance was gained. When the fire in the second story had been partly subdued the bodies of the three girls were discovered One lay in the middle of the floor: her face was badly burned. The oth- CT two were stretched upon benches just be- meath the partly opened window. Their faces were blaekened, but the flames had not touched their bodies. Their names are Miss Annie Lynch, aged thirty; Miss Bertie Mes more, aged eighteen, and Miss Pollglaze. It is rumored that four more girls are miss ing, but up to late hour this report has not been verified. The loss will reach $50,000; partly insured"

rs follows:


""Foo-Cu Sunday morning. Aug. p.
""A good beginning has been made. We
opened fire yesterday, and in four hours
nine Chinese men-of-war and twelve
junks we're sunk and the Krupp battery
commanding the arsenal silenced. Our
loss is six killed and twenty seven
wounded. The fleet suffered no serious
damage except the boiler Of torpedo
boat bursted. The Chinese losses are
heavy. Daring the night the feet was
beset by burning wrecks and logs. The
torpedo cutters will clear all this away
to- day, and afterwards we lombard the
arsenal. We shall not leave the river
before the Goth or 30th. The officers
and men are animated with the greatest
ardor. One Of our torpedo boats sunk a
Chinese cruiser. The vessels which took
part in the action were the Volta (which
hoisted my fagl the Dugay, Trouin,
Triomphane, Vill.,rs, d'Estaing, Astic,
Lyn aud Viper, withtwo torpedo boats. !""

The gamo yesterday was eminently salts.
factory to tho spectators, for it was quickly
played. The fielding in tho main was first
class, the pitching good, and, better than all,
the home club won. The Mets. went to tho
bat and scored two unearnod runs in tho first
inning on two hits fast base runnings, and
errors. In tho fourth inning Troy scored an
earned run on singles by himself Kennedy,
and Nelson. For the homo club Kiley in the
first inning took first on called balls, and by
speedy running worked his way home
whilo the side was being put
out. In the second after Yewell had
struck out, and King had been put out on
first, Morgan hit fly out to Kennedy, which
that usually sure fielder dropped. Barr then
popped up little ay to Troy, which was also
mutfed. These two errors lost tho gamo to
the Metropolitans, for Fennelly then came TO
run to tho great delight of the audience.
From this on Lynch was on his mottle, and
nothing could be done with his pitching, but
the home boys were on their mettle also, and
folded in mastery fashion, holding their
opponents down TO three runs and winning
nicely. Barr pitched in great form, and was
nobly supported. Yewell, Kiley and Humphries
distinguished themselves by taking in mum.

The Chimes question is rarely re-


ferred to not by Californians. The


subject which absorbs their attention


and governs dl their political action is
the rapacity Ii the railroad corpora


tons. The Ihcifc coast is being dev-
astated and laid waste by the gigantic
railroad mono oboly, and the people have
been in turmoil for two wears in their
efforts to headloff the robbers and save
themselves fr1m ruin. The fact that
the ablest and most respectable jour-
nails in Califohia are seriously advocat-
ing lynch law as the only remedy for
the existing Sate of affairs, indicates
clearly that the railroad question is the
one absorbing political issue In that
section.


Blaine is nobriously the friend and
tool of RAILROAD monopolists. His rec
ord is composed largely of railroad
scandals, railroad jobbery and railroad
subserviency. The enthusiastic Blaine
delee alton from California to the Re-
publican Convention was composed OF
men wholly in the railroad interests.


Any anti-monopoly Democrat can
beat Blaine out of sight in California.
Blaine can be beaten there by anybody,
if the Democrats devote themselves to
showing up his railroad record. Cell
fornia does not stand among the Re-
publican States. If not surely in the
Democratic column, she can be counted
as exceedingly doubtful.


AS to Nevada, principles and politics
may be left entirely out of the discus
sion. There are now but 5000 voters
left in the State. and they have no prin-s
ciples. The State is bankrupt, and her
only assets are her three electoral votes,
which are for sale to the highest bidder.
There is no attempt in Nevada to con-
ceal that fact. The votes are for sale
at public auction, and the side which
offers the biggest sack of coin can have
them. Nevada does not care a rap for
the Chinese question, or anv other ques-
tion. Blaine, the devil and Tom Walker
are all the same to her. She sold her
votes to Sharon for half a million, to
Fair for quarter of a million, and is
willing to sell them again for what they
will bring. Nevada is not worth talk
ing about. She ought to vote for Blaine
out of natural sympathy and affinity,
however. Globe."

 George Simpkins, the fireman of the Amboy division train, was almost similarly caught, but escaped with crushed feet though he is not expected to live.

He is short and slight and with rather an or.

He is not at all an ideal Harvard alumnus,
for he lacks that ingrained conceit and grace

stock, his manner and carriage are awkward
and not at all impressive. Mr.. Roosevelt did
not seem anxious to be interviewed yester-
day, but did not refuse to speak Of the issues
Of the convention.

nominee? Mr.. Blaine was not my choice;
From my knowledge of affairs In New York,
and of the wide spread sentiment among the
independent voters, whose decision carries
the vote of the State, Of dissatisfaction with
anything that savored Of the machine, did
not favor either Blaine or Arthur. Mr.. Ed
munds is man whom every one respected,
against whose character not breath can be
whispered, man of integrity, firmness and
most marked ability. He would poll the
whole independent vote, and think the less
rabid party men among the Democrats would
have voted for him In preference to many
pssessis ne-.o~-..s. -.,~,ain.As How was
Blaine's nomination effected? All, that Is q
very simple question to answer. Aside from
his own strength of $50 odd votes that would
stick to him through thick and thin, the
Plumed knight was the second choice of
two thirds of the remainder of the delegates.
AS soon as they saw the nomination of their
candidate was impossible, and Blaine's nom.
ination probable, they focked to him in
body.


A COMBINATION AGAINST BLAINE IMPos-


sIBLE.

Blaine was possible. Do not think we had
not studied the situation carefully. Very

Lynch I felt encouraged, but ID soon trans
pired that to hold the votes cast for Lynch
against Blaine was impossible. have been
asked why Arthur's support was not trans
ferred after the first ballot TO Edmunds or
Hawley. Such a transfer was impossible.
Blaine Is popular In the South as we'll as the
West, and the moment Arthur was with
drawn, many Of his supporters would rush
ut once to Blaine. Our emily hope was to
hold the support Of the different candidates
firm until, If Blaine did not gain, all could
break into rush for some one dark horse.
The enthusiasm for Blaine was too great,
however, and the break came, but for him
instead of against him. The enthusiasm
was tremendous; I never saw anything ap-
preaching IL. Even Curtis smiled, and had
not been so positively for Edmunds, don't

CONSIDERS BLAINE BEATEN.


Mr.. Horace White Of New York stated this
morning that in his opinion Blaine WAS
already beaten, and could never get as many
votes in the convention as Powell Clayton.


The committee on credentials settled the
contests in the first Alabama district by
deciding to seat the two delegates now on the
roll, James E. Slaughter and Frank Threat.
The vote on the proposition to seat the above
named delegates was 29 to Is.


DARK HORSE.


The general impression this morning is that
the chances Of nomination of a man not here
tofore prominently mentioned have been in
creased. The names most freely mentioned
are the two Shermans and Gresham. General
Sherman's reply to ex-senator Henderson is
understood to be peremptory refusal to
allow the use of his name In case Of
break in the Blame column, it is understood
Nebraska will go to Senator Sherman The
eastern delegates are determined to adhere
to Edmunds and as they are divided in opinion
it is likely their strength will be divided
between sherman, Gresham and Hawley for
some time. These managers regard the dead
point of danger for them to be drift from
Blaine to Arthur. II this can be prevented,
they hope for favorable result.


THE '.TRfBUNE's"" pALAvER.


The Tribune this morning bristles all over
with bright articles for Blaine and claims that
there is no cause for encouragement on ac-
count OF the Powell Clayton incident,
which is not regarded az a real
test 1t compliments Lynch aid the
southern colored delegates and boldly
attacks George William Curtis, Roosevelt,
Lodge and others whom it styles political
dudes 1t says the resolution introduced by
Mr.. Pearce to decrease the representation
from the south hereafter, is an ungracious
return for the help received yesterday from
the south.

CHICAGO, June 4.-The situation this
morning is but little changed, although some
of the more aggressive Blaine men claim to
have gained considerable strength during the
night. The opponents Of Blaine regard the
election of Chairman Lynch as a great vic
tory but the followers Of the Maine states
man are still able to extract considerable con-
ISOLATION from the 1856 votes polled by
Clayton.

gates made up on the basis Of yesterday 3
vote. gives Blaine 971 votes on the first ballot.
They predict that he will then gather in
enough additional votes to nominate him on
the second ballot.


George V. Massey is especially hopeful,
saying ""Blaine's showing is surprise to his
friends""


The only thing that can defeat Blaine is a
combination and this ia being founded, as was
indicated in the committee on permanent Or
ganization last night by the selection of ex-
Senator j. B. Henderson of Missouri, for per-
manent chairman Of the convention. Hem
derson is claimed as an Arthur man, but he
stands for the anti-Blaine element generally.


Whether the inchoate combination can be
made powerful enough to overcome Blaines
strength remains to be seen.

PM adelphia Times special.


CHICAGO, June 3.-Tbe surprise oreatsd
last night by the national committees
selection OF Powell Clayton for temporary
chairman OF the convention was rather
collapsed to-day by the rejection OF tina,
selection by the convention. When the
convention met this morning it Was
known to comparatively few what the
Blaine opposition really intended to do in
the matter of the temporary ohalrmanship
There had been great deal OF swearing
about the Clayton selection all through
last night, but it had not got about tuat
anything like an organized opposition
would bs made to Clayton in the coAytn.
tion. The matter was very shr-W.iy
managed by the Eimunds men. 1t Ses
frat determined to make ReslsteI Blal L.
K. Bi uce the OPP osiiion capdidat,, ut
when that came to be- fully
looked over it WAS found
it would not do. The only oil &c
,ion to Bruce was that he held Fede raj
Office. Bruce himself at once declared
that 1t would not do to set him up aud
the reasons were 30 obvious, when the
situation WAS given little ref ction,
that the Bruce scheme WAS abandoned.


For time then 1t looked as II the chance
OF making hopeful opposition to Clayton
WAS gone. An hour or so after midnight,
however, Henry c. Lodge Of Massachu-
setts and Theodore Roosevelt of New
York, got hold of john R. Lynch, the
colored ex-congressman from Mississippi,
and insisted that he should accept the
candidacy against Clayton. Lynch is an
out and-out Arthur man. He raised OBJ
jeotions and was doubtless quite sincere
in the position which he took. Lodge and
Roosevelt, however, sat up the rest oil the
night with Lynch and finally persuaded
him to consent.


ANOTHER BLAINE BLUNDER.


Another important point was gained by
tie anti Blaine men in their successful
efforts for delay. They protractsd the
debate to-day solely to prevent the
convention from reaching ballot to-
morrow and they practically exhausted
the day In the election OF temporary
chairman. They can now delay ballot
until Thursday and that does not promise
we'll for Blaine. 1t was delay and bad
leadership that doomed him in 1876 and
1880 and tonight it looks as if the same
causes we're heret to produce the result
Arthur seemed to be hopelessly beaten
by Blaine yesterday. To night the tndi-
cations point strongly to the defeat Of
Blaine by Arthur, and If the anti Blaine
combination shall repeat its triumph to.
morrow It. ia even possible that Arthur
may loom up again and become formid-
able candidate by Thursday. The two
strong men have now each had his knock
down, and the Presidential minnows are
splashing about to-nigh. while the whales
are trying to recover their wind.
HOPING AGAINST HOPE.
Philadelphia Press, Blaine organ.


The impression is to night that the
days work leaves Arthur in no better
shape than before, and that his nomi-
nation is hardly within the bounds Of
possibility. 1t has, however, quickened
the impulse of the field toward a COM
bination with the demonstration, how
ever, that nearly every element of the
| opposition must be heartily enlisted upon
| popular candidate if Blaine is to be- de
| teated.


NO FURTHER FIGHT FOR CHAIRMAN.

CHICAGO June 3.-The Blaine managers
said late tonight that there need bs no
surprise II they agreed to urge the eop-
tinuspcs of Congressman Lynch as Fer
malept chairman. The Arthur men
were alive to the point which could tLus
be made, and they said If this oonrse was
taken by the Blaine men they would be
compelled to support Mr.. Lynch. As fol
that matter, they are perfectly satisfied
to continue Mr.. Lynch, and so are the
Eimunds men, though some of the latter
have suggested that an Elmunds man
ought to be placed in the chair. Xxx
Gov. Long said that Mr.. Lynch would b,
quite as acceptable to him and his friends
| ~ any other man.


BOTH SIDES HOPEFUL.

that they are tr,fie low spirited. MIR

were likely to incite a riot. Edward
King said he learned that Inspector
Thorne had said it was a dangerous thing
to held meeting at the present time in
New York, as there were 10000 persons
here who obtained living by illegiti-
mate means. He would remind the IN
spector that there were also 10000 per-
sons around Wall street and in tho upper
part of the city who were and had for
years been living by illegitimate means. :
He belonged to party that did not
believe in beginning revolution. What
they wanted was to end a revolution
which began thousands of years ago,
and he believed that great reforms of
the future must come from the working
class and education. There were two
dangerous classes in the city-the law
yers and the Other political heelers, and
the riots in Cincinnati had been caused
by the heelers. The following preamble
and resolutions were then read and
adopted: j.--..


Whereas, The Cincinnati riot origi-
mated in ageneral indignation, caused by
the shameless corruption prevailing in
all the functions of our public life, and
especially in courts. ss.@


Whereas, The people have in this case
been driven by so-called prominent citi-
zens to attempt to lynch an obscure
miserable wretch, while scores of promi-
nent criminals not only elude punish
ment, but even hold prominent and
high official positions. !
Whereas, The same conditions exist
throughout the United States. and es-
pecially in the city of New York.


Whereas, The fundamental cause for
this shameful state of things is to be
found in the existing politicl and econo-
mical system based on the robbery COM.
mitted by capital upon the laboring
classes, and which system the bloodsuck-
ers in the political and economical field,
the capitalists and monopolists are
directly interested in perpetuating the
corruption in all public Offices by filling
the same with persons open to bribery
and subject TO the will of their patrons
the Observation-Disclosures be it


Resolved, That no amelioration of
public life is to be expected before the
fundamental eau be of the prevailing
evils of the existing system of capitalistic
robbery be thoroughly destroyed and
before the socialistic organization of
labor which precluE Eles all possibility of
such robbery, be established.
Resolved, That this great social revo-
luton can be accomplished only by the
oppressed; that is by the working classes.
Resolved, That for attaining this object
the working people must organize to
resent all attempts of their enemies to
provoke unnecessary riots, but must at
the same time carefully and with all
possible energy prepare for the ultimate
overthrow of the existing social order
based on corruption and robbery."

A number Of years ago man whose real
name was Arnold. but who, for reasons best
known To himself, assumed that of Howard,
came to Colorado from town in Iowa with
his wife. For some time he wa, engaged in
ireighting, varying his employment by the
occasional theft of cattle when any came in
his way, and which he sold to other freight
ers on the road. Tiring of this, he took up
ranch about half way between Summitvilie
and Del Norte and near the head of Pnos
creek, establishing a sort of wayside inn,
which was really rendezvous for all the
cattle and horse thieves tor many miles
around. His ranch was most conveniently
located for the purpose rs large number OF
trails leading To the mountains center there.
OF this gang of thieves he was the generally
recognized captain. The operations of How

Shot Dead by a Drunken Youth Of


Is Years,",,"10 te8kBs


A Bel Air special to the Baltimore Sun
dated Thursday, says: Shortly after
noon to. day James Msckin, SOD of Joseph
Mackin of Havre de Grace, shot and
instantly killed an unknown laborer who
was employed on Parliament & Co, ""a con.
tract of the Baltimore & Ohio extension.
The deceased ia supposed to be an Italian
or Hungarian. He could not speak q
word OF English, however, and 1t is said
offered not the slightest provoostion To
his asssilRnt, who is youth only 1e
years OF age. II is said young Mackin
killed him for fun, and that the victim
WAS not within 10 feet Of his assailant al
any time.


There WAS but one witness to the
tragedy, Mr.. Lsgates, who is watohmsn
at the Stokes street railroad crossing,
Havre de Grace, who says Msokin fred
the region of the heart. The shooting
WAS done at an alley near the freight
house. The Italian, according to this
witness, was standing about 10 feet from
the freight house, near the alley.
Maokin came out, put up his pistol and
fred the three shots, the last one
taking effect and killing him In
stantly. No one saw them talking or
quarreling. Maokin had been drinking.
He was arrested by Deputy Sheriff Boyd.
Coroner Charshee held an ipqnest over
the body of the deceased, and the jury
rendered verdict that he cams to HE
death by pistol shot fred by James
Mackin. This crossing watchmsn testi-
fed TO the effect stated above. The pris-
oner was ordered committed, and WAS
conveyed to Jail at Bel AIR, which he
reached in the afternoon. The grand jury
had just adjourned, aud Maokin will
be compelled to remain 10 Jail
until next November court. His father,
Joseph Mackin, was in Bel Air IL
attendance on the grand jury in a local
.ption osse at the time the shooting took
place in Havre de Grace. Dnri' The
morning al slterostion between Joseph
Maokin and William L Cooley, IN nbsr
OF the bar, occurred at Staglner's II otsl,
in Bel Air, in which Mackin WAS knocked
down. Msckin Immediately went bsfore
the grand jury, and Mr.. Cooley was
indicted for assault. This result had
gram WAS sent to Mackin informing him
OF the desperate deed of his son.


Maokin's statement to Deputy Sheriff
Boyd, who took the prisoner to Bel Air,
is that before noon pa ty of Italians had
gone to the house Of John Il. Serricks,
and asked for something to drink.
Ssrricks WAS absent, and the family,
being alarmed at the presence of the
Italians, asked young Mackin to protect
them. He refused to Sell the Italians
any liquor, and they left. At noon
Mackin started for homs to get his
dinner. At the freight depot he met
the Italians agsin. a quarrel took
place, and he says one Of the
Italians advanced toward him In q
threatening manner with his hand be-
hind him, as though about to draw a
weapon. Maokin says he had heard that
pistol shot would frightsn an Italian,
and he drew his pistol, firing two shots
into the ground by his side. TIE man
continued to advance, and he aimed the
third time at him, intending to shoot him
in the leg. The ball struck the Italian
in the left breast, causing his death half
an hour afterwards.


News of the killing soon spread among
the Italian laborers, who are very numer-
ous in the neighborhood, and they
poured into Havre de Grace from every
direction, threatening to lynch Msckin
| Maokin went home after the shooting and
Deputy Sheriff Boyd found him in bed.
He got mp and went quietly to Bel Air.
As the deputy and his prisoner left Bel
Air they met band of excited Italians
who called to Boyd to stop, but he put
whip to his horse, and dsshing through
the crowd, conveyed his prisoner unmo
lested to Jail. Mackin expresses no re-
gret for the circumstance, and says hs
does not care what becomes of himself."

OPPOSITION TO the sale of LIQUOR in Kansas

CURED recently in Canton. A man named
Harold opened liquor store i'm that place on
a Friday, and on Monday got into a quarrel
with one of his drunken customers and was

A GREAT crowd of 10000 persons attacked
the Jail at Cincinnati in an attempt to lynch
William BeIner, whose trial for the
Belf-confessed murder of William Kirk
had ended in a verdict Of mere man.
slaughter. An immense indignation meeting
ended by the crowds marching TO the Jail and
attempting TO force an entrance. The militia
was called out and in the firing which fol

Others injured. Such excitement which pre-
vailed i'm Cincinnati has not been
known there in long time. On
the following night the rioting was
renewed with terrible earneStneSs: the court
house was burned down, bIITicadeS were
thrown up in the streets LEADING to the Jail by
the police and military, and TIE riotous mul-
titude were fired upon. More than thirty-fiye
persons were instantly killed and several
score wounded, many of them with fatal eff
feet The next night witnessed further scenes
of carnage; about fifteen more persons
were killed and sixty wounded. Among the
killed and wounded were several militiamen
and policemen Ii was only after Governor
Hoadley had summoned the militia from all
parts of the State that the semblance of
order was finally restored.


EIGHT murderers were hanged the other
day-flve at Tombstone, Arizona, one at
Placerville and one at San BeIuarilno, Cal,
and one at Sumter, 5. C. The five at Tomb
stone were masked marauders who had killed
four persons in a raid; the one at llacerville
had murdered two brothers; the San BeTna-
dino victim was a woman murderer, and the
one at Sumter was negro who had killed
another of his race.

killed and $50 wounded. The dead included
one militiaman-Captaiu Desmond-and one

So great was the rush at Portsmouth, Ohio,
for Cincinnati papers containing accounts of
the riot that on one day when the express
train with the papers aboard arrived, almost
a riot ensued and the police had to be called
on. One news stand was torn to pieces, a boy
had his skull crushed and many persons Were

Romans vi, IL: 'Likewise reckon ye also
yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but
alive unto God, through Jesus Christ our
Lord"" Subject: ''The Spiritual Resurrec-
ton"" The gladdest thing about this Easter
day is not that Christ came out of the tomb,
or that our bodies are to be raised at the last
day. but that our spiritual lives mag be raised
up from moral death. and made alive to God.
First What are We TO understand by dying
TO live! IL Is not trying ourselves to die, or
merely aerving Christ TO die, bu; it i. diving
with Christ unto sin. Sin does not die. but
we die to sin. As long as we are under the
power OF faith in Christ's dying, sin has no
influence with US. Second, Our diving with
Christ is the pledge of our rising to q new
life. We are exhorted to cleave unto God.
Awake to righteousness and sin not.


The decorations of flowers. though not pro-
fuse. were appropriate and tasteful. The
singing BY the choir was more than usually
enjoyable. An exeelleet Easter anthem,
''Cbrist our Passover"" was rendered with

with flowers, among which were several hun

was sung BY the choir. with Miss May Smith
as oreanist. 1t was very finely rendered
and showed much care and preparation on
the part of the singers and organist. The

sermon. powerful and interesting one, was
delivered by Rev. Father Murphy. The text
was from Psalm III .'rhis is the day which

DR.. A. N. Bell, chairman of the committee
appointed upon the resolution for securing
more competent medical and sanitary service
on board trans-oceanic passenger vessels,
submitted a report. Ho stated that after duo
consideration q bill was prepared and placed
in the hands of Hon. II. W. Slocum, who
had introduced IL in the house, and it had
been referred to the committee on commerce.
The bill to regulate the carriage of pas
Iengers by sea-"" provides that in oil such
vessels two compartments shall be provided
exclusively to be devoted to hospital uses,
one for men aud ono for women. 1t requires
tho employment of q medical practitioner,
and when tho number of passengers exceed
800 he is to have an assistant. The doctor is
to report to the captain such regulations as
ho wishes carried out


Tho report Of DIR. Bell elected discussion,
which was participated in by DR.. Kaiser, OF
Philadelphia; DIR. Irwin, of New York. and
DR.. Jones, Of Pennsylvania. Dr. Kaiser
thought that the bill was good one but it
did not 70 far enough, as it should require
the surgeon of the vessel to report directly to
the United States government and not to the
captain of the vessel. De, Irwin said that,
owing to the fact that tks bill allowed the
doctors to be appointed by the company
and to be under their control, it was
impracticable. He favored the plan of
making the doctor Independent of
the company, and in all sanitary matters tho
authority, subject only TO tho laws of the
United States. DR.. Jones said that from his
position as q government medical inspector
he had never found that captains of our ves-
soils interfered with sanitary regulations, or
that the hospitals of those vessels were occu-
pied with rope and waste matter. The report
Of the committee was accepted and tho
committee continued.

diate action in the matter was adopted.

chairman of the section on practical medicine
read reported, in which he said: ""The
field of pathology and pathological research,





great attention, and of the subjects promi-
nently brought to the attention of tho profes-
sion, and exciting universal interest more
than any other, Is that of the bacillus theory
of tuberculosis and its contagious character
Only few years ago Koch stood almost alone
in its advocacy, but now similar confrmatory
evidence has been produced by Pruden
Dreschfeld, West, Gibbs, Heron, Wipham
Meissen, and others. DR.. Austin Flint, sr
accepts the new theory as well as the
Geological character of micro-organism when

element combined with the favorable soil for
its propagation""


DR.. Shoemaker referred to the gave accuse.
tions cast upon American pork by some of

inosis is with us very rare desease indeed
in comparison with its frequent occurrence
in continental Europe In conclusion. DR..
Shoemaker referred to the tendency mani
tested on the part of specialist to form cliques,

acterized as an attempt more to form an aris-
tocracy in the most democratic of professions.

w. D. Parsons, a farmer of the Third
District, while passing along the road near
Newpridge, Thursday, saw the body of
colored man hanging on small dogwood
tree, just off the highway His feet were
within six inches of the ground. Mr..
Parsons, upon examination, found that
the corpse was that of George Briscoe,
the colored desperadO. Mr.. Parsons
notified Dr. George II. Crume and Cor
oner Thomas S. Jacob. A jury was at
once summoned, and after short delib-
Grafton, rendered a verdict that the de-
ceased came to his death by hanging at
the hands of some unknown parties. The
lvnchers, whoever they may be, have kept
their own counsel, and it is impossible to
suspect their identity. Briscoe arrived
at Jacobsville on Wednesday in the
custody of Detectives DeCoste and Sic
bcld. of Baltimore, and was given hearing
on the charge of entering the house OF
Mrs, Peter SlllncnduG IOT Tile puIpOSt VI
burglary. Justice Jacobs, after hearing
the testimony, committed Briscoe to await
the action of the Court and decided that
he be taken to the jail at Annapolis
Grafton Boone, Deputy-Sheriff, and John
II. Wills took the prisoner in charge and
started for Annapolis in a carriage. When
about three miles from Jacobsville,
masked man armed with a gun stepped
into the middle of the road, and grasping
the horse by his bride, brought him to a
standstiI. From behind the briers III
teen or twenty other masked men came
into view and surrounded the carriage.
Boone asked them what they
wanted. In reply a dozen
pistols were fourished in his
face and he was ordered to jump out. He
quickly obeyed, and made tracks from the
place as rapidly as possible. Wills was
then dragged from the carriage and chok-
ed, as was also Briscoe, the negro. Wills,
before being liberated and driven Off,
heard Briscoe say: swell, if I've got to
die, all right"" What took place after
wards, save the fact that Briscoes was
hanged, is known only to the lynchers.
Who they are is a mystery. 1t is limited
that Boone and Wills, who are peculiarly
reticent on the subject, know more then
they choose to reveal."

seems bound on destruction pure and simple
The burning Of the court house gives no aiC


in the purpose of lynching the murderers
and its destruction only adds loss to dis
grace. The firing on the mob has been mer
eiless, whether by the soldiers or the gatlins
gun cannot be told, as nothing has beer


heard from the inside of the jail for the past
hour. No one can estimate the loss of life


or the number Of wounded. At Habig's un
dertaking shop four unknown dead men are
lying, at the Cincinnati hospital as many
more, while over 20 wounded are at the lat
ter place and wagons are still coming in
with more. 1t was nearly midnight when
the l4th regiment arrived on the scene. They
with pluck and skill

of clearing the streets. This work was ac


complished. and they are in the Jail yard


with the besieged guards and policemen.
The 4,h regiment arrived at the other side OF
the city, and afte marching part way to the
scene turned and went back to the depot.
Col. John w. Harper. aid-de-camp to the
governor, who is here, telegraphed this action
| to the governor. and he received reply or
dering the 4th regiment to report at the jail
| forthw ith and Join the others. Col. Harper
sent an order to the 4th regiment to join Col.
Hawkins at the Jail by direct or indirect
route. That order was given at l2.45 A. NJ.
but when informed that the mob was still in
force and blocking the streets near the court
house, though not apparently accomplishing
anything, Col. Harper modified the order
with view of averting further bloodshed.
The rioters stood in the streets within range
of the soldiers as if courting death. There
is no method, no purpose apparent. 1t is a
| mob of madmen. just now man
who ventured near the scene, saw a volley
| fred, and man named Edward Gallagher
| fall dead, and several others were wounded.
At this hour Cl A. M J. there is no cessation
of firing Indeed, it has grown heavier, and
is accounted for by the statement that the
mob has procured cannon. Col. Harper
orders to the 4th Regiment have just been
given. They direct the colonel of the regi-
ment to march his men quietly up Fourth
street to Sycamore street, then up Sycamore
to the Jail, and to disperse whatever mob
there may be in the way, but at all events to
join the other troops at the Jail. He has in
structed them that the troops there will be
looking for him. 1t will be nearly an hour
before the orders can be carried into effect.
Meanw hile the firing continues. There is a
possibility that the 4th regiment may reach
! its destination without encountering much re-
| sistance. The mob seems to be gathered at
the corner of Main and Ninth streets, under
cover. The scenes during this memorable
night have been indiscribable.


| No mob could have been more poorly
equipped or lack more in leadership and
organization than this one, nor does it seem
that the military and police have had any
settled plan or competent leaders. Prepara-
tions for defense made during the day were
all against an attack from Sycamore street
! Ao;r laft nd
say no opposition was made to firing of the
treasurer's office. The troops were all gath
cred in the Jail. The fire department re-
fused to respond to the alarm until an escort
of troop. was sent. When the fire engine
appeared the mob warned them to go no
further.


CINCINNATI, March 30.
3.45 A. M-Comparative quiet is restored
The mob has dispersed. Many of the dead
are still lying in the streets near the scene of
the conflict, and it is safe to say that the mum.
.bcr of killed is between 80 and 10. Only a
small part thereof have heen identified. There
were three or four slight casualties in the
Jail.


| p. M.-There has been no change in the
situation since the mob dispersed this morn
| ing. The streets are now comparatively
clear of people, and barricaded in all drec.
tions, keeping the remaining portion of the
crowd square away from the court house
and Jail. Adjutant General Finley is here.
| All the available militia of the State is or
dered here in the quickest possible time.
Everybody looks for a repetition tonight of
| last nights bloody and aimless work. The
weather is delightful.

the Queen City hotel, has just been shot dead

9.30P. M.-Firing has begun near the
court house and is heavier than any time
during last night.


| At daybreak the Associated Press reporter
walked through the quarter of the city where
the scenes of the previous night had been
enacted only an hour before. On Sycamore
street, below Court. Law four or FIVE dead
bodies of drunken men. who in spite of the
police warning had gone beyond the limit
when they fell under the fire of the soldiers


No one dared go and take them away till the

SATURDAY., APRIL I9, 1894",,"TUESDAY Joe Casey paid the penalty cf the law for the crime of murder. There is a difference of opinion among people as to the righteousness of capital pun ishment, but in practice, States that have abolished 1t at times have gladly returned to it. It seems to be the only way to Geal with Eigh-handed criminals. Desperate diseases require desperate remedies. Public sentiment is undoubt- edly in favor of hanging murderers by the neck until dead. If the law val. .not do it, Judge Lynch sits in judgment, no matter what the morale of the cOmmun- ity is. Arizona has made wonderful ad- vGnce5 tho past three years. IL was once a lawless country the highwaymen, assassin and murderer held high carnival throughout the territory. They reIgued supreme and their power was felt in our courts Of justice There is 8 great change. To tell how t has come about and who to give the credit to would be 8 difficult task Each and every good citizen is entitled to credit; some more than others. Gradually by wise and determined acts upon tine part of the law abiding people the lawless begin to feel their weakness. Many of them have bit the dust or died between heaven and earth. It is true the law was lax but the people were desperate ana the majesty of tEe law was utterly disregarde3. Occasionally, at such time, ihe people would Eot rest quiet when there was fear Of the escape of q man who had committed great crime. and took inc law into thcic hands. But this thi--t for swift and unlawful justice is being appoase3. Criminals are promptly arrested by officers oi the law. jurors have uo longer a fear Of personal violence, and tho criminal class are no longer jurors, and a man who commits crime is promptly indicted: he E tried and the people have confidence in the judge that sis cn tue bench; the result is satisfactory; II murder in the first degree, be is convicted, in aImost every case, and hanged as Joe. Casey was hanged today It is our purpose to impress the fact upon the country at large that Arizona to-day is as free from crime as any State or Territory In the Union, and we believe there is not a State or Territory in tue Union that can compare with her in sDlltnus- Of justice This man Ca-sy was in jail for robbery. From iha time he attempted to escape and killed Jailor Hol5look. the evidence which would have been de dueei, had Le been tried for that crime

 we l.a-n from the District Attorney, cauid hot have convicted LIm, and in a ltl- while Eo would have been a free man. But doing what he dil, leads one to believe Le must have been guilty; i1 not guilty, then tine depravity of the man was almost beyond compare, and sympathy for him IS misplaced. A man like General DeitZIer, brave, noble, gen es5us, is sGl5caly killed; the first news k shocking; that is all; three days after Le is killed and his dad body is borne to fine cars to be sent to the be1eayeJ family, only little handful of men fcI- low #. To-day & murderer, G criminal of the highest order is executed, and there is a morbid. sentimental sympathy exhibited that is unaccoul5able. Hun dreds of people crowd about tLe streets and jail, knowing full well they eau sec nothing, all eager to haar aa, word ,lat may fail from the murd5rec's lips. Such are borne upon the air as trophie- to be cherished fondly and handed down 10 posterity. Why should there be such sympathy publicly expressed for Casey and so little for General Deitzler? No one will acknowledge h9 admires Casey. while every one speaks warm words of praise for the General; suu crowds flock around the gallows Of a murderer, and only a corporars guard about the coffin of brave, good man suddenly stricken in death."

ing altogether to $1.50, from Carrie b.

Mr. Bland took the floor in opposition to the
BILL and especially to that section which provides
that the trade dollars received at the coinage
mints shall be regarded as silver bullion and that
their bullion value shall be deducted from the
coined by the act of February 2S 1878. The effect
OF the section would be to suspend the coinage of
standard dollars TO the extent OF SlO,OOOOO0 per
year. If the trade dollars were to be considered
as bullion. let them go In surplus to the monthly
coinage Of silver. Under the section the amount
essarily silver would decrease in value. and next

the coinage of tho standard dollar should be

were highly entertaining. The opening

sung by Miss Emma Cotton, Mrs. Samuel

was full of melody and sweetness. MISS

Cotton read ""The Battle of Lookout

all who were fortunate enough to be
present. Mrs. Buker as Ethel Reed, MISS
Mollie Burris as Nettie SpGutdtng, MI
NJ. B. Burris as Mr.. Ransom, and DR..

respective roles in a way most creditable
to themselves and highly pleasing to the
audience. All through the comedy, which
was about an hour in length, the applause
was frequent and was given in way that
indicated that the audience were heartily
enjoying the little play. Nothing more
pleasing than this comedy has ever been
given by the Lyceum. At the conclusion
of ""The Register Miss Lynch sung, by

was pleasing vocal solo by Miss Cotton

 The canvass in Mississippi is expected to

 sixth and seventh congressional districts. In

 these four negroes have been put in the field

 but the third-the shoestring district, now

 represented by Jeffords Rep.) Chalmers, in

 the second district, will have to divide the I negro vote with a colored man named John

 Watertown, Massachusetts, furnishes sig nifeant straw. Last year such great efforts were made to get out full vote that all but six of the voters in town cast their ballots The result was: For Butler. 590; for Robin son, 562. Some time ago four of the eight members of the Democratic town committee resigned, including the chairman and secre- tary. The other evening about two hundred more met with these boltsrs under call which concluded with these significant words: 'EFrom Grover Cleveland in the White House and free trade for goods of foreign manufac- ture, good Lord deliver the working people!' The meeting was enthusiastic and zealous. Before it adjourned there were one hundred and sixty names on the rolls. The indica- tions all point to rapid increase in num- bers. The result will be that the Democrat ic strength of last year will be split in two fairly equal parts while the Republicans will poll nearly solid vote

But Ter no doubt told the truth at the Chicago convention when he said not man there be- ieved in civil service reform on the school master plan"" This indicates the real atti- tude of the Democrats toward civil service reform.

 It is a little singular that the New church, founded upon the revelations of Swedenborg, has little recognition in the city of Stock holm, which was the birthplace of the great seer and scientist. In fact throughout Swe- den the church and it's teachings are less known than in either this country or Eng land. A movement has lately been started to give Stockholm suitable place of wor- ship, instead of the workmen's hall wherein the followers of Swedenborg now hold their meetings. An American clergyman, Rev. J. H. Hinckley, of Brooklyn, has taken lead ing part, and has been in Sweden for the purpose At a New church conference in Birmingham, England, a few days ago, Rev MT.

 So many vague statements have been made concerning Professor Koch's views relating to cholera that the Berlin correspondent of the British Medical Journal thinks it wise to give his ideas as printed in the official port The spread of cholera, he recites, is caused by personal contact, and not by goods and other objects, except damp, infected linen. The infection is not in the air, but in the elections of the patient. It is only dangerous in a moist state and dies very speedily when dry; air cannot transfer the disease. The bacilli do not, as in smallpox, produce spores, which may dry up only to reappear alive Drying will positively kill them in three hours. The disease is confined wholly to the digestive organs. Contact with the patient is without danger. if contam- ination from the digestive organs is received. The following convey infection: Infected drinking and washing water, infected moist and liquid foods, and especially milk. The Berlin hospital inspector stated that there was no need to be especially afraid of chol- era; it was much less dangerous than indig- enous plagues.

 Dr. Albert Day publishes an article on medical de1usions, giving as a notable in stance of these the wonderful cures which were effected in the New England States dur ing the last year of the past century by what were known as the Perkins metallic points. It seems that certain Dr. Perkins of Plain field, Conn.,, made and patented metallic tractors One part was composed of steel 1 and the other of some metallic compound 1 The operation of cure consisted in uniting the 1 large ends and then drawing the sharp points l over the diseased parts. Letters are given 1 from number of professional men and prominent merchants, testifying to the mi

 raculous effect produced. The lame walked, | the rheumatic were relieved of their pains, 1 infammations of all kinds immediately sub l sided, and even confirmed cases of cancer yielded immediately under the magical pres

 sure of the Perkins tractors. The inventor

 was not, however, able to ward off disease on

 his own account, for he died in the height of ! his fame in 1797. His son took out patent

 for the tractors in England. There, too, the success at the outset was astonishing, and the younger Dr. Perkins quickly made $50, ,000. l DRY

at Roche's rooms, in St Louis, was a famous
base ball player few years ago, He was left

took up and expelled; Lewis, of the St Louis
club one or two members of the Indianapolis
club and very few others would complete the
list, These men frequently go before the public,
through the newspapers, in disgraceful broils
and do more to injure base ball than they can
benefit it by years of good playing The time

That the fool killer has omitted",,"That the fool killer has omitted to

the nincompoop who is supposed to

drunk for twenty years, as was Rip

there can be no question. We take
it that he was born in the wilds of
some foreign country where civifza-
ton is unknown, when he asserts
that sit is disgrace to the American
people to have one of its presidential
nominating conventions presided over
by a member of a race who are ma
turally, and by right ought to be,
hewers of wood and drawers of
water for their master, the Caucas-
eian, upon whose brow God Himself
has stamped the seal of superiority
The atterance is such that the mean
est cur would refuse to use, at this

human beings, and is not fit associ-
ate for the lower animals of creation.
The easiest possible way to get rid

susceptible of persuasion) to visit
Philadelphia, Harrisburg, Washing
ton OF some city where colored men
are employed as guardians of the

We think, from his writings, that an
incident of this kind would kill him
and death from such a cause and
to such person would be a good
ridance As to Mr.. Lynch this self

The Philadelphia Press of the 2lst
of June very appropriately introduces
this sleeping Watchman' or ass
to his gross indiscretion, and to such
a stanch champion as the Press are
the race indebted for vindication
from numerous uncalled for assaults.
Ifthe editor of the Watchman is fitted
for any sphere in life it is that to
which he would consign the
progressive negro, or worse, sea-
venger or dog catcher. If there is
any one thing for which the Ameri-
can people need feel proud, it is that
there are very few such pucilanimous
blisters in their midst as this Watch
man proclaims himself. We agree
with the Press, that ""the choice of
Mr. Lynch as its presiding officer,
was to the infinite credit of the Re-
publican convention and the Ameri-
can citizens who composed it."" AL
though brought about as was the
emancipation of the slaves, by acci-
dent, or as a means to an end it must
ultimately Gf not already have
good effect. Mr.. Lynch was thought
ful enough to remind the con-
vention that he was cognizant
of the emergency, but unfortu-
nately for the Democrats the emer-
gencies by which we are benfited
originate with the Republicans, and
advocates such as the Editor of the


Waterman will eternally damn his
party, and the sooner they muzzle
him the better it will be for their
safety and respectability. In our
opinion any one who gives vent to
such expressions is disgrace not
only as bipartisan, but as journalist

his deserts may the Lord have mercy

at the Asbury A. NJ. E. church. 1t was
called by the Louisiana residents In Washing
ton, in the interest of the New Orleans Inter
national Exposition. Hon. John w. Pierce,
Liberian consul at New Orleans, and collector
of African exhibits was chosen president of
the meeting, A. p, Albert, secretary, and the
following vice presidents: Hon. J. Il. OHara
North Carolina; Hon. Robert Smalls South
Carolina; Hon. J. NJ. Langston, Washington,
ID. O.; John r. Lynch, Frederick Douglass,
Prof. II. II. Greencr, Hon. p. b.
Washington, d. C c. c. A. Astwood, Col. W.
a. Pledger, Georgia; j. Haralson, j. NJ. Daans
Florida; Il. X. Bruce, Washington. There
were also present Maj. Il. A. Burke director
general OF the exposition; Col. William Nor
rell, of Louisiana, and the Colored National
Associated Press. The meeting was opened
with prayer by Rev. r. A. Reed.


Mr.. Pierce said the object Of the meeting
was to elicit tho interest and sympathy of the
colored people with the Now Orleans expo
sition.


Major Burke said that the managers Of the
exposition had appropriated $4,000 toward
the colorod exhibit at the exposition Within
the last decade the colored men had much
improved in the mechanical arts, and the
exposition would show to the country what
they had done and what II was possible for
them to do. The exposition would prove,
especially to the colored race, a school of in
struction. He said that 40 per cont. of the
mechanics employed in New Orleans were
colored men.


Rev. A. NJ. Green. Of New Orleans, who
came over from the Baltimore conference,
said that the movement had his heartiest
support and appreciation.


Paster Reed also made few remarks.
| A lettor was read from Frederick Douglass
rogretting that II long-standing engagement
would prevent his attendance at the meeting,
| but pledging his earnest sympathy and sup
port toward all measures tending to the
success of tho movement for which the meeting
had been called.


A letter from Senator Blair was read in
which he said that while he considered this
movement of great consequence to the whole
country, it was manifestly tho initial point
of a new era of development in tho vast
region which during the present generation
had passed through great war. He closed
with tribute to the moral, intellectual, and
social development made by the colored race
during tho past twenty years. The meeting
closed with the adoption Of the following
resolutions:


Whereas the great Worlds Cotton Centennial
| Exposition has determined that there shall be- nc
| invidious distinction between white aud colored
| citizens either in exhibiting the results OF theii
skill or in competing for premiumsj therefore

 The Busy Times For the Board of Par dOns.

 At the session of the board of pardons on Tuesday they heard the petitions of William Morris, Patrick Lynch and John B. Diebert, New Haven county; Joel W. Perkins and Frederick Hall, Litchfeld county; William King and John Byrne Middlesex county Charles w. Bill, Windham county; Michael J. Casey, Fairfield county; Dwight W. Steere, New London county. William Mor- ris, who is serving fifteen years sentence for burglary, made an argument to show that as the offense was committed in the day time he had served long enough. He was sentenced in 1879. He also wants to take care of a heart broken wife and young child John B. Diebert, who is serving three years sentence for forgery, told story which seemed intended to show that he was not only innocent, like most of the others, but the victim of persecution and treachery. Joel Perkins, serving life sen tence for murder in the second degree, Fred. Hall, also sentenced for murder, thought he had earned his release. He was sentenced fol life in 1871. Patrick Lynch is also in for murder. He killed his wife and says he had been drinking and says he thought something came out of the wall at him and he struck 1t and afterwards found it was his wife. Will liam King, who is under sentence for 25 years for rape, declared he was innocent of the crime. He was heard at some length. His sentence dates from October, 1880. John Byrne, also in for rape and sentenced for 15 years, is also innocent, according to his own account, and the victim of false evidence. D. w. Steere, who is sentenced for life for murder in the second degree, asks for release on the ground of confirmed ill-health. He was sentenced in 1876. The remaining cases were for minor offences or had no special interest."

 When the hcrses appeared it vas a sight for painter. The boys had offered boots to the darkey. to put on his horse. and he had boots on every lex from the hoofs up as far as boots could ee Eaade to stick on, and the hcrse's tail had been neatly braided. and tied up ~ith oise ribbons. and when the horses scored up, there vas more fun than . barrel of monkeys The word vas given fo~ the fsst heat. and they came down the road neck and neck, at good nine minute gait, it vas estimated by horsemen. but the darkey thought they were flying. When near the judges stand. the driver of the poney held up . little, and the darkey went ahead, and won the heat amid as much excitement as was ever seen on . race course. The people fairly hosled. and while some of the boys took the darkey from the sulkey. and carried him on their shoulders, others detached the old horse from the sulky, sponaed his nostrls with . sponge as big as a wash tub, and acted just as they do at a big race.

 The liveryman insisted on walking the horse up and down she street between the heats, and when the darkey got loose from the boys and came up, the livery man told him if anybody offered to buy the horse. not to sci any price on him, as he wanted the hrst chance 10 buy him, ard wou' pay more than any live man, and the darkey agreed to give him the first show

 The second heat was taken by the pony, but the darkey claimed "" foui,"" on the ground that the driver of the pony called him names, but the foul was no, allowed. The darkey vas a little fright ened, but he took the third heat easily and the boys made hero of him, and the crowd shouted themselves hoarse The man that held the shot bag of money was seen to start to cross the bridge, and somebody told the darkey he was a rob- Der, and vas making for the woods with the cash, and he took after the stake holder and overhauled him after qufse a chase, and came back with the shot bag, but on counting it over there was only six dollars, and he declared he had been robbed, and the boys sent the sheriff after the stakeholder and agreed to lynch him. The darkey vas beginning to reap the results of his success and enjoy his popu- larity, when he was arrested by a mock officer on charge of fast driving on the streets and taken before a mock cour.. where trial was held which lasted half the night. and the attorneys went into the history o! the darkey, and talked of viola ton of the constitution, until they fright encd him nearly to death. As the bell tolled for midnight the jury brought in a verdict of arson in the rrst degree, and the judge, after asking him if he had any thing to say why sentence should no, be pronounced on him, sentenced him to punishment from Neillsville, forever, the penalty of return being instan, death al the hands of the first man he met. He was escorted out into the open ar, the horse was produced, and a, one o'cloci in the morning he rode out of Neillsvill< forever, believing his escape from death at the hands of the kuklux was the resul, of direct interpretation of divine provi. dence. It was the greatest horse race that was ever seen, and created more fur than anything could have done."

The Grant 4 Ward FsiIsre-It Is


Believed to be the Heaviest


wall street Has Ever Kmow0.


New YORK. May 8.-The suspicion
grows that the Grant 4 Ward failure
is much more serious than at first sus-
pected. A well known member Of the
Stock Exchange to-day said: ''For four
or fve months l have heard runors
of transactions Of Grant & Ward. /
do not think So, ,OOO, 900 by any means
an extrsvagant estimate Of the liabil-
iiies of the firm. My belief is that
they exceed $lO,00O,O 900. When the
failure was announced l said it w0ald
be the largest that Wall Street
ever saw, and am more firmly con-
vinced than ever Of the truth Of the
estimate. What the assets can be no
one knows. but they are probably very
small, and the disparity in the figures
will ndoubtedly Iuse surprise""


The clerk OF Grant 4 Ward said:
""Trhe amount Of the liabilities will un-
doubtedly be very large. They are dis.
covering new busines. every day, Yes;
know the names Of some of the per-
sons caught, but cannot give then.
Some gentlemen are in for $500, 900 and
others for still larger sums""

change. a member Of the firm, said IL
do not think the assignee will be- ready
until the latter part Of next week.
don't think the amount of t.e liabilities
will reach IS, 900, 900. although it is a
matter of which | have no knowledge.
The figures are all gossip and arc, 4
think, oxtravaeantly large. The rail
road companies which received loans en-
securities which were then transferred to
Other persons, are amply protested and
lose nothing. The losses will fall
chiefly upon individuals who have in-
vested money with the firm. This
business was conducted by Ward. OF
course Gen. Grant and son have known
Of these transactions, but do not think
they are fully aware Of the large amounts
involved. They have been led on by
Ward. and will, Of course. lose very
heavily.


Fred Grant was interviewed. He
said he was looking for employment,
rs he had nothing to do now. # would
depend on whether anything was saved
from the wreck, whether he went into
business for himself.

rifed Of all the money. which was all
the woman had for her suppor.

Chief OF Police, who detailed Officer
Lynch and special Officer Lindheimsr to
work up the case.


After careful examination Of the
circumstances and the premises, they
arrested Annie Hayes and Annie Robin
son, who had just hired rooms at the
hotel. On their persons were found
$l35 in cash, which Mo. Burgham
claimed as part Of her money. The off.
GERS then found that these girls had
been out shopping and feasting and had
spent $l67 for sacques and arti-
c!es Of clothing, which would ac-
count for 1902 of the stolen money.
The rest had been probably spent in
oysters aud other comforts. They weis
promptly jailed, and will rise and ex.
plain tomorrow. 1t is time that trav-
elers knew that hotels had safes

ter closet was not safe place for de-
posting large sums of money."

everything was got in readiness at Poca-
hontas yesterday evening, the police
force placed guard at the entrance of
the mines; in order to keep back the
crowd, which had been attracted by a
notice which was posted that the bodies
could be reclaimed. Mining Engineer
Moody, in charge of the rescuing party,
entered the mines to note the situation
of affairs, and when they emerged from
the mines he announced that the damage
was less than had been supposed, and no
trou bic would be experienced in recover
ing the bodies of the victims. Two
bodies were reclaimed yesterday, hor-
rlbly mutilated. Those of Boone Maxey,
white, and Jim Grim, negro. The
work was resumed this morning, and a
still larger crowd congregated at the
entrance, and ropes were stretched to
prevent their too near approach. The
crowd, however, observed proper. de-
corum, and there was no undue excite
ment A spirit of great solemnity per-
vaded the assembly, and the bodies as
they were recovered were placed in
boxes on the inside of the mine, and
several were brought out together on a
pole car. Of the sixteen which have
been recovered so far, only six were
identified.


Jim Grim was recognized by the belt
which he wore; Isham Maxwell, by his
boots George Maxwell, by being found
with his brother; William Slusser, by a
patch in one of his boots ; young Jewell,
by his hair and location of his body, and
a German, who was recognized by his
wife. Many of the bodies were horribly
mangled, and some had their heads
blown off others had the arms and legs
torn from their sockets, while still others
had the entrals torn out entirely. An
arm and leg were found in the main
entrance, but the body was not found.


A thrill of horror passed through the
crowd as the rescuing party brought out
the charred and disfgured remains of
miner with his dinner bucket clasped in
his arms. He was probably just partak-
ing of his midnight meal when the ex-
plosion hurled him into eternity.
Several miners were found with their
picks in their hands, and their positions
indicate conclusivelY that death was
instantaneous to all in the mine. At 3
o'clock the announcement was made
that no more bodies would be removed
before 9 o'clock on Saturday morning,
and the balance of the day was occu-
pied in getting out the carcasses of the
mules. A large crowd of anxious men
and women stood near the entrance,
hoping by some familiar feature to recog-
nize their dead relatives. When the
announcement was made that no more
bodies would be taken out until Saturday
the crowd withdrew."

 CHICAGO. Oct. 10.-The Federation oi Trades and Labor Unions continued the discussion this morning of the va rious blanks in their declaration of prin- ciples without arriving at any result. Certain of the delegates endeavored tO introduce matters affecting national pol itics, but were generally thwarted. The following resolutions were adopted:

 Whereas. Any of the evils complained of wage workers cannot be removed un- less by legislative enactment,

 Resolved, That We deem 1t the duty oi every trade uniOnist and wage worker in North America to work for candidates for Legislative honOrs who have proved themselves true to the friends of organ ized labor.

 The delegates then went into secret session to consider the allegation made by one of the delegates m published interview that an attempt was being made to have the Federation declare Tor one of the national political parties.

 laneous Characters -- StOvvaxvays. ATLANTIC OCEAN, ,000 Miles from Nowhere lo tHe Edltor or the JOURNAL COURIER:

 ""I It takes all kinds to make world"" Thus l muse as from remote corner of the steamer saloon I contemplate my fellow passengers on this the last voyage in the circum- mundane journey. I do not know when have been placed hitherto among more remarkable company of characters. begin to believe that there are no carica- lures in the world at an;-that there is a living prototype behind every so-called fancy sketch. If you don't entertain the same view, let me introduce you to some of these fellow-voyagers, assuring you on the word of an honorable globe-trotter that all of their characters shall be painted with colors which are true to life

 The most anomalous specimen of all is demure young English lady, who now sits at table with some young folks playing Consequences You would judge that she is a mature, experienced young woman, for she appears thoroughly graceful and self possessed. In fact there is air of fresh repose of character about her which at once

 

 extreme deceptiveness of appearances. Nothing could be further from the truth. This young woman has lived all her life in an English village near Peath, and has never been permitted to see anything of society hitherto You know with what seclusion the English rear their daughters; and l sup pose this maiden is as extreme example of the national system of development as you can find. The pernicious prudery of this English system is painfully apparent in her case. There is not man or youth on board this vessel who could not extract from her a promise to wed him on half an hours notice. Indeed, several unprincipled fellows aboard, with no honest purpose in their hearts, have secured matrimonial promises from her. This strange susceptibility, bred-as l believe by unnatural isolation from the opposite sex, amounts to almost disease in her case. She is on her way to live with her uncle in dis tant Nebraska. Unless there were some ladies aboard who appreciate the situation and acting guardians for her pro tenn, she would never greet that uncle. She IS fairly bewitched to remain over few days in New York, whereas the self-appointed mothers in question have so arranged 1t that she shall abide with them at a hotel there for one night only and then start West on a limited ticket in charge of the conductor. There is one scamp of an old sea-captain here who has taken cabin passage, and who secured from her promise to take 8 trip of a week with him to New Orleans, prior to reaching Nebraska, agreeing to pay her ex- penses if she would. In her innocency this young lady of twenty years could not see anything improper in such an arrangement, and when labored with, would reply, An, but he is so good to me. He says he really loves me, and wants me to cheer his lonely life'' 'FYou are silly girl. This man al ready has one wife, as some of us have found out, and she has to support herself, practical ly. Don't you think he talked the same to her before he married herr"" ""You are jeel- ous of me, because some one pities my loneli- ness and shows attention to me- I've are your true friends and only have your highest good at heart. Do you know that you are the laughing stock of this whole sh1pE Ii left to yourself it is as sure as the 1nf1ex1ble laws of the universe that you would have cause to wish you had never been, and that within one week"" And then the girl would begin to cry, and would promise faithfully not to have anything to do with the men folks again. But no fly was ever more easily snared by spider than this same girl would be by some male tritier half an hour later She pretty and ingenious; and there were not few men aboard who thought walking the deck with her an agreeable mode of whiling away the tedious hours. After such a walk, she would return to her cabin all unstrung, and salute her roommates with such questions as-''are my hands such very, very pretty ones? So-and-so says he never saw any that were so beautiful before"" Latterly, she has actually grown hysterical, so that she had to be put abed and guarded twice To-day two ofthe women assisted the stewardess in placing her in her berth, and then she was subjected to good old fashion ed spanking, which reverberted through the saloon, and greatly excited the curiosity of those who were not in the secret. SThe good women aboard are bound to infuse common sense into her in one way if they can't in another. And there she sits at the table playing ''Consequences'' now, with a quiet grace and which almost completely mask her unfortunate weakness. I need not that some of us gave the old sea-captain piece of our mind, threaten l ing almost everything except lynching.

 Strange to say, the same ship has giddy youth aboard who might almost be called parallel of this susceptible maiden Indeed, the two were the first to gravitate together. He boarded the steamer at Liverpool ju as I she did, and they were total strangers at the | time, made himself agreeable by helping her carry her things down to her cabin. Before 1 the boat dropped her anchor in the harbor of 1 Queenstown that night, they were engaged 1 to be married on arriving at New York, and | might be seen promenading the deck, wrap l ped in each others embrace. The funny part of it If, indeed, it was funny at alp was the fact that he was a steerage passen- l percentage, for he dressed well, and l had the aristocratic cast of features. I feil | into conversation with him day and | pumped the following facts out of him: q l got mad at my father and away from l home. Last August was my seventeenth 1 birthday and he gave me a f16 watch for a

 present I took this watch to shop, got 98 1 for it, bought e3 steerage ticket and started

 for America had to lie low at Queenstown, for I feared my father might have discovered

 my whereabouts and would send some one | aboard to arrest me. Now I almost wish he

 had have been frightfully sick and the accommodation of the steerage is the first of | that sort of thing I ever endured. I've only got about e1 left, for I've been spending too 1 freelyjn cigars and drinks. B'lieve I'll tele-

 graph mother for money when get to New | York and go back by the same ateamer :"" 1 ''Pshawl'' I replied, F'look at that tough | young Norwegian there playing the accordi- on. He hasn't got half the brains that you

 have and I doubt if he's got larger financial 1 capital but I'll wager he doesn't come back | until he travels first cabin and goes on visit to his native town. Better make the best of

 a bad bargain rather than go home to be the | butt of everybody's little joke"" But he has

 backed out already; that is plain.

 l Speaking of the success of these sluggish | foreigners who come to our shores, and of the deceptiNeness of appearances, am reminded l of one of our cabin passengers. He is a |

 most stupid, apathetic expression which I ever on human phiz. But there is | something to him. He has about as large quantity of real first-class grit as any man that ever met He told me his story and | it proved quite entertaining. He came over to the new world penniless, like the boy with the accordion, drifted away off to Washing

 ton territory, bought land for mere song, l and finally as he grew prosperous began to

 import fellow countrymen to help him work

 it. That was his errand in going to Finnland

 this time, and he has quite 8 colony. of peo- pie from his own town in the steerage of this steamer now. He has 4, 200 miles of Hallway

 travel yet before him and his fellow country amounting to S1 400 he told me. 'fBut nsy-

 CT mind, never mind said he; ''I'll get it ah

 back inside of year"" I doubt not that he l will, though he could easily afford to lose it. 1 He has several thousand acres of land in | Carbonia, which is incidentally rich in coal And yet he is so inferior looking as to con- stantly remind me of the stub of cigar that

 has been quite smoked out.

follows: That Furnivsl and bis COM

Furnival killed him neighbor CON-
ing toward the house, would naturally
inquire concerning the matter, and he
was shot also, probably witnessed by

Charles II. kugg, the negro suspected OF commit
ting the recent outrages on Long Island, escaped
from the Queens County Jail at Long Island City
last night. at 045 o'clock. When Jaer Murphy
was making his rounds, Rugg requested hun to
bring one of the powders that he had been taking
by order of the physician. Murphy went to the
office to get the powder and when he returned 10
Riggs cell, the prisoner, who had been lying III
wait for him, seized him by the throat and threw
him to the floor. Murphy struggled desperately to
free himself and managed to shout for help, in re-

The latter however overpowered them both, and
freeing himself he rushed up stairs to the Grand

seemed unhurt by the fall and, picking himself up,
he ran down JacksOn-ave i'll the direction OF the
ferry and was lost to sight. A general alarm was
sent out Immediately to the police OF New-lork ana

Rugg is twenty-five years old, 8 feet Q inches in
height, weighs 165 pounds, and is light mulatto,
with mustache lie was dressed III q dark sllrt,
dark trousers and rubber boots and was without
coat, waistcOat and hat when he escaped.


About 1880 pm. two officers arrested colored
man in Long Island City who II was thought was
the escaped prisoner; but upon taking him to the
jail it found to be m stake, and he was set at
liberty He said that he was William DAVID
Phillips.


Keeper Murphy said that Rugg had been quiet
enough since he had been in jail and had not shown
an ugly disposition. He had had several epieptlc
fts and was under treatment at the time. About ten
o'clock tonight"" continued the keeper, he called
for me- and when went to the cell found him
sitting on stool shivering. Hesaid he wanted some
medicine, and gave him one of the powders that
the doctor had left. He drank it and turned to go

Rugg's manner has been heretofore rather timid.
He was arrested for the assault on the Spragues
and afterward confessed to the Townsend assault,
and il was strongly suspected that he was
also guilty of the Maybee murder He mar

dispatch from William Walter Phelps, offer
ing him the nomination for the Vice Presi-

day. He received no dispatch of any kind
from Mr.. Phelps.


Congressman Dingley did not regard the
vote for Clayton and Lynch as strictly draw
ing line as to the relative strength OF
Blaine to that of the field candidates against
him. If the opposing forces accepted the
result in that light, they certainly demon
strated the fact that he was stronger than
even his most active supporters supposed.


The Tribune correspondent at Chicago
writing Tuesday night says: ""TO sum it all
up, to. night Blaine still leads. His nomina-
tion is not only possible, but more than ever
probable. The Arthur men are discouraged
and getting ready to jump. They virtually
concede that their candidates chances are
hopeless. The dark horses. such as Logan,
still feel that their chances have not all gone.
No man can tell what the outcome will be-,
but the present outlook is Blaine


John b. Lynch, the first negro ever elected
to preside over a national convention was
looked at with much curiosity and acquitted
himself with both modesty AMI dignity. Not a
trace of African dialect was in his speech. He
seemed to be a composed and rather courtly
person. He especially announced that his
election was not significant of any choice of
candidate, because he had no bias. He wore
a standing collar, had the facial contour Of
a Southern fire-eater and the brow of a
priest."

He was claimed for Arthur. and as a
Southern republican it was supposed that
he would not be antsgonized by the ad-
ministration. But some of the Arthur
leaders learning that they could not direct

in that they secured the support of the
Edmuuds men and friends OF dark horses
who were afraid that the election OF
Clayton would be taken as Blaine
success. and thus end the chances OF
any other candidate. An analysis OF
the vote cast shows that is7 Of
the 4Sa Lynch votes were cast by anti
Arthur delegates. There were five Arthur
votes given to Clayton. That leaves the

Arthur by the Blaine leaders. There
were SO Logan. Hawley and other dark.
horse delegates who voted for Clayton,
and there were IL Blaine men who sup.
ported Lynch. Deducting the former and
adding the latter to the Clayton votes
(sSs) leaves SOC rs the strength OF Blaine
on the first ballot. This is greater vote
on the first ballot than Mr.. Blaine's
friends claimed for him. So that the result
when fairly examined was encouraging
rather than discouraging to the Blaine
men and created good deal of consterna-
ton among the leaders of the opposition"

 CHICAGO. June 4-It was long after Il when John R. Lynch. the temporary chair man, called the National Republican conven- snce was immense: there was scarcely foot of standing room on the floor or in the gal leries, there being at least five hundred ladies in attendance. Amid the roar of voices MT. Lynch called on Rev. John H. Barrows of the First Presbyterian church of this city for prayer. The prayer laid especial stress on the desirability of Gods blessing on Lynch and the race he represents. and implored that the nominee of the convention should be & Christian man. Carey. of Maryland, asked permission to read 8 memorial. It was granted, and proved to be from the Mary land State Temperance alliance. asking for the adoption of prohibition plank. The convention received it coldly. The memo rial says that if both parties take up the question the alliance would not make it political issue, but if one party did and the other did not the Prohibitionists would sup port that party. The resolution was referred to the proper committee. MT. Hastings, of Delaware, presented resolution referring to the committee on resolutions the question of the presidential term of office; referred Sen- ator Plumb, of Kansas, sent up resolution asgsinst the holding of land and real estate by fol :Zners and declaring that land should be held only by those willing to assume the du- ties of citizenships; it was greeted with ap p!ause. MT. Hawkins, of Tennessee. moved that the rules be suspended and that the fol- lowing resolution be passed:

 Resolved, That every member Of the convention Is bound in honor to support the nominee whoever that nominee may be, and that should hold seat here who is not ready to so agree (Grest ap- plauEe)

 This resolution was the sensation of the session. It was the same resolution offered at the last convention by Roscoe Conkling and it recalled the most dramatic event of the asssmblaqe of 1880, viz, the stand taken by Mir. Campbell, Of West Virginia, the ef- fort of Conkling and the Grant adherents to eject the virginian from the convention and the defense of the re calcitrant Campbell end his tive associates."

 CHICAGO, June 4.-The committed on cre- dentials reassembled this morning at the Grand Pacific. The gain thus far has been for Arthur. The first thing transacted was the reading of the roll of members of the committee as certified to by the secretary of the National committee. The name of Post master Conger of Washington, an Arthur man, appeared on the roll in opposition to Perry Carson, Blaine man from the same district. The roll with Conger as member was adopted. The contest in the Seventh Alabama district was next considered. The regular delegates are Dr. R. A. Mosely, jr., and the Hon. Arthur Bingham. who are both Arthur men. Their seats were contested by Wiiett Warren and Colonel Hanlon, who are Blaine men. Counsel on both sides argued ths case and when submitted to a vote of the committee Mosely and Bingham were seated. The contest in the First Georgia district was between A. N. Wilson and Jane Blue, the regulars, in favor of Arthur, and T. F. Johnson and Joseph Grsen, jr, Blaine men.

at the time by other stirring events, but there
was scarcely more gallant fight made during
the war than that in which Gen. Early defeat

fighting, compel 8, $50 men to retreat, referring

rienced men 1t is far more strange that they
did not kill half of US and capture the balance

Southerner was equal to five Yankees in real
war. In this instance it was no easy task for
five Southerner5 to drive one Yankee Not

THE RAID ON BALTIMORE.

Confederate cavalry, under Harry Gilmor,
started toward Baltimore, but turned north to
Magnolia Station, on the Philadelphia, Will
mington & Baltimore Railroad, where they
burned the depot, bridge, and two northern
| bound passenger trains, robbed the passengers,
captured Maj.-Gen.W. B. Franklin of our army,
cut the telegraph wires, interrupted travel and
all communication with Washington and the
North, and created intense excitement.
Gen. Early army was hindered at Monoc-
acy by the battle till Sunday noon, burying
the dead, caring for the wounded, etc. Mon
day night his infantry were at Rockville, and

within eight miles of Washington, on the Sew

in Baltimore and Washington. Small bands of
Confederate raiders were flying in every direc-

action, in which our troops lost go men killed

THAT THE CAPTURE OF WASHINGTON


was an after thought rather than part Of
Gen. Lees plan for this raid, is quite evident
/ from these three considerations, viz:


First. His route. Had he originally intend
! ed to move upon our Capital, a much shorter
route would be by Gordonsville, or the gaps in
the Blue Ridge Mountains.


/ Second. The time he consumed in marching
/ ieisurely to Hagerstown and Frederick City.
| His appearance before Washington was % days
after Gen. Hunter had left him free to act any
where.


Third One brigade of the Sixth Corps drove
him away from Washington July IL. This
| could not have been done had Gen. Early had
serious intentions upon our city.


Notwithstanding, the fact is not to be ques-
toned for moment that Gen. Early had am
| pie time to have destroyed either Baltimore or
/ Washington before our division arrived at
| Frederick, July 8, had the purpose been con-
ceived two days or even one day sooner than
| it WAS.


While we were countermarching at Fred
! erick July 8, he could have brushed US away
at stroke and marched down the Washington
| pike, arriving Sunday a. m. at our Capital,


which he could have captured in spite of any
| resistance that could have been made with
troops then available. The truth is, Gen. Early
did not give us credit for being so unwise as to
thus expose our Capital and the Border States.


He saw the alarm and CONSERVATION his raid
was making in the North, and made the most
OF it. There was something deeply humil-
| iating in the helpless condition of Washington
and the border that should SO tempt an enemy
to turn for day from plundering, and amuss
himself by marching up to and almost into"

Rest Of the Three.",,"


Monday afternoon about 800 persons |
witnessed the last championship game |
that will be played here for month to |
come, and both clubs played the best
game of the series OF three. The Harris |
burg club. as matter of course, were
again beaten but they worked hard and
are credited with playing a good game,
but eight errors being made, three OF
which we're given to Heinzman for
allowing three batters their base on
balls.


With the exception of this, Heinzman
pitched good game and was well sup
ported both behind the bat and in thel
field. Up to the sixth inning only threeI
hits had been made by the home team.
In the fifth inning Burns opened with
a home run in the third he hit for
three bags and scored on hit of
Lynch. Bastian got in hit in the
fourth inning but did not score. In the
second inning Lynch and Dennis Casey
reached first on errors and scored on a
wild pitch and hit Of Say McCloskey
and Cusick also made hits and four
runs were scored. The seventh inning
yielded four more runs by singles by
Daniel Casey, Burns, Say and McClos-
key, aided by home run by Lynch,
and Bastian being given 20 on
balls.


For the home team Daniel Casey, ''the
boy"" pitcher, played great game, he
striking eleven men out and only one
hit, and that scratch, being made off
his delivery.


McCloskey, although suffering
from the effects of a sprained
ankle, caught him without an
error and only one passed ball. The
visitors did not score until the seventh
inning, when base on balls and two
errors yielded them two runs, which
they increased by another in the eighth
inning on scratch hit by Heinzman, a
passed ball and wild pitch. Only
twenty eight of the visitors batted, one
more than the number put out, two
men reaching first on balls.


The score follows:

Calamity to Their Sufferings.",,"the scenes witnessed were beyond description.
For nearly three months no rain has fallen.
The grass was burned up The crops total
failure. Nearly every creek spring and we'll
was dry. There was scarcely any water in the
north and middle forks of the Hoston river,
Maiden Spring creek is simply dry gulch, and
the Louisa fork of the Big Sandy is a succession
of brackish puddes in the hollow of its rocky
bed. In the town Of Mt Pleasant but one
well contains water. The citizens of Salt
vile carry water for nearly two miles. For
the past six weeks. A deadly plague has swept
this whole section, and at least LOCO persons, in
population not exceeding $1,000, have died.
Cattle and live stock by hundreds have died.
The disease is similar in man and beast. 1t be
gins with gripping pain in the stomach, followed
by excessive fever, bloody hux accompanied
With Vomiting, and then death The sickness
rarely lasts over a day, but depends on the
strength of the individual attacked. The country
is extremely rough, and most of the people live
in cabins up the hollows in the mountains
many are remote from neighbors and whole fam
lies die alone and are left unburied. The de-
Vastation on Moccas;n creek is particularly awful
About thirty families reside distance of eight
miles on its banks. OF the $50 persons in them.
over 100 have died. Physicians are not TO be
had, and the simple remedies of the natives prove
poweress. Mr.. Abbott relates one very sad
case The family of Abraham Smalley consisted
of five persons, the youngest child Of five
years. was found dead The little child had evi
IDENTIFY died last and in its awful hunger had
nearly torn off its mothers breast.


Food is about exhausted, and the people are





and corn meal sells for $S a barrel The mills
cannot grind, and if they could, there is no corn
Gladesville, KY, is almost depopulated, and a
graveyard is about all that,remains of Lebanon,
The immediate cause of the disease is supposed
to be the presence of great quantity of mineral
matter in the water caused by the long drought
and evaporation. In five counties there is not
one thousand bushels of corn nor one hundred
head of live stock. and the tobacco crop is abso-
Iutely nothing Potatoes do not average ten
bushels to the acre There is game in the
mountains, and communication with the outside
world is by themost tedious methods, over mount
aims and rocky PASSES.


Information from Lynchburg, Va, the
same subject is to the following effect


The counties suffering from the and fatal
disease before reported are Lee and Dickinson
and the edge of Scott IN Virginia, and Harlan,
Lee and the adjoining counties in Kentucky
Owing to the isolated position of the district par
ticuars are hard to obtain. Hundreds said
to have died. and, allowing for eXaggeration
it can be affirmed that the mortality is
large Postal Clerk Wells, who has lust ar
rived from that section, after having had the
disease gives sad account of the epidemic
He attributes it to mineral poison in :ho
drought-dried water and says strong and dis
agreeable mineral taste, like that of copperas
exists. At the time he left few springs were
flowing freely and the people were compelled to
DIR nix this impregnated water. Although the
name of the desease is unknown, the people call
it cholera, and were 1t so it could not be more
dreaded or disastrous.


The SYMPTOMS are described as similar to
those of Asatic cholera, followed by terrible
hemorrhages in the bowels, and those attacked
either die or recover in about week 1t is
frequently fatal in twenty y-four hours and some
times in a much shorter period. in most in
stances it visits an entire family, and it is con-
sidered so contagious that in some cases persons
die alone, their friends being afraid to go to
them. There are no figures representing the
actual mortality but it is estimated that over
300 have perlshed in the Virginia counties
named, and, considering the sparse population
and the number taken, the percentage is large.


At the late election the number of deaths con-i
siderably affected the 'majorites at the various
precincts and thirty graves We're counted
in small cemetery. AS result the peo-
pie are demoraized, and local business interests
suffer. A like seourge visited this section in
Z 1854 The country, which is extremely mount
ainous, is of high elevation above the level of
the sea. Cattle are also dying in the same sec
ton. General rains have fallen in this State for
two days past 1t is probable that the drought in
the infected region is now ended.


A special from Charleston w. Va. in regard
to the same matter says Information received
here from Perryvlie Mcdowell county, this State
near the Virginia border gives frightful ac-
count Of the ravages of the disease in the ex
treme Southwestern counties of Virginia, and
the adjoining territory of Kentucky The loss
of life has already been appalling, while the CON
dition of the survivors is terrible in the eX-
treme. No rain has fallen in the Cumberland
mountains in which the infected district is stu
ated, for four months, the drought entailing not
only the almost total failure Of the crops, but
the cutting off of the supply of water
over wide area. Difficulty was experienced
in obtaining water for stock as early as
he middle of August in some localities, but no
actual suffering occurred among the inhabitants
until about the end OF September. when the
dinary sources of supply having for the most
part failed the mountaineers We're compelled, in
order to sustain life, to obtain water for house
hold needs from what were known as poison
(mineral) springs in the mountains, or from tho
small amount remaining in the deep holes of the
oeds of creeks. A persistent use OF the water
soon developed a peculiar disease as deadly as
Asiatic cholera in its nature, which has since
ragged with terrible fatality over half dozen
counties i'll Virginia. West Virginia and Ken
tncky, the loss of life thus far being varousy
estimated at from 400 to 800 Among children
and adults well up III years the mortality has
been the greatest, but no class has been exempt
/ In number Of instances, especially along the
forks of McLean's creek, a tributary of the Big
Sandy river and in the valley of the Powell
river emptying into the Tennessee river whole
families have perished; while in numerous
other cases but one or two members
of household survive Few recov-
cred from the disorder, 60 to so
/ per cent of those attackd dying. this being ac-
counted for by the fact that pure water is still
unobtainahle, and that proper feed and medical

 Hanged to Convenient Tree.",,"RICHMOND, Va, Aug. 3.-Advices received here give disgusting details of an attempted assault on young married lady, named Mrs. Harrison, by brutal negro named John Fitzburgh, near Huntsville, in Rappahannock county, followed by the lynching of the lat ter last night. Fitzburgh was fifty years old and had been attending colored church in the neighborhood of the lady's home on Sun day last. He saw MT. Harrison, her husband, leave home that night, and knew that he was not expected to return. Fitzburgh then went home, armed himself with a revolver and came back to MT. Harrison's. Mrs. Harrison was seated on the porch with an infant in her arms. The negro, who was in 8 nude condition, made infamous proposals to her. She ran into the house, boIted the door and screamed for help Her cries were heard by doctor and a young man i'll the vicinity. They quickly came, but being un- armed, did not kill the negro. They drove him off, however, but he returned again and tected by her neighbors until the return of lodged in the county jail the following day. Since then the news of the occurrence spread and the indignation of the people arose to retributive heat. This eliminated last night in the formation of mob of lynchers, who forcibly took Fitzburgh from the jail and hanged him to convenient tree. There was very little noise or excitement about it, and after effectually doing their lawless work the lynchers retired."

Jim Beckwourth and His Thrilling


Adventures.

Reeoiieetions OF Trapper aud Frontiers
Who. After life Fan of IaeI-
dent and Adventure, Became the


Chief OF an Indian Tribe.

",,"Ltot. ~ sun


In Plumas County there is a fertile
mountain valley IN the heart Of the North
ern Sierras. where for some years Beck
wOnrtb, the famous trapper, guide, Indian
chief and frontiersman, lived. The annals
OF western adventure contain no more in
teresting figure than swarthy Jim Beck
w0urJh, the disc0Verer, in 1851, of this
mountain pass. The writer has met many
persons, army officers and civilians, who
knew Beckwourth. and has talked with
gold hunters whom this fearless guide led
across the Sierras III 1851.


Beckwourth was born in Fredericksburg,
Va, in l79S. His father had been an officer
in the Revolution. About 1906 the family
removed 10 Missouri, and settled twelve
miles below St. Charles, in a region still
called Beckwoarth's settlement. When
only nineteen years old jim Beckwourth be-
Came the hunter for Colonel X. NJ. John
sons expedition 10 treat with the Sacs and
Foxes, and work lead -mines ia the Galena
region. It was not long before BecAwourth
joined General Ashley's Rocky Mountain
Fur Company. From 1917 until he started
for California in 1874, his life was sue
eession OF hairbreadth escapes, of fortunes
made and lost, and of Indian battles. He
served under Bent and Sublette in the
West, and with General Jessup during the
Seminole war in Florida. DE even became
First Counselor of the Grow Nation, and
finally their Head Chief, leading them in
countless forays against the Sioux and
Blackfeet. He always protected the per-
sons and property of the whites while he
was the ruler of the Crows. His popularity
with the tribe, whom be ruled with rod
OF iron, was due to his wonderful knowl-
edge of Indian nature and his unsurpassed
moss-trooper instincts. He was never SO
happy as when in the saddle, leading war
party by night marches to assault Lipan
or Comanche encampments, or TO stampede
their horses and dash away again
like whirlwind. One of the dozen or more
Indian names he had, meant, in English,
Enemy of Horses""


One of Beckwourth's famous feats was
accomplished about 1S22, when he was near
the Snake River trapping beaver. He was
pursued by over two hundred Indians, and
ran all day without food or water cover
ing, it is believed, not less than ninety live
miles before he reached Sublette's Camp.
This feat ranks in the tales OF the West
with Bent's famous ride twenty years
later In 1896, while Beckwourth was in
st. Louis and was still Chief of the Crows,
a foolish trapper told that tribe that he
had been killed. They at once surrounded
Fort Cass with thousands of warriors to
take immediate vengeance. After much
parley, a truce of three months was
z
Beckwourth to come and rescue the be-
leaguered fort, which contained 100000
worth of goods. A trapper named Pappen
was paid 81 900 to deliver the message to
BeckwOurth, and the Crows encamped to
await results. The fur company paid
Beckwourth 5000 and all expenses to re-
turn at once, and he rode, with two COM
panions, the entire distance in fifty days,
and saved the fort from destruction.


After this he traded in New Mexico, and
in 1874 led an expedition TO California,
reaching Los Angeles in January, 1874. He
was one of the most active of the revolu-
tionists of 1915, under General Castro, be-
ing leader of the thirteen American rifle
men who first joined Castro. He was Lieu
tenant of the subsequent corps of 160 which
captured the pueblos of Santa Barbara and
Monterey, defeating Suffers forces. When,
in 1S47, war was declared in Mexico, Beck
wourth and his company Of trappers, num-
bering less than a dozen, collected over | 800
horses in the Los Angeles region, and, start
ing eastward, reached the Arkansas in
safety. He then carried dispatches from
Fort Leavenworth to Santa Fe and other
points. On one occasion ne rode 9l3 miles
in fifteen days. In 1913 ne returned to
California.


Here he helped to bring to justice the
perpetrators of the Reed murders near San
Miguel, where a respected English family
and their servants, eleven in all, were
killed. The ranch was twenty five miles
from the nearest house, and Beck
wourth was the person who discovered
the deed not an hour after it was COM
nitted. He rode seventy two miles that
night, and collected band Of forty men,
70 whom twenty more were added next
day. They separated, and Beckwourth
with twenty men, overlook the fourteen
desperadoes who had killed the family In
order TO get one thousand dollars worth of
gold dust. In the attack two or three Of
the murderers were killed aud the Others
were captured, tried by lynch law, and
shot. After this Beckwourth became fa-
miliar figure at the gold camps of the
Sierras, from Hangtown to Shasta.


Beckwourth was rather under medium
size. but possessed of great strength and
endurance. He was famous for his vivid
descriptive powers in telling of his adven-
lures. lie died in his lonely cabin s.
score Of years ago, vagrant Of the VIII
derness, an uneducated, kind hearted
frontiersnan, less noble than Boone and
Carson, yet not unworthy their companion

Sheriff, Joe Brown. Of San Bernardino,
accompanied by Sheriff Currier and
Deputy Sheriff Geo. E. Gard, on Sun
day took Billy Mcdowell out of the rear
door of the Jail and in close carriage
hurried him off to the 0 A. NJ. train for
San Bernardino before it was known
about town that such movement was
intended. Billy was not in good condi-
tion for walking. and had to be support
ed on each side while walking to the
carriage. There was no knowledge in
San Bernardino of the coming Of Nc
Dowell, and he was safely lodged in Jail
there before the people Of that place
knew Of his coming, SO that no attempt
at lynching could be made.


Yesterday moraing at 10 o'clock he
was arraigned before Judge H. G. Rolfe
of the Superior Court and sentenced to
be hanged on Monday next, March oath.
Unless Governor Stoneman interferes on
or before that time, he will then expiate
his guilt on the scafiold. 1t is satisfac.
tory to know that Judge Rolfe, like a
few other Judges, has departed from the
usual custom OF sentencing culprits to be
hung on Friday. Such custom has no
proper foundation in reason. There is no
seasc in making Friday black day in III Q
calendar. day for retributive justice
above all Others. Besides, as it is the
day that commemorates the death of the
Lord Jesus Christ, the use Of that day
for the execution of criminals is shock
to the holiest emotions Of hundreds of
millions Of Christian believers. 1t is
quite time that no day should be called
hangman's day."" By dispatches in
another column it will be seen that Nc
Dowell, knowing the justice Of his SEN
tence, had nothing to say against 1t.

didn't care which way he got him. II
the authorities here preferred to save hi,

probably preferred to have the dead

Secretary Lincoln rules that colored mer
desirious of entering the signal service will
no longer encounter the obstacles which
have obstructed their pathway. The above
ruling was brought about by w. Hallett
Green, colored student about to graduate
from the College of the City of New York,
7who, some weeks ago. made application in
the regular form for enlistment in the ser
vice. Chief Signal Officer Hazen replied,
stating that Congress, by legislation, had
provided for the enlistment of men of col
or only in two regiments of infantry and
cavalry, and had failed to pass bills pros

|terpreted as an expression of the public
policy of the National Legislature which be
was not at liberty to violate. He therefore
dismissed the application.

held Republican conventions. But
the election Of delegates has not
yet with certainty, indicated the
nomination at Chicago. Arthur
and Blaine are the leading candi-
dates, with the advantage appar-
emily in favor of the former.


The convention in this State
was held on the 22d, Jno. r. Lynch
presiding. 1t was signalized by q
futile contest of the Chalmersites
to get in the Republican party.
The result showed that it takes
two to make a bargain; and that
Chalmers is not yet a Republican.


The following are the delegates,
all but three for Arthur:


Delegates to Chicago for State
at large: b. X. Bruce, Jas. Hill,
j. NJ. Bynum and r. f. Beck.

Harrington; Fifth District, Judge
VIM. Hancock and +. G. Grand
berry; Sixth District, John II.
Lynch aud .. A. Simpson; Sew
enth District, John A. Galbrcath
and Thomas Richardson.


The first resolution urges the
Importance Of the Mississippi river
asa national highway, the necessi-
ty for its improvement and the
protection of the people dwelling
along its banks.


The second declares in favor of a
protective tariff.


The third endorses the Blair bill.


The fourth declares that Missis-
sippi Republicans will support any
Republican that may be nomina-
ted.


The fifth declares that delegates
from States that have no prospect
Of casting their votes for the nom.
inees should support the candidate
most acceptable to the Republican
States.


The sixth heartily endorsed
Arthur's administration, and de-
nounced Longstreet's attempt to
form white Republican party."

 Haven Kennel club began yesterday at Union armory, Meadow street. and under the

 most favorable auspices as far as the manage

 weather and lowery skies, despite which

 there was an attendance highly encouraging

 and auguring well for the public interest in

 the show. Yesterday afternoon the attend ance was large. and between and o'clock the passage ways between the rows of ken

 and caressed as if anxious to take them to

 their hearts at once. There were blood hounds, notable among which for grim and

 lean and un ntamable appearance was MT.

 MT. Siebert's, of Westville, more amiable looking, was still an object of interest; and the rare blooded one of MT. Gale, of Pros pect street, showed many points of good pedigree and doclity. Among the greet

 mastiffs was No. l, Nevison, entered

 by Charles H. Mason, of Bradford Eng

 land, and 49 West Twenty-fourth street, New York city, four years old, price $500,

 winner of 37 first prizes and cups, including specials at New York and at Pittsburg in 1883, as best mastiff of all classes.

of the Victims.",,"TORONTO, Canada, Jan. 4.-The excite
ment over the dreadful railway collision con
tinues unabated. Two more of the injured
died at the hospital, namely, Matthew
Walker and Charles Mcdonald.


The correct list of those dead is as follows:
David CaTruthers, Joseph Keefer, John Douo-
hue, William Luriff, Richard Mulligan,
James White, Thomas Wells, John Rowiett,
John Lynch, Charles Spohr Joseph
Mcdonald, Samuel Cayley, George Pres
colt, John kernaughan, Charles Stan
ley, John Mckenzie, ii. d. Kernon, George
A. j. Seal, John Aggett, Fred Barthroyd,
James Kelly, Hugh Cunningham, and Eddie
Robinson. This makes total of twenty-five
who were killed and have died since the acci-
dent occurred. Nine out Of the nineteen who
were at the hospital have died, and it is likely
half of the remainder will not survive their
injuries. Death in a few cases where the
body was not at eli injured, resulted from in
haling the steam from the boiler, as several
victims were held in certain position among
the wreckage while the escaping steam went
directly into their faces.


Actions will be brought against the Grand
Trunk in every case, it is understood for
heavy damages. and the relatives of one of
the men injured said if tho railway gets off
with paying only S5,o0e,000 damages it will
do well. Several hundred dollars have been
subscribed here for the sufferers already

From a description given of the remains of the ui.- happy girl in the local neWspa- pers it appears they bear out all that had charged against her tormentors. Her hands and feet were frozen, her body is covered with blisterS where she was burned with red-hot irons, and the pinched frame is the best possible proof of the slow starva- tion to which she was subjected.

state Of excitement 1t will be remember.


ed that Garfield called the woman to him,


put his arm around her neck as il to kiss


her, and then shot her. This occurred on


Tuesday night Of last week. She was con-
scious but once after she was Shot.
Yesterday Garfield, who was in jail, told
Officer Runner that he would like to see the
girl, and he was granted the privilege


When he entered the room where she was
lying, he looked at her and laughed. Off.
Ger Runner took him out of the room and
asked him what he thought about it. ~
would like to finish her."" said Garfield
with fiendish grin, and then he burst out
laughing.


The excitement that began when it was
learned that the girl had died, and further
learned that Garfield, on visiting her,
laughed and said he would like to finish
her, resulted in Garfield being mobbed las.
night.


1t was shortly after midnight that the
party of lynchers, masked with white hand
kerchiefs proceeded from their rendezvous
to the Jail, fully equipped with heavy iron
sledge hammers and rope. There were
no great attempts at resistance by the Jail
officials, and none by the police, who knew
that any interference would be futile. The
work had all been mapped out at the place
OF meeting and every man knew his place.
There was no shouting, no loud issuing of
orders. In less than half an hour the Jail
had been forced and Garfield taken from
his cell. Once outside the Jail the lynching
party filed off with their prisoner toward
Dalton 81 Montgomery's lumber yard but
Canield begged to let him die as near as
possible to the place where the murder was
committed. Accordingly he was taken to
a telegraph-po pole in front Of the house where
poor Mollie's corpse lay.


He acted coolly, said he had prepared as
we'll as he could for death, but was not
sure as to what he would meet beyond the
grave. Anyway, he was not sorry for kill
ing Mollie and if he had it to do over he
would do it again. He confessed to have
shot his sweetheart because of little per-
sonal quarrel growing out Of jealousy. He
felt that he deserved his punishment, and
only desired that his body be given his
mother.


Meantime the rope had been thrown over
the cross-beam Of the telegraph pole. Can
field had been pinioned and blindfolded,
and at the sound of command Garfield was
rushed up ten feet in the air and left dang
ling. He died of suffocation without
struggle. Officer Heidenreich, who had
followed the party, was warned away be-
fore the final act


Before leaving the spot the crowd pinned
a note to the body, warning the coroner
not to cut it down till noon. All the city
has been out to see it this morning. The
white handkerchief tied over the face con-
ceals the distorted features, but the dang.
ling body is gruesome sight. Yet every
body says it served him right


According to the statement Of the Sheriff,
Garfield, who was mobbed this morning
was almost dead before being taken from
jail. He had not eaten a bite for three
days, being sick with loathsome disease,
which had assumed dangerous proportions.
The body Of the dead man will be trans,
ferred to Washington to-day."

were opposed to sumptuary laws, and so
Is the Democratic party.


The Republicans opened the campaign
last Saturday night. was in Sacra-
mento. Colonel Creed Hammond was
the speaker. He 10 an able and eloquent
gentleman; but with all his eloquence
ho could not arouse any enthusiasm. So
it is elsewhere. The Republican party
has outlived its usefulness. The honest
men are leaving 1t like rats from sink
ing ship. All over our great Common
wealth the Democratic party tonight
presents MI unbroken front. The news
from Maine helps us, as it clearly shows
that the Republican party is the party
of narrow idoas, and large lease of
power to them will fasten their prohibit
ton ideas upon the country, aud the
great wine interest, the beer interest,
the corr: interest will languish aud die,
and gradually our rights will be
taken away from us. The crank
ridden States Of Iowa, Kansas
and others Of the great Western States
are suffering by the prohibition legisla-
tion of the Republican party, but in
States where the Democratic party is in
power the largest liberty Is allowed the
citizen. And in our own fair State we
have wiped from the Statute books the
laws that take away from the citizen bis
right to do as lie pleases, so long as he
does not interfere with his neighbors.
In 1875 Hendricks was elected to the
office he is now candidate
for and Governor Tilden was elected to
the Presidency. We have almost tho
same battle over again; Cleveland rep
resents Tilden and reform, and with
Governor Hendricks We have as near the
old ticket as possible. There Is retri.
butive Justice in their election to the
high Offices they have been nominated
for, and the American people will see to
it that the great fraud Of 1876 is wiped
out. In California, IN our local affairs,
we as Democrats, may differ. All our
local misunderstandings must be buried
this Presidential year. Every man of
us must rally under the banner of Cleve-
land and Reform. We must unite to
check the downward career Of the Re-
public. We must see to 1t that Del
Vale, your nominee for Congress, il
elected. l have known him long
and well. He has done the State
good service in the Assembly and Senate
and his promotion Is just. No man eau
better represent the interest OF South
ern California than he. Your great in
terests demand that you shall have a
live man in Congress, and Senator Del
Vale is that man. II l had my way
Los Angeles. to-day would have
had a Congressman. .at-Large in the
person OF Joseph ID. Lynch. l was for
him two years ago, aud If he had been
selected Los Angeles would have had a
friend to bet ON, and her interests would
have been carefully guarded. In con.
clusiou, fellow-citizens, let me urge, one
and all, by your votes, to teach the Re.
publicans that what is left of the country
we want as heritage for our children.
Let us show them by our votes they
have betrayed their trust, and an out
ragged people yearn for vengeance. Let
us teach them that the bloody chasm
they speak of Is not wide enough or
deep enough to engulf the labors OF the
American people. Let us give the power
to that party under which the country
prospered, and under which our terri
tory was acquired Except Alaska; they
got that for u.s. Let MS return the gev-
ernment to the honesty and. simplicity
that characterized it in the days Of jack
son and jefferson. When this is done,
when the Democratic party assumes
power again then will arise the dawning
Of brighter era for the Republic, aud
once again We will be a happy aud pros
porous people."

get over the border. Five of them, O. W. Sam

Over ~ thousand persons witnessed the execu-

fear at the near approach of DEATH After be-

of them remarked ''Well boys, if we haven't
lived like gentlemen we will die like them I""

some familiar faces in the crowd, and called
out their names, cheerfuly bidding them good
bye. The nooses were then adjusted when q
second general protest was entered by all tive,.

Judge Lynch has ex- ercised a wholesome influence also, but his services are no longer needed. The law will take care Of the criminal Our courts are admirably offered, and the judges are men of tried ability and courage.

The absence of 1 excitement was very noticeable, especially 1 in the town wards of the city. From the character of the delegates elected it would I appear that the majority of those | to the State convention favor the renomination of Governor Waller, while the nomination for Senator seems to point toward Colonel A. Heaton Robertson There is but little doubt about the Con- eressiona1 delegates being in favor of the present incumbent, MT. Mitchell. For Rep resentatiYes the delegates are all at sea. Among the names mentioned are J. B. Ward, James P. Pigott, Coroner Bollman, s. liar rison Wagner, Eli Mix, and others too nu- merous to mentions For Judge of Probate the only name mentioned is that of Judge York, and it is likely that his nomination is an assured fact. While the Republicans are in the minority so far as this town and sena- torial district is concerned, yet it is not im- probable that they may, as in years past, select candidates that will command the re- spect of a sufficient number of Democratic votes to secure the election of some of their nominees.

 Following is a list of the delegates elected in the several wards:

NEW DOMINION.",,"Collision of Trains-Thirty Men

 Killed and a Number Badly Injured

 A Terrible Wreck Of Life,

 TORONTO, Ont, Jan. 2.-The new year opens with tragedy. The suburban train on the Great Western division of the Grand Trunk railway lest the city at 6:25 this morn ployed at the Dominion bolt works at Hum- ber. When the train was going down the grade at Owen street crossing it collided with a freight train. The engine of the suburban train was smashed to pieces and the cars con- pletely wrecked. Thirty passengers were killed and the remainder more or less serious ly wounded-not one escaping unhurt. Word of the accident WAS immediately sent to this city and five doctors and surgeon were sent out on a special train. The scene at the place of the accident was horrible one. Splinters of wood and broken iron were covered with blood and mangled bodies were lying in every position under the wreck. The wounded were taken to the hospital. A num- Der of dead were still under the wreck. Two of the victims lying under the engine were still alive at 10 o'clock this morning. The cylinder was resting on the chest of one and he cried, ""For Gods sake take me out. :"" There were no means of raising the engine available and the men were being kept alive with brandy. Conductor Barker of the freight train got orders at Mimico and came on to Toronto. He had not been on the division for long time and forgot the subur- ban train. Coroner Linde ordered him ar rested and he has been jailed. He claims that he had the right of way. His train was com- posed of an engine and two empty cars The engineer of the freight escaped with con- fusion of the head, but the fireman was killed. Carter, conductor of the suburban train the engineer and fireman escaped un- hurt. The snow at the accident is red with blood and the ground is strewn with heads, arms and human entrails. All the men were workmen and have fam flies in this city The names of the killed as far as known are: James Whit, donald, - Wells, fireman of the freight;

 - Carruthers, George Haggett, John Ker. naghan, Joseph Macdonald, Richard Multi gan, - Heath, boy; John Eowett. The wounded are: H. Herman, Michael Kelley, W. Rogers, Fred. Burnton, Thomas Mae donald, John Lynch, James Kelley, Alexander Bank, Hugh Cunningham, Ed. Robinson, - Bailey, Pat. Norton. Every occupant of the first car in the suburb an train was either killed or wounded. At Hamilton Conductor Barber of the freight received an order to run to Queen whaFfs giving him the right of way over all trains. He acknowledges that he forgot about the suburban train and thought he had 8 clear track until he heard the whistle for brakes The freight engine struck the boiler of the suburban engine, driving it back into the following car. The cars took fire and the shrieks of the poor wretches pinned in the wreck and slowly roasting to death were awful. No horror was left the imagination to invent. Death in many cases was instantaneous. The scenes at the morgue as tho bodies were brought in no one can forget. Some of the wounded craWled out of the wreck, their limbs hanging in shreds. A secoad calamity was narrowly averted. The conductor of the regular train leaving union station at 7:35 received no notice of the accident and left on time. On reaching the crossing the engineer noticed two men waving their arms and the train was stopped within 8 few feet of the wreck. Twsnty-one bodies in all have been recovered and identified."

A NOTABLE DECISION.",,"l The constitution of the United States says

 that ""All persons born or naturalized in the

 United States and subject to the jurisdiction 1 thereof are citizens of the United States and l of the State wherein they reside"" It has

 been argued that birth does not ipso facto

 confer citizenship, and that in order to con- stitute person native or natural born citi- zen of the United States, his father, or in case of illegitimacy his mother, must be a citizen at the time of his birth. But the Cir cult court of the United States in California says differently. The question presented for decision was whether boy born in Califor- mia, whose parents had resided in that State twenty years. but had always re- mained subjects of the Emperor of China, was 0 citizen of the United States The cause was argued before three judges MT. Justice Field of the Supreme court of the United States, Circuit Judge Sawyer of the ninth federal circuit, and District Jud ge Sabin of Nevada. They unanimously de cided that the boy was @ citizen. The opin- ion is written by MT. Justice Field. He holds that the purpose of inserting the words land subject to the jurisdiction there of"" in the constitutional provision we have quoted was not only to exclude from citizen ship the children of foreign ambassadors and children born on public vessels of foreign powers within the territory of the United States, but also to except such persons born in this country as might choose to renounce their allegiance to our government It was intended to recognize the right of expatria tion Thus, under the constitution, 0 man born in the United States who had exer- cised that right and chosen another country would no longer be subjected to the jurisdic- tion of this, and hence would not be citizen. With these qualifications, the simple fact of birth in the United States is sufficient to es- tablish citizenship.

 Justice Field cites with approval the New York case of Lynch against Clarke, decided forty years ago, in which the court remarked: FFI am bound to say that the general under standing of the legal profession and the uni versa1 impression of the public mind so far as have had the opportunity of knowing It, is that birth in this country does of itself constitute citizenship. Thus when at an election the inquiry is made whether per son offering to vote is citizen or an alien, if he answers that he is Q native of this coun- try it is received as conclusive that he is 8 citizen No one inquiries further""

 The California decision is interesting and important It's effect is practically to hold that all persons born within the territory of the United States of foreign percentage are to be deemed citizens unless they are the chil- dren of the diplomatic representatives of other governments, or unless they were born on the public vessels of another power, or unless they have renounced their citizenship in this country."

posed the resolution, hoping the Con.

in the manner proposed. Winkler, Of
Wisconsin, also opposed the resolution.

willing to support the nominee of the
Convention he should not participate in
its deliberations. tCheers.) No harm
could come Of its adoption, and he
thought its adoption desirable in view
of certain whispers in the air. Knight,
of California advocated the resolu-

whispers in the air, and Curtis,
of New York, warmly opposed the
resolution, and referred in the couise OF
his remarks to the act OF the Convention
which nominated Lincoln twenty-four
years ago, where similar resolution
was introduced and voted down. He
also reminded the Convention of what

At 1:25 Chairman Lynch raped the
Convention to order and called on hcv.
John III. Barrows, Of the First Prcsby-
tcrian Church of Chicago, for prayer.
The Convention recognizes the clerical
gentleman, and order is instantly secured.
The prayer laid especial stress on the de-
STABILITY of Gods blessing on Lynch and
the race he represents, and implored that
the nominee of the Convention should lie
a Christian man. The prayer was short
and to the point.


A number of resolutions and memorials
were presented and read and referred to
the committee on resolutions.


General John b. Williams, of Indiana.
chairman of the Committee on Permanent
Organization, reported that ths commit
tee had selected General John 3. Hen
derson, of Missouri, for permanent chair
man and would request the Secretary to
read the list of Vice Presidents and Sec
retarieS.


Charles w. BiI)ee, of Michigan, was
selected as principal Secretary. The re-
port was agreed to.


Grow, Hoar and Williams, Of Indiana,
were appointed committee to conduct
General Henderson to the platform. He
spoke in low tone and could not be
heard but a few feet distant. He said the
past history of the party was, the Union
preserved; slavery abolished and its old
victims on the floor of the convention;
financial strength maintained and the
pulse of industry throbbing. These were
some of the fruits Of Republican work. The
embarrassment of the Republican party
was not in the want, but in the plenti-
tude of material for Presidential timber.
New York had true and tried candi-
date. [Cheers. Vermont, one whose
virtues were as solid as a rock. Ohio,
one whose history is lasting. The Re-
publican party of Illinois, one who never
failed to discharge his public duty in the
Councils of the Nation, or on the field Of
battle. Maine had a man who was en-
dcarcd to the hearts of his friends aud
whose brilliancy challenges the admira-
ton of the world.


The scene when these words were ut
tered was striking. Half the convention
and nearly all the galleries rose to their
feet and cheered and waved their hand
kerchiefs, hats, etc. Silence was re-
stored, only for the same scene to be re-
peated. A third time was 1t enacted.
Then delegate from Iowa shouted:
""iit 'em again."" and once more the he Ii
shook. 1t was the most striking ahd
hearty demonstration yet seen in the con-
vention. A reference TO General Sher-
man was warmly received, and the speak
cr concluded.


Recess was then taken until seven
O'Clock p. m, as no committees were
ready to report.


EVENING SESSION.


Chairman Henderson called the Con-
vention to order at 1885 p. m. and made
the following announcement:


The Committee on Credentials have the
honor to notify the Convention that, as
important business was occupying the
time of the committee, the committee
will not be able to report to the Conyen.
tion this evening.


Mr.. Curtis of New York: l hold in my
hand petition of the American Peace
Union which | ask to have referred to

The Convention then adjourned till to-

time of the revolution, and thanked the
Lord for all he had done for the Repub-

The reading OF the platform was inter-
rupted by long and continued applause.
The name of President Arthur was re-
peatedly cheered and at various stages.
In cheering the reading of the section re-
lating to the tariff, the vast audience be-
came almost uncomfortable and made the
roof ring with it's applause. A similar
greeting gave recognition to the state
ment-that there should be no foreign in
tervention with American affairs. 1t was

immense crowd of admirers of Blaine
were shouting in one immense, never
ending shout, something like the roar OF
a tempest now swelling and sinking;


The baud itself came to the ala OF the
houters, and thundered with its brasses
and drums. Although five minutes had
passed. the enthusiasm of the B!aineites
knew no END, ana the roar OF their ap-
plause still continued.


At last the President, who had been
looking with interest upon the scene be-
fore him, seized his gavel and gave some
raps Herewith. The crowd was silent

chairman rapping, again burst out
in another shout After the chair
man had succeeded in pro-
ducing comparative quiet, Judge West OF
Ohio was introduced. The sensation was
intense, and the interest in Mr.. West, on
account Of his commanding presence and
sympathy for his infirmity, brought all to
silence in the vast hall, while the name
of


JAMES G. BLAINE,
""our Henry of Navarro"" was placed in
nomination in an impassioned address.
G. K Davis, of Minnesota, seconded
the nomination of Blaine.


The calling of the roll was continued by
the Secretary until the State of New York
was reached. When New York was called
came the opportunity of the friends of Ar
thur, and well was it improved. Such
burst of enthusiastic ap-
plause upon the part of the
general audience, such an uprising and
cheering of great body of the dele
gates and waving of flags showed the
numbers and earnestness. The colored
delegates specially raised their voices
(and their hats) and added to the gen.
eral applause. Flags were again
swung upon the platform and
along the sides of and in the hall,
After fifteen minutes Of this enthusiastic
cheering the chairman raped twice to
stop the cheers, but was only cheered for
his trouble. He raped thrice and the
crowd sang ""Marching Through Geor.
gia."" Again he raped and they gave
three cheers and tiger for Arthur, after
which the business proceeded.


Martin l. Townsend, of New York,
took his place upon the platform. The
house cheered and applauded for sixteen
minutes and endeavored if possible to
:ounteract the enthusiasm gotten up by
the friends of Mr.. Blaine few minutes
previous. As SOOH dS IL Was pOSSiDic W
be heard the chairman raped vigorously
on the table with his gavel and said:
""Gent emen of the Convention, Mr..
Townsend, of New York""


A speech thus inspired could but be de.
livered in burning words, and the nomi-
nation of


CHESTER A. ARTHUR,
of New York, was presented before the
in, ash hn for
gotten by those fortunate enough to hear
the words of the great orator.


The nomination of Mr.. arthur was sec.
onded by III. H. Bingham, Of Pennsyl-
vania, and John Il. Lynch. of Mississippi,
followed by Winston, of North Carolina,
and Pinchback, of Louisiana.


The calling of the roll was proceeded
with until Ohio was reached, when Judge
Foraker proceeded to the platfor III ana
placed in nomination


JOHN SHERMAN,
of Ohio Judge Holt of Kentucky
seconded the nomination of Mr.. Sher-
man.


The Secretary continued to call the
States; Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode
Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas
and then Vermont.


When the last named State was called,
Governor Long of Massachusetts, pro-
ceeded to place before the Convention
the name of


GEORGE f. EDMUNDS,
of Vermont.


The nomination Of Mr. Edmunds was
seconded by Mr.. Curtis, of New York.


At the conclusion of Curtis speech, the
clerk continued to call the roll of States
until the completion thereof.


No other State responding with NOM
inee, Foraker, of Ohio. moved that the
Convention proceed to ballot for nomi-
nee for President of the United States.
This was met with strong opposition,
and after determined display of dilatory
tactics the Convention voted, at 80 g..
m, to adjourn till ii a. IN.


FOURTH DAY.


CHICAGO, I'LL. June 9.
The fourth and critical day of
the Republican National Convention
opened with the public pulse beating with
painful intensity, figuratiyely speaking.
1t looked as though all Chicago had turned
out to look upon or wait for the event OF
the day. black mass of human beings
lined the lake front, and the streets lead
ing to the Exposition building were a jam.
Inside it was as bad if not worse
than last night. For the first time every
delegate was in his seat fifteen minutes
before the hour at which the Convention
was called to order and from floor to
roof the vast building was packed like
sardine box.


At 30 the Chairman ascended the
platform but seeing that the Convention
was not in mood for business settled
down in his seat. The band struck up the
familiar stains Of 'Down by the Swanee
River"" which was changed to Dixie and
every foot in the audience stamped the
refrain


Silence was restored at last and Rev.
Dr. Scudder led in prayer.


The roll was called for members of the
National Committee not named yesterday
The Chair ordered the calling of the
roll for the nomination of President.

Convention Notes.


Mr.. Clayton was not nominated for
temporary chairman in the national commit
tee by Blaine man. He was suggested by
Mr.. Morey of Louisiana, an Arthur man.


Mr.. Lynch. is a muatto. rather under me-
dunn size, with fine face and the bearing
of a cultivated gentleman In dress he is
neat even to elegance. He is fine orator,
has a deep, well modulated voice and very
graceful manner.


VIM. Walter Phelps, one of the most ac-
tive of Mr.. Blaine's friends, voted for Lynch
and against Clayton for temporary chairman.
ThiS hot tho claim of tho Rlaipa m
that the Clayton vote was not test of their
strength is true.


Ex Gov. Long of Massachusetts, believes
that nomination is not at all probable at the
first days balloting. The unattached dele
gates are confident of their power TO prevent
a stampede, and therefore is not disposed to
hurry matters.


Gen. Sherman has telegraphed ex-senator
Henderson saying he would not accept the
nomination if offered not serve if elected.


The scene at midnight at the Blaine head
quarters at the Grand Pacific battles de-
scription, Thousands of adherents of the
plumed knight crowded into the spacious
parlors and surrounding corridors. Amidst
the intense enthusiasm Tom Bayne mounted
a chair and read the names of forty delegates
who had voted for Lynch, but who were also
pledged to vote for the man from Maine.


Powell Clayton is Northern man, and
was good soldier At the close of the war
he became citizen of Arkansas, where he
soon took an active part in politics. He was
governor, senator, ETC., and the most promi-
nent figure in the politics of the State until
he fell into the hands of the Bourbons.


The friends of Mr.. Blaine urge that every
thing that has thus far occurred in the con-
vention and out, strengthens the position of
their favorte, and that to talk of dark horses
is to overthrow the clearly expressed will of
the republicans of the country that james G.
Blaine should be their standard bearer in the
impending presidential struggle."

ate oration in the presence Of a vast
crowd of people.


Miss Abbie Kean read Lincoln's

The work of relief continues, without any evil
dences that it will stop short of supplying the
| necessities of the destitute. The receipts yes
terday swelled the fund in the hands of the
Board of Trade committee TO more than $4,000,
and the contributions received by the different
grand lodge organizations, which are handling
their own funds, will probably make the total
amount which has been collected here for the
benefit of the sufferers between $13 900 and
$l5,0 Before the end of next week the re-
ceipts will probably amount to double this sum.
Many of the subcommittee for collecting con-
tributions have not reported and there are many
sources from which large additions to the fund
may yet be expected. This morning collection
will be made in all the public schools in the city,
and on Sunday contributions will be taken up in
the various churches. Several of the charitable
entertainments for the benefit of the fund
are yet to be held, and many hundred dollars
which have been subscribed have not yet been
paid to the committee. The hberality with
which the laboring men and the poor people are
giving is astonishing Everybody gives some
thing, and the poorer class largely exceed the
proportion of their means in their contributions.
In many of the factories the employees have given
their wages for day, and this, TO the laboring
man with family to support, means the self-de
nial of so much comfort. The continued rise of
the water and the chilling change in the temper
ature, doubtless had the effect to quicken the
charitable impulses of those who felt sympathy
for the sufferers.

in a day or two. During the morning telegram
received from Lawrenceburg, stating that
people there were supplied with food sufficient
to last them until Tuesday, and no more ship

From the reports received it is Eevident that
the greatest destitution now exists at Jefferson
vile, and along the river between that point and
Evansville. Nothing has been heard from
eral of the towns which are supposed to be inun-
dated, and it is feared that there is much suffer
ing The relief boat sent out by the Board of
Trade to supply the upriver sufferers started
from Madison yesterday afternoon, and will
probably reach Rising Sun some time tomorrow.
The expedition for the relief of the destitute
along the river below Jeffersonville will be
larger by far than any other that has been
proposed. The steamboat chartered for
the trip will leave Madison to-
morrow. and will carry rations for
100000 persons, large addition to the stock
having been purchased yesterday. Among those
who will go on the expedition are Governor
Porter, A. D. Lynch, president of the Board of
Trade; v t Malott, J. A Closer, George NJ

at the request of the relief committee, will ac-
company the expedition to give medical aid to
the sufferers. The boat will go down the river
as far as Shawneetown, H., and ten days will
probably be required to make the trip. There
are fifteen twenty towns between New Albany
and Evansville which are supposed to be wholly
or partly under water, and it is expected that a
great deal of suffering will be found.

DIR. Frank iirstol, Of Chicago, Chairman
Sabin, on behalf of the Republican Com.
mittee, called the convention to order.
lie said Chicago was known as the Con
vention City. Ii was the held of Re-
publican victory. Here it was that the
immortal patriot. Abraham Lincoln, was
chosen. Here the party chose that
great chiellain. General Grant. Here it
nominated that honored soldier, that
great statesman. that representative cit.
izen, James A. Garfield. [Cheers. Every
action OF the party ON this historical
ground had been followed by victory.
Having succeeded against its opponents
on all former occasions, it was about to
put the house in order for another con.
ilict. As consequence of vote
adopted by the last convention, the
present body was largely formed ot men
instructed by their own constituents and
it was therefore to be hoped that the
voice of the people would he largely
puissaut in its deliberations. Applause
He closed with the expression OF hope
for victory, and proposed for Temporary
Chairman Hon. Powell Clayton, of Ar.
kansas.


When the Chairman had concluded
and mentioned the name OF Clayton II.
&. Lodge, OF Massachusetts,, proposed
the name of John X. Lynch, OF Missis'
sippi. lie said they recognized the
claim of the South and therefore he had
proposed this second name as one nc
ceptablc to the Republican Convention.


Sias b. Butcher, of New York, sec
onded the nomination of Lynch.


AT this hour great sensation was ere
ated by speech from w. w. Morrow,
OF California. He said that harmony
was essential, aud it could be best
secured by not raising factional issues.
1t had been the practice for forty years
for the National Committee to select the
Temporary Chairman of the Convention,
and departure could not now be made
from the custom without creating bitter
ness OF feeling.


There were several delegates on
their feet to reply, but the Chairman
recognized George William Curtis, oi
New York The announcement was
greeted with the widest applause. Cur
tbs said this was supreme council OF
the party representatives, who met TO
open the campaign of 1854. 1t had been
unquestionably customary for the Ma.
tional Committee to name the tempora
ry Chairman, and for the Convent ON to
ratily it; but ii the party, as here repre-
sented, desire it, it also unquestion;ibly
had right to revise the action of the
National Committee in this matter, and
to make a Chairman of it's own choos.

dents OF the Day Meetings OF
Delegations",,"Chicago, June 3.-The proceedings of
to-day, while characterized by great
earnestness and keen watchfulness to
detect any evidence of the tides turning
in any direction, were not prolific in
dramatic incidents. The first incident
Of note was when the name of Powell
Clayton, OF Arkansas, as choice of the Ma
tional Committee for temporary Chairman
of the Convention, was announced, when
Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts,,
rose and moved to substitute the name
of John X. Lynch, one of the colored
delegates from Mississippi. Though
some such action was not unexpected, il
caused a de:ided sensation. Ii was
known last night that there was move
ment on foot looking to putting forward
the name OF b. X. Bruce, OF Mississippi,
the colOred man who was one Of tue
Vice. Presidents OF the last National
Convention aud who welded the gavel
as Chairman for short time
at the request of Senator TIoar,
who was permanent Chairman.
But it was stated that Bruce
refused the candidacy, which was then
transferred to Lynch. The result of the
ballot for Chairman was the signal for a
general outburst. The delegates rose,
climbed upon chairs, swung their hats,
handkerchiefs, canes and umbrellas in
the air and cheored Justify, and when it
subsidized Gov. Clayton, with great ap.
parent calmness, moved to make the
choice unanimous.


The leaders of the Edmund's move.

carried an empty sleeve, but he carried
be,ides a heart true 10 the Republican
party, and he believed II TO be to the
best interests Of that party TO elect Mr..
Lynch as its Temporary Chairman.


Thurston, OF Nebraska, expressed the
idea that II IL was the intention Of the
Convention to overlurn the action OF
the National Committee, 1t should not
be done under pretext which masked
the real design. While recognizing the
c0lored element they should do justice

for a colOred man to sit on the iloor OF

BENJAMIN, Of Arkansas, moved the
nomination Of Powell Clayton, az man
who had done more than any other
Southern Republican TO elevate the Re
publican cause in the South. This was
empbatieally, he said, Convention OF
the people, aud every delegate had an
undOubted right 10 free expression OF
his opinion and to have his vote record

Mr.. Harrow. of Michigan, argued that
the question should be settled not by
call Of the roll, but by call Of States.


Mr. Pron'iss, OF Missouri, could not
under tand the object Of the proposition
TO ignore the action Of the National
Committee. A refusal to endorse that
nomination wonld & forward ""a a stigma
on n man who was TO be honored as q
citizen and soldier and statesman.
Powell Clayton bore the mark of his
love for the national flag.


Mr. Theo lore Roosevelt. of New York,
favored the motion of Mr.. Lodge. 1t
was not without precedent TO set aside
the aetion,of the committee.


The roll call was then proceeded with,
when il was announced that Lynch had
t3l votes and was elected Temporary
Chairman, Clayton polling 3S7.


A scene of the widest confusion on.
sued The delegates rose In their seats,
cheefed, swung their hat, and shouted.
The spectators joined in the demonstra.
tion.


On motion of Clayton, the vote was
made unanimous. The Chairman ap.
pointed Powell Clayton, OF Ark, II. &.
Lodge, Of Mas. aud w. II. Taft, of
south Carolina, committee to escort
Lynch TO the chair. As the committee
appeared the applause was hearty aud
the feeling Of disappointment seemed to
disappear. Mr.. Lynch made good
impression by his quiet and mod
est demeanor. The Chairman said
that he had the honor and great
pleasure of presenting to the Conven-
ton as its Temporary Chairman the
Hon. John r. Lynch, of Mississippi.
Applause


Mr. Lynch, in taking the chair, said:
""Gentlemen of the Conv ention-I feel
that ought not to say that thank you
for the distinguished honor that you
have conf,rred upon me, but do, never
iheless. and accept from the standpoint
that no patriot should tail to re
spond to his country's call, and that no
loyal member of party should fail to
comply with the demand of his party""
Continuing, MIR. Lynch expressed the
hope that the candidate chosen, whoever
he might be, would have tho hearty
support of the entire Republican
party. The American people, he said,
will never consent to have political
party gain the ascendency in the Gov
ernment whose chief reliance is on n
fraudulent ballot aad on violence ut the
polls. Concluding, he said: 81 thank
you for the honor you have conferred
upon me.


At the suggestion of Hon. Jno. ""A.
Martin. Secretary of the National Com
nittee of the United States, Hon. Titus
Shea,d, of New Y ork, and j. W. Lee, of
Penn, were chosen Assistant Secre-
taries, to serve during the presidency of

The Chairmen of the several delega-

A careful study of the vote on the
question of Temporary Chairman does
not appear to have been really a test OF
strength, as some delegates voted with a
view to sustaining the action of the
National Committee, leaving other ques-
tions to be considered later, while others
voted for Lynch with view to its effect
on the colored vote. Blaine and Logan,
after the vote, estimated that they held
greater strength in the committee than
they had supposed, while the adhere is
OF the independents and dark horses
seemed to feel satited with the position
which they held between the great con
tending forces.

IN the Treasury can be wisely used in

demand that the National Government
prohibit and punish polygamy in all
Territories and place the government of
Utah in friendly hauds by the creation
of legislative commission.

ference was held here Saturday and yes

Ind ans. including teven sub-chiefs. and
Captain Upham. Of the First Civalry, OF
Fort Walla Walla. It was held for the
purpose of hearing the complaints of
the Indians upon whose ranches some
white men had flied. Captain Upham,
through an interpreter, read them the
law on the subject Of retaining land to
the exclusion of whites, viz: That they
must observe tribal relations and de-
clare their intention to become citizens
and file on land in every respect
as white men. They replied that
il was violation Of their religion to
deal in land; that the Great Chief had
made them from the dust OF earth. After
they wandered ON its surface for GER
tain length Of time they returned to its
bosom and again became part Of the ele-
mentary elements Of the earth. Dealing
in land they regarded as dealing in their
own fash and blood. Mool, one of the
sub chiefs, remarked literally translat-

The Indians represented in this con-

entered just behind the left ear and
made its exit on the right side Of the

ible where the ball entered. showing
that he must have been shot from o

spot in the center OF the forehead is
believed TO have been caused by a
blow from a club. which fractured

victim was first stunned by the blow
in the forehead, and that afterwards
his own pistol was taken from his
pocket, with which the assassin com
pleted his work. When found, his
hands were stretched out full length
by his sides, and the pistol was found
under his body, a position utterly in

were out in search of suitable ever
green for a Christmas tree, when what
she supposed to be brilliant stone Of
some kind sparkled in the sunlight. She
picked it up, saw that it greatly resem-
bled gold. but threw it away, little
dreaming OF the value of it. Another
nugget Of similar character was oh.
served aud Halle put it in her
pocket, intending to bring it home
for shelf ornament. However,
her surprise may be imagined when
upon her return to the house, she
was told that she had found nugget of
gold. Mr.. J. w. Lynch at once re-
paired to the spot, satisfied himself with
the 'lay of the land"" and at once came
to the city for Mr.. Mendenhall To-
gether they made three locations. dis
covering plainly-defined vein, which
they propose to work for all there is in
it. Reports from there late this after
noon are to the effect that gold has been
found in paying quantities, We hope
that such is the case. Many people
drove out to the new discovery to-day,
and claim-staking was largely indulged
in, 1t is now in order to follow up the
vein, or veins, and prove 10 the world
that we have known what we have been
talking about all along."

| that the people OF San Bernardino were
willing 10 await the execution as np-
pointed by law, but no longer. 1t was
raid that an organized vigilance COM
mittce had existed all the while, which
could and would, on occasion take Nc
Dowell out of jail and hang him, II he
were not dealt with according TO his
sentence. and that, had it not been for
the fact that the murdered girl, Maggie
O'Brien, and her destroyer Mcdowell,
never were residents of San Bernardino
county, the outraged community would
have revenged themselves when the
reprieve of the Governor was tele-
graphed.


THE scARFoLD.


The scaffold was erected on the west
erp siie Of the Court House, in front OF
the side entrance to the jail, and WINS
enclosed by plank fence about twenty
| five feet. high. The top of the gibbct
was barely visible from the street. 1t
was Of the conventional character SO well
known by woodcuts In dime literature.
It was about l8 feet high, and the fall
was u feet. The fence was OF q
very fimsy manufacture, and through
the interstices and knot holes
numerous curious eyes were peering at
an early hour. The rain which had
fallen ali night had discolored and swol-
| len the pine wood of this dismal struo-
| ture and made it look still more terrible.
A solitary carpenter was on the platform
perfecting arrangements, attending 70 the
trap and fastening the rope. Alter Ut
tie while two men brought sack weigh
| ing 250 pounds, with which the rope
was tested and stretched.


PREPARATIONS FOR THF LAST HOUR.
A great many people kept arriving.
and soon the outer, as well as the inner
room Of the Sheriff's office was filled.
| Then fat man, with little bundle in
| his hand, arrived AMI the word was
passed that the barber had come to
shave the condemned man for the last
| time. Very soon afterwards, at about
| fifteen minutes to o'clock, the prisoner
was awakened and he rrt o,eded 10 bathe
and dress. A very fine black diagonal
suit. new under clothing and linen, and
evening shoes, as well as o light colored
satin neck-tie, had been forwarded to
Mcdowell by his mother, who since an
early hour had been awaiting his wax.

brief moments which he could yet claim
as bis own in this world. Mrs. Bell then
entered the cell and very soon litter the
Rev. Edgar Dunbar, a Methodist minis.
ter, who has been McDowell's spiritual
advisor since his recapture. made his aP-
pearsnce. The door was then closed,
until the breakfast time for the doomed
| man arrived. Just before this he
ASKED FOR COCKTAIL,
And glass Of brandy was brought him
by one Of the death watch. This; 1t 10
averred by the jail officials. was the only
stimulant given the prisoner from the
| time he woke up until the moment that
he was swung into eternity. A tempting
breakfast had been provided, but Nc
Dowell felt no appetite. He left all IN
tasted, excepting the coffee, which he
drank eagerly. At 9.25 III, casket which
was to contain the remains OF the man
vet alive was brought in through the
main hall of the Court House, and this
gave rise, among the great crowd which
| filed the hall to many jeers and jibes,
shouts and boisterous laughter, which,
| no matter how deserved the punishment
| then to be meted out, we're excessively
| out Of place there, and showed but little
| feeling for the sorrowing mother, on the
floor below, weeping at the horrible fate
so soon awaiting her son.


| At this iuncture the Sheriff gave or
ders TO admit those present into the en-
closure

And more than three hundred persons,
| among whom were many women-far
too many-fiIed down the Jail stairs into
the yard.


The HERALD reporter, who until then
| had had no opportunity to obtain per-
mission to enter the cell, now sought
Sheriff Burkhart, but could not obtain
this officials permission. The officer
excused himself by saying that the pris-
oner was with his mother and that posi-
lively no one could be admitted until
she went. However, after interviewing
Under Sheriff Brown, the permission was
very graciously granted, and the re-
porter, in company with detective Har-
ris, entered


THE DEATH CELL.


II is o large, bleak, whitewashed room,
containing an iron tank in the east cor
ner, Q small cot, table and two chairs,
with windows looking upon the scaffold
ami the enclosure. Fortunately the
blinds were down, 90 that the view was
hidden from Mrs. Bell. Mcdowell was
sitting upon . chair facing towards the
door, in front Of table upon which
stood his untasted breakfast, and where,
amongst some articles of underwear, lay
sack Of tobacco, cigarette paper and o
bottle Of Hoyt's Cologne. He was
elegantly dressed and with the right
knee negligently thrown over the left
leg, listening to his mother and his
minister, Mr.. Dunbar. On the opposite
side stood the Rev. s. G. Lines, the
Episcopal clergyman who also joined in
the conversation occasionally.


THE DOOMED MAN,


A tall, blonde, young man OF about
twenty-six years OF age, was well shaped
and. had it not been for m unintellectu.
al face, would have been called pre-
possessing. His features presented that
peculiar iistless and unpleasant appear
ance 90 often noticed in people who use
opium and his dropping eyelids, which
seemed barely able to support the faint
light that permeated the cell, added to
the impression that he was then under
the influence Of the drug or was 50
saturated with it as to have lost the
power to realize the horror of his posi-
tion. He was preternaturatly calm,
20 calm in fact that no possi-
bic doubt could remain in the
mind Of any bystander that 1t was not
the true condition Of his mind. He was
far calmer than any one there present
with him.


Deputy sheriff Elliott, at exactly a
quarter to ten, proceeded to read


THE DEATH WARRANT


To Mcdowell, who listened with great
attention until he had concluded. Then
Mrs, Bell and two ladies who accom-


panied her came and sat with him again,
and the following conversation ensued;


""McDowell, the time has now come
in which, ii you wish to avail yourself
of il, to make . statement here to us or

The prisoner cast . quick glance at


Mrs. Bell, who at once said:

ported are Lee and Dickenson, and the edge of
Scott in Virginia and Harand, Lee and ad-
joining counties in Kentucky Owing to the
isolated position of the district particulars are
hard to obtain. Hundreds are said to have
died and allowing for exaggeration it can be
affirmed that the mortality is large. A postal
clerk who has just arrived from that section,
after having had the disease gives q sad &C.
count of the epidemic He attributes it to
mineral poison in the drought which dried up
the water. The water, ne says, has a strong
and dlsagreesble mineral taste like that of cop
peras. AT the time he left few springs were
flowing freely and people were cmpelled to
drink this impregnated water. Although the
name of the disease is unknown people call il
cholera and we're it so it could not be more
dreaded or disastrous. The symptoms are de-
scribed as similar to those of Asiatic cholera,
followed by terrible hemorrhages of the bow
els, and these attacked either dio or recover in
about week. 1t is frequently fatal in twenty
four hours and sometimes ever in q much
sho rter time, and it is considered so contagious
that IN some cases persons died alone, their
ftlonos being afraid TO go to them. 1t is esti-
mated that over 800 have pershed in the Vir-

famous is OF high elevation above the level

for two days past, and it is probable that the
drought III the infected districts is now ended.


Another Account.


CHARLEsTowN, W. Va, Nov. 20.-Informa-
tien received here from Perryville, Mcdowell
county, in this State near the Virginia border,
gives frightful account of the ravagss of &C.
called cholera in the extreme southwestern
counties OF Virginia and the adjoining terri
tory OF Kentucky. Making every allowance
Tor exsggeration, the loss of life has been ap-
palling while the condition of the survivors
are terrible in the extreme. No rain has fallen
IN the infected district for four months. Diff
hculty was experienced in obtaining water for
stock as early as the middle of August in some
localities, but no actual suffering occurred
among the inhabitants until about the end OF
September when the mountaineers were COM
PEELED in order to slstain life to obtain water
Tram what were known as ""poson' springs
ana the persistent use Of the water soon devel-
oped peculiar disease as deadly as Asiatic
cholera in its nature which has since ragged
with terrible fatality over half dozen coun.
tlesain Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky.
The loss OF life TINS far is variously estimated
at from 400 to 800. Among children and
aoults well up In years the mortality has been
the greatest, but no class has been exempt.
The drying up Of streams has necessitated the
stoppage of numerous small grist mills along
the mountain valleys and the population for
the most part appears to be in the most abject
want and misery.


The locality is almost inaccessible to the out
side world, there being no railroad within 100
miles, aud it is very difficult to obtain reliable
news, but even If only one-half OF what is al
legged be true the calamity is one of most
serious nature and calls for action by the su-
thorities and the public."

CARS GO THROUGH 4 BRIDGE.

An Accident on the Virginia Midland Road


Narrow Escape Of the Passengers.",,"As the south-bound express train on the
Virginia Midland Railroad was approaching
the bridge across the James river, one mile
and a half north of Lynchburg, the engineer
applied the air brakes to check the rapid
speed of the train. The brakes refused TO
work. Finally he sounded the whistle for
the brakemen TO put down the regular
brakes. Here also some difficulty was met
with. and the speed of the train remained
unchecked. The train rushed on TO the
bridge. striking the third span just over the
main channel with tremendous force. The
two Pullman sleeping cars plunged into the
river. while the passenger coach next TO
them was thrown across the track. where it
balanced itself. As if by the hand Of Prov
idence. the tracks Of the sieepers broke
loose from the body of the cars. which
allowed these TO float long enough TO afford
an opportunity for the rescue OF the pasSen-
gers from drowning. Nearly all of them
were in their berthS asleep At the time the
accident occurred. Conductor Nm. King,
who was on the platform or one OF
the cars was thrown into the river. and
although he had two ribs broken. he SWAIN
to the cars and helped the passengers
through the windows. Most of the passen-
gers were taken out through holes cut III
the yentilators AT the top of the cars, to
which the water finally reached. There was
about twenty passengers in the sleepers.
After the water had covered the top of the
windows Mrs J. 5. Farden pushed her two
monthS-old child through window. and
held il above the water until rescued and
then she came out the same way. No one
was killed."

 The Home Trip.

 The Sarsfeld Guard arrived home yester- day morning on the ""owl'' at 3:35 o'clock. They are unanimous in praise of their recep- ton and entertainment in Portland They received an ovation throughout. Tuesdays proceedings were as follows: At 1o:3O a. m. hacks were taken and the steamer Emita boarded. Casco Bay was thoroughly ex. plored and the forts and sights of the beauti- ful bay were pointed out. Speeches were made of comic nature and were rapturously received by the appreciative listeners. After another famous Falmouth House dinner, preparations were begun for the departure. From both visiting and receiving companies regrets were expressed that the visit could not be of longer duration. A slight rain began to fall as the line was being formed At the depot repeated cheers were given the Montgomerys by the SarsfeIds and were most heartily returned. On the return trip to Boston praises of the Montgomery Guards reception were sounded on every side At 7:3O D. Boston was reached and the com- pany met by the Montgomery Guards of Bos- ton. Before taking up the march to their armory a serenade was rendered Ex-Council- man John H. Walsh, Bostons ardent admirer and benefactor of the Sarsfeld Guard.

 The march then began to the Montgomerys' armory, corner of Essex and Chauncey streets. There collation. was served, after which the Sarsfelds were shown around the city. At 10:30 p. m. CATS were taken for New Haven, at the Boston and Albany de- pot. The tired but happy Sarsfelds arrived in this oity at 8. m. yesterday morning. Words fail to express the appreciation of the As Captain Keefe says, 'It was simply great"" Next autumn it is hoped that visit will be paid New Haven as the guests of the Sars6elds by the Montgomerys.

 Concerning Mondays proceedings we clip the following extracts from the very full and complete account given by the Portland Morning Press:

 The Montgomery Guards received the Sarsfeld Guard of New Haven yesterday, and with their many friends in this city ten dered them royal Irish welcome, 8 striking parade and brilliant ball in City Hall for the affair cloudless skies, bright sun and the warmth of early summer all striving to make the occasion a red-letter day in the memory of both con- mands. Flags and bunting were spread to the breeze on every hand, public buildings were decorated, and the fronts of the Fal- mouth Hotel tine headquarters of the com pany, the Montgomery Guards armory and the City Hall were especially noticeable. At the City Hall 8 large shield on the center of the front balcony bore the date 'May 18th, 1884,'' fianked on the one side by the word ''Montgomerys,"" and on the other side by the legend ''Sarsfelds."" A number of clubs, noticeably the Peters, Grattans and East Ends, kept open house and dispensed most lavish hospitality during the day and even ing.

 The SarsfieId Guard are named for Patrick Sarsfeld, Earl of Lucan, who was a brave soldier of the stirring times of 1645-93. Will liam III was forced by him to raise the siege of Limerick in 1890, and he was killed at the battle of Landen in 1893.

 The Sarsfields were in heavy marching or~ der, with great coats on, rolled red blapkets on knapsacks and wore their regulation hell nets, like those of the Maine militia, while their gray fatigue caps were slung at their belts. Their uniform is very similar to that of the Cadets. The American band of New Haven, George B. Streit leader, of 21 pie os accompanied them, and made striking ap- pearance in their white coats. On the occa- sion of the trip the company numbered fl muskets. Daring to the grand parade crowds of spectators thronged the streets, squares and corners, and the battalion and the Connecticut company made an imposing appearance, the latter being hailed from all sides by applause. The Guard in the after noon paraded in light marching order and with their white cross belts and fountain plumes over the cadet grey made the com pany pleasingly conspicuous. After the parade capital supper was informally en- joyed by the guests at the Falmouth.

 At an early hour in the evening the hall was filled and at 8 o'clock Chandler's band came upon the stage and most charmingly played several selections which were well re- ceived. The American band next came on and pleasingly rendered an overture and selection interspersed with an admirable cornet solo by MT. J. A. Gould.

 Meanwhile Mayor King, accompanied by Mayor Lewis of New Haven and followed by the reception committee, the distinguish ed military and civic guests both from Con- necticut and Maine, entered the hall and oc- cupied seats expressly reserved for them. |

 After the concerts, the Montgomerys and Sarsfelds marched in upon the floor amid l tumultuous applause, rnd were reviewed by Col. Lynch and staff. Next followed the company movements, manual of arms and bayonet exercise, by squad of 24 men from the Montgomery Guard, to whom much l praise is due. Among the we'll executed company movements, the left and right l fronts into line, the obliques and the left | wheel were loudly applauded. In the manu- | al of arms, the frings by ranks, both kneel- ing and lying down, were handsomely intro duced, while the bayonet exercises from front open file were skillfulIy done.

 When Capt. Keefe marched in the picked l squad of 24 men from the Sarsfeld Guard l the hall rang with applause. The rear open l order was finely executed, also the wheel, the | different manouvres by fours and their | double time. Their manual of arms was so | easily and precisely executed that it was re- ceived with much applause. The squad was | well-sized, we'll set up and has thorough | conception of the tactics.

 After the exhibitions an order of twelve | dances gracefully concluded the programme |

 Among the distinguished military officers | present at the ball were Adjutant General | George IL. Beal, Brigadier General John | Marshall Brown, Col. J. ]. Lynch. Major R. | T. Mcclellan, Major Fl. M. Sprague, Quarter master Sterling Dow

 Late in the evening pleasant social gath ering was held in the Falmouth Hotel par lors, at which 8 specially interesting address for Irish Americans was delivered by New Ravens ex-City Clerk, James l. Hayes. MT. Hayes remarks were very compli- mentary to the Montgomery Guards and other Portland companies ref erence being made to the exceed lngly hospitable manner in which the visit- ing company a-d invited guests had been entertained. Mayor Henry G. Lewis, of New Haven, also made one of his especially graceful speeches.

 City Solicitor Looney delivered brief address of welcome, cordially worded, to which City Clerk James P. Pigott, of New Haven, responded in 8 particularly witty speech, and which was enthusiastically re- ,eived.

 Among other gentlemen who spoke were Dol. J. J. Lynch, Col. A. W. Bradbury, AL Herman Gallagher. Capt. Hartnett and Capt. keefe, while other gentlemen enlivened the occasion with songs

 MAYOR LEWIS OK THE TRIP.

 Mayor Lewis speaks very highly of his rip to Portland with the Sarsields. He aid last night that the highest honors were bestowed upon the New Haven company ,and he officials of Portland and it's citizens, without regard to race, politics or religion, lid all in their power to make the visit l , pleasant and agreeable one.

The most inyeterate enemies of the Republi-
can party are in the South. Whatever is said.
therefore, of the Republican ticket by the DEM
ocratic organs of that section is more than
ordinarily noteworthy. and may supply Us with
some indications of the character of the forth
coming campaign that will be more reliable
than any utterances of Northern Democratic
papers. Except in the case of few of the
most radical Bourbon organs of the South there
is an uudisguised admiration of Mr.. Blaine'>
qualities. and in more than one instance the
opinion is expressed by influential papers that
if they are to be beaten by the Republicans they
would rather be beaten by Blaine than by any
other Republican leader.


A few selections from the prominent papers
of that section will give our readers a general
idea of the situation The two strongest Dem
ocratic papers in Georgia are the Augusta
Chronicle and Constitutionalist and the Atlanta
Constitution. The former says:


If the Democrats. reunited and presenting
uneXceptionable candidates. can not beat Mr.
Blaine. they could not defeat any one Of the
conspicuous Republican leaders. Let Us hope
that the common enemy has made mistake,
and that due advantage OF it will be taken at
the next Chicago Convention Mistake or not.
we will have trouble enough to elect our men
over those Just named ut Chicago. and that fact
may as well be stated and relied upon at once.
The campaign will be red-hot. and if we are to
win none but a tirSt-claSS statesman of incor-
ruptbe record must be the Democratic stand
ard-bearer With Western men. for twenty
| odd years. the Republicans have trumphed.


The Atlanta paper has still more striking
utterance. and one which. read between the
lines. makes no concealment of the admiration
which it feels for Mr.. Blaine. 1t says:
The nomination of Mr.. Blaine is the best it
could have made, and i, will require all that the
| Democrats can do to bring about his defeat.
Recognizing the nature and extent of his popu-
| ar1ty within the limitations which we have
rec is
| room in the campaign for any Democratic
| bunderS. and no place in the programme to
accommodate the capering and vaporing pro
clivitieS of certain Democratic cranks who as
sumo to lead the party. and who have led it
time and again from the emergencies of hope
to the certainty of defeat.


| Should he be elected we believe his Admins
| traton will be liberal one. He is the abe>t
| and most experienced public man to be found
| in the Republican party. and If the country i
to have another four wears Of RepubIicanSm.
| we believe Mr.. Blame will give more general
satisfaction than any other Republican, lie will
at least fly the American flag over the White
| House and the State-lIouse. and there will be
| some consolation in that.


| The Houston Post. one of the ablest Demo-
| cratic papers in Texas. expresses itself in
| hardly less striking and significant manner.
and rings the alarm bell to warn the Democra-
| cy in the following vigorous fashion:


The Democratic party must be aware that by
| nominating Blaine the Republicans have cN-
| hibited the finest trump card in their deck. Ii


Is OF no use to disguise the fact; Blaine Is very
strong man, difficult to beat. He has the mag
netlSm OF the few select. who stand head and
| shoulders above their felIoW-men his private
| record Is pure one-to The best OF our knoWl-
| edge-and his ability has been tested hundred
| times and has not been found wanting. The
| Democracy should not underratc their enemy.


No use to make fun of Blane's book. That
| book will turn out to be the most efficient
| document RpnUDltHn
ayers will send hundreds of thousands of cop


les of that book through the South and other
| Democratic Stronghold>. and seek to convert


Democrats by the charm and the eioquente Of
| Balne's ""TWenty Years in Congress. We


have read that book. It i written in the style
of an approved master. and it will catch the I'M


wary by it fine phrases and lis show Of impair
| tIalitv. Blame Is the man of all men who Will
| give the Democrats Il hard battle for the Pre>i-
dency.


There Is very little disposition in the South TO


a>>ai Mr.. Blaine or Mr.. Logan with the bitter


ness il has manifested towards previous Prc>i-
| dental candidates, and there is no disposition


10 underraic his strength leader, and in


more than one quarter there is evidence to show
| that his election would not pc regarded aS a


calamity. The Republicans Of the South are


also wonderfully encouraged by the noulna-


tions. The Crusader, Il pnclly little paper

Dlrector-General Burke, when the applause which had greeted him and the repeated cheers of the people had subsided, made a short, eloquent speech surrencering the expedition into the hands of its management After the Mexican baud had rendered some selections, concluding with their national air, the audience stand ing meantime, President Richard SOD, oi the Exposition Association. de- liyered his address, which WAS wired to Washington. He then read President Arthur's address, which had just been received ty telegraph.

 Governor McEnery delivered an ad- dress ID which he reviewed the history ol the organization Cf the exposition and SC. forth the great advantages to accrue tO the State and people of the wh ie country from the grand enter prise Alter this speech poem in honor of the exposition, by Mrs. Townsend, was read by Page NJ.

Tonight the city Is brilliantly illuminated. The most notable buildings are those of the Times Democrat, which has erected triumphal arch in the street, and Plea yuue, which has a superb multitude of colored rows of lights and lanterns GOV ering the entire front. The sky is gorge ous with fireworks and the air resOunds with the explosions Of gunpowder. The general expression is that the day has been a complete success ard a credit to ihe management. Possibly 2J,OO per sons found their way to the exposition grounds. The only cause of regret Is that the delay of some exhibitors pre- vented the first day from presenting the displays at their best. The complete array of exhibits preseIted by the States of Oregon, Colorado, California and Nebraska and the Territory of Dakota exhibit attracted universal attention, being magnificent.

Detailed Proceedings Of the National


Republican Convention.

A HoTLY CONTESTED CONFLICT",,"National Convention, the eighth in the history
of the party, convened at noon to-day. The
spectacle presented at the opening was no
table one in many ways, and its description
would be worthy of high flight Of the imagin-
alton. The working body of the convention,
the greatest, in point Of numbers of any Ma
tional political assemblage, occupied only a
small portion of the vast auditorium. The
hall is the largest, and has been termed the
most complete ever thrown open for the work
of vast deliberate body. 1t is in one sense
temporary, having been constructed within
the walls of the exposision building. Its seat
ing capacity approximates $4,000.


At l2 2:24 the chair announced that the hour
having arrived Tor the meeting Of the eighth
Republican National convention, the convcn-
tion would now be opened by prayer by the
Rev. Frank Bristol, Of Chicago. Prayer was
then offered by Mr.. Bristol.


After calling the convention to order, the
chair directed the Secretary of the Central
Committee, Hon. John A. Martin, to read the
call for the convention, which was done.


Chairman Sabin then made brief address,
He closed with an expression of hope for vic
tory, and proposed for Temporary chairman
Hon. Powell Clayton, of Arkansas.


When the chairman had concluded and men
toned the name of Powell Clayton, Mr.. H. S.
Lodge, of Massachusetts,, rose and proposed
the name OF John r. Lynch, Of Mississippi.
He said they recognized the claim of the
south, and therefore he had proposed this
second name as one acceptable to the Republi-
can Convention.

nomination Of Lynch.

 What Fl. c. Rowe is Doing.

 The oyster growers in this section of the country are very much alarmed about the starflsh, as those deadly foes to the bivalves have appeared in larger quantities this year than for several years. As a consequence of this fear the oystermen are planting much less than usual. They are exerting all their efforts towards exterminating the pests. H. c. Rowe says he has caught fully 2,OoO bushels of the starfsh in the last six months. He alone has lost in that time some 90, 1000 bushels of oysters Yesterday he was out in the "". Fl. Lockwood, his smallest steamer, and caught 166 bushels of starfish eff South west Ledge, near the lighthouse. The fish are buried in the earth when captured. They can be utilized as fertilizer.

 Daniel J. Crowley and Miss Annie Smith were married Monday afternoon at the Church of the Sacred Heart by Rev. Father Crowley, assisted by Rev. Father Lynch. William Flaherty was the best man, and Miss Fannie Smith, sister of the bride. was the bridesmaid."

An or Day for the Home Team =


A few Critical Errors Loso the
l9nmD.",,"Came.
About 100 persons v,s,tsd the bas.
ball grounds yesterday and witnessed
the first defeat Of the home team, which
was caused by loose fielding. The con
test, however, was exciting, and 1t was
the opinion OF many that the visitors
were pitted against the +"" toughest
team they have met thus far this sea-
aon. The visitors played very poor
game and all through the nine innings II
was "" amy ybody's game""


Foutz pitched for the visitors, and %
he was looked upon as q crack man In
the holes, the homo team soon ""got on y
to his delivery and hit him freely. He
IL q fine pitcher though, and was ably
supported by Straub behind the bat,
who took that position at the beginning
of the third inning, Goodman at first
being permitted to retire after having
one Of his fingers split.


Dan Casey, the boy pitcher, was
placed in the holes by the home team
and proved himself fully competent to
face the strongest teams in the country,
as the visitors made but five hits off his
delivery. During the progress OF the
game, however, he showed signs OF
nervousness and anxiety, which caused
him to make several bad plays. II lie
can overcome this feeling he will be q
terror to all opponents.
He struck out ten men, and was we'll
supported by Cusick, who also became
little unnerved in one inning, and
made one OF two wild throws, which
proved disastrous. ""Old reliable"" Sny-
der surprised tie audience with two
costly errors, while Bastian, who did
not drop fly bail last season, let one
go through his hand, much to the cha
grin Of al. Nolan, at right field, miss
ed nice ball and otherwise played q
poor game.


The four errors mentiO ned above were
all very costly and gave the visitors the
lea and the winning run. From the
manner In which the visitors played
the audience were confident of success
for the home team and were much dis
appointed when the result was reach ed.
The weather, however, may have had
considerable to do with the bad play
ing on both sides, as q disagreeable
cold wind prevailed at the time, and
made everybody anything but comfort
able. ""Fog Horn"" Bradley umpired
the game in satisfactory manner, al
though one or two close decisions elict.

that the hours for business be from 8

TEMPERANCE AND TOBACCO.


Among the committees appointed
were one on Temperance and one on
Tobacco. Some strong blows indi-
cative Of something still stronger to
follow were given in these prelimina-
ry steps against tobacco, snuff and
intoxicating drings.


Elder Mckinney of Scottsboro, ex-
pressed the opinion that a special
committee on ""wax"" seemed to be
necessary if the practice of wax chew
lag was as prevalent elsewhere as it
was in his vicinity.


DR.. Lakin launched the Tobacco
committee on its labors with the ex-
coriation of Bishop Harris singing in

Since the accident five out of the nineteen who were at the hospital died and it is thought that half the remainder will not live. Death in few cases where the body WAS not at all injured resulted frem the in- haling of steam from the boiler by several victims who were fastened in the wreck while the escaping steam hissed in their faces The theory is that the conductor of the freight wanted to make good time and get to bed early and so tried to get in before the t'dum- n.y."" which he is said to have done before Many of the workmen killed were excellent artisans and some were brought from the United States when the bolt works were opened.

A TRUE STORY OF THE GREAT REGULATOR",,"JUDGE LYNCH.

 TRUE STORY OF THE GREAT REGULATOR

 A correspondent of the Chicago Inter Ocean, writing from Lynchburg, Va. says

 While chatting with an old antiquarian in his cool library, I casually inquired how this town came by it's peculiarly suggestive name. ""Did the original judge of dread full fame ever live here p asked.

 ""Yes, he did,"" replied the old gentle man with brightehing eyes that revealed delightin the topic. ""Judge Lynch might fairly be called the founder of the city, and it makes me angry to see all these news. paper stories, not only locating him in oth. CT states, but condemning his mode o1 procedure as infamous and brutal""

 ""Then you believe in the summary method of dealing with sinful men ?""

 ""Not 80 fast, young man not so fast, J said the fine old Virginian, smiling. q will tell you the story just as I had it from my grandfather, who was proud of his ac quaintance with that shrewd ferrymaD who wiped the crime of horse-stealing, fo1 which the state was growing famous, right out. Why, Virginians were notorious for their love of other mems cattle, and even taught the trade of acquiring them to the Cherokees and Chickasaws, much to the disgust and shame of the better class ot citizens""

 ""When was this ?"" queried your cores pondent.

 ""Not long before the Revolutionary war, and at that time there were quite a num- Der of that splendid race, the Scotch Irish, settled here. Shrewd and brave, cautious yet daring, dashing but prudent, honest and energetic, every man of them proved a great blessing to the settlement, and not few became famous, such as General An drew Jackson, James K. Polk, John Cal houn, Sam Houston, David Crockett, Rob- ert Fulton, Patrick Bronte, and, later, Robert Bonner, A. T. Stewart and Horace Greeley. These names come most read. fly to mind, but there is still another gen. eratiOn of them, including President Ar. thur and our coming president, James G. Blaine""

 ""And the Lynches ?"" ventured.

 ""Were from the same stalwart stock, and settled in Prince William county. There were four boys in the family, and one of them, John Lynch, was bright, quick young fellow and remarkably coura. geous. One day in rambling about the head of the James river he found gap in the mountains on either side of the water, which it struck him would make 8 capital crossing point for travellers, and forthwith he drove his proprietary stake, and short. ly after, with few logs and an old scow, established a primitive ferry. The horse thieves were among the first to take ad. vantage of the new convenience, and young Lynch, himself scrupulously hon. est, was disgusted and humiliated at hay. ing to take them across. At this time the country was sparsely settled, courts were few, and jails far apart. The evil contin. ued to increase finally the ferry became the favorite means of escape for stealers, and John Lynch, thoroughly aroused, pro- posed to put an end to it.""

 ""What could he do single-handed? ?""

 s'Well, l will tell you what he actually did.

 He applied to the governor of Virginia for commission to act as justice of the peace. His reputation for honesty and good judgment was beyond doubt, and his commission was granted. He was qualified and became judge. The first use he made of his power was to appoint some special constables and engage few sharp detectives. They at once began work with such success that gang after gang were captured""

 ""Did they have no trial ?""

 ""Yes. They were brought before Judge Lynch, and he never acted until he was positive of their guilt, and his knowledge of them and the country was an immense advantage to him. If he found them guilty he would, according to the law, re- quire a good bond, which, of course in those days g thief could never get, and when that form was compiled with, would start them of well guarded to some far away jail. The oonstables knew what the order to march meant, and as soon as they found themselves in thick wood, chose g stout tree, and with good rope which they carried, created temporary scaffold from which the horse-thieves quickly dangled. Hanging was the legal punish ment for horse stealing in those days. but the promptness and despatch with which Judge Lynch meted out justice at thei, very door terrorized the evil-doors of the country, and between these he hung and those Whp lied, in two years there was moi a horse-thief in Virginia""

 ""And what became of Judge Lynch ?""

 ""He continued to live near the ferry round which large village grew up un der the name of Lynch's Ferry, and moi until long after his death did it become Lynchburg. During his life lynch law was honorea and upheld, but since then ii has altogether lost it's original character and meaning, Now, aa I understand it. i1 IS merely the infuriated impulse of rough mob, who, without waiting for the law al hand to prove innocence or guilt, decide on 1t according to their own inclination and take life perhaps more unblemished than their own. Mo-"" concluded the old gentleman, ""John Lynch did his state services in ridding it of lot of miscreants' whom, but for him, Were out of the reach of the law, hut were he living, TT no one would be quicker than he to resent this"

A terrible tragedy was committed al
Petersburg, Grant County, Friday night
the particulars Of which have just beer
received here, and another lynching may
follow, which viii be the fourth i'll this
State within ten days. Lawrence Spliler
farmer living back of Petersburg, had .
handsome step-daughter to whom he
played the part Of cruel parent
keeping her mewed up when
ever practicable. The county
was full of rumors concerning
their relations to each other, aud it be-
came matter of surprise when Edward
Taylor, who worked for Spiller, demand
ed her hand in marriage. Spiller refused
point blank and warned Taylor he would
kill him if he found him again on the
premises. On Friday night the girl dis
appeared, having eloped with Taylor and
gone to Petersburg.


Spiller armed himself and fol
lowed, vowing death to the man
if caught. At Petersburg he
learned that they were married and were
lodging with man named Williams.
Spiller went to Williams house and
was told the newly married couple had
retired and were asleep. Forcing his
way to the room, he entered, awaking
Taylor with the noise The bridegroom
sat up in bed as Spiller entered, and
Spiller leyelled a revolver at him. The
bride begged piteously for his life, but
Spiller fired, the bullet entering his heart
and killing him instantly. Spiller then at
tackled the wife, hammering her over the
head with the revolver, and bitterly de-
nouncing her for deserting him. Leaving
her for dead he rushed from the house,
mounted his horse and fed. Williams
gave the alarm, and an armed posse start
in pursuit. Spiller returned home, where
he was arrested and taken back to Jail.


The news comes by messenger, and
when the man left the town the indIgna-
ton and excitement were intense. Mrs.
Taylor was then in a dying condition, and
the courier feared mob law in the event
of her death.


SHOT AND DRAINED WITH STONES.


CHARLESTON, W. VA, May H.


Tho ,,A~.-,--
cinity are excited over the accounts
of the numerous desperate deeds
that have lately been committed.
Within ten days five murders
have been enacted and three lynch
ings, and while all of the crimes have
been committed by the ""James gang""
and though three of its members have
been lynched and one shot dead while re-
sisting arrest, the lawless deeds of the
band are still carried on and hor-
rible tragedies are becoming every
day occurrences. The latest has
Just come in from Roane,
an adjoining county, and will ever re-
main mystery. Thomas Duskin, a
well-known farmer, has figured promi-
nently before the Federal Court as wit
ness in various cases, and has incurred
the hatred of the gang, which caused
several threatening letters to be sent to
him. He gave them no heed, and went
to work as usual. With man named
Elmore he was planting corn, when a
shot was heard, and he threw up his
hands and exclaimed, ""I'm killed.""
Elmore could see no person, and
taking hold of Duskin started
for the house, mile distant On the way
Duskin became weak from loss of blood,
and resting on the fence sent Elmore on
for help. Elmore had not gone five hun
dred yards before five masked men
emerged from the woods and attacked
Duskin, killing him by pounding his head
to Jelly with stones. So far as could be
learned nothing is known Of the murder
ers and no steps are being taken for their
apprehension."

is that there is no region in the world

worth the price Of twenty feet OF inch rope.
There is very little judicial law in Montana,

which, perhaps, is quite rs good. 1t is
stated that fifty stock thieves have been
lynched in the Territory in the last six

 DENVER, Jan. 2O.-Some three months ago Mary Rose Matthews, bright, winsome lit- tie girl ten years old, was adopted from the Denver Catholic Orphans Home by Mike Cuddihie and wife, living on ranche ten miles from Ouray, mining town in the southern part of the State. Last Saturday morning little Rose suddenly died, and was buried by Cuddihie in distant part of his rancho. The little girl had been cruelty treated from the first, the neighbors said, and her mysterious death and hurried burial aroused their suspicious. The coroner at Ouray was notified. He immediately repaired to the ranche, found the grave and exhumed the body. when unmistakable evidences of her cruel death were revealed. The body was covered with knife wounds, one leg was broken, the skull crushed and limbs frozen She had no doubt been driven out into the winter to die. Cuddihie and wife were i'm mediately arrested and placed in jail. Friday they were tried and both found guilty of murder. About one o'clock yesterday morn ing band of masked men went to the hotel where Cuddihie and wife were temporarily held in custody, overpowered the sheriff s guard and took the prisoners away. They both cried loudly for mercy, but as they had ever been deaf to the pIeadings for mercy, so the vigilantes closed their ears to the cries of the prisoners. They were taken outside of the town limits, where the woman was hung to the ridge pole of vacant cabin, while her husband was strung up to the limb of tree on the opposite side of the road. Then the work being done the yfgilantss quickly re- tired. The bodies were cut down and buried by the coroner yesterday. John Carroll, Cuddihies brother-in-law, was arrested with the others, but for want of sufficient evidence was allowed to go. This is the first instance when 8 woman has been 1ynched in Colorado"

One of the most cold-blooded murders
that ever was known in this part OF the
country took place at Randville, one mile
..""rti, Of this place, last night, Peter Cht-
stantly killed. He had just retired for the
night when he was called by two persons
to come to the door quickly, and as he
opened it one of them shot him. 1t seems
that the trouble ending in the murder sup
posedly arose out of Clifford's brother mar
rying step-daughter of man named
Hickey short time ago, which marriage
Clifford had strongly opposed, and since
that time they have annoyed Clifford IN
every possible way. Five of the Hickey
family, including men and women, were
put under arrest and strong guard placed
around them to keep the citizens from TAX
ing the law in their own hands. This pre-
caution was not entirely successful, for at
$3.50 O'Clock this evening crowd OF $40, or
which about fifty were masked, surrounded
the house which contained the prisoners.
They took Hickey and his brothcr-in-law to
a grove near by. They first hung Hickey
and We're then stringing up his brother-In-
law when the rope broke, letting him fall.
His pitifu pleadngs for mercy and earnest
protesta ions of innocence finally caused
the mob to reprieve him. Hickey would
not say whether he was guilty or innocent,
buJ said he would die like man. The
Hickey family and associates are of the
most degraded set in Southern Ohio, and
by getting rid of them. The town is wild
with excitement."

 THE PUBLIC LANDS. The strength of the Republican party is increased by the multiplication of landhOlders. Our laws should look to the IudlciOus encouragement of actual settlers on the public domain. While 1t should hencefOrth be held as sacred [ trust for the benefit of those seeking homes, the tendency to consolidate large tracts of land in the ownership of indi- viduals or corporations should with proper regard to vested rights be dis eOuraged.

 OUR SHIPPING INTERESTS. Among our national interests one lan- guishes-the foreign carrying trade. It was seriously crippled in cur civil war, and another blow was gwen to it in the general substitution of steam for sail in ocean traffic. A law just enacted re- moves some of the burdens upon our navigation and inspires the hope that this great interest may at last receive it's due share of attention. All efforts In this direction should receive encourage l ment.

 sACREDNESs OF THE BALLOT. A survey of our condition as a nation reminds us that material prosperity IS but a mOckery fl it does not tend tO pre- serve the liberty of the people. A free ballot Is the safeguard of republican in- stitutiODs, withrut which no national welfare Is assured. He who cOrrupts | suffrage strikes at the very root of free government.

The Convention Opened
At 2.24 P. NJ. The band played America at
a signal from the platform, and at the con-
clusion Senator Dwight M. Sabin, chairman
of the National Committee, called the con-
vention TO order


Rev. Mr.. Bristol, of Chicago, opened the
convention with prayer.


After Secretary Martin had read the call
for the convention, amid occasional cries of
Louder"" Mr.. Sabin made brief address
of welcome His illusions to Lincoln, Grant
and Garfield called forth shouts of wild en-
thusiasm. the name of Garfield awakening
the loudest cheers. Applause also greeted
the Senator'S civil service reform utterance
and his allusion to the self-evident fact that
the convention represents in an eminent
degree the people rather than the politicians.


Mr. Lodge was on his feet as soon as Sabin
named Clayton as the chairman. He said
that the intention Of himself and associates
was not


To Force a Test Vote
regarding any one, but to secure the election
to office as a representative of the republicans
of the south of gentleman who would be
representative of the whole people.


Drummond, of Maine, said that this was a
pretty late moment to


Bring Forth this Principle,
and the name of the distinguished Mississip-
plan was not brought to the attention of the
committee


He moved the substitution of the roll of
States instead of the roll of delegates.


The chairman said that there being no
rules before the house, he would, according
to the rules of the House of Representatives,
declare the motion out of order, and that the
roll of delegates be called.


The Vote Resulted


Lynch, 432


Clayton, 3S7


Clayton moved to make Lynch's nOmina-
tion unanimous. Carried.


Clayton escorted Lynch to the chair amid
wild cheering:


The nomination of Lynch brought out
much debate, among those taking part being
Morrow of California, Stewart of Pennsyl-
vania, George VIM. Curtis and Theodore
Roosevelt of New York, Morrow and Stew
art opposing the nomination on the ground
that the national committee had named the
temporary chairman for forty years and it
was dangerous to make an innovation.


The others contended that the convention
had right to choose its own officers if it
desired.


When after the roll of delegates had been
called and it was found that Lynch had been
elected q scene of great excitement followed,
the delegates rose cheering, shouting and
waving their hats, with the spectators joining.
The chairman then said he had the honor Of
presenting Is temporary chairman


Hon. Jehn r.. Lynch Of NlississiPpi.


The chair said: ""Gentlemen of the con-
vention feel ought not tosay thank you
for the honor you conferred on me, for do
not. Nevertheless from the standpoint that no
patriot should fail to respond to the country's
call, and that no member of the party
should fail to comply with the demand of the
party and yield with reluctance. l am pre-
pared, and l hope that every member of the
convention is prepared. to return home with
an unmistakable determination to give to the
candidates of this convention the loyal and
hearty support, whoever they may be.
[Cheers. l am satisfied in my mind that
when we 90 before the people of the country
that our action will be ratified because of the
great heart of the people. Never consent to

country are two loyal to allow a man to be

At the conclusion of Lynchs remarks it
was suggested by Hon. John Martin and
adopted that T. Shead of New York and J.
W. Lee of Pennsylvania be chosen assistant
secretaries to serve during the tendency of
the temporary organization. The chairman
of delegations announced the names of per-
sons selected to serve on.the various commit
tees of the convention. Henry l.. Pierce of
Massachusetts, presented


The Following Resolution:


Resolved, That the subject of the revised

tive from Arkansas and without knowing
that the action involved any political mean
ing whatever, otherwise the contest that en-
sued would have been avoided in the selec-
tion of some other member. Those respon-
sible for bringing Clayton forward had not
calculated on the convention overruling the
action of the committee as their precedents
were all for approving such nominations. The
Independents Decided to Make the Issue
on his selection, and formed a combination
with the Arthur men for the purpose. The
votes were cast largely on this issue, but not
all Of them, as some Arthur men voted for
Clayton in order to sustain the committee,
and some Blaine men voted for Lynch, as he
is claimed to be for Blaine. Edmunds men,
however, are very jubilant, and claim that
the field against Blaine is strong enough to
defeat him. On the other hand, the Blaine
men say that there are Arthur men who will
go to Blaine if they see no chance for their
favorite, and that the vote has shown them
to be


Stronger than Has Been Conceded.

Session Occupied by Routine Work.


The proceedings of the day while charac-
terized by great earnestpess and keen watch
fullness to detect any evidences that the tide
was turning any way was not prolific in dra-
matte incidents for the reason that large
share of the session was occupied by the
routine calling of the roll and the election of
a temporary chairman.

This point of the proceedings was only re-
lieved from monotony by the glimpses of per-
sonal characteristics and the phases of feeling
exhibited by members as they rose one at

the name of Powell Clayton as the choice of
the national committee for temporary chair.

Lodge of Massachusetts, rose and moved to
substitute the name of John II. Lynch, one
of the colored delegates from Mississippi.
Though some such action was not unantici-
pated, it caused q sensation.


The conference in which Lynch was de-
cided on was held this forenoon. The first
general denomination was made when in the
call of the roll Gen. Malone was called. A
general cheer arose from the main end and
gallery. interrupting the call for brief time.
Theodore Roosevelt. of New York,
also received marked evidence of attention
when he rose to speak.

Committee ON Resolutions

Pacific at 8 this evening and selected VIM.

committee consisting of Henry Cabot Lodge
of Massachusetts, j. II. Baker of Indiana,
George r. Peck of Kansas, w. Elan of Vir-
ginia, M. Bynum of Mississippi, Judge
Ebert of Colorado and Horace Davis of Cal
ifornia, was appointed, who with the chair
man and secretary, will prepare the plat
form and report to the full committee at 9
A. M, tomorrow.


After the appointment Of the subcommittee
Alexander Sullivrn appeared before the com
mittee on behalf of the executive committee
of the Irish National League snd delivered a
long and interesting address on the subject
of ownership of American land by foreigners,


In an address which Mr.. Sullivan read,
after showing that it was the intention of the
founders of the government that the principle
that American citizens shall be indispensable
to the ownership of lands in the United
States and that it is distinctly so indicated in
explicit terms on which the thirteen States
surrendered the lands to the national govern
ment for the use and benefit of the entire
people. 1t goes on to say that the intention
of the founders OF the republic have been
thwarted by events which they could not
foresee. In 1856 and 1860 the national dem
ocratic convention approved of the resolution
recommending the national government TO
aid in the construction of the Pacific rail-
road. The national republican conven-
vention followed the example and the result
is a quantity of the public domain nearly
equal to the area of the - original States
has been presented to monopolies by which
it has been disposed of in a manner hostile TO
the spirit and terms on which those States
surrendered the land to the government


We have seen the effect of the system Of
great estates, which is now stealing all over
our western domain, where foreign land
proprietors had permitted 81 ZOO, 600 of the
inhabitants to perish of famine.


The committee also received and heard
statements from delegation of the Knights
of Labor and other kindred organizations.
They professed TO represent 200, 900 work
men. They asked the enforcement of the
eight hour Law, the enforcement of compul-
sorry education and the prevention of import
alton of contract labor.

 At Justice Metcalfs residence in West Ha- ven yesterday morning trial was held of nine hotel and restaurant keepers in the town of Orange who had been arrested the day be- fore on search warrants by ex-Depury Sheriff Peck and Deputy Sheriff Joe Warren. The no-lfcense law which the town of Orange voted last fall has made it unpleasant for the keepers of hotels and restaurants, and they have been sharply watched by the authori- ties. Raids have been made recently and in some cases small quantities of liquors have been found. The parties who were ar- rested and summoned to appear before Jus tice Metealf at the bench temporarily ar ranged in his sitting room, where the law was to be administered to the offenders or the reputed offenders against the no-hcense de- cree of the moral citizens of Orange, appeared about 10 o'clock. They appeared without 1 counsel, and all but two of them plead guil- ty. preferring to settle the costs rath- | ing their cases Those. who were l arrested were: John Cox, of the Surf | House; Frank Lucas, of the Hinman House: | Albert Lynch. of Railroad Grove House; | Frederick Perrin, of Waverly Grove; Leon- ard Sohn, of Wabash Grove; Mary Lynch or Benedict as the name appears in the war; rant, of Oak street. Frank Schleigel, of the Jumbo House. Alfred Hills, of the Home stead, and Frank Judge, of the Savin Rock House. All the parties were pres ent. The first name called was John Cox. He pleaded guilty and was fined in all $15.S5. Frank Lucas then walk. ed up and paid the same amount. Albert 1 Lynch settled for $16 85 and Frederick Per l rim and Leonard Sohn for the same amounts. They all preferred to plead guilty l and settle the cases wi bout trial. Hen l Robbins, a wen-known sporting man, settled for Mary Benedict, or Lynch. Frank Schleigel at first pleaded not guilty, but after holding a whispered conversation with ex Deputy Sheriff Peck he concluded he would change his plea to guilty

 1 Lawyer Charles R. Whedon appeared fol two clients, Alfred Hills of the Homestead and Frank Judge of the Savin Rock House Prosecuting Agent Futile was not ready to try their cases, however, and asked for a con tinuance until Monday next. He presented as his reason that it was an invariable ,pre cedent for cases to go over for trial. MT. ! Wh6QOn argued against nlm, 8peaE1nS GR0E for MT. Hills: ''It is an outrage for the State to arrest this man and summon him here and not be ready for trial. If there be witnesses why were they not summoned! The prosecuting agent expected these men to come up here and settle, so he isn't pre-. pared for trial. He expected to take in his little fee of ten dollars and have enough tc go to Saratoga or somewhere else to spend the summer. I see your honor looking at 6 calendar, so I suppose you are going to con tinue the case, so will enter demurrer and dispose of the case at once""

 ! The demurrer was entered. After hearing MT. Tuttle's explanations of the legal state in which the case found itself by the new turn it had taken Justice Metcalf said: Well 1 I suppose it amounts to this: Whether He was assured that such was not the case ""Well then guess will sustain the de murrer.""

 ""Then the case is out of court"" promptly interposed Mir. Whedon.

 MT. Tuttle asked the justice if he really meant it. MT. Futile explained further the result of the ruling and the justice finally changed it. overruling the demurrer. He then imposed fine of $1 and $l5 95 costs. Mir. Whedon took an appeal. The bond was fixed at $75 and furnished

About IL O'Clock court opened with
Chief Juatice Comegys and Judge Hous-
ton on the bench.


The members Of the grand jury were
called and Charles g. Ash OF Delaware
City sworn in as foreman. The other
members were tEen qualified and the jury
retired. In his address to the grand jury
the chief justioe called attention to the
encroaohments made upon the public
roads In various parts OF the county by
farmers and others, and suggested that
the Jury take action thereon and adopt
measures to prevent further violations of
law in this respect.


The petit jnry WAS next called, and
Licuor Bsiliff Thomas N. Ogle called
upon all who were witnesses in any
cases of violation Of the liquor laws to
come into the witness room. To the sur
prise OF many fully three-fourths Of the

him to the witness room.

his counsel, Harry Emmons, Bsq asked
for a postponement until Wednesday

until tomorrow afternoon Ouly.


Frank Flanagan, Italian, who was In
dicted at the February term of court for
urglariously entering the houses of
Albert N. King and Samuel II. Baynard,
and stealing $50 from the former house,
WAS brought into court, but before being
arraigned WAS returned TO the cells, and
the interpreter selected to act in the
case, Antonis Cardinelli, sent down
to CONFER with him. During the
consultation, however, Flanagan re-
fused to refer to his offense, and only
talked about an assault which he alleged
had been committed upon him while in
Jail. As he gives indications OF being
weak-minded, nearly imbeoile man, his
CASE was laid over until the September
term, when the State will enter nolle
pros. During the interim he will be
kept in prison.

the meeting was made very pleasant

and several questions were answered IN a
way that interested the audience. These
questions that are given out weekly by

profitable to the person preparing them as

therefore, that this question exercise is

When asked to take something, never
refuse. Ii you shoot a man by mistake
for some one else, it is positively re-
quired that you call on the family i'm
mediately after the funeral and apollo
gize. 1t is not polite to crack jokes at
the expense of man who carries q self
cooking pistol. Never carry handker-
chief in your pocket; reaching for it
may lead to Misunderstanding. At
lynching bees the master Of the ceremo-
nies has the exclusive right to designate
those who are to help pull on the rope.
When suddenly stopped by road agents
and asked to hold up your hands,
it is considered the height of
impoliteness to refuse. Strict
etiquette now requires that at
5 o'clock teas all weapons shall be
concealed under the coat or in the boots,
the latter course being preferred, as
bootlegs are handler to get at. When
invited to party which you do not wish
to attend, a card with regrets with C. A.

giving this rule until the churches are

Mr.. West OF Ohio, also argued against the
minority report.


Mr.. Long Of Massachusetts,, said 1t was
perfectly evident that the convention was not
prepared to adopt the views OF the minority
report but they were going to elect the next

settling equal rights At the end of the next

the matter would be referred to the next

Mr. filley Of Missouri, opposed the minority
report. He spoke Of the $4,000 Republicans
OF Missouri who united their votes with the
Greenbaokers and asked whether they were to
be abandoned or whether they should not be
encouraged as Malone had been encouraged,
who had saved Virginia to the Republican
party. [Applause.


Mr.. O'Hara OF North Carolina, declared
that the adoption of the minority report
would be a total surrender Of the political
rights Of every Republican In the south,

Mr.. Clayton OF Arkansas, also opposed the
minority report.


Mr.. Bishop Of Massachusetts, then with
drew this report amid great applause, stating
It was entirely evident that the sentiment Of

The majority report was then adopted.


Mckinley (0hic) from the committee on
resolutions then presented the report.


THE PLATFORM.


The Republicans of the United States in
convention assembled renew thoir allegiance
to the principles upon which they have
triumphed in six successive Presidential cleo.
tions and congratulate the American people
on the obtainment Of 30 many results in
legielation and administration by which tho
Republican party has, after saving the Union,
done 30 much to render its institutions Just,
equal and beneficial, the safeguard
Of liberty and the embodiment
our citizens. The Republican party has
gained its strength by quick and
faithful response to the demands of the
people for the freedom and equality OF all
men, for united nation, assuring the rights
OF all citizens, for the elevation OF labor, for
an honest currency, for purity in legislation
and for integrity aud accountability in all de-





anew the task of leading in the work Of pro-
gress and reform ; we lament the death of
President Garfield, whose sound statesman
ship, long conspicuous in Congress, gave
promise OF slrong and successful adminis-
tration, promise fully realized during the
short period Of his office as President Of the
United States. His distinguished SUCCESS in
war and in peace have endeared him to the
hearts of the American people,


In the administration OF President Arthur,
we recognize q wise, conservative and patriotic
policy, under which the country has been
blessed with remarkable prosperity, and we
believe his eminent services are entitled to and
Will receive the hearty approval of every
citizen.


THE TARIFF PLANK.


1t ID the first duty of good government
to protect the rights and promote the in
terosts of its own people. The largest di-
versity OF industry is most productive of
general prosperity and the comfort and inde-
pendenoe of tho people.


We, therefore, demand that the imposition
of duties on foreign goods shall be made not
for revenue only, but that in raising the
requisite revenues for the government such
duties shall be 30 levied as to afford security
to our diversified industries and proteo
ton to the rights aud wages of
the laborer, to the end that active and intelli-
gent labor az well as capital may have its just
award, and the laboripg man his full share in
the national prosperity Against the 80
called economical system Of the Democratic
party which would degrade our labor
10 the foreign standard, we enter our earnest
protest. The Democratic party has failed |
completely to relieve the people of the bur.
den OF unnecessary taxation by
a wise reduction Of the surplus.
rbct the inequalities OF the tariff and to re-
duce the surplus, not by the
vicious and indscriminate process
OF horizontal reduction but by
such methods as will relieve the tax payers |
without injuring the laborer or the great pro- |
ductive interests Of the country. We recognize
nf ba ns ss Of bs shosR ss hpssanrs
which it is now exercising and the danger to
its prosperity, and we therefore respect the |
demands OF the representatives of this i'm |
portant agricultural interest for II readjust-
ment of duty upon foreign wool in order that |
such industry shall have full and adequate |
protection. |


THE FINANCIAL PLANK. |
We always recommended the best money |
known to the civilized world, and we urge |
that an effort be made to unite all CONNER |
cia1 nations in the establishment of the inter |
national standard which shall fix for all the |
relative value of gold and silver coinage.
The regulation OF commerce with foreign |
nations and between the states is one OF tho |
most important prerogatives Of the general |
government, and the Republican party |
distinctly announces its purpose to support |
such legislation as will fully and effectually |
carry out tho constitutional power Of Com |
gress over inter state commerce. The prin- |
ciple of the public regulation Of railway cor |
porationH il a wise and Statutory one for |
the protection of all Glasses of |
the people, and we favor Legislation that shall |
prevent unjust discrimination and excessive |
charges for transportation and that shall 30 |
cure to the people and to the railways alike |
the fair and equal protection of the laws.


AN EIGHT HOUR LAW.
We favor the establishment OF a national |
bureau OF labor, the enforcement of the /
eight hour lava wise and judicious system of |
from the national revenues whenever the |
same is needed.
We believe that everywhere the protection |
to a citizen OF American birth mustb be secured /
to citizen OF American adoption and we
favor the settlement of national differences |
by international arbitration.
The Republican party having its birth /
in period OF slave labor and, in desire |
that all men may be FREQ. and equal, is
opposed to placing our working |
men in competition with any form Of servile
labor whether at home or abroad.
In this spirit we denounce the
importation OF contract labor, whether from |
Europe or Asia, as an offense against the |
spirit OF American institutions and we pledge |
ing Chinese immigration and TO provide such
further legislation as is necessary to carry out
its purposes.

vigor every few minutes. The chairman

CHICAGO, June 6,--One hour and half
before the time for the convention to
assemble vast crowds OF people were in
front OF the entrances waiting for the
doors to open. 1t seemed as II there
had been no change from last
night when thousands demanded ad-
mittanoe to hall already crowded. The
dOorkeeper, policemen and sergeant. at
arms exercised great patience and there
WAS little irritation.


The rumor this morning In the air Is |
that the independents, alarmed at the |
strong Blaine demonstration last night,
have determined to cast the vote OF |
Massachusetts and Vermont on the |
second ballot for Gen. William Teoumseh |
Sherman. This rumor is spreading |
rapidly aud creating lively interest.


IRlsHMBN GRATEFUL.


In response to all inquiry by a reporter |
of the Assooited Press, Mr.. Alexander
Sullivan, president OF the Irish National |
National Leagues OF America, stated that
he and his colleagues on the COM
mittee appointed to address the
committee on resolutions of
the Republican convention felt
profoundly grateful to the committee for
Its courteous, patient attention and not
only for the insertion Of the plank asked
for in the PLATFORM. but also for the good
will and manifest sincerity with which 1t
was done.


1886 a. m.-One of the doors being
opened and the crowd being in measure
repressed the hall filed up rapidly. At
this hour nearly 10000 people are in the
hall and outside the doors
in the immediate vicinity 5000
to 1900 now are standing eager for sd.
mittanoe. II was twenty minutes past
the hour for meeting when the gAvel fell
and the chairman announced the con
vention would be opened by prayer by

 Tyler street Family JRra-The Case Continued - Rules Adopted Which Restrict Policemen.

 Mayor Lewis and the full Board of Police Commissioners were entertained last evening by recital of the Wes- Waas family jars and the story possessed enough interest and material for amusement to keep the commits sioners in laughter much of the time. The parties are all German residents of Tyler street and they don't seem to have dwelt in peace and harmony together. Chickens, billy goats and women have caused difficulties. Tho force of the feud was observable in the outbursts of wrath that startled the commissioners and called into activity all the energies of Clerk Pigott, who brandished n big knife in the mir and threatened to de- molish the whole crowd unless they preserved order becoming the place and time.

 It seems that n summer day, July 25, Mrs Weis, wife of Philip Weis of 20 Tyler street. went out to milk the goat while the shades of evening were falling. She re- turned to the house with her pail of foaming lacteal fluid and was talking in the evening quietude to her devoted Weis, when Polce- man Waas entered and threw dismay into the household by seizing MT. Weis and knocking Mrs. Weis. down and spilling her milk He dragged Weis to the gate, when young man named Lynch interfered and separated them. The neighbors were there and saw the naughty policeman abuse the pensive Mir. Weis. The police commissions CTS were asked therefore to take such action as seemed right.

 The case went over until the next regular meeting of the board as Officer Waas was not ready with his testimony.

 Commissioner Sheldon presented the fol- lowing rules, which he said had been on the l table for six months. They were adopted:

 No member of the police department shall en- dorse any application for license for the sale of | spirtuous or Intoxicating liquors become surety as bondsnnn for any person obtaining such H. | cense.

ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIvE MEN

 KILLED BY AN ENPLOsIuN.

Not One of Those Rt Work in OF About the Mine Left to Tell the Tnle-Thc AInchin- cry nI the Mouth OfIhe Shaft Blown 300 Feet Awny-The Mine on Fire.",,"Feet Awny-The Mine on Fire.

 A terrible gas explosion occurred at one o'clock Thursday morning in the Laurel Creek mine, operated by the Southwest Improvement Company in Pocohontas, Va. One hundred and fifty five men were at work there at the time, and such was the force of the explosion that everyone was killed, and the fan nIng machine, engine, and cars were blown 800 feet from the entrance. The engineer at work near the mouth of the mine, as we'll as his assistant and col ored boy, were blown hundreds of feet away, and their mangled bodies were found scattered in every direction. The engineers head was found in Q ravine, and his legs and arms were picked up near the mine. Of those at work in or about the mine not one was left to tell the story.

 The little hamlet, whose population numbers about 500, and made up en- tirely of the houses of the miners, was resting quietly when the explosion oc- cured, but soon afterward the whole place was reused, and the scene which followed beggars description. The few living beings who saw puff of smoke shoot from the mine, and the sudden upheaval of the engines and cars, has, tened into the town with loud cries for help. Men, women and children were reused, and as soon as they compre- hended the dreadful news they made a wild rush for the scene of the disaster. Despite the cold night, women, as well NfF oIo1 rienced miners, on reaching the scene, were satisfied that no men in the mines were living. A slight rain and snow was falling, which added to the horrors of the situation, which has been intensi- fled by the discovery that the mine is op fire.

 The Laurel Creek mine is the only one in that part of the State, and has been operated for about two years. It con- sists of tunnel running three quarters of mile in the mountain side, and Q railroad runs the entire length of the mine. There are lateral galleries at in- tervals. The mine is situated above the water level, and for this reason it has until now been free from accident, not a single fatal casualty having occurred since operations were begun. W. A. Lathrop, the superintendent, is an ex- pert mining engineer and has had many years experience. The mines have been worked by reliefs every six hours.

 A train of cars, drawn by a small en- zine, was near the entrance and moving in the mine at the time of the explosion. Four cars and the engine were blown out, and a car axle was propelled by the force of the explosion into the side of a small frame house occupied by two miners, William Amony and Jake Sex ton. Both were asleep, having left the them. Their escape was wonderful, the iron wheels of the car falling by the side of their hunks. They struck a light, and, so far as can be learned, were the first to realize the situation and to give the alarm.

 The cause of the explosion is not yet definitely ascertained, as the entries to the mines are all full of bad mir, but the presumption is that one of the miners struck Assure of gas. Several parties ventured into the mines, but could not endure the foul atmosphere. A number of bodies were discovered horribly man. gled, some of them with their heads torn from the trunks, and others with the limbs all gone, representing horri- ble spectacle. The work of destruction was not confined entirely to the interior of the mines, but houses 200 or 300 feet removed from the mines were over. turned, and in several instances entirely demolished.

 The large ventilator of the Southwest Improvement Company was blown tc atoms, and the mines cannot be entered until another is constructed for the pur. pose of freeing the atmosphere of the suffocating fumes. This work is now progressing speedily. A large force is engaged on the outside of the mines constructing cofins and perfecting othel arrangements for the interment of tho dead. Those who were not killed out right by the terrible force of the explo sion most likely perished from the after 1 damp.

 The men employed in the mines wer, mostly Hungarians without families. 4 number of, negroes from Lynchburg anC the surrounding country were also em ployed.

 What effect the disaster will have or the operations of the miners can only be conjectured until the full extent of dam. | age is known. The mines have not been long opened, but the company had gotten well under way, and was supplying c large section of country with coal, and the prospect was most encouraging, g large coaling station for the supply oi ocean steamers being in process of con structure at Norfolk. While the accident will have the effect of retarding work al the mines, it is not believed that it will cause @ permanent discontinuance oi operations, as a great deal of money has been expended there by Northern capi. talists composing the Southwest Improve. ment Company.

 The latest intelligence concerning the explosion in the Pocahontas mines is tC the effect that about 150 men were killed | and that the accident was caused by the mems going too far into the mines witt their lamps. A relief train, with physi clans and force of workmen on board has gone to the scene of the accident from Petersburg. A dispatch has beer received at Petersburg asking that safety lamps be sent to Pocahontas at once tC facilitate the work of recovering the bodies.

 A correspondent who visited the mine said no one dared venture any consider able distance into any of the openings. Crowds of men, with melancholy, black enad visages, surrounded the shops and buildings, discussing the disaster. Only few women were seen in the vicinity, and these came more out of curiosity than in search of missing relatives.

 The indications of the fiery blast from the mine on the surface show that it shot with tremendous velocity from all the entrances southeast and north. Heavy mine cars, weighing more than a 1 ton Rtnndinn Gnn unrls within thn an."

ular of birds. For one thing it is the
herald of spring, and for another there
is ioyousness in its cry that is very
attractive. 1t is not, however, by any
means a favorite with other birds.
They look upon it suspiciously, much
as country folk regard a gypsy. For
tunately for cuckoos the memories of
little birds must be very defective, or it
is probable that when the murderer of
family reappeared on the scene of his
crime there would be popular riot,
and the mob of hedge sparrows, linnets,
titlarks and finches would lynch the
villain, or try to. Nor could its fate
meet with much sympathy. Yet with
regard to one bird, the house sparrow,
a certain measure of conformation might
be extended to any cuckoo who might
play off its confidence trick upon that
noisy rogue. The sparrow, as we have
already said. forfeits to some extent its
claims upon public regard by shame
less neglect of its duties. The town
cat, moreover, does not eat, since she
cannot catch it. Rainpipes, lamp posts
are not convenient hunting grounds for
cats, and the willy sparrow takes the
greatest possible care to build its nest
in positions well out OF Grimalkin' s
reach, and their lives are exceptionally
free from the usual sparrow cares.
Even when they speciously pretend to
revert to rustic habits, and go and con-
struct their untidy habitations among
the trees in the parks and gardens,
they are secured from molestation, 50
that their lot may fairly be. called a
happy one. Indeed, almost too happy
for such a world of cares as ours, 50
that little occasional tribulation in
the matter of cuckoos would not be
altogether unwholesome for them. We
could easily spare few sparrows.
Still the chances are that this extremely
wide awake little bird would not bf
such fool as to take cuckoo into its
confidence; nor, were one foisted upor
it, develop sufficient industry to feet
the strange thing. They begin to shift
for themselves early in life, the clever
little town birds, and the odds are tha
if a hulking hobbledehoy of cuckoo
kept on sitting in the nest and gaping
for food to be put into its great mouth
longer than the sparrows thought righ
and proper, they would coolly go of
and leave the overgrown wretch Il
cape alone until it was starved.-Lon

CHAIRMAN JONES' ADDRESS.


Mr.. Jones, permanent chairman read
the following address:


Gentlemen of the committee, [ did
not seek nor did expect this distin-
guished honor, I accept your action
not as a compliment to myself person
ally, but as a recognition of our great
business interests. I beg to assure you
the compliment is appreciated, and ]
thank you for it. In accepting the i'm.
portant position, T have many misgiv-
ings as to my ability to perform the du-
ties involved satisfactorily and only dc
so with the understanding that other
members of the committee will not only
assist, but give me the benefit of theil
superior experience, judgment and en-
o,,c.xy IT,
is my good fortune to have known Mr..
Blaine intimately over thirty years.
j have watched his career during
that time with unusual interest, and
have never known anyone to be accuated
by purer motives or goverae by high.
er standard of morals. His lofty patri.
otism and splendid abilities are recog.
nized and acknowledged everywhere.
He is always on the American side Of
every question. These virtues and these
accomplishments account for his won.
derful magnetism and for his nearness
to the heart OF. the American people. I
have not much Of a personal acquant-
ance with Gen. Logan, but who is there
in this broad land who does not know
his ms gnifcent record as q soldier and
his grand career as statesman? The
Democratic party must be held to its
record on free trade and tariff for rev.
enue only. Too many yet live who re-
member the languishment of trade,
scant employment and poor wages burn
ing of corn IN the west for fuel because
there was no other use for it un.
der Democratic domination to vote for
the party which threatens q return to
that condition Of affairs. Our people
believe that reasonably prosperous
times are attainable in this country.
The working classes especially ask,
claim and demand that they shall con-
tinue to have an opportunity to earn
such wages as will enable them to live
as American citizens should live With
such candidates, with such principles as
are set forth in our platform, success is
assured victory will be ours in Novem-
Der as sure as the sun will bless us with
its light. u Is &. ,.$S5 t&.s s.; [. l5
AT 3:15, after recess, tha chairman
again called the committee to order.
Secretary Fessenden read a communion

the club would be able to contribute to

plans had miscarriea, the Administra.
tion managers fell into a rage which
came near being a panic. This was
the situation last evening when the
Ednnnds men came to the rescue of
Mr.. ArJhur's alarmed followers with a
suggestion shrewder than generally
proceeds from that school of politicians.


II was that colored man be placed
in the field against Clayton, and that
all of the anti Blaine men in the Con-
vention unite in his support. The
Arthur men jumped at the chance for
a coalition, and thus it came about
that George William Curtis, the great
denunciator of the participation of
in political affairs, joined
hands with Flanagan, Of Texas, the
most notorious political spokesman of
the day, in making collector Of inter-
nal revenue chairman of the National
Convention. Their nomi-
nee was John II. Lynch, of Mississippi,
and in the Convention to-day he beat
Powell Clayton by q vote of 430 10 387


NIGHT AT THE HOTELS.


The scenes at the hotels o.night are
more animated than at any time since
he delegates began to assemble here.
Bands are parading the streets, the
sidewalks are jammed with people, and
he hotels are solid mass OF packed,
slow-moving humanity. The atmos-
phere of the Grand Pacific Hotel lobbies
and corridors are blue with tobacco
smoke, and the glee clubs are singing
N the Blaine headquarteI

or the nervous imposs ible.


AT THE BLAINE ROOMS.


The Blaine headquarters are the
great centre Of attraction. AT 9 o'clock
o. night there was not an inch of stand.
ng room in the immense apartment, and
he broad corridors leading to it were
ahmed with pushing, excited and
mob. A glee club in one
'orner sang Blaine songs of doubtful
excellence, but the crowd
houted its applause ut the end of each
verse and stimulated the voca,ists to
enewed exertions. This proceeding
vas occasionally varied by some dele
,ate, usually colored men from the
'outh, Jumping on table and address,
ng the company, testifying his ale
lance to the peoples choice, and pre-
letting his nomination.


ROars of applause and the sharp yells
f the excited auditors interrupted the
peaker at evey sentence, but when
ne man is exhausted another is always
ound ready to take his place, and the
leetings 60 on without a break for an
our or two at Iime.


""A great deal of fcaucusing and schem-
lg is on foot might. While it is

'tion being divided between Blaine and
herman, with several rancerous perso
al fights pending, there seems but

Everybody understands Mr.. Stewards higher
law doctrine, but it seems to be becoming
necessary in these degenerate days to postuate
q lower law also, and this lower law is called
lynching. The growth of the tendency to push
aside the forms of law, and to execute, we will
not say summary justice, but summary capital
punishment. upon men who have undergone no
trial, has been gradual, but it has now attained
PROPORTIONS which are seriously disqueting. 1t
is not only at the outskirts OF civilization, or
among semi -baTbarOus Southern communities
that this tendency is manifested. 1t is becOm-
ing so general that when murderls committed
even in some quiet New-England village, and
some person is arrested on suspicion, some
times find it stated in the tclegraphic
report of the case that ""There is some talk of
lynching,"" and it does not always stop at talk.
No doubt one cause of this disposition to dis
pense with the law is the frequency with which
grave crimes escape detection. Within the
past three months at least half dozen murders
have been committed with impunity. The
Rose Amber, Phoebe Paullin, Maybee and
other cases have balled the police completely.
Now it is natural that these numerous
failures should render the people angry
and impatient, but the remedy
is not to be found in lynching. 1t does not fol-
low because the police fail to find the murderer
of A. that the people ought TO take the chances
of hanging an innocent man for the murder of
B. But when, as sometimes happens, there is
little room doubt as to the guilt ola suspected
person, resort to lynching is even more un-
warrantable, since under such circumstances
the law can be safely trusted to administer the
penalty.


The most dangerous effect of the lynching
tendency, however, is its destructive influence
upon popular respect for the law 1t is in fact
a school Of anarchy, III which men learn TO
avenge their own real or fancied wrongs, and in
which they are taught to revert to thoroughly
barbarous lines of thought and action. If crime
too often escapes punishment il sthe duty Of
civilized community to improve its means Of
detection. If the process OF The law is unccr-
tain and caprciOus, it should be amended. The
means for the detection Of crime in this coun-
try are still crude. Outside the great cities they
can hardly be said to exist. The sheriff, the VII
lage constable and such officers are expected to
unravel mysteries which would tax the skill Of
the most highly trained and experienced de-
tective. And when the assistance OF trained de-
tectivesis calledin It's usually too late Prompt
ness in getting on the track of criminal is one
of the most indispensable requirements, BUTT is
seldom attained. Yet these drawbacks can be
removed. 1t is possible to provide skilled de-
tective force which shall be available at any part
of the State, and which can be put in motion
instantly by telegraph. And it is possible so to
amend the practice of the courts that it shall be
l.. Jof In fol
secure jury of imbeciles or worse.


These are the directions in which public
opinion should move, and not the direction of
lynching. That is always an attempt to offset
one wrong with another. 1t is balancing mob
murder against individual murder. 1t is on the
plane of violence and lawlessness, and not on"

Along about last August : certain con-
tractor who has been doing some grading
on Colorado railroads but now resident
Of Denver, named Bennett, entered into
conspiracy with cutrthroat Italian,
named vacaro, also . resident of this
city, whereby the green countryman of
the latter were to he robbed to support
the scheming pair.


The scheme was worked in this way !:
Vecaro proceeded at once to Italy. where
he enthused the poor workingmen with
: desire to come to this country, by fill
ing their ears with glowing accounts Of
the beantiesof this land the elysium
Of the poor man (?J.s He promised them
steady work at $I.75-and 81 per day, if
they would sign three-year's contract
with him, and pledge to give him 20
cents out of each days wages. This 20
cents was to be divided equally between
yacaro and Bennett, the latter to supply
the jobs.


It is said that the Italian Judas Be-
cured and brought over within the
neighborhood Of 200 men on this trip,
and that the poor devils are now at
Alamosa.


The story goes on, that on Wednesday
and Thursday of last week Bennett went
down into the Italian quarter of the
city and announced that he had steady
work, at $3.50, s.. rs and IS per day, for
$50 men. He told them that the work
was on the Alamosa ditch, and that it
would last six months. But, he told
them they would have to pay their
own fare, which would be $40. This the
men consented to do, in consideration of
theg good wages and steady employment
promised. The men were shipped, in
two detachments. &.


Arriving at Alamosa, they learned
that they had been deceived. The rest
may be gathered from the telegram to
the Republican. AT this writing no
word has been received from any of the
victims. ~ 81 ~.


just how the two schemers made any
thing out of this job I cannot affirm,
but that they did it without profit to
themselves, no one will be foolish
enough to think. There could be neat
little scalp taken from each fare and
numerous other plans are suggested. ]
haven't the time at present to look into
the particulars of the british Job.


If the information which have en-
bodied in the foregoing is correct, these
two fellows, Bennett and Yacaro should
be hanged within twenty-four hours, and
there is only one court that will bother
with or do justice to such case. I re-
fer to that business-ike tribunal pre-
sided over by Judge Lynch.


We are signing petitions in Denver to-
day, beseeching a gang of kid-gloyed
thieves and labor despoilers to protect us
from the rascally work of pauper labor
while 800 desperate men are
starving in Alamosa, or committing the.
deeds engendered in men by treachery
and hunger. II


And our statesmen are busily engaged
deciding who shall be chief of the rob-
bers in 1884. -"

Brum- ley says he merely spoke to him, whereupon McAdam began firing at close range with a pistol. Brumley returned the fire, his first bullet passing through McAdam's head. Brum1ey surrendered to the deputy sheriff and they both started for town. A few hours after Brumley's arrest about dozen of Mo Adams friends rode in and demanded the surrender of Brumley. This being refused they swore out a warrant charging Smith with being accessory to the assassination McAdam's friends declared that they would return and lynch both Brumley and Smith. The jail is being guarded by posse of citi- zens, but everyone fears the avengers of Nc Adam will appear, when bloody work must follow. Brumley's statement of the killing is generally discredited."

CARING FOR THE DEAD AND DYING.


On arriving at the Union station an ambulance
wagon and several cabs and busses in waiting.
A large crowd had gathered, and as the dead and
wounded were carried from the cars to the con-
vcyances many turned sick at the sight.
Fifteen bodies lay side by side in two rows on
opposite sides of the morgue. Mothers, fathers,
sisters and brothers were to be seen
passing from body to body and with
trembling hands lifting the coverlet to gaze on
the faces of the dead. Now and again cry of
anguish was heard, which told plainly of the dis
coyery of some relative carried off in the
prime of manhood. The hospital from an
early hour was crowded with relatives
and friends of the wounded On the arrival of the
wounded the full hospital staff Immediately pro-
cecded to undress them, while the doctors set to
work sewing up the wounds and dressing those
who were terribly scalded. Some of the latter
were burned from head to foot by the steam.


One of the victims John Rowlett died shortly
after arriving at the hospital. When found among
the debris he spoke cheerfully and asked to be al
lowed to walk. On looking down he cried: d"" God,
my legs areof."" And so they WERE burned off.
Coroner Lynd empanellcd jury, who at once met
and viewed the bodies and then adjourned until 2
o'clock, when they again met and some evidence
wa taken and a further adjournment was had until
Tuesday night.

Mrs Bolton, and reported daily TO her husDane.
One day however Bolton discovered that his VIE

his wife had been unfounded, and the couple
were reconciled. Mrs. Bolton then contided to her
husband the manner in which she became aware
that she was watched. According to her story, on
watch her. accompanied by Ludlow, he came 10 ner

tributed $40 and Mrs. Bolton 80, and they gave
the 800 as hush money to the detectives

THE NATIONAL BANK OF THE REPUBLIC.
ITS OFFICERS BORROWING 5000, 600 FROM 1.-THE


NEW DIRECTORS.


There was great deal of talk in Wall Street, yes
terday about the National Bank of the Republic
and the affairs of ITS depOscd officers lhe casler
of the bank declared late on Monday afternoon that
neither the president nor the ylce-presIdent owed
the bank dollar. He repeated several times the
reGuest that this fact might be announced on his
authority. At an carly hour yesterday IT was ad-
mitted that the officers had borrowed httle Jess less
mortgage bonds of the Cleveland, Youngs-
town and PittsbuTg Railway Company
at one-half Of their face value. one
the lateness of the inquiry undoubtedly the
reason why the cashier had not made the exact
facts known. In addition to the loans at the BANK
of the Republic IT is understood that the railroad
company has made others at the Metropolitan
National Bank, the Home Insurance Company, thc
Chemical National Bank, and at other aces. ~ ,,


""The burden has been distributed IN wall
Street."" a director OF the bank SAID; that Is, we
not the only ones who have MADE ioas on these
bonds Some of the paper is overdue but 1t has
not been protested simply because protest would
add nothing to the security. The loans have been
extended because they were not pald' ni ana
nothing could be gained by mere
formaity. We hayo had the ,resignationSS
of the officers for at least six weeks, but we held
them on conditions We think that the bank VIII
get ont of its trouble remarkably well. Ihc taCt is
that each man who made q loan on these bonds fiat
tered himself that he the only one to whom aP-
plicatiOn had been made. The extent OF the ral-
road cOmpany's Indebtedness has not yet been
realized by some of the lenders""


Mr. Ford said that the railroad company had
issued about 81 100000 first mortgage bonds, but
that few of them had been sold lie declined to
state what part of the issue had been pledged to
secure temporary loans.

A writer in the Philadelphia TINES SAYS:


Every now aud then little commotion Is
started among manufacturers of the North
as u the danger Of successful competition
on the part Of manufacturers In tue same
branches in the South. year or more ago
much was said as TO the probability Of South
ern cotton goods pushing into markets here
tofore controlled by New England manufact-
urers, and the railroad companies were APP
pealed to by New York commission houses 70
protect them against Southern competition
through favorable freight rates. A vast
amount Of figuring has been done to aseer-
tain what degree Of competition Southern
cotton manufacturers are likely to offer, the
outcome Of which Is so far not particularly
discOur1ging 10 Northern manufacturin z in
teresls.


Recently another hubbub has been raised
over the probabilities OF Southern pig-irou
crOwding OFT Northern pig-iron and inter
ested parties have been at great pains to as
certain 10 what extent Southern iron has
been use in the North In preference to
Northern pig; how Il suits and what econ
omic advantages there are in IL The gener-
al conclusion arrived at in New England is
that certain ma<es of Southern iron can be
prOiIably used in place OF Pennsylvania iron
and in other cases mixed, and tue business
in Southern irons seems 10 be slowly extend
ing. In this market su1d demand has
grown up for irOp for a certain purpose aud
this has given rise 10 little more movement
in Southern irons, whicn is probable 70 ter
mlnato with the giving out OF this temporary
demand.

hracite and bitumin,-us hla furn b, In Dp-
Grafton on November Ony tEenty-two were

at present i've are in blast and five out. The
list Is as follows: The A ice, capacity 60, 900

at present. less tban 100. 900 tons per aunum
Is made, though the estimated capacity is
., $40 tons per week. The prospects of the
pig-iron industry can be best judged by the.
fact that i've furnaces are projected Ia that
state, one at Alpine, two at Russellville, one
at Birmingham and one az Sheffield.

for these furnaces are mostly in Cincinnati
and Louisville. In Tennessee there ar,
eight bltuminous furnaces, Of which five ar,.
In operation, three idle and two building

duce 100, 900 tOhs. Tennessee has nine

lows: The Buffalo Gap furnace, capacity,

ginia has thirty-One charcoal stacks. Ca
pacity, 10O. 900 tons per annum. One stack
Is 10 be built at or near Luray. Philadelphia
iron-makers are deeply interested In iron
making in the South and are by no means
permitting any prospective advantages 10 be
monopolized by others.


The present production Of bitumiuous or
coke furnaces in the southern states, includ-
ing West Virginia. Is about 9, 900 tons per
week aud Of charcoal furnaces about 8. 600
tons, total Of II, 900 tons The present Idle
bituminous and coke furnaces in those states
have capacity of 1900 tons per week. The
cost OF iron making in the SOuth has been
variously estimated and ranges from SO to
$l3 per ton, which, with freights ranging to
North Atlantic ports from 81, 10 to S4.75,
gives cost here at from Sl4 10 to SIS, accord
ing to quality. The recent activity in South
erH iron means nothing, because much Of Il
is for pipe-makfng, which does not call for
pipeiron. Besides, an accumulation has
been going on and the holders are anxious
for cash.


1t is not always safe TO draw conclusions
from all the facts in sight. The iron indus
try in the South has vast possibilities before
Il. Northern manufacturers see IL and prove
It by extending their interests in that direc
ton. The strongest safeguard of northern
makers is the cost Of carriage from furnace
TO market. The home cost varies from 81
to $3.50 per ton, while Southern iron costs
from three 10 four times that sum. Still
competition and enterprise and the unexpec-
ted may all combine 10 force a rearrange-
ment in the pig-iron industry that will re-
dound TO the benefit Of the South"

Courthouse yard, one to cross
beam Of the yard gate, and one to
china limb, his throat also cut, just
outside the enclosure where Tom
Bailey was lynched about eighteen
months ago.


There were four other negro
prisoners in the Jail at the time
one CHARGED with an assault and
attempt to kill; one with rape, one
with arson and one with stealing
hogs, but they wero unmolested, it
is presumed, because there was
strong doubt of their guilt. Brown

murder of young Freeman in Jeffer-

Of venue to Franklin, was sail by
the guard to have been the first one
asked for, but be had not then been
delivered to the Franklin authorities,

of the four negroes. The Sheriff Of
Jefferson reached Meadv'lle with
him Sunday evening, just after their
burial.

that if the Jail wasn't cleaned out
this term they would call again.

personal bearing, IL he had exhibited in

BILE officer, tho mon would follow him to
tho death, because they believed that
thoy were doing the best for their cause.
| Tho American soldier as veteran is an
officer in oil but tho shoulder-straps, and
L believe that this statement may bo
taken as an axiom.


But my indignant recollection has
caused mo to digrcss. This adjutant
moved us TO tho brink Of the river. and
he had sense enough to range the mon on
n bluff about sixty feot above the surface
of the stream and where the channel was
within 100 yards of the bluff. A wheat
field (the wheat WAS then nearly four
feet high) extended absolutely down to
the brink of the bluff, which dropped
sheer down to the brink of the stream.
According to tho command Of the adju-
tant aforesaid tho men laid down on their
bellies on the brink Of the bluff and
waited patiently for the coming Of the
gunboat, the order being given that fire
should bo reserved until he (the adjutant)
should give tho signal. Tho id fool
was so fussy and nervous that wo knew
tho whole affair would prove fiasco,
apd then what good could be gained, it
was asked except to excite the fedorsls to
to raid tho Allen plantation, which had


been hitherto unaccountably spared from
visitation. We certainly could not cap
ture gunboat with rifle shots.


Time wore on, and after we had boon
watching for an hour or so tho two smoke
stacks of the gunboat came slowly round
ing into the quiet reach of the river before


us. Unsuspioiously (tho negroes on the


plantation were true blue, or they might


have given warning) tho boat came on,


the officers and men lounging about the


decks, when, as they were approaching


US at 100 yards, our nervous commander,


instead of letting them get fully abreast


Of US. fired his rifle. We poured volley
into them, and while the crew dived down


into the hstchwsys like prairie dogs into


their burrows, the captain maintained


his place, and his hoarse voice was heard


cry, ""Back her back her hard d-d.""


We on the bluff thought we had made q
! fine stroke, for at least five men were
laying dead or wounded on the deck,
and our little adjutsnt was jubilant


jumping up aud cracking his heels.


But we had counted without our


host, and tho tables were turned upon
us with q vengeance. The crows nest on
tho mainmast. which In our ignorance We
thought o simple lookout station, was
ironclad, with twelve pound howitzeI


on pivot therein, and no sooner had the
boat got clear of the bluff around th'


bend Of the river than they opened upon
us with canister at short range and gave
us such dose of it as made US laugh the
wrong side of the mouth.


; The speedy manner in which our mer
| got through that wheat field with the
canister rafting about us WAS caution
I to sinners, and, by way of Interpolation
, / may say thejackass adjutant was amonI
the first who made tracks for place o
/ safety. The result of this foolish esca


pade was that ten good men were killed
and wounded to further the ambition o
A an incompetent dude.

 CLEVELAND, O., Sept. 29.-The organized gang of firebugs that infest this city are still hard at work, and yesterday they made three different attempts to burn down the city. The first fire was started about 9 o'clock in the yards of the Cleveland Sawmill and Lum- boring company, and, famed by strong southwest wind, spread with such rapidity as to excite the greatest alarm The fire depart ment, which has become exceedingly vigilant, responded with alacrity and within fifteen minutes ten steamers and two hook and lad der companies were heroically at work fight ing the flames. By this time several man. moth piles of lumber were on fire, and the principal building of the company was en- veloped in flames and apparently doomed The wind blew fercely and tongues of fire 1eaped high in the air, sending sparks and cin- ders across the river to the city. All work in the vicinity was suspended, and the men from neighboring yards and manufactories, with mu1titudes of citizens, rushed to the aid of the fremen. Fortunately the wind was blowing toward the river and over an area where there was but little to burn, and to this fact alone can be attributed the es- cape from 0 loss of property exceeding any thing heretofore reported. After a fight of an hour, the flames were gotten under con- trol, and finally extinguished, with loss to the company not exceeding $25, ,000. It was narrow escape, however, and the sighs of relief from the people were mingled with anathemas against the williams who had again jeopardized the city, and talks of lynching and roasting the perpetrators were Sawmill and Lumber company is To- cated on upper Central Way, about quarter of a mile from the scene of the for mer fires. Their yards cover twenty acres, and have storage capacity, outside of their mills, for 20, ,000,000 feet of lumber. The fire was started in the outskirts of the yards, among the lumber piles where no men had been at work for several days.

 While the attention of the crowd was ab- sorbed in the above fire flames were diseov- cred bursting from passenger coach and baggage car of the Connotton Valley rail road standing on the track halfn mile away, and in close proximity to wooden buildings

 

 engine was speedily attached to them and they were drawn down the track where there was no danger of firing anything else and were there quickly consumed. The loss on the cars is about $3, 800. A colored bootblack about considerable about the firing of the cars, was arrested and is held as 8 witness.

 An attempt was also made late in the after noon to burn the Perkins block, on the south side of the square A fire was started in some rubbish on the upper floor, and was burning briskly when discovered and ex- tinguished These incidents have intensified the feeling that already prevailed, and ven geance, swift and dire, is threatened if the guilty parties are caught, and it is safe to say that if a fire bugshould be detected in any part of the city he would be hanged to the first lamp post.

 The frebugs piled their vocation industri ously to-day The first alarm was received at o'clock this morning and was occasioned by the discovery of smoke issuing from the barrel and filling the house of Scofeld, Thurman & Teagle, connecting with their oil refinery The building was soon enve- loped in flames and was totally destroyed It contained 750 barrels of refined oil and the flames from the burn into the air. The building was one hundred by one hundred and fifty feet in size and with it's contents is total loss, amounting to $12, ,000. short time after fire was dis covered in the shoe shop of Michael Kamick, 627 Pearl street, but was exinguished before it had done much damage. This fire was started by pile of rubbish being saturated with oil and match applied. Up to midnight no other alarms have been turEed in.

 Opera House.

 Peck's Grand Opera House presented brilliant scene last evening. when the St. Aloysius T. A. B. society with their friends gathered to hold their tenth annual soiree. The hall was finely decorated for the occa- sion, festoons of evergreens being suspended around the front of the gallery. The private boxes were covered with flags and embowered in evergreens, the one on the right side hav- ing the American flag, and facing it, over the opposite box, was the Ereen flag of Ireland. The grand march did not begin until ten o'clock, by which time nearly 150 couples were in the hall listening to several concert selections played by Landrigan's orchestra. The march was formed under the direction of Professor Flaherty, and was headed by Fran cis J. Reynolds, the grand conductor, and Miss Mary Ward. About 125 couples took l part in the march and they were reinforced by many others in the succeeding dances. A pumber of friends were present from Water l bury, Meriden, Bridgeport. Hartford, and other places Among the ladies present were the Misses Nellie and Annie O'Keefe from South Hadley Falls, Mass, who are spending the holidays with their friend Miss Julia Coyne of Fair Ha- | ven, and with them were Miss Coyne, MT. M. W. Dorgan of Meriden and MT. John l Coyne. Others present from this city were ! the Misses Dolan, Miss Mostert, the Misses Campbell, Miss Minnie O'Briep, the Misses 1 Gunschon, the Misses McQueeney, Miss Roach and mahy others. It was well into the small hours of the night when the merry dancers sought their touches to dream of the happy hours spent at one of the pleassntest social occasions in the history of the St. Aloysiuf T.

Gangs of unconth fnr ners, Italians, Wal


rackS, Buhemlaus a. 81 ers Of the minor
European nationalities aie seen almost daily
tramping our streets in parties of score or
fifty at time. Mud bespattered boots and
coarse clothing indicate them to belong
to the laboring casses-usually the en-
/ ployees o. railway contractors who have in
hand the construction Of the various new lines
ofthe vicinity. These foreigners are at pres
ent the object of some notoriety. From
different parts of the country come almost
daily reports of their breaking the law-us-
ually that they have taken their derelict pay
masters in hand and treated them to an
| illustration Of that summary style of pro-
ceedings recognized in the court Of Judge
Lynch.


| 1t would be as wrong to com mend their
course as TO allow the deeds of their en-
| ployers to pass uncondemned.
They are strangers in the land-entirely
ignorant Of our customs, language and
laws.


1t is allowed that they perform their task
laborious, exposed and unenviable as it is,
to the satisfaction of their employers-but
it seems they are unusually clamorous in
insisting upon the full wage coming forth,
exactly on the day it is due.


Their presence here is animadverted upon
in me directions as repellent-they are os-
tracised-and have already become distinct
element in the social community. They
have made no effort at affiliation and are
come to be recognizedS to a certain degree,
as the Chinese, transient element, carry
ing with them, always an intention of ul-
teriorly returning to their native land, there
to end their days, enjoying the fruits of
their past industry and frugality here. Much
of the sentiment of hostility existing in
reference to this people may be ascribed to
the above causes. In their recent troubles,
they do not appear to get that share of pub
lie sympathy which similar causes would
instantly gam for our own people were they
in the same predicament. Turning to the
latest local instance, it appears that the sum
of $2.SS4, in hard cash was too strong a
temptation for the contractors Fitz Patrick
and McGurgan. These individuals abscond-
ed and left their italian employees on the
B. and P. road unpaid. At Newark, where
the work is being done, the laborers have
made no answer to the railroad company's
proposition to return to work, ""but sullenly
and doggedly whine that they want their
money"" 1t is reported that should the men
trouble is feared. In other parts Of the
country these foreigner laborcrs have, on
similar proyocation, seized their derelict
paymasters and, with the hangman's rope
around their necks, have compelled them to
dsgorge.


Without attempting to palliate the offence
against our laws in taking the matter in
their own hands, it may be asked in extenua-
tion of their deeds ''what recourse had
they?''


Without the sympathy of the community
in which they found themselves, discover
ing that they were in the hands of unscru-
pulous paymasters, located in outlying dis
tricts where legal trickery can be so manip-
ulated that the real offenders have every
facility for the evasion of justice, and the
consummation of their fraudulent intents
upon this helpless class can be effected al
most with impunity-is it matter of sur
prise that we see these results 1t would be
only just to suppose that in the ignorance
Of the liabilities they incur they took the
law into their own hands.


There should be vigorous demand from
all quarters that the rascally deeds of these
irresponsible contractors receive their due
in summary condemnation aud punishment
at the hands of justice."

 BATAVIA, Jan. 24.-The main features of to days progress in the Powell murder trial were the statements given by Dawson, the proprietor of the Natio nal Hotel, and w. T. Palmer, Rowells former partner. On cross

 examination Dawson swore positively that Rowell's looks and actions while stopping in his house two days before the tragedy were

 such as to attract his attention and he con ] sidered him irrational and unnatural. He enumerated as grounds for his belief glassy appearance of the eyes and an apparent stare. He bore an abstracted and preoccu- pied look, was troubled with quick and ner-

 vous movements and frequently paced rap idly up and down the floor. On the redirect the county prosecutor endeavored by long and close examination to break the force of the evidence. The witness, however, clung to his first conculsions without being always able to give reasons for them.

 The evidence of W. T. Palmer came nearer the sensational than anything which

 has occurred during the trial. He was g

 partner of Powell. He did not take the

 stand until after 4 p. m. After the usua

 preliminary examination he detailed slowly

 and coolly the story of how he had influenced

 Rowell's mind concerning his wife. He said

 his first suspicious of anything wrong be-

 tween Lynch and Mrs. Rowell were gained

 from some of the private letters from him to

 her which he had opened and read. Mrs.

 Rowell was angry at him and when he asked

 Powell whether it was because of the letters

 he said yes. Witness then asked

 Powell why his wife had not shown

 him the letters from Lynch and he said he did

 not know. ''I"" continued witness, 'ftold

 him if he would read the letters or she would

 show them to him, he would find plenty of

 evidence of his wife's infdelity. I also re

 D aated to him what she had said to me on

 one or two occasions. Once she said to me,

 T am going to have big boy with 8 straight

 97 either (Rowell and his family at

 this time lived at 97 Howard avenue, Utica

 Once she said to mel like big men and have a large man now (Lynch was very finely built man. Again when told her that it was wrong to receive attentions from other men she said her husband was as cold as an iceberg and she was consequently jus | tifed in accepting other mems attentions RoweIl went to Rochester and found Lypch and Mrs Powell had been there together suggested he should go away again | without leaving his wife enough money to enable her to get out of town. My idea 1 was that she would summon Lynch to Batavia and that he could have detectives l here who could catch them together""

 l Palmer's direct testimony only about I half finished when the court tonight took a I recess. It shows that he probably filled I Rowelrs mind full of stories about his wife l which directly led to Lynch's death and

 Rowelrs crime. The evidence is put in by 1 the people to show that two months before ! the shooting occurred Powell knew of I his wife's relations to Lynch and that his act was not the result of insanity momentsry I excitement, but rather of well neditated I plan. Palmer's portion in the matter is severely criticised Dr. Andrew of the Buff 1 falo Insane asylum is here. called by the pro- | secution.

Mr.. Plat called up for the purpose of max
ing some remarks on it. his bill providing
for the organization of the patent Office into
separate departments He added many con-
siderations to those showing the necessity for
the reorganization of the patent office, for an
increase in its working force or larger accom-
modations for the transaction of business. To
illustrate the over crowded condition of the
business at present, he said that if man in
vented new machine relating to agriculture
il would take eight months before the ap-
plication could be passed upon. He attached
no blame to the patent Office employees or to
the department of the interior, but insisted
that the inventors of the country were EMIT
led to better treatment than it was possible
to give. They had contributed more than
any other class Of men to the wealth, pros
perity and progress of the country. The
patent Office was the only depot of the gov
ernment that absolutely paid its own way,
and instead of continuing the practice of
small appropriation, cramped quarters, and
tine defective system that threw discourage
ment in their way, it should be large and lib
eral appropriations, ample working room and
a sufficient staff of experts to dispose prompt
ly and judiciously of all applications that
may be sent in.


On the conclusion of Mr.. Platt's remarks
the Senate went into executive session, and
when the doors reopened, adjourned.


HOUSE.


In the House this morning, Mr.. Beach of
New York. from the committee on public
health, reported back resolution directing
that the committee investigate the question
of the adulteration OF food and drugs.


Mr.. Browne of Indiana thought that the
adulteration of food should be regulated by
States.


Mr.. Cox of New York called attention to
the fact that while before the war but 500
bills would be presented to Congress in a
year. At this session 1000 had been already
introduced. Congress was taking in every
thing. Congress had no right to be perpet-
ually interfering with local matters, and he
objected to microscopic bills brought in for
the purpose of getting the surplus out of the
treasury. He moved to lay the resolution on
the table.


The motion was lost-yeas ia, NAYS 1874,
and then on motion of Mr. Cox the resolution
was recommitted-yeas III. nays ll6.


The following bills and resolutions were
introduced:


BY Mr.. Fineriy of Illinois, joint resoIu-
tion declaring ''that the thanks of Congres.
are due and are hereby accorded to u. S.
Minister Sargent for the faithful and digni.
fed manner in which he had discharged the
duties of his Office while representing this
| republic while at the court of the German
Empire""


BY MIR. Kasson, bill to repeat the internal
revenue tax on tobacco and the distillation OF
apples and peaches.


BY Mr.. Nichols of Georgia, resolution
reciting the fact that for several days the city
of Cincinnati had been menaced by a mol
of vigilance committees and ku klux organ
izations, which have subverted the law of the
land and disturbed public tranquility in re-
peated efforts to lynch certain persons con-
| fined in Jail in Cincinnati charged with crime
| resulting in the loss of many lives and thu
destruction Of much property, and requesting
the Sherman committee to inquire into the
| circumstances connected with these outrages
and report by bill or otherwise.


BY Mr.. King of Louisiana, appropriatinl
| s400. 900 for the relief of the sufferers from
the Mississippi floods.


The bill retiring the trade dollar was theT
| taken up.


Mr., Bland of Missouri took the floor Il
opposition to the bill, and especially to thu
section which provides that trade dollars re
ceived at coinage mints shall be regarded a
silver bullion, and at bullion value shall b.
deducted from the amount of bullion requires
to be purchased and coined by the act of Feb
20, 1873.


Messrs. Miller of Texas and Lacey o
Michigan supported the bill, the latter saying
however that he would vote against it if tn
fourth section, which provides that the trad
dollar shall be deducted from the month"";
coinage of the silver, we're stricken out.


Without action the matter went over,
Robert Smalls Of South Carolina appeared
at the bar of the House and took the oath o

In our first issue we elected to

pleasant duty to severely denounce
one of our Northern journalists for

because of Mr.. Lynch's election TO

If education is an incentive to send
people to the penitentiary, what a
vast number of candidates then are
for that dispicable abode. What a
sad commentary to think that all
who lay claim to intelligence are
destined for such fate. Shame on
such conclusions! The editor him
self, perhaps, will escape such fate
because of his unquestionable dumb
ness. Instead we predict that he is
on his road to perdition. The fact
is this smart (O editor is apprehen

chance with his white neighbor, will
surpass him; hence his efforts to

no credit thereon. In such niggerly
conclusions we would not give much
$50 to speak, for any colored boy of
ten or twelve if he couldn't more
clearly and accurately reason. If the
poorer classes of the south (of whom,
perhaps, this editor is one), especially
the whites, had more book learning
there would not be so many cold
blooded murders committed and
other crimes more adapted to heather
than to a civilized county or com
munity.


If the next congress, instead Of en-
acting law 10 retard the progress of
education, would pass a bill consign-
ing this pitiable editor and others of
his like to proper care, it would be a
blessing to the country, and from all

There was an interesting discussion
upon the adoption of rules, that
brought out some strong sentiments
from southern republicans in regard
to their representation in the national
councils of the party. Broadley of
Kentucky made very earnest appeal
for justice. Among other things he
said:


""It is we'll known to this conven-
ton that in the South to-day our
voices are stifled by fraud and force,
and yet you are asked to take from
them a representation which by Dem
ocratic fraud and force ia denied them
[Applsuse. If in the South we are
to have Democratic force and fraud
on the one side and Republican dis
franchisemeRt on the other, may God
have mercy on US. Applause There
have been times in this country when
the South saved the Republican par
ty. lApplause. Three hundred
thousand of her brave soldiers march
ed to the battle field and helped their
brothers in the North to save the
Union. 1t was Florida in 1876 that
gave you a President. Applause. ]
1t was that gallant, brave hero, Ma
hone, who saved US the United States
Senate. [Applause.l l say to yon,
brethren of the Republican States
Beware! Beware! The time is com.
ing in this country when you may be
in the minority, and when we in the
South may in some states have q ma.
jority. Don't fall by the hands OF
your own selves. Give
Us justice. Danish your frowns.
Give US your encouragement and aid
az you give it to other states, and
mark my word, If you do not find
that West Virginia, North Carolina,
Florida and the Old Dominion, in
spite of Democratic shot guns, in spite
of legalized murders that cry to God
for vengeance, will give you their
electoral votcs.""


Lynch, in his speech, stated that
when he ran for congress in the 9Th
district of Mississippi in 1880, he
knew there were not less than 5000
votes polled for him that were
counted for the man that ran against
him. The official return gave him
5000 of Lynch's votes, and he con.
sidered that if the amended rule was
adopted it was virtually, saying to
southern republicans, ""we will only
admit you on what the Democrats
choose to give you""


Warner of. Missouri said that his
state cast $4,000 republican votes
They had fought democracy and re.
bellion during the war, and are still
fighting democracy, and he protested
against the Republican party giving
sanction to the frauds of the de.
mocracy in the south.


Stone of Iowa said he believed the
William Mabones of the south
should be encouraged in this con.
vention.


Mr.. Townsend, of New York.
participated in the winter of 1867 in
the endeavor to cast the electoral
votes that we cast in this Union. We
counted the votes, and with those
votes we declared that Mr.. Hayes
was President of the United States by
lawful election. We found in those
Investigations that there were 10000
more Republicans in South Carolina
than there we're Democrats. We
found that there were 1900 more
Republicans in Mississippi than there
were Democrats, and perhaps 10000.
We found that there was a very large
majority of Republicans in Louisiana,
ouu loit lOIluos XNo"",
these facts having been developed
and presented to the world, how will
the Republican party ever say that
because Bourbon violence cane into
the South and suppressed Republican
votes in those states, we will dis
franchise our faithful allies in the
South? [Applause.l

Three Good Races Uowed Last Night ny


tho Potomac Boat Club.",,"The Potomac Boat club held its regular semi
monthly meeting last evening and, as is not
usual in boating matters, the boats were
ready to start at the time sot for the first
raco--630 o'clock. This race was for four
oarned crews over course from the front Of
the boat house, at tho foot Of Congress street,
throo-quartor5 Of mile up stream, to point
above tho Aqueduot bridge, and return. Tho
crews were as follows; Light weights
Charley Warden, bow; Douglass, q John
Doyle, 3, and Trescott, stroke. Richmond
Wooten, bow; O0loy, q Happone, 3, and Var
row, stroke. Jumbo--Cornwoll, bow; Finley,
2; Antisoll, 3, and Smallwood, stroke. Tho
Lynchburg crew did not start, as had been
intended.


Mr.. Sam Whcatley was both starter and
referee, and at the word all throe got OIL we'll
together, without any appreciable advantage
to either and stayed in line until just OPP

High street. whom Doyles seat jumped, and
from that moment the light weights were
beaten, but followed and went over the
course The race was won by tho Jumbos
by not more than half length, tho Rich
mond crew squirting bravely Mt tho finish, but
too lato to show their bow In front. The
betting was heavier than usual at those club
regattas and was In favor of the light
weights. When his seat jumped Doyle was
left on the sharp rails of tho slide, but

the bridge, when tho scat was recovered and
replaced, but too late to recover lost time.


The second race was for pair-oared work.

entries had been mado beforehand. The
entries were Ofley and Libbey In tho Lula,
and Yarrow and Antisell in an unnamed
boat Tho race was over tho same course and
was won handsomely by half dozen lengths
by Yarrow and Antisell, although at the
start the Lula took water first, and kept the
lead nearly to tho bridge.


| The next and last was tho ladies' race, in
six-oared gunwalo boats, each carrying q
lady coxswain. There were three entries, as
as follows. the Marguerite-Small-

Miss Venie Bryan at the yoke ropes; the
Adelaide-Carusi, ,Zappone, and Norleus, with
Miss Lou Bryan steering; and the Blanoh-
Rogers, Douglas and Cornwell, with Miss
Smart as pilot. AS this raco was for half o
mile down stream, finishing opposite the
boat house, the start was not seen, but tho
Marguerite finished so little ahead of the
Blanche that dispute arose and tho referee
ordered another heat. The whole
race was SO close that the Adelaide was
hardly more than a length in the rear. The
Marguerite and Blanche then rowed n second
heat, resulting in favor of the former by only
a length By this time 1t had grown so dark
that the races for barges and the singles were
not called, although two of the single rivals
had spirited friendly squirt over the course

TRENTON, N. j., May 26-Fully 1000
persons assembled at the base ball
grounds this afternoon to witness the
first contest between the two leading
clubs In tho Eastern League. The home
club selected their strongest team, with
Murphy In the pitchers holes, and each
player started in with determination
to win. The visitors won the toss and
took the fold. The game was battle
between the rospectives batteries,
neither club being able to hit hard, only
one run being earned, while the re-
mainder wero principally through
errors.


Up to the fifth inning the visitors
were unable to hit Murphy, when Burns
thought there was something wrong,
and suggested that the distance from
the home plate to the pitchers box be
measured, which was done, amid loud
shouts from the hoodlums, and the um'
pire discovered it to be about eighteen
inches or two feet shorter than the rules
require. The box WAS then moved back,
and after the close OF the sixth inning
the visitors began to hit Murphy hard,
McCloskey leading with q two-bagger
and scoring on a passed ball. In the
eighth inning Snyder was retired and
Burns got in his solid hit for three bases
amid cheers and scored on another
passed ball. Nolan also got in hit
but was left AZ WAS also Lynch. who
was given his base on balls.

was retired at first. The Wilmington
ade five hits with q total of eight
bases and six errors, three of which
were credited to the pitcher for giving
the home team their bases on balls.
The Trenton made eight singles and
six errors. The fielding on both sides
was the finest ever witnessed on a
Trenton ball ground, the most notice
able features being the difficult catches
by Williams and Brouthers at right
and left field. Say for the visitors made
two brilliant stops at third, and was
loudly cheered, while Lynch and Bas.
tian played their usual good game.


The home team scored four runs In
the second inning, aided by one hit and
errors of Cusick, Snyder and Nolan

Among the many signs Of decay to, be
detected by the most careless observer u
our existing society none is. more omin-
Gus than the appalling and increasing
Iimmorslity Of the idle classes If il be
true that hypocrisy is the tribute paid BY
vice to virtue, the small surprise excited
by the nauseating revelations Of the last
few months show more deeply seated
corruption than would hare been indi-
Gated by, the, storm Of hypocriticsl indig7
nation which such disclosures would
surely have reused q generation ago.
When one hereditary legislator is proved
to have run off with the wife Of another
after illtreating his own, the circum-
stance hardly excites remark. The,pee
who. as members Of the vigilance COM
mittee for the suppression Of immortality
in the streets, sat in conclaye London the
fothef day, did not place on record their
disgust at the fact that one who is now
sitting in their own chamber has been
found guilty of a Crime (which intox-
ication was no excuse, and three weeks
confinement no punishment. The pro-
posal to reinstate in his former position
in her majesty g army a man convicted
of a deed which, neless civilized com
munities would have been punished by
Judge Lynch, lis enthusiastically urged
in-letters to the public prints by hun.
dreds of women, apparently on the
ground that this man Was no worse than
so many others. The exposure Of wide
spread depravity amongst the well-to-do
classes in Dublin is instantly followed
by open declarations that the great work
Of the new head master of public
school win be to prevent THE sons 81 the
wealthiest families in England learning
all that is bad, If he cannot teach them
anything that is good. Yesterday the
horrible details Of a divorce case in the
..highest circlesa would have been 4
three days wonder had not those inter-
ested in such matters been supplied with
fresh food for gossip BY the death under
painful circumstances of one whose busi-
ness in life was to make and to enforce
the laws Of his country. 'iitf tsS'i y y


But the instances that come, to light,
numerous and distressing as they are,
form merely the outward and visible
signs of the wantonness which springs
from luxury and safety. AS q matter Of
historical fact we do not find that this
cynical immortality showed itself In socl-
eties where no. classes were exempted
from work. Itionly rears I its head In
communities where s6me Of the MEM
ibers are exposed all their lives long 10
the enervating effects Of idleness ana
luxury. igt,i = EsatsvI.s


+ Now the question comes how is the
moral atmosphere to be cleared 2 Where
are We to look forsthe growth OF public
opinion strong and honest enoughit6 en-
courage true morality without fostsrins

with the groHipg dsprayity against

News was received in this city last
evening of murderous assault made upon
one of the guards at the Clinton, Iowa,
bridge about p. m. yesterday. 1t seems
that the guard, named Ward, and another
man were turning the draw of the bridge
to allow steam boat to pass through.
They had but fairly got started when a
man came running from the Illinois shore
and told them to stop as he wanted to get
to the Iowa shore Immediately. The
guard told the fellow that he must wait
till the boat passed, when the chap be-
coming much excited, drew revolver and
fired, the ball taking effect in Mr.. Ward s
head, passing in on the right side of his
nose, and taking an upward course. The
murderer ran towards the Illinois shore
after firing the shot, and would have es-
capped but for the action of a conductor
who on coming up to the bridge from the
Illinois side, and learning of the affair,
ran his train back until the tramp, for
such he subsequently proved to be, was
overtaken and captured after a lively
chase. The tramp had two revolvers, one
of them in his boot leg He was convex
ed to the jail in Clinton and there were
loud threats of lynching him. The
wounded man lies in precarious con-
dition, the doctors being unable to locate
the bullet."

name of order, is symptomatic of diseased
condition of society. Reports of murders and
other pronounced crimes are, in almost every
instance accompanied by the statement that
a lynching is contemplated, or about to take
place. Yesterdays news contained accounts
of two such proceedings, in which six men
were killed outside of the process Of law. 1t
IS no sufficient apology that these lawless pro-
.e $ result in better state of soci-


that the exigencies demand


even admitting this, it only en-


fact that law and justice are in


Aad do not command the respect


az <ce Of the people


5 -ot be truthfully denied that there is
""a has been for long time a criminal rot
H4nness in courts and court processes, and the
| ,me for this condition Of affairs must be laid


4 both those within and those without


xofficers OF courts who are content to see
5tice defeated, and upon the people who wit
ness such things without seeking reform in
the way prescribed by laws. The fault
is not with the law as written 50 much as
with the manner in which it is permitted to
be interpreted not so much with the consti-
tuition of the courts, in the way Of judges
elected by popular vote and juries chosen
from among the people, as with the all-too
prevalent disposition to laxity, and concession
TO the baser elements of society. In popu-
lar government like this the people have no
right to continue in contempt of laws and
courts. Both are creatures of the people.
The people can make and unmake the one,
put up and depose the other, If
the laws are not what they should
be it is easily within the power of the
people to alter them in any degree desired. If
courts are corrupt or inefficient they may be
impeached or set aside. The people are in
excusable in resorting to extra-legal processes
in dealing with criminals


But those who are supposed to administer
law are not without responsibility and blame.
Those who interpret and administer, and those
who enforce law, in too many instances evince
disregard for it themselves that in other
countries would forfeit their Offices, did it not
send them to prison. A familiar instance may
be cited in this city, where men violate
written law with the consent or sufferance
of our police officials. Night after night all
the saloons in the city are and have been al
owed to sell liquor until II o'clock, in direct
iolation of the law that says that sale must
e closed at IL, and this not only in defiance
# the statute, but by direct understanding
with the officers sworn to execute the law.
On Sunday they are all open, again with the
consent of the same officials. In other words,
the wishes of the law-defying element are
placed above the will of the people as inscribed
in the statute book. Speaking plainly, the
police officials of indianapolis, despite their
oaths to uphold and to enforce the law, are
bringing it into well-merited contempt.
There is danger in all this laxity. If the
IL o'clock law is wrong, let it be repealed; but
until it be repealed officers Of law owe it to
the people and to the interest of society to
enforce it without alteration, or, at least not
become parties to its steady and persistent
violation.


Another source of contempt for law and its
findings is the manner in which convicted
murderers are honized before the eyes of the
world Take the instance of the brutal wife

murderer McHugh, hanged at Cincinnati yes
terday. His offense was one Of the fouIest
and most fendish that can be conceived of;
yet the very hour he is condemned to death
he becomes hero in the eyes Of women fools
and men as disreputable as himself, and main
tanned in that position by the public press and
by the swon officers of the court who have
him in custody. His every movement is re
ported with a fidelity accorded no other person
in the community. His cell is changed to
boudoir bouquets are sent to him,
nd silly women make the jail
brine In the McIugh case all these things
ave been done; the papers of yesterday de-
,oted whole columns to the subject, and to-
lay each will probably contain page or more
illustrated and recounting all the details The
sheriff helps swell the villains importance by
issuing invitations to the 'ceremony'-for by
that term is the hanging ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

plements these by oficiously and officially

to secure the election to this Office as q repre-

would be also representative of the whole

Mr.. Lodge then placed in nomination for the

Lynch OF Mississippi which nomination was
seconded by Silas B. Butcher of New York


Mr.. Drummond of Maine said that this wac

chair amid wild cneertug. the nominatian OF
Mr.. Lynch brought out much debate annon-
those taking part being Messrs. Morrow Of
California, Stewart of Pennsylvania, and
George William Curtis and Theodore Roose-
vet of New York. Morrow and Stewart op-
posed his nomination on the ground that the
National Committee had named the temporary
chairman for forty years, and it was dangerous
to make an innovation. The others contend
ed that the convention had a right to choose
its own officers If 1t desired.


When, after the roll of delegates had been
calledit was found that Lynch had been elect
cd, scene of great excitement followed. Del
egates rose in their seats, cheering, shouting
and waving hats. with the spectators Joining
IN the demonstration. The chairman then
said he had the honor of presenting as tempo
rary chairman, Hon. John r. Lynch of Missis-
sippi.


Chairman Lynch's Remarks.


Chairman Lynch in accepting the position
said:


Gentlemen Of the Conventions:


feel that ought not to say thank you
for the distinguished honor you have conferred
upon me, for l do not. Nevertheless, from
the standpoint that no patriot should fail to
respond to his country's call, and that no loyaI
member of the party should fail to comply
with demand of the !party, 1 yield with re-
luctance. 1 am prepared, and hope every
member OF this convention is prepared, to re-
I'm Fr1 h 10
mlnation to give to the candidates of this
convention 10y al and hearty support, who
ever they may be- (Cheers.) / am satisfied in
my own mind that when we go before the
people OF this country our action will be rati-
ned, because the great heart of the American
people Will never consent to have q political
party gain the ascendancy in this government
whose chief reliance is on fraudulent ballot
and violence at the polls. (Applause am
satisfied that the people of this country are
TOO loyal ever to allow man to be inaugur-
atod President whose title to that position ia
brought forth in fraud.


At the conclusion OF Mr.. Lynch's rsmarks Il
was suggested by Hon. John Martin and adopt
ed, that Hon. T. Sheard of New York and T.
W. Lee OF Pennsylvania be chosen assistant
secretaries to serve daring pendency of the
temporary organization.


The chairmen of delegations then announced
the names of persons selected to servo on the
the various committees of the convention,


Henry l.. Pierce of Massachusetts presented
the following resolution:


That the subject of revised apportionnent of
delegates to future national conventions and of a
revised apportionment of members of the national
committee, be referred to the committee on rules
and order of business with leave to report before
the balloJ for President.


Hon. W. G. Donnsn OF Iowa, presented a
memorial and petition from the National We
mems Christian Temperance Union. 1t bears
the signature of officers of the Women's Chris
tan Temperance Union in 48 States and Ter
ritories. The petition, after setting forth the
evils OF intoxlcation and the traffic in intoxi.
cants, concludes as follows:

CHICAGO, June 2.-The opening OF the con-
vention today was the occasion of an immedi
ate demonstration of the antagonistic elements
which compose it. As soon as it was nois ed
abroad that the National Committee had Sc
lected Powell Clayton of Arkansas for tempo
| rary chairman there was feeling of dissstis-
faction and disgust in many quarters Clayton
came here an Arthur man and his conversion
| to Blaine has been the occasion of some boast
| ing. This looked a little like prompt reward
for changing although he was not urged for
| the place by Mr.. Blaine's supporters on the
committee specially. Probably this would
have occasioned only remark but for the fact
that Claytons reputation is not at all savory
one and many were unwilling to commit the
| party in the present state Of public sentiment
to honoring such a man.


1t was not until last evening that the way
out of the predieament was suggested and
good part Of the night and of the morning up
to the hour of the meeting Of the convention
was spent in perfecting the plan. Up to the
last moment its success was doubtful and it
never could have succeeded nor would any
body have ventured to attempt overthrowing
the arrangement of the National Com
mite but for the strong conviction many had
that to carry it out would work injury to the
party in the campaign. 1t is not easy to un
derstand why more of the friends of Mr.
Blaine did not perceive this condition and vote
for Lynch as Phelps of New Jersey and few
others did, but as body they identified them
selves with the Claytons and were beaten
The sign of the vote as affecting Blsine's pros
poets of the nomination is variously comment
ed upon. His opponents regard it as almost
conclusive that he cannot be nominated. We,
his friends, entertain different opinion.


Mr.. Boatelle regards the vote as a surprising
indication of Mr.. Blaine's strength and thinks
he knows of 40 votes that will come to him
besides the 37S cast for Clayton. Mr.. Dingley
thinks that the Clayton episode was very un-
fortunate and that while the immediate effect
is terrible setback, it is at least only Incl
dental, and will havelittle or no influence in
the balloting for a candidate.


There are any numbers of rumors tonight
about combinations and IDEALS"" naturally
springing out of the days events but they are
imaginary. Logan will be pushed not less
strongly. 1t is settled that Harrison will be
formally presented as candidate, and the
Arthur men are of course encouraged by what
has happened.


There is, If possible, more enthusiasm than

Reasons Why ihe Convention Went Back
on the Committees Selection for Chair


man.


CHICAGO, June 3.-When Powell CLAYTON
was selected by the National committee for
temporary chair man some members of that
committee voted for him on the personal
ground that he had long been connected with
the committee as the representative from
Arkansas and without knowing that action in
volved any political meaning whatever, other
wise the contest that ensued would have been
avoided in the selection of some other men,
Der. Those responsible for bringing Clayton
forward had not calculated on the convention
overruling the action of the committee as pre-
cedents were all fer approving such nomiu-
atlons. The independents decided to make an
issue on this selection and formed a combina.
tlon with the Arthur men for that purpose.
Votes were cast largely on this issue but not
all OF them, as some Arthur men voted for
Clayton in order to sustain the committee and
some Blaine men voted for Lynch as he is
claimed to be for Blaine. Mowever the Ed
munds men are very jubilant and claim that
the neld against Blaine is strong enough to
dictate the nominee. On the other hand the
Blaine men say there are Arthur men who
will go to Blaine If they see no chance for
their favorite, and that the vote has sho w
then to be stronger than has heretofore been
conceded. That in fact there are 342 votes in
compact body. Maine voted solid for Clay

The conference at which Lynch was deter
mined on was he'd this morning The first
general demonstration was made when on the
call OF the roll Virginia was reached and the
name of Gen. Malone called Then general

name was called, and that he desired 90 cast

they decided to keep up the hght until either a

 West.

lFrom the Chicago Times.",,"

 While persons of wealth, learning and leisure in eastern cities bother their brains over the questions that interest the welfare of society, the practical citizens of littie towns on the western frontier resort to measures that settle them at once. During the past few months discussions have been going on in all the cities where medical col leges are located, in respect to getting bodies for dissection, regulating the practice of medicine, eleSa;ing the standard of doctors and diminishing the number of physicians. Many papers have been prepared on these subjects and a la. ge number of resolutions passed. Nothing practical, however. has been accomplished They manage things differently out on the border. A month or so ago an alleged doctor located in 8 small town near Denver, Cobra 10. He hung out his shinsle and it was not long before he was summoned to visit sick woman. He called on her and prescribed some medicine which the patient took Shortly afterward she died. The doctor was asked what the drug was, but he could not tell. He was also una ble to state the complaint the woman was troubled with. On being asked to show hi- diploma he admitted that he had none. The friends of the deceased held . consultation, as doctors often do, and decided to hang the unfortunate practitioner to the nearest tree, which was net far off, With the enterprise and enesgy that characterize western men, they strung up the adventurous practitioner till he was as dead as his patient. Had there been manufaotory of doctors in the vicinity the body would have been turned over to it without the formality of asking the permis- sion of the county commissioners. As there was none they allowed the bnzzards and wolves to devour it. There is an opening for courageous doctor in the place. but he must take the chances. There wRs not particle of evidence to show that the medi- cine prescribed by the quack doctor caused the woman's death. Most women are much addicted to calling doctors, and few of them are entirely happy unless they are taking medicine of some sort. For woman to die immediately after taking medicine would not be thought singular circumstance in great city where high-prictd doctors are numerous. In country where other than natural and Indian doctors are very scarce the circum- stance was regarded :As more than suspi- cious. As the practitioner was not able to produce g license to kill, duly signed by the faculty of 8 medical college and indorsed by the members of State board of health, they .strung him up without judge or jury"" after the manner of a horse-thief. This heroic treatment will have more salntary effect in regulating the practice of medicine in Cobra do than all the laws the Legislature could pass during the entire session. If like practice were generally introduced in all the States and territories the medical profession would soon cease to be crowded. If the bodies of the lynched practitioners were all turned over to the medical colleges, they would have all the material"" they wanted for purposes, Of illustration or private dis section. The people of Colorado have evi- i dsntly discovered the true way of elevating the medical profession."

 NEW YORK, Jan. 25.-At about half past six o'clock this morning selah Sprague, 8 well-to do farmer living at East Meadow, Long Island, went as usual to his barn to milk his COWS and feed his horses. He had just reached the barn when 8 tall, slim mulatto attacked him with fish-plate, used for coupling railroad tracks, and after striking him several murderous blows on the head ,~left him for dead and made his way to the house. Upon entering, he saw Mrs. .Sprague in the kitchen and struck one blow at her, and demanded her money. She told him to get it out of a drawer, and then ran scream ing from the house. Before she had gone very far the man overlook and passed her, soon getting out of sight. Some of the neighbors hearing Mrs. Sprague's cries hur- Ried to the spot and found Mir. Sprague's aI- most ifeless body lying in a pool of blood near the barn. A general alarm was spread and the farmers of Hicksyille, Hemp stead, Westbury and Farmingdale hitched up their horses and started in all directions after the perpetrator. The man was arrested and after being identified by Mr. Sprague was locked up.

 LETTER FROM HENDRICKS.

 DUBUQUE, Aug. 27-The Herald

 will publish tomorrow the follow ing letter from Governor Hendricks, recently received by q citizen of this city irl relation to an inquiry con corning rumors affecting a change in the national Democratic ticket consequent upon reports against Governor Cleveland:

 INDIANAPOLIS, Aug. 24, 1884.

 I have your letter of the 9th inst. I cannot consider with favor your suggestions of change in the national ticket. The action of the convention cannot now be recon sidered, but must stand, and 1 think it ought 10 stand. I do not agree ----s- s-y,,l II resI'ssGszgv s,lv p.os,trrv result. think the probabilities are favorable to the success of our ticket. The Cleveland sclndal will not have weig ht with the people and ought not to have weight. It is un- worthy of the national contest. Three times Governor Cleveland has stood the test of popular canvass, once for the office of mayor of hIs own city. And each time he re- ceived the endorsement of his neigh> bors by vote largely above his party strength Whatever there may have been of the scandal exists ing before that it is not just, either to him or to the people now, to revive it. Public welfare requires that he be judged by hls public record, by his capabillty and fitness for the discharge of responsible and important public duties, and not by old and exploded private scandal.

 Very respectfully yours,

 (Signed) T. A. HENDRICKS.

 BATAVIA, Jan. 30.-The Rowell trial is ap- preaching it's close To-day's proceedings opened with the examination of Asa F. Law renee, of Batavia, who testified that Rowen visited his cabinet shop on October 30, 1883, and showed sketch of a cabinet which he wanted made. When witness asked ques- tions as to the drawings made by himself Powell made reply foreign to the subject about some exhibits made by witness at the county fair, which had just then closed. The interview lasted nearly OF quite an hour. Rowell's conversation was inooherent and impressed witness as being irrational. Wit ness could not definitely remember the re- marks made by Rowell, except that he asked who drew the plans of witness house, and who occupied the house adjoining. His mind wandered great deal. Witness had never seen him before.

 The defence here rested their case. Coroner Tozier was recalled in rebuttal. He produced letters which the prosecution wanted to put in evidence to show that Lynch was in Rowell's house by invitation of MT. Rowell. The deence objected, and the court excluded the letters as reopening the case for the people, and nothing would be gained.

 Sheriff Southworth was recalled and testified to frequently seeing Rowell in iail. The prisoner had many visitors from I5 to 80 daily-and he finally asked that strangers be kept out. The defend ant was cool, and spoke only when spoken to, and did not act as though he wanted to make acquaintances. During his conhne- | ment witness saw him nearly every day. He did not see him until the first of December | He was very cool to acquaintances unti 1 December 1st after that he became more | cheerful and pleasant. and conversed freely He was supplied with five or six different 1 newspapers a day. He began to keep scraI I book the second day after he was put II 1 i4iI. It contained accounts of the tragedI 1 and comments on the case taken from the l newspapers.

NATION, I'LL, April IA.
Saturday at Ashmore the bodies of the
murdered Fleetwoods were placed side
by side in the same grave. large


crowd attended the funeral, but
there were no demonstrations. The
people now talk more moderately


about the deed, and seem to be dis


posed to let the law take its course.
THE ACCUSED.
A reporter called at the Charleston jail
and was admitted to the cell containing
Winkleback. the alleged murderer. He
had been removed clandeStinely from


Mattoon to Charleston, many Of the peo-


pie of the latter place not knowing of his


presence When found by your reporter


he wore haggard look, showing plainly
that the thoughts of the crime and the


subsequent exciting flights with the Sher-


riff had preyed upon his mind. When
talking about the matter tears came to his


eyes, showing the first signs of emotion
since his arrest. He still fears an attack
| from the mob, and no assurance that
| there is no danger can quiet him.
""Do you believe Emma Fleetwood is in
| any way connected with the crime?"" was


asked.


| He hesitated, as if not knowing what


reply to make, and finally said, ~ don't
| know in such manner as to leave the
| impression that he knew, but would not
| tell.


ssCould she do the deed?"" was next
asked.


sShe could do anything"" he replied.


'sI have seen her have some big quarrels


with her father""


| No statement of confession could be
| got from him. Any question implying his
| guilt would not be answered. He had no
| lawyer, but is shrewd enough to keep his
plans to himself. There is growing
| feeling among those who know about the


matter that there is q possibility that
| Winkleback is not the only guilty one, but
no one suspects the daughter Emma, un-


less their suspicious are based upon words
| spoken by Winkleback, There viii pc no

 Presiding Justice Stephen charged the grand jury that the person who burns instead of

 buries dead body does not commit crim- inal act unless he does it in such 8 manner

 as to amount to public nuisance. The jus

 tfce, after the fullest examination of the

 authorities, had come to the conclusion that

 cremation could not be considered even 8

 misdemeanor, and he decided that to burn

 dead body decently and inoffensively was not

 unlawful. He said that every practice which

 startles or jars upon the religious sentiments

 of the majority of the population is not for

 that reason misdemeanor at common law.

 scribed by few wealthy gentlemen inter

 ested in the well-being of the working peo-

 than four millions and half, and it has

 thirty-three estates in different parts of the

 metropolis, covering in all about twenty-four

 acres. Counting the $40 dwellings in course

 of erection, the tenements number 1854,

 containing 16,615 rooms, accommodating

 25, 900 people, and with g rent-rel amount ing to $500, ,OOO year. The excellent sani- tary and supervisory arrangements in the buildings and the improved general condition of the tenants, coupled with an unvarying dividend of five per cent, show that the enterprise has proved not only beneficial to the working classes but profitable to the originators.

 sLife in Texas"" is not very attractive to a Georgian who went there awhile ago, built a cabin in the woods, and went to work to make home for himself. He was recently charged by band of strangers with being a murderer. Being innocent he refused to confess and was dragged some distance into the woods and tied to stake. Several shots were fired at him and the shots struck close to him. This failing to frighten confession from him, he was tortured with knives and finally singed with frebrands. Daylight coming on, his tormentors hurried away, leaving him tied to the stake, with promise that he would be left there until he starved to death. Four days and nights he remained in this situation, without food or drink. He was fast becoming mad, when one night solitary man, disguissd beyond recognition, waited him and gave him water and food On the seventh night he was mysteriously set free. On regaining his home to make preparations for flight he learned that the real murderer had been caught and lynched.

 The lime manufacturers of Maine are much disturbed by the proposal to put lime on the free list, and Governor Dingley has present cd their remonstrance to the Ways and Means committee. They argue that it will destroy their business, as it will be impossi- ble to continue in competition with the Can adisn manufacturers, who employ laborsrs at from thirty to fifty per cent. less than the Americans can, and the interests involved are nearly all labor. The petition was signed by business firms without regard to party, Tep- resenting over $1 1000, 900 worth of property. Governor D1ngley, after stating the case of the lime manufacturers at length, was asked by MT. Hewitt, who said that he was a con sumer of lime, whetk-z he has eTer hSard,of any remonstraree from the consuun CTS who would be benefited by the proposed reduc tion. Mr- Dingley replied that he was not aware that any had been made, but, if the question was put as an argument, he would like to ask Mir. Hewitt, who was interested in the protection of iron, whether any remon- srtance had been heard from the consumers of iron. A hearty laugh followed this home thrust, to the great discomfture of the iron and lime consumer, and Gov ernor Dingley retired in good order."

 The evidence in the trial of Powell al Batavia, N. T., for the shooting of Lynch was all in on Wednesday. The defense labored to show that Powell was insane, and a number of witnesses were called upon to testify to this fact, many of whom were relatives and experts.

 In summing up for the defense. MT. Watson's argument was in support of the theory of insanity, and that Rowel, while in that condition, became the tool of Palmer, his partner, who waited until his mental condition had broken down before developing the greater portion of his scheme to him or supplying him with weapons.

 In his charge the judge cautioned the jury not to enter into any nasty or pas sionate discussion of the questions in- volyed. He said: ""You are to take the circumstances into consideration as to the manner in which the act was com mitted, and then, gentlemen, you are to determine according to your oaths and your judgment as to whether or not this man was laboring under Q disease of the mind and whether or not he was Tn such a condition as not to know that the shooting was wrong and unlawful on his part.

 The jury were out but short time when they returned with verdict of not guilty.

 The response wns drowned by the united shouts of three hundred voices. Men and boys waved their hats and yelled with as much enthusiasm as though they were greeting a great mill. tary hero.

 When the words ""Not guilty"" were pronounced, the Court asked upon what ground the verdict was rendered, whether self-defense or insanity, and the foreman said upon the ground of self-defense, and the Court immediately discharged the prisoner, saying that there was no further reason for holding him."

 Tale Tracks - Excitement Running

 High In Branford-TaIk Of LyneIlIng

 the CuIprit.

 BRANFoRD, Oct. s.-Never before has the town of Branford known such excitement as exists here now over the cowardly and ter rible assault on Dr. Zink on Tuesday night, an account of which appeared in your col umns yesterday. No other subject is talked

 about. Even politics have for the moment lost their interest. The town is raised to the fever height. Although Dr. Zink had many

 enemies, he is now given universal sympa-

 thy. Threats of lynching the man Doherty,

 who is suspected of the murderous assault,

 have been made during the day, but things

 have calmed down somewhat this evening

 and excited individuals are getting cooler.

 But there is an unusually deep feeling of in

 dignation at the cowardly manner in which

 Dr. Zink's assailant stole into the room where

 he was sleeping with his head leaning on the

 table before him, whereon lay his only par

 tially eaten supper, and dealt him terrible

 blows on the head with an axe. It is cer-

 tainly one of the worst crimes that have ever

 been perpetrated in this State, and there is

 no punishment too severe for the ruffian who

 did it.

 Dr. Zink has remained conscious nearly all

 the time and has made some remarks to his

 affrighted wife and little boy and girl. He

 certainly shows wonderful power and this

 afternoon his physicians have expressed some

 hopes for his recovery When the coach

 man, Dave Beaudet, opened the door and T,, IL d. blood exclaiming, My God! somebody has

 struck me, he was terribly frightened and soon called the neighbors. J. s. Moore, who lives next door, was the first to arrive, though J. Hutchinson, w. T. Robinson, Sheriff Nettleton and Town Clerk Steadman camo immediately. Drs. Gaylord and Ken ny were sent for, and Sheriff Nettleton tele- phoned about one o'clock to Coroner Boil man at New Haven. The doctors examina- ton showed hole in the left occipital bone and two scalp wounds of some leng th. The scalp was badly lacerated. The skull was fractured. A number of pieces of bone were taken out.

 When Coroner BoIlman arrived he with Deputy Sheriff Nettleton carefully examined the premises and found in the sand foot prints of bare feet which pointed towards and from the house. Doherty's house was visited at 4 o'clock and he was taken into GUS tody and brought to Zink's house, where it was found that the impressions made by his bare feet tallied with those in the sand. Tracks were also found leading from Zink's house across the meadows to the railroad track, where from that point in the direc- tion of. Doherty's house are prints of boots into which Doherty's nicely fit. The footprints were found to be 1015 inches in length and were marked by peculiarity, the impress on made by the big toe being ir- 71aI 111ro 151171 +I,af fOO4 Do he15y is lame and cannot take very long steps. All these peculiarities tallied with the footprints in the sand, they being only about twenty inches apart.

 Doherty says he left the saloon he was in at 10:30 o'clock, and went directly home His wife, before leaning of her husbands statement, said it was 1:45 o'clock when he came in. The saloon keeper says he closed up about 10 o'clock. He had two drinks of whiskey there, and told Grand | Juror Van Sands confdentially that l E'Dr Zink would not be driving his span | around three months from now"" He also | made similar statement to John Donovan I Edward Flaherty was talking with him 8 few moments after he came out of the saloon, \ when he started for home in an opposite di-

 rection from the doctors house.

 ! Peter Coffee, of Stony Creek, and John l Linsky, of Guilford, were also under sus- picion, but they have accounted for their whereabouts satisfactorily.

 1 Dr. Zink's two dogs were loose and were probably away at the time the assault was l committed. If Doherty committed it he

 could have passed dow the railroad track, passed up through 8 vacant lot and looked

 in the window, sew the doctor sleeping and | improved his opportunity.

 | Doherty is an ill-looking Irishman and

 has been considered by lLany tough cus- toner. He is forty-five years old, has red struggling beard and long matted hair, and drinks heavily at times. He is not a man to

 forget an injury and he thought himself

 much injured by Justice Zink, who fined | him on Friday for assault and drunkenness. l Dr. Gaylord said he was satisfied that the blows were delivered with an axe, and

 search was made for such an implement on I the doctors premises. From the hostler it

 was learned that dull axe usually lay at the back door. It was found and upon it were | two hairs which corresponded in color with l those on the victims head. Blood stains were also found upon the handle. The hostler says he went to bed before the doctor

 returned. He was first awakened by sound

 as if the house was shaking. He jumped ] out of bed and looked out the window, and seeing nothing he returned."

Story of the champion - of the Sd Va. Cay.-A


Sharpsh0oter Who Did Deadly Work.",,"To THE EDITOR: According to the old
adage, Honor to whom honor is DUE"" seeing
so many stirring sketches about some of the
leading men OF our army, allow me to intro
duce to you private, who for valor is the
vassal of none, who enlisted when about 16
years old, and served through the war, and
who refused furlough to go home to see his
friends, but remained at the post of duty. The
subject of oar sketch was John L. McMurray,
of Go. ID, Sd Va. Cav, or, as he was called,
Champion"" name given him by his officers
for his grit and daring. Although young and
small, he was never known to shrink from a
social combat or open field fight, and was consid-
cred the best marksman in the whole command.
Whenever there was any sharpshooting to be
done the Champion was always assigned
that duty. AT the battle of Dry Creek, ON Aug.
g. when the rebel artillery was playing havoc
with ours, the Champion was ordered TO select
two or three men and pick off the artillery
men. He advanced, with two others, to a frame
house, where he could get range from the upper
story through an end window, posting the
other men at the side windows to pick of Off
GERS. His fire was so effective that the rebels
turned the artillery on the house, using solid
shots and finally shells, firing the house, when
he was forced out leaving his two comrades
weltering in their blood, the enemy's line hav-
ing advanced to within 75 yards of the house.
He threw himself on the ground from one of
the lower windows and feigned himself shot,
and crawled about so yards to rail fence,
VIXEN he leaped over it and began his work
again. Space fails me to give an authentic ac-
count of his services. / have seen him kill a
quail So yards, sheep 500 yards, and he has
driven center 800 yards. He was the most eff
fective marksman / knew in the army; and
| have heard his officers say that in case of q
night attack they would rather have him on a
! post of danger than any man in the command,
la
tried it frequently, and always failed. Many a
man has been seen to fall by his unerring aim.
At the fight near Big Spring, Shenandoah Val
| ley, he was lying ON a little high knob picking
off officers, when a rebel sharpshooter fired at
| him, the ball striking before him, plowing up
| the dirt in his face and lodging in his jacket.
His officers ordered him taken back, (they
thought he was killed. when he said, Not by a
| id sight"" and his next shot brought the rebel
/ officer out of his saddle. On the retreat from
Lynchburg, when our artillery was captured at
! Mason's Gap, he and 20 others dashed in On the
| rebels hand-to-hand, when 18 of 81 were left
| on the field. He brought out a wounded com
| rade with him, be himself being wounded. He


was creased las he called it, three times while
| in the army, as he considered nothing short
of shattered leg or arm or ball through the


body, was wound. / saw him at the surprise


at Piney Creek shoot three men, and was the
! only man who fired a gun, and came near being


captured, his horse being shot.


He was a good scholar, and would clerk in


different departments during the Winter, but


whenever the army began moving you could
not keep him in the cerkship. He was offered
| promotion on many occasions, but utterly re-


fused to accept any honors saying he enlisted


for high private"" in the ""rear rank"" and


intended to hold his position. He was nearly


killed in the battle of Moorfeld, Va, il

Coal Pits-Theory Of the Explosion.


LYNcHBuRG, Va, April t6.--As many as
fifty dead bodies had been oxhumed from the
Pocahontas coal pits UP to yesterday, and
twenty-six more have been reached and will
be brought out to-day. Nearly all Of them
were badly, and some fcarfully, mutilated
oven beyond the recognition Of their best
friends. Twonty-eight bodies were found in
the fan entry, all together, and the explana-
tion of so many being in one heap Is made by
miner who escaped at the time Of. the acci-
dent. He says few minutes before the ex
plosion tho air in the interior became so
foul and offensive that these men with him
self were compelled TO seek some fresh dir,
and when they reached the aforesaid entry
tho current from the fan was so strong and
refreshing that all of them except himself
proposed to lie down to rest awhile, and then
return to their work, while he went on and
gained the outside in safety just few min
utes before the explosion which killed all of
his companions


Tho vein of coal, which is higher than the
surrounding coal fields, has evidently been
thrown UP by some mighty upheayal, and the
opinion of Capt. j. A. Welch, skillful
prospector and mining engineer, Is that
when the break in nature took place largo
cavity was formed which, having become
full of gas and being blasted into by the
miners, produced the terrific explosion, with
all of its frightful consequences. If the theory
is correct Capt. Welch thinks there need be
no fear of any other explosions, as the gas
has most probably found full vent


OF the bodies recovered yesterday sixteen
were identified. These were Emil Goodman,

Ballard proceeded to the corner OF South

by the Marshal and a policeman named
George Daniels. They started to the VII
lage prison, but had gone but few steps
when Ballard jerked his right hand loose,
/ produced a revolver, and shot the Mar
shal, the bullet passing through his right
.eye into his brain. An immense crowd
soon gathered, and it required the exer-
ton of the officers to keep the crowd
from lynching the murderer. and as he
was being taken down street some. one
cut him in the side making quite large
wound. He was lodged in jail, where he
now is. The murdered officer was an old

twelve Years, and was considered one OF
the very best officers in this part of the

Shortly after she went to Mrs. Lynch's store and purchased S8,00O worth of diamond jewelry on time. A week later she purchased s12,0O0 worth more on time. She remained at the hotel for some weeks, running up a bill of $500, when her conduct aroused suspicion and she suddenly left and took up her resi- dence in Cambridge, Mass.

prove that Rugg, the mulatto who committed
the Sprague assault, also murdered the Maybees
and was the perpetrator of the Townsend out


rage. 1t may be that this is true, but if there is
any one lesson borne in upon the public by the
recent Lon5 Island crimes, it is the necessity of
proceeding very cautiously toward conclusions
in such matters. This is at least the third


person who has been charged with one or all OF
these crimes, and the police were for a time
quite confident that they had got at the bottom
facts in both the other cases. Simon Rappelyea,
it will be remembered, was recognized by Mrs.
Townsend as the man to whom she had opened
the door. She was sure of his identity and
with such evidence many Western community
would have thought itself justified in lynching


the accused. Yet it is now generally concluded
that Simon Rappelyca is innocent, and that
Mrs. Townsend was mistaken, notwithstanding
her confidence in her own belief. Then came
Edmund Tappan, and made a confession which
does not seem to have been entirely voluntary,
though there is strong reason for suspectlng
that hc is an cpileptic maniac, and might have
coined the whole narrative out Of his own dis
cased Imagination. He, however, after having


been iudic ously ""workod by detectives,
amateur and professional. accused his brother
John of having committed the Maybee murders,
and alleged that he himself had only shared the
plander. The accusation of John Iappm
evidently staggered his neighbors, for he was
not the kind of man they would have suspected


And the patent weakness of Edmund Tappan's
intellect became more conspicuous the more
closely he was examined. 1t was seOn thought
that he must be the actual murderer and that
his brother had nothing TO do with it. After
little, however, some shrcwd observers began TO
doubt whether Edmund had not been melted to
make q false statement by detectives who were
too eager for the reward, or by persons who
were too impatient TO solve the mystery. Then
came the attack on the Spragucs, and this time
the criminal was caught, almost red-handed,
and now it is intimated that he alone COM
mittcd all these crimes. Before we adopt this
theory It Is we'll to note the significant fact that
Rugg, after making IN alleged statement or
confession, is said to have had three epilcptic


fits in quick succession. Now, while it is true
that epileptic fits may sometimes be caused by
excessive mental anxiety, ii is not less true that
when they occur there is apt to be mental
deterioration and there may be actual insanity


The most recent treatise on psychological
medicine observes: at is well known among
specialists in insanity that the epileptiform
""neuross often exists for long time in an un-
developed or masked form, and that this
L"" ""neurosis is, moreover connected with both
""hOmicidal and suicidal mania"" The epilephc
maniac may be for several days or weeks
preceding the paroxy SINS in dazed or half
unconscious state, and may during that cOndi
ton do acts of which he is but partially conscious.
We do not say that this was the case with Rugg.
We only call attention to the medical pOssibili-
ties of a case in which the occurrence of
epileptic fits is already alleged.


Rugg may prove to be the man who has COM
mitted all the recent Long Island crimes, but in
view of the mistakes already committed, and Ill
view Of the existence OF a doubt as to his mental
condition, it is obvious that his own statements
ought to be received with extreme caution, and
that reliance should be placed mainly upon such
external and Independent evidence as may be
gathered. The Tappan episode has showed
how plausible and connected a story may be in-
vented by any one who has read the published
accounts of notorious crime, and when an
accused person is surrounded by eager detectives,
ready with suggestions and leading questions,
weak mind may without much difficulty be
induced to say what is not true. The people of
Long Island no doubt see by this time that the
discovery of these crimes is not the simple
matter it may have first appeared. When the
vagares of insanity have to be taken into
account, together with the selfish motives of
persons hungry for the rewards there is danger
that innocent men may be falsely accused, and
that imbeciles may be invegled into sacrificing
themselves under the influence of delusion
And because the necessity for caution and
patience has been so strkingly emphasized by :
the early history of these cases, we have no
doubt that the proceedings in regard to Rugg
will be characterized by the requisite prudence,
and that the medical aspect of his case, above |
all, viii not be overlooked

 ment, and more specially in that section west of the R cky M Oun- tains, when criminals, irre9pec- tive of grade, were summarIly dealt with; Judge Lynch was the principal judiciary during those stirring times. and from his bench in the shade of an um- brageous tree, delivered prompt judgments from which there was no appeal. Considering the then lawIess cOnditiOH of the country, crime. particularly that of murder, was jess prevalent than now. A premeditated, !, q deliberate taken of human life was varitv. Horse stealing and his sh way-sOliciting were the principal transgressiOns and were invariably punished by death. The advancement of the country toward higher and more civili- zed plane has but redouDded to the advantage of the criminal.

 The Murderer.

 WHEELING, May 11.-A bloody double murder growing out of love affair was com o'clock yesterday morning. Lawrence Speller, farmer near the town, had hand some stepdaughter whom he desired to mar ry. He refused her hand to Edward Taylor, a neighbor, and on Friday night they eloped and went to Petersburg. Arming himself Spiller pursued, but was too late to prevent the marriage. On his arrival they had re- tired for the night at the house of a friend named Williamson. Spiller forced his way into the room, and as the bridegroom rose in bed shot him through the heart. The bride shrieked for help and Spelter attacked her with the butt of the revolver, inAictine wounds which will prove fatal Without molestation he mounted his horse and left the town. An alarm called out an armed posse of ten men, who followed and arrested Spelter at his house. For fear of lynchipg he was not brought in until last night, and at last accounts was safe in jail. There is much excitement and the jail is heavily guarded.

 Yesterday afternoon dispute arose be- tween Warren Hotchkiss, of Westville, and ex-Polieeman Michael Doherty which finally culminated in a shooting afray. It seems that Doherty had met Hotchkiss previous to the shooting and accused him of assisting in the election of Sheriff Gates in order to keep Jailer Stevens in his position. Later on the parties met on Crown street, when another war of words occurred and during the melee pistol was discharged. A crowd gathered and MT. Hotchkiss sought refuge in Gibson Halls Crown street meat market, followed by an infuriated mob who cried, Lynch him, lynch him.' Special Constable Harvey Dorman and two or three other Specials"" were soon at the scene of disturbance and one or two regulars"" arrived soon after. The maddened crowd rushed toward the meat'market with such force that the show window was partially demolished and for few moments riot seemed imminent. The officers at last restored quiet and MT. Hotchkiss was taken to the station house where he was charged with assault with intent to kill and also with drunkenness. A small seven shooter was found on MT. Hotchkiss person when he was searched, one chamber of which had been discharged. Doherty also went to the police office and made complaint against Hotchkiss and then went to his home. A physician was called and on examination he found that MT. Doherty had been shot in the feshy part of the right leg. The doctor extracted the bullet and sent word to the police office that MT. Doherty would not be able to appear in court this morning. MT. Hotehkiss was kept in the lookup until 10:30 o'clock last evening, when bonds in the sum of $500 were furnished for his appearance in court this"

THE MAYoR's ADDRESS.


Gentlemen of the Board of Adermen:


We have been elected to manage the muni-
cipal affairs of the city for the ensuing year.
and have accepted the important responsible
ity and taken-the solemn obligation to dis
charge faithfully the several trusts committed
to our care. l sincerely hope that each one
Of US may feel this responsibility, and that
the controlling motive in all our acts may be
the interests of the city and the welfare of
the citizens. Let US ignore party strife and
act independently and impartially. Let US
in performing our duties not feel that we are
beholden to any political party, but that we
are pledged to the faithful administration of the
laws, and to such measures will promote
the prosperity of the city. In entering upon
the duties of my Office feel additional con-
fidence from the fact that | have associated
with me gentlemen on whose integrity and
business capacity can implicitly rely; gen.
tlemen who am sure will give to the affairs
of the city the same attention and care that
they would z i've to their own business. 1t
belongs TO you to elect the subordinate Off
GERS. / trust that you will act in harmony
and with due deliberation, and select men in
whom the citizens have confidence; men of
good judgment, who will be faithful and en-
ergetic. Nor is your duty in this matter at
an end when you have elected your officers
1t belongs to you as well as to me to see that
in all things they execute the laws, and carry
out your measures. Shonld they not
do so, you ought without hesitation
to remove them and elect others in
their places. No administration, however
good its measures, can be successful unless
the subordinate offices are held by men eff
cient and conscientiously deter mined to do
their duty.


One of the mcst important questions for
your consideration Is the state of our fnan-
ces You will agree with me that the debt
is larger than it ought to be, and that it is
time that steps were taken gradually to re-
duce II do not recommend to you reduc-
tions in your appropriations which will in any
way impair the efficiency of the several de-
partments. Appropriate freely wherever the
prosperity and welfare OF the city demand it.
1t is however. a wise economy for city so
heavily in debt as we are, to see that its re-
sources are not exhausted where necessity
does not require it. If we are interested
in the future of our city we ought
gradually but surely to reduce our debt and
80 our rate of taxation. Until there is such
reduction we can not expect cur population
to increase, or capital to be brought within
our limits. When once the rate of taxation
reaches a low figure, then We may look to
see our numbers increase and manufactures
to spring up in our midst. Bonds to the
amount of $1,000 become due this year. Let
us pay this amount and set aside the sum of
at least $4,000 toward paying the indebted
ness which natures in 1887. The auditors
report which is before you shows you the ex-
act state of affairs.


The city is fortunate in having among its
resources an immense water power, which is,
to a limited extent, utilized. This property
has passed into the hands of the Edwards
Mans featuring Company. corporation
which has abundant capital and which. we
are assured, intends to further increase the
capacity of the present mills and to build
new one The new one will probably be built
this year The company is composed of men
who look sharply after their business, and we
may be sure that they will make further use
of our water power,if they can do so advant
ageously. Let us be in favor Of just and
liberal policy toward them. The citizens
have established a basis on which they are to
be taxed, and have exempted them from tax
alton on any improvements during
period of ten years. 1t is to be

them will be followed by prompt
action on their part, and that we may realize
in the near future what we have been antici-
psting so many years. But it is not to this
corporation alone that we should be liberal.
There are many other industries within the
city which are equally deserving of our care
full consideration. Let us hold out induce
ments to capitalists to establish msnufsc-
tories which will bring among US skilled me-
chanics and workmen who will become
useful citizens, and take an interest In our
affairs.


The temperance question is one in which
all good minded citizens should be interested.
The liquor traffic has been on the increase in
our city, in violation of all laws and notwith-
standing the most energetic exertions of our
temperance organizations. l can not too

not very largely attended, was most en-
joyabIe one. Master Hally Clayton read
boys story called ""Going to School,""
and the boys who have older grown
seemed to enjoy it quite as much as the
younger members. The old romance of
Pyramus and Thisby retold in Saxe's
inimitable humorous style, was read by
the President, Mr.. Henry Clayton. This
story of the love and fate of a Babalonish
youth and maid is very sad indeed
sadder than that of Romeo and Juliet,
But the manner is 50 irresistably funny
that you laugh in spite of yourself, even
at the tragic death scene. Mr.. CLAYTON
introduced his subject by few remarks,
both explanatory and commentatory,
which we think good plan. The atten-
ton of the audience is gained at once
and lively interest manifested in that
which is to follow, while the mere an
nouncement of a title, which ofttiInes is
not heard half over the room, leaves one
in doubt as to the subject till sometimes





most pleasing as we'll as instructive efforts
with which the society has been favored
in the way Of original papers was an ESSAY
by Rev. Mr.. Stengle, styled ""Chinese
Peculiarities.' The points of difference
between the Chinaman and the American
are as numerous as they are ludicrous.
The Rev. gentleman said that one pecu-
liarity with the Chinese women is. that
they ""wear the pants,'' which, it is said
by some, is not altogether different from
the practice Of some American women.
We hope that, at some meeting in the
future, the author may be induced TO read
his paper to larger audience when more
may share the enjoyment. Several mem
bers who were appointed to participate in
the exercises were absent on account
of sickness. Thus the exercises were
brief, but making up in quality the lack
in quantity. In the music line Miss Nav

voice we are always eager to hear, sang 2

His Arrsst and Experience How he
Came to Los Angeles. and Where
he was Going.",,"


His Arrest and Experimentation he
Came to Los Angeles. and where


he Was Going.
A full account Of the arrest Of Billy
Mcdowell at San Pedro, by Deputy
Sheriff Geo. E. Gard, appeared in the
HERALp yesterday. and also the fact that
he had taken poison. From Deputy
Sheriff Gard we learn that Mcdowell
| told him that when he saw Gard arrive
at San Pedro he knew that he could not
get away, and took a heavy dose Of
strychnine and morphine and went to
bed. He had intended to 60 on the ship
King Cendric for British Columbia, but
the discovery Of his identity by Mr.. F.
Burkle, and the prompt arrival Of officer
Gard, prevented his plans from being
carried out. When Gard went 10 the
door Of Mcdowell, at his boarding
house, he found the door fastened on
the inside. He then waited awhile to
see II he could get out any other way.
and after time, finding no person
moved from the room, he climbed up to
the rear window in noiseIess manner,
softly pried up the sash, pushed back
| the curtain and saw Mcdowell in bed.
His face was but partially exposed, and
his hair had been dyed and his mustache |
cut of, SO that he appeared to great dis
advantage to the officer, but his hands
were exposed and Deputy Gard saw that
they were like the freckled hands Of Nc
Dowell. So with . sudden effort be
raised the window, sprang into the room,
plunged his hand under McDowell's pill
low and snatched out his revolver before
be had become sufficiently aroused from
the stupor that was stealing over him to
defend himself.
Mcdowell told Deputy Gard that he
saw him arrive, and then went to his
room and locked the door. He then
took poison prepared for him in San
Bernardino, consisting Of morphine and
strychnine, but took, apparently, too
large : dose for immediate death.
While Gard was speaking to the pris-
oner, who had risen up, the latter point
ed out Of the window to man
who was hurrying away around the
bluff, and said: 'sThere goes my
companion, Sayer. who came out Of jail
with me-"" But Mr.. Gard could not
leave his prisoner to chase the fugitive,
Sayer, and 20 he wandered off.
Mcdowell states that he had nothing
to do with the fire at San Bernardino at
the time Of his arrest, but that they
escaped after the ERE, and went to a
house Of prostitution, kept by Mrs. Jack
son, where they stayed all night, and
got some money, . revolver and the poi
son. The next night they started out.
and were for two days and nights on the
Cucamonga plains without food or shell
ter. They then went to Pomona, where
they were not recognized, and stayed
one night, and then footed It to Los An
geles, arriving here on Sunday night
about midnight. After rest here they
started for San Pedro on foot, avoiding
the beaten line Of travel, and arrived At
| Mr.. Dunn's boarding house on Tuesday
night, to await the sailing Of the ship
Cendric, t. take them to British Colum-
bia. Here It was that Mr.. Burkle rec
ognizsd Mcdowell and notified Deputy
Sheriff Skelton, and he notified the
Sherifrs Office in this city, when Deputy
Sheriff Gard went down and bagged the
game, as has been stated.


After the capture of Mcdowell, Gard
autographed Sheriff Currier, and he went
to San Pedro by the afternoon train to
assist In the business, which was at that
time very interesting. Mcdowell was
in . terrible state. The poison was
getting in Its terrible work, and it re


quirsd two men to hold him and prevent
him from doing great harm to himself
or anything about him. During all the
night the suffering Of Mcdowell was
terrible. but BY the assiduous attention
Of DR.. Briefly and vigorous use Of the
stomach pump the prisoner was 20 far
relieved that he Va placed on mat
trsss and brought on the afternoon train
to Los Angeles. Whom he arrived in
the city large crowd was gathered in
front Of the iail to gst sight of the vii.
lain who had murdered dsfenseless wo-
man and then attempted to murder him
self. To avoid the crowd and to prevent
an attempt to lynch Mcdowell by the
father Of the murderer's victim and his
friends, he was driven to the rear Of the
| jail and carried to cell, being unable
to walk on account Of prostration from
the effect Of the poison.


Doctor Briefly, who came up with the
prisoner, and has taken great pains to
preserve him for the gallows, called in
DR.. J. Harmon as associate adviser to at
tend to the case of the prisoner. Mr..
Gard describes tho sufferings of McDow-
ell during Thursday night a. terrible
in the extreme. 1t is likely that il the
prisoner had known that the sufferings
from poison were 80 great he would have
preferred hanging instead, which pro-
duces only short and not over painful
death. Mcdowell says that he intsndsd
to shoot any party that came to arrest
him, but when he saw Deputy Gard In
the street he know it was all up with
him, and rather than take chance at
shooting with Major Gard, he locked his
door and took poison. and his confeder-
ats took walk. There appears to be
I no special interest In Sayer, his com
| ipanien. He had served his sentence
nearly out. in jail 1t Saa Bernardino.

 LITTLE ROCK, May 16-Howard county few months ago was the scene of 8 murder ous negro riot, for which one man has been hanged, two are under death sentence and thirty are serving terms in the penitentiary- It is now the scene of one of the most dia- bolical butcheries on record. A peddler travelling through the country stopped over night with man by the name of Pope and was murdered in bed and his body burned to conceal the crime. The sale of the ped dler's horse was the first clue to his fate and finally led to the arrest of his three murder CTS, one of whom made full confession The peddler's body was thoroughly consumed, only few teeth and large bone or two es- caping destruction. Yesterday as soon as the heinous offense became known the excite ment grew intense and the people wrested the iends from the officer and hanged all three of them to trees near the scene."

Peter Macdonald Returns From the Mines
With Good News-He Sells
CLAIM to Sergt Lynch


for $3.50.",,"From Fridays Daily.
Peter Macdonald returned from the
Little Rockies last evening with further
confirmation Of the good news already
brought He had located claim IN
Little Rocky gulch, and being unex-
perienced in mining he effected sale
of his claim to Sergt. Peter Lynch OF
Fort Assinaboine for three hundred and
fifty dollars. This is the first sale OF
any property in that locality. Peter
thinks he has done well.


Our reporter called upon him at his res
idence, eliciting the following informa-
ton, which fully confirms all that has
been said regarding the mines. he
states that three men with rocker on
claim one above discovery, IN Little
Rocky gulch, are taking out daily from
fifteen to twenty-five dollars, and thinks
the amount will be increased when they
get fairly at work. All the prospects
thus far are of the most encouraging
character and the miners are perfect
~ satisfied.


Bob Main and Charlie Smith are re-
ported taking out daily, with sluices,
from forty to one hundred and five dol
lars, the latter being the largest amount
vet taken Main and Smith have had
but little experience in mining. Tucker
claims to have worked the tailings OF
their sluices and panned out five dol
lars which they had allowed to escape.
Pete had to take fuckers word for this
story All the Fort Benton people who
have thus far paid the mines visit have
been fortunate in securing good claims.


Nolan arrived at the camp the day be-
fore Macdonald left with a load OF lum-
ber for sluices.


The latest stampede i'll that section
was to Peoples creek where good pros
poets have been found. Mr.. Macdonald
like all the others who have returned IS
enthusiastic over the camp and is of
opinion that it will develop still greater
richness. He will return in few days
prepared to stay.


H. C. Foster, R. Osman, John j.
Murphy and Martin Sheridan left yes

Gathered Along the Booming Missouri
by the Scrlbes Of. the


River Press.",From Wednesdays Daily.,"front of town about 10 o'clock yesterday
morning. This good news soon spread
around, and in a few minutes the side
walk on Front street was crowded with
a smiling throng, who were assured that
all danger was past now that the gorge
was going out. The crowd was soon
disappointed, however, as the floating
masses of ice began to move slower and
slower, and at about half-past ten came
to deadlock again By that time the
upper end of the gorge had moved down
from the end of Roosevelt's island to the
upper ferry boat landing.


The ice field was closely watched all
day long by the interested spectators,
and an onward movement was detected
several times but not enough to make a
decided difference in the position Of the
lam. At seven o'clock last evening,
however, the great body of ice started
down stream more rapidly, and at ten
O'Clock but little of it was left. Before
this issue Of the RIVER PRESS is laid be-
fore its readers the center Of the stream
will be clear of ice, and the great cakes
along the sides will be the only remind
ers, so far as the river is concerned, OF
the gorge that threatened disaster to the
town.

put to since the white men first came

it establishes the fact beyond doubt that
the city. although in valley, is as safe
from the fury Of the floods as if built on
the highest adjacent plateau. There are
few, if any, valleys along the Big Muddy

C.E. Conrad and others made trip
Tuesday forenoon to the lower end OF
the ice gorge to ascertain the feasibility
of blasting out the head of the gorge.
They found the jam to be on the Shon-
kin bar. Here it seems the rush Of ice
from up the river had been pushed right
on top of the sheet ice, forming solid
mass from the bed of the river about ten
feet in height The pressing water,
finding no vent in the channel Of the
river, had run over the bank on the
Fort Benton side Of the river, and was
cutting channel for itself through Nor
gans ranch If the ice had held in the
river long enough the channel might
have been completely changed, thus
shutting out that dread Of steamboat
men-the Shonkin bar.


1T was considered feasible to start the
ice lam in the old channel by blasting
out the lower point. When the party
returned to town arrangements were at
once made to send out party of men to
carry out this project Of starting the
gorge.


A party consisting Of E. Ingersoll,
H. J. Wackerlin, Mike Lynch, and
others, started for the lower end Of the
gorge yesterday, well fixed with picks,
shovels, and 100 pounds of giant powder,
to break open the ice jam. Ed. Lewis
returned from there at dark last night,
and several shots had been fired off be-
fore he left. One of these sent blocks OF
ice 100 feet in the air, and brought forth
quite rush Of water. The charges are
being put where they will do the most
good, right in the face Of the jam, which
stands about ten feet high. This is about
half mile below the mouth OF the
Shonkin, and on the same side OF the
Missouri. s,


The party went well supplied with
grub and blankets to stay over night.
Lewis says they will break the gorge
sure this morning, and probably did SO
last night, after he left, as the blasting
could be heard as he came into town.

All but 0 very few in the gum shoe rooms quilted work about o'clock, and the foreman in the arc tic room told the girls that unless they wanted to work with the windows down at the bot tom they could go out.

A committee, of which Miss Celia Good and Miss Annie Lynch were the spokes- women, were sent to hold a consultation with Superintendent Elliott and Clarence Ames, the foreman of the gum shoe room. The crowd of industrious operatives waited impatiently until the consultation was over. Then it was ascertained that anyone who desired to ge to work could do so and they could have the windows opened. As far as the future action of the company in refer ence to the windows was concerned nothing satisfactory could be learned by the com mittee. The operatives then determined not to go to work as they would not have time to finish their work, and departed for their homes with the understanding that they are to meet this morning, and if they are then allowed to have the windows open they will go to work. Otherwise, if the weather continues as it has for the past week, they will remain out. Several other operators have been thrown. out of work by the action of the girls, partic- ularly the finishers and the 3arnishers.

IN T. Herald.l


The SHOWS of last winter had not vet
melted upon the plains of Poland and
everybody In Warsaw was still wearing
rubber boots and watching the thermome-
ter, when Antoni Won Ziolkowski and Cath
crime Dali met. He was blithe opponent
of the Russian Gar, and she was blue
eyed maiden with the usual assortment Of
patriotic sentiments, which, according to
Miss Porter, the novelist, all Polish ladies
possess.


For the pair not to have fallen in love
under these circumstance would have been
contrary to all the precedents of modern
light literature and accordingly they soon
progressed so far that the size of the we'd
ding ring was discussed. The inevitable
obstacle arose in the shape of an aunt with
whom Catherine lived. This lady had an
unreasonable objection to son-in law who
was constantly followed by detectives, and
who might at any time take a trip TO ST.
IBERIA without waiting to buy a return tick
ct, and she therefore sternly opposed the
match. Catherine wept and Ziolkowshi
was very near kicking one of the detectives,
which presumably would have sent him up
the Vistula for ten days. This impulse
was however soon conquered, aud an elab-
crate scheme of elopement was prepared.
The aunt, however, baffied IL by selling her
property and starting with the fearful
Catherine for America. Ziolkowsk at once
ceased TO conspire against the Czar and
started for America.


SO did detectives, who wanted TO bring
him back. as they preferred to have him
stay a. home. where they knew just what
be was doing. The procession glided
through Prussia In true opera bouffe style
--Ziolkowski always arriving at a town
just five minutes after the aunt and Cath
crime had departed, and the detectives al
ways coming In tsn minutes later, only to
find that ziOlkowsh had also gone on.
When he reached Bremen he saw the
steamer which bore the aunt and Catherine

 ",,"HOUSE Mir. Payson, of Illinois, called up the bill to prevent the unlawful occupancy of the public lands, which was discussed, amended and passed.

 The House then resumed consideration of the bill declaring forfeited the lands granted to the Oregon Central railroad, which came up as unfinished business. MT. Cobb, of Indiana, took the floor and admitted that in his controversy with MT. George, of Oregon, when the bill was last up he was mistaken and that there were as stated by MT. George two roads of the same name.

 Messrs Cobb of Indiana, Lowe of Delaware, and Weller of Iowa, advocated the bill. and Messrs. Van Eaton of Mississippi end Broad head of Missouri opposed the forfeiture of the earned portions of the land.

 MT. Payson closed the debate in support of'the bill. In the course of his speech there was much confusion as the dispatches from Chicago came in and the confusion culmina- ted when the report of Lynch's election as temporary chairman was received.

 MT. Hatch, of Missouri, insisted upon or der being preserved and suggested that the Speaker call the sergeant at-arms to his as- sistance.

 MT. Payson said he appreciated the curios- ity to know what was going on at Chicago and he would battle against the waves A friend he said suggested to him that if he would state to the House that the agony was over at Chicago and that MT. Lynch was elected temporary chairman quiet would be restored.

 The announcement had the desired effect and the confusion at once subsided

 Mir. Payson at the conclusion of his re- marks demanded the previous question, which was ordered. An amendment was adopted excepting from forfeiture the right of way and necessary land for the operations of the road already built

 MT. Oates offered g substitute for forfeit ing only lands on unLuilt portions of the line (from Forest Grove to Astoria). The substitute was rejected.

 tOn-Scenes in and About the Hall

 During the First Days Proceedings.

 CHICAGO, Juns 3.-When the delegates and visitors filed into the Exposition building to- day they were surprised at the grandly beau tiful effects in decorations of the interior of the building. The delegates sit on the main floor in sections carefully guarded and facing the presiding officer; just back of them sit the alternates, who are fenced out from their colleagues by railing. highly ornamsnted picket fence keeps the favored spectators from the slternates. The band stand is at the center of the hall in the south gallery. Visitors caR locate delegation by banners of blue silk with the name of the State in white. which hang from poles at the ends of the rows of seats given to the delegates. On the broad surface in the rear end of the hall. be- tween the south gallery and sounding board, an immense flag roseate has been placed, just in the rear of the band stand, and tive immense United States flags are on each side Banners decorate the front of the galleries below the south dividing fence. At the end of the speakers desk on the gallery front are portraits of Washington and Lin- coin. The enthusiasm Of the patriot is worked up by grand array of stars and while tender remembrsnces of the dead Presi- dent are recalled by large portrait of James A. Garfield in front of the speakers deAk. All this decoration was per- formed under the supervision of Frank E. Foster, of Cincinnati. Never in years gone by has such taste been displayed in conven- ton hall. A Chicago frm have manufactured a handsome gavel to be presented to the chairman of the convention; it is trimmed it contains piece of wood from Maine, yell low pine from Georgia, the quercus virens from Texas and Louisiana, the sequois Rigantes from California, white cedar from Alaska, oak and yew from Oregon, maple and ash from Washington territory, and specimens from every State and territory in the Union. The handleGDf it is made of a piece of white oak from Connecticut bona fide piece of the old Charter oak. The desk

 

 vention four years ago by Senator Hoar as chairman, is used on this occasion.

 Shortly before 12 the delegates began pouring into the hall till the floors, galleries and stage were crowded, making brilliant spectacle The following members of the United States Senate were present among the delegates and on the main stage: Ald- rich, Blair, Hoar, Platt, Miller of New York, Miller of California, Sewell, Malone, Palmer, Conger, Harrison, Oullom, Sabin, Plumb, Manderson, Bowen, Dolph and Jones of Nevada. Among the representatives in Con- gress forming part of the State delegations and among the observers of the scene were Boutelle, Milligan, Dingley of Maine, Stewart of Vermont Rice of Massa- chusetts, Skinner, Burleigh, Wards worth of New York, William Walter Pennsylvania, Holton of Maryland, Libby of Virginia, OHara of North Carolina, Smalls of South Carolina, Jeffords of Mississippi.

 THE SELECTION OF JOHN R. LYNCH,

 the colored ex-Congressman from Mississippi, as temporary chairman of the Republican national convention is of course the sensa- ton of the hour in political circles tonight. 'sThe Plumed Knight routed' and ""Blalnes forces irretrievably defeated"" are the phrases in which the managers of the other candl

 dates are tonight through bulletins and pri vete dispatches sending abroad from Maine to California their opinions of the work of the afternoon. Fidelity to impartiality and partisanship, however, scarcely warrant this interpretation of the action of the con yention. Prominent leaders of the inter ests of the ex-Senator from Maine stated liberally before the call of States had commenced that they would not consider the vote test one, and although it is true in main that the field was arranged against Blaine, things were scattered over the meadows. Many who supported the successful = .didate did so not Lgnch and Clayton they loved the former more. Personal antagonism toward the one- armed soldier from Arkansas had something to do with the result and the desirability of giving some recognition to the 'man and brother'' outweighed other considerations with not few of the delegates. A. s. Taft, of South Carolina, put it: If you are in earnest about the claims of southern men to recognition give it to them at the start and the convention did give it accordingly. How the Blaine men view the situation was briefly and poiptedly put by one of them this even-

 

 man It was . straight vote. There was no opportunity for the conferences and consult ations the bargains and pledges which fol- l low the ballot for . presidential nominee Mr. Blaine has never been credited with more than $40 votes and yet the man whom the opposition proclaim was his candidate l boiled SS7 with two delegates not voting i tell YOU ve are in a more hopeful mood 1 tonight than at any time since our arrival"" :"" Outside of this incident the day was marked by

 OVER TWO HOURS WE'RE OCCUPIED

 in calling the roll. As prominent and dis tinguished members of the party answered their names and stated their preferences they were rewarded with cheers from lar candidate whom they favored. When the name of Senator Malone was reached the excitement was as great as at the rising of Lodge. Stepping out in the aisle the little Senator announced in a piping voice that his choice was ""John R. Lynch"" ""Louder,"" cried the secretary. ''Johu k. Lynch"" shouted Theodore Roosevelt. h. stantly there was furore of applause and Curtis, Roosevelt, Taft, Reyes of Madison, Wis, and half dozen colored delegates crowded around to grasp the hand of the little man. Before seen that Lynch was largely in the lead, and although toward the end Pennsylvania came to the rescue of Clayton with 46 votes, Texas and West Virginia with 12 each and Wiscon- sin with 10, the rally was too late. Lynch had carried the day. The secretary an- crowd had shouted itself hoarse and there was not much enthusiasm over the announce ment.

 CLAYTON, PALE AND AGITATED, BOSE

 and in tremulous tones requested that his vote, which had not been previously cast, be recorded for his successful opponent and also moved to make it unanimous. The resolu- tion was adopted Clayton, Lodge and Taft were appointed committee to escort Lynch to the chair. As the procession moved down the aisle, Clayton in front, Lynch next and Lodge and Taft bringing up the rear, the audience again went into hysterics and when with courtly bow he presented the man and brother"" to Senator Sabin hats went into the air. ladies waved parasols and handker- chiefs and pandemonium reigned supreme.

 LYNCH WAS COOL AND COLLECTED,

 to all appearances the most unconcerned man in the hall. He advanced to the front of the stage and when quiet had been restored be- gan an address which for fuency and general excellence of delivery had not been equalled by any of the speakers who had preceded him. He said: 1T feel that YOU for the distinguished honor which you have conferred upon me, for I do not. Nevertheless, from the standpoint that no patriot should fail to respond to his country's call, and that no loyal member of his party should fail to ocomply with the de- mands of his party, yield reluctantly to your decision and will assume the position to which you have assigned me (cheers). Ev- cry member of the convention who has ap- preached me on this subject within the last few hours knows that this position was neither expected nor desired by me- If, therefore. there is any such thing as man having honors thrust upon him, you have an e1emplifics- ton of 1t in this instance (cheers) I wish to say, gentlemen, that came to this con- vention not so much for the purpose of se- curing the defeat of any man, but for the purpose of contributing to the extent of my vote and influence to make Republican sue cess in November next an assured thing. I hope and believe that the assembled wisdom of the Republican party of this nation through it's chosen representatives ln this hall will so shape our policy and will present such candidates before the American people as will make that victory beyond the shadow of doubt. l wish to say, 50 far as the different candidates for the presidential nomination are concerned, that do not wish any gen tleman to feel that my election by your votes is indicative of any thing relative to prefer ance of one candidate over another. 1 am prepared and I hope every member of this convention is prepared to return to his home with an nnmistaksble determination to give hearty support, whoever they may be. (Ap- plause) -Geatlemep of the convention, I am satisfied in my own miad that when we go before the people of this country our &C., tion will be ratified because the great heart of the American people will never

A Mucu NEEDED LEvEE.


Our attention has been called to
the fact that by throwing up Il small
levcc on the river front, a mile long,
beginning at the break in the old
state levce, on Mr.. Howard Bowen's
place, near Elmot, and running down
and connecting the levee where it
crooks on Mr. Dud. Lynch's farm,
thousands Of acres Of land now in
cultivation would be exempt from
overflow. Mcssrs. w. p. Hale and
James D. Driver propose to sub
scribe tl,l00,W between them to-
wards this much needed work, if
those who are equally interested will
come to their assistance. A small
assessment Of, say, one dollar per
acre of the cleared lands that would
thus be protected from overflow
would be ample to cover the expense
of constructing such levee. Let

Reservation Proposed for SoIdiers-Homestead.

thorizing the managers of the Soldiers Homes
to erect Home in one of the States OF Terri

containing not less than 325 acres


There is large number of ex-EniOn voIun-
teer soldiers who are desirous to, but have not
the means OF opportunities to avail themselves
of the benefits of the homestead laws. Under
this act they might be enabled to 10 so.


If the managers viii select tact Of Gov

of the President and the Secretary of the IN
terror have it declared q reservation for that
special purpose, containing from 100000 to
100000 acres of land, upon which 20 erect the
Home, they can thus enable large number Of
deserving patriots, who fought 20 preserve the
Government and the Republic in its entirety
from destruction, to take up hOmesteads and
thus become racy of the soil and leave de-
scendants worthy of them to inherit said homo
steads, who VIII endeavor in peace TO be as pa
triotie as their fathers were in war These
men are yet sufficiently able to work so as to
improve said hOmeSteads, as witness the work
performed By the veterans at the Soldiers
Home near this city, and il is far better for
them to work for themselves on their owl, land
than to rust ont in an eleemOsynary institu-
ton, which at best is only adapted for the help
less or invalids.


BY obtaining homcsteads they viii become
self-sustaining and independent, and by work.
ing together in clearing and fencing and put
ting up dwellings they can DO great deal Of
service for mutual benefit in the early stages Of
settlement.


As the Government has enabled the Indians
to take up homesteads in severalty on some OF
their reservations there cannot be any reason
able objection made TO aiding in this way the

individuals on the lst Of April, from
Lordsburg. Arizona, stating that man
who had shot a saloon keeper, had been
hung to telegraph pole and that the
interesting ceremony was witnessed By
all the passengers ON tho westbound
express train, which was heavily loaded
with passengers. 1t is said that all the
stationery that could be found on the
train and all that could be found at the
stations from Benson to Yuma was used
up by the passengers in writing an
account of the dreadful affair. One
especially rapid writer wrote ten
accounts Of the affair to his sisters and


his cousins and his aunts, and mailed


the letters at Yuma. Other correspond.
ents wrote from one account to
six accounts apiece, describing the


thrilling and unexpected scene, and


the peculiar sensations which it caused


in their breasts. Others wrote that,


while they had never advocated hang


ing on general principles, the culprit


was evidently an unjustifed murderer,


and perhaps It was better, as the proof
of guilt was positive, to let him swing.
Really it didn't seem SO bad, after all.
Others thought the people Of Arizona
were noble set of men to put an end to
. deep dyed murderer at once. and spare
the Territory the needless expense of
imprisonment aud trial. Others wrote


home about the fun they had seen on
the overland, including antelopes, buff


faloes, Apaches, prairie dogs, and best
Of all, a good robust homely case Of


lynching, which they were particular in


stating was well deserved After tAe


postofice at Yuma had been bur-
dened with FIVE hundred letters
giving as many different accounts of the


hanging and the telegraph had flashed


it round the world, some passengers at q


station on the Colorado desert, after


becoming rested from ir rapid writing
approached the brave enial agent


of Wells, Fargo L Co, e train, and


asked if such hangi9 rcises were
common exercise /, II| part Of the


country.


In solemn manner the agent assured


them that such an event happened


along the line promptly at the beginning


of this month. in every year. When


asked If he knew the victim Of the
popular fury he said he had long known
him, and that he was harmless object,
whose name was Straw, of Corralitos,


and had bean hung on every April
Fool Day since the railroad had been
completed.


It is needless to say that there was
more self reproach and more maledic-
tions of a personal character on that
train than any other that ever arrived in


Los Angeles. The sell was q good thing
for the Postofice department and the
dealers in stationery. while out of all
the passengers that arrived here no one
is willing to own that he or she ever


wrote the account of the hanging of
o straw murderer. So suddenly do
people change their minds."

coursed some of its finest music for half an
hour before the meeting was called to order,
but small audience gathered in City Hall
and that was for the most part located near
the door-to hear young Mr.. Quincy's views of
the political situation, and also those OF his
companion in misery, Mr.. Kent of New Hamp-
shire.


Gen. Lynch was chairman of the meeting,
and after a few remarks introduced to the
audience Mr.. Josiah Quincy, Jr., of Boston.
Mr.. Quincy read his speech from carefully pre-.
pared notes. He has good voice and was
rather good orator. AS was to be expected his
speech was merely TRADE directed against
Mr. Blaine. He said he was an Independent
because his convictions wouldn't let him be
otherwise. He devoted quite a time to the
difficult taste of defining what the Independ.
ents believed, and, greatly to the surprise of
his audience, disclsimed the idea that Mr..
Blaine was unfairly nominated. He said the
reform plank in the Republican platform
meant nothing, and tried his powers of
sarcasm on the tariff plank with very poor sue.
cess. he then gave his attention to Mr..
Blaine, and from the language he used we in
fer that he didn't like our next President.
His peroration was quite good for SO young
man, quotations, poetry, metaphor and simile
crowding one upon another in reckless profu-
sion.


After Mr.. Quincy's speech the band played,
and then Mr.. Kent was called upon. Mr..
Kent's speech fell rather fat after the extra
ordinary effort of his younger companion, and
the audience breathed sigh.of relief when he
sat down. He said the contest next November
was between the Democratic and Republican
parties. Nobody opposed this statement. He
contrasted the party platforms, discussed the
merits of ""free trade with incidental protec-
tion,"" spoke of finance and the Irish question,
and did his best to keep what little was left of
his audience.


The Young Mems Democratic Club sat on
the stage sandwiched among the old-timers,
and helped fill up the seats.


During Mr. Quincy's speech large number
of the audience LETT the hall and went down to
the Bijou to hear Mr.. Frye."

Girls Roasted to Death in a Burning Candy

 FacEerys",,"Messrs. Gray, Toynton & Fox occupy the four story brick block on Woodbridge street, Detroit Mich, as & candy manufactory and wholesale fireworks depot. The floor and basement at No. 26 are occupied as a candy factory and store room for the manufactured goods of the firm. On these floors between fifty and sixty girls, men and boys are em- ployed. The girls are considerably in the ma jority.

 Shortly after five o'clock on Friday, the oe- cupants of the building noticed the smell uf smoke, which seemed to come from the eieya- tor shaft and spread into every room. Ihls warning was followed by frantic cry of ""Firel Fire Run for your lives ' which came from the foot of the stairs on the first floor, and was distinctly heard in every part of the building The alarm was followed by general stampede for the stairway.

 By the time the first engine had reached the scene the flames had burst from the second story windows, and it was at once seen that the firemen had stubborn fight ahead. Consider abe difficulty was experienced by the hook and ladder company in raising their ladder to the building on account of the network of wires Tn front of it. it being necessary to cut number of them before the ladder was in position for use. This duty proved disastrous loss ot time.

 Miss Belle Lynch was forewoman of the second floor. She had seven girls working under her. When they heard the alarm they at once became frantic with fright Miss Lynch tried to quiet them, but the screams of the girls and men who were in the hallway and on the stairs trying to reach the street added to their fright and they went screaming and crying from one end of the room to the other perfectly frantic and completely bewildered.

 In the midst of the tumult number of men employed in other parts of the building rushed into the room and dragged out several girls by main force. Among the number was Miss Belle Lynch, the forewoman, who was trying to quiet those about her. She had hardly lett the room before the flames burst out in all their fury, and those who were trying to res cue the girls were obliged to leave the room without knowing whether all were saved or not

 Shortly afterward the faces of three young girls appeared at the window Of the second story Behind them could be seen the glare of the flames as they licked up the dry material in the room and shot forward toward the help less creatures whose faces were pressed against the windows in hopeless despair One of them tried hard to reach the top of the lower sash of window, the upper part being down. She and her companions must have heard the frantic cries of those in the street beneath them as a hundred voices shouted ""Jump! jump for Gods sake, jumpp

 But the cries were not needed. The faces were at the window but few brief seconds, when the flames gathered about them and they disappeared from view.

 In the course of an hour the flames were sufficiently subdued to enable the firemen to search for the dead. Three bodies were taken out of the second story. The names of the dead are: Frances Missmore, aged fourteen Annie Lynch, aged tyenty-eight; Ellen Col pase aged seventeen."

 TIE telegraph for several day: past has tecn burdened with the ac- counts of terrible riot in Cincin- natl and the later ones confirm s previous report that numb Der oi persons have been killed and wound ed and the courthouse in Cincinnati burned to the ground.

 Tie primary cause of the whole terrible disaster Nss the failure ot the courts to execute cold flooded murderer. o.e Wm Rerner had been sentenced to the penitentiary for the term of twenty years for a murder, the story of which is as fol- lows:

 Wm. H. Kirk, was murdered in his stable last February ly Berner who stood behind the door and, when his victim entered smashed his head with hammer, robbed him of $40O, put the b. .dy iuto the wagon o the murdered man, hauled it off and dumped it into Mill creek. where it was discovered two days later. Joe Palmer and Wm. Berner confessed that they did the murder and rob bery. On the trial, Berner testified that Pulmer did the actual murder while he only looked on 10 get share of the money. On V ednesday morning Berner was found guilty of manslaughter.

 The jury that found the verdict were hooted in the streets and final "" suggestion was made to break into the jail and lynch Berner. The suggestion gained strength tlll final ly an immense crowd attacked the jail and courthouse and the police of the city and the militia were called out to protect the property and Ber> ner. This only enraged the crowd and, though Berner was secretly taken from the jail and started for the penitcntiary at Columbus, the riot grew in magnitude and finally resulted in the burning of the large aud elegant courthouse aad the death of some thirty or forty citi- zens.

 Berner was taken from the train at town before reaching Colum bus and hanged.

 So much for the failure of law to protect the people through the nachinations of tricksters at laH., and money. The incident is a terrible warning to those whom the people expect to uphold the integrity of their institu- tions If the Cincinnati mob had hanged the jury that had thus per jurcd themselves and disgraced and humlliaied justice ard betrayed the safeguard of the people, they would l have perhaps doae the country an immense bereft. Time and again it has been pointed out that there is a higher law than that Of our courts, 1 which, when awak ened, is terrible in it's vengeance. and in this case we have an instance.

 Of course the occasion was taken 1 advantage or by the hoodlum andthe l professional law-breaker to further their desires; but Tn the primary 1 move the people felt that their courts had become mockery; and they were right--moreover, they were right when they took It upon them selves to correct the abuses their in stitutions had suffered, however ter rible the result of such move may 1 have been. If there is no check to the outrages upon justice; we can ex> pect no further protection to the life and property of the citizen."
