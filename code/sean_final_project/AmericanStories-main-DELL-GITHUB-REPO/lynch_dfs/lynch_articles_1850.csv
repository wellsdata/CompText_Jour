from the Louisville Journal of the 18th

The steamer Fleetwood, as has here
tofore been stated, took the surviving
passengers and crew of the ill-tated
steamer Kate Fleming to Padueah. One
of the deck hands of the latter was Sc
verely wounded lay the explosion, anc
when he got aboard the Fleetwood laid
down in a berth of one of the deck hands
of the Fleetwood. AS soon as the latter
came off his watch he ordered the wound
ed man ont. which being refused, he
pulled him out and beat him, ia which,
it is said, he was assisted by the mate.
The wounded man was afterwards
brought back to Portland or SblPp'ngs-
port. where he resided. On the arrival
of the Fleetwood yesterday she was de-
tanned sometime at the foot Of the canal.
MANY of the friends of the wounded man
gathered here, including himself, when
he pointed out the deck hand who had
treated him so harshly. He (the deck
handy was taken off the boat by the
crowd, stripped. tarred and feathered, at
ter which he was permitted to go. They
also looked for the mate, but he could not
be found

The assemblage few weeks ago of Natural
lists in Charleston, South Carolina, was characte-

CoSrE Of Georgia. exhibited remarkable effects of ice
and frost upon certain vegetables and ear,hs.


Other discussions easuej, relating shells, reptiles, fossil
remains Artesan we plants planets, mathematics, morals
and physics the general examination of which, and the
paron Of opinions appeared be satisfactory to the Asso
eiation and to the public who attended the meetings.


An interesting peculiarly noticed the extension to
which well authenticated truth, in any natural science
might be applied, and the practical utility Of the intecom-
munion Of sentiment among Naurass occupied by very
different subjects of study and observation.


The Investigations of the botans and conchoogist were
found verify and benefit the arguments Of the and
geogrspher. ...@

MAuRT remarked that the Gulf Stream would convey the

The question Of the Unity of the Races of Man. had oc
cuped the a.te ntion of club Of gentlemen Charleston
who occasionally for the discussion Of scientific apd other
subjects and had probably been carried 10 bear
further discussion there But observations of Professor
AsAssz made the argument exceedingly interesting. Some
gentlemen would willingly hve entered into the discuss if
il could have been received with proper temper and argued
without personal feeling The remarks referred to WERE in
substance That there existed authority from the phrase
oogy OF the Genesis dprove facts made apparent by com
paison with other objects of natural history Tha was
difficult conceive how the white of man could have
originated from parents of other COLOR or that
had originally white paentage s'That the history Of
Genesis described the generations of family and rather
authorized the opinion that other Of human beings
existed at The time with the sons Of ADAM who were
described as ntemaying with hem females of their
own family enumerated The narrative did not prevent
the supposition that these might have been pair whites

These suggestions Of Of the intelligent and truth

what was considered by some very unnecessary clerical

The obligations for mutual Kindness charity, and mercy are
certainly nvadated by such arguments as those present

account of the warning given to detected Abo-
litionist in that city, the Lowell paper adds:


THE above, coming MS it does froma South
ern source, may be taken, We suppose, as a fair
specimen of Southern society and Southern
chiyalry. We would by no means recommend
to Northern gentlemen, whilst travelling in the
South, to indulge in personally offensive and in
sultng observations. In the present instance,
however, we are left entirely to conjecture what
these observations were which were so offensive
to Southern ears, but every friend to law, de-
eency and order will readily admit that no OBJ
seryations whatever could, for a moment, pal
late, excuse or Justify such a manifestation of
mobOcracy and Lynch law. II the lao has been
violated, let the law be mpartially and faithfully
executed If, on the contrary, there has only
been violation of propriety and good taste, the
Southern ehivalry are, by no means, entitled to
the privilege of fmaking correction. Their own
sins are too numerous to allow them to assume
the Office of moral teachers. Whenever South
ern travellers see fit to visit the North we really
hope they may be allowed to do so without any
fear of being visited with a coat of tar and
feathers. Generally speaking. they look bad
enough without being clothed in such hnbili-
ments


The Boston Atlas, referring to the Fugitive
Slave Bill, thus concludes:


""We wonder if the advocates of this bill
would be in favor of paying from the Treasury
of the States or of the General Government the
New England merchants all the money they
have lost or may lose by the failures and the
swindling operations cf persons whom they have
trusted with their goods in Southern States If
the Northern States are to pay for runaway
slave property, then the Southern States ought
to pay for Northern property that didn't run
away, but which the purchaser took South, con-
verted it to his own use, and then refused to pay
the Northern merchant for it.""


Deafened and stunned by the cant of fraternal
affection and unreciprocated regard which the
Northern press and affiliated Southern branches
thereof eternally din into the ears of the South,
we'll may we enquire, pointing to such evidences
of good feeling, as Richard did of the Prelate,
when sending back the coat of mail worn by the
warlike bishop, whom he claimed as son of
the church.


""Is thy sons coat, or not!""


II is said that experience is the best OF teachers
but it has already proved very expensive one
to the South, and her people it seems are very
slow to learn its lessons."

THE ADMISSION or CALIFoRNIA.--Prominen
among those recent acts Of outrage and wfop2
upon the rights of the South the requirements
Of the Constitution, ard the former usages of
the Government, the admission of California
stands first In this matter, who dare deny the


njustic. perpetrated upon the South 1t is
without parallel in the history OF our legisla-
ton, and will yet cover with infamy the political
traitors of the South who have quietly acqui-
esced in its preparation. What are the facts z
California, in the first place, was acquired by the
common blood and treasure OF the South,
thereby emitting her TO fair partition OF its
domain. No sooner was California acquired,
however, than Gen. Riley, temporarily appointed
as Governor of the Territory, undertakes to de-
clare that the Mexican law, which excluded
slavery, should be the supreme law Of the land
until revoked by Congress- Thus matters re-
mained until the advent Of General Taylor's Adj
mnistration, when he, as very torcibly says the
Lynchburr Republican, instigatedand controlled
bv ""an Abolition Cabinet, fearful of having an
issue forced upon him by Congress, in the shape
of the Wimot Proviso, which he could not meet
without betraving the confidence Of one or the
other sections Of the Union determined to ward
off that issue. if possible, by instigating the
people of California to settle the question for
themselves, bv system Of usurpation hereto
fore unknown to our system OF government
Accordingly. Thomas Butler King Southern
member Of Congress, was appointed the special
agent Of the Administration. to accomplish this
dirty work. and was forthwith posted off to
California, with official advice to the people OF
that Territory to assemble in Convention, form
a Sute government aud apply for admission into
the Union. And General Taylor expressly de-
cares himself to have been principally actuated
in this recommendation, by an earnest desire Ia
afford 10 The wisdom and patriotism Of Congress
an opportunity Of aroiding occasions Of bitter ana
angry dissensions among fte people Of he United
States In other words of avoiding the slavery
question by instigating the mongrel breed OF
foreigners, &c, inhabiting that Territory, to
adopt constitution excluding slavery


This was clearly the purpose of the President
as is manifest, not only from his own language
quoted above, but from other important and in
dubitable facts, which have heretofore been given
to the public through our columns.


The next step in this grand crusade against
all right and all Justice, as due to the Sourh is
the admission of California as State Of this
Union, by the two Houses of Congress and the
endorsement of President Fillmore. Now, when
or where had the South any part or parcel in the
arrangement or settlement Of this important
question: in which she had the right to demand
an equal and fair participation? When acquired
as Territory, Mexican law was proclaimed and
slavery excluded. The next hope was, that
Congress, as by all precedent it Ind heretofore
done, would extend the laws of the United States
over the Territory, thereby giving alike to the
people of the North and the South, an equal and
fair opportunity to acquire supremacy. But nc
such nodcnm of justice was vouchsafed the
South. Before one solitary day had passed over
when California, as a Territory was free to the
people Of the South and its property, alike with


the North, set of desperate adventurcrs, from
all clmes and all countries, unauthorized by
Congress, and contrary to the just hopes and
expectations of every citizen of the South adopts
State constitution, elects members to the
| United States Senate and House of Represen-
tatives and 10, the measure of iniquity and wrong
is consummated The South deprived of all


participation in territory which would have
been of inestirnable value to her people, and OF
countless millions to her wealth. And yet, IL
the face of all this, there are men to be found
, and we blush to say in the South, who send
forth pans of joy to the immaculate wisdom
which devised, and the baseness which consum.
| mated this and similar acts of deep and damnng
| wrong With craven hearts, and cuckoos' notes

On my leaving New York, promised you
would write you, but as you have many able cor
respondents here, have not written you. A few
days since, however, started for Marysvlle, on
the Yuba river, and thinking you would not object
to few lines from this place, write you.


The FL Dorado was bound up the Sacramento,
and was one among her crowd of passengers.
She had sounded her last whistle, and the lines
were cast loose, and, putting and blowing, she
dashed through the waters Of the bay towards
the Sacramento. We drove along finely; and
although short time has elapsed since San
Francisco became a city, and the Sacramento
has been navigated by steamers, yet we could
not complain Of the accommodations of the III Do
RADIO. We were crowded with passengers; many,
who had some two weeks previous fled from Sa-
cramento City, on account Of the flood, were
now returning; others starting for the mincs;
others, and by far the greater number, were bound
for the new and-(soon to be)-the great of Marys-
vile, at the mouth Of the Yuba river. We were
not long in passing through the different bays, and
at five Il. NJ, were AT New York on the Pacific.
This place has increased greatly since last sum-
mer-ihen containing three houses. We here
entered the Sacramento, and, as we expected,
the dark lowering clouds gathered around US.
and the rain fell heavy and fast; but the shower
soon passed away, and as the sun sent his
evening rays DER the surrounding mountains, we
were quite sure OF line weather for our journey. i
could not help but admire the beauty OF the scene,
but that supper-bell called me away to the scenes
below.

many times during the evening were we graiitied
with similar views. Berhs are unknown, and we
were all compelled To pick the soltest spots and
make IL comfortable as we could. The I'll TO-
rsdo drove on, and we found ourselves, al sunrise,
about five miles from Sacramento: The water
was running swiftly down, and the trees
were inclined down the sire am, by the great
rush Of the waters. Vast plains were inundated,
and many there were, who had built their log
houses, thinking themselves safe for the winter, who
were forced To leave IN consequence OF the quick
rise of the water. The passengers had crowded
the decks, TO catch the first sight OF Sacramento
City, which soon came in sight as We turned
the river, ond, ere long,. we were alongside
the embarcsders, and ashore. How different
the city appeared from what II did when
was there in November, Houses were shut
up; stores were closed: people either
rowing around In boats, or were sinking up To their
knees IN mud, as they worked their way through
the streets; but the water was leaying-t had left
the city and had fallen three feet below the bank
on the river side. We found the steamer Lawrence
was awaiting the boat from below, and would
start In the morning, up the Sacramento, for Yuba
City and Marysvlle, and that, from the appearance
OF the boat, our load OF baggage. freight and pas
sengers, would not be small. The rver being

being crowded there, and stores were going mp,
and speculation was running high. There, among
others, was bound.


The Lawrence had been whistling away nearly
an hour, and finally, crowded with people, and
loaded down with freight, she started on her way
from Sacramento. The river was running down
very swift, and our powerful stern wheel did not
push us ahead very fast, but still, we were on our
way up-the buzzng Of the blower, the ringing Of
the ""pay-up bell in the hands Of a prsciiscd
darkey, and the upectting Of one gold digger over
another in the crowd on the deck, were all IN order.

United States Exploring Expedition to
the river Jordan and the Dead Sea in
1848, visited the garden of Gethsemane
about the miGle of May. He says:


''The clover upon the ground was in
bloom, and altogether the garden in its
associations, was better calculated than
any place l know to soothe troubled
spirit. Eight venerable trees, isolated
from the smaller and less imposing ones
which skirt the pass of the Mount of
Olives form consecrated grove. High
above on either hand, towers a lofty
mountain, with the deep. yawning chasm
of Jehosep phat, between them. Crown
ing one OF them is Jerusalem, living
city, on the slope of the other is the great
Jewish cemetery, a city Of the dead
Each tree in this grove cankered and
knarled, and furrowed by age, yet beau
tiful and impressive in its decay, is a
living monument of the affecting scene
once beneath and around it. The olive
perpetuates itself, and from the root Of
the dying parent stem, the young tree
springs Into existence. These trees are
accounted one thousand years old
Under those of the preceding growth,
therefore, the Saviour was wont to rest;
aud one of the present may mark the
very spot where he knelt, and prayed,
and wept. No caviling doubts can find
entrance here. The geographical boun-
daries are too distinct and clear for an in
stant's hesitation. Here the Christian,
e. f,1o & ,l~- -,
the past, can resign himself to sad yet
soothing meditation. The few purple
and crimson flowers, growing about the
roots of the trees, will give him ample
food for contemplation; for they tell Of
the suffering life and ensanguined death
of the Redeemer."""

unparalleled quantities. Owing to the ncompIeteness of our


files these accounts very confused and leave in doubt

The mob, to prevent any of the Mormons from escaping, had stationed guard beyond the river. He instant ly turned his course down the stream, when whole platoon let off their rifles, bat the dis tance was too considerable A hail of bullets rattled around him on the ice without ury.

 Il will foil the iends yet"" he said to himself and put forth all his speed. Mills flew away, when he became conscious that some one was pursuing him. He stacked his velocity, and gradually wheeled about to take view of his enemy. But the latter was still ta remote for an accurate surgey, and t!te hToeilafs s...ssza-. aloud mad prayer-''God grant me that 1t be Col. Turk, and I am willing to die!''

 On rushed the pursuer--ou, still on, like an avalanche. The noise of his iron skates could De heard above the roar of the northern blast, and his dark form loomed in the glitterng moon- beams, large in statute as a giant. As he drew nearer the young preacher smiled venomously. He recognized the arch persecutor, Col Turk, and he laughed outright laugh, that rung over the frozen river like tie wild scoh of some demon, when he saw the other unshcath his gIcaming knife. Mills then immediately pulled his own from its scabbard, and started off, so as to avoid the coming shock, which might other- wise prove fatal, by the mere force of the colIis- ion to both.

 And then began a series of rapid and cunning evolutions to secure the advantage in this new method of combat, the most terrible ever cone ceived. They marked the smooth surface of the ice with circles angles, squares, paralIeTo- grams, and almost every possible figure of plain geometry; but each seemed perfect skater, and could not find the other at fault, or take him un- prepared. They passed repeatedly within three feet of each other, and made quick thruss which pierced to the bone! And still the cloud grew more intense, and the Wrathful wind howled on, while their man9uvres and flights somehow carried them farther down the river where the crused ice was thinner and cracked fearfully beneath their tread.

 Finally the Mormon took the desperate re- solve to terminate the strife by sacrificing his own life so as to make sure of that of his foe at the same time: In the following rush, he no longer turned aside to avoid direct collision, and frustrated the attempt of the lyncher to that end by swerying slightly inward from right line.

 They met at full speed, and the shock was | like that of the crust of adverse comets. At the moment of their fall the quaking ice split beneath their weight, with dealening roar and | the wild waters, boiling and hissing like hell, | swallowed them lOreVer--the persecutor and his victim, both victims now!

 But the river still rolled on it way to the sea: the stars all shone as bright and beautiful as of old in the morning of creation, when the angels Of God chanted their birth song; and the wrath fal wind of winter howled on over the icy grave of the enemies nO m0re!--Sa0aduy ItnIeS."

HIS FIGHT WITH COLONEL, TURK",,"

 10 be present.

 A strong violent mob of Iynchers was about this time organized to put down the MIormons, under the command of Colonel Turk-one off the most desperately dangerous men that Missou- II, or Ill truth, any other country ever produced. Some Of the Mormons were tared and feathered. some were scourged with long, knotty hickores, till they tainted from the excess of torture and the loss of blood-others were forcibly deprived Of their property, and reduced in day to the condition of beggars-while others still shared a doom of more mercy and were shot down on the prairie like So many wolves. At last Turk resolved 10 take some of the concet out of the young preacher, Mills, and he gave notice to his men accordingly.

 It was dreadful cold night in md-winter, l833 and although the sky was cloudIess, and the full moon shone out in all her splendor, the earth lay in that pearly radiance, chill and dreary as frozen tomb; for thick sheet of snow crusted its surface, and the north wlnd howIed over 1t dismal dirge It was night to drive even the thieves and outlaws into barns and stables for shelter, and to keep honest people by the blaze of their own roaring hearths.

 And yet strange to say, in log cabin, within three hundred yards of the Missouri river, then

 

 people had assembled to hold religious meeting. They were Mormons, you may be sure. No fanatic of an old faith would have turned out on such night; they must be fresh zealots, with some new idea but at its birth in their hearts and flaming like meteor in their imaginations, or they never could have ventured to face such an ice blast as that. The congregation included men and women In about equal numbers, and many of the former carried rifles, which they grasped with one hand, even when kneeling down n prayer; such was the immincnce of peril either real or imagined as they deemed pending over them.

 The preacher--the enthusiastic Mills-I1ad advanced to a thrilling head of his eloquent dis course, and was painting in terrible fire language the bitter persecution which has ever followed the footsteps of all great relormers since the ] beginning of time. Never before had he been half so animated or half so affecting. His blue eye gleamed like a star-his voice pealed like a trumpet, shrill as the wild wind which whstled over the house top; and his beardless lip seemed literally loaded with music. Groans, tears, and wild shrieks from the audience, proved the despotic power of the utterance. Suddenly three rifles exploded in quick succession before the door, and three sentirels, shaking with ter TOT, rushed into the room, crying out--""Ihe mob! the mob! Save yourselves from Colonel Turks mob''

 No person can depict the scene of dismay and confusion that ensued. The females screamed aloud as if all hope had departed. Several of the men sprang out of the windows and fled, as if pursued by a legion of devils, while most of those who remained appeared supplied and to- tally poWerless, either to escape or make ready for resistance. Indeed there was little space allowed for preparation. In few moments mob amounting to hundreds had surrounded the building, and the muzzles of fifty cooked guns and pistols were thrust in through the doors and windows. Still none within lifted finger for defence-fear seemed to have turned them into stone. Persecution had not yet hardened the ""Latter Day Saints' into veterans, and the after wards famous ""Mormon Legion"" existed then only in the imagination of the prophet.

 Presently the lynchers, headed by the all- dreaded and gigantic Colonel Turk, rushed in, and began to beat the people furously with the iron ranrods of their riAes with very little dis tinction of mercy as to the age or sex. The cries and vain enreaties of the poor sufferers sweled to vail wilder than the bowling of the wind without. At length Col. Turk roared- ""Turn out the women and seize the men, and let us have the hickory switches and the tar and feathers!'

 And the drunken mob shouted, and hastened to execute the brutal mandate.

 Up to this time young Mills had continued standing with the Bible of their prophet in his hand, but unearthly pale and strangely excited, his lip writhing, his teeth clenched, and his bright eyes swimming in a halo of fire. Sud- denly he made bound for an adjacent window, and notwithstanding more than twenty endea- vored to seize he, he effected his escape from the house.

 ""Chase him--shoot him--take him. alive or deadr'-cried Turk, in a transport of rage, set ting the example by commencing the pursuit himself.

 The flight of Mills was directed in a straight line for the river, and his marvellous agility, him at some distance ahead. They fired both rifles and shot-guns at him as he ran, and happi- ly without effect. When he came to the river side he stopped down, and hastily fastened on pair of skates, which he had carried in his pocket for the last few days to be ready for any extraordinary emergency, and then taking the ice, skinned over the frozen stream with the swftness of the wind.

 ""Has nobody pair of skates?"" shouted Col. Turk, striking his forehead with gesture of wrath and vexation.

 q have,"" answered one of the mob; s'but shall certainly not try them on the ice such a night as this.'

 Be quick, give them to mer' exclaimed Turk in a tone of fiery impatience

 The skates were produced; the eager Colonel tried them on, and then, swearing a dreadful oath that he would bring back the preachers scalp,or leave his own, he began the perilous chase. Oh! there is no darking like the courage inspired by the passion for revenge!

 In the meanwhile, Mills had approached thel"

the subject OF the proper place for holding the

should be held IN Nashville or in MilledyeyilIe.


We have no hesitaney in Recommending that

raugement suggestion for another place of

will be in session at MledgeyilIe about the

The whole power of the Southern Convention
will consist in the force of its reasonngs and
the wisdom Of its recommendations, and in our
opinion, nothing should be done which wonld
tend to cast suspicion upon the motives of its

DIsUNfoS.--We learn that n gentleman, (8lr

didate for office, is circulating the report that
Judge Broome and Maj. Beard are disunionists
and that the former SO expressed himself in a
speech last Saturday at Miccasuke. In regard
to Judge Broome, the Sentinel in its report of
his speech says:


:"" He defended his position with good deal
of ingenuity and eloquencc--declaring that he
was better Union man than Cor CaN""


All this of course sIr. Walker hard and now
full well remembers.


Maj. Beard says in his circular

TO think that this paper and the Richmond Exam
iner are the only journals in the State which main
tain their uncompromislng opposition to the od-
GUS measures OF Congressional robbery recently
passed into laws but never were they more mis-
taken Those who have PLAYED traitors to the
South in The contest, are crying peace peace not
not because there is peace, but because they want
peace that the awful consequences of their conduct
may not be visited upon them. 1t is natural for
men who bring about results dsgraceful in them
selves to want to hush it up, and not be made the
subject Of fanimadversion.


The Portsmouth Pilot, the Norfolk Southern
Argus, the Fredericksburg Recorder and Freder-
icksburg News, the Spirit of Jefferson the Abine-
don Democrat, the Wy,heyiie Republican and
other papers in the State still breathe the true
Southern spirit. These papers combine as much
| or more talent than any similar portion ofthe press
ofthe State. The Fredericksburg News is whig

Virginia that has not played truant to our North

was then, more than balanced, giving as a reason
his "" arm approval of our course. We, of course,
could not refuse to receive it! While we are i'm
constant receipt of such evidences of public appro
val of our course, several of those papers which
have espoused the cause Of Mr.. Clay's "" Omnibus
have been steadily losing ground, and receiving
letters upon letters of rebuke and denunciation
while from every quarter, and from those who do
not suspend their patronage, curses loud and deep
are constantly to be heard.


But whether our humble course had been an
proved or dIsapproved, we could have pursued
none other with our convictions of seIf-resp
and OF pubc duty We have proposed no rash
measures, nor do we intend to propose any, We
have not advocated dissolution of the Union. nor
do we intend to advocate it under present circum-
stances. But we are of those who believe that the

In consequence of the foregoing our reporter at


tended on Sunday evening, and found the building
well filled with both scxes-about one half being
| Proestants and the other half Cathol lcs-prncj-
paly Irish or Of Irish descent. The lecturer was a
pale faced, demure looking individual, with green
! spectacies, and appeared TO be anything but an
lrshman, except in his Munster brogue, which he
still retains after an absence of twenty-three years
from his native country. lie commenced by asking
If there was any person in the room who under
stood Irish; and being answered in the affirmative,
he proceeded to speak in that language, giving a
history of his life. He said the Bible was pro-
bbited book in his fathers house in the county of
Waterford-that he never it till he came TO thi.
country-that in the county in which he was born
he feared TO look upon the face of Protestant for
he was taught 10 hate and fear all Pro,estants
He came to America when he was nineteen years
of age, and spent Sl20 in a way that he was
ashamed to relate. He was very wild and wicked
character; but he found the Bible in the United
States, and that made new man of him. lie had
been always told that the Protestant version was
false; but he found, 10 his astonishment, on COM
pairing 1t with the Douay, that in the most important
passages they both agreed. The lecturer then
went on TO speak in English and quoted Rich
Rev. Or. Hughes Lenten Pastoral. from the Free
mans Journal; and, as if to show how much he
understood of the subject he was treating, he pro-
nounced the word collation."" coalition; upon
which.


Mr.. LYNolf arose and said, there is no such word
as coalition in The pastoral.


The lecturer insisted that coalition was the
word.


IRISH PEAsANT-lIe is pretty lecturer who does
not know The difference between collation. and Il
coalition.


The lecturer then quote passages from the Bible.
TO show that forbidding to marry, and ordering to
abstain from meats, was heretical. The eXplana-
iion given in the notes of the Douay Bible, was
that the persons referred to were the ancient Gnos-
ilcs but if was heretcal on their part to abstain
from meats and forbid TO marry, il is equally hereti-
cal now for the Catholic priests to initiate them.
The reverend lecturer then proceeded to relate some
OF his experience. lie said, when he was in Con-
necticut, he was sent for to Pennsylvania, in re-
ference 10 some iron works; and being asked one
DAY what place oil worship he would go TO, he said


nSId made no ,h ioT they were @ all alike lie
his text from Luke, 10. lie said he wanted
vNa OF religion, and that now was the accepted
ime--now was the day of salvation. The words
OF the preacher went TO his soul. He (Mr.
Welch,) went TO his boarding house, and
hesltated whether he would bow his knee in
prayeT--ior he was not accustomed 10 pray. lie
did pray that night, and felt some hope up TO that
night he was one of the most prophane biasphe-
mers on earth. lie went next to a love feast,
where DR.. Sloan told his own experience, which
exactly described the case of the lecturer lie
tried several times 10 clasp the man in his arms-he
so loved him. Ee went home, and that night,
when he lay awake in bed, he heard Il voice as
distinctly as he now heard hs own, saying to him:
""Ihy sins are forgiven thee"" lie jumped out of
bed, end cried, g ''Haelujoh, glory, glory y a

from one corner of the room.) His wife asked

er from one part of the audience, and indignation

which there IL no light, and where all unbaptized

dociIince as that.


The lecturer then proceeded TO take from his boz
som sting Of beads, the use OF which he ex.
planned 10 the audience-the Lords Prayer was to
be said when he came to the big one. There were
ten prayers 70 the Virgin Mary, for every said
10 Christ. II, he continued, the Virgin Mary can
hear my prayers here, and the prayers Of my re-
laiiyes in Ireland. she must be ornnipresent. Plus

that the Virgin Mary was born clear of original sin.
Through what channel We all know Christ was
born free from original sin, for he was conceived
by the Holy Ghost. But the Bible has never told

be worshpped with pure and fervent worship.

few days after this, that Mr. Forrest intended to

having my allowance regularly. Mr.. Stevens told
me, on the evening on which he brought me Mr..
Forests letter of December 2ith, lS49, that Mr..
Forrest had seen Mr. Sedgwick, and had ascer-
tanned from him that could not, by any deed, le-
gally sign away my right of dover, and that the
only way Mr.. Forrest could settle the matter, and
obtain full night over his own property was by OBJ
tanning divorce. did not make any offer, nor
did Mr.. Forrest make any decnature on this sub

that MIR. Forrest offered me one of three houses
in Twenty-second street, (Which rented at that
time for three hundred and seve enty-five dollars
each year,, and five hundred dollars year to
III


My present course of life is not prodgal, nor
reckless, nor do give expensive entertainments 10
any persons, or receive or entertain any person or
persons OF loose or degraded character, as Mr..
Forrest untruly alleges.


We have little time to receive visiters durngthe
day,t ,tbut we are always at home TO any friends
who may call in the evening. As We dine early,
and, as during all my life have taken supper, we
have that meal every night at ten O'Clock; and if
there happen TO be any yIsiters with US, they are
usually asked to join us. Twice only since we
have had the house in Sixteenth street, have we
invited any number of persons in an evening, and
then they came socially. Inever pretended TO give
parties.


AS to entertaining or receiving women whom
Mr. Forrest charges with being unworthy, and
gentlemen against whom he alleges criminalIy, it
is impossible for me TO avoid doing so, unless |
would exclude myself from all society, even in
cuding my own sister. Many of Mr.. Forests
charges are doubtless made for this express pur-
pose, and consider it my right, as it is really ne
cessary to my safety, to resist this attempt 10 ex-
clude me from society. Mr.. Forrest mas furnished
conclusive evidence TO me, that he makes charges
without believing them TO be true. For instance,
his proofs furnished TO the Legislature of Pennsyl
wanna, in March, 1850, implicate, among many
others, MIR. Henry Wlkoh, Dr. Rich, andDr. Hack
ley. In his libel, presented 10 the Philadelp phia
Court, inAugust last, he named eight, and in his
recriminatory answer 10 my action for divorce,
in October last, he named SIX participaors IN my
alleged guilt, emitting DR.. Hackley in the first,
and all these three gentlemen In the latter;
thereby showing that he did not believe the
charge against them. And then, on the 10Th of
November, 1850, he swore TO his said affidavit in
this action, again duplicating all three OF them. and
accompanied II with recri ninatory answer In the
same action, omitting all their names; so that in
this very action, and on the same day, he charged
them, and gave legal notice that, on the trial, he
would not attempt TO prove them guilty. In his
Philadelphia libel, from which DR.. Hackley's name
is omitted, he states that he does not know the
name of any of the guilty parhcipators not therein
named; thus expressly declaring that he did not
believe the charge against him.


The charges OF keeping unworthy company, and
oI evil habits and character made againstmy sister
Margaret, by Mr.. Forrest, are wholly untrue. He
never made such charges until the present year, TO
my knowledge or belief Ii is also untrue that
ever made parties for the purpose Of bringing Mrs.
voorhees, into society. / used 10 meet ali or
nearly all the ladies of my acquaintance at her
rooms in Great Jenes street, where she boarded
with Mrs. Ingham for two years prior to our taking
the house in Sixteenth street. The character OF
her associations may be judged from the fact that
! hold the letters of Judge Conrad and Mr.. Ma
goon, the witnesses Of Mr.. Forrest, written since
our separation, and speaking of her in the kindest
terms. She has been chorister in one of the
Episcopal churches for seven years past. II would
not become me to give list of her respectable
friends, but may be permitted to name those

harsh terms, with influencing and prejudicing me

the whole tenor OF his remarks, but the manner
and terms used were severe. The letters which

her society, or objected to my association with her
as demoralizing, discreditable, or improper in any
way. He had, indeed, previously TO that time, and
beginning about November, ISIS, shown illwiIl to

s,la mines il company with three men, TWO amer
fan. sDd one Irshman named Mike: about three
,csts sec in the nighr, the one named Mike muir
S.rsd the TWO Americans TO get the gold that they
Ssd brnusbt with them to the mines; Nike then
..;S n me tha, i run he would shoot me pass
inc near Weaysrs Ranch | wished TO stop In or
der 10 work there but he told me if | stopped he
would murder me- We then divided the gold be.
tween us which we had taken from the murdered
men; arriving al the Mission Of St. Johns we bought





s,s men. three sailors lof whom two are now prs-
oners and one was killed in the light and two
marines; the three sailors left the marines at the
Mission 10. wishing 10 travel further with them,
and jc:ned rs we all came together TO the MISSION
of ST. Miguel; an Indian, named John. came on
with US from the VI ssOn of La Sodad; the three
sailors were on foot; about two or three mies tins
side O. the Mission Cf La Solidad we found two
old horses; two of the men that joined US mounted
fhcs,, b.,so pf Ia
only brought one to the NJ sson OF St Msuel.


1--WE arrived at St Miguel about OF clock in the
afternoon we got supper, and stopped there all
night; the next morning about o'clock we LETT,
and went about haH mile; it was very cold, the
wind blowing very hard; We sold thirty ounces OF
placer gold that we bad taken from the two men
we murdered To Mr.. Read He had been talking
70 us about his trip - the mines, saying that he had
more cold than his boy could Int; when we went
sbmt half mile we hated, and began disputing,
some saving that Real had good deal OF gold,
and il would be best TO take it; we then decided
b turn back, whi h We did and stopped there
al day. Daring the evening was talklngto the
prisoner QuiD about the idea oi robblng the eoid,
and he said that il was not right, and that was my
opinion al o; l wanted him 10 persuade them not TO
commit the robbery but he answered that II he
did they would BE- mad with him; during the eve
ming the rest came in, and tie man that was BAN
berry came IN and said, if we had been msn we
would be booking round


""About o'clock NJ. Read came into the room
and sat on bench by the FIRE. Bamberry was
standing behind him cutting some wood with an
ak he had in his handl to throw on the fire. he
stepped toward the FIRE and threw ON the wood,
and then walked back again behind Read. was
at the time filling my pipe; | asked Gum 10 give
me a coal of fire just he vas giving me the tire
/ be ard the blow Of an axe, struck by the man
Bamberry on Mr. Read he struck hln on the
head Read fell, and after he had iallen, Bamberry
struck him several times ca the head with the Ak
after this. the Indan stabbed him with knife;
Qun and ran out into The corridor after that, and
Nike and Bamberry brought US back again and
shut the door; Bamberry opened the door again
and told us 10 come on he then said there IS 10
backing out One man named Peter Remer went
into the kitchen and killed. The negro there with al
Ak This man is one OF the prisoners He then
returned and said 'come On


awe all then went towards Reads room Mike
opened the door; We had double-barreed gun
and an old cutlass Upon opening the door he said,
'Brsaos n0ches, .ScaOrItas, good night, ladies'
and they all went in but me- | ran out III the cor
ndor, and Mike after me, hO asked me where |
was going. / heard one of the women scream
when was raining, and Mike said to me = have
stabbed her with th.sswora. After this, they all
came outside the house, and as everything was
quiet they must oil have been killed THE persons





don't you shoot that Indian and be d-d to you,-
there was an old Indian in the other room lying by
the FIRE. told him the door was shut, and Remer
ssld 4 will soon open It, He gave the door a
hck and it few open. Bamborry then said TO me
ihoot him answered, Il can't cannot take
sight; he then raised ils sun and shot him. my
gun was i Ing on my arIo, and pulled the trigger
and i went of, bat | don't think the bali struck
near him.


Some time siter this occurred | cannot say
whether il was before or after we left the Mission,
heard the men say they pulled mn Indian boy from
under the bed. One Of ihem said hs had hard lie
-meaning he died hard. Mike then asked Quin,
tho wounded prisoner, how he hit him, and he an
swercd, he did not know how he struck him; B am
berry then SAID that Quin had split his head open
with AK. After this We went and drank some
wine in Reads room. Remer took sn ak and broke
open the chest where the money was they then
commenced breaking open the other chests and
uHing their contents, among other things Bamjerry
got q silver watch


About hafan hour afer the murder was com.

wednesday last, lawess mob assembled at the Court
House, and though resisted by the Sheriff at the Jail door,
entered the Jail and took thereom by foce William Gray
son, free negro charged with the murder of David W.
Miller, and hung him by the neck until he was dead The
Superior Court of Cupepe had twice convicted Grayson
and the General Court had twice granted him new trial
In the last opinion the General Court said ""Upon the


whole case of opinion that the testimony not only


not sufficient prove the guilt of the accused but that


IS hardly sufficient to raise suspicion against him.


The judgment must therefore be reversed and new trial


awarded This nfuriated mob, consisting as we regret
to learn, in part OF justices Of the peace and of members
christian churches have thus by violence reversed the dec
sion OF the highest criminal tribunal in the State and been
guilty Of FOUL cowardy, and endsh MURDER and that too
OF helpless free negro with defend him nor avenge
his wrongs Grayson, learn, avowed his innocence on
the galows One minute given him in which he was
told ne was to confess his guilt this he refused to do and
told them to execute him at once, which they did,


This first attempt at Lynch law in this Commonwealth
should be rebuked with rmness and punished with severity
Unless speedily checked in its course it must overthrow ali
government and render life liberty, and property without
protection 1t rests with the legally constituted authorities
Of Virginia to wipe off this foul blot from her character
We trust in Gods name they will not fail to do it.

Surely such a scheme ought not even to be ac-
quesced in submitted to by the South, if forced
on US by the tyranny of a Northern majority. How
passing strange then that Southern Representatives,
expected and called to approve and pass BY
their own votes! Not merely to submit to the ine-
vtable chain, but to aid in manacling ourselves and
hug the badge of bondage as the emblem of honor
and safety. Others may do as their convictions and
their consciences may allow, but for myself person
ally, would resign and forfeit public station now
and for ever, before would subject myself and my
constituents to the degradation and the ignominy of
sustaining such measure.

The follow extract from letter received by
the Pkasdephia North ame'eo~, from officer of the
u g. frigate Brandywne, detailing the effects Of the
yellow fever on board that vessel -


U. s. FKtcArE DRANDYwINR,


Orr MorrEvIDEo, April 18th, 1850.


On our arrival at Rio Janeiro, the 7th OF March
lsst We found the yellow fever, or something very
closely resembling It, raging to alarming extent
on hore. but more particularly among the shipping
in the harbor The Commodore thought it nsoes-
sary uot to allow any communicat with the shore
and he therefore put this ship and the st Louis soop
Of war in quarantine boat, with provisions for the
officers and crew was tho only one allowed to come
alongside. We remained at Rio just long II
quir.d to get three months stores and then made sail
Tor this port.


We fully convinced that the taken to pre-
vent the infection seizing u.s. would prove efectual
but much to surprise tho fever made its appear
sncs board ship three days out from Rio Pass
ed Midshipman Dance was the first decided case-aud
although he was perfect health before this he died
in few days with all the symptoms both before and
after death. Of yellow fever We have lost two other
Midshipman Ives and Captains clerk Fisher
and two Our doctors report in all 30 cases, only
I've of which have proved fatal.


The rapid and decided change Of temperature from
Rio to this place. has apparently checked the malady
we have not socn single case Of yellow fever
boart, nor IL there any further danger apprehended
for the present Tho Comm sdorc has been extremely
Kind to the sick. Two Of the officers who died wrre
occupying his cabin at the time, some others
Who have since recovered 1t may be consong to the


friends and relatives Of those OF who fell VIC
Tins to the epidemic to know that every attention
paid them in their sickness, and that all that human
aid could do, DONE to them."

 ""The clover upon the ground was in bloom, and altogether, the garden, in it's aspects and associations, was better cal culated than any place know to soothe a troubled spirit. Eight venerable trees, isolated from the smaller and less impo> sing ones which skirt the pass of the Mount of Olives, form a consecrated grove. High above on either hand, tow~ CTS a lofty mountain, with the deep yawning chasm of Jehosaphat between them. Browning one of them is Jerusa- lem, a living city; on the slope of the other is the great Jewish cemetery, a city of the dead.

 ""Each tree in this grove, cankered and gnarled and furrowed by age, yet beautiful and impressive in its decay, is 8 living monuments of the affecting scenes that have taken place beneath and around it. The olive perpetuates itself, and from the root of the dying parent stem, the young tree springs into existence.-- These are accounted one thousand years old. Under those of the preceding growth, therefore, the Savior was wont to rest; and one of the present may mark the very spot where he knelt and prayed and wept.

 No caviling doubt can find entrance here. The geographical boundaries are too distinct and clear for an instant's he's itation. Here the Christian, forgetful oi the present, and absorbed in the past can resign himself to sad yet soothing meditation. The few purple and crim' son flowers, growing about the roots O trees, will give him ample food for med itation, for they tell of the suffering and ensanguined death of the Redeemer."""

This occurred at of the Saturday receptions of
Miss Lynch, who entertains many of the principal
authors and artists in the city, every week in the
season. These sources exceedingly agreeable
and fashionable, and create quite buzz in certain
circles SO much SO, that many inquiries made
with respect to the family of Miss Lynch, who has
given the world many pretty verses, chiefly in the
Spenserian sanza, to which her muse appears to be
welded. 1t is supposed by some, that the poetess
is connected with the old Knickerbocker family Of
Dominic Lynch, but this is quite mistake. She
is scion of one Of the United Irishmen families,
which came over to this country with Emmett and
other distinguished patriots. She has resided in
several New England cities-Hartford, where the
frstlings Of her graceful muse were given to the
world after her school days at Albany were over;
Providence, and, in the summer season, at New
port and other fashionable places-aways drawing
around her the most popular writer's and dstin-
guished persons, by her fascinating manners and
literary accomplishments."

The Lynchburg (Va.) Republican copies the account of the murder, and says:

 ""A friends who recolIects some of the circumstances, informed us that Watson and Musteen lived in Pittsylvania county, Va.; that Mustsen committed a murder (having shot the man in general afray) and swore the crime upon Watson, for which the lat ter was sent 10 the penitentiary, while Mus teen removed 10 Kentucky. Watson re- mained in the pententiary for many years, when 1t was ascertained with certainty that he was an innocent man, and was accord ingly liberated. If these facts be true, Mus teen has received an awful punishment for his monStrOus crime."

lican of January 81 gives the following account OF
this Grant ady's movements. and demeanor in that
city, on Sunday the 9Th, which by means cores
ponds with the description Of her character and hab-
its contained in long statement which we copied
some time ago from the Detroit Advertiser.


She was accompanied by the young man Baker.
Mr.. Jones, keeper Of the hotel at which the twain
pu, up. suspected the identity Of the lady, and made
bold to speak about it to Mr.. Baker


""He at frs, denied their identity, but upon Mr..
Jones proposing to call in gentleman from Staunton
who knew him, declined the honor of an introduction.
He evinced excessive alarm, and appealed Mr. Jones
to know what he had better do under the crcumsan-
ces. Mr. J. declined to advise him, but proposed to
advise Mrs. Miller, to which he readily consented.
Upon entering her room Baker told her she was
Pected Of being Mrs. Miller. Without evincing the
slightest emotion. and calmly winding her guard chain
about her fingers, she very modestly expressed her
inability to understand what meant by the remark.


Mr. Jones explained all the particulars Of the eope-
ment, when she bowed her understanding to the mat
and pleasantly suggested to her paramonr that,
his business was pressing, it would perhaps be best
that he should 90 to Liberty, and let her remain
until his return; that they might take steps to clear
up the unfounded suspicious aoat to their prejudice:
tions, good humoredIy, with the remark that it
matter which did not concern the public, and about
which they alone were accountable to "" Maj. Miller""
and they would therefore proceed together.


Mr.. Jones then entered into conversation with her,
and in the Of it frankly advised her to reace
her steps to her father-,elng her that Baker would
drop her the first occasian that presented ITSELF
and was anxiously waiting such an opportunity, &C.
But she declined MI. is ADVICE and expressed her
self impervious to any suspicion of Bakers fidelity
Mrs. Miller is a small woman, quite pretty, with
pug nose, about thirty years of age, and in an inter.
esting situation.


They received their breakfast and dinner meals in
their room, but after the recognition they marched
tho supper table with quite cheerful exteror-at
least the lady did. but the young man did not rally
from the effects of recognition. Indeed it was ev-
dent that she woman of almost incredible nerve
went to Gainesville by private conveyance. Mr..
Jones wrote Immediately to her father in Detroit,
Michigan"" 1t is said Major Miller is on the track Of
the fugitives."

though he aspircs to wear the mantle OF Mr.. Cal

the lustrous body TO its last resting place.


This is one, and the principal reward which | have
received for devoling days and nights 10 hari aoor,

go in the same car with the body of man almost
worshiped, TO its home, because had served him

in doing this had been connected with the press

"" Maen, TasgralI"" might have been added.


Now for the 1900 which you have received for
advocating the cause OF the South. believe | am
not assuming too much, when say, that your do
ing go has lost you five times that; and that you
have never received . thank you, much less
dollar, from ''southern democrats"" or any other
soni hencrs. | believe you have received southern
subscribers TO the Herald, within the past year,
but whether more than yon would have received in
the ordinary increase of your circulation, do not
know. | know that the successor OF Mr.. Calhoun,
Col. Elmore, as well as MIR. Calhoun himself,
when living, felt interested that you should have
large circulation in the South, and the sentiment is
shared in by every member of the South Carolina
delegation in the House of Representatives, but to
what extent their influence has been cxcrted do
not know.


No respectable person will, for an instant, be-
licve any such foolish charge as that in the Er-
press People know the standing and influence of
the two papers too well. They might believe that
such price as 81 800 could purchase the columns
of the Express, and be a dear purchase at that.
Therefore think the ma jorty OF the people, both
North and South, will come TO the same conclu-
sion which j, who know all the facts connected
with your advocacy of the Southern side, have
come to, and that is, that you have been actuated
by high sense OF duty 10 the interests OF both
North and South, and for the safety of the Union,
by taking such a course in the Herald has
warned the North of their danger, while there was
time to take such measures as would do justice to
the Southern section, and thus prevent disunion.
There is no Northern press but the Herald, that has
taken this wise and far-seeng course; and il il my
solemn belief, that if the present agitation be hap
PLY settled, one most important help which has
contributed 10 such result, has been the course
pursued by the .Ner York Herald, which is daily
read by hundreds of thousands OF rejecting men,
and found in every city, town, village and hamlet
throughout the whole United States. do but JUS
tice you in making this simple narrative, and in
closing, will add, that my mite in the great move.

equality in the Union, could not have been given
