 The opinion, entertained of Gen. Harrson by Gen Cass, late Secretary of War and now Minister to France, may be found in the North American Review No. 30, page 97. Gen. Cass Is known to be the au- thor of that interesting article, in which he says:

 Bank q the United States.-It IS generally known that the present administration justified the destruction of the Bank of the United States on the ground of its insolvency in the repeated declaration that the money belonging to the Government was lost.

Lynch's Latc.-We scarcely know how to. notice a transaction which occurred at Fay- cite, in this county, on Saturday night last. Our readers will recOl!ect that some time since we noticed the murder of MT. MtGOw- an by man named Spinney that he was. arrested and lodged in jail 10 await his trial. It came on at the last term of the Circuit Conr'' but owing ["" some informality in the F'hoctmtnt (the true cause of all these diff culttes) ne was remandrd to prison to appear | at the next session of the court. Instead of awaiting the time allotted for his second triah l and giving him once more the uncertain chan ces cf the law for his condemnation, num- ber of the citizens of Fayette and neghbor- hood went en mosse, (after having been refus- ed by the keeper the keys of the jail.( and broke open the doors with sledge hammers, seized the unfortunate wretch, and hung him instanter. The cause, we understand, of this summary proceeding arose out of the fact that Spinney had been heard to assert that f an opportunity was given him he would, with. undying revenge, foIlow up all who had been instnt,mental in his conviction.

 r Destructive Fire.-About 4 o'clock yester- day morning, an alarming fire broke out in, Mulberry Street, in the range of buildings, Eoceupicd-by the methodist Society as libra. Try. BOokbindery, and trart establishments very soon after the alarm of fire was given, most of the city engines were in requisi!ion i; but alt their efforts were unavailing. and the four story brick buildings were totally con- sumed. They were 125 feet in front. ands when the gable at the eastern wing fell, it brought down the frame building No. 96,. with horrid crash. The numbers of the, houses consumed were, lO4, l02, 100, and. 98. AHthe buildings were literally crammed with books, and other cumbustibles, and the, | flames. in consequence, extended their rdvd- ges sooner than they otherwise would have, dOne-sOOn after the fire broke out, the flames. communicated with frame building attached to coal yard at tbe opposite side of tho street, andit vas soon leveIIrd with the ground. It was owing, solely. to the unremitted exer- tions of the frenen, that the devourlng eIe- ment was kept within the limits which we have described. The scene which presented 1 itself, immediately before :he orental dawn, was terrifcay grand. The entire lot of bull dings in front was crumbpd 10 ruins. and the fall indeed was great. The houses were very high, and the flames, to all appearance, reach ed the skies. It is n""t accurately ascrrtain- ed. how the fire originated; but it is known 1 that the flames first appeared in the second. story, about the centre of the lot. and the en- tire building was soon enveIoped in Aames.-- The only injury done by the fire is that which we have described; but, the falling of the l high and massive walls crushed several rear buildings to the ground.

 MT. WIse's Speech.-UpOn introducing his resolu. tiOns into Congress for exaihinatOn into the van- OuS departments of government to ferret out the sour of corruption, fany exist. Mr. Wise delivered one O the most caustc speeches ever pronounced before delbe+ative assembly. We should be glad that all readefs could peruse it entt but as is incOn. venicn for us to publish it at present, have avaed ourselves ofa brief sketch of prepared for the N Y. Star. See the preceding page.

 TIE LEcisLATURE.-Unti yesterday morning we were in receipt of the proceedings only up to Friday morning last. We now have them to Monday after. noon; but are obliged to omit them this week. Itwas only until Monday that the Committee respecting the surplus revenue made their report It was then ac. cOmpanied by bill-the general provisions of which are-as stated by the New.Haven Herald-""That the money shall be deposited with the several towns in the Sate in proportion to their respective population as asceraned by the last census-ihat those towns which have recently been incorporated the disrbu- t,ol shall be made i1 reference to new census which snail De taken for that purpoec-that the towns shall keep the money as depost& in trlist for the State, and annually appropriate at least one half the inter- est to the support of common schools and the remain held responsible for any loss that may occur and a- be to repay the money to the State whenever called for-each town to make fund of the principal to be of each town to have the custody of this fund.- un- til an agent shall be appointed by the civil authority and selectmen of each town, upon whom shall devolve its management""

 The Senate have also reported bill for the distri- button of the revenue, not varying materially from A. G. A.. ald however, there had been as yet but little discus. sion upon the merits of the bill and should not be surprised nearly the whole of this week should be ta. ken up in the discussion of their merits That the f. action will be in accordance with the report of the House, we entertain very little doubt. We understand that the recommendation of his Ex. the Governor to attach the money to the School Fund.- meets with ve. few advocates in either house of the legislature or even of the members of the third house. Another week will probably close the labors of the legislature. CoH.-The mercury yesterday morning stood de. grees below o-the lowest this season.

 Neac- York Election-G Glorious Result !-It will be remembered that at the November election in the city of New-York, there were six Wings and six Tories elected to the Assembly, and that for the thirteenth there was tie between the two next highest candi. dates new election was accordingly ordered on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, and each party had up their candidate and it affords us hieh qualification to announce to readers that result cd in the choice of the Whg candidate (Franklin) by majority of about l9O0! This too in the city of York, which has heretofore been the strong hold and backbone of Van Burensm or rather of Jackson. ism. It should be remembered, however, that small vote was polled, compared with what the city can dos but it shews that the whgs length disposed to take up at the business of attending the pos and not siasfar nM Oieesis~S 50 e6ant tvr by xlpfzult. IT this does not augur we'll for the Spring City Election we know not what can.

 ""Apatky! Apafhy !""-We wonder if the Hartford Times and its hrelng prostuted echos in other parts of this state will not raise the cry of apathy re. spectng the NewYork city election claim that the whgs ""with the advice of Truman Smith,"" stole the march upon their enemies unawaTes, withou. giving them ""due and timely nOtce."" They have got sick ot the cry ss regards this state and now may resort to 1t to cover their waning fortunes elsewhere The President transmitted to Congress on the 2lst inst special message upon the ect of our rela- tons with Texas. It is not very long; still we have not room for this week; besides we do not consider of very great consequence-it s only carrying out in detail the principles which he slightly touched upon in the annual message. It takes the g.ound-and in our v'ew m this case the correct groInd-that it is not best in the present state of that country for this gov. enment to interfere in her affairs by recognizing her independence or otherwise recommending, indeed, the same course of policy which has been heretofore pursued respecting the various South American Pro- vincesEhat of strict neutrality until their independ ence shall be acknowledged by the power against which they are warning

 The Presdents healah by the las. aecouXs, is con. siderably improved and it is now believed he may re. sufficiently at least to attend to public business. We are glad to bear it-6r we desire ever witness the time when the Vice Presdent-elected as such shall be called upon to administer the affairs of gov.

Executive Department, jackson, July %, 1886,


Whereas, / have this day received a
cd lion from Major General Gaines,
ID of June, from the information
detailed Ia which, there seems to be lille
doubt lhat the war between The MeNcans
and Texans is row raging, and has, or will
assume a highly sanguinary and eXteFm-
Mating character. Some of our citizens
have already been killed BY the Indians,
and further hostilities are to be npprehend-
ed With a view Of preventing this, he has
called upon me for ten companies Of mount
ed volunteers; and in compliance with this
requisition, /, CHARLES LYNCH, Gov
ernor Of the State Of Mississippi, do issue
this, my proclamation, calling upon and So
Letting my iellow-citizens TO turn out, to
form and organise themselves into comPa-
nies, and march with the least possible de-
lay TO aid this wary and veteran comman-
der in maintaining inviolate our national
neutrality--to stay the work of desolation,
and to preserve our borders from a threaten-
ed, destructive, and savage warfare,


The citizens Of Mississippi have, on all
occasions, manifested a zeal and alacrity in
relieving their fellow-sufarers, affording the
most brilliant examples of philanthropy,
chivalry and patriotism. The fact of our
border citizens having bled, and their ex-
posed condition to the merciess savage, is
an appeal that am satisfied will be res
ponded to by the most expeditions prepara-
ton and march to the scene of action The
Executive will feel the highest qualification,
and will witness such movement with
pride and exultaton, and nothing shall be
wanting on his part to facilitate the expedi-
ton,


The companies raised in the first division
will report themselves to Major Gen, A. P
Cunningham; those in the second and third
divisions to Major General Ii. w. Dunlap
of the third division, at Clinton, and those
in the fourth division to Major General f.
L. Acoe, at Columbus, The Major Gene
GALS will cause the companies Of their res
pective divisions to be marched to Vicks.
burg by the 18th of August next, where
they will be furnished with forage, rations
and camp equipage, necessary for the expe
pition, and proceed to elect one Colonel
Commandant, one Lieutenant Colonel, and
one Major to command the regiment The
volunteers enrolled under this requisition
are expected to serve for six months, aiel
their arrival at Fort Josup, where they will
be mustered into the service of the United
States.


In testimony whereof ! have hereunto set
my hand, and caused to be aliixed-the great

Mr.. BRooKs, in one Of hs late letters
from Europe, thus speaks;


""Newspapers are precloIs and scarce.
The postage is immense. A stray Galg-
mani IAN English newspaper riniedin Paris,
may now and then be seen and the sight
of one is a precious treasure but almost all
learn from the United Staes is in the little
journals of Italy which are about as large as
one-eighth part ofthe National lnteligencer
oiWashington, They tel me the Union is
breaking up that riots and rows are desc
lating the whole land; that the slaves are
rebeIiing and that servile war Is threat
atened. And they rejoico loudly as thoy
hold up this admontion of the folly ofanen
attempting to govern themselves. Ndhing
so much delights them as this last dsmon-
straton, as they call it of the impossbility
of republic, even when founded undr the
most favorable circumstances. The lynch
laws particularly delight them. The Mis-
sissippi gamblers, lynched as they were,
are nevertheless compensated VITA an
immortality in every despol's in Journal
IN Europe. The slave missionaries are
wearing a crown of glory here, as martyrs
ola mad democracy. How true alithese
things are, have no means of telling; for
all see is in the little Italian journals,
which are particularly occupied with such
of our affairs as tend to discredit all repub-
lican institutions. And, perhaps, one Of
the greatest pleasures, of travelling is to
read such news of ones own country in
foreign land, particularly when it proba-
bic that all is at least founded on fact. The
Emperor of Austria, it is said, has seized
this occasion to inspire his Italian subjects
with horror of all republican institutions,
by making it optional with some State pris-
oners, in ltaIy-whether they will choose
the punishment of death at home, or banish-
ment TO the United Statssl''"

 detaIned for that purpose. The army re-

 mained upon the East bank of the river day

 and a half, when having learned that the

 enemy had made movement towards Har- risburg, they made forced march, and the fourth day crossed Buffalo Bayou, three miles l below the town. which the enemy had laid i in ashes. The Mexicans had continued their march and burnt New Washington, and were returning up the San Jaeinto to cross the river at Lynch's Ferry, when on the 18th ut. their advance, to their suprisa. fell in 1 with small parties of the Fexians. On :bc 25th tha two armies were encamped within mile of each other-the 1exan above and l the Mexican bslow Lynci's Ferry. tn the same day there was sharp conflict between the Iexlan cavalry oRd body of, the enemy, cavalry and lafantry, six or eight times their members. When the conflict had terminat ed most of the Iexian infantry was literally angry that the General had not permitted them to take part in the engagement, feeling confident that they could have annihilated the enemy-which consisted of about 7gO men, and was commanded by Santa Anna in person. Early the next morning General Cos lolned Santa Anna with strong rein torcement, by forced march!

 Never did m II engage in battle with a f1fnef determination to cdnquer or die. They had nothing to hope of mercy from the per fidious and cruel enemy. They had no hope of lfe-but in victory.

 The namber of the Mexican arIiisv was es- tiinated at from l150 to 1500 men. The Tex ian forces are estimated at from 6l0 to 7SO men. The sick, the lazy and the cowardly had been left behind in the forced march. and found several ofmy friends who had no oth CT apparel but that which they had upon their persons, and had not even blankets to cover t.issss d night. On ttc 2 IIsstt Isst d o'clock P N. the Iexlaii army marched out of their en- campnent to attack the enemy They had two pieces of small iron artillery, a present from the citizens of Cineinnat-57 cavalry, oo0 regulars and volunteers armed with mus kets and bayonets, and the residue were arm- ed With rifles and belt pistols. The Mexi- cans were eneamped on high prairie, with their right resting in a cedar thicket upon the border of lake connected with the San Ja- cinto river. The division of Cos was about Io0 yards in the rear of their front line. rest ing in careless security after their forced march. The Texian army taking advantage of the undulations of the ground, approached and placed themselves in line 3 or 400 yards Tn front of the enemy in the open prairie, and advanced upon the enemy. The General rode III front of the line, and gave the first order to fire upon the enemy.

 he enemy fired their cannon five times 1 only. 1t was loaded the sixth time and pfi- med--the man who held the match was killed by a boy and the piece taken. It Is splen- did brass nine pounder, bearing the inserip. tions s'El olcan, and 'sViolati ftilmna Re- gis, i'll Roman capital letters. The cannon was taken and the enemy put to route nine teen minutes after the fist gun was fired. The slaughter among the enemy's ranks was tremendous. 1 took a deliberate look over the ield three days after the battle. The sight was horrible. Here lying in clusters, there scattered singl5--tlie ground was stfewed with dead mon, dead horses, guns, bayonets, swords, drums, trumpets--some Shattered and broken--books, papers. shoes, sandals, caps--the chaos of roufsd army was streRed nfe.. the gsreand-in c..fusie.. which the imagination cannot conceive--the natural eye must behold to be convinced of the reality.

 The faces of most ofthe dead were as black ! as negroes-horribly swollen and distorted-- the tongues protruding--the skin bistered- the limbs in many instances Swollen, eleya- ted and half extended--horrble and disrdst- ing masses of corruption.

 When the Texian army made the charge, the shouts of Alamo! Alamo.! Alamon, filled 1 the air--braccd the hearts of the assailants to avenge the death of their deceased friends while the hearts of the enemy quailed with the conscious guilt Of the cruel massacre of brave men, and the dread of the day of yen geance having come. The shouts of Alamol Travis! Crockett! Fannin! were terrible to the enemy as the trump which may call the gull ty to their final account.

 Of the whole right wing of the enemy one man only escaped death. They were slaugh- tered, and finally driven.into the water, and the rifles ceased not their crack willie an ob- ject appeared above the surface of it.

 The left wing of the enemy fled in confus- ed order, commanded by Col; Almonte, and laid down their arms and surrendered to small body of cavalry, two miles from the battle field.

 The number of the enemy's killed is esti- mated at about roo, and the prisoners taken amount to above 50O-inore than two hundred ofthem wounded. There are 42 officers pri- soners, including Almonte, Cos, and Santa Ana himself.

 :, Santa Ana was taken the day after the bat tie, about 10 miles above, in the woods, in mean citizens dress. and did not make him. self known until he was taken into the pre- sence of Gen. Houston, to whom he immedi- ately offered feast of soft corn.

 You will be gratificd by a description of Santa Ana's person. His forehead is high, but narrow in front; spreading as 1t extends back obliquely- ly-hairmoderately black--smaII whiskers, little mixed with grey. Theskin wrinkles on the lower part of his forehead as ..4oe trs Ifa In Ia r,r,"
