of Caddo parish, has not yet heard OF the
new resolutions which were adopted by
the Democratic members of the Legisla-
ture while we had company from abroad
staying with us. For we see that in a mo-
ment of passion he made an attack with
two pistols upon unarmed Allen Walker,
colored, for the purpose of settling law
suit which the courts had just decided
against Dan in Aliens favor. The press
report is thus:


For some time past there has been
lawsuit existing between Monroe and
Walker, and the cause was decided against
Monroe, who thereupon drew revolver
and remarked that he would settle the
case finally, then and there, and COM
menced firing on Allen Walker. he fired
four shots without effect, when Walker
closed in on him, and being better man,
physically, than his antagonist, succeeded
in wrenching the pistol from him, at the
same crying Murder murder !"" when
Monroe got away from him, and, stepping
back few PAGES, drew another pistol and
fred again on Walker, the ball taking
effect in the abdomen. DR.. Allen was
sent for and, after an examination of the
wound, pronounced it dangerous if not
fatal. Walker was alive at last accounts,
Dan Monroe is still at large, but will be
arrested if he has not already been taken
into custody. The shooting occurred In
the Justices Office.


Now, though the bulldozer proper al
ways scrupulously limits his homicidal
attentions to political opponents, and
looks with horror upon the lower creature
who murders for pelf or selfinterest, yet
he can not be held entirely blameless for
Monroe's fault. For he has himself set
the example of resorting to arms for what
the laws would deny him, but which he
covets nevertheless. The bulldoEer lynch
es the prisoner in Jail because he wants
him killed before the lapse of time a.
lowed by law, or perhaps because he is
not sure the evidence will be sufficient to
convict. He shoots the colored man on
the way to vote, not because he is COL
ored, but because he is a Republican, or
he shoots him at the ballot box for voting
in defiance of ''the wishes of the people. !""
The bulldozer is thoroughly informed of
the ''wishes of the people, and will not
see them thwarted without making a fuss
about it.


Monroe has only extended this practice
trife. He probably thought that his
defeat in a court of law by a negro was
such an insult to the white blood of this
community, and withal SO detrimental to
his pecuniary interests, as to demand
blood. He, therefore, took an appeal
from the justice, whipped out pistol No.
l, and began vigorously to try his case in
a court where he was pretty sure of JUS
tioe, especially as poor Allen Walker had
no pistol and he had two. He gained his
case. His antagonist is believed to be
mortally wounded, and he is himself o
fugitive for few days, or until the thing
blows over. The paper from which we
quote, however, assures Dan that he will
be arrested, if he has not been already.
But we have our doubts about his ever
receiving much punishment. The regu-
lar buildozers will scold and threaten
him, peIhaps, and if his victim dies the
Governor may possibly issue proelama-
ton. And that will be the end of it.

a large and fashionable audience greeted
the appearance of ex-Vice President COlfaX at
the Opera House last evening foe the purpose
OF listening 10 the lecture given by the distin-
guished gentleman on the life o: Abraham
Lincoln. The speaker was introduced by eS-
Senator Alex Caldwell, who, in his own pc""u-
liarly happy way, made both speaker and au-
dience feel at home.


Mr.. Colfax began with rapid review OF the
the Martyr President and followed his career
down to the time of the assassination IN a
forcible and eloquent manner which was full
ly appreciated by his listeners. His style of
speech which Is at times hurried is witha
one TO claim and holi the attention OF any
audience.


He spoke OF Mr.. Lincoln as he had known
him personally and in one instance described
him as being las tender hearted rs 4 woman
and as brave as the bravesg.''


Born as he was OF humble pa:entage in
Kentucky he had carved for himself name
in history which WAS tie pruudeSt
in the land and when the mGr,!cre5
hand had sent him 10 the eternal world, it Is
with pride we can remember that ne carried
with him, to the portals of tie beyond, the

beings freed from the thraidom of slavery.
When lie left for his etcrua, home he left our

day mornings TINES, the young men as
| sembled at the old market house for the pur-
pose of forming Club that would support
p. q. Lowe, for Sheriff. To shov that public
| opinion goes with the right was fully verified
by the concourse of people that assembled
there last night. The large hall being pack
ed with a mass of humanity, many being
unable TO gain admittance. At half-past
seven the meeting was called to order by
Fred W. Willard, who nominated Scott Ash
ton, for temporary chairman. Mr.. Ashton
was elected without opposition, and upon
taking the chair spoke of the objects Of the
Club. During his remarks he said that this
Club was not formed asa


PURELY DEMOCRATIC ORGANIZATION,


but one that wanted to see an honest sheriff
elected that it was optional with any mem-
ber OF the Club who he voted for, with the ex-
ception of Hon. p. q. Lowe and every person
who signed their names as members OF the
Club, would consider IL as an obligation and
that 1t was a written promise that they woald
vote for that gentleman. AT the close of Mr.
Ashtons remarks Thos Z. Gable moved that
committee of five be appointed
by the chair for the purpose
of selecting the permanent officers of
the CLUB. 1he committee consisted OF j.
&. Vogie, J. J. Nevens, Chas. Currier, Eugene
Chaplu and Frank 4. Lynch. After mature

ding officer, made a very neal speech, further
extending the fame of T.. u. Lowe an hon
est man.

lowing: Eugene Chaplin, Chairman Frank

After the officers and committees were ap-
pointed and elected, Hon Thos. =. FenlOn,
called upon To address the Club. Mr..
FenlOn took the stand and said that he had
not prepared himself TO address the meeting;
that many things OF the past came before
him as he thought OF the time that he assi>t.d
in forming a Young Mems Political Club ill
tire same room, eighteen years ago, he could
hardly find words 10 express his feelings, hut
lac was happy TO know that the young men %
this city had taken enough interest in tine
public good TO form an organization 10 assist
IN electing pure man 10 Office, but he said
he WAS for the whole ticket and while rec
ommending one man, would have TO speak ""A
good word r the whole Democratic ticket.
He did so, and closed his speech by saving
that the club had his ID st wishes and
should have his hearty cooperation iu the
fight, that they had just commenced. Mr..
Fenlon's remarks were frequently applauded.


At the close of Mr.. FeniOn's speech, Mr..
Lowe having entered the room he was called
upon for a speech. lie took the stand and
said he was not ""A speech maker ana even III
he was, he did not know he would be- able
to address ""a meeting where there was 50
much interest manifested for himself, aud a.
Ter thanking the members OF the Club lor
their manifestations hu took his seat.


Hon. II L. Green WAS then called upon and
made one of his chaTacti>tic speeches; keep
ing the vast audience in roar of laughter
most of the time During his remarks he
said that he was a OrecnbIck man; that he
had been in their late Convention, but he
knew that when election day came, they
We aid turn they did in the ohio election,
and vote the Democratic ticket. His a'lu-
siOns to he number Of Greenback men in tins
city was very humorous and called forth
rounds of applause.


Mr.. Green was followed by Eugene Chaplin,
who made telling speech IN favor of L. q.
Lowe, and said although he was a cand date
before the late Democratic Convention for
the same Office he thought that Mr.. Lowe
was the man that deserved the nomination
and was glad he got IL.


Hon. Byron Sherry the next speaker
and delivered one Of the most eloquent
speeches that has ever been listened III
this city. II was panorama of fine rhetoric
and telling argument. He dwelt upon the
Clubs candidate for sh riff and advanced
facts that no one can gainsay. His speech
was listened To with rapture and applause
and when he closed loud cries were heard of

MEAT""


From the Nashville A'aertcpt,
About hslt-past 12 o'clock last night, q;
MIR. Casper Kuhn was approaching the stor,
of Mise Mary Kuhn, h.s sister, on NORTH
Summer street, near Monroe, he noticed
that the gas lamps on each side of the build
lug had been turned down. This aroused
his suspicious. He had no sooner entered
the yard than he saw u man trying TO bore
through one of tue shutters. Mr. Kuhn al
once opened fire, and the bsrglHr dashe
out of the gate aud along North Summer
street. The pistol shot had not been heard
by policeman Broderick aud Tindall, who
were near the corner OF Monroe and North
Summer streets. As the burglar came
dashing along Officer BroderIck ordered
him to halt, and the command not being
obeyed followed 1t with shot. The man
was then about ten yards off, aud as be
came up was collared by the two police
man.


The officers had hardly frightened their
grip upon the prisoner before, as II by
magic, they were surrounded by thirty or
fDrtv excited men. How they got there SO
quickly the policeman say is puzzle to
them One OF them who had handkerchief
tied over the upper part OF his face sa d
hercely: ""This man is our meat"" mo
put In Broderick, she is ours you must
not interfere with officers ofIhe law"" Give
HIM to us, or you are a dead man."" de
manded the unknown, aud as he spoke his
pistol was poked into Broderick's face. The
officers saw that resistance was useless !:
they were overpowered aud understood that
tue crowd meant business.


In half the time it takes to write this, a
rope was thrown over the burglars head
aud he was dragged off along North Sum
mer, then down Madison street to the
river. DR.. Haggard followed the lynchers,
but was warned off when he reached the
bluff. He distinctly heard LOUD shriek.
splash, and then all was quiet. The bur
glar had met his fate In the Cum berland."

Men Droauned-Ihe Flood Steadily


Subsiding.


RICHMOND, Nov. 20.


kilograms received this morning say
that the Petersburg and Weldon Railroad
bridge at Weldon, N. G. is gone; also
three spans of tho Seabord and Roanoke
Railroad bridge at the same place. The
Roanoke river is very high. The water
has risen three feet since 7 O'Clock this
morning, and it is expected that the last
named bridge will be entirely swept away
Travel South via the Petersburg ana
Weldon, road is interrupted. Communi-
cation with Norfolk via the Seabord and
Roanoke Railraad is still perfect.


The river at this point has fallen five
feet up to this hour CO P. M and is
steadily subsiding,and it is expected that
by tomorrow night the streets will be
clear. The inundated part of the city
presents scene of great devastation.-
The losses to private property cannot be
fully ascertained, but can be safely esti-
mated at from $4,000 to $400, 200, and
other losses will greatly augment this
amount. The damage in Manchester, on
the opposite side of the river, will prob>
ably reach 100000. There is much suf-
fering among the poor people, who have
been washed out. Many had to camp out
last night, and are still shelterless.-
Mayo's bridge across the James river was
the only one that succumbed TO the flood
All the railroad bridges crossing the riv-
er here are intact. Reports from the
James river and Kanawha canal indicate
that serious damagehas been done, though
not so bad as at first supposed. Several
breaks of from fifty to seventy feet are
reported, and the tow path was badly
washed in number of places. W. L.
Allen, keeper of the locks nine miles
from Richmond, was drowned yesterday;
also Andrew OVERLY, a carpenter at the
Danville Railroad shops, who fell into
the river here while working to save
railroad bridge. No other casualties
have been reported from any point.
LYNcHBURa, Nov. 26.-The river
has gone down to within three or four
feet of the ordinary level, contrary to
general to expection. The telegraph
wires are still down east, west, and
south. 1t is impossible to estimate
the damage sustained. The Amherst
bridge, 900 feet in length, erected af-
ter the flood of 1870, was swept away
on Saturday night, and with it two
new iron bridges OF the Atlantic, Mis-
sisslppi and Ohio Railroad below the
city, the latter erected at a cost of
$4,000. Four bridges on the same
road, between Bonsacks aud Big
| Spring, were swept away. The road
| ""A mo nod haf Ua fhnaA nnInfQ
but is intact from Bristol to Christian
burg.


Trains are now running from Nor
folk to Concord depot, whence passen-
gers are transported to Lynchburg in
stages. Heavy damage has been done
on the Lynchburg and Danville ex-
tension of the Virginia Midland road.
The Staunton river bridge and trestle
at Galveston is seriously damaged.
There is considerable break in the
canal above the city, and the damage
west of here is reported to be more
serious than that of 1870. LynchbHrg
is now isolated and it is difficult to Sc
cure intelligence.


WAsH1N aToN, Nov. 26.-At 3 O'Clock
this morning the Southern express
train crossed the bridge over the cas-
tern branch of the Potomac through
eighteen inches of water. AT that
hour most Of the streets between
Pennsylvania avenue and the river
were submerged. The engines CT the
Fire Department are to-day pumping
out Easements overhowed by the re-
cent rains. All along the river front,
Including Georgetown, the loss of
property is very great. The river is
filled with wood barrels, parts of
bridges, shanties from the upper Po-
tomac. A large number of men and
boys were out in skiffs capturing the
floating property. One boy captured
three barrels of whisky, and others
were alike fortunate with flour."

When the Hilton-Seligman trouble
occurred | thought the administration
would attempt to found new party
on it. The Indians, the Mormons, the
Mexicans, Civil Service Reform, and
home rule in the South have all been
used but the response has not seemed
to be, in any case, what was anticipat-
ed. Secretary Thompson's book on the
Catholic Church, though it sold we'll
did not furnish material upon which
political party could be based. But
here was an incident at once national
in its Importance and sensational in its
character, and having within itself
mixture Of religion, politics, trade and
finances. Here was a golden oppor-
tunisy.


But l learn that Presidential hope
in another direction has revived, and
that the belligerent New Yorkers will
have to seek immol ality from other
than ADM 'stration hands. Phe Pres
ident has renewed faith in the South.
His proposed visit, expected to extend
as far as New Orleans, has caused
Southern business men and politicians
Of high and low degree to extend prom
ises Of welcome which month ago,
the President had no reason to expect.
Strangely enough he connects these
evidences Of hospitable intent with his
own pet political projects, and sees in
the expected crowds at the railroad
stations the voters who are to train un-
der his party banner. He will be
rudely undeeeired, but if his faith
shall prevent his injecting the Jew into
our politics, with the negro, indian,
Mormon and Mexican, we ought to be
grateful for his delusion. He will be-
gin his Southern swing around the cir
Gle in time to get back here before
Congress meets. The first fight will
be over the Speakership Of the House.


The name of Hon. John Lynch,
formerly Of Maine, is connected with
the proprietorship of a new admins
tration paper here. Mr.. Lynch was,
l believe, one of the founders of the
Portland Press, and the success of that
paper is spoken of as proof that he
possesses the necessary ability to in
sure success to the new enterprise.
But if remember Alright the Press was
started under peculiarly favorable cir
cumstances, such as almost compelled
success.


Mr. Lynch will need to go down
deep in his eapacious pockets to estab-
lish an acceptable morning paper,
whatever its politics, in this city.


By the way, the National Republican
has evidently passed under new edi-
torial control. There is a marked i'm
provement in the paper of late. The
financial difficulties Of its proprietor
caused him a few weeks ago to mort
gage the establishment for nearly its
full value to VIM. E. Chandler of New
Hampshire, and parties represented BY |
Chandler New Hampshire influence
is making itself felt here Just now.


The Unitarians of the District YES
terday laid the corner stone of a new
church edifce. It will probably be |
this season. Their old build |
ing was to be leased to the Police
Court, and made den of thieves, but

county, Texas, was noted in these col
umns lately. A fuller account says
that he was DR.. J. s. Russell, an old
and respectable resident. He was a
bitter opponent to Christianity, and
his crowning offense against the pre-
vailing religious sentiment was lee
ture against the divinity of Oh rist. A
mob of believers took him from his
bed at night, dragged him into the
woods, tied him to a tree, and gave
him a hundred lashes with a raw
hide. Previous to. the whipping, the
spokesman of the party said: 1--WE
know you are an honest man and a
good physician, but we will tolerate
no infidels in Bell county; so by the
help of God, we will stop your career
of infidelity."" A written notice was
posted Oh the tree, that infidelity in
Rell county would in the future be
punished by hanging. There is no in
timation of any charge against DR..
Russell, except that of antagonism to
christianity. The lynchers were COM

a late law enacted by the Virginia legis-
lature regulating the sale of liquor in
bar-rooms operates. What is called
registering apparatus was provided for in
the act, and is described as follows by the
Lynchburg Virginian: q On one side is a
crank, and on another dials like those of
a gas meter. The bar-keeper turns the
crank round at every sale of drink, a
bell strikes, and the dial registers ere.
The object of the device is to determine
the amount of tax to be collected, at the
rate of one cent on every drink. AL
though a heavy fine may be imposed for
neglect to use these machines properly,
or for tampering with them in any way
and there are officers whose duty it is
to detect such ofienses-the belief is that
they will not answer the purpose, because
drinkers will generally connive at viola
tions of the law."

delay Id settling the Louisiana ques-
tion should rest upon the executive or
Legislative branch OF the legal govern
ment Of the State. A community OF
eight hundred thousand people. with
their vast commercial, property and IN


dustrial interests, are on the verge Of
anarchy, and every horr that this peril
ous and extraordinary situation 10 pro-
longed causes incalculable loss; invites
TO his fell work the murderer. the rob-
ber and the incendiary, and encourages
the institution OF Lynch law. TO any
extent that this state Of things is pro-
longed, the responsibility should rest


upon the Federal Administration,


whose hand Of power instituted 1t. Our


local government should extend its pro-


tecting hand to every nook and corner


OF the State, and vigorously manifest


its power to the point where 1t may


meet with repression from the Federal
arm.


This is the feeling OF the great mass OF
the people who are growing impatient,
and demand that they shall have gov
ernment which can, without its author.
ity being questioned, protect society,
enforce the laws and dispense justice.


When II was announced Saturday that
the Legislature would proceed Monday
to elect O United States Senator, there
was a general feeling Of rejoicing among
the people. They feltencouraged when
they learned that step calculated to
assert the existence of their govern
ment before the American Senate was
to be taken. On Sunday after
noon, when 1t was learned that
the Legislative caucus which had
Assem- bled earlier in the day, had re-
solved to take no definite step, there
was universal feeling of disappoint-
ment and we may almost say disgust.
The desire OF the people is, that the
Legislature hall act In this important
matter without delay.


The government Of which the Legis-
lature Ia part Ii as much the govern
ment OF Louisiana as the government
OF Governor Robinson is the govern
ment Of New York, and the Legislature
should act upon that theory. The Legis-
lature Of Massachusetts,, or OF Vermont.
or OF any other State In the Union would
resent as an impertinence any dicta-
tion In such matter as this from poll
ticians In Washington. It is sad sight
indeed to see the Legislature OF q free
State. in republican country, hesltat-
ing to perform one OF It's most important
duties and listening with eager ears to
learn what effect aetion or non-action
will have upon the disposition OF the
President towards them, and discussing
the policy OF eleeting man to one Of
the highest and most honorable posi-
tions In the State, because his politics
are different from those of the people
the Legislature represents.


IL there Is any reason to leave this
State still longer without her rightfnl
representation in the United States
Senate other than apprehension that
we may disturb the equananimity OF the
tempers OF Blaine and Morton, or that
we may elect to that position some man
who has not been compatriot Of the
thieves who have plundered us for eight
years, and thereby affront somebody in
Washington, we have not heard OF 1t.


As for our part, and we believe we
speak the opinions Of nine.tenths
of the people, we think the Leg
islature should proceed Immediately
with this business. We think 1t should
ignore all dictation from Washington,
choose that man among our fellow-citi-
zens whose abilities, integrity and devo
ton to the liberties and material inter-
ests best fits him to represent the State
in the Senate, and most entities him
to the reward conferred in the bestowal
of public confidence and high political
honors. -"

Social pressure was brought to bear, an ener- getic canvass begun, and newspapers were boug!t mp or new ones founded; for the main ,...lv of the whites were still dis posed to hesitate. ''We had better wait, ' said they, land see how things go in the North. If the democrats carry the elec- tions there in November, and get control of the national government, why, of course, we can rise up and throw off re- publican rule in the State But we have good government now, and had best let we'll enough alone. for fear our old op- pression might be re-established. But the work went on. At the Fort Moultrie centennial thousands of Confederate sol- diers. once more under arms, were parad- ed before the people of the State. Wade Hampton was their captain. Hot South ern speeches were made, and the troops in attendance from Georgia, disgusted at the unwonted spectacle of negroes in office, rode rough-shod over the colored police of Charleston. Mir. Tilden had just been nominated at St. Louis, and the brilliant prospects of electing him were triumphantly paraded. Then came race conflicts: the killing of colored legisla- tor in Darlington County, the lynching of two negroes in Marlboro and six in Edge field, and finally the Hamburgh massacre. This last and the governors action con- corning it were followed by appeals to the whites, made with all the old vehemence of Carolinians. Everybody was urged to buy arms; rifle clubs and mounted com panies were everywhere formed, the young men being cheered on to joln them; and the old system of browbeating and chal- lenging all on-conformists to the duello was vigorously put in operation.

 The whites in the old Ku-Klux coun- ties, where the negroes are in the minor ity, turned ovef CD naassc to the revolu- tionary policy; in the other counties they held back for a' long time, ~disconraging g violence as likely to hurt Tilden in the North, as being, in Short, premature. But gradually they half fell, were half driven into line; though not all; for when the state democratic convention met on August 18th there was still powerful minority (about two fifths) in favor of postponing action until it should be seen what the republicans would do about Chamberlain. It Is useless to say, how ever. that the majority carried their point. General Wade Hampton, the Murat of the Confederacy, in whom are crystalized all the arrogant old plantation qualities of the South, was nominated for gover- nor with corresponding ticket. It was determined to carry the State by the method known as the Mississippi Plan.

 I will merely summarize the means used; was ln the State during the whole campaign, and know whereofI speak. The plan was, first, to arouse the white popu- lation to secession or notification mad ness; next to get as many negroes as pos sible to vote the democratic ticket, and prevent as many as possible from voting the republican; and finally, to put such 8 face on their dOings as to work no harm to the democratic cause outside the State.

 In the first matter they thoroughly suc- ceeded. General Hampton, an orator of no mean order, an accomplished gentle man sprung from the best Carolina stock, our greatest and most celebrated soldier, in company with numerous other ex-Con. federate generals and officers (among ciadng fi ffoombs, Hf aG4dth G4dtheEo eEofsdt5atss fsdt5atss j9 iR: gan a systematic canvass of the State, speaking at every county town and at oth- CT place of size. Such delirium as they aroused can be paralelled only by itself even in this delirious State. Their whole tour was vast triumphal procession; at every depot they were received by tre- mendous concourse of citizens and es- corts of cavalry. Their meetings drew the whole white population, male and fe- male (for the ladies turned out by tens of thousands to greet and listen to the heroic Hampton) for scores of miles around, and had to be held invariably ln the open air, They were preceded by processions of the rife clubs, mounted and on foot, miles in length, marching amidst the strains of music and booming of cannon; at night there were torchlighr processions equally imposing. The speak CTS aroused in thousands the memories old, and called on their hearers to redeem the grand old State and restore it to it's ancient place of honor in the republic. The widest cheering followed. The en- thusiasm, as Confederate veterans press ed forward to wiring their old generals hand, was indescribable Large columns of mounted men escorted. the canvassers from place to place while off the railroad They were entertained at the houses of leading citizens, held receptions attended by all the wealth, intelligence, and brill lance of the community, and used all the vast social power they possessed to help on the work.

 Beside this, the fearful memories of the days were revived. The governors participation in them was ma asserted. The acknowledged fact that the mass of the negroes had oppo- sed his reforms was skilfully paraded. His attempts to secure United States troops were denounced as a damning outrage; South Carolina should be ruled by South Carolin1ans'' was repeated from mountain to seaboard.

 The work of buying arms and organi- zlng democratic primaries and rifle clubs was energeticaHy pushed on, till every democrat in the State had gun and was enrolled in primary, and three fourths of the whites belonged to the military.

 The ostracism and dragooning of all who hung back was carried to the last ex- treme. until the whites were consolidated as in 1860.

 The negroes saw these portentous movements; they saw the soldiery drilling, and every white man spending hours dai lY at the target. Rumors of Hamburg reached them. Their former masters ur- gently importuned them to vote for AauP1Ou. A'0Ly IopuOllCdA AOc0AuB Wa0 interrupted by armed multitudes of dem- ocrats, half the time demanded for demo- cratic speakers, the republican orators ieered at. interrupted, vilely insulted, and hissed down. while the intruding speak CTS plainly announced that the whites were going to carry the election at all hazards and that the negroes had better vote the democratic ticket to save them selves trouble. Long lines of cavalry kept constantly parading and proved par ticularly effective. Then another holo caust took place at Ellenton, and was talked about by the whites all over the State in the presence of the negroes. The whites, furthermore, suddenly assumed a dlctatorial demeanor in their daily inter course with the colored people, knocked them down or shot them on the smallest provocation, and by free use of menaces prevented indictments. Prominent Re- publicans, white and colored, were threat ened by ambuscades or followed by crowds of bullies, If they left towns to canvass in the country; the negroes and white republicans were insulted on the"

rounding curve at New Castle, and had
the coupling not parted the whole train of
peaches would have been wrecked The
car was from Greenwood. and had load
OF 23,5O0 pounds, 1900 more than is al
lowed


Around Odessa the farm hands made up
their minds not to pick peaches for less
than 81 per day, and the farmers decided
to pay only IS cts. The hands, mostly
negroes, struck, and the farmers have en-
ployed tramps in their places. This has
aroused quite an enmity between the
colored people and the ""peach plucks.n


A trot took place on Cooks race track,
at FELTON,, last Saturday. The first was
won by Boon Smiths mare Lady Walkovcr,
in 800; the second by J. Caulk's horse
Dexter, in SOB; and the third by Edward
Bailey's colt Gloucester, in 1.35--half mile.
Justus Lowery, of Milford, and J. F. Colds.
boro and j. Kirkley, of Leipsic, were the
judges.


THE CoNGREssMAN.--A correspondent at
Georgetown writes as follows to Eve1y Even-
ing and C0mmcrciu: | find there is a good
deal of earnest talk about making Edward
l.. Martin, Esq, of Seaford, the Democratic
candidate for Congress next year. In all
probability there will be quite lively fight
between him and Charles B. Lore, ESQ, of
your own county.


TURNING WnITE.-A dark mulatto woman
at Wyoming is said to be turning white.
Some years ago white spots began to ap-
pear on her person and she has been
called the spotted woman These have
developed SO that scarcely any of the dark
remains and if she lives few years longer
she will be one of the fairest of the fair as
her SKIN is as iair and beautiful as young
child's.


| Two Much OF THE Coon THING-A car
load Of peaches from A. Hardcastle, Nd.
"" Del. II. r., was weighed at Middletown
one day last week and contained hundred
more baskets than the car should carry
600 instead of 500. Yet the manifest only
called for the 500. The car was breaking
down under its overload, and If it had been
allowed to go on, Il serious accident might
have happened.


The Lynams constitute a large family
near Wilmington, mostly farmers, and
they always have a family reunion on the
9th OF August. The reunion this year was
held at Thos. Lynams, farmer near New
port. Between 200 and 300 guests were
present. 90 carriages were driven into the
lawn. The members Of the family went a
tishlns III the morning in the creek near
by and caught ten bushels Of fish, which
were cooked on the ground for big
dinner, in the afternoon. The people Of
the neighborhood were all invited.


AN ODD CAsE.-Alex. Moseley, coIored
man near Milford, has had his cornfield in
vaded number of times by David S.
Lynch's cattle. He complained to Lynch
and asked him to take care of the cattle
but no attention was paid to the request.
Moseley then dug a deep ditch inside the
fence so that when the cattle jumped over
they would fall into the ditch. For this
Lynch had Moseley arrested and held to
bail in 5000 for his appearance at court.
The trial was before Squire Stephens. of
Milford. So the Milford Nc,os says, and it
naturally thinks that the wrong man has
been bailed.


The GEORGETOWN Posi- OFFICE.-Quite an
animated contest is going on in George.
| town over the change in the Post Master
IN that town. It seems that the present
incumbent Mr.. Lynch has been in eight
years and many of the citizens think this is
long enough. Besides this there are com.
plants that he does not attend as carefully
to the business as he should, and that he is
lll-natured and petulant to many who have
Official business with the office. Those who
for these reasons desire change have
asked the appointment of James Maull,
and arc making all effort to effect it, but
so far with out any result.


THE PEACH CRoP.-Vice President Cas-
satt, Of the Pennsylvania railroad, in reply
to request from a committee of the Della
ware peach growers for n reduction of
freight rates, states that the present rates
on peaches are not more than fairly
remunerative, and declines to make any
reduction. 1t is stated that in conse.
quence of the freight rates being un.
satisfactory to the peach growers that there
is large addition to the number of DRYERS,
and many growers expect to work nearly
their whole crop. Canning will be largely
done, and in addition water communica-
ton is being largely sought as an expert
ment.


VISITING THE COLoRED SCHooLs.-H. c..
Conrad, Esq, Actuary of the Delaware
State Society for the education of the
colored people is now making tour of the
State holding meetings of the colored
people in all the large towns to whom he
speaks upon the subject of education with
the view of stirring them up to greater
el1orts IN this work. lie has already
visited Sussex county and this week he is
doing Kent viz: Tuesday evening at
Camden; Wednesday afternoon at Grimes
Chapel near Leipsic Wednesday evening
at Dover; Thursday evening at SMYRNA.
This society and its excellent Actuary are
engaged in a noble work.


CHURCH TROUBLE IN SUSSEX AMONG THE
CoLoRED PEoPLE.-There is quite a settle.
ment of mulatoes in Indian River Hundred,
in Sussex, that claim to be part Indian.
They have a church called Harmony, and
though the negroes worshiped with them,
they always employed white preacher
until three years ago the Delaware Con.
ference sent them a divine Of too dark
a color, which action created some feeling
and resulted in a split The darker
colored brethern succeeded in holding
the church property, which has lead to q
law suit. Most of the prominent lawyers
in Georgetown are into the contest, either
as referees or counsel. Some Of the muatoes
side with the negroes, but the Norwoods,
the leading mulatto family, are fighting
them.

ern Shore Of Maryland, commonly called


The Kent County Rail Road,
The Company was chartered by an Act of
the General Assembly of Maryland on the
9Th of March, 1856, and several supplement
tary Acts relating there.o have been since
passed by the General Assembly of Maryland
all which Acts may be found among the pIb-

estate, property, franchises rights and char
tered privileges belonging, attached, or ap-
purtenant to said Road, including a lot of

Rights in Louisiana,",,"


All of a sudden, the Republican lea
ders, who have done their best to destroy
the self-government of tine States, and to
consolidate all political power in the
hands of centralized administration;
who have sustained all the usurpation
OF the Executive; who have justified the
rule OF bayonets and military interference
In elections; and who have passed laws to
make the Sc outrages possible, are ena-
mored of State rights and State sovereign
ty! f4tl ta


How and whence came this professed
conversion? When Grants partisan COM
mittee got through with their work in
New Orleans, they had two objects to ac-
complish in order to fortify the fraudu-
lent count for Hayes. One was to furnish
a character for the rascally Returning
Board, and the other was to declare their
action infallible and irreversible by any
tribunal in the land. In their report to
the President they say: l


""Not only is the action of this board indie
pendent of the State or national laws other
than those of Louisiana, but its determine
tion OF the votes cast and candidate elected
Is Undt, and substantially c0neiusiue''


They might take forged returns, fabri-
Gated certificates, reject whole parishes
on false pretenses, and elect whom they
chose, as the Lynch board did in 1872,
and as Wells and his present associates
did in 1874, land have now done again;and
still according to Mr.. Sherman, Mr.. Slough
ton, and other Christian statesmen, their
action could not be revived. After hav-
ing stolen the State for Hayes, these Semi
nent lawyers"" maintain that the thieves
cannot be tried for the larceny. And
John Sherman boldly declared in the Sen
ate that any inquiry into the conduct of
the board would be violation of State
rights.


The House sent committee to New
Orleans to investigate the recent ntelection,
with the usual powers. They called for
the originalpapers ofthe Returning Board,
in order to report the exact facts. Wells
and his confederates, who had doubtless
been advised to their course by Sherman
refused to produce them upon the most
frivolous pretences, but finally offered to
allow copies to be made, if the committee
would furnish the clerks.


When the clerks appeared they were
not permitted to handle the papers at all
or to test their accuracy in any way, but
were required to take down only what
the subordinates of the Returning Board
read to them. These and other acts, as
well as the frauds of the same men in 1874,
naturally excited distrust, and the origi-
nails were again demanded and refused,
though within few minutes reach of the
committee.


Under these circumstances, the facts
were reported to the House, and the Re
turning Board were properly adjudged to
be in contempt. Garfield, Hoar, Kas-
son Lawrence, and others, who have
been foremost in crushing out liberty in
the States and in building up central
lied government, rushed to the rescue of
the Returning Board, and sought to shield
their iniquites by shouting that State
rights would be invaded by the produc-
tion Of the papers of the Returning Board.
1t was pretended that the election returns
were State records, which were sacred
and not subject to any examinations.


Now, it has never been proposed to re-
move these papers from New Orleans, land
all the defamation of the Republicans
was only intended to mislead the public
mind, and to throw dust inthe eyes of the
people. Investigation would make the
frauds of the Returning Board more pat
ent than they now are, and hence this de-
sire for concealment."

WASHINGTON. DC. July Is. 1s77",,"WASHINGTON, D.C.i July 49, 1917.


In two weeks the most important o.
the Republican State Conventions
that of Ohio-will be held. Almost
inevitably the whole question, Of ap-
proving the course Of Mr.. Hayes will
come up, and will produce excited dis
cussion. Ben Wade, it is said, will be
a candidate for President of the Con
vention, but l think it more likely
those opposed to the administration
will select as candidate some one
who has been more circumspect in his
opposition. Then, too, what may hap
pen in other State Conventions to be
held before August 1st, may possibly
prevent an open rupture for a time in
Mr.. Hayes own State.


The interest felt among military
men in the existing Indian war is
greater, / believe, even than in that in
which Custer lost his life. This may
be partly due to the fact that General
Howard is in command. The General
is not popular in the army This may
or may not be his fault, but it is a fact
known to all who meet army officers
here. They would all prefer that some
one else should command the troops,
and the General will have to exhibit
all the courage, vigilance and skill he
possesses to prevent the designation Of
a new commander.


There is a revival of interest in the
speakership question, as schemes of
friends of Mr.. Hayes are discovered,
or are supposed to be discovered. Ger
tainly good old Mr.. Banks was at one
time quite carried away with the idea
that the office would fall to his lot.
But that was months ago, and theplan
is apparently as dead as Julius Cesar,
a third term, or the mound builders.
What particular Republican will have
the administration support is not
known, nor is it important. There
can be no election Of a Republican to
the office without the most shameless
buying and selling Of politicians that
ever disgraced the country-such as
would at once sink the buyers and the
bought beyond the hope of resurrec-
ton. Those Southern Democrats who
are counted on to help along the evil
work, will not dare, even if they de-
sire, to sell themselves. The very
milestones they passed on their return
from the capitol to their homes would
cry out against them.


Tt seems to be understood that Hon.
John Lynch's daily paper will be
issued early in August. It will be an
administration paper, with all that the
name can ever imply. There is just a
possibility. that it will live a year or
so, but that involves the spending of
great deal of money.


Secretary McCrary, who expected
the Republicans of Iowa to fall into
line at the mere fact that he had start
ed for that State, has Just returned.
He says the Republicans Of the West
are nearly all supporters Of the admin
istration. In this, of course, he is in
direct conflict with the newspapers,
conventions and prominent men, but
thisdoes not seem to disturb him. Mr.
McCrary is a very honest man as the
world goes, but if he repeats such
stories as this about Western Repub-
licans, he will soon become known as
the Ananias of the nineteenth century. /
Why oannot the man tell the truth |"

GREAT EXCITEMENT IN UPLAND


NEAR CHESTER,",,"NEAR CHESTER. ...,.
From the Chester News.


On Friday afternoon officer Dalton, Of
Upland, was startled by hearing the cries
of female in distress coming from the
woods near the Reservoir across the
creek from the Borough mentioned The
officer seized boat in which were a
party of young folks and ordered the per-
sons in charge to row him over the
stream. He then hurried to the spot
whence came the cries, and found Miss
Sarah j. Dicks, and elderly lady, in
greatly agitated state, while blood
streamed down her face and from her
mouth. The officer inquired the cause
of the lady's disturbed condition and she
informed hi N that she had been assaulted
by three young men who had attempted
to commit nameless crime. She gave
the names of the parties and the officer
set about searching for the rascals. A
large crowd of men were attracted by
the screams and they volunteered to as
sist in the hunt. 4rl.1f f..I-...lft .l.


Joseph Clonney, yoang man well
known thereabouts, YVES one of the perpc-
traitors and he was seen making his way
toward the bridge which crosses the
creek at Pretty's Hall. He was acting as
though he was very much intoxicated
and was allowed to pass several crowds
of men who did not know the extent of
his crime. They thinking it was a simple
case of drunkenness did not offer to de-
tain Clonney and some of them encour-
aged him to escape from the officer whom
they saw in pursuit Clonney proceeded
into Upland and had gotten as far as
Eighth and Main streets when officer
Dalton succeeded in overtakIng ana Ar
resting him. -. ..---.


By this time the report had spread and
the widest excitement seized upon the
people who flocked into the streets. So
great was the crowd that the officer had
onsr and forcing HIM through the throng.
Many threats Of lynching were made and
it is stated to-day that if the prisoner had
been stranger he certainly would have
been strung up. The officer at last sue
ceeded in inoarcerating Clonney in the
lookup and shortly Afterwards the pris-
oner was given hearing before Justice
besieged by several hundred people but
nobody not Immediately connected with,
the case WAS allowed to enter. . T. .


Miss Dicks was interrogated by the
Justice and positively identified the pris-
oner Clonney. She stated that some of
her teeth bad been knocked out and
showed that the roof of her mouth was
lacerated. This was done by the fingers
of one of the brutes who committed the
assault. She asserted that she was pro
ceeding to the house of Mr.. Walter Ly-
tie, where she resided as housekeeper,
anu that three young men attacked her,
threw her down and attended to out
rage her person. She described and gave
the names of the guilty ones.


There were two witnesses examined
besides the lady. Their names are James
Dalton and Daniel Kelley. They stated
that they had witnessed the assault and
had ordered the men to release the lady.
The prisoner and his companions in the
crime then fed. Doubtless the oppor-
tune arrival of the witnesses prevented
the crime from being,blaoker than it real
ly was. There ls another witness named
John Watterson, who the authorities state
Is able to corroborate the evidence of the
others. ' ''h


The prisoner was held in 5000 bail to
answer at the next term of Quarter Ses-
sions, and in default he was recommitted
to the lookup An attempt was made
last evening and this morning by some OF
his friends to find bail for Clonney, but
unsuccessful. When our reporter LETT
Upland this morning at O'Clock, officer
Dalton was about to start for M edia jail
with the prisoner.


The affair was the talk of the place this
morning, and great indignation was ex-
pressed. Miss Dicks is said to be a
wealthy lady and is respectfully connect
ed In thisl county, she Is about 90 years
of age.


The other parties to the crime will be
eagerly searched for, .and if fapprehended
will doubtless share Clonney's fate, which
Is not enviable at best as there is a very
strong case again INST him, and if justice is
meted out to him he will be severely pun
ished.


Nothing has ever occurred within the
recollection of any of the inhabitants of
Upland to so greatly excite the popLlace
of that unusually quiet borough as this
affair. Clonney is said to be about 26 or
q years of age, but it is probable that he
younger."

Incomplete returns from 43 Counties,
with full returns from the city and coun-
ty of Philadelphia, give a Democratic
gain on the vote for State Treasurer OF
1854. The same counties gave a ma.
jority of 10, 9sS for HAYES.


Nov. 6.
The vote in this County has been
light, aud the Gay passed uneventfully.
Up to IL O'Clock Tonight returns from
the city give McRea (Rep.) County

These figures are from 3s out of 1lS

in the city with the probabilities in
favor of the Democratic candidate. But
- towns outside will give some 1900
Republican majority, it is confidently
expected by the Republicans that they
will overcome the majority."

DISCUSSION OVER THE BILL.


After the reading if the bill had been
finished Mr.. Paynter, moved that it be
( recommitted to the committee as they
were not q unit and that there were
severallameudmens,, needed, that would
have to be reduced to writing.


Mr.. Baker, moved to amend, that
committee report Immediately, for if
action on the bill was delayed it
could not be got through tho Legisla-
ture. ss9 w W ~ f,-- slf
4 Mr.. Lynch, said that he could not
vote for 10; asread that he had several
objections to it but as it occupied 30
much time in nreading it he had forgot
ten what they were. He would like to
have it printed so that the members
could take time in reading it and vote
intelligently upondt.


Mr.. johnson, said that he could not
vote for the bill az it was just, re ed it
being 30 long that he could not re-
member what provisions it contained,
and he would like the committee To
state their objections. as


Mr.. Paynter said If the gentlemen VIII o
havs just spoken will look in the city
ordinance book, they will find very
few changes in the present biR from
the old one. #...-


| Mr.. Piekels. was of the same opinicn n
as Mr.. johnson, and could not vote
for it by just hearing it read. The
gentleman from the Fourth Ward
stated that there was very few import
ant changes in the bill just read, from
the old one. He commended that thei 9
was several among them being the
abolishing of the Board of Revision
ard Mr.. Baker here rose to point OF
order stating that the motion before
the house was to recommit the bill
and not it to discuss its merits.


| The PresiAent decided the point
well taken.
4 Mr.. Pickels still standing contended
that he was ia order that he had not
violated any parliamentary law, and
continued to discuss the merits OF the
bill when he was again interrupted by
Mr.. Baker, who insisted on his point
of order. Mr.. Pickels then sat down.
| Mr.. Febiger, said that the object OF
the gentleman who had just spoken
was to defeat the bill and he thought
by bull-dozing, the same asthey are
at Washington they would gain their
ends but it would be sure to fail.

the following conversation relative to the

R.-Mr. Kramer how are you Succeed

laily.


R.-Do you think this movement will

Mr.. k,-No sir, The early christian

I he pastor then read the 9Th chapter |
of Paul's epistle to the Romans, . after |
which he made short address, very ap-
pIopriate to the occasion. AT the conclu-
sion OF his remarks he stepped down the |
bank into the water. He was followed |
by Mary Ii. Pierce, the first one baptised |
she was followed by all the ladies and
then came the gentlemen. The ceremon- |,
les are very simple. The pastor puts his
hand on the back ofthe neck, and with
the other grasps one of the hands of the
candidate and says: 81 baptise thee in

Ghost, amen;"" and as he utters the last /

Later advices show that 1t was 8 much more serious affair than at first supposed. It appears that a gang of negroes robbed the store of R. H. Gains. and then fred the build Ing to hide the evidence of their crime. Six buildings were burned and large amount of property destroyed, upon which there was no insurance. After the fire was subdued, four negroes-two men and two women-were arrested for the robbery. An attempt was made to lynch the prisoners, but was prevented by the officers of the law, and the pris- oners were taken to Katesville and lodg- ed in jail. Next day great crowd of Salisbury people went to Kates- vile for the avowed purpose of hanging the prisoners, but the Sheriff, hearing of their design, removed them to place of safety. On Thursday they were brought back to Katesville, and an- other attempt was made to lynch them, but failed through the vigilance of the officers and law-abiding citizens. Other arrests were made and 8 large amount of stolen property recovered. Among these last arrests was Lige Dougherty, who after being badly chok- ed acknowledged that he was one of the gang. He was placed in the second story of the building, under a strong guard, but that night the mob assembled broke down all barriers, and were just on the point of seizing their victim when he jumped from the window and escaped. The crowd followed him, and as they ran past Dougherty's cabin, his wife fired at them with shot gun, but did no harm. The woman was then ordered to surren- der, but she defed the whole crowd. The City Marshal attempted to go into her house to arrest her, and was shot in the shoulder. Two other officers made a similar attempt, and were also severely wounded. The cabin was then fired and the woman with her four children were with difficulty dragged from the burning house."

in length, from Galveston to San Antonio has
afforded an opportunity to the papers of the
latter city to expatiate on it's beauties and the
thrilling interest of it's history. It sppears
that San Antonio is the second oldest city in
the Union (snn Augustine, Fla, being the
oldest), having been founded in 1862. In 1880
the foundations of Purisma Conception were
laid also, about the same time, La Espada,
San Juan and San Jose were built These
missions are of stone, and in q good state OF
preservation. They are at intervals of three
OF four miles along the San Antonio river. In
1852, when Texas and Louisiana passed from
the possession of France to Spain the popula-
tion of San Antonio was 1000. After the transfer
Texas was connected with Mexico, and coon
began to exhibit the restlessness which finally
caused the erection of the Republic of Texas.
Previous to tho revolution Americans were
authorities. Such restrictive orders only in
spired the hardy adventurers with more deter
mination. Nolan and party of eighteen en-
tered the territory, and were all killed, one
way or another, except one.


In 1913 the republicans commenced their
struggle. and many fights took place in the





commenced against Spain, spread through
lishmeut Of the Republic,


But the Texans soon found that they had
exchanged Spanish tyrant for Mexican Re-
publican tyranny. In 1924 Austin's army cap
tured San Antonio after q hard fight, and in
1886 Santa Anna with several thousand Me1i-
CANS attacked the place. Its defenders num-
bered 144 men, under command of Col Travis,
all being within the walls of the Alamo. On
Sunday morning, March 9Th, the Mexicans be-
gan the assault. To describe this conflict
would be to give history of each individual
composing the Texan force. Ali were heroes
and all sold their lives at o fearful cost to the
enemy. The dead body of Crockett was found
apart from his comrades, but surrounded by
dead enemies. Bowie, though on the verge of
death from sickness, only gave up the remnant
of his life in exchange for the lives of two or
three Mexicans. Not one soldier lived to tell
the stOry.


ThernOpyjm had its messenger of defeat, the Alamo

lowed by ether disasters. Col. Fannin and his |

to entirely annihilste the Americans. Hors-
ton, who commanded the Americans, was
driven over the State to Lynchburg, just
across the bay from Galveston. There the
American army was hemmed in completely.
Santa Anna came on, confident of his ability

lriven an army of lions to bay. The conflict
vas terrible, and resulted in the defeat of the
dexicans and the subsequent capture of the

Concluding its sketch, the San Antonio
Heyald says:


During the last twelve months there has
,een a Tapid increase in our population, which
low amounts 20 about 20,OO0, WhiIo the sRRre-
ate wealth will probably not fall short of
10, 600, 900. A city on the American continent
which has stood for nearly two centuries, and
urvived the shock of q dozen wars and pOliti-
al revolutions, may be safely regarded as Q

BE- hanged tor the murder Of Wild Bill.
From what has driited TO US from those
diggngs, the Judgment would appear to
lee righteous. The murder grew out Of
the law OF retaliation, which is at the
heart, core OF every man who takes his
life IN his hand, and ""mingles with So
cietv "" on the hcrdors OF civilization, of
which such new place, as Dcadwood aud
Caster City are the eNpouents. That
law has but ono c'ause--''An eye for nm
eve; Tooth Tor tooth; blood for
blood."" Not man In the Black Hills,
or amid am the Wild scenes Of frontier
life from Cheyenne to the guches on the
Pacific side og The Sierra Nevada, that
does not understand and fully accept the
responsibilities Of the code, the organic
basis OF which is "" life Tor life""


Is the percentage Of murder greater
there than in the cities in which higher
civilization prevails Road the Eastern
kilograms Of morning and judge. No,
it is not, nor does robbery moro prevail
or any other criminal meanncss which
unfortunately shames the life of hrge
cities Life on tho frontier is Wild, and
men go ""hoeled ''--armed like batteries
of death, but they carry the coae in their
memories for constant reference. There
are few towards among them, and when
lhe inevitable Ginlcuty comes, as como
it will and does, it all depends ON the
""dropn The quicker on the trigger has
slight advantage he hits his man.
II he misses tho luck IA against him, and
the coroner sits ON him instead OF the
other man. That j. all there is Of it, 1t
is considered fair stand up fight and
thero is an end. 1t may be the victor's
turn to pass in his checks tomorrow,
and the boys turn out respectfully to give
their late friend a good send-oti to the
happy hunting grounds.


Jhis affair OF Jack McCann and wild
Bin does not appear 70 have been fair
stand up contest. Wild Bill has been
known for years as desperate and II
game man. Perhaps he had not large
stock Of morality ON hand to boast of,
but he didn't boast OF it. His was
rough life and was mixed up with rough
men of the frontier. He was n dead shot,
and it was said ofhim that henever turn
ed his back on n friend or IL foe. 1t was
n good thing to say of u man anywhere.
In ono Of .hc savage scummages which
onlivons society in the gold regions Wild
Bill killed his man. 1t was not his nrst
man, so it did not make him proud. The
dead had friends too. One of these was
Jack McCann. Ile swore to be even
with Bill-lite for life. We do not know
how long Jack MeCann kept this grudge
stored II bis yongetu memory, but his
purpose mover slept One day last SUM
mer Wild Bill was playing cards in IL
saloon at-somowhere in the Black Hills
when Jack McCaun went behind him
and shot the life instantly out Of IN. 1t
was life for life, but the debt was not
claimed according to the code. 1t was
not fair stand.up fight. 1t was cow
ardy murder. So tho friends of Wild
Bill said, and SO everybody seems to have
thought. McCann escaped, but one OF
Biu's friends, man like to himself,
brave and desperate If occasion needed,
took Vengeance in hand and the murder
er was arrested and tried. We have tho
verdict, Jack MoCann, unless he escapes
or is lynched, will lnaugurate the gal

ton County, North Carolina"" to the Freeman's
Journal we take these extracts:


This is Priory of the Benedictine Order,
established by and under the Jurisdiction Of
RI. Rev Bonifacius WINNER, Abbot of St.
Vincent's Monastery, Westmoreland County,
Pa, situated in CASTOR Comfy, twelve miles
west of Charlotte, and within one mile of the
nearest depot on the Air Line Railroad, having
the Caroline Central Railroad q short distance
communication with all our public thorough
fares. The lands lying on the banks of the
majestic Catawba, are magnificent domain,
we'll timbered, and rich in golden ore. This is
the Southern valley of the Blue Ridge chain
of mountains Spencer's Mountain is in
sight, whose base, laved by an off5hoot of the
Catawba, sings it's anthems day and night, and
Mary's.


The soil, though cot alluvial, is productive
of all the cereals, fruit and cotton. The cli-
mate is one of the most healthy on earth, in
the opinion of many of our most eminent ply
siciaus. Nowhere in the world could be found
situation better adapted for the object for
which it is intended. 1t is a donation to the
Benedictine Order of Rev. Dr.. J. j. OConnen,
whose name is household word in the South.
The Very Rev. DR.. Hermann Wolfe is our


worthy Prior, six. footer, a convert, and an
ex-Confederete soldier He has also in charge
several churches in CASTOR and adjoining
counties, one of them near Concord, Cabarras
County, where the congregation are all con-
verts and of German descent. His long W hite
beard gives him a patrarchal aspect. He is
assisted by Father Joseph Keller and number
of lay brothers. Your old friend, DR.. j. J.
OConnell, represents the secular element of
the priesthood very fairly.


The existence of this institution is start
ling fact to those who knew this mission
twenty years ago. 1 can imagine how Bishop
Lynch and his great predecessor rejoice. 1t is
grand proof of the growth of the Catholic
Church in North Carolina, of the zeal of our
| dear Bishop Gibbons. aud of the fidelity of the


Benedictine Order to its primitive spirit and
| vocation."

followed by Mapping Bill and three
troopers


'Tn the morning, the bound troopers
managed to awake the others by their cries,
and then it was found, from their condition,
that the spirits must have been drugged,
hence their inability to offer any resist
ance.


""We held hasty council, and decided to
send to station, four miles away, for fresh
troopers. By means of fleet messenger, a
search party was organized, and they left
the camp two hours later, preceded by the
black tracker to point out the trail.


LUCKILY, I managed 70 be enrolled
among the party, much to my satisfaction.
I had score to settle with Mapping Bill,
and intended to give good account Of
him if we met


""We numbered twenty resolute, we'll
armed fellows, carrying revolvers and
knives, while the twelve troopers with us
had rifles in addition.


'We proceeded first to the scene Of the
encounter. We found the wagon drawn
off the track and overturned.


''The black tracker soon took up the
trail, and we went into the bush in Indian
file. Our progress was necessarily slow,
but we were quite certain of coming up
with the rangers at last.


""We followed the blacks for couple Of
hours, then one of them suddenly set up
a warning cry, and we rushed forward.


'Tn the centre of an open glade, we saw
the body of man laid upon the ground.
Scattered around were bits of canvas,
and grains of gold g7istened, in the grass.


Examining the body, we recognized it
to be person some of us had seen hang
ing about.the camp few days previous to
the starting of the escort. A small blue
hole in his forehead told what had hap
pened.


Evidently dispute had arisen among
the rangers, and this fellow had been
shot for his obstinacy. We again took up
the trail, and proceeded.


''The bush now became less dense, and
we made greater progress. About mile
further on, one of the blacks who was
some hundred yards ahead suddenly drop
ped fat on the grass, and gave us a warn
ing signal.


advancing cautiously to his side, we
peered through the bushes.


""Down in hollow were six bush-rangers,
seated round small fire. Their horses
were tethered near them, and various pack
ages were scattered about. Our plans were
soon laid. We made detour, and COM
pletely surrounded them.


'T crept quietly through the underwood,
intending to reach tree, which grew about
twenty yards from the fire of the BUSH
rangers. Suddenly hand was laid on my
shoulder. I hastily turned, and saw tall
ranger close by my side.


""He grasped me by my collar, and pre-
sented revolver to my forehead.

TEMPERANCE MEErtNG-FAIR AND JUG


BREAKING AT THE COURT HOUSE.
Ernm Our RaouIar Corrasnondant",,"TEMPERANCE MEErING-FAIR AND JUG
BREAKING AT THE COURT HOUSE.
From Our Regular Correspondent.
New CASTLE, June 16.
Owing 10 the Court House being in use
for the BAPTIST fair, the temperance meet
ing was adjourned to the front of the
city Hall, where prayer was offered by
Rev. George Il. DrisLor. A swinging
lamp was hung ON the arch of The Hall
and the pledge book beiug opened, sion-
ing commenced at once. Nelson j. Lee
BEGAN his discourse in his usual happy
mood, aud was interrupted time af,er
time by cheers and applause as member
afVer member of the fire company put
their names upon the book. This fact
seemed TO animate him and he attacked
the stronghold of The enemy with renew :
cd vigor.


Brother MCGEE followed, bringing tears
TO the eyes of many. Brother Fox, who
is fast becoming a favorite, gave little
advice TO those who signed, which was
received with great attention.


Brother Whelan, ON taking the stand 3,
said he had good tidings of great joy, that
the entire membership of Goodwill Fire
Company had signed the pledge. and
should the fire bells give notice of fire
you need have no fear, for they wear the
red BADGE; and should the watchman's
rattle disturb the stiffness of the night,
have no fear, for one of the police had
signed.


Rev. George r. Brstor being called
upon, gave few stubborn facts as 10
the results which would follow from
stoppage of drinking, and illustrated it
with figures so plainly that none could
fail to see it.


A fair and jug breaking in aid of the
Baptist building iund was opened in
Court House last evening. The building
is beautifully decorated and so entirely
different from list week and with no less
taSte that the change is pleasing. Three
arches span the room in straight line
with the railing which separates the bar
from the auditorium.


As you enter through the railing,to the
left Is the prisoners dock, which has
been arranged as a post-ofiice, with Miss
Jennie Appleby as mist ess, assisted by
Miss Brown.


Next to the left is a table for the recep-
tion of the jugs; on the left side OF the
room is the cake and confectionery table
III cHdlPo Vi MT. DOihaS ApDleDy, as
sisted by Miss Lille Lofland and Miss
Winnie Lynch. The fruit and flower
stand has been arranged in front of the
judges desk Mr.. White, assisted by
Della Curry, Miss Nonia Reynolds and
Miss Annie Reev The Judges desk
has been transformed into a terrace of
flowers; particularly noticeable is beauti-
full vase. To the right is a sweep well
such as was in used in days gone by from
which pail after pail of thirst Stacking
lemonade is drawn by Miss Nellie Mead
er, assisted by the Rev. r. w. Burkhold.
er,of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.


AT 1920 p, m. the order went forth to
begin the jug bl eaking, when j. E.
George, acing as Grand Smasher, with
hammer in hand took up the first Jug. A
deadly silence prevailed than a crash
and the fun.began. The money was count
ed and amount set opposite the names of
the person who had the jug, each of
which bears the name of the person in
whose care it has been. Last evening 38
We're broken containing $50,88. The
highest so far was SIS; he lowest II
cent: To the lady who furnishes the best
hlled jug large cake will be given A
pocket knife for the boy; silver thimble
for the girl For the man slipper pate IN
of roses and violets. The remaining
jugs nearly one hundred in number will
be broken this evening"

 A Warner lady stopped the milkman as he was passing the house the other day and in- quired the price of milk by the quart, putting up her ear trumpet to catch the reply. The milkman drew quart of milk and emptied it into the trumpet, and the result has been that he has to go mile out of his way to keep out of sight of the lady, who sits on the front porch with a shot gun watching for him to pass.

The follow ing day, April 26th, the three companions left us among the beautiful hills of Vir. ginia. And, for New England friends who recall the battle of Winchester as the cause of their own homes desolation, ] may particularlze. Our friend Mir. w., 0 loyal citizen, gave me many incidents of intense interest throughout the war; Chief among these were those of Sept 18th, 1864, when the wounded and dying upon his premises numbered fifteen h,n- dred. His house was thronged and the sufferers ministered to most kindly. From one New Hampshire Regiment thirty-eight men fell instantly in a mass, earth was heaped above the dead, and a rude fence built around the mound. Aft erward the state sent and had the bodies removed to the cemetery and suitable monument erected. I said, .""We had dead upon that battle field and their bodies now lie in the little Goshen Ceme- tery.' And in the peace and promise of this spring day, all the pain and heart- ache of that dreadful chapter in our na- tional history came back over my soul, deepening the sacredness of the memory of those who could and aid die for Free dom. And, when again the wreaths and flowers are placed above the soldiers graves. emember-there are many burial lots where the Federal and Confederate lie ~;-1 l-- -nida -i- +hAi- lasi d-Annnlnaa sloon and the noble hands that scatter flowers there, make no distinctions.

 ''So with an equal splendor

 The morning sun rays fall

 With a touch impartially tender,

 On the blossoms blooming for all

 

 No more shall the war cry sever,

 Or the winding river be red.

 They banish our anger forever,

 When they laurel the graves of our dead,

 Under the.sod and the dew,

 Waiting the Judgment day,

 Love and tears for the Blue,

 Tears and love for the Gray.""

 Upon the banks of the James river we left our Virginia friend and the parting was silent one.. That night in mist and clouds we entered Washington and pursu- ed the journey to New York and then to Connecticut, grateful for the safe comple- tion of the series of events that marked the winter.

 The welcome home is kind, the old faces good to look upon, but we are sad to miss some from their familiar places. Goshen gives us boisterous greeting, and I look back over the journey, recalling the little ponds full of white lillies in Florida; the luxuriant and fragrant azalias, or pink honey-suckle, dog wood and buckthorn through the Georgia woods; apple blos- soms, roses and Visteria near the towns and country homes. The rolling lands of the Carolinas. the hills and finally the mountains of Virginia are all bright with the gladness of spring, and know that Tn due time my own hills will clothe them selves and rejoice my heart as no other land can ever do.

 With thanks for your patient listening, and good bye. M. l.. w."

The proce ssioE formed at the academy, according to the order and plan of the day, and led by the LakeYlle Cornet Band, proceeded to the grove near the beautiful lake Wononscopomoc, and after music by the band and the Glee club, and prayer by the Rev. Mr. Hunt of Canaan, listened to the reading of the Declaration of Independence by Ex Gov. A. H. Hol- ley. after which Judge Butts, of Monticello N. r., delivered an oration in the place of Judge Groo who was expected, but who was detained at his home by sickness in his family. The oration of Judge Butts was pronounced one of the finest oratorical eff forts ever heard in this region. We regret exceedingly that we are not able to publish it entire. Everybody was delighted with it, his eloquence entirely captivating his hearers.

 The dinner was next in order, and the long tables were quickly filled, and refilled repeatedly till the coffers of the Methodist people, who had this part of the proceed ings in charge, must have been we'll filled. The brief addresses in the afternoon by Thomas L Norton and others, were to the point and good. A letter was read from Governor Hubbard, announcing his inability to be present.

 The balloons were successfully launched and scared heavenward, to the delight of the spectators, and in the evening the fire works were discharged, which closed the days proceedings.

 Throughout the day good order was pre- served and every feature of the celebration was successfully carried out.

 THE RIFLE PRACTICE.

 At the Nutmeg Rifle Range we were able to spend but few moments. The sharp shooters were all at dinner except Capt. Palmer, who was standing guard at the ar mory. and for our amusement showed us how the club were in the habit of doing it, or at least it was the way he did it, and which was to put bullet in the bulls eye'' at nearly every shot. MT. Joseph Knight, who accompanied us. made several excuses about his inability to compete with the Irish team. but when he sent three shots at tue target, his score gave ev- idence that he was not an entire stranger to the practice.

 AT TWIN LAKES. ..

 Celebration-The united picnic of the Catholic people in the parish under the charge of Rev. Father Lynch of Llkeville, at the Twin Lakes picnic grounds on the Fourth was largely attended, large numbers beiDg added throughout all the earlier part of the day by the arrival of trains on the Conn. Western road, beside the many who came in their private convey ances. The pls tform for dancing was largely patrorized the boats, all that could be obtained, perhaps eight or ten !, were constantly occupied. In the after noon the people were addressed by the Rev. Father Harty, who succeeded, as the Rev. Father always does, in interesting his hearers, giving an address full of learning and fraught with good advice, and sound solid sense. It is to the credit of the efforts of the temperance people among the Catholics, that not one lndica- tioh was manifest that any person who

 

 llquor whatever; not only no drunkenness, but no signs of drunkenness visible anywhere, and altogether the entertain ment financially. and every other way. was success.

A letter from Santa Cruz CAL, dated
May 90 says the murderers OF DE FeI-
rest Francisco Arias and Jose Cham
alis, were this morning found hanging
from the cross beams of the Upper San
Lorenzo bridge, dead their feet anil
hands being tightly bound with hay
ropes. On the night before last, men
were seen in the orchard back OF the
Jail but as no attempt was made To
lynch the prisoners the people conclu-
ded that the Law would be allowed to
take its course. at two O'Clock this
morning the jailer and under sheriff
were surrounded by body OF men.
These men broke open the ssjail yard
door and obtained from the officers
the Jail keys. 1t is surmised that the
prisoners were placed in a wagon and
driven to the police of execution, the
wagon being driven out from under
them after the halter around their
necks had been fastened to the beam
above. This morning the people gath
cred in large numbers, but there WAS
no excitement and while the regret
was great that Lynch law should be
resorted TO in this law-abiding com
munity-a city in which no one has
been executed without due process of
law since lS52-there was feeling of
security manifested and a general re-
lief that life was no longer endanger-
ell by the x stence of two as de perate
assassins as ever stretched hemp.


Chamalis was executed within three
hundred yards of where he was born,
and at the time of his death was 81
years of age. He was sent to the State
Prison from this county for three
years for robbing widow named
Rodriguez. He broke Jail was rearrest-
ed and served out mis- term. His time
expired in March last. Last Monday
night he was brought to this place iand
confessed all in the presence of four
witnesses. He said that Arias came to
the house where he was and asked him
to accompany the speaker to the cir
Gus. He replied that he had no money
Arias said that they would get some
and they went to the locality where
De Forrest was, and De Forrest hap
pening along Arias fired at him. De
Forrest not stopping Arias fired at
again when De Forrest fell. They re-
mained in the willows till all was
quiet. and then they dragged the MUIR
dercd man across the road. His pock-
cts were robbed of So Arias kept $3.50
of the amount and they went to the
circus.


Arias was 3S years of age and was
born near Pescadero. He still has re-
latives residing.iu this county. For
numbering q sheep herder in San Louis
Obispo he was sent to the State Prison
for three years, his brother having
been sent there for life for the same
crime. For robbiug the house of p,
Murphy, of Watsonville, he was sent
to the State from this county for two
years. For time he denied the muir
der of De Forrest but on being Eclose-
| ycross-examined indirectly admitted
the crime. BY request of Chamalis
they were put in different cells."

the office, yesterday morning, and with an
air of profound mystery conhded to us the
information that he was quite wealthy, and
great collector of centennial relics but
being temporarily embarrassed and away
from home, he wished to dispose of a shirt
that Washington had once worn, for S4.75.
He showed us the shirt, but as it appeared
to have been the only one that Washing
ton ever had and that he had worn it with
great assiduity for a couple of hundred
years, we hesitated about investing. The
man said:


""You won't give $4.75 for shirt that
was once worn by the Father of his
Country?""


We said no at least not unless he could
bring us the affidavit of Col. Tom Gresham,
of Lexington, Ca, to show that the Father
of his Country washed his neck twice dur
ing the Revolutionary War, and that the
tint on the neck band of the relic was
caused by its being used as a washer for the
| lynch-pin of a continental cannon.

"" and look at this priceless bit of linen,

THE Address.


Major Daniel begun his address with
beautiful allusion TO the circumstances
which surrounded him, and the hallowed
memories which cluster around the place
where he stood, and then graphically in
trouuced as his theme ""Conquered Ma
| tions"" While IN one sense there Is no
conq uerer but God, aud the hand of Gou
could be traced in all history, yet he pro-
| posed to show that the fate of the South
| had been bur the fate of the whole hu-
man family, and that solace and hope
NAV be gathered from well nigh every
| Dare of the worlds history. He brought
out that America is the spoil Of conquest
| and the refuge of the conquered ah0 op-
| pressed aud proceeded to show that the
settlers of New England, Pennsylvania,
Georgia, South Carolina and virginia
were all conquered peoples fleeing from
oppression o..
He next inquired into the origin of the
| ""conqueriug English"" and showed how
they, too, had been conquered, and now
the rule OF the Norman cOnqueror had
| been ''woe to the vauuulshed."" He gave
a vivid picture of the dOings of ""Norinan
carpet-baggers"" and the sportive cruel
| ties aud cruel sports of the conqueror,
and showed how this state of thugs de-
veloped the ""EngliSh klukluX,"" whose
existence is verified by better testimony
than that Uf IA partisan congressional COM
mIttee,


He then portrayed the benefits which
the Normans brought to the English, and
! how Norman and Saxon blood gradually
blended together, until conquered Eng
! land came to the front as conQueror ,
Magma Charta, was wrested from the
barons, great ideas OF constitutional free
dom were generated, and the coDq
yoke became at last the trlumphal arch OF
freedom.


He then pr ceeded to show that all na-

1t was the originator of bulldozing IA an ele-
ment in political controversies, and that general
method of influencing elections which is known
as the Mississippi plan. 1t is one Of the strong
holds of those who do not acquesce in any
plan for conciiation, for harmony for the peace
and Justice which alone can bring back pros
perity to the Southern States. 1t contains n
great number of men who certainly hate the
Republican party, but who are equally hostile to
the Democratic party, so far as it Is willing to
be governed by tie law. These men, restless,
dissatisfied, angry and unreconciled, are obnox


ious to the better part OF the Mississippi Dem
ocrats-to those who are unwilling to be held
responsible any longer for the electioneering
system which disgraced the Presidential cleo
ton in that State. They want no party there
which is loyal. They care nothing for names
they will lynch or shoot Democrat just as"
11_1877-09-20_pNone_sn83030214_00206531307_1877092001_0144,New-York tribune.,01,1877-09-20,pNone,,,"quickly as they would a Republican, pro-


vided he ia not If their Ishmaeltish sort.


Hence, We find them quite as ready to


break up what are called Independent meet
ings as they were last year to assault
and scatter the Republican gatherings. In
some parts of the State the Republicans, at
least SO far as the local and Legislative can
vass rs concerned, are no longer known Dy
that name. Even if they were in majority
in county, and were permitted freely to ex-
ercise the right of suffrage, they are satisfied
should they elect their nominees, that they
would not be allowed to install them. They
have. therefore, determined to support IN
dependent candidates, some of them Repubh-
cans and some OF them Democrats.


Perhaps it is unnecessary to add that this
wise determination is by no means agreeable
to the Ishmaelites They mean to put the
movement down as they would any movement
looking to tranquility; and their first business
is to stop discussion. They can do this by
taking possession of the meetings OF their
opponents. Murder and the various devices
of lynchng they have found to be dan
gerous and violence of the extreme
variety is likely to defeat its own purpose
in the long run, as they have found out by
experience. But if they cannot murder, they
can at least break up the Independent meet
ings. They are doing this, to the best OF their
bad ability, in the Southwest; and an in
stance. illustrative of their purpose, is to be
found i'm recent events in Jefferson COun-
tv. In that county. at Fayette, on the
sth inst, the Independents were to hold


N
a mixed Republican and Democratic ticket
Down upon this meeting swooDed In great
numbers a democratic Club"" so-called, all
fully armed and equipped for effective and
vigorous suppression of the speech-making
They began by soaring away all the negroes
who were to be scared. They howled down
Mr. Finly, who was to speak; they silenced
Mr. Hicks, who was also to speak; and Mr.
Ellis, who was to address the meeting, dId not
think it worth while to try to do 20. While
Finly was speaking, one Of the rioters stood
near him, gun in hand, to regulate
his remarks. Hicks, it may be mentioned, was
Democrat of long standing. There was moth
ing for it but to adjourn the meeting.
Then Mr.. Ellis was assaulted in the street,
and finally was compelled, candestinely, 20 leave
the State and go to st. Louis, where he now
is. Not having any taste for sudden death,
he does not propose to return to Jefferson
County. He is a Mississippian by birth his
home is there; his family is there his prop
erty, probably, is there; but he cannot live
there.


One case like this is as good as a hundred
for the purposts of illustration. There are
other counties in which there ls like trouble
Pike County, for instance. Gov. Stone, under
these pressing circumstances, has done what he
usually d0es-he has written letter. in which
he SAYS, with great determination and vigor
that such state of things cannot be tolerated;
and cost what it may, it must and shall be
""stoppedr We do not hear, however, that
upon the strength of this cheering assurance
Mr.. Ellis proposes to return to his old home.
Gov. Stone has Written letters before, breath
ing the same spirit of majestic indignation,
but Southwestern Mississippi and its rioters DO
not appear to have been much alarmed by
them These outlaws still take their guns to
the independent meetings. The Br0oIharen
Comet has heard that a portion of the Amite
budOzers have been captured and lodged IN
iail but on the other hand, The |ic6sbuTg
HeraLd learns that the Judge Of that
district is generally drunk, and wants to know
why Gov. Stone does not remove himY Com
plants are made in all respectable quarters OF
his apathy"" They think it hardly enough
to write letters saying that such state OF
things must and shall be stopped"" They
prefer that he should write a letter showing
when, where and how he intends to stop it.
The aforementioned Comet is for hurting
"" the whole power of the State Government
against the men of the slot-guns. At present 1t |
seems to be a case of intinIidated Governor |
""A kind of character of which we saw some
thing here during the railway riots. If, as we
are told, ""the good people of Mississippi are
overwhelmingly in favor of peace"" it ought |
TO be easy for Gov Stone to suppress the lsh-
maelites.


1t is beginning to appear as if, for one reason or"

Newark IN. j. Advertiser a strong re-
publicanj )urnal, remarks that ""outrages
occasionally occur at the north which, if
done at the south, would taiRt it
throughout as savagely disorganized.""
Reference is made to lynch law of the
most revolving kind which was lately ap-
piled at Waterford, Pennsylvania, to a
woman. She was taken from her bed at
night, tarred and feathered, and ridden
upon a rail for mile and a>half, The
Advertiser remarks that, though q bad
woman doubtless, a community which
G n permit such doings in its midst
should be relegated to heathendom, ana
that Pennsylvania has too many blots
upon her name already TO permit Of
many more, and especially in the shape
of such outrages on decency as 6his. The
law and order population of Pennsyls
vania are not responsible for these
crimes, but they should reflect that
neither are the mass Of the Southern
people responsible for the work of bad
elements in their midst.-Bah. Sun."

have committed gross blunder already,
to call it by no stronger name. A
manned soldier held the Office of Lost-
master at Lynchburgh, Va, and Key ap-
pointed a Tennessee 'Reber' to the
office. The soldier took his ""eye"" and
his ''leg,"" and going TO Washington, laid
them before Hayes, remarked that he had
lost both in the struggle that brought
them each to that position enabling them
to acquire office. As might we'll be sup
posed, Hayes lost no time in revoking the
order of Key, and the soldier went back
to his postmastership in Lynchburg, and
The ""rebel"" left for his home in Ten
nessee.


such is the story that is told of KEY.
1t looks doubtful. If true it was shabby
IN him to turn off a manned soldier in
any event. Democrats in this region
would not have commended it; and they
most certainly would condemn the send
ing of man from Tennessee to fill oul
post-office. But what else is expected o.
men who take Office under Hayes. He
was not chosen to the Office in accordanc,
with the modes provided by our constitu
tion. Being himself an official fraud
the country should be prepared to wit
ness many frauds on the part of tn
hodge-podge Cabinet he has called to hi

Democracy Of late years to ventilate their
fnalice at the Acarpet-bag"" governments in
the South, and exhaust themselves in ad-
jectives denunciatory of the extravaganza
of the aforesaid governments, and urge, for
effects sake, the Illegal and unconstitu-
tional methods by which the debts in those
States of the Sonth heretofore under Repub-
lican rule were contracted rs an excuse for
reputation. The Democracy of the South
have shouted themselves hoarse on the
hustings, and filed their journals with lu-
gubrious laments over the dire necessity
forced upon them by radical and carpet
bag governments, viz: to repudiate obliga-
tions they are only too ready to find pre-
text for. Nothing illustrates the hypocricy
of this proposition more clearly than the
present attitude Of Virginia. Since the re-
hablitation of that State to the privileges
forfeited by the war, she has never for one
day been under Republican domination in
single department of her State government,
while every dollar of her large Indebtedness,
saw VI NtCIulnK
interest, was contracted under Democratic
rule before the war, in public works that
have tended greatly to her development,
and yet without the advantitious aid of
.o-mer carpet-bag"" governments she wants
to repudiate her honest obligation. Her
present Legislature, which assembled on
Wednesday, has pretty clearly demonstrated
in its organization that q determined and
perhaps successful effort will be made to
forcibly ""readjust,"" or virtually repudiate,
by CONTINGENCY in the future to do what
has already been done for several years,
i, e., leave the interest on the debt unpro-
vided for. With scarce q handful of Repub-
licans in that body-perhaps halfa dozen all
tOld-the present body has been elected
under the various names that CHANGED to
suit the locality in which they were candi-
dates. In some counties they proclaimed
themselves Independents"" in others
""Anti-Moffett Punch Men,"" while the more
general nom de plume of Readjustern was
used as the talsman of success. This
word ""readjuster"" possesses precisely the
same Significance as 'repudiation"" in the
locality in which it is used that ""Conserya-
tive party"" does to the old hydra-headed
monster of Democracy. The same rose though
under different name. So widespread
has this dishonest mania become throughout
the State, that the former fame and
high character Of many Of the Democratic
candidates who were candid enough to
avow purpose to pay the just obligations
of the State went for naught, and they were
overwhelmingly defeated, and that, too, in
the very strongholds of the Democratic
party. As evidence of this JOHN LETCHER,
of Rockbridge, who had been Congressman
and Governor, and whose public course,
when in Congress years ago, gained for him
the name of Honest JOHN"" and c. N.
BUTTON, editor Of the Lynchburg Yirginian,
whose pen has done as much to build up
the so-called Conservative party in the State
as any other one man in 1t, are both ruth
lessly thrust aside, and mere ""nob0dies, -
men who could not frame bill if their
lives depended on it, have been elected in
their places, simply because they answered
to the names Of ""readjusters"" or ""repudia-
tors"" which are, in this connection, synony-
nous. We have cited these isolated cases
to illustrate what has happened in almost
every section of the State.


That the new Legislature Is In earnest in


its dishonest purposes, seems evident from
its first effort on Wednesday in the matter
of organizing the House, when an unknown
man, named ALLEN, from the county of
Shenandoah, in the old ante-bellum ""Tenth
Legion of Democracy"" was elected Speaker
over HANGER, Of Augusta, and THOMAS s.
BOcOcK, of Appomattox, the former of whom
had more than creditably filed the position
for several years, while the latter possesses
national reputation as n presiding officer.
The trouble did not consist in the fact that
HANGER and BocOCK were not Demo-
cratic enough, but they were too
honest to answer to the questionable title
of read juster,"" ms did their more flexible
and successful competitor. Ths Legislative
body of the Old Dominion is now fairly
opened, and we shall soon know exactly what
they are going to do about debt contracted
by their own party. The sequel will prove"

THAT RoBBERY AT CAMDEN CAMp.-It was


stated in all the papers last week that Rev


ID. e. Ridgeway was robbed at Camden


camp, he and Il Rev. Mr.. JONES' Of n. V,


and that they suspected a Rev. Mr.. Davis


OF the theft. Mr.. Ridgeway, who resides at
Elkton, denies the statement, so far as he


IS concerned. His statement 10 the Cecil
Wing is that, upon lying down to take a


nap, he removed his pocket-book from his
pocket and secreted it some where about


the tent, and, that upon awakening, he


had entirely forgotten where he had
placed 1t. The tent was searched but


whether the book had been stolen, or he


had hidden it so successfully that he could


not find it himself he could not saw. Uo
entertained no suspicion whatever of the


money having been taken by Mr.. Davis


The whole affair was a cruel reflection upon


Rev. Mr.. Davis.

70 offer an opinion on the same subject, and
advising that Mr.. Morgan, in his certificates

tire satisfaction TO the District Commission

last week to the assault made upon Mrs.
Lynch, Of the Mendocino Dispatch, by
y. l.. Carothers. A complaint for assault
was made against Carothers, and he was
arrested and demanded jury trial. A
great deal OF time was consumed in OBJ
tanning jury, and when the case was
tried it failedto agree, standing accord ;
ing to the Mendocino Democrat three
for conviction and nine for acquittal.-
Whereqpon on motion of the District At
torney the case was dismissed.


We presume that there could be no
difficulty in proving the assault. Hence
this action upon the part Of the jury indi-
Gates that q portion of them at least, held
Carothers justfiable. For the American
nature is somwhat chivalrous in its ideas
of what is due TO woman. The whipping
post bill, for the punishment of wife beat
Drs met with hearty commendation.-
Hardly any punishment was felt to be
loo severe for the man who would beat a
woman. Even now some of the papers
speak in unmeasured terms Of this net of
Carothers. But the Ukiah jury, with all
the facts OF the case before them refused
TO convict him when he punished the sur
cast upon the reputation of his wife. So
il seems that there is limit to the amount
of abuse and provacaton man is com
PEELED to submit to when his assalant is a
woman. The notoriety which both par
ties have gained by :he affair IS not q very
enviable one."

The City Council met in regular ses-
sion last evening, Presiden1 Lichten-
stein in the chair.


The Street Committee, on the COM
from p. MCCARTHY, asking for
81, 900 damages on account Of injuries sus,
tained by his property at Maryland |
Avenue and Monroe street sewer, repor- |
ted adversely. Adopted.


The Finance Committee, on the reeo- |
solution in relation to the salary OF the |
Water Commissioners, reported in favor
of allowing each Commissioner $l250 for
all the work they were appointed to |
perform. r8


Mr. johnson thought this sum was not
adequate compensation, considering the
work the Commissioners had to per-
forn; they are working faithfully, and
closely attending to the work, bringing
to bear upon it their business capacity
and brain power.


Mr. Windle said the Finance Commit
tee had carefully considered the matter
and had fixed upon $3.50 as o fair COM
pensatioh-just alike to the city and
the Commissioners.


Mr.. johnson moved to amend the re-
port by inserting $500 instead Of $3.50.


Mr.. Guthrie thought $500 was too
high a salary these hard times.
Mr.. Paynter also opposed the amend
ment. The Finance Committee careful lily
considered the question, each mem Der
giving his figures, and the average was
accepted as the salary. He said gr eat
stress had been laid upon the BRAIN "" ork
h. hnp N
opinion much of this brain work had
been purchased; other people could ex-
ercise as much brain for less money.
Mr.. Lynch thought $3.50 ample COM
pensation, and was willing to sustain the
report of the Finance Committee.
After some further discussion Mr..
Johnson's amendment was lost and the
report of the Finance Committee was
adopted.


The Opening Streets Committee re-
ported favorably on the petition of y.
| l., Mousely and others, for the grading
of 23d street, from Market to Tatnall ;
| estimated cost, $50. Adopted.


| Same committee reported adversely
the communication from the Board OF
| Health, asking for the abatement Of a
| nuisance on South street. Adopted.


The Lamp Committee reported In
favor of awarding the coal oil contract
| for 1873 to G. s. Middleton, at II cents


MT. Norton objected to the report and
thought that the offer of the Baltimore
Gasoline Company to alter the Oil lamps
run them free for six weeks and supply
gasoline at six cents per gallon, should


be considered.


Mr.. Taylor said that this propose


would be considered in due time, but tia
the oil contract had to be renewed on
Tuesday next or the city would be with.


The Lamp Committee also reported
that tho contract for lighting and ex-

ment was intense. The streets at that
hour were crowded with pedestrians. Wo-
men and children ran screaming and
fainting in evey direction. In many cases
the soldiers fired in the air and with
blank cartridge, but the whistle OF bull
lets could also be heard, and several men
were seen to drop. Opposite the Ameri-
can office the firing was renewed, and al
so when Charles street was reached. So
far as can be ascertained twelve men are
killed and eighteen or twenty wounded.
The following are the names of the
dead, as far as ascertalned:
Thos. b. Byrne Register of the Fifth
Ward, shot in the head and killed instant

ball coming out in the groin; dangerous
ly George Kemp, huckster, aged twenty
/ three, shot through the thigh at the
corner OF Baltimore and Frederick
streets, while on his way home, seri-
ously, and some sixteen others.
The widest rumors are ahoat in re-
gard to the number killed. One Is that
several women were killed and borne
of.


Even after the shooting the crowds
stlll hlled the streets, b iltmore street
for several squares from South street
each way, being jammed with people,
rendering 1T almost impossible. In
front of the Middle Police Station, on
North street, nearly opposite the City
Han, where most of the dead and
wounded were taken, the way was
blocked with an excited mass of citizens
eager to learn the names of the unfor-
tunate men. In tins station there are
now lying eight dead bodies and two
wounded.


Meanwhile, as the Fifth Regiment
marched down Howard street they were
hlSsed and also pelted with stones. When
they came near the depot an Immense
crowd was seen extending for several
squares around. Here the riotins be
gan again. The mob filled the lower
part OF the depot, and openly declared
that they would not allow the train
with the soldiers to leave. The engl-
neer and fireman were taken from the
engine, pistols being presented at their
heads. Ths depot they declared would
Dc hred. The police were powerles,
and, although the soldiers succeeded in
entering the cars, they were even then
not safe from danger.


At TO- 50 the Camden Street Station
was fired, and the mob al first refused
70 allow the tiremen to play on the
II lanes, but they We're finally extin-
guished with but little damage, The
train dlspatcher's office on the station
platform was cleared out by the rioters,
and all the Baltimore and Ohio tele
graph wires were cut.


The rioters hold the sout hern part of
the city, where the shops Of the railroad
are, and have started two fires, which
nave been put out. The excitement
even at this late hour, is intense. The
Mayer has issued the following procla-
nation, em bod } ing the Riot act, which
has had no effect. The preliminary cor
1espondence explains itself:

Hewitt Oem.) of New York, stated his belief in the lawful election of Mir. Tilden, and his firm conviction that it the determina- MT. Hayes by declaring the rght of the Vice President to count the votes. Of course the House would not remain passive, and the re- suit would be civil war To avert this disaster he supported this bill

 Mir. Willard Rep.), of Michigan, favored the i bill, and urged that mere partisan considera- l tions should be lost sight of and set aside ill favor of the public interests.

 NIT. Smltn (hep. J, or PennsylVanla, opposed the bill and expressed himself as favoring the counting of the votes by the president of the Senate

 1 Mir. Garfield (Rep.), of Ohio, said that while he admitted the bill had great merits and was l intended to tide over a possibly great public danger, he considered it unconstitutional. He then advocated the right of the president of the Senate to count and announce the electoral vote.

 The House was addressed in favor of the bill 1,TyN I nf Ma onhI1 fS "".

0, that Council stopped all danger OF fire

Mr.. Chandler said that by raising tn

if man had four barrels and put nit

a late law enacted by the Virginia legis-
lature regulating the sale of liquor in
bar-rooms operates. What is called a
registering apparatus was provided for in
the act, aud is described as follows by the
Lynchburg Virginian: ("" On one side is a
crank, and on another dials like those of
a gas meter The bar-keeper turns the
crank round at every sale of drink, a
bell strikes, and the dial registers one.
The object of the device is to determine
the amount of tax to be collected, at the
rate of one cent on every drink. AL
though heavy fine may be imposed for
neglect to use these machines properly,
or for tamperiDg with them in any way
and there are officers whose duty it is
to detect such ofienses-tbe belief is that
they will not answer the purpose, because
drinkers will generally connive at viola
tions OF the law."

Horrible Cruelty and CYiminality


Of q Man.",,"LA CROSSE, Wis.,, Feb. IA horri.
BILE case of child starving has just
come to light near Chaseburg, small
village II miles south Of here, the par
ticulars of which are as follows :
About four years ago Carl Walland
and wife settled on the ridge two
miles from Chaseburg. He was q
rough character, and abused his wife,
and made himself so obnoxious to the
neighbors that they would have
nothing to do with him. During the
first year of his residence in that sec.
ton, when his wife was about to be
confined, he drove her from the house,
and the child was born in the straw
stack. She then went into the house
with the child in her arms, but was
refused admission by the brutal hus-
band. She went to the granary and
q twin brother was born. During
this neglect one of the babies and the
mother died, and the other, being
taken by the heartless father, lived in
poor health. Walland soon married
again and his wife became q mother
about month since. The surviving
child of the first wife died of starva-
tion and neglect on Monday last, and
was buried secretly at night by the
father in the burying-ground. The
new-made grave excited the suspicion
of the neighbors toward Walland,
and on being interrogated he ,ac-
knowledged that his child had died
and had been buried as above stated,
by himself. The sheriff was called
on and the body was exumed and q
coroner's jury summoned which, on
the statement of . physician, brought
in a verdict that the child starved to
death. No arrests have yet been
made, but probably will be to-mor-
row; otherwise the neighbors threat
en- to lynch Walland. The child, al
though two years of age at the time
Of its death, had never walked, and
had lain in crib wallowing in filth
for q week at time."

MINISTER'S SUICIDE,


A few weeks ago your correspondent
telegraphed the Times an account of the
marriage Of Munster, member of the
British house OF commons, to the daugh-
ter of DR.. Henry G. Lynch, of this city.
Mr.. and Mrs. Munster Travelled until

returned TO the city, and have been stop.
ping at the Southern, occupying rooms
there when the alarm of fire was given.
Both escaped from the building, but in
the confusion became separated. Mrs.
Munster WAS taken TO her fathers home,
and her husband went to the room of a
friend, and slept there. At a late hour
this morning he suddenly sprang out of
bed, exclaiming that his wife was at the
hotel. Before he could be stopped he
had snatched up a pistol and fired, shoot
ing himsefthrourh the right temple and
falling dead. His funeral will take place
on Friday. The coroner's jury ton ght
decided that the unfortunate man was
crazed.

England trip. At all the principal stations there
were large crowds with bands. and cannons fired
salutes of welcome as the tram arriy d. The cheer

Vermont and New-Hampshire but it is not the way
of Southern crowds TO wait for somebody TO propose
three regular hurrahs; they break out al once III
series Of sharp, resonant yells, ana repeat
them at every phrase of speech that
suits their fancy. The novelty 10 Nor'h-
ern men in the Kentucky and tennessee

As rule, fully half of every audience was COM
prised of colored people, and it was always much

The run to Nashville was made at the rate of forty
miles an hour, a speed that would be penlous on
almost any otter Southern line, but the Louisville
and Nashville road has steel rails and is ballasted
with stone, and is remarkably well constructed.
I'm his wayside speeches. the Presidents
themes were always the integrity of the
Umon. the supremacy Of the Constitution,
the equal rights ofa citizens, the need of harmony
aud affection between all sections of the country.
His sentiments were. always eheered. There was
great enthusiasm when Wade Hampton made his
appearance. At one station the audiencs was so
rude as TO call on him before waiting to hear the
lTes-ent.


At Nashville the crowds in the streets were i'm
mouse, aud must have included much OF the popu-
laton Of all the neighJOring country. As the pro-
Cession of carriages moved slowly through the
town, escorted by infantry, artillery, and uniformed
societies, and a squadron OF mounted guard, the
demranor of the part-cOlored thrOng-for black
faces were as numerous as white-was one OF iu-
tense curiosity rather than Of enthusiasm. Very
lI,tle cheering was heard at the Capitol The multi
tude was enormous, AID ii quite broke down the
inefficient police force. The President and the ladies
were put into the huilding with some trouble, but
.Ju &c Key was ho.nmed in the mass, and had great
deal Oi difficulty in joining his chief Thenewspaper
correspondents had TO fight with the crowd for posi-
tous aud most of them failed to get near enough to
hear a word Of the speeches. 1t was the worst be-
haved crowd encountered thus far, and the most
uncomfortable; but iis BAD behavior consisted
only in pushing up yet glimpse OF the President
regardless of the comfort and safety of those In
front; and in keeping up such roar Of eJacula-
tiOns during this terrific squeezing process that the
orators vOices were completely drowned ten yards
away from where they stood. those who could
hear applIuded vehemently all reference to
the bravery Of the soldiers ON both sides,
and to the desirablity of mutual friendship
aud esteem between North and South. The
line of march to and from the Capitol LED
through several Of the best streets of resi-
Gmces Most of the houses displayed national
h,gs and the doorways and windows full of
people bOwing and applauding the President
passed


The cornerstone of the new Cnstom-House was
laid by the President in the presence Of another
of spectators. Afterward, with his immediate
party, he dined at the house of wealthy citizen.
Mr.. Hayes, with the ladies' Of the party,
called on the widow Of President Polk, who
lives in a stately mansion near the Capitol. The
Aiaus leum of the dead President Is conspicuous

card reception at private house, and a public re-
cepton in the rotuUda Of the Capitol, where tue
press was intolerabo, completed the days du-

The assumption is first made that our

aborlglnes. Even the negroes here, we are

plaster the ends OF which extended under hts eyes,
ana the signs of ugly cash wero visible





side of his forehead ornansnted with white plastor,
and his LETT ego was very much dscolored. An ac-
count OF tho struggle between these two men in
Thomas Galiaghers saloon, No. 1,109 Broadway, has
already published but further particulars regard
ing it were developed yesterday The fght II seems,
grew out OF the political discussion to the respec
tive merits of Augustus Sche and John Morrissey.
Thomas Lynch offered to bet 500 that John Norris
sey would be elected by Two thousand majority
and Haggery, in u sneerng way, told him he had bet
ter put his money mis- pocket and not throw u away
foolishiy. Lynch then accused Haggerty OF ingrat-
tude toward his avort Morrssey and said that were
1t not for the efforts of the latter gentleman he tHag
gerty) would have been tried and convicted for his as
sault on Thomas Il. Ferris two years before


THEN THE


Haggerty replied stn more bitterly to Lynch and
the latter then struck HagRerty stunning blow.
which knocked HIM back against tho bar Hasgerty
selzcd bottle but before he could make much use OF
It Lynch cinched with him aud the pair fought around
the premises till both ell through glass door and
sustained cuts about their heads. They rolled
over floor, where Ly nch endeswored to pinion
Hasgerty, but successful, the latter managing
II is alleged TO get his revolver out OF his pocket
from too close contact with which weapon Lynch re
treated Haggerty made two attempts 70 shoot Lynch
but the powder being damp either from the blood
that was wing copiousy IRON his wounds or from
perspiraton the pistol merely snapped. Fortunately
before any further damage could be done by either
arrived and took both men TO the Thirtleth street
station house. They refused to make any complaint
against each other but were locked up for the night


Yesterday morning when they were formally al.
ragned before Judge Morgan. officer John IL. Genore
was asked by that magistrate what charge he had tc
prefer, and answered with some hestaton:-


II suppose dIsorderiy conduct""

reporters AS witnesses They managed TO learn good
deal about II last night""


CRITICISM FROM THE BENCH.


Judge Morgan very indignant and further ex
pressed himself this point 10 the effect that II wal
useless for tho people calling the Court TO punish
political brawlers when the police actually refuse
do their manifest duty In collecting the necessary
w,serane wre,ci,s cot into brawl over on Tenth
| avenue there would DO whole crowd OF witnesses
ready 10 be examined and the captain would appear
III person to take charge OF the case. But becaus,
these have certain amount OF so-called potica
influence no case can be made against them""


The Judge then required the officer to make the fol
lowing affidavit IN order to show to the pubic th,
futile testimony brought him in this case, and tina
the frequeut discharge OF political brawlers was not
due their influence over the magistrates:-

IN the negative. Iney were accordingly discharged,

There is great excitement reported
among the miners at California gulch,
near Ora City, Lake county, over the
failure of Messrs. Stevens & Wood of
Detroit, mine operators, to fulfill their
agreement with a number of miners,
brought from Detroit under promise of
steady employment.


The party of minners on arriving at
the gulch, finding no work became des-
perate. They have locked both Stevens
and Wood in cabin, extorted from
them two checks drawn for two thousand
dollars each and placed them under
guard ,gdenying them any outside com
munication. The other minners of the
guch, have joined the mob and lynch
law is threatened


A despatch from Ora City asks for

at the depot Of the Vicksburg aud Me-

1t has been charged that the Independ


ent movement so-called is nothing more


or less than an attempt to re organize the
/ defunct Radical party under new name


with new leaders. 1t cannot be denied
/ that the leaders of such movements ex


pect to get their principal strength from


the voters of the Radical party. Az
such movements certainly have the sym
patby Of the leaders OF the late Radical
party. The desperate effort of the


Times to foster them would be
proof sufficient, but additional proof


is not wanting. The Star, referring to
a call for an independent Peoples
Convention"" in Pamela county, says:


- This call was signed by order of the


g County Executive Committee, S. 4.


Z Blann, Chairman, }. T. Settle, Secreta-


cry Commodore Blann is or was the


"" chairman, and Settle the Secretary, of


g the Radical Executive Committee.


An address has been published by
John r. Lynch, James d. Cessor, j. NJ.
p. Williams, William Landers and H.


w. Weisinger, all negro Radicals, ex=
office holders and leaders of the infa4nous
black line, il which, after citing the sup
posed wrongs which have been inflicted
upon the colored people by she Demo
cratic party, they give this advice:


II an Independent State ticket should be
nominated between this and the election,
then our advice to YOu is to support the In
dependent movem&tif the ticket is made
up OF men who are known TO be honest
competent aud conservative. In the differ
ent counties we would suggest that YOU
make such combinations with substantial
and reliable citizens as Is best calculated to
advance the interests of your respective
counties. secure a fair election aud an hon
est count, and defeat 1ohat is called the regular
Democratic ticket. In Counti's where You
can not make such com binatiOns, and no
Independent State ticket is brought out.
then our advice TO you is to take no part in
the canvass and abstain from voting.


In other words they propose that their
late followers shall 90 Ell masse into the
Independent movements so called. What
for? Because they know that if any man
or set of men receive office at the hands
of the Radicals they will have to take
the leaders of the Radicals into their
councils and will have to divide the APP
pointed offices with them. And that in
but year or two more they will be able
to take possession of the Independent
machine and run it to suit themselves.


Mississippians, the serpent which was
but two years ago coiled about your fair
State and which required of you such
desperate efforts to throw off, is not dead.
Do not deceive yourselves. 1t is only
bruised, and but waits for you to warm
it into life by division, to again wrap the
State in its deadly coil Do you wish to
see the outrages and intamies Of 1870-71-
'72'73-'74'75 repeated? Do you desire
again heavy taxation? Do you wish the
terrible black line whose principal pleas
ure was to defame and insult you again
in possession of your Legislative Halls,
passing Gatling gun bills and the like?


Do you desire to go through another
such campaign as that Of 1875, when some
IF Mississippi's most gallant sons, as at
Clinton and ctner places, had to bedew
he soil of their mother State with their
blood before you could be aroused to ac-
ion? We hope not. We believe not.


Beware of Independents, though they
nay call themselves Democrats. They
ing the syren's song that leads you but
o destruction. Their success will be
weet music to the Radicals. Their sue
ess would bring reproach upon the gal
ant Reform Legislature which did so
ouch to rid you Of Radical oppressors
nd the obnoxious laws passed by them.
heir success this year means two years ,
ence a reorganization OF the Radical {
arty to capture the Legislature. Their
uccess can only be accomplished by di- i
ision among Democrats. Settle your {
ifferences, if there be any, among your f
elves. Forewarned is forearmed. Close f

was arrested in pawnbroker's shop in st.
Louis few days ago after having fatally
wounded one police officer, slightly wounded
another and received o bullet in his own
breast, seems to be very remarkable char
acter. His murderous career has been
marked by rccklessn ess and daring which
indicate an entire ignorance of fear, and
even now that his fate is sealed, while the
terrible doom Of death by Lynch law at the
hands Of an infuriated people stares him in
the face he declares his only wish to
be that he might have club in
his hand when the ceremony takes
place, so that he might brain dozen before
he died. That this is no idle bravado is
faced and fought angry crowds. In August
last, when he robbed the house of Mr..
Belden, in Illinois, and was pursued by
more than twenty men, he killed Mr.. Bel
den, badly wounded another, and effected
his escape. At st. Elmo, In the same State,
he faced the town, shooting down three
persons and making good his fight. Yet,
fend as he is, he is said to be we'll con-
nected, to have received good education,
to write we'll, to love poetry, and to have in
Pennsylvania wife and child, those gen.
orally humanizing ties. Crank Rande""
is, of course an assumed name. He is
described as a handsome man, of good
height, unusually powerful frame, wonder
full activity, and an eye and chin that denote
power and determination OF character.


Now, what is it that has prevented Frank
Rande from being hero instead Of o
brigand and IN outlaw The accident Of
birth? The combinations Of evil asso-
ciations in early life? Vicious training
and the lawless indulgence Of unre-
strained passions? He has the makings
Of o hero in his composition; manly
strength, intelligence and the most
reckless courage. He has even some
notions Of chivalry. II never wronged o
woman"" he says to the Western reporters.
""and never killed man who did not face
me and fight me-"" When he was wounded
and arrested he rallied at the officers, who,
enraQed OF the shooting Of their comrades."

man took charge of him who laid
him in an easy position, placed

LOCAL INTELLIGENCE.

December is as pleasant as May.",,"hepins tomorrow.

 Cotton still higher in Russellville .than anywhere else.

 Mir. John Evants and family, of nover moved to Russellville Monday. Mir. G. A. Parsons, of Dover, was in town Tuesday. Sorry to hear of his bad health.

 W P. wooten & Co. continue to c,ose out their boots and shoes at low 6qure. Don't forget this.

 The small boys of our town will now reyel in the delights of the fire cracker season for few days.

 J. Green Wallace, one of Dover's most promising attorneys, was in town Tuesday, and honored us with call.

 We are pleased to see our young friend. Mir. Eddie Ferguson out again after his long confinement .o the sick room.

 The Globe Dramatic Co. gave a benefit at College Hall last Saturday evening for the Methodist and Baptist churches of this place.

 "". P. Wooten & Go. have come down to a fine point in the way of nrofts. You will save money by ex- amining their choice stock of family groceries.

 The Globe Dramatic Troupe is certainly composed of as clever and genteel company of people as we have ever met on the road, and we wish them much success wherever they may go.

 Prof Charles Hill, who had an ap- pointment out to lecture in Russellville Nov. 25th, on the subject of Spiritual ism. committed suicide by taking poi son, at his home near Bolesville, few days since.

 Don't forget to call at W. F. Woot- en & Co.'S and see the best and most complete stock of family groceries that ever was in Russellyille.

 -ScHooL DIRECTORS. The election last Saturday for two new School Di- rectors passed off very smoothly, and resulted in the election of $. A. Brad Bradley and R. c. Bonds-both good men.

 It has been time honored custom for ye editor and printers to take a weeks vacation during the holidays, !. consequently there will be no paper next Thursday. Our next paper will bear date of January 3, 1878.

 --The streets of our town are in very bad condition-mud every wqere. A town the size of ours and doing the amount of business that we do here, ought to have better streets, and would if we had town council who dared do their duty.

 The Dover correspondence in to- days paper was intended for last issue, but came in just as the press had com menced. It is good enough however to > be readable anyhow. We trust our correspondent will favor us regularly with the Dover news.

 Prof. DeVerdie, who will be re- membered as the man who walked the rope some months ago at this place, recently stabbed his wife at Fort Worth, Texas, and then left. The cit izens followed him, and after five days search he was captured and lynched on the spot.

 The town has been unusually ac- tive the past week, the streets and }. wagon-yards being crowded all the time with wagons from near and far. Newton, Searcy, Boone, and Van Buren counties have commenced to pour their cotton into onr market and it keeps our merchants busy to han dle 1t.

 70, YE OF LITTLE FAITH !-The fol- lowing document was handed us by one of our county officials who having oc- casion to move large flat stone near Russellville found the queer document carefully folded and deposited under the stone. If there is any merit in faith, we suppose ""Edia Jane"" has no longer cause to weep with the tooth- ache:

 ''Now as Edia Jane sat on a marble stone weeping Gesus past by. Gesus saves Edia Jane why weepest thou here. Lord my tooth aches. Arise Edia Jane for my sake and be cured of the tooth ache""

City Council met last evening, In
adjourned session, and in the absence
OF President Litchenstein, Col Febiger
was called to the chair.


Col. Febeger presented a cpmmuni-
cation OF several citizens of this city
protesting against the bill now before
the Legislature in regard to the taxa
tion of the city CT Wilmington I'D or
the maintenance of bridges in viii
mington Hundred. l7 b


The protest was unanimously sup
ported by the Council, aud the clerk
was instructed to lay it in the hands Of
the city solicitor for transm ission 10
the Legislature


Mr. Baker, chairman of the Commit
tee on Legislation reported for action
by City Council, an act in relation 10
the Board of Education.
The act read is what is known as
Senator Rays bill,a synopsis of which
has already been given in the GAZETTE.
The reading Of the bill provoked a
long discussion, in which most of the
members took part. An amendment
was passed making the number OF
members 90.


The bill was very favorable recei-
we'd with exception of the cleuse con,
tanning the property qualification.
| Mr.. IrelaD, said that he did moi
think that all the honest people were
dead yet, and he thought that people
who were psor could hold cffice as
well as those who were rich.
| Mr.. McGlinchey, said that he would
like to vote for the resolution, but VIC
had poor men as equal to hold office,
and vote the distribution of money as
those who were worth millions.


MI. Pickles, thought men who were
worth property was better able to vote
the expenditure of money than men
who were poor.


Mr.. Baker favored the clause, say
ing that he thought man was wsrth
property was better able to take care
of property belonging to others.
| Pending the discussion Mr.. Nc
Glinchey moved to amended the pre-.
vious motion that the bill be accented
as read, by striking out the clause con.
tanning the $1,000 property qualifca.
ton.


After the discussion had closed. Mr.
Paynter moved to amend the amend
ment by inserting, that the property
qualification of member of the Board
of Education be the same as that of 8
member of City Council.


MIR. Paynter's amendment passed
unanimously.


The same committee also reported 8
bill n.ending the passed law ia regarC
to city elections. The bill makes the
qualification of a voter at the city
elections city tax receipt, instead O
a county tax receipt as at present.


On the motion to adopt the repor
of the committee very little debat,
took place, and the report was adopted
by a street party vote the republican,
voting in the affirmative and tn,
democrats in the negative.
i The same committee also reported
bill for the exemption Of certain
marsh lands from city taxation.
Mr.. Lynch moved to lay il on the
table as it was nothing more nor les
than classlegislation.


Mr.. Windle said that he was not il

pay the amount that they were take
for keeping up the banks.
Mr.. Lynch thought it very strang

WAsmxeroE, D. O., Sept. 2sth, 1877.


AS the trip Of Mr.. Hayes and his
friends draws to a close, it is proper to
note the unvarying enthusiasm with
which they have been everywhere re-
ceived. From Louisville to Lynch
burg, in every place SO far visited, the
people have turned out in large num-
bers and, speaking through their best
men, have heartily welcomed their
benefactor. Indeed, so warm and so
general has been the reception given
him that even the most infatuated
HAYES man"" will know better than to
ascribe any political significance to it.


A dozen or 50 of wild Indians ar
rived here lately. They come to treat
with the Government. I don't know
what a wild Indian on the plains or in
the mountains with his war paint on,
may be like, any more than General
Howard does, but these now here are
as dirty and low lot Of creatures, I
should think, as the sun shines on
Some Of them make treaties by day,
and turn a civilized penny by night at
a variety theatre, exhibiting them
selves. It is found to suit the taste Of
q large class to look upon the possible
murderers of Candy, Custer, and the
hundreds of other soldiers who have
been killed in the last few years, and
the show prospers.


Damage was yesterday done to the
Patent Office building to the amount
Of about 100000 by fire. The lower

Fortunately the Land Records, most
of the Patent Records and many
models Of inventions, were in the un,


burned portion Of the building. The


Indian Bureau also located here, saved


its papers. The worst result Of tht
fire will probably be interminable liti
cation growing out Of the loss 0


models. In many cases they canno
be accurately reproduced, and th,
, future Senator Conkling, who gets
large fee for arguing that particula

What surprises us is that shorter work

to lynch law; but that is justitiable and vir-

 The large weeping-willow trees, and some of the monuments and stones, testify to the barbarity of war-the trees by mis- sing branches and the monuments by the large pieces which have been faked from them viewed with the coarse exterior and all of the church, make desolate sight. The oldest stone m this church yard bears date of 1858, but there were undoubtedly interments some time previous to that date, as the town. was founded in 1610.

 G. c. R. LYONS, Iowa. Mar. 18th, 1877. MR. EDITOR. Since my last Feb, 23d, ) we have had genuine winter again. and for two weeks passable sleighing; the fre- quent snow storms replenishing the fast melting snow. Last week a'sPolar wave'' came down upon us and froze tine River over again so that light teams cross on the ice. The ferryman don't like it; he had few days of prosperity and says he went and paid his taxes, but now he wants his money back.

 The Hanford murder trial has just reached it's second ending; verdict ''not guilty"" and the man whom they were al- most ready to lynch in Chicago six months ago, now walks the streets of that city free man in the eye of the law. through the agency of corrupt judge and an ignorant jury, and people are asking what constitutes crime in the city of. Chi cago You will remember that Hanford went to the house of Sullivan in the day time, armed. and demanded sretraction of an article the man had written in rela. tion to his wife. Sullivan replied that he would prove all that be had written at the proper time, wherenpon Hanford called him dirty dog, knocked him down. jumped upon him, and got him by the throat and was pulled of by bystauder, and while the man was holding him, drew his revolver and shot his unarmed victim without receiving scratch. In the first trial the Judge turned advocate and near ly cleared him, whereupon indignation meetings were held. and 5000 signed 8 remonstrance or petition asking the Judge to resign his official robes; but he pock- eted the remonstrance and sat in iudg- ment again on the same case and cleared his man. People are again asking why, in this enlightened age, ignorance is 8 necessary passport to the jury box; if we are to have corrupt judges let us have in- telligent jurymen. It is almost univer- sally conceded that the man was cleared by partisan judge and an ignorant and venal jury. So ends the great Chicago Murder trial, that for days filled broad sides of their dailles and was a seven days wonder and excitement.

 Iowa has just lost her Deaf and Dumb Asylum by fire; no insurance; cost, $25O,- 900! It was located beyond the reach of fire engines. and it is felt that some- body is to blame. At another place a young lady was carrying lamp when it exploded, but help was at hand and prompt action saved her life and the house. On examination, the oil was found to be about 40 proof. and about as safe as benzine or gunpowder.

 Eight years ago, John Gordon planted a nursery of naples in Washington coun- ty, setting the plants 41x6 feet. The next five years the ground was cultivated thor. oughly, and corn was grown. The present Winter he has cut ont every al- ternate row, and got the value of $75 per acre in wood. Some of the trees are thir- ty feet high. In addition to the wood se- cured, he has valuable wind-break, and shelter for stock. A. B."

Hall was filed almost to repletion las,
Wednesday night, by an intelligent and

members OF the Osceola Literary and

of g Love and Hatred ""-as to which

subject was proposed 4"" Resolved, that
love is stronger passion than hatred y
As this subject is closely connected with
and OF vital importance to the human
family, much interest was manifested
by both the debaters and their audience.
The subject was handled, for the most
part, with a degree of confidence and
ability which gave evidence that the
participators in the discussion had been
all along there--been lul!ed and secur-
ed BY the silken meshes OF the one, and
tossed and rackcd by the tempestuous
discord of the other. Frequent ap-
plause, and considerable merriment was
ilicited. as some happy hit was made,
or witty rePartee was invoked, from
the audience, whose earnest attention
was attracted during the entire debate.

lie thought things would DC pretty arranged If

men of New YORK; he regretted that there not
more Southern Governors pre- sent, hut he was glad to
see his brother Governor OF Tennessee there to repre-
sent them. The time had Co mo TO put ASIDE political

riot made by the hoodums of the Bay
City was checked very suddenly. The
firm demeanor of the police the first night
of the move, the prompt measures taken
by the authorities and perhaps above all
these the attitude assumed by the citizens
generally in forming Committee of
Safety, convinced the vicious element
that there was danger of return of the
stirring times of '56, when Judge Lynch
put in an appearance and dealt out justice
with n rigorous hand. 1t is IL thing to be
6eplored that movement sometimes
harmless in itself will draw around it n
class OF rufiians who in its name commit
outrages which the original movers would
shrink from. So in this San Francisco
trouble-from meeting of workingmen,
held to consider the situation of their fell
low workers ir the East and express
sympathy with them, the hoodlums ana
bummers branched out to commence Il
work of violence and devastation. The

ency to convince the viOlators Of law that
the time is not yet II healthy one for them
to commence operations. Committees of

was five stories high and the walls were badly
burned. About six o'clock the walls fell out
ward with terrible crash, breaking through
the roof of coffin store and completely de-
molishing number of sheds and out-houses
Eight firemen under Chief Patten were play
ing upon the roofs of the sheds and coffin store
when the walls fell. They saw the wall begin
to totter and made rush for shed and barely
got inside when they were completely buried
under several feet of hot bricks. Three men,
one OF whom was George Lynch, fireman of
the water works, were killed. After the walls
fell the means of the fremen rent the air, and
band of citizens went to work to dig the
sufferers out. -Four were found beneath a
board fence alive but suffering terribly; five
more were taken out dead; three of them be.
ing recognized as iremen. Their bodies were
terribly disfgured The total number killed
was 8, and wounded 10, two of them fatally.
Many others were slightly injured. The fire is
supposed to be incendiary.


Owing to the extra tax in connection
with the government police, riot occurred
at City Hall, Quebec, Sunday, during
which mob.of 5000 broke in the doors of that
building and of the Recorders Court The
mayor endeavored to address the crowd, but
was met with Kisses. After thus expressing
their indignation, the rioters gradually dis
persed without doing further damage, and the
city is now quiet, though feeling of excite
ment prevails.


THE TURCo-RUSsIAN WAR.


No great battle has yet been fought between
the Turk and Muscovite. Immediately after
the declaration of war the Russian troops
crossed the Turkish frontier in both Europe
and Asia. The Russians opened their cam.
paign in masterly manner, consuming not
over fifteen hours in dashing from the Pruth to
the Danube, seizing the great post of Galatz on
the latter river, and taking possession of the
Roumanian rairoad They now hold the Dan
ube at Galatz and Braila, and the northern, or
Kila branch, to the Black Sea. We shall soon
know whether the Turkish gunboats are able to
hold them from crossing the river. Once on
the southern bank-which soon rises into the
rolling plains of the Dobrudja-it will be diff
cult for the Turks to stay their march south
ward to the rear of the fortress Of Silistria.
The most important question will be the estab-
lishment of secure base of supplies. 1t is
probable that strong force will be massed at
Giurgevo, opposite Rustchuk. The situation
does not admit Of much delay. The Russians
are compelled to make speedy and powerful
effort to break the fortified line of the Danube
at one point or the other, and they will not ac-
complish this without hard fighting.


The latest news of Russian operations simply
indicate that careful preparations are being
made for long campaign, and that active hos
tilities in European Turkey can hardly be ex-
pected for few weeks to come. The roads in
the Dobrudja will be impossible for fort
night, and the Russians are at present en-
ployed in altering the gauge of Roumanian rail-
roads to suit their own, and in constructing
bridge over the Danube at Ibrail.


A convention between Russia and Roumania
has been formed, in which the Prince of Rou-
mania assures free passage and treatment due
a friendly army, and the Gear binds himself to
respect the rights of Roumania. The Roumans
say the convention was to secure respect for
Roumania's position as an individual state in
accordance with the treaty of Paris. 1t imposed
lations nor the duty of lending the cooperation
of her army, Roumania adheriDg to the policy
of attacking no one but defending her frontier
as far as possible. A similar convention has
not been concluded with the Porte because it
had transferred the seat of war to Roumanian
territory and had also persistently refused to
recognize Roumania or settle questions pending
for years. According to the additional conven-
tion the Russians are allowed to use Roumani-
an roads, railways. rivers and telegraphs. The
resources of the coantry are placed at their
disposal for the supply of the army. The Rou-
manian authorities are to assist in erecting
camps and forwarding the baggage Of Russian
military trains and kilograms are to have prece-
dence of ordinary traffic. The Russians are
empowered to complete unfinished railroads
and the necessary ground for the purpose is
ceded. The chief of the Russian military traf-
fc is empowered, subject to the approval of the
Roumanian minister Of works, to dismiss Rou-
manian railway officials, and the Russians are
TO be allowed to establish military stations and
hospitals anywhere except in Bucharest.


Roumania will, if required, provide material
for the construction of boots, ships and bridges.
Articles intended for the Russianlarmy will be
admitted into Roumania Free The Roumanian
authorities will assist in capturing Russian de-
serters. ALI the expenses incurred through the
passage Of the Russians are to be paid in money
within two;months.


The explanatory report annexed to the con-
vention says Russia is obliged to intervene in
Turkey because Mussulman fanaticism and
weakness of the Turkish government allow no
hope of reform, and as Russia desired to re-
spect the inviolability of Roumania, the present
convention was concluded.


Servia is greatly excited, and there is an agi-
tation for war among the members of the
Skuptschina. Servia has received million
roubles, probably from the Sclavonic commit
tee. The permanent committee of the Skupt.
selma has protested against any forced occupa-
ton of Servia territory by the Turks. The
Servian militia, cavalry and artillery have been
ordered to keep the wagons and horses ready.
The brigades of Shumaida, Drina and Valsevo
are ordered to be in readiness. Large numbers
of recruits arrive every day for drill.


As soon as war was declared the Russian
army in Asia, 100000 strong, was set in motion.
The main army left Gunri or Alexandropol,
and advanced in a direct line on Kars, which
is only 36 miles or two days march from the
ANuSotdu lIUuI.CIs LuCIc, dCCOAuIuS "" buo 1ecus
ter telegram from Erzeroum (12O miles to the
Southwest), battle began at daybreak on Sun
day. Kars is situated on a rugged plain,
5000 to 1000 feet above the sea on the Kars,
branch of the Arpatchai. 1t is defended by
ramparts surrounded by ditch. and has
strong citadel, and some works on the hills
north Of the city. In the battle the Russians
claim to have been victorious. The Turks
also claim to have defeated Russian dvi-
sion near Erzerum. AT present the Turks
have 900 men in Armenia.


Intense enthusiasm prevails throughout the
Gar dominions. Russia has 3O0,0 900 men on
the Danube and 125,0OO men.in Caucasus, while
the opposing forces of Turks are 100000 along
the Danube and $4,000 or less in Asia Minor
Both sides exhibit weakness in skilled gener-
ais, and the position in Roumania is Eunfortu-
nate Austria and Russia are contemplating
an agreement whereby Bosnia will be ceded to
Austria. The Gar is not desirous to conquer
the territory for himself, but will be guided by

Rarely is Central Park found SO thinly populated on

and the picture that recalls In overhauling tho

by tho mdness OF tho weather, which yesterday was

the occasion for it should have arisen""-

press insurrectiou or repel invasion, but
to be on hand to answer the call of the
local authoritless, in case in their judg

Now, II oil those courteous words

having all the timber of practical action,

course pursued was indefensible,"" We do
not understand the use of language. II
we know anything of the temper of the
Governor, or of the brief history Of his
ad ministration. then whenever, wherever,
aud homercr, under the Constitution, the

peace maintained, it will be done And il

ably find ample occasion for the exer

Mr.. Baker called up for its third
reading, and final action the ordinance
in relation to the cleansing of the streets
by contract.


The first section provides for the divi-
sion OF the city into four districts, Mar
line.


The second section provides for adver-
tising for proposals ia two newspapers
OF the city by the Street Commissioner,

awarded by that body, the contractor to

and Council.


Sec. 4, provides for the payments, 1-1O
to withheld by the city in case of the
contractors failing to fulfill his contract.


Sec. o, provides that all questions of dis
pute that may arise shall be submitted to
the mayor, whose decision in the matter
shall be final.


The ordinance upon the eyes and nays
being called passed unanimously.


Mr.. Adams called up for its third reading
the ordinance reorganlzing the fire depart
ment. The provisions oi the ordinance have
already been published in these columns
therefore mskiDg it unnecessary 10 publish
them.


Five sections were read and passed with
out debate, hut upon the reading OF the
sixth section Mr.. Baker moved TO amend
by striking out the word engineer.


Mr.. McGlinchey thought it au impos
ition not to allow company 10 test line
OF hose, after they had purchased it, to see
whether it would stand the test. He thought
that the firemen ought to have some privi-
lege, did not want to see Council grind
them down. They received no THANKS for
for what they had done anyhow.


Mr.. Febiger said that be was opposed to
the testing OF hose by the companies, for
afterwards it was not as good by fifty per
cent.


Mr.. McGlinchy replied that his reasons
fnr al in anip ta taat hai In
hose was founded upon good grounds.
Some few years a committee Of Council pur-
chased a quantity of hose for which they
paid s. 1.30 per foot. The Water Witch re-
ceived some OF the hose, and it was abso-
lutely good for snothing 1T was so rotten
that it would stand being reeled on the hose
carriage. Tue company after sending seven
of the ten sections back petitioned Council
to allow them to buy their own, which
privilege was granted. A committee of
the company then went to Philadelphia,
and purchased hose for Is cents per foot
which they have yet, and is in a good con-
dition. He hoped that the Council would
allow them to test the hose, and not allow the
fireman as we'll as the citizens to be i'm
posed upon.


Mr.. Baker said that there was another
way to test the hose besides the engines
LuuL IL ny uJuIObtdllC pItehuIOs


He denied that the city had ever paid
$1.30 per foot for hose and detied any man
to lay his finger upon any act where
the city had ever paid that price.


Mr.. Stotsenburg said that he was an old
fireman, and he thought that $1,000 year
was to much for company.


Mr.. Lynch had been fireman as long as
any one, he deted any member OF Council
to have run to more fires than he had.
Talk about $500 being to much torun al fire
company, why when he was fireman it
cost equally that much if not more, and the
young men would go down into their pock
cts, and kelp support the company. but
now they could not afford it.


Mr.. McGlInchy moved to amend the
amendment by striking out the words ""or
hose"" The section then passed.


The seventh sectien was then taken up
read and adopted.


1t then being 1890 o'clock Mr.. Febiger
moved that the further consideration OF
the ordinance be postponed until next
meeting night. Lost,


He then moved to adjourn. Which was
adopted.

The adjourned session of CITY Council
last evening, was prolonged until 10 o.
CLOCK. The main business before the body
being the consideration OF the bill to be
presented to the Legislature abolishipe
the Board of Revision. The bill was
read by sections and objections being
made to a number Of them as read the
debate at times was rather spirited. The
ayes and nays were frequently called and
dilatory motions were made in profusion
Rules governing the Council were read,
and the rulings of the chair frequently
objected to. .faf ~ TU


Al 8 o'clock President Lichtenstein
called the Council to order and stated
that the business before the body was the
consideration of the bill reported by the
COMMITTEE on Legislation abolishing the
Board of Revision, which was read on
Thursday evening and referred back to
the committee for amendments. -
But few amendments were made.
the most important one being in
secton l, which transfers the appoint
ment OF the three persons to constitute
the Board of Revision, Appeals and As
sessments from the Superior Court, to
the City Council. Two of the members
shall be of the political persuasion as
the dominant party the other as same as
the minority. No person to be appoint
ed unless he voted atthe city election and
the owner of unincumbered property to
the amount of $1,000. ''


After the section had been read and a
motion made to adopt it. Mr. Lynch NOV
ed to amend by striking out the words
Council shall appoint, and inserting in
lieu thereof, the majority in Council shall
appoint one, the minority one, and the
Chancellor one. The amendment was
lost, there being only two votes in the
aHrmatlve. The motion to adopt was
then passed. aHi tA-


Section 2, in relation to prescribing the
oath of office was passed without dis
senting vote


section 3, which prescribes the power
OF the Board over tho assessors. was also
adopted. Mr.. Lynch voting in the ne
gative.


Section 4, is completely new, and pre-
scribes that at the city election in 1877
there shall be elected four assessors as
follows: Ff I-. n.


For all that portion of the city north of
9th ST., and west of Market, to be the first
district; north of Sixth street, and east of
NJ arket, including the Ninth ward, to be
the second district; south of Sixth street
and east of Market the fourth. The as
SCISSORS shall have power to collect all
taxes in their districts.


Mr.. Febiger wished to know what in
cluded Sixth street, ,as twas not named in
the bill.


Mr.. Baker, said that the division was
Just the same as in the old bill There
being no further debate the section was
adopted.


Section provides that no person shall
be elected as assessor unless he was the
owner of $500 unincumbered property
six NOR this previous to election.


Mr.. Baker moved to adopt the section
as read. ... ..t.t.


Mr.. Lynch, moved to amend by strik-
ing out the property qualification, and
making it freehold security, as there was
many an honest man who did not own
any property who might want the posi-
ton. but under the present section he
could not get it.


Mr.. Baker stated that it was just fol-
lowing the present law.


Mr., McGlinchey seconded Mr.. Lynch's
amendment.


The chair said that it would be better
to strike out the whole section.


Mr.. Pickles said he hoped that the
amendment would not prevail, as he
thought property holder could best
Judge of the value of property.


Mr.. McGlinc hey thought that there
was many poor mechanic who was
better able to judge of the value of pro-
perty than some who own it, as the
matter carries no weight with it, he
thought that it had better be striken out
as it deearred many good man from
obtaining the office,


Mr.. Lynch could not see any thing but
what was just i'll striking out the section
as all of the assessors would have to give
bond.


Mr.. Baker, thought man would have


Mr.. Baker thought man would have
a hard cheek to ask person to go ON
his bond if he did not own any property
A man may be poor and honest but he
could not get credit as soon as man
who owned property.


Mr.. McGlinchey said that when man
gave bond that the bondsmen were
always looked to for the money if he was
a defaulter.


Mr.. Baker. The gentleman does not
know what he is talking about


Mr.. McGlinchey, perhaps the gentle
man is measuring by his bushel


The question being called on the amend
ment it was rejected by vote of - to 3,
and the section adopted.


Section 6, designating the time for the !
assessments, aud collections passed with |
out objections. s Isr


Section z, exempiing certain real es-
tate, was passed without objections,


Section 8, designating the time for the |
completion of the assessment and deliv- |
cry of the same same to the Board. The |
section furthermore provides that the
Board shall have power to alter the as
sessments and If the person SO appealing |
was not satisfied they could appeal to |
City Council which shall set for three |
days, and their action should be final in
the matter.


Mr. Febiger said he could not vote for |
that the section as it stood because it had |
all the bad features of the old bill, and if |
they did not get their appeal granted iu
the Board every mothers son of them
would run to Council, therefore he NOV
ed to strike out the part in relation to
City Council sitting as Board of Ap-
peals.


Mr.. Lynch called for the ayes and
nays. ..s


Mr.. McGlinchey had heard the bill
read on Thursday night and the only
good feature about it was the first section.


The ayes and nays were then called.

part in reference to Citv Council and

excused.

Its History, Traditions and Re

 EOuTceS.",,"Upon the organization of the Territory in

 1864, Yuma and Mohave counties were

 comprised in its Second Judicial District Hon. J. P. Allen was its first judge, follow

 ed by Hon. H. Il. Cartier brother of Judge

 Cartier of Washington, and, by Hon.

 Isham Reavis. To Judge Reavis sue

 ceeded Hon. De Forest Porter, re-appointed

 in 1876 and now on the be lch. Hon Chas.

 H. Brinley, at that time county recorder,

 was first clerk of the court

 The first sheriff Was Ike Bradshaw, who

 afterwards gave his name to the celebrated

 mining district near Prescott. Then came Dave King King was dig ring a well out on the new road from Colorado to Wick enburg; he worked down below and had mhn on top running the windass. When the well was about 100 feet deep some ruff fans came along, killed his man, robbed the camp, threw corpse, windass and rope down ono King and went off John Duff was then riding the mail to Prescott. He came along soon after and passed by the well to see now Dave was getting along Fortunately he had escaped unhurt. Duff got help and a rope and hauled him out. A party under Creed Bryant then started after tie murderers, whom they overlook near the Gila and aid not bring back Duff wLs aftcrward member.or the Boa. q of Supervisors. Before coming 10 Arizona he il i'd been second mate of the old Senator running between San Diego and San Fran cisco under Capt. Seeley. King resigned his office as sheriff and the appointment WIS si;en to NJ. D. DobLins who had come out here as Lieut. Colonel Of Caiforn d volunteers. In 1868 JameS T. Dana was elected, and in 1870 he was reelected. His tenure of office was bloody one, several men falling under his ready pistol. In September, 1S70 while trying to arrest al Indian, he Was shot in the side with an arrow; it had glass head, of which frag ment lodged in his liver, soon killing him. George Tyng was then appointed to fill the unexpired term, and was elected to the office in 1872. He resigned in 1873 and was followed byF II. Goodwin. WA. Wernin gerwas elected in 1874 and again in 1876.

 The present county officers are De Forest Porter, district judge; W. A. Wcrninger, sheriff; A J. Finlay (also mayor of the viii lage Of Yuma) treasurer; H. N Alexander, probate judge; George Tyng, recorder; supervisors, A. L: Grow, A. Lorette and I. Lyons.

 To Yuma county belongs the doubtful credit of having the first execution under Lynch law in Arizona, IS also the first ju- | dcial hanging. In 1865 the bulk of popu 1 lation was at La Paz ard there remained the peace officers of the county. Army teamsters and ruffians of all kinds were making life here unendurable-

 In January, 1866, Jack Ewing and Joe Bowers murdered a government wagon mister over in the Rincon, about where the ! Mexican saddlery now stands. He had his ! train loaded and was about to start for Wickenburg over the now unused road via Woolsey's hot springs He went and laid ! aown on Bowers bed and fell asleep. Ewing and Bowers came in and just beat his head ! to pieces. Old Jack Hinton, Capt. Wilcox, other prominent citizens got together Lere and organized | v.gilanc, committee. The murdelers fled but were soon Cverhauled |, and brought back. A jury of six was sworn and fair trial given them. A block and |. tackle was rigged to big mesqult tree i that used to stand down by Doten's black. i smith shop. Jack Ewing confessed hIs guilt and was swung up, every white man in town being compelled to take hold of the | rope. The evidence against Bowers was positive; his pistol was bent and had blood | and hair on it when taken from h.m. But his life was savc>: by streak of magnan- unity in Ewing, who sworc that he alone had killed the wagon master. After tLat the town was qu;et for awhile. |

 The first judicial hanging in Arizona was done here in 1873 by Sheriff Goodwin, tie subject being one of the murdcrers of- M !. Mccartney. better known along the river by the Sobriquet of Rawhidc""\

Eugene Lynch, of this city, had hear
ing on charge of embezzlement prefer
red by ID. Lemon d Co.


The evidence of the plaintiffs was to
the effect that Lynch, several months ago,
was employed as an agent by ID. Lemon
d Co., to drive wagon around the coun-
try and make sales Of candy and cakes.
That after making some half dozen trips
his account of stock taken out, and of
stock and money returned did not bal
ance by SLIGO. and accordingly, after re-
peated attempts to effect settlement, the
charge of embezzlement was preferred.


The defendant was represented by
Henry Z. Turner, Esq, who cross-ques-
toned the witnesses, and briefly argued
the case, holding that the circumstances
did not come under the provisions of the
statute in relation to embezzlment. The
defendant was then held in 5000 bail for
his appearance at Court."

CoROSER'S VERDICT AGAINST THE CHINESE.


The moderation displayed by the citzcns with the

TACT that throughout tho day, and by common

BEAVER VALLEY.",,"BEAVER VALLEY, PA, June 13.-
Within the past week numerous attempts
at highway robbery have been made by
masked men. Several houses in the sur
rounding country have been entered and
robbed of everything valuable that could
be conveniently carried off. Yesterday
afternoon, at late hour, the residence
of George Thompson. W ell-to-do dairy
man, was broken into and robbed. As
the masked burglars were leaving the
premises they were met by Thomas Burns,
hired man about the place. Burns, in
trying to prevent the departure of the
robber, was shot and killed. Now that
the depredators have added murder to
their other crimes, much excitement has
been caused. Vigilance committees have
been formed by the farmers and others,
and lynching is freely talked of."

no longer, but vivid 90 lightning, red
as fire'glObes, and glAFiBg as twin
meteors. The whole soul was IN bic
eyes; the full soul streamed out Of hls
face. Then, without besloWing an al
lusion to Prentiss, be turned short
around on the perjured witnesses Of
Hopklns, and tore their testimony into
threadP, and hurled IN their faces such
terrible invectives that ell trembled
Ike aspens, and two of them fed from
the Courthouse.


The excitement of the crowd was
becoming tremendous. Their united
life and soul seemed to hang upon the
burning tongue Of q stranger, and be
inspired them with the power Of his
passions; no seemed TO have stolen Ma
lures long hidden secret of attraction.
But his greatest triumph was to come.


His eyes began TO glance at the as.
sassin Hopkins, as his lean, taper fin.
gers assumed the same direction. He
hemmed the wretch within a wall of
strong evidence and impregnable argu-
ment, cutting of all hope OF escape |; he
dug beneath the murderer's feet bitches
Of diIemmas, and held up the slanderer
to the scorn and contempt of the popu-
lace. And having thus girt him about
with circle Of fire, he stripped him
self TO the work OF massacre.


Oil then 1t was vision both glori.
ous and dreadful to behold the orator ;
his actions became as impetuous as the
motion OF an oak in q hurricane; his
voice became q trumpet filed with
wild whirlwinds, deafening the ear
with crashes Of power, and yet inter.
mingled all the while with a sweet un.
dersong Of the softest cadence; his
forehead glowed like o heated furnace,
his Countenance was haggard, like that
Of maniac, and ever and anon he
flung his long, bony arm on high, as II
grasping after thunderbolts.


In such appalling coloTs did he draw
picture Of murder, that, in compari.
son, hell itself might seem beautiful /;
he painted the slanderer 80 black, that
the sun seemed dark at moor. day when
shining on such monster. And then,
fixing both portraits on the shrinking
Hopkins, fastened them there forever.
The agitation Of the audience amount.
ed almost to madness.


All at once the speaker descended
from the perilous height; his voice
walled out for the murdered dead, and
living-lbe beautiful Mary, moro beau
tiful every moment as her tears flowed
faster and faster, till men wept and
sobbed like children.


He closed by o strong exhortation TO
the jury, and, through them, to the by
ISLANDERS: the panel, after they should
bring In verdict for the plaintiff, not
to offer violence to the defendant,
however richly he might deserve it.
In other words, ""not to lynch the vii.
lain, but leave his punishment 10
God"" This was the most artful trick
Of all, and calculated to insure ven.
geance.


The Jury rendered q verdict of fifty
thousand dollars, and the night after.
ward Hopkins was taken out Of HE
bed by the lynchers aud beaten almost
To death. As the Court adjourned the
stranger said:


""John Taylor will preach here this
evening at early candle.light,""


AS announced, be did preach and the
house was crowded. l have listened
10 Clay, Webster aud Calhouu-to
Dwight, Bascom and Beecher, but
never heard anything In the form of
sublime words even approximating to
the eloquence of John Taylor-massive
as q mountain, and wildly rushing as
a cataract Of FIRE."

Gov. Stone, Ii. Gov. Sims, and Hon.
T.. C. Catchings addressed large and
intelligent audience Of Ladies had gen.
tlemen at the Court.house yesterday.
As il was late 10 the evening when the
speaking closed, and our columns were
already filed, we cannot give even a
short synopsis Of the addresses. Suffice
It 10 say that everybody was delighted
with the speeches, except few social.
ed Independent candidates, and the
scathing rebukes they received at the
hands OF all the speakers were enough
to make almost any man 60 and hang
himself. They asserted that The Inde.
pendents were brought out by the Rad
icals-that the Radicals were ordered
by Lynch, Cessor and others 10 make
terms with the Independents and vote
for them in order n deieN the Demo.
cratic nominees, and that secret circu.
lars were being circulated among the
Radicals, telling them that /, was 10
the interest Of the Radical party In the
future that they vote for Independents,
and thus make Republicans Of them at
the next election.


This was the first speech we had
ever heard Gov. Stone make, and we
confess we were very agreeably disap-
pointed, because we had heard be was
not very fluent speaker, His speech
was sensible, practical, ogical and 10
the point-abounding in statistical in.
formation and practical suggestions,
and was delivered in an essy and grace
full manner. He showed the people
that the Democratic party had, in two
yearP, reduced taxation more than one
half, and at the same time given them
an honest judiciary, an honest State
government, and honest county govern
ment instead OF the miserable THE wing
concerns they had, and that they had
given the colored people better schools,
and five instead of four months free
school, and at the same time established
friendly relations between the two
races."

One of the most respectable and satisfac-
tory wars of which there is any account is
that which determined the doubtful point
OF supremacy between Rome and Alba.
Five men and one woman were the only VIC
TINS There might have been millions
slain and the point remained doubtful
under the ordinary system of the use OF
armed force, but the early peace societies OF
Rome exhibited their influence on that oc-
casion, and the ordinary plan was set aside.
Either the Roman and Alban equivalents OF
Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips had
howled their agitation against the war or
the contractors had proved unable to equip
an army, or there was some other good rea-
son, for it was agreed that supremacy as
between the cities should be the stake in
great prize fight to be fought by three
on a side, and by this championship sys-
tenn the slaughter and horrors OF great war
were prevented. Our readers will perceive
that leaf has been taken from the Roman
history in the conduct of the great issue
between Tammany and anti-Tammany III
the Seventh district. Tammany and anti
Tammany, like Rome and Alba are disposed
to economize blood and muscle and not put
the whole world by the ears. Hence the
fierce combat Of Haggerty and Lynch, the
accepted champions Of the two sides. 1t
was understood, of course, that as this
combat should 60 the candidate of one
or the other side should be counted
in; but alas the struggle was inde-
cisive This was not the fault of the
champions, but Of the metropolitan police,
which was quite overlooked in the arrange
ments, perhaps because it did not appear in
the course of the Roman battle. Dur
ing the conflict the champions threw one
another through u glass door, which was
not done by either Romans or Adams.
Neither did the Romans or Adams snap
pistols Mt one another, which shows that the
ancient combat was rather tame by compare
son with the modern. 1t was the failure Of
the pistol to respond to the swapping that
rendered the battle indecisive, and some in
quiry should be made as to the cause Of that
failure. Perhaps there was treachery.
Either some anti-Tammany emissary had
tampered with the caps on Haggerty's pistol
or poor ones had been supplied him, and it
should be known which was the real cause.
Until that point is settled we fear the battle
cannot be renewed."

Lucy j. Freeman, a bright mulafto girl
10 years Of age, whose clothing was blaz-

street, near Sixth avenue, at midnight on
Tuesday, and shrieked for some one to
smother the flames, In an instant the
whole neighborhood was excited. The
burning girl was visible to persons a block
away. Men divested themselves of their
overcoats, and with such articles of cloth

carried her into her boarding place In
West Twenty-seventh street. Some un-
known man had set fire to her dress. The
story of the tragedy was yesterday told by
Mrs. Lou Winters, the landlady of the
house.


On Tuesday night man of medium
height, of forid complexion, and wearing
sandy side whiskers, rang the door bell.
He wore silk hat, dark pantaloons, light
colored frock coat, and dark overcoat.
Mrs. Winters ushered him into the par

The visitor said that he had no intention
OF calling on any especial person. Lucy
Freeman spoke to him and, although she
and the stranger seemed unacquainted
they went from the parler to room on
the second story. Soon after he had
withdrawn from the parlor, Mrs. Winters
heard a noise as of stamping of feet ovei
head. She hurriedly entered the hall.
way, and went up the staircase. Then
Lucy freeman burst open the door. She
was enveloped in flames, and she ran in,
to Mrs. Winters's arms. The latter's
clothing took fire, and she freed herself
from the burning girl, who went headlons
down the stairway. The unknown mar

Little He'll Gate in It's present state is not used ex-
cept, perhaps by small fishing boats, and necessity
exists lor its Improvement IL not proposed TO In
tericre with the Harlem or Bronx Kills, separating
Randalls Island from the main land, because this
channel has been considered important after certain
needed improvements, as connection between the
Harlem River and He'll Gatc for the service OF vessels
to and from the East Under the present regime the
currents through those passes are OF no benefit TO
tho Harlem RIVER ana as ,s TO tdai exchange snos
and gains in the ebb, making 1t difficult to decide
whether the loss is not greater than the gam But as
these points, viz, the currents and the tidal ex
change the influences OF these passes trivial AZ is
now for good III, will be obcrated by tho changes
consequent upon the Improvement OF Hell Gate and OF

The commissioners OF Emigration, hearing Of tho

visited Wards Island yesterday, and after thorough
inspection OF the ground, unanimously resolved to
oppose the measure and protest against II. There

transit the people have from Harlem TO the ouhern
portion OF the city. They also argue that the swift
rush of waters between the Sound and Harlem River
by Little He'll Gate Is great help to navigation, and
that its close would bring the Harlem River toward
the character OF mill pond, and Tor months ~ winter
the uptown residents would have reliable means or

The Eighth Ward Contest.

THE VOTES OPENED AND COUNTED
BY COUNCIL-WM W. SIMMONS 81


DECLARED ELECTED .,'f5",,"DECLARED ELECTED. ~


The City Council held special meet |
ing last evening, President LIchtenstein
in the chair, for the purpose of deciding
the contest of VIM. W. Simmons, Repub.
lican candidate for Inspector in the |
Eighth Ward, against the election of
Taylor Gill, Democrat. All the members
were present.


The chair stated the object of the meet
ing, and the grounds of the protest, and |
hoped that the verdict Of Council, what |
ever 1t might be, would be unanimous.


At the suggestion of Mr.. Taylor, the
petition Of Mr.. simmons was read,


Mr.. Baker moved that the Inspector
and Assistants who held the election in
the Eighth Ward ON the 4th instant, be
called before Council and examined in
relation to the count of the ballots.
Adopted. p ~


Mr.. Paynter called for the reading of
section % OF the city charter which was
read by the Clerk. 1t provides the man
ner and form in which election contests
shall be decided by the City Council.
Walter Cummins, Esq, then arose and
stated that he represented the respondent
in this contest, but Mr.. johnson promptly
raised the point of order that he had no
right TO speak at that time.


The chair declared the point well
taken.
Mr.. Paynter moved that Mr.. Cummins
be heard.


Mr.. Baker thought the subject was one
for Council to determine, and that no
lawyers were needed to tell the members
what to do.


Mr.. Taylor thought it was proper in all
contests or investigations for the parties
to be represented by counsel if they de-
sired.


After Sine further discussion Mr..
Paynter's motion was lost by strict
party vote, as folio ws:


| Yeas-Messrs. Guthrie, Hazlett, Knight
Lynch, Maxwell, Norton, Paynter, Tay-
lor, Townsend-9.


Nays-Messrs. Adams, Baker, Chandler,
Conrad, Davis, Downing, Evans, John
son, Jones, Price and President Lichten-
stein--11.


George W. Hepbron, the Inspector of
) election in the Eighth Ward, was then
called, and was qualified by Esquire
O'Neil.


The witness was questioned by Mr..
Baker, and testified substantially to the


following effect.


That at the recent election held in the
( Eighth ward, there were certain ballots
cast containing the name of Joseph W.
, Wells for Inspector, and that these bal
lots were counted for Taylor Gill, the
) Democratic candidate. These tickets
; were Democratic splits, with the name
of Francis Vincent for City Treasurer
e and also had the names of the Inspector
and Assistant transposed, the former
where the latter ought to be and utce
cersd. Witness said there were about
o three of these tickets, and that none OF
! the election officers objected to their be-
: ing counted in accordance with the evi-


nent desire Of the persons voting them


Also that he wanted to count them as
9 cast, but Mr.. McAllister, the Republican
!, Assistant, proposed to count them fol
d Mr.. Gill, r....f. ~rt.t5f.f
Mr.. McAllister was next sworn, ant
, testified that several split Inspectors ticl
d cts were voted, and that he proposed tC
: count them exactly as cast, but the 9th
q ers objected and said there was no use il
q doing so. Witness said that Mr.. Hep
P. born told him there were three of those
70 tickets, and then he asked the clerk how
J. the vote stood. The clerk said five ma
e iaority for the Democrats and witnes!


then thought the three votes "" ould maxi
no difference in the result. The mex
,r afternoon witness saw the result of the


vote in the newspapers, noticed it Wa'


close, and then began to think there wa


more than three OF the doubtful ticket


voted. He thought the election was a
fair and peaceful as any ever witnessed
~ ~ Thomas DonneIly, the Democratic AS


slstant, was next sworn and testified tina


he put all the tickets back into the bo


as they were counted.

80 tilted that the box had been kept in hi
er Office since the election, and had not, t


the best of his knowledge, been tampel

travelled with child which was taken
sick. Lynch affirmed that it was possessed
by a devil, and to drive out this evil spirit
he and his wife pitched the child across

frequently fell, striking the floor, during
this performance. At last it struck joist,

The trial lasted thrco days, and the COURTROOM WAS

The Republican party of the North will soften into acquiescence with the Presidents policy. or will harden into opposition and renewed hostility, ac- cording as the Southern white shows himself just or unjust, kind or cruel. in his treatment of the colored race, and of the Southern Republican party, now tenn porarily at his mercy. We are sorry to say that recent events at the south, though promising well in some quarters, are far from reassuring in others.

 All who have examined the election muddIes of last winter will remember that the 'tface of the returns"" in South Caro- lima showed the choice of Hayes electors, and that part of the Republican, State tick ct also had small majorities. The party now dominant. however, has practically forced the Republican state officers, whose orinaG fGcie title is at least as good as Hampton's into withdrawal. Moreover the Hampton House of Repre- sentatives had the exceeding bad taste to annoy and humiliate the members of the ""Mackey"" or Chamberlain House, who have sought to unite with them since his downfall, with proceedings for ''purg- ing their contempt"" Each Republican member has been called to the bar of the. House, and force to beg forgiveness in the humblest terms for his adherence to Chamberlain. Such an exercise of power. even if legal, is, under all the circum- stances. extremely ungenerous and un- wise. Did the National government ever attempt the personal humiliation of the white majority of that House by demand ing apologies for the crime of treason of which probably everyone of them has been guilty With how much better taste and feeling was the business of reconcilia- ton managed in Louisiana, when its two | legislatures merged into one.

 But such refusals of right, and such ar- rogant treatment of conquered opponents. are small matters compared with last weeks outbreak of political savagery in Mississippi. The story as it reaches us through the dispatches of the Associated Press is a sufficiently horrible one: On Thursday, the 26th ult., John w. Gully, prominent citizen of Kemper Co.,, Miss. was assassinated by some person unknown. On Saturday two negroes made affidavit charging that one Benjamin Rush was the murderer, and that he had been instigat- ed to commit the crime by Judge Chisolm, Republican candidate for Congress in that District, last fall, his son, John P. Gilmez, and two other Republicans nam- ed Rosenb baum and Hopper. Judge Chi solm and his son were at once arrested and thrown into prison at DeKalb, his wife and daughter insisting upon sharing their confinement. As Gilmer was being brought there, the next day, he was set upon by a mob and killed. The crowd next took advantage of the changing of the of the jail guard to attack and over- power the jailos. Chisolm got possession of some of tho guns left by the retiring guard, shot a DrRosser dead. and sev- erely wounded nephew of the deceased Gully, who was among the assailants. The young son of Judge Chisolm was shot dead, whether by the mob or, accidentally by his father, accounts differ. Firing now became general and promlscuous, !"" says the fuller of the two reports, ""Lhi- solm's wife and daughter chung to him, the latter receiving a wound in the wrist. Chisholm himself fell desperately, ,and it IS supposed mortally wounded, but he still survives. One Mcclellan, an adherent of Chisolm, and of the inside guards, who remained, somehow escaped from the building, but was killed immediately aft erward.' One account says that Hopper and Rosenbaum were lynched by the mob; another that they were not hurt.

 Chisholm, Gilmer, and McClelland, are leading Republicans, served in the Con- federate army during the war. and have held important offices since Reconstruc- ton. Judge Chisholm is a man of proper ty and held the office of Probate Judge before the war. He and Mir. Gilmer were witnesses before the U. s. Senate commit. tee on Privileges and Elections, last win. ter, and have lived in constant dread oi assassination ever since. Indeed, there can be little doubt that their political enemies took advantage of the murder oi Gully to arouse the public hatred to such a pitch as resulted in the cowar,lly massa. ere detailed above. The charge on which they were arrested. it will be observed, was not that of murder, but only of insti gating murder, and the improbable story rests on testimony that Southern Democrats are wont to consider unrelia , ble. But the result accomplished is the 7 wholesale slaughter of the Republican l leaders of 8 county, if not of Congres [ sional District.

 Even the New York World, paper no l very easily moved by massacre of negroe. or carpet baggers. sees the need o prompt action on the part of the Missis. , slppi authorities:

 The affair offers the Democratic gov.

  ernment of the State an opportunity o proving to the country promptly its title to authority. Governcr Stone, we trust will lose no time in showing that he is , made of different stuff from Adslbert !; Ames. and the good citizens of Mississip l pi, without distinction of parties, should gather to his support and make the evi

 disposed understand at once that the ers

 of anarchy and lawless bloodshed ther, 3 has passed away forever.

 A week has now passed since the frs report of this horrible affair reached us - yet we hear of no arrests. or attempts. t, E arrest. The Republican party is practical Q ly.'wiped out""of large section of Missis r sippi, and there is not even pretense o - punishing its murderers. It is atrocitiel ,, like this that may turn Hayes into non ], entity. and stamp his policy a failure

 Thank You've are under obligations to MT. Bower, of Salisbury, for late files of Australian papers.

 Left Over.-We are sorry again to be obliged to say we must leave out valued correspondence, but such is the case. Shall use all next week. I

 Gard of Thanks.-The ladies' aid scci- ety of the Falls Village M. E. church pre- sented their pastor a beautiful dressing gown for Christmas present, for which he returns his sincere thanks. w. c. s.

 A Valuable Christmas present.-The friends of the Key. J. G. Oakley at Lake vile, have presented him with a set of Ap- pleton's American Cyclopedia, 16 vols, bound in sheep price $96.oo. A worthy gift and worthily bestowed.

 District Court. The January term of the District Court at Winsted will not come in for the trial of any case till Monday, January 8, at p. m., when the court cases will be taken up and tried in the order of assignment. If jury is asked for, one will be summoned for the second week of the term.

 Judicious Advertising. MT. Geo. w. Hall of Falls Village, begins this New Year with half column advertisement MT. Hall has been very successful in his new mercantile enterprise in that village, and like other successful business men of tho world, recognize the value of judicious advertising. Wont you please read Mir. Halls Advertisement and see what he says about his closing out sale.

 Fire in West stookbridge. During the terrible storm of wind and snow last Fri day night, fire broke out in the business part of West Stockbridge, and before the flames could be stayed in their work of de- struction, two drug stores. two general merchandise stores and a dwelling were burned the drug stores belonged to James Moore and M. T. Crofut, and the other stores to w. H. Edwards and John Buck ley ; the dwelling house belonged to MT. Buckley; all were partially insured.

 Broke Through the Ice.-Just as Mir. Horace Barnum, of Wetaug was about to leave the Housatonic river on which he was cutting ice one day last week, the ice gave way with him precipitating his load of ice and horses down into the frigid waters of the Housatonic the harness was cut and every effort made to save the horses, and after the animals had houEdered about in the water for nearly two hourskhey were finally got out, but one of them was so thoroughly chilled he could not stand. At last accounts, the wagon and its burden of ice were in the river, but MT. B. will probably succeed in getting the wagon out some way or other.

 An Honest Success. Centennial church fair at Lakeville more than met the expectations of all. The ladies of the M. E. Church have made about $500 clear of all expenses. There was not even the shadow of lottery allowed at the fair ev- cry dollar was made in a perfectly legiti- mate way, all of which we are inclined to think would be difficult to say of many an- other church fair. Look at these figures |: $500 net and no lottery either If thls re- suit is an example of an honest and honor able effort, most people will conclude with us, that gambling don't pay as we'll as the straightforward way of doing things We congratulate the Rev. Oakley on his merited success.

 l Bad Accident.-La Saturday forenoon while the trains on the Housatonic road were struggling In the snow between Dew eys and Pittsfeld, Mir. Bartlett, the head Carpenter of the road, who was with the trains, started off ahead on foot to 20 to Pittsfeld to report progress by telegraph to headquarters ln Bridgeport, and while wal lowing in the snow ahead, he heard the trains coming (which were hitched all into one train) and on account of the violence of the wind, the atmosphere being full ol snow, he misjudged their distance from him, and they caught hlm before he could

 leave the track after he saw hls danger and threw him high in the air and off into , the snow. breaking one leg one arm and 6 collar bone, and brulsng him quite severe ly otherwise.

 The First Ceremonv.-The first mar riage ceremony that was ever soaAnnized Tn the new Catholic church (the St. Jo seph's) in this village twas on Monday fore. noon of last week, by the Key. Fathe, Lynch, of Lakeville. The parties mos, interested in this ceremony were Mir. J. E Tennier, of Pittsford, Vermont, and Miss Sedonie Kegler, of East Canaan. There was large audience present to witness the nuptials, and the presents were numerous and valuable. The father of the bride. Mir. Joseph Kegler, gave a dinner in the afternoon at hls residence, and fourteen couple of friends and citizens accompanied the bride and goom as far as Millerton on their visit to the home of the groom in Yer ] mont."

 A train on the Southern Pacific road broke in two on the grade near Water Sta. tion. The detached sections collided smashing number of freight cars and kill. ing Conductor Brown. No others were in- jured.

 A fire broke out in the City Hotel, at Norwalk, O., on the 7th, which, together with its contents, was totally destroyed many of the guests barely escaping with their lives. The fire also destroyed Wheaton Bros meat market, John Lees liquor store, J. M Hardness livery and sale stable and two saloons. The contents of all the buildings except the hotei were saved. Total loss $20,000; insurance very small.

 It is positively stated that none of the Renders are now living, and that old man Bender, his wife, son and daughter were captured by band of vigilants and lynched while trying to escape from Kansss.

y Apropos of q notice which recently appsare


in the Baltimore Mirror registering the retur,


to that city, of Rev. Father Mccoy, we wi
take the liberty of putting in type an aueodot
recently told us at the expense of Rev. Fathe
l Kenny, of our own city. The notice referred t
contains the following passages:


3 Rev. Father Peter Mccoy, pastor of tn
> Church of st.. Mary Star of the Sea, corne


johnson and Clements streets, after o thre
months soiourn in Europe for the benefit O.
his health, returned home on Christmas Eve.


a private telegram had been sen


to Rev. Father Devipe, the assistant pastor O.
the church, stating that Father Mccoy woult


reach this city atImidnight. The secret leske(


out, and when the train reached the station


Father Mccoy was surprised to find nearly q


dozen we'll filled carriages in waiting for him


The procession folio we'd him to his house
| where the warmest congratulations were ex
changed.


This reception, according to our information


was considerably different from one of which


Father Mccoy had been the victim while in


Ireland, on his recent trip, and with which Rev.


Father Thos. j. Kenny, pastor of st. John the


Bsptist's Church in this city, is not entirely
unconnected.


1t seems that Father Mccoy has q cousin in


Ireland, very aged and venerable gentleman,


who is the parish priest of little place called
Derrymacash. This aged clergyman-Dr. Nor
gan-has fallen into some of the infirmities of
health, with resulting oddities of opiniop)
which generally cloud or crown the latter days
of long life generously and faithfully spent
in the service of God and Man. Among other
peculiar notions, the venerable doctor has an
idea that American priests are not to be trusted
on revolutionary questions, and in consequence
OF these fears, he would not permit bis cousin,
father McCoy. to officiate in his church while
recently on visit to him at Derrymacash.


IL appears that Father Kenny, innocently on
his part, was the immediate occasion ofthis can.
tlous policy. While last in Ireland be was
treated with princely hospitality by Rev.
Father McKenna and his whole parish, being
detained among them long enough to witness
the admirable details of perfection to which the
parochial administration had been reduced by
that reverend gentleman, who is, indeed, well
known here in New Orleans. One item of his
organization was society embracing hun
dreds of men, in fact nearly all the male adults
Of the parish. 1t happened that Rev. Dr. Nor.
gan's parish of Derrymacash was adjoining,
and that Father Kenny, by arrangement, went
there one Sunday to cay Macs and oficiate
'oA '""0 HonoA0oio PaSterJ VINO was SICK IN bed. |
Father Kenny took the occasion to address a
few remarks to the flock, in which he spoke
with enthusiasm of Father McKenna's socisty
ot men, aud even volunteered, Dr. Morgan
being sick, to head the men of Derrymacash if
they would go over in body and participate
n some festival about to be celebrated by that
'ocety.


These remarks reached the Rev. Doctors
'ars through a channel which was more dis
'inguished for imagination and amplification |
hat for tame accuracy. He was thoroughly |
convinced that Father Kenny had volunteer
I'd to head his parish, with the largest
'hlllelah in his hand that could be found, in a |
oray upon the Orangemen of the County.


Now DR.. Morgan had doubtless read of Texas
n it's earlier days aud of our general Western
frontier, with their questionable doctrines of
Lynch law, bowie knife rule and revolver srbi-
ration. He didn't like all this and he didn't
hink his parish was the proper place to intro
luce it into Ireland, even in the modified !
orm it might receive while passing through
clerical ch annel.


Hence it was, that Father Mccoy, who was
heartily welcome as a cousin, got the cold
houlder as clergyman, and hence it is that
Father Kenny's name will go down to pos.
erity in Derrymacasb as that of ire eating.
ree-fghting, lawless, revolutionary American
priest."

A special from Logan, Ohio, reports
terrible excitement over the murder Of
John Weldon, his sister Mrs. Susan M.
Clurg, and her daughter, Miss Nancy
Hill. The murderers, VIM. Ferrell and
Joseph King have been arrested. 1t is
believed that FerreIl alone committed
the crime. He confes sed to participation
but claims that King killed all three with
an axe. King denies any knowledge of
the deed.


Two other persons have been arrested
on suspicion but it is not believed they
are guilty. At 10 O'Clock last night Il Q
town was wild with excitement groups
of men gathered and Ishortly afterwards
a crowd of over 500 men started on the
road to Logan to lynch the murders. AT
midnight the Mayor arranged to take
the pisoners TO Lancaster by special train
to save them from the mob. The engil
was then being fired up, and they ex-
pected to get away in half an hour, if the
prisoners could be safely removed from
the Jail and taken to the station."

Gentlemen Of the House of Representa-

profound and grateful acknowledgements In

20 me shall strive to be perfectly impartial,
a d should err in my decisions, as'l doubt
less shall, beg you to attribute it to the head
and not to the heart.


''We have Just completed a century of ex-
istence as an independent people, and for the
greater part Of that period have enjoyed, un-
der our matchless form Of government more
Of liberty and happiness thaR has been vouch-
safed 10 any other nation. But we are met at
the very threshold of the new century with
events brought about by few desperate and
faithless men which test to the utmost our
! form of government and our constitution
! The palladium of our liberties must be main
| tanned. Let us then, actuated by the same
patriotism which inspired our heroic fore
! fathers demand no concessions that are not
required by the constitution, and accept no
| settlement that il does not fully warrant.


Claiming your kind indulgence al all times
in the discharge Of my delicate duties, / am
ready to take the oath Of office""

REMOVAL OF THE NATIONAL OBsERvA-
ToRY.-It is said that tue annual report OF
The Secretary Of the Navy will contain a
Recommendation for the removal OF the Ob-
servatOry 10 point about four miles north
OF The city probably the site of Fort Stevens
on the ith street road. The question of the
removal OF the Observatory has been dis
cussed for some years. The present build
lngs, which were finished in 1871. have been
IOr some years ont OF repair. and 1t has been
necessary to make such large appropriations
year after year as would be su fficient TO erect
new building. The removal is also urgei
because of the locality, IL being just above
the decay ing vegetation along the shores OF
the Potomac, from which malaria Is always
rising. For years past the officers have been
compelled To work in this atmosphere. Some
years ago the proposition was 10 locate the
Observatory on Meridian Hill, but recently
the site of Fort Stevens is mentioned.

Well the House has taken some action this
matter The committee OF the House known the
Louisiana Committee, which has been referred TO by

That resolution was adopted by vote Of 165 to so.
This same committee, oi which Mr.. Wheeler and Mr.
Hoar wer0 members, were anxious, as all true men
ought to be- TO put end 10 the bad state Of things
which coniessedy prevailed then In Louisiana, IL

parties John McEnery, this contesting Governor
being 0ne), to make an award which was to be
carried out by certain changes by res2natons on the
side aud putting into ohce on tho other in the
Legislature OF that State. That award was made BY

that the tenure OF Office of William Pitt Kellogg during
the timc Tor which he had been elected and unt. his
successor should DO appointed should not IN any way
be nterered with by that Legislature Of the Stale
Louisiana IN consideration OF tins award.


THE ELECTION 1872.

them known the Lynch Board aud tho 0the

Louisiana has settled that question. The Supreme
Court, In the tweEty NTH annual reports, IN the
""The state ex REL Attorney General against Whar

1t is therefore ordered ard adndsed that the Board

A YOUNG WHITE GIRL RUNS AWAY
.-. WITH A NEGRO.",,".--.. WITH A NEGRO.


A st. Louis despatch states that case
of elopament has just transpired at
Abilene, Kan, which has created no
little amount of indignation among the
people of that section. Jennie Bolton, a
pretty girl of fifteen, daughter cf a farmer
living near Abilene, disappeared a few
days ago, and shortly after wards it was
discovered that she had run away in
company with a notorious mulatto, about
forty years of age, who, has lived for
some time at Abilene. As soon as the
fact became known considerable excite
ment prevailed among the citizens,
which was more augmented by the Cir
cumstances that the child is so childish
and young as to be scarcely responsible
for her actions. The citizens immedia-
tely raised large sum of money as re-
ward, and for paying the expense OF pnr-
suing the scoundrel and his victim. Mar
shall Horsington, of Abilene, took up the
trail, and follow wing it with great rapidi-
ty came upon tine flying couple at
Salina, captured them, and at once took
them aboard of train bound for Abb
lene. When the tram arrived the father
of the girl was at the depot and attemp-
ted to Shoot the abductor of his daugh-
ter, but was prevented by Sheriff
Nicolay. 1t was with the greatest diff
Guilty that the citizens could be restrain
ed from lynching the man. The girl
was restored to her father and the alb
ductor put in Jail. and he will undoub-
tedly get speedy justice from the courts."

In the development of our natural wealth.


II continues: rs it not overwhelmingly
disgraceful that in Franklin County, where
the capital Of the State is located, there
should be sucn thing as 'Ku-KluX DEM
onstration' only a few days ago? Is it not
diSgrsceful that in Madison County, with
It's refined and intelligent community OF
Richmond, there should have occurred half n
dozen murders within few months? The
people Of Richmond deplore the deeds but
h it not their duty to see that they shall he
1e~ and far between In the future?


There is another subject intimately re.
hted to this. We refer to the prevalent
habit of carrying deadly and concealed
Weapons. Even man who never drinks
b apt to use his weapon with fatal effect il
his anger is awakened during a personal
quarrel, but by far the larger portion OF
secretly armed Kentuckians are in the habit
q drinking. The intoxicated man, armed
with six-shooter, is liable to shoot per.
feet stranger to him as well rs known foe
The habitual wearing of pistols is therefor,
. constant menace to the public. 1t is no
. condition Of the higher civilization. 1t !,
. relic Of an era Of savagery. 1t is no
brave; it is cowardly, unmanly-a habit o.
bullies.

damning evil and crush forever the widely
extended charge that Kentucky is the mos

THEY WE'RE BRIBED TO VOTE FOR HIM.


COLUMBIA, S. o., Nov. 28.-The special
investigating committee appointed last
spring to examine, among other things,
into the election of John j. Patterson as
United States Senator in 1879, submitted
a report to the Legislature this morning.
The report gives an epitome of testi-
mony taken by the committee, including
that of forty ex-members of the Legisla-
ture, white and colored Republicans,
who concur in the statement that Patter-
sons election was secured through bribe-
ry. About twenty testified that they were
bribed either personally by Patterson or
his agent. Worthington, receiving
amounts ranging from 800 to $4,000.
About twenty more testified that offers
| of bribes were made to them and refused.
Mr.. Elliott (colored), ex-member OF Con
gress, who was Patterson's most formld-
able opponent, was offered 5000 to
withdraw from the contest, which he re-
| fused. The offer was made by j. B. Den
mis-, IN the name of Patterson. Major
NJ artin r. Delaney (colored) was present
and corroborated Elhott's statement
Gov. Moses afterward appointed j. B.
Dennis Jury Commissioner to draw jur-
les tor the protection of Patterson when
he was indicted in 1873 for procuring his


election by bribery. and the arrangement


was successfully completed. Every Wit
ness testified that it was generally known
and understood among the members that


Patterson was purchasing his election.
The evidence also shows that votes


were bought while the election was in
progress. Max well, colored Senator, was
paid to change his vote in favor of Pat
| terson, which gave him majority in the
Senate, and avoided the necessity of a
joint assembly on the next day.


THE lynching of the negro McGhee at
Columbia for an attempted crime which
| is only too common among his race In
the South, had some novel features. The
act was not sudden or unpremeditated,
nor committed by few men. The peo-
pie of the entire town and neighboring
country came together. There was
mass meeting, at which some twenty-five
hundred men were present, and speeches
were made by whites and blacks. After
fully debating the question, as calmly, if
we may believe the newspaper reports, as
the people of Massachusetts township


would their annual tax-rate, the meeting
came to the unanimous conclusion that


McGhee was guilty and that he should


be hanged and forthwith. And he was


hanged without any longer delay than
five minutes spent in securing rope of


the necessary length and thickness. This


is one of the uses and blessings Of the


township system which even de Tocque-
vile failed to detect."

Placer county is passing through period
of excitement against the Chinese that
bodies i'll for that people and will doubtless
result in their expulsion from the Western
part Of that county. A man named Sar-
gent had some dealing with Chinese,
selling them some old mining claims.
For one OF these Claims he received $40.
The money was taken home and put into
trunk. AT the time OF this transaction
German named oder with his wife, were
stopping at Sargcnt's house. On the 10Th
inst, the bodies OF oder and his vile were
found, bearing every evidence Of the
couple having been brutally murdered. .
Further search resulted in finding Mr..
Sargent in another place, feariully man
gled. but alive and conscious. From him
it was learned that he had been attacked
by two Chinamen and left for dead. Fur
ther search showed that this triple muir
der had taken place in furthersnce of rob
berry, the trunk being found broken open
and the $40 gone. The officers at once
took the track Of the supposed assassins
and arrested them at Chinese cabin
near the scene Of the tragedy. An ex-
animation before a magistrate resulted in
holding three Of the number to answer on
n charge of murder. and it is believed
thore are yet Others implicated. As each
successive circumstance came to light the
excitement increased, and as the Sheriff
started with his prisoners to the county
seat, determined effort was made by the
crowd to get the prisoners for the purpose
Of lynching them. In this they were un-
successful, the officers getting safely
away on the tram. The citizens then
commenced notifying the Chinese t. leave
that part Of the country and they were
not slow in obeyng the order. AT Rock
lin, Penryn and Ro>evil,o the Chinese at
I once packed up and started for Sacramcn-


to, ard at the first named place their
/ quarter Gf the town was torn down, and
accidentally burned up.


1t is to be regretted that violence should


be offered to any but the guilty ones in
this matter. If they can be found out,
their punishment is certain. But the
| fendish murder shows to what ends Chi
namcn will go, Notwithstanding their ap-
parent submissivencss. Like all half
civilized or barbarous people they hold
/ human life and human suffering very
| lightly. Even amorg themselves, they
seem to care but little for the comfort of
Of the sick, if they happen to be destitute.
Instances in which the old and the inirm
are turned out OF doors to die are of fire..
quent note 1t is only because they are
restrained by fear that prevents them
! from the commission of more crimes.
This triple murder may open the eyes of
acing the country. Mob law is to be re-
! GREETED at all times, the punishment OF
crime should be left to the authorities. -
| Bat an excited crowd does not stop to
| reason, but wreaks its vengeance Er,t and
| talks it over afterwards. 1t is to be bop


ed that all the parties to this bloody trag-
edy, will be found and made to suffer the
| penalty Of their great or ime. But ven
geance Of the right Kind viii not be had
by an indiscriminate onslaught on limo
cent aud guilty."

-Revivcation of the long liteless
and imperative broom-manutactory, is
one of the happy announcements we
are privileged to make. Our young
friends, Harry Pernot and Bill. Williams,
have purchased the broom-lnachincry of
F. r. McKibben, and, very soon, will
commence to manufacture these necessa-
ry domestic articles. They propose to
sell them as cheap as they can be pur-
chased in St. Louis, treights included,
promising that they shall be, in every
respect, equal to those brought from
that place. Now, here is an opportuni-
ty for our people to show whether they
are really disposed to sustain our home
manufactures or not. Here are two of
our own young men, who are going in
to business for themselves. DESTROYS of
making an honest livelihood, and doing
their work cheap, we believe it to be the
duty Of all our merchants to encourage
these young men in their commendable
determination, by buying their brooms
of them, and thereby enabling them to
build up a successful and prosperous bu-
sincss. When our young will try to do
for themselves, the older ones should
extend them all the assistance that they
can. Here is our earnest wish, boys, for
your success.


Cotton pckers have been disconso-
, late, because of the bad weather.


Near the railroad crossing back OF
Main street, in wet weather you can al
most swim.


say~ We visited the popular house of
F. r. MCKibben, to take a glance at his
immense stock of goods and we can as
f sure our friends that they can buy more
goods for less money there than at any
house in the county. tt
The roads have been so bad during
the past week that but little wheat has
been brought to market.


Saint Mary's street, during rainy
l weather, is almost unnavlgablc. The
: portion near Mr. Daugherty's residence is
at such times young river.


There is a probability that the cot,
ton crop may be considerably injured by
the wet weather. The delay in picking,
. also somewhat intcrlercs with the bu-
siness of the several gins.

HOuse.-The House took up the Electoral Tribunal
bill, and Mr.. McCrary, of Iowa, member of the
Joint committee, opened the debate. He said the
country was in the presence Of very great
and very dangerous emergency. The present was
republic had foreseen in 1890, aud which at
various periods in the nations history great
had foreseen and had dreaded. The
country confronted, not only with great and
widespread difference Of opinion on the
merits Of the question. but il confronted
With what was thousand-fold more perious, with
the fact that the American people. American states
men, American lawyers and jurists almost |
equally divided, not only as to the merits Of the
question: but as to authorities to be cited. He
mtted that that statesman was faise to his duty; |
that that did not come up TO the exigencies of
the sson, who would stop short in the most earn
est endeavors to provide some lawful mode for the
decision of this question by tribunal whose au- /
thority nobody could question, anc in whose deci-
sion all men would acquiesce Mr.. Hunton, of vir- |
ginia also Der OF the committee advocated the
measure. He held that just the tellers provided
for in the twenty-secend joint rule were but the |
organs of the two houses, so the commission pro-
vided for in the bill but their organ to do for |
them what they themselves migkt do. He also |
held that the two houses had the right to count
the votes, they had the right of concurrent |
seem best TO them. Mr.. Hoar spoke In favor |
of the bill. Nothing, he teid. could be |
more injurious to the republic than that man |
should be putin the Presidential office whom at /
least one-hslf of the American people would regard
as usurper. He could not conceive that the |
trainers Of the constitution ever thought of yieldr


TO the President of the Senate the vast power of
counting the electoral votes. That power was in |
the two houses Of Congress just the English |
affecting the succession to the crown In conclusion
Mr. Hoar said: The act which we are about to |
40 will in my judgment be one OF the very brav.st
in human history. Our annals have been crowded \
with great achievements in war, in peace, in arts
In literature, In commerce but other countries |
have equaled us in tho-e particulars, but in this
great act we stand without a rival and without |
an example. For n thousand years our children, |
with tears Of JOY and pride, viii read that while
in fierce strife for executive power the sun of other
republics after short but brilliant day
blood, in their country, too, the same great |
strife has arisen that their sky has been darkened
by the cloud that their ship, with its costly
freight of love ana hope. encountered the same |
storm, and was driven near the same r'cks, but |
that. In the midst of.the storm and darkness and
conflict, the august and awful figure Of the law
the face of the waters uttering its divine
controlling mandate, Peace, be stnl.'""
Mr.. Hale, Of Maine, spoke in opposition to
the bill. He said the startled
him by the bold assumption of the power of Con-
gress TO regulate and control the election Of Pres
dent, which power, in his judgment, had never
been lodged in the two houses by the trainers OF
constitution. whatever the popular impulse might
be now, this bill would not be sustained by the
American people when they should have time TO
strnck q bow at the Electoral College, which
stood as high in the constitution as
the Presidency itself. and shattered it
for IL the power of Congress, which might at any
time thsart the VIII of the people and render nu-
gatory its deliberate aud expressed jp igment.

necIions are made with regularity and
the eating.houses are good. The sleep
ing coaches on this line have no upper
berths, and as to comfort they are far
preferable to the Pullman cars. A
person leaving Vicksburg on Tuesday
st o'clock PM, will reach here FRI
day morning in time for early break.

vile where you stop eight hours. But
this delay is not irksome, as you can
stop at q good hotel near the depot, and
the rest thus afforded, is quite refresh.

which have seen since coming here,
l am led to suppose that these precious

general. The rule is TO play one round
dance and then square dance, and
this order is always observed, so that
everyone may have an opportunity TO
enjoy themselves.


The table is reasonably good, and
the accommodations are as good as you
can find al most watering places.

that section of the State we learn that
one Of men who was executed was q
murderer, and that the other one was q
highwaymaD, who did not hesitate to
take human life when It was necessary
to secure the money and valuables Of
bis victim. There is no doubt from
this information, and we feel certain
that il Is reliable, that both these men
deserved 10 be put to death. But
the same informant says that the
Courts in that county are perfectly
competent and willing TO execute the
Jaws, and he has little doubt that
Moore and Shelton would have suffer-
ed for their crimes by the due process
Of law, If they had not been lynched.
This makes all those who were engaged
in this lynching very blameable. They
have violated the laws aud corrupted
society for no good purpose, and they
have added crime 10 their names
when there was not even decent
excuse."

VIRGINIA CRY, (Nev.) May 2-Great ex-
element prevails here to-day over the pros
pect of labor riot. J. D. Bardwell, the
man who organized cooperative mill and
mining company to practically reduce miners
wages to three dollars per day by securing
them employment and taking their notes for
800, payable in installments of one dollar
per day, was notified by the miners union
that he must desist, and on the written notice
were the words, ""a word to the wise is suf-
ficient.'' He was stopped by crowd o. men
in front of the post office at II a. m. to-day,
and asked to explain his conduct, when he
ran through tinshop and fled down the
canyon, followed by several hundred men.
Lynching and shooting were freely talked Of
A party are still on his track and it is believed
he will never return alive. The miners hint
ominously of labor riot. The iron moulders
are on strike, and will parade the streets to
night with band."

If there is any murderers trade union or
other organization for the protection of the
rights and interests Of murderers as class
that body should take into serious consider
alton the propriety and policy of putting
dampers or brakes or some equivalent
moderating apparatus upon the zeal of ad-
yocates in murder trials. It can be demon
strated, and almost without difficulty, that
the excessive zeal Of advocates, and par
ticularly their overworking Of certain lines
OF defence, is proving, and must continue to
prove, great prejudice to the dignity, If
not to the safety, of the ancient and honor
able fraternity of the Sons Of Cain. 1t may
be shown that advocates are likely to i'm
peril the standing and possible exist
ence Of the craft in civilized countries-and
for what? For trivial gain-for the mere
acauittal of worthless brother here and
there, who has been clumsy enough to be
found out Society seems to have no really
solid objection to the existence Of the fra
ternity Of murderers, provided that side by
side with the institution Of murder it can
recognize as existing and effective the in
stitution Of the guillotine or the gallows
aud some judicial formalities which present
at least u gambling chance that the act of
murder shall put in peril the life of the man
who commits it. Precisely, therefore, as the
extravaganza of advocates tends to reduce
the gallows to fiction and the trial to o
farce, society tends to the withdrawal Of its
quasi consent to the very existence of the
institution of murder and to the ex-
preston of its purpose in this re-
gard by violent means. We may ""clothe
our care with circumstances. Every
one has read with shudder how some
people in Illinois treated few days since the
harmless and gentle youth-a rising orna-
ment of the fraternity--who murdered o
certain person named Goetz, and rounded"

Mr.. Chandler offered an ameudmen
making the appropriation $4,000, 9TH
amount asked for by the Board of Eda-
cation.)


Pending tie vote upon the amendment
quite lengthy debate took place.


Col. Febiger stated that he Was of th(
opinion that if the Board had asked In
time for s76,OOO, the Council would bt
compelled to appropriate that amount,
but as they had neglected to comply with
the city charter, the Council had the right
to fix the amount, and he should vote
against the amendment.


Mr.. johnson thought that the neglect on
the part of the Board, should not be taken
advantage of by the City Council.


Mr.. Chandler read from the city charter,
and said he could see nothing therein which
had not been complied with by the
Board of Education, and expressed himself
strongly in favor Of education, and said
that the education of the masses was the
main support of free government like
ours.


Mr.. McGlinchey thought % far as our
Government was concerned, the more
education we received the worse We became.


Mr.. Lynch said that he had been In favor
of granting the Board last year the amount
they asked for, and had trusted that during
the year they would have found some way
by which they could retrench, and said he
would vote against the amendment.


Mr.. Pickels said he was In favor OF
education, but the public schools were not
conducted as they should be, as 1t was not
the original intention of the founders OF
public education that the classics should
be taught IN them, and did not think 1t
right and proper for thee fourths of the
community to be taxed, for the education of q
one fourth part who we're able to attend

Ray rolls were read and passed as fol-
lows Street Department, S265 80; Water
Department, $262.42 total, $517.92.


Petitions and communications were
read and referred, as follows:


From Ii. j. Garrett and others. for
water pipes and fire-plugs on B street, |
from New Castle Avenue to Locust street, |
South-side.


From James Bradford and others. for a
sewer down West street, from Delaware
Avenue to Fifth street.


From John Green, for the having of
cutters on the east side of Poplar street,
from Taylor to Ninth.


From j. p. Herdman and others re-
monstrating against the paving of Ninth
street, from Washington to Monroe.


Inc ordinance recognizing the Fire
Department came up, as unfinished busi-
ness, the question being on the adoption
OF Section s, which was read and adopt-
ed.


When section 10 was read, Mr.. Baker
objected to the clause requiring the out
lets of all fire-plugs TO be made uniform
in size; he also moved to amend the
clause requiring each company to keep
on hand 1000 feet Of hose by making the
amount 600feet.


Mr.. McGlinchey objected to the amend
ment, and said that 1000 feet was not too
much,


Mr.. Baker said that the companies had
no practical use for more than 600 feet,
and the balance would only lay in the
houses and rot.


The amendment was lost, and the sec
tion was adopted as read.


On the reading of section II, which
places the appropriation to each company
at $25OO per year, Mr.. Baker asked the
reason for this increase.


Mr.. Adams replied that the previous
appropriation of $1,000 was insufficient,
and the increase was actually necessary.
Mr.. StOtsenburg thought the increase
was judicious, and would keep the fire
men from calling upon the citizens for
contributions for the support of the COM
panies.


Mr.. Baker opposed the increase, and
could zee no reason for it, beyond the
fact that 1t was asked for by the firemen
| Mr.. johnson, the increase was actually
necessary to bear the legitimate expenses
of the companies.


l
and declared himself in favor of a paid
fire department, which he said could be
run for $40 600 per annum. He thought
the companies should be required TO pre-
sent their amounts each year to Council,
so that the city could know how the ap-
propriations were spent, and where an
Increase was rendered necessary.


Mr.. Stotsenburg also favored a paid
fire department, and thought one should
have been instituted ten years ago.


The sooner paid department was es-
tablished, he said, the better it would be
for all concerned. Still while we had the
present department it should be sustain
ed, and he favored giving the companies
, the desired appropriation.


After some further discussion section
,, IL as read was adopted, Mr.. Baker alone
voting in the negative.


The ordinance was then passed by IL
ayes to nay, Mr.. Baker, who said he
would have voted for the ordinance had
satisfactory reason been given Tor ae tne
increase of the appropriations to $25OC
per annum.


Mr.. Adams moved that 800 copies OF
the ordinance be printed with the report
of the Chief Engineer of the Fire De-
partment, Laid over until next meeting

THE KILLING oP COLLINS.

guilty OF participation in the crime, and as
To the consequences of The production OF
proof of his innOsence. While on the train

did say, as follows:

In the same paper, the editor Of the

drunken rowdy than tue secretary OF a republican
convention ""You remember, gentlemen"" con-
tinued the report ''that he SAID he did not
let the grass grow under his feet ior the
last forty eight hours"" He meant by this
mark that he had been to Rockaway to consult
with tue devoIt, meek and Shiny Leake and the
balance OF the colerie OF his companions In crime.
The result OF the coming together OF these master
minds by the sad waves was an order from the
chief mourner iLcakc) telling Hallock TO procure the
key OF the room that Brady had already hired; but
they fooled as they thought to fool us as Brady
had the foresight TO procure another in the vicinity.

RAPE, ROBBERIES AND NJ MURDERS


A few days ago Mrs. RAIDER was killed
by robbers in Montgomery county, near
this city. A little later NJ rs. o ARA, near
Manayunk, was brutally outraged by a
number of brutes in human form. On
M onday night man was murdered in a
row in the Sixth Ward of this city. On
Tuesday afternoon, while Paying ster
Blssell and his assistant, Captain Carling,
of the Delaware, Lackawanna and West
ern railroad, were going in q buggy with
81. 900 to pay the miners in the Brisbin
colliery, in the outskirts of Scranton, they
were attacked by two masked robbers q
short distance from the mine. The rob-
bers drew revOlvers and fired, slightly
wounding Captain Carling. Mr.. Bisseil
returned the fire, and the robbers fed to
the woods. On Friday morning of last
week four masked burglars armed, of
course, with revolvers, broke into the
house of MIR. Lew w. Pennock, near
West Grove, in Chester county and tied
him, his wife and a man named Carver
hand and foot, and then ransacked and
robbed the house of large amount of
money. On Tuesday night terrible
tragedy was enactedsnear Fairview, in
York county, in which two men were
killed. On Tuesday, in the afternoon,
masked men robbed the dwelling of
George Thompson, in Bea, er valley, and
killed his hired man, named Thomas
Barns. These are but the cases of rob.
berry and murder in this state that come
under our mental view at this moment.
Tomorrow may show as many more
Some of the above crimes were perpe-
trated in broad daylight, in utter con-
tempt. and defiance of the law and Its
Robbers and murders in this
state seem to have concluded that they
have nothing to fear from the law. No
doubt they reason that if they should be
arrested, tried and convicted they would
be set free by the board of pardons; and
with this hope in their minds they con-
clude to rob and kill at pleasure. In
some of the counties vigilance commit
mittees have been formed, and lynching
will become necessary if the proper au-
thorlties remain so lax and inefficient
for the punishment and prevention of
crime. The people will be compelled to
take the law into their own hands. 1t
has become question of life and death,
and self.preservation is the first law of
nature. If the courts and the board of
pardons will not protect the people, the
people must protect themselves. And
a few summary hangings by the outrag-
popalace in different parts of Pennsylva-
mia, lawless though the proceeding
would be, would have wholesome ef-
feet, A short shrift and long rope
would be only just such criminals as
those who committed the robberies,
rape and murders above mentioned, and
we could not blame the people if these
scoundrels should be strung up accord
ing TO the code of Judge Lynch."

ment the policy it had to follow to crush
the national aspirations of the mobiles by
raising the economical cordition of the
peasantry aud rendering it independent OF
its former masters in short, to rut into
practice the old maxim, OiCtde ct amper0
Accordingly, duripg the last insurrection
the peasants proved to be the most eff
cient allies of the Government troops.
AIm1 were given W tbcuA auU thCy hoo ~
entrsp and catch smsll bands of insurgeDts
dispersed in the woods. So great was their
zeal in accomplishing this duty that fre-
qaently soldiers had to be sent to prevent
their lynchiug the prisoners. After the in
surrection, DEGREES were issued by the Rus
sian Government giving the peasants in
Poland and in the western provinces ex-
ceptional rights aud privileges which
greatly exceed those awarded to the Rus
sian peasantry by the Emancipation law.
AS most of the land properties belonging
to Polish mobiles who had taken part in the
insurrection were confiscated by the Gov
erument, the lands were sold by lots to the
surrounding village communes at such low
prices aud with such facilities in the pay
ment thereof that the sale was in most
cases equal to q donation. A complete
self government by elected elders and
judges was awarded to the communes,
with far less admin istratiy control than in
Russia. Primary schools were opened by
the Government in SO great number that
the expense for entertaining them in these
provinces alone is equal to the cum e1-
pended by the state for the came purpose
| in all the other parts of Russia. All these
measures have entirely changed the char


actor of the brutaliEed, enslaved popula-
| ton, aud have naturally rendered it more
hostile than ever to the Polish national


cause, represented by the mobiles whom it
| bitterly hates.


| Thus, however great the admiration may
| be which is elected by the heroic and fan


atical attachment of the Polish nobility to
| it's country aud it's past traditions, one tact
nevertheless, cannot be concealed-that the

national one, the mass of the nation being
hostile or Indifferent to it.

 MUEsTER's SUICIDE.

 A few weeks ago your correspondent, telegraphed the Times an account of the marriage of Munster, member of the British house of commons, to the daugh' ter of Df. Henry c. Lynch, of this city MT. and Mrs. Munster travelled until within the past two weeks, when they returned to the city, and have been stop. ping at the Southern, occupying rooms there when the alarm of fire was given. Both escaped from the building, but in the confusion became separated. Mrs. Munster was taken to her fathers home, and her husband went to the room of a friend, and slept there. At late hour this morning he suddenly sprang out of bed, exclaiming that his wife was at the hotel. Before he could be stopped he had snatched up pistol and fired, shoot ing himselfthrough the right temple and falling dead. His funeral will take place on Friday. The coroner's jury tonight decided that the unfortunate man was crazed.

 MISS KATE CLAxToN's MIRACULOUS Es-

 CAPE.

 Kate Claxton, the actress, whose mi raculous escape from the theaters in Brooklyn and Washington will be re- gave the Times correspondent the following account of her experience in the burning hotel. Miss Claxton says: Il left the Olympic theater i'm mediately after the performance, and re- turned with my brother to the hotel. We went into the dining room to take a late supper, and there we found Miss Osborn and Miss Mcclellan. Miss Mc- Clellan was so bright and cheerful, and l was 30 charmed with her sweet face and manners, little imagining what was so soon to follow. Alter bidding them good night went up to my room on the fourth floor, and my brother retired to his room on the same floor. sat down and read little before going to bed, and everything at the time was quiet. Tho next thing that I remember was a loud knocking at the door. was undressed, and had been sleeping some time. In a half stupid condition I turned and list ened. listened again, and the knock ing was repeated, With the knocking, tAc sounds of which were far and near, came the dreadful shouts of Fire! Firep I sprang from the bed, and a terrible feeling of oppression came over me. I cannot describe it. I looked up at the gas in my room, which was burning dim ly, and there saw smoke curling aroand the chandelier. Then it appeared all at once to fill the room, and dense clouds came through the aperture ofthe fire grate. 1 thought instantly of my brother. and rushed out, undressed as I was, to dis cover his room. Meanwhile he had been by the noise, and was approch- ing my room. I said: Let us find the stairs, or we shall be lost. My brother was then half dressed, and reached across the bed to pick up something to throw over me. We could not find the and the confusion and the smoke and roar of the fire were mingled with the most piercing and heartrending screams. I shall never forget it. We were not acquainted with the hotel ar engagements, for the common practice is to use the elevator in ascent and descent, and therefore could not find staircase or any means of escape. There were others on the same floor in the same terrible dilemma, but could not see each other for the smoke. We groped along and presently found step downward, and commenced to descend. What hap pened I cannot say, for do not distincly I have been in greater dan ger, az you know, and l always endeavor to maintain my composure, but the smoke last night stifed the senses. We reached by some means or other the first landing of the ladies' staircase on the Fifth street side, opposite the Olympic theater. There was a great crowd of ladies in their nightdresses in ths vesti. bule, and some of the physicians were persuading them that all would be safe. We did not heed this advise, and passed out on the street. A way was made through the crowd for us to reach the hotel opposite, and,I remained there some little time to recover myself. There 1 saw poor Miss Mcclellan brought in. l can never forget it.

 MIR. AND MRS. GERLICH.

 Herman Gerlich, the new German consul here, and his wife, jumped out of third. story window on to the east porch, and both sustained serious iniu ries, MT. Gerlich breaking his left leg and Mrs. Gerlich injuring her spine. MT. Gerlich succeeded Robert Rart to the consulship here, and received his appoint. ment from Bismarck some two weeks ago.

 MIR. AUsTIN's ESCAPE.

 Mir. Austin, one of the hotel clerks also had very narrow escape. He was sound asleep in the sixth story of the building when the alarm was turned on, and when awakened by the shrieks oi the women in the railways and adjoin ing rooms nearly every avenue of escape was cut off. Fortunately for MT. Aus tin, he knew the railways and stairways of the hotel almost as well in the dark and smoke as under the m st favorable circumstances, and it was this that en. abled him to crawl along the floor and slide down the banisters to the second story. Before leaving his room he had the precaution to tie wet towel about"

most atrocious crimes ever perpetrav
in Ohio, was the murder in this county
near the village of Gore, about seyaE
miles from Logan, of Mr.John Weldon,


his widowed sister, Mrs. Susan Ne
CLrc and Miss Nancy Hite, daughtaf
Of Mrs. Nancy McClurg by formq


husband. The murderers are now IN !
iaiI One of them, VIM. Terrell, madeg
y confession to-day which throws thei
crime ON one Joseph King. King denies


any knowledge of the crime. The prel
yailing opinion is that Terrell did mOsv
Of the horrible work. The murdereiu
man was a thrifty farmer, and it was


generally supposed he had money in ha,
house. Terrell says they met him about
a half mile from the house, and that
King. without any warning, walked uE


and deliberately y y


SHOT HIM IN THE BOWELS. h
Then ensued tussle, during which,
KING shot him in the breast once an(


twice in the neck. The victim picket,
nm an old corn-cutter and threw it a.
Kinr and struck him in the back. Kin.a
seized the corn-cutter and struck th,,,
old man over the head, cleaving th'
skull, and then finished his work with !,
club. They then went to Sma
stream. washed their hands, and the !
went TO the house. King took an al,
from the norch. went into the house,
and presently came out with the Oh !
lady. They walked together momer
when, without warning, he

the neck, severing the jugular vein. Ha !
then ran into the house, and the yom' |,
lady, seeing the CORY and blood-Gp'
smeared weapon, ran out of the trOI :
door. The brute pursued and oyertOo 7,
her before she had taken many stepl
and dealt her blow upon the ShOuldee
sinking the AK to the handle. Tha
brought her to the ground, and he Strucs Y
her on the back of the head, splitting
wide open. He again lifted his weapo
and struck her across the neck, almOu
severing her head from the body. u
