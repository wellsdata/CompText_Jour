Dr. Shortlidge, who believed that the right

PeonIe who live in old and well protected
communities can hardly understand such a
state of affairs as that which exists in Pope
County, Arkansas The recital OF facts, 1ur-
nisbed by correspondent of The TRIBUNE,
and published to-day, is calculated to SUR the
indignation of every honest man. Here we
have a county practically in a state OF siege,
in consequence of determination OF the local
government to find pretext for the deciara-
ton of martial law The modified Force bill,
which was whipped through Congress at the
close of the last session. is not sufficiently severe
in its provisions for the eXacting demands OF
the Military Ring; and Senator Clayton, who
is foremost in every unscrupulous scheme for
the benefit of the Administration, is undoubt-
edly the inSpirer of this new plan to coerce
the citizens Of Arkansas into the support OF
the waning cause which he advocates. hadley,
the acting Governor, came into power through
the success of the corrupt bargain which sent
CLAYTON to the Senate, thereby vacating the
gubernatorial chair. He is therefore the will
ling coadiutor and tool of Clayton; and the
narrative of the events to which We refer
shows him constantly applying to Clayton for
orders and advice as the dismal tragedy OF
Pope County wears on to a catastrophe.


1t became evident some time ago that Ar
kansas was lost to the denomination party,
unless desperate means were adopted to Sc
cure some unusual power in the State Inc
old cry of ""Ku-Klux"" was tried, but the people
did not respond, for nowhere were there any
traces of the once-dread Klan. Determined,
however not to be turned aside from their
plans, the Clayton Ring went into Pope
County, where the settlements are far apart,
and where Lynch law was once ready re-
sort of the inhabitants, and there be-
gan a series of artful movements, de-
signed to create the impression that that
locality was infested with the Ku-Klux. The
evidence on which depends the whole subse-
duent chain of violent events Is so slight as 10
be mere absurdty. A deputy sheriff SAID that
he had been shot at bya man i'll ambush he was
not wounded, and he never pretended that ne
saw any one yet he was sure that the shooter
was a Ku-Klux His only witness, who first
swore roundly that the deputy was thus shot
at. subsequently confessed that the deputy
really fired the shot himself. From this
trivial occurrence, this transparent sham,
came all the train of persecution which
has resulted in the murder of several lnno-
cent citizens the establishment of a reign OF
terror in two peaceful counties of Arkansas,
and n mockery of Justice which is a disgrace
TO the American name. OF the wicked con-
spiracy by which a sheriff7s posse massacred
their captives under pretense OF an attempt
at rescue, we do not now speak. The tulml-
nation of acting Governor Hadley, which we
nublsh with Che story of the troubles in Pope
County. libelous and distorted as it is, bears
on its face irrefragable evidence of the base
ness of the whole scheme. Some allowance
must be made for the free-and-easy ways
of a South Western court OF JUS
tice: but the manner IN which the
nlainest requirements of law and equity were
trampled upon that the murderOus sheriff and
his gang might escape from the hand of the
law can scarcely fail to attract indignant at
tention. And even this pliable Judge May,
when writing of the events in Pope County,
| ignorant of the Misrepresentation made by
| Gov. Hadey, is forced to admit the iniquity
of the proceedings of the sheriff and his gang
| of ruf1ians.


AT last accounts, the cOnspirat0rs hesltated
| tn have martial law extended over the locality
| where they have determined to fix the exist
ence of Ku-Klux. The plot has evidently
been a failure. But the State Militia, sort
| of Arkansas type of Kirke's Lambs"" of the
olden times, have been sent into that region
and, if they are sustained there for any length
of time, they will undoubtedly create enough
disturbance to warrant Mr.. Hadley in putting
| Pope and Yell Counties under martial law fol

THE VERDICT OF THE JURY.


The jury retired at about five O'Clock p. M, ana
In half an hour, after consultation with the
State Attorney, brought In the following verdict -


THAT Luigi Lusignsni, OF the city and State Of
New York, did, on the 7th day OF November, In the
year 1872 at Dover, In the county OF Morris, will
iully and felonously kill and murder the said
Johanna MOssin


Boriotti's condition was much improved at seven
O'Clock tonight. The townspeople are much
reporter from New York, who visited Boriottt
and having nothing else to make long story from
last night interviewed him to the point OF death.
Boriotti's physician threatened him with whipping
and the people express an anxiety to lynch him."

or your fellow passengers feel inclined they will
amuse You with hundred recitatOns OF


BLOODY c0NNEMORATIoNs.


You win hear OF John A. Murren's band OF Cullen
Bakers midnight assassinations, of Dodson's guer
lila robberes and the bloody massacre OF prisoners
at Shiloh Church of Hickox shot from his saddle and
OF General Upham's dire in1icti0ns upon the people
OF Woodruff, Crittenden and Mississippi counties.
One old chap by the name OF TObey. who is postmas
ter miller and merchant at NOrristown brought the
hair up on my head by relating the first and also
the latest crime committed at his hamlet. He said
that he remembered seeing, when a boy the bloody
clawmarks of murdered gambler named John Hill,
alias Nixon Kerr, who, having killed his score Of
men, finally felt the agony of the murdered himself
In the year 1910.


HE tried to climb up that counter and draw his
knife said Nj. Tobey, ""but he couldn't do 1t, and
the prints Of his hands were there for years. The
man that stabbed him went of TO Texas and be-
came Baptist preacher""


The last crime happened but few weeks or
months ago. near Norristown, when two negroes
named Riall and Archie Embury killed. respect
lively, man by the name Of Champion and an
other white fellow named Tucker. Archie Embury
killed Champion in quarrel about cotton picking,
and soon afterward Archle's brother was MUIR
dered Tucker. the ferryman at Valley Rock, sought
to raise up the dead body, when the bereaved
negro father rushed cut with stick OF wood and
beat out fuckers brains.


""A happy society You have there, Mr.. Tobey,""
said /; ""do they ever hang anybody""


mot In these days. They wouldn't let Old Colo
mel Embury, who used to own these niggers, tes.
tify because he was disffanchised, and Archie EN-
bury rode Hlckoxs horse all over the county after
HickOx's death. He's in the mtia.n


Indeed, the history of Arkansas Is history OF
murder, family vendetta lynchings and duels.


II well remember"" said an Old man OF Galley
Rock, ''seeing the loaded steamboats, go by to Fort
Smith, where the big politicians and planters re-
paired to fight across the line in the Indian Terri
tory. The last, 1t seems to me, was Albert Pike
and John f. ROane-the latter General Yell's lieu
tenant colonel. Pike had company in the regl-
ment In the Mexican war; they quarreled, and,
after they came home, fought About three tho u
sand people saw the fight Bob Johnson, now Pike g
partner at Washington, seconded Roane, an: Ma
than Chase seconded Pike. After the second fire,
when Pike had lost lock Of his hair by ball, old
DR.. Burton, a flre-eater, pitched in and sad-If
there's any firing III do little shooting my
selfn He stopped 1t, amid general disappont-
ment.""


In this way you are entertained until you find
that the business OF life in Arkansas IS to kill.
There was General F. c. Hndman-the abest man
OF the old slavery school in the State as Bob John
son was the most successful politican-shOt dead
at his freslde, and, they say by his relative. Even
in the State House at Little Rock the spot is
pointed out where the Speaker, ""HOrse Ears''
Smith, cut the bowels out OF Representative An
thony he stood at his desk leaving the presiding
chair for that purpose.


""And, strange as 1t may seem to you,"" said an
editor a, Little Rock to me, ""the that did that
was very respectable and good man. 1t was all
done In ht Of passion. He lived many years re-
spected and bore a good rcputation.n


This was the usual character given to anybody
fond Of killing people, Parson Hickerson, of Dover
Pope county, who was Methodist presiding elder,
and twenty-five years an itnerant published a card
in the Little Rock papers Ia hast Nv week M saying that he
had Killed half dozen people; Mr.. Halle, who shot
an old sexagenarian at his gate, and Mr.. Perry,
Bakers band OF murderers Religion and bloodshed
are near neighbors and nearly cOmmutable terms
In some parts OF ArEansa ,o mhe TYPE OF
lists of North Carolina, who emgrated on this par
ael to Tennessee and Arkansas, and gave the
SO that even Methodist here looks like a son or
John Knox, while the Baptists are Calvinists
ter is remarked throughout Arkansas The
light and humorous side OF life is not to be found
here, ,.and the Gaelic and fateful qualities and tenn



ofbood, perseverng malignity vanity and treachery
may be said to have examples in every community,
the timorous villain murders the quickest and on
every hip the slx-sh0Oter lies ready to the hand.
And this is the matter In Pope county to-day-the
Old social phenomenon of arms bearing and killing,
aggravated by government foreign to the people.


POPE COUNTY


has 8, 400 population Its county seat Is Dover, and
the other settlements are Norristown, Galley Rock
and Georgetown. 1t is said TO possess coal and it
produces, measurable quantity OF corn, and





is much hily land and variety OF timber;
some wheat is produced, and In places the
one bale of cotton. The census Of 1870 shows that
1t gave that year 1910 bales of cotton LOIS pounds
Of tobacco, and 7is pounds Of wool that It gave
$4,000 pounds OF butter and only nine tons OF hay,
and that 1t gave little wax and honey and some
peas and potatoes, and no more. Here are figures
OF poverty, indeed, In all but cotton As early IN
the annals of the State 1880 it had 4s3 people,
and in 1860, before the breaking out OF the war,
1883. 1t is however, above the average Of the
counties OF Arkansas in population. II had 97s
slaves in 1t in 1860, or one to every eight white
souls, and was relatively large saveholding
in the State, and many as 1867 of the people OF
Pope county emigrated from Tennessee and 841


from North Caroline Aabama Georgia and Msss
natives OF the British Islands There are, indeed
birth to above 47o6OO native Americans. Pop
county has about 3,!oo acres OF improved land,
whole valued officially at $685. and its live stock
is set down as worth only $4,000.


HOW THE WAR BEGAN.


Pope county was settled, before the United
States possessed it, by few French and after.
wards by some civilized CheroKees who finally
moved on to the Indian Territory. During the
war 1t was neutral ground, and successfully over
run by federals from Dardanelle and Lewlsburg
and by rangers and jayhawkers Of both armies,
and OF neither. Horses and stock were stolen
houses burned and waysde murders committed
The people, observing old political lines, fell into
both armies, according 10 their traditions; but
they seem not to have divided by auy peOgra phcal


line. Between rival families recriminations en-
sued after the peace, and in time old grudges be.

was followed by the mild b4t inefficient adplpis-

although the citizens disavow the acts, and say
that they were private assassnatiOns arising from
personal causes. After the new and dislranchising
constitution went into operation lu ensled, and
for some time everything was quiet; but the county

to leave his bed yesterday. Thomas nackett was
arrested for this assault, while Joseph Lynch, OF
First avenue, was arrested ut the instance OF son
Of Mr.. More whom he assaulted. Joseph Reed was

On Sunday sight last, between the hours Of
u and /, the dwelling house of NJ. Waller ]. |
0riha,h, In Kent county, Maryland, oae mile |
from Sassafras, was set on DIRE. So far had the |
flames progressed before Il Was discovered, the
inmairs Of the dwelling, consisting of Mr.. Crit
Ath his wife, An aunt and cousin, had scarcely
time TO escape, doing so In their night-clothes.
The house, which was n thrcc-story frame, hand
somcly furnished was entirely consumed, to-
gc,her with iis conieuis, nothing hut = few pa
pers belonging to Mr.. Gfifiih being saved from
ihe fiery element. A mcat-house, standing near,
was also destroyed, and the total loss 10 csiims-
ted al s., 900, upon which, We understand. there
was insurance og 81, 900.


The FIRE was evidently the work Of an inceudi.
AIRY, and suspicion fell upon john Jones, a negro
man, with whom Mr.. Griffith had n difficulty
some DAYS previous. Jones was living In .
house belonging TO Mr.. Griffith, and. after the
difficulty had heen ordered 10 move, which he did
on Saturday, the day before the FIRE. Jones hsd
made threats against Mr.. Grifith, which cast
suspicion upon him. Accordingly, on Monday
morning, Jones, who had moved To Warwick
was arrested hy lanes Merritt, who was depu-
,ixcd by Esquire Bell in the absence Of n consta-
bic, TO make the arrcsi. George simpson, n
steJ-son OF Jones, who lived with Mr.. Griffith,
hut who was then in Sassafras. was sent for NJ
witness, as wns also John Handy, negro who
lived with Amos W. Lynch, Esq. near this town.





Of arson. During the trial Simpson testified that
he was prescni during the FIRE, and saw him car
~ corn-blades from tho barn. put them under
the house In four places and set fire 10 them
that no would have informed Mr.. Griffith Of II,
but that Jones. who had . gun, ihrcafcscd to
shoot him should he do so. Jones, II Is said had
the Cnn to shoot Mr.. Griffith when he came out,
but the flames were burning so brightly before
he came out, Jones had left through fear OF being
discovered ny persons who might he athneted
ih,hcr by the fire. The testimony OF Handy was
favorable TO ioncs. and testified TO hcing with
him all night, This was probably fact, hut Il
was strange tha, he should know all ahont the
fire so early in the morning: for, when he went
out to Mr. Lynchs 10 work, early IN the morn
ing, he related all the incidents Of tho Grc. How
ever, Jones MS the felon, and Handy and Simpson
Ms witnesses, were committed to Elk,on Jail to
| await trial


| Shortly after sunset. Mr.. Merritt, with his
| prisoners hand-cufcd and tied. started for Elk
| ton, but when within half mile Of Pivo, Bridge
abou, 81 o'clock ho was acrosicd hy gang of
men who issued from the woods. While one
seized his horse, others dragged him from The
wagon aud secured the negroes. Mr.. Merritt did
his utnos, TO protect himself and prisoners, firing
six shots n, the ku-klax. lIo does not know
| whether he struck any or not and as soon rs
possible go, away and drove 10 Elkion. whore he
arrived n little after 10 o'clock. No one but
those engaged knows the res, Of the tale, but
next morning Mr.. Merritt and Richard Thomas,
Esq sheriff of Ccci! county. praccedcd TO the
scene of the affair Of the night previous, and a.
bout fifty yards In the woods discovered Jones
| hung to IA tree, life extinct. lie had no marks OF
violence on his person, and was suspended hy a
rope around ihc neck his feet few inches from
the ground The sheriff had his body buried in
| the woods near the scene of his death.


The perpetrators OF the deed, II Is supposed
were hlacked, as black fngcr-marks were OBJ
served on the clothes of Jones, and Mr.. merritt,
also had some on his pants where he WAS seized
when he was dragged from the wagon.


We do not favor lynch law, for there Is pun
ishmcnt prescribed by iaw for all offences. In
| somc cases, however, the punishment is not sc-
go enough and l,nching il the only way by
which o,..andcrs can get their just deserts. II

cut the cords which dashed handles together but the
knives were kept away until the cords were protected
by pieces OF bent tin.


Inspector Jameson, who was in command OF detaeh-
Of police, the majority of whom werc stationed
out sight, made attempt to beat back the Gould
party. Several Of his men guarded the doors commun
eating with the leading Offices and allowed none 10 enter
except such as could prove their Identity but otherwise
the police were useless At about o'clock Superintend
Kelso stroled into the building and entered the
office Of the Vice President Mr.. Archer sitting at
his desk at tho moment, and, calling Keso, addressed
him az follows:


capt Kelso, why is there 80 much one sdedness' in
this matterp


Kelso replied: ""How one-sidedness, Mr.. Archerl
Have not the actions OF my men gwen satisfactionP


Archer replied, that they certainly had not, ana
referred to the visit Of police officials to Gould
and his friends at the Open House, on the
preceding evening"" when he Archer1 was obliged to go
out and individually give orders for and see to the pro-
lection Of the property Of the Company Keso having
no reply to make Archer continued to the effect that he
would make O sworn etatement the Governor of the
action Of the police officials during the recent troubles
and inmated that the next time protection was re-
Quied they would have militia, and would not have any
communication with the police. Kelso turned away,
evidently very much chagrined By Archers observa-
tons During the day Keso remarked. that the position
of hs that OF armed neutrality and they would
simply act to preserve the peace 1t was subject OF
general remark that the police seemed to be acting In
Gouds interest otherwise Lynchs roughs would not
have been allowed TO enter the building or when found
inside would have been driven out instantly.


When Jay Gould had thus obtained admission to his
own room he immediately set about devsing means to
regain his lost ground, and at the following order
posted upon the Twentythirdst. entrance TO the
Opera House;

We are certainly in no danger Of relapsing
into the practices of our Puritanical En-

a good many curious things at the font, and
there are people walking about, even in this

are anything but Christian in point Of SEEM

two queer specimens of personal nomencla-

ago, there were two negro children whose
names were respectively, ''Hollywood Gem.

there is another colored boy in Mississippi
who made his advent during the early sum-
mer of 1868, in consequence of which TACT
his parents have seen fit to dub hiui
""Cause he Freeborn""


Most readers will think ""Zeta"" curiou,
first name to bear, but its oddity was in
creased ten-fold by the addition Of ""Jeter'
as the middle name OF the Virginian cler-
gyman who bore and honored the queer
combination, not many years since.


Another curious case was that of Lynch
burg merchant whose name was ""Valerius.
Disliking it very much, he always signed
the initial only When it came to the ma
ming of son for him the old gentleman
refused to make the boy ""Valerius,"" and
SO named him simply ""V."" and ""V"" he
remains to this day.


Perhaps the oddcst-looking name in thi.
country is that of a prominent Arkansas
Judge, who, for the sake of Distinguishing
himself from several other persons havin!
precisely the same name as his own, writes
the middle initial after the surname, and i,
known as 'sWilliam Conway b


A very singular fact in regard to names
was disco' cred recently by a statistician
who fnds from careful examination o
the official registry of births that very /, ear

Necessary for Salvation, and an Infalli-


bic Church Required for Faith.


The mass sung by the choir yesterday at this
church was Meiner's, the organ being presided
over by Mr.. Danforth The principal solo in the
''Gloria"" was the ""Laudamus Te,"" which was sung
by Collett with his usual power. Miss Emma How
son sang the ""Et mcarnatus"" Of the ""Credo"" with
precision and cultivated taste that left nothing
to be desired In the ""Agnus Del"" the choruses
were very fine. In the afternoon Corini's vespers
were sung.


The high mass was celebrated by the Rev. Father
Lynch. After the first gospel the Rev. Father
McQuirk ascended the pulpit, and beforo announc-
ing the text of his sermon announced that on next
Sunday the mission by the Jesuit Fathers would be
opened In this church.


| Father McQuirk then preached from John xiv %
""But the Paraclete, the Holy Ghost, whom the
Father viii send in NV name, He Will teach you all
things and bring all things to your mind, whatso-
ever shall have said to you."" OF the many great
gifts with which God has endowed His Church un-
questionaby that of her inlallibility. whether we
view the gift itself its absolute necessity for the
maintenance OF Christian unity and divine faith, is
the greatest. Infallibility is an attribute OF God
alone. Yet He Is free to confer 1t upon man
II He deems 1t necessary to carry out the work
OF salvation. Thus He has conferred 1t upon His
Church to enable her to teach with authority





OF which he has made her the depository and guard
ian, and TO AFFORD us ground OF certainty by which
we may be able to elicit acts OF divine iaith neces
sary for eternal salvation The infalbility of the
Church surpasses all other prerogatives. 1t is the
cornerstone OF the Catholic Church. Without it
the Church would toter and fall into fragments;
with 1t 1t Is firmly compacted and bound together.


No small amount OF mlsapprehension exists In
the meaning OF the dogma OF nlallibility Infalli.
bity does not mean impeccability. Catholics do
not believe in the snlessness Of popes, bishops or
In n n npN
their FIRE freedom from sin being in PROPORTION
Catholics claim inerrancy except in matters
pertaining 10 faith and morals. When we say that
mission Of teaching men the truths OF revelation
and the principles OF morality, is not liable to any
error by virtue OF the promises made her by Jesus
Christ. His Divine spirit abdes with her and
enables her to decide with unerring authority what
were the doctrines delivered to the Apostles, to ex
pound their true sense and condemn teachings con-


There is no salvation without faith, and without
an infallibe Church we cannot have 1.-THE rational
faith of which the Apostle speaks. For what is
faiths 1t is an act OF the mind by which we firmly
6eeye something to be true not on account Of
OF him who a1lrms it. 1t is such faith that God
requires OF US. To have this faith we must be GER
tain OF the true sense Of revelation and OF the iden-
tlty Of that which Is now offered to belief with
that which was originally revealed. How could
the meaning OF divine revelation be unerringy
known II there were no authority competent to
determine 1t T? Is its meaning so clear as to be
obvious TO all Is IL expressed In such q manner
as to defy misnterpretaton? Alas the continued
existence OF heresies from the days OF the Apostles
to our own times clearly proves that the Scriptures
were never meant to be interpreted by private au-
thority. The truths OF revelation are Of so stu
pendous nature, its mysteries so bewildering to
the mind, their comprehension so far exceeds the
capacity. OF beings merely rational, that man may
well doubt Ii the Interpretation which seems to
him just is, indeed. the meaning OF the inspired
writer. II, then, God has made any revelation to
man He has supplied him with the means by which
II ~ may be known and and rightly understood. God
does fully and in manner worthy Of His infinite
intelligence.


reveal to him the truths of religion and leave him
| destitute OF the means to ascertain their true
| and most loving design OF God over His creatures
have been accomplished II He left them In laby
rinth OF doubt, from which they could not extricate
themselves? The existence, then, Of an infalGe
tribunal for the Interpretation OF the Scriptures
naturally follows as an evident corollary from the
fact OF revelation 1t is but part OF great whole
1t is but in consonance with the harmony and COM
pleteness OF all His other works. He wishes that
designed them Now, without an inalIible author a.
ity for deciding without possibility OF error, and
for teaching In the name OF God the truths
OF revelation, revelation Itself would be in
complete; 1t would be an anomaly IN the midst
OF the universal order and supreme harmony OF
the rest OF Gods creations. 1t would be altogether
Intellectual for the end for which 1t was voucn-
sa1ed--the redemption OF man by faith 1t would,
therefore, the @ e be repugnant to the first principles Of
the means requisite to the end sought.


the necessity OF an infallible Church becomes
even more manifest when consider that TO
elicit the divine laith which God requires, we need
to be certain not only OF the inst Interpretation Of
Scripture. but also that what is now proposed to
our belief, IS the very truth, which was originally
reveaed-that 1t has suffered no corruption
pcrversion since its revelation. what means have
we of knowing this In the absence Of an infaible
Church, which can bear witness that the doctrines,
which are now offered to our belief, are Identical
with those received from heaven. We find
in the Holy Scriptures promises as clear
and as explicit as human language allows that the
Church should enjoy, and be strengthened with,
this divine prerogative. In st. Matthew we read
that ""Jesus, coming, spoke to them; all power Is
given TO me In Heaven and on earth; 60, there
lore; teach We all nations, baptslng them IN the
name OF the Father, and Of the Son. and OF the
Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things
whatsoever have commanded you; and 10 ! am
with you all days even to the c0nsummation OF the
world.' From this commission given to the
Apostles flows the infalibility OF the Church.
Christ Is therefore with His Church, and she can
not err or truth itself would be liable to In
many texts OF Sacred Scripture man is commanded
on the pain OF his immortal soul to yield unhesitat
ing faith to the Church and to her teachings an
obedience which surely God would not exact for
any but an infallible Church. The preacher con-
Guided by showing the intimate connection OF the
iniallibility Of the Pope with that OF the Church."

The case of Ann f. Burns, convicted at the
December term Of the Court OF General Sessions OF man
saucbter In the second degree in taking the ue OF Auh
Lynch by malpractice came up last month, before the
eupreme Court, General Term on motion for new
trial made on appea and argued by Mrs. Burnss cou'
sel Wrp +. Howe. Judge Iugraham delivered, ycster;
day the opinion of the Court which was contuIled in
Inv Judges Barnard aud Cardozo. In this decision the
Court bed frS that the law requires the General yes
sions to opened the first day Of the month or me
next day and Recorder Hachet did not open the De-
ccmber term until the Thursday after the first Monday
no legal Court Of General Sessions held during that
month and second that the law requires new pett
iury TO be mpaneed at the beginning Of cvery term'
and the petit Jury which convicted Mrs Burns was inn
naneled I'm the November term, consequently no legal
conviction occurred. This decision will not necessarily
affect others who were convicted by the jury thus mpan
eed as exceptions not taken at other TRIALS as they
were in the care OF Mrs. Burns. Inc report IN the
evening newspapers yesterday that tnlF DECISION
affects the Ring Is untrue, as the question OF the
legality or ilegay OF the Grand jury was not laised
by the counsel nor was any decision relating theIe'o
given by the judges. 49, ,,. ~,


The oversight which made this decision possible WI
probably result in Mrs Burnss escape from punish
ment. Tie evidence OF her guilt was so conclusive t


the Jury who tried her found her guilty without eaN
their seats, whereup0n the Recorder sentenced ner 10
state Prison for years. IL IN very doubtful now
ever whether the witnesses for the prosecution can DC
AGAIN produced, and result, another of the worst
class OF criminals will be liberated TO carry on her muir

GATHERING OF THE CLANS!

The Mob Dispersed by the Mayor!",,"For the last three or four days any person


of an Observant mind might have seen that
there was great commotion among the Rad
| icals. Negroes standing on the streets in
parties of from three to five, generally, con
versing very earnestly, while the white
brethren could be seen with prominent ne


groes cOrnered, laying down, we presume,
the law of loyalty as centered in their IA
vorites for Congressional hOnors. The sequel
to this was TO be a grand beat meeting to


appoint delegates to the County Convention,


which names the delegates to the District
Convention. By inquiry we learned that
the principal aspirants for Congressional
honors were Shaughnnessey,G Grants bench
man and United States Marshal, and Mckee,
present Congressman. Jim Lynch and
Judge Brown were laid in the shade by
the above named WORTHLESS. We learned
further the excitement among the colorcd
brethren was occasioned by the fact that
the first-named couple were distributing
greenbacks in quantities TO suit the indi-
vidual to be purchased.


Last Wednesday night was the appointed
time, and at o'clock p. m, upon that day
the clans from the country marched in with
banners and drums. Upon the banners was
to be read: 'Lake Club"" I"" White Rock
Club and q Forrest Hill Club"" They were
composed entirely of negroes, and made the
streets fairly howl with their yells. These
were understood to be Mckee's men, who
were brought in to overslough the town

negroes and mean whites, who were gen
orally for the man with the unpronounce-
able name. They paraded the streets and
drank Mckee's lager beer and Shaughnnes-
sey's whisky until the time of
| THE MEETING.


At s o'clock they assembled in the Repre-
sentative Hall, having in the mean time
been recruited by the Jackson Grant Club
with jacobson at its head, who took the
chair without being invited, and attempted
to explain the object of the meeting, but his
voice was drowned by yells, boots and cries
of Git down from dar.' 50 We don't want
yer"" ave wants Pease.'' ''More Pcase.""
"" Pease!"" ''Pease!"" Thereupon, Pease,
who was known to be Mckee man, arose
and told them ""to keep the PeaSe,' etc, then
retired.


After that, for about ten minutes, yells,
hootings, whistling and renewed cries of
. Pease!' Git out, you little Jew to
jacobson, &c. jacobson in the mean time
trying to quiet the tumult with the gavel,
Mckee poured little oil on the troubled
waters, but did no good, and subsidized. More
tumult and repetition of the yells, &c, for
about the same length of time. Caldwell,
Morris, Jim Williams, John Patton, each in
turn, rose to pour oil on the waters, and
each went down amid the tumult and yells
of ""Pease!' More Pease!' At last the
stand was taken by


gHE MIGHTY SCHOOL MAN, PEASE,
who, after making Il speech of five or ten
minutes, of which little could be heard
above the yells of ''Git down. FGo onr7
g jacobson ~ ''Git out oh dar,'' 'sGit out,
You book thief"" &c. At last Pease put the
following part of motion ''All in favor of
Col. Pease taking the chair, will say
when Jacobson interrupted him, and words
passed unheard by the crowd, Jacobson
struck Pease, who collared him and at it in
rough -andtumble style they went, when
the crowd rushed to the stand each to sup
port his man. Shaughnnessey made his ap-
pearance upon the scene, gave jacobson a
pistol and told him to stand his ground, and
also sent runner to camp for


SOLDIERS,
who, fortunately, or unfortunately did mt
put in an appearance. The fight was in
terrupted by Mayor Marion Smith march |
ing in at the head of the police. He took
the stand in front of jacobson (Pease hav-
ing Disappeared and dispersed the crowd.


THE SPLIT.


McKee's crowd here marched out; that is,
the Lake Club ""White Rock Club"" 'sFor-
rest Hill Club"" and a part of the jackson
Club and proceeded to the City Hall. In
front of the Capitol Mckee got carriage
and harrangued his cohorts, He said ''they
had been browbeaten by United States
officials, Deputy Marshals and United States
professional jurors,'' &c, which speech was |
much applauded. At


THE CITY HALL
delegates were appointed to the convention, /
and resolution passed instructing them to
vote for Mckee.


AT THE STATE HOUSE.


The remainder of the Jackson Club held
their meeting at the Representative Hall,
with jacobson as Chairman, who said the
meeting would proceed to the election of
delegates, when the following dialogue oc-

John Upton (colored) arose to point of |

Tho News from tho Nutmeg state I'm

The news OF the reelection OF Senator Ferry OF
connecticut reached that gentleman In the Senate
to-day, soon as the decisive ballot had been ia
ken. Senator's Schurz, Trumbull, Sumner and all
Of the liberal members FASTENED TO congratulate
him on the result, together with number of prom


nent democrats and few OF the more recently
elected straight-out republicans. Those OF the old
guard, however, like Conkling. Howe and
Pomcroy, remained quietly In their seats.
They were evidently OF the opinion
that the matter was not 4 subject OF congratula-
tion from their standpoint. In fact, the result Is
very generally accepted as very strong indication
OF the success of Mr.. Greeley in the Nutmeg State
The Cincinnati sympathizers are, accordingly, In
great glee tonight. The friends OF the administra
ton, however, are not correspondingy despondent.
They see in Mr. Ferry's success the result OF

Lumber, Coal Tar and Quininc before the


House-Thc Cotton Claim Conference


Difficulty.


Lumber and coal tar were the subjects Of dis
cusson on the Tariff bill IN the House to-day. Mr..
Lynch, Of Maine offered an amendment to the third
section OF the bill, fixing specific duty OF 81 per
thousand on certain qualities and kinds of lumber,
and So and 81 so on others. The members from
Maine generally took part in the debate, favoring
Mr.. Lynch's amendment. Mr. Frye gave an ustra-
ton of the effect Of protection to the labor OF
the pine regions in his own State by contrasting
the condition OF the laborers there
and those across the line, the former
receiving 50, and the latter 81 25 per day. Mr. Con-
ger, OF Michigan, made strong plea for the lumber
interests OF his State, while Messrs. Brooks and
Cox, OF New York, and Farnsworth, Of Illinois,
spoke for free lumber. Mr. Peters, OF Maine offered
a substitute for Mr.. Lynchs amendment, making
the duty on lumber ninety per cent of the present
rates. Mr.. Banks, Of Massachusetts. event for""
the ring, through whose influence he claimed the
duty on coal tar had been placed at the exorbi-
tant rate Of 400 per cent, to which Mr.. Dawes
swered that coal tar was not taxed at all,
only the products OF coal tar, and Mr.. Banks
retorted that that was Just what was the
matter, and proceeded to explain the fact
that the asphalt companies had formed a ring by
which the whole production was to be controlled.
He read letter from a gentleman showing up the
little game, and closed by amendment fixing tn Q
rate at ninety per cent the present duty which
carried. Quinine was the subject OF some debate,
upon which Mr.. Farnsworth made some facetous
remarks about taxing fever, and not allowing any
one to shake with the chills without making him
pay tax.


The second section, as 1t now stands, is as fol-
lows -tTo reduce the existing duties the fol-
lowing articles ten per cent All manufactures OF
cotton all wools hair OF the alpaca goat and other
animals and all manufactures thereof; all iron
and all manufactures OF iron; all metals

all manufactures OF metal except watches
and jewelry and other articles Of ornament; oil

shall not be less than goods Of the same material
and quality the covering thereof All steel and
manufactures Of steel, wire rope and wire strand
made OF iron wire of steel wire to pay the
same duty as iron wire and steel wre.""


The action of the committee to-day between the
second section and the point where the committee
stopped leaves the provisions of the bill as fol-
lows:-


On all burlaps and like manufactures OF fax Jute
or hemp, except that suitable for cotton bagglng,
thirty per cent al valorem


On all oilcloth foundations or floor cloth canvas
made OF nax, jute or hemp, forty per cent al

On fine flax, dressed, manufactured, suitable
for shoe thread and tailors' thread, valued at
twenty five cents per pound more, threequarters
Of a cent per pound


on lumber and lumber manufactures ninety per
cent.


At this point the committee rose, and an ami
mated scene followed upon the report OF the con-
ference committee on the Deficiency Appropriation
bin. Mr.. Sherman, member OF the committee on
the part Of the Senate attached TO the report his
assent to the inconvenience OF the House to the
Morrill, amendment Of the Senate, and discussion
arose as to the propriety OF such procedure on
his part the three members the part OF the
House and two the part Of the Senate being suf-
hcient to make the report. His remarks attached
to the report considered as gratuitous inter-
ference on his part and, after considerable COM
ment the Speaker decided 1t OF no account any
way and the report was agreed to-


The Quarrels Of the Quarternastcrs.


The quarrel among the army quartermasters has
been renewed, through the intrigues Of General
Saxton, representing the socalled overslaughed
officers OF 1866 carry through the House without
amendment a bill passed by the Senate under
msapprehension OF fact to it's effect upon officers
six years In poss ession Of certain grades The
House Military Committee, after several weeks
consideration decided that the promotions Of on
GERS for war services were Legally made, but az
act OF grace determined to report bill promoting
the officers claiming rank by reason OF seniority.
This did not satisfy Saxton, and learning that he
was endeav0ring to defeat their conclusions, the
committee tabled the whole subject. Efforts are
now being made to induce che committee 10 recall
Its determination, but energetically opposed by
the other side, the ground Of the faiShlessness
of Saxton and his associates The reopening OF
this vexed question causes great anxiety to the
military magnates as IL threatens to upset the en-

ou0tvy.",,"The prejudice which exists among some


classes of modern society, against mechanical


industry and manual labor Of all kinds Is, says


the Lynchburg Nesos. one of the most extra


ordinary, unreasonable, and unaccOuntable,


prejudices which this strange and topsy- -turvy


world had ever witnessed. Now we ask any


man of common sense. Is there anything in


herently more degrading in handling an axe


or hammer than a Quill or yardstick?-


Why, then, should the former be considered


as socially below the latter? 1t is ON the face


of it an absurdity. 1t did not exist in ancient


times In the early history OF the world,


mechanics and artisans were held in great re-


spect. Among the Jews acquisition OF trade


was considered honorable. st. Paul was a


tent maker. Why. then, should mechanics


in modern society be treated as a degraded


class: If it is because Of their ignorance


and want of refinement that Is not the FAULT


of their vocation, but because of defective


systems of education, which include In their


bracing tho whole community. Judged by


their usefulness to society, and by the works
of their hands. there Ii no profession, except


the clergy, which ought to stand as high -
mechanics. What would mankind be with


out mechanics: You laugh ut shoemakers.
sneer at hatters. Let US see You going. about


bareheaded. You say 1t takes nine tailors to


make man. Well, suppose you take turn
up the street In puyts ndturalS1S. The fine
lady speaks scOrnfully Of her mantuA .maker


look look without its piumage? The carpenter,
brick. maker, stone. mason are considered in
feror beings. How would you like to live like
beasts and birds in the woods? Where would
the hoes, spades, plows and other agricultural
implements with which you till the ground
come from but for the mechanics? Where
would the manufactures be? Where the
beautiful ships, the n0blest work Of mans
hands, without which there would be no com
merce, but for the mechanic?
Really it is the most incOmprehens6le OF
all things that the class which creates the dis.
tinction between civilization and barbarism,
should be held in civilized lands low, pie
bian class, not worthy to associate with the
rich and aristocratic. ="

THE RAIN yesterday morn
ing, and during the day, occasionally, we
we're favored with refreshing showers, which
watered the parched earth in the gardens

 Mir. OIeary, next day, was duly in formed of the disaster, and lost his situa- tion. The same fate befell the unfortu- nate Puffier, who, 1t appeared upon enqui- ry, was really laboring under some severe indisposition that to confne him to his bed; and being naturally unwilling to lose his salary, he provided substitute, like Mir. Whifdes, utterly unable to play, and to whom he gave, in effect, instructions almost identical with those given to our hero by Mir. O'Leary.

 MT. Whif1es returned to the home of his ancestors wiser man. He has never been to theatre since, and never thinks without shudder of his terrible advent

 ure connected with the two trombones. AN ENGLIsaMAN IN CALIFORNIA thus re- ; lates his experience on the Pacific coast, in & letter from California in the London Spectator. This traveller appears to diff fer very widely from most of his country men who visit America. His estimate of the difference between Californians and other citizens of the United States is nov el, at least. He says-

 All Engishmen with whom I have talked agree that there is marked difference between Californians and other Americans, and in favor of the former. It comes out, think, most clearly in the

 manners of the lower classes, who have 8 certain frank courtesy that have not met elsewhere in the States. Our explanation Is that California has been settled by picked men from all countries of the

 world. Perhaps the general prosperity

 has something to do with it; it is easy to be good natured when you are we'll off, as Becky Sharpe felt that she could beT vir-

 tuous upon three thousand year. But

 am inclined to think that the habit of wearing and using arms, which prevailed

 almost universally till quite lately, has had something to do with the punctilious pollteness of miners and field laborers.

 remember being told three years ago, by late inhabitant of Julesburg, when that

 remarkable township had only just ceased to exist, that it only recognized two codes, slX-shooter law and lynch law; you shot

 man if his manners were bad, and hang

 ed him ii his morals were unsatisfactory

 Both codes were rather vigorously en-

 forced.

 There is a story of miner who shot his opposite neighbor at the breakfast table

 because he had helped himself to too much gravy, have seen the spot where ! drunken lawyer was shot down for ill., treating an Indian, by philanthropic blacksmith, who had tried remonstrances

 without effect, and whom jury declared 1, to be not guilty of murder. And I have

 been myself in gambling saloon ill Chey- enne where every man was armed to the teeth, and have admired the stately deco rum with which the occasions of quarrel were avoided. A trifling incident that oc- cured to myself in small miners town the other day may perhaps show that something of this spirit has lasted over in- : to peaceful times. 1 was glancing at the names in the visitors book of the hotel,

 when a man of the toughest type came be-

 hlnd me and began reading over my shoulder. l drew back, observing that he

 Was no doubt ln hurry, and that could easily wait, as had the evening before me But the man was so'obyiously diseon- certed that l had to resume my place.

 Later in the evening I passed by him in me, and came up to speak 'I should be very sorry forIyou, sir, to think thatI was one of those bummers who loaf about a hotel and try to force themselves upon gentlemen. thought my old schoolmas- ter had come to the town by the stage, this evening, and was so anxious to see if could find his name that took the lib erty of looking over your shoulder. But didn't mean ts disturb you"" I assur- ed hlm he hadn't done so; and, 1 hope. left him Ut peace with himself. But it certainly struck me that there are not many countries in the world where such man would have been troubled for such a matter. The pleasanter side of such def erence to strangers feelings is self respect which makes the lower classes in California among the most agreeable com panlons have known anywhere in cor responding class.

 HUMAN LoNaEvITY.--A recent writer in the Herald of Health takes much more hopeful view of human longevity than is common now-a-days. We have grown so used to the statistics accumulated by dil- 1gent mathematicians to prove that the length of human life is constantly growing less, that we have come to look forward with more or less of cheerfulness to the time when, by easy stages, it should who'll ly pass out. But now we breathe freer, and feel at least ten years younger. For the average longevity of the race, accord ing to this latest writer, has been constant ly increasing for centuries, and better, will continue to increase for centuries to come. The race IS now in transition state which brings about literally ''the survival of the httest. In the process, greater mental power IS added to the contestants. The conclusion drawn by some hasty writers, that the increased mental expenditure which marks the present age must of ne- cesslty tell against longevity, is unfound- ed and erroneous. The strained and hur- ried lives, which we read are not of neces- sity shorter than the sluggish and slow paced ones of the men of the Dark Ages: the structural capacity of the race keeps pace with the demands made upon it. If this were not so, the race must inevitably become extinct through the increased diff ticultles of existence accompanying in- crease of population. So far from this, as we approach the perfect state of civiliza- tlon man becomes adjusted to his condi- tlons, life has fewer needless drafts upon it, and energetic centenarians, whose walks, choppings of wood and plowings of many acres are now chronicled as feats will be- come the types of the race. The writer adds another hopeful idea. It Is that af- ter species has been exempt for several generations from certain disease. the seeds of the disease die out. If, for in- stance, sanitary precautions could keep off the small pox from species for several generations together, 1t would afterwards be exempt from it. In this way one after another of all the s'thousand ills"" that flesh IS heir to would be eliminated, and our very remote grandchildren, cycles of years hence, would be comparatively free from sickness, and might soon be driven to suicide when they grew tired of life.- Boston Journal F.

murdered his wife. The constable went In search
OF h!A, and found him sitting on Newbaum's stOOp'
Just after taking q drink. When the Deputy Sheriff
arrested him he asked for his authority, and he
showed him his badge, telling him that he suspected
him Of having murdered his wife. He at nrst re-
fused to 60 with the officer, but seeing that the
people were excited and threatened to lynch him
he went peaceaby. He denied having beaten his
wife, but aouaittad that he pulled her by the arm
from his house to the street, sOout hundred
yards.


Yesterday Coroner Watts began the inquest on
the body Of the woman, with Charles Bradbury as
foreman Of the jury.


Mrs. Sarah Evils was the first witness; she saw
Kerrgan go on his own steOp, take his wife by the
hair, and drag her about one hundred and fifty
yards into q grass field; he then jumped on the
body several times and struck her In the face; he
then went to the hotel Of Ncwbaum. Mrs. Louisa

He believes her to have staggered into the grass,

Kerrigan has four cows. There Is

DR.. Gayler made an examination OF the body,
which was In q terrible state. He believed death
to have resulted from the wounds In the stomach,
caused by Kerrigan's jumping on her.


Coroner Watts committed Kerrigan to await the
action OF the Grand jury and for safety the Sheriff
took him to the county Jail: great many people
attended the inquest, and were open In their
threats Of lynching Kerrigan."

/ Herren. epsn. fs
We publish in to-day's HERALD communi-
cation from r. J. Heron, the late Acting Sec
retary of State Of Louisiana, whose name has
figured 80 conspicuously in the events in that
State which have eliminated in the overthrow
OF the legitimate government by federal power.
Mr. Heron claims TO have discovered inaccu-
stant. on the Louisiana troubles, and proceeds
to correct them by setting forth statement of
his own, in which the Warmoth wing of these
scrambling carpet -baggers are shown to be
altogether in the wrong and the Kellogg wing
wholly in the right. We have long since pub
lished the story now told by Mr.. Heron,
together with the partisan versions of the other
side, and, without crediting either, we have
endeavored to sift from them, as well as from
the proceedings before the Courts, the testi-
mony of disinterested parties and the acci-
dental developments made during the progress
OF the controversy, such grains of truth as
might lead us to correct Judgment Of the mer-
~A>oSsl
affords US no new light, except in so for as it
adds his own written testimony to the already
satisfactory evidence Of the illegality of the
bogus Returning Board, in which he figured
with Messrs. Lynch, Longstreet and Hawkins,
and to which, in violation of law and in de-
fance of the constitutions Of the United States
and of the State of Louisiana, federal Judge
assumed to give legal authority over election
returns which were never in its possession.


We will take Mr.. Herrons statement Of the
circumstances attending the meeting of the
regular State Returning Board, at which he
claims that the Lynch Board, as it is called,
was legally chosen. 1t is as follows:-''A
this juncture the Board having been in
session an hour, and holding its second meet
ing) Governor Warmoth handed me notice
of my removal as Secretary of State, which I
declined to accept, not acknowledging his
power to remove me. l then nomi-
mated James Longstreet and Jacob Haw-
kins, to fill the vacancies, which was
carried by the votes of John Lynch
and myself, and motion to adjourn was
carried by the same vote.' This history of
the proceedings Of the Board has been con-
tradicted by the other side; but accepting it
as truthful, it proves that the motion to
elect Longstreet and Hawkins was proposed
by Mr.. Heron and voted for by him after his
removal by the Governor, when he was no
longer Acting Secretary of State and had no
position on the Board. II did not acknowl-
edge the Governors power to remove me-""
says Mr.. Heron but what he acknowledged
or declined to acknowledge has nothing to do
with the case. He had been removed from
the Office Of Secretary Of State by the Chief
Executive, and it was not for him, but for the
Courts, to decide whether the removal was
legal or illegal Until they did SO decide he
could not perform another ministerial oct as
Secretary of State, and hence could no
longer sit on the Returning Board, of which
he was q member er oGicio only. In
deed, Mr.. Herron himself supplies us
with evidence of his incapacity when
he proceeds to state that Immediately
after the adjournment Of the Board
he applied to the Eighth District Court for an
injunction against his successor in the Office
of Secretary of State, Mr.. Wharton, and also
brought suit against him under the Intrusion
into Office"" act. If such proceedings were
needed to restore Mr.. Heron to the official
duties from the discharge Of which he had
been removed by Governor Warmoth they
were needed the moment the notice Of his re-
moval was served upon him, and he was de-
barred thereafter from doing any official act
until rehabilitated by the Courts


But what was Mr.. Herron's actual position
under the Louisiana State government He
was not the constitutionally elected Secretary
of State, but the mere creation Of Governor
Warmoth, who had, in 1871, removed the reg
ularly elected Secretary Bovee and appointed
Heron, just as he afterwards removed Heron
and appointed Wharton. In all such cases
the Courts have held that the appointee can
perform none but the ministerial duties of the
Office to which he is temporarily assigned
that none Of the powers and privileges con-
ferred by the law upon the constitutionally
chosen officer are enjoyed by the appointed,
and, hence, that he has no fixed term of Office.
We believe that such decision was actu-
ally made by the Louisiana Supreme Court
in Mr.. Herron's own case, and that his re-


uoval Of the Assistant Secretary appointed by
Bove6r was held to be illegal. on the ground
that; if legally appointed himself, he could
exercise the ministerial duties Of the Office
only and was possessed of none Of its con-
stitutional powers and privileges Mr.. Heron
was, therefore, simply an agent of Governor
Warmoth, discharging the routine duties of
Secretary of State without any legal rights
pertaining to the position, without any fixed
tenure and liable to be removed at will by the
authority that appointed him. There may
have been some question as to the power
of the Governor to remove Bovee but Bovee
was compelled to 60 to the Courts to test that
question, and could not legally perform"

be celebrated by an International Exhibition


OF the Arts, Manufactures, and Products o


the soil and mine, to be held at Philadelphia


III 1876, and has appointed Commission


consisting Of representatives from each Stat.


and Territory, to conduct the celebration.


Originated under the auspices of the Ma


tlonai Legislature, controlled by Nationa


Commission, and designed as it is to ""Com


memorate the first Century Of our existence


by an Exhibition of the Natural resources o.


the Country and their Development and o
our progress in those Arts which benefit


mankind, in comparison with those of Older


Nations"" it is to the people at large that the
Commission look for the aid which is neces
sary to make the Centennial Celebration the
grandest anniversary the world has evel
seen.


That the completion of the first century Of
our existence should be marked by some i'm
posing demonstration is, we believe, the pa
triotic wish Of the people of the whole coln
try. The Congress of the United States has
wisely decided that the Birthday OF the Great
Republic can be most fittingly celebrated by
the universal collection and display of all the
trophies OF its progress. It is designed ia
bring together, within a building covering
fifty acres, not only the varied productions
Of our mines and Of the soil, but types of all
the intellectual triumpbs Of onr citizens





furnish, whether from the brains or the hands
Of her children, and thus make evident to the
world the advancement Of which q self gov
erned people is capable.


In this celebration"" all nations will be
invited to participate; its character being
International. Europe will display her arts
aud manufactures, India her curious ""a brics.
while newly opened China and Japan. will
lay bare the treasures which for centuries
their ingenious people have been perfecting.
Each land will compete in generous rivalry
Tor the palm OF superior excellence.


10 this grand gathering every zone will
contributes it's fruits and cereals. No mineral
snail be wanting; for what the East lacks the
west Will supply. Under one roof will the
South display in rich luxuriance her growing
cotton, and the North in miniature, tie cease

cotton into cloth. Each section Of the globe
will send it's best offerings to this exhibition,
and each State Of the Union, as a member Of
one united body polite, will show to her sis
Ter States and to the world, how much she
can add to the greatness OF the nation of which
she is D harmonious part


TO make the Centennial Celebration such a
success as the patriotism and the pride of
every American demands will require the CO.
operation Of the people of the whole country.
1he United States Centennial Commission
receives no Government aid, such IA Emo
land extended to her Worlds Fair, and
France to her Universal Exposition. vet the
labor and responsibility imposed mon the
COMMISSION 1s as great as in either Of those
undertakings. 1t is estimated that ten mil
lions OF dollars will be required, and this sum
Congress has provided shall be r4fised by
$40 STOCK SUBSCRIPTION, and the people shall have
the opportunity of subscribing in proportion
to the population Of their respective States
and Territories e'


Inc Commission looks to the unfailinp pa
trlotlsm OF the people of every section, to see
that each contributes its share to the cxpcn-
ses, ana receives it's shares of the benefits Of
an enterprise in which all are SO deeply in
terested. 1t would further earnestly urge
the formation in each State and Territory Of
centennial organization, which shall in time
see that country associations are formed, SO
That when the nations are gathered together
IN 1876 each Commonwealth can view with
PRIDE the contributions she has made to the
glory. W '""o
Confidently relying on the zeal and patriot-
ism ever displayed BY our people in evrrv

ecy' that the Centennial Celebration will |

They had strict orders to allow no one to converse
with the prisoner nor to allow any article to be

somewhat afraid Scannell may attempt to
commit suicide Whether the belief Is
well founded or not, the Captain is determined to
take every measure to prevent it, and hence the
strict orders as to no one seeing him. Even Scan

This is mainly because Mrs. Scannell is in delicate

HUNG BY THE INFURIATED CITIZENS


From Cecil County comes news OF the fol.
lowing horrible attempt ut the Krat'ncat,oni, .. |
friendish spite, and its subsequent Ve.a.p '.,, |
punishment, which, while we cannot Voucn
iur its entire accuracy, we readily suppose ""
be mainly true:-On Tuesday morning, as
gentleman of this city was driving aions W.
road near Pivot Bridge, on his way ~ Marke.
here, with load of peaches, he sudIeniy eaMe
across q large and excited crowd, which o'ock
I'd up the roadway, evidently awaiting the M
appearance Of the Coroner to cut doWh tle
body of q negro, which was hanging 70 a Tree
| in tie woods, a short distance from the Ioau.
| From the various aud excited answers whn'l


origin of the affair, he gathered the foii""wli'k


particulars, though, unfortunately, ne was s'a
unable tO obtain the names OF any W the
| parties.


A short time ago, a farmer In Sassafras


Neck had negro in his employ, whom ne, iol


became deeply incensed at this, and declaied


that he would be revenged. On Monday


night, he persuaded two other negroes IT, as
slst him, and together they started out to ac-
complish their fiendish design. Arriving al
the house of this farmer they first went all


around, and attempted to fasten the doors OH


the outside, so as to prevent escape, and then


deliberately fired the building. The inmates


were aroused, but fortunately the attempt OF
the fiends to add murder to their heinouS
crime failed, and all the inmates escaped with
their lives and such clothing as they Were


enabled to hastily grasp in their h!ght. Ths


house with all its contents, was entirely con-


sumed.


But the citizens Of the surrounding neigh


borhoOd were aroused by the conhagratiol
and hurried to the spot. Before the negroes
4 could get sufficient distance from the burn
ing building to prevent suspicion OF their com
plcity In the affair, they were discovered, AM
hurried off to the nearest magistrate, at Cecil
3 ton, it is supposed, for trial. Here, an instan


trial was held, and one of the negroes turned


States evidence, and confessed all; Th
; magistrate committed all three to )all, an,
. shortly after midnight, the constable, Will
! the prisoners in charge, started for Eiktoh.
While driving along the road betweel
;, Back Creek and Pivot Bridge the constaoi
was overtaken by q party OF infurate
. citizens, who demanded that the prisoner
!; should be delivered into their custody. II
refused and attempting to resist was severel


injured The crowd then took the negroe
i, into the woods, and there dispensed summar
;, justice after the most approved manner
;. Judge Lynch.


: Such are the particular, as we have hear
= them, and while we regret the hasty action
. the parties who thus violated the law by TAX
~ ing 1t into their own hands, We cannst b'
4. say, that If the circumstances OF the Grim
4 As we have related them, are correct, and Il
!. tiends actually attempted to burn the hOu
~ and destroy its sleeping inmates, their pul
y. shment Is simply matter Of mere justice."

At this church yesterday mission was opened

several weeks. At all the early masses the priests
OF the church announced to the congregations the
object OF the mission. At haiEpast ten O'Clock A.
NJ. grand high mass was celebrated. Rev. Dr. Nc
Glynn being celebrant; Rev. Father McCreedy,
deacon; Rev. Father Flynn, sub-deacon, and Rev.
Father Lynch master OF ceremonies. After the

how really little we loved God. and yet how much
which the love Of God brought with It was a fore
taste OF the eternal bliss that awaited the soul that
wretcned life OF the sinner the troubled conscience
which sin afrorded, and contrasted these with the
great mercy even to those who BY their sins showed
that they hated Him most. No one could conceive
how great must be this love OF God which waited
so tendery for the sinner-this great mercy,
which ever continued to seek sorrow
from the errng soul and an amendment
OF life. There was not one In this large parish to
whom this day God was not giving . great grace
In His invitation to them to attend the mission then
being opened, and which, perchance, might be the
last opportunity afforded to many OF them whereby
they might become reoonoiled to their Heavenly
Father. The preacher then exh0rted them in q
most fOrcDle and eloquent manner to respond 70
this invitation which God had given them through
the voice OF their pastor.


The music OF the high mass was, as usual rem
dered well. The Organist, Mr.. DanfOrth displayed
his usual ability, and Miss HOwsOn, Miss Munier
and Sign0r C0llett sang with customary efect.
The mass sung was Weber's In q, the vespers in
the afternoon being C0rini's."

Union.


The principal celebration OF Thanksgiving Day
by the Catholic Church was held in the Cathedral
in Mulberry street. solemn high mass was COM
menced at ten O'Clock A. NJ. at which Archbishop
McCloskey was present. Three other bishops
Bishop McQuade, OF Rochester; Bishop Lynch, Of
Charleston, and Bishop Quinian-also attended
the service. number Of priests from the city
occupied seats In the sanctuary, among them be-
ing the Rev. Father Quinn, the Rev. Father Reilly,
the Rev. Father McGhean and the Rev. Father Don
nelly The mass was celebrated by the Very Rev.
Father STAIRS, v. g., the Rev. Father McNamee be-
ing deacon, the Rev. Father Kune subdeacon, the
Rev. Father Kearney master of ceremonies and the
Rev. Father Farley assis tant master OF ceremonies
The affairs were, as usual beautifully though simply
decorated. The presence OF SO many bishops in
their purple robes and OF so many priests in vest
ments or surplice, impaired to the sanctuary an
imposing appearance. The church was filed in
every part, the congregation being so large as to
press around the altar and rails. Admission was
had only by tickets OF membership Of the Catholic
Union.


Bishop McQuade OF Rochester, was the preacher.
The text selected for the sermon was from John
viii, 81, 49, The Bishop began by alluding to the


IN Ox which M ne psople were called

OF the abundance with which God had blessed il, 1t
was holy duty to acknowledge the goodness of
Providence towards and to thank Him for His
manifold favors Catholics had many things to be
grateful for, and he would mention especially
That we owed gratitude to God ior the
cessation. TO great extent OF that bigoiry
past we had to fight against. But M thougl, here
at home, in this free and glorious land, we We're
not suffering from religious prosecutions, yet il we
looked abroad to the older countries we should see
that our holy faith was still an object Of attack
the part Of wicked men. IN Rome the Holy Father
was in sorrow. Almost prisoner In his own
dominions he was obliged to see himself robbed
and despOied OF the possessions OF the Church and
Of that temporal dignity which belonged to the
adrf: its own people-natives Of the country with
right to dwell in their native land beyond dispute
And the only reason for this expatriation was

Jesuits. All this owing TO the secret societies
which prevailed in Europe. These societies
We're thoroughly organized, and, though in poiut
OF numbers they We're not formidable, yet, OWING
TO the thoroughness OF their organization
and to the determination to succeed that united
them, they had erected most lamentabc ana
nefarous purposes, IN Belgium, before the people
awoke to knowledge OF the true state OF ailaiis


that country was in the hands OF these men, but
| when the people began TO understand the drift OF
the societies they soon used the ballot to delcat
| their plans. Goddess education was the weapon
intended TO strike at religion. Nowhere had this
goddess system OF education had fairer trial than
in Ireland aud yet though IL was at first accepted
/ by the clergy, bishops and priests were com
| PEELED to condemn IL. We were now seeing in this
country that something OF this spirit OF rreligious
teaching was creeping in. Leaders OF the people
had already made known .heir thoughts and in
tenti0ns in this regard. AS yet we were not at.
tackled to any great extent. but it would seem as
j the battle were coming. The constitution of The
United States did not deprive us OF the
right to teach God to our children, and
yet the State stepped in aud practically
did SO; for, though the Bible might be
read in schools yet he knew that, as presented, il
was not the same ours, and we wanted to teach
children the meaning OF the Scriptures. This goddess
system of education was simply the taking away o
the liberty OF the parent. IT was the right OF the
Catholic parent that his child should be Instructed
in religion and be taught ntelligeny the doctrines
OF the Church. The schools in which even the name
OF God would be ignored was not the place to train
a child in religious exercises to insti into his
young mind correct notions OF virtue The preacher
then went on to say that the members of the
Catholic Union owed II as duty that they snouid
speak out the truth everywhere and defend il
openly They were sure, in upholdlng the truth, to
triumph in the end, for truth was always victorious.


The music OF the mass was under the leadership
OF Mr.. Schmitz, the 0fganiSt OF the church. the
singing being by the members Oi the Choral Union."

now exists in Louisiana politics, we may as
well premise %, that it is impossible for
persons ut distance from the scene of con-
lict to get at the exact truth and (2) that


there is great deal of rascality on both sides.
There were two parties in the field at the late
State election in Louisiana, known respectively
as Republicans and FusiOnists.n VIM. p.
Kellogg, now United States Senator, was candi-
date for Governor On the Republican ticket,
and John McEnery on the Fusion. 1t was
understood that Collector Casey, brother in
law of the President, was to succeed Kellogg
in the Senate, in case the Republicans sue
ceeded and that Gov Warmoth was to be
Senator in case the Fusionists had majority
in the Legislature.


The Returning Board, under the laws of
Louisiana, is composed of the Governor and
four others, on whose examination and report
the vote of the State is declared. Several
persons IN the original Board-Attorney-
General Heron especlally-were Objectionable
to Gov. WarmOth, and, on one pretext or
another. he had them removed. They took
legal proceedings, however, and regained pos
session at any rate, they did make up Re-
turning Board of elements hostile to Warmoth
and the Fusion party; this is known as the
Lynch Board The Governor then, after an
iniinitude of bewildering processes at law,
appointed a new Returning Board so
that there were two setsrof canyassing
officers, known as the Kellogg Lynch, OF
Heron, and the Warmoth Boards, respectively.
Then kellogg commenced suit against War
moth to restrain him from declaring the
result of the Warmoth canvass Of the vote Of
the State; a temporary order WAS issued by
Judge Duren of the L. :. Circuit Court, in
which the action was brought In defiance of
that injunction, Gov WarDctA Dec ), issued
his proclamation giving the state to the
FusiOnists by majority of about 5000. In
his proclamation the Governor makes an

THE LRvEES.",,"THE LRvEES.


On this most important subject have


much to say. Upon these works depends


the prosperity of our State in her agricul-


ture and railroad interests. Possibly New


Orleans might exist upon the commerce


passing between the great Northwest and


the outer world, because of her position


on the Mississippi river but the wealth


of the State is dependent upon the CON-


pleteness and safety of our levee system,


and it deserves and should have, az it has


heretofore, your most earnest considera-


ton. For the inst time in the history of


Louisiana, one comprehensive plan has


been adopted, and let hs hope it will be eff


fective.


The various laws passed since the settle


ment of Louisiana to 1871 have all proved


Intellectual to stop crevasses, and occasion


ally vast destruction of property; and if it


were then even proper to trust to the old


riparian proprietor plan, all such ideas


are now obsolete, from the change of the


labor system; and the only way to compass


the object was decided to be either by a


constitutional amendment making the le-


wee tax perpetual, or by contract with
private company or corporation for a
term of years, that some plan could be de-
veloped for permanent security, instead of
the facilitating policy that has heretofore
been followed.


The first contract proposed and passed
by the Legislature of 1870 was subject to
many constitutional objections, and 1 was
compelled to veto it. The next act, No.
of 1871, for the same purpose, had and
has several Objectionable features, and the
additional act or contract, known as act
No 81, approved February %, was re.
quired to Obviate these objections, and
still the two bills do not properly harmon.
ize. You may, therefore. during this ses-
sion, be asked for supplemental Legislation
to make the system complete and effective.
Act. No. 4 provided for the issue of one
million of dollars in State bonds, but as
the constitutional limit of indebtedness
has been reached, this assistance could not
be given to the company. They were also
authorized to issue five hundred thousand
dollars of their own bonds, on the antici-
pated estimates. This was not permitted
to be done, and the company were either
unable or indisposed to commence the
work of building the levees until since Oc-
tober l. While probably without my
sphere of duty strictly construed, yet
felt compelled to take an interest in the
of the affairs of the Louisi-
INA Levee Company and 1 hope my inter-
eren, has Injured to the benefit of the
State as well as the company, for their in
ercsts are now identical, and it is to be
hoped that under the present management
our alluvial lands will be protected, our
,ailroad communications preserved, and
'ur State resources developed, according
% the prophecies of the most sanguine |
riends of the present levee system. The |
outlet and the cutoff advocates are |
he most bitter opponents of the present
'ystem, and have directed the State En-.
yineer to prepare papers on these subjects,
which will be embodied in his annual re-
,ort.


In Act No. z, approved February
""A, 1871, creating the Board of State
engineers and abolishing the Board
# Public Works, you allowed one
hundred thousand cubic yards to COM
'lete the existing contracts of the
Board of Public Works. This was
lot sufficient, as appears from the re-
'ort of the State engineers, and you
re asked for an appropriation of $751;
""a 76 to pay the certificates of in
lebtedness issued by the Auditor for
he one hundred thousand cubic yards,
nd S57, 1853 70 in payment of the GER
ificates of Indebtedness issued by the
'tate engineers to complete the works.


During the high water last spring a
lumber of crevasses occurred, and as
he Levee company had not taken
barge of the works, and there had
'een no legal provision for such
I was compelled to pro-
ide means to close or attempt to close
he breaks. For this purpose the Citi-
ems Bank advanced sixty thousand
oHars, and the Louisiana National
sank twenty thousand dollars, which
honey was expended by the State En-
ineers, assisted by Senator Lynch as
agent, with the result you
I'LL read in the State Engineers re-
'ort, and the special report of Mr..
lynch on this subject.


That promptitude of action and the
ssistance given by these banks pre-
ented vast destruction of property
evident, and 1 would ask you to
make the proper appropriation to re-
md the money as early as practicable.
70 special appropriation was made at
he last session to defray the expenses
+ the engineer corps, and much iu-
was the result. II ia"

acceptance by the State, and in complianc


with the terms on which it was made.


The State accepted the donation by ac


OF the Legislature, approved March s


1859. This act designated the Governor


the Chief Justice and a commissioner, I,


be appointed by them, to act in behalf O


the State. Senator John Lynch was ap


pointed commissioner, and the commission


thus formed received from the Secretar,


of the Interior scrip for 200, 92O acres


The State should have received 2lO,OO(
acres, but there is provision in the act
making the grant which provides that the
scrip shall be issued in denominations Of
one hundred and sixty acres. The COM
missioner of the general land Office in


Washington therefore refused to issue
scrip for the eighty odd acres due Louis
lana.


The scrip was sold at eighty-seven cents
per acre, as high, if not the highest price,
| believe, received by any State at that
time for scrip thus issued.


The 209, 920 acres sold at this rate gave
net, after deducting $317 81 commission
paid in New York for delivering the scrip
there, s132,313 Os. This amount, in COM
pliance with the act of Congress, was in
vested in Louisiana State bonds, as fol-
lows:


$3.50, 900 Louisiana State six


per cent bonds at GA cents. $3.50, 600 90
$50, 900 Louisiana State six


per cent bonds at 81 cents. 21,96O 90
$3.50, 600 bonds for. $181, $50 90


This leaves balance to the credit of the
commission in bank of 1858 O3. It is
hoped that this amount will be increased
by interest falling due next month, on
bonds already bought, to an amount suffi-
cient to enable the commission to buy
S14, 900 more bonds, and thus swell the
fund to 100000 in six per cent bonds
This will give an annual income of
$4,000 to be used in sustaining college
in the interest of agriculture and the
mechanic arts.


The commission will make full and
detailed report to your honorable body at
an early day.


The State is to be congratulated ON the
manner in which the scrip has been dis
posed of and the proceeds invested 1t is
to be hoped the Legislature will be equally
wise in devising plan for the establish
ment of the college. As this subject is one
fraught with such interest to the State,
as it furnishes an important aid
in giving completeness to the educational
system, bespeak for it your most careful



RAILROADS.


/ am encouraged that your faith in the
New Orleans, Mobile aud Texas Railroad
Company is about to be most literally re-
varded, and that, notwithstanding the
most violent opposition at home and
lbIoad, We are to have speedily construct
/ railroad from New Orleans to Houston,
n Texas, and another to shreveport, in
,ur own State. At one time it was feared
hat the enterprise would prove failure,
md that we should lose the large sums al.
eady advanced in aid of the company.
N Europe and in all the money centres
If our own country, the appearance of a
circular, numerously signed by the friends
md partisans of opposition railroad inter-
sts, having for its object the depreciation
# our credit in order to defeat the negotia-
ion of the bonds given by the State in aid
If the company, caused temporary en-
and came near defeating the |
Enterprise.
The company, for this reason, was forced,
or time, to suspend work and, indeed,
he payment of its employees. The
tockholders have, however, recently met |
nd subscribed for the bonds among
themselves, the whole amount being
eadily taken. In addition to this,
1r Charles Morgan, owning and con-
rolling the rival railroad interest, has been
Induced to compromise his opposition and
D unite with the company by subscribing
Dr. large part of its stock and securities
By this combination, we shall secure
lore speedily than was anticipated, not
My the road to Huston, Texas, via
and Vermilionville, but
lso a road from Berwick's Bay, via
ermillionville and Alexandria, to
hreveport


l deem this the most important epoch
4 the history of our State, and if we can,
S believe We shall, at the close of our
administration, be able to point at the
chievement of these two great enterprises,
shall feel that We have done more for
ne material interests of the people than
ould have been expected at the COM
even under the most favorable
uspices. The wisdom of your legislation
n the subject will be fully vindicated, and
he aid, at one time believed to be extrav-
CANT, will be approved by our whole popu-
ltion.

THE WORK OF THE BOARD OF HEALTH",,"houses Nos A. A and 46 Elm street and the rear
houses % ""a and 20 Oak street. The order for their
vacation was Issued some time ago by the Sanitary
Commissioner; but as 1t had not been complied
with the interference Of the police has been rem
dered necessary. The houses in Elm street were
first emptied, and the scene was pitiable as the
wretched inmates removed their furniture to the
sidewalk, bitterly protesting against what they
considered an unwarrantable piece OF persecution.
The police performed their painful duty with as
much humanity possible and did all they could to
alleviate the suierings OF the unfortunate beings
who were SO suddenly deprived Of the shelter
which, miserable as II was, was the only
one their poverty afforded to them. When
every article OF furniture had been removed
to the sidewalk the scene was truly heartrending
and dramatic, looking like picture OF Eugene
Sues ""Mysteres OF Paris"" The old women, 80
feeble that they were scarcely able to walk wept
bitterly and the younger women and children,
though not 80 demonstratve In their grief, were
almost rendered desperate by the predcament In
which they were placed. Every article, even to
the smallest, was carefully removed, and some
old relics, which the owners had kept from
happier days and which recalled tender memories,
were deposited as tendcrly ON the pavement as II
they had been herlOoms The houses, which are
unfit for beasts OF the forest to hudde together in,
far less human beings, were occupied by about six
poor families, and are owned by Messrs Faulkner
ana Johnson, ""A Walker street. The houses on Elm
street were cleared first, and then the police
proceeded to Fishers lane, where the rear houses
of o. ""a and 20 Oak street are situated. The news
OF what the police had been doing in Elm street had
got wind, and when they arrived In Fishers lane
q large crowd was waiting TO receive them in o

To You the public turn when they wish a wrong

OF at least one hundred thousand people. Bone
boiling is the disgusting subject wish to speak or

weather, when breath of pure air was coveted
luxury, the upper part OF the city has been flooded
nightly with the nauseous, sti1ng odor OF the bone
boiling pens located on and near the river front
rom Thirty-ninth TO Fiftynnth street, and
believe some OF this business Is carried on in boats
near the docks.


Many, on cncounterng this smell, become deathy

how long Is this to last Have official in the
Health Board who con siders hIs oath and cOnsci-
entiously performs his duty DO the boneboers

habiants OF the upper part Of the city wish to have
answered, and they also wish this nuisance abated
at once entirely. They want the boncboiers cleared
out and never wish to smell them again. GO to

The committee to which was referred Mr..

pupils desirous Of prosecuting this branch OF

The resolution abolishing corporal punishment
from the schools was taken up for consideration.


Mr. Moore read from the Pennsylvania Educa-

ment that corporal punishment had been bansh-
ed from the Boston schools.


Mr.. Mclntire stated that it was only the next
morning after he had introduced the resolution
that he was called upon to visit child that had
been cruelty beaten. Its body from it's waist to
its knee was in stripes black and blue. II the
punishment WAS inflicted with reason, it would

Mr., Moore replied that he knew the case. The
Principal of the school did it and very much re-
gretted the occasion for it, but the boy had
since been one of the very best in school.

The last services of respect and love for that
godly old man, Isaac Rogers, took place at the
Congregational church, in this place yesterday
afternoon. Suitable emblems of mourning were
put up in different parts of the church; the altar
clothed in black the wall in the rear gracefully
festooned with black and white, and the organ
decked with black. A magnificent calla lily
was placed upon the altar, and in front OF 1t
hung a very pretty wax cross.


AS token of respect to his memory, no ser
vices were held at the other three churches in
town, and therefore, the church was filled to
overflowing-it being estimated that 600 per-
sons were present. In the pulpit we saw the
pastor; Rev. S. Allen, LID, pastor of the
Methodist church; Rev. F. A. Tolman, pastor
of the Baptist; Rev. 8. Hackett, pastor of the
Congregational church at Temple; Rev. III.
Toothaker, pastor of the Congregational church
at New Sharon, and Rev. Mr.. Hawes, of
Lynchfeld, Mass, took part in the services.


Services We're commenced by chant from
the choir, after which selection of Scripture
was read by Rev. F. A. Tolman; then followed
prayer by Rev, HI. Toothaker, hymn by Rev.
Mr.. Marden. The sermon was preached by
Rev. Mr.. Marden, pastor. His text was 1st
Samuel 25th chapter, list verse The pastor ex-
planned that that text was chosen more on ac-
count of the universal loss felt in the death of
Father Rogers than of respect for him.


At the beginning, Mr.. Marden gave brief
biographical sketch of the deceased, from which
we extract the following: Mr.. Rogers was born
in Gloucester, Mass, July Is, 1885, and was a
descendant of John Rogers-who was burned at
the stake; in 1906 he went to Boston and was ap-
prenticed as printer ON the Boston Palladium,
working on that paper until 1872, at which time
he went to Newburyport, and commenced work
on composition of the New Testament. He
was converted while at work, and short time
afterward he joined the church. He then en-
tered Dartmouth College. On graduating his
superior scholarship was acknowledged by re-
questing him to deliver the Greek Oration.-


March 10, 1885, he was ordained pastor of
this church, then consisting of but 81 members,
in the 31st year of his age. Mr.. Marden relat-
ed some interesting tales connected with the
life of the good old man. In his boyhood,
while visiting at the house of an uncle, on the
occasion of boyish dispute, the uncle would
say, sect Isaac; then we shall have the
TRUTH at another time, being praised
on account of his great humility he re-
piled: ""Give grace the glory"" About month
previous to his death he visited his friends in
Massachusetts,, and on his return he remarked
to Mr. M, ''Pye had good time; but Pm glad
to get back: this seems most like home""
The pastor said; Mr.. Rogers flag was the ban
ner of truth, not the ragof Sect Hewas natur-
ally dignified, but always appreciated a joke,
believing christian none the worse for hearty
laugh. He was greatly attached to the young,
always benevolent-giving from his own loaf to
feed the poor. He was never heard to utter an
unkind word of anybody. His life and charac-
ter have been powerful proof of the truth of
of religion. He no doubt had his faults, but if
required to name them could not, for I never
saw one The sermon closed by few fitting
remarks to the church-of which Father Rog-
ers was its first pastor.


Prayer was offered by Rev. Mr.. Allen, after
which the .456th Watts hymn-""Scrvant of
God well done, was sung, and benediction by
Rev. Mr.. Hawes, after which the remains were
viewed by the people, and then consigned to
their last resting place. He was rs years and
months of age. JACK."

The Stars and Stripes became the


national flag of the United States of
America by virtue of resolution Of
Congress, passed June IA. 1777.


Resolved, That the flag OF the thir-
teen United States be thirteen
stripes, alternate red and white; that
TIE Union be thirteen stars, in blue
field, representing a new constella-
ton.


This resolution appears IN the
Journal of Congress, volume 2, page
l65. Although passed on the date
given above, it was not made public


until September Sd, in the same
year, when it appeared in the P,ostc-..
Gazette and Country Jol0ncA THs

field, with the British union of the


crosses of st. George, ST. Andrew,


and st. Patrick on the upper left


corner. Several gentlemen of Bos-


ton sent to the American camp cop
les of the Kings speech. It was re-
( ceived at the date mentioned above,


and the effect is described in the


British Annual Register, l776, page
I47, thus:


""The arrival of the copy Of the
Kings speech, with an account of
the fate of the petition from the
Continental Congress. is said to have
excited the greatest degree Of rage
and indignation among them; as
proof OF which, the former was pub-
licly burnt in the camp, and they
are said, on this occasion, to have
changed their colors from plain
red ground, which they had hitherto
used, TO a flag of thirteen stripes, as
symbol Of the number and union
of the colonies""


The use of the stripes to make the
number of the States on the flag can
not be clearly traced; but may be
accounted for by the custom of the
camp at Cambridge. The army of
citizen volunteers comprised all
grades Of men. Very few were uni
formed. 1t was almost impossible
for the sentinels to distinguish gen
eral officers and privates Frequent
ly officers were stopped at the out
posts and held for Identification un-
til the arrival of the officer of the
day. Orders were issued that the
different grades of officers should be
di istinguished by a stripe OF colored
41bbon worn across the breast.
Washington, as commander-in-c chief,
wore ribbon of light blue. The
stars on the blue feld--""a new con-
stellation suggested by the
constellation Lyra, time honored as
an emblem of union. The thirteen
stars of the new constellation were
placed as the circumference of cir
Gle, and on blue field, in accord
apce With the, resolntion alreadT
given. That was the flag used Al
Burgoyne's surrender, October, II,
1777. BY resolution Of Congress,
passed January Is, 1894, to take ef-
feet May l, 1895, the flag was chan
ged to ffteen stars and hfLeen
stripes. That was the flag of 1872.
By a resolution, passed April 4,
1918, to take effect on the following
July 4th, the flag was again changed
to one of thirteen stripes and twenty
stars; and new star to represent
new State ordered to be placed on
the blue field on the 4th of July fol-
lowing the admission of such State."

while nearly all who rushed out on the platforms,

were more or less injured In trying to get on The
seats were all occupied but there was room In the
aisles to accommodate the balance with standing

 Two passenger trains on the Shore Line railroad came near collision Tuesday eve ming, being stopped just in time to prevent an awful slaughter. It seems, according to the Register, that an official on board the train going east, telegraphed to Madison, when the train reached Guilford, for the in. coming train to walt at that station. The train left that station before the dispatch was delivered. If the official had carried a time table with him he would probably have been able to compute when the train left Madison and time his dispatch accord ingly. It is possible that the Guilford tele- graph operator was green hand and was half an hour or SO in sending the dispatch. At any rate it was gross care lessness somewhere.

THE FISK MURDER.

Latest Returns and Facts.

STOKES IN DANGER OF LYNcHIEo.",,"NEW YORK, Jan. 8.
1t is rumored that Miss Mansfield has disap-
pearsd. In consequence Of srumors that Fisk's
friends in the North Regiment would lynch
Stokes, the police were out in strong force, last
night. The officers Of the regiment have become
responsible for the actions of the men in the
matter, but state that if Stokes escapes punish
ment by legal bubbles, they will no longer be
responsible


Stokes was removed to the Tombs for safety.
He takes matters very coolly. His friends say
he has carried pistol for six months, fearing
assassination by Fisk's friends and was a perfect
monomaniac on the subject.


Stokes friends condemn the action Of the sur
geons in probing Fisk's wound, believing that it
accelerated, if did not cause, his death


Stokes processes to be sure of acquittal. He
is to be indicted Immediately, and his trial will
come OF within month."

 A correspondent of the Lynchburg T1r- ginian in late issue says:

 ""I ara an old man. Old age dwells much on the past and amongst the multitude of remembrances of my boyhood and youth none are more vivid than those connected with the burning of the Richmond theatre on the nig ght of the 26th ofDecHmber, ,18ll |, Two generations have since come and gone. and perhaps what l write may be of inter est to some now living:

 q was then schoolboy in Richmond, very nearly twelve years old. My parents residing in the country, were in town for the winter. They generally eschewed the theatre, but that evening were per- suaded by some young friends to accom-, pany them. Others from our boarding house to the number of nine or ten, like wise attended. The play was over, and the afterpiece had just begun. The actors paused and seemed confused, and at the same time fire fell on the stage. An actor then came forward and announced, Ladies and gentlemen, the theatre is on firc.' Instantly all was tumult and terror. Parties separated, each rushing forward to find means of escape. Of those who went from our boarding house, no two got out together. The pit of the theatre was on 8 level with the street and escape thence, through the only outer door was easy. Many from the lower gallery clambered down into the pit and saved themselves in that way. A good stairway, beginning a few feet from the outer door, led to the galleries. The house was full :; and Tn the | frantic terror that prevailed, most of those in the first gallery rushed towards the head of the stairs. Here the pressure was fearful. Many were thrown down and trampled to death. My parents were for cibly separated. My mother, without the slightest effort on her part, was thrust upwards on the heads and shoulders of those beginning to descend the stairs and so dense was the mass, she was carried in a'reciining posture, to the bottom on Ter feet and then the outer door, just before her afforded ready egress. Leaving with an acquaintance a message for her husband she set off alone for her boarding house, up Grace street. more than half a mlle distant. She lost shoes, bonnet and cap; and when reached the parlor she had ar- rived, and with her hair streaming over her shoulders, was recousting some of the terrible scenes of the fire. She was the first to reach the house.

 ""The father of the writer escaped in a different way. Just after his wife had been carried down stairs, the staircase gave way, and then masses of frantic be. ings went rolling over each atber to the floor. Seeing escape by the stairs cut of, the writer's father sought other means of deliverance. While forced along he felt a current af cool air, and looking to the left he saw an open window few feet off. He was stout heavy man, and by @ violent effort reached the window and seated him. self on the sill. He then rapped his great coat around him and, holding by the out CT edges of the sill as lsng as possible, dropped safely to the ground.

 ''The writer's half sister, sixteen years old, wash the house with her maternal grandmother, with whom she lived. The old lady was heavy and helpless, and making little or no effort to escape, was burned. Her granddaughter sprang to window and leaped out. The fall shattered her right ankle bone so badly that she could not move. After a time gentleman from our boarding house recognized her, and, with other help, carried her to. house one square off. There she suffered agony for many weeks before removal was possible, and a year elapsed before she could walk, and she was cripple for life.

 ssThe writer's mother was sometimes reluctantly persuaded to describe the horrors of that night. Just as she left the theatre, she observed large, heavy old man, lying on his back, beneath a window, perfectly dead. She used to say the look of agony in that ghastly face haunted her for years.

 ""A touching incident well authenti- cated, was this: Lieutenant Gibbon, United States Navy, was betrothed to the most beautiful girl in Richmond. The lieutenant and his betrothed were in the theatre but when the alarm was given he was not at her side. He hast. ened to her rescue, and, finding lady

 whom, from her general appearance, he supposed was the loved one, he strug

 gled manfully for her safety, and al length got her without the building ; Here, to his dismay, the bright igh revealed the features of an unknowl lady. He instantly rushed back into thu house, now a mass of fire; but the ad verse throng delayed his progress st much, that, just as he had found he

 whom he sought, the roof fell in, ant | both perished.

 3 Doctor McCaw, prominent physi ? clan was instrumental in saving man, , females. He sat astride the window sil 7 and persuaded them to get on the seat then, holding hand firmly in his, the. ,. were gently lowered as far as he coul reach and dropped safely to the ground l All so aided escaped unhurt. When al 3 whom he could influence had been thu t saved, the doctor, finding the fire clos at hand, leaped from the window, but i B doing so he injured his knee, which ren B dered him lame for life.

 l ""One who attends the Monuments . Church in Richmond, sees in front kin {. of mausoleum within which is monu t ment inscribed with the names of ' d victims of the fire. The mausoleum oe t cupies the site of the old theatre. Th d Governor of the state was one of the vit ). tins.

The subject Of macadMniziug Fourth stree!

cations for the stone pavement.

ments had proved failure in Richmond, and
were only placed on Streets not used BY heavy
teams The only pavement which gave salts
faction there was one Of cubical block slone from
six to ten inches deep, rolled with fifteen ton
rollor.


Mr.. Hayes thought macadamized pavements
were failures wherever used, and one should not
be placed on Fourth street.


Mr. Baker stated that majority Of properly
owners on the street had expressed 10 him
desire for macadamized street, became it VIA
the cheapest and best, and they did not want any
other.

war In the House of Representatives, resulted in
the reduction of the number from ten to six, and
authorizing three Of them to be built in the Navy


yards, and three in private yards, and in this form
the bill passed on Thursday. DIR. Lynch, OF


Maine, opposed the amendment to the bill re-
quiring some Of the ships to be given to private
yards, and remarked that there were no private
ships kyards in the country capable Of building
vessels Of war. Mr.. Townsend, OF Ia, replied
and in doing 80 is reported to have said:


II want to say that of my own knowledge,
there are shlp-yards to-day that executing
contracts for the Pacific Mail Steamship Company
and for other companies, and are building ships
under the requirements OF acts Of Congress that
are suitable tor vessels Of war. The ships-yard Of
John Roach Il Co., at Chester. Pa, has just
launched one Of the most magnificent iron ves-
sells that the merchant service OF this country
PISS s@d, . vessel OF about two thousand toLs
burden, made OF iron, and so made that at any
time it can be turned into vessel Of war at very
little expense. Lower down the river Delaware,
ut Wilmington, in the State OF Delaware, the
Harlan & Hollingsworth ship building company
has also Just launched similar Vessel, and the
ship-y yards OF both those places have now on the
stocks magnificent vessels, equal in size with those
already launched. and which will be sent forth
upon the ocean in a very short time to complete
with other nations for the commerce Of the world.


It was urged that the iron used In private yards
Was Of an inferior quality. To which Mr.. Town
send replied:


""Ths iron used at present in the Chester and
Wilmington yards, and l believe also in the Phil
adelpAis yard, though cannot speak SO positively
about that a. some OF my colleagues cam Is OF the
very best character, and has been subjected to the
most trying experiments. l say. therefore, that
With the skilled labor that we have, with the capi
tai We possess, with the superintendence of the
very best contractors and shipwrlghts III the
country, men who are accustomed to building
Dtsam engines and steamships, We ought to give
thsss yards an opportunity to manifest their
ahality to build some OF these vesses; and in ad-
ditioa to that, may say that they can be built at
thsss private yards, if not more cheapy, at least
= cheap - they can be built in the yards of the
(aovesnment. In the latter, the daily hours of
labor aro but eight, while in these private yards
khs ruls Il tan hours day. Thus we get twenty
psr cent. more labor at these private yards than
no 40 ct those Of the Government for the same
lnount Of wages""

non was elected Speaker, Boruck chief clerk 4,
and Sargent to the U. S. Senate, we felt
confident the Il. L. company had majority
of the Assembly, and from that moment
abandoned all hope of legislation beneficial
to the people on any question effectins inju-
riously tie monopoly. For these reasons we
have not thought proper to say much on the
question of reducing fares and freights.
Feeling that the company has pocketed the
Assembly Committee on Corporations, and
made its own report on this question, we pro-
pose to show where it has erred The sec
retary of the K. r. company, L. II. Miller,
gives, under oath, these figures to the Com
mittec: Total receipts of the road for 1870,
81 ,43S, $40 80; total expenditures for the
same year for operating, taxes, interest,
discount on greenbacks, and about $3.50 600
other expenses, not yet paid, making ST.
695 ,329 20. Thus showing the company
loser on operating its roads for the year
1870, the sum of $25G,3 1853 80. We have
before us the statement of the company's
fiscal agents in New York, Fisk & Hatch,
made Jan. 1st, 1872, to the bondhoders
Of the company, giving the receipts and dis
bursementa for the past eight years, includ


ing that of 1871. This statement must be
true, as the holders of millions Of bonds are
not the men to be deceived or trfed with, 4,
as legislative tools are. This statement
shows the gross earnings for 1870 to be ST.
995, JIG 18, and the operating expenses for
the same year to be 81, 1914 ,354 S4. Thus
giving the company S3,80O,761 ""a clear
money on the years operations. This makes
difference between the company's state
ments to Legislature and bondholders of ST.
057 ,120 ""a. Are its agents lying to the
Legislature or to the bondhoders? Again,
the secretary tells the Legislature that for
the year 1871 the total receipts were S9,-
S25 ,02S 20, and the expenditures for the
same year approximately, the accounts for
December not being all in YETI were ST.
156, ,563 32. Thus showing the net profits
for 1871 to be but 81 ,GGS, AGA 81. The
fiscal agents say to he bondhoders, the re
ceipts for 1871 were s., ,546, ,342 Is, and
the expenditures 81, 1925 ,42S IL; showing
the net profits for 1871 to be s. ,22O ,9l4 GA,
difference of 50, ,552 ,349 OF between the
statements made to the bondholders and the
Legislature for the year 1871. Here is gross
lying on the part of some of the company's
agents. The company can have no object in
making false statements to its bondholders,
as it is solvent and pays its interest on its
bonds promptly; but it might defeat re-
duction of fares and freights by misstatins
the facts to the Legislature. The reader
must draw his own conclusions. Another
table in the statement to the bondholders
gives the net earnings of the road for the
eight years at SIS 1852, POI %; total inter-
est paid on bonds, 81 1903 1886; surplus earn
ings over all expenses and interest, 81 ,SoS,
S65. The earnings of the road for 1872 are
estimated at $13, 750, 900, and the expenses
at less than so per cent, making the net
earnings for the present year over S6, ,o'o,-
900. This is queer state of facts. Here
are two statements, both made by agents OF
the company, and one gives the other the
lie to the tune of millions of dollars. If We
say it is all right for the company to stuff
Legislators with false reports, then what must
we say of the members that permit them
selves to be thus gulled ?-evidently they
are either fools or rascals. Reduce
fares and freights to one-half the present
rates, and by the Fisk & Hatch report ii
will be in better financial condition than il
now is by the Legislative report. We give
these facts, not that we expect they will ef-
feet members of the Assembly already com
mitted on the question, but as valuable in
may be induced to vote for men and mo-
things, in the future.

About year ago this quiet little town was awak-
cncd from its wonted ethargy by the report OF a
brutal assassination within its precincts. The report
upon investigation proved to be true. Weltering
in her blood lay Mrs. Amanda Spence, assassnated
by one George Grant. Both parties were colored,
the murdered woman having lived in the place
since ls4o and was Justly considered respectable
inoffensive person. BY industry and frugality her.
self and husband had gathered together enough
money to go into business for themselves At the
time OF the murder they were keeping an oyster
saloon and restaurant and making very comfort
able living. Grant, the murderer, was a barber
and had married niece Of the Spences. After
the marriage some difficulty arose between Mrs.
Spence and Grant, which eliminated in her death.


THE FATAL SHOT


was fired about nine o'clock on the evening of the
9th OF October, 1871. 1t is very quiet time in
suburban towns, and the report was heard by
several persons, who ran to their doors to ascer-
tain the cause. Following the direction from
which the report seemed to have come, the people
found themselves at Spence's oyster saloon, next
door to the Eagle Hotel on one side ana adjoining
the alley which leads into Parker's coal yard. The
building fronts on Gay street, and is occupied as
barber shop, oyster saloon and residence. The
oyster saloon is in the basement, and Is reached by
descending some fve or six steps from the pave.
ment, and the barber shop Is on the first floor

restaurant, and on the same floor, s used as
kitchen, and the balance of the building as q resi-
dence. The pavement Is on level with the
saloon foor and about three feet below
the surface Of the alley, from which
1t Is divided by close board fence,
IN which are two gates. In the rear of the
building is small piece OF ground planted in cab
bage flowers and shrubbery It was here the mur.
der was committed. At the time OF the murder a
girl, twelve or fourteen years OF age, was in the
Kitchen. She stated 10 the Coroner's jury during
the Investigation that her grandmother Mrs.
Spence) had just returned from visiting some
neighbors and had gone into the yard to close the
shutters. Having closed the shutters she started to
return TO the house, and had just touched the door,
latch when the shot was fired, and the girl heard
her grandmother eyclaim .'Oh ~ She rushed into
the saloon and told her grandfather that ""some-
body had hurt grandma"" BY this time some people
had arrived on the premises and found Mrs. Spence
lying on her back her feet in the doorway and her
head and body on the paved area. She was imme-
diately taken up and carried into the house. She
said not word, but gasped few times and almost
Immediately expired


SEARCHING FOR THE MURDERER.


The news spread with rapdity. Anxious in.
quires were made as to who could be the murderer
Suspicion pointed to a man named Barrell, as he
had few weeks previously uttered threats against
Mrs. Spence for compelling him to disgorge q ten
dollar note he had stolen from customer In the
barber shop. Barre lived just outside OF the town.
at Bowers mill. Ofllcers Bobb and Lynch took q
carriage at once and proceeded TO Barrell's house.
They found him at home and arrested him. Before
twelve O'Clock he vas lodged in the county jail.
Previous to Barrell's arrest a search was made on
the premises OF the murdered woman for traces OF
the murderer. During the search an old musket
was found under the shrubbery. The musket
barrel had been cut Off to within six eight inches
OF the nipple. The stock had also been sawed or
and whitfield down, the design OF the party who
did 1t evidently being to make horse pistol OF it,
On the steps partially burned and singed piece OF
calico was found, which had been used as wadding.


THE Posr-xoRrEM EXAMINATION


revealed the fact that three balls had been shot
from the weapon into Mrs. Spence's back; one, q
heavy slug, was sticking In the skin under her left
breast; the other two tbucksh0t had passed
through the heart and lungs In the course OF the
examination the pistol was produced, but no one
recognized it, George Grant, the murderer. saw IT,
but ""knew nothing or IL or who it belonged to ~


Grant remained In the house all night and as
sisted In various ways. He helped carry the body
up stairs. He also went to o livery stable and got

Philadelphia to notify the police and In the morn





THE OWNERSHIP OF THE PISTOL

mtted having owned It, but said he had lost 1t
field near the town. When shown the pistol the
previous evening he denied having ever seen 1t be-
lore. HIS stories being so contradictory he was
locked up. witnesses were found who remem-

\ MYSTERIOUS AFFAIR--WHITE
WOMAN WITH CoLoRED BABY
Hickman has been treated to a genuine
sensation, in the mulatto baby line, an
account of which we give below, word
for word as reported TO US;


A fine looking, and well-dressed, white
woman was walking down the plank
walk, West Hickman, Tuesday last, and
when she got opposite the residence of
Mr.. Cobbs, she called to a colored
woman who was going into the house,
aud asked her if she knew a colored
man living in this city by the name of
Alfred Lynch, to which the woman re
sponded that she did not She then
asked permission to enter the house.
which being granted, she stepped in,
and went into the room occupied By a
Mr.. aud Irs Cobbs She then told
Mrs. Cobbs that she had a little baby
that she wanted her to take and raise.
Mrs Cobbs looked at the child and fud
ing that it was a muIatto, told her that
she would not take it. She then asked
permission to stay all night AIrs Cobbs
told her that she might do so, after
hearing the pitiful tale of exhaustion
etc After this Mrs. c. turned TO put
some wood on the fire, but as soon a
she had turned her back, the woman
laid the child upon the bed and slipped
out of the room stealthily without the
knowledge of Mrs Cobbs. Finding that
the woman had left he baby, Mrs. Cobbs
took it and gave it to some colored peo
pie, living in the same house. This mys-
terious woman called herself Mrs. King,
and said that she lived six miles from
Hickman, in the hills. She also said
that the mother Of the child was 4 white
woman. and that she had died some two
months ago. She stated that she, herself
was a poor woman having four children
and was not able 10 take care of it. The
baby is supposed to be the child of thi
woman, that it il the illigitimate off
spring of her criminal association will
a regro, and that she has resorted t.
this wicked way to rid herself of it.


The woman. doubtless, gave falls
name, as no one has been found that ha
any knowledge of her, whatever Th
supposition is that she arrived her
either by the railroad or from off


steamboat, and that her statement c
living within six miles Of this place
false. The woman can no where b
heard of; and what to do with the bab
is the question. Most likely it will de
) volve as a charge upon the county."

CONFIRMATION ON RANDALL'S ISLAND.
The Bishop or Portland Among the Poor
ON Randall's Island and the Boys Of
tho schoolship Mercury.


The annual confirmation OF the orphans on
Randall's Wards and Hart's Islands took place
yesterday. At eight O'Clock, in spite Of the blind
ing rain, the Right Rev. Dr. Bacon, Catholic Bishop
of Portland, accompanied by Fathers Duranquet
and Renaud and Commissioners Frear, Brennan,
Nicholson and Lynch, with select company Of
Catholic ladies and gentlemen boarded the Com
missioners' boat at the foot Of Twentysxth street
and proceeded to Randalls Island. On landing
there the church bell was tolng and an army OF
little orphans, wearing white pinafOres, were
marching into the school, temporarily used as
church. The building was crowded by about
o thousand children, members Of the st. Vincent
de Paul Society, and majority OF the officials ir-
respective Of religious creed. On the right side,
near the altar. sat seventynne boys neatly attired
some wearing military costume with epaulettes.
On the left knelt twenty-five girls robed in blue
gowns, with white wells upon their heads. Thirty
children from Wards Island, one man and nineteen
women were there tOO and all OF them, 151 In num-
Der, were awaiting the arrival OF the Bishop to con-
firm them in the faith. Rev. John A. Mcdonald,
pastor Of st. Mary's Williamsburg, and Father
Renaud acted as sponsors. Prof. Keck presided
at the harmonium in his usual able manner, and
the youthful congregation sung several hymns in
accompaniment. Bishop Bacon having knelt in
prayer at the foot OF the altar arose and addressed
the little ones substantially as folows:-

The prelate then administered the sacrament to
the children, and concluded by exhorting them to
remain firm against the attacks Of the Devil.


The ceremonies ended, the Bishop, with his as
sstants and the visitors, made brief tour through
boat en- route to the scSooshn The M Mercnry @ soon
hove in sight, with her nags streaming and her
precocious sailors dressed in the holiday costume
OF sailors. Captain Giraud and the officers received
the Bishop and the company very cordially. Sixty

the boat to Hart's Island whereon stands build

During the delivery OF this address several were
moved to tears. The confirmation OF the sixty
seven boys and ten adults then took place, after
which the right reverened prelate concluded mis-
laborious duties with exhortation and prayer.
when the assemblage were leaving the island all
the boys thronged to the shore and bade them q
hearty adcu, piercing the air with lusty cheers.
Inc BISHOP and All the members OF the visiting
party expressed themselves delighted with the day
they had passed. The boys OF the House OF
Refuge were not confirmed, because neither bishop
nor priest s admitted there, although there are 500
Catholics within It's walls. The Commissioners Of
Charities. however are not quite lntoerant, in
asmuch as they kindly afYOrd every facility to both
the Protestant and Catholic chapains The afIec-
tonate manner In which the Commissioners were
greeted everywhere yesterday shows that they de-

BATE ON RAISING THE TEACHERS SALARIES.


The regular meeting Of the Board of Public
Education was held last evening, at the regular
time and place, President Glimshaw in the
chair.


The Committee on Teachers, to whom was re-
ferred the report Of the special committee, in
taYor OF employing an Instructor in music re-
ported the resolution with a negative recon-
incubation, which was adopted.


The chair In answer to a question by Mr..
Hiles, ruled that, in adopting the recommenda-
ton, the report Of the committee on music
could not again be called up.


Mr. Mcintyre, from the committee on build
ing new school house. No. H. reported the house
furnished and ready for occupancy when on his
motion, 1t was resolved that the school be
opened on Monday January 9Th, and the com
mttee on Teachers instructed to employ the
necessary teachers to carry on the school
Another resolution authorizing the appointment
OF the usual visiting committee was adopted.


MI Hllles, from the special committee in ref
erence to the prevention Of truancy reported
that, although the committee had not given the
subject that consideration which 1t properly de-
| serves they were unable to report any plan by
which the evil complained of could be reinedied
when, on Ills motion, the committee was dis
| charged from the further consideration of the
subject.


The committee on visiting the Howard school
stated that on account Of accident to the chair
man the school had not yet been visited.
| The committee on purchasing a lot for a new
| school house in the Southwestern part of the
| city reported progress and was continued
DR. Shortdge, from the committee on alter
i ing the Bylaws i'll reference to suspensions and
dlsmssals for non-attendance, deemed it inad-
| 'lsable to make any important change, but
| recommended that whenever a scholar was alb
| sent two half days in week. without perms-
sion, that the teacher report Immediately to the
/ visiting committee. The resolution was to con-
i fer more power upon the teachers and less up-
on the visiting committees. A lively discussion
| ensued upon the adoption of the report Mr.
tebiger stating that he could not see where any
change would be effected.


DIR. Shortlidge iustanced the school in the 9th
ward, which had not been visited by the visiting
| committee since their appointment, and pupil,
| were allowed to be absent for weeks without an,
| action being taken in their cases.


MIR. Atkinson, being one of the visiting com.
mlttee for that school, stated that the gentle
man from the Ninth Ward trusted too much tt
his imaginations, and was in error, as he knew
from his own personal knowledge, that the
school had been visited by the committee.


DR.. Shortlidge stated that he gained his infor

THE DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT AGAINST





The following decision was to-day announced in
the case er po,te il. c. Warmoh to restrain Judge
Durell, OF the District Court OF Louisiana, in the
matter afTecting the Returning Board-


We are all OF opinion that when final decree

an appeal will lie to this Court. We are also of
opinion that this Court has no jurisdiction in this
case to issue writ Of prohibition until an appeal is
taken.


STATEMENT by THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
Iay a1a Tho fol
lowing statement relative to affairs in Louisiana


According to the laws OF Louisiana Governor
Warmoth, Lieutenant Governor Pinchback, Secre-
tary OF State Heron and Messrs. Lynch and An
derson constituted, at the late election In that
State Returning Board, with power to canvass
the votes for Presidential electors, members of


Legislature. Pinchback and Anderson were can
dldates upon the republican ticket, and therefore
vacancies thus created Longstreet and Hawkins
were elected by the remaining members, as pro-
move the Secretary OF State from ONCE and ap-
in his place eow ey tae name ,e OF JACK
puate1 the eecon Of and HsTkps
and appointed IN their places Hatch and Depont.
This Board so constituted were proceeding to can
proceedings were perpetualiy enjoined BY the
Judge of the Eighth District State Court, whose
jurisdiction in the case was unquesioned. War
moth, thereupon, forciby elected the Judge, grant


Ing said injunction from his office, and installed in
his place, before the votes were canvassed or it
was legally known who was elected. the demo.
cratic candidate for the iudgeship in that dis.


t az int ss1 1 ss Sa v e
the validity OF this change OF Judges was brought
in question and the Court held it invalid ana, in
effect, decided that Warmoth's Board Of Canvass
crs was illegal and Its acts void.


THESE DECISIONS OF THE STATE COURT


Suit was commenced on the equity side of the
United States District Court IN which an
Warmoths Board Of Canvassers' and this injunction
was also treated by Warmoth's Board with con.
tempt Instructions were then given to the Mar.
were placed at his service for that purpose. Mean-
while the Board OF Canvassers organized according
TO law or majority OF them, canvassed the
votes and returned that the republican candidates
for Presidential electors and State officers were
elected, and that certain persons were elected to
| the Legislature Warmoth having called an extra
ordinary session OF the Legislature, the persons
returned as elected by the regular Board assembled


at the state House, and after organization made
formal requsitiOn under section OF article OF the
TO protect the State from domestic violence. Reso-
lutions OF impeachment were also preferred by
tuition OF the State the Lieutenant Governor be.
come Acting Governor.


ANOTHER BODY


assembled at Lyceum Hall, in New Orleans claiming
to be the Legislature OF the State and was recog-
nized by Warmoth. Two organizations were thus
made, promising nothing to the State but discord
and anarchy. Not doubling that irregularities had
occurred on both sides, but believing that
jority Of the votes OF Louisiana, and acting
in conformity to the returns Of the
regular BOaTu OF CduVhSserS ana Jne uecSf00s OF
the state and federal Courts the President decided
to the resolution OF the State House Legis-
lature by recognizing the organization with which
it is connected as the LAWFUL government Of the
state.


THE QUESTION TREATED BY A MEMBER OF THE BAR.


A distinguished practitioner at the Bar OF the
Supreme Court has by request furnished the fol-
lowing paper for publicaion:-


The question OF general interest involved in the
argument was this The thirteenth section OF the
Judiciary act authorized the Court to issue the
writ OF prohibition TO the District Courts when
proceeding as courts OF admiralty and maritime
Jurisdiction. Did this express authority to ex-
clude the power to issue the writ On any other
case and to any other tnan the District Courts

Mr.. b. s. Lynch, republican, was installed as
Judge OF the Fourth District Court, Mr.. Bonner, the
fusionist, being forcibly elected Mr.. Bonner held
his commission from Governor warmoth; Mr..

In the Legislature the impeachment proceedings
were postponed TIL Wednesday. II is stated that
Governor Warmoth will not answer the citation.
The Legislature win ballot for United States Sena-

Jup6E BoNNER's STATEMENT.


Judge Bonner makes the following statement


Before took my seat was informed by General
Longstreet that had been elected. Since then

without any warrants OF law, tour polls were
thrown out, and in that way the Bovee Returning
Board made out that was not elected.

WASHINGTON, Dec l6 1872.


The emissaries and supporters OF Governor War
moth in Louisiana are not yet disposed 10 give up
the game. They refuse to believe that the Presi-
dent, after due delieration, has 1nally and ire
versbly Determined to employ the forces OF the
government, as authorized by the acts OF Congress-
in compelling obedience to the decrees and orders
Of the United States Courts at New Orleans. These
DEGREES and orders restrain Governor War
moth In his late revolutionary course and
recognize the Returning Board OF Elec-
tions constituted under the state law in
existence at the date Of the election. The Presi-
dent declares therefore that he must follow the
action OF the Judiciary Department OF the govern
ment and as chief executive give full effect TO it's
mandates He says he has not stepped aside and
exerted any extraordinary power not warranted
by law. Every thing he has done Is in strict pur
suance OF the constitution and statute law. on
Friday last Mr.. H. N. Ogden, claiming to have been
elected Attorney General OF Louisiana on the War
moth ticket, and Mr.. Aleck Boarman, claiming to
have been elected as member OF Congress
from the Shreveport district called to see
the President and Attorney General Will
Jams on this subject. The former pre-
sented to the Attorney General written
statement protesting against the action OF the gov
ernment In recognizing Mr.. Pnchback as the Act
ing Governor OF Louisiana, and asked for modif-
cation Of the policy adopted in that report. This
statement OF Mr. Ogden has been published. u
was received by the Attorney General in respect
ful manner, but the author OF 1t was informed in
decided terms that the policy Of the government
was fixed and would not be departed from. Not
withstanding this and the Attorney Generals de-
spatch to Mr.. McEnery at New Orleans, it is re.
ported that thirty-seven citizens Of that place
started for Washington yesterday morning
as O delegation from certain bankers. money
brokers' capitalists, property-holders and traders
OF New orleans, who are commissioned to present
O statement of what they call 'the true status, OF
affairs In New Orleans, and to protest against the
interference OF the President in the government Of
their State. This delegation is composed OF gen.
tlemen of the highest respectability in Louisiana,
among whom are found such names as Hon. John A.
Campbell an ex-Associate Justice OF the Supreme
Court Of the United States and General Richard
Taylor, son of the late President OF the United
States and brother-in-law Of Jefferson Davis.
They win be courteously received by the President
no doubt but their mission will be unavailing. The
President says he Is already fully and accurately
informed to the condition Of affairs In Louisiana,
and is quite well satisfied Herewith since the over
throw OF its late Governor. The distinguished
citizens OF Louisiana urgently desired the Presl-
dent to do this last January; but it was not pos
sible at that time to comply with their wishes.
There had been no judicial action against Warmoth
in January, and the President did not think it
proper to interfere; but now, aimee the Courts
have been moved to take action and have decided
against warmoth, the President regarded II as his
duty to respond to the request made to him for
military force TO aid in the execution Of these JUDI
cia orders.


There have been 80 many misstatements made
in the press with regard to Presidential action in
this Louisiana matter that Attorney General Will
liams to-day prepared and gave to the public =
brief statement thereof, as published below, EN-
bodyng the facts as they are understood by the
administration. The decision Of the Supreme Court
in this matter has been foreshadowed by your
correspondent IT refuses Governor Warmoth's
application on the ground that any errors com.
mitted by Judge Duren can ne corrected when the
case shall come up on appeal. The Executive and
Judicial departments Of the government are, there.
fore, In complete unison touching this Louisiana
imbroglio. IT remains for Congress to act, II II
shal think 1t advisable, ana that seems to be the
aim and object OF the Louisiana delegation OF citi-
zcns, who are expected to arrive in washington to.
morrow night.

| The death Of James Gordon Bennett terminates
the career of an extraordinary man-of one whose

his times, which will not be easily eGaced. "" y
| When he sought to enter the editorial profession
here he endeavored to connect himself with some
of the political leaders; for the newspapers were
then all through partisan. Mr.. Van Buren, to whom
che made the overture, did not respond to it warmly
and young Bennett isolated in his position and little
inclined at any time to play the subordinate, was
| driven to new venture. He established the
HERALD in New York-an independent paper. 1t
| rejected his own Views his reSentments and pre-
JUDGES, but it was filed with the evidence of his
energy and courage The established papers,
to frown him down, to pooh-pooh him, to denonnce

that political organizations, conventions, caucuses


Tammany Halls, regular nominations, &c were
parts OF machinery which the press was to super

vision has been realized-not only here, where
editor Greeley disputes the Presidency with Gene
raj Grant but IN France, where editor Theirs sits
Icons; and in England where Gladstone and bis.
raeli fight behind the masked battery of the press


His paper grew in value and IN character with

us that he had to rely upon the HERALD for infor-

The warfare of his early life passed. he lived in
serene tranquility. The younger members of the
profession looked up to him with admiration. Poll
ticians feared and courted him. He in return eX-
hibted traits of generosity and magnanimity. Some

the master. He had but delicate physical consti-

was exceedingly prosperous, but this did not alter

The direct line of country between

quadrangle measures lie yards on

semi-circuiar bastions. On either
side of the only entrance is a facade
of carved work, $50 feet in length
and II feet in height. Animals,
birds, flowers, fruit, and even men
are chiselled with great thorough
ness of work and delicacy of touch,
and the whole is in a marvellous
state of preservation. The Taulted
roofs of eight of the chambers of
the palace yet remain, and the plan
and details have led Mr.. Ferguson
to conjecture that the Persian con-
queror Chosroes was the founder.
Sir Henry Rawlinson questioned the
soundness of this opinion, on the
ground that military invader who
merely crossed this tract on his way
to Egypt would not have had sufi
cient hold upon the country to at.
tempt sucn work. Be this as II
may, the date of the building must
be somewhere about a. ID. 600. The
Arabic name, ""Umm Shittah, gives
no clue to the history of the place.


To the west of the pilgrim road
already mentioned, the gorge of the
Kallirhoe, the site of the hot baths
where Herod the Great sought to OBJ

before, but Makaur, which, from its
modern name and from the resem-

tion given by Josephus, must also
certainly be Macherus, was reached
for the first time. Other travellers
have seen it from a distance, or,
more probably, have had the direc-
ton of its site pointed out to them,
and have then marked it enormously
on their maps; but DR.. Tristram Is
the first who IN modern times has
stood upon the spot where John the
Baptist suffered Imprisonment and
death. The names and details of

merous to be given, as Mr.. Stanford

French under the Due de Luynes, I
though both parties had boats, seem
to have observed the great dissimi-

Moabite shore of this salt lake of the
East. The western shore is we'll /

A. Braley, was the first witness examined. He
testified that it was about five O'Clock when the
train on which he was arrived at the terminus Of
the double track, when the train came to a stop.
After stopping for fifteen minutes the train ran
on the single track, and witness looked out
OF the window and saw cOmmOtOn among
those whom he supposed were employees. There
was evidently great deal OF excitement going on
at the time; noticed young man run toward the
flagman and take the flag; witness then stepped
out and saw man throwing sand on the track and
q man waving red flag; heard whistle blow at
the same moment (when there drew a diagram of
the position OF the trains at that time,
which was shown to the jury: the train
whistled twice in rapid succession; it was about
half minute after this that the collision occurre d

the witness whether he recognized any Of
the room whereupOn witness said he did, and
pointed out Conductor Lynch, who had charge of
which he was passenger on the Fourth. He did
not observe Mr.. Lynch assisting the wounded; he
might have been about but witness did not see him;
Conductor Lynch was perfectly sober and drank no
liquor so far as he could judge.


Mr.. John J. lIainey was the next witness called,
and testified that he remained in the until the
collision occurred: he heard two whistles blowing;
could not say by which train; he was standing up
when the collision took place and fell on the seat;
he COrrObOrated the testimony OF Mr.. Braley,


Mr.. John G. Kennahan testified that lie was on
the train which started from Williamsburg about
five O'Clock on the Fourth, and when near Long
Meadow he heard the whistle blow; heard another
sharp whistle to put down brakes, and, looking
out the window OF the second car, In which ne was
seated, he saw number OF people running across
the lot, apparently from Lynch's train; the
collision occurred moment after, and the
shock was very slight; he was not thrown as far

breaks; did not see any flag before the collision,

Owing to the precaution of the Department
no serious fires occurred. Tha horses were kept

| to move at the first sound OF alarm and although
theIe were many alarms and several slight fires
we believe the Department was only once called
\ into actice service. Fires broke ont at the fol-
lowing places, but were generally suhlued by a

JefYcrsOnian NOmi ma tiOns Yesterday.


The first ticket for election was placed in the
field OF rampant politics in Kings county yester-
day. The city and county Conventions were held
at Urls Hall during the afternoon when the fol
lowing named asprants for Office were chosen as
standard-bearers, as ""gudes on the line,' for the
balance of the campaign City Judge, Daniel
P. Barnard; Police Justice, James S. Eschewege;
Justices of the Peace-First district, no nomina-
ton; Second district, David L. Lynch; sixth dis
trict, Henry NJ Birkett; Sheriff, Thomas II. Faron;
Commissioners OF Charities, General T. F. Bourke,
and John White; Justice Of Sessions John j. Dow
ling.


Mr.. Barnard Is q venerable member OF the Bar OF
Kings county, and has long been identified with
the reform movements OF Brooklyn. Mr.. Esche-
wege, who is also lawyer, is a member of the
Citizens Reform Association, known the Com
mittee Of One Hundred, which organization has
assured the public that politics eschewed by
the members OF that body, which is laborng solely
and dsinterestedly in the interests OF the people,
irrespective OF party. David 7. Lynch Is a newly
fedged member OF the Bar, and has never held any

nue. under the present administration.
Thomas II. Faron served two terms as
Comptroller in BIOOklyn, and is believed to
give strength to the ticket. Jeffers0nians acceded
the nomination OF the gallant Fenan General
Thomas i. BOurke to their allies, the Democratic
Reform Committee (RObinson's organiZaton) as
they hoped to obtain thereby the support of the
Irish patriotic element by this recognition Of Celtic
valOr In the OF Celtic national independence.
they also propose to nominate ex-COngressman
William E. Robinson for the House Of Rep
resentatives from the Second district. These
| two crums OF comfort Will satisfy the Demo-
thereof they promise to work earnestly for the eec
| tion OF the Jelfersonian nominees from now
until sundOwn election day. Mr.. White, the
| nominee for Commissioner of Charities q posi-

| served two terms as County Clerk upon ''regu-
lar"" democratic nominations. He recognizes the
necessity for reform, however, at this stage of
affairs and is therefore again In the field to serve
tfQAinterests OF 'the poor, dear people,"" Mr..
Bowling Is at present Justice OF the Peace OF East
New York, to which Office he was elected last

toward more creditable administration OF affairs

one or two o'clock in the morning regularly
visits the first precinct statiOnhonse, 10


learn the news and see life in the rough.


A few nights since raid had been made
| on the purlieus OF Dryades street. One
! cell was full Of women, about twenty-five
in number, young and middle-aged, white,
colored and mixed, all lost to shame, some
cursing, some employing the most obscene


anguage, and none sleeping. In the next
cell one pleasant-lOoking man called this
reporter by name, and asked his influence
to procure a release. He was taken in
slightly drunk, and his poor wife, at home
in the suburbs of the city, would be ter
ribly distressed at his absence. 1t was the
first time this young man had been taken
in, and he hoped it would be the last


At another time the night clerk of the
station called the reporters attention to
the miscellaneous crowd of twenty or thirty
women who had been picked up in all parts
of the precinct, from near the levee to the
swamp. They were noisy, rude, sham eless,
brazen, defiant, not a single trace of beauty
or modesty remaining, and they looked
more repulsive than any other similar col
lection in one cell.


Two or three nights afterward this wo-
mans cell was occupied solely by an Italian
boy eight or ten years old, who had been in
this country only three days; could not.
speak word of English, and was lost. He
alone was in that dark cell, with not bed
to lie upon, and he choose to stand up and
keep awake rather than recline upon the
long and wide boards, resembling shelves,
or upon the cold floor. Mr.. Turnkey
Lynch tno relation to Barney"" of Iber-
ville) put the boy in there for safe keeping
because another boy darted out of the Office
under similar circumstances not long since
and gave the officers a rough chase.


Yet another night the female cell was
pretty full with a motley crowd, some
standing up, others stretched out on the
wide, long shelves, others lying on the
spacious floor. Among the latter was one
who had evidently been once the favOrite
daughter, reared in luxury and comfort, of
fond parents. Her rounded shoulders,
white as alabaster; her swelling bosom,
half exposed her youthful face wreathed
in smiles while sleeping on that hard couch,
formed a picture that an artists pencil
might have drawn, and made a thing of
beauty, yet. of sadness


Another night was brought in young
man, a native of the Sunny South, gal
LIANT soldier on the wrong side, brilliant
journalist, rising and successful politician,
in state of partial inebriation. A most prom
ising future was before him, but he sacrificed
all his hopes in the vain expectation of de-
irving pleasure from slipping the cup that
intOxicates. Could he make one more
strong rally he might yet be saved to grace
the position in life for which his splendid
talents fit him. His arrest was rather to
restrain than punish him."

JUDGE DIBBLE COUNsELs UNION

SECOND WARD HoM1EArEs DELEGATES",,"VI tA0 PuPOs6 VI nominating delegaUes
to the forthcoming convention, to be subse-
quently elected, the Second Ward Radical
Republican Club held meeting last night
at Gaddis' Hall, on Erato street, between
Carondelet and BarOnne, Mr. Glaudin in
the chair.


The club being called to order, the min
utes were read, and the preliminary bust
ness was dispensed with in short order, the
minutes containing the information that
""owing to some slight infOrmalities, the
committee appointed to wait upon the
Mayor, in regard to the measure providing
for an increase of pay of the city labOrers,
did not present the document"" The reso-
lutions of the Phil Sheridan Irish Repub-
| lican Club, the minutes stated, were not
| adopted, after speeches had been made
pro and con, the club having adjourned
| IN nlediGS res.


The club resolved ITSELF after reading of
| the minutes, into a sort of committee of
| collection, subscriptions pouring in accord
| ing to the pro rata rule established. Some of
the gentlemen answered, as an excuse for
! not coming up, ""our pay rolls haven't
passed their third reading yet"" The club
was quiet and orderly. The finance com
mittee ended by reporting progress.
The report of the committee to wait upon
| the Mayor in regard to increase of pay was
! given. The result was the same as before;
| Che Mayor answered it was impossible un-
| der the present circumstances, the Council
having tried every means to bring the city
securities to par.


A transformations is it Mr.. Lewis pays
his men 81 a day.""


This was put down as an interruption.
Ia fod au win hot ff
he could the laboring men should be paid in
gold. The Council would give twenty-five
| per cent additional were such thing posi-
Bile.


Here it was stated there was nothing be-
fore the house.


The communication from the Iish Repub-
lican Club came up as unfinished business.


Mr.. Lynch moved the ratification of reso-
lutiOns of the club be spread on the min
utes.


Mr.. Duffy moved the indefinite postpone
ment, and Secretary Bechtel supported the
motion, though he believed in the resOlu-
ton, yet for the sake of harmony he would
have it put off didn't believe any Repub-
lican could go back on Horace Greeley.


QuestiOn-'Whereld he get the nOmina-
ton 2""


At Cincinnati, and at the hands.of men
who made President Grant, who nominated
him and succeeded in gaining his election.
Horace Greeley was Free Soil Wing
thirty-fve years ago, and his record was
the best in the Republican party. Mr.
Bechtel wished to SET himself right on the
question.


Judge Dibble felt as warmly toward
Horace Greeley as any man in America be-
Eeved in his great heart and generous i'm
pulses. His lite had been to him beacon
light in his younger days, and his example
he had attempted to follow. His object in
opposing at the last meeting the adoption
OF the resolutions ratifying the nominations
was to produce success In the Republican
party. How can we bring about the sue
cess of the Republican party in the State
How can we reconcile these divisions in the
party2


V6ice-""It has been divided for the past
two years""


Then are we to succeed by encouraging
these divisions If the Democrats make
nomination in June, we are beaten, unless
we are united.


The point of the Judge was that he would
prefer Grant TO be President and the Re
publican party in this State successful, than
that Greeley should be President and the
party be beaten. The Democrats of Louis
lana and throughout the Southern States
would nominate straight out ticket and
be true TO themselves, just because they
would win in case the Republican party is Gi-





eral Republican camp drifting toward De-
mocracy. Nine men out of ten on the ticket
would be Democrats, and Ii is not the true
idea to consent to a success of this descrip-
ton. We can not afford to pursue such a
course and overthrow the Republican party,
putting Democrats in power he had thought
over the question, and was opposed to any
Democratic success, inasmuch as he felt
confident they would enact Laws that would
Oppress the masses of the people. Reform
should be cOnsummated within the ranks
Of the party. There is an honest impulse
vet remaining in the Republican party to
nominate and elect the best and truest
men, and he was sure that in the coming
administration there would be d great de
velopment of resources, the like of which was
never seen. There should be harmony and
union in the ranks of tue party, should the
next convention declare Tor Greeley and
Brown.


VOice-Now you're talking.


Well, then 1t viii be time to think what
we will do. But at present keep this ques-
ton out Of the club; don't let us do any
thing which will produce dlscord in the
ranks of the party.


The resolution was indefinitely post
pOned.


A resolution indOrsing the course of H.
c. Warmoth, and pledging the undivided
support of the CLUB, was adopted unani-
mOusly.


Resolution calling for an election Of dele
gates within the hail, no person to vote who
Is not member of the club.


Here Mr.. Brown moved each delegate
appoint his own teller, as at a former cleo
ton the tickets were thrown out of the box
by wire-pulling and trickery."" 1t was
suggested it was matter of some difficulty
for delegate to appoint his teller, when
he was not yet elected. But Mr.. Brown
hung to his point, saying that corrupt men
III the Legislature were sent who got in by
the way he had sketched out. He wanted
the tellers qualified


A vOice-Let them take the oath. Laugh
teri


A discussion, resulting in some instances
in a personal alteration, took place ON the
question whether to keep the rOll-bOOk open
until Thursday evening or close it now, 1t
being said that ''time is wanted to bring
up all the Republicans in the ward""


The secretary said: ''AlI who wish to en-
roll their names must give the number of
their residences. I'm not going to have
that trick of l80 men rushing in here from |
another ward"" [Applause.l


1t was decided that the roll book be laid |
open until Friday.


An excited gentleman said: Hasn't the |
book been open whole yearl Hasn't |
there been time enough for every Repub- !
lican to register his name! "" The chair |
man, Mr.. Glaudin, was of the same opinion |
Finally, the resolution about the leaving the |
books open was laid on the table.
1t was then moved that the club make |
nominations for delegates, and that the club |
60 into election on Saturday The club was |
entitled to four delegates, and fifteen were
nominated.

State who will not share with us strong
feeling of mingled shame and ind gns-
ton at the savage murder by a mob, Of
three men in Cass county, on Wednes-
day. 1t is disgrace to State govern
ed by peaceful processes, and marked by
tranquil order. One of the victims OF
this violence, Dutro, seems to have been
guilty Of no orense but that Of being ac
cidentally in company with the other two :,
and even these two, though accused of
fraud in the issue of illegal county bonds,
were entitled to q less heathensh treat
mcnt than butchery by a masked mob


Some two weeks ago, it was intimated
that there was some danger Of the par
ties implicated in the fraudulent bond
transaction being lynched, il caught, and
Gov. Brown at once wrote to the officials
Of the county inquiring whether there
were grounds for apprehending such a
proceeding, and whether they needed
his aid in preventing it. In reply the
Governor received emphatic assurances
from the county officers that no violence
was apprehended, and that the local au
thorities were strong enough for any
emergency 1t j. due the Governor that
this fact should be known The rcspon-
sibility for not having prevented the out

the supervisors of registration in the pres
ence of the said returning officers, being in
huenced in said refusal, as your orator be-

would make due and proper investigation
of the truthfulness of said returns and state

lawful ballots would be defeated, or that
evidence of the frauds that had been com

cover up and conceal said frauds, and


to prevent the proper legal canvass


of said votes, the said defendant,


Henry G. WarmOth. without any legal au-


the said Francis j. Heron from the office of


Secretary OF State and with force of arms


attempted to take forcible possession of the


records and archives of the Office of fSecretary


of State into his custody, and without war


rant or color of law pretended to appoint


the said defendant, Jack Wharton, to the


office of Secretary of State, and that the


said Jack Wharton, willing to aid in such


unlawful scheme, pretended to be Secretary


of State, and as such member of said re-


turning board; that the said defendant


Henry C. WarmOth thereupon pretending


that he had conferred the Office of Secretary


of State on said Wharton, combined with


said Wharton, and they together pretend to


have elected as members of said returning


board the said defendants, Frank II. Hatch
and Duralt DaPOnte@ and that though


they and all of them were well aware that

any colorado right to proceed to the

same to any persons other than the said
Lynch, Hawkins, LOngstreet and Heron,

ton, Hatch and DaPonte, in order to aid in

officers from any canvass; that your orator

of the said defendant aforesaid, pretending |
to act as returning board as aforesaid, to |
make such pretended canvass Of said votes |
as shall affect an apparent defeat Of your |
orator, and declare the said McEnery elected |
as Governor OF said State; that to produce |
said result they will give effect to ALI such |
fraudulent certificates and returns as tend |
to produce such an effect, and tend to ex-
clUde from all consideration, count or can

been suppressed or prevented from being !
cast, and that it is their intention, by such
frauds, to deliver to the pretended Secre-
tary of State such certificate or return or
pretended result of their canvass as will |
make it appear that your orator is defeated, |
and the said McEnery elected; and that |
while their canvass or return, as your orator
is informed, would be perfectly void in law, !
yet the same would embarrass, hinder and |
delay him in the prosecution Of legal pro-
ceedings in this honorable court to estab-
lish his rights to said Office, to which he
verify believes he is justly entitled, and to
which he has been legally elected; that he
is informed, and fears that it is the inten-
ton of the said pretended returning board, |
in furtherance of their said scheme, also
to destroy all of said returns or GER

tration, and thereby suppress and place be-
yond the reach of your orator evidence |

tended to be accomplished by depriying the

said charge is made in furtherance of the
conspiracy between said complainants the
said Lynch, Heron, L0ngstreet, Hawkins

that he has answered every charge of the
pf y1ln yUJf h +ba +pr,a
OF admitting explaining or denying the same
according TO the truth. And he now denies

denies that he ever made an arrangement
to control the registrars or assistant regis
trars, or commissioners of election, or any
other person, to do any wrong of any kind
in reference to said election or the returns
thereof. He denies that he appointed them
with view to defeat the election of the
complainant, who was nominated for the
office of Governor on the day of
July, 1872, and who. at the time of his nom
InatiOn, and ever SINCE and now is a SEN
ator of the United States and ineligible to

this defendant denies that the complainant
has any interest in the result of said cleo
ton OF the fourth of November, 1872. or can
profit by the result of the same, and this de-
fendant furthermore denies that this court
has jurisdiction of the subject matter of
this suit, or that it can render any iudg-
ment. order or decree in the premises. And
this respondent furthermore denies that
your hOnOrs have any right to investigate
the question Of whether the complainant
has or has not been elected Governor of the
State OF Louisiana, in the manner and for
the purposes set forth in said bill OF COM
plant.


And the defendant further answering saith.
that one George Z. Bovee was duly elected
Secretary OF State of the State Of Louisiana,
at the general election held in the year 1863,
was qualified, commissioned and took nos.
session of said office That in August 1871,
this respondent, for good and sufficient
cause, suspended the said Bovee from the
exercise Of the functions of his office, and
appointed and commissioned the said Fran
els j. Heron to discharge the duties Of
Secretary of State, and the said Heron fs
from denying the right OF this re-
spondent to remove him from the perform
ance OF the duties of said office of Secretary
OF State OF Louisiana; and this defendant
denies all, and all manner of unlawful COM
bination and confederacy wherewith he is

of registration, he has selected persons toT


the office of supervisors or assistant super


visGrs of registration as to obtain persons


pliable to his will, and who would concur


with and aid him, respondent, in the eXecu-


tiOn of any unlawful plans and fraudulent
devices: nor is it true that to that end, and


for that purpose this respondent did es-
| pecialIy, or any otherwise, make it a COndi-
ton precedent to the appointment of said


officers that they should in all things and
by all unlawful means within their power,


assist in the accomplishment of said ends.
That it is not true that one of the unlaw-


ful devices, plans and schemes of the re-
spondent was through the instrumentalitY


of the said registering officers, and with


their aid. and by the pretended aid of laws


Of the State, to deprive large number of


the citizens of the State of Louisiana, in all


respects lawfully entitled to the franchise,
| by refusing to register the said citizens
| upon the list of registered voters, by reason
! OF their race. color and previous condition;


nor is it true that in the execution of said
| scheme, or in the execution of any other


scheme, large number of citizens of the
! State, who are c0lOred, and who had been
| in a former condition of seryitude, were so


refused registration on various frivolous
| and unlawful pretexts ana pretenses,


amounting to 10000 votes, or any other
| number.


That it is not true, as charged in said bill,


that this respondent adopted the means
| and devices aforesaid, or any other means
| or devices, for the purpose of depriving


said voters of their right of franchise as


aforesaid, with the intent thereby to pre-


vent their ballots being cast for the com
| plainant and thereby to defeat complain
| ants election to the Office of Governor
| And this defendant, further answering,
| saith: He knows not and has not been in
formed, save By the said complainants bill,
and can not set forth, as to his belief or
! otherwise whether when the said super
visOrs of registration had completed the


registration of the qualified electors Of the.
State that they had succeeded in preventing


the registration of a large, or any number
of electors, as charged in said bill of com
| plant; nor that when persons so refused


registration as aforesaid offered to deposit
their ballots for the complainant in the bal
lot boxes at the places of election, they were


refused the right to deposit said ballots; nor
that the complainant is in possession OF evl-
dence of that fact, preserved under the pro-
visions of the act of Congress of May 81,
1870, and the acts amendatOry thereof; nor
that there is in existence from 1000 to 5O0O
documents of the same character that have
been in the same manner preserved, with
the ballots attached to said atfidavits and
certificates, in which the complainant was





of Governor of the State of Louisiana; nor
that the persons so offering to deposit said
ballots were in each and every instance per-
sons'Of color, and were refused the right of
franchise ON account of race and color


And this defendant further answering
saith, that is not true, as charged in said
bill of complaint that this respondent, com
bining and c0nspiring with the supervisors
and assistant supervisors of registration by
him appointed, has caused a dishonest, in
correct and false account of the votes cast
in the several parishes Of this State at said
election Nor is it true, as charged in said
bill, that this respondent has falsltied and
caused false and untrue returns, and certi-
ticates of the result and canvass of the
votes cast in the several parishes in this
State at said election nor that said count,
canvass, and certificates are so false and
untrue for the reason that a large number
of the ballots deposited in the said ballot
boxes at said election by persons of color
have not been counted and considered, and
the evidence thereof preserved and certi-
fed, so that the same may be canvassed by
the returning officers for elections in this
State nor is it true that they were so sup
pressed, or that any ballots were suppressed
and not counted and considered that we're
cast for and in favor of the complainant as
Governor Of this State, or that they were in
all things sufficient to have elected the
complainant to said Office and this respond
ent denies that he has any knowledge of
any suppression of any votes whatever. or
that he ever authorized, aided or abetted
the suppression or false return of any votes
cast at said election, or did any other uu-
lawful act to defeat the election Of the COM
plainant.


This defendant, further answering, saith
that it is true that the returns OF the elec-
tions for the precincts of the State were, by
the law as it stood, on the fourth Of Novem-
Der, 1872, to be sent by mail, addressed to
this respondent as Governor of the State of
LOulSianaj that the law as it then stood |
provided that the Governor Lieutenant !
Governor, Secretary of State, John Lynch |
and L. Z. Anderson, or majority OF them, |
should be the returning officers of all cleo |
tions of the State, majority of whom |
should constitute quorum, and have |
power to make the returns of all elections:
that in case Of vacancy the same should be |
filed by the residue Of the board that
within ten days Of the election the return
ing board should meet to canvass and com
pile the statement Of votes made by the su-
pervisors, and make returns to the Secre
tary of State; that the Governor should at |
such meeting open, IN the presence of
said returning officers, the statements
Of the supervisors of registration, and
that the returning officers should
from said statements canvass and compile
the returns of the elections in duplicate
that one copy of such returns should be
filed in the office of the Secretary of State,
and of one copy they shall make public
proclamation by printing in the official
journal, and such other newspapers as they
may deem proper, declaring the names, etc,
of persons elected, ETC., and said board was
vested with full authority to examine the
tFuthtulneSs of the returns and reject OF |
accept the same, should it appear that
sufficient number of the qualified electors
entitled to vote at any poll or voting place,
were refused the right of franchise unlaw-
fully, so as to materially change the result
of the election, and this defendant further
says that the law on the subject of elections,
under and By which the said board of re-
turning officers was created and came into
existence was repealed, and ceased to be
the law of Louisiana, by an act of the Leg
lsIature of Louisiana, approved the TWEEN
sieth day OF November, 1872, which said act
went into operation on the day of its pas
sage, and the said returning board ceased
then and thereby to exist.


And this defendant further answering
saith: That it is not true, as charged in said
bill of complaint, that the said board was
reduced by the ineligibility of P. B. S.
PinchbaGk and T. G. Andersen to this re-
3pondent as Governor, Francis j. Heron as
of State, and John Lynch; and
that said board so constituted, and being a
majority of said board, did fill the vacan-
,ies therein by the election OF Jacob Haw-
zins and James Longstreet, and that said
BOARD was properly organized to proceed to

designate the northwestern territory on this


continent formerly held by the Hudson Bay


company. Some thirty years ago, Sir George


simpson, an adventurous English traveller! in


cluded this region in his route round the world.


He chose, as his path of travel, the Siberian dis


trict Of the east, and the little known wilderness


OF British America, Sir Georges travels, though


very interesting, have long been out Of print;


for journals Of travels in this era Of change,


progress and adventure, are nearly as soon


superseded as almanacs. new spur TO British


interest in these great American solitudes has
been given by the publication, in LondOns OF


a Narrative of Travel and Adventure in the


Northwest of America, by Capt w. I. Butler,


F. r. G. S.


While the western and northwestern portions
of this continent within the limits of the United
States territory have wonderfully changed since
Simpson trayerSed the continent, the British
northwestern possessions remain much as they


were thirty years ago. Few settlements have


been made, and while United States territory


has been opened 10 travel and settlement, the


Hudson bay monopoly kept the British territory


sealed. That monopoly has now ceased, and


large expectations are entertained of the future


OF the Saskatchewan valley. Captain Butler is


very sanguine upon the subject, and thinks i'm


migration will be diverted ""to the fertile soil Of


the Saskatchewan, from the bare, burning plains
Of the hal settled northwestern states Of the
American Union"" We refer this libel on their


region to our western contemporaries. 1t may


be remarked however, that it there are spots
less attractive than others in the United States
territories, immigrants have found other dlrec-
hOaS in which they can ""push along and keep
moving without crossing the line into her mai
eSty's possessions. The Saskatchewan may he
peOpled when British railway shall ""stTetch
across the continent Meanwhile enterprise in
the United States has already made that stretch,
and will triple it, at least, before traveller can
90 by rail from Quebec TO the Pacific without
leaving British territory.


While the traveller of today has not many
changes to notice since Sir George Simpson
travelled across the continent, the changes winch
have occurred are at present anything but pleas


ant. No doubt the Hudson bay monopoly was
thing to be abolished. But changes prospec-
| lively bentcent are while the transition is in
| progress, anything but satisfactory. Wnen the
| despOtism of the great fur company lasted, its
| authority, summarily exercised, was for the


most part unquestOned by whites, half breeds,
| and Indians. Tine country was grand game
| preserve"" and, in securing furs for the present
| market, the preservation Of the various species
| was considered ""Now ""free hunters"" not only
| trap"" but poison game, and slaughter with
| out regard TO the future. The stations which
| the company still keep up, under q modified


control, are said to be maintained at a loss, The
company retains, it would seem, its absolute con-
| trol over vast district to the north Of Sdskat.
| chewan. 1t is only to preserve this that the
present posts are Kept up in the track over
| WHICH lllClI llOIbpuiN mas GedSGNl. 10 4lNb tue
| borderers entirely free sweep over part, would
| endanger the whole.


The AboHgines are source OF anxiety. In
| der the rule of the company they were faithful
| servants, in their way, and, being ''to the man
| ner born"" were judicious and profitable hunt
| ers. Now they see the game cut off nselesslY,
| and, what is worse, find their main dependence
| for living abridged. A Buffalo herd is TO the
| Indian what drove of cattle is TO farmer. 1t


is stock to be used as wanted, and never wan
| tonly wasted In the territories of the Union
| attention has been forced to the needless waste
| Of the buffalo. In the British possessions the
| difficulty is probably even greater. The white
| traders consume immense qudntiueS of ""pem-
| mican,"" or poted flesh. They have massacred


the Buffalo wholesale, to preserve the careasses,
and the consequence is that the creature has
| almost entirely disappeared from the SaSkat-
| cheWan district. This is worse to the Indian
| than the cattle disease"" in civilized regions
| The farmer finds relief by complaint; the
| Indian will not be long in seeking relief in
| his way, which is a much more dangerous one.
While the small pOX has been alarming our
| communities, even under its modified forms, re-
strained by civilized appliances, amOug the In.
dians in the Saskatchewan it has ragged learlully


The tribes are vanishing fast before its ravageS.
| British observers, who have seldom passed Sc
| we're comments on the fate Of the ""pOor Indian""
| in the United States are themselves beginning
| to look with complacency on the ''entire disap-
| pearance"" of the Indians in British America as
| a solution"" of the troublesome question witch
| make their existence an embarTass snocnt. Other
| troubles meet such authorities as eXis. in the
| ""Great Lone Land"" Notorious crimes 90 uu-
| punished in the very vicinity of the forts. The


officials are met with defiance. Lawess border


men confess no rule. In the lamentabe present


state OF affairs still worse is apprchended. 1t is


in no spirit OF rejoicing in eyil' that the citi-


zen Of the United States coutemplates these difi-
culties -four neghbors, But out Of them the con-
| yctlon may rise in the European mind that
| there are serious obstacles in the way of con-
trolling border settlements, and in dong justice
| to wild men. Judge Lynch may even rise yet

RIO JANEIRo, Brazil, Jan. 1s. 1877


We have most distressing news from the RIO Dc u
Plata Last year at this time the plague was juss
beginning It's terrible ravages. Now death comes
in the loss Of the iron steamer America fho
America was one OF the steamers making daily trips
from the city OF MOntevldeo to Buenos Ayres. She
was constructed In New York ana was one Of that
class OF steamers which navigate the Sound. Sae
arrived here In May, 1868, on her way 70 tho
Plata, coming into this port for provisions and ooa
She was well fitted and elegantly furnished for tho
work she was intended to perform and while here
attracted universal attention.


During her stay she was visited By the Emperee
Dom Pedro H., and by invitation ne made IN
excursion ON board OF ner. She left here ana
safely arrived at Montevideo, and thence began
her daily trips She acquired an excellent reputa-
tion for safety speed and comfort. ana her appoas
ments excited universal admiration. Within the
last two years she has passed INTO the hands o.
Italian capitalists. and when lost she way COM
manded by an Italian, named Bossl, whose all was
invested In her. Her loss now has caused profound
sensation throughout Montevideo and Buenss
Ayres and is the last and engrossing topic or Hai-
versal conversation.


DESCRIPTION OF THE DTSAsTER.


The steamer America was totally lost on the
morning OF the 23d OF December, ON her passage
from Buenos Ayres to Montevideo The following
Is resume OF descriptions Of the loss from several
surviving passengers and also from the Chief Ea-
gineer:-


The America sailed from Buen0s Ayres fsA the
evening OF the 22d Of December at the custO vharv
hour, taking 134 passengers. Her company O0n-
sisted OF over thirty persons, including captain.
officers, crew and servants. Sne made her voyage
without interruption until at halr-past one O'Clock

known point on the river discovered twelve 0r
fifteen miles ahead. At this hour one OF the bOtler
tubes called


THE WATER POINT"" EXPLODED.
The steam rushed into the fireroom, h
stantly scaldng to death Two fremen and one GOAL
HEAVIER, who were oi,ing portions OF the machinery
ana at the same time extnguishing all the lights
and scattering the live coal all about room and
between the boilers and the steamers sides. lha
heat was intense that 1t was Impossible
to remain longer below. and the chief eugi-
neer Informed Captain B0ssi Of the fact
and recommended that the pumps should
be rgged and Immediately set going. The pumps
had not been used In some time and were In such
bad order as to be totally unserviceable. In the
meantime 1t was deemed advisable to form c0m-
pany for the saving OF the lives of the passenGen
for the vessel was constructed Of white pine. and
everything in Its material tended to the rapid pre-.
pagation OF the now increasing fire. which spread
rapidly, consuming everything before 1t.


THE FIRE. BEING AMIDsHIPs,


separated the steamers company ana passengers
into two portions those forward being totally un.
able to communicate with those In the afterpart oe

panic and producing deplorable confusion, tho
scene Of which 1t Is impossible to describe. Of all
the boats Of the steamer-whch were able to save
200 people or more II properly handled-oniy one

boat shocks that 1t was next to impossible to re.
move them, and the two which were cast loose
and launched were Immediately swamped ~
the hall-crazed passengers. Some OF the more
energetic passengers tried launch the other boass
but 1t was found impossible.


At this time the oflcers had lost all control over
the steamers crew, who with revolvers, which 10
appears they all carried, were dsputing and fight
ing with passengers for the means OF saving life
Strange as it may appear, no signals were made to
the passing steamer villa 90 Salto which would In
dicate any unusual danger board the America:
and not until the names burst into sight was tha
Ofncer IN charge OF the Villa do Salto aware OF any
trouble or danger, when he Immediately put back

Of the United States were among the lost.


The Captain OF the port OF Montevdeo has asked
that gold medal be awarded to the captain OF the

faith and pride upon almost century Of American
independence. This was the relic OF bitter, bloody
and glorious times, for which they battled and

This gentleman made a sensible argument upon the in
Justice of taxing tobacco, while exemptiDg all other
agricultural products He said: Tobacco is the great
agricultural staple OF Virginia 1t Is the only crop we
can raise with profit large part of the state III Is 10
our farmers what aud wheat are TO the farmers OF
| ulinois-their main dependence Now, why should our
| stape be heavily taxed by the General Government
while that OF Illinois do ms pay cent OF tax Tobacco
is beside a manufactured article. Why put taxes on

The only answer to this argument of course some
thing about taxing uxuries to which the MANUFACTURER
replied Tobacco Is not luxury to us here in virginia
who raise it and up. 1t is the only thing wohaYo
! cot to make living out OF""


But the tax comes out of the consumer in the end

consumption and fetters trade and is, therefore, bur
den upon both the planter and the manufacturer""
| ""Do you think the consumption Is any less than IL
would be without the ~ mo question about that


the higher the price of article is the less of it will be
used That's a law that holds good for everything.
When food is people eat less, and the consumption
of an article that is not prime necessity is diminished
to much greater extent by high prices""

the Tobacco Exchange =. Our tobacco year begins on
the st OF October In the year 1s596O as you see by

7G53 hogsheads Last year there were but 66C6 hogs'
heads Our shipments In 18596O were 34O75 hogsheads,
while they last year only 271l. The product has
steadily increased since the war; however, except III
1870 which was a bad year"" He did not attribute the
decreased production since the entirely TO the tax.
| That had something to do with It, he thought but the

negroes did produce much they did in the con-
dion of Slavery, he said While few were industrious

regularly only caring to barely enough to live upon


The manufacturers all express great indignation at the
recent decision of the Commissioner OF Internal Rev
enue in relation TO the tax on tobacco in bond The
Commissioner it will be remembered decided that all
tobacco bonded after tho 9th OF june the date Of the
passage of the law and before the st july when
the new rate goes into effect must pay the old rate al
though tobacco which bond the 9Th Of June Is
by express provision Of the law allowed to be released
upon payment of the rate only The decision struck
all who had no interest in it absurd senseless, and
unjust. The men who suffer by IL use stronger terms
than these in denouncing it, They at loss to
count for ruling devoid OF any show Of reason
Justice and many fall back upon this expanaon that the
Revenue takes pleasure in annoying and Oppress
ing them and delighted finding omission in that
| law which gave good an opportunity OF nficting
trouble and pecuniary loss upon the manufacturers.
The tobaccOmen have naturally great love for the
Internal Revenue system and its officers and perhaps do
not always put the most charitable construction upon
the acts and decisions OF these officers III this they
have at least show OF reason for II Is difficult TO
ceiye Of any rational explanation OF the extraordinary
decision of which they complains 1t is evident that Con-
| gress never intended, while giving people who put
tobacco bond prior to the passage OF the law the
benefit of the reduced rates established by that law
that those who bonded their tobacco after the passage Of
the law should be forced TO pay the old high rates The
validity Of the ruling will be contested in the Courts,
and the declsiowl unquestionaby be on the side Of
the manufacturers but, in the time, those who
bonded tobacco before the Commissioner made his
ruling either let it remain until the Courts act
| OF suffer loss of 70 cents on every pound.


Richmond, Lynchburg Danyille, and Farmvile are the
great tobacco manufacturing towns Of Virginia. and to
one of these places nearly all the tobacco raised in the
State goes for manufacture for shipment in the leaf

Our position i'll regard to the acts alleged
to have been committed by the Ku-Klux
throughout the South is well known. While
we condemn, without reservation, all acts
OF violence committed by bodies of armed
men, disguised or not disguised, against the
laws Of any State, or of the United States,
we can yet understand the feelings of
those communities WHO, impartial OF the
delays consequent upon the enforcement Of
those laws, rise up, as one man, and pun
lsh, slmmarily, some great and startling
outrage upon person or property. 1t is not
only in the South that such illustrations may


be found, but the recent lynchinG case in
Indiana, and the present troubles in Ro-
chester, may be taken as instances in kind.
Had Mr.. Akernan labOred as assiduously
in reducing the Northern States to order,
as he has done to punish the mythical acts
of mythical Ktl-Klrlx in the South, he would
have deserved, not only the thanks Of Pre-
sident Grant, but of the entire nation. But

''BARKIs TRUMBULL"" AND HIS FIFTY SINS.


The debates in the Senate for a week past
have not been so exciting as they were during
the discussion of the French Arms Investga-
ton, but they have been spicy and personal to
a degree quite inconsistent with real Senatorial
dignity, and without eliciting any truths calcu-
lated to enhance the respect due to so distin-
guished body. The point was on motion of
Mr.. Conkling for an investigation into recon-
mendations for Office by certain Senators with
a view to determine the comparative virtue of
each, or active interest of each in the matter of
patronage. 1t all arose from an attempt of Mr.
Trum bull to parade his superior merit in re-
spect to influencing appointments; but Trum-
bull being known as an actual sinner in this
business it really seemed hard to brother Sena-
tors that he should be suffered to represent
himself to the country as agenuine saint unless
the facts were in his favor. Admitting the
wickedness and improperly of Senators sign
ing recommendations for office, which was the
gist of Trumbull's accusation, the effort to es-
tablish his own righteousness because he had
only sinned fifty times in three years was lit
tie ludicrous, and yet the grave Senators debat-
ed it earnestly. Morton attempted to show one
hundred and three acts of transgression but
Trumbull insisted that the fact of his signature
proved vital interest in only about fifty or so,
and quite adroitly succeeded in getting up
wrangle upon the import of his name upon the
odd ffty-three cases, thus 1iverting in meas
ure the attention due to the enormity of the
fifty cases confessed The whole spectacle was
far from exhilararng It certainly was not
pleasant to see Senator strive to make capital
out of the fact that cussedness had only got
the better of him fifty times, but it was more
unpleasant still to have a talk of several days
on the point whether he was little better OF
little worse in that respect than any one else.
Mr.. Trumbull mentioned as an ameliorati1gcir-
cumstance that one of the appointments made
at his request was relative of his deceased
wife,-a pathetic allusion showing the possess
ion of some degree of human feeling on his
part and establishing the fact that no more
than forty-nine of the cases were affected by
purely malicious or mercenary considerations;
and l am happy to note the improvement in the
male sex since the beginning for it will be re-
menbered that Adam charged the whole of
his transgressions to the influence of his wife
while Trumbull is willing to assume forty-nine

SENATOR HOWE ON THE CIVIL SERVICE.


Mr.. Howe made an able speech on civil ser
vice reform, much superior to Carpenters on
that question, and the Senate by one majority
voted to raise $50,000 to test the scheme of Mr..
Curtis M H4se f.E 7anrrrs f
BROOKS INVOCATION OF WEBSTER AND CLAY.


The House on Wednesday had an animated
talk on the amendment to the appropriation
bill giving an extra half million as a subsidy
to the China line of steamships, which brought
out the leading orators of the House of both po-
litical parties, though for wonder it was not
made party question. The amendment was
defended by Dawes, Garfield, Bingham, Hale,
and notably James Brooks democrat and free
trader of New York. 1t was opposed by But
ler, Fernando Wood & Co., and Farnsworth
was anxious to help American Industry by al
lowing the Company owning the line to do
their business with British shps-an odd way
of building up home navigation interest and
giving the mastery of the seas. Brooks
showed that nearly all the old Democrats of the
stamp of Polk, Robert j. Walker and Stephen
A. Douglas were in favor of measures of this
kind, as also were Clay, Webster and Crtten-
den and the Wings generally, but it must be
admitted that the impression in relation to the
statesmen of Polks time is akin to Hosea Big
lows.


""That they didn't know everything down in JUDGE""
And what Webster or Douglas thought is not
now so important as what Wood, Crebs and
Speer think on the question of subsidies, for they
have votes and the voting days of the others
ended some timeago


GLARING INCONSISTENCY


believe your Maine people have heard some
plain language from the Democrats about the
decay of American Commerce under the blight
ing neglect of Gen. Grants administration. but
the policy of aiding it was as warmly opposed
by Wood, Beck and Farnsworth, as the other
policy which:they declare was its ruin.


After all there was something amusing in OBJ
serving the eagerness with which sundry gem
tlemen-notably Mr.. Garfeld-defending the
principle of subsidy, and how they spread
themselves rhetorcally over the great prize of
Asatic commerce-and then to remember that
less than two years ago they were all found ar
rayed in hostility to the same ideas and policy
as suggested by Mr.. Lynch land favorably by"

THE AMERICAN FLAG.",,"We find the following history of the
"" Flag of our L Union in late number
of the New York Journal of Commerce.


The Stars and Stripes became the ma
tional flag of the United States of Amer
lea by virtue of resolution of Congress,
passed June the 4th, 1777: Resolved,
That the flag of the thirteen United
States be thirteen stripes, alternate red
and white that the Union be thirteen
stars, white, in blue field representing
a new constellation The resolution
appear in the Journal of Congress, vol
ume ., page 1863. Although passed on
the date given above, it was not made
public until September Sd, in the same
year, when it appeared in the Boston
gazette and Country journal. The flag
seems to have been the result of the work
commenced by Washington, DR.. Frank
lin, Mr.. Lynch, Mr.. Harrison, and Col.
Joseph Reed. On the I'd of January,
l777, Washington was in the American
camp at Cambridge, organizing the new
army which was that day created. Tho
Committee of Conference, consisting of
Franklin, Lynch and Harrison, sent by
Congress to arrange with Washington
these details of the army. were with him.
Col. Reed, one of the aides-de- camp, was
also Secretary of the Committee of Confer
ence. The several designs for flags had
long occupied the thoughts of Reed and
his associates. The flag in use by the
army was plain red field, with the Brit
ish union of the crosses of st Andrew,
st George and st. Patrick on the upper
left corner. Several gentlemen of Bos-
ton sent to the American camp copies Of
the kings's speech. II was received on
the date mentioned above, and the effect
is described in the BRITISH AnnudI Reg
tStcr, l777, page l47, thus:


""Thc arrival of the copy Of the kings
| speech, with an account of the fate Of the
petition from the Continental Congress
is said to have excited the greatest de-
gree of rage and Indignation among them,
AS proof of which the former was pub
licly burnt in the camp and they are
said on this occasion to have changed
their colors from plain red ground,
which they had hitherto used, to n flag of
thirteen stripes, rs n symbol of the num-
and union of the colonies""


The use of Stripes to make the num-
ber of the States on the flag cannot be
clearly traced, but may be accounted for
by the custom Of the camp at Cambridge.
The army of citizen volunteers comprised
all grades of men. Very few were uni
formed. 1t was almost impossible for
the sentinel to distinguish general officers
and privntes. Frequently officers were
stopped ut the outposts and held for ident-
! ifcation until the arrival of the officer Of
the day. Orders were issued that the
different grades of officers should be dis
tnguishcd by stripe of colorcd ribbon
worn across the breast. Washington, MS
commander-in-c chief, wore n ribbon of
light blue. The stars on the blue field
""a new constellation ""--were suggested
by the constellation Lyra, time honored
as an emblem Of union. The thirteen
stars of q new constellation were placed
ms the circumference of a circle, and on q
blue field, in accordance with the reso-
luton already given. That was the flag
used at Burgoyne's surrender, October
II, 1777. BY resolution of Congress,
passed january l3, 1874, to take effect
May |, l705, the flag was changed to ff-
teen stars and fifteen stripes. That
was the flag Of 1872. By resolution,
passed April 4, 1878, to take effect on the
following July 4th, the flag was again
changed to one Of thirteen stripes and
twenty stars and a new star to repre-
sent new State, ordered TO be placed on
the blue field on the 4th oil July follow
ing the admission of such State. The
flag planted on the National Palace in
Mexico had thirty stars. 1t now carries
thirtyseven."

REPUTATION.


The better Southern States, like Georgia, are
sadly disturbed between the growing outcry for
Reputation OF the carpet-bag debt and the larger
mercantile necessities of the States, which are ex-
pected to be supplied to some extent by the iedefai
government. The movement to build what may
be called the Southern Erie Canal is a favorite
thing in the Georgia mind. This canal is designed
to connect the Cumberland River and the Atlantic
in the region Of Savannah. In Georgia almost
everybody iavors 1t, except that extraordinary
dialectican, A. H. stephens, who is accused ofeyen
dlsdanng to take United States land scrip, because
the acceptance OF this gift would violate the prin
clple of State rights. 1t is great pity that
stephens did not plough himself under before
these latter days.


RAILROAD TYRANNY.


The stability of many spirited towns in the South
is subject to check because OF the arbitrary meth
ods OF our Northern railroad managers, who have
picked up the Southern highways and turned the
current OF population as they wist. For example,
what was called the Blue Mountain route between
New Orleans and the North, and had acquired
much celebrity, received an unannounced blow
two or three weeks ago from the Pennsylvania
management. Palace cars which had been put on
at New Orleans to run through to Lynchburg were
unceremoniously taken of and the quick connec-
tions broken up so that people had to ride around
by the Jackson route TO Louisville and Cincinnati
and be bothered between the greedy and un-
Sat roaa wch cross the snowy ou1 %
tains and have Just left number or
congressman day or two behind time. The
Pennsylvania Railroad seems to have carried
everything before 1t in the Southern region. and it
will soon control both the seaboard line and the
Danville line Oh the East as well as the Cincinnati
line southwark in the West. All that the enter
prise OF the southern States can do is to build
pieces OF road which the big corporations come
along and gObbe up or worry them until, In self
defence, the road built at the expense OF the Com
monwealth bonds is surrendered to the master Of
which, long ago, did the great business OF the
southwest, is now cut OF In Mid Virginia, while
been tapped below its point OF junction with the
southwestern system, and its future probabilities
are not considerable, Il Is marvel that with the
men of actual capital are competing for their man.
agemcnt. The South has built an enormous guam
tity of road during the last fifteen years. but the
great majority it is merely tributary to Northern
adventurers, who are accused in the South of hav-
ing ilred the Northern mind with statements of the
disloyalty Of the Southern population, while they
in the meantime gobbled up the impoverished rail
roads and constructed their own systems to bur-





SOUTH CAROLINA THE WORST OFF.

TEXAS IMMIGRATION.


Texas Is the only State In all the South which is
receiving steady and reliable class OF immigrants.
or these very small portion comes from Europe
and the rest Is nearly equally divided between the
Northwest and the Gulf slave States. The
great wave or Southern immigration toward Texas
starts in North Carolina, although some Vrglnians
from the bottom OF the great valley and from
the Danvie country have taken up the same line
OF march. From both Carolinas the impulsion has
been remarkable, and when the traveller reaches
Georgia and Alabama he finds marvellous move

One OF the most nendsh and brutal outrages re-
corded in the annals OF crime was expiated on the
scaIold here to-day in the person OF negro.
Since their emancipation the morals and virtues
OF that race, as compared with the time they were
In bondage, have retrograded to an extent that il
startling, and the question arises, has not civza
tiOn rather served to develop their worst instincts
and increase crime among them than to elevate
and promote higher degree Of m0ralsa


Thomas Johnson, the negro executed here to-
day, paid the legal penalty for the terrible
crime Of outrage committed upon the person
of highly respectable white lady, resident OF
this county, aged sixty-rwo years. This was the
first execution that has occurred here in long Sc
res OF years, and this added to the popular indig
nation against the prisoner, caused u large crowd
to assemble and lively interest to be manifested
In this sad termination OF human life.


HISTORY OF THE CRIME.


On the morning OF the 10th September 1871,
there suddenly appeared IN this village q strange
ana rather mysterious negro, who had come
from the direction OF Salisbury. and carried
in his hand that popular Southern arti-
cle-a carpet-bag, and had sung across his
shoulder shotgun, and from his weary and hungry
appearance his dusty boOts into which his pants
*,
was evident he had travelled considerable distance
on foot The stranger attracted the attention of
large numbers OF his sable brethren, all of whom
observed him from respectful distance both from
q certain bravado and repulsve air which he wore,
and also from his fierce and bandt-like armament
and costume. He paid little attention to either
their observations or remarks, and after purchas-
ing at convenient store can OF preserved oys-
ters, which he voraci0usy devOured, and bantering
for while such Of the negro loiterers he found
willing to exchange word with him in
the streets, he took his departure on the
track of the North Carolina Railroad, in
the direction OF Greensboro. Walking lesurely
on this beautiful morning, in less than two hours
he reached point eight and half miles from here
and one and q half from Thomasvile, the next sta
tion on the railroad Here he met the track, CON-
Ing in the opposite direction elderly white lady
and whose aged appearance and feeble condition
at once proclaimed her to be three years
old. Johnson passed, eyeing her intently. She
had been to the village Of Thomasvie to make
some purchases, and at this time now the after
noon, returning to her home. After she had passed
Johnson, walking at moderately quick pace, she
suddenly heard footsteps close behind her, which
startled her. and upon turning to see who it could
be, she was


VIOLENTLY SEIZED AND ROUGHLY DRAGGED


from the railroad track into the woods. The vii
lain did not say anything to her, but, in order to
prevent any outcry he ch0ked her with his hand
on ler threat NqtYlshstana!Ig tliis she struggled
inhuman monster, fearing that she might possibly
succeed in giving the alarm, gagged her with
large spike. He then, after throwing hls unior
tunate victim to the ground, accomplished his
purpose, and, leaving her with torn clothes bleed
Ing from wounds, bruised and more dead than
alive went as before upon the railroad track in
the direction of Greensboro. During his stay at
Thomasville his strange manner aud excited ap-
pearance, as II he dreaded to encounter the gaze
gun he carried attracted the attention of several
citizens many OF whom remarked that there
seemed ""t0 be something wrong about HIM.


THE BRUTAL DEED


was committed not far from the residence OF the
victim, and as soon as she recovered her con-
sciousness and sufficient strength she retraced her
steps home. 1t was with the utmost difficulty,
when she arrived there, owing to her extreme
fright and terrible suffering condition, that she
could find utterance to communicate the fearful
tale Of her outrage to her nephew, whom she for.
tunately found at the house. The nephew started
brownsville he related the facts OF the case to Mr..
w. T. Moore, whOimmedlately collected crowd OF
the now ynso
were divided into squads, and nrst they
secured the woods and surrounding country,
! thinking the negro was still lurking somewhere In
the neignborh0Od OF his crime. This search lasted
until late that night but neither OF the parties dis
again renewed the pursuit. and, taking the track
oi the railroad, they succeeded in tracing Johnson
distance OF about thirty t11,tyra miles ess ana


within four miles OF Greensboro, still on the rail-


road track. lie was greatly terrified when taken
into custody, and Obstinately denied all knowledge
OF the brutal outrage he had committed. He said
he formerly belonged to Cyrus p. Member
ing ma,'' to revisit ''e' the old ID familiar scenes
where the days OF his boyhood were
passed. He was brought back here, however, and
upon his arrival was identified by his victim and
by several other persons who, on the afternoon had
passed and met him on the railroad track near the
scene OF the outrage The news or the shocking
crime had such an effect upon even the negroes
along the route OF the return that they followed
hlm In crowds and evinced strong desire, both by
threats and observations, OF lynching johnson,
and il was with some dif1culty that they could be
| restrained from taking the prisoner from the
OF the lady was at that time very precarious, the
severe choking having nearly ended her life,
and her extreme s,,, age rendered iids her recoy.
the magistrate, the Jail here being deemed inse-
| cure, the prisoner was removed to salisbury for
sale keeping and to be held for trial. At the en-
! suing October term OF the Superior Court he was
! arragned for trial before Judge Cloud. Upon afil-
/ davt OF want OF Witnesses the case was continued
| till the Spring term OF the Court. IL was
/ opened, the court room being crowded to sufIoca-
ton ny large and deeply interested throng OF
4 spectators, and never In the history OF criminal
/ jurisprudence was more positive aud convincing
| evidence adduced. That OF the aged victim caused
great emotion among the audience. Her neat and
| ladylike appearance, her age and trembling
| voice while on the stand aroused an intense inter.
est in her behalf She fully identified tue prisoner
AS the villain who had SO louly GU ragged her. The
! prisoner, although deiended by able counsel, was
/ convicted by the jury and


l. SENTENCED TO ne HANGED.


From this sentence the prisoner made an appeal to
/ higher Court, on grounds which were considered
altogether too insufficient, but 1t was granted in
| order to satisfy the condemned man ttlat justice
had been done him. The cause was then taken to
| the highest tribunal in the State-the Supreme
! Court-and the Judgment OF the Superior
| Court was affirmed. While the cause was
| under consideration In the Supreme Court,
the prisoner being In jail here he very nearly sue
ceeded In escaping by cutting through the walls OF
| the Jail with chise. This effort was discovered
by the jail officials in time to prevent Johns0ns exit
through hole ingeniousy made ior that purpose,
and through which number OF other prisoners
would have escaped. The hole had In the begin
ming, been cut through the floor to lower story,
thence TO a chimney where the brickwork was only
matter to gain access to the outer world. just at
the time that the project was about completed n
deputy taller accdently saw the aperture and thus
the h0nea Of the criminal for liberty were frus."

Of this committee that it came into existence be-
| cause sOf a suggestion OF mine. There was no

of that action. These public institutions would do
well to investigate themselves, so that knowing
intimately all that goes on in every branch they
may fearlessy await whatever investigation may
be made OF their affairs, and be prepared TO subject
themselves TO the judgment of the people, II there
Is anything wrong we want 1t righted, and win be-
most pleased II this necessity does not exist.""

even more fiagrantly than on last Monday, and the
patience OF the committee under the infection Of
his selfstultifying explanations was simply won
derful. He wrthed and perspired under the tor

The outrage by the nurse, Cavanagh, upon the
woman who was senceinte was not further discussed
and 1t seems that it's full details not to be-
reached II, as announced, the evidence isa

didn't have wine for his dinner To-day nOr did l,.s

He still tells fabulous stories OF his wealth. He
says he gave Miss Mapes diamond ring wOrils
$500. we have seen 1t, and II is worth about ono
dollar and fifty cents. 1t looks as If the Mrs. MOritz
previously referred to was the medium through
which Mr.. Mapes' daughter became acqnainteh
with Tension. Mr.. Spauding, writing from De-


~ will soon show you Tension did not dare 10
speak TO Miss Mapes in the car on her mothers
account, but slipped note into Mrs. Mornx's
introduction. Mrs. M0ritz thinking it romantic
thing to have this fellow fall In love and marry
""Mame,n as she called her, helped the matter on.
In one OF her letters to Tension she said she was
riage proved good one and she had no reason
to doubt but what ''Mamlcs' would prove
the same. Mrs. Tension this Detroit wife,
wrote Miss Mapes from Toronto saying shc was
TENSIONS wife, but this rascal makes Miss Mapes
believe IL 0 story gotten up to injure him. Miss
Mapes IN letter to Tension said Mrs. Moritz made
her SIT down IN her presence and write TO Tension
aud enclose him Mrs. Tenison's letter and then
made her promise her mrs. MOritz) that she Miss
Mapesl would have nothing more to do with Teni-

then the correspondence between Miss Mapcs and

Of the crime that he did not know wha, to Do
and said to the qucsiioasr ''you never had dead
Niger on your hands and don't know wha, you
wsuld have done under the circumstances""


Two theories Of the cause for committing the
crime prevail Ht Dover. One Is that West, whos'
life was Insured for Sc5, 900, conceived the idea
Of killing the negro and disHguring the remains
so that they might be takan for his own, he dis
appearing; that the Insurance Company would pa,
over the amour, TO his wife, and that she would
afterwards join hin, and they would live upon
the ili-gotien wealth. The other and NOR,
plausible is that wss, cniiced the negro to in
hale the gas with which he was experimenting
which had different effect from what he ex
pcc,ed and killed the negro.


West Is young man Of about 30 years Of age
He is = native Of baltimore Hundred Ia SUISSE,

number OF years. lie graduated at Dickinson
College, Carlisle, IA. In 1868. OF late he hai
been experimenting with gas which he claim
people suppose, injured his brain, and ,ha, h
had become insane. Hence the commission o
the horrible deed, and the Singular manner ID
which he acted afterwards.

Is fast approaching. Three thousand people at
tended service in the Temple on Fifth avenue, one
thousand five hundred in the Lexington avenue,
Norfolk and Thirty-ninth street Temples, thou
sand in the Thrtytourth, Forty-fourth Clinton and
Nineteenth, and hardly smaller numbers In the
other regular synagogues. Fully fifty thousand
Jews united In worship on Saturday ast-Yom KiD-
pen-ffty thousand voices at sundown proclaimed
Israel's watchwOrd. Quite respectable Jewisk
population; but strange to say adds the Jet0ish
Messenger, not one-tenth properly observe the Sab
bath. The Temple Adas Jeshurun made O COlec-
tion last week In aid OF the Roumanians. Quite a
large sum was received. The other congregations
will soon be called upon for a similar purpose."

place numbering $50 members, and including one
OF the representatives from the town. In every
town In the eastern section Of the State there are
Greeley republicans, and In Windham county they
are estimated to number from 400 TO 700. Accord
ing to present appearances 5000 majority for Gree

At the Greeley Republican Conference in Boston

Says the Bridgeport Comm Farmer tGreeley

To compare Greeley and Grant in intellectually
or morality is to draw parallel between noun
tain and mole hill, giant and ptgmy. We know
no democrats who object to Greeley In any appre-
hension Of ""worse condition Of affairs"" 1t is his
record as against them and their principles which
sticks In the democratic throat. Between Grant
and Greeley democrats OF the most Bourbon stripe
cannot hesitate.

Detroit Free Press (anti-Greeey democrat) to cast
Off its opposition to the Philosopher of Chappaqua,

Free Press has never been very ferocl0us in its op

in its advocacy of Greeley. 1t says:-


Let us help with will to place man in author

people Of the South. From the land OF ""cinnamon
seed and cotton"" comes great cry to our people
OF ""My Maryland'' to help them in this the hour Of
their peril and need to rid their land and their
homes from the iron heel OF military law and war.
The Knoxville Tenn.) Press (Greeley dem0crat
remarks that ''the Grant press affects to be hor.
rlned at the willingness Of Horace Greeley to re-
ceve the hearty support OF the scores OF promi-
nent Southerners who have hitherto opposed him
and are now working for him. The organs would
be only too glad to chronicle the adhesion to Grant
or any one of his old opponents, but they don't
have the chance. The grapes are very sour""


Says the Utica IN. ~ Observer Greeley demo-
craft -


1t is seemingly certain now that the Baltimore
Convention will simply reflect and record the will
OF the people by endorsing and adopting the Gin
cinnati candidates-H0race Greeley and Gratz
Brown. We know we speak the sentiment OF al

we say that no other action would be acceptable.


The Dover IN. H. Gazette Greeley democrat)
says the movement In favor OF Greeley does not
arise from the schemes and wire-pulllng Of poti-

and length Of its Streets which, in an area of some

This was more than Jersey patience could stand.

the eliminating point OF the Commissioners in

Stabbed-Thc Murderer I'm Custody.


Three years ago young Italian shoemaker,
named Giovanni Borr0tti, made his way to Dover,
N. j., and after working for some time as Journey
man opened little shop of his own. Four months
ago he brought from New York woman named
Johanna Moosi, about twenty four years OF age,
whom he termed his housekeeper. The two lived
in the shop where he worked sleeping under the
counter, and were known as inofensve, quiet peo-
pie, Borrotti being sober, Industrious and an ex-
cellent workman.


Yesterday morning two Italians entered Dover
by the early train, and learned the way to
Borr0tti's shop On entering one of the Italians at
once claimed the woman Moosi as his wife, and
demanded that she should return to New York with
him. The woman refused, saying that he had Ill
treated her, and she would not live with him. He
then

with him and she complied. They conversed
quietly for some minutes without seeming to dis.
pute and several who were near say they had nc
quarrel. On re-entering, however, the woman re-
lterated her intention OF never again living with
her husband, upon which BOrr0tti, who was seated
on his low bench, interpOsed and told the husband
that If he would leave the woman for few days in
Dover he (BorrottD would bring her to New York
next week and the husband could then claim her.
Just then some customers came In and no disturb
had they left, however, when the woman again said
nothing should persuade her to live again with her
husband and before she had completed the sen-
tence the husband, drawing long knife,

Italians attempted TO escape Borrotti seized the
murderer and called for help. Before it could
arrive the murderer plunged the knife twice into
the abdomen OF BOrr0tti and endeavOred to loosen
his hold BY this time help had arrived and the
murderer, with his friend, who had been sitting
quietly in the shop and who interered either
way was taken into custody. The knife was found
across the street. where 1t had been thrown by the
murderer. 1t had been originally common

appointed By the proper autho critics,
and hence this suit was brought in the

 ernment to punish them for so doing, and.

 wholesale murderer as they are, their pun

 ishment has been light

 Here, then, Is ''the best Government the

 world ever saw,"" setting a very bad example

 to its citizens; an example which, one way and another, has made murderers of several of said citizens; aye, unpunished murderers at that, for owing to variety of causes it Is rarely that man forfsits his life for having wilfully, deliberately, and mallciously taken the life of his fellow creature.

 Throughout the West and South wherever there is danger from Indians and Mcxicans,

 Americans generally go armed to the teeth. in order to be ready at any moment to de- fend their lives and property against attacks from the enemies we have named.

 But, and We grieve to say it, the weapons carried by our countrymen are frequently used for the slaughter of one another. For instance, difference arises between two cit izens, warm words pass from one to another, pistols are drawn, and down goes one of the unfortuuates.

 Now, for the survivor in combat like the foregoing, we have great sympathy, pity, or whatever feeling you call it.; for his rash act was done in the heat of passion, with death staring him in the face, and. perhaps would never have been done had his Government relieved him of the necessity of carrying weapons to protect himself from his natural enemies.

 But, for the black hearted, cowardly fierd, who, after nursing his hatred of fellow being, and taunting him until he gets the

 drop"" on him; then shoots or stabs him to death, we never have had and never can have any sympathy.

 Of this latter kind of murder-if there be different kinds-our poor Territory has to answer for several, while the real authors are as free as before they committed their hellish acts, s,-unless, indeed, they have consciences and are troubled with remorsc,-all of which we very much doubt.

 For the escape of the latter class of rufli- ans, the law of the Territory is slightly to blame; the good citizens thereof great deal more; for seldom is it that good men can be procured for jury duty, and in this way, criminals of the worst sort have gone unhung.

 Now. no rope has been used; yet we are told that criminals are approaching the end of their rope. How2 Why2 We'll, says one of the three newspapers of the Terri tory

 'Fellow-citizens of Yuma county, the hour | has come for action. The courts have failed ! us; juries have failed us, and crime of the l most rcvolting character holds high caruiv.J . all around us.

The persuasive argument of few feet of rope will do more to stop thiS law less conduct that all the slow moving bodies of courts in Christendom. Let an organiza- ton for protection be formed at once""

 This means Lynch Law. ""code"" the . very name of which is abhorred by all en- frightened people.

 Another of our contempornries despaiFs of ! justice being done by courts and juries, and, l no doubt, would not object to seeing little of Judge Lynch.

 Now, to be candid, the MINER once favored | this unbridled license of the people the oc- casion when it did so was pregnant with the blood of two harmless women, who were murdered by two scoundrelly villains in this town, one of whom, we see, has just been turned loose by the proper authorities, in Arizona City. 1

 But, the past is past. The records of all new States and Territories are stained with blood; the clots are no thicker here than they are elsewhere, if we leave out the pools made by Indians.

 So far, not case of lynch law is cbarga- | ble to our Territory. We have courts in full operation good men must be procured to try criminals the landmarks of the law | must be kept steadily in view: its penalties must be enforced, and to this end should | Press, Pulpit, School and Public Opinion 1 labor to regenerate the Territory, rather than by appeals to an enforcement of mob law. |"

POPULAR RIGHTS.


The ""popular branch"" threw up their heads |
Of tho Senate amendments to their bill placing |
taa and coffee on the free list when those
amendments were sent to the House for con-
currence, and upset the whole thing by passing
the following resolutions: .eas.sg.sss 80


Resolyed That the satisfactorily the Senate,
under the form of an amendment, for the bill
of the House III. r. No. 1887 entitled San act
to repeal existing duties on tea and coffee"" of
a bill entitled ""An act to reduce existing tax
es,"" containing general revision, reduction,
and repeal of laws imposing import duties and
internal taxes, is in conflict with the true in
tent and purpose of that clause of the Constitu-
ton which requires that ""all bills for raising
revenue shall originate in the House of Repre-
sentatives;"" and that therefore said substitute
for House bill No 1857 do lie upon the table.


1fld be it further resolved, That the Clerk of
the House be, and is hereby directed to notify
the Senate of the passage of the foregoing reso-
luton. Aa


/ This kills the bill, and the duties are notre-
pealed as stated in my last letter, although the
bill to that effect passed both Houses 1t will
probably be presented anew before adjourn
ment as a majority of both houses are in favor
of the repeal Quite spirited debate attended
the passage of these resolutisns-in which Mes
srs. Dawes, Garfield, Butler, Hale, Wood and
several others took part The vote was 153 to

THE DETAILS OF THE HOUSE TARIFF BILL.
The Ways and Means Commits will, it is
thought without doubt, report their Revenue
Bill before the close of next week. 1t will en-
brace in one act all the proposed reductionsin
the Internal Revenue taxes and the Tariff. In
the latter the reduction will be quite considera-
BILE on all products of iron, wool and cotton,
probably averaging fifteen per cent But it
must be remembered that considerable Tariff
Duty was added to offset and compensate for
| the Internal tax that was laid on Manufactures
| in 1862 and 1868, and since the Internal tax was
removed there has beeu no reduction in the
Tariff. This adjustment will now be made
with possibly shade taken off from some du-
ties that are extra high. Pig iron viii be re-
duced one dollar, leaving the duty at six dol
lars per ton. Steel rails will be proportionally
| reduced. se4a ""a Hee s53
In the Internal Revenue Department pretty
much every tax will be removed except those
| on whiskey, tobacco, stamps and the tax on ma
| tional banks. The whiskey. taxes will be con-
solidated in one uniform tax of about 65 or 20
| cents per gallon; tobacco will be made uniform
| at 20 cents per pound. The income tax for
1871 will be collected, but as the present Law
| expires by its own limitation, the tax will not
be renewed SO that all who have been annoyed
by the inquisit0ral features of this tax will be
rejoiced at their permanent release in the fu-
ture. The outlines have given relate to the
bill as it will be reported from the Committee
on Ways and Means What may be done with
it in the committee of the whole House is, as
Lord Dundreary would say s'What no fellow
can find Out"" and you will therefore excuse me
from predictions or opinions relating thereto
1t is hoped that some provision for the relief
of the shipping interest will be incorporated in
the Tariff Bill. Messrs.


BLAINE, LYNCH AND HALE
| made arguments before the Ways and Means
Committee few days since urging that
policy and there is good reason for hoping that
the relief asked for will be incorporated in the
permanent Revenue Laws of the country where
1t would not be subject to annual agitation, and
the hazards of frequent test votes in Congress,
to say nothing of the log-rolling of other inter-
| ests g.s


THE GARULOUs CHAMBURN.
Since ] have already introduced the Marquis
de Chamburn to the readers of the PRESS per-
haps they may desire to hear from that Illus.
trious gentleman once more. 1t will he recol
lected that Senator Sumner in his testimony
before the Arms Investigation Committee paid
very high tribute to this distinguished (now
nearly ea-tinguished) foreigner, and spoke en-
Enthusiastically of his superior knowledge of the
affairs of our country; but the testimony of
G. X. Garrison, General Ingalls, and Mr.. Peck
has proved beyond doubt that he is not suff-
GENTLY well versed in our language to speak
the truth in English, even under oath-whether
he can do SO in French or not will probably
never be known in this country. His whole
sale charges against Gen. ingalls, were denounc.
ed by that gentleman as unqualfedly false,
which denunciations were virtually admitted
hu that willy specimen of the polite frog-eater.
AFTER Y. K Harrison had testified to the false
hood of the statements OF tire marquis that he
Garrison, was of the sureties of w. NJ. Tweed
the former acknowledged his error, but saidin
extenuation that he had readit in a New York
paper, thus showing that he had based has scorn
testimony on the same foundation upon schich
acas based the original Preamble of Mr. Sumner
utz; false statement found IN q newspaper
Bear in mind, if you please, that this same
Marquis de Chambrun is the instigator and
prime mover in the Arms Investigation which
has already cost the people of this country so
much money, and judge for yourselves whether
those who aid him in this contemplate scheme
are true reformers or not. 1t is expected that
the testimony to be introduced early next week
will prove the most interesting yet given, as it
will show some of the inside workings of the
original conspiracy. FETn r.


1t is not hard to understand why


SENATOR scHURz DECLINES


to disclose the names of his informers in the
Arms matter. Several witnesses, whose names
he has given to the committee and who are
presumed to be the same to which he SO often
referred with such an air of profound mystery,
during the debate, and the early part of the
investigation, have appeared and testified
They are generally -


ENTIRELY IGNORANT ~,


of any facts whatever in the case; and every
one who has been able to display any knowl-
edge on the subject testifies to having had re-
cent interviews with the


MARQUIS DE CHAMBRUN,


in relation to their testimony and even then
there is nothing that can give any consolation
to the sorrowing progenitors of the Arms In
vestigation. There has been mistake some
where that places them very much in the ""a


POSITION OF THE HEROINE
of the following little anecdote of which l am
forcibly reminded


A girl, evidently servant, rushed breath
lessly into drug store, threw down quarter
and hurriedly inquired of the clerk in attend
ance if he could SO disguise dose of castor oil
that the taste could not be detected. He an
swered that he could and asked her if she was
fond of soda, and receiving reply in the af-
frmative, proceeded to prepare the medicine
as ordered, compounding it with glass Of that
sarTa8 DELIGHTFUL BEVERAGE, R


which he handed to his fair customer who
drank IL with much apparent satisfaction. To
the surprise of the clerk, however, the girl did
not leave at once as he had very naturally ex-
pected, but remained standing by the counter
evidently waiting for some further attention,
SO he blandly inquired:


WHAT ELSE 1nss?""


81 am waiting for that OIL"" she replied some
what pettishly. 'You have taken it."" said the
astonished clerk.

The Long Island Railroad ""AccideaAt.""
1t would seem that our American railroads
intend having every step in the way of guard
ing against the slaughter of the travelling
public written only in letters of blood
Our railroad companies, with very few excep-
tions, are achieving the reputation of being
the worst managed and most reckless
of any in the world. Accidents, as they are
termed, occur in other countries on railroad
lines, and lives are sacrificed to the stoker-
demon abroad as well as at home But our
fatal superiority is undoubted. not only in
wholesale collisions where scores are killed, but
scarce day passes that some smash-up is not
reported, wherein if human lives be not taken
those OF cattle are and other property in large
amounts is destroyed The blame is shifted
from one official to another and, after it has
gone the round, the public is informed that
nobody is in fault. It is high time
that the loosely-drawn, little-respected
rules which govern traffic on our
lines should be exchanged for something more
Ineligible, and the tremendous responsibility
entrusted to more intelligent heads and careful
hands. The collision near Hibbard's Head,
on the South Side Railroad, exposes
number of the faults of our slipshod
system. To begin with, it is an instance
of the ever-present danger which hangs
over the line which is in whole or part COM
posed Of 'tsingle track"" The conductor, en-
gineer and passengers can never be certain that
train coming along at twenty or thirty miles
an hour is not approaching them. Certain reg
ulations are made which have no absoluteness,
to men who have ceased to reflect upon per-
sonal danger. In this instance the incoming
train, after waiting the allotted period, moved
off the double track on to the single track
The outgoing train, knowing that it was be-
hindhand, believed it could catch up the lost
seconds and SO save necessary delay. The
result was that the latter train ran into the
first which had come to standstill, and two
lives have been already sacrificed thereby


Now, we find on examining the running reg
ulations that trains in certain direction are
obliged to wait certain time for other trains
that, if the other train does not then arrive, it
may go ahead, and the curious clause is intro
duced that it then becomes the duty of the
other train to ""get out of the way""
How this cannot occasionally be done on a
single track the late accident painfully shows.
Conductor Lynch had waited his full time,
and Conductor Rathburn thought he would
''get out Of the way"" by running past
Conductor Lynch. The folly and alb
surdity of such thing, being
matter of everyday occurrence, is some
thing startling. Conductors may not all be SO
reckless as Rathburn, but the fact that lives
depend absolutely and habitually on the
capricious judgment of such man is some
thing to startle the reader Here are two
great stupidities of our want of system
made apparent-the large use of
single track and the dependence for o
safety from casualty on such things as
conductors and their variable watches The
single track SHOULD not be allowed to exist
while leais..aation can compel the construction
of double one In any case the rule for the
passage of trains should be abso!pts--that is,
in no '-e case should one train leave the side
switch until the train due has actually arrived.
The present catastrophe points the danger of
the haphazard slime allowance""


There are railroad accidents, of course
purely such, which, it might be said, are i'm
possible to foresee; but the majority of cases
prove criminal negligence or want of common
foresight as the cause. Bridges are left open
and the unwarned train plunges to destruction
into a river; freight train is left
standing on the line and an express train
runs into it. But there are other de-
fects in the system which demand q remedy
The passage of express trains at full speed
through the centre of towns and villages is q
constant source of danger and death. There
is no fencing, no gate, no watchman, to warn
the citizens of the approaching monster The
bell, to be sure, is rung, and the whistle
sounded, but at twenty-five miles an
hour the warning comes but little ahead
of the danger. Our companies need more
carefulness and skill in their running
of trains, which might be made an exact
science, but is at present headless conglome-
rate Of old stupidities, rash calculations and
general makeshift. The excuse of Conductor
Rathburn for his fatal rashness will point this
charge: A new set of rules for the Fourth of
July had been issued, and he had no time to
read them

BILLS INTRODUCED.","BILLS INTRODUCED


Bills were introduced and referred as f0llows:-
BY Mr. WHEELER, rep.) OF N. Y.-At request, TO
incorporate a banking association, with a capital
OF 800, 900 600, under the style of 1.-The Governor
and Managers OF the Exchequer OF the United
States OF America


By Mr.. l.. MYERS Uep.l OF fPa.-Giving the widow
Of General Meade pension of $4,000 year.


BY Mr.. HARRIS, tdem) OF va.-To amend the
Tariff act. SO to permit farmers and planters to
sell leaf tobacco without restrictions and to modify
the law imposing tax on retail dealers in leaf
BY MI. TArrE, rep.) OF Neb.-To sell certain
public lands to the Republican Valley Railroad
Company.


Mr.. DAWES, Uep.) OF Mass, from the Committee
on Ways and Means, reported bill for the relief
OF sufferers by fire in Boston, allowing drawback
on all materials imported into the port and district
OF Boston and Charleston to be used and actually
used in the construction and completion OF build
lngs erected on the sites OF buildings destroyed IN
the fire OF the 9th and 10th or November last such
drawback to be also allowed on imported goods In
warehouse on the day that the act goes into effect
the act to be in operation for one year. He briefly
explained and advocated the bill, stating that u
corresponded with the like bill for Chicago last
session, save that IL did not as that bill did, except
lumber.


Mr.. PETERS (rep.l OF Ne, remarked that, al
though the district he represented would suffer by
rhe admission OF lumber Tree OF dnty, and although
the city of Bangor in his district, lost through its
insurance companies, more in proportion than
Boston did, he would not make any opposition TO
the bill.


Mf. CoSGER (rcp.) OF Mich, said that, following
the lead OF the gentleman from Maine tMr Peters,,
he would not antagonize the bill in the interest OF
the lumberproduclng States. Still, he thought
with the same propriety that manufactured goods,
such as are produced In Massachusetts,, might be
admitted free Of duty in Michigan.


Mr.. DAWES replied that the two eases were very
different in principle. The difference lay in the
misfortune which justified the bill.


The discussion was further continued by Messrs.
Lynch, OF Me-; Maynard, OF Tenn. Farnsworth,
OF ILL.,, and NfblaCk, Of Ind.


The bill was then passed unanimously.


Mr.. SARGENT, lrep.) OF Cal introduced bill to
amend the Internal Revenue laws by providing for
stamps for thirds, beer kegs


Mr.. PLATT, tfep.) OF Va, introduced q bill to
amend the Bankruptcy act.


The House then, at one O'Clock resumed the

The Bill to Increase the Navy.


Since the discussion on this bill day before yes
torday the interest in 1t has increased. More In
tegence has been brought TO bear on the question.
II WAS evident that members came in to-day,
Crammed and rammed to the muzzle with figures
about live oak and iron, navy yards and private
contracts Among those who took prominent parts
were Kerr, Coghlin, Potter, Randall Cox, Hale,
6cOneid, Garfield, Sheabarger, Lynch, Archer and
Beck. The question, rs stated by Mr. cox, WIS az
10 the mode OF building and the number TO be
built. Tho debate finally terminated on a vote as
10 the number Mr. Cox's motion prevailed to re-
duce the number from TO six, ana TO divide the
experiment, as he called IT, between the two
modes; three to be built at the navy yards and
three by private contract guarded by the amend
Ment Of Mr.. Randall as to models, commission,
&c., and further guarded by the amendment OF



Btruction should be made until full detailed cs,i-
9ates have been submitted to Congress and ap-
preparations made therefor These amendments,
added TO the original bill, together with Mr.. Hale's
amendment as amended by Mr. Cox, finally
passed 80 that the bill goes 10 the senate IN the
50rm below


bill to authorize the construction Of six steam
vessels OF war and for other purposes.


That the Secretary OF the Navy be authorized 10
construct SIX steam vessels OF war, each carry ing
len or more guns Of large calibre, the hnls to be
bnit OF iron or wood as the Secretary may decide;
and that So 000, 900 be appropriated for that pur-
pose out OF any money in the treasury hereafter
three OF said vessels shall be constructed In private
yards in the United States under contract,
n @ nc pans sa Se o
naval OF civil marine architects subject to public
competition and for suitable stipulated rewards
upon advcrtscment-all OF which shall be sub
mitted to q board OF not less than five naval oni-
GERS for approval and adoption, under the drec-
models, plans, specifications and estimates, which
may be combination Of the best features of any
all tho plans submitted, or any one OF them en-
tire, have been approved and adopted by the aore-
said board and approved by the Secretary, he may
proceed to contract, under proper advertisements,
for the construction OF the Aforesaid vessels with
the lowest and best bidder who Will give proper
securty for the faithful mlnlment OF the contract
In eacn case. The vessels to be built accord
ing to the models, plans, specifications and
estimates approved and adopted az hereinbefore
provided for; provided. tnat the cost shall not ex
board.


This result was finally obtained by the votes Of
many who voted against the various amendments.
In the finale even ScoHed, Hale, Cox and Randall
voted together for the six sloops three to be built
In the government yards and three by private
contract, according to the conditions of Randal's
and Garield's amendments The argume en,ation
BY which this result was reached was confirmed by
the good sense OF the House, on the motion OF Mr.
Cox TO reduce the number. He argued that il had
been confessed that private contracts were vicious
when unrestricted by legislation and quoted SEQ
neM and Coghiin to prove it: also that
1he navy yards were prodigal and waste
|fnl, and, he added. politically degenerate
and corrupt in their management, and he quoted
Mr.. Hale for part OF this statement. MI Cogh-

Mr. BECK, ,dem.) Of ky., stated his reasons for
opposing the bill Congress had appropriated an
nually for the last three years over twenty NIL
lions and yet the navy had no ships-no new ones.
They were all worthless, although twice as much
money was spent than was spent at a time when
the country had navy that was efficient. Where

Vermont that one vessel had been sold ior $4,000
which, alter getting one coat OF paint, was sold
again for $4,000 in the course of a week.


Mr.. KERR, tdeIn.) OF In,., advocated the post
ponement OF the bill on the ground that the House
was not IN possession OF such information as
would enable it to act inteligently on the subject.


THE REPORT or THE SECRETARY or TIE NAVY
was extremely ana dlsreputably devoid Oisuch

and intelligent information on the subject He

could be still more leduccd with advantage. The

Importance to the people OF the United states was
that Congress should 30 remodel and reform the

that there would be reflected the power OF great

The previous question was then seconded. after
which Mr.. Scoheid, who reported the bill, was en-
titled an hour to close the debate. lie YIELDED a
portion OF the time TO several members.


Mr.. ARCHER, tlem.) OF Nd, a member OF tho
Naval Committee, advocated the bill as matter OF
necessity, the navy of the United States being now
in q rotten ami ruinOus condition. He admitted
that there was nothing to be feared from the great
Powers; but the people whom IL was desired to I'M
press with the greatness OF this country were the
semi-civllized nations Of the world. IL was for
that object more than any other that these vessels
were required.


The discussion was further continued BY Messrs.
l.. Myers Lynch and Hale, the latter defending the
Navy Department from the aspersi0ns cast upon il.
Mr.. SC0FIELD, rep) or Pa, Chairman OF the
Naval Committee, closed the discussion. He al
vOcated the bill and opposed the amendment re-
quiring half the vessels to be built in private ship
yards. He stated that eight Of those vessels could
be put tomorrow in course or construction in the
navy yards-four OF wood and four OF iron. All OF
them could be constructed in the navy yards sooner
than they could be in private yards. The navy
yards had now all the machinery. ali the

Mr.. SHELLABARGER, repJ OF Ohio, favored the

the stand-That Little Bill of Ingcr-


sOlIs.


Yesterday afternoon the investigation into the
alleged frauds in the erection OF the Ninth judicial
District Court House resumed before the Senate
Committee, in the chamber OF the Board of Alder
men. Mr.. Fairchild, who sold the property to the
Court House Commission, was examined. From
this witness the Investigators hoped TO learn
thing particularly definite and important with ref
erence to the sale Of the lots on which the Court
house Is built, but nothing OF importance was
ehcited, save that he was the owner of the land
and that Winants acted as his agent


The first witness called was Mr. George Snyder
VINO, being sworn, deposed as follows:-I am a
lthographcr have been In that business for twenty
odd years. tfiere q bond OF the Ninth Judicial Dis
trict Court House handed to Mr. Snyder and
his opinion asked to what it would cost to prn
500 such b0nds In my estimation 1t would cost
$780, or at least that is what would charge for the
work; II did the work for stationers / would
charge much less.


Mr.. +. ii. Brown was next called His testimon
was In substance as follows:-I am a resident Of
Harlem, and was at one time the owner OF the prop
erty upon which now stands what Is known as the
Harlem Court House, situated between sixth and
Seventh avenues, in l2Sth street. sold the prop
erty for $4,000; the conveyance for the same
was signed by Albert l.: winants at the Office Of
Judge Porter; did not know that the Harlem Court
House was to be built there until some time alter
the deed had been given; received part OF the
money rom Judge Porter at his office.


Mr.. b. ?. Fairchild who sold the property 10 the
Commission through his nephew, Winants, was
ing the examination OF Mr.. Brown; bought the lots
in question from Mr.. Brown; did not hear amy talk
after he had contracted for their purchase; the first
mention OF the sale was made by me to Judge
nue.; knew him to be one OF the Commissioners, and
asked him where he was going to locate; he didl
not, not know; asked asked him If the present site
about where they would like to build; bought
these lots on speculation submitted them to the
commissioners; ,iid not know which one; thought
1t was Judge Porter received $24 900 for the prop
ery; Judge McQuade or Judge Porter received
none OF the $500 advance charged for the lots !:
all went to his private account; never shared the
profits OF sale with any one Commissioner; kept q
not he deposited the whole $4,000; had b ught
property for Mr.. Genet in the neighborhood Of
kln9s6ridge, but could not say whether he re-
ceycd all the money for 1t by check or cash;
this vas the first transaction he had ever had with
the city. anu he was sure IT would be the last.


John NJ. McQuade, the Police Justice OF the Ninth
District Court, and one OF the commissioners, next
gave his evidence. His eStimony was as fClows-
one OF the commissioners for the erection OF new
Court House; was appointed so by the Legislature;
of the Court House property; had no previous con-
versation about it further than what Mr.. Fairchid

some ten days before the property was
purchased from MI Fairchild, and at this confer
encc decided upon a site for the Court House re-
ceived no money from Mr.. Fairchild or through any
one else from him; | don't know how it was that
$4,000 was made the price OF the property, but
suppose that was what he asked; don't know any
thing about the oclOth that was paid for; don't

thing about the chairs; don't know anything about
the desks; don't know anything about the book

but never saw the goods; my signature came

There have been no arrests made, but suspicion
points strongly 10 Harry Hitchcock, a young
man wh0 i0rtnerly lived In this town. aud who
for some months resided In Mr.. Lyncl,'s family.

Peseh Prospects,.


Although some few orchards In this section are

injury there will be large yield. From news.

will not be . full crop In the lower ,mrt Of the

ease last year, will have a large proportion OF
the crop.


The Sussex Journal says Ill Il evident that
ihe crop 0f peaches In SUSSEX Co. this year will
be very light, last year there was mn unusually
heavy yield, and this 10 not the bearing year.
BESIDES II 10 true, that the bitter cold weather

our fellow citizens upon the unexampled prosper
ty of the country aud upon the encouraging
| prospects of the great party whose patriotism
and valor saved the country from disruption,
whose fidelity has enabled the nation to agarner
the fruits of its great triumph, and whose states


manship has done so much to repair the disas-


ters, material and moral which great war


involves.


Resoloed, That this administration has


justified the confidence of the people who placed


it in power that it has been true to every


pledge of its platform has restored peace and


harmony has consummated a complete recon-


struction, until every State now answers to the
| roll call in Congress has diminished the public


debt three hundred millions of dollars, with al


animal decrease of the interest charge of twenty
two millions, and funded large portion Of the
| remainder at a lower rate. while at the SAINT


time it has reduced taxation to the amount OF
| two hundred millions per annum ; 1t has main


tanned peace with foreign powers amid comph


cations of the gravest character, and preserved


the honor and dignity of the nation inviolate ant

most unjustifable and malignant, with stead


ness of purpose and selt-sacrliicing deYotlo
= to principle, worthy the admiration and endorse
L ment of the American people.

Mr.. BANKS denied that he had ever sympathizcd

O., for the murder of his wife on the 14th of May last. There had been trouble be- tween them resulting from jealousy, which was followed by separation. But at the time of the deed they were living together with their two children. Jen- kins's wife was sound asleep at four o'clock in the morning when her hus- band assaulted her with butchers cleaver, almost instantly killing her. The little children sleeping with her alone gave the alarm, and Jenkins es- capped. Jenkins's brother went up stairs and found the dead body of tLe woman lying on the bed, her head and face mangled almost beyond recognition the bed, clothing, and floor were soaked with blood and spattered with brains, and at the foot of the bed lay the cleaver, bearing crimson evidence that with it police were summoned, and mob col. lected about the house of such humor that the murderer would Fperhaps have been lynched had he fallen into their hands. After the inquest Jenkins was arrested and charged with the crime. On the 27th of June the Grand Jury pre- sented true bill against him, and on the Sd of October his trial was begun. It lasted but day and the prisoner was brought in guilty and sentenced by Judge Humphreys to be hanged. Jen- kins was light mulatto, and not par ticularly ill-looking. During his i'm prisonment his conduct was so exemplary as to warrant the remark from his iailers that he was the best-conducted prisoner they had ever had. He conversed fre- quently and long with spiritual advisers, and was, as he said, ready and willing te die. In the manner of such men, he kindly ""forgave"" judge, jury, and wit nesses who had been instrumental in bringing him to justice. When Judge Humphreys sentenced him, he also ad- monished him to hope for no pardon, communication of sentence, or reprieve i; he expected no leniency, and smiled at death as those are said to do who perish in the consciousness of having passed life of good deeds. He has frequently been visited by his mother, his niece, and two children, of whom he was very fond. Before going to bed on the last night he conversed pleasantly, and then slept s'calmly as child, and undisturbed by thoughts of his coming execution. Jenkins resolutely met his fate. At the conclusion of the reading of the death warrant by the warden, Jenkins said

 We'll, MT. Crocker, it is your duty. Gods will be done, and soon shall be with Christ.''

 General Crocker-Well, Jenkins, it affords us all consolation that you are prepared to meet your Lord.

 Jenkins (emphatically) sure as the deed is done my soul will wait to glory. I'm prepared to meet my God, thanks be to his holy name. I know that he has crown prepared for me, and shaR soon wear it. My respects to your officers. Yoa have treated me kindly. All I can say to you is, continue in the path of virtue and I'll meet you.

 His brother had entered the room while the death-warrant was being read, and stood with his head bowed, in one corner of the room, and as Jenkins fin lshed the above remarks he took him by the hand, and throwing one arm about his neck said, while the tears were stream ing down his cheeks,

 o God. here is my brother. I have done all I could for him now I leave him to thee.""

 The brother then retired, with tears trickling down his cheeks. Jenkins then bld each one in the room goodbye, call ing all by name, saying to them: ""There's crown that awaits us in glory. Press on. We will soon meet where there is no trouble. Glory to God. I'm going home."" Having bid adieu to each one guard advanced and commenced to pinion his arms, and while doing so Jenkins jumped up, exclaiming. ""Oh, I'll soon put on my crown. All things to hope, nothing to fear""

 There were few dry eyes among the spectators. The procession walked out of the jail, the warden and deputy in advance, then two guards, then the pris- oner, with a guard on either side, Jen- kins walking with firm step, and the colored ministers following him. He walked with firm tread up to the steps, and immediately took his position be- meath the fatal moose. The officers and ministers took their positions near the railing, and Rev. MT. Draper lined out the hymn sfFather, I stretch my hands to thee"" which was sung by the minis ters and others, Jenkins leading off and singing with a clear voice. Rev. Mir. Johnson offered Q prayer, which, owing to the noise and confusion sf the crowds on the outside of the walls, could not be heard by the spectators. He prayed God to receive Jenkins's soul as it crossed the shadow. On rising from their knees, the ministers bade the unfortunate man goodbye, and turned their heads Jen- kins then with loud voice exclaimed "" Farewell, world farewell, friendsI ] am going to live with Jes11s and all I can say IS, follow me. Hallelujah.""

 His legs had been tied while this was being said, and the black cap having been produced, the guards taking him by the hand, he said to them "" Good. bye; want to see you in paradise""

 To General Crocker he said: "" I thank you for your kindness. I'm going tc Jesus in glory. Will you meet me there ? To James Nelson, the colored cook, he said : ""Jim, I wish you well, and hope to meet you in heaven. God bless yor all, and I hope to meet you all 1T heaven""

 The black cap was then drawn over hi! face, and the signal was given, the tray fell with plunge, and Jenkins wa launched into eternity. The shoulder! gave two or three shrugs and the leg quivered few moments.

 There are eight persons in the jai who have been indicted for murder il the first degree, and one under sentenc, to be hung.

City Council was held last evening.


In Board of Mayor and Aldermen papers from
the Common Council were disposed of in con-
currence


The petition of H. A. Lamb for permission
to erect three story wooden dwelling house on
the north side of Congress street, opposite Lin
coin Park, was referred to the Committee OH
Wooden Buildings, with power.


The Aldermen then went into joint Conven-
tion with the Common Council to give q hear
ing to certain gentlemen in regard to the COM
pletion of


r,l THE MARGINAL WAY.


Hon. John Lynch, President of the Portland
and Rochester Railroad Co., reheared the early
history of the Marginal Way enterprise, during
which he read editorial articles from the daily
newspapers favoring it, as an indication that
the citizens approved the action of the City
Council in appropriating means for its con-
struction; adding also the fact that no remon-
strances had ever been received by the City
Council against their action. The arguments
at the outset were of four-fold force now for
since the work was begun, contracts have been
signed for the construction of the Nashua and
Rochester road, and the work of completing
through line from Portland to New York is be-
ing pushed. The only objection raised against
completing the Marginal Way is the increase
over the estimated cost on account of the un-
known and uncertain nature of the flats. His
experience and observation were that the same





ON the front side of the city; yet none of those
enterprises had been abandoned and left in
worthless condition; and he did not believe the
city would suffer the money already invested
in the Marginal Way to be lost. Mr.. Lynch pro-
ceeded to show that the expense of breaking bulk
and transporting freight across the city to con-
Meeting lines was serious obstacle to the sue
cess of the p, & Il. r. r. BY giving it means
to reach the waterfront they could compete
successfully with other roads, The completion
Of the MARGINAL Nav xuould or,lu hap afit
the city by an increase of railroad traffic, but
other business would be attracted to the new
avenue. as had been the case on Commercial
street Another consideration in its favor is
that four great railway lines are now centering
in the narrow space at the upper end of the city
and occupying the harbor front, and the bust
ness must seek wharf accommodations else
where, and we have hundreds of acres of unim-
proved land lying along deep water. Within
one year the cars will run direct from Portland
to New York and Chicago. He believed it was
the duty OF the city to furnish avenues for
business whether it came by teams or rail-
roads. Railroads are taking the place of coun-
ty roads. We have just begun the develop
ment of the system. In reply to suggestion
that the railroad should pay for the use of such
an avenue, Mr.. Lynch said that it would be
quite as unjust as to fix a toll for wagon trans
portation.


Capt. Coyle said he spoke for all the steam
boat enterprises of this city and expressed the
interest of those corporations in this question
The is a combination of railroad interests
which is determined to crush out the business
OF Portland and we must do something in oul
own defence. To-day our largest railroad
corporations offer to carry freight from Skow-
hogan and Waterville to Boston for the same
price that they will take it to Portland. The
five steamboat corporations of Portland
handling million and half or two millions
OF capital, ask that their interests may be pro-
tected by the completion of the Marginal WAY.
They have kept down much of the discrimina
ton against Portland, and as they have never
asked any favors of the city they request now
that their interests may be protected by the
construction of the Marginal Way and the es
tablishment of railway connections In hi,
Judgment all the railroad business of Portland
would be done on Back Bay. 1t had got tc
come to that and he desired to improve it,
facilities as speedily as possible.


Mr.. Moses Gould said that the increase O
taxable valuation on Back Bay since the worl
of filling in the fats begun, is 100000. Whel
the rest of the area is improved, as it can be b!
the development of RAILROAD enterprise, ever.
square foot outside the space allowed for street
would be worth a dollar. Seven millions o
taxable property could be placed there in a few
years. The Back Bay Company propose. a
soon as the Marginal Way is completed. T.
build wharves and ask the Legislature leave t.
do q warehousing business.


Mr.. James l.. Farmer stated from his actua
Khowledge, that all the wharf room of Port
anu ianu suitable for heavy merchandise is alread,
sp occupied, and he found it difficult to obtail
,mnaliage tor 5000 or 1000 tons of coal. Ware

In the evening a number of unimportant
bills were passed ... p -allas'7 ""a
The bill to to incorporate the Asiatic Com
merclal Company was tabled -73 to 55.
Mr.. bingham of Ohio, from the Judiciary
Committee, moved that the Committee be dis
charged from further consideration in relation
10 lands or tne Kansas, Pacific and St Joseph
Railroad Companies. so' .
MIR. Butler Of Mass, said that he desired to
make minority report in connection with Mr..
| Voorhees,. ~


1t appeared from the coloquy that resulted
between Messrs: Bingham, Butler, voorhees,
! Peters and Eldridge, that the brief maps and
correspondence submitted to the Judiciary
| Committee ON behalf the Central Branch Of
the Union Pacific Railroad had been Withdrawn
and that interest declined to be further repre-
| sented in the controversy.


Mr.. Butler said that it was a matter involv-
| ing millions of dollars and hundreds of thOus-
aads of acres Of public land He was counsel
for none of these railroads, but they had as at
torney two ex-Attorney Generals He thought
the it time to enact law prohibiting ex-Attor-
ney Generals from practicfng before the De-
! partments. He gave the history of, the ques-
tion and said that in the hearing before the
| Judiciary Committee there had been no one to
| represent the United States-no present or ex-
! Attorney General nor double ex-Attorney
General. If the House of Representatives did
not protect the interests of the United States
in this matter, thece was no one else to do so.


Messrs. Peters and Goodrich, members of
the Judiciary Committee, defended the action
and report of the majority. Ha -
| Mr.. Eldridge, of Wisconsin, another member
of the committee, argued to show that an ar
rangement had been made between the railroad
companies, and that there was combination
made against the United States whase inter-
ests were thus sacrificed. He held that the
whole subject ought to be recommitted and a
full investigation made by the committee.


Mr.. Bingham, chairman of the committee,
vindicated the action of the majority in remit
ting the question to the decision of the Interior
Department <iN 'N


After further discussion the motion of Mr.
Bingham to discharge the committee was re-
jected, and Mr.. Butler moved to recommit the
matter. Agreed to.-Adjourned. ~ .ssss p,

jeremiah Lynch, who was arrested in Yorkvle
some days ago for cutting Ofcer Marshea, of the
Twenty-third precinct, in the hand, and young
man named James Finlay in the head, was accorded
an examination yesterday at the Yorkville Police
Court. Several witnesses were produced IN Court,
who swore positively that Lynch had no knife in
his hands when he fought with Fnay. They
were equally positive that Lynch had not
cut Oficer Marshea. The latter in his
original aildavit swore that Lynch was the
person who had cut him. but on his cross-examina-
ton he refused to accuse him directly OF the crime.
There were several witnesses called for the prose-
cution but none of them appeared, neither did
Finlay.


Justice Coulter said he would reserve his de-
cision for the purpose, as he subsequently stated,
OF submitting the evidence to the District Attorney
whose advice he intended to follow In the matter.

PROPOSITION TO BUILD FIVE U. 3. sLoOPs, BY
CONTRACT, IN PRIVATE YARDS.


LA the House OF Representatives, December 4th.I
Mr.. Townsend, of Pennsylyania. l take issue
with the gentleman from Maine Mr. Lynch
when he tells the House that there are no prl-
vate ship-yards in the country that are capable
OF building vessels of war. l want to say to him
that OF my own knowledge there are ship-yards
to-day that are executing contracts for the Pa
ciho Mail Steamship Company, and for other
companies and are building ships under the re-
quirements Of acts Of Congress that are suitable
iOr VESSELS Of war.


The ship yard Of John Roach & Co., at Ches-
ter Pennsylvania, has just launched one OF the
most magnificent iron vessels that the merchant
service OF this country ever possessed, vessel
of about two thousand tons burden, made OF
non, and 80 made that at any time can be turn
Nd into a vessel OF war at very little expense.
Lower down the river Delaware, at Wilmington.
IN the State of Delaware, the Harlan Hollings-
worth ship-building company has also just
launched similar vessel, and the ship-yards Of
both OF those places have now on the stocks
magnificent vessels. equal in size with those al
ready launched, and which will be sent forth up
un the ocean inH very short time to compete
with other nations for the commerce of the
world.


So, too, further up the river, the ship.yard OF
Cramp Sons, in Phadslphia, last summer
uilt and launched two vessels for the Pennsyl.
tania Railroad Company, as strong and well
tuilt as capable of ocean navigation, and as cas-
lly turned into war vessels any that were ever
tilt in the country 1t is mistake OF the gem
II lman from Maine Mr. Lynchl to suppose that
tire ship-yard OF any one of those three places Is
uot now fully equipped to build these vessels at
Il o shortest notice. / know, because have
gone through them all, that they have all the
Il eans aud appliances necessary for the pur-
pose that they have skilled workmen. that they
nave admirable machinery. and that the country
ouse around them furnishes the very best IRON


(. ruNN fla VNfTNh
and in everv way adapted for ahy vessels that
cal be set ahoat on the ocean for commerce or
iOr war.


Mr.. scofeld here asked whether the iron
~ d IN the Reading II H. colliers was not OF a
Jur quality, costing ""a cents pound, while
ron fit for these sloOps would cost l019 and
also whether all merchant ships are not built
VITA machinery above the water line, too expos
81 for Use vessels of war


Ir. Townsend continued In answer to the
'utleman, will say that there is no iron manu-
cured in the world that has greater tensile
ngth and that can resist greater pressure than
tie iron manufactured at Ooatesvllle, chester
ciuuty, Pennsylvania And will say in addition
lat the iron manufactured there was used by
ne Government all through the war for boiler
I'D machinery aud all the other nppurtenancet
iron ships in the Navy, showing conclusivelI

lively about that as some of my colleague
m, is OF the very best character aud has beer

His Full Confession of the Murder.

Depot, Last sight. -5,-r,",,"are before the public. Professor West has re-
turned to the scene of his murderous operations,
surrendered himself into the custody Of the
Sheriff Of Kent county and is now securely locked
within the portals Of the new jail.


After his disappearance from tho train at Del
mar, nothing more was seen Of the Professor
until last night when, shortly before the arrival
OF the North bound freight, with passenger car
attached, at Harrington. he suddenly and almost
unobservedly


TURNED UP AT THE DEPOT


Few persons, however. il any, recognized in
the mud-stained and mutled individual the ana
BILE and good-looking Profession, and his person
ality was unknown to those collected at the de-
pot, until boy named Reeoe Merritt remarked to
the byetanders, ""rhere IL the man went to
school to, at Dover, Mr.! West. He is the man
who was blown up by the gas explosion at Do
YER""


No attempts were made to arrest Mr.. West at
Harrington, and when the train started,


HE ENTERED THE CAR,


and sat himself down in one Of the seats, foot
sore and weary, and much agltated in mind.
The conductor, Thomas II. Hawkins, in the
meantime, had been apprised of the presence OF
MIR. West upon the train, and kept constant
watch over him. When called upon for bis
ticket, he replied he had none. and no money TO
pay his fare, The conductor, however, allowed
him TO ride on to his destination, after he had
said he was ""going to Dover to give himself up
VESTS CONFESSION TO MR.. HAWKINS.


Taking seat beside MIR. Vest. Mr.. Hawkins
began to question him relative to the murder
aud the singular manner IN which he had acted
He frankly confessed that he had taken the life
of the colored man, but said, in paliation of the
deed, that ii was committed in self defence
that OoOch Turner, (the man murdered) had OBJ
tanned y glimpse OF his pocket-book and its we'll
filled contents, as he was paying bin for some
work done, whereupon he (Iurner) picked up
sA.nA
| Turner then, he says, advanced upon him with
| the hammer uplifted, when he picked up bar
| Of iron, one or two feet in length, and struck
him on the back of the neck, killing him instant
| ly This was done on Monday.


THE MUTILATIoN OF The BODY. l..


The commission OF the murder, West says stu
| piled him with horror, and his next thought was
| the disposition of the body, without the knowl-
| edge of it coming before the public. He says
/ that ho, therefore, began to remove the body by
| piecemeal cutting off the hands, head and feet,
| with the Intention of burying them, but the
| ground was frozen 30 hard that he found this to
| be an impossibilIty, and 30 resolved upon the
| plan TO burn the building and the body with ID,
| lie in the meantime disappearing, in the hope
that the charred remains would be taken for his
| own and the whole affair would be attributed to
an explosion of the gas which he was exper-
| imennng with. & 10


''YoU NEVER HAD DEAD NIdaER ON YOUR
/ HANDS,""


When questioned as to the singular manner in
| which he had acted, and why he did not at once
| confess the deed which he had committed, that
| he might be honOrably exhonerated, he replied
that he was no confused he knew not what to do
that tyou never had dead niger on your
hands"" and don't know what you would have
done under the circumstances.


ARRIVAL AT DOVER.


Word had been teegraphed the sheriff Of Kent
county from Harrington that West was on the
| n,,A f,,F i'm tr he at ha
its arrival at Dover. The operator at
Dover instead of quietly communicating the
fact to the sheriff his duty required
spread the news abroad through the community
| as we'll aud when the train drew up at the de-
pot there were several hundred people iu wait
ing. Ex.Sheuff Hargadine and Deputy Sheriff
Irons, assisted by posse, took the prisoner 10
charge. Dut the crowd pressed around them, ex-
claiming what have you done with the deao
nigger p why did you kill him ?"" Hang
MIN I"" and such like, and many persons suppose
that had it not been for the Sheriff, the prisoner


would have been lynched upon tine spot.
IN JAIL.


The sheriff forced his way through the crowd
aud led his prisoner to the jail, where he wa
confined to await an investigation. Attorney


General Lore went down to Dover last night
Vests brothers and his father-in- law Joined hin
, , in the cell They were very much distressed
and in tears while West coolly and apparently

>, ANOTHER THEoRY OF THE MURDER.
y Two theories of the murder prevail at Dovel
4 one OF which was puOishedin our columns, yes
!. terday The other1is that Cooch Turner hri
- | being hired to convey large box from Capt


BattelIs cabinet shop was enticed to test the gai
# which, when it had been inhaled, had quite
- different effect upon Cooch from what had bee


anticipated and resulted in his death, HaVln


killed the man, his next experiment was TO dit


pose of the BODY and 30 AZ a last resort, tn
. burning of the building, and the blowing up
=, the body was resorted to. The scheme was
~ desperate one, but had it succeeded, Dover, tC
! day, would have been lamentlng the untimel
u death of the Professor, rather than speculatin
III upon the causes which led to the commission {


the crime, and weighing the justice OF his meri


to sympathy by the circumstances as they ar


more fully revealed.


no PUBLIC SYMPATHY,


ts However rests with the Professor, we unde
ce stand, from a gentleman who came up fro
ey | Dover, this morning. The excitement runs hig
IN but the mantle OF charity is thrown over the 10


deed, aud an element in the community is .


ready strongly impressed with the insanity


Mr. West The singular manner in which he b
OK acted, we must confess, points to this concl
he sion, but it may be an insanity which orglnat

some Of the Senators on that ques-
ton was plainly evidenced yester-
day by the objections which were
made to suspension of the rules
for the purpose of allowing the
Senator from Ouachita (Mr. Ray
to introduce bills bearing directly
upon it.


Mr.. Lynch-As this discussion


has taken a political turn, I was
unwilling to participate in it, but as
my motives, as well as those of
other Senators with whom I am
acting, have been impugned, I deem
it my duty to defend myself. When
the gentleman (Mr. Blackman)


states that those Senators who are
acting in opposition to him on these


political questions are not prepared
to act with him upon measures of
reform, he states that which is not
warranted by the facts. I appeal
to the record of the last and pre-
vious sessions to prove that I, as
well as other Senators now working
with me, were ready to cooperate
with him in the passage of any and
every measure which looked toward
the reform of existing abuses. 1
challenge the Senator (Mr. Black
mani to show from his record that
he ever introduced q measure of
that character; and yet when bills
are introduced by other Senators,
especially those of a political ma
ture, the gentleman gets up and
makes long speeches about the
wrongs of the dear people, ""my
people"" and denouncing everybody
else in general because they do not
do exactly as he directs. The
gentleman says this revolution COM
menced in 1868, and that the State
administration had been founded
and sustained in revolution. 1 tell
the Senator, in reply, that when
the first shot was fired at the flag
of our country on Fort Sumter,
then and there the revolution COM
menced; then was the first effort
made to overthrow the only govern
ment in the world that recognized
the brotherhood of man. Allusion
has been made to those who have
come from distant portions of the
country, among whom have the
honor to belong. I am not here
blythe permission of the gentleman;
l am not here by his invitation. Il
came here as an humble soldier of
the republic, to-aid in establishing
a government where anarchy and
chaos prevailed, and where there
existed a reign of terror and
tyranny more terrible than that
inaugurated by any of the
cruel Roman emperors. Now,
what is the resolution before
the Senate Simply to provide
for the appointment of a committee
to inform the Governor and House
of Representatives that we are ready
for business. If the Senator Mr..
Blackman] had been in his place
on the first day of the session, and !
had not absented himself, with other
Senators, for the purpose of break
ing the quorum, this resolution
would have been unanimously
adopted, and we would now be
transacting the business of the
State regularly. If the Senator
does not wish to go back to fort
Sumter to trace this revolution, 1
tell him it began on the first day of
the session of the General Assem-
bly,, when his seat and the seats of
bis associates were vacant.


Mr.. Ragan-As we have heard
enough political speeches to-day, 1
would advertise those who wish to
'peak to wait until next summer,
md to expend their wind on the
stump. l now call for the previous
question on the adoption of the re-
olution.


The resolution was adopted."

MIR. CliffOrd's Speech.",,"


young Democracy. We trust that we shall
excite no jealousies and heart-burnings in
the Conservative ranks by this timely recog-
milton of conspicuous ability and worth. The
preeminence of Mr. Clifford ought to be uni
versally conceded. He has made politics,
constitutional law and the history of parties
the study of his short but active life. The ef-
forts of the older campaign orators of his
party are familiar learning with him. He
knows how to exhort the impenitent Republi-
can. He has word of encouragement for
every doubter, an exhortation for every back
slider, speech for every occasion. Where
ever two or three Democrats are gathered to-
gether, Mr.. Clifford is in the midst of them
with his speech. Indeed Mr.. Clifford is be-
coming the central figure in Maine Demo-
cratic politics. His speech has been printed
in the Boston Post and, if we are not mis-
taken, the New York World once spoke of it
as a creditable production. 1t will be seen,
therefore, that the speech is not undeserving
of the brief suggestions we propose to make
touching its arguments, especially when we
consider the prominence its author is likely
to attain hereafter. As his hearers look up
on his fair, animated and handsome counte-
nance, they see therein the promise of all
sorts of future dignities and honors-Legis-
lator, Gongressmany Senator, Governor and
Judge. They know that the form which
stands so unassumingly before them will one
day be clothed with the majesty of the high
est official positien--that of President itself,
perhaps. And gazing on the same bright
face, they see, as the people of Illinois are
said to have formerly seen in the face of
Stephen A. Douglas, custom-houses, post-of
fees, collectorships, cerkships, army appoint
ments, naval Offices and government con-
tracts, ,sprouting out in unchecked luxuriance,
all to be in good time bestowed on them
and their friends and associates. Such q
man will of course command respect where
ever he opens his lips, be it ever SO often.


1t is worth our while, therefore, to ex-
anime his speech for moment, and find out
if we can, what its intrinsic merits are. 1t
will probably be deIivereda great number of
times during the pending canvass, and we
may as well set Mr.. Clifford right. on a few
points atonce. Taking the report published
in the argus we would respectfully suggest
the elimination of the following sentences:


No honest citizen can say that this (Grant's)
administration has met either the expectations
of its friends-the emergencies of the time-or
operated to allay in the slightest degree, the
fears of its conservative opponents. When it
began its career it found chaotic and disorder
ed South Almost four years of its attempts
at Southern pacification, have rendered the
SOuthprn disorders InO n
yeterate. ... te:l, ,.fs ..iiik 4.


Now as matter of fact, Gen. Grants
friends expected that he would meet the
emergencies of the times, and he has done it
with marvellous and unprecedented success,
by preserving the peace at home, with foreign
nations and with the Indians, by stoutly ad-
herring 10 his oft-repeated pledge to uphold
the rights conferred ON the freedmen by the
constitution and laws of the United States,
by honestly collecting and prudently expend-
ing the revenues, rapidly reducing the public
debt, and by submitting in all respects to the
clearly expressed will of the people. And as
for ""allaying the fears of his Conservative
opponents, no patriot will condemn him be-.
cause he has not done SO. So far as we know,
his Conservative opponents feared that he
would look with disfavor on the Ku-Klux
Klan, the whipping and shooting of defence
less negroes, and the practical disregard of the
last three amendments to the Constitution of
the United States-and he has not disap-
pointed them. They feared that he would
rule the American people honestly and wisely
and would bring to a peaceful issue our con-
troversies with foreign nations, thus preelud-'
ing the possibility of Democratic return to
power for many years-and here again they
have no been disappointed If the South is
not yet pacified, it shows how incorrigible the
old Rebel element has become under the
promptings of Northern sympathizers. No
conquered people was ever before treated with
half the generosity that has been shown the
Confederates, and they would long since have
been content with the clemency that not only
spares life and property but promptly restores
to the enjoyment of civil and political rights,
had it not been for the partizan zeal of their
Northern friends. -a -a


And it will not do, Mr.. Clifford, to talk to
any intelligent audience, made up of people
who know the history of the last decade,
about Grants administrations having suffer-
ed American commerce to wither and decay,'
and about its unjust and unequal laws hay
ing absolutely swept American commerce
from the SEAS"" What! This from an en-
bryo Senator? Aspire to be President and
not know that American commerce was
''swept from the seas'' by Democratic cruis-
ers? Talk about unjust and unequal laws,
when Democratic opposition has within few
months defeated both Mr.. Lynch and Mr..
Hale in their efforts to give commerce one
more chance for its life? If there is one sub
ject in the world which a sagacious Demo-
cratic orator will perceive that he must from
the nature of the case avoid, it is the subject
of the shipping interest. Shipbuilding is
branch of industry that received its death at
Democratic hands, and Democrats have nev-
er yet consented to any practical effort to re-
vive it.


The one effort made by Democratic Con-
gressmen to revive shipbuilding was that of
Mr.. Cox of New York who killed Hale's bill
providing for a drawback on material, by
moving an amendment which ,could place the
British shipbuitders in direct competition Nth
our Own! ~""


ELSEWHERE will be found call for Con-
vention of the Washingtonian Reform Clubs
in the State, to be held at Augusta, Wednes-
day June 5th, for the purpose of perfecting
State organization and taking such measures
as willcarry the work into every town in Maine,
With central organization that shall secure
united and systematic effort, under the inspi-
ration OF the leaders who have already accom-
plished so marvellous and beneficent results,
the Washingtonian movement is certain to \
produce the most important and glorious
reform that was ever inaugurated. Thousands
of men will be reclaimed from moral degra-
dation and restored to manhood; tens of
thousands of hearts burdened with the sor-
row ana woe that intemperance brings, will
once more be joyous and hopeful; prisons will
become tenantless; work houses useless pau-
per bills will be reduced nine-tenths: hundreds
of thousands of dollars, now worse th.n
wasted, will go to comfort those who are now
the helpless victims of the rum traffic; and
the communities that come within the in
nuence of the reform, be morally elevated.

The coffin was placed on beautiful catafalque
in the middle Of the chancel and was covered with
neatly arranged wreaths OF immorteles. As the
procession moved into the church o solemn dirgc
was executed by the choir. The usual formality or
palbearers was dispensed WITH


Among those present, and the observed Of all
observers, the wild W OF the Inflated deceased
accompanied by her mother. They were com.
pletely bowed down with grief and sorrow. Almost
every tongue was occupied In whispers Of the hero
ism and devotion exhibited by Mrs. 0'Neill on the
occasion OF the fearful occurrence which left her
alone and unprotected In the world; and the rec0
lection OF her presence OF mind and thorough Cath
olic piety in procuring the services OF a clergyman
Of her faith to baptize her expiring husband into
the communion OF the Catholic Church earned for
her the heartfelt esteem and sympathy OF the large
crowd Of her coreligionists then assembled In the
church.


When the cofin was deposited on the catafalque
q solemn requiem high mass was offered by Father
Lynch as celebrant, Father Flynn as deacon and
Father McCreedy as sub-deacon, the music being
most creditaby rendered by the excellent choir OF
st. Stephens At the close OF the services Father
Flynn uttered few remarks offering words OF
consolation to the bereaved relatives and friends OF
the deceased, and reminding all present Of the
brief tenure OF human life and It's great uncertainty
even under the most favorable circumstances.
After the conclusion OF the sermon the coffin was
removed and placed In the hearse, which was then
driven of to Calvary Cemetery, followed by apout
dozen carriages containing the murdered mans
relatives and friends."

Dr. Matlock of New Orleans presented a
memorial from the Church I'm Louisiana, setting
forth that great excitement had been caused
among the colored brethren of that section by
the failure OF the General Conference to elect a
bishop Of African descent. One church OF 200
members had seeded from the denomination
Unless serious consideration was given to the
paper, Dr. Matlock feared that he would not be
able to prevent grave difficulties. During the
past few years over 10000 members Of African
descent had Joined the NJ. Il. Church, believing
that ecclesiastical equality would be accorded
them. There were millions of colored people In
the United States, the majority Of them friendly
TO Methodism and only waiting to sec one of
their race elevated TO the highest ofnce in the
Church.


Brother Lakn OF Alabama said he had re-
coived advices Of similar uneasnoss among the

earnest and impassloned appeal to theConfercnce
to send man Of African descent TO preside over
the four millions OF cOlOred people. They did
not ask that a coiored man shah preside over
Conferences In New York, Philadelphia, or Bos-

Loggerhead Gulch.",,"Some incidea, in it's early eareor had
given Loggerhsad Gulch its name. just
what that incident was did net live in the
traditions Of the rough miners who dug
and dolved in the gulch. Certain 1t is.
however, that the name was no misno-
mer; for no other mining camp in the
Territory was 30 rough, quarrslseme,and
pugilistc in the nature Of its inhabitants.
Every body seemed at loggerheads with
everybody else, and ready upon the
slightest provocation to lynch everybody
else.


The diggins had not Of late been very
productive Of fprofit, and thai fact did not
add to the kindly spirits Of the miners,
who were disposed to revenge their luck
upon anything that presented itself ~
possible scaps grace


Ne mining camp can exist, or at least
ever has existed, without drinking ss-
loon, and Loggerhead Gulch had its
shanty devoted to the rstailidg Of drink.
Its proprietor was Jack Jepths, and his
dress and demsanor indicated that he had
seen better dsys--had besna = faro dealer
or . barksspsr in a big Eastern hotel, or
something Of that hashy nature. Even
now some traces OF loud dressing hung
about him but the brim OF the felt hat
was battered, and there was something
the matter with tho crown; the flaming
red tie failed to harmonise with the 81
most equally flaming and shaggy red
beard above it; the shirt collar was woe
fully timestainsd the velvstesn coat was
smirched, and had grown white vt the
seams, and at least three buttons were
lacking at the vest.


Tho only other occupant OF Jack Jep-
tha's shanty at the moment the reader 10
introduced to it, excepting the customers,
was a young woman--Jacks wife by
courtesy, and Molle by name. And
with her really delicate beauty che seem
cd wonderfully out Of plncs at Logger
head Gulch. She was about the middle
height, between twenty three and twenty.
four years Of age, slim and elegant ~ to
her figure, fair as an angel 10 painted,
with soft blue eyes and dropping lashes /;
her mouth was small, her lips full and
rosy, and her teeth were ~ white As
pearls. When animated, or talking to
any one, . pleasant, fascinating smile
would play around her mouth; but at
times, when she imagined no one was
locking ct her, the corners Of her mouth
we're drawn down with hard, care worn
expression. Her rounded shoulders and
graceful neck, white IS alabastsr, were
revealed by low dress. She shared the
honors Of the bar with Jack, and dspens-
cd bad whisky and smiles to the Logger
heads with dash and grace that largely
augmented the aggregate sales.


Among the drinkers was one upon
whom liberal potations had told consid.
srably. His companlons called him
Towhead, from the color OF his hair. and
that was the only name he had In camp
In his pocket he had a fair sized bsg OF
gold dust, which he had incautiously dis
played several times during the evening.


At l2 o'cleek Towhsad rose to 60, but
frat called Jack Jeptha outside the door
aud placed the bag Of dust in bis hands.


""Thars my pile, Jack, he said,
4"" and I want yer to keep it till to-mor-
row. am little too drunk to take it

man skulked after him in the shadow.
Thus followed, Towhsad staggered along
until his path led him through = deep
gully, which had been dubbed the Devils
Glen. Then and there his follower
stsalthily advanced from behind aud kill
ed him with q murderous dirk stab. A
hasty search Of the victims pockets cen
vinced tho murderer that the prize for
which he had committed the villainous
deed was not there. Thea the cowardice
of the man showed itself. A storm had
been coming up, and now, as it burst
fsrth in thunder, lightning and flood, he
shiversd. With blood ON his hands, and
with horrer in his eyes, and with the
dreadful mark of Cain branded indelibly
on his brow, the wretched man fled,
clutching kis breast with his pale, talon.

The storm was wild, madly, canonnad

imaginary and unearthly cry Of ""mur.

Towhsad had not been murdered ar
teen minutes before his body was discov.
cred by q party Of miners returning from
some midnight earouse. They carried it
back to jack Jeptha's shsnty amid
threats Of vengeance upon the murder

upon tho bag of dust, with Towhsad's

""Thats Towhesds,"" replied several.

Jack Jeptha turned pale as he realized
the predicament in which he was placed.
ne gave the true version Of the affair,
but they would not believe it. They were
anxious to fix the guilt upon some one,
to hang somebody, for Towhesd had
been pretty popular among them Sew
eral remained to guard over Jack, while
others went out to collect the miners for
the immediate holding Of trial. Judge
Lynch allows no delay, and there was ev.
cry prospect Of hanging in the morning.


Mollis Jeptha came into the room up
on the arrival Of the corpse, and her eyes
had closely watched Jacks face. But
she believed his version Of the story


/"" jack"" she whispered, :"" believe
you /"" and then added aloud. 81 believe,
know who did this. There was a stran-
ger here among the rest drinking last
night, and more than once | saw him
looking at Tswhead's bag.


But the rough aud unrcasoning crowd
would not listen.


""Jack, sho again whispered to the
prisoner, ""keep up your courage, old
partner, and I'll get you out OF 1t yet.


""No, ssid'Jack, dcggsdly, 81 didn't
do it, and went run. Let them hang
mo il they want to. ""


al don't want you to run, Jack, she
said; I'm going after that fellow my
self Good bye, Jack, keep up your
courage.


Molie kissed him, armed hersslf with
= pair Of revolvers, and slipped out un-
noticed Taking the path that Towhead
had followed, and speeding along with
all her strength, she soon came TO tho
blood marked spot Of the murder.


""Of course he ran away, she thought
""and likely he took tho path.


On she went through the storm, which
still ragged with such binding fury as to
render it difficult to keep the path. On
she went, mile after mile, until the rapid
gait began to tell upon her strength, and
she thought she must drop down, when
through the darkness she saw the muir
dsrer lying where he had fallen, and the
blood fresh upon his hands and shirt
He turned to fee, but her determined
voice stopped him. Il


Move step further and I'll shoot ""


He was entirely unarmed, aad having
thrown away the bloody knife could do
nothing but obey,


~ am going to take you back TO the
shanty, she continued Go on ahead,
and remember that bullet will be the
cost Of any attempt to escape. Go on!

ing she meant what she said, sullenly
started.


With q revolver in her hand, Moll fol
lowed a few steps in the roar. ORce he
turned quickly, as il to grappls with her
and disarm her, but changed his mind,
and he sullsnly started on again Know
ing that death awaited him st the shanty,
still he lacked the courage to make the
only possible effort for liberty.


Daylight came as they nearsd the cab
in, and both could hardly drag them
selves along, but not . word was spoken.
Az the gulch became lighted up Mcllie
saw q crowd Of miners take the path

ground that he was Democrat Gen. Fitzpatrick said
he hoped no would be excluded from the Commit
tee for such reason. The Liberal Republicans GER
tainy expected the Democratic party 10 ndorse the
Cincinnati ticket. II necessary TO have Democratic
cooperation In reality there Democratic party
left but only Grant party and new party that was
forming


Mr. swayze said the present Convention belonged TO
the Liberal Republicans and while they did not intend
10 refuse Democratic assistance, they were unable TO
tell what action would be sprung upon them in the Bal
timore Convention. The Liberal Republicans desired to
show now far they could alone for the father CT
the Republican party Were they to accept at this juno

tlon organs to impair the influence of this gathering,
which would be called Democratic or mixed He desired

Mr. Hopkinson said there was doubt that the Bati-
more Convention would ndorse the Cincinnati
nominees and would probably appoint committees OF

mittee in New-Jersey.


The delegate who nominated Mr.. Middleton declared
that he had done good faith that gentleman hav

Mp. Thompson Immediately left the house and
proceeded ts the rcsidrpce Of a nei2hbor, nearly
opposite and begged for admi,tance. Tho yaln-
Hi thinking Il some difficult, between husband
and wife, refused to Interfere, and the negro
who had also arrived At the house by this time
was cit master Of the situation. Taking hcr hy
the hair OF the head lie dragged her from the
house Of her neighbor 10 her own house, and
conveyed her 10 the upper story hy the same

proceeded TO satisfy his internal lust, despite the

for the furniture In the apartment Is complete

was caught, Dennis drawing a razor aud at the

wretch from her and succeeded in gaining her

ton would permit to the house OF Joseph l.efevre
nearly a quarter cfo mile fcom her own house,
| in n perfectly nude condition, every stitch OF her
clothing having been torn from her person, and

The negro In the struggle bit large pieces OF

| spit It ou, upon the floor.

Yet To Be Established.",,"xeL 10 DO Estabhahod.


The Methodist Missionary Committee met yester-
day at ten A. NJ, and after devotional exercises


and reading the minutes the appropriations TO
annual Conferences for domestic missions were re-
sumed at the point where the committee left Off on


Friday-Ohio. To Oregon $1,000 was added


contingent on an extension OF the work. To the
Rocky Mountain Conference, recently organized by
Bishop Foster So 900 was added for new work and


extension. This Conference covers territory 400


miles wide and 1000 miles long, and has fifteen


ministers ana membership of POI. They have just
opened an important mission In Pr0van, among the
Mormons. The missionary appointed there has BEEN


East. and by lectures and private appeals rasen


50 600, and gone back again to build church there
There is great religious movement among the
apostate Mormons, and the Methodist church
there has great power over the people,
and especially over the children, and, they


could very easily use to advantage much


larger sum than that asked for. Texas obtained


$14, 900, OF which sum $4,000 is contingent on new


work. Rev. A. S Lakin said that emigrants were
moving into that State at the rate OF more than


one hundred wagon loads day. The settlement


OF that State during the last three years is beyond
| all precedent and beyond all expectation. There
is, therefore. Hr
GREAT DEMAND FOR MEN N
and means to take that country TOR Christ. Es~


pecally are men needed who can organize So


cieties. The bishops who nave been over that


ground also favored this contingent appropriation,


which was granted. Philadelphia asked for $4,000
to plant missions in the Lehigh and Lebanon VAL


leys and to give vigor to their city missions. Dr.
Patterson, Dr. Trimblc, Bishop Peck and others


participated in the discussion that arose, and gene


rally condemned the practice adopted in Phila-


delphia and elsewhere IN diverting missionary


collections and local missions. But the rca-


son assigned was that there Is no city


missionary society In Philadelphia, and that
the churches dispose Of their own moneys


in local missions. Bishop James said that


Philadelphia contained larger missionary popula-


tion than many OF the Conferences to which large


appropriations are made. Philadelphia raises


large sums for the Missionary Society, but 1T does


not on that account ask lor large appropriations


but because it needs the money. An appropriation


of 1000 instead OF $4,000 then made S., 00l


more was added to the Rocky Mountain contingent


appropriation, so as to make the total $4,000. Ir


view OF the division OF the Western New York Con
1erences by the last General Conference and the


consequent changes in the time Of holding thei
annual session, some disargangement has occurred


IN the distribution OF mission lunds Central Nev


York Conference was there ore given 800 for II.

Of every chance to cav about the require

chance yesterday morning to plead exhaustion
of mind and body as a reason why their Sunday
devotions should not be performed, and the result
was that the churches were well filed with as
pirants for heavenly pabuum. In the Catholic
churches the halfpast ten O'Clock service well
attended, though In most OF these the sermon was
omitted, the pastors wisely remembering that in
such season as this there could be no knowing
what sort or turn the weather might take.
At st. Stephens church, In Twenty y-eighth street,
there was a noticeable increase in the numbers
attending the high mass as compared with Sun
days recently. when even In this large and splendid
temple the effect OF the heat was most disagreea-

by the Rev. Father Lynch, the choir parts being all
sung fully usual. The music very at

any way reconcile people for the loss OF the sermon,
ing the GregoJian spirit to please the most ardent
admrer of brilliant and sparkling phrasing In the
other parts Of the mass more familiar and perhaps


more devotional music was sung, some OF which was
rendered with all the perfection that true artistic
effort always commands. Should the weather con-
time TO abate In solar pressure the sermons,
doubtless, will be soon resumed at this church."

The Louisiens Usurpation-The Two


Boards os state Csnvassors.


The people of Louisiana, through their COM
mittee at Washington, have shown that the
removal Of the Secretary of State, Heron, and
the appointment of Colonel Wharton was the
commencement of the troubles which led to
the overthrow Of the State government. They
assert that while Heron was removed on
charges previously preferred against him the
action of Governor Warmoth at that particu-
lar moment was induced by the discovery that
Heron and Lynch, the two officers remaining
in the Board of Canvassers with the Governor
and then forming the majority, had entered
into conspiracy to override the returns of the
election officers, and, by rejecting certain
fusion districts on the pretence Of irregulari-
ties, to declare the republican candidate for
Governor and majority Of republican Sena-
tors and Representatives elected, This state
ment receives corroboration from many cir
cumstances. All the republican papers for
some time conceded the election Of the fusion
candidates for State officers in Louisiana and
Of q majority of fusionists in the Legislature
The republican organ in this city, in New
Orleans despatch as late as November II, gave
the following as the result


NEW ORLEANS Nov. II, 1872

dent gives Grant 13 296; Greeley, 22,6S6. Greeleys

would hardly have been taken had he not

viously by Governor Warmoth, and Heron
had been appointed in his place. Bovee did
not attempt to act as Secretary of State after
his removal, but appealed to the Courts and
the suit to oust Heron and reinstate Bovee
was pending at the time of Herron's removal
by the Governor. Heron had no right what
ever to act as o member of the Board of
Canvassers after his removal, and his meeting
with Lynch and their appointment of Long
street and Hswkins had not o shadow of au-
thority. On the other hand, even if Heron
had been in position to act le-
gally as Secretary of State after his re-
moval, it would still have been incompetent
for the two members of the Board of Canvass
ers, Messrs. Heron and Lynch, to have met
and filed vacancies without the presence of

The first step in Judge Durell's usurpation
was the recognition Of this bogus Board of
State Canvassers, who stood pledged to count
the republicans into Office, and the enjoining
of the Governor md his associates on the reg
ular board. The legal position of the regular
Canvassing Board is shown in the following
official account of the proceedings on Novem-
Der Is, from the New Orleans papers of that
date:-

dence OF his qualification for the Office OF Colonel
]. Wharton, as the successor OF General Heron.
Colonel Wharton was In the anterOom, and
being sent for promptly appeared and took his seat

Governor and the returning ofncers with dehb-
crate purpose to defraud him OF an alleged cleo
ton to the ONCE OF Governor Of Louisiana, py Iasi
Tying, mutilating AUD destroying the election r.
turns received from the Supervisors OF kegvtrao
tion throughout the state, which retu.ns he
claimed to constitute the indispensable efdenceOi

turning ofaoers be restrained from making what he
asserts would be ''sham and fraudulent return
and count, declaring McEnery elected"" and
that the returns be surrendered to Messrs Heron,
!, Longstreet and Lynch, who would make ""a just,
honest and truthful canvass.n On the assumption
that IL was the intention Of the returning officers
ITO destroy the returns, he alleges that unless the
agents just named permitted to act before said
Returns statements and certificates of the Super
visors Of Registration are destroyed placed be-
syond the reach OF said legal Board OF returning
tomcers tHerron, Longstreet and Lynch) evidence

pensable as proof Of his right to said ONCE would
be placed beyond his reach, and he win be deprived

A very brief statement Of facts win suaico to
prove snas Senator keioGgs object IN wishing 70
ciseiy that which he charged upon the returning
ofncers and the Governor-that to say, his
order that BY ""a sham and fraudulent return and

himself to be defeated BY nearly seven thousand

BY his decision they were constituted returning
saes s q Rs nd
garded and violated the law, but they did that
which probably had never before been even
tmagined-that1s Is to say, they deliberately sup
pressed the returns Of whole State election and
documents, statements OF certificates. '.4


BY way Of illustration, suppose that the Board of
State Canvassers OF the State Of New York
should simply burn up the county records
without looking at them. and that they
should then proclaim result for all
of1icers-State, county and municlpal-basea
upon the oral declarations OF defeated candidates
or the written statements OF persons utterly un-
known to the law as returning officers, or upon
purely fancifal or arbitrary figures arranged With
out regard to any rational theory OF computation
this would be precisely analogous to the action OF
Hawkins, Bovee and Lynch.


Take as facts illustrating the manner In which
I which the law requires and as developed simply

the general ticket there were seven
1 candidates on each side, or, includ-
1 ing Presidential electors, nfteen on eacn
4 side. Now, in the nineteen parishes OF East


ser, Caddo, Cameron, Caldwell, Calcasien Carroll,


Calahoula. Natchitoches, Rapides, Sabine ST. TAM
many, Vermillion, webster, Vernon, Winn, Wash.
ingt0n, they credit to each and every candidate


on the radical ticket precisely the same number OF
| votes in each parish, and similarly to each and
every candidate on the fusion ticket with varia-


ton In four parishes between the Presidential vote
| and the State vote to be hereafter noted). Hence


there was not single scratched ticket voted In all


those nineteen parishes which Is contrary to prob


ability and reason, or the scratched tickets exactly
balanced in each and every one OF the nineteen
parishes, which Is still more contrary TO reason
| and probability. In the parishes OF vermiion,
vernon, Wlnn and washington they make this re-
| turn for President:-

The Lynchburg republican gives the following
account Of the shooting ARRAY between young
TArdy and Ward. brisf report of which was
telegrsphed:


1t will be remembered thar several months
ago difficulty occurred between William II.
Ward and VIM. H. Tsrdy. two residents of this
county, In which Tardy was killed. Ward was
subsequently arrested and tried at Pittsylvania
court-house (the shooting having occurred in
that couuty.) and the jury brought In verdict
Of not guilty Last Tuesday. Charles Tardy, a
son Of the deceased, met with Ward at Ohurless'
ford, on Staunton river, near the scene Of the
hIrt tragedy. .nand 4 reoontre ensued In which
Ward was shot three times and mortally woun-
ded.


Tardy's story is that when he came 10 the ford
from the PittsylvaDia side Of the river Ward was
just ascending the bank OH the Campbell side.
and that after riding few PAGES from the river
Ward stopped aud turned his horse across the
road as IL to prevent his passing He attempted
to pass anyhow, but was headed OF by Ward, who
made mo 7ement as II to draw pistol when he
Crardy) stopped. He says that himself and
Ward drew their pistols at the same time but
that he fired three times while Ward did not fire
At all. Ward statement on the contrary,is that
he saw Tardy behind him before be reached the
bank on the Campbell eide OF the river, and that
he had no idea OF difficulty, ~ TAriy was riding
quite leisurely and whistling q tune.


He Gays, further, that the first intimation, he
had Of any intention he had on the part Of Tar
dy was that he shot in the back OF the head and
Immediately thereafter received two additional
bullets, one in the shoulder and the other in the
back, when he fell from his horse. He AYERS
that he had no pistol on his person and made
no demonstration Of any kind. This state
ment ia made in the belief that he cannot pos
sibly recover from his wounds. TsIdy was
promptly arrested and conveyed to Pittrylvania
county iAil."

Crowds or Christmas Worshippcrs.


Christmas was celebrated at St. Stephens
church, In Twenty-eighth street, with great splen-
dor. From early morning until evening the ser
vices were continued. The church itself was
splendidly decorated On former festival ooca-
stOns the services had been conducted with great
pomp and ceremony; yesterday there seemed to
be festival air about the church. the result OF
combination OF influences. The magnificent affairs
were decorated with great taste, and though there
was profuson Of flowers everywhere visible yet
everything SO fitted Its place. and the ornamental
additions were in themselves 80 beautiful that the
scene was exquisitely rich and harmonious.
There was no crowding OF candelabrums on the
altars and yet there was full illumination OF the
sanctuary, tinted by the mellowed light that came
through the stained glass windows. Evergreens,
frs and bouquets were scattered here and there;
bouquets Of flowers filed inches near the affairs;
the white marble pilasters and the higher parts oi
the affairs were gracefully entwined with green
leaves and 70 es Bromide's beautiful painting OF
handsomely framed with green leaves; the picture
over st. Joseph's altar was in the same setting, and
the picture Of the saviour. which Is hung on the
frame concealed with flowers. The fronts OF the
galleries in the transepts were festo0ned with
laurel and fr, the panels being ornamented with
crosses and other embems. Around the fronts OF
the principal galleries festo0ns Of green leaves

tended around But all TINS bright and pleasant

which stood near the Virgins altar, its roof
thatched with straw. .ra


The music at the solemn high mass was especially
grand. The most irreligi0us OF men could scarcely
have heard Mozart's splendid ""Twelfth Mass,"" ""a

sung. At the vespers the church presented q most
imposing appearance. At any hour the sanctuary

music by the various religious cymbals, and, above
all, by the sOlemnity OF the service and the evil
IDENTITY deep devotion OF the numberless crowds
that oil the church in every part. The Christmas
hymn, the ""Adeste Fdeles, was again sung at the
vespers with even better effect than at the high
mass The singers were Miss H0wson and Mrs.
Wiegand, sopranos; Miss Munler, Miss KOhmann
and Miss Conay, contraltos; Mr.. Bernhard and Mr..
Demacht, tenors; Mr.. Colletti and Mr.. Flick.

cal Association. Miss Coney win In future belong
to the regular choir OF st. Stephens and, judging
from her excellent signing yesterday and her ac-
complisnments % musician, she wlll prove
valuable addition.


From the arst high mass, ct halEpast four O'Clock
in the morning winch was celebrated by the Rev..
Father McCready, until that at halfpass ten
O'Clock, the church was literally packed with wor-
shippers. Masses were said every hour or hall
hour between the frat mass and the solemn high
masa which began at half-past ten O'Clock. and at
which the Rev. Father Flynn was celebrant, the
Rev. Father McCready deacon and the Rev. Father
Lynch sub-deacon.


Afser the frst gospel Of the Arst high mass Rev.
Dr.. Mc01ynn preached an eloquent sermon from
the gospel OF the mass. As this congregation was
to great extent composed OF the working classes
the sermon was particularly beautiful, for this
preacher is always best when speaking out freely
the thoughts Of his own mind TO those he loves the
best, who the very poorest Of the poor. II tho
solemn high mass, which began at half-past ten
O'Clock, DR.. McGlynn preached again, this time de-
hvering beautiful exposition OF the Gospel, then
explaining how ""peace on earth"" was to be gained,
aud concluding with loving appeal In behalf or
the OF phans in aid OF whom the collections ct Oil
the masses were taken YESTERDAY."

burg papers send the following sad event
A mother and several little children were
making their escape from a narrow neck
of land, which lies between the river and
the canal, when they were amazed to find
that the bridge was already gone, and
that their only hope was to cling on to
the abutment of the bridge until the
angry waves should subsidc. But as
they stood there clnging to the abutment
the waters continued to rise higher and
higher, while in the deep darkness they
could hear the crashing Of trees amld

wildly dashing all around them. They
had been in this desperate condition fol
some time, when the little girl felt tha
her strength was gone, and with wilc

WEDNESDAY MORNING, APRIL 10, '7s.

Congressional PrOgnostics.",,"O~-~6


In the First District the congressional stu
alton remains practically unchanged since
our last observations. We hear Of no new
candidates ,but we learn something of the
movements of those already announced and
believe that the contest is centering with
in narrower limits. A correspondent in the
Saco Independent over the signature of '.Un-
ion"" thinks we ought to take strong ground
for some one of the contestants. We fancy
that cloud of ''Unions"" would rise up to de-
nounce us should we do so. No, gentlemen,
''hands Off is our motto until after conyen-
ton; then we shall be ready to speak out ana
help the election Of the candidate py every
means in our'power. This we will say, that
the nomination is fully and fairly conceded to
York county and that Mr.. Lynch definitely
and positively declines to be a candidate for
denomination. So that all forebodings of
trouble from this quarter may be set at rest.
We think we could make a pretty good guess
as to the result but refrain from indulging in
an exhibition of our powers OF second sight,
in Difference to our established position of
'benevolent neutrality""


In the Second and Third Districts the re-
nomination and reelection of Mr.. Frye and
Speaker Blaine will be mere matters of form.


In the Fourth District Mr. Peters will un-
doubtedly be renominated without serious op-
position, if he concludes to be candidate
1t is understood that Hon. Lewis Barker has
his eye on the chances, and his movements
through the winter are construed by many as
an indication of his purpose to push his for
tunes in the country and let the city ""gang
its ain gait"" Gen. Hersey will not be can
didate against Peters, but, if the field is open,
ly have an overwhelming strength in the Dis
trict, as he is very popular in all parts.


All indications point to the Fifth District
as the fighting ground par excellence in the
coming campaign. Hon. F. A. Pike is un-
derstood to be donning the war paint and
feathers for the fray, He is man of great
energy, ability and political experience, and
will probably have strong following in
Washington county. Hon. William McGil-
very of Searsport is also spoken of as pros
pective candidate, but as yet we learn moth
ing of his movements. The men, however,
who attempt to unseat Mr.. Hale will have no
sinecure. he is young, vigorous, strong and
brilliant, with splendid Congressional record
behind him. His career has been eminently
creditable to himself, his District and the
State.


So much for the situation now. We shall
endeavor to keep our readers acquainted
with all changes in the political kaleido-
scOpe"

ON ANY LONGER. I'm describing the flood
which was so disastrous to many sections of
Virginia, the Lynchburg papers record the
following very sad and touching incident:


A mother and several little children were
making their escape from marrow neck
of land,"" which lies between the river and
canal They had reached the banks of the
canal when they were amazed to find that
the bridge was already gone; and their only
hope was to cling on to the abutment of the
bridge until the angry waves should sub
side. But as they stood there clingng to the
abutment, the waters continued to rise higher
and higher, while in the deep darkness they
could hear the crashing Of trees amid the
thunders Of bridge timbers that were wildly
dashipg all around them. They had been
in this desperate condition for some time,
when the little girl felt that her strength was
gone, and with wild shrek of terror, she
exclaimed, Kiss me, mother, for l can't
hold on any longer!"" And with the warm
pressure Of that mothers lips upon her
check, she was swept away and was seen no
more."

The meeting of the returning board
was held on Tuesday. Daring the sit
ting Senator Lynch, one Of the members
declared it to be his purpose to reject all
the returns from the parishes snd poll OF
the city which were charged to be fraud
ulent and illegal. 1t did not need this
ultimatum to put Governor Warmoth on
his guard as to an infamous conspiraey
which had been concocted TO cheat this
people Of their rights and re-deliver them
into the hands of the custom-house cor
morants, and he was ready for their plot
Accordingly, when tho board met yester
day, present, Governor Warmoth, acting
Secretary of State Heron, and Senator
John Lynch, tho Governor presented the
certificate Of Auditor Graham, showing
that acting Secretary Of State Heron, be
ing defaulter, he had been compelled
by the constitution and law to suspend
him from the exercise Of his functions,
on charges that would be enumerated to
the Senate, whereupen, on request, he
withdrew from the board.


The commission and evidence Of quail
ilication of Col. Wharton, for the Office,
were presented and hs permitted to oc-
cupy his seat in the board.


Lieutenant Governor Pinchback hav
ing been candidate in the late election,
it was decided he could not act as mem.
Der of the returning boari. The name
Of f. H. Hatch was proposed and accept
ed Senator Lynch voting no. A simi-
lar proceeding was had in the case of Sem
tor Anderson, and his place was taken by
Durant Duponts.


The board being thus completed ac-
cordng to law, will proceed to its du-
ties


Thus has been fo.ed as foul and infam,
Gus conspiracy as was ever concocted
to defeat the people of this State of their
rights, and set aside lawful and honest
election.

The Hon. Montgomery Blair has writ.
ten an important letter TO the Liberal
Republican Central committee OF Balti'
more, pointing out the causes OF the
failure in.the late campaign, and predict
ing the early triumph OF the Liberal
cause. He states that he was early APP
prized from an authentic source that the
money organization Of tho country had
concerted war upon Mr.. Greeley, and
to their influence and expenditure OF
money, and the failure of the Liberal or
gans to accept the issue thus rendered, Inc
ascribes the defeat of the movement
which was in July an acknowledged sue.
cess. He says that the government will
vet be redeemed from the banking, rail
road, credit mobiler, and other parasite
cal interests which were hung upon il
during the war to absorb its powers and
vitality.


THESE PARAsITtCAL INTERESTS
form the nucleus Of the Radical party
1t is its essence, and therefore aplunder'
ing party. We shall have four more
years of plunder. Tho continued growth
Of that miraculous individual wealth wit
messed in the last decade, resulting from
the pervcrsion Of the government to that
object, and q corresponding progress in
the Capitalization Of all the powers ofthe
government. Mr.. Blair further main
tains that the Liberal party will DO con
solidated, and that time only is wanted to
compact the opp si.ioa and restore pop
ular government.


Full returns from a large number OF
counties in Virginia have reached here
and they show that the extraordinary re
suit Of majority for Grant was accom-
plished, not by an increase of the Radi
cal vote, but by the apathy ofthe Demo
Gratis. who, after the October elections re
garded the presidential contest as hope
Tess, and therefore stayed at home. The
vote for Grant in many counties Is far
below that for Well in the gubernatorial
election of 1869, when Wells was beaten
by 1909 majority.


SCOTT VERSUS CAMERON.


The latest sensation is that Colonel
Thomas A. Scott, vice president Of the
Pennsylvania Central, 10 TO enter the
field in Pennsylvania as competitor
with Simon Cameron for the United
States Senate. Col Scott, it 10 under
stood. refused to allow the Pennsylvania
Central road to be used rs a partisan ma
chino to promote Hartranfts election,
and he also resisted Cameron's attempts
to bleed the corporation for his party and
personal purposes


All this Cameron bitterly resents, and
il is reported that he went so far as TO
try, not long since, to have Col. Scott
turned out by the directors OF the Penn
sylyania Central. This effort was an ig'
nominious failure, and now Scott in com
piance with the wishes OF his friends,
has consented to enter tho senatorial
race


LIVELY CONTEST ANTICIPATED.


1t is thought by good judges, that his
chances are fair for beating Cameron. II
the contest goes on, it will be lively ana
severe beyond precedent in Pennsyiva
mia politics. 1t will be Greek meeting
Greek, 40 neither asprant has ever failed
hitherty to control the Pennsylvania
Legislature.

The fraud, corruption and viti;iny OF
Radical rule in Louisiana we have
never doubted and never ceased to de-
nouncc. But the full measure OF the
peoples atflictions have by no one been
iully appreciated and understood. The
crucibie and cork-scrcw of the House
ing to view an amount of official We
nality and turpitudc unparalleled in
the history Of free government, and
that court Of inquiry has only, as yet,
been fcelingi its way to the main en-
trance to the political charnel-housc Of
our State. AS it progresses, it will re-
ceivc new light and procure fresh Sc
crets, which, aggregated, will make up
a panorama of guilt surprising in cnor-
nifty and backncss the widest concep-
ton Of historical fiction.


We present specimen queries and
answers selected from the testimony
taken on the fifth and sixth days of the
Committees sitting. The witnesses
arc all Radicals.


What Isovcc Swears.


This witness is the elected Secretary
Of State.


ELECTION FRAUDS.


q. Were you one of the officers, I'M
der the laws of the State, who counted
the votes?


""A. was one Of the counters and
compil.rs.


q. DO you believe the returns were
ever tampcred with?


A. Yes; sir. Those of the parish of
Ascension, for instance. Two boxes
were brought here, were sent back to
the parish and again sent back to New
Orleans. They decided the contest.
The returnes of the parish of Richland
We're thrown out on the ground that
the Supervisor had been compelled to
leave the parish, it was said, and he
himself appointed his successor. No
new election was ordered, but the
House gave the seat to the Democratic
candidate.


q. DO you know that any of the
Registrars ever returned themselves
elected:


A. think from fifteen to twenty. l
believe the ballot-boXes We're stuffed
that is regular tickets were taken out
and others put in. ! think those Su-
pcrvisors arc not particularly conscien-
tious.


q. DO you know Of any election
frauds perpetratcd when you were Sec
retary ofState?


A. 1 know of nothing positive about
that.


q. Were the frauds perpetratcd in
the interest of the Governor and of his
friends:


\. AS fair as l know all of them were.
q. Did any member of the I4cgiSl;l-
ture tell you he had been offered $500
as {: bribe:


n. Mr.. Turcaud, of the Parish of St.
James, told me he had been offered q
bribc by Mr.. Napoleon Underwood,
Tax Collector of East Baton Rouge,
appointed by Mr.. Warmoth, to sup
port the latter's administration; Mr.
kierson was also approached; so were
Mr.. Bickham and Mr.. B. l.. Lynch
anti-Warmoth), but no particulars
were given. This was on the third or
fourth day following tho meeting of the
Legislature. When ut the NIctrepOli-
tan Club, on Canal street, the witness
| frequently heard gentlemen say that
the Governor was attempting to bride
members.


TIE GONEliNOE'S OrERArONS.
Witness stated that according to rIl-
NOR, the Governor was largely inter-
rstcd in the Slaughterhouse bill. He
heard that the late Mr.. John T.. Dean,
Clerk of the Supreme Court, and h,,s-
band of Mrs. Dean, above referred to-,
us the runorcd mistress of the Cover
nor, and Il friend of his ENcel1ency,
held 1900 shares in the above company,
which, ut par, rprcscntcd $l30,00o.


q. Did you hear that the Governor
had bought those shares or received
them for what he had done in favor Of
the company'


\. In consideration of his services to
the company, it was said also, that the
Governor WAS largely interested in the
s'fi0uting Debt bill, (which authorized
the sale of the bonds ut not less than
% cents on the dollar. The witness had
heard that capitalists were willing to
give moro. The Governor and his
friends held portion of the bonds and it
it WAS rumorcd that everything had boon
arranged before the bill had been
signed."

Swears He Did Not and Defes the


Prosecution TO Prove Otherwise.
THE INVESTIGATION CLOSED AT LAST.


The Senate Committee had another session
yesterday, to hear evidence in the Harlem Court
House job, Senators Temann and weismann being
present Mr.. Parsons appeared for the prosecn-
tion, and Judge Waterbury for the defence. The
defence called Thomas Barry, journeyman mason,
who testified that he worked on the Court House
frst and was paid there; when he worked at
Genet's house he was paid by Q Mr.. Banker and
not by Mr.. Scallon, who paid him when working
1t the Court House. Mr.. Gillian, the secretary OF
the Yorkvlle Bank, recalled for the purpose OF
identifying other checks drawn by H. w. Genet In
favor Of Scallon. The witness remembered that
some Of the city warrants deposited by Genet to
his credit were payable TO ScalOn.


10 Mr.. Parsons-These warrants were used to
keep Genet's account, against which he drew,
good; do not know that the checks were given
Scall0n in payment for Genet's house; know that
Genet had other sources nom which to realize
money to keep his account good besides these city
warrants; have sold bonds for him and carried
the proceeds to his account; at one time sold
$4,000 in bonds for him, some gas stock at another
time, and again some United States bonds; dur
ing the period covered by these checks he depos-
tied warrants; he made no Discrimination be-
tween his private account and the Court House
account.


To Mr. Waterbury-Mr. Genet loans money to
other persons and has many checks passing con-
ttnually; cannot say what extensive speculations
on private account Mr.. Genet was engaged in.


George II. Z. Lynch, Clerk Of the Commissioners,
was recalled, and asked to identity certain vouch-
The vouchers were signed by the Commissioners in
blank; received them from C0rsOn, and returned
them to him after they were so signed by Judges
McQuade and Porter; all said to the Judges was,
""Mr Corson wants some vouchers""


On crossexaminatlon witness said he was un-
Sou e the ca House When wess s drew his
salary eacn time he was willing to perform SER
vices, but neither he nor his son was employed
there.


Mr.. Fl. w. Genet was called to verify his endorse
ments upon some OF the vouchers shown him; he
obtained on the warrants in the building OF his
house or for any other purpose; he testified that
he, never received cent OF any OF the warrants
paid SCall0n money for the erection OF his house,
and positively denied that he had profted In the
House appropriation; witness admitted endorsing
J. Mcbride Davdsons name to warrant
6s his s authority and sIsS drew the
ON account OF the trouble, and witness
then gave it to scallon and told him
for Ingersoll Co.. the manufacturing statoners
and the New YORK Printing Company he had
never seen nor heard OF til he learned y from the
house was his own, aud not farthing Of 1t came
from the city warrants. Witness minutely detailed
his house. naming the parties. Besides the $4,000
paid Scallon between October, 1870, and October,
is71, witness paid Scallon In cash fully s25,OOO
DprhQna cash. He stated that
ator Sandlord came to him and asked to be allowed
to furnish the lumber; witness sent him to the
%as ssSsred to sanaosS which a waess
supposed was contract; SANFORD sup,
s the money and paid it over witness never knew
that Scalon had used any OF the Court House lum-
ber on his house until IT came out in evidence has
paid every demand made for material and work,
and gave Scallon money to pay the men on his
house regularly every two weeks.


On crOss-examinatl0n the witness said that he
procured the passage Of the bin; Tweed suggested
himself ana probably witness suggested the name
Of McQuade; witness did not recollect who sug-
Senator remanns side OF the city: George IL E.
Lynch. George +. Lynch. J: Wesley Palmer Philip
were related to him; They were appointed
without any intervention Of his except In
one or two cases, where he recommended
them; witness had often refused to recommend
his relatives TO ONCE he had always opposed ring
frauds and the practice q giving sinecures 10 per-
Sweeny except what he fought out OF them; one OF
the Commissioners said 1t was advisable to have

counsel without any Intervention ol mis-. Counsel
asked II he was appointed by accident like other
relatives OF his, when witness told him he in
sulting In his questions, and II ne conducted the
would respond to his questions. In regard to his
$4,000 bill for his services as counsel Mr. Genet said
he had paid out money for expenses; he had seen
several parties regarding the lots, but the final
search OF the title was made by Judge Porter for
him. he had also rendered service In selecting the
lots, which he did not like at all, but as they
his opposition; Fairchild had come to him and
urged the purchase Of the lots but witness was
not directly or indirectly benefited by the pur-
chase thereof; witness, through Judge Van voor
hies, paid Mr.. Ainsley $500 for drawing the plans
Scallon was appointed Superintendent OF the Court
House without the aid Of witness; no Court House
material went into his residence, and he paid for
AL OF II; there is y stable on the premises with
some black walnut in It, possibly, but witness could
not tell where the walnut came from, unless IL was
sented in the supply Of the Court House LUMBER
Mr. Parsons submitted witness to q scathing cross
examination that called out more emphatic decar-
alton from witness that every cent OF money he
had obtained from the city on these warrants was
paid to Scallon and Wilson for work on the Court
House.


p. T. Hart, formerly employed as Q mason on the
Court House, testified that men often left there in
different hours OF the day to work ON Genet's
after roll call men named Campbell, May and
Heenny were sent away to Genet's house by the
foreman.


J. X. Harrington testified that Lewis Baker had
inquired OF him where he could get vacant lots TO
pile the Court House lumber and he suggested
LCyd's lots which are close by Genets house; fre-
quently since then he has seen lumber there.


This closed the investigation and the committee
notified the counsel that they would not hear ar.
gument In this city. They might, however. sub.
init argument In writing, and 1t would be embodied

questions which | proposed to him
through Agnes. What was strange
about the matter was that he would never
be intigued in speaking to his little
daughter. But as soon MS she retired to

When asked how he spent the night :

Agnes McDonough received her frs
communion on the first Sunday of Sep

ship the next day. Her brother, who
never went to church since the death o
her father, attends since, and is preparing
for general confession. Strange, tn,

The guardian is convinced that tn,
ordinary spiritual communications ar,
from an intelligence not human, bu
thinks that they are bad spirits, while n
the same time believes with st. August
inc and all the fathers that pure spirit
are sometimes permitted TO revisit tn,
earth for special purposes, and it seem
to think that this may be one of those
special cases, and Mr.. McDonough's 5 spiri
may have been permitted to come back
TO confound the doctrines of modern Spir-
itualsm and indorse the teachings of the
Catholic Church. The Guardtan winds
mp by saying: In this age miracles and

The issues before the people are not new issues
They are the old stories coming up under diersn,

the question. Love OF human power Is the pre-

Others.


Coroner whtehill and jury yesterday afternoon
resumed the inquisition In the case OF Mrs. Row
and her son Franklin W., who died from the effects
OF injuries sustained by the collision on the South.
side Railroad on the evening of the 4th OF July.
The inquest was held In the court room Of Justice
Elliott, Williamsburg.


THE TESTIMONY


Charles W. Douglass sworn, depOsed-I am
superintendent OF the -Southside Railroad: on the
day of the accident we had special time table; 1t
was issued to the conductors and engineers two
days previously; there were two extra trains put
on the road that day; the train that started from
Williamsburg and cOlided with the Rockaway train
was regular train; the time OF it's starting from
the foot Of South Eighth street was q quar-.
ter to five p. NJ. 1t was train No. 16, with John
RathbOne as conductor and James Scott as en-
gineer; its time Of starting from the Bushwick de-
dnctor did not have time to reach the double track
before the Rockaway train arrived 1t was hts duty
to remain at the depot twenty.four minutes; If the
conductor and engineer thought they had time to
reach that point II was their duty to go on; they
e eastern Rde ampe
reach the double track before the western bound
was on the road over two years ago. when took
charge OF it, considered him as good conductor
ts Startling with his train on the
the accident told him nat Conductor Lynch Sa was
Eighth street ONCE; knew that Lynch's train was
time from sSs ssvsa % @ G an Ss
% SoRs knew & that he was Al tee9 3ns minutes Ras,s
Eighth street depot and knew that Lynch was on
time when he reached Richmond Hill; this was suf-
Of the company; It was his duty to remain at the
Bushwick depot until the western bound train came
Minutes IS pas aSs e II It had 1 not arrived arrive ~
Mr.. M J. Lynch, conductor OF the RockaWay
minutes past four p M. and reached the double
track on time at thirteen minutes past five; my
time of arriving at the Bushwlck depot was seven
teen minutes past five; had the right OF way
with twenty minutes to spare; ! was on the
steps of the rear cal, when heard my engineer
whistle to put down the brakes; hurried to the
engineer and asked him what was the matter; he
answered that he heard boy say, Here comes the
nag to be sent ahead and called to the engineer to
back up which he was already trying to do; at that
moment the fireman jumped down and threw gravel
man running down the track with nag In his
hand; nnding that our train could not be backed
hand han and shouting to the coming train but it shot
by me while was standing on the embankment;
sesn in order asTe u R"" ve% o
both trains jumped distance of about fifteen





about four hundred feet ahead OF my engine wav-
ing a large red nag; he remained there until the
to my orders his Nag could be seen down the track
distance o: about quarter OF me from the
time heard that the other train was coming until
the collision about two minutes elapsed; the west
ern bound train passed the fagman before the
whistle TO brake up was given; 1t was then too late
to stop the train at the rate OF speed 1t going
about twenty-eight miles an hour; was on the
Erie Railroad for seven years; have been on the
southside road over two years. and have been rail-
DOVhOOu.


AT seven O'Clock the Jury took recess until
eight


The Jury reassembled at eight O'Clock and En-.
gineer Thomas Cody, OF the ROckaway train, was
the first witness called He testified that the en-
gineer of train going East could see train stand
ing on the switch where the accident occurred
nearly half mile Off, His testimony cOrrObOrated
that of Conductor Lynch.


Adam Eiser testified that he was acting as nag
man at the scene of the disaster: my watch was
three minutes fast by the railroad time; when I
saw the eastern-bOund train coming toward the
Rockaway train held up my hands in warning,
and ran for red nag: this gave TO another man,
who ran down the road and nourshed it while /
attended to the switch when the collision occurred
/ gave all the aid could to the injured.


Newton Schofied testified that he was the tele.
graph operator OF the road at the Bushwick Depot;
was on duty there on H. the NSg evening Of the Attn
reached there about quarter past five; he left
@ there ""a at eighteen minutes past I'VE; told him Sn
that the other train was on tfrne and that was the
James Scott testified that he was engineer Of
train No. 16 OF the SOuthside Railroad. of which
Mr. Rathbone was conductor; at eleven and half
minutes past five O'Clock the evening OF
the 4th Of July Mr.. Rathbone took out his
proper proper i% time OF Of starting from @ that po!S.
(Bushwick depot) three minutes past five; we
started at greater speed than usual, because we
wanted to reach the double track and had only a
minute and half to do il in; was running at the
rate Of between twenty-five aud thirty miles an
hour and would have run faster II ] could; ]
thought could reach the double track in minute
and half but feared that might have to use a
half minute of the iOur minutes that are allowed
for variations in time: consider myself as much
responsible for the disaster as Conductor Ratl
bone; can only account for the collision by be-
lieving that Conductor LynCh's time differed from
Rathbone's; could have made the time that l
attempted to make IL had a heavier engine.


John Rathbone testified that on the evening OF the
fourth OF July ne was conductor on train No 16 OF
the Southsde Railroad; when took my train ont
from the South Eighth street depot at three minutes
before five O'Clock on that evening, superintendent
Douglas told me TO hurry up as Lynch was on time
when reached the Bushwick station saw the tele-
graphic operator there, but had no conversation
with him; Lad no way OF telling when the ROcka-
way train reached the switch except by guessing
when left the Bushwick depot calculated that
| had five minutes in which to reach the double
track, including the four minutes allowed for
variations in time; I had right to use my own
Judgment In that case, as there was no positive
order to the contrary; knew that | was running
at my own risk: the time that elapsed from the
time heard the alarm OF danger to the collision
was not over half a minute: scarcely had time to
think believe that II had made my connection
successfully the superintendent would have justi-
fed me In using portion OF the variation time !;
Conductor Baldwin told me that he used portion
OF the four minute variation time about two months
ago. that superintendent Douglas knew IL and that
nothing was said about 1t; the superintendent was
not present at this conversation; this was not my
regular train 1t was the first time that ever had
occasion to act on the four minute rule


At midnight the investigation was still going on

15_1872-12-24_p4_sn83030313_00271743804_1872122401_1081,The New York herald.,01,1872-12-24,p4,,,"


The citizens of Louisiana charged with the
duty of appealing to President Grant, in the
name Of the State, against the use of federal
power to aid in the overthrow of the regular
State government, having failed in their effort,
have issued an address to the American people,
which will be found in the HERALD to-
day. It is q temperate and dignifed docu-
ment, setting forth without coloring almost
without comment-the facts in the unfortunate
controversy, and abstaining from any reaec-
tions on the conduct or motives of the United
States authorities other than those which are
inseparable from the plain, unvarnished story
of their acts. The committee preface their
statement with disclaimer of any personal
or party interest whatever in the existing con-
test between the rival State governments,
and charge that the reports to the con- /,
trary have been maliciously spread by those
who fear the investigation into the case
courted by the people of Louisiana. So
far from being in any degree in the
service of Governor Warmoth, they show
that they have persistently denounced his
policy during the last four years, and have
been the steady opponents Of all the partisan
and corrupt legislation in which he has had
the support and cooperation Of Lieutenant
Governor Pinchback and others who are now
his enemies. The committee positively deny
any knowledge of o conspiracy to defeat the
will of the people as expressed in the recent
election, and do not believe that such con-
spiracy ever had an existence On the con-
trary their present action is impelled by the
conviction that the persons now usurping
authority in the State through the aid Of fede-
raj bayonets were not elected by tho people
and have no legal claim to Office. The COM
mittee have not however, asked or expected
the federal administration to accept their word
on this point, but have only solicited at it's
hands full and impartial investigation Of the
facts, in order that it may base upon them on
intelligent Judgment of its own. Having thus
cleared themselves satisfactorily from the in
situations put forth by partisan organs as to
the selfshness Of their motives in visiting
Washington, the committee proceed to reca-
pitulate in a clear, concise manner the events
that have occurred in New Orleans since the
election and to show where the responsibility
and criminality rest.


The story is already familiar to the readers
of the HERALD, but it is told so dispassion-
ately and judicially by the committee that it
is worth brief recapitulation here. In the
late election the republican candidates for
Governor and Lieutenant Governor were both
ofice-holders in connection with the federal
administrations the one as Senator Of the
United States and the other rs the Collector of
the Port of Shreveport This fact should be
borne in mind, for it seems to explain and
certainly renders more Objectionable the
subsequent unwarrantable action Of federal
Court in reversing the result Of the election
and placing the republican candidates in
Office through the power of federal bayonets.
The election was q peaceful one; not dis
turbance took place at single poll, and the
vote was unusually large. Every requirement
Of the State laws was complied with, SO far as
the election officers were concerned. The
returns were regularly made to the
Board of State Canvassers, which con-
sisted Of the Governor, the Lieutenant
Governor and two others who were
named in the original law-Messrs. Lynch
and Anderson. At the time the acting Secre-
tary of State was Mr. Heron who had been
appointed by Governor Warmoth in place of
Secretary Bovee, removed some months pre-
viously; but his title to the Office was con-
tested by Bovee and the suit was then still
undecided in the State Courts. Secretary
of State Heron and Mr.. Anderson had
both become disqualified from further
4 tha ~
consequence of having been candidates
for Office in the election, the law and the con-
stitution of the State being both explicit on
that point. The Board, consequently, con-
sisted of Governor Warmoth, Secretary Of
State Heron and Mr.. Lynch, the other two
places being vacant The trouble commenced
at this point. Charges had been made
against Secretary of State Heron which, if
we'll founded, would have warranted
his removal from Office, and at this
moment, according to the statement of the
committee, it was discovered that o conspiracy
existed between Heron and Lynch to falsify
the returns, and, as majority Of the Board, to
declare the minority candidates, Kellogg and
Antoine, together with republican majority
of the legislative bodies, elected To substan-
tate this suspicion it was found that
Secretary of State Heron had, a
few days previously, secretly procured
duplicate of the seal of State to be engraved,
and it was concluded that this could OILY be
for the purpose Of carrying out the object Of
the alleged conspiracy Whether this rumor
was well or i'll founded, Governor Warmoth

removed the Secretary Of State on
the charges already made against
him and appointed Colonel Wharton
to the Office. The new Secretary of State
Immediately took his seat in the Canvassing

Views at Headquarters Regarding tho Elections

The news received at these headquarters fr0m
those States whose elections take place to-day are
very favorable to the liberal cause, and yet 1t is
plain to be seen o decided feeling OF uncertainty
prevails. Notwithstanding the advantages pos
sessed by Buckalew in Pennsylvania democrats OF
betting tendencies are asking odds Of those backing
the republican candidate. Offers OF nifty to seventy
were made at the committee rooms yesterday, and
those who had made bets at even were seeking op-
portunities 10 hedge. Still the members OF the
committee express themselves entirely confident.


Mr.. j. 8. Thayer, who returned from Penn
syvanla yesterday, visited these headquarters dur
Ing the day. He spoke In company with Buckalew
on Saturday and had conferred freely with all the
prominent politicians OF the State. Mr.. Buckalew
expressed himself entirely confident OF carrying
the State by from twelve to twenty thousand ma
lority. He expects large numbers OF quiet citizens
In Philadelphia, depended upon to vote the regular
republican ticket will scratch Hartranft, as two
years ago they did District Attorney Mann, who
ran 10000 votes behind his associates in that CITY,
He believes these scratched tickets viii overbal-
ance any fraudulent votes that may be poled.


Under date OF the fifth Mr.. John g, Thompson
writes that the liberals are sanguine Of electing
their State ticket and carrying all the disputed
On m dste ss
has pOlled an opposition majority Of 1,O6s, he ex-
poets to be elected, and thinks the liberals viii
carry the state beyond peradventure.


From Indiana, the Hon. E. s. Alv0rd, chairman OF
the State Committee writes that the democrats
are certain to carry the state by large majority.
He says huge frauds have been attempted
IN the introduction OF negroes; but the
democrats, warned In time, are protecting
themselves successfully.


Some weeks ago Mr.. schell, President of the Ma
tional Democratic Committee, addressed note to
some OF the leading democrats OF Virginia, urging
upon them the necessity OF opening the campaign
IN that State, and carrying it on with something Of
the old enthusiastic spirit Of lS4O. In response
there has been forwarded to the committee rooms
huge poster, headed,


'vIRGlNIA IN COUNCIL""

which will be addressed by eloquent and
distinguished sons OF Virginia and others.

ments Needed ON Wards Island


and Being Made There.


More than usual interest was attached to the
meeting OF the Emigration Commissioners yester-
day, because 1t was understood that report OF
special committee ON investigating the manage
ment OF the Insane Asylum at Wards Island,
which had been laid over at Q former meeting,
owing to the absence OF President O'Gorman, was
TO be made yesterday. Hence the reporters were
on hand early, and some OF them esssying to enter
the Board room were indirectly, but none the less
unceremontously ordered out again by Mr.. Lynch,
VINO subsequently stated that the Board did moth
ing further after the press men had left. The
minutes OF the Board and OF its several committees
OF former meetings were read and approved. The
salaries OF nurses who have been on the Island for
TWO years and upwards were increased from $12 to
Slt per month, and those who have been i've years
and upwards In the service OF the Board there
rom $12 to $18 per month. The appointment. OF q
man to take charge Of the unatics in the yard, at
$l6 month. was ordered. Mr.. Kaufman an
nounced that he had found lady who would take
the position Of N


GERMAN MATR0N ON THE ISLAND,
lady In every way competent. and whose accept
ance OF the position, indeed. he considered favor





dent there-and he moved for her appointment at
salary OF $4oo year.


Mr.. Lynch opposed, for the reasons which he did
not fully state but which had no reference to Mrs.
Schmidt. The institutions had got along very well
for two years without German matr0n, and he
thought they might continue 80. There are now
three matrons on the island-Mrs. Scully, who has
been twenty-four years there, and Mrs. Molloy, q
few years less. and Mrs. Coss about two years. He,
therefore, moved that this motion Of Mr.. Kaufr-
mans be referred to the Wards Island committee,
with power. Lost. The original motion was then
carried A recess for ten minutes was then taken,
to allow Mr.. O'Gorman to put In an appearance,
and during the recess Mr.. Walach wanted the
Board to request the Wards Island Committee to
instruct the architect to construct the church
now being built on the island that 1t can be en-
ployed for their own use. Mr.. O'Gorman having
arrived, business was resumed by Mr.. Hart calling
up the report Of the special committee on the
AANAGEMENT OF THE INSANE ASYLUM ON WARDS


ISLAND.


There was majority and minority report. The
former was signed by Messrs. E. b. Hart, Chair
man; James Lynch, George J. Forrest and Richard
O'Gorman; the latter by Mr.. Willie Wallach


The majority report sets forth that the committee
commenced the examination OF witnesses on Sep
tember g. ult., and continued it to October s. dur
ing which period they had examined Drs. Henry
Riedel, the physician Of the asylum; George Ford,
the chief physician and John Dwyer, the resident
.erine Sculy, matron Ann Kavanagh, nurse; Pierce
Butler, orderly Of the asylum; and Rev.
Island, in reference to the management
OF the asylum. The report then recites
me circumstances % ogd under which Dr. Medel was ap
rated from the care Of the Medical Board Of the
sland that from that time until the investigation
mitted to the asylum $50 patients, Of whom 337
were discharged or were transferred to other in
died leaving at the date Of the investieation Ies
patients in the asylum Of this number, 1t appears
by the examination. not more than twenty are
under observation.


The details OF the examination SO far as reported
show that the management Of the asylum was all at
loose ends. DR.. Riede complained OF nurses, order.
lies. physicians the chaplain and, indeed, Of nearly
every one on the island or connected with 1t, not
excepting the Wards Island Committee Of the Com
missloners. When he first entered on his duties he
asked for and received ""registers "" and case
books"" but alter few months he discontinued
their use Of his own motion. During his admins
tratiOn OF over two years he had made but six post
record. His reasons for these omissions were con-
Trajectory and OF little worth.


THE TINE DEVOTED TO HIS PATIENTS
according to his own showing was from three
quarters to one hour daily, as regular duty then
he occasionally went around at other times, and
Is shown in one instance in which matron called

terwards, and had not the attendance Of q ply

that he had not made an examination, but had

TWO weeks before but ' had waissa GSese there
| for her betrothed to come and take her to his
home, and at their mutual request the Chaplain
performed the ceremony, and they left and nothing
more has been heard OF them. The Doctor further
more allowed scurvy to break out among the
rather than as preventive, and only when it was
| brought to his notice as remedy by member OF
the Investigating committed T6e Charges of the
Doctor against the Onicias the committee declare
are frivolous and unfounded. The committee ascer-
tanned also that Dr. Reide has been in the habit Of
receiving into the Asylum patients not legally CON-
VIOLATING THE LAW OF THE STATE


and the rules In reference to the reception of in
sane emigrants adopted by the Wards Island Com.
mittee, in November, 1870, and copy OF which he
admitted having received. His excuse is very
present building an asylum though he knew it had
been used as such before and since his appoint
ment.


The committee say further that when the Asylum
was separated from the other institutions under
he care a o the e Medical Me- board It was designed for
now as II is the opinion OF DR.. Shilling the late
consulting physician. and the medical men, that
the separation Is not for the best, and that the
good intended has not been accomplished. The
committee, therefore, recommend the adoption
OF the following resolutions


Resolved, That the office Of Physician of the Lunatic
Asylum be abolished and the Asylum be placed under the
charge of the Medical Board.


Resolved That the Medical Board be directed TO con-
Asylum. -
Resolved That II be recommended to the Wards Island
Committee to increase the number of the Asylum nurses

the mortality In the Asylum from September /,
1869 to September l. 1872 giving the Names date OF
death and the causes thereof. The total number OF
deaths was forty-nine.

EXECUTION


After this confession was made. the
lnfurlated populace were fully deter
mined to lynch the fiend, but some
influential citizens dissuaded them. He
was placed under a strong guard of
some twelve men, who were compelled
to keep themselves secreted during the
whole of Saturday. night in order to
save the prisoner from the hands of the
citizens. On Sunday morning. about
III o'clock, he was taken from the
guard by about 100 armed men and
hung to tree, about a mile and half
from where he committed the deed.
| am told that he was drawn up about
fifteen feet from the ground and choked
to death. So the shadow of that
STOPPING post oak cast its shade over
the termination of the darkest crime
that has ever polluted our soil, and
bears witness that one destroyer of
human life has met his just deserts,
and that the Scriptures have been full,
filled in at least one ""Who-

Singular Fatality-Falling OF tho Walls
at WoodruH q Robinson's Stores-Two
Men Buried I'm the Ruins.


An unforeseen accident occurred yesterday after
noon at the ruins of Woodruff Robinson's stores,
which were burned at the foot OF Amity street on
Monday afternoon.


THE PIRE NOT OUT.


Notwithstanding the untiring efcrts OF the fre-
men and the men employed by Messrs. Beard,
Woodrun 4 Robinson, the ruins are still burning,
and left at the present time the fire would quickly
extend beyond the limits In which 1t has been
thus far confined. Two steamers have been kept
constantly at work and large number Of frepen
have taken their regular turns OF duty at the RUNS
They have been aided by the steamtug John Fuller,
which has three large streams on the fre day and
night.


EFFORTS TO SAVE THE GRAIN.


A portion Of the front OF the stores adjoining
st0rehouse ""An had been left standing, and there
appeared to be large portion Of the grain stored
In this part OF the building. The owners naturally,
were anxious to save all the grain they could and
directed the streams from the tugboat Fuller to be
brought directly to bear upon this portion. They
employed men, whom they term


VOLUNTEER FIREMEN,


to aid them. Yesterday morning gang OF these
men, whose names are John Lynch, Patrick
Mahon, Michael Nugent, Peter Murphy, Thomas
Beatty and - Leverson, were set to work
under the direction OF Mr.. Robinson, brother
OF one Of the owners. A strong wind was blowing
rom the river, and man could not stand upon the
dock and hold heavy, wet hose without becoming
benumbed with the cold. The result was that the
men were compelled TO relieve each other from
time TO time.


The accident was caused by the pressure OF water
and grain upon the inside OF this portion of the
wall, which had been left standing and which tow
cred skyward distance Of seventy-flve feet. The
constant streams Of water caused the grain to
become more weighty, and at last the wall
was forced outward toward the river, burying two
Of the men who were in charge Of the hose beneath
the ruins. Very fortunately the others were at a
safe distance Mr. Robinson, who had charge OF
the men, had


MIRACULOUS ESCAPE


from sharing the same fate OF the two men, whose
bodies are either still beneath the debris Of brick
and beams or in the dock. The accident caused
the most intense excitement among those who
witnessed 1t, and for a time they stood speb0und
with blanched cheeks Any effort to search for the
risk the lives OF those who attempted II.


Mr.. Robinson was fearful that an accident might
occur, occur, and M started to warn the men who were in
feet OF the man who had hold OF the hose when he
heard crash, and he jumped back, just in time to
escape portion Of the wall Weighing about ten
tons. The sinking OF the foundation caused the
outward ends OF the panks OF the wharf to fly up
wards. Leverson, the man who had the hose,


WAS THROWN FIFTEEN FEET IN THE AIR,
and before he came down Mr.. Robinson says the
upper portion of the wall came down upon him.
large portion OF this wall and just where the un
fortunate man stood, was crushed through the
wharf. Thomas Beatty is supposed to be the other
man who is buried beneath the ruins, as he could
not be found when the men were called together
by the foreman. Some OF the men seemed to be OF
the opinion that he did not 60 to work.


STATEMENT OF MR.. BEARD.


Mr.. Beard sad:-Just as the wall was falling
l was looking towards the men on the dock.
Only one man had hold OF the hose ut
the time. The other man was lust
turning to leave and he must have gone down. He
could not have escaped for he was only few feet
from the other at the time the wall came down.


THE CAPTAIN OF THE FULLER INJURED.


The captain OF the Fuller, Mr.. John Rose, who
was also on the dock directing the men, was very
seriously injured. He said when the wall fell he
was walking on the dock and going towards the
man who held the hose. He had called to him. He
was going to see what he wanted when the wall
came down. He thinks there was only one
man killed. He was taken up unconscious and
taken into the cabin OF the canal boat lying at the
pier. An examination revealed the fact that several
OF his ribs were broken and his head was badly
cut. .a


Thomas Nevins, the chief engineer OF the Brook
lyn Fire Department, has been present superin-
tending the firemen most of the time since the fire
first occurred, and he says that he warned these
men frequently to keep a safe distance from this
wall as there was danger of its falling. search
will be made for the bodies or the unfortunate men
to-day.

 The Louisiana legislature undertook to commence it's session, last week, but ow- ing to the quarrels of the Yarmouth and Custom House factions, as they are call ed, quorum of the Senate has not yet been obtained. Gov. Yarmouth has been victorious in the House, notwithstanding the attempt of the other faction to employ the U. s. military force against him. At latest accounts the Custom House faction were absenting themselves in order to leave that body without quorum.

 It was asserted at one time by the Tri- bune and other anti Grant papers that the Custom House party had the Presidents support, but such does not seem to be the case. In this as in former Louisians disturbance, the Administration refuses to interfere. re-ars ,ss..

 A serious riot occurred in Rochester N. r., on Tuesday of last week. A negro named Howard committed an outrage or 1 little white girl. A mob assembled al the jail, determined to lynch him. The military were called out and were guard ing the jail when stones were thrown a them by the mob. A volley was fired il return; two men were killed, and sever wounded, two of them dangerously if no fatally. The firing is said to have beer

 without orders. Further riotswere threat ened but the negro finally pleaded guilty received his sentence, and has been re moved to the State Prison at Auburn. Il In lecture delivered at Boston, Sun day evening, Senator Wilson gave an en

the Ravenswood road when / met Heaney; l
asked him to come and have drink; he
said he wasn't drinking anything now; I
told him to go to he'll; Heancy tried to arrest
me and ran away; Heaney had illfeelings against
me; he fred four shots at me; the last shot
felt; fell from loss Of bood was taken to Asto.
ria in wagon; was afterwards taken home in u
carriage; Heaney shot me In the back; l had no
ill-feeling against Heaney, nor he against me;
was little drunk. ! was shot opposite Solomon d.
Mobiles. Il s~' g q s


Dr.. Denler was employed by engine company No.
to attend Farmer. He says the ball entered the
body one inch below the shoulder blade, passing
directly through the left lung and imbodding itself
In the muscles Of The chest. The Doctor would not
probe the wound, believing that such course
would XIII him. while he can live With tho ball In
the muscles Of the chest.

Heaney's shooting and then called Farmer back.
When he came near enough lIeaney grabbed at

Grants administration on the liberties of the
people and rights of the States. During

and had read by the Secretary list of the
'venal and vile"" p"" wretches appointed by
Grant, through his tool, Judge Woodward,
to supervise and oversee the State election
in New York city, last Fall. We append
the list, and ask our Republican readers to
study the character of the men composing
it, and the while to remember that it comes
with the endorsement of the loyal Repub-
lican, Senator Upton of Nebraska:


The Chief Clerk read as follows:


Theodore, alias Mike Anthony, alias
Snufey, of ""a Cherry street, laborer,
thirtyfve years of age, married, and can
not read or write. Anthony was arrested
by Detective James Finn, of the Fourth
precinct, on July ""a, 1870, for larceny from
the person, and was held in $4,000 bail for
trial by Justice Hogan. He was indicted
by the grand jury on the charge on the 22d
of August last.


Joseph Frazier, of 279 Water street, is a
thief, and confederate of thieves.


James Miller is the keeper of den of
prostitution in the basement of 339 Water
street.


James Tinnigan keeps similar den in the
basement of 337 Water street.
James Sullivan, alias Slocum, keeps a
house of prostitution at $50 Water street,
which is resort for desperate thieves.


Frank Winkle keeps a house of prostitu-
ton at 337I Water street. The police are
frequently called in to quell fights in Wrinkles
place, and it bears hard reputation.
The Radical authorities have appointed
one John, alias Buckley, McCabe a super
visor of the eighth district, fifteenth ward.
He is now under Indictment for shooting a
man with intent to kill. This precious ''su-
pervsor originated here, and was first
known to the police for his dexterity in rob-
bing gemigranls. His picture is in the ""roguc S
gallery at police headquarters in this city ,
No. 225. He was known as Pat Madden,
alias cod Sow"" alias IIonsey Nichols
alias Dennis McCabe His real name is
Andrew Andrews. His wife resides in North
Pearl street, and the ""supcrvisor of the
eighth district, fifteenth ward, New York, is
down in the directory as a citizen Of Albany.


William Lewis is a supervisor in the nine-
teenth ward. He was arrested November
%, 1864, for stealing from Mr. Frederick
Landmann, corner of Third avenue and
Seventy second street, the following prop

RICHMOND, Nov. 4 1872.
Full county returns come In slowly, but from off,
cia and unofcial reports it appears that In forty
two counties and three cities Grant has gained
about $4,000 on the Walker majority OF
1860, leaving about 1000 to overcome in the
remaining ffty-seven counties. The republicans
are now claiming the State by from 5000 to 5000
The heavy gains reported to-day indicate very
marked change in the aspect Of the Congressional
delegation 1t is now claimed by the republicans
that they have not only elected their Representa-
tves in the Second, Third and Fourth districts but
also in the First Fifth and Sixth, leaving only the
Seventh, Eighth and Ninth for the democrats
There is, however, doubt In regard to the First
Fourth and Sixth districts.


A special to the Dispatch from Lynchburg says
that Whitehead (democrat) is elected in the Sixth
district by 200 majority. In Ptttsylvanla and Henry
counties the republican gain is 469 These counties
are in the Filth district, In which the contest be-
tween Davis ldemocrap and Thomas republican,
Is doubtful. Thomas telegraphs that he is elected"
