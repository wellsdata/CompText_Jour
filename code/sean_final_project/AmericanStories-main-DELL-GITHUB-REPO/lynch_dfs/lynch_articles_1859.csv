has recently left Camp Floyd, Utah Terrific
ry, where he has been employed for some time
under the Government. He has been all over
the Territory, and gives most fearful ac-


count Of the state of affairs therein existing.
The Mormons rule every thing with high


hand. No Mormon can be brought TO jus


tice. Gov. Cummings is a mere tool of Brig


ham Young. In fact, Brigham is in every


sense of the word Governor The Gentiies


appeal to Cummings for protection against


the thieving, numbering Mormons, but they


appeal in vain. He eis hand-in.glove with the


whole damnablo horde, and does as they


wish. All adverse representations to the


General Government amount to nothing. Mr..


Cummings is retained in office, apparently for


no other reason than that he is of no earthly
account in the position which he holds


Murder after murder has been committed
in the Territory; the names of the murderers
in many instances ascertained, the witnesses
also discovered and efforts made to bring
them to justice, but the Government itself has
frustrated every endeavor At one time
Judge Cradebaugh instituted proceedings
and with the aid of the military would have
dealt justice upon the heads of the murderers
of peaceful travellers through the Mormon
Territory, but Mr.. Buchanan's Administra-
ton, more anxious to accommodate the Nor
mons than to protect its own citizens, COM
manded Judge Cradlebaugh to desist, and re-
fused him the assistance which he required.
He had the murderers marked, the very
halters of justice around their necks and
nothing to do but to bring toward the wit
nesses and, under the protection of the mill
tary, enforce the proceedings of his Court,
when Mr.. Buchanan's most despcabe Adj
steps in and orders a cessation of
the whole business and virtual release of
the assassns


Mr.. Buchanan knows well what sort of
Governor, Cummings-the tool of Brigham
Young-is making. Why does he not recall
him Because, Mr. Cummings has Support
cd the Administrator"" about is fair |
play, and the Administration must now sup
port him. According to Mr.. Lynchs State
he comes recommended by va
rious letters from high sources as a veracious |
and honorable man-it requires more whis-
key and brandy to sustain him than any
thing else.


Mr. Lynchs report of the Indian Agent, DR..
favorite of the Administra- |
tion is not much better. Dr. Forney-no re-
lation be it understood, of John W. Forney,
the able editor of Forney's Press-according
to Mr.. Lynch is as much friend of the Nor
mons as Gov. Cummings, and has also an eye
TO speculation, selling Government mules and |
other stock at very reasonable prices, con-
idering that the property costs him nothing,
md the profits to his own pockets are clear
gains.


What are we to think of an Administration
that appoints such officers as these ?-that |
permits American citizens to be murdered in |
this cold-blooded and irresponsible manner
that makes friends with Mormon traitors
and rebels as against peaceable, law-abiding
citizens2 VIII such an Administration be
rebuked by the people? 1t remains to be
seen."

statement as TO the circumstances connected
with the Mountain Meadows Massacre, says:


Many of the leaders are well known John
D. Lea was the Commander in Chief; Presi-
dent Height and Bishop Smith in Cedar City,
and, besides these, one hundred actors and
accomplices are known to Judge Cradebaugh
and DR.. Forney. Some of those implicated
are and have been in the confidence and un-
der employment of the Superintendent of In
dian Atfairs-Bishop Hamblin. for instance,
who is employed by DR.. Forney, among the
Indians down South, who knows all the facts,
but refuses to disclose them."

narrowly escaped lynching when he was

Statesman of the 28th of December reports
the lynching of Reinhart, the peddler, who
murdered the man from Worcester (Bodell of
Leominsterl, some time since If the States
mans report is correct, the affair was one of
the most horrible of the kind on record Thir-
ty or forty men broke into the Jail at Lexng-
ton, in spite Of sheriffs and deputies. AT their
approach, says the Statesman, the poor wretch,
Reinhart, inspired with the strength of des-
perate man, tore his right hand free, through
heavy gyve of iron, and seizng the leg of
cast iron stove, stood at bay with his face to-
wards the door Being tall, muscular man.
the lynchers, for a while, dared not enter
After short consultation they tore down the
gable end of the log jail and assailed him in the
rear. Finding all hopes of resistance vain,
Reinhart lost all heart, and fell upon the floor
IN nit Taking the senseless body in sleigh,
the whole party proceeded out of the village,
mile and half, and attaching a rope to his
neck, threw it over tree and hauled him up
The moose was not tight, and the lynchers
lowered the body to adjust it more securely.
Reinhart now came to his senses, sprang to his
feet and earnestly asserted his entire innocence
OF the murdered Bodell. Seeing that their
ears were closed against his entreates, he
changed his tone, and declared his readiness to
die. AT his request bystander was called on
to pray, and after short prayer the murderer
was again hauled up."

takes its name from the stern and sum-
mary act of one James Lynch Fitz-Ste-
phen, merchant of the Irish town of
Galway, and, in 1926, its mayor or war;
den. The son of this Lynch Fitz-Ste-
phen, having committed foul murder,
his father, exercising his authority as
warden, had him arrested and brought
for trial before himself. The father, on
conviction, Brutus-like, sentenced his
son to death, and fearing rescue from
the prison, caused him to be brought
home and to be hanged before his own
door.


The American system of Lynch Law
began in what is now known as the
Piedmont country of Virginia, which was
at the time the western frontier, and
having no law of its own, and being
seven miles from the nearest court of
criminal jurisdiction, controversies were
constantly referred to men of sound
judgement and impartialty in the dis
trict, whose decisions were regarded as
final. Prominent among these was a
man whose awards exhibited SO much
justice, judgement, and impartiality,
that he was known throughout the
country as Judge Lynch. In the course
of time criminals were brought before
him, and he awarded such punishment
as he considered just and proper


There were otherpersons, in different
districts, who acted as arbitrators, and
who awarded punishments but Judge
Lynch was the most conspicuous, and
consequently the system took his name,
and was called Lynch Law This was
a compliment to his integrity and high
character."

said to be great excitement in NorthumGer-
land county, Va, in consequence of the dis
eovery of cruel murder. The Alexa ldria
Sentinel has the following particulars of the
affair:


There had been party of persons engaged
in tratficking with servants for stolen goods,
and they carried it to such an extent that the
community, in selfdefence, determined to
put stop to it, and held a public meeting
and passed resolutions notifying the perpetra-
tors of so much evil to dispose Of ther erproper-
ty and leave the county in II limited time,
and generously provided to secure them a
ganst loss in case they had to sell at a sacri,
flee. The time appointed arrived, but they
still remained, when number o. persons re
paired to the premises of one of the party,
and in approaching the house discovered
signs ofa scuffie having taken place, and up
on examination found short distance off the
remains of colored man, in Il horribly lacer
9el condition, covered over with dirt.


After the body had been found a man, who
lives in the neighborhood testified that he
had been a witness of the murder, and had
been deferred from revealing it by the threat
of the murderers. lie said that several days
before, as he was passing by the place, he
heard the cries and groans of person appa-
rently in great agony, and upon leaving his
wagon and going to the spot whence they
proceeded, he found the colored man suspen
ded to a tree and the persons mentioned cut
ting him in pieces with branches of switches,
and had at the same time fire burning un-
der him, and that he cut him down as soon
as he could but too late to save his life as he
died soon after, suffering intense pain. lie
also said that there were some free negro ac.
completes, who cut the switches with which
he was scourged. They were Immediately
arrested and given nine and thirty on their
bare back and ordered to leave the county.
The excitement was so great that many were
in favor of lynching the demons who com
mitted the foul act, but law and order pre-
vailed, and they were handed over to the
authorities, who committed them to Jail to
await the judgment of the law. The reason
given for the commission Of the deed was
that the negro, with whom they had been
trading, had informed against them His
name was Bill, and he belonged to George
Brent The coroner's inquest brought in a
verdict that the deceased was whipped to
death, and duplicating four men named
Blackery, and two others named Coleman
and Marsh, in aiding and abetting in his
death."

Gentlemen that believe in this system of ethics, will please bear in mind that when an Indian kills white man we hang him. and my opinion is, if white man kill an Indian no matter whether he is member of the Shan non, or member of the Conway family, he ought to be hung--the law demands it, the good, yes, the preservation of society, demands it, and justice cries aloud for it. 1 am glad |thet the gentlemen who conducted the prose- cution done their duty indeed, Messrs. Wilson and Humphreys deserve unqualified praise >for the skillful manner in which they met and overthrew the abominable sophistry of their ingenious opponents. am glad that the judge and the jury done their duty, as it will prove to the world that our courts of justice are above Fuspcion, as to whether the guard done their futy, let the public pronounce judgment-the Fery dogs who were assassinated with the guard nust have been bathed in Leathe that eyen- Pg. hope the ""powers that be-"" will see be necessity of having good substantial fail uilt at Van Buren.

Net increased letter postages on Europen mails, S82,749 p.

 Speaking of the European and American postal arrangement, the post master general says:

 ""The want of regularity heretofore has had the effect to give the advantage to the British lines. The evidence is now before me- that of the correspondence, for instance between the United States and Switzerland, out of 5 GOO let ters, 4,SO0 were transmitted by British vessels, owing, 1t is believed. mainly to the circumstance Of the known regularity of these vessels in sai- Ing on given day.

 As calculated to furnish the requisite facili. ties of communication between Europe and the southern and southwestern states, the proec- ted llne between Norfork and England and be- tween New Orleans and Bordeaux, in France, are amongst the most important to be establish ed 1t Is unnecessary to point out the advan- tages these lines would be certain to have in developing the resources of those states THev could not fail to be otherwise than highly satis- factory. The extortlon of the Panama railroad company for charging SlO0OOO for conveying the United States mail only AS miles, is noticed good portion of the report is devoted to the New York and New Orleans route. bv which the mails were to be conveyed in Az days, via Richmond, Lynchburg, Chattanooga, Grand Junction and Jackson, Miss. Going south, the schedule contemplated the running of cars by night from Canton to New Orleans: but the early appearance of the yellow fever, as an epidemic, and its great vrulence, inter. posed as serious obstacle in the way of this service, the railroad company considering it ru- nous to their interests to approach the infected district, except during the day time The mails were thus necessarily delayed over night 02 hours) at Canton, aud delivered in New Orleans twelve hours behind the stipulated time. As surances have, however, been given that such delays shall no longer continue, and it is not doubted that the contract schedule will soon be fully compiled with, insuring the delivery of the mails from Washington at New Orleans within four and half days.

 The parties to the foregoing arrangement have further stipulated that from and after 1st July next, the time shall be reduced twenty tour hours, making the communication between Washington aud New Orleans in three days and a half, or between New York and New Or leans within four days; going from Lynchurg to Gordonsvllle and not touching at Richmond The experiment of having express agents to go through with large mails long distances has proved highly successful. The Tehauntepec route IS also noticed as being a complete sue cess. The pay on this route from New Orleans to San Francisco Is S296OO0 per annum-time | b days.

 | The franking system is appropriately mo- tced-and 1t IS proposed that in lieu of the tranking privilege now allowed by law to mem bers of Congress, the secretary of the Senate and | the Clerk ot the House, or such other officer as may be designated for the purpose, furnish the members with postage stamps to be used on all letters, public documents, and packets trans mltted by them in the mails, and keep an ac- count ot the stamps furnished to each member, to be paid for out of the contingent fund of each House. It is further proposed that all letters and packets, except newspapers address cd to members of Congress, shall be prepaid at the mailing office.

 The postmaster general advocates the raising ot the three cent rate upon all letters to five cents, and the abolition ot the discount now a- lowed by law for the pay ment of newspaper and pamphlet postage quarterly in advance."

About 10 o'eots the loud screams Of Mvs. Meyers
were sgsin heard and her cries, which continued some
time attracted considerable notice from those residing
in the immediate ueighborhood. 10 about quarter
of an hour Thereafter al became silent in the sp,r
ucnts Of Meyer, and nothing was heard or sen
o. them during the morning.


At O'Clock in the afternoon, the neishbors, who
had heard the unusual cries of Mrs VI. began to sus-
pect that something was wrong. and several with
view Of satisfying themselves the subject, went to
Mey,rss rooms and krocsed on The door. No reply
was returned, when they knocked again and again,
but received no answer. As !. was known they bal
not gone cut the neighbors felt convinced that





have the matter investigated.


Policeman Fischer Of the Sixteenth Precinct was
called ir. and all the circumstances that had trans
p,red were related 10 him. The officer TO the door
ard demanded admittance but received no reply.
After knocking for while Meyers called out


Who's there T. and upon being told, said, I'm IN
bed and do not wish to be disturbed. Without
further parley the officer burt open the door, when
most horrible and sickening sight was presented to
liz gaze. Tie dead body Of Mrs Meyers, in state
Of nudity, lay upon the floor near the stove. She
wa covered with bruises ami cuts from head TO foot
From her mouth, nose aud were streams
Of o.sgulated blood, and on her head,
breast. arms and legs were innumerabie
cuts or stabs. Her hair, which had been cropped
off close to her head, found IN the stove partial
y consumed, and il seemed to be the impression ot
those who frst looked upon the scene that the hend
had determined upon burning the body. Near the
corpse stood pail Of bloody water and IT was appa-
rent that Meyers after the perpetration of the deed
had busted himself in wping up the floor, which was


literally covered with blood. The eating of OF his
vifes hair. and the cleansing up Of the blood from
| the foor seemed to be the fret move that Meyers
had made toward concealing the evidence OF his
crime.


TIE officer and neighbo upon entering the room,
found Meyers standing before locking glass brush


ing hi. hair. He turned quickly, and remarked to the
officer She struck first and further sal that he


was fixing himself up to go to the Staiionliouse to
surrender himself to the suthorltIes.' Ohicer
Fischer took Meyers in custody and conveyed him to
the Sixteenth Ward StationIiouse where the mur
derer WAS committed to a cell to await the acton OF
The Coroner. On the way to the S,aton-ilouse the
officer and his priioner followed by large aud
excited crowd, who would not have needed much
| urging TO seize the fend and lynch him upon the
spot


Tpon Il further examination of the scene ot the
tragedy smoothing iron and large pair ot shears,
both of which were covered with blood, were
| found The supposition il, that Meyers and his
wife first commenced quarrcling when he struck
| her causing the first ouicry, and that she then
prepared breakfast, and went into theyard to
empty q pail Vi water. The quarrel must
| have been subsequently, resumed In the course
Of which Meyers again attacked his wife,
beating her with his fists. She fought back, and
| screamed for help, when the fend, to silence her
struck her with the iron, and then stabbed her with
| the shears.


Meyers occupied two rooms, one large and the other
small and the entire premises exceedingly filthy

has repeatedly been apprehended, but has as otten
been discharged as she interceded for him with the
magistrate before whom he vas taken She has aso
been locked up in the staton-House for drunkenness

State Prison for being concerned in the death Of a

MASSACRE OF EMleRANTs on THE PLArNs.-
Mr., James Lynch, who arrived at San Fran
cisco on Tuesday night, from Camp Floyd
Utah Territory, which place he left on The
llth instant, furnishes the Bulletin with an
account of a recent massacre of emigrant:
Dy the Indians. The massacre occurred
about fifty miles this side of the junction Of
the Fort Hope road with the Sublettes Cut
Off The Bulletin says


A small party of immigrants, who were
journeying along on their laborious road to
California, were forced to stop at the above
point to look after sick horse. While they
were thus halted, they were suddenly fired
into from some broken, rocky ground, where
the Indians had been lying in ambuscade
Five of the immigrants were killed outright
OF these, two were brothers, named Shep
pard; another was named Wright--but the
names of the other two who were killed ar,
not known. At the same time the five wer,
killed, Mrs. Wright (wife of one of the slain
was pierced by ball, aud fell, apparently
dead. She had an infant in her arms. On,
other man was also badly wounded, and was
left by the savages for dead.


The Indians, after seeing that all the whites
were thu apparently killed, came up to the
train and robbed the wagons of what they
W e and corrOlledlthe cattle. They snatch
ed the infant from the arms of its bleeding
and seemingly ffeless mother, and hurled il
in the air, SO that it fell stunned upon a
legged rock. They then left, driving with
them the animals of The whites. They killed
and wounded lay is hours exposed to the
sun and the attacks of the wolves. At the
expiration of that time another train provi-
dentially came up. Mrs. Wright was found
70 be still alive; so was the infant child
though its leg had been crushed, either in
the grasp of the inhuman savage, or against
the less flinty stones. Besides these, one man
was found to be breathing. The new com
ers upon the horrible scene proved them
selves good Samaritans All that was posi-
ble was done for the restoration of the
wounded. When Mr.. Lynch overlook this
party on the road, the wounded man and
infant were regarded as out of immediate
danger. Mrs. Wright was yet in critical
state. The opinion was that she would die"

The Mountain Meadows Massacre.",,"The Salt Lake correspondent of the Bulle.
tin furnishes that paper with the following
statement made by John Lynch. who accom-
panied DIR. Forney the Superintendent of
Indian Affairs, to Mountain Meadows in
search oil the surviving children of the


Mountain Meadows massacre.


About three months since, I started 70 90.
TO Arizona. When / arrived at Nephi I Wa


overtaken by DR.. Forney the Indian suner-
intendent, who was going to the Mountain


Meadows for the thirteen surviving children


of the Mountain Meadows massacre lie
! told me he was doubtful about the Mormons


he had with him, ana asked me if would
assist him in case they deserted him. NV


party consisted of twenty-five men. When


the Doctor arrived at Beaver CITY, as was
anticipated, the Mormons deserted without
apprizing him of their intention-supposin9


that he would be unable to 90 further in his
unassisted condition. found him about II
o'clock at night guarding his mules-told
| him to go TO bed, and would relieve him.
persuaded two of my party to assist me:
and with their aid. drove his teams down to
the Mountain Meadows, and gave up nv in
tention of going further south. We pursued
our course to Parrowan. In this place,
which is inhabited almost entirely by Eng
lish and Danes-as are most of the southern
settlements-the greatest hostility was evinc.
ed towards us. The people would hold no
communication with our party, and spoke in
the most insulting terms of the Americans,
as they designate all who are not Mormcns.


We continued our journey to the Meadows.
passing through Painter Creek and Cedar
City. The scene Of the massacre is broad,
level meadow, encompassed by chain of
hills. Upon careful inquiry, We learn that
the emigrants had been harrassed by bands
ct men, whom they supposed to be Indians,
during their journey from Cedar City to the
Meadows, and, at the latter place, made a
corral Of their wagons for defence. The
corral was near spring which is the source


of a small stream running through the plain.


Words cannot describe the horrible picture


which was here presented to us. Human
skeletons, disiointed bones, ghastly skulls
/ and the hair of women, were scattered in
! frightful prOfusion over n distance of two
miles, Three mounds, partially exposing
! the remains of some of the murdered indi-
Gated the careless attempt that had been
| made to bury the unfortunate victims We
remained two or three hours at the Meadows
and occupied ourselves iu burying the un.


covered remains OF the massacred.


This done, we proceeded to the residence
of the man Hamblin, n Norman, in whose
possession the children were. We found


them in a most wretched condition. half
starved, half naked, filthy. infected with ver-
min, and their eyes diseased from the cruel
! neglect to which they had been exposed
/ After three days at Santa Clara, where
clothing was made for the children, we re-
turned with Hamblin and ten Of the children
] Il al 1T Il ~
another at Painter Greek When we passed
through Beaver City, some of the Mormon
men hooted at the children, and called them
the survivors of Sebastopol and Waterloo.
| Among the children are some who retain a


very vivid impression of much connected


with the massacre. very intelligent little


girl, named Becky Dunlap, pointed out to


me at Santa Clara an Englishman named


Tellus, whom she says she saw murder her


father She also states that Hamblin's In


dian boy killed her two sisters. Both she


and a boy named Miriam recognized dresses


and a part of the jewery belonging to their


mothers, worn by the wives of John d. Lee,
the Mormon Bishop of Harmony. The boy,
! Miriam, also identified his fathers oxen,
which are now owned by Lee. The two
! oldest boys told me that after they had been
fighting for eight days during four of which
tncy were III the corral, from whence the
water had been cut Off Bishop Hight. of
Cedar City, came into the corral, and told
the emgrants that the Indians did not want
anything but their cattle, and that if they
would lay down their arms their lives would
be spared. They did so, and started to go
to Santa Clara, when they were attacked by
a mixed party Of whites and Indians, and all
killed except the children. The boy Miriam
stated, that after the massacre was over, he
saw the Bishop of Coal Creek washing the
paint from his face, which he had used to
disguise himself as an Indian


The man Hamblin seemed perfectly con-
versant with the circumstances of the massa-
ere, and told me that at one time he had a
good many of the cattle in his possession. A
Norman named Ira Hatch also told me that
he found the only man that escaped about
one hundred miles from the Meadows, per-
cuaded him to return with him, but when
they had gone about forty miles, the Indians
murdered him in his presence.


There were Is wagons $40 head of cattle,
and l43 persons in the train. 1t is supposed
there was also great deal of money, as the
Mormons say it was the richest train that
ever crossed the plains believe DR. For
ney to be acquainted with all the crcum-
stances ! have narrated."

 THE RAILROAD FROM DEvALL's BLUFF TO LITTLE RocK.-We clip the following from the Little Rock Gazette and Demo- crat of Saturday, the l4th inst, that our readers may be kept posted in reference to the building of this road

 CONTRACTS FOR CLEARING AND GRADING THE MEMPHIS RoAD.-We have been shown, by Capt. Lynch, the accomplished Chief En- gineer, the profiles and maps of tho third divi- sion of the Memphis and Little Rock Rail road, from White river to Little Rock. They may be seen at the office in this city, over the post-office and, by consulting them, very thorough knowledge of the road, and the coun- try over which it is to pass, can be acquired.

 By reference to our advertising columns, 1t may be seen that Capt. l.. invites proposals for clearing and grubbing this road, and grad ing and throwing up its bed, between the Ar kansas and White rivers. Contractors are in- vited to specify the amount of pay they desire in money, and the amount in stock, as well as to make proposals for pay in all money or all stock. There is no doubt now of the building of this road--its completion is only question of time. Its advantages to the country are so manifest, that we need not argue that question before the people now.

perfectly riddled with rne balls and bucksho 10 was
nothing more nor less than case Of lynchlng, per-
formed in rather more sudden and summary manner

A Dispute about Lots Wife.",,"


Two old gentlemen farmers, Isaac Gerald and
Billy Hodge, remarkable for their mutual friend
ship and social habits, were sitting one day on
bench in the piazza of retail grocery, with a
couple of silver dollars on the seat between them.
Both had on their spectacles and were busily
engaged in turning with great care and scrutiny
the leaves of a small Bible they had just pro-
cured from the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit
or Superior Court, as it is called in Georgia.


Ihe lids OF the sacred volume had been worn
or torn of, occasioning many dog-ears at both
ENDS, showing evidently long and hard usage.


Each gentleman seemed anxious to have the
Dook tor the time being, while each seemed de-
terInined that the other should not be so exclu-
slve After most unsatisfactory examination
both participating Gerald ierked the book from
Hodge, with evidentsigns ofimpatience saying ::

let me alone. | read all about it many a time
when 1 went to school. | tell you it's in the
Psalms of Moses, who writ and sung all about

tuition, and if eyerfound, twill be in Revelations
What did Moses know about the 'Postle Paul and
his family arrangements | allow he was a
right sharp old gentleman and could look into
circumstances about to crowd him as far as any
one in his day. But the dark ages, which, they
say, was as black as night without stars, me
teors, OF lightning-bugs, come atween him and
raul and he had no specks, magnifying- glass,
or telegraph, could see through or work in them
tunes. tell you, Gerald, you amt nowhar with
me in Bible larning""


The person thus tainted had been anxiously
searching the Psalms, and had paid very little
attention to his companion; had an indistinct
idea something had been said about dark ages
or dark nights but distinctly comprehended the
lnvidious comparison instituted between his
Biblical knowledge and Hodges Raising his
eyes from the pages he had been so closely
scanning, and showing his spectacles to the top
of his head, he looked piercingly into the face
of the other


Whar was you brung up, Billy Hodge
Whar eddycated? All l recollect now the eve
ming you went through college You staggered
INTO one end drunk, and the boys kicked you
out the tother! l s'pose you thought that was

course the same time, but declined. But that is
neither here nor thar. What about the time YOU
said they had them dark nights wouldn't

1 never could account for it; have looked plum
thru the almanick several times to see how it
was But this amt settling our bet. | want to
handle the rhino; know I've got you Yon-
der Is Bob Logan, the Clerk; l reckonhe mout
take this book and look up the passage""


Hodge heard nothing Gerald had Just said,
except his allusion to the Clerk ETC. for as soon
as the latter had ceased his search among the
Psalms, he seized the Bible, and commenced
looking through Revelations.


Helloa, Loganr continued Gerald, "" come
here"" When this official approached he pro-
oeeded: q and Hodge has made bet. He
stands me silver dollar it was Paurs and not
Lots wife which was turned to a pillotc of salt
We've been ransacking this old Bible, princi-
pally Psalms and Revelations, and can't find the
place what treats on that toppack. Now, old
fellow, just be kind enough to take your old
Bible and settle this matter atwixt US""


at is no use to take the Bible"" said Logan.
81 thought every Sunday school boy and girl
knew it was Lots wife they rubbed the brine
into so extensively. They used the article so
freely IN the operation, it has preserved her safe
and sound through all seasons, years and ages.
Captain Lynch reports it was but the other day
he saw her standing in the suburbs of Sodom or
Gomorrah-one, he could not tell exactly which;
but she was there, salty as ever, with the smell
OF fire and birthstone around her As for the
Apostle Paul, if ever he was married it was q
clandestine affair; his biography and autobiog-
raphy are silent on that subject and reckon
that is an event a would never forget,
whether fortunate or unfortunate, though his
friends might""


It's my money! shouted Gerald, and he
was about raking the silver, when Hodge caught
his hand


Not so fast, if you please; | have seen sicker

thing-he is like me and you; if all he did not

On the next day Cosgrove sent to be washed, portion of bloody clothing. On Sunday he was ar rested. A slungshot in Cosgrove's pos session confirmed the impression that he had first struck Lester with that, and fail ing to kill him, or render him senseless, had then stabbed him to silence his cries.

 On Sunday great excitement prevailed, a large meeting was held in front of the mar ket-house and strong demonstrations were made in favor of lynching the accused, but after several addresses, wiser and better counsels prevailed and Cosgrove remained in jail.

 This is the first instance in the history of our city, and the second or third in the State, of a murder being committed for the sake of money. In this case, the amount of the booty was less than hundred dol lars. The body of young Lester has not been found, though diligent search is being made for it and reward of $200 offered by the mayor for its recovery.

 In this instance, both the parties, the SUD- posed murderer and his victim, were not citizens of Arkansas. 50 of late mur- der case at Fort Smith, the parties were non-residents

 Our State has an ill-deserved name abroad for violence and as being the thea tre of bloody deeds, when, in truth, we are less guilty in that respect than others Hence it is with regret that we chronicle such foul and bloody murder as the one alluded to above, where the murdered man was induced by fellow boarder to take a walk and then cooly slaughtered for pitiful sum of money."

NEW CONSTITUTIONAL MEETISG-THE WAR.
From our Special COr,.pOndsnt


LAWRENCE, X. T., Feb. 3, 1853.


Yesterday bill passed both branches of the Leg.
isature for Constitutional Convention. There is
to be an election for delegates the .bird Monday
in March. At that election the people are to vote
on the proposition as to whether they want Con-
stitoton or not which is TO be the instruction 10
the delegates. The Convention is to meet at Wy
ando', and it will be the Wyandot Constitution.
The bill that has passed was the frat introduced.
The other bill complying formally with all the re-
quiremeLts Of the gish bill, was introduced late
and never acted on. The legislative session is
drawing TO close, and fear was entertained that
no bill for Convention would be got through, SO
the fret bill under consideration was taken up hur-
riediy ard run through.


There was very excited meeting 10 Lawrence
last night. The hall where the lower branch of
the Legislature meets was crowded-ihe Hon. Ben.
Hardihs the Doniphan member for the Council, in
the chsir. 1t took into consideration the recent
inyasons and kidnapping from Missouri. Speeches
were made by number "" gentlemen, among them
Messrs. Lsne, Vaughan, seD., Rue, StedTns, SOulie
Cultifs and Phillips. 1t was called in hurry as IA
meeting of the fighting men Of 81. Very hery
resolutions were introduced and considered, bat
the meeting adjourned until tonight. The most
remarkable eyentwas the presence of Whitley, one
OF the Territori1l accomphces Of the Missouri party
that abducted boy. he desired to speak, when
Mr.. Willis and others, fearful that he designed ~
take tie opportunity IL SANDER Dr. boy or his son,
who are III the Platte Jail, refused 10 hear hun
unless he would make clean breast of it, and
state "" hO his aceomplces were. There was a con-
siderable scene. Gen. Lane spraDg upon the table
and demanded that the meeting resolve Itself into
q jury, and tTNthe kdDapper. Intense excitement
followed. The doors Were closed, ""a prevent his
escape, and the chances of his paying the penalty
of his roguery with hs life were very imminent
As ne had been arrested, examined and regularly
bound over, many thought il would be improper at
that tine g. lynch him. Mr.. Vaughan protested
against the motion of gen. Lane, but was evidently
in Il minority. Philips made motion for a con-
nl.tee Of five 10 receive written confession from
TIE culprit, and submit the sane 10 subsequent
meeting with their report. This carried, and
one OF the st0rni-st popular meetings in Lawrence
adjourned.

I THE LAWS sOUTRAGEDli'

RINEHART LYNGHED -
BY A MOB OF 80 OR 40 MEM!",,"Our readers will doubtless be startled to
learn from the following communication, that
q party of men, disregarding the supremacy
Of our laws, and assuming the power of both
Judge and Jury, entered the Jail at Lexing-
ton, LIE Sueur County, where Rinehart was
confined for the murder of Boden, on the 9th
inst, took the prisoner out, and lynchcd him,
within short distance of the town:


LIE suEuR, Dec. %, 1858.


DEAR GREEN: The village of Lexington, in
this county, has been the theatre of a scene
Of retributive justice, which, however desti-
tute of law and order, nevertheless shows the
rough American idea of rewards and punish.
ments, in forcible light.


About ten o'clock on yesterday morning, a
mob of thirty or forty men, mostly hailing
from Rice County, arrived at Lexington, and
demanded the keys of the prison in which the
murderer Rinehart was confined. The efforts
of the Sheriff and his Deputy to preserve the
dignity of the law were in vain, and the jail
was soon opened. The poor wretch, inspired
with the strength of desperate man, tore
his right hand free, through heavy gyve of
iron, and seixing the leg of cast iron stove,
stood at bay with his face towards the door.
Being tall, muscular man, the lynchers, for
a while, dared not enter After short con-
sultation, they tore down the gable end of the
log jail and assailed him in the rear Finding
all hope of resistance vain, Rinehart lost all
heart, and fell upon the floor in fit. Taking
| the senseless body in sleigh, the whole par
| ty proceeded out of the village mile and a
half, and attaching q rope to his neck, threw
it over tree and hauled him up. The moose
was not tight and the lynchers lowered the
| body to adjust it more securely. Rineharl
now came to his senses, sprung to his feet and
earnestly asserted his perfect innocence of the
murder of Bodell. Seeing that their ears
were closed against his entreaties, he changed
his tone, and declared his readiness to die
At his request bystander was called on pray,
and after short prayer the murderer was
again hauled up,


| Public opinion has not yet experienced q
reaction, and nine out of ten men in the county,
around Lexington as well as in the village
consent to the justice of the execution
Waving the possibility Ga very slender one)
of his innocence, it seems unfortunate for us
to possess so little confidence in our govern
ment, as to take its work into our own hands
Still it requires very keen vision to discern
the majesty and supremacy of the great un
written principles of law and justice in the
summary proceedings of Judge Lynch him

vengeance to be the proper attribute of the

The desperadoes who murdered him are al

county; but we doubt not this is only
= pretext to remove the onus of the
bloody. deed off the people of LIE Sueur coun-

ted total depravity"" of the vicinage-to ex-
ecute this, their rsusnge, upon helpless pris-
oner.


We rejoice that there does not appear to
have been any such mockery of a trial, as on
his first arrival there, was said to have taken
place prior to his reported lynching at that
time. We are glad that no humbug ""color
of law"" and fairness, was resorted to on this
murderous occasion.


The act stands out, therefore, in the bolder
relief, without any such miserable palliation
for feeble minds to rest upon while they are
family justiying the atrocity.


Had mob, when he first arrived in LIE Seu-
er county-under the immediate excitement
of the moment-then hung him up, some lit
tie excuse could have been offered for the
bloody deed. But even thep 1t would have
been an outrage of the FIRST magnitude
The people of LIE Seuer county originally invok-
ed the far reaching arm of the law to pursue
supposed murderer-that arm, at their in
stance, seized hold of him, bringing him
through several communities in public man.
ner, in the custody of their own Sheriff: The
people Of LIE Seuer county in this manner
entered into solemn bonds as it were to
those several law abiding communities, that
the law in LIE Seuer county, and that the peo.
pie of LIE Seuer county, aoould protect him
until he was adjudged through all the sacred
forms of legitimate law to have forfeited his
citizenship and his life, and that after fair
trial by jury of his country. This was the
pledge the people of LIE seuer gave the world
gave to us of ST. Paul-when we allowed hel
officer to take him through our city under the
muzzle of his revolver. What have they
done-how have they redeemed their pledge
Their obligations to the laws, TO other com
munities, to the reputation of the State and
her people, have all been recklessly tramplet
under foot, in their eagerness and blood-thrst
mess, simply and solely for recenge.


We confess to have had our suspicious O.
what was intended, when we heard that {
temporary Jail was erected to confnc hin
amidst themselves for trial, instead of follow
ing the example of other counties in regard t.
their criminals, and sending him to Stillwatc,
or to some secure Jail elsewhere to be held il
safe custody until his time for trial came.


But they never intended to try him. 1t i.
scarcely to be doubted that the design of thes,
lynchers, or those who instigated them, wa.
deliberately formed to commit this bruta
homicide, two or three months ago! 1t was
probably deemed best by them to reserve til,

why not for human beings! 1t was Christ

is characteristic. This pure and peaceable
and law-abiding race, who never murder
among themselves, must doubtless have beer
shocked at q supposed murderer being suffer

brutal tools to do what their own hands shrunk

of it was vague and contradictory. He may
have been guilty-but, o he may have been
innocent too. Men with stronger circum-

Lowe Murdered i'm Jail.",,"The soil of Kentucky is red with the
blood Of men who died in fair Combat.
and those who have been buchered in cold
blood. But of tie latter we know of no
case more atrocious than the assassination
of Thomas S. Lowe. in the Hawesville
Jail, yesterday. by blood thirsty and cow
ardly mob.


A fued had existed for year between
Lowe and Cieeor Maxwell, Common wealth a
Attorney of that Judicial District. which
had its origin in party politics. Lowe sent
his adversary challenge sometime since,
which he refused to notice. Lowe then
sent him word he would cowhide him
on sight Maxwell did not attend Court
at last term, and it is said for the reason
he Nished to avoid personal conflict
with his determined and desperate foe.


The Court met on Tuesday, and Lowo
publicly declared Maxwell poltroon and
coward. The information was given to
Maxwell, who armed himself and with a
body offriends, attacked Lowe. The latter.
as we related yesterday. retreated. A
number of shots were fired, one of which
killed a man named Aldridge. or Eskring
Lowe was thought for while the mob
would lynch him. but finally he was taken
to prison and disarmed.


The town was fsvarish with excitement,
and on Wednesday night. the mob. who
of course hated Lowe. (mobs always hate
brave men) increased in numbers and the
thirst for blood. During the night it was
decided to force the Jail and lynch Lowe,
or if they couldn't approach him. kill him
outright.


On yesterday morning. in accordance
with tie plans, the mob attacked the Jail.
and fearing to lay hands upon their victim,
fred upon him. He received some sixteen
or eighteen balls in vital parts, and died



Glutted with vengeance, the mob then
retired.


Lowe leaves family who re.ide in
Hawesvlle. His father lives in this city.
He was cool, determined and most dan
gerOus man. In all of his brols or shoot
ing affairs. from which until this, he came
out unscathed. he displayed an extraordip-
airy degree of courage, and he doubtless
died as he lived, without fear Of fmortal man

Of the Folsom Railroad were not in q very

on the part Of the carpenters and laborers at
the manner in which they were boarded. as
also because Of the carpenters demanding,
and being refused, an advance in their wages
OF one dollar day, over their previous rates
OF two dollars a day.

ployees by the ears; but Justice compels us
to declare that the contractors have misman
aged the business, have acted, indeed. yerv
paltry part.


The laborers were hired at S26 a month
and board. If the weather proved too wet
for the men to work, the DAYS wages were
stopped, and moreover one dollar each was
scored against them for she food eaten on that
idle day. On Sundays all hands were oblig
ed to keep a belly Sabbath during dinner
time, for they never got more than two meals
on that day-which was established, it seems.
according to tie contractors rules, although
we must confess the custom is new to us

""On Sunday evening last, the laborers out
at Willards section, being very hungry, ask
ed the contractor for their third meal-call
it supper or dinner This was peremptorily
refused as contrary to the Regulations But
hunger they say, will break through stone
walls, and so, the men, prompted by a COM
mon instinct, formed themselves into a vigi-
lance committee of some kind-took posses
sion of the larder, got up good supper, eat
1t with gusto, and then demanded to be
settled with and paid, as they meant to work
no more on the railway on such terms. To
this the con ractor, Willard, demurred, re-

Association of Colored Ministers of Con-
gregational and Presbyterian Churches,
commenced its session in Sloan Presbyte-
rian Church, Brooklyn, on Wednesday
evening, the 14th inst.


The Rev. Amos G. Beman, of Portland,
opened the exercises by reading hymn,
which was followed by prayer.


The Rev. Samuel Harrison, of Pittsfeld,
Mass, preached from the text Jeremiah
viii, IA, ""Why do we sit still?"" He wound
up sensible sermon by appealing to the
colored people, as such, to be active, be-
cause of the efforts of Church and State
to crush them. He urged upon them the
Importance of working out their elevation
by teaching their children useful mechan-
ical trades-leaving the cities and towns
and becoming owners of the soil. The in
iquity of American slavery called for their
action. He urged upon the ministers the
Importance of taking bold stand in favor
of their race. They could not depend up
on the dominant race to do their work for
them. Three thousand New England
ministers, few years ago, had made a
united effort in favor of Kansas; but when
the Dred Scott decision was announced,
how many, even New England clergymen,
rose to assert the rights of the colored race?
Not three hundred could be found.


The following ministers were present.
Rev. Samuel Harrison, Pittsfeld, Mass. !;
Rev. A. G.. Beman, Portland, Maine; Rev
E. p Rogers, Newark, N. j.; Rev. Geo.

Garnet, N. Y. City; and Rev. S. S. Joce-
lyn, of the American Missionary Associa-
tion Elders representing many of the
churches were present ALSO


The object of this annual convocation is
to give the ministers of color throughout
the Northern, Eastern and Western States
an opportunity of interchanging views up
on the best means to be employed for amel-
iorating the condition of their people, and
of hearing reports of their progress in va
rious parts of the country. The principal
object of the Association is to procure a
fund for the aid of people and destitute
churches, and sustaining an Evangelist who
shall travel from place to place to inquire
into the condition of the people, and bring
to bear upon them such influences as may
tend TO the promotion of their interests, So
cially and religiously.

The Rev II. NJ. Wilson and the Rev. G.

GENTLEMEN:-This will recommend to
your kind consideration two young men of
our Nation, who cheerfully undertake the
perils of trip to your remote settlement
for the purpose of bearing you the painful
intelligence of the murder on the night of
the 28th November about 2 O'Clock, of Mr..
Samuel Stewart, and Reuben Palmer, two of
your citizens, by the man whom they were
IN pursuit of whose name was Worldly
The circumstances that resulted in so
horrible scene, were as follows:


Mr.. Stewart and his friend came up with
Worldly on the above day in Saline District,
Cherokee Nation, at the residence of white
man by the name of Harrison, living under
permit and raising stock for one of our
prominent citizens, j. w. Lynch, and pro-
ceeded to the arrest of said Worldly, on the
they unfortunately overlooked Colts re-
peater that he had secreted about his per-
son, and with which he killed them-shoot-
ing Mr.. S. in the meek and killing him in
lstantly. Mr.. P. was shot in the jaw, rang
! ing down through the neck, the ball lodging.
He lived two days-could talk-relaled all
the circumstances attending the case-gave
his age, native State, &c. Il was impossi-
BILE to get physician, but all that sympa-
thizing humanity could do was of no avil.
If the desire of those that attended him in
! his last moment could have been gratifed he
would more than have lived.


1t win afford you pleasure to know that
Worldly was taken on the Tuesday follow
+ ing. 3Jth Nov, and that he WAS taken on
! to Van Buren, Arkansas, where the United
States Court was in session. Said Court
having jurisdiction over the case, where 1t
/ is generally thought there being very strong
eyidenee) that the justice he SO richly mer-
its will be speedily meted out to him.
The promptness of the arrest is attribu-
table to Mr.. Lynch and other Cherokees,
who also attended to the interment of the
remains OF Mr.. Stewart in as decent man.
ner circumstances would admit OF. The
attentions of Mr.. Harrison on Mr.. P. were
iunremitting to the last


The horses Il at were stolen, as well as
those that were rode out by Mr.. s. and his
friend, are IN the possession of Mr.. Lynch.
One OF the young men had to ride one OF
them back. which is unavoidable. He aiso
takes along with him Mr. Palmer's pistol
There is schedule of all that they had
It would be advisable for some of their
| friends 90 come in Immediately. There is
not the least danger attending the trip, and
the young men viii act as pilots.


Very respectfully,

From TIE WasAfagton Republic.",,"The Rocky Mountain Region.


From one of the descriptions of the
Pixies Peak region, We make the follow
ing extract:


""The valleys of the Platte, its tributa-
ries, and the prairie range on the eastern
foot of the mountain chain, are found to
be far more fertile than was at first sup
posed. Vegetables are plenty in the set
Elements, and there is little doubt that all
the cereals common to the temperate zone
will grow luxuriantly in those localities.
Gold is not the only mineral found, but
evidences ofsilVer, platins, and other ores,
are abundant. Salt, also, will be one of
the great staples""


We have had several recent instances
IN this country of the inaccufaoy of the
judgments pronounced, at first view,
against the capacity of particular sections
to support populations.


Michigan was once reported 10 be a
region worthless for agriculture by the
Government surveyors, and was SO gen.
orally regarded down to as late as the
year 1882. When General Jackson Of
fered to the State of Maine three millions
facres in Michigan for cession to Great
Britain of her territory north of st. John,
he was met with the responsibility not
offer US land IN the moon ?"" And the
opinion OF Michigan which prevailed in
Maine at that time was universal in the
country. And although that opinion of
Michigan has since yielded to a better
knowledge of the subject, yet it is only
within half dozen years that the real
capacities of that State for agriculture are
beginning to be fully understood.


The first swarm of gold hunters pro-
nouncsd California to be an unmitigated
desert; and in more than one letter writ
ten there during the early period of Amer
lean occupation, it was said, and perhaps
truly, that there were thousands of persons
who had been lured thither by Colonel
Fremont's description of the climate and
productions, and that they would gladly
revenge themselves by lynching him, Il
they had him in their power. Those
doleful accounts were given by those who
saw and described the parehed fields OF
California in the dry season, when it has.
to inexperienced eyes, the aspect of a
desert, although even then it is not so in
truth, because the dried grasses of that
region are wonderfully nutritious. and
support animal life in teeming abundance.
Still another error of these descriptions
was the forgetfulness of the fact, that it is
sufficient if only a small portion of the
year is adapted to the culture and growth
OF artificial crops; and this forgetfulness
was the more remarkable, as large part
of the settlers in California were from re-
gions where the earth is locked up bv
frosts and covered by snow during the
long winters.


1t takes time to become accustomed to
new methods Of agriculture, and to Amer
leans irrigation is new, although practised
from time immemorial. Water is essen
tial to vegetation; but if it can be had,
1t matters little whether it is from bitches
or the clouds, with this difference, that
artificial irrigation is under the control Of
man, while he is subject to sad and fire..
quent misfortunes where he is dependent
upon the early and the later rain"" The
valley fthe Nile, the land of corn, owes
all Its fertility to irrigation; and it is irri.
CATION which to-day makes Lombardy
the agricultural wonder of the world.


The great plains which stretch beyond
Kansas to the Rocky Mountains are pro.
nounced to be q desert. Yet buffalo
range, such as those plains notoriously
are, cannot be desert, and a country that
will support cattle will support men, 70,
the obvious reason that men can subsist
upon the milk and beef which cattle fur.

G. w. BRowN, Esq. The trial of
those charged with homicide on Chap
mans Creek, which was to have com
menced on the 9th inst, at Manhattan,
before Hon. Rush Elmore, was continued
till the next April term, on account OF the
absence of some witnesses.


There was not much business transacted
in court, owing to the absence of witness
es and sickness of parties litigating.-l
Some judgments were taken under the
rules o. court, but they were not suffi-
ciently interesting to report.


Judge Elmore re-established, or rather
sustained his reputation for promptly dis
patching business this term. The Judge
has, think, one little fault on the bench;
that is, he is rather lenient. The great
cause of complaint against the great ma
jority of Judges is that they are too tyran-
nical. This in truth cannot be urged
against Judge Elmore. do not mean
that he gives the bar too much indulgence
in listening to them, as it is merit in a
Judge to be good listener, but there is
no. restraint enough upon persons who
are disposed to talk loud outside of the
bar.


l need scarcely tell you the times are
hard here, although Manhattan has i'm
proved good deal this summer there
are quite a number of unfinished build
ings upon which workmen are engaged.
Lewis Kurtz has recently removed his
store into large storehouse erected this
summer. The stone work of county
Jail is nearly if not altogether completed.


1t is far from being a credit to Riley


county. The people here, or at least


some of them, think they have paid taxes


enough to have some show in the way oi


county buildings. But the receipts and


expenditures"" have not yet been publish

done. There may, therefore, be ""good

looking at the late corn and vines. Th'

Or, Searching the Scriptures""",,"sitting one day on bench in the piazza
of retail grocery, with couple of silver
dollars on the seat between them. Both
had on their spectacles, and were busily
engaged in turning with great care and
scrutiny the leaves of a small Bible they
had just procured from the clerk of
the Circuit or Superior Court as it is called
in Georgia.


The lids of the sacred volume had been
worn or torn off, occasioning many dog
ears at both ends, showing evidently long
and hard usage


Each gentleman seemed anxious to have
the book for the time being while each
seemed determined that the other should
not be so exclusive. After most unsat-
isfactory examination, both participating,
Gerald jerked the book from Hodge with
evident signs of impatience, saying:

you it's in the Psalms Of Moses, who
writ and sung all about the old dispensa-

""Pn double the bet"" Hodge replied,
g it's neither in the Psalms nor in your old
dispensatory, as you call it. 1t is under

specks, magnifying glass, or telegraph to
see through or work in them times. | tell
you, Gerald, you amt nowhar with me in

The person thus taunted had been anx-
iousl ly searching the Psalms, and had paid
very lit lie attention to his companion, but
had an indistinct idea that something had
been said about dark ages or dark nights /;
he, however, distinctly comprehended the
invidious comparison instituted between
his biblical knowledge and Hodges. Rails
ing his eyes from the pages he had been
SO closely scanning, and showing his spec
tacles to the top of his head, he looked
piercingly into the face of the other.


""Whar was you brung up, Billy Hodge

Hodge heard nothing Gerald had just
said, except his allusion to the clerk, etc,

search among the Psalms, he seized the
Bible, and commenced looking through
Revelations.

this state. The code, as it now stands, is one
of the best ever framed, although it un-
doubtedly has defects. The jury system
might perhaps be remodeled to advantage,
so as the better to protect the ends of Justice
against packed juries, which have been, TO a
greater extent than a superficial observ er
would believe, an evil in this country. The
prevalence Of mob law in certain portions OF
the State, where crime most abounds, has
been owing, in very great measure, to the
fact that justice has not been done to offend
crs against the laws 10y the courts Of criminal
jurisdiction. True, there have been eXeep.
tions to this state of things, but, as general
thing, public lynchings are attributable to
this cause. The last Legislature spent much
time in discussing the propriety of putting Il
stop to mob law by the enactment Of piece
Of legislation which would have done honor
to Draco. Such an enactment would have
been of no earthly use whatever. The true
way to reach the object desired was then,





en- the administration of justice in the crmi-
nal courts, as to render it next to impossible
that the offender should escape the punish
ment which he merits. There is no doubt
but tlat such a state of perfection in the ad-
ministrAton of the law is possible 1t Is
even now the case in England where the
IN. nf IaI 1,,-f Ia.
courts of criminal jurisdiction. are purer than
they have ever been, we are much inclined
to believe, in any other quarter of the world
The criminal, be he high or low, rich or poor
will meet with his deserts at the hands OF
the judicial tribunals Can we say anything
like this of our courts here in California
We cannot. While, in England, a few months
ago, one of the wealthiest, and most re

fenced TO Imprisonment for life for winding
we, the people of California, have the spec
tacle presented of known robber of the
State Treasury, to the amount Of about two
hundred thousand dollars, being absolutely
acquitted by jury of his country-all ow.
ing to the fact that there are too many loop.
holes still left in the administration of the
criminal code of this State.


There is one great oversight in the previous
legislation Of this State on the subject Of
crimes and misdemeanors. to which we de.
sire particularly to allude, for We believe
tbot uur,orous offond ars bovo osooDod an M
count of it, Witnesses in criminal cases are
paid nothing for their services, whereas they
should be compensated by all means. Many
persons refuse to'give information Of offenscs,
of which they are cognizant, to grand jurics,
on this very account. They are liable to be
detained from their business many days or
weeks, when the case is on trial, through its,
oftentimes, intricate and multiarious stages,
and thus suffer, inevitably, serious losses, to
say nothing Of annoyance and trouble. The
State has no right thus to sacrifice the inter
ests of its citizens or compel their services
This continual and grievous hardship should
be removed. A reasonable sum should be
paid for the attendance of witnesses, after
they have been delayed beyond reasonable
length of time. Exceptional cases might be
made such as where man comes from re
mote section and is put to heavy expense.
When he lives near to the place of trial and
is not detained by successive delays in bring
ing on trial, rehearings, new trials, DC, his
compensation need be little or nothing. 1t
is only the extreme cases, the numerous in
stances of hardship continually occurring,
for which we would have the special inter
position of legislation. In the majority of
the States of the Union, if our impression is
right, witnesses in criminal cases are compen-
sated, and there is no reason why the same
system should not prevail here where time
is so much more valuable than in the older
States."

A BLOODY FIGHT WITH KNIVES took place last
night abeut O'clock between James Manning and
James Lynch on the banquette in front Of the house
jointly occupied by them and their families, on St.
Peter, or Liberty street. between lafayette and Girod


From all we could hear, one was landlord to the
other both were in liquor; quarrel arose between
them at neighborng grocery, where one slapped
the others face; and, meeting afterward in front of
their house. both drew knives and went TO work.


Manning was stabbed in the left breast, and in the
abdomen the latter wound being large as to let
his bowels out. Lynch was stabbed in front of the
left shoulder, behind the shoulder gashed in the
face, and it was believed, stabbed in the side also.
At the termination Of this bloody set-to, Manning
wife took him to house ST. Paul street; Lynch re-
maned at home. Policeman Coste, who was one of
the first to reach the scene, found one Of the bloody
knives lying on the banquette. As Lynch was seated
on chair in his room, bending his head down, and
groaning from his wounds, Mrs. Manning, who had
left her husband at the house on ST. Paul street,
rushed in, and exc!aiming, "" You have murdered my
husband snatched heavy dipper from the mantel-
piece, and began beating him over the head with
the fury of fend. Coste at once seized her an
took her to the lookup.


Both the wounded men were taken To the Charity
Hospital by their respective friends. Manning was
believed to be mortally wounded. Lynch, though
not apparently so badly hurt, was believed to be in
dangerous condition.

1t is said that Governor Wise is not very
complimentary to the people of Harpers Fer

military spirit is high. Men of ""valor"" who
suffered the city and the United States Ar
mory to be occupied by score of adyentu
rers, are now tremendously brave. when
there is no danger and nobody to fight They
are enrolling volunteer corps to scour the
mountains, visit neghboriug towns, and keep
on the alert generally. To show that they
have ""pluck,"" they arrested their own citi-



itorial examination that is not pleasant to
the aforesaid srangers nor creditable to the
bravery of these soldiers in peace and citi
zens in war""


The insurrectionary movement has been
effectualy suppressed, bat the people having,
as Governor Wise expressed it. ""played the
sheep to admiration"" are now as energetic
and brave as they were before apathetic and
cowardly. l would advise no small man
who has light hair and blue eyes to pas this

 The Randolph Herald has a correspond ent who reviews the account of the fancy ball given Tn late number of the Old Line Democrat and asks some hard questions The Herald notices a sale of 47O acres of land on Fourche du Mas, for six dollars an acre. Within ten years that same land will sell for sixty dollars an acre. If we have luck, some day we will visit that sec tion of country and see if its natural wealth and capabilities have been exaggerated. If not, possessing the best navigable streams in the west, good water, pure air and rich, black lands, there can be no limit set to its future prosperity. Our State, so long under cloud IS now emerging. Let the democratic policy of the present Governor be carried out, the debt on account of the Real Estate Bank be paid by those who owe 1t, the remaining debt funded and our credit restored; then, in condition to aid and carry on a system of internal improve ments, Arkansas will be among the fore most of the States. Land has doubled in value within a year or two, and all the elc- ments of success are here or entering the State.

But do not speak too hastily, for we have lived in the north as well as in the south, and what we say We know tob be true. Who will dispute us, when we say that we have seen many child rent from its mother and virtually sold to the highest bidder until 1t was twenty one years old? Many are the mothers who, after losing the companions of theiI bosoms, have, for the want of an annual assistance oi ten or twenty dollars to meet their necessary expenses, been forced to allow their children to bt bound out (sod) to masters until they were twenty one years old, for nominal value in dollars ant cents. This, the good people of the north will say IS all right; and why? Because it is customary, thing of almost daily occurrence, especially in larg, towns.

Western Virginia, states that a pilgrim from
Yankee land. travelling through the country,
was suspected of being an Abolition emissary
by the owner of plantation of negroes, and
taken up by him and hung up several time:
by the neck, being cut down each time be
fore life was extinct. After this kind of pun
ishment, he was let go. The person who die
this job is described by the paper above al
luded to as ""ore of the most influential anC
worthy citizens"" of those parts.


We regret to hear of such violence. We
think that influential and worthy citizens
should leave such business to R'nPuenf'd'
and worthless citizens, as being more becom-
ing to such hands We should suppose that
the laws of Virginia were sufficiently eXpan-
sive to meet the necessity of protecting the
rights of property in all cases that might
arise, whether from Abolition emissaries or
any other source Whether this be so or not
il is policy fraught with great danger to
the Union, to take up every Northern man
who may be simply suspected Of being an
Abolitionist and abusing him with such out
rage as was committed in the case above al
luded TO. The most innocent Of traveller is
liable to be suspected No man can be sup
posed to have the ability to make his true
character appear in every instance, to the
iaundiced gaze of Southern fanatic whose
daily fances and nightly dreams are haunted
by horrent ideas of servile instructions,
bloody murder and black Abolition conspira-
ces Furthermore, even if it were known
that the Northern pedlar or school teacher
was thorough bred Abolitionist, does the
Constitution of our common country permit
J him to be treated as an outlaw, and to be
subject to lawless viOlence2 Let him be
tried by the laws of the land, and, whatever
his doom may be. the North has no right to
complain. But the Northern bosom must
be callous indeed, IL it would remain unmov-
ed at the assumption of authority by every
individual citizen of the South to Pounce up
on any Northern man they chose who came
into the country, and hold bim to persona
responsibility for his supposed political opin-
ions. If these things are to be allowed in the
South, how long will it be before the North
retaliates7 Not long. We shall hear soon
if such violence continues, Of Southern trav-
elers through the North being suspected of {
design to spirit away the free cOlored mel
of the North, and the next thing will be tn
stringing up and lynching of Southern ennis
saries and suspected ""nigger drivers Tn
rule is as fair for one side as the other, and i
will be acted up to.


With such reciprocity of violence betweel
citizens of the North and the South, how
long time would elapse before the country
would be involved in civil war?


The true rule of action is to respect tn
laws of either section Of the Union; to trea
Northern men with the same regard in tn
South as Southern men have been treated il
the North; to allow every Northern man il
the South the same freedom of expression
within the limits of tha Constitution and III
law, that is allowed Southern men in IL
North, and to punish all offences against


State, whether of the Northern or the Soutl
ern section, by the laws of that State. Ol
Bown has doubtless been hung. His dool
was just. He had forfeited his life by q
open violation of the laws of Virginia. II
was fairly tried and legally convicted, an,
few there are who vould dispute the righ
of Virginia to execute him. But, if he ha,
been apprehended by lawless mob, convict
ed by Lynch tribunal and put to death b,
like authority, you would have seen
storm Of wrath, dark and portenteuus, gail
ering upon the brow Of the North, and
would have burst, in due time, with fearfu
effect. She would have been justly incensed
In the same degree. then, may she feel out
ragged when one of the obscurest of her citi-
zens is taken up and physically abused, un
der the general sanction of the public opinion
of the South.


The times are far too dangerous to admit
Of alterations from the due course of Law
and justice. 1t will not do to further emLit-
ter the deep prejudiees of thousands Fo
every Southern man slain in Kansas hun
dred fanatics have arisen in the South. Fo
every Northern man tarred and feathered b,
Southern planters thousand fanatics hav
arisen in the North And SO the feeling grow
and expands.


By all that is holy in our Union, let VII
lence cease."

E. D. Rob- erts, a planter living near Elhstown, in that county, was going 10 church, he was waylaid by a man named Holladay, who fired at him with shotgun. Twenty nine buck-shot entered his body, which produced instant death. Holladay imme- diately fed The whole neighborhood was aroused to phrenzy of excitement so soon as the bloody deed became known. Men mounted on the aeetest horses, secured the country in every direction for Holaday, and party struck his trail leading north. They pursued him to Burnesville, in Tishomingo county, where he was captured and brought back to Elhslown. Judge Lynch considered the case a capital oaense, and, on Saturday evening, Holaday was taken to the scat- fold and executed by the citizens.

 Our informant describes the excitement auendent upon the execution as very great. This is the third man executed by mobs in Poutotoe county within the past two years.

IMMIGRANT MAssACRE.-An immigrant named
Lynch furnishes the following item for the S.
F. Bulletin of the oath inst:


""a small party of immigrants, who were
journeyng along their laborious road to Cali
fornia were forced to stop on the Sublette
Cutoff road near Fort Hope, to look after
sick horse. While they were thus halted, they
were suddenly fred into from some broken,
rocky ground, where Indians had been lying
in ambuscade. Five of the immigrants were
killed outright. OF these two were brothers,
named Sheppard another was named Wright
but the names of the other two who were
killed are not known. At the same time the
FIVE were killed, Mrs Wright (wife of one of
the slain) was pierced by ball, and fell, ap-
parently dead She had an infant in her arms.
Ounnpther man was also badly wounded, and
was left by the savages for dead.


uThe Indians, after seeing that all the
whites were apparently killed, came up to the
train and robbed the wagons of what they
wanted. and corralled the cattle They snatch
ed the infant from the arms of its bleeding
and seemingly lfeess mother. and hurled it
in the air. SO that it fell stunned upon a Jag
ged rock. They,then left, drivingGth them
the animals of. the whites. The killed and
wounded lay Is hours exposed TO the sun and
the attacks of the wolves. At the expiratiop
of that time another train providentially cah1
up. Mrs. Wright was found to be still alive /;
so was the infant child-though its leg had
been crushed, either in the grasp of the inhu-
man savage, or against the less finty stone
Besides these, one man was found to be breath
ing. The new comers upon the horrible scene
proved themselves good Samaritans. All that
was possible was done for the restoration of
the wounded. When Mr.. Lynch overlook this
party on the road, the wounded man and the
infant were regarded as out of immediate dan
ger. Mrs. Wright was yet in critical state.
The opinion was that she would die:1"

The Chicago Press Of July 10 says: AT nj
period IN the history of the grain trade Of GU
clty has the wheat market undergone such sud
den fluctuations as have occurred dnrinC IN.
past eight or ten weeks; and in no preyou.
year has there been so much money lost on m,
came amount of wheat.


On the 18th of April last standard eorino
wheat sold at 80 cents in store. Shortly after
this date the European war broke out, and
Oreadstuifs all over the world advanced, SO thai
on me tIrst OF May the above grade sold at 81
70 81 O0-daily advancing TIL the 10Th, when
II reached 81 30. Since that date its course
mas been steadily aud alarmngly downward
On the 2st Of June il was 81 Is; on the LIST of
July 92 cents, and yesterday it closed dull at
o6 cents-a decline Of SERENITY. four cents per
6uShet IN sirty ttSo days!
AT Milwaukee the decline has been equally
great. On the 10Th of May last, No. l spring
sold at about 81 43; while on Saturday last II
sold al 70c.


Tins altogether outstrips the decline of 81
winch has hitherto been quoted as the sudden
decline. ln that year standard spring wheat
rose on the Sd OF July to 81 80 f. o. b and fell
10 oOc IN store, on the oath of November fol-
io""lng-a heavier but more gradual fall.








less, OF Delaware, who was convicted in Pc
tersburg, Va, of slave stealing, and sentenced
10 forty years Imprisonment in the peniteutl-
airy, died at that institution few days since,
having. at that time, thirty nine years to serve.
His capture, it will be remembered, created
much excitement, and he narrowly escaped
lynchlng when he was landed from the boat
which carried him to Petersburg.


Runaway SLAvEs.-A slave man belonging
TO George Blddle, OF Sassafras Neck, and his
wife and child, also slaves, belonging to George
A. Ford, OF Ceclton, ran off on last Sunday
night. They took with them horse valued at
S2oO and small wagon belonging to Mr.. Bid
die. Mr.. has offered a reward of $3.50 for
the arrest of the man, but can find no traces Of
hun.
MR.. SICKLES's 3 remuneration to his unhappy |
wife creates talk, of course; but the general |
impression is, that 1t was bout in his style, and
not very strange. He stands high IS a man of
talents; but scandal chsses him, as it does all |
tempting game. However 1t may affect him, it |
would seem to be all we'll and infinitely better

boarding house in Dutch Flat, aad asked for
work. Wilson told him he did not wish to hire
Moer then asked for work sufficient to pay for

and remained confined to his bed, Moier wait
ing upon him. Things remained in this way
until Tuesday last, when Moier presented bill
to Wilson of 81 per day for labor and attend
ance. Mr.. Wilson reminded Moer of the un-
derstandng they had when he came there, and
frankly told him he could not pay it. Moier
then retired from the bed where Wilson lay,
and prepared himself for the butchery of his
victim. Waiting until Wilson had gone to
sleep, he fell upon him with knife, and literally
dissected his borels. The deceased fingered until
the next day, when he died. When the butch
cry became known through the town, it caused
the greatest excitement. Preparations were
Immediately made to lynch Moer, and but for
the expeditions manner the prisoner was run
out of town, undoubtedly justice would have
been summarily administered. The officers aud
prisoner were pursued some distance out OF

taken. Moier was safely lodged in Jail on
Wednesday."

been unusually excited by an expose of the
excessive cruelty of Capt. Pendleton, (of the
vessel Sarah Park, lately arrived at the Bay,)
toward his seamen. For the slight offence
of stealing bread, to appease the cravings Of
hunger, this man most inhumanly beat sew
eral Of his men, and put them in irons in a
dark hole below, where they were confined
for weeks without being permitted to come
upon deck. Upon the arrival Of the vessel
at San Francisco, the Captain made COM
plant against two of his men for stealing.
Upon the men being arrested and taken to
the L. S. Marshal's their wretched and en-
aciated condition led to an inquiry that re-
suited in bringing to light the monstrous
outrage of the Captain upon them. Upon
examination, the Captain was committed
to Jail to stand trial upon the serious
charge brought against him. In the mean
while dense crowd of people had gathered
about the U. S. Marshal's, and Maj. Solo
mon found it necessary to enrol a posse Of
thirty men to escort his prisoner safely to
Jail. The crowd followed the culprit to the
doors Of the prison, with cries of ""Hane
him."" ""Lynch him."" etc, threw ciods and
sticks, and made a rush for the prisoner as
he was being taken up the steps of the Jail
They tore portion of his clothing from his
back, but the officers succeeded in getting
him safely within the prison walls, much tt
the relief of the frightened man. The ex
citement for a time was intense. The jai
guard was strengthened from fear of an at
tack. but the sober second thought returning
in time to the crowd, it quietly dispersed.

THE REBELLION AT HAMPERS

 FERRY.",INTERESTING PARTICULARS.,"An old mulatto has been arrested on { charge of having had an interview witt Cook on Tuesday, promising him to come into Harper's Ferry as spy and repor to him in the mountains. A basket O supper was found in her hut, ready to be carried into the mountains. Her daugh. ter informed agains, her.

 The news from Charlestown is tha Stevens wounds are doing well, and iha $ old Brown"" is oul of all danger on the score of his wounds.

 Governor Wise arrived here today ir the train from Charlestown, and issued the following order:

 ""HARPEs's FERRY. Oct. %. 1S59--Henry Hunter, Esq.--Sir: The Governor of Virginia directs that you organize an armed patrol of | twenty-five men, to be under your command and to remain on duty until further orders.-- You are invested with such discretionary powers as may be necessary to carry out the instructions to-day given you by the governor You will patrol the districts assigned you for duty, protect and defend persons and property and execute the full office assigned you. You will communicate information or report foI further orders in writing to the governor, al Richmond, or to the undersigned. By order oi Henry A. Wise, Governor of Virginia ana Commandern-c

 ""JOHN BLAIR HODGE,

 ""Aidecamp to Governor""

 Upon receiving the above, Captain Craig issued the instruction to the super intendent of the armory 10 furnish the arms.

 Thirty rounds of ammunition were also directed to be given to Henry Hunter, al the expense of the State The governor says the State had arms for one hundred thousand men. He also said the Sharp's rifles were a dangerous weapon for those not familiar with arms. He preferred the smooth bore musket for military; Sharp's rifles were toys in the hands of the peo. pie.

 The United States district court for western Virginia commences it's session at Wythevile, Wythe county, (Judge Broc- kenbaugh,1 on Monday next.

 The prisoners are committed to jail for the murder of five persons, as follows: First, at the instance of the United States for the murder of Luke Quinn, private of the marine corps, and F. Beckman, railroad agent, killed upon the govern ment property second, at the instance of the State authorities, for the murder of Geo. Turner, Thos Boerley, and H. the colored porter

 It is remarkable fact, that not a single slave joined the party of insurgents Those who were taken prisoners made their escape from their captors at the first opportunity and returned to their masters One of the negroes from the West cap- tured at the rifle factory, was taken to Charlestown jail. The propositions to lynch him were overruled by the good sense of the citizens.

 Mir. Beckham's body laid in the street several hours after he was shot, until woman, the sister of MT. Foulke, remov- ed il upon wheelbarrow.

 THE ANTEcEDENTs OF ""oLp"" BROWN.

 A writer in the New York Commer. cial says:

 "" He is the son of wealthy farmer of Hudson, Sumit county Ohio. by the name of Owen or Squire Brown as he was generally called. Capt Jno Brown was born in Connecticut but resided for more than thirty years in Hudson township, Ohio, on dairy farm, but subsequently embarked in wool growing, in which bus mess he was quite successful, until he &C., very large venture of the finest qualities of that article to England This speculation resulted in a runous loss and from that time to this he has been more or less absorbed Tn the furlher- ance of Abolition views, op which sub ect he was complete fanaiic."" THE DESIGNS OF THE EINsURREcrIoNIsTs-

 THEIR INTENTION TO HAVE SEIZED AND

 IMPRISONED THE PRESIDENT OF THE

 UNITED STATES.

 The reporter of the Baltimore Sun with gentleman of veracity, direct from Harper's Ferry He stated tha. ""Od Brown"" and his confederates were overheard in the. rawlings on Tues. day night previous, giving vent to their overcharged brains. Their ejaculations were overheard from the quarters where Brown and Stevens were confined.- Brown was heard to say that, in the event of their success, the insurgents conem. plated the capture of Washington, the seizure of the Federal Government, and the imprisonment of the President and his Cabinet. The schemes of the revolu- ton was in the confidence of five of the revolutionary spirits of the Southern and eight of the Northern States.

 It IS fact worthy of notice that all the spears captured by the United States are one foot longer than the musket and bay onet of the army, and their use, it is evil dent, was to be mainly employed in keep ing the United States soldiers at bay. THE wHEREABoUTso OF CAPTAIN COOK AND

 HIS WIFE.

 A gentleman from Harrisburg says that Cooks wife came into that town on Tues day, and stopped at the same place where old Browns sons wife was boarding.

A child, some seven or eight years old, was
taken TO Marysvlle the fore part of last week,
for surgical treatment, its neck having been
partially dislocated by sudden wrench in play
ing ""hide and SEEK Several physicians ex-
amined the dislocation and found it very
critical case. The danger was that in forcing
the joint back into its place the spinal marrow
would be severed, thus causing instant death.
| The effort was made, however, and successfully.
The head flew into its proper position, aud the
child laughed with JOY at the sudden relief af-
forded. Tba spinal column received no injury.
A case like this-that is one where the dsloca-
tion was nearly completes rare indeed, unat-
tended by death in the effort at replacement


A fatal casualty occurred at Michigan City,
Placer county, March llth. Capt. G. II Hal
sey and Geo. Merritt were opening cut in their
claims, and were supplied with water from o
small resavoir and ditch above. The water
accumulated faster than they supposed, the
reservoir gave way, the unfortunate men were
swept from their feet, and carried some three
quarters of a mile below. before their lifeless
bodies dould be recovered. When found their
bodies presented horrid mass of mangled flesh
and bones Capt. Halsey was native of New
| Bedford Mass and leaves family. MERIT
was a single man, aud formerly from New
York.


A shocking tragedy was perpetrated in a
house of ill.fame, at San Francisco, on Tues
day, the 18th inst. The house had remained
closed oil day, until suspicion was reused and
an entrance forced, when the dead body OF q
woman was found. and near her man with bic
throat cut so that the windpipe severed but he
was still living. The woman had evidently
been strangled, and had been dead for over
twenty-four hours, and the indications are that
the man first strangled her aud then cut his own
throat. The woman was of i'll repute, named
Louisa Forrman, and the murderer WAS her

AN INGENIOUS SwIEDLE was performed On Mon

arrested. He went to her with thirteen bezes o.
cigars, two bundles Of six boxes eaeh and an extra
box, which be had open, and which was filled with
good cigars, as sample Of what the other boxes
contained. He represented that he was short 81
money, and would leave the twelve boxes with her on
deposit for loan Of s35; be having large lot of other
cigars in the Customhouse as he said which he
could not take out till be paid the duty. The woman
gave him the s35, and he left. Not returning at the
time he promised, her suspicious were aroused; and
opening the cigar boxes she found that every one
of the twelve was nicely filled with straw, with just
enough fragments of brick in each to give 1t the
weight OF box Of cigars. The poor woman lugged
the whole of the trash down to Recorder Longs yes

she would have to go to Recorder Wtz she left the
boxes there, and went off heartbroken in search OF

principles of our party. They lag be-
hind the age. 1t is time to boldly avow
that the policy of the Democratic party
is fixed in favor of opening the slave
trade. Our leaders have been steering
all around the question. approaching it
as a ship does the shore against head
wind, but not the less nearing the point
that we sometimes have seemed to be
going in another direction. 1t is time to
throw off all DISCUSSES, that heretofore
have enveloped our intentions, and let
the world know that we esteem slavery
not only not as an evil, but positive
gcod-a good to be perpetuated and e1-
tended-extended not only by its prop
agation over all the territories, but by
the importation OF negroes directly from
the most available and cheapest market.
In the old fogy days of the Republic
slavery was held to be an evil to be as
much restricted as possible in its opera
tion. Hence the territories were kept
free from slavery, and the slave trade
was declared piracy. Now we hold that
slavery is positive good, sanctioned by
scripture and boon to black and white.
In accordance with this view ,he Demo-
cratic party for years past, has bent all
its energies to the almost sole object of
propogating slavery, and thus comforting
signal boon upon the country. Under
this idea the Kansas bill was passed, and
SO interpreted as to favor slavery all the
time. The fanatic free state men
sought to keep out the institution by
their votes, but the administration found
means to count them out, and when
that failed few healthful applications
of lynch law and Buford pills, maintain.
ed the supremacy of the slavery inter-
est. 1t is true all these failed in the
long run. and Kansas may be free
state in spite of US; but the Democratic
party is not the less entitled to credit for
trying to force the benefcient institution
into Kansas. A noble endeavor should
not be judged by its degree of success.
So in New Mexico. The administration
has succeeded in having slavery estab.
lished their by law. and even free blacks
are sold as slaves. The party can be
trusted at all times to push slavery
ahead, and punish the fanatics who op.
pose it.


1t is a Democratic principle that
slavery is good and national institute on
Why then be so backward to take what
ever other advantages lay in our way to
favor its progress? If the slave trade
is reopened we can soon people all the
Territories with slaves, and crowd out
the fanatics of the north-the greasy
mechanics"" and ""6lthy laborers"" who
go there to vote down the institution.
The southern wing Of the Democratic
party have already laid down this prop
osition as one of the cardinal tenets of
Democracy, and its supporters in tn free
states must come to it. The strength
of the party is in the South, and the
northern hangers on must bow to the
will of the majority. We call upon all
true Democrats to vote for the party
straight. for by SO doing we will have
the slave trade reopened, and pretty
soon we can have niggers Of our own.
When niggers get down to fifty dollars
head we can all luxuriate in them
even poor editor>. The mere fact of
our being in free state will be no OBJ
stacle, for if slavery exists by virtue of
the constitution. and property in
slaves is not the result of local law, as
our party holds, why man has right
to his property wherever he may be
and can take his niger with him. If an
abolitionist can take his horse or ma
chinery into a slave state and retain
them, why may not southern gentle
man take his niger into free state,
and hold him therel We are tired of
these determinations in favor of the abo
litionists. Ifslavery is rights recog-
nized by the constitution that governs
all the states. and a man does not de,
pend on local law to hold his slaves, as
our party declares, then the Mississip-
plan has right to bring and work his
negroes here. The Democrati: party
is the true progressive party. and is
steadily approaching the ground where
it will be able to open the slave trade.
and make all the states and territories
slave-holding. Vote for the party then,
and by SO doing vote yourself Niger

pied by Mr.. Ferguson, on Bacchus, between Euterpe
and Poyn,nia, was totally destroyed by fire, with
most of its contents. The family were absent at
the time, though the house had been left in charge
of woman as keeper. The fire was evidently
started by incendiary for it started in the par

with the greatest rapidty. The firemen were late

wounded, and was afterward removed to hospital.

out any vestige of vehicle behind, dashed madly

The result was that he came violently into contact

Baltimore has earned such an unen-
viable notoriety for her rowdyism, that
business men shun it as center of trade,
and her wholesale merchants complain
grievously of the change. Lawrence has
been in the way of earning a reputation
which will neither add wealth or honor


Its tendency must be to divert all law
abiding emigrants to other parts of Kan
sas, if not to other Territories. To say
nothing of the violation of law in the
cases Of Whitley and Huzzy, who were
driven from Lawrence by abolitionists, the
recent proceedings of the Vigilance Com
mittee cast dark shade over the moral
tone of the community. A Lawrence
correspondent of the Cincinnati Gazette,
under date of June Sd, states:


""a few days since, the body Of man
was found floating in the river about ten
miles below this city. 1t was taken out
and identified as the corpse of one Murray.
From his neck a new rope hung, furnish
ing unmistakable evidence that the said
Murray had been hanged until dead, and
his body thrown into the waters of the
Kaw. He has been suspected for long
time of being connected with gang OF
horse thieves. He came into town a
few days since, and suddenly disappear
ed. 1t is suspected that during the night
he was taken into the timber by gang OF
men and murdered. The affair passed
off without exciting any attention or COM
ment""


He was suspected, arrested, hung till he
confessed, and implicated others, and the
RESULT is told by letter-writers. The writer
adds that others implicated, shave since
mysteriously disappeared-some say that
thoy havo boon rnu-dored, ~hilo othore
assert with considerable assurance, oh
they have only been hung up little, and
sent out of Kansas'-whether by river or
not, is not yet known"" And that ""'Hang
him up without judge or jury is frequent
ly heard in our streets, which is generally
applauded, and rarely if ever protested
against""


Jacques"" who writes for the N. Y
Times, states the same case, with as much
sang fold as though hanging men was 9
midnight pastime in Kansas. Instead ol
pleading this lawlessness as an excuse fol
State government, it would be far better
to enforce whatever of statutory law there
is, and protect the legal rights of every
man, though he be the vilest criminal thai
ever went unwhipt of justice. Nothing
is more notoriously unsafe than mob law
nor more unreliable than the mob-spirit
The very men who to-day may extort by
the halter confession of guilt, and hang
the victim till dead, may tomorrow visi
vengeance on moral men who attempt tc
stem the tide of the liquor-trafic. 1t is
the rod of terror, in many localities, which
is held over the heads of men who wish
to enforce the laws for the regulation Of
suppression of liquor-selling


Criminal Jurisprudence presupposes the
innocence of the accused until proven
guilty, and even requires doubt as to the
guilt of the prisoner to be construed III
his favor. Lynch law metes out its judg-
ment, on suspicion, ex-parte testimony, OIL
forced confession. 1t has nothing to COM
mend it, while the reasons for its disap,
proval are many and valid.


The pleas set up that the laws cannot be
enforced, that lynch law is as necessary
here as in California, when gamblers and
thieves ruled San Francisco, are inappli-
cable. The laws can be enforced here as
well as elsewhere if the people are de-
termined to enforce them. Government
here has not relapsed into the hands OF
desperadoes similar to those who cursed
California, hence the precedent sought to
be borrowed from the shores of the Pacific
docs not apply.


If Kansas is to retain fame for any
thing noble and just, her citizens should
disown lynch law, be law-abiding, and
prove by their acts that the problem of
Territorial self-government without the
intervention of Congress, has been salts
factorily solved in this Territory."

Allen was the son of a respectable man

cribed by University Graduate who

approve oft more than our readers will
be likely to do. His communication is
dated from Grass Valley, Nevada coun-
ty, on the 23d day of May in the pres

opposition that would have appalled, most

laid such foundation that superstructure
can be built upon it that will bring us into
constant communication with various Sec

Twice, during my term of service in the
Senate, have succeeded in passing a bill
through that body to establish a great line
of mail steamers between San Francisco by

continue to exert all the influence at my

Congress- With such line in successful
operation, the traveller could enter the rail-
cars on the borders of Missouri and travel.

The only link wanting to encompass the
world by steam will be the Pacific Railroad;
and no combination, no sectional agitations,
no diversity of interest in regard to the
route can prevent the consummation of that
great enterprise These great measures may
not be consummated during my term of SER
vice in the Senate; but in the cou ellis of the
nation and as a private citizen, they shall
ever receive my most ardent support-and
that they will be consumated have no more
doubt than | have of my existence

already opened. We have now the Isthmus

the highest national Importance, and its adj
justment may be well counted as one Of the |
greatest achievements of this or aor pre-.

From this cursory review of the leading ,

have every reason to congratulate ourselves
upon our pre- sent prosperous condition and

an ordeal of no ordinary difficulty, and now
stand before the world as the only civilized

with an unequalled climate, and soil that
that will produce everything that grows out
of the earth; with mountains of gold sue

American freemen, we will control the com

be true to ourselves in advocating the great
measures that have indicated; stand by the
constitution as it is; frown down upon sec

our beloved country, and the time will soon

sophistry could overleep. and no stretch of
ingenuity evade; and thus having, as one
might say, impoundel his victim, and girt
about him like a scorpion in circle of fire,
he stripped himself to the work of massacre.
Then it was a vision both glorious and
dreadful, to behold the orator. His action,
before graceful as the wave of golden bill
low in the breeze, now grew impetuous as
the motion of an oak in hurricane. His
voice became trumpet, filled with wild
whirlpools, deafening the ear with the crash
es OF its power, and yet intermingled all the
while with sweet under-song of softened
cadence. His face was red as a drunkard's, S,
his forehead glowed like heated furnace,
hts countenance was haggard like that of q
maniac, and ever and anon he flung his long
and bony arms on high, as if grasping after
thunderbolts.
He drew picture of murder in such ap-

All at once the speaker descended from the
perilous height. His voice walled out for
the murdered dead and for the living-the
beautiful Mary, more beautiful every mo-

wept and women sobbed like children.


He closed by a strange exhortation to the
jury, and through them to the bystanders.
He advised the panel after they should bring
in verdict for the plaintiff not to offer vio-
lence to the defendant, however richly he
might deserve it; in other words, not to
lynch the villain, but leave his punishment
with God.


This was the most artfui trick of all. and
the best calculated to ensure vengeance.


The jury returned verdict of fifty thous-
and dollars; and the night after, Hopkins
was taken out of his bed by lynchers and
beaten nearly to death


AS the court adjourned the stranger made
known his name. and called the attention
OF the people to the announcement-""Joh ohm

deavored to convince us that we were
wrong, urging that, in the case of Chi
nese thieves especially, there was no
legal punishment which could be infic-
ted that would have the desired effect of
lessening the number of small robberies.
The inefficiency of the law, even when
faithfully executed, it is contended af-
fords sufficient justification for this de-
testable fogging practice. 1t is assumed
that such severity deters thieves from
repeating their depredations, and that
this is the only method by which COM
munity can be protected. 1t is thought
that Imprisonment is enough punish
ment in the case Of white men, because
they are degraded in their own esteem
by it; but Chinese and Negroes have
no such fine feelings, and therefore
ought to be lashed on the bare back in
violation of law and humanity and thus
frightened into paths of virtue.


This is a sort of reasoning with which
we have no sympathy. We are opposed
to man fogging on principle, because it
is fundamentally wrong, debases those
who practise it, jeopards innocent persons
and the peace of community, shocks
humanity, outrages the laws-which are
based on justice if they do not invari-
ably afford it-and fails to accomplish
its object. On this score we make no
distinction between races. 1t is absurd
to contend that thief because he is
white deserves another kind of punish
ment than is awarded to thieves of any
other color; and it is equally absurd to
assert that any man who will steal can
be morally degraded by Imprisonment.
The point needs no argument. HUI
manity forbids all wanton cruelty, but
the exigencies of our anomalous social
condition sometimes seem to make it
necessary. 1t was formerly thought
necessary to hang men for stealing a six
pence, then for stealing horses. Yet it
was found that hanging did not put
stop to these crimes, and simple confne-
ment Of the criminal was substituted. or
transportation, as in England. There
is with certain unhealthy organizations,
a constant proclivity to crime which no
punishment can eradicate. There is in
nearly every community class of small
thieves who will always be such, in spite
of mob vengeance and repeated lash
ings. Flogging in then navy has been
abandoned as useless cruelty, and subse-
quent experience proves that there is no
increase of insubordination. Flogging
will not prevent stealing why
continue such shameful, inhuman
practice? It is continued because a
few low natures delight in it and are
supported in it from mistaken notions
of its efficiency by better people, who
would not themselves apply the lash any
more than they would rob or murder.
Extreme punishment for minor offenses
is universal characteristic of low order
of civilization. The Chinese are noted
for the cruel nature of their punish
ments; the Russians have been Infamous
for the knout, whose use they are grad
ually abandoning; and every inferior
people infict penalties whose barbarity
is revolving to nations enjoying higher
degree of civilization and more humane
laws. The practice of flogging in Cali
fornia, were it to become universal,
would argue low morality amongst
the masses, and would be certain to
produce it if not already in existence.
Better let the thieves run than degrade
ourselves by inhumanly beating them.
The continuance of these public fogg-
ings tends to keep alive that lawless
vigilance spirit which has run riot
long enough already to make our State
a byword and reproach. We love the
community in which it is our good for
tune to reside, and would like to see it
preserve the reputation for humanity
to which it is entitled by its many good
deeds. Let us drop this lynching here
after, and apply our energies, aud means
If necessary, to procure the legal con-
vlctlon and punishment of those who
violate the law

 The Brownsville Echo complains of the mail failures between this city and that point. The following is from the Echo:

 ""M. & L. R. R.-The grading of this road under the superintendence of Messrs. Apple & Laney is progressing rapidly, in spite ot Inc Irish fracas last week. We hope no more occurances of the kind will happen to impede the progress ofthis road""

 And the Madison Journal has this on the same subject

 ""Thc NJ. & L. R. R. is doing fine bn- siness. We informed by the agent that 1t IS paying $ per cent. on the money invest ed Tn the road. One train, and that large one, is not able to carry all the freights that are shipped each day""

 Opposite this city the contractor has hands at work clearing out the track and preparing to grade the road We are told there are men st work all along the line between this and White river. The Mem ph's and Little Rock road may be set down as a fact accomplished. The Little Rock and Fort smith road is begun and the sale of valuable lands will afford them means to carry 1t on. The Cairo and Fulton road has adopted liberal policy to pre-em ptors on the lands. and the president expresses his determination to regain the public con tldence and push the work. The Missis- sippi, Ouachita and Red river road shows an encouraging state of affairs, and the president gives assurance of it's soon being finished. There is an absurd idea that to advocate the building of one of these roads n Oth jealousy and the rivalry that exists should only serve as . stimulous to greater exer- lions on the part of each If one road is built 1t will lead to the building of others.

 The Eldorado Times suggests the bmild- ing of d railroad from Trenton, by way of Eldorado, to Camden.

 The Arkansian gives an extract from Kansas paper, in which the abolitonists in sist that they must and will have the neu, tral lands of the Cherokees. Six or seven hundred free soilers are squatted on these lands and now demand their sale. The Arkansian says:

 There are suspicious men in this coun- try, in this county, in this town. They, rest assured, belong secretly to that same 'or- ganlzation' which shed blood at Harper's Ferry; which threatens to do so on the Ar kansas frontier which has laid a regular and systematic plot to raise the negroes on our plantations and farms; which instituted a provisional government with elected off, cers, and which has sworn intending, un- compromising war and death to slavery; and they are numbered among those who are to assist in that 'irrepressible conflict against the south and her sacred institu- tlons. Aye, there are such men among us, and they are marked. Let Mene tahc heed! Here they will find different spirits from the cravens of Kansas""

 The Batesville Democratic Sentinel has an excellent article on ""the irrepressible conHict'' which we regret we have not space to reprint it in The White river meeting was held, members of directory elected and the Seminal expresses the belief that sum sufficient to effect the contemplated improvement will be speedily raised.

 The State Rights Eagle acknowledges the receipt of little "" tater' weighing only six and a half pounds. We wish the edi- tor could see some of Dr. J Jordan's largest. The Eagle notices the fact of our saving Little Rock will soon be lighted with gas Or If if if cr;+, l,;o, Lot+o, rJV.4 .4 prise is fixed fact and the next move on the board is a telegraph. If the editor of the Eagle was not averse to forming con nections we would ask him to connect with the Memphis and Little Rock telegraph line and carry it to Camden.

 The Fort Smith Times says the streets of that city are crowded, at times, with emigrant wagons and droves of sheep, etc., destined for Texas and Louisiana. Droves of sheep, some of them with two or three thousand passed through here on their way to Texas Green J. Clark has letter in the Times setting forth the advantages of western Arkansas as stock raising coun- try. His arguments are unans swerable. In an article upon the Harper's Ferry invasion, the Times has the following:

 ""There is no doubt hundreds of emis.a ries,are in the south, secretly at work among the slaves, and every individual suspected should be made to leave. The frontier States are more exposed than those farther south and nothing has given the abolition lsts so much power, as this temporizing with the subject of slavery, by the people of the south, to meet the views of the north. In this region, the people should be on the look out, as we are near the Kansas line, and as there are abolitionists in the Chero- kee nation, thick, headed by Even Jones, a Baptist missionary, foreigner, who, no doubt would lend aid and comfort to the emissaries of black republican abolition ists""

4. Nominated at Charfston!",,"Nominated ut


Will the South support Douglas if is nomi-
mated br the Charston Convention? This Is a
question Of immense importance. An atiirna-
tive answer would induce many persons, who
are now estranged from the regular organiza-
tion. 10 resume their former position in the ranks
of the old time Democracy. Those Of them who
are par excellence friends of Douglas-when
they are told that BY leaving the regular De-
nocratic organization they deprive themselves
of all opportunity to assist in sending Douglas
delegates from this State to the Charlston Con-
vention-reply by asking this question, Z"" Will
the South support Douglas if he is nominated
by the Charlston Convention?""


We unhesitatingly respond ""yes!' And now
for the proof:


The Richmond (ya.) Enquirer of June oath,
asks the Democratic papers of Virginia, and
particularly the Richmond Examiner and Lynch
burg Republican, to take sides either for Hunter
or Wise for the next Presidency. Both of
these papers unqualifedly refuse to do this.
The Republican, in a spirit of quiet sarcasm,
thus responds to the amusing demand of the
Enguirer-s editor, a son of Henry \. Wise;


ave think the Democratic party has higher
mission to perform than the promotion Of either
Mr.. Wise or Mr. Hunter; nor do we think that
our party is under any particular obligations to
make either of them President. We don't
think it has ever contracted any such bargain
certainly it has never signed and sealed any such
bond, and it is presumption in them or their
r. 1. 80
detract from either of these distinguished and
very worthy gentlemen, we must be permitted
to express the opinion-an old fogy one, per-
haps-that there are two or three other Demo-
Gratis in the Union not altogether unfit or unde-
serving the highest honors of the Democratic
party, and whose claims may possibly be
brought before the Charlston Convention. There
are Douglas, Breckenridge Floyd, Cobb, Lane,
Bright, Davis, Seymore, Dickinson and others,
who have their friends and admirers, and whose
claims, presumptuously perhaps, may be brought
to the attention of the National Democracy""


The same paper endorses heartily an article
from the leading State organ of the South Caro-
lima Democracy, the Columbia South Carolnean
wherein the position of Douglas is endorsed
and that of Brown, Davis and others,-to wit
in favor CT Intervention by Congress to protect
slave property in the Territories,-iS opposed
The same paper cries, ""Three cheers for Geor
gia"" because her recent Democratic State Cou-
vention "" fully endorsed the non-interventior
doctrine of the Cincinnati platform, as fellows


Resolved That the Democratic party of Geor.
gia continues to adhere to the principles an
nounced by the National Convention of Cincin-
natl in 1856, and its declaration to insist upo.
their being carried out in the administration o.
the Federal Government.


The same paper, in speaking of Hunter and
Wise for the next Presidency, says:


We shall not support either in the Charl-
ston Convention or out of it before his nomina-
ton, if his friends favor any innovation upon
the Cincinnati Platform of 1856; nor will we
support the claims of any man, North OF South
who does favor such innovation""


Now, be it remembered, the Republican is Sc
cond, in point of standing and influence, to no
Democratic paper in Virginia. We know its
editor well, having been type-stiektrs together
in the same Office in our boyhood, and we know
he means what he says, and speaks the sent-
ments of a majority of the Democracy Of Yir-
ginia.


LIZ L~""""'""tS' ANsPOhNo WIN AAhV OApSASooI
and unequivocally takes ground in favor of the


incinnati Platform unchanged, and opposed to
the new doctrine of Intervention for the protec-
tion of slave property in the Territories. So,
also, does the Rockingham Register Speaking
of the Cincinnati Platform, it has the following :


""We do not hesitate, therefore, to say, that
we are in favor of the re-adoption of that plat
hxr.f .f,aC barl Co.,


Relative to taking sides, as between Hunter
and Wise, it says


""We are not in the ring in the fight over men.
We care not who is our leader in 1850, so he be
good and true Democrat. We will not allow
ourselves to be an agent in engendering ill-feel-
ing between the friends of Wise, and Hunter
and Douglas, and Dickinson they are all our
friends SO long as they are friends and support
ers OF the great Democratic party and its prin-
ciples. We are ready to inscribe the name of
either Of them upon our banner, whenever the
Democracy of the land shall say so.'


Thus talk large majority of the Democratic
papers of Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, and,
indeed, of every Southern State. They stand
ready to hoist the name of stephen a. Douglas
at their mastheads the moment the Ciarlstcn
NSH'SNeASA tLOSld4tus Httll ltS Houlllee lOE TUE
Presidency. These papers draw no distinction
whatever between Douglas and other Demo
Gratis. They do not even cast the most outside
shade of the dimest shadow of the most distant
doubt upon his Democracy, or his standing as
great leading Democratic Captain. If Dougla:
be nominated by the Charlston Convention, and

GOOD OUT OF Evil.",,"The contest now going on in Virginia between
Messrs I.etcher and Goggin turns. as our readers
are aware, mainly on the question which candidate
is the most thoroughly devoted To the interests oil
the shareholders and to the extension and perpe-
tuity Of the institution of Slavery. The welfare OF
the lab@ring white is left totally out Of the ac
count, the great effort Of Mr Letcher. the Demo
cratic candidate, being to excuse himself for hav-
ing formerly in view Of their interests, regarded
Slavery as social and political evil But this
ectioneerng struggle diseraceful as il Is alike to
the candidates and the State, has at least the adj
vantage Of giving & wide circulation to some views
on the subject Of Slavery. which. however guber-
Material candidates may now find it etpedient TO
turn their backs upon them, ara not less just nov
than they were when those SAME candidates sp-
plsuded and reechoed them. The pamphlet of Dr.
RufDer originally printed in l5i7, and which Cog
gins friends claim that Letcher ndorsed, speaks OF
Slavery a. ""a curse more destructive in its effect
than war, pestlence or oppression of rulers, civil
cor ecclesiastical"" consuming plague,
black vomit and yellow fever"" This very just
description Of Slavery, together with number oi
other selections from the Ruifner pamphlet, en-
bracinp. no doubt, all the most pungcnt parts of
il. has been printed in tract by Goggin's state
Central Committee"" with the injunction on the
first page ""Read aud circulate"" and by the efforts
os tbst Committee has been Gown broadcast over
the State. Some Of this seed we trust, may fall
On GOOD ground, where it viii bring forth hum
dredfold


Nor is Mr. Letcher himself wanting in the same
good work. He insists indeed, that ne was convert
ed to the doctrine that Slavery is political and So
ca good as long ago a. 1917 and he most strenuous
"" denies having had hand in circulating theRufner
pampblet: but in an address which he has just pub
lishcd. 10 the people of Virginia, he excuses his
heresies of l8i7 by quoting from an agricultural
address delivered about the same time by Mr.
Bruce of Halifax County, himself large slave
holder, and from the stin later declarations OF
Robert T. Scott, another distinguished Viz
pina Shareholder, in which Slavery is
treated with quite as little ceremony as in
the Ruffner pamphlet. ""It,"" says Mr. Bruce,
""the slaves we're removed from Virginia
""and North Carolina, We should soon have dense
""population which would give schools to our chill
""dren, market to our farmers, and those rail-
roads which we now clamor for, but which our
poverty and sparse population place far beyond
""our reach Now that all other avenues are 80
seduousy closed through which the people of
Virginia can be addressed on the true character OF
Slavery, it looks almost Proyidential to see the
Goggin Central Committee employed in circulating
the Ruancr pamphlet, and Mr.. Letcher simulta-
neously occupied in bringing to notice tho just and
sound suggestions which Mr. Bruce could no longer
himself utter without danger of being lynched."

societies on peculiarly Russian principle. If
any member proves derelict, they fall upon and
beat him thus, by striking arguments, appeal
ing to the sensbilites of those who are not to
be persuaded by less vigorous measures
These societies abound throughout the empire,
and so great has proved their influence that the
receipts from the excise have fallen off to no
small amount. This, however, is a temporary
evil, if it must be regarded as an evil, for what
is lost in taxes will be saved in the diminished
expenses of furnishing the unruly. In the same
proportion that the Use of alcoholic liquors is
abolished the call for police will lessen. II
only drunkenness could be stopped, the occupa.
tion of policemen, military and civil, would
depart.


These Russian societies are sort of per-
petual Lynch tribunal. They regularly try the
accused according to their own Codes and forms
and woe to the pledged member who breaks Ia,
oath. There ia no appeal and no escape. The
Minister of the Interior has issued circular

commenced his perilous walk, without the
/ slightest hesitation, treading firmly and con

The Republic says that the feat was easily
performed. Mons. Blondin walked up the
rope until he reached his destination, anC
down again to the place where he started
While Mr., Blondin weighs but 13O pounds
the weight Of the man carried was 16i

Chinese thief His crime, although he
was not clearly convicted of it, was
thought by many to justify the severe
punishment he received. 1t is common
for the world to justify cruelty by the
offense alleged to have provoked it. We
have no sympathy with this sort of reas-
oning, and think that nine times out of
ten where man is fogged by lawless
crowd, the deed is done more from a
british love of such entertainment than
out of regard to the supposed require
ments of justice. We hold it is greater
crime against society to participate in
one of these inhuman lynchings than to
steal; and in the case OF this miserable
| Chinaman would rather have stolen a
whole case of boots than to have been
guilty of laying one stroke upon his
back


But worse thing than this happened
on the night Of the same day. -Four or
FIVE white men, who would feel insulted
were their respectability called in ques-
ton, went under cover of darkness to a
cabin tenanted by three negroes, drove
them over two miles out of town in the
direction of Freeman's Crossing, tied
them and whipped them on the bare
back with raw hide. One of the
colored men was a stranger, except to
two or three of our citizens, who knew
him in Oroville and say that he is a GOOD
man; he was let off with FIVE lashes.
The other two had lived with the negro
who was sent to Nevada for stealing; and
for this, the only offense proved against
them, they Were severely beaten-one of
them until he tainted, as it is reported,
several times in succession. This one had
his back awfully cut up, and has since
fed the place. 1t would make us sick to
record such horrible cruelty, did not a
just indignation take the place of every
weaker feeling. 1t makes one ashamed
of human nature-or rather of creatures
who thus debase it by their brutality.


How this brave deed became public
we know not, but presume some of its
heroic perpetrators could not abstain
from privately boasting of their share in
it to some person who detested and pub
lished the act. It is said that the par
ties are known. If so they should be
complained of before the officers Of the
law. If such proceedings are allowed
to 60 unpunished, Or at least passed over
without legal Investigation, they will
stamp indelible and deserved disgrace
upon this whole community. San Juan
is celebrated for it's promptness in all
good deeds-for its liberal charities, oft
repeated, and for it's general intelligence
shall we suffer it now to become infa-
nous as the abode of a lawless body of
man-whippers? Should these foggings
continue-and they are on the increase
they will not remain confined to the
defenceless Chinese and Negroes, but
eue,y man, white, black or yellow, who
thinks proper to reprobate them, or to
say or do anything displeasing to these
mobocrats of the thong, will be liable to
their rage and may be dragged away as
these wretched blacks were, to be fogged
under cover of night and the wilderness.
We know very well that this last occur
renee will shock the sensibilities of
nearly every citizen; and feel confident
that if there are no legal steps taken in
the matter the guilty parties will not
escape the punishment of public scorn
and detestation.

From that Day, forward, commenced in

Statesmen have referred.

blood, the myrmidons of Slavery have precip-
itated a "" Conflict"" which else would have pro-
sressed slowly, moderately, safely, to all con-
cerned, until the Curse and Shame of our
Land had been gradually removed from it

elaborately furnished than the accounts in our
last issue. We make up the review from vari-


Gus quarters. It appears that John Brown, Of


Kansas notoriety, turns out to be the ringlead-


er, and the only object was the rescuing and
carrying off of slaves of whom there are seve-


raj thousand in the adjacent counties to Har-
per's Ferry. The whole plan of Brown and


his associates was laid in the most maddened
zeal. How any sensible men could make them
selves believe they could escape capture and
punishment by adopting the course pursued by
them is unaccountable. 1t was stated that this
man Brown was mortally wounded, but later
accounts say he is not. When he was brought
out of the engine house wounded, there was
some demonstration made to lynch him, but
Major Russell instructed the Marines to protect
the insurgents.


HARPER's FERRY, Oct. 19-The prisoners
have been committed to Charleslown Jail to
await the action of the grand jury, when they
Will be indicted and tried in Jew days.
The arrangement about the jurisd lction has
Ssen settled IN this way: The local authorities
are to try the prisoners for murder, and in the
meantime the United States authorities will
proceed on the charge of treason. Gov Wise
said to Mr.. Ould, the United States District
Attorney, that be had no objection to the Gen.
eraI government proceeding against the pris-
oners, that Is, what will be left of them by the
time the Virginia authorities have done with
them.


Brown is better and has ade a fuller state
ment OF his operations. He says that he rent
ed the farm OF DIR Kennedy SIX mon tbs ago, and
the rent Is paid until next March. He never
had over twenty-five men at the farm at any
one time that belonged to the organization, but
that he had good reason TO expect reinforce.
ments from Maryland, Kentucky, North and
South Carolina, and the Csnudas. He had pro-
vlded arms sufficient for fifteen hundred men,
including two hundred revolvers, two hundred
Shnrp's rifles, and a thousand spears, all of
which were left at the farm He had also an
abundance of powder and fixed ammunition
All the arms were from time to time brought
| from Connecticut and other eastern points to
Chambersbarg, Pa, and were directed 10 J.
Smith a. Sons, Kennedy Farm, his assumed
name. They were packed in double boxes SO as
to deceive the parties who handled them on
their way TO tue farm. He says that he made
one mistake IN either not OBTAINING the train on
Sunday night or else permitting it to go on un.
molested. This mistake, he seemed to infer,
exposed his doIngs too soon, and prevented his
relnforcements coming.


The names Of all his party at the Ferry, on
Sunday night, except three white men, whom
he admits that he sent away on an errand, are
as follows, with their proper titles under the
Provisional Government:


| Gen. John Brown, commander in chief
wounded, but will recover.


Capt. Oliver Brown-dead.


Capt. Watson Brown-dead.


Capt. John Kasi, of Ohio, raised in Virginia

1t also appears in evidence that the only
evidence before the Board of Commissioners
of the result of the election at said town of
Burnsville, was the two documents copies of
which are appended to the evidence herewith
reported, and marked respectively Schcd-
ules, ""D"" and ""E."" The one marked Sched-
ule I'D"" purpOrts to be a return of the votes
cast at that election in said town of Burns
vile, and to be signed by Mr.. Mcdonald
Chas. O'Neal and Timothy Mcnamara, as
judges, and by Patrick Lynch and James
Connolly, as clerks. 1t was admitted on the
hearing before the committee, on the part of
sitting members, and is evident by inspec-
ton, that the names of Chas. O'Neal and Mi
chael Mcdonald, were not written by them
selves, but by James Connolly, one of the
clerks. No evidence is in the case explana-
tory of this fact, although said Mcdonald,
O'Neal and Connolly were introduced as wit
ness by the sitting members and examined
upon other points arising in the case. No
other evidence of the votes cast at said town
of BurnSvie at said election is before the
committee, except that Ii. c. Hank testifics
that he voted then and there for the contest
ants and for John G. COuper for Reprcsen-
tatives to the State Legislature


1t was claimed before the committee on
the part of the contestants that the return
from said BurnSvlle) must be entirely re-
jccted and that there was thus no evidence
before the canvaSSerS or committee that the
sitting members received any votes at
said Burnsville. But the majority of the
committee are not willing to assume the re-
sponsabillty Ofrejecting the return as ''lrinaa
tacia"" evidence. They have however deemed
it their duty to examine throughly, the al
legged fraudulent voting in said sOwn.


In so doing they have been guided mainly
by the poll books in evidence of Glendale in
Scott County, and of Burnsville, aforesaid and
by the testimony of John B. Fish, who is
very intelligent and apparently unprejudiced
man, an engineer and surveyor, by education,
with the further facilities for observation and
knowledge in the matter afforded by his hav-
ing his house, store, mills, and tOwn-site To-
Gated directly on the dividing line between
Scott and Dakota Counties. The witnesses
brought forward by the sitting members be-
trayed such utter ignorance of the creation
of the line between said counties, that we
could give very little weight to their testimo-
ny, however honest they might be in giving it.


AS result of this examination the commit
tee unanimously agree that thirteen (13) per-
sons whose names appear on the document
hereto appended marked schedule I"" as hav-
ing voted at the Election in question in Burns
vile, are proved to have been residents of
Scott County. They further agree that five
other persons whose names appear in said
document as voting at Burnsville at said cleo
ton, appear by said poll list to have voted
twice each thcreat. A portion of the majority
who join in this report are of opinion that the
votes of those thus shown guilty of double
voting, should be entirely rejected. The others
think that only the second vote of each should
be thus thrown out. But this question proves
by the table and canvass to be not of practical
Importance, as the deduction of nine illegal
votes from those received by Ara Barton would
result in the election of Archibald NJ. Hayes,
in his place: and it would require the showing
of twenty-five illegal votes cast for Stephen
Newell, to elect Moses Bxler in his place.


The majority of your Committee therefore
unite in reporting to your honorable body in
addition to what they have already submitted
with the recommendation that it do pass, the
following resolution:


ResolUed, That Archibald NJ Hayes be and
he hereby is declared elected to and member
of this House, and that Ara Barton be, and he
hereby is declared not member of this House.


Your Committee would feel themselves not
doing justice to Mr.. Barton did they not state
explicitly that they have seen and heard moth
ing in the course of this examination tending
in the slightest degree to implicate Mr.. Bar
ton as planning countenancing or even know
ing of the frauds proved to have been per-
petrated at said election in said Town of
huntsville.

The sitting members, holding the certificates
of election from the proper canvassing board,
are, of course, prima .tacie entitled to their
seats. The burden of proof in commencing
the investigation, of course, rests upon the
contestants-to defeat the right to seats on
the part of the sitting members, and to es-
tablsh their own.


They show by the Auditor of Dakota
County, one of the Canvassing Board, that no
evidence of any election at Burnsvie was be-
fore that Board, except the papers, copies of
which marked respectively schedules Cd""
and E."" are appended to the report of the
majority of this committee.


These are claimed to be a return and poll
list from said town of Burnsville. Each pur-
ports to be signed by NJ Mcdonald, Charles
O'Ncal, and Timothy Mcnamara as Judges,
and by Patrick Lynch and Jas. Connolly, as
Clerks. ! lay no stress on the utter disregard
in both papers Of every technicalty required
by law; that they came into the Auditor
hand unsealed that neither Judges or Clerks,
nor either of them appear, nor are claimed to
have been sworn; that the return has in it
no such word as votes, ,'-saying only that
that ""at an election held at the house OF
james Carney, in the town of Burnsvie, and
county of Dakota, on the 18th day of Oct
1859, the following named candidates received
the number of set opposite their names )"" that
the numbers are expressed by figures, in
stead of being written out in words as re-
quired by law that the alledged return is not
certified by those signing as Judges, nor at
tested by those signing as clerks. Except as
by these matters may unite with others in
evidence to evince deliberate fraud in the
matter, the statute clearly compels us to dis
regard any lack of merely technical correct
ness in the papers.


But the papers themselves, especially when
taken in connection with other evidence in the
case, bear such unmistakable evidence OF
fraud, that cannot see how they can be re-
garded as any proof whatever, of the votes
cast at the Burnsville election.


The names of NJ. Mcdonald and Charles
O'Neal, signed as judges, and that of James
COnnoly, signed as one of the clerks, are evi
IDENTIFY to the most casual observer, written
by the same person; and the contestants ad-
NIT on the hearing before the committee that
they were all written by James Con
molly. All three of these persons testi-
fed on behalf Of the contestants upon
other matters arising in the case, but neither
of them explained this matter, as they might
easily have done, were it an honest, bona fde
transaction. On the contrary, it appears by
their testimony, that O'Neal went home from
the polling place before the return was made
up; that during the making of the return, a
drunken brawl took place outside the house
that the rioters broke into the room where the
judges and clerks were canvassing the votes
and making the returns (eXcluding all other
persons, contrary to the statute) that the
judges were attacked by the rioters; that one
Judge and one clerk seized the ballots (the
ballot box being smashed in the row. and
also the partly finished returns, and decamp-
ed to the house of said judge, where the clerk
James Connolly, finished the returns on the
following day instead of OH the day of elec-
ton, as required by law.


Phe return then comes to as ostensi6ly signed
Jy three Judges, but soith teco Of those sigma
tures admitted substantially to be toryeries.


Waving for the present, the question,
whether certifying officer could authorize
any other person to sign his name as such
certifying officer, we come to the question
whether any such paper, so tainted with fraud,
can properly be taken as evidence by the COM
mittee or the House.


In a court of law, it will not be questioned,
an instrument so tainted with fraud on its
face would be deemed nullity. Does not
the equitable rule which prevails in such in
vestigations as this, require similar view to
be taken of it?


Especially when we add to this the evidence
in this case of grossly fraudulent proceedings
throughout the pretended election at Burns
vile. The judges and clerks not sworn the
only Republican on the ground driven off by
threats, lest he should be witness of their
doings; the distribution gratis of whiskey
the one vote sworn by Ii. G.. Hauk to
have been cast by him for John G. Couper
mysteriously disappearing in the count, and
turning up in the returns as cast for Stephen
Newell the migration of voters from Scott to
Dakota, and from Dakota to Scott during the
day the invitation to buy Fish from the
strong minded widow, to cast vote, and her
going to the window, ballot in hand; the ex-
clusion from the room during the canvass of
all but the judges and clerks, Gin utter viola
ton of law the final row and riot in the course
of which the ballot box is smashed, one of the
judges seized by the hair of his head until re-
leaved by one of the clerks; the seizing of the
ballots and papers by clerk and judge and
their haSty retreat to another house the de-
ferring of making the return to the next day;
when, say, We add all this to the inherent
evidence of fraud presented by the pretended
poll list and returns, the conclusion is irres-
stible in my mind that said papers constitute
no returns, no evidence of any election at
Burnsville, of any votes there cast and must
be entirely rejected.


But waving for the purpose of the argu-
ment, the question Of fraud in the returns,
how then stands it. We have in that case
document signed by only one of board of
three. The statute specially requires the act
of at least a majority of any number of per-
sons to whom joint authority is given, in
order to exercise that authority. Here We
have the certificate of only Timothy McNa-
mara, out Of the three professed judges ofelec-
ton at Burnsvile, the names of the other
two, being admitted not to have been signed
by them.


l have therefore been driven to the conclu-
sion by the evidence in the case, that said
pretended returns should be disreg egarded, and
set aside.


The evidence in the case having thus left
the sitting members without proof of the
votes that may have been cast for them at
Burnsville, the burden of proof of course de-
volved upon them to supply that lack by
other evidence Of that election and the votes
cast thereat. This they have not done. We
are left without any proof of such election,
and of the votes cast for the sitting members
thereat. Deducting the alleged vote of said
town, from the official canvass, we find the
contestants elected over the sitting members,
Waldier, Newell and Barton.


Taking this view of the case, do not deem
it necessary to discuss the fraudulent voting
at Burnsvile on the day of the election in
question, in the matter of which do not dis
agree from the views of the majority of the
committee.


l therefore beg leave to report the follow
ng resolution, with the recommendation that
t be adopted by your honorable body:"

Judge DAVIES.",,"


SECOND TRIAL or JAMES GLASS FOR MURDER


The People. Ac, ast James Glass.
This morning, Mr.. VandervOort, the Clerk, called
the additional panel of hundred jurors, ordered for
today, but before the panel exhausted with
out one juror being obtained.


Tie District Attorney offered to accept any juror
who had been peremptoriy challenged by the defense.
After some discussion the names Of the jurors who
were absent yesterday placed in the box, and an
order was entered for further panel of one hundred
Jurors returnabe at o'clock p. m. this day The
abseutees Of yesterday called, and the twelfth
Juror was finally obtained.


The following are the names of the Jury:
Jasper f. Corning Terence NJ Lynch John Ltleeld Chas
Regina Chas L. Stewart, Chas. s. SchemerhOm Geo God
rev Alexander Clinch WIN. Long, Timothy b McElroy
Andrew d. Savage, WIN l.. stevens


Mr. Whiting objected to the juror, Wm +. Long
on the ground that he had been heard to say that Glass
ought to be hung. Mr.. Whiting offered to prove his
assertion by two witnesses whom he had in Court.
The Judge overruled the objection saying that IL
would be very improper to pursue the course proposed
by Mr. Whiting, after the juror had been questioned
and found competent.


Testimony was taken in the case until late hour in
the evening."

on Friday last. The names and residence
of parties arrested, are as follows:

Cady, of Madison County. K. t.; and
John I. Dedlashmutt, of Council Grove
Watson is boy, about IA years old; Ded-
lashmutt, is a prominent citizen of Coun-
Gil Grove. The people took the matter in
to their own hands, organized court, EN-
panneled jury of twelve men, and procee-
ded to trial McGeehe and the boy Wat
son, were acquitted; Dedlashmutt was re-
quired to give bail to answer the charge be-
fore the District Court, which he did:


The two Callaways were whipped ten
lashes each, and ordered to leave the place
in twelve hours, and the Territory in FIVE
days. Moody, Marble, Cady and Porter,
were whipped each ten lashes, and one side
of their heads shaved, and ordered to leave
the country as above. The Callaways are
the same men who were lynched in Allen
county few days ago. Something must
be done to stop horse-stealing, but we do
not believe shaved head and ten lashes
will have that effect. Hang every one pro-
we'd to be in the business, is the surest rem
edy. One of the horses stolen, is now in
the hands of W. B. Harrell, Sheriff of Nor
ris county. 1t is sorrel mare, about six
years old, white face and white feet; was
stolen by Moody, on the Marmaton, near

iudicious and striking remarks in its
issue of October 81


The investigation which has been
and is being made into the secret
history of the recent terrible and re-
markable outbreak will, we hope and
believe, be productive of good inau-
ences upon the popular mind in both
sections of the Union. 1t has two
lessons. which it seems to us that it
may very appropriately teach. The
first of these is the lesson which it
will convey to the North, teaching
them to look even with more than
their wide spread aversion upon the
principles and teachings Of those Wis.,
ionary fanatics among them who, like
Garrison & Co., claim that the con-
stitution oforr country sis covenant
with hell"" and that the duty of slaves
is to rise in the night time and free
themselves from thraldom by cutting
the threats of their masters and help
ing themselves to the property accu-
mulated by their unrequited toll. 1t
will, we say; teach the northern peo-
pie. when these fanatical abolition
lists go about through their cities and
towns. holding their periodical Satur-
MALTA, to look upon their principles in
the proper light, and will inspire in
their minds more of deep-seated
hostility to their wicked and disorgan-
izing rawlings. In this way the re-
suits of these investigations will af-
feet the northern mind for good.


On the South it ought likewise TO
make deep impression. Here, in
this Harper's Ferry riot, we have an
illustration which both precept and
example have before told us, is alto>
gether possible contingency in a
country in whose midst there exists
large and degraded class of humans
ity. We cannot take fire in our bo-
SONS and not be burned, the Scripture
and our own experience have taught
US. Neither can we have in our midst
four millions of serfs. whose color,
whose intellect. whose habits, whose
everything is di fferent from the rul-
ing element. without liabilities to the
same dangers that have always at
tended society in every country where
such large servile element has ex-
listed. San Domingo has taught this
lesson to the world. Southampton
has taught it to the people of this
country and this state. Scarcely more
insecure are those people who work
by day and sleep by night underneath
the craters of Vesuvius and Etna
and who are liable to an irruption at
any inrment of burning lava, than
many communities of our southern
states where the slaves number two
or three to one of the whites. These
}s'aves, by their constant and rapid H.
legitimate intermingiing with the
whites. as well as by the very condi-
tion Of contact between superior and
inferior races. are becoming in each
generation more intelligent, and con-
sequently more tie objects of dread

than they are shedding their origina

they are acquiring more of the char

We ought to look these things all in
the face now. They have an impor'
liant PRACTICAL bearing on our socia
condition. When we hear men anc
papers either openly advocating oil
covertly winking at revival of the
odfous slave trade, it is time that pub.
lie attention was called to these things
1t is useless to rail at wicked and
reckless aboli,ionists, like Brown, who
in their blind fanaticism think-ii
they think or care at all-that they
are doing God-service when they
teach and aid slaves to rise against
their masters. There will always be
men that have minds and must think
and having tongues which are free to
speak will never stop having opinions
or expressing them upon either the
justice or the expediency Of slavery
in the abstract. Our security hes in
advancing not in retreating. We
must look to the future of the two ra-
ces. We must go back and read up
the opinions of the fathers of the re-
public as to the probable issue of sla-
very in this country. We must know
that the best men of that era busted
themselves in trying tofnd a RENEE

We have had several recent instances in
this country of the inaccuracies of the judg-
ments pronounced, at first view, against the
capacity of particular sections to support pop
ulations. ...l. - ss d,


Michigan was once reported to be region
worthless for agriculture, by the Government
surveyors, and was so geneeally regarded
down to as late as the year 1882. When
Gen. jackson offered the State of Maine three
millions of acres in Michigan for cession to
Great Britain of her territory north of Saint
John, he was met with the responsibility
not offer us lands in the moon ?"" And the
opinion of Michigan which prevailed in Maine
at that time, was universal in the country
And although that opinion of Michigan has
since yielded to better knowledge of the
subject, yet it is only within half dozen years
that the real capacities of that State for ag-
ricuture are beginning to be fully understood.


The first swarm of gold hunters pronounced
California to be an unlimited desert, and in
more than one letter written there during the
early period of American occupation, it was
said, and perhaps truly, that there were thou
sands of persons who had been lured thither
by Colonel Fremont description ofthe climate
and productions, and that they would gladly
revenge themselves by lynching him, if they
| had him in their power. Those doleful ac-
counts were given by those who saw and des
| cribed the parched fields of California in the
dry season, when it has, to experienced eyes,
the aspect of desert, although even then il
| is not so in truth, because the dried grasses
of that region are wonderfully nutritious, and
will support animal life in most teeming
abundance Still another error of these des
criptions was the forgetfulness of the fact, that
it is sufficient if only small portion of each
year is adapted to the culture and growth o
artificial crops and this forgettulness was the
more remarkable, as large part of the set
tiers in California were from the regions where
the earth is locked up by frosts and covered
with snow during long winters.


i 1t takes time to become accustomed to new
methods of agriculture, and to American ir
igation is new, although practiced from tirn'
ilnmemorial. Water is essential to vegeta


ton but if it can be had, it matters littl'

Four years hence, the same men and journals now so loud in detraction will be ready to compare another administration with that of the glorious old statesman, James Buch anan.s

 The Pocahontas Advertiser tells some stories of ""the meanest man."" Here is one of them:

 ''Several years since, man by the name of Minor was hung in Lawrence county. He was in debted to our mean subject to the extent of FIVE CENTS! which, in his creditors eyes looked as big as wagon body. On the day that Minor to be executed, his creditor applied to the jail to be admitted, but refused. He therefore stationed himself on the road and as the melancholy cortege passed by, he called out: Oh, Minor. that little there is between us!' Yes, ,' said Minor, how much?' Five cents.' 'Well,' was the re- ply, aint got nary red now, but Ill pay you when we meet again""

 The South Arkansas Democrat has capital article, which we annex, entitled

 Capital Punishment.

 The recent trial of the negro Alfred, for the crime of murder suggests the subject of capital pun ishment to the writer. We have no commonplace plaitudes to offer on this theme, and only mention it to note few pecuarties in the people of the west, in regard to carrying into effect the criminal code. One peculiarty, is the readiness with which they resort to lynch-law. By the first blast of in dignaton they are frequently hurried forward to talIy hnar md without trial, but let their passions subside, and the case must be very aggravated in which they will sanction capital punishment. Reason would seem to dictate different course. Hardy pioneer habits would be expected to beget infeXible ideas of justice, and a sternness in the administration of the law unknown in the older States, while at the same time, the criminal code would be expected to be more strict in order to meet the requirements of a lawiess population. Such should be the case.- One good result would follow-desperadoes would then be certain of stern justice, where now they frequently trust to the positive dislike which per sons manifest for executing the law, as well as to the laxity of the law itself True the penitentiary is often brought in requisition but penitentiaries in the west are somewhat like the jails-liable to tricks of witchcratt and not unfrequently open to some mysterious sesame

 Another thought subjects itself-were the crim- inal laws more strictly executed, would have fewer abortive indictments for carrying concealed weapons, for where the court voluntarily relin- pushes the punitive power or carries it out mad equatey, every individual feels authorized to be- come his own protector, and, too frequently, his own avenger. It was to prevent this that law first established and inst in proportion to its inef tciency will be the essness of individuals.

 We hope the day is not far distant when the majesty of the law will be acknowledged, and juries will regard it not only serious responsibility to take the life of fellowman, but likewise a seri- tI,a justice, and to jeopardise the lives of good and worthy citizens by fallacous ideas of right and CT roneous notions of what is charitable and merci- ful.''

 The following, from the Van Buren In teligencer, shows that there is rivalry in theatricals in that quarter If Mrs. Pal mer played '' Our Nan"" they had a good character well rendered.:

 ""PALMER's PAVILION THEATRE.-We see by the bills that this new institution will be in full operation with good company of actors. To-mor- row night will be performed in the pavilion on the bank of the river, in this city the Imaginable farce of the Yankee Duellist, and to conclude with the play of Our Man.""

 We clip the following from that paper:

 C No WONDER Hrs AFRAID.-Brigham ' oung keeps shut up, from tear-it requires the opening of over twenty doOrs exclusive of grates, to reach his sleeping apartments. Whether all this barring of gates and locking of doors is to keep the Gen tiles out the soldiers out, his harem associates out, is not mentionedby our informant. Probably, however, he is afraid oi them all.'

 The Arkansas Baptist is now perma- nent institution. Its circulation is from l,600 to 1,S00 and increasing The editor comments our action in refusing to pub- fish another comic sermon. Such things when told for the humor Tn them, without any attempt to ridicule religion, will be popular and the members of the church can afford to smile at them. A liberal man can tell joke at his own expense. But, where the humor is overshadowed by the apparent desire to scof, or where 1t con sists merely in caricaturing certain forms or doctrines, it ceases to please.

 The Pocahontas Advertiser is increasing in circulation. The editors can conduct a paper but one of them can't drivea buggy. We submit this point to Dr. Mcclure

 The Fort Smith Herald thinks it pro- per to

 'Give the Scamp a Notice.

 A man by the name of Vincent formerly of Wal dron, Scott county, Ark, left on Wednesday morn ing in the Memphis stage with his wles sister, leaving his wife and children to shift for them selves. He is tall sandy headed carpenter""

 The Batesville Democratic Sentinel ex- amines the position or positions of the edi- tor of the Balance and gives scathing re- view. The opposition in the south are at tempting to ride two horses at once. They want to join the black republicans yet are afraid of being absorbed. They are willing to share the booty but dread being accused of the crime.

 The Brownsville Echo notices the arri- val of new flour in that town. That paper says that. the locomotive of the Memphis and Little Rock railroad will soon be put ling and snorting among that people.

 The Camden Herald is trying its 'pren- tice hand on making sarcastic or witty pa ragraphs by comments on sentences from other papers. Nothing is easier to those whose tastes that way incline. See here: |"" Many man has licked the hand that smote him.''

 0. Herold..

 This was according to the law of retalia- tion for 1t was lick for lick,

 That is meant for wit and here is one in tended for sarcasm.

 Tine Ouachita Herald, speaking of the democratic masses, says:

 '.This habit of obedience has been continued so long that it has become second nature and nothing short of some great public calamity will ever over turn it, and open the eyes of the people to true sense of their ensaved conditon.'

 As that paper has failed to open the eyes of the people, it may be considered as falling short of d great public calamity, be- ing only Mle one.

 In an article upon the Virginia election that paper says:

from Gov. Weller's annual message are
worthy to be reproduced and carefully
read:


The frequent recurrence of these ex-

retard the settlement of the State, and
turn the tide of emigration in differ
ent direction. Men will not like to
bring their families into community
where their lives and property are at the
mercy of an infuriated populace. These
lawless acts are doing incalculable injury
to us abroad, because they make the
impression that the bad men outnumber
the good, or else that the Criminal Courts
utterly fail to perform their duty. 1t
would be humiliating to admit the truth
of either. Good citizens should hunt
up the testimony, and see that indict-
ments are presented against these men,
who are striking at the vitals of society.
When men unite to take the law into
their own hands, to avenge their wrongs,
whether real or imaginary, good citizens
must combine to bring them to punish
ment, or else there is an end to all Gov

executions are not arrested, our noble
State, with all her wealth and inexhaust-

SHOOTING ArFRAY.-Quite serious atiai


transpired few days ago, on Swan Prairie


The circumstances, as detailed, are as follows


During the time of the annual payment mad


to the Chippewas a year ago. Chppew'


warrior was shot dead by another of differ
ent band, of the same tribe. Although strong
efforts were made at the time by the civil au
thorities to effect an arrest, yet the murderer
escaped. Nothing was known of his where
abouts until he turned up last week at Swan
River. Having entered the camp, the squaw
| of the murdered warrior recognized him. She
Immediately procured gun and shot him
dead. His brother who happened to be pres
ent levelled his rifle and killed the squaw on
the spot. Her brother then shot the latter,
and was in turn killed. Thus, four had fallen
to satiate the retaliating vengeance so sweet
to savages who have no proper conception OF
what justice is Perhaps the mode of infiict-
ing punishment for heinous crime is more
preferable than committing criminals to rot
ten als, from which they escape long before
their trial, and thus they are permitted to
roam at large and prove terror to those in
any way instrumental in effecting their arrest.
Even ""lynch law"" has been resorted to by
ciuilized citizens of Minnesota, supposed to be
embued with all the exalted prerogatives
flowing from christian enlightenment. Then,
why condemn the 'poor Indian"" for deeds of
violence? the result of his notion of melting
out justice; although, while we cannot sane
ton the modus operondi, yet parallel instances
are not wanting to show that his civilized
brother can be guilty of far more aggravating
crime. Better far to regulate our own incon-
sistencies, and thus be enabled to reprove
crime in others.


ADVANCE IN WHEAT.-Owing to the pres
ence of several St. Louis and Milwaukee pro-
duce dealers, with a plentiful supply of
""rocks,"" an upward movement has taken
place in the grain market. Wheat is now
held at Is cts. per bushel. This is a notch
above the views of purchasers, but the signs
of the times plainly indicate that they will
have to give in. My individual opinion, plain
ly expressed, is, that prices will go up. Let the
farmers keep an eye open to their interests.


No New ENGLAND SUPPER.-For some
reason not known to the writer, the Sons of
New England have neglected to have their an
nual Festival at this point. Last year some
objected to confning their invitations and
speeches, &C., exclusively to such as happen
cd to be born within the portals Of the ""glo-
rious Six"" thought it smacked of ""stand
aside, we are holier than thou"" and thus
encourage local pride and prejudice, altogether
at variance with that congeniality which should
characterize citizens of new country
Whether this has been the reason of dispens-
ing with the celebration this year, am unable
to say. The only public notice taken of the
Landing of the Pilgrims"" that has come to
my notice in Minneapolis this year, was ser
mon preached on the subject by the Rev. Mr..
NICHOLS, in the Congregationalist Church last
Sabbath.


A HoP.-A Christmas Ball will come off
at the Nicollet' on next Monday night. Of
course it is not necessary to say, that the gen.
tlemanly host will have all things in order

has made a full confession of all he knew o
) the affair. He duplicates many persons here
totore not suspected, and states that rising
was expected about the same time in Kentucky
All the facts are not published, and when they
are, a sensation is expected.


At the trial of Brown, an attempt was about
being made to urge the plea of insanity in his
behalf, but he Indignantly denied the truth ol
such an assertion. He seems rather to glory
IN his present position.


Lawson Bolts, the counsel for Brown and his
contederates, is son of the late Gen. Thomas
II. Bolts, of Virginia, and nephew of John NJ.
Bolts and the Princess Catharine d. Murat, of
Florida. His mother is grand-niece of Gen.
Washington. Mr.. Bolts is said to be a young
lawyer who relies on his profession for subsis-
tence. and a man of good ability and spotless
character.


1t is thought that Fred Douglass has fed to
Canada, to avoid becoming involved in the Har-
per's Ferry difficulty.


Another insurgent. named Alfred Hazlett,
arrested at Carlisle, Pa, has been conveyed
back to Virginia.


| A dispatch from Charlestown, on Tuesday ?,
the 25th ult., says: The reason given for hur.
rying the trial is, that the people of the whole
county are kept in a state of excitement, and
large armed force is required to prevent at.
tempts at rescue. 1t is presumed that they
will demand separate trials. After conviction,
but few days will be given them before their
execution. 1t is thought that all but Brown
will make full confession.


A fellow named Lynch alias William ]. Sto-
burg, supposed to be implicated in the affair,
has been arrested and confined at Charlestown
There is great excitement at Charlestown, and
the town is guarded by large body of troops.


1t is stated that Brown has given the sheriff
an order on DR.. Murphy, paymaster at the Har.
per's Ferry armory, for the three hundred dol
lars taken from him, to purchase comforts for
himself and fellow prisoners.


There is a report at Washington that the
Secretary of War has received, since the affair
at Harper's Ferry, an insoent letter, purport-
ing TO come from the notorious Cook, dated at
Chambersburg, Pa, informing him that it is his
intention to march an army of several thousand
men and take Harper's Ferry and CharIestown,
and liberate the prisoners, aud TO perform sun
dry other ridiculous feats!


| Alexander R. BoteIer, member elect to Con.
gress, has collected from fifty to one hundred
letters from the citizens Of the neighborhood of
Browns house, who searched it before the ar
rival of the marines. The letters are in the
possession of Andrew Hunter, ESQ.,, who had a
large number of letters obtained from Browns
house by the marines and other partes among
them is a roll of the conspirat tors containing
| forty-seven signatures; also a receipt from
Horace Greeley for letters, &c., received from
Brown. and an accurately traced map from
Chambersburg to Browns house.


G. S. GOOD FOR 1000 MEN.-There are also
copies of letters from Brown stating that as the
arrival of too many men at once would excite
suspicion, they should arrive singly; and let

thousand men wanted, G. S. toas good for one

F. ]. Merriam, of Boston. who had some con-

who caped before the taking of the Arsenal,
has since died of his wounds. He was hurried.

Who is Captain Conspirator Brown! CO.
temporary makes this response: He is the
son of wealthy farmer of Hudson, Portage
county, Ohio, by the name of Owen. or Squire
Brown, as he was generally called. John
Brown was born in Litchfeld county, Connec-
ticut, but resided for more than thirty years in
Hudson township, Ohio, on a dairy farm, but
subsequently, embarked in wool growing, in
which business he was quite successful, until
he accompanied very large venture Of the
finest quality of that article 10 England. This
speculation resulted in a ruinOus loss, and from
that time to This he has been more or less ab-
sorbed in the furtherancs of Abolition views, on
which subject he was complete fanatic""


The New York Tribune says that John E.
Cook, one of Browns men, Commissioned as
Captain,) was born in Haddam, Conn.,, where
his parents, who are highly respectable people,
now reside. He is a brother in-law of a we'll
known merchant in New York, and four or five
years ago he studied law in Williamsburg -
; Three years ago he went to Kansas, and re.
mained there about one year, and at the exp.
ration of that time he returned to Williams

notoriety of his favorite mark and his
matchless skill instantly occurred to all,
accounting for much that was unaccount-
able in these occurrences. This produced
great change in public feeling. The
better sort began to conceive that they un-
derstood the whole matter The lynching
j Jack had received was fresh in their
memories. and they supposed that its Sc
verify had shaken his mental balance and
made him a maniac, and that the disease
had endowed him with the marvellous cum
ming, the staunch, murderous hate, and the
unnatural appearance which had created
such sensation. They could not under
stand how being so simple hearted and
sluggish as he was reputed to be, could
have been reused or stung to such deeds
by the mere depth and power of his natu-
raj passions. But monomanic or not, such
a vengeance and the daring conduct Of the
whole affair, were very imposing to their
associations and prepossessions, and they
sympathized heartily with him. 1t was
only while the general uncertainty left
every man in doubt whether his own per-
son might not be next the object of this
murderous aim, that the public were dis
posed to back the rangers in whatever vio-
lent measures they might choose to resort
to, to drag the secret to light, and the
actor to punishment; but now that was
apparent his whole hate was leveled
against the rangers, and all that uncertain
ty was confined to them, be he the devil,
ghost, mailman or Jack Long, the public
had no intention Of interfering again. 1t
was a personal issue between him aud
them; they might settle it between them
selves. Indeed, men felt in their inmost
hearts that every man Of the ten engaged
in the lynching Of Jack Long, deserved a
dozen times to be shot; and now they
looked on coolly, rather enjoyingthe thing,
and earnestly hoping that Jack might
have the best of it.


And of this there seemed to be strong
probability, fo- the regulators made only
one attempt to get together but another
of their number being killed on his way to
the rendezvous, his body bearing that well
known and fearful signature Of skill, the


remaining five, perfectly unnerved and
overwhelmed with terror, retreated to
their houses, and scarcely dared for seve-
raj weeks to put their heads outside their


own doors.


The class to which Jack had belonged,


at least those of them who had managed


to. keep footing during the relentless


prescription of the regulators, now began


to look up, and limited that they had


known of Jacks return from the time of


Stoner's murder, and had aided and abet-


ted his purposes in every way in their


power furnishing him with fresh horses,


when the noble animal he rode back from


the States become fatigued, assisting his


flights and concealments, and furnishing


him with information, as we'll as spreading


the exaggerated stories about him. One


bluff, old fellow remarked


""Y You are fools to talk about ack's be-


ing crazy! He's as calm and as cold as


a frosty morning up in old Kentuck; and


his heads as clear as bell He has just


got his Indian fghtin' and tory hatin' blood

blood, you know, that's dangersomer


than a catamount, when it once gets riz J""


Jack was now frequently seen, but it


was known that his work was only half


done, and that he meant TO finish it, and


he was regarded with great curiosity and


awe, The five wretched men were en-


tirely unstrung and panio-stricken. They


made no attempt at retaliation, but all


their hopes seemed to lie in the effort to


get out of his reach. That long, heavy


rife haunted them day and night. They


saw its dark muzzle bearing on them from


every bush, and through the chinks Of


their own cabins!


One of them, named White, who was
an inveterate topper, with all his terror,


could not resist his inclination for liquor,


and, after confinement in his house OF

astonished at what they considered his


""backing out"" joined clamorously in hoot-


ing his retreat.


The fools! They made fatal mis-


take in supposing he left the insult unre-


sented for any fear for himself. Jack Long


had young wife at home, and his love


for her was stronger than his resentment


for his own dignity. His passions were


slow, and had never been fully aroused


none of them, at least, but his love, and


that presented her instantly, forlorn and


deserted, with her little ones, in this wild


country, should he throw away his life
with such fearful odds; and seeing the
turn the affair was likely to take, he pru-
IDENTIFY determined to get away before it
had gone too far. But had any of those


men seen the spasm of agony which shiv-


cred across his massive features, as these


gibbering voices rang upon his ears in in-
suit which no proud, free hunter might en-


dure, they would have taken the hint, to


beware of chatting the silently foaming
boar any longer.


This was an ill-starred day for Jack,


though from this day troubles began to
thicken about him. The even tenor OF
his simple, happy life was destroyed, and
!, dignity and courage followed each Other
fast. Hinch never forgave the unlucky
skill which had robbed him of his proud
est boast, that of being the best marks
man on the frontier; and he swore, in
base vindictive hate, to dog him to death
, or make him leave the country. Soon af-

rich and powerful planter, disappeared

quote from the Southern Citizen, edited by
the celebrated John Mitchell. lie says


""Adopted citizens, when they are called upon in
an American Court of Justice to renounce upon
oath all duty and allegiance to any monarch on
CQrtn ana 10 take on tlem tile OuIleS ana feSOOn-

that if they sOemnly renounce all cl i'm to the
protection of their former government they en-
title themselves to the projection of this Republic.


Let them give up that too ilattering idea the
doctrine of our government is RoaU that a natnr-
allied citizen owes divided allegiance-an allie
glance varying with latitude and longtude-that
though citizen of this country (nominally y)while
on these shores, he loses that character the mo.
ment he travels abroad for business or for pleas
ure-that the doctrine of the right of expatriation
is moonshine; and that the claim of an European
sovereign to military servlce-or of course to any
thing elso-and the sovereign right to enforce the
same-are paramount and superior to the prlvi-
leges of an American citizen, for which the emil
grant has waited five years. and to which he has
been at last solemnly admitted in a Court of

Well, sir, we can't help that is So""


The Irish-American, published at New
York, by Lynch d Cole says:


SHALL WE BE PROTECTED?


""Untl within few days past, we had been un-
der the impresslon-nevc heretofore disturbed
or overclouded-that natuIalized foreigners, hav.
ing duly complied with the requirements Of the
Constitution and the Statutes enacted by Con-
gress, became, ipso fdcto, CITIZENS of this Repub


lie, equal in every respect (save the excepted mat
ter of eligibility to the Chief Magistracy,) to ma
uve-bOrn Americans, and equally entitled with
them to the protection Of the arms and influence
Of the Confederation in every lawful enterpris in
which citizen may engage. We believed fur
thermore, that the oath ofallegance taken by the
naturalized citizen, and accepted by the United
| States, was bond between them, by which the
Republic, in exchange for the featy sworn to her
by her adopted child, pledged herself to release
| and guarantee him against the claims and pre-
tensions ofall powers and potentates whatsoever
even as he, with his whole heart renounced them
| in her fag0r. We thought too that this princi-
pie was Of those for which the United States
contcndcd in 1912, when they did not hesitate, in
pursuance of it, to measure their infant force a.
ganst the richest and strongest power in the Old
World; that it had been maintained by General |
Scott in the case of the Irish prisoners taken in |
Canada by the British during that war; and again |
enunciated by the administration of Gen. Pierce |
in the case of Martin Koszta. 1t would appear |
however according to our present Secretary Of |
State (and exc the New York Herald that in all
these ideas we have been wofully in error-pro- |
ping, in fact, in Cimerean darkness for the true |
solution of the nature and attributes of adopted
citizenship""


IMPERFECT CITIZENSHIP.


""The more we reflect upon the policy-as re-
CARDS the relations between this country and the
despotic governments of Europe-deveOped by
the letter of General Cass which we gave last
week, the more convinced we become of the i'm
portance of its bearing, not alone upon the inter
ests of adopted citizens but upon those of the Re-
public at large,-the more impressed are we with
the duty that is incumbent upon us to resist, by
every means in our power, the practical applica-
tion of this heterodox doctrine which recognizes
distinction between citizens never dreamed of
heretofore. 1t creates, in fact two distinct class
es of citizens-perfect and imperfect-a state of
things the possible existence of which evidently
never entered into the minds of the trainers of the
Constitution, and which, in IFS very nature, is OPP
posed to that true and simple principle of Repub
| licau equality to which this country is indebted
for its present proud position and advancement
in national prosperity, and on the strict adher-
| ence to which we can alone depend for the sta
bility and permanence of its institutions. Ofwhat
value is such imperfect citizenship either to the
recipient OF to these United States, in whose
name it is said to be conferred Ii the subject
still owe allegiance to the power he has forsworn,
and the United States, in the person of its Minis
ter and Executive, acknowledge his Indebtedness,
then is the whole ceremony of his naturalization
fraud and farce, for the legitimate inference is
that he cannot even if he would shake off this
subjection, and that it clings to him closely on
American soil as on that of his birth. The Uni
ted States, then, demands other adopted children
every thing that she demands from the native
born, their allegiance, their love, their blood i
necessary I'm exchange she gives to the latter
all that her power affords freedom at home-pro
lection and the ensured respect Of the worlC
abroad; to the former, according to Gen. Cass
and those from whom he takes his inspiration
: she affords only the sanctuary given in Older
} times to the hunted outlaw, the leave to exercis


the franchise and become beggars at the bacl
:. doors ofpower for crumbs of place and pelf;-t
become money-grubs-to eat, drink and be merry
so long as they choose to remain within her i'm
e mediate boundaries. The moment you dare
e pass beyond these, says General Cass your cit


zenship falls from you like ill-6tting cloak an
) leaves you naked and defenceless, to bear th


eers or the vengeance Of the rulers whom yo
a have provoked by abandoning them. Instead {


protecting the adopted citizen against the claim
Is the allegiance which he compelled to renounc
e at the time of his naturalization he is abandone


the moment that claim is put in, and thus all ri
N cprocity offealty and protection between him an
