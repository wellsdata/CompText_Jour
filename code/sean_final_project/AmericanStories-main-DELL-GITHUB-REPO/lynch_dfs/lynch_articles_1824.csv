(as far as his stays weuld permit him to wrig-

Paddy scraped, and begged, and borrowed,
and at lest, by letting his old father into his
scheme, contrived to sqeezc out of his saw
incs the ncedful for the excursion. When
ali was ready, Miss Biddy, under pretencc Of
sickness, retired early one afternoon to her
room, boltcd the door, and then, with all the
delightful and romantic joys of an clopcmcnt
bolted through the window into the arms
of her cxpectant swain, who conducted her
with protcstations of eternallovc toacovered
carr, intending to carry her to kingstown,
and thence to Liverpool. OFF they went, and
Paddy, elatcd blythe dexterity of his scheme,
prepared alettcr for old Stccplechasc, which
he threw in at Biddy window.

The next morning carly old Stecplcchase
knocked at his daughters door, and, receiving
no answer, i'll Il twinkling forced an en-

feelings till the mare was hcoughtto the door
and he then drove 10 kingstown, which h
reached Just in time to step on board OF til
Bristol steamer. On his arrival at Bristol, h
posted without stopping at Southampton
where he found the steamer which runs iron
that place to Havre dc Grace. An offer Q
ESQ induced the Captain to put to sea wit

then took up his station at Mcuricc's, and
having rcfreshc himself, quietly waited tn
arrival of the runaways.


In due time, up drove, with furious haste

his prize, full of triumph & cXultation, inhal
