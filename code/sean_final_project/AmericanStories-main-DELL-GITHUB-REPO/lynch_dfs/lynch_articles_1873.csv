CHURCH WEDDING Thursday last Mid.
dletown enjoyed that peculiar sensation created
by church wedding On that day, at l2!
o'clock, in the Episcopal Church, Mr.. Julian
Cochran son Of John p J and Miss Lizzie NJ.
Cochran daughter of RObt. w. Cochran J
were Joined together in matrimOny by the Rev.
II. A. Skinner, Episcopal clergyman of Elk
ton. The church was crowded. The organist,
Mr.. r. l.. Price, gave few excellent volun-
taries while the congregation were waiting.
The decoration was handsome. The church
was darkencd and the gas lighted. Brides
maids and groOmsmen we're dispensed with
The bridal candidates we're accompanied to the
altar by four ushers, viz Frank p Cochran,
brother of the bride Frank j. Pennington,
John s. Crouch, and Frank Lynch. The bri-
dal tour is to Niagara.


The UPSET SALES. .-Ex Sheriff Hargadine
resold the balance of the Jacob Williams real
estate in this town last Thursday. The farm
on which Mr.. W. resides, 80 acres, was sold to
John ii. Bishop fer $4,050; the residence, in
this town, to N. +. Wilds, for 81 ,502, and the
l0-acre wood tract to Edw. Blais (now owner
of the ""homestead'') for $255. We may add,
as matter Of interest. that these prices show
an advance over the former purchases of over
$500 for the farm and $3.50 for the house.
That such should be the case, just at this par
ticulary panicky season, is considered favorable
indication towards the advance in real estate.
Whether or not these sales will stick we cannot
say. Mr.. w. says il all depends upon his
inclination in the mstter."

THE SHOCKING TRAGEDY NEAR SALISBURY,",,"THE SHOCKING TRAGEDY NEAR SALISBURY, MD.


Telegraphic advccs on Saturday brought
the news Of terrible murder near Salisbury,
Md, the victim being Mary Amelia Shock ley,
beautiful girl of fifteen, and her slayer, Geo.
w. Hall, youth of nineteen und an unsuccess-
full lover of his victim. We gather the follow.
ing additional particulars Of the terrible affair
from special dispatch to the Baltimore San ::


Hall has for sometime prOtessed an ardent
passion for Miss ShOckley which was apparent


y reciprocated. On the day of the murder
Miss Shockley left the district school, in which
she was pupil, in company with four small
children. She had probably proceeded one
hundred yards from the school house when
Hall met her, carrying gun III his hand. lie
addressed some language to her, and she re-
piled in an amlable manner. Hall then asked
her why she had not answered his Dote, writ
ten few days before She replied that she
could not, implying that she was unwilling to
do so. He told her she could have answered
his note as well others she had written to,
and proceeded to say that he intended to
shoot her then and there. To this threat she
replied, ""Pshaw, George Hall, you cant
frighten me-""


Hall then asked the children if Miss Shock
ley S brother Elijah, youth of sixteen, was at
school, and upon receiving a negative answer
ordered little girl who was standing by the


side of his victim to move away, as he intended


to shoot Amelia Shockly, and then deliberately


raised his gun aud fred at her. The load took


effect Just under the shoulder blade, and en-


tered her heart. The unfortunate girl ex.


claimed, ""Oh, LOrd!' and fell to the ground
Her murderer fed through the neighboring


woods. The children notified their teacher


Mr.. Isaac s. Adams, of the sad affair, and tha


gentleman hastened to the scene OF the tragedy


and found Miss Shockley lying upon her side


in the middle of the road with blood spoutinl


out of terrible wound in her side, and spirit


ing from her nose and mouth as she gasped il


the agony of death. He raised her head auC


asked her to speak to him. She tried to 10 81


but her strength was inadequate, and she fel
back and expired without having been able t
articulate word The body was conveyed L

THE HUNTINGDON TRAGEDY.",,"LOVE uNRETURNED TAR AND FEATHEBs-THE


LADY IN THE CASE"" SUMMONED TO VIEW HER


FEArHERED LovER-A PROBABLE MURDER-THE


MIssING BODY FOUND.


Last Friday, two oystermen found the mutt
lated remains OF man, in the water between
Cold Spring Harbor, and Oyster Bay, on Long
Island. They have since been identified az those
Of Chas. @ Kelsey, Of the town of Huntingdon,
few miles distant from where they were found.
He has been missing since the 4th Of last No.
vember.


Associated with this discovery is most singu-
lar and shocking narrative OF love, outrage, and
crime. MIR. Kelsey was young aud wealthy
resident of Huntingdon, with All ambitious, II
indiffsrently exercised, turn for literature. He


wrote what was intended for poetry; and he fell
in love with Miss Julia Smith another vlllager.


His suit did not prosper. She accepted the at
tentons OF Mr.. Royal Sammis, who remonstrat-
ed with him on his unwecome attentions, and
he promised to foreg0 them. Here the ulner-
ence begins between his friends aud his foes.
The latter say he wrote indecent letters to- and
constantly persecuted, his coy iadntordtd. The
former say he did no such thing, and was too
much gentleman to think Of annoying one he
loved. The foes however. assumed his guilt,
and resolved to punish hin. This they did by
masking themselves waylaying him. stripping
him on a bitter cold night last November, cut


ting off his long. poetic curls. gashing his head
in doing 30, anu covering MIN from nbdu 10 iOOl


with tai and feathers after which they invited a


party OF ladies' and among them the object OF
Ills unrequted affections, to inspect him, kind
v holding a lantern to expose the agony
# shame OF the wretched maltreated man. At
the Lantern he hurled b5ot, and brokef ON his


captors and was never seen again. He was


heard at home, going down-stairs into the yard,
and next morning bucket was found by the


well, with which he had evidently tried to
cleanse himself. There were evidences OF a
L. ~. hNF md a n n
| and wheels leading toward Lioyd's Beach. five
miles off. AT the beach his shirt bloody, was
| found with one boot, two lemons, anu neck
| tie The next day, James Hood, OF Lloyds
| Beach, said he saw two men with large bundle
| in a boat the night before, and they returned
without the bundle. There were now two, OF
| ather three theories about Kelsey. One, that
| he had made away with himself in fit OF pass
| ionate shame; another, that ho had been muir
| dered on the principle that dead men tell nc
tales. as in his struggles he had torn the masks
| from two OF his assallant5 and declared that he
| recognized them. The third theory started by
/ his avowed foes, was that he had kept away
/ simply to create a sensation, and that his where
| ab0nts we're perfectly well known.


The village was in ferment, Which hat
/ pcarcelv subsidized ever since. Henry II. Kelsey
| a BROTHER made an affidavit before Justice Mont
| fort, accusing DIR. George u. Banks, Royal John
| and David Sammis Claudus b. and Arthul
| Prince and others, all of them prominent mem
| bers Of the First Presbyterian church of the will
/ age, OF being the perpetrators of the outrage
/ The Justice held secret investigation agalns
| the protest of the accused, which resulted il
| their indictment for riot and assault The tria
| was set down for Sept. 18th, but was transferre'
| few days ago by an order from Judge Barnard
| to the Court OF Oyer and rerminer, which meet
/ in October.


This is the main part Of the story, up to thu
| time of the discovering of the body. The tw'
/ oystermen who caught 1t sent for the Coroner
| and an inquest has been held. The remains still
| had some tar aud feathers sticking to them, ant


they were positively identified by watch-chain
| a comb, and some other articles. 1t was testte
| to- before the inquest that the clothing OF tn


deceased found Lear his house, after the lynch
| ing was bloody.


The remains were ahockingly muti'ated, an
| without head or arms Kelzey'F relatives deslre
| to have funeral on Saturday, but it was decide
| to postpone it until tomorrow. The inquest wi
| be concluded to-day Naturally, there is grea


excit ment and division of public sentiment i
| the immediate neghblrhood of Huntingdon
| Even the churches are divided on the question
| and discussion of the case has led to more com


motion and bitter feeling than ID usually me


with in quiet suburban village. One side in
| niEts that the punishment OF Kelsey was deserve


and necessary, and that his turmentors shout


be permitted to GO scot free. The opposltlon,o %
| the contrary declare that the perpetrators OF tn


outrage must be punished at all hazards an


now that the body OF X slsey has been found, tn


cry OF murder is again and more vehementl
| raised"

as somewhat distorted, and he has partly
lost the power OF speech. He is at present
under severe regimen and diet, disposition

Wilson's induction into the Vice Presiden-
cy. Mr.. Carpenters term in the Senate
expires, however, in March, 1875, and he is
already casting about for available means
to secure his reelection.


The back pay business, which he under
took to defend and justify, has not helped
him. His principal competitor for the

all his power to have his colleague, Senator

The refreshing storm with which we were
visited on Sunday last, was widespread,
and in many places carried with it great
devastation. From various States we have
The storm reached as far as New Hamp'
shire and Rhode Island, where great DAM
age was sustained The fires which had
been burning in the woods, along the line
Of the Camden s. Atlantic Railroad, were
extinguished by the rain, which fell copi-
ously. In our own immediate vicinity, there
was very little damage done, and the storm
proved great blessing. The corn and 9th
er crops, which had been suffering for lack
of rain, have been greatly refreshed and in
vigorated. New life has been instilled into
all vegetation. The storm in our city, COM
menced on Sunday afternoon, and contin-
ued at intervals for several days. The tenn
perature for some days had been in the
nineties, and we greatly felt the need of
rain. The storm occasioned delay on
Monday, of the train on the Blidgeton &
Port Norris Railroad, which connects with
the West Jersey train to Philadelphia. The
train reached our city shortly after eight
o'clock. The cause of the delay was wash
ing of sand and land slide. Workmen
were employed Immediately, and the road
was soon put in good condition.


4 delegation of prominent South Carroll
mans, headed by Hon. W. D. Porter Gen.
J. B. Kershaw, and J. M. Sims, had an in
terview with Attorney General Williams at
Washington, on Thursday of last week,
and urged that further prosecution of
the Ku Klux offenders in the South be dis
continued, as that organization was broken
up, and the cessation of the prosecution
would have conciliatory effect upon all
classes in that section. They also urged
that those convicted and now serving out
ttIluo OA nCutCnCC OC PoAoOhC0 Ao @AC-
torney General in reply, said instructions
had already been issued to stop the prose-
cutions against Ku Klux offenders, except
in very aggravated cases, and some of those
convicted had already been pardoned. 1t
was the policy Of the President to pardon
them ALL keeping the most aggravated cases
however, until the last. The committee
was much pleased with the encouragement
given by the Attorney General and will
proceed to Long Branch to lay the matter
before the President.


On Thursday night Of last week, all at
tempt was made to throw = mail train on
the Ohio and Mississippi Railroad off the
track, about four miles west of North Ver-
non. A freight car, a short time before,
had set fire to the fence of one 4. P. Dough-
erty, who lived in that neighborhood Be-
ing in liquor Dougherty determined TO be
revenged, and piled the rails on the track.
Fortunately the rails were discovered in
time to stop the train. AS soon as it was
stopped, the fellow shot at the officers OF
the train, but without effect. Believing it
to be a repetition of the raid on an Ohio
railroad, 10 one would expose himself until
arms could be procured. When they were
furnished, the conductor with two others,
started in pursuit. They captured Dough-
erty, and took him to North Vernon, where
he was taken before magistrate, aud held
to bail III the sum of $500 to appear at the
preliminary examination. Intense excite
ment prevailed, and for a while, threats of
lynching were freely made.


The Iowa TRAIN RoBBERs.-The lat
est news from the pursuers of the railroad
robbers is that they had crossed the Hanni-
bal and st. Joseph Railroad; the five had
separated, and were pushing to Southwestern
Missouri where they belong, and are known
as q part of band of banditti and robbers
which is terror to all that portion of the
State. They have been positively identi-
fed as part of the same gang that robbed
the bank In st. Genevieye, Mo-, last May:
the Russelville. Ky, Bank two years ago;
and the Gallatin Bank in Iowa, and also
committed several other bold robberies.
The rendezvous is said to be Jackson coun-
ty, Mo-, and their homes are scattered around

Further particulars OF the Mailman tragedy at
Brldgewater have been received. The body OF
Mrs. Mailman was found In the forest mile from
her own house, covered with moss under the root
OF a tree The murder was evidently premeditated,
and the woods were set on fire in two places In op-
postte directions. A post-mortem examination and
Inquest were held to-day. The verdict returned was
that Mary Ann Mailman died from blows OF q

On Wednesday morning the Court met TO try
John r. Platter, the alleged wife-murderer, Of
Easton, but, after considerable delay, It was
laid over until Thursday. to give the State time
to secure some important witnesses, still absent.
Yesterday it was found the witnesses still abb
sent could not be had, and the State agreed To-
go on with the trial but the defense now asked
for q poetponement on the ground that DIR,
Anderson, Of EAston, very important witness
was unable 20 attend from severe illness. The
Court, however, seemed inclined to urge the
trial when Plater's counsel prepared, by. order

can prove by said DIR. Anderson. i4 iaii'H'

The objections were ably urged by States At.
torney Howard and s. t. Milburne, Esq.,I and
ably opposed by Ex1Goysrnor Thomas and Hon.
d. M. Henry, for the defense. The State flnslly
agreed that . deputation Of reliable gentlemen
should at once go to Easton and take the depos-i
ties of DIR. Anderson, which was opposed by
Gov. Thomas on the ground that DR.. A. may,
from his illnesB, be Incompetent 70 gtfe thH tes-
timony. Court here took recess till A NJ,
this morning.


This morning, the affidavit prepared by the
counsel for the defence Of DR., Anderson, after q

the jurors were drawn, after which Coult took
a recess until tomorrow.

Court but impanel a jury in the Duffy


and Schonhausen case. They are charged


with forging and uttering check purpor1-


ing to be signed by }. }. Daily.


In the Fourth District Court long strides


were made toward speedy conclusion of


the libel case. The paper on which the


bills Of exception o! the defendants coun-


sci will be written viii. probably amount to


enough to cover Lafayette square.


Colonel Hill was pU: 90 the stand and


testified that all articles had 30 be sub


mitted to Colonel Rhett before they were


published. Some of the directors wrote ar


,icles. He did not see this article till the


suit was commenced. The board of direc-


tors had taken no action because the suit


was commenced so sooa. In the matter of


the attacks on the lottery the ventilation


was ordered by the OLD board. The new


board elected in June. 1872. thought the
editor ought not to be restricted in his dis


cretion. and rescinded the resolution Au


gust %. 1872. The old board was not as
harmonious as the new board. Mr.. bennett


was dismissed under a resolution of Septem-
Der 9. 1872. in consequence of an altera.
ton in a telegram from Monroe.


| During Mr.. Hills examination he at.
tempted to enter into an explanation before
answering. The couV: corrected him, and
Oh his persisting informed him he would be
| punished unless he behaved himself. The
question was then answered. A juryman
asked If an article written by him was sent
| to the Picayunc i: would be published. and


was told If the editor approved of it it
would be published.


| A dispute having arisen on the meaning
| of Colonel Rhett's statement that the Libel.
GUS article was submitted to no one. he was
recalled. He explained the misunderstand-
ing by saying he read the article carefully
| before it was sent up. Judge Cooley asked
| if witness knew who wrote it. Colonel


Rhe,t said he did. but declined to say who.
On being pressed, the court protected the
| witness. and decided he was not compelled
| to answer.


| The defense then offered the report Of
| the Senate committee. with the object to
show. under the general issue. that the
committee had found the same state of
facts that the article represented. Objected
to and ruled out.


| General Longstreec was then put on the
stand. Mr.. Ogden said he desired to prove
by this witness. under tho general issue.
that the Lynch board had no returns. The
court said that matter had been excluded.
Mr.. Ogden suggested that it had been ex-
l ~ IL.
the pleadings intact and before the de-
PENDANTS had been restricted to proof under
| the general issue. He desired to offer it
again at this stage. Objected to and ruled
| out.


After consultation the defense rested.
and a recess Of half an hour was taken
| Mr.. Rice opened tor the plaintiff He
stated that his argument would not be as
interesting as some that would follow. The
ground of suit was q certain article pub
lshed in the Pieoy'n'e of February 2:'. 1873,
charging the plaintiff with committing GER
tain erin ina! acts and performing certain


duties for reward. He then read the arti.
| Gle. the answer of the defendant is con.
tined to q general denial. The word per.
| jury means a crime. as larceny or murder
does. The defense were at liberty t. prove
the truth of the charge. He then read the
Revised Statutes on the subject. He de-
fined the difference between the criminal
| prosecution as conducted b. the State. and
| the civil right of the injured party to dam
! ages. He defined libel. and the difference
between slander and libel. Abbott's Digest
| says that any words tending to degrade are
| HoelOus. II a person accuses another of a
! crime. he has accused him Of thing
| which is actionabe in itself. The
| only pleas are truth or Justification. Malice
| is inferred. Tresca vs.. Maddox. ii An. 200;
King vs.. Ballard. 10 An. 500. If the de-
fendant had not accused the plaintiff Of
perjury, then his case falls. If they had,
then he was entitled to verdict. On the
defense of Justification he quoted from
Townsend on Libel and Slander, 80. 8.
Where the charge is perjury, the plea must
allege that the plaintiff testified to what
was untrue. The same proof is required as
would be necessary to convict. Townsend.

Judge Dibble followed on the same side.
He stated to the jury that it was not the
intention or purpose Of the plaintiff to ex
ciude any matter which was pertinent to
the case. He was not afraid of the fullest
inves.ig alton. The object was to keep mat
ters out which had nothing to do with the
gu .s.on for the iury. The plant If says"

will be useless, for am convinced that we
will not come to any agreement""


Any one who is q. all familiar with
juries will herein recognize very COM
mon occurrence. It is natural for jury
men to disagree at first. and there are
usually two or three obstinate fellows on
the panel who make up their minds with
out much regard to the reason or the evil
dence Of the case. A. first they will not
listen to the arguments Of their compan-
ions. but manage to sc: called into court
to manifest their obstinacy. The judge is
held to commit a serious error who dis
charges panel apon the first request,
made in the fever OF irritation. 1t is a
very proper thing to do to send them back
for further deliberation. It is much bet
ter to do SO than 10 make a mis-trial and
put the parties TO the expense Of new
one. The sagacity Of Judge Lynch was
fully vindicated in this case. for the
same jury that told him at five
o'clock tha: they could not agree came
into court four hours later with a verdict.
Jurors like politicians are fond of an oc-
casion to define their positions. Mr..
D'Aquin, who was so certain at five o'clock
that he would never be able to convince
the eleven obstinate iurymen that his was
the correct view, possibly wanted to ex-
plain to the judge the manner in which be
had accomplished the feat in such short
time. But Judge Lynch very properly
excused him. Mr.. Haber, however, sue
ceeded in letting outa remark with a very
palpable handle to il. Said he accord

amazes the Bee. and horrifes the Pica-
ytne. What! an American judge sit by
in silence. while juror complains that he
has been forced to ngree to verdict!
Had Mr.. Haber been able triumphantly
to relate that he had forced the other ju-
ro-s 70 agree with him, there would
have been no occasion for the
interference Of the court. Bat for
the eleven 10 force the one. that
was tyranny. When ""a jury retires to the
consultation room. unless they are already
of one mind, there naturally begins con-
test. and this is soMstimes a very earnest
and serious one. We 90 not mean the
jurors fall 70 physical blows. but they Use

been put down. for,ed down, the verdict
is made. Because the question Of DAM
ages divided the juryin the Picayunc case,
and Mr.. Haber finally surrendered his
opinion Che called it forcing), the Herald
insists that Judge Lynch ought TO have
set the verdict aside. OF sent the jury back
until Mr.. Haber and az many as were Of
his original way Of thinking could force
the other fellows 70 agree to such YER
diet as he wanted. The adoption Of such
practice would make it next to impos-
sible to ever get verdict from jury. for
there are few cases il which jurymen are
not forced to greater or less extent."

rough manner. Such an event was never
before heard Of in New Orleans. On
former occasions it has only been reces-
sary to intimate through the public press
how certain set of political hacks de-
sired case to go. when a convenient jury
was instantly yoked up, and it was done.
The eminent legal ability of the counsel
was highly complimented. the learning
and impartiality Of the judge were ex-
tolled in the papers. and, finally, the
whole thing ended in a dinner, where the
""feast of reason and the flow of soul
prevailed in loud proportions. It takes
the breath out OF the old social and legal
tyrants to find their rule is over. and that
the law is superior to what they have


heretofore believed in as public opinion.
That the P:cGyne should become e1-


cited over this sudden rebuff is quite


natural, as i: happens to be the victim of
its own bad temper and folly. Besides,


what lawyers there are in the directory Of


that Journal placed too much confidence


in their persuasive powers before jury
to fear any disaster from too free indul-


gence in the license which journalists oc-


casionally mistake for the liberty Of the


press. Bu: the ponderous legal artillery


of the Herald has been placed in position


and opened fire upon the Fourth District


Court. its Judge, the jury. the counsel in


the case, auaany and everybody suspected


of having Radical turn of mind. N dis


cussing the case the Herald starts ou: with


mistaken notion of the case. and wab-
bles painfully through very heavy column


of what is evidently intended for legal


erudition. The editor. who appears


as the volunteer champion Of the


defendant, makes the same mistake in the


outset that the learned counsel did before


the court. He conceives that Judge


Hawkins was ON trial for perjury, whereas


the P;cayNns was on trial for libel. Judge


Lynch firmly refused to permit the coun-


sci to merge one case into the other, and


carefully excluded all testimony that was


not relevant to the libel suit. In arriving


at their theory Of the case it was neces-


saHy to assume that whoever chose to do


SO could sc: himself up as cour. of in


9uiry into the character Of another, pro-
nounce a judgment, which amounts 20 q


libe,. and when called to account for the


oftense, justify himself on the ground that


he believed he was right. No one knows


better than the editor of the Uerdld that


under our laws neither life. liberty. prop
erty, reputation, nor any Of the belong


ings of citizen can be taken from him


except in pursuance Of judgment
Of cour: having jurisdiction over


the subject matter. Does he claim


for the Pic1y.s. that it had legal right


to adjudge Hawkins guilty Of perjury, and


when called to account for its usurpation


Of judicial functions evade the punish
ment by subsequent arraignment Of the
gentleman who had been 50 grossly


ibeled? Does the Herald maintain that
under our laws, or those Of any civilized
country, it was proper for Judge Lynch
to review the Judgment pronounced by
the Picay."". in the matter, and if there
was reasonable grounds for the decree to
affirm it. or if it appeared to be given for
insuficien: cause, to reverse it: This
would be admitting the journal to the
rank of a court of record.


Judge Lynch had a perfect; clear view
Of the case from first to last. The com.
plant was for . Nbelous publication.
The defense WAS that the charge made
against Hawkins was true-that is, that
he was perjurer. The very offer Of proof
was in itself confession OF the part of
the defense that the plaintiffs allegations
were true. for if he had not already been
convicted Of perjury before they pub
ished the article complained of, their as
sumption fell. and their defense went
with it. There were but two defenses
for the PicGyuae. One was to deny the
fac: Of publication. and the other to
prove the truth Of the statement com.
planned OF. Neither Of these was possible. |
For the ibelous words were published |
and the plaintiff is not, and never has
been a perjurer. It was as impossible to |!"

A lawyer, challenged him to mortal combat.
The disDHtants met yesterday, near New Or
leans, and the editor killed the lawyer at the
second shot. The preliminary circumstances
are briefly these: Mr. Rhett, the editor of
The Picay,tnc, published at New Orleans, was
concerned in libel suit brought by one OF
the members of the Lynch Returning Board.
Mr.. w. II. Cooley was one of the counsel
for the plaintiff. The Picavune made certain
remarks Oh the argument of the counsel
which were specially distasteful TO Mr. COoley,
who addressed note TO the editor demanding
an explanation. To this the editor made a
curt and somewhat evasye reply in his jour
nal. Mr.. Cooley then, in a card published in
The Times of New Orleans, gave his version
of the entire dispute, and concluded by
publishing Mr.. Rhetts as AN unmiti-
gated caIumnlator, a deliberate and will
"" full falsiiier an artful dOdger, and withal,
""a thorough paced braggart."" Mr. Rhett con-
sidered, probably. that he must shoot at Mr..
Cooley and Mr. Cooley must shoot at him
after the usual formula provided by the
dueling code. SO he sent him challenge !;
and tho result was that sOmethn 2
more than a mere exchange Of shots took
place. Mr.. Cooley was struck through the
heart by bullet, at forty yards, and died in
six minutes. The surviving principal IN the
affair and the seconds exchanged what is
called ""ths usual ciyihties"" and then sep
arated.


Probably Mr. Rhctt, having been the in
suited party, AZ well az the challenger and
the slayer, now considers that he has abun-
dainty refuted the charges which Mr. Cooley
published against him. He killed a man to
establish the fact that he was not a
calumniatOr, falsifer, artful dodger. ""and
&"" withal. a thorough paced brageart."" Has he
done it In the days when men walked over
burning plowshares to prove their innocence
of crimes imputed to them. or fought in the
arena to establish the truth of their own boast
ings the termination of this bloody transaction
might have been accepted as conclusive. But it
will have no such effect in these times No
reasonable person will think any more highly
of Mr.. Rhett's honor, truthfulness, and modest
worth because he has killed man who said
he possessed none of these qualities. He
might have killed Cooley with a car-hook or
shOt him on q hotel staircase OF both persons
might have rum across the boundary line of the
United States ana fred pistols in the air, and
then have exchanged ""the usual cvilities,n
unharmed. But here was murder with all
the absurd formalities of the medi9Yal ages.
The array Of these technical details is sup
posed to denude the homicide of its murder
GUS responsibilities, and constitute it ""an
affair Of honor"" merely. Mr. Rhett is in
error. He has proved nothing whatever. He
has only fought in single combat which he
invited and has killed his fellow that 3 all. =."

Description of the Building.


One of the grandest gatherings ever witnessed
in Carbondale o CITY II miles from Scranton, took
place there to-day, the occasion being the dedica-
tion of the new Catholic church OF st. Rose OF
Lima, which has just been completed. The large
ediflce was literally packed with people, many OF
them coming from Scranton Wnkesbarre, Homes
dale Hazelton, Pittston and several other places
Hundreds were unable to gam admission.


THE PROCESSION.


The church was dedicated by the Right Reverend
Bishop wood, Of Philadelphia, assisted by Bishop
O'Eara, OF Scranton; Bishop Lynch, OF Charleston; /;
Bishop Shanahan, OF Harrisburg, the Vicar General
of Philadelphia. and about 30 priests An imposing
procession consisting OF the bishops in their epls
copal robes aud priests and acolytes In white sur
plices, was formed outside the pastoral residence,
and marched through the public square to the
church. around which it proceeded and then fled
in through the main entrance and TO the altar.


PoNTIFICAL HIGH MASS


was celebrated by Bishop O'Hara, OF Scranton.


The Right Rev. Bishop Lynch reached the dedt-
cation


SERMON.


He took his text from the 18th chapt9r OF
st. Paul to the Hebrews and laid down the
doctrine that there was perfect worship
without sacrifice. 1t commenced with Adam.
Abel and Cain offered sacrifice. Noah,
when he came out OF the ark, offered sacrifices and
his children scattered throughout the world, fol-
lowed his example. It was inherent in the heart
OF man to fulfil the sacred rite. no matter what
errors he might have Iallen into. Even in the
heathen mythology there was the acknowl-
Of rite of
invented it, it would, like all things human,
die. but God willed 1t IN the pages of time that
man should render sacrifice to the Lord Not only
in the mythology of the ancients did find it, but
the wild red men OF this Continent, the lnhab-
itants OF the Polar regions and those Of the
tropics, as well as the abOrigines OF the
Pacific islands, all, though In error, offered
sacrifice prompted by this inherent heritage OF
rendering homage The unity OF Catholics and
their zeal in building up SO many beautiful
churches looked upon by the world with
wonder; but they were bound together
by the teachings OF Christ, who offered
Himself up on Calvary for the salvation
OF mankind. and the Offering OF Christian
sacrifice should endure until the sun forgets to
shine and the moon is biotted out and the Arch
angels trumpet tells that time shall be no more.
and when the priest OF Christ offered Eucharistic
sacrifice lie was but fulfilling the mandate Of God.
III was practlSeu everywhere III tne earnest CnriS-
tian ages, in the rooms OF tae private
houses at Antioch and Damascus; and when
mausoleums were being erected in Rome 1t
was found that down IN the cat8combS affairs had
been erected on which TO offer sacrifice. When
was this sacrifice nventedY Was 1t within the
last thousand yearsY No. The Greek Orthodox
Church, which was separated from the
Roman Catholic Church 1000 years ago,
agrees with her to-day on this point. 1t
says Catholics fell into errorr, but the ques
zion OF sacrifices and the true presence they are
correct. The branches separated. 1he Copts,
the Armenians and the HISTORIANS, cut of 1850
years ago at Ephesus have but one form with
the Roman Catholic Church OF saying mass and
testiiying to the same belief in the sacrifice, the
clean oD!atlon according to the oruer OF Mclchize
dek and enduring to the end OF time.


The right reverend preacher concluded by pro-
nouncing the episcopal benedction.


THE NEW CHURCH.


The first Catholic church erected in the State Of
Pennsylvania outside Of Philadelphia built in
Carbondale, which is the oldest city in Lackawanna
Valley. The present church is handsome
Gothic edidce, imposing without ana beautiful
within. 1t will seat some thousands OF persons.
A magnificent aegOry Of the Immaculate Concep-
ton has been executed on the ceiling and the
altar piece is massive painting OF the Crucilxion

made. The defense attempted - open their
case by putting Judge Hawkins on the
stand as their witness. Counsel for plaintiff
objected on the ground that he could not be
used as a "" itness against his consent in that
s.arner. The proper way was to PROFOUND
iutsrrogatorie3 The court sustained the
objection.


Governor Warmoth was then introduced
for tie purpose Of showing that the returns
were never out of his possession, and con-
se4uently never could have been in the
hands of the Lynch returning board. This
was Tcled inadnissible on the ground that
the maui had already been passed on and
declared foreign to the case under the
pleadings. Mr.. Ogden then raised the
question and was checked by the court.


Mr.. Ogden said he desired to have his
clients c: e come before the Supreme Court
""a proper shape. and he proposed to put
these questions uu: il the adverse rulings of
the court were completely understood. How
could the Supreme Court decide on the case
unless they could have what he desired to
prove before them. The court decided that
it would overrule any motion to introduce
any testimony in regard to the returns,
being before the Lynch returning board.
Mr.. Ogden then proposed to dismiss Messrs
Longstreet. Wharton, Lynch, Rodrigue..
Heron and Bovee, who were only in at.
tendance to prove these facts. He proposed


,take a bill Of exceptions to the ruling
that would exclude this testimony. Plain
tifi's counsel said they would agree to any
bill of exceptions that Mr.. Ogden would
draw up.


Mr.. J. c. Morris was then called, and the
defense start,d to examine him on the min
utes. Mr.. Ogden called for them, but they
refused to appear. Sherifs and clerks de-
voted half an hour in searching for them,
but they didn't come. But q 7corda1t
spirit did. Mr.. Ogden said, while we were
waiting he desired, that the time might not


be wasted, to settle one disputed point.
Doubts had been raised as to the existence
Of a certain witness. 1t was said that the
witness was buried in Locust Grove Gene
terry. He wished to introduce certificates
city that no person of the name Of Pelagie
Grown had been buried in any of them.
The sudden appearance of this purturbed
spirit from the vastly deep made a sensa-
ton. But Judge Cooley seemed pretty well
prepared and was ready for the ghost He
said perhaps she wasn't buried, but she
was dead He made no ironic reference to
hardware at this time. Some Of her wasn't
buried just then anyway for he had her
skull in the courtroom. The court said he
had cOnversed with Coroner Roach, who
declared he had held an inquest on the
woman and that she had been cut up by
DR.. Nichols. After some more talk, the
grave yard documents were withdrawn
and Mr.. r. B. Rhett, Jr.. was put on the
stand. Mr.. Morris standing aside to wait
for the lost minutes.


Mr.. Rhett stated that he was the manag-
ing editor Of the Picayune. and had full
control. No director or stockholder inter-
fered with him about the columns of the
paper. Counsel read an editorial from the
Picoynnc of September ""A. 1872, defining
his position. MrOgden then asked. referring
70 the alleged hbelous article, if witness had
been influenced by any personal feeling ia
making it public. Plaintiffs counsel ob-
iected, arguing that personal spite had
nothing to do with it. Mr.. Ogden contended
he could show 6y this witness that motives
g ha puhIIs unDd governed the Oubljca-
ton. Poin: reserved for authorities to be
presented today. Mr.. Ogden said he was
compelled to 20 to the jury stripped Of his
proper defense: that he might as well lay
his clients at the feet oi the Jury and tell
them to spoliate them. Judge Cotton
seemed to sympathize. tor he immediately
gave notice that he should move to-day to
strike from the defendants answer all hut
the general denial. The court then ad-
journed TO to-day.


In the First Distric: Court Alfred Dupre.
a Jealous and efficient police officer of the
first precinct, was acquitted by jury on
the charge of falsely imprisoning one Con-
wav. The facts of the case were, that April
Mr.. Dupre attempted to arrest Alex.
Biackie, who was drunk and disorderly.
Conway interfered and tried to prevent the


arrest. The next day officer Dupre ar
rested him. An information was tiled by
the district attorney for the crime OF false
imprisonment. The case was fully tried,
and after the verdict Judge Abel said that
before discharging the accused he desired
to say that he had known some cases of
false imprisonment by police officers, but in
this case he was glad to say Mr.. Dupre was
fully justified in making the arrest, and had
acted perfectly right. He complimented
Mr. Dupre very highly, and congratulated
him on his honorable acquittal."

tor Mcmillan, accompanied by Senators jerks |
Nolan, Swords, Todd Worrill and Hunsacker |
who to-day withdrew from Kellogg Senate, took |
their seats in the fusion Senate, and issued the |
following address:


Ne,o Orleans, Jan. 10, 1s73-To our fcllow-ct- |
izens, the people of Louisiana.-We deem it our |
duty IN the present anomalous condition of af. |
fairs to place before our constituents and country


the reasons that actuate us in the course of CON
duct we have determined to pursue.
We are republicans believe in Il republican
| form of government, and We have acted with the


national republican party, but we cannot sanction


the course that has been pursued in the State by
| the customhous portion of our party and by the
| Pinehback government, and believe no right
| thinking person or class no matter of what polit-
| cal shade or conviction, can sustain them in
gross violation of the rights of the people and
their reckless and intolcrant course.


| The organization of the Senate and House we
consider as revolutionary. Senators notorously
elected have been displaced, and those whom
they defeated put in their places. Members of


the Legislature returned by both boards have been


ignored and their places filled by defeated candi


dates. Proscriptiye legislation has been rushed
huriedly through, prOclamations have been made
prohibiting peaceful assembly of citizens by the


executive, who holds office without the color of
right and law, and the popular will has been so


dehcd and outraged, that we feel we cannot longer


act with body or support an executive who for


party ends would sink every vestige of liberty in
It's final grave The question who constitutes the
legal returning board is subordinate to the ques-
ton what are the returns. Returning officers
, may count in or count out persons with or with
; out returns, but the returns will show for them
| selves.


We ascertain that Ly nch Hawkins, Longstreet
e and Heron entered into conspiracy to declare


Mr.. Kellogg and his ticket elected and that they


do so without having official returns of the cleo
ton, and admit that their action was based on
! data and memorandum and afidAvits entirely un
/ known to law and when we such violations
= Of law perpetTated by these pretended returning
| officers, and when we see that Longstreet is i'm
: medlately appointed TO an ofics with $4,000
Il salary per annum; that Heron Is given thu
v office OF recorder Of mortgages of the parish o
{ Orleans, which he demanded from McEnery a
u compensation i'll advance for counting the return
IS IN his interest, which monstrous proposition wa
y refused when we see that Hawkins is forthwith
g. appointed to the judgeship of court with
u salary OF 10000 per annum when we see that
Ill minor son of Lynch was at once appointed to tn
g. Office OF inspector of live stock, estimated to b
Iy worth at least Sl2 900 per annum it is painful
I'll manifest that the action OF the board the rt

OF the painful concomtants OF a great city. But
the present year has a deeper than usual signf-
canoe to the poor. What a day OF thanksgiv-
ing to many was to them day OF sadness, priva-
tion cold and hunger The panic bringing with it
stoppage OF work and stagnation to varied
branches OF industry, had thrown them out OF en-
ployment and left them poor, penness and almost
helpless. From many such hearts, however, there
doubtless went up heartfelt thanks to ssHim who
doeth all Things well' that it was not worse; that
they still have life and health and patient hope and
endurance. 1t IL to be feared that there was more
OF this kind OF suffering than is imagined. MANY
whom the present panic reduced to penury have
never known what 1t is to beg and their sensitive
hearts incline them to undergo great privations
before making known their necessities. The
broad mantle OF

reached, however. large numbers, and through
such charity they were enabled yesterday to unite
their thanksgiving with them-the burden OF their
thanks through gratitude TO the rich who do not
forget from their abundance to relieve the neces
stiles OF the poor.

decisions Of the Supreme Court Of louisiana to which
the case in the lower carried, affirming the
legality Of the Lynch Board and recognizing
the Kellogg Legislature are then discussed
as an authoritative settlement OF the dispute
by the highest tribunal of the State. He reviews the
proceedings in the organization Of the Legislature the
impeachment Of GOV. Wtrmoh, the session Of six sena-
tors and eleven members Of the Lower House, and the
attempted organization Of new Legislature, which he
regards as irregular and without sembanco Of author

The report deprecate resort 10 the powers vested in
the General Government, except for the grayest
sons. Local sergovernmcnt must be preserved The
States should be left TO work out their relief and
reformation long there is any hope. 1t declares
that there is government in Louisiana, in all outward
aspects legal and normal and there Is nothing otherwise
The conduct of Judge Duro s reviewed and severely
censured. But 1t is claimed that that does not affect
rights OF the Kellogg government which has been re-
turned by the Lynch Returning Board the latter having
been declared legal by the Supreme Court of the state
OF Louisiana. a title which the highest legal tribunal
has declared TO be good Is not impaired by unlawful in

Every Ofense complained OF on either side in this
against the constitution and laws OF louisiana and
the question presented broadly is whether the Con-
Of the United states shall interfere 10 correct viola
OF the laws Of the State and to redress wrongs for
which redress provided by the State tribunals In the
report OF the majority OF the Committee is alleged that
the election on Nov, was so grossly fraudulent TO

other candidates on the Republican ticket would have
been elected by large majority without cOncurTng In
the opinion that the election void entertain no
doubt that 1t organized fraud OF the largest
dimensions, and that decided majority OF the people OF
Louisiana sympatlZe with the Kellogg Government ana
earnestly desire 20 see II maintained Should Congress

that the people will take warning and with accord
INSIST upon honest elections and the faithful observance
Of the laws It my deliberate judgment that IL Is better
for bear the Ills they have and seek reformation
relief under their laws and tribunals, than 20

Mr.. Febiger said he thought the prices were |
very high, but they would never be lower, and
the land must be bought. II this thing had |
been done before the city assessment, II would |
have made a difference Of from $3O0,00O to
$500, 600 in the assessment of property in the |
Ninth Ward alone. The tax on this would
amount TO $4,000, which would pay onc-half

flow into the creek and mingle with our drink

the poisoned fish in the creek, as an evidence
that we must do anything 20 keep our watCr

MFR. Hayes thought the BrandyWine water
should be protected, but that II would be nee
essary to go beyond the mills to do this proper

to it at present. on account OF the wTbtched
financial condition of tho city. He also thougt t
it very strange that parties should ask 81, 900

and spoke IA ats favor. He said that the subject
of Public Park had been mooted for years but
had never been definitely acted upon. len years
ago, four squares Of land above Adams street. were
offered to the city for SIC 500 but now that price
was doubled and if We wait I've Jears longer, it
will be doubled again.


Mr.. Hnegan said that be was in favor of having

ground properly for Park purposes As the rep

to create such dsbt in this manner. II 1t desired

OF only $4,000. appl lIcati0n must be made to the

be made by this body, simply on their oWn re-

direct and stirring appeal in that gentleman's
interest except that OF John w. Daniel, OF Lynch
burg. young and handsome but MANNED orator,
whose very appearance, classic features
and eloquent language and gestures car
ried the Convention by storm. At mid

save the day for Wlthers. II was

ascendant, but this did not discourage the
supporters of Colonel Robert T.. Withers who
seemed determined to make fight, and by their
diminishing tactics during the organization Of the
Convention showed that, even in the minority.

Quite spicy and hot debate followed, the Withers

leadership Of Fayette McMulen. A vote was
finally reached about ten O'Clock, when 1t was
decided to go into the nominations-a victory ior
the Kemper faction, whichnow appeared stronger
tnan ever. Mr.. Charles Stringiellow then in a
very effective speech nominated General James s.
Kemper for Governor, in which he said that the
success OF radlcaism was the overthrow of the
great conservative principles which a Virginia
rebel announced hundred years ago. and
the establishment OF federal tyranny in Virginia.
He drew very faithful picture or the condition OF
North and south Carolina and Louisiana under
republican rule, saying nothing more than what is
40 well known to be the truth. Against the
colOred people the whites OF Virginia had no IN
feeling. they wished them no HARM but they did
NOT intend to surrender the liberties to which they
were born to them without struggle. His speech
was eloquent, and concluding with a grand and
glowing eulogy of the gallant soldier he nominated
was wildly and loudly cheered.

In the inquiry. Honest John Lynch

Of Kellogg's claims were thus laid

Such q course by Morton was so
wholly unexpected and SO damnable
were the disclosures OF Lynch that
at once made up my mind that the

read to the Legislature from Mr.. Whee-

that the kellogg government will not

An examination of the body was made, and it soon became evident she had been murdered, her head being beaten almost to jelly. Near by the body lay small stick, some seven feet in length, cover ed with blood and hair, showing that this was the weapon used by the mur- derer. A Coroner's jury assembled at 3 o'clock on Friday afternoon, and after viewing the body the testimony was commenced. It soon became manifest that the murder vsas committed by a negro boy named Jesse Penn, who is only about seven years of age. The boy was sent for and confessed the mur- der, giving as a motive for the deed the fact that the girl was the owner of a white marble which she would not give to him, and he killed her to get posses sion of it. The youthful murderer show ed no signs of remorse for the bloody deed he had perpetrated, and gave no indications of fear of punishment for it. The jury returned verdict in accor- dance with the facts above detailed, but in consideration of the boys extreme youth, and also of his imbecility, he was ordered to be discharged."

due or, and the passengers gave chase and

o farmer living near by. who claimed

TO his fences and he chose this method for

Of the provocaion which probably

denim !? These Western people are
American citizens, and all emigrated
feeling kindly toward Indians. What
has converted them into implaeable
foes? Let us try to put ourselves in
their place, and 80 to understand
them. Suppose sahe fifty foreigners,
from any country, had bossted that
they would come to New York and
commit any crime they listed, and that
the city dare not punish them, because
the United States government was in
treaty with theirs, and would rescue
them that it would not only prevent
their punishment but would reward
and dismiss them to repeat their Of
fenses at will. Then suppose this boast
were known to the people Of New
York, andthat the boosters had
actually come aud committed the
crimes, that they had been ar
rested, that the United States
had taken them ont of the hands of the
officers, and were taking them to safe
place, where they would be well cared
for, get their promised reward, and be
turned loose. Are there not men in
New York who would have lynched
the prisoners Suppose Red Cloud
and his band had baked half Z dozen
badies Of tho best Washington families
in cook stoves during one of their yis-
its there had tied another half dozen,
two aud two, by the wrists, and throwa
them across fence, to wait until they
died had unjointed and dismembered

roasted some men alive, and cut out the

BILE for description, with the perfect
understanding that the United States
Government would protect them from
the city government, ""teed them,
clothe them, give them Blankets"" add
Spencer rifles, ammunition and butcher
knives to the gift and then turn them
loose with photographs Of their bene-
factors in their bosoms. Would there
have been any resistance to law, OF
would the men of Washington have


waited, patiently, ia hopes that some
where, in the distant future, things
might be different What I have
supposed, for Washington, is exactly
what the General Government did for
the people Of Minnesota-all but the
photographs And the Minnesota peo-
pie did not murder the prisoners taken


from the State authorities by the
United States-prisoners whe had COM
mitted I'll and far more than all these


crimes agains: the citizens of that State,


after boasting that the United States

AS they did. What the special pro-


vocation Of the people Of Colorado and
California now is l know not, but I am
sure it is of kind with that of Mime.
sofa. do not wonder that the men
there are desperate. The wonder to
me has been that the Western States
have not long ago resolved to shoot
Indians wherever they are found, and
hang every Iadian Agent OF Commis-
siener who sets foot upon their soil.
Nothing but the overwhelming power
of the United States prevents some
such policy. Why is it that Indians
are such an exception to al laws? No
citizen Of the proudest government in
Europe dare commit murder on the
soil Of Californla and rely on his gov
ernment to override tho sovereignty Of
that State and take him out of its
hands. Why does the United States
trample on that sovereignty, and ena.
bic any and every naked savage to de-
fy it with impunity? While the Gen.
eral Government protects and rescues
criminals under Western law, We need
feel no surprise at such occurrences as
the lynching of prisoners.

there scarcely any excitement in the State itself
on the subject. No doubt the republicans will
sweep the state by an increased majority although
upon reduced vote.


The ""Busy Bees"" Of Massachuse etts-The bold
Ben Butler men.


The Boston Transcript (antiButler). September
8, AYERS that the Washburn delegates lead the
Butler 81 votes, and have majority OF ""a over
Butler and the doubtful. The last count showed -
For washburn, 317 for Butler. 26S. The actual
assembling or the Convention on the 10th may
show different figuring.


The Lynchburg Republican says its radical friends
seem to be little bothered in raising money with
which to prosecute the campaign in Virginia.


The Boston Traveller (Buter), September g.
anrms that 'if the gains for General Butler at the
caucuses yet to be heard from In proportion to
his gains up to the present time, he will have at least
fifty majority in the State Convention. The dele.
gates classed as doubtful in the organs OF the
third term candidates are Butler men,"" There
is a shocking degree Of discrepancy between the
Butler and ant-Butler press regarding the CON-
plexion OF the approaching Convention.


The Cincinnati Gazette states that Governor Moves
is making q splendid campaign in Ohio-and it
might have added, not making much noise about
1t, either.


""Where Is Vice President Wilson ?"" Is O conun-
drum now being propounded in Massachusetts,.
he is not usually silent in similar emergencies


rhe Chicago Inter- ocean AYERS that the Tribune
of that city exhibits remarkable ignorance Of
the facts when 1t claims that the so-caed ""reform
party"" has assumed a tangible and vigorous shape
IN Minnesota Wisconsin and other States. The
fact Ia that In these states the party Is especially
weak and powerless to accomplish any tangible
results In the way OF success in the coming election
OF State oficers.


Wednesday next september 10y, will be the day,
the lawful day. OF the rise or downfall OF the
Butlerian power In Massachusetts. The earth
quakes as 1t contempates The result, and yet the
Salem Qnakers, 1t is said, Egoing for ""bold Ben.""

Last June we gave some particulars OF the
manner in which Hanmore, the correspondent OF
the New York HerdLl who wrote from Dover on
the occasion of Vests trial, had obtained money
on various bogus drafts and checks. 1t now ap-
pears that he has been following the same tao
tica, in Virginia A news paragraph, in all the
papers, day or two ago, read as follows
90 ""A Stanton, claiming to be a correspondent
Of the New York Herald, has swlndled Miller

msnt Of j. W. Cameron, OF Rockbrldge Baths

under pretense of being Herald correspondent,
but was suspected Of being fraud, He has not
been caught""


Now this fellow who has struck the Virginia
bankers for 81 ,220, in these rough times, IL
doubtless the same Hanmore, who perpetrated
his rascaities in this State. In July, MIR. w. u
Fountain, of the State Capital Hotel, at Dover,
(who had advanced Hanmore money on draft
which was returned protested received the fol-
lowing letter:

TO THEIR REMOVAL HERE.",,"THE Action OF THR CRY CoUNcfI, IN REGARD


TO THEIR REMOVAL HERE.


At the meeting Ofthe City Council last evening
the special Committee appointed to consider
what action the city might take towards efiecting
the removal OF the county seat to Wilmington,
reported in favor Of offering an eligible site for
the erection OF city and county buildings, and al
SO to pay one half the cost of erecting the same,
in the event of the Legislature authorizing the
removal.


Mr.. Febiger thought that the report was not
specific enough In the first place it had not
mentioned what site the city would offer. II also
agrees to pay one-half the cost of erection, and
gives no estimate of the probable cost of these
buildings, thereby binding the city to pay an in
definite sum. He favored the removal strongly,
out dld not think that We, who pay two-thirds OF
the county taxation, should pay One-half the cost
OF these buildings, and twOthirds of the remain
der. II :


Mr.. Lchtenstein thought that the Committee
had gone as far as they had any right to 90. and
that Council should decide upon the location
ne had estimated the cost of the buildings at
$4,000, and wished to make the proposition OF
the city sufficiently liberal to disarm all opposi-
ton from the lower hundreds.


MI tebiger stated that one of the proposed
stes-the City Hall lot-was worth $4,000; and
the other-at Eleventh and Market-Was worth
$4,000; which would have TO be added to the
clty share There was another matter which
had been forgotten. If the Courts are removed
here jail will have to be erected Therefore
100000 will not be sufficient for the buildings.
which will have to be flre-proof He thought the
CITY should offer the sites and pay portion OF
the expense PToportionate with the space Occu-
pied by the city offices.


MI. Pickels referred to the great necessity for
the removal, and thought that 100000 would be
amply sufficient to erect all the necessary build
i4gs In plain, substantial manner. without aDy
elaborate oFnamentation. new Court House Is
badly needed, and new City Hall will soon have
70 De built. Now, II the Levy Court decide to
erect new Court House at New Castle the city
OF wilmington viii have to pay two thirds of the
expense, and will have 10 bear all the expense
Of erecting new City Hall, now add these tWo
eosts together, and they will not far exceed the
cost OF this removal, while great advantages
would De secured to the people Uf this CITY lie
hoped the report would be adopted.


MI Richardson was not In favor Of the CITY
paying such large proportion Of the expense.


Mr.. Quinn thought that IL the city expended
$4,000 In he erection of the buildings, tie coh1
munity would still be repaid in the great conye-
nlence secured by the removal,


Mr.. Candy was surprised that the report should
meet with any opposition, and considered AZ tFue
economy to adopt the report as II was read.

have cost the city, at least $780,

ul.r ballot. has at last met its legitimate
sulmina,iou bloodshed, For several
dsys there has been reign Of terror 10
Gran, parish, aud the parish seat, the


village of Colfas, has been occupied bys
force of some three OF four hundred ne
o,oes. The cause Of this difficulty IL,
cousisely stated, thus: What was known
az the Lynch returning board"" ignored
the election returns from Grant parish,
and left it to Kellogg to appoint off
cers to gil the vacancies, ss the usurp.
ing government ~as pleased to call the
results Of its policy as applied to this
} parish. Kellogg made the appointments,


but the appointses neglected to quslify
within the time allotted by Law. Kellogg
then, at the instance of Judge Rutland,
co N m,ssioned the officers vho had been
duly elected, some Of whom sere Fusion.
ists and some Radicals, and including one
or two colore1 men. This action not
meeting the sanction Of one Ward, who
was a member Of the Kellogg legislature,
he asse mbled force Of negro's of6cered
by a few white men OF his own complex
ion, and took forcible possession of the
court house at Colfax, together with the
newly commissioned parish officers. This
was about ten or twelve days ago. TIE
law abiding shito people of the parish,
both Fuslouists and Republicans, made
some effort to induce Ward and his mob
to withdraw, but without avail. Instead
Of disseminating their lawless proceedings
they went on to use their powers v;o.
leu,y until finally intoxicated by an
im munity of lawlessness, they began 10
hun, down those who were obnoxious to
them sack their residences and pillage
their plantations. Several mcn were
obliged TO fec the parish, escaping mostly
down the river to New Orleans.


This reign Of terror, unchecked either
BY the state or national authorities, at
last reused the white people Of the parish
to the necessity of self prote Ac.
cordngly they assembled to the number
Of several hundred under the leadership o
of Capt Hadnot, the Fusion representa-
tive elected for Grant parish. A last
effort was made to induce Ward and his
mob TO evacuate the court house peacea.
bly, and disperse, but it was idle. Then,
on Sunday last, all other methods having
failed, the whites under Capt. Hadnot
determined to dslodge the mob from the
court house at the point Of the bayoDet
A desperate fight ensued, in which the
whites we're victorious, dislodsing the
negroes from their iuprovised strong.
hold, and hunting them out Of the town.
According to our New Orleans kilograms
of this morning, the fight seems to have
been turned into massacre by the whites,
who, infurated by long suffering and ren.
dered desperate by the nature Of the
emergency, killed, as is variously esti-
mated, from eighty to over one hundred
of the negroes. Their loss was compare.
lively trifing, q wonderful circumstau nee
when it is considered that they we're the
assaultlng party, and that the enemy
were strongly lptrenched and thoroughly
desperate.


Of course this sickening affair carries
its own comment with it.

Grant Parish: The Alexandria Democrat gives
the following history of the origin of the diff
Guilty and its result: -


The Lynch returning board ignored the cleo
tion of the parish officers, and Mr.. Kellogg ap-
pointed set of men to fill the vacancies bnt
who did not qualify according to law, and al
lowed the time to elapse in which they are
required by law to do it in. Mr.. kellogg conf
missioned all officers who were elected, includ-
ing both Republicans and Fuscnists, white
and colored except parish judge, who had
already qualified and was Republican.


Ward. member of the DryaFies street Leo-
islature, learning that Mr. Kellogg was going
to issue these commissions, hastened to Col
fax and took violent and forcible possession of
the courthouse and offices with mob. There
was proposition to hold mass meeting of
the people for the purpose of expressing their
contemplation in quiet way at the course
rived for the meeting to have been called to-
gether, there were such violent demonstrations
made by Ward, Register and Flowers, and the
armed arm baud that was backing them, that the
did not pretend to do anything,k but quietly
returned to their homes without going near
the courthouse, or assembling anywhere.
And at once, and without law or shadow of
authority, they (the negroes) inatalle ed and
proclaimed themselves full masters and pos
SCISSORS of everything in CoIfax. All being
armed and prepared for the occasion, pro,
necessaey var rpIeSRutions were at once ini-
provised By these zoters and opponents of law
and order. They sentout miles in the country
foraglng and scouting parties, and made good
use of their temporary and usurped powers
Nothing was left undone to deprive peaceable
people Of all their horses, mules and proSi-
slons, and thus matters went on till last Snn-
day, when fearful retribution bronght them to
grief. What then occurred we have gathered
from many sources and many rumors, all of
which we have 6ifted and set down nanght
but what reliance can be placed in. The whole
affair, as we stated last week, ia the teach

have been arrogant, dictatorial aud willingly
disposed to hunt down the white man Ut all risks
and nnder all circumstances Politics is only

and we know and feel that none but the hi e,
people of poor crushed 'Louisana conld have
been so long endurant, and we may say meet,
under the many aud continued tauhtss INSULTS
and prosecutions they have been forced to
bear from an inferior and deluded race. But
SO II is and 80 it will be forever and all time
that the best .inCentiOns and conduct will

results2


The whites of the surrounding country. on
whom these wrongs had been heaped With
venReauce time and time again, were ut last
aroused, and gNehered and banded together ""a
self-defence and in the protection of then.

country, at last struck the long delayed blow.
The fght was short, quick and decisive, and

and the wrong-dOers and barbRrous rioters
and outlaws were made to par the penalty
with the forfeit of their lives. Ia,Ahe bloody

bad enough EBcorded We write it for the
gnilty and bad men who have the terrible sin
on their souls to answer for. The whites of
Grant were driven in pure selEdefence to act
the part they did, and in the eyes Of God and

fall on the guilty alone.

say wild-beastly business. Apart from the
shame and crime of its gross ilegality those
who engage in the administration of this wild
Justice, rs it has been grossly misnOmered,
seem usually to have parted with all the in
stincts of pity and humanity; to have forgot
ten the fairness which even barbaIians love;
and to have surrendered themselves to brutal
rage and sort of ferOciOus insanity. Some
thing of this inevitably taints even those
extra-judicial executions which we might 9TH
erwise look upon with a touch of equanimty.
We forget the crime Of the wretch who
has been set upon by horde of exasperated
men, who from the beginning has not that
chance of his life which regular trial would
give him, and whose dying moments are dis
turbed by the yels and curses of his self-con-
stituted judges. jurors, and executoners. A
sCkening story of o man thus murdered,
reacbesus from Salem, Ind. One DelOs Hef-
feren had been committed to Jail at that place,
charged with murder. Whether he was guilty
or not guilty we do not know, and the fact
now can never be judcially determined. IEe
was in custody and there was no danger of his
escaping. But the outraged virtue of that re-
giOn could not wait for the slow process of
the law.


On Sunday morning, June 90, body of
masked men enters the town of Salem. They
demand the keys of the Jail. These being re-
fused, the Sheriff is seized and confined; the
mob batter down all distractions and the cell
of the helpless victim is reached. Hefferen,
who had been watching the progress of the
besiegers, prepares himself as well as he can
for resistance, as he has a right, felOn though
he may be, to do. Even with such odds upon
their side, the rioters are towards, and do not
dare to approach this desperate man. They
therefore procure balls Of twine, saturate them
with coal oil and benzine, and send them
blazing into the cell. Having thus lighted up
the apartment, they begin to fire at Hefferen.
One bullet enters his breast-another breaks
his arm. A rock is cast at him which knocks
him down, and before he can recover himself
he is seized and taken to q railroad bridge
He earnestly asks moment for prayer but it
is denied him. A rope is put about his neck,
and then thrown over the rafter of the bridge.
He is pushed off. He is dead. Justice in
Salem (sweet name y has asserted herself.


Cases like this are interesting. They show
the bad side of human nature in lively cOlOrs,
and prove how possible it is for men to eman-
cipate themselves from the restraints of civil
ization, and within hearing of the church
going bell to do deeds worthy of the jungle
and its tigers. We know nothing Of the vic
tim save that he was man. Bad as he may
have been, he has our sympathy, and will have
that of thousands. SO much these mistaken
lynchers of Salem have done for him. Mean
while they are all as much murderers as no
was, and if detected may be tried and hanged
also. Tho pity of it is that they will not be
detected, will not be tried and will not be
hanged."

Danger Of Being Lynched.
IFrom the San Francisco Alta California, Sept. 2S]


The ship Sunrise, from New York, arrived in port
about one O'Clock yesterday afternoon. We take
the following rom her memoranda


On May L. lat. 81 so north. Ion. 65 Sc west
Charles Brown, a seaman, was found missing; ma

and was drowned he was q native or Ireland,
aged sixteen years.


She had scarcely cast anchor until she was
boarded by sailor b0Rrsaing house runners, who
ascertained during brief stay that three men had
been forced to commit suicide by jumping over
board as the only means OF escape from the cruel
treatment to which, it is alleged, they were con-
stantly subjected By the officers OF the Ship This
story was strengthened by the fact that the second
0fncer, Dennis MaJoney haa escaped from the ship
NJ the eightrmiie buoy, took Whitehall boat, and
landed at Meiggs' wharf Mr.. Franklin, known
better as 'Frenchyn because he is q French
man, keeps a sailor boarding house on Vallejo
street. ana be boarded the vessel He met a
countryman on board, Charles Belle, who asked
Franklin to take him ashore. Belle wore a thor
oughly denoraized appearance. Bis face was
black and swollen, dark semicircles were visible
under his eyes, and these latter were red and sore
looking. His clothes were filthy, ana his whole
look told that he had been cruelty treated and en-
listed for him the sympathy OF Franklin. This gen.
tleman took him in his boat and rowed him ashore.
The captain and first of1cer called on Franklin TO
turn with the Frenchman, request which was
positively and emphatically declined he brought
the poor fellow to his house, changed his dress and
attended to his many wants He was the only sea-
nhn an "" VINO let she snip YESTERDAY they were not
stream opposite North Point Dock.


After the seaman had reached shore, and the
cruelty OF the officers was bruited along the city
front, general and very decided feeling OF indig-
nation was expressed even among runners, and 1t
would not have been safe for Maloney to put in an
appearance about that time. He would be forced
to stand some severe retaliatory measures or 60
overheard.


AN INTERVIEW WITH THE SAILOR.


Areporter or the ALd obtained an interview with
Belle, the French seaman, late last evening, at Mr.
FTanklln's boarding house. He Is young man.
probably not more than twenty-one years of age,
and his face and body bear undoubted evidence OF
the brutal treatment to which he was subjected
his statement Is substantially as f0nows;-The
sunrise left New York on the Sd OF May Captain
Clarke commanding. The first officers name Is
Harris; the second officer, Dennis Maloney and
the boatswain's name is Kelly,


Inc nrst day after leaving New York the first
mate commenced to exercise a tyranny as cruel
and unrelentlng as II was barbarous and savage; |;
and continued this conduct until san Francisco
was reached. The second mate, Maloney, did not





often lnterfered 10 prevent the first mate from
carrying his brutal punishment TO extremes. The
b0atSwain Kelly, FUSED to lickn the sailors often:
and the captain Joined in this brutal conduct
which he tolerated, appeared to tolerate in the
man Harris. The first officer made the men work
until they dropped down through exhaustion.
He would bring them out OF bed at nights and COM
pei them to walk on deck, and If they did not keep
moving, or perchance fell asleep as they stood or
walked he would tap them on the head with his
clenched fist Delaying pin. piece of rope or any
Jnlng Mandy. Wnen he wished to awake them on
traa
and the poor sailors sides are an evidence OF the
TACT. This used TO be regular thing and all were
sionaly and knew well OF the first officers conduct
who abused the men in his presence, but not with


~ THREE MEN WENT OVERHEARD.


Two preferred death to the treatment they re-
celved, and the third, weak and exhausted, alter
long and severe punishment, fell from the rigging
and was seen no more. The first victim was John
brown, Frenchman. His countryman says he
knows net how he was lost He was to have been
on watch between eight and twelve O'Clock P. NJ;
he was called everywhere, but he answered not.
The first mate ..lickedi him every day two or
three times; made him work twenty out OF twenty
four hours; would throw him violently on the deck
and Kick him. II was after all tns terrible punish
compelled to stand motioness on deck for twenty
four hours without food or water, that he aban-
doned the Sunrise and his life and sought relef In
the unfathomable depths OF the ocean.


FIFTEEN NIGHTS SLEEPING WITH HOGS.


John Cardiff is also reported missing. Cardiff
was treated with the same cruelty as Brown, and
even worse. he was not allowed to sleep in the
forecastle, but was put under the topgalant fore
castle, where he was compelled to sleep lor fifteen
nights previous TO the night he is reported missing
with hogs for his companions. What a terrible
crime How 1t cries to heaven for redress The
man was half demented from sufiering-from cruel
treatment-from whipping kicking, walking
working little food and less sleep. when, to es.
cape from life made miserable beyond endurance.
ne employed the little strength he had left TO end
his existence.


DEATH FROM EXHAUSTION


The third victim, w. f. K. Carrlgan was a young
man, twenty years OF age, or perhaps less He was
the especial object OF the hate and brutality OF the
first mate Harris. He was after the usual daily
kicking and bruisng with rope and club, forced to
stand on deck twenty-four hours without eating or
sleeping, after which ne was sent on the topsail
yard from which he fell, through weakness and ex-
haustlon, and was lost. Belle did not see Carrigan
1a, nor did he see any OF the missing disappear
OF them


The sasr repeated many lesser acts OF brutal
ity, enormous in themselves, but, beside the more
despotlc cruelty OF forcing these men into the
arms OF death, small and insignificant. He often
told them that they would never reach San Fran
cisco, anc that he would compel them TO Jump
overheard. When the men were weak and
iatgued from the combined effects of punishment,
want of rest and labor he would order them aloft
and then try to throw them from their places by
letting the halyards go and other devices.

Kept thirty-six hours without iood, and never got
more than lour out eof twenty-lour hours sleep.
They were, to use his own expression .a licked

doubted evidence OF cruel punishment.


Inc iact tnat the second mate, Maloney. aban-
doned the snip before coming to anchor led to the
strong suspicion that he was the party guilty of
this terrible cruelty. But it appears from Rejiesa
statement that he was kind and by his interference
saved them from the tyrannical Tascay cruelty Of
the man, or monster, Harris. The Captain and
Harris .growled"" at him because he was nor crnei
and did not make the men work more. He never
injured any one during the voyage, and Belle is AZ
o loss TO know why he lett the ship so suddenly
unless he wanted to escape from the Others ~

idea suggests the appropriateness of particularly

COMPLAINT OF PORTLAND sHIPowNERs.",,"Congressman Lynch will soon present the
memorial of citizens of Portland, agents and
owners of vessels engaged in trade with Gu
ba, soliciting the interference of Congress to
protect them from the burdens imposed by
the authorities of that Island.


Among the burdens enumerated are the
following: ''That the Spanish laws require
vessel bound for Cuban ports to present
manifests certified by the Spanish Consul at
the port of loading, in which the master of
the vessel must declare positively the con-
tents OF packages, their marks and weights,
and for any discrepancy on delivery in Cuba
the vessel is held to answer; that they are en-
tirely dependent upon the shipper ofthe goods
for description of contents of packages and
weights Of the same, and that the goods, and
not the vessel, if either, should be held; that
the customs authorities at the several ports
in Cuba differ in their construction Of the
laws relative to vessels and manifests, and
fines are imposed in one port for stating that
for which fines are imposed at other ports for
omitting; that the captain is only informed
of any fine imposed on his vessel when he
attempts to clear at the Custom House, where
| by he has either to pay the fines or have his
vessel detained indefinitely while contesting
the same; that while they are willing to COM
ply with the laws, so far as is practicable to do
30 the conflicting constructions placed upon
them render it impossible to avoid the impo-
sition OF fines and the detention of their yes
sells; that although an appeal to the superior
authority at Havana is permitted on pay
ment under protest, yet unless the fine is ex-
cessive the loss occasiOned by the detention of
the vessel would exceed in most cases the
amount of the fine, even if recovered""
Mr.. Lynch will accompany the memorial
with preamble and resolution, reciting that
the customs regulations of Cuba, as executed
by the customs authorities, are annoying and
onerous to merchants and shipowners Of the
United States engaged in trade and COM
merce with that island, subjecting them to
unjust fines and to expensive delays, and re-
questing the President to call the attention of
the Spanish government to the subject in Or
der that such action may be taken as will
speedily provide remedy for the evils COM
planned of.


WINDING UP OF INSURANCE COMPANIES.


The following is the bill passed by the Sen
ate Monday prescribing the manner of wind
ing up insurance and other State corpora
tions:


Be it enacted etc. That whenever a corpora
ton created by the laws of any State whose
business is carried on wholly within the State
creating the same and also any insurance COM
pany so creaIed, whether all its business shall
be carried on within such State or not, has had
proceedings duly commenced against the cor
poration or company before the courts of such
State for the purpose of winding up the affairs
OF such corporation company and dividing
its assets rateably among those entitled thereto,
prior to proceedings having been commenced
against such corporation or company under the
bankrupt laws of the United States, any order
made by such court agreeably to the State law
and exesuted accordingly for the rateable distri-
button or payment of any dividend of assets to
the creditors of such corporation or company
while each State court shall remain in posses
sion or control of the assets of such corporation
or company shall be deemed valid notwith-
standing proceedings in bankruptcy may have
been commenced and be pending. against such
corporation or company.


SENATOR CALDwELL's CASE.


Senator Caldwell will make full statement
of his case tomorrow, in closing the defence
The expectation is general here that the re-
port of the committee will declare that his
seat should be vacant. 1t is said that the
committee will hold, even if they decide that
the evidence does not show Mr.. Caldwell in
person was party in bribing members of the
legislature, that the seat should be declared
vacant because the evidence does show be-
yond question that bribing in the interest of
Mr.. CaldwelPs election did occur, and this in
itself, without the personal knowledge of Mr.,
Caldwell, should invalidate the election.


THE LOUISIANA INVESTIGATION.


United States Inspector Jaques completely
turned the tables ON the Kellogg faction in
the Louisiana investigation to day, by swear
ing to wholesale dealing in fraudulent afida
Wits and fraudulent lists in the interest of the
Kellogg side. Mr.. Sypher of the House of
Representatives, who was present, undertook
to break the witness down, when, to the
amazement of Sypher, he unfolded to the
committee under oath Sypher's purchase of
ballot-boxes with device attached which
would allow of unlimited stuffing, which Sy.
pher used to render his election to Congress
sure and which was stuffed in Sypher's pres
ence. l-

bursed. The State Department has no au-
thority to make any allowances on this ac-
count, and has so informed the consuls. In
reply to this, a consul at an important point
writes that he is unwilling to consume his
own salary, and asks whether the bodies of
those impecunious Americans who are so un-
fortunate as to make their exit from this
world in his locality are to be thrown into the
streets or into the river. The saddest cases
of all would seem to be those of sick and dy-
ing tAmerican seamen who are discharged
from foreign vessels without money and with
out friends, and for whom there is no means
of relief, although many of them have been
paying hospital money for lifetime.

To-day large assembly were present to hear
Governor Gilbert G. Walker deliver the ADDRESS
before the literary societies on the subject OF
practical education. The ad So was enthu-
sasrically received. Touching the political issues
Of the day. among other things he said:--


cannot speak IN TOO laudatory terms OF the
wisdom and foresight which enabled the College, by
an advantageous sale and q more advan tageous
investment to nearly double the principal
Of the fund derived from the Congressional appro-
priaton and TO increase the income therelrom in
corresponding degree. This annual income Will

sion Of the fund between these two institutions, its
benefits will be shared In by all the people OF the
State, and the principle OF separate schools Tor
each race, which l regard O vital importance to
each and absolutely essential to success In either
will be maintained and perpetuated. The war
resulted in the emancipation OF the negroes; but
no sooner had the sword been sheathed than the
strife was transferred to the forum, and days and
months even years, were spent In Efforts to clothe
the freedman with rights he could not understand
and load him w1th responsibilities which he was
unable to comprehend Statute on statute

and political rights Of the negro. But where

tiOn even to partial comprehension OF the duties
and responsibilities which these rights imposeY
Why did not the mental and moral necessities OF
these wards OF the nation excite the same paterna
solictude did their political cOnditiOnf shall
not pause, is 1t germane to my present purpose,
to answer this very natural inquiry. The facts with
winch we have alone to deal at the present mo-
ment are that although the negro was emanci
pated from physical slavery, he was left bound in
the more terrible chains OF universal Ignorance,
and that while the nation invested him with the
ship it not only failed to make any provision
for investing him with 11,9lg kn1,o9wledge Of
that citizenship imposes, but left him in the depths
OF poverty and ignorance to be educated, II edu-
CARED at all, by the white people OF those States
they were unable to educate even themselves.
That this was unwise, unjust and i'm
Ssmonstrate. demon s'' In my opinion, the % governmen5 m
should not only have provided the means for the
education Of these ne new SURFACES but It should

Its mental, moral or physical condition,
without injury more or less TO the whole;
srable in the individual citizen Of a republic then
the education OF the whole people becomes mat
ter Of public interest and national concern.


i am no advocate OF governmental system OF
education, except by the States; but do advocate
the extension to ali the States Of the policy which
has uniformly obtained in the organization Of new
States. The public lands are the common property
Of o. the white white people Of the Union, held BY
and II there be reason and SOUND statesmanship
IN reserving q portion OF this property educa-
nonal purposes IN the sparseiy populated but pros,
statesmanship in far higher degree dictate the
appropriation OF portion OF this property to the
lstion Of the older States OF the South:
But l DO not 60 to the length Of
the subject, based though it may be upon the
soundest and most substantial and patrio tic
with all Of the other States of the Republic in this
as in all other respects. merely advert to the per
f0rmance OF what believe to be solemn and imper
alive duty by the federal government to the back
race and 10 the people OF the whole country, ant
that duty consists in approprlating the entire pro
ceeds derived from the sales OF pubic lands to edu
catisnal purposes, and while would devote por
uOn OF these proceeds TO the further endowment o
colleges OF this character and the balance 10 the
support and maintenance OF free primary schools
i would see to 1t that the whole was
placed where 1t would do the nost good. The
manner in which this duty should be executed
whether this property shall be divided among tht
several States, equally or according to population
or illiteracy, or upon what should esteem the
wiser, more comprehensive and equitable basi.
OF present needs and prospective demands, ant
how much shall bd apportioned to primary ant
how much to technical schools may safely be re
ferred to that Congress which Shall possess the

This, at least was the first account. A
later one represents that the beleaguered
party of negroes composed posse assisting
the new Kellogg Sheriff against the old Fusion
or Democratic claimant In either case,
is it not natural that an ignorant and de-
graded people, like the negroes OF many OF
the remote parishes of Louisiana, should infer
from the recent transactions at New-Orleans
and Washington, that the purpose Oh the
Federal Government was to deliver the state
into their hands They cannot have forgotten
that during the,campaign the Administration
leaders were careful to array them against the
white population, to frighten them with tho
prospect of revival of slavery IL the old
slaye-Owners ever got into office, to assure
them that tho cause Of Grant and the cause
Of the black man were identical, and that the
reelection of the President would elevate the
colored race TO place and power, and put
their old masters forever under their feet
They know that in the November election the
black mans party, created by these represen-
tatiOns, was defeated at the polls. They know
that it was nevertheless Immediately Installed
in power by military force. They know that
it is sustained by the President in defiance OF
law and of the remonstrances of some OF his
own warmest friends. What is more natural
than for them to assume that they might do
on small scale what their leader Kellogg
had done on large onef Their man Ward
imagined that he had learned a great deal dur
ing his sojourn in New-0rleans, and when no
hurried home to stir up the insurrection he
found apt and eager pupils.


Is the warfare to go any further Loulsi-
ana is already prepared for bitter antag-
onism of races which one or two more crimes
like this at Colfax may render ineradicable.
The whites are not so utterly crushed aud
broken that they will bear negro usurpation,
however they may submit to legal authority
The blacks will not endure massacre and
outrage in a State where they hold political
preponderance. Let the flames of hostility
once be lighted between the two classes, and
no one can foretcll the misfortunes that must
follow. To avoid the catastrophe threatened
by the crimes and folies of the New-Oreans
administration, both parties will need to ex-
ercise the greatest forbearance and the civil
authorities must pursue the authors OF these
Red River disorders, and punish them with
the utmost severity, whether whites or blacks,
Republicans or Democrats."

sided.

the matchmaking of Fourth street by the city

estimate it would result in a saving to the city
OF Sl2, $780, ,16.


The appointments by the Mayor were read and
referred to the Police Committee. complete
list of them may be found elsewhere.
The Committee on Education, which had been
instructed to prepare memorial to the Legls-
lature asking the provision Of somo plan for
the education of the colored children, presented
the said memorial. 1t recites the grievances OF
the colored people and the injustice and made
quAcy of the present school system. and asks
that the coored people may be taxed for school
| purposes a. white people are taxed, and that
schools be provided for the education OF colored
children under the supervision OF the Board OF
Education


Mr.. Hayes was in favor of educating the col
ored children, but demanded separate schools
/ for them.


Mr.. Pickels suggested that the Legislature
would provide its own plan Of education. He
said that the colored people had been taxed, in
/ directly, TO pay for the education OF white chill
/ dren, but not their own. This had been done
/ in the levies to pay the interest on the school
loans, but no direct tax had boon laid on them
/ for school purposes. He deemed II but just that
| they should be taxed.


| Mr.. Hayes thought the memorial was not ex-
plicit enough in its prayer for separate schools.
i lie said it was useless to try to pull the wool
| over the eyes OF the Legislature.
Mr. Quinn was unwilling to vote money to pay
| for the education OF those who are unwilling to
help themselves. II was no use to petition the
Legislature, for the Legislature won't pass the
bill. He could never vote to amalgamate the
| white and black children in the schools, having
/ nothing but white blood in his veins
/ Mr. Febiger humorously explained that there
/ was no such thing as white blood that all blood
was red and that IL 1t be extracted from the veins
/ Of the gentleman from the Second Ward and a
colored man both would be red Here Mr.. Quinn
/ interrupted Mr.. Febiger with the remark that
IL the gentleman Mr.. F. ~ said he hadn't white
| blood in his veins, he was liar""
| The Chair interposed its authority, and Mr..
i Lynch taking the floor, said he was not opposed
TO the education Of the cOlored children, but the
| plan proposed would entail too much work on
| the Board OF Education. He thought the schools
| should be under the control OF Board of Com
| missioners created specially for the purpose


Mr.. Baker deemed it right and proper that the
colored children shouldbe educated and inforced
the idea that public sentiment demanded It by
showing the great pains which is taken to edu-
| cate even the dumb animals. He thought the
Legislature would grant the prayer OF Council

Prior to the adoption OF the memorial tho


word separate was added to it 30 that separate


schools are asked for although the idea was ex-


plcitly stated before.

Mr. Febiger then moved that the Committee


on Law be instructed to draw up bill for sub


initial IN the Legislature, authorizing the issue


Of certificates OF indebtedness to defray the ex-
penses Of the work, which was adopted.


The annual report OF the Chief Engineer OF

accepted and 800 copies ordered to be printed.


Dr. John Cameron elected Vaccine Ply

MIR. Plckes then called up his ordinance ma


king the appropriations for the clrrent year.


The Democratic members oojecled TO eacl

Mr.. Plckels asserted that the opposition wac


raised for political effect, and with view Il

insisted that rigid economy had been sought


and that the appropriations had been increased

PRESIDENTS PROCLAMATION",,"| Senator Carpenter has long been conspicuous


""a one of the stanchest and ablest OF the
President,s friends; he has done many things


of late which show him to be likewise one of
the most honest. On questions of public policy


we have often found ourselves at variance with
him but none can be reader than we are to
recognize that frank independence with which


he sometimes raises himself above the petty


considerations of partisanship. In his address


the other evening to the people of New


Orleans we find so much to approve that we
are not disposed to find fault with its mistakes
and shortcomings. He took pracucai view
of the situation, not Disgusting its difficulties
not Understanding the wrongs to which the
people of Louisiana are required to submit,
but telling his hearers what they ought to do
to restore the prosperity of the unhappy
State. The whites must learn to ac-
ouiesce cheerfully in the changed So
cial conditions Of the South; the blacks
must learn self-reliance and manliness and
both parties must ""let politics alone and at
tend to their business 1t is a sad commen-
tary upon the decentralization of public affairs
that Senator of the United States should find it
necessary to advise people to ""let politics
alone - but Mr.. Carpenter is right That
Durell's contact was outrageous"" says the
Senator, al have not q doubt. But Gen.
Grant must support him under the law un-
{"" til Congress settles the matter. You must
keep the peace until this outrageous conduct
of Durell's is set aside 1t is not Kellogg that
governs the State; it is not Grant, but the
claw; and to it you must submit"" Of course
Mr.. Carpenter speaks without due reflection
when he says that Gen Grant must support the
usurpation ""under the law 1t is not the
law which rules in Louisiana; it is the Presi-
dent and his troops They mean to rule as
long as Congress will let them, and opposition
will only provoke useless shedding of blood.
The best thing therefore, the people of Lou
isiana can do is to ""let politics alone"" and
turn their attention to their trades and COM
mercial enterprises. There is no place for pol
iticians under a despotism.


1t is q pity the President does not under
stand the situation as well as his friend the
Senator. In his proclamation commanding the
opponents of Gov. Kellogg to disperse he
declares that ""it has been duly certified by
"" the proper local authorities, and judicially
determined by the inferior and superior
courts of Louisiana, that Kellogg and his
associates are entitled to hold their offices
respectively and execute and discharge the
functions thereof"" and he assumes therefore
that it is his duty to support them. These
statements are entirely erroneous and the
most forcibe refutatioD Of them we have ever
seen is contained in Senator Carpenters re-
port from the Louisiana Investigating Com
mittee. 1t is there shown that the election
of the Kellogg government never was ""certi-
"" fed by the proper local authorities"" and
never was ""judicially determined"" by the
Louisiana courts. 1t was certified by
Board which had no legal authorization, and no
returns before it. ""There is nothing"" said
Mr. Carpenter, ""in all the comedy of blunders
""and frauds under consideration, more inde-
fensble than the pretended canvass of this
Board. The following are some Of the objec-
["" tions to the validity of their proceedings: /.
""The Board had been abolished by the act of
Nov. 20. 2. The Board was under valid and
""existing injunctiOns, restraining it from acting
{"" at all 8. Conceding that the Board was in
existence and had full authority to canvass
s the returns, it had no returns to canvass
And he added: ""The proceedings Of Judge
""Durell and the support given to him by
United States troops resulted in establishing
the authority de fdcto of Kellogg and his
associates in State offices and of the per-
"" SONS declared by the Lynch Board to be
elected to the Legislature. We have already
I"" seen that the proceedings of that Board
cannot be sustained without disregarding all
"" the principles of law applicable to the sub
eject and ignoring the distinction between
good faith and fraud""


O. fnr tIa Atok IL a{,n
Of the Kellogg administration was certified
""by the proper local authorities.n Senator
Carpenters report likewise demOhshes the
assertion that it was ""judicially determined
""by the inferior and superior courts of the
Estate"" Mr.. Carpenter indeed seems to have
refuted the proclamation beforehand, as COM
pletely,as if he had known what it was to
| contains To the argument that the decision
of the State court bad confirmed Mr. Kellogg's
title, the answer is, he says: I. The court had
| no Testimony before it showing the character
of the proceedings by the Lynch Board, which
have since been proved void through fraud.
2. The court had no jurisdiction, and its
judgment was therefore absolutely null. And
as If anticipating the plea Of the President,
that he is bound to execute unjust and in
valid decrees, the report continues: ""For the
United States TO interfere in State cleo
a. ton, and by the employment of troops set
Cup Governor and Legislature without a.
""shadow Of right, and then TO refuse redress
of the wrong upon the ground that to grant
""relief would be interfering with the rights

THE WARDS ISLAND CONTROVERSY.",,"
THE ORIGIN OF THE DISPUTE ABOUT THE USE OF


THE CHAPEL on THE IsI.AND-No APPRoPRIA-


TON EVER MADE FOR sECTARIAN PURPOSES.


Previous to 1853 the Catholic and Protestant
immigrant inmates of Wards Island worshiped in the
chapel After that time separate apartments were
provided. The room which used for Protestant
worship sufficiently largo and accessible, being on
the second floor OF the Refuge building Tue apartment
for Catholic wsrshp on the floor above, and, IL Is
claimed, too small beside being dangerous in case
OF 1re &c moreover IT needed for school purposes
The matter was brought up at a meeting of the
Board Of Emigration Commissioners held June 2s
1870 when the Chairman OF the Wards Island Committee
requested 10 have examination made by some
competent architect of the condition OF the Catholic
chapel The examination 10 be in reference TO Its
strength aud security In view Of the large number OF
people assembled there during divine service On July
5th 1870 the question of erecting church ediace
first mentioned in the Board and referred to COM
mittee. The matter of building the new church.
not taken up again until the Fall OF 1871 when a
resolution offered by Commissioner Lynch to the eff
feet that building suitable for Catholic chapel should
be erected and an appropriation OF $4,000 should be
made therefor. This resolution, together with long
preamble stating the needs of the Catholic worshppers
the island laid the table at the time but taken
up again at q meeting held Nov. o. when 1t
was lost by tie vote. reconsideration OF
the matter moved at meeting held on the 2Sd OF
November, 1871, but objected to on parliamentary
grounds but s35 900 was appropriated for ""a church,
but not ""CathoIc chapel"" In the meantime plans for
the new church had been submitted and the one pre-
sented by Renwick and Sands approved by the COM
mttee having the matter in charge No record appears
the books Of the department OF any funds having
been furnished by private subscription for the building
OF the chapel.


At meeting Of the Board held May, 1872, the
religious question brought up again by resolution
offered by Commissioner walach, instructng the archi
tect 10 prepare his plans and specifications
for the church, with view to adapt the
same for holding Roman Catholic service as well
as the Protestant. Commissioner Lynch raised
point Of order stating that the resolution was
conflict with the previons action of the Board which
determined by resolution that the building to be erected
should be used only for the Roman Catholic inmates
Richard OGorman, President Of the Board, then occu-
pyng the chair ruled the point Of order not well taken
The resolution OF Commissioner Walach was finally
laid on the table, motion Of Commissioners Lynch.
On Dec T. 1872 Commissioner Lynch moved resolution
to the effect that the building erected Wards Island
""be devoted TO the and purposes for which 1t was
Intended. viz: place OF worship for the Cathollc
inmates Of the institution Wards Island. Commits
sioner Walach offered the following resolution us
substitute TO that offered by Commissioner Lynch.


Resolred That the counsel OF this Board be requested
TO report on or before Dec 16. inst his legal opinion
whether or not within the discretionary power



law 10 appropriate and expend any OF the fund belong
ing 10 said Commission for the sustaining salared cer-
gym9n, the erection OF building f0f the exclusive
use OF any particular sect


Commissioner Lynch withdrew his resolution. ana
Commissioner Wallaehs substitute carried. On
Jan % ls3 opinion Of the counsel to the Board was
received which stated that the church built by the
funds the Commission could not be used for any par
ticular sect exclusively. AT the same time was pre-
sented the opinion of Judge John X Porter who in the
If as ~ O
Commissioners, ""when one of the places of religious
worship became insufficient and unsafe, TO provide
suitable structure in it's place""


Since the completion Of the chapel In December last it
has been used exclusively by the Catholic congrega
ton The walls have been decorated at the expense OF
the Catholic employees the island with symbols en-
blematic Of the Catholic faith. The Protestants made
an effort to have share in the OF the building but
we're refused on the ground that Catholics
could not worship in the same building
with Protestants. The Wards Island Com
mittee OF the Commissioners OF Emigration
took up the matter and held investigation at Wards
Island July Of this year, when both the Protesaht
and Catholic chaplans called, and testified That
they knew of no other public institution where Catholics
and Protestants worshipped in separate apartments
Testimony was taken to show that 1t was common In this
country and in Europe for Proesants and Catholics to
have a common place Of worship The Committee has as
vet made no report TO the Board Mr. stephens""h
President of the Committee bitterly opposed to the
use OF the new building by the Catholics alone, andhe
prepared o report animadvertng severely ON H. An
other report will be prepared by Mr. James Lynch in
opposition thereto and perhaps even third report Will
ne presented Commissioner Stephenson gave TRIB-


r reporter the following in explanation OF his
conduct:


hold that it was unlawful on the part Of the late
Board Of Commissioners to appr9pa6 any ndr SH tba m
law governing TINS Commlsson aIS Rt tSe U Uonevs
Chapter $50 Section 6, reads thus but tne moneys %
received under any OF the PROVISIONS vi tu,s

given for account OF any persons or passengers
landing from vessels at the port OF Newfork or else
where shall not be applied or appropriated 70

isc and enoyment of rel gous profession and worship
without discrimination or pTeferenc, shall forever
of1Cer of the State cannot vote TO appropriate TINS
building which owned by the State to any one sect
exclusively.


Mr. lanes Lynch in opposition TO this, states that 1t
was perfectly lawful and in the just performance OF
their duties for the Commissioners to make the appro
praton for Catholic chapel. Mr. Lynch here referred
10 the letter of John K Porter the Board the gis Of
which has been given The law ty places S@mo11e fne

The fifth annual session OF the Supreme
Lodge, Knights of Pythias, met at Richmond, on
Tuesday last, in Pythian Castle Hall. which had
been fitted up for the occasion. At the call of
the roll of delegates, J. ]. McMullen and S. j.
Wiley responded in behalf of Delaware. Mr..
Wiley was subsequently initiated.


The Supreme Lodge decided adversely upon
thecredentials Of Past Grand Chancellor JOS
eph Spruill, of Norfolk, Va. MIR. Spruill was
elected to fill the vacancy cccasioned by the final
suspension OF p. q. q. George r. Buffum, of
Lynchburg. The decision of the Supreme
Lodge was in effect that Grand Lodge cannot
fill by election vacancy in the roster OF p. G..
O. g, occasioned by the misconduct and conse-
quent punishment of one of such officers.


The Supreme Chancellor submitted his annual
report, which is very voluminous but Of special
interest to the order. 1t shows that there are
thrty-three Grand Lodges, twelve hundred sub
ordinate lodges and a membership of about enc
hundred and twenty-five Thousand. I. .#


The report OF the Grand Scribe was also pre-
sented. 1t gives an interesting account of the
progress of the Order during the last year Eight
hundred and siXty-seven subordinate lodges, with
twenty-four grand lodges, were in existence at
the close OF the year 1871 since which time up
ward of four hundred subordinate lodges and
seven grand lodges have been organized. The
order has been extended into Washington Terri
tory and the States of Oregon and Nevada dur
ing the year.
Virginia in Exchange Hotel, on Tuesday even
ing, in honor of the meeting of the Supreme
Lodge.


SKETCH OF THE ORDER.


The Richmond Dispatch furnishes the follow
ing brief sketch of the Order


10 ]. II. RAthbone belongs the honor Of being
the founder of the Knights of Pythias. A rough
draft of the ritual was written by him in the
town OF Eagle Harbor. Houghton (now Keawe-
nayl county, Michigan, in the winter OF 1860 and
1861 Subsequently Mr.. Rathbone removed to
the National capital. On February 15 1864, steps
were taken by him to organize secret benevo-
lent society on the plan which he had Bketched
in 1861. On that day the members OF a musical
association known as the Orion Glee Club met at
the house No 369 +, between Eighth and Tenth
streets Washington. There were present Messrs.
II. A. Cham mJion, Il. s, Kimball, D. l.. Burnett,
w. II. Burnett, Roberts and Driver: Each OF
those gentlemen were soemnly obligated, by
Mr.. Rathbone, and having heard the ritual read,
determined to organize; and then and there re-
solved themselves into committees to obtain
suitable persons to form the first lodge.


On the 10th of February, in the same year, the
first lodge was instituted in Temperance Hall,
Washington, and the name Knights OF Pythias
was given to the Order. ritual was adopted,
and from time to time during the next few
months improved Grand Lodge was organ
iZed and four lodges were instituted in the Dis
trict of Columbia and one in Virginia before the
Order had reached it's second anniversary. 10
Virginia, therefore, belongs the honor of having
the first Lodge outside of the District Of Column
bia. 1t was named Alexandria Lodge, No. l, and
it lived only few months. Soon after, several
otl lodges died. and on the let OF August, 1860,
Franklin Lodge, OF Washington, was the only
one in existence.


The revival Of the order commenced in 1866
when it spread to Philadelphia, and from that
time until now its progress has been one OF CON
tluued and unexampled progress. On the 3lst
of December, 1866, there were four lodges, with
a membership of 379 on the 3Oth of July, 1867,
there we're eight lodges and G94 members. As
all evidence of the growth Of the Order since
that time we present the following record OF
the increase from year to year


December 81 1864 8 lodges rs members.


December 81, 1865, lodge, 50 members.


December 81, 1866. lodges, 379 members.

outrage in Indiana, extracts from which
we publish for the special edifeation of
the PadGGsh Journal and its Radical
followers, who are just now clamoring
about imaginary kuklux organizations.
In addition 10 the account below it will
be remembered, that three years since
six OF more mombers of the Reno gang
of express robbers were hanged by
mob; about two years ago three ne
groes, murderers of the Park family,
were also taken out of Jail and hung;
1870, Pickett aud Tongat, burglars,
were forced from the officers of the law
while on their way to Jail, and hanged
by the same process of Judge Lynch's
court. No person who has regard for
law can excuse these acts of violence,
but the point is, the American people
are of that temperament, 10 Indiana,
Kentucky, or any other State, that they
will in hours of excitement ""break
through"" aud take law iuto their own
hands.2 The journal threatens Ken
tueky with the condition Of Arkansas

""The vigilance committee of South
ern Indiana perpetrated another terri
Bile and bloody crime yesterday morn
ing. On the 29th of this month Delos
Hefren, of Salem, Washington county,
Indiana, thirty FIVE miles from New
Albapy, shot and killed john De Hall
stead.


Early yesterday morning a dispatch
was received in New Albany stating
that Heffren had been taken from the
jail that morning and


HUNG BY A MOB.


This news created the widest excite
ment throughout the entire city, for
Heffren is well known there, personal
ally and by reputation, and his last
murder has been the chief topic of con-
yersation for the past ten days.


At about half past one a body Of
masked men rode quietly into the town
and Immediately threw out sentinels,
aud took into custody all persons who
were out on the streets.


After the invaders had made them
selves safe from any outside interrupt
lion. they surrounded the Jail. Depu
tv sheriff Craycraft was aroused, and
demand was made upon him for the
key TO the prison. lie


REFUSED TO GIVE UP THE KEYS.


To accomplish forcible entrance
they had brought with them large
sledge hammer, with which they com
menced to hammer down the doors.


The work of


DEMoLIsHING THE DOORS
consumed over an hour. The heavy
blows OF the ponderous hammer WELD
ed by the powerful arms Of the regula-
tors. resounded through the town, and
doubtless each blow fell as if upon the
heart Of the doomed man, who waited
in his cell like the Gagged tiger for the
avengers of blood. At last the bolt
that held the last door was beaten off
and


HEFFREN STOOD BEFORE THE MOB.


He was standing by the side OF the
4 tiger upon his assailaDts. The des-
peration and bravery of the man was
too we'll known for them TO advance
upon him recklessly, for they knew he
would deal blows of death all around
him.


At this juncture the mob hit upon
the plan of lighting up his cell with
firebrsnds, giving them an opportunity
of fully seeing their man, and if neces-
sary


SHOOTING HIM DOWN
where be stood This was done: balls
were prepared and saturated with tur.
pentine and oil, and we're placed upon
sticks and held up on poles in front of
/ the cell windows. The lurid glare cast
upon the desperate man who stood at
! bay before the excited crowd, lit up a
( scene that will never be forgotten. As
soon as the light appeared the prisoner
was shot at a dozen times.


SEVERAL SHOTS TOOK EFFECT.
one in the breast, aud one in the left
arm, the arm being broken bya bullet
aud rendered useless, the piece of bed
stead falling from his hand A stone
was thrown which struck him upon the
head. The mob pressed closer upon
him, and the desperation of the doom
ed man grew greater, and it was evident
that he would fight until the last mo-
ment, and sell his life as dearly as pos.
sible. He knew that il was death be
fore him either way, and preferred to
die in the Jail while defending himself
rather than die by the rope. Another
blow from missile struck him on the
temple and stunned him. Several of
the mob here sprang forward and Crap
pied with him. He struggled with des
perate and superhuman strength, once
or twice freeing himself from the hands
of the vigilants. He was finally over
powered, and, still struggling, was
bound hand and foot. He was then

on the street. About two squares from
the Jail stands railroad bridge built
over creek. The bridge is perhaps 25
feet above the water. II has no frame
work above the track. He was taken to
this bridge, and while on the way there
asked:


What are you going to no with me?'


The mob replied:


'wE ARE GOING TO HANG YoUr""


Heffren answered quietly, as if it
was no great moment to him


81 will go along with you""


When they arrived at the bridge
rope was placed around his neck. He
then seemed to realize his fearful DO |
sition, and


BEGGED FOR TINE TO PEAY.


All of his courage here left him. and
with tears in his eyes he pleaded for
time to offer up prayer to Him
whose laws he had so often violated.
He did not then remember that he
gave his two victims, johnson aud De."

 Correspondence Of the editor, MT. C. L. Minor, dated Cerbat, September %, is full and interesting. Arriving ra, Camp Beale Springs, he met and compIimented Captain Thos. Byrne, commanding that post, Lieut.. Hurst and other citizens.

 Visiting Cerbat, the new county seat of Mohave county, he observed about l25 bous- es and cabins. Some of the houses he inti- mates, are superior to the average house of hi, own town, Yuma. Population of the place between $50 and 400. Mercantile houses were doing fair business for the cap ital invested.

 The smaller towns of Stockton Mineral Park and Chloride were also visited by our brother quill, who expresses himself pleased with their people and the wealth (mineral) surrounding them. Several arastras were running and paying.

 Coming to Prescott, by Webster & Whites stage, be found the road rough, on account of recent rains, but was we'll pleased on arriving here and meeting his friends, Capt. J. P. IIargrave, Dr. J. N. McCsndless and Judge Howard. Calling at the MINER office, dur ing our absence at Chino Valley, Col. Bige- low and Mir. Weaver greeted him. Calling again, shortly after our return to the sanc- tum, he was, we take it, astonished at not finding us all that his fancy painted us, and straightway proceeded to write down some very pleasing words about ourseif and better half, closing with kind wishes for things that are good, for all of which we feel duly grate- ful. Indeed, our only sadness comes of the fact that we were not at liberty to devote more time and attention to the comfort of brother Minor, who, nevertheless, left our village with . very good opinion of it, its people and business.

 MT. J. c. Bacon, acting editor, has another ""Arizons and Sonora paper,"" Tn this issue, she wording of which is suggestive of good dictionary head.

 For news. we have an account of the hang ing (lynching) of Manuel Subiate, a Gila monster, who assisted in the murder of the late Mir Lumley. Subiate met bis just fate at Kenyon station. When caught, he was in custody of the sheriff, who tried several lodges to save bis prisoners neck, but all to no purpose.

 Capt. Pool, of the Colorado Navigation Company, had informed the editor that trips would be made every twenty days, between San Francisco and the mouth of the Colorado, by either the Montana or Newborn.

 Col. Martin, of the Pay Department, U. S. A.. had arrived, paid soldiers at Yuma, and started for interior posts. Capt Burns, 9th cavalry, Capt. Geo. F. Price, of same regi- ment, and K. II. Haines, of the telegraph line, had also arrived.

 Commenting upon what the San Diego World recently said,- ,--in effect that Mexico was about to sell Lower Cahfornia to Ger many, t is set forth that 1t would take a great many German troops to take and hold the section, as our Government would not be likely to stick its finger in its mouth during the fermentation of such sauer-krout bar gain.

 Sunday, September l4, boy named wm. Le Roy was crushed to death by a heavy box falling upon him, which box contained printing material for the Sentinel. The boys father was accidentally killed, IA month. ago.

 The Mexicans of Yuma celebrated the an niversary of that countrys divorce from Spain, by singing, shooting of anvils and guns. A certain house was decorated with Prussian, Mexican and American flags, raised above each other in the order in which we print them, which display would not last long here or elsewhere in the Territory, as the place for our glorious stars and bars is above all other flags."

II was O curious Convention the one at
Lynchburg, Va, on Wednesday. 1t was a
very hot day in very hot season in very
hot climate, and the Convention was one half
of colored delegates. Elements enough here
to make very moist and fragrant session OF
it. And they certainly seem to have had It,
Col. Hughes, the favorite of the Admlnlstra-
ton and the candidate of the office holders
had apparently the advantage from the
start. This was so manifest that the
opposition candidate, Major Mcmahon, with
great discretion, withdrew early in the night,
to the great disgust Of many of the delegates
who had scented the battle afar of, and came
ND in the hope of finding market for the
privileges of an American freeman at the
rate of from fifteen to twenty dollars vote
Upon the understanding that Mcmahon
was to be withdrawn the Administra-
ton wing, with great magnanimity, ac-
corded to the Mcmahon faction the
organization, giving them the officers of the
Convention. 1t illustrates the confidence the
members of the Convention had in each other
that, very shortly after this had been consum-
mated, the Hughes party began to suspect
they had been deceived, that McMahOn would
not withdraw, and that his friends who now had
control Of tho Convention would spring trap
and carry the nomination. Out of this there
appears to have grown great deal of debate
and use of tactics on one side and the other,
which protracted the session till dawn. Ac-
cording to all the reports the discussions prelm-
mary to decisive action upon the nomina-
ont
much information of varied and interesting
character.


To this debate q colored delegate from AL
exandria, Seaton by name, gave tone, and,
we may add, without rejecting upon his COM
plexion-cOlor. He was there, he said, with
""out any instructiOns""-an apparently useless
waste of the plural cumberland he did not pro-
pose to discuss canal projects. He was for MAJOR
McMahon-whose name, it Is said, he t0und
some difficulty in pronouncing-becauseh he was
the ""most available man."" Wien the crowd
laughed indecOrously at his attempts to pro-
nounce Mcmahon"" he remarked with great
dignity that they might ""hoo-hOo now"" but
they would ""boo-hoo hereafter"" point which
was well taken, and met with enthusiastic ap-
plause. With just shade of bitterness, he
rpInETktu
and black in the Convention who had
come there to be bought up, and
who had ""no more interest in
""the State of Virginia than hog"" and he
denounced them all as carpet-baggers. This
striking figure Of speech excited continued
merriment, when the chairman, who seems
not to have had any sort of appreciation OF
the gravity of the occasion, asked the orator
to confne himself to the question. The
audience, however, cried out to give
chin latitude,p but the Alexandria del
egate made ready answer, 81 don't want
latitude but you want common sense"" and
proceeded to quote from Shakespeare about
"" the tide in the affairs of men,"" which the
Convention drowned in cries and laughter.
To some ridiculous person who asked him to
"" sit down or speak to the point"" Mr.. Seaton
responded with vivacity, "" If l was a big jack
""ass like you the Convention would MT have
""any fun which was received with uprOar-
ious laughter.


After several hours of this entertainment,
Major McMahon's name was formally withdrawn
and the Administration and office-holders'
candidate nominated without opposition. The
features Of the Convention worthy of remark
were two first, the interference of the Admins
tration and virtual dictatiOn of the ticket of the
office holders; and, second the appearance for
the first time in q Republican State Con-
yenton in Virginia of considerable
number of native born white citizens. This
last is one of the good signs of the times
If the farmers of Virginia, the property
and those most interested in the welfare of the
State can lay aside their prejudices and act in
convention with the blacks, they will be doing
very sensible and judicious thing. They
may not accomplish all they desire this
year or next, but they are laying the
foundation for healthy political influence
with the blacks, which will give them an op-
portunity to cOunteract much of the mischief
of the carpet-baggers. The crude perform
ances of the colored men themselves in these
conventions are more or less amusing, but
they do no harm, and really furnish an excel
lent school for them to learn the duties and
privileges of citizens.

BALTIMORE AND ONO RAILROAD


COMPANY.",,"I
dcnce and economy Of It's construction and
line was deemed by many engineers at the
tlmc an absurdity that would he signalizcd
by utter failure. Its final completion
and successful operation wus justly esteemed
tho greatest triumph Of engineering skill oc-
curing during that period. 1t has more cur
vature, heavier grades and greater mileage |
OF tunnel than any other great trunk line |
between the Atlantic and the Ohio basin, and |
yet II hauls Its frcights at Ices expense per
mile than any Of them, and shows more net |
earnings. The last annual report made by |
President Garrett for the board Of directors |
to tho stockholders Is clear, concise and |
buslncss-liko document. The exhibit which |
Il makes Of the condition OF the affairs |
Of the company must be most graft |
flying. As may be seen by refer
crcncc to the figures In another column
the gross earnings Of the road and branches
during the last year to the enormous sum Of
fifteen and half millions. Its expenses
were ten millions, and net earnings for the
year Eve and half millions. Two scmi.au-
nual dividends Of i've per cent upon the
capital stock were made and paid In cash,
and the balance Of net earnings Of the year
carried to the surplus revenue capital ac-
count which now amounts to upwards Of
twenty-niDc millions, composed entirely Of
undivided net earnings Of the road. This
crcditablc showing Is unparalleled In the his
tory OF the railroads Of the country, and in
dicates vigilance and prudence In the man
ngcmcnt worthy OF the highest commenda-
tlon.


While this judclous action has character
lied the policy Of Mr.. Garrett throughout
the history Of his administration Of the Affairs
Of the company, II has In no sense curtalled
the proper spirit Of enterprise that should
pcrvadc works of internal improvement Of
the magnitude Of the Baltimore and Ohio
railroad. On the contrary, with far-sceing
sigaeity the policy has been pursued Of
gradually extending Its lines westward TO
Cincinnati and st. Louis, to Plttsburg and
Chicago al the Northwest, to Lynchburg,
liarrisonburg and Staunton at the South
west, by which important connections arc
formed with oil the great producing sections
OF the country.


Having taken these measures for the at
traction and concentration Of the surplus
products Of agriculture upon the seaboard at
Baltimore, Mr.. Garrett next turned his at
teniion to providing facilities for their cx-
portation abroad. In 1863 line OF Clyde
steamers was established to ply between Bal
tlmorc and Livrpool in connection with this
mammoth system Of railways, and SO large
was tho traiilc seeking this new route that
there arc now six nrst-class ocean steamers
proGtably employed In the line. This route
from the Mississippi valley to Europe Is cx-
cmpt from the extreme cold Of the Pennsyl-
vania and New York lines, besides being
much lees In distance by railway, and conse-
Qucntly much cheaper; q combination OF I'D
vantagcs which always exert a controlling
influence In the direction Of trade.


IL will DO noticed with much pleasure by
tho citizens Of this District that the Western
travel and traffic Of this line now passes over
the Metropolitan branch through the Ma
tional Capital, and that the Baltimore and
Ohio Company speak with commendablc
pride II possessing In that branch the short
est route from Washington to all parts of the
West and Northwest. Another matter for
congratulaiion by our citizens Is the official
statement that the company Is guaranteeing
the construction of line from this city to
Point Lookout, Maryland. This will give
Washington more easy access TO Norfolk, by
way Of the Bay Line Of steamers from the
Point.


The vast combination Of railway facilities
at the command Of the Baltimore and Ohio
Company were Of essential service to the
Post Office Department during the season
Just past. When the Northern companies
combined together to strike for higher rites
OF remuneration for hauling postal cars, the
sagacity aud patriotism Of Mr.. Garrett and
his associates prevented them from joining
In tho arrangement. But, learning that the
Postmaster General could not legally ac-
ccdc TO the demands Of the combination
without the authority of Congress, they
at once placed their entire facilities at
the disposal of the Department, leaving the
question Of remuneration for future equita-
bic adjustment by Congress and the Postmas-
ter General. This prompt action Of the
comTa any broke the back Of the corner""
and the people were allowed to enjoy their
postal facilities un!n,crruptedly In spite Of
the monopollsts.


Since the opening Of tho Metropolitan
Branch the Baltimore and Ohio railway has
become virtually q quasi Washington insti-
tuition. II affords our citizens as many facil-
tiles as 1t does those OF Baltimore, and we
hail the evidence Of It's continued and In
creased prosperity as another sign Of the
permanent and healthy growth of the Ma
tional Capital.

ST. LOUIS, May 5.-A terrible accident occurred
Yesterday afternoon at bridge being erected over
the Lanune River. on the northwestern extension
Of the Missouri Kansas and Texas Railroad II miles
from Sedalia The false work erected for facili-
taing the construction of the bridge sank into the
quicksand upon which it rested, carrying with it
the bridge timbers and ~ wOrkmen, and precipi-
tatipg all into the river below. William hcEvoy,
Peter Conner, and Harry lynch were killed out
right. and eight Others were wounded, two of whom
are not expected 10 recover The bodies of the
three killed were taken last night to Sedalia, where
an inquest was held, and verdict rendered that the
insecure foundation of the false WORKS was the
cause Of death."

we obtain the following additional particu


lars concerning the arrest. confession and


lynching Of the gang who, on the night of


the thirteenth instant, murdered Messrs


Lanet and Snaer at their store in New


Iberia and then set fire to the building con-


tanning their dead bodies:


Mr. Kyle and others started on Sunday


from New Iberia in search o. the murder.


ers, but only rumOrs we're brought back by


them.


Mr.. Kyle, in his description of the ne.


grOes he saw in the store on the night of


the murder, caused suspicion to point


strongly to one POlycarp, black, villain


GUS looking negro. and O1 Tuesday he was


arrested in the neighborhOod Of the
tragedy.


On Tuesday morning a large number of
citizens, many armed, assembled in Snaer-


vile for the purpose of attending the cor
Oner's jury investigation. The first witness
brought on the stand was Poiycarp. He
denied all knowledge of the affair, but upon
being closely questioned by brother of
one of the murdered men, Mr. Seymour
Snaer (attorney- -at-law, of New Orleans), he
confessed to having been at the store when
the deed was done, but had no hand in it.
He gave the names OF Martin Peterson,
Ozemie and Adrien Frilot, alias Williams
All three were arrested. but denied the
charge.


At about P. NJ. the prisoners under citi-
zen guards, reached New Iberia, where
they confessed their crime.


They went to the store, and after attract
ing the attention of the two prOprietOrs by
engaging them in showing them their goods,
upon given signal by one of the prisoners,
both Lanet and Snaer were telled to the
floor by heavy blows, administered with
hickory clubs. Adrien FrIlot, the most
powerful OF the party, cut their thrOats.
The doors were then closed, and taking the
safe key from Snaer's pocket the safe was
rided Of $500 in currency and $500 in gold
and silver. The bodies were then carried
into room, saturated with coal oil and
set fire TO-


The alarm Of fire was then given bv the
murderers. The prisoners were all young
men, the oldest twenty three years old
They belonged to q gang of thieves and
murderers, who have been operating in
that neighborhood for the past eighteen
months, and during that time the murders
amount to four and two attempts at assas-
sination, besides in the past six months not
less than four daring robberies, among
which the warehouse of Swain. telegraph
operators house, district attorneys house
and Lanet & Snaer's store. Mr.. Snaer hav-
ing promised protection to Polycarp if he
all. was protected by him and
sent to jail under charge of a constable to
guard him from being taken out and hung
oy the incensed and indignant people.


At about sunset from 1900 to 1000 colored
people had assembled in New Iberia. and,
taking Paterson. Ozemie and Adrien Frilot
across the bayou, tied them together and
swung them to an oak limb They were so
,lose together that their cheeks touched
each other.


One of the prisoners. while they were
,ying his HANDS, stated that he was steam |
ooatman and would die like steamboat |
BULLY. All three seemed Indifferent to their |
ate. Two of rhe number were recog-
,ized as having attended the funeral |
hanging no drop was used, bat
white and colored men hoisted them
Up bodily from the ground. Their necks
we're not broken but they were choked to
ieath. No manifestation OF pain or suffer |
ng, and the only movement made was by |
he strong man, Adlien, who shrugged his
houlders three times When taken down
lext day, with the exception of slight |
projection of the tongue, their features
we're not the least contOrted. The Rev. L.
Jessup offered prayer at the scatfold.
md they were placed in rough boxes and
,uried.


Our correspondent visited Polycarp and
lsked him if they had succeeded in eluding
he authorities was it their intention of
committing more such deeds. He answered
i spec So


Polycarp is expected to still confess more,
md the citizens are confident of capturing
he whole gang. Officers are already on
rack of three more men, and before our
'aper reaches the public they will likely
ave them secure in Jail, if not taken by the
itizens and strung to the same oak limb as
heir confederates. Polycarp is supposed
o have been the leader OF the band. and
urniug States evidence is regarded as the
'yeaking up of the gang."

Jail TO Escape LvnchiDg-A Confession


from Lennon -GiIiiRan's Threats.


The excitement in Jamaica yesterday
over the shooting Of the late Philip Reed How
ard In woodhaven on Sunday was much greater
than over the election. About o'clock on Mon
day evening the Sheriff determined, after con-
sultation with the Coroner to remove the pris-
oners, Patrick Gilligan and James Lennon, TO
tue county Jail at North Hempstead. This was
done because 1t was feared that the citizens
might take the law into their own hands and
lynch the prisoners. Many persons who would
grayltate toward the centre OF the town on cleo
ton day, they thought, would make the prison
ers' situation dangerous. A wagon was taken
to the door OF the Town Hall, and Gilligan
and Lennon were quietly transported to North
the jsiler TO allow nobody whomsoever to visit
the prisoners except the duly authorized ON
GERS of the law. Two officers were placed on
guard near the cell in the Jail.


That these precautions were wise may be In
ferred from the fact that later In the evening a
tcrmlned to take Gilllgan and Lennon out and
lynch them. when they learned that the pris-
oners had been taken To the county jail the ex-
cited crowd proposed to go there for them. But
wiser counsel prevailed, and 30 far the law has
been allowed to take its course. IL is said that
there had been no such intense excitement In
Jamaica since 1S49.


Before tho prisoners were taken from the cells
In the Town Hall Justice John II. Snedeker
questioned Lennon so sharply about the homi-
eide that he was Induced to make a statement
OF what he knew about IL. In the presence of
John III. Sutphin and two other gentlemen Len
non said substantially to Justice Snedcker that
he and his father-in-law, Patrick Gilligan, were
out cunning on sunday m orninR. At about noon.
as they were crossing n salt meadow, they both
sat down ON a hay cock. Then the late Mr..
Howard approached and asked them what they
were doing there. Gilligan replied that they
were not on his land but ON one Conollys. Mr..
Howard stepped toward Glligan saying, "" III
let you know, you - -. Mr. How
ard had one hand extended toward Gilllgan and
the other thrust into his pantaloons pocket. As
Mr.. Howard continued to advance Gilligan
raised his gun and discharged one barrel at him.
As Mr.. Howard still pressed ON toward Gilligan
he fired a second shot. The last time Gilligan
fired the muzzle Of the gun was so close To Mr..
Howard's breast that the entire charge passed
through his body. Lennon continued that,
knowing as he did the reputation Of Gilgan, he
fed from the spot az fast as possible.


Lennon Is to be called upon the stand at the
inquest to-day, and then will tell what he knows
about the homicide under oath. IL is said that
Others have been summoned who will testify
that they have heard Gilligan frequently threat
en- to KIN any one who mOested him for gun
ming on Sunday.


Mr.. Howard's funeral Is to be in the Congrega-
tional Church in Woodhaven on Thursday after
noon. The Rev. william James, the pastor of
the Woodhaven Church. performed the cere-
mony at Mr. Howard's wedding. He regarded
him az one Of the most upright and liberal men
In the community."

Harris Richmond ct al vs. +. O. Minor


Decision by Judge CullOm:


This suit is based on a promlss0ry note
for 1919 ""a, made payable to the order of


Arnold Weber, who indOrsed it in blank
and signed by ""F. o. Minor, captain com
manding company 1t comes up now on
an exception taken by defendant, in which
he pleads, first, no cause of action, and sec
ond, he AYERS that the petition is illegally
drawn, and contradictory upon its face, in
this that the prayer thereof is for judg-
ment against respondent, personally, where
as the note declared on and filed with said
petition appears to have been made by F..
o. Minor in q representative capacity, i. e.,
as captain commanding company. He,
therefore, prays for the dismissal of the suit.
In support of this exception he cites the
case of Nicholson vs.. Chapman, l A,
222, in which the court said that the
word appended to the indOrser's name is
notice that the note belonged to the estate.
and that it can not be indorsed without an
order of the court, and the purchaser is
bound. at his peril, TO ascertain whether
such order exist"" Notes belonging to
succession are not negotiable by the syndic
or administrator, without an order OF the
court, and hence as every one is presumed
TO know the law, the word syndic was no
tice that had no right. as such, TO transfer
the note. it was not presumed that the
court had authorized him to dispose of it,
and the transferee was bound to examine
for himself. He also cites the case of Gao
Ion VS.. Matherne, in An, 496, where they
held that, ""A note which shows Oh Its face
that il was given by a married woman, is
sufficient notice to any one to put him on
inc ury as TO whether it Injured to her sepa-
rate use, before he discounted it, or whether


the authority of her husband could be dis
pensed with"" The reason Of this de-
csion is so similar to that in the case of
Nicholson We. Chapman, just cited. in that
the law in both cases prohibits such trans
actions, except under specified crcum-
stances, and the courts can not presume in
either case that the conditions under which
the law prohibits them have been Ohvia.ed
by compliance with its necessary require
meDts. Every one knows that a syndic is
a representative, and that representative.
commissioned by the court, can not indOrse
the paper he holds as such, so as to convey
a valid title thereby without an order OF the
court. So, too, every one knows that mar
ried women are not authorized, except in
particular cases, to sign promissOry notes,
and therefore in both cases there is, from
the very nature Of our laws, notice to all |
persons that such persons are not independ- !
emily authorized to sign and transfer prom
issory notes. Counsel also refers to Par |
sons on Notes, vol. |, y. 81, ct seq., and !
notes. That author says ""lf an agent of |
an Incorporated company make d note be- |
ginning L PROMISE etc, and sign it a b,
agent of - company, it is quite we'll set |
tied that the company, not the agent, will |
be liable on the note. And the same rule |
applies portion to the case OF public off |
GERS or agents appointed to discharge pub |
lie trusts and duties"" He also cites the |
opinion of Chief Justice Swift, in Huyey vs. |
Magill e Conn. Reps, p. 6S0j. whore the |
defendant, being the agent OF corpora.
ton, gave note in the torn above gwen, |
the judge said: when an agent. duly au-
thOrIZed, subscribes an engagement i'll such !
manner as 10 manifest an interest not 70 |
bind himself, but to bind the principal, !
then it is clear that the contract can not be |
binding personally. The intention must be
taken from the whole instrument taken |
together. We are bound to give effect to |
every word if possible: and the only way |
to give this word any effect is to make the
note binding on the company"" Shaw. C.. |
j laid it down as rule, that ""where the |
person signing processes not to bind him
self, but adds the name of another to indi-
cate his capacity or trust in which he acts. |
or where the 81 signature indicates that he is
performing merel Y ministerial function,
giving authenticity to the act, promise or





all the cases cited there was a principal
who could bind himself, either a corpora
ton or a natural person. In this instance
there is no one who stands in the attifude
Of principal except the defendant. This
military company is not a corporation.
It can not sue or be sued, because
40 name has been given it legisla-
lively. The name is OF the very essence
,f it constitution, without which it
,an perform no corporate functions what
'over. See Smiths Mercantile Law, edition
If 1857, page III. Where corporations
,xist by Legislative acts the courts take
judicial notice of them. 1t is not custom
iry to incorporate military companies, and
therefore they can have no agents except |
uch as may represent the persons com |
posing them in their individual capacities.
suppose in this case the plaintiff lad iusti-
uted his suit against the company, what
lame would he give it in his petition! |
Upon whom could the service have been
egaIly made! Would not an exception
aiken to the liability Of the companv for
want Of incorporation be maintained with |
mt hesitation by the court! In this case
he defendant has not disclosed who his |
principal is, and he can not escape rrsp0n- |
ihility. See Parsons on Notes ami Bills,
}. lO5 See alsU Story On Agency see. I55; |
.lso sec. $50


The whole doctrine proceeds upon the |
,lain principle that he who is capabIe ct |
and does not contract in bis
'wn name, although he is the agent Of an
ther who is incapable OF contracting, in. /
ends to bind himself since n no oil |"

- Mr.. higgins said that he had carefully examine
this question, and was OF the opinion that tn
word ""White was not in the charter; and that tn
;. Board was bound to furnish an education to o.
g. the children of the city, without regard to race
y color.


I. !. Mr. McIntire-II the gentleman will refer t
q Section 4, Of the charter, he will find that it doe

RI The supreme law OF the land has given TO th


coiored man equal rights and privileges with th
N white man, and these rights apply to school priV
ileges as we'll as others. The coored people hav


u right 70 send their childIen to our schools, an

n of their own torbearsnce. Under the law OF u
nj land firmly believe 1t is the bounden and leg
a dutY Of the Board to furnish schools tor colore


children, and to give Council an estimate of Il
bn amount required for them. If this Howard scho


Is offered 10 the Board, we had better take it,

Mr. H. NJ Jenkins stated that If the Boa

new rule Is made in the case OF nurses and order

The following changes were made In the salaref

sion, salary increased from $1,000 to $4,000 Tht
salary Of Mr. Bergen was increased In consequenc.
OF additional duties being imposed upon him. Il
had always been the custom for the Superinten
dent OF Wards Island TO make all the purchase
needed for the island, but the Commissioners have
determined to abolish the once OF superintendent 8

purchaser to the Treasurer. No formal action hal
been taken In regard to the once OF Superinten

late incumbent expired on November the Conn

to do so.


In times past the surgeon-in- Chief received

Of the larger sum is as clear as that brought
forward year ago relative to the smaller

Further investigation of the Louisiana cleo
ton cases develops some interesting facts.
The testimony of Jacques, a Republican super
visor of Elections, given yesterday, is most
damaging to the Kellogg party. 1t shows tha'
the Lynch Returning Board made up their
returns ON the basest and shall0west frauds.
Not only did they depend on mere newspaper
accounts for the basis of their returns, but
certificates of United States Supervisors at
tached to blank forms were distributed widely
through the State to be filed up by anybody
and everybody who would put in name.
These certificates, which were afiidavits that
the sieners had been deprived of the right
of suffrage, bore the names of the dead, the
absent and the non-voting. Such barefaced
fraud has not been perpetrated in this coun-
try, according to the evidence, since the days
when the Missouri Border Rufllans voted The
st. Louis Directory in the towns of Kansas.

justified and the Executive of the United

HALF THE COST OF THE NEW BUILDINGS = DE-


BATE IN COUNCIL ON THE sUByB0r.


1t will be remembered that, at a special meet


ing of Council held on Wednesday evening,


committee was appointed to devise some means


by which the subject Of the removal of the


County Seat from New Castle to Wilmington


might be brought before the proper tribunal


This Committee made its report, last evening, in


which it stated that, after mature deliberAton it


deemed it expedient for the city to donate an


eligible site for the buildings and to pay one-half


the cost of the erection of the same in the
event that the Legislature should grant the


requisite authority. '--' r.


After the matter was properly before Council,


Mr. Febiger objected to the report because il


was not specific enough-it did not mention. the


location OF the lot, did not impose the duty


upon the city to pay one-half the cost, and made
no estimate of the oost--all Of which seemed to


be binding the Council to do something which


was very Indefinite. The Levy Court might de-


termine to erect buildings at cost of half


millions of dollars. The sentiment Of the coun-


ty and city, he said, WAS almost unanimous in


favor of the removal, and he himself was in


favor of it. But il the city agrees to pay one4


half the cost of the building, it will leave but


little for the county to provide for the city pays


two-thirds Of the taxes, and it would therefore


pay this ratio of the countys half Of the expense


in the new buildings. .-t .s h7'""


Mr.. Quinn was pleased at the idea of the city


and county erecting the necessary buildings for


each conformity. An estimate he said, might be


approximated and he felt sure the Levy Court


would be as economical as Council. h


Mr.. Lchtenstein, in reply to MIR. Febigsr, said


that the Committee had gone as far as it had the


right to go, aud did not wish 10 transcend It's int


struetions Its duty was not to prepare plans Of


the proposed building, In regard to the cost of


the erection Of tho building he said, the city


IL 20 Iaa.f. ~.


way. II the building is to cost 800 900 and the


city pays two-thirds Of this sum it will amount


to S66, ,666 il it donates one-half and then pays


two-thirds in taxes it amounts to $83 1888, and il
it donates one-thiEd and then pays two-thirls in


taxes It amounts TO $77, 7,777--ao that the differ


ence is not 30 very marked between q donation


OF one-half and none at all. The report was


proper and right and shows an earnestness on
the part of the city. The preparation Of plans
was the work Of another commtte.


Mr.. Febger said that two sites were pro-


posed for the location Of the building--one worth
$780, 900 (the present siteof the City HalD, and
the other $4,000 (the site OF the Market street


baain). On the top of this donation and one
half the cost Of the proposed building would
come a jail, about which nothing was said, as II
ii was the intsntion 10 keep this in the dark. !
S10O, 600 he said, would not put up building


suitable for both the city and county and render
it hre-proof; there must be place for the REQ
ords $50 600 would not build the foundations


He was wilmington the city TO pay it's proportions
il the lot Ia allowed. -pS@
Mr, Pickles said that some dark pictures had


been drawn of the necessity for the change, but
none of them were, to his mInd, dark enough
He had understood that $5, 900 were. spnually


paid by the Loan Associations in sending their
representatives to New Castle, in examinations,
&e., and that oneIhAR that amount would be
saved il the county seat were OF Wilmington.


The city could afford both to give the lot and
put up the buildings. 100000, he said would
erect building suitable for both the city and
county, and render it fire proof, at that. The
cost OF buildings was in their elaboration and
not in. the mortar, brick and iron. There 10
an actual need Of new county Court House,
| and one must be built soon. II the present one
| is torn down and new one is erected at New
Castle, Wilmington will pay two=thirds the cost
because it pays two thirds the taxes. The city


needs new hall, because new members will
soon be coming in and accommodation mustsbe
made for them and the people who wish to gath
| or at the weekly meetings. All the rooms are
| too small; and increased accommodations


are needed in these II the city builds


newhal it must pay all the expense
What then will be the difference in the cost


to the city if the proposed new building is erected
| and it pays the proportion which is recommend
/ ed, than II new county buildings are put up at
New Castle, and the city pays two-thirds of their
| cost, and new hall is erected in Wilmington,
and the city pays it's entire cost Not $5 900 he
claimed. He then spoke of the desirability of
the site Of the present City Hall for the new
| county and city building.


Mr. Richardson was opposed to the city pay
| ing such large proportion Of the expense.
| Mr. Quinn again urged the necessity for the
removal. Referring to the cost Of the building,
he spoke Of ire-proof which had been erected in
| Delaware county at acost Of $3.50, 900 and said
that one adequate for both city and county could
| be built for less money. The offices are strong
| along from Hedgeville to 10th and Market, and


these should be gathered into one building, If it
| cost $780, 900.


| Mr. Candy was surprised that there should be
| any opposition to the report OF the Committee.
| One week ago there was considerable talk of an
| expenditure of half million dollars on the
/ Water Works and no one was scared, but when
the expedienoy of giving away a lot of ground
| and $50, 600 for this building was proposed an
| alarm was at once sprung. He was afraid that
| enough money would not be expended in the
| enterprise. As for economy. he was - much in
| favor OF it as any member Of Council he came
| there for it. The building ought to be erected
| Jointly, .even IL lit should cost $2OO,OOO New
Castle county was certainly able to stand 1t. He
then spoke Of $500, 600 being expended in county
buildings In undevoloped portions Of the West
| and thought that this county was as able to ex-
| pend that amount Of money as they. fga
The report was adopted by UiUd Uooe vote,

Judge Lynch's Dec isiOn-The Herald Nis-
understands 1t.
NEW ORLEANS, June II, 1873.
EDITOR Republican,:


Permit me to inquire. through the me-
dunn of your columns, what could have
been the intent of the Herald in publishing g
editoriaIly the following mis-s;atement this
evening:


1t is true the constitution guarantees the
right OF pleading the truth to ali actions OF
libel. But the truth. according TO Lynch.
of tria. and conviction in the First Dis,
trict Court. The Fourth District Cour. has
nothing to do with such inquiries. 1t de-
pends on the First District Court for all its
truth


at is of no consequence"" 9uoth Lynch.
''hew much false swearing you may prove
against man; if he has not been convicted
OF the crime known as perjury it Is libel
Ons to impute that crime to him"" So it is
lioelOus to say OF the most yir.uous of our
citizens as Lynch and his party have a
thousand times said and written. tina. they
were traitors and rebels. Wien there never
has been conviction for either treason or
rebellion.


Judge Lynch said nothing OF the kind:
nothing that could have been. by any rea
sonabIe and honest hearer, tortured into
anything like it. The point had been made
by plaintiffs attorneys tina: if. in the
original publication. on account OF which
the libel suit had been brought, the crime
of perjury had been charged. and if. in
plaintiffs petition. that published charge
had been alleged as foundation of the ac-
ton, that Defendants answer must either
fully justify the charge or deny the publ
cation: that, il justification were the plea,
the Jurisdiction should be as broad as the
charge itself. In other words, defendant
justifying the charge. should aver the
truth Of their original and published ale
CATION of crime and should sustain their
justification, if they would make their plea
etfectual, by such proof as would convince
the jury that the plaintiff lad really been
guilty of the crime imputed.


Crime exists here only by statute. The
technical pleadings required by criminal
practice are perhaps not requisite in libel
suit, even when an imputation Of crime
forms the basis of the cause: but evidence
equivalent in substance to what would be
required in trial for perjury OF theft
would be required in a libel suit on account
OF a publication charging perjury Or theft.
when the defendant attempted to establish
the truth Of his publication.


Judge Lyach's ruling did not cover all
the points here recited, but it went no fur
ther. The lawyers in attendance at the
trial will bear out the assertion that this
version OF the matter is correct. and that
the Herolds account (editorialIy promui-
gated. is not. LEN."

power them to establish and maintain schools fol
the education of coored children.


Mr.. Hayes asked If these schools were to be
separate and distinct from the schools for white
chrildren.


Mr. Pickels stated that, as he understood it, the
schools were to be separate.


In the petition, the word separate"" had origi
naly been inserted before the words schools,
but was stricken out by Mr.. Foulk Upon this
question being asked by Mr.. Hayes, the Commit.
tee took the report, and TeInserted the woro

Mr.. Lynch thought that this would impose toe
much duty on the Board OF Z incation. Then

children Of the city which they could not do. Ii,
thought, these additional schools should be under
the charge of Board of Commissioners.

Viewed from an elevated standpoint,
how revolving, how dcmorplizing, and in

part of the spectacle il that from the be-

on the side of fraud, of forgery, Of perjury,

From an Occasional Correspondent


I,IprarY. BfpFoRD County, VA",,"LInERrr. BEDFORD SorssJy,y.


By permission write you a few lines as to
the progress Of events In this section of our
State. This little town lies at the foot Of the
Peaks Of Otter, and Is fayorite resort Of n
great many people from oil parts OF the conn
try during the summer months, Our hotels
are good, and their charges are moderate;
our girls are pretty and our young men are
gallant. Then we also have an enterprising
and


ENERGETIC SET OF BUSINESS MEN,
who are doing everything In their power to
build up the place. Tobacco Is the great
staple In this county, and the tobacco in
terest Is the large ono here. We have two
large warehouses for the sale of the leaf, and
nine factories for the manufacturing of the
same, and their product stands deservedly
high. There are also other Establishments
for stemming and packing, and some Of them
ship direct to England from this point. We
also have two foundr.es In successful opera
ton, and party engaged In the msnufac-
ture of agricultural implements. There Is
room and need for many more industries.
Bedford Is large county, and has been q
very rich one, and will be again.


We NeTN ko
on yesterday to attend court and hear the
speaking. The Republicans had the Hon. G.
=. Ramsdell, Judge David Fultz, aud Capt.
J. Ii. Rives, Congressional canvasser for the
district, from abroad; and our townsman,
James FoOte johnson. The other side had
General Kemper, Judge Huston, of Bathurst;
John W. Daniel, Of Lynchburg, and others.
The Republicans were very anxious to ar
range for joint discussion. but could get


NO PAIR TERMS FROM THEIR OPPONENTS,
so Kempcr and party took up position In q
tobacco warehouse, and the Republicans took
position on the court green. The Republican
county committee had secured the services
Of an excellent brass band from the Mont.
gomcry White sulphur Springs, and they
were soon Joined by many who had gone to
the warehouse with the gentlemen Of con-
script ticket. Several Of the most substan-
tial citizens of the county told me that there
was too much secession down there for them. ""
We had fine speeches from our candidates,
Mcssrs. Ramsdell and Fultz; also q No. l
speech from Captain J. ii. Riyes. 1t was a
great day for the Republicans Of old Bedford,
and all are determined to do their whole duty
on the 4th of November.


General Kemper was taken out riding by
one Of our local politicians after his speech,
and they were both thrown out OF the buggy
and considerably bruised.


They are commencing soon on him. With
ers stock looking up, ch!

down to the shore, divested himself of

LIFE IN INDIA.-The usual routine of
European life in India is to rise at ""gun-
fire"" five o'clock, go out for an airing
IN boat or palanquin for two full hours,
bathe and dress at eight, take breakfast
at nine, lunch at one, and siesta from
two to four, when everybody retires, and,
whether one wishes to sleep or not, he
Is secure from interruption, and has the
full benefit of being en- deshabille for the
two most oppressive hours of the day.
At four the second bath is taken; at five
all go out in full dress in open carriages,
and after rapid drive over some of the
public thoroughfares, the horses are
walked slowly up and down the esplan
ade, where all the fashionable world as
semble at this hour to see and be seen,
and exchange passing courtesies and
comments. At half-past six ""the course""
is deserted, and brilliantly-lighted din
ing-rooms are thronged with guests ca
ger to test the quality of the rich and
varied delicacies of which an Oriental
dinner consists. This is the principal
meal of the day, and, often occupying
two or three hours, it is made not mere
ly an epicurean feast, but also an intel
lectual and social banquet. Strong cof-
fee, served in the tiniest of porcelain
cups, follows the guests on their return
to the drawing g-rooms, and music, con-
versatlon, reading and company fill up
the hours till midnight, when the third
bath IS taken Immediately before retir-

and wilfully false As soon as I read
the Article I addressed letter to
Colonel r. B. Rhett, Jr., the editor,
which was handed to him by a friend
After reading it, Colonel Rhett stated
that he, within tyenty-four hours,
would answer; and this time was
granted. To-day [ received his an
swer; and l now put before the people
of New Orleans the two letters:


New ORLEANS, June %, 1878.
II. Il. Rhct, Dr., Editor of the Plea
yuie:


SIR-In the Picay,tnc of this morn
ing, under the caption of ""Hawkins
VS.. the Picayat,ae."" you take the liberty
of commenting upon the incidents of
the trial of the libel suit against the
paper. SO far as you deal i'll generali-
ties, it is not my purpose to ask you
any explanation; but i'll referring to
me, under my own name, you have
been guilty of what | consider direct
misrepresentation You refer to my
concluding argument for the plaintiff,
and say that [ travelled ont of the re-
cord and misrepresented facts because
| knew no one was to follow me and
show my mistake, which you qualify
as not only wilfully but maliciously
false. In this connection you allude
to and quote from my argument as
follows:


""This canvass (of the Lynch return
ing bOard) was made-this result pro-
claimed to the citizens Of the State of
Louisiana on the twelfth day of De-
cember What did the Picays,,ae do :?
Did the Picayuae in the month of De-
cember say one word about it? No
not a word. Then comes the month
of January. Did the Picoyene in the
month of January say one word about
it? Not syllable. Another month is
about to expire. On the twenty-third
of February, two months and a half
since the action was committed, then
it is that the virtuous Indignation of
that very virtuOus sheet is aroused,
and it publishes this article.





""Why is it that they single out
Judge Hawkins from the returning
board It was not Hawkins solely
and singly who had perpetrated this
immense injury of which you had
complained. If anybody did it. it was
the board that board was composed
of five individuals. I ask you, if you
put yourselves forward as champions
of public liberty and public interest,
and on that account claimed eXemp-
ton of damages for libellous article
which You have written, I ask you if
Won did that in the interest of the
public, why didn't you pitch into
Longstreet, Lynch, Bovee and Her.
ron? [ might suggest a reason. 1 will
let you guess at it. Some people, you
know, it don't do to trifie with""
In answer to this you pretend that
the Picayrne had repeatedly denounced
the returning board previous to your
article against Judge Hawkins, of the
2:}d of February, 1873. Now, sir,
was defending Judge Hawkins against
Il charge OF ''perfidy, ''perjury'' and
.'bribery"" in connection with his Ia
/ bors as member Of the retlu aing
! hoard, and I took occasion to tell the
| jury the Picayune had made no such
! charge against any other member of
| that board. I now reiterate my Ian
guage, and make You this proposition
If you can find and show me, in any
number of the Picayrne, the words
''perfidy, perjury, and bribery"" APP
piled to any other member of that
board, | shall publicly acknowledge
was wrong; if you cannot, you will
make the acknowledgment Of contra.
dieting your record.

General Howard and the Freed

ial to the Tribune says that the Secre ary OF
War has sent letter to the House, making
direct charges of fraud and malfeasance in of
6ce against Brig. General O. o. Howard, in
connection with his management of the freed
mems bureau. This letter was accompanied
by evidence from the records and accounts of
the late bureau. The Secretary says in the let
ter that the late commissioner Gen, Howard,
has been promptly informed of the absence of
important records, and of an apparent exhibit
nations and supplying the missing records
How far he has done this will appear by the
correspondence printed in the reports. In one
item, stated at $121 900, not accounted for, it
will be seen that the accounts cannot be pro-
duced and no attempt has been made to prove
what has become of them. Accounts covering
the amount in part are alleged to have existed,
but the disbursing officer, Geo. w. Hallock, has
stated that as they were not considered of much
importance they were not kept iu cases with
the other accounts. The said accounts have
disappeared, and it seems that neither the late
commissioner ncr the late discussing officer can
account for their disappearance. This item is
known as the RETAINED bounty fund"" As to
the misapplication of the public funds, the
records are in the evidence, and these irregu-
larities and violations Of the law seemingly
have had much to do with the confusion of the
records, their defective condition and almost

nominations; John A. Bingham, Minister
Plenipotentiary to Japan VIM. L. Scruggs of

An Unusual Attraction.


Representative Stephens of Georgia was lis
tened to with marked attention to-day while
addressing the House on the salary question.
Many members crowded near his seat Among
them were gathered Representatives who held
high military positions in in the rebel army.
The compliment of extending the time to Mon
day to which each member is limited, was
unanimously conferred upon Stephens, who
spoke leaning on his crutches and with his cap
on his head. Although feeble in body his voice,
though not as strong as it was thirteen years
ago. was remarkably clear, being distinctly
heard in ali parts of the hall,


Setting next to him was Mr.. Regan of Tex,
formerly member of the House and after
wards Postmaster General of the rebel govern
ment. While Regan was listening to Stephens
the Senate passed a bill relieving him of polit-
ical disabilities.


The SALARY.


The indications are that the House will pass
bill fixing the salary of members at about
$4,000 per year, with an allowance Of actual
travelling expenses."

Essex tho Seducer Of His Own Daughters. Under
Lock and Key-The Crime and Arrest
The Lecherous Beast Implorfng


His Wife to Save Him.",,"NEWPORT, r. l., Feb. Is, 1873.


The greatest excitement has prevailed In this
city to-day the arrest of Albert Ii. Essex, the
man who is alleged to have committed the crime
incest upon his daughters. The circumstances
are OF the most atrocious nature showing a depth
OF depravity scarcely to be credited in civilized
community. 1t appears from facts that have come
to light that the crime has been gong for long
time, two OF his daughters being among the VIC
TINS and it was only on his attempt to commit
the crime on third that he was exposed by his
wretched wife and daughters and subjected to
arrest. The two daughters alluded to are aged
respectively twenty-five and nineteen years; tho
one On whom the recent attempt was made was
aged about fifteen.


THE wIFB PowERLEss TO INTERFERE


II appears that the mans own wife has all along
been privy to this conduct the part Of her hus-
band. but was utterly pewerless TO prevent IT, be-
ing restrained from interference or exposure by
threats Of death from the innuman monster. Tho
threats reduced her to q mere skeleton. The
daughters likewise were Influenced in their COM
pliance by the same fear.


THE YOUNGER DAUGHTER SAVED.


1t was only when the attempt WAS made on the
younger sister that they resolved that rather than
that she should be ruined they would brave ALI
consequences to themselves and have the guilty
husband and father arrested.


THE MONSTER UNDER ARREST.


On being arrested he manifested no particular
surprise, and only inquired the cause Of his appYe-
hension, the only reply to which on hts part was
the exclamation OF ""Oh, my Cod"" He Is prop
erty holder in this city, and though man Of some
what uncOmmunicative disposition and mingling
but little with hiss fellow citizens, has never been
regarded by them as person OF criminal pr0clivi.
ties. He has always borne the appearance, hove
ever, Of man communing much with his
own thoughts. His family have been very
much respected by their neighbors and
acquaintance, and the community will sympathize
with them in the unfortunate and heartbreaking
circumstances with which they are surrounded
through this alleged depravity Of one who should
have been their protector.


COMFORTABLE HOME MADE MISERABLE.


The home of the family is situated on Broad
street. In one OF the most highly respectable neigh
borhoods, being furnished throughout with the
necessary wants Of a comfortable and happy home.
There was considerable talk here of riot, but the
feeling has somewhat abated and the family now
are resting in state Of security and peace of mind
that they have not left Tor over year.


Essex is man fifty years old, thick set and well
built, and weighing about two hundred pounds.


THE COWARD TREMBLEs BEFORE THE LAW


His wife visited him at the jail to-day. He
pleaded for her to withdraw the charges and save
his soul. His two daughters have been summoned
TO appear before the Court on Tuesday next


This morning the pitiful story spread with
rapidlty from lip to lip in various FORMS and there
is much public Indignation in consequence.


Late this evening large crowd had assembled
opposite the Jail with threats OF lynchng the
human wretch from his iron cage but the prompt
arrival OF the police, who succeeded In dispensing
the crowd was elrectual in restoring peace and

going the Fiery Ordeai-Ben and Kerr
Giving Each Other the Parliamentary
Lie.


The bill providing for the distribution of the
Geneva award came up again in the House to-day,
anu gave rise TO very animated and acrimonious
discussion. Butler received eficent aid in sd-
vocacy of his bill from Peters, Hale, Lynch and
Frye, OF Maine. Hale in particular made an able,
exhaustive speech the bill meeting oil the OBJ
tections Of its opponents; in fact the Maine
delegation were unit In favor Of
the measure, which excludes the insurance
companies from receiving any portion Of the
award save where they can prove an actual loss
sustained over and above the premiums received
for war risks. Considerable dissatisfaction was ex-
pressed on the democratic side OF the Hsuse at the
evident unfairness Of farming out the time to the
friends Of the bill, and giving no chance to It's
opponents to be heard on the subject Beck
and Kerr objected TO this procedure,
when general consent was given to
extend the time for calling the previous question.
William X. Roberts said that he preferred this
bill to any before the House, but thought that in
matter of such grave Importance IL should be post
poned so as to give more time for its c0nsid-
Grafton. Beck spoke strongly against the bill and
in favor OF paying the insurance companies.
He said the faith OF the nation was pledged to pay
them. Kerr also opposed it. and unquestionably
made the most skilfu and logical appeal in favor
OF the companies and Of referring the whole mat
ter to the courts voorhees, followed Kerr taking
opposite ground He believed the bloated and
cowardly companies, as he called them, had not a
claim upon the award or the country; that the
war to them was source of profit, and that in
stead OF losing they fattened upon our misfor-
tunes. He was against the further accre-
tiOns OF enormous wealth, but on the side of
the poor, who we're now powerfully represented In
the lobby. Butler closed the debate, and feeling
that Kerr's attack had somewhat injured the bill,
he pounced upon him in his unsparng. sarcastic
manner. He charged that Kerr got his insplra-
tion from William NJ Evarts the attorney of the
insurance companies, whom he accompanied to the
room of the Judiciary Committee, plainly insnu.
ating that Kerr was actuated by impure motives
Kerr rose, and deliberately exclaimed That's q
lie.n


Buffers face became scarlet, and he reiterated
his charge,


Kerr denied that he accompanied Evarts to the
committee room, saying that he went there by
courtesy OF the committee and found Evarts in
the room.


""Oh,"" said Butler, ""the lie, then, is in the eva
sion not in the assertion. Some men can't see
an honest thing when 1t Is before them""


""Yes retorted Kerr, 'and you are
one Of them;"" and saying this he
looked at Butler with wicked and sarcastic sneer
upon his countenance. which plainly said Come
on If you dare"" But Ben seemingly took no fur
ther notice OF him, and went to work defend his
bill. He showed that under it the sailor and the
poor man could prove his claims and receive
his dues without having to resort to expen-
sive lawsuits, where his means would be
swallowed up in lawyers fees. Butler was par
ucuarly severe on w. NJ. E@arts, whom he
charged with having used his influence upon
the floors Of Congress in the interest OF the In.
surance companies. He also declared that before
the United States employed Evarts to defend our
interests at Geneva he (Evarts) was employed by
the companies to press their Claims thus serving
two clients OF opposite interests.


1t was evident from the first that the insurance
companies had no chance OF succeeding in the
House. Various attempts we're made to amend
the bill by Clarkson, Potter, Leonard, Myers and
Others, but all failed and it finally passed, as re.
ported, by nearly two-thirds majority It now
goes to the Senate, where its tate is very uncer-
tan as there Is very strong lobby here in the in
terest OF the insurance companies, who WILL
doubtless spare no effort to amend or kill the BILL
as they are fighting for $4,00O,OOO. Its fate will,
undoubtedly be settled by conference committee

berry.


The lobby has sustained a Waterloo defeat to-
day, and many of them left by the mail trains this
evening in thoroughly routed and demoraized
condition. The resolution agreed upon by the
republican caucus did the work, and extinguished
the hopes OF each wirepulier, who had expected
to get his little job tackled on as amendment to
some appropriation bill which the public necessi.
ties demanded the passage Of, however it might
be loaded down with riders. The lobbyists were
all on hand and every scheme for depicting the
Treasury was represented. Mail steamer subsidies,
postal telegraphs, national shipyards, canals con-
Meeting the ocean with the lakes Washington
public works, railroad land grabs and a score OF
other jobs were each and all represented; but it
was Of no avail. They endeavored to promote
an opposition to the rule on the ground
that 1t would cut Off debate, but it
was in vain. majority of the republican Sena-
tors were pledged to each other to stand firm
against jobbery, and after much gable, it was de.
cded that all amendments not germane to appro-
priation bills could be laid directly on the table.
Unless there is square back down on the part OF
eight or ten republican Senators we may excaim,
""Goodby, jobs"" until next December, when the
lobbyists will have before them long
session to work in. The Senators had
hoped TO have finished the Naval Appropriation bill
this afternoon; but 1t was late before they could
get at work on it, and there was then series of
contests on amendments between the liberals, led
by CraQip. and the econnIuists hea adad IL,"

Grand Jury which convened at Tucson, recently, is contained in full in the Citizen of the llth inst Ot olev- CD complaints laid before them, they found five true bills, to wit: One for smuggling, three for grand larceny, and one for harbor ing deserters. One complaint for conspiracy and five for violation of the revenue laws were ignored.

 The complaint for conspiracy was in the case of Dr. R. A. Wilbur, wherein he was chafged with complicity in the recent diff culties with the Indians of the San Carlos reserve, and which finally resulted in the lamentable death of that excellent young officer Lieut.. Jacob Almy, of tue 9th Cavalry. lt was charged that the efforts of Dr. Wilbur were intended to effect the death of Major (. F. Larrabee, at that time agent at San Car los at the hands of the Indians. The Jury report contains lengthy paragraph upon the subject, and without adding any information not already familiar to the people, proceeds to shoulder the entire trouble upon Major Larrabee, charging him with moral and phys ical cowardice, with a lack of firmness and decision, and an ignorance of the duties de- volved upon him. In the minds of the peo- 1 pie of Arizona there is diversity of opinion as to the cause and origin of that sad affair, and since the Grand Jury has failed to reach an explanation. we can only revert to that great expounder which in due season presents all things in their proper light.

 The Territorial Grand Jury for that coun- ty assembled on the Sth and rendered their report on the lltb, after having found nine true bills, for various offenses, out of eleven complaints laid before them. The greater part of their report is taken up with the de- tails of their investigation of the lynching of the four murderers, in the village of Tucson, on the Sth of August last, and which contains but little in addition to the report of the ! Coroner's jury, published in the MINER at the time of the occurrence. The report is worthy of perusal by those who may be favored with an opportunity.

The Sisters have taken great interest in the school, and much credit is due to them.

 DIED SUDDENLY OF HEART DISEASE. - How common is the announcement. Thou sands are suddenly swept into eternity by this fatal malady. This disease generally has it's origin in impure blood, filled with irritating, poisonous materials, which, circulating through the heart, irritate its delicate tissues. Though the irritation may at first be slight, producing a little palpltatiOn or irregular action, yet by and by the disease becomes firmly seated, and inflammation, or hypertrophy, or thickening of the lining membrane, or of the valves, is produced. How wise to give early attention to case of this kind. Unnatural throbbing or pain in the re- zion of the heart should admonish one that all is not right, and if you would preserve it from further disease, you must help it to beat rightly by the use of such remedy as shall remove the cause of the trouble. Use Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discovery before the dis ease has become too seated, and it will, "" 4CS SIoIG O4OOu puIHJlHS aHu ""OHCscI- full regulating properties, effect perfect cure.

the most arduous labor, the catastrophe was
ayerted. The amount Of damage is estimated
at nearly $1,000.

The Flank Movement.


Yesterday Judge Rice appeared before the
Railroad Committee and desired to be heard on
the petition of the Maine Central for an extern
sion of time to complete its location from Por:-
land to Danyille, but was informed that Fri
day had been assigned, and Friday it must be.
The opinion seems to be that the P. S. & P. and
Maine Central desire to locate union depot
under their two bills. A prominent member of
the Railroad Committee is of the opinion that
this extension of time to locate is the flank
movement Of the Maine Central managers,
and that they hope, TO prevent the Portland and
Bath Company from entering the city by pre-
viously locating on the best route

make the tour OF Wards Island. Yesterday was
set apart for such VISIT and early in the morning
the Quarantine COMMISSIONER steamboat N. K.
Hasskins was at the wharf at Castle Garden TO re-
ceive on board such persons as were invited to be
present. Those assembled for the purpose
were President Hurlbut George Starr, James
Lynch Superintendent Webster ana Secretary
Jackson, of the Emigration Commission; Dr.. s. 0.
vanderpoei Health Onicer OF the Port; Senator
elect John A. King, Assemblyman and Assembly

Pinckney and Others Before embarklng the gen.
tlemen walked around Castle Garden, narrowly
scanning every nook and corner or the huge struc-
ture and making such inquiries as were pertinent
TO the object In view.


II did not require but little time to reach Wards
Island, and upon arrival, the visitors were es-
c0rted to the several buildings and hospitals, all
of which received such attention as the occasion
demanded. Everything was found in complete or
der, and the many patients that were able to be
about looked very cheerful and contented. In
this tour 1t ascertained that the object OF the
commission was to impress upon the visitors, not
only the importance OF the work under it's care,
but that to render it as effective as the citizens
of New York desired it to be, there should
be in the hands OF the officials sufi-
cent money for the proper maintenance
OF the several institutions. This was not the case
now. and the commission is In debt over $5000O,
and has been since the Legislature reduced tho
s.head money! collected from the various steamship
companies from 81 90 to 81 so per capita. 1t was
now sought to ask that this tax be raised from the
present sum to 81 when the commission could
make the necessary repairs now urgently de-
manded, and, with the economy always practised.
meet their expenses without falling behind. Two
hours were passed in the inspection, when the

NV DEAR SIR: THANK you for your Kind ex-
pressions. We have no reason to be demoral-
lied. We are beaten, but we fought the battle
on principle; and, though overthrown, our cause
cannot be destroyed. Up to my speaking at
Leesburg, on the 2oth October, was In high
confidence OF carrying tho state. But | OBJ
served, after that date, in speaking to the peo-
pie, marked change 10 the popular feeling.
The Conservatives had succeeded at last In get
ting up silly scare about ''ncsro supremacy
and hal the masses In a stampede. They them
selves had been In n bad fright about losing the
state, and had called upon their moneyed fiiends
for help. Aid In money had been literally sup
piled, aud then thorough system OF local can
vassng was set on foot tremendous outcry
raised over the danger OF ""negro rulc,r and the
most active steps taken to thoroughly alarm the
popular fears. Under the influence OF this sys-
iematic outcry, and OF thorough local canvass
ing, the popular feeling was changed; and, In
stead Of our conqnering victory, we were over
prised at the vote against us than our aiyersP
| RES are, who are greatly amused at the success
OF the trick which they played npon credulous
people.


No man receives the result with more equa-
nimity than myself I bow with loyal subinis.
sion to the VIII Of the people. They always
| mean to be right; they meant 50 this time, and
though, under the influence Of q iidiculous pane,
| they have voted against me, I concede their
| honesty OF purpose, aud submit loyally and rev.
erently to their verdict. II were TO lose my
| faith in the peoplc-in their patriotism, their
| honesty and their capacity Of right judgment
| upon political qsestions-1 should cease TO have
| any rational politics, and would be. without rud-
| der commas. ntrlft tie of
pol ties, subject TO be driven before every wind
OF expediency.


ASA DEMOCRAT or TuE oLpHs TINE,


I have faith In the people, In the destiny of the
Republic and In the success Of free institutions.
| IL the people at any time, In frenzy OF alarm
| or IN calmer misjudgment, go counter TO the


right, still trust IN them, and, relying upon the


sober secord thought, am ready again to do hat
tie for the right until II triumphs.


In looking back over the field Of the last can

own course to regret, and cci tainy have hal no

poor man, woman and child In the State,
white oolorod, that the Conservatives, on
such slight proyocatlon, instantly and with
such great unanlmity, array themselves IN
opposition to the discussion Of this question.
It Is their boast that they have adopted the
progressive and civilized ideas Of the
North, and have established successful
tree-school system for the benefit Of the
poorer classes. II these be true, why do
they object to discussion Of the merits
Of their systeml But II Is not true, as we
have repeatedly proven by statistics obtained
from trustworthy and official sources. The
desire to keep the people ignorant on this
subject Is the motive Of their present attl
tude. We Insist that our friends Of the Re-
publican party In Virginia shall pay heed to
this fact and proceed to expose the false
hoods Of their opponents. Such an exposure
will do them no harm, for they have not had
the management Of the State administration,
and, while II may be disgrace to the Com
monwealth, 1t will prove that the Conserva-
tiyes never have done and never will do any
thing honorably and conscientlously for the
education Of the masses. This Is more i'm
portant question, so far as the true interests
Of the State are concerned, than anything
pertaining to railroad interests or tlde-water
navigation. The intelligence OF the people
once established, such internal Improvements
follow as a natural consequence. Now that
the Conservatives have made record against

The shooting Of Lockwood night before last by
Magruder was subject of very general conye,sa.
ton throughout the city yesterday. The Orime
was 80 unprovoxed and the bearing OF the mur-
derer marked by SO much reckless unconcern that
staid conservative people were stirred into Ian
guage OF angry Indignation, and hints of vigilance
committees, lynch law and the like were freely M
dulged in. The news OF tie decision by the Court
OF Appeals rendering the doom Of Foster
inevitable, seemed to reassure the public
that some vindicaton OF justice would soon
be made. AS for Mag uder's crime, no one could
see what possible palllation can be advanced in
his favor. Insanity iuebrety, reasonable sense OF
inJury-none OF these can plead in behalf OF this
homicide; and II Magruder thinks his respectable
connection will save him from the penalty he has
incurred he leans upon broken reed.

feature that indicated the desperate character evi
denced by his crime. His eyes were somewhat
sunken, and the black circles around them might
be attributed either to the habitual dissipation
OF his life or to night made sleepless by thoughts
to indicate the latter cause, as his manner and
matter of speech evinced GOODNESS that the most
casual commentator on such deed could scarcely
have attained. When asked If he desired to make
any statement concerning the affair, he said that
ne believed he did not just then The lact was he
about it. In reply to questions about mis- history,
he stated that he was born in the neigabOr.
hood OF Lynchburg, Va, and had been resident in
same family as General J. B. Magruder, the Con.
federate leader. Having given these answers he
turned to the rOundsman and asked ""if anything
more had been heard about that -"" Jerking his
head to indicate the victim. The roundsman Could
give him no news, and told him SO, adding ""He'
may get over it."" 81 hope he may"" rejOined the
prisoner, In a tone devoid OF feeling and arpre
henson as If he had no possible interest in the
suit. He then inquired how long he would have to
stay where he was. The rOundsman stated Pre- badly
until the result OF the injuries could be KNOWN un.
less they wanted the victim to identify him. ''There
is no use OF that"" said the prisoner, with some
animation. 'The shooting is admitted. Outsiders
may not think as do, but feel justified in shoot.
ing him. He slapped me in the face and then with
theatrical air told me to get satisfaction. told
him that would; to go fixed, as would shoot him

curve, and that no place upon . grade greater
than eight feet all the way upon a slight en-
bankment, no cuts, no bridge, one culyert. l
take it that irst-clAss road could be built there
In this day st an average cost OF Sl2, 500 per
mile, ready for an equipment.


The object In that day was to establish
more direct coast line route betweeR New York
and the South, via Norfolk, crossing the Della
ware near the Breakwater by ferry and by fer
ry from Cape Charles TO Norfolk Philadelphia,
in that time, manifested some interest in this
enterprise, looking then to Norfolk as her port
OF entry, and to some extent perhaps on this
account the Eastern Shore road, 80 called, was
more rapidly pushed down the Peninsula.


The construction Of this road from Cape
Charles, or Cherrystone. to connect with the
road already built from Philadelphia, could not
fail. as you suppose, to stimulate the cultiya-
ton OF fruits and vegetables on the Eastern
Shore counties, and would create, doubtless, 9
large traffic in oysters and fish, for northern
markets.


The saving of anything like eight or nine
hours between Norfolk, Philadelphia and New
York over the Bay route, would attract large
travel. not 30 much for the bay, for that route
is taken mainly for Baltimore, but from that
route known a. the coast, via Washington, Rich
mond and Weldon and it would laFaw from our
A. N. & o. r. r., converging at Norfolk, which
now leaves it at Lynchburg for PhilAdelphiA and
Norfolk.


should not suppose that the people of the
Eastern Shore would hesitate to give the right
Of way for the construction Of this road and they
could we'll afford, it seems to me, to subscribe
else, 600 to its capital stock, especially il the
payments were continued to be made upon the
completion of the work.


Our company would look upon such Inns, ,oon-
nected with it by reliable steam ferry service
with the most friendly interest. You're, &c,

Mr.. voorhees, said he had been amused at the

INF. Beckl lie had objected to amendments
originating In the Senate, and had said that Jobs
were put In there. lie (Mr. w had supposed
was glad to md that the House was so pure and
upright, that the JObbers and Bchemers went to

reasoning that because a bill originated IN one

with charges that he felt suspicious OF the

OF this District, and had examined with hls own

been said that there was squAndering and mis-
use OF public money, but every witness who
came before the committee dlsayOwed any such

Washington was mud-hOe. II the capital was
to remain here, the capital OF a nation OF forty

tlOn to the money being Appropriated, even II
the measure did originate 10 the Senate. Mr.

In the House, and II was q bad sign to see these
schemes originating there and coming here at
the last hour: Of the session. Mr. Roosevelt, OF

Board OF Public Works three and half millions
from the Government, while the report sent by
them showed an expenditure OF but seven mii-
lions, and that but four weeks ago, In reply
10 note sent to the board by the District Com

was required TO complete contemplated improve

to improve the District, but thought some pro-
lection SHOULD be afforded the poor man whose

He grew bolder; and one night (the third June box, think, the door opening close upon our knock, he dashed out into the road, yelled, and ran off in full view of his eager pursuers. We heard him go down the road 8 full pound, with spiteful pit-pat of girls shoes hard be- hind.

 Very possibly he might have escaped then but, coming where the unfenced common skirted the road, he assayed to tack off across it. Here 8 treacherous stone-hole masked by high brakes and blueberry- bushes received him all in heap. The next moment the pretty Philistines were upon him. A peal of triumphant laughter from the common told us the rest for Tom and I, mean while, had hurried off back of the house, past the old cider-mill, and plunged into the thicket of balm-o' -gilead sprouts which had sprung up about the trunk of the old tree. Throwing our selves full length under this green cop pice, we lay quiet. The twilight had not quite faded out in the northwest in the east the rim of the late-rising moon was just peeping over it bright ened as Hod's captors came back with him. Every few steps there would be tussel the prisoner seemed good deal inclined to resist. Then followed by an invariable ""No you don't, sir p

 ""Now, don't hold fellow so P we could hear Hod remonstrating. Then exhort him to come along, telling him how ungallant it was to run away from young ladies. ""Now, don't tear your self away See us home, do We've got something pretty to show you something you'll like i'' etc.

 On they came past the house, and made straight for the cider-mill; then we heard the boards rattle and the old wooden screws squeak. Secretly tick led, and not little curious, Tom and I got our heads up and peeped out from amongst the sprouts.

 ""Now, what's the use p Hod was pleading. 'I say, you girls, what are ye going to do to feller p

 Then came prolonged scrimmage. Round they went, all over the back yard. Hod was making 8 desperate effort to get away. No use; they held on to him and brought him under the high posts of the press again, all pant ing.

 ""I'll be blamed"" whispered Tom, eff they hain't got him up on the bench where the pummy-hoop is p

 Then came another struggle and clat- ter. 'tNow-now-now, please don't p ejaculated Hod. But the wicked sprites only laughed the louder.

 ""There p muttered Tom, eff they the follower down on to him Good gracious, Kit l l believe they're going to squeeze him They're turning the screws p

 We began to be little alarmed for Hod. Not that we thought they would s'squash him up"" knowingly; but they girls sometimes lack discretion.

 Creak-creok-squeak! We could see Cad and Jess turning the levers to

 

 follower. Lucreesh and Lorette were holding the follower over him.

 70, you'll make a splendid cheese p they were saying.

 Idon't think Hod fairly divined their intentions until the follower began to press him. Then he squirmed in good earnest but they had him hard and fast.

 ""Now, boy,"" says Cad, ""what was you at our door for?"" candidly.

 70, you was Who was it with you p.

 ""I don't want to tell that,"" said Hod, honorably.

 ""Don't you?"" Creak-squeak.

 ""Oh p Creok-sQueak. ""Oh - Tom Edwards--Oh-h {! and Kit

 They eased up, laughing as only such mischievous pack can.

 Where did Tom and Kit run to ?''

 ""I don't know"" said Hod and really he did not know.

 ""Try and think"" says Jess. C'eak -squeak.

 ''I honestly don't knowT vociferated Hod. Squeok-creaE. ooh !-up the road. Oh-h lover into the wood. Oh oh p

 ""Yes-yes from New York I'm Hod p

 'Hod is droll name; what does it stand for? ?'' Islands for Horace"" ''Horace, what else ?""

 'Horace Melcher."" ""Any middle name ?"" Hod hesitated. He was then very sensitive about his second name, New York folks were laughing so much at his great namesake.

 Come, what's your middle name ?"" questioned Cad.

 ""My middle initials G."" repliedHod, trying to compromise it. ""Well, but what does that G stand 1 for ?"" .-..

 No answer. Creak-squeak-ereak. ""Oh, nowl' Creak-creak. ooh 1! Greeley - oh !-Horace Greeley eh-h P

 Then they eased up to laugh over him, and says Lucreesh, ""How much is your father worth, Horace Greeley?""

 ""Nothing p exclaimed Hod, irritated at the sound of his full name.

 We heard the screws going, and Hod very quickly arrived at different fig ures ''Oh !Lforty thousand dollars oh p he roared out.

 Yesterday they tore down the old oider-min at the Lynches'. Its place, or rather its office, is to be taken by 8 little cast-iron one set in the stable.

 Odd enough 1t will seem to go past the Lynch farm now, and miss the old mill, for 1t was very conspicuous ob- ject where it stood, three or four rods back from the house, with its great hopper and mash-wheel encircled by the deep-trodden path where old Sib used to plod endlessly through the brisk October days, grinding all the cider apples of the neighborhood. And there were the great posts and cross beam of the press, massive pine tim bers, eighteen inches square, that had 8 certain Cyclopean look, fit to make 8 boy stare, and put large ideas into his head. There, too, were the big, steam ing heaps of tan-colored ""pummy (pomace), and the great sour smelling trough into which the ground apple fell and was thence conveyed to the hoops.

 For several seasons, however, the huge wooden jack-screws have been out of the lofty cross-beam, and the mash wheel has grown toothless. Indeed, the old mill has never been quite itself since the Maine (Liquor) Law made a revolution in the neighborhood. But the great pine posts stood fast, and bade fair to do so for another half cen- tury, to the wonder of strangers.

 ""Say, old fellow! is that the gal lows ?"" passing ""runner demanded of Uncle Billy Gives, who, one day, sat nodding under the balm-o'- -Gilead, a little beyond.

 Now, Uncle Billy has always been a steady consumer of the beverage of which the old mill may be considered a shrine. and was even at that moment little under the potency of its influence.

 ""Gallus p quoth the old fellow. Wal, fust an larst it's sarved me a sight wuss than gallus cud 'a',,done.""

 It may be remarked that Uncle Billy stoutly denies this confession in his sober moments. It is only when ""half seas over"" that he frankly owns how sadly drink has ruined him.

 But at present my story relates to the last years of the,old mills active career, during which it was at certain seasons put to special, but less legitimate use, the precise nature of which long re- mained mystery. This was when the Lynch girls, then verging toward young womanhood, were all at home,-Lu- creesh, Cad, Jess, and Lorette, a merry lot, rosy, and ''full of the old cat""

 We had custom in that neighbor- hood-a custom not confined to that neighborhooa, may add-of hanging May-baskets, a sort of paper valentine, made basket-form to hold more sub stantial tokens than mere poetry; but, as the writer has already described this custom in former number, nothing need here be said concerning it, further than that the hanging part was gener- ally followed by 8 hot pursuit of the hanging parties, who, if caught, were subject to no end of laughable igno- miny. The Lynch girls, swift of foot as Diana herself, sometimes captured the lads who ventured to append favors to their door; and then came the droll part, the part which has to do with the old cider-mill.' Whenever they had caught any of the boys, there would be plenty of exultant OoaODoaO while they took him back to where the old mill stood, then extravagant ejaculations, often ye1ls of genuine distress, and no end of humble begging. The girls did something to him there at the old cider mill. What it was, whether they stuff ed his mouth with ''pummy,"" or pinch ed his toes in the mash-wheel, was not very clear to the other lads. And of the three or four boys they had thus misused, not one could be got to tell what the girls had done to him,-it was something he didn't like to talk about a Now, will wager that some one of my readers is saying that he should just like to see the four girls that could hustle him back to that mill and stuff his mouth with ground applet We'll, sir, I should just like to see how you would go to work to help yourself, with four girls all laughing and pulling at you. What would you do? Double up your fist? An, but you know that it's morally impossible to hit one of the soft. calico. ey things,-after you've doubled it! It's about the best way to let 'em work, and bear it all with your best grin. .-. ..g...

 This sort of thing had been going on for two springs, when, late in May, a cousin (some degrees removed) of the writer's came on from New York, where his father resides to make us all a visit, and stay through the summer. His name, as he wrote it, was Horace G. Me1cher, the G standing for the late great editor; but we knew him as ""Hod simply. Iwonder whether MT. Greeley's early playfellows used to call him Hod

the villages around, all anxious to hear anything
new that might have developed itself on Sunday.
This fact o. restrained curiosity is an evidence OF
the great gOdiness Of the inhabitants here They
sta, ed ut home yesterday and read their Bibles.
While phantOms of the murdered man and misty

were visited by people from sweet Hollow, Cold

VINO exchanged Opinions with Huntingtonians on
the allabsorbng sensation While in the village this
morning had conveis sations with several OF the
people from these places and, rom all accounts,
the excitement is the most violent that has ever
convused this community. From sweet Hollow, or
Melville, as 1t is now called, there comes a story
which may have great influence on the actions or
the people In other townships give


THE STORY


for what 1t Is worth. At one OF the houses In Mel
vile party were collected last night, and very
naturally the story of the inquest was retod with
additions and cOloring. The sentiment, or rather
belef, was divided on the subject OF the genuine
ness of the corpse and the completeness OF the
identity. The debate warmed, and with
great earnestness on both Sides the major part OF
the crowd being in favor Of the belief that the
remains were none other than those OF Charles
Kelsey. The minority, discovering that 1t was
less and might become dangerous to urge their
Impressions further, judiciously withdrew, leaving
their excited friends an easy victory. Things
cooled on, and, having nothing else TO do the
victors of debate fell to exchanging opinions to
the probability OF the murder being clearly
traced to the perpetrators The general
opinion was that those indicted for the tar
ndeather outrage were the guilty persons. More
discussion and exchange OF opinion matured the
tdant hot thav ynnis In haI
bail was so light that they could conveniently afford
to forfeit II and escape the law.


OUTRAGED AT THE IDEA


OF such denouement OF the great case, they hur
riediy resolved to take Judge Lynch as court and
Banks and settle the whole by lynching them.
IL Is said they actually started on this headlOng
MISSION and sought recruits; but, happily cool per-
suasion prevailed and, under IT'S moderating innu-
ence, the at empt was abandoned.


This news created immense excitement here this
morning, ana many OF the people who are violently
earnest in the case look on the failure of the eX-
petition as great calamity

whom the preliminary investigation was neld last
December, learned a lew particulars IN reference

The feeling in Queens county, especially in the
town OF jamaica, at the brutal murder Of Philip
Reid howard on Sunday last by TWO pot hunters,

daily against the perpetrators OF the outrage. So
strong, indeed, Is the feeling that it was deemed
necessary on Monday evening to convey the prison
ers Gilligan and Lennon, to the County Jail at
North Hampstead, where strong guard was
placed over them. On Monday evening a
large crowd Of men gathered about the
Town Hall, Jamaica, and, from their con-
versaton, 1t soon became evident that they
were drawn there from other motives than curl
ostty and until assured by the Justice and others
that the prisoners had been removed refused to

Ggan replied that we were not on his prem

We are in favor of u republican form Of

ing person or class, no matte. OF what
political shade or conviction, can sustain
them in the gross violation sf the rights
Of the people, and their leckless and in.
tolerant course. We consider the or
ganizatisu Of the Senate and House as
revolutionary. Senators, notorisusly
elected, have been displaced, and those
defeated put in their places. Members
OF the Legislature, returned by both
Boards, have been ignored, and their
places filled by defeated candidates. Pro
scriptivs legislation has been rushed hur.
riedly through. Proclamations have
been made inhibiting peaceful assemblies
OF citizens by an Executive who holds
his Office without color or right Of law,
and the popular will has been 50 dsfsd
and outraged that We feel We cannot
longer act with that body, or support an
Executive who, for party ends, would
sink every vestige Of liberty in its final
grave The QUESTION as to who consti
tutss the legal returning Board is subor
dinate to the question Of what are the re
turns; but the returns show for them
selves We ascertain that Lynch, Haw
kins, Longstreet and Heron entered into
a conspiracy to declare Mr., Heron and
his ticket elected, and that they did 80
without having the official returns Of the
election; they admit that their action
was based on data, memoranda and afil
davits entirely unknown to law, and

Special Correspondence Of the Commercial


GEORGETOWN, DEL, March 25.


Yesterday morning,a man known by the name
Of Joe Burton"" committed an outrageous
assault upon young white girl, named Lank
near Rehoboth station, on the Junction q Break
water Railroad. "" Joe was raised by ESQ.
Burton OF this place, and had left here, some
two weeks ago, to visit his mother who lives
near Rehoboth. Intending to return to George
town, he went to the Station, at the former
place, but had not money enough to buy ticket
and while in the store, there, Miss Lank came to
the store, on business While she remained Joe
left, and secreted himself in the thicket, in the
way she had to return, about one-fourth Of a
mile from the store, and awaited her RETURN
when he committed the brutal act.


The struggle of resistance made by the young
lady terrible, as the marks ON the road in the
mud would indicate, and her clothing was litter
ally torn into shreds. After she escaped from
III n she reached home, little distance of, when
the alarm was given and the neighborhood ar
oused. The woods in which the act was commit
ted was surrounded and searched and the cul.
prit taken and brought to Georgetown, last eve
ming, by Mr. John Marshall, of Lewes, who was
the prominent one in his arrest. He was well
secured in fetters in the same cell from which
the notorious Goldsborough escaped. We
judge from the kind of irons with
which he is bound down there is but lit
tie chance OF his escape. As the Court will meet
in three weeks. he will receive his doom. He
manifests perfect indifference. When surroun-
ded in the woods, he was gathering hickory nuts
and inquired who they were looking after and
feigned surprise that 1t was him. He said that
he had seen the girl in the store but that was all
he knew about her. He is large, good looking
young colored man, but we understand has been
considered rather""a hard case""


Tue young lady s the daughter Of John Lank,
who was former keeper of the Light House,
and is very respectable and handsome young
girl, OF 15 or 10 years of age She Is inia criti-
cal condition, and her fright and grief are such
that there are fears OF her recovery.


The community are greatly incen sed, and it
was with difficulty that those having the pcoun-
drel in charge could prevent his being lynched."

first of these questions the Committee will make q

facts as they have been brought out
In the inquiry. These facts that the
Lynch Returning Board which gave certificates

legal from the parishes which 10 base their
conclusions, and its proceedings therefore void
The WarmOth Board the other hand, was illegal In


its constitution though had the regular returns from
the parishes Neither set of electors therefore, be
said 10 be legally returned II the Committee recon-


mend any action 1t will probably be similar to that taken
years ago in regard TO the OF Georgia On that
occasion the following preamble and resolution were
passed


Whereas The question whether the state of Georgia
has become and is entitled TO representation IN the two
houses Of Congress is now pending and undetermined
and


Whereas BY the Joint resolution of Congress passed
July 90 1865 entitled ""a resolution excluding from the
Electoral College votes of States lately in rebellion
which shall not have been reOrganized was provided
that electoral votes from any OF the States lately IN
rebellion should be received counted for President or
Vice President of the United States until among other
things such State should have become entitled TO repre-
senaton in Congress pursuant TO acts OF Congress IN
that behalf therefore


ReSOpcd, BY the Senate the House OF Representatives
cOncurrng that on the assembling OF the Two houses on
the second Wednesday of February 1862 for the counting
of the electoral votes for President and
provided by law and the JOINT rules of the counting or

lie presented Of the State OF Georgia. shall not essen


TALLY change the result in that case They snail be re-
ported by President OF the Senate in the following
Were the votes presented as or the state OF
Georgia, to be counted the result would be, for
President of the United States, votes; If not counted
for - President of the United States, voJes but in
either - is elected President of the United States
and in the same manner for Vice-President.


Additional testimony will be taken on the other
branches of the inquiry and no report will be made for
a week but that Of tomorrow will foreshsdow the
character Of that which is follow In the Senatorial
contest the Committee will probably find that neither
body now claiming be the Legislature is legally con-
sttuted and therefore that neither Ray nor Mcmillan is
entitled to the seat. The Committee find however that
Legislature legally chosen, but that its mem
bers are divided between the two irregular
bodies Hew 10 get the lawful Legislature to-
gether is a troublesome matter. The question
as to the expediency of q republican form Of govern
ment in the State will be difficult for the Commit
tee decide than either OF the others If IL should be
found that no Governor has been chosen according
the Constitution AMI laws Of the State then the people
would have TO go back TO the beginning, and as the
Constitution provides that the Governor shall hold
office until his successor chosen, Mr.. Warmoth would
return to the Executive chair, the articles
Of impeachment against him, on account Of
which he was deposed, having been dismissed
by the Senate. He might then call together
the Legislature which was legally chosen and that body
could if so disposed up the remainder Of the mud
die. An important question has already arisen as 10
Kellogg Legislature to he illegally constituted
II President should continue to sustain IT, serious
conflict between the Executive and Legislative branches
would arise If he withdrew the military protection the
people would disperse the body at once."

Col. Moore was not opposed TO the study OF the
languages in our schools, but thought that some |
more practical laneuago-0erman or French
should be introduced, instead Of Latin.
Mr.. McAllister moved to amend the resolution

after the word ""IAatn.""


Col Hesler thought they were carrying the
matter a little too far. The English language is
and always will be the universal commercial Lam

i Correct understanding Of the English language.

CITING DEBATE.",,"THE COMMISSIONERS OF EMIGRATIoN-AN Ex-


CITING DEBATE.


The Commissioners of Emigration held
stormy debate, yesterday. at Castle Garden. long
discussion arose out Of the presentation OF the opinion
OF the counsel OF the Commission WIN. s. Hllyer, re-
gardng the erection OF n church for the exclusive use OF
one religious denomination This opinion given at great
length held that the act creating the Board did not give
the Commissioners the rig4 or privilege TO use any
moneys for the erection @ building Tor the
exclusive use Of any particular sect or denomina-
ton. IL was generally claimed that this opinion
was rendered prior TO the last meeting
Of the Board but that rs 1t had been placed IN the
keeping Of one Commissioner. he had withheld 1t until
he had obtained contrary opinion from Judge Porter
Both documents we're laid before the Board yesterday
and Commissioner Walach introduced seres OF reso-
utiOns declaring that proper arrangemensf were bot
provded for the education those emgrants who de
learn least the rudments OF the Engnsh IAN
guaee and asking that the emgrants be afforded better
facilities for writing letters The resolution however
which met with the most violent opposition was sna'
asking that the building under construction be
used as place of public worship for all denominations
Messrs O'GormaD, Lynch, Nicholson, and Hartt az
once assumed the defensive, and offered most
determined opposition TO the resolutions. Commission
ers wallach Kaufman, Woltman, and Forest warmly
supported them. Mr. Hart apparently In favor OF the
resolutions desired more time TO consider them, and
Il
Island Committee. Mr. Kaufman opposed TINS, as u
evidently left him. as member Of that committee IN
the minority. The motion defeated after the Yeas
and NAYS had called. Then followed resolution
from Mr. Lynch table the resolution, which, afer


final calling names met the same fate US the pre-
viOus one.


II was noticed that in each Of these votes which
clearly developed the strength OF each side on the nai
ballot four Commissioners stood for aud four against
the resolutions In each instance however, the motion
was declared lost asserted that this was to Gre
ate precedent, that the final ballot tic vote
could be declared as the defeat OF the resolutions
whether there was truth in these rumors when
were current in the room or not, certain u
is that such was the fate Of the resolutions IL
was in vain that Commissioner Kaufman pointed out
the impossbty of erecting separate chapel for Meth
odists Presbyteuans, Baptsts, Episcopalians, cove
nanters Campbellites, Lutherans, Quakers aud Nor
MONS and declared that the apportonment OF $4,000 for
the purpose Of erecting churchOr sect of Chris
tians was neither equitable nor just The Yeas and
Nays were called and standing for and against, the
resolutions were declared lost.


The opinion OF the Commissioners counsel and the
will OF -four Commissioners were quietly ignored"

 Victims.

The Thieves and Murderers arrested and

 hung by the Citizens.",,"SliSfH p' hhN SNh Hlsts, Wt ktN hhV HafliCu- lars of the brutal murder of Vicente Herman dez and wife, August 1th. The entire history of the affair would be interesting to our read CTS, but want of space confines us to brief statement of the principal points.

 Vicente Hernandez, better known ss Pie dras Negras, was a pawnbroker and mer. chant, who came from New Mexico to Ar- zona, and had been living on Convent street, Tucson, where he was doing prosperous business Sometime in the night of Wednes- day, the 7th inst, the house was entered and Hernandez and wife were murdered in their bed. Investigation showed that they had been killed by the use of clubs and knives-probably first stunned with clubs and then their throats cut. After the mur- der the house and store were plundered of money, jewelry, firearms and merchandise. The fact that Mrs. II. was some months ad- vsnced in pregnancy added to the horror felt by the citizens when the murders were dis covered.

 On Thursday rewards were offered amount ing to 800, raised by subscription among the citizens, for the apprehension of the mur- derers, and at o'clk that night six men had been arrested and lodged in jail on suspicion Two of the party confessed and made state ments of all the particulars of the horrible crimes committed, showing that three Mexi. cans named LeocardO Cordova, Clemente Lo- | peg and Jesus Saguaripa were the perpetrs- tors. The funeral of their victims was held Friday morning, all the principal places of business being closed and the citizens attend. ing the ceremonies in body. After the iu- neral all proceeded to the court house plaza where rude gallows had been erected from which four ropes were dangling with nooses at one end. The jail was opened, the three Mexicans and a convicted murderer named John Willis, were brought out and hanged in front of the court house door, at ll:30 am, after which the crowd quietly dispersed. A coroner's inquest was at once held, the result of which we give as it appeared in the Citizen

 In the matter of the inquisition upon the bod. les of John Willis, Leocardo Cordova, Clemente Lopez and Jesus Saguarpa, deceased

 We :be undersigned, the jurors summoned to ap- pear before solomon Warner, the coroner Of the county of Pima, at Tucson, on the sth day of Au. gust, 1s73 to inquire into the cause of the death of John Willis, Leocardo Cordoya, Clemente Lo- peg, and Jesus saguaripa, having been duly sworn according 10 law, and having made such inquisi. ton, upon our oaths, each aud all do say that we ind that the said John Willis, Leocardo Cordova, Clemente Lopez and Jesus Saguaripa came to their deaths on the Sth day of August, lS73 al about II go m., in the Court house plaza, in the town of Tucson, by hanging; and we further find that the said hanging was committed by the peo' pie of town of Tucson, CD masse and we do fur ther say that in view of the. terrible and bloody

 murders that had been committed by the three

 MexicaBs above named, and the tardlpess witt which justice was being meted out 10 John VII He, murderer, that the extreme measures taken by our felow-citiZens this morning in yindication Of their lives. their property and the peace and good order of society, while it is 10 be regretted and deplored that such extreme measures were necessary, seems to the jury 10 have been the in evitable results of allowing criminals to escape the penalties oftheir crimes.

 All of which duly certify by this inquistion

 1873

 J. $. Mansfield, foreman; Wm. Ohnesorgen Fred Bland, Thos. Driscoll, R. \. LeAtherwood

 Willis killed Robt. Swope in Sanford, Nov

 20, 1872, was tried and found guilty of mur der in the first degree, May ""A, 1873, auC , sentenced to be hanged some day not named by the Judge. His case was appealed to tn,

 Supreme Court which would meet in January

 1874.

 As the March term of court resulted il turning loose upon the public well knowl |, murderer named Dorman, and John Burt

 ~ho killed one Marianda, in Tucson, last

 Christmas, it appears that the citizens of tha

 place concluded that while they had thei hands m they would finish the Willis cas- , in Judge Lynch's court.

 In the accounts of the tragedy we have re

Tho Murderer Captured by Citizens and

 Summarily LyMched.

 Full particulars of the double murder in Aroostook county received at Bangor show it. to be one of the most cold blooded and brutal crimes ever com mitted in Maine, and it causes great ex- citement throughout the county in which it occurred. It seems that one James Cullen, a native of New Bruns- wick, broke into D. Dudley's store, in Presque Isle, and stole pair of boots and several other small articles. The crime was traced to Cullen, who took to the woods, and warrant was issued for his arrest, which Granville A. Hayden, of Presque Isle, Deputy Sheriff, under took to serve.

 Knowing Cullen to be hard charac- ter, Hayden took three men with him and started in pursuit. They came up with Cullen in Chapman plantation, about four miles from Presque Isle, and seeing that resistance was useless, he surrendered himself. They started to return, but, night coming on, concluded to remain till morning in numbering camp, where, as they supposed, they had securely fastened their prisoner, and went to sleep. During the night Cullen managed to loose his bonds, and, find ing an axe in camp, crept stealthily be- hind Hayden and one of his assistants named Thomas Hubbard, and dashed their brains out with the implement. Swanbeck and Bird, the other men with the Sheriff, were awakened by the noise, and, on seeing Cullen at his murderous work, were so mortified that they sprung up and, being near the door, made their escape, leaving their companions to their fate. Cullen chased them some distance, brandishing the axe, but they, being unarmed, ran only the faster. Upon reaching the settlements they gave the alarm, and party, led by Mir. B. J. Hughes, started from Balls Mill and went to the lumber camp, only to find a mass of smoking ashes covering the charred bodies of Cullen's victims. The discovery created the most intense ex- citement and indignation throughout the community, and parties started ln pursuit of the murderer.

 Cullen was found secreted in the eel lar of his house at Mapleton, town ad- joining Presque Isle, and the party who arrested him bound him securely with ropes and started to return. On their way to Presque Isle they were met by party from that village, who took possession of the prisoner, dragged him under a lofty tree, put one end of arope they had brought around his neck, and throwing the other end over conve' nient branch, hung him. No steps have been taknn to bring to justice the lynching party. MT. Hayden was wide ly known and much respected. He leaves @ wife and one child. Hubbard was unmarried. Cullen had lived il Mapleton about two years, and has borne hard name. He leaves wife and one child."

The defeat of the Webb Australian Steamship

heretofore brought before Congress looking TO
the revival of our commerce, evidences an
indispositon to resort to mere temporary expe-

lrawbacks-to remedy the ills under which we
labor. The bill of the International Steamship
Company, unanimously reported from the Sen
ate Naval Committee, goes TO the very founda-
ton of the trouble. 1t proposes the creation OF
an iron ship building yard with docks, blast and
refining furnaces, rolling mills and work shops
by which ores can be converted into superior
ron, so that everything that enters into the con-
structon of iron or wooden vessels or on-clnd
hulls, engines, spars, rigging etc, can be made
ON the spot so cheaply that we can compete sue

tries The plan is simple business arrange

the countenunce and assistance of the Govern

BELFAST, June 16.-Almond Gordon, and
his wife and child were found murdered in
their beds in Thorndike, eighteen miles from
here, this morning. No further particulars
have as yet been received


Second Despatch.


The following additional particulars of the
Thorndike murder has been received: Johu
Gordon, man of seventy, had recently con-
veyed to his son, Almond NJ, his farm worth
$1,000, taking back mortgage for the life sup
port of himself and wife. The other son, John
T., was dissatisfied with this arrangement, and
probably thought that by the death of his
brother and family, that the property would
fall to him. This is the only motive thus far
assigned at the time of the murder.


The old people were absent oD visit The
inmates of the house were the murdered man,
Almon NJ, aged 25, Emma A, his wife, aged
p, their children, Ira b., aged 9, and a little
girl aged IL mouths, Anna A, niece, aged 8,
John t., the brother, and the hired man. AT
about three o'clock the latter was awakened by
the shrieks of the little boy, and Immediately
discovered that the house was on fire. Alarm
ing the neighbors the flames were extinguished
without much damage. The bodies of the faith
er, mother and infant, who occupied the same
bed, were found mangled and so scorched as to
be hardly recognizable. The little boy, who
slept in crib in the same room, was severely
wounded but may survive. The bloody deed
was evidently committed with an axe. which
was found ON the premises. The wounds Of
the three murdered persons were inflicted upon
tine head, and must have caused instant death.
The brother, John T., was soon arrested and
remains in custody of the sheriff. He is %
years old, farm laborer and unmarried. He
maintains sullen indifference, refusing to ans.
wer any questions but saying that at the proper
time he will defend himself.


A jury of inquest is now in session under
charge of Coroner Poor, but had not rendered a
verdict when the last train left Thorndike al
half past six this evening. The prisoner will
probably be arraigned before the Police Cour,
of this city tomorrow."

Education Fund Yesterday-GeneraI
Grant Absent-Report OF the Agent in
Regard to the Condition OF the schools
I'm the Southern statcs-sI35,s4O Dis


tributed During tho Last Year.
The Trustees OF the Peabody Education Fund met
again at the Filth Avenue Hotel yesterday after
nosn. Hon. Robert G. winthrop, Hon. Hamilton
Fish, william M. Evarts, George W. Riggs and
others were present President Grant, who at
tended the first meeting was absent Hon. Robert
c. winthrop presided and George Peabody Russell
acted as secretary.


The first business In order was TO elect a sue
cessor to Bishop McIlvaine. Surgeon General
Barnes, OF Washington, was elected in place OF
deceased, and Governor Aiken, OF South Carolina,
was elected Second Vice Chairman.


The Rev. DR.. Sears. General Agent OF the Board.
submitted a lengthy report which gives an eX-
tended account OF the system OF
PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN THE SOUTH,
and particularly Of those States which have received
aid from the Peabody fund. The following is the
gist Of the report


The Superintendent Of Schools IN Virginia says
in mis- report ""it VIII be that SIS 900 Of the
proceeds OF the Peabody education fund we're ap-
propriated to the Virginia schools during the past
scholastic year. The bulk OF this was given in aid
OF graded schools, and was highly influential in
promoting the formation OF this class OF schools
and In the prolongng OF their sessions-both OF
which were objects Of the first Importance""


The following the names OF the various schools
in Virginia and amounts appropriated Richmond,
$4,000; Petersburg, 81, 600; Lynchburg 1000; Nor
folk 500; Portsmouth, 81, 500 Winchester, 81 800
Staunton, S, 800; Wytheville, $1,000; Manchester
$1,000; Harrisonburg, $500; Hampton Colored
School $500; Richmond, $500, and a large number
OF other places with smaller amounts.
In North Carolina the condition both OF the pub
nc schools and OF education generally
is FAR FROM SATISFACTORY.
The amount received by the schools OF this State
IL xl26 Wilmington and Newbcrn head the list
with 1000 each, ana other places follow with 5000,
In South Carolina few schools are supported
through the year, and consequently the trustees
have not had opportunity Tor many appropriations
one thousand dsnars was paid to the Charleston
school iund


The schools in Georgia received $40, 200; Atlanta
$4,000, Augusta $4,000, Macon $1,000 Brunswick
1000 and other places smaller amounts.
In Florida many circumstances existed during
the past year unlavorabe to the progress OF edu-
cation. The amount received was $500. Jack
sonvie received $l,4oo,- st. Augustine $1,000,
bama there is a thorough system OF public instruc-
tioa for population OF one million OF people or
this million $4,000


CANNOT READ AND WRITE.
The Peabody fund gives Alabama $1,000. Mobile
receives $1,000. Montgomery and Selma. $1,000
each, and Huntsville and Opelika 5, 900 each,


In Mississippi the results are gratifying to the
friends OF popular education when the short period
OF time IL cOnSldered during Wnlch the system or
public schools has been in operation In that State
The amount received was a. 450; Jackson received
$500, summit 81, ,0Oo and four other places smaller
amounts


The amount OF donation for the schools in Louis
lana was 81, ,S90-$5,o4 for common schools 81, 600
for the Peabody Normal Seminary OF New Orleans
which numbers 100 MEMBERS who are graduates of
high schools, and Is open to pupils IRON all parts
of the State, and $3.50 to normal departments III
two other institutions.


Texas has received no money, owing to the pres
ent unsettled state OF school matters there.
81 have consulted the Trustee residing here"" the
Regent replied, in answer to numerous requests
for money, ""and he agrees with me that in the


PRESENT UNSETTLED CONDITION
Of school matters In Texas should not be jusi-
fed In making donations from our fund. We
Therefore, Ieel obliged to wait till we can do 1t
more in accordance with our rules and usagcs.""


In Arkansas the condition OF school matters Is
unfavorablc The amount OF assistance was 50 300
Little Rock, $4,000; Van Buren,, $1,000; Fort
Smith, $1,000, and Others


Tennessee received s25, 800, as the state pros
trate and had abolished Its school system. IL was
this assistance which was the means of introduce
ing very good State law.


In West Virginia there were three superintend-
progressing iavoraply. The amount received was
$l5,5OO.


The total amount expended during the past year
for all the states was $l35,s40. Fifteen States
are ultimately To share In the benefits OF the fund
but ior the present Missouri Kentucky and Mary
land are omitted, at the request VI the founder.
The trustees propose to distribute the money, not
in proportion to population or any other liked
ratio, but To give 1t


WHERE 1T WILL ACCOMPLISH MOST
in promoting II system OF public free schools. The
states that receive less this year Will receive more
hereafter Texas, for instance, would not be bene-
nted 80 much by the distribution this time as ut
future time when the State Will be able to use IL to
better advantage. The expectations OF the Trus-
tees have been more than realized. Al first there
we're only two States that had school systems and
those were only nominal; now every State has q
system in law and the majority OF States have sys
TENS in vigorous operation, During the coming
year special attention will be given TO the school
system OF North Carolina, which Is about TO reor-
game its schools.


Alter approving the report the Board adjourned
till October, 1874."

arrested in Jefferson City, Mo-, on the 25th OF
July, for horse stealing in Galloway county,
and taken to that county for trial. A few
days after they were taken back to the Jeffer-
son City Jail to prevent them being lynched.
Last Thursday they we're taken to Fulton,
the capital of Galloway county, for trial On
the way August escaped from the train, but
the old man was taken to Fulton, where he
confessed the crime, aud was sentenced to
Six years in the penitentiary. After the SEN
teDce, Colonel Low, the Sheriff, with posse
OF four, started with the prisoner for the
depot in hack, when it was surrounded by
a mob and the surrender of Kessler de-
manded. This being refused, the Sheriff and
his guards, John Y Provinces, John Watson
and two others, named Dearborn and Cohen,
were fired upon and mortally wounded. Kessler
was then taken by the mob and hanged out
side the town. A large party of lynchers are
searching for young Kessler."

Curlett's farm near Church Hill on Tuesday
night week, and the dwelling and contents
were consumed. The family were asleep and
narrowly escaped with their lives, Mrs.
Spencer jumping cut second-story window.
No insurance; loss l, l,250. The cause Of the
fire is unknown.


About 400 Baltim orians came over to Talbot
to visit Beckwith camp one day last week
The steamer stopped in the ChOptank and pro.
ceeded to disembark her passengers by small
row boats. The first load of ten that started
off was capsized, and though none of them
were drowned, it so frightened the rest on the
steamer that they refused to leave it. So they
didn't see the camp at all.


Money and Checks Stolen-On the 18th,
r. q. Hopkins cashier Of the Cecil County
National Bank, at Port Deposit, consigned
$1,000 in mutilated currency to the Secretary
of the Treasury for redemption, and at the
same time he started Tor Baltimore a number
OF Checks and drafts on New York and Balti
more parties. Both lots were stolen from the
train between Perryville and Port Deposit, and
nothing since has been seen or heard from
them. A reward Of 5000 is offered for their
return.


Sad Case of Dro,cniag.--Mrs Sarah Can
non, widow of Geo. Cannon, and mother Of
| William i. Reese, of Chesapeake City, was
drowned near CrumptOn, on ThurSday morn
ing. The Kent NeiCS says that she and Miss


Emma Lynch were riding together in car


rlage, and after getting ,'r!c distance into the


stream at GOdwin's MILL Queen Annes county,


they found it too deep to cross and attempted


to back the horse out but he rushed forward


into the torrent, which swept both ladies from


the carriage, Miss Lynch catching and holding


on to a wheel, while Mrs. Cannon was carried


down the stream and drowned. Mr. William
Goodwin witnessed the disaster, and seeing


that it was impossible to rescue the young
!, lady by any means at his command, (the


water being about nine feet deep and rushing
down with fearful volOcity,) put his horses tC


wagon and fastened to Crumpton after a


boat, by which means Miss l.. was rescued
after clinging to the carriage wheel for three
quarters of an hour The horse was drowned
: and the body Of the aged lady (she was 73
} was found some distance from the scene of the
2 disaster


More About that Lie-Two weeks ago W,

Congressman entertained a number o.
cOlOred guests in his parlor during the recen

the statement as ""an Unnlitigdted he from

paper repeats its charge, alter this fashion

Col. HambletOn will not attempt to deny

the lmpudence to have entered the sacred pre-

| IBr TELEGRAPH To THE TRIBUSBl
| WASHINGTON, Feb. 3.-The Senate Commit
tee Privileges and Elections got the very meat Of
the which the kellogg state Government Of
Louisiana bases its authority and the startling revea-
tons made to-day throw more light the than oil
the testimony that has before been taken. To make to-
days revelations tho Ineligible 1t is necessary to
recall few facts that have been known and admitted
ever since the contest the began in New
Orleans which have heretofore been brought out by
| the inquiry OF the Committee Judge Duren, Is well
known decided that one should participate in the
| organization OF the Legislature OF Louisiana
who not returned by the Lynch
| Bogrd, which had boen organized by the
Kellogg party. When this had been promulgated the
President gave orders to the military commander at
NewOrleans to assist II necessary, in executing the
decree of the Court and when 100 Of the leading busi
Of the city elegTaphed asking the President
10 wait until they could lay the facts OF the case they
understood them before him before recognizing either
party tho Attorney General replied that 1t would do no
good for them to come the President had made up
his mind. One Of the witnesses to-day the officer
who executed the order and he testified that he took
possession Of the Mechanics Institute, where the Legis
| lature meets. at o'clock in the morning
| OF the 9th OF December, and allowed one
| TO enter except those designated by United
States Marshal Packard. 1t was also admitted
| last week by the members Of the Lynch Returning
Board that they had of the legal returns which
to base their canvass that they used newspaper re-
ports certificates OF United States Supervisors and the
afidavits of men who were prevented from voting.
When the Lynch Board summoned its members
ordered to bring all the papers from which they
made their This they did not do but said that
they were on the way These excuses have been re-
peated until the patience Of the Committee has been
almost exhausted But, though the Committee has thus
far been unable to obtain these papers, they did to-day
learn great deal about the way In which they were
prepared.


Theodore jacques, Grant Republican United States
Supervisor a witness before the Committee, and
that he went to the Parish of Plaquemines
carrying with him printed afdayts with blank place
for the of the eector who had been prevented from
voting He visited about 800 persons In company with
United States Commissioner In some instances jacques
said TO the person whom he visited You swear but
the aidavits not filed out except in instance
until he returned 10 NewOreans, where the remainder
OF the filed in and the jurat Of the Com
missioner attached He then took 03 more Of the blank
adavits and filed in the of persons found on the
old registration list many Of which we're Of men who
dead, had only a mythical existence, and
to these the same jurat was attached The affdaVlt
thus manufactured Jacques took to the Lynch Board
and by counting them votes the Republican candi-
for the Legislature elected To many OF the
before the names were filled IN and jacques put one OF
these evidence. The witness said that he did this at
the request Of Mr. Sypher candidate for Congress, who
obtained for him Government barge aud gave nm slO
Senator Carpenter put jacques through very seFeTo
crossexamination attempting to break him down, put
without Mr. Sypher also tried bis hand at cross
of the witness, and only succeeded In bring
ing out additional facts more damaging to himself
than any that had come out IN the direct examination.
The testimony caused great excitement among the
LOuisianans present.

years Old bruisng him terribly about the head and
back aud that In concert with Commissioner Starr he
had suspended Mr Hearne and he now moved that the

Commissioner Lynch opposed the motion, and threat
ened to withdraw from the meeting, leaving tho Board
without quorum, II it passed. Tho motion was
finally laid until the next meeting Commissioners
Stevenson also stated that the President OF the Rouma
nan Society had called upon him and requested that
five emigrants from Roumania VINO unable to sup
port themselves be back TO their homes at tho
pense Of the Commission. He moved that the request
be con- lied with, which carried and the Secretary
WAS Instructed TO inform the President OF the Rouma
MAN soc ety OF the action Of the Commission and to
quest him TO use his influence TO prevent the mmgra
of people unable TO support themselves IN this
country. Commissioner Kaufman said ne thought the
American Consul Bucharest deserved severe censure
for permitting such emigration, and stated that he
should probably at the next meeting introduce resO-


luton calling the attention OF the state Department to
the conduct OF the Consul.

.EE LAST ELECTION.

consider The present political situation n


-le STATE OF Louisiana. Iou had an cleo


zion in November last.


A voice in the crowd-No, we didn't:
Senator Carpenter-Well. you had some.
thing. About one-hali Of your people say
there was an election. and McEEerv was
elected Governor. Another part say there
was an election. and tha. Kellogg was

and nobody was elected Governor. Bat at

with them was duly elec,eGsby the people.
Kellogg and his :.ssocIates@ lain 10 have
been elected 20 the same State offices. and

persons in sympathy with them was duly
tSected.


USCoSS.lTU11oNALyTY OF Til: ELECTION
LAW.


This election was held under che State
lava law passed in several particulars n
fragrant defiance Of YOUR State constitution.
Yoar constitution provides :hat the votes

them until Ihe second day after the con.
reniIg Of tie Legislature, and then GelIye:
them 20 she Speaker OF the House, anG that

statute provided that the board of canvas
sers or. as you style it. the returning board.
should consist OF the Governor, Lleutenan:
Governor. Secretary Of State, and John
i.vnch and T. c. Anderson by name: that
the returns should be made 10 this board.
ana that they should canvass them and de.
clare The :esu!:. Tie statute. therefore.
provides a totally different channel for the
transmission Of the returns. and a dlteren:

those provided by the constitution. The

THE CASE IN THE UNITED STATES COURT

they are at liberty to prove was decayed


Judge Lynch's patience is ea'ly exhaust
| ed. The trial of the libel case has con
| sumed SIX days. The defense have not vel
| commenced any evidence under the genera
issue, to which the decayed state Of thei,
pleadings reduce them. Hour after hour
has been consumed in argument by the
learned counsel on the propriety OF a single
question. The court at the conclrsio OF
the days work. told counsel no more argu.


ments on questio iors of evidence wor'd be


heard.


The days business was opened bv a mo.


ton Of plaintiff 8 counsel to s,Iike from the


answer of the defendants all except the


general denial. Everybody was heard on


that point. The answer was analyzed and


commented on. Mr.. Ogden was not pres
ent during the greater part it.


At the onclusion Of the argument Judge
Lynch examined the answer paragraph by
paragraph. He compared the various de-
malls and contradictory averments. This
examination of the answer he gave to illus
trate and sustain his previous rulings.
These restrict the defense to their proof
under the general issue. He finally decided
he would not sustain the motion as pre-
sented, but would entertain a motion re.
stricting the defendants to their proof un-
der the general issue.


The defense excepted.


Mr.. Ogden then put tie question of the
day before to Mr.. Rhett. whether he or auy
Of the directors had any malice in pu blish-
ing the article in question. Mr.. Rice ob.
jected, and opened the argument on the
point. He said it was not competent for
the defense to show by testimony of the de-
PENDANTS that they had no personal spite.
The jury. and the jury alone, were to deter
mine whether this malice did or did not
mark this publication. 1t would appear
difficult priori to imagine how it would
be possible to appreciate a TACT which was
kept entirely concealed and out of view.
Indeed, in the very many cases that are ap-
pllcable to this question they almost with
out exception concur in the ruie that the
question OF malice is to be submitted to the
jury upon the face of the libel or publica-
1t is not for the plaintiff to prove malice
it is an inference - be- left to ,he jury. If
the words are in themselves actionable,
malicious iutent in publishing them is an in
ference of law. and therefore needs no proof.
1t is unnecessary to weigh the evidence.
it is sufficient that It was satisfactory to
tie jury and proper for their consideration.
1t is clear that in the class Of cases in
which this ranges Itself that the question Of
malice is exclusively with the Jury. In ac
tions of this Kind malice j, inferred. At
common law If the words spoken or pub
lished are in themselves accionabie tas they
import an accusation OF an indictable OF.
fense), maliciou. intent is an ir+erence Of
law. and. therefore. needs no proof. Mr..

were all committed for the sake of political
faction, and the President sustained them for
political reasons. ""The decree"" [Of Judge
Durell's COURT, telegraphs Collector Casey to
Gen. Grant, eff enforced will save the Repub-
""lican majority, and give Louisiana a Repub-
""lican Legislature and State government""
1t is especially gratifying therefore to find
that the Committee of the Senate-a Com
mittee in which the ardent supporters of the
Administration have the overpOwering majority
of six to one-has dealt with the case in the
determination to do justice, no matter who
may be hurt. The report was drawn
I'D by one of the most earnest par
tisans in the Senate. Mr.. Carpenter is
equally distinguished for his fidelity to the Ad-
ministration and the skill with which upon
occasion he has brought his eminent attain
ments as lawyer to the defense of Republ-
can errors and the excuse of the blunders of
his chiefs. Yet no one, of either party, has
denounced the Durell and Kellogg usurpa-
tion with more severity, or pointed out more
clearly the terrible mistake of the President
in giving it the support of the United States
Army, than Mr.. Carpenter has done in the
majority report which was presented to the
Senate last week. In this severe Characterization
of the Louisiana transactions Mr.. Carpenter is
sustained by all his colleagues, and the remarks
which Mr.. Trumbull, Mr.. Morton, and Mr..
Hill felt called upon to make in dissent, ap-
piled only to the remedies suggested for the
cure Of the disorder.


The report holds that whatever may have
been the claims of the rival Lynch and Whar-
ton returning boards in the first stages of the
controversy both those bodies were abolished
by the bill which WarmOth drew out of his
safe and signed on the Goth of November, and
the De Feriet board, appointed under this new
law, became the only lawful authority to can
yass the returns. The orders of Judge Durell,
purporting to decide that the Lynch board
was the only regular one, are denounced by
the Senate Committee as wholly illegal and
void; the decision of the State Supreme Court
10 the same effect is declared void for fraud
and want of jurisdiction. The crowning out
rage however, was the seizure of the State
House by Durell's midnight order. or this
Mr.. Carpenter says: at is impossible to con-
""ceive of more irregular, illegal, and In
""every way inexcusable act of judge. Con-
""ceding the power of the court to make such
""an order, the Judge out of court had no
""mOre authority to make it than the

This WAS the fragd which Judge Durel and
the army forced upon the people of Louisiana.
""But for the interference of Judge Durel in
the matter of this State election. a matter
""wholly beyond his jurisdiction, the McEnery
Government would to-day have been the de
"" frot0 Government of the State"" The Com
mittee seem to entertain no doubt that an
honest count of the votes actually cast would
have shown the McEnery party to be elected,
although there was doubtless great deal of
cheating on both sides during the election.
The Kellogg Government, at all events, cannot
be sustained without violating every principle of
law and justice. IF the support of the troops
""wore withdrawn"" said Mr. Carpenter the
other day in debate, cit would not stand ten
""minutes"" The only question upon which
Congress can fairly hesitate is whether the
McEnery Legislature shall be recognized by
the admission of the Senator whom it has ChO
sen, or Mr.. Carpenters bill shall be passed,
ordering new election on the ground that
the election of last November was void on ac
count of fraud.


One of these two courses should certainly be
adopted before the session closes. The Presi
dent calls upon Congress to decide. He gives
fair notice that if he be left to himself he
shall persevere in his usurping course, and not
only continue to recognize Kellogg. but use
the military power to ""put an end to the un-
happy controversy"" On the other hand. the
action of McEnery in calling out the State
Militia, and thus assuming the gravest duty of
Governor, indicates the determination of his
supporters sharply to contest their rights.
McEnery declares that he will sustain himself
by the Militia the President is ready to do as
much for Kellogg with United States troops.
This is civil war We have a right to de-
mand that the National Legislature shall
deliver us from this danger. The course
which we judge most prudent and most equita-
bic is to recognize the government which has
been shown by the Senate Investigation to
possess certificates OF election from the only
legal returning board, and to have received a
majority of the votes actually cast We do
not believe Congress ought to go behind these
facts, and resort to the doubtful and danger
Gus expedient of ordering new election.

drunkenness. II Ia conceded by all men every

ferent and conflicting opinions.


LIcsssk SYSTEM.


For many years the current belief has been
strained @ and S regulated m % ~ license laws, more or
less stringent; hence the numerous statutes
which have been enacted by the different States
and communities. having this end In view.


The people for generations and for centuries
have tried this experiment, only TO be cheated In
the end, and TO nud, everywhere and always,
failure. Permit an evil, and II will grow and
thrive In spite OF attempted restraints. 1T Is
traiic an inch and il VIII take an ELL tolerated
eyll soon becomes an Oyermnstering and giant
wrong. II Is impossible TO regulate an lrregu.
IL. 1t Is impatient Of restraint, and when the
greed OF gain Is once awakened II grows ram

selfish purposes. Therefore the license system
IN no instance has operated to check the growth
OF intcmperance or TO lessen the crime Of drunk

oyer,rawn picture, and startling As s and
should be, to all thoughtful and rehecung peo-
pie, y Is nevertheless solemn realty and 4
veritable fact.


WHAT SHALL De DosEf


without wasting words 10 further elucidate
and enforce the above statement OF admlieI
truths, we come directly TO the inquiry which
addresses itself with force At this time TO the
people OF the District Of Columbia. what shall be
put putt "" stop stop To- to t 1he ieseiized Al % msnaisctaro Of
dTunkaTds?


Il is an oil and accepted maxim, old at least
1I""-""Tho welfare of the people Is the supreme
law""


PROHIBITION.


.a..-0u
our conviction and belief that 4 stringent pro-
hihiiory law, generally and thoroughly enforced,
Is the true and successful method OF dealing
with the manufacture and sale OF intoxicating
drinks. And from what we know OF the opera
lions OF the prohbitive policy In states where II
has been tried, we come squarely to the concln.
sion that II must, at no distant day, become the
ultimate policy lu all the states OF this Union,
and also OF the National Government In say
ing this much Of prohibiton, we do not ,Iss lose
to bo operative and effective for public good
must march abreast with public opinion.


LOCAL OPTION AND DAMAGE LAWS.


In several States they are trying ''local op-
law; and Testimony from ali quarters where this
damage law Is being tried Is that much good is
accomplished. Perhaps, at this time this is all
ance legislation In the District Of Columbia.


These provisions OF law to which we allude
and which are now being tried In several OF the
states, contain so much restrictive force As to
amount In many respects to prohbitory statutes.
They provide for the recovery Of damages by
the wife or children for liquor sold to the nus
They compel, as we understand, in some in
stances, the liquor-seler TO provide suitable ac-
cOmmodations IN his house for the care and pro-
lection Of those VINO become intoxicated while
under hts roof, or those who may enter these
dram-shops under the influence OF liquor:


The keepers OF rum-snops are placed under
such bonds as will secure the payment OF all
damages that may be obtained against the deal
Known ntemperate n % habits, % oT 70 those ' who are re
known to spend their earnings for liquor, thereby
leaving their families in destitutioh. II is pro-
vided also that liquors shall not be sold 10 per-
sons Of unsound mind nor to minors.


Believing that a law Of this character may be
speedily enacted "" the temperate and sober.
minded citizens and voters OF this District will
do their duty, and that It will do much good and
prepare the way for something better aud more
comprehensive in future, we call the attention OF
temperance nen Of all parties to this opportune
occasion, and ask them to see to II that the right
men are nominated In all the Assembly districts,
who, when elected, will vote for this damage law,
II not for more restrictive policy.


DEFEcrs IN IuE DISTRICT GOVERNMENT.


Our object, then, In addressing you at this time
is 10 recall to your memory the TACT that nearly
all the defects In our District government and
Its management are traceable TO the manufac-
ture, sale and consumption Of intoxicating IL
. quors. We see dram-shops thrive In the vicinity
OF our public oiilces, our courts OF Justice both
criminal aud civil, and their baneful influence Is
especially felt In the selection Of candidates Of
ali political parties for our surages In the cleo





has come TO this, As we ali well know, that those
electors who wish to preserve their self-respect
dare not enter the contest and wade through the
puTleus OF vice and drunkenness to secure the
nomination OF candidates who are fitted to be-
come the conservators of public morals and aid
in the suppression Of vice. The influence Of the
liquor tTaffc invades all our political caucuses
and primary elections, and debauchss both citi-
zen aud candidate, until politician and tippler
words, where you Ind an active politician You
are pretty sure to md man who drinks or en-
courages drinking In others. The result Is gen.
eral iooseness OF morals In government ofrcers
and employees. The influence Of rum-drinking
IL so debasing that lis victims are sure to pro-
ess with greater g, or 1sss TsPai upon the
The evidence OF these facts Is so patent to oil
sober minds that no argument Is necessary to
produce conviction.


DETERMINED EFFORT.


We have determined tat IN effort shall be
made TO stay this diabolical influence, which
seems TO have fastened ITSELF like an incubus,
upon the society and government OF our beau
It shall be made now. We are aware that, to
succeed, II must be united In BY all those who
compose the better classes OF the community,
and il IL for this reason that we now make this
appeal for pledged pronounced temperance men
for oflice. ,,-,,

and corruption run riot end cry TO heaven for

and moral manhood AMI wOmanhood, such as
does not coexist with drunkenness, debauchery

NO SIDE ISSUE.
In presenting this appeal to the people, breyIty
requires us TO he succlnct In statement, logical
and tersc In argument, candid and forcible In
utterance. We know that the adherents OF ex-
istipR parties will carp at us, and allege that
ours is q side issue-that II Is an attempt on our
part TO carry religion and morals into politics,
and 10 seek by legislative interference to con.
troll the personal and private habits and conduct
OF the people. We are told that these things
belong to the domain OF the preacher, the
teacher and the moral reformer, and that moral
suasIon is the agency and instrumentality by
which and with which the drunkard Is TO be
reached aud intemperanoe removed, II removed
at all. ,,


This argument Ia both specious and sophistical,
and the most casual observer cannot fail to see
that this reasoning, II not side issue, Is false
one.

4 violent rain-storm, accompanied by

about 3 o'clock on Saturday evening, and
continued, with but brief intermission, until
$50 O'Clock. At intervals the rain poured
down In torrents, rendering some Of the
streets impossible for time. The ,olume of
water was so great that the sewers were not,
In some instances, Of sufficient capacity to

agreeable sense Of relief when the storm
abated.


From o'clock p. IN. until 4:30 o'clock D.

fell; but between 0 and Oils o'clock there was
fall of ninety one-hundredths Of an inch.

Mas, Meeting sa,urdr, Njsh,,",,"


The violent rain storm Of Saturday evening
did not deter the cold-watcr men from turn
ing out In force to participate In the mass
meeting at Marlni's Hall, + street, to rutlfy
the temperance ticket put In tho field for the
current local campaign. Mr.. A. c. Constan-
tine presided, and MIR. ]. r. Powell was sec
rctary.


After the reading OF the address prepared
BY the executive committee, which hns al
ready appeared In the REPUBLICAN, Mr.. p.
u. Peck addressed the meeting, and handled
Mr.. schadc, Of the Sentinel, without gloves.
He thought $1,000 from the brewers, to cs-
tablsh an organ here, with Schade ""a Its
editor, was dog cheap"" Still everybody
knows that IIossians were always for sale ;
II was 30 IN our Revolutionary struggle, and
II was so In this moral warfare.


Some thought that VIC ought to use moral
suasion,"" but experience demonstrated that
the strong arm OF the law was necessary to
put down the great evil. Others thought that
government clerks ought to be prevented
from voting the Temperance ticket because
Its success would decrease our revenues, but
they forget to estimate the cost Of traffic In
runi-the industry that II paralyzed, the en-.
ergics that It crushed, the poverty that II en-
tailed, the crime that II caused, the institu-
tions Of punishment, Of reform, and OF char
itN tuut "" ftHotttu uttthsufNs


Look at the question in any light that VIC
may, every Intelligent, right-thinklng mar
must confess that the man who votes the tenn
pcrance ticket docs better than he who goes
staggering to the polls to vote he knows mol
how or for whom. Mr.. Peck closed with O
defence Of carrying the question into politics
and retired with applause.


Hon. ID. =. Holloway paid q glowing trib.
ute to the countyof Washington, but said thai
1t would be an empty casket II nothing was
done TO suppress drunkenness. As to carry
Ing temperance Into politics, moral principles
should be carried everywhere. The damage
law had been successful In Indiana, and nc
license had been granted since the law wa,
passed.


Mr.. W. ?. Drew said that the old fogie,
were never ready to carry temperance int,
politics. No one need tell him that the Main,
law was sumptuary law. Sumptuary law
| were prohibitory. We did not ask for pro
hibition Of drinking-we cannot prohibi
drinking; but we did ask for q restriction o
the sale and manufacture. lie had observe,
that the candidates who had been indorse,
i by the temperance men were now more con
fdcnt Of their election than they were befor
the Endorsement. The temperance elemen
was showing itself to be a power In the city
| and II was bound ultimately to win.
| Mr.. Oscar Alexander, the candidate In tn
Fourteenth district, said he was in the field
and would stick. He had spent many year
practiclng at the bar Of intemperance, an,
total abstinence into all the relations Of life
both public and private, so far us his infucnc
extended.


/ Mr.. p. Schlcker made few remarks np
proving the nomination OF Mr.. A. A.Wheelock
In the Sixteenth district. He was hero
and one Of the bravest men In Washington
The clerks in the Departments had too mucl
independence to be lntimidated by the threat
| OF the managers of the liquor interest, an
would vote as their judgments dictated oil
this question Of temperance.


Justice s. G. Mills responded to repeated
calls. He was proud of the honor to be til
first candidate to unfurl the temperance ban
nor In the Nineteenth district. This ques
iion was above all party considerations, an,
there ought to be temperance club In ever,
district. When the liquor dealers establisl
an organ In their interest, 1t was time 70
temperance men to unite for the sake Of III
true interests Of the community.


DIR. Walsh said that the temperance mcl
had at last taken an ad 7ance step In the righ
direction. The temperance party stood upol
a platform as broad as humanity itself, an,
presented to the world In the principles EN-
blaZoned upon Its banners all that wa
grand and noble and glorious In manhood.


Mr.. Lynch explained the principles upoi
which the temperance campaign would b
conducted, and remarked that the temper
ance men only asked for q law restrictive o
the sale Of liquors, similar In its character I,
the laws now In force In the States Of Ohio
Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, as being NOR
effective and better applicable to the prcsen
temper Of the people than a law entirely pro
hibltory.


The meeting then adjourned.

on Church Persecution.


SCRANTON, Pa, Nov. 10, 1879.


The Right Rev. Bishop Lynch, OF Charleston,
s. c. who Is collecting funds for the restoration OF
the church wrecked in his diocese during the re-
cent civil war. delivered o mastery lecture here
this evening, in st. vincent's Cathedral, ""Bis-
marck and the Church."" The vast Cathedral was
crowded with persons OF different denominations,
who, having heard OF the Bishops oratOrical
powers, were anxious to hear him treat Of the
interesting subject in question The Bishop set out
by laying down the TACT that during the existence
OF the Catholic Church she has been the object OF
oppression and persecution under one form
or another. The Church was now going
through . crisis which three years ago
none would have looked for. In Germany,
where the minds OF men were taught by the sad
experience OF religious persecution nturies ago,
they ought to think it sweet to live in religious
peace and where OF all civilized nations religious
freedom seemed thoroughly established by consti-
tutional provisions, persecution has Unexpectedly
burst forth like hurricane and could tell the
extent to which the storm would 60. Bismarck, to
whose brilliant and successful career as states

the wonderful victory over France and the eStab-
liShment OF the German empire to be

power in his hand. He compared him with Trojan
OF old, who alter all his victories thought ne had
not full power so long as the Christians would not
obey his imperia ial edicts and worship the gods OF
heather mythology. The Bishop said Bismarck
thought his power was not complete unless 1t
in the matter OF religion. In founding the German
Empire he seemed to have taken the Russian En-
plre as model, with the Car as absolute head on
earth OF army, navy, civil government and Church,
thereby aiming to secure perfect unity OF the Em-
pire; so Bismarck desired that the imperial gov.
ernment OF Germany should have supreme control
even in matters OF religion. Tho Bishop spoke Of
the Efforts TO give some Importance TO the Old Ca
tholic movement-an effort which had failed and
then of the laws against the Jesuits, the Redemp-
florists and other religious orders of men aud
women; Of the prosecution OF bishops, clergy and
eminent lay men OF the interference with religious
worship and Catholic schools; OF the late law pro.
viding Tor SUPERVISION by the otfcers OF Catholic
strikes at the very life and being OF the Catholic
Church, and would reduce it In the German Empire
to little more than


SPECIAL DEPARTMENT OF POLICE.


What was the cause of all thisY Had the Church
done any act whatever to call for this attack
serving in the German armies during the late war
with France. Some had lost their lives and many
authorities Tor their heroic devotedness. The
Bishop asked what would be the upshot OF this
persecuton9 AS yet it Is confined to prosecutions,
threats OF Imprisonment and menaces. We
have but the commencement. The storm may
grow fercer in Germany, ior there seems
Church. 1t is seen in Switzerland. which denies
all its traditional lessons of liberty. 1t is in
Spain and in Italy, and is seen in the persecution
OF the Holy Father VINO Is prisoner at the vatican
but though the clouds were dark and menacing, the
Church OF God must stand, Tor He declared that He
Is with her and that she cannot fail She may be
tried by prosecutions, bat they will give her new
life. The blood OF martyrs is the seed OF Christians
and in Gods own good time the tempest would be
stlled.


Bishop Lynch, who is q venerable looking man,
of commanding presence with long, gray hair,
spoke with great ervOr and depth OF feeling which

The Wards Island Committee submitted re-

Commissioner STEVENSON read the report OF the

Commissioner LYNCH protested against the read

The report read by Commissioner Stevenson was
to the effect that all denominations had right to
use the chapel in Wards Island. but that the
Roman Catholic chaplain claimed its exclusive use
for the Roman Catholic religion. This was con-
trary to all principles of the department., and in
fact, OF the constitution OF the State The commit
tee expressed their hope that dogmas of faith
should never be allowed to interfere with the
agement of civil and municipal affairs. The COM
mlttee recommended a resolution that the Super
intendent be instructed to use the chapel

tions.

Fourth District Genre.


In this court, in the case of Williams.
Black & Co. VS.. Spencer Field, Jr., and %.
O. Bell, Judge Lynch has rendered the 1oi-
lowing decision:


On the first of August, 1869, spencer
Field, Jr., formed a commercial copartntf
ship in the city Of New Orleans 1or the
purpose of dealing ia coal; that eopartner-
ship continued till July 1. 1871, when II
was dissolved by mutual conseut. A Few
weeks prior 10 the dissolution "". "". He'll
left New Orleans by steamship on pleas
ure trip TO New York. He drank freely
during the voyage, and after his arrival IN
that city found hlmsc!f onS OF iuhH., ana
applied to the plaintiffs, Williams, Black
< Co., who lent him money st
different times during the month of
June 1871, for the payment
of which he gave draft fOr the sum OF
S7O7. dated New York, June %, 1871, pay
able at sight to the ordeS Of plaintiffs, drawn
on the Southern Bank of New Orleans. il
which, Bell said, his firm kept their account
To the draft he affixed the partnership
name of Field s. Bell"" The draft was
presented at the bank, and payment thereof
refused On the grould that Field II Bel!
had ne funds in the institution, whereupon
the draft was protested, and this action
was instituted for II. amount against FIELD
& Bell IN SoliGO.


There is no doubt az 20 the loan of The
money by Williams Black N Go. to Bell.
as alleged. The only point 20 be deter
mined in the case is whether any liability
attached 10 the late firm of Field q Bell,
now in liquidation for the payment OF the
draft given By Bell in the name of the
partnership OF which he was member
Mr. Black, one of the plaintiffs, testlles
| that at the time of advancing the money 10
| Walter Bell he was very particular to ask
| Bell whether be was a member of the firm
| of Field & Bell. and whether it was 10 be
| continued. Bell replied that he was mem
| Der of the firm, and that it was to be con
| tinued without any change. Black did not
know why Bell was in New York, and did
not ask him why he was there. 1t was
| through Black that the money was adj
| vanced He knew nothing Of the fact as to
the money being for the use of Bell indi-
| vidually. He did not know that Bell
! had no business in New York, or
| that he was on a drunken spree, until
! Bell was about leaving. He never knew
| the firm of Field & Bell only by reputation.
| He knew Bell since the latter was IN the
| New Orleans Postoffi e before the war, and
| their more intimate acquaintance began
during the war. Black always regarded
Bell highly, and thought him very reliable
| There was no inquiry made by Black as to
| the use which Bell was to make OF the
| money, no questions asked as to whether 1t
was or WAS not to he used for the firm of
| Field & Bell, or that Bell made any repre-
| sentatious of fraudulent nature to induce
| the New York firm to lend him the money
| Bell, in his evidence, says that he had
| known the plaintiffs for many years; that
| he used the money borrowed from them fnr
| his private expenses; that he got the
| money without reference 90 business IN any
| shape: that no part of the amount borrowed
! went to the use or benefit Of the firm OF
| Field & Bell; that the firm of Eis Id s. Bell
! lad no business in New York at that time,
or at any other place outside the State OF
Louisiana; that the plaintiff. knew the
| money was not for partnership purposes
and that such question was never ask' d.
that the money was loaned without askln.
questions; that he drc@ the draft and re
ceived all the consideration therefor.
| Spencer Field, Jr., says that he does not
know either OF the plaintiffs, and the firm
had no business transactions out OF. the
State of Louisiana; that the firm derived
no benefit from the obligation sued upon;
he never knew the draft was drawn until
after the partnership was dissolved.


Numerous authoriti s were cited by the
learned counsel of plaintiffs to bring home
to the firIn of Field s. Bell the liability
claimed to belong to them i'll this matter
1 ha ma


Field & Bell, are bound III sDlidO, because
it was a commercial copartneTsnip, and


Field would be liable for the whole debt


The court knows very well the resp0nsi-
bility attaching to partnerships OF this kind
from acts done by their individual mem
bers as their representatives. There exists.
| however, sine qua non to such RESPONSE
bitv, and it is that an obligation when
contracted by one partner must, to bind
the arnership. be for the partnership
that the use or Endorsement of the signature
oflhe firm Icy one of the parties to have effect
or authority must be made III partnership
tran nsaCtiOn- contrary dOctrlue would be
mOnstrOus aud subVersive OF all ass0Gla-
tions OF this kind. That a member of a
commercial firm in New Orleans could alb
sent himself to the far distant city Of New
York merely to indulge in drunken de-
bauch, aHd bis partner. who remained at
home attending to business, should be
bound 10 pay the cost OF the alcoholic de-
coctiOns Of the absentee, is proposition
which a court of justice can not sanction,
and yet this is virtually what the plaintiffs
claim in this suit.


Il is to be regretted that Williams, Black
& Go. should lose the money which they IN
good faith gave 90 Bell. but tkey trusted
him without having taken proFer precau-
| tons to ascertain, as they were bound to
! do, whether or not Che loan was for the use
| OF Yield & Bell, and was likely to insure to
their benefit. Sield, an innooeat party,
can not be compelled 20 make good TO the
plaintiffs the money they 30 imrrudentls y
gave ~ their acquaintance. Bell. bet

pointedly, "" take your safe, sir -

Lynch was now excited, and turning 10 the

On Friday last at Georgetown, Joe Burton,
Tor Green, his real name) was hung for outrag-
ing the person of Hannah Lank.


The crime was committed on Monday,
March 23d: Miss Lank, who is but Is years
old, lived near Rehoboth station, on the juno
ton and Breakwater Railroad, about six miles
from Georgetown. About 10 o'clock on the
morning of the 23d she was sent on an errand
to her uncle's ""a short distance from her home,
and while, returning through small piece of
pine thicket was met by Burton who accOmp-
lished his purpose under the most shocking
circumstances. They are to disgusting to re-
peat; The case was SO revolving that he was
barely saved from lynching. He was tried and
convicted at the April term Of court, the
young girl appearing as witness against him.
He was rather nice-looking negro, of muscu-
lar development.


AS clear and positive as was the proof of his
quit, he protested his innocence to the last,
and the citizens of Georgetown were utterly
surprised when they learned that John G.
Lank, father of the girl, had petitiOned the
Governor for respite for the prisoner. The
petition is dated on the 18th, two days before
the execution, and read as follows:


To HIS ExoELLEScr, JAMES PONDER. GOVERNOR OF rHE

The details of the execution we take from
the Sussex Journal, as follows:


After the irons were removed and during the
dressing he said when l bought these pants
did not expect to use them for this purpose""
While dressing he became composed and
smoked segar. He was then baptised by
Rev. b. j. Douglass, Episcopal minister.


At 26 minutes to II he drank a glass of
water, when. his hands were tied he walked
firmly up the gallOws, and to the question ""are
you guilty?"" answered II am not Rev. B.
}. Douglass offered prayer. After the prayer
he said he had nothing to say. To ""a question
of MIR. Burton, his former owner, he said
Il am Innocent"" and to the Sheriff he said


You are hanging an innocent man.
thank all tor kindness shown me-the minis
ters, and MIR. and Mrs Sharp 1.-THE sheriff and
wlfel. No one advised me not to confess
Mrs. Burton begged me to tell the truth about
it. The ministers told me need not hone for
mercy, if | was guilty, if died without con-
tossing it""


Tie said he was innocent. He wished all
well who brought him to this gallows, he had
no malice. At LIS the black cap was drawn
over his face. He lifted the cap and said to
Mr. Burton, TELL all the children good. bye""
He again thanked Mr. and Mrs. Sharp, and
his last words were, Il am innocent. And
shortly the drop fell The fall was 81 feet.
tie died hard, being Is minutes in expiring.
At II minutes past one the body was cut
down, aud after being placed in coffin was
delivered to his friends


The crowd gathered at the hotels after the
execution and the declarations of the diving
man received little credence. The testimony
10 the case was too positive and reliable to
admit OF question


The DeLdrdredn says: Burton was light
eGmplexloRed negro; about ""a years of age.
tie was rather intelligent looking, but bad the
guilt OF his crime almost written upon eyery
hneament of his face. During his confinement
in prison, he conducted himself in quiet man.
ner, and up to Wednesday last, enjoyed good
appetite, but from that time until his execu-
ton, he refused all kinds of food, but read
the Bible constantly. When interviewed by
the reporter on the day of the execution, he
denied ever committing the act, but the pl oof
before the court during his trial was so strong
that there Is not shadow Of doubt in the
community as to his guilt. The little girls
testimony was too poSitive-she identified
Burton as the man so clearly as to even re-
cognIze the peculiar expression that constantly
lurked around his mouth"""

Latin In the Public aish schools.

DIsoUssIoN OF THE sUpIEor IN THE BOARD OF FL


UoATIoE, LAST EVENING.",,"| UoATIoE, LAST EVENING.


MIR. Adams, chairman of the committee to


which was referred the subject OF the introduction


OF Latin into the public schools, made an elAbr :


rate and interesting report in favor of the pro-
posed measure. Ills address, which was care


fully prepared. reviewed the origin, spread and


importance of the Latin language, and the great
advantages of securing q classical education He
/ did not know why Wilmington should be behind


her sister cities and towns, which, almost without
i exception, make Latin public school study


The report stated that there were now IA boys
OF Public School No. /, taking private lessons IN
| Latin from Professor Tenney. The report


which was signed by Messrs. Adams, Higgins
| and Fraim in behalf Of the majority closed with
/ the following resolution Res0lUed, That the
| study Of Latin be introduced into tho Pubic
/ Schools of Wilmington to commence on the first


OF September next, and that the superintendent


be instructed to make arrangements for its in
| PRODUCTION.


Me. Adams moved the adoption of the resolu-
/ ton.


Mr.. zebley, in opposing the adoption of the
| report, said ne was one of the committee, and
| had intended to make a minority report but


after hearing the eloquent report of the majori-
/ ty, which went away back behind the Christian
Era he felt impelled to withhold it, and in his
plain manner opposed the adoption Of the ma
| jority report. He was an ardent friend of the
| education Of the masses OF the people, and did
not believe in taxing the poor to educate the
| rich in the dead languages. There were other
branches OF study in which our children we're
| not proficient, and which would be OF more use
| to them. In opposing the measure he claimed
| to be the friend OF popular education, and not
the education Of the few at the expense Of those
/ who would be compelled to labor for livelihood,
and would never have an opportunity Of study
| ing Latin even If it were introduced Into the
public schools.


Mr. Heisler. being the youngest member OF
| the Board, was he presumed the youngest from
the schools, which together with the advantages
he had had mixiug with the world enabled him
to have practical test OF the advantages Of
Latin education. A certain and large class of
our people were operatives, and could not enjoy
the advantages of the rich in acquiring cass-
cal education, except through our public schools
They are continually appealing to us to provide


some way by which their children may receive
| the advantages enjoyed by the rich.
Mr.. Moore agreed in tile main with Mr. Zeb
ley's remarks, aud would state further that one
of the judges of our Courts informed him that
he would be willing to exchange all the knowl-
edge of Latin lie had for knowledge of German
and French The most of Latin is now translat-
ed into English, and our chlldren can learn it


without spending years in acquiring Latin edu-
cat ion.


Mr.. Macalister agreed with the last speaker 10
relation TO the importance OF German ard
French. While Latin laid the solid foundation
of an education, the German assumes more
practical shape, and while faYOrlng the lntroduc-
| tion Of Latin he at the same time would favor
that OF the German or French. He closed his
| remarks by moving to amend the report
30 that German and French should also
| be introduced The Latin was the only ave-
Due through which We could become thorough
grammarians, and although much Of it had been
translal ed into Englieh, ii was vet the key to
polite literature In his travels in Europe he
had found that Education had much to do witt
| the easy victory of the Prusaians over the
French. In a company of 100 French soldiers
| he found but 81 VINO cJuld be called scholars,
| while in the same number OF Prussians he found
| SO who could not only understand the Ger man
and French but had q thorough knowledge OF
| the Latin language.


Mr.. Higgins hoped that the amendment of
| Mr.. Macastes would not be passed.
Mr. Macalster withdrew his resolution.
MIR. Higgins then made an eloquent and forcl-
| BILE address in favor of the report OF the Oom'
mittee to which we cannot do justice in 30 brief
| a space. He would vote for the public good
Those whom we would naturally look to as our
| models, have adopted the Latin, Why should
we uphold what can be got elsewhere as Tree as
! air 1t only requires one additional teacher,
and no scholar will be compelled to study it,
I Why uphold it then from those who wish to OBJ
| tain 1t.


Our boys sent to College excel in mathema-
| tics, while those from New England excel in the
| languages. New England, with her chemica
| scholars, given brains to the nation aud has
enough left at home. He hoped that the repor!
would be adopted.


II. M. jenkins, while agreeing generally with


the ideas OF the report would express his opinion
| and put himself right upon the record Educa
| tiou is MT Cramming but Training. The work
| of the school is not merely to put information
into the children's mind but TO expand, enlight-
en and train 1t, 30 that it may acquire its own
| information. Such an education is the A, b, o.
the key to unlock all the stories OF science.
/ Such training IL given by classical education
/ and while we have many distinguished examples
| of men risen TO eminence without that method
| of training we have had many more who were
| thorough classical scholars. Latlnis the parent
| Of nearly all the modern Languages OF civilized
Nations learn it first, and it is easy TO acquire
them 1t gives us the greater part of English;
| Spanish and Itaan are but notifications of 1t
| French and German are directly derived from it,
| He wanted to give the boys in the Public Schools
| as good a chance as those in Private Schools.
| He believed in Equal Rights and Equal Oppor
/ tunites for all.


Mr.. Roberts wanted to know where these
movements would stop. II we adopt Latin,
what will be wanted next


| DR. Shortlidge asked what stu iy would bo
omitted to make room for Latin. Mr.. Higgins
| answered that none would be, the curriculum
i as now arranged permitting the addition with


out lnterference.l He thought Latin was Hea-
/ yenly language and he wanted TO study the Ian


guage of Earth, first. He feared the pupils OF
/ the Public schools did not understand the Com


stitution of the United States or that of Della
/ ware.


i We should advance our system of educatlon far
i enough to enable our Public School pupils to go


from it to College. Only those need study 1t
| who wanted.


Further argument against the report was ad-


yanced by Messrs Zebley, Pierce, aud Speak


man, and in favor of it BY Messrs. Fiaim and
| Adams. The Ayes aud Nays were then called
i for and were as follows

question of appointing committee on per-

represent them in the committee. while
others desired that the whole committee be
appointed by the chairman.

where the counties In which the whites had
control-actual control-werc 80 or IS In 90.


There were i57 white delegates and 100 col

remained there until taken on board by the


John T. Moore. While away from homo he


learned his house had been sacked. As the


boat passed Colfax it was hailed by Mr..


Calhoun, but did not take him on board,


being unable to make the landing on ac-


count of the violent wind. On arriving at


Alexandria they learned the La3elle, which


had passed them, had taken Mr.. Calhoun


on board, but that he had been taken off


again under arrest by the sheriff at Pine


vile. At Alexandria were body of about


900 armed men who were going to Coltax to


attack the rioters. These men took six


pound cannon from the boat, and proposed


to take it with them. They also took from


the Durfee eleven casks of bacon and TWEEN
ty barrels Of fo1r. It was reported at


Alexandria that the rioters were shooting


all who refused to join them.


The La Belle, coming after the John T.


Moore, made landing q little below Col


fax, and took Mr.. Calhoun on board at


Curry Point, very near his own plantation.


MIR. Calhoun said he had been in the woods


since Tuesday of last week, that his


house had been seized by the rioters,


and he obliged to get away. At Col


fax the boat was hailed by a woman.


Mr.. Calhoun stated that she was a


teacher, from New Orleans, in a private


family. On reaching Pineville the Belle


was boarded by armed men from Alexan-
dria, who took Mr.. Calhoun off with them.
They told him no harm would come to him
if he was innocent, as he said he was, of
creating the riot. He was searched, and o
letter found on him from Representative
Ward to Governor Kellogg, reciting the
existing disturbance and asking tor as
sistance. The Belle was obliged to come
down and leave Mr.. Calhoun in their hands,
and it 10 feared he will suffer violence.
The cause of the riot seems to be the dupli
cate commissioning of the parish officers.
Governor Kellogg had. at the instigation of
Rutland and others, commissioned Nash
sheriff. and others Vho ran on the Fusion
ticket. Some of those on this ticket were
of the party who are charged with having
burned the house of Judge Phillips and
murdered Recorder White September 25.
1871. Mr.. Ward represented these facts to
Governor Kellogg. who thereupon issued
other commissions to the elected Repub-
licans. Mr.. Ward took the commissions,
went to Grant and demanded the offices.
He yas refused possession of the court
houss and then took it. Richardson
and Rutland. who. il 10 alleged. had

STATEMENT OF JUDGE RUTLAND.


Judge w. Il. Rutland, who arrived here
Yesterday morning on the steamboat John
T. Moore, furnishes the Pieayu,,c with the
following version. In reference to the
statement that he wrote letter TO the New
Orleans REPUBLICAN, which we refused to
publish. we can only say we never received
any communication from him:


The Lynch returning board ignored the
election of our parish officers, and M. KeI
logg appointed set OF men to I'LL the va
cancies, but who did not qualify according
to law, and allowed the time to elapse in
which they are required by law to do it
in. hr. Kellogg, at my instance, c0mmis-
stoned all officers who we're elected, includ-
ing both Republicans and Fusi0nists, white
and cOlored, except parish judge who had
already qualified aud was Republican.


Ward, member of the Dryades street
Legislature, learning that Mr.. Kellogg was
going to issue these commissions, fastened
to Culfax and took violent and fOrcibe pos
session of the courthouse and offices with a
mob. There was proposition to hold a
mass meeting of the people for the purpose
of expressing their condemnation in b
quiet way at the course pursued by these
men, but when the day arrived for the
meeting to have been called together
there were such violent demonstrations
made by Ward, Register and Flowers, and
the armed band that was backing them,
that the few white people who had
the matter in hand did not pretend
to do anything, but quietly returned to their
homes without going near the courthouse,
DR. assembling anywhere. After this was
advised by friends to seek safety, as my
lie was in danger. / took their advice aud
started to- cross the river to Mr.. j. c.
Morsntini's place, but when got 60 the
river was interviewed by another friend, !
y no told me that it would not be cafe for |
ne to return to this sioe Of the river that |
hight. After crossing the river vas met |
again by persons y hO told me there was a

Mr.. Morantnl furnishing ine with horse |

We copy tie following from the New
York Tribune of the ninth instant:


In the middle of last June q mass meet
ing of New Orleans colored people with
delegations from surrounding parishes, 3OGC
in all, appointed a committee of seven to GO
North and enlighten the public as to the
attitude of the colored men IN Louisiana in
the election of last year. The committee
comprised Colonel James Lewis, Admins
traitor Of Public improvements in New Or
leans, chairman: General T. Morris Chester,
State Senators j. Henri Burch. A. E. Bar
Der and James H. lngraham: J. Ross Stuart,
of the Louisiana House Of Representatives,
and w. G. Brown, State Superintendent Of
Education OF this delegation, Colonel
Lewis and General Chester are now in the
city, the former intending TO return to New
Orleans next week, and the latter being on
his way to Harrisburg. A Tribune reporter
called on Colonel Lewis last evening, and
was informed of the plans of :he delegation
and of New Orleans affairs as viewed by a
Kellogg partisan.


Most Of the delegation left New Orleans
in the last part OF July, go as to be present
at the Saratoga convention OF coiored men,
which was held on Wednesday, expecting
to meet there the prominent cOlOred men OF
this and adjoining States. and to make ar
rangements with them for the holding OF
more meetings at various points to listen to
the statements of the delegation. But the
Saratoga convention was very neager, and
extended arran ngements were not made. In
the evening mass meeting was held, at
which Messrs. Lewis, Burch and Barber
spoke. Another meeting Will be held at
Saratoga next Tuesday evening, to be ad-
dressed by members of the delegation, who
are expecting to attend the Massachu-
setts Republican State Convention and
speak there. They vii! call mass
meeting at the Cooper institute, ID
this city, in the latter part of this
month, and will occupy themselves in the
North for two months. A prominent object
of the delegation is TO show that the people
of Louisiana are now for the most part con
tent under the present government, and 70
influence popular and congressional senti-
men, against the ordering Of new cleo
ton. A committee OF twentv.One wac ap-
pointed At the New Orleans June mass
meeting to gather further testimony OF the
alleged frauds by which the original hoard
elected last autumn. That committee is
actively at work, and Colonel Lewis states
has already obtained new proofs Of
the asserted talsity Of the first re-
turns. Colonel Lewis atfirms that ballot
boxes have been discovered secreted under
the jail floor at Baton Rouge, which were
put away with their contents uncOunted
because they contained so large proper
tion of Republican votes. He says that the
committee OF twenty-one have taken the
sworn statements or nearly half OF the su-
perv:sors and commissioners of election
who acted last fall: and these statements,
it is alleged by the delegation. are sufficient
TO overturn the evidence on which Governor
WarmOth based his claims. The Lynch
board of returns is blamed for not having
gathered this testimony before the congress
siOnal investigating committee last winter.
1t il affirmed that if this had been put in,
the majority report. denying the legality Of
kellOggs occupation OF the Governors
chair, would never have been rendered.


Colonel Lewis declares himself as certain
that the Kellogg administration is daily
gaining in force il Louisiana, as Governor
Kellogg has exerted himself largely to re-
deem the financial credit of the State, and
has raised more money IN a given time TO
meet its liabilities than any preceding ad-
ministraiion. He estimated the 'nnifca-
ton"" movement highly. 1t is just what is
necessary TO restore harmony and prOsperi-
II. He was confident that the Democrats
who had taken part in the movement were
sincere, for they saw the imperative need of
grand, united effort to rally all the forces
af the whole people of Louisiana to the sup
port and revival Of its dropping resources.
Moreover, come OF them are very inEuen-
:ial, and carry great weight with the party.
Hence Colonel Lewis expressed himself as
hopefCl from the growing content under
the Kellogg government and the prospect
OF the success OF uniEcatiOn.


A Washington special to the New York
Times. of the same date, says:


United States Marshal Packard, Of Lou.
isiana, has been in the city several days on
official business. He reports the opera
ton of the State government under
Governor Kellogg as complete. Its
appointees are now exercising their func-
tions in every parish without resistance.
and no other assumed authorities are at
tempting any such exercise. People are
paying their taxes, and the State treasury
is rapidly preparing to redeem the past due
State obligations There is, nevertheless, a
party, led by Ex-Governor Warmoth, who,
whatever the condition Of things may be
next December. will probably appeal to
Congress for interference. NOn-interference
has thus far been productive of most excel
lent results. 1t has been ascertained that
nearly every member OF the so-called Nc
Emery Legislature, who was legally elected,
will return to the regular body when it
again meets."

The Radical Nominee Cor s.eyer,,or
",,"


Our columns this morning tell the
| whole story of the Lynchburg Conven-
| ton, Robert W. Hughes was nomina-
ted for Governor. This will not sur
prise the readers of the Dispatch, who
have been told day by day that such
was to be the result OF the delibera-
tions @ of that Convention. Great is
Grant, and potent are his orders
amongst the carpet-baggers, scalawass
and negroes.


Will Mr.. Hughes be elected d? Ger
tainly not. We can scarcely imagine a
tain of circumstances so unfavorabl.
to the welfare of Virginia rs to lead to
that result. He has more friends h,,t
also more enemies than McMahon. He
has none of the elements of popular
leader. He cannot fire the hearts of
his followers with flaming eloquence,
nor demand their support as pet OF
the masses. He can write well, and
he can make speech, but he is no
Demosthencs. In the hands of or can
didate he would be a mere plaything-
a baby to be spanked, not a man to b.
argued with. He Will aronse no en-
thusiasn in the breasts of the leaders
of the party who wished to see him
killed Off at Lynchburg. The canvass
will be hot. The voters Will be at the
ballot-box in November A new Leg
islature is to be elected. This last fact
insures Hughes defeat. Grant carried
Virginia last fall solely because of the
apathy of the voters west of the Blue
Ridge, who cared for neither candi-
date, and had no local candidates for
small offices to call them out. Hughes
will fall from fifteen to twenty thou
sand votes short of election. He rep
resents whatever i'll the political world
is hated by the real people of Virginia,
the Smiths, Seners, Wick
hams, Lewises, and others OF his own
party. It is written in the book of
fate that Robert "". Hughes will never
be Governor of Virginia."

substituted therefor. Some recToated themselves
by picnicH, excursioDF, DC, but the prevailing
amusement with us at present btse ball, whlch

by those engaged in the race t. come out victori-
Gus, but the greater the effort TO increase the speed
the greater the fall would be, aud the successful
ones were those that kept cool and travelled along
leisurely. Wheelbarow rolling was the next on
the programme which afforded considerable
amusement for the locker on. Everything passed
of very quietly, and every one seemed very well
pleased with the days jolhHcauon; not even q
single fisticuff occurred during the day.


Nothing has yet been heard from the escaped
prisoner, but the Sheriff is confident that he will
soon have the little wanderers safely within the
prison walls. II Is the general impression that
outside assistance was furnished the prisoners to
make their escape. as the iron bars were severed
with instruments intended TOR the purpose. A
pocket knife found in the cell after the priso-
ners escaped, which had been hacked on the
blade in the style of q saw, which was evidently
left there to lead the Sheriff to believe that they
had no outside help. Noises were heard on the
outside by the other prisoners during the night,
and West the negrO-Skinner, placed his bed
against his door to keep out intruders, thinking
their object was to lynch him, supposing them to
he party of negroes. B. T. L."

writing from MOntross, Nd, says


there is now a prospect OF the Great Falls water
power OF the Potomac river being fully and prac-
tcally developed for manufacturing purposes.
As ! am informed some enterprtslng men Of
Washington have taken the matter In hand with
the determination TO found and build great
manufacturing centre At and around this roman
tic and picturesque site. They will certainly
ind ample power, so far as advantageous fall
and now can give It. There Ia about ninety feet
descent within the scope Of the Great Falls prop
erty, with now OF over 9,aO0 cubic feet per
ceeds three months In the year) and which, a.
cotton mill men say, will run about 10000 looms
with 100000 spindles. About one twentieth

II II stated by knowing ones that every lOC
horsepower actually used In the manufacture OF
textile fabrics guarantees the accumulation OF
1000 population. And q this proposition be
correct, and these men should nobly proceed ""a
develop this vast water power, we may expect
at no very distant day a thriving city at the
Great Falls.


Iron and coal, the two great features Of the
manufacturing interests, Abundantly exist
along the lines Of railway soon TO connect with
this water power, and the Chesapeake and Ohio





ore is to be had at and around the Falls and
throughout the adjoining and adjacent counties
The Cumberland coal mines are directly con
nected by the canal, and as the Piedmont and
Potomac railroad, now about leading from
Washington, Ia, so am informed, TO cross al
the Great Fails, and thence TO Staunton, there
tapping the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad, the
Falls will be directly connected with the greai
kanawha coal region and the New river Iron
nelds, Us well as those Of Tennessee and Ken
lucky, and also Missouri.


There IL abundant ilne marble and granite, a
well as lnexhaustible supplies Of divers kind Of
building and paving stone at hand, also plenty
OF wood and timber.


The vast cotton, sugar, rice and tobacco neldi
Of the South and Southwest will be In direct
communication by way OF the connections with
the several lines OF railroad conyerglng at Rich
mond, and the connections via StauntOn, Char
lOttesville and Lynchburg, and by way OF watel
through the excellent harbOr at Washington.


We hope this enterprise will stimulate thu
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company TO estab
llsh an air line from some point on their Wash
ington branch via the Falls, thence through
Smokers Gap, not only connecting with thell
line from HArper's Ferry down the Shenandoah
river via Winchester, but on las nearly alOnI
parallel thlrty.nlnc as practicaD TO Grafton o
Pennington, whereby they can still shorten the
route West over one hundred miles. And u
seems that they will have to do this u they woult

Prospect for Their Recovery.",,"The Sufferers All Doing weii-A Good


Prospect for Their Recovery.


The terrible attempted family slaughter on
Thirteenth street yesterday morning, for the only
early Information Of which the public are in.
debted to the enterprise Of the REPUBLICAN,,
created considerable excitement throughout the
city, and the house was visited during yesterday
by many Of the friends Of the family, profferlns
their sympathies and services for the sufferers.
The following additional facts have been OBJ
taiued concerning the family:


II. Randolph Hargrove, the perpetrator Of the
deed, has, we are assured, ever horne the char
acter not only OF gentleman, hut has been a
klnd aud anectlonate husband and father. He
has been IN this city hut a few DAYS, stopping
with Mrs. Brown, hls wlfe's sister and in search
Of employment. The parties are known TO be
highly connected, lIafRroye being the son OF
John Randolph's sister, and his wife, one OF the
most accomplished ladies' Of the state Of Virginia
Neither Of the parties, although very seriously
cut, will probably die. Mr.. HarRrove was taken
and his wife and child remain At her sisters.


II may be interesting TO state that In the effort
to kill himself he first, with his pocket-knife cut
and then stuck the knife into the side Of his neck
lust anterior and touching tho carotid artery,
barely escaping instantaneous death, and left the
knife sticking there, to he drawn out by one oi
the policeman.


Insanity seems to be somewhat hereditary In
the family, as the brother Of the above, q despe.
rate lunatlc, shot himself at Lynchburg, virginia,
the day after the surrender Of Lee.


Altogether, this Ia one OF the most painful and
distressing occurrences that has ever come with.
In our knowledge. Here Ia seen a man OF a dis
tngulshed family, good intellect, refined culture
and only thirteen years ago In afiluent circuIn
stances, Just then married to his accomplished

deeds is black chapter in the wide chronicle

were committed that the law was not

had also an execution, and the narrative

available means have been used TO secure
the arrest of Lynch.


The later and fuller accounts of the
killing Of Dennis Mccormick at Black foot
indicate it was an unprovoked and cold

vigilant care in cases Of homicides, where
there any doubts Of malice or the deed, in

About the time he suspended business in the val ley, he stole a COW and otherwise de- ported himself against the statutes of this Territory in such way that it was believed none but lynch la W would ever be meted to him. So they gave him full dose of that. It's a bad way to hang man without legal process, but when legal process will not hang men who deserve to be, citi- zens sometimes lose their patience or get to laboring under fits of ""emo- tional insanity"" and string up cul- prit or two.

Hurd. on Claiborne street. last evening.
Their object was to witness a series OF ex-
periments BY Mr.. S. S. Baldwin. in conse-
quence Of notice Of some similar perform
ances in The Times. Mr.. Baldwin stated
that he was not prepared to assign cause
for the phenomena he should exhibit. and,
indeed. could not explain it. He only
knew that certain conditions must be OBJ
served. The party were requested to view
a darkened room in which there was an ar
moir filled with clothing, small bed, two
chairs. two small tables on which were
three bells. q guitar. tamborine, etc. The
doors were sealed. go that they could not
be opened. Tits room was to be used IN
stead of the ordinary cabinet.


committee were appointed. who tied
Mr.. Baldwin and another young gentleman.
The company then left them IN darkness,
and the doors were locked. The musical
instruments were played on and the bells
rung. Afterward the knots were found
intact. They were left alone again, and
presented themselves united. Mr.. Baldwin
then put the young gentlemen into trance,
and they were locked upi in darkness. When
the doors le. the spectators in again they
were found securely tied. much better than
the committee could tie them. On being
put in darkness again the musical irstru-
ments were played on. one OF the gentle
men placed in his chair on table, and
accurate tests showed that the other had
not moved hairs breadth.


The doors OF examination showed posi-
lively that they had not been opened. The
tying was intact. Other means than visible
hands mus. have performed these things.
and there was no trace Of anything. The
letter test was then tried. ""Uniicaticn""
was the answer to question 20 r. E. Lee.
Other questions were answered. One gen.
tleman who has bad Pelagie Brown on the
brain for some time asked where she was.
This question being unanswered he was
highly elated. and declared that the Cir
cumstance was proper evidence before
Judge Lynch to prove she was alive.


All this was done with the two gentlemen
tied in the most secure manner. and Mr..
Baldwin in the front room. Then the doors
were closed for the last time, opened in
sixty seconds and the ropes were on the
floor. All present could only say they
knew Of no mortal explanation for the e1-
peliments, but thanked Mr.. Baldwin for
his exhibition. which he promised to repeat,
bade good night to the courteous doctor
and Mr.. Hurd. and went home in perfect
daze of bewiidered speculation."

 On Wednesday morning, B. F. Pat terson, who lives about three miles from town, missed his COW, which had been tied, the night before, a short distance from his house. The cow had evidently been stolen, as the rope with which she was tied had been cut and she had then been driven towards the river by a man on horseback. The COW and driver were tracked through various circuitous windings to Phenix and within three hundred yards of the butcher shop of Refugio Subiate, where were found the head and hide of Patterson's COW and fresh beef just killed. Subiate said he had pur- chased the COW from Mariana Tisnado, before daylight. This Tisnado is the Mexican to whom was traced the ring of the murdered Griffin, to which l referred in @ former letter, and who could not account for how he came by it. Tisnado and Subiate were inn mediately arrested and taken before Justice M. P. Griffin for preliminary examination. The trial of the former came off first and he made no defense, but said that the testimony was all true. The principal witnesses against him were Subiate and his wife. Though the day was extremely warm, during the continuance of the exami- nation, courthouse was full of men, deeply interested in the result. Tis- nado was bound over to appear be- fore the district court for trial. His bail was fixed at $1 ,000 and in default of giving bonds, he was committed to prison. Subiate's examination was set for the next day-the Sd. During the remainder of the day, and till late in the evening, the streets were un- usually crowded with men, calm and quiet, yet looking earnest and de- termined. The sheriff, T. c. Hayes, fearing that an effort would be made to lynch the prisoner, slept in the jail all night. On Thursday morning, July 3, everything was uncommonly quiet. The only noticeable feature was the great influx of farmers from down the valley, up the valley and across the river, all armed to the teeth, all civil and not making as much noise as two drunken men will ordi- narily do. A short time before nine o'clock, being on the street, saw the mass going toward the courthouse square. At half-past six I again went out and asked what the excitement was? A man answered, Nothing, 1t is all over!"" I asked ""where?"" He said ""down around Monihon's cor rall :"" I then proceeded to the spot indicated, the gate of the corral of Monihon & Starrar, facing on Cortes street, where the man Mariana Tis- nado was hanging by the neck, per- fectly dead, with the shackIes still on his feet The crowd had left before I arrived, so that I saw only an occa- sional curiosity gazer, like myself. The Americans raised money to pay the expenses of burying the man, but the Mexicans begged the privilege of burying him and refused to accept the money. The coroner, Geo. A. Will Hams, held an inquest over the body, after which 1t was turned over to his friends for burial.

 The examination of Refugio Su- plate was then had, which resulted in his acquittal, though he consented to pay Patterson for his COW which he had refused to do the evening before."

During the absence OF this committee Mr.. d.

proposition OF political temperance movement,
but was decidedly OF the opinion tnat something
hhould be done at once to check the traiflc IN

Mr. j. d. Dunulng thought some who knew
him TO be an ardent total abstinence man might
he surprised to hear him say that he was opposed
10 this action at the present time.


No ORGANIZATION AND NO MONEY.


There was neither time nor money now ""a

his opinion, only weaken the cause by an cN.

rapacious rule OF the carpet-bnggers. As n
natural consequence the material interests
of the State exhibit degree of prosperity
which is in decided contrast with the
povcrty-stricken condition of those South
ern States in which the GRANT Republi-
cans have sway. But the Federal Office
holders think that Virginia has enjoyed
too much freedom for state which is dis
loyal TO the present occupant OF the White
House, and us n general election Is mp
preaching the Administration Is preparing
to make desperate efforts TO capture the
State Government.


In 1869 GiLBERT c. WALKER, the Con-
servative candidate for Governor, was
elected by majority of 1881. In the
Legislature the Conservatives now have a
majority of 50 on joint ballot, and there
Is no doubt that they have a very large
majority of the legal voters In the State,
Notwithstanding that through various
causes majority OF 1,sl4 was secured for
GRAST at the Presidential election. New
erthelcss, orders have been gwen i'm WASH
ington that the State must be carried for
the Administration ut all hazards, aud II il
safe to predict that some extraordinary
novelties in elcctioneering will be wit
messed before the campaign Is over.
The Republican Convention TO nominate
state officers will meet in Lynchburg on
July 80; the Conservative Convention Is
to be held in Richmond on August G. Much
speculation has been INDUCED in regarding
the probable choice by the Republican Con-
vention of its candidate for Governor, but
ii is generally understood that ROBERT w.
HUGuEs is the man favored Mt the White
House, though ii is semi-ofiicially anuounc-
ed that the President will graciously refrain
from interfering in the preliminary contest
There was some talk of the Republicans
putting II sNRy A. WISE forward, nominally
as an independent candidate, WISE having
pledged himself 10 support GRANT in all
things; hut the project has fallen through.
We suppose il was thought that Gov. WISE
would poll great colored vote on account
of his having been such Il good friend 10
JouN BRowS. The most prominent candi-
date for the Conservative nomination is
| Gen. KEMPER.


Although the Government organs have
announced that the Administration viii
not interfere in the choice of candidates
by the Republican Convention, IL is boldly
declared that the Government will inter
fere in the election, and use every legt-
mate means TO secure the success of the
Republican ticket Aud legitimate means
of influencing elections, as understood
and practised under GRASr's Admiuistrn-
ton, include every imaginable species Of
ballot-Dox stufling, repcdtlng, and fdlsit-
cation of returns, with bribery and in
tmidation wherever practicable. Already
II l. said that SrooR RoBESoN Is filling NJ
the Norfolk Navy Yard with workmcn
employed with special reference to the ap-
preaching election, and il IL to bc pre-
sumcd that the marked ballots SO effectively
used at Mare Island and Portsmouth Will
also be brought into requistion here.


In the mean time the President organs
arc cndeavoring TO whecdle the Nirglniuus
into support of tue Abrams ration can
didates. The Washington ChrpHiclC the
dirticst as well as the most shameless OF
subsidized prints has the impudcnce to
say that il will depend upon Virginia =
elcctIng the Administration candidates
whether OF not the United States Govern
mcnt will complete the James River and
Kunawha Canal at the public expense.
These are the words Of this br1zen avowal





tions are those ot punilc works and popular
cducatiun. The most popular among the public
Ks Of the state - the CouIlI""ilOn Of the
canal, aud strong hopes are entertained that the
national GoNefumcnt viii assume cuHrge OF this
important measure, II Is not unreasonable To
conclude that the national GpNCrnincut Will tc
more apt to consider fnVurthly such ""A PROPOSE
auspices than II 1t remain under sectional
control


Even IL the Administration had the
power 10 fulnl such promises us these, tho
people of Virginia, unless the race has
sadly degcncratcd, would spuin such n
hTibe for the surrender of their political
rights.


Unfortunately there are questions rClat-
ing 10 railroads and other local affairs
which are likely 20 interfere with harmuui-
Gus action on the part Of the Conservatives.
No true man will permit such cousidern-
tions 10 divert his attention from the great
question at stake III Virginia, the right OF
self-Sovernment. The Presidents mouth
pieces proclaim that the Republican part y
Twill challenge the approval OF the people
on the whole subject of the reconstruction
policy"" of the Administration. That policy
is best illustrated in Arkansas in South
} Carolina, and in Louisiana. II the Con-
servatives permit themselves to be divided
by the introduction of veXntious local
issues, the same policy Will likewise be
illustrated in Virginia.

cordance with the feeling Of the country. Mr. Dun
nell, OF Minnesota, said he had been directed 10

ion; therefore he should sustain the minority BILL


Mr.. Grassland, OF Kentucky, wac the next man
who amused the House by his observations. He
boldly declared that the great CRY raised about the
grab was made by those who wanted our seats.
He took the incre ased pay and couldn't return IL II
ne would and, SO help him God, he wouldn't II ne
could, which asser t0n was received with shouts OF
laughter. He paid his respects to Mr. Cox, wnom
he designated as his friend Dew Drop"" After
stating that Cunset mad been the author OF great
deal OF wise and good legislation In Congress
he said he would read one OF the bills OF which the
gentleman was the author. He then quoted an
order introduced by Mr.. Cox changing the name OF
the ship ""Industry'' to civilian H. Tweed"" This
was the sign for general uproar, which continued
for many minutes. Was this the ship, he asked, that
was to transport our ""Dew Drop to Europe last
spring. When Mr.. Crossland's time had expired
the desire to have the fun continue was 80
great that he was allowed to proceed, say
ing to Mr. Hale that he never had addressed
the House before and never would again II tha3
gentleman would give way. And 30 he rambled on
in a disconnected manner until he came TO con-
slider the case OF the economical gentleman from
Ohio, who not only had his likeness placed In the
New York election frauds report, but had nice
ram kept at the Agricultural Department. the
whole Of one winter at the expense oil the govern
menL and also had its picture engraved and
bound in the agricultural report Of that year. Mr.,
Grassland held up the report in question, and the
House fairly roared with laughter.


Mr.. Hale here arose to call the previous question.
but rave way to Mr.. Maynard to offer few re-
marks about the law relating to the pay OF de-
ceased members and to Mr.. Lawrence, OF Ohio,
who wished to extricate himself from his unfor-
tunate dilemma. The Judge read written ex-
PLANTATION OF his position, claiming that he had
been misrepresented. He said that che gov
ernment did not pay for the likeness shown
to the House on Tuesday by Mr.. Lamison and
that it was only bound In Q lew copies OF the re-
port in question. He lodged the ram matter by
saying that it was presented by friend, who n-
sisted that the picture should be placed In the re-
port with the other engravings. He excused his
taking back pay in 1866 by declaring that the peo-
pie did not oppose 1t then but do at the present
time. The Judge was laughed at a good deal by
the members, who evidently thought that his ex-
PLANTATION was little thin.


Judge Orth then offered q substitute providing
that the bill should be recommitted ard amended
80 as to repeal the whole OF the salary act, lar
as the constitution would permit, and practically
place the salary at $4,000. The previous question
being demanded the House refused to second the
demand, and, after much parliamentary sparring,
the question was postponed by adjournment until
tomorrow.


The Senate Committee ON Transporta-


tion Routes to the Soaboard.


During the last recess OF Congress the Senate
Committee on Transportation Routes to the Sea-
board travelled together, or as sub-committees an
aggregate for one person OF over 10000 miles and
were engaged in the collection OF statistics &C.,
an aggregate for one person Of over 365 days. The
total expenditures OF the committee for travelling,
hotel bills and all other personal expenses have
amounted to $4,459 rs. The purpose OF the appli-
cation for leave to hold sessions and travel during
the coming recess, which was asked by the
chairman (Mr. Windom) and unanimously granted
by the Senate to-day is to enable the committee to
visit New orleans and other points in the South,
in iurtherance OF the work for which 1t was
created. The committee viii leave Washington as

The Senate Judiciary Committee to Re.


port Favorably for Mr.. williams.


Mt the next executive session OF the Senate, the
Committee on Judiciary will make favorable re-
port on the nomination OF George II. Williams to

The Civil Rights Convention.


In the National Civil Rights Convention to-day,
Mr.. Melord Of Virginia, said that there was class
of colored men in this city who are not willing to
accord to coored men the same rights as are ac-
corded by white men. He was opp sed TO any
measure offered by man who Is unwilling to ac-
cord such rights t. ALL Proprietors OF barber
shops and saloons in Washington, run by colored
men, do not allow colored men to enter their
places OF business He wanted the right, when he
felt like going into barroom to take a drink, 20
do it, and not to be told by the barkeeper that he
has no liquor.


The Civil Rights Committee Recommend


Mr.. summers Bill.


The Committee on Civil Rights submitted re-
port tonight recommending the passage or Mr..
Summers bill, or Its equivalent. Debate on the
report was commenced by Colonel Robert Harlan,
OF Ohio who advocated the passage Of the Civil
Rights bill, but questioned the propriety OF asking
special privileges. The session was remarkably
quiet and orderly.


Deieg cations to the Civil Rights Conven-


tion Visit the President.


The Missouri delegation attending the Civil
Rights Convention and headed by Representative
Stannard, the Mississippi delegation headed by
Representative Lynch, and the Virginia and other
coored delegations, called in separate bodies to-
day upon the President and had interviews with
him. Alter leaving the Presidents oflce they
expressed themselves as well satisfied with what
he said TO them.


The New York Delegates 10 the Colored


Convention ON . Round OF Visits.


The New York delegation Of the National Civil
Rights Convention, now In session here, headed by
Professor Reason, called on Senators Conkling and

ance that they are favorable to the passage OF a
supplementary civil rirhts bill

atives in the House, and received satisfactory
promises from them.

travelling expenses, but no postage. &c. Mr..
Lynch made very sensible speech. He thought
that the southern people did not object to in
creased pay, but back pay He hoped his amend
ment would be adopted and then the members Of
all sections could shake hands across the 'bloody
chasm.""


The House was now getting weary. IL had had
suriett OF back pay, and when Mr.. 0'Brien, Of
Maryland, arose to give his views upon the subject
there was much uneasness manifested. The only
noteworthy thing which he said was that the old
salary was enough. 1t was not intended
that members should bring their wives, their
daughters or their nieces to the capital
to be supported. He got along very well without
his, and he thought other members might DO
without theirs. This astonishing sentiment did not
seem to shock the House, because, as one gentle
man suggested, they knew how 1t was themselves.
A motion to adjourn was now made and carried,
and thus ended the first days discus
sion or the salary grab. IL was very
exciting session at times, and Indicated q more
conservative feeling upon the subject than was
supposed to exist 1t Is yet too early to Judge how
the House win vote upon the measure; but the
virtuous eleventh hour men will not ind the re-
peal as plain sailing as they anticipated.


The Storage and Cleansing Of Rice.


Representative Potter was before the Committee
OF ways and Means to-day advocating the bill he
introduced to establish q bonded warehouse for
storing and cleansing rice intended Tor exporta-
ti0n. Rice Is now cleansed in England for the
market, and there is no reason why it should not
be done In this country.


The Senate Ways and Means Committee


Have q Talk.


The Senate Committee on Finance and the House
Committee on Banking ana Currency each had
M inn lN,vfu tnnlr ocfiQ
the sessions being devoted to a preliminary inter-
change OF general views on the part OF various
members


The Purchase OF the Louisville and Port
land Canal-A Hitch ut the Treasury
Once.


The Secretary OF the Treasury to-day sent to the
Senate reply to a former resolution OF that body
concerning the Louisville and Portland Canal. AS
the case now stands the Board OF Directors are
authorized by the Legislature of Kentucky and
stand ready to transfer the work and all its rights
titles, franchises, &c. to the United States upon
payment by the latter Of about 900 for bonds
stocks and current debts. The Secretary Of the
Treasury under the legislation Of Congress is au-
thorzed to receive the transfer and make the pay
ments, but that officer having certain discretion
allowed him in respect to both the time and the
manner Of carrying out the provisions of the law,
hesitates to act In view of the large sum Of money
necessary, and while hesitating receives infor-
nation OF certain suits at law instituted by claim
ants (hers OF devsees) which involve the titles to
the very lands through which the canal runs
Democratic Caucus-Senat0r Thurman
the Nominee for Temporary President
of the Senate.


The democratic Senators held caucus this
afternoon and passed the following resolutions
First-That it ia the sense OF this caucus that
democratic members should
for candidate for the presidency OF the Senate
pro telpore who represents the political princi-


Second-That the Hon. Allen G. Thurman, OF
Ohio, be the nominee OF the democratic members
OF the Senate 1or the ohice OF President OF the
Thtrd-That the action OF this caucus be made
known to the Senate by Hon. J. w. Stevenson, OF
Kentucky, and that he nominate Senator Thur
man for the office In question.


This action was taken by the democratic caucus
without any knowledge OF who would be the nomi-
nee Of the republican caucus, and without refer
ence to any individual.


The National convention OF Colored


Citizens.


The National Convention OF Colored Citizens,
which assembled in the Hall OF the House OF Dele
gates to-day, comprises leading men OF the race
from all parts of the country Two or three hun
dred delegates were present. The call for this
Convention emanated from the Pennsylvania Equal
Rights League organized in 1854 and asks OF Con-
gress q civil rights bill, ''with such penalties
as will teach humanity to the imbruted,
and compel the tyrant to loose his
hold the poor and STILL forever, the assumptions
based alone on color.u The Philadelphia platform
and that portion OF the Presidents inaugural
address relating to civil rights, painted canvas.
were posted on the wall on either side of the plat
form.


Hon. R. B. Elliott, OF South Carolina was selected
tam rhoir md
Credentials was appointed. No further business
was done before the recess.


Massachusetts DisafYected.


The Massachusetts opposition is beginning to
develop itself. Sumner, while avowedly neutral,
criticises the diplomatic action on the virgnus
case without reserve; and Dawes, now that he 1s
safely installed as chairman Of the House Commit
tee on Ways and Means is renewing his unpleas-
ant criticisms OF three years since. The elder Hoar
feels sighted that he was not rendered the Chief
Justiceship, and his younger brother has some dirty
linen to wash, left on his hands since the last eec
tion in the Bay State. Depend upon 1t, Massachu-
setts is too suppy nucleus around which the dis
affected can rally.


Telegraph Between the Departments and


the Capitol.


The establishment OF a line OF teegraphs connect
ing the departments with the Capitol is the initial
step towards the establishment OF national lines.


Scandal ON the Tapi


The gossips are whispering about new scandal
involving the character OF Official here, which
is soon to be proclaimed and made the base OF
operations for an attempt to rotate him out OF
once.


Rumorcd Resignation OF Governor Bur.

1t is said that Governor Burbank has sent in his

President.

The address briefly alludes to the numerous
evils OF intemperance, Us they affect our Dis

traffic has invaded the caucuses Of all polIti-

next to impossible for the temperance ele-

These facts have compelled those who be-
lieve that this traffic should be the subject of
restraint by Legislative enactment 90 take the
bold and decided stand OF nominating candi-
dates Of their own, pledged to such legisla-
ton as shall amount TO prohibition, or the
holding Of the seller responsible for oil
damages resulting from his sales. The ad-

throughout the ceremony.


The services were opened with appropriate prayer
by the Rev. w. W. Knox, wherein he sought tho Divine
blessing upon all afflicted friends, and prayed that
all bitter thoughts might be far removed that all souls
might be cleansed from bitter human passions. The
Rev. T. W. Terry OF the NJ L. Church Of Cold Spring
then read the Goth Psalm, after which he Immediately
entered upon a fitting address. The occasion of this
gathering he said one OF great public interest

grace Of God would buoy them up the very worst
trials TO which human beings were heir. There was one
unfang source OF consolation through which every
trial might be sustained with that forttude which was
ever felt by those who put their trust in God.


The Rev. W. w. Knox, the pastor OF the church 10
which Mr. Kelsey belonged, then delivered an address
substantially follows: Words entirely made

ELECTION. ~ ~ H&


Two or three months ago, one Martin Eagan,
who was arrested on charge OF melting par
tics to disorderly conduct, and hned $lO and
costs, petitioned Council to return him the
amount of fine and costs, about S12s claiming
that he had been Illegally arrested. ,Ihis petl-
ton was referred to the Law Committee, who,
at the meeting of Council; last evening, re-
ported faY0rably upon IT,


The circumstances of the case, as stated by
officer Whalen, are as fOllOwsi:--On the night
in question, Eagan and party OF friends two
or three of whom had just arrived from the
old country, were going along Fourth street,
somewhat intoxicated, and making consider
able noise. At the corner OF Poplar street,
officer Whalen informed them that they must
be quiet, or he would have to arrest them!
Eagan then flared up, denying the right Of the
officer to arrest any of the party, ana defylng
him to make the attempt, fhe balance OF the
party seemed to take the words of Eagan, as
nn assurance that they could make as much
noise, as they pleased, and SO continued their
disorderly conduct on their way down Fourth
street. .fse ftt4'


Officer Whalen, accompanied by officer Nc
G0nigal, then attempted to arrest two OF the
party, but, assisted by their friends, they made



McGonigal getting quite severely handled and
beaten with his own club, during the melee.
Finding that it was impossible TO make the
arrest by fol eibe means, the othcers resOrted
to subterfMge. Accordingly, they held on to
two meIR and invited Eagan who had been
standing by ali the time 70 90 along and go
security for thetwO prisoners. Ohcer Whe-
Ian also invited the others OF the party to go
also, so that they could""ali so home together"" =""
Ali hands consented to this arrangement, and
on arriving atthe City Hail. the entire party
was put into the cells, and kept there until
morning, when they were tried, fnedand ls'


Officer Whalen also says that he called upon
VIM. Ward, No. 715 Church street, who was
loOker-on, for assistance, but that, Eagan
threatened him, and told him to walk on, which
he did. 10 ,.i1 L.. tiil - li


Eagan, as above stated petitioned Council
to refund his fine setting forth that he was IN :
nocent, that he endeav0red to diSsuade his
companions from making any disturbance and
trouble, and that the arrest was an outrage. -
The petition was referred to the Committee
on Law, who held meeting, at which Eagan
and two witnesses Sappearedand state d their side
of thelQuestiOn. Officer Whalen also appear
ed, but declined to make any statements from
the fact that he had already given in his evil
dence, ander oath, before The Mayor. The
Committee then prepared report, In favor OF
g ranting Eagan's petition.


After the reading of the report, at the meet
ing of Council last evening, Mr Flnegan arose
and opposed it. He said that the case had been
tried before the Mayor, and decided on the
strength of sto0Tn evidence. The Mayors
Court was the proper tribunal for the settle
ment OF the case, and the Council has no right
to refund the fine. 1t Is an unjust interference
with the Mayors duties, and = reflection on
the judgement of that officer 1t Is a bad pre-
cedent, aud there Is no knowing where it may
stop. The whole thing is a political move, to
secure the votes of the parties interested and
their friends.


Mr. Plckels denied any political cOnsidera'
tiOns in the settlement OF the affair, and de-
nounced the charge as an unmitigated insult.
He believed that Eagan has been illegally i'm
prisOned and wrongly dealt with, and that the
least Council could do, would be TO refund him
his money. 49,.


Mr.. Finegan said that Mayor SImms would
not impose an unjust fine, and that he had
more confidence in the Judgement of the May
or, than In the Judgment of the Committee
on Law. He insisted that it was political
move


Mr.. Pickles insisted that the man had been
unjustly dealt with and decoyed to the hall.
Mr.. McIntire. opposed the report, on the
ground that Council has no Jurisdiction in the
matter An appeal from the Mayors decision
must be taken to Court.


Mr.. Lynch thought 1t would be we'll to post
pOne the subject for consideration. 5t-.,


After some further discussion, the report Oi
the committee was adopted

will quietly submit to the DEGREES OF a


bastard Judge of bastard court, created


by a bastard Legislature? Now. upon


what authority does the Pjcdycc's pro-


nounce these arrogant and offensive opln-


ions? Upon that OF the Senate committee


report? Here is an extract affirming that


authority. 1t is used to demonstrate the


illegality of the State government, and OF


a tribunal created under it. Speaking OF


the Senate committee report the Picdytne


says:


All the members of that committee in
| their preliminary report agreed with re-
| markable unanimity that the Kellogg gov.
! ernment was simply usurpatlon. without
| foundation in law. They unanimously de-
ciared that the Lynch returning board
| never had the official returns of the eiec.
| ton before them and never had any legal
| or competent evidence before them to en-


able them to declare what the results OF
| that election were. In their complete
| report the same statement Is reiterated.
1t is then asked. 'why do our people,


with these two reports (the majority and


minority reports of the Senate commlttee)


before them, continue to endure that


monstrous party creation. the Superior
| District Court Here, then, this report Is


of such high authority that even before Its
| confirmation or discussion by Congress,


the people and bar OF New Orleans are


called on to repudiate an existing State IN
stitution upon the divided dicta OF fed
| eral Senate committee! This combination
Of subservient obedience to the central
consolidation, with popular notification
of State law, is curious fusion, or
amalgam of extremely opposite doctrines,
But in this diatribe against the Supreme
and Superior District Courts Of the State.
this Senate committee report is evidently
set up as an authority sufficiently high to
crafty popular notification. or disobe-
dience to law.


To indicate the impartiality Of its cen
sure, the Picayou,s next lashes Mr.. Tex
ada for having dared to introduce in the
body of gentlemen assembled at Odd Eel
lows Hall, resolution approving and
indorsins the new election proposed by
the report of the committee of the Senate
of the United States"" After canvasslng
''the statement and reasoning OF these
resolutions as 'loo5e and unsatisfactory III
the extreme"" the Picay,me summons poor
Mr.. Texada upon the charge OF having ad-
mitted that the Senate committee ''have
reported that there is no State govern
ment at present existing in louisiana;


and thus the same committee report, which
was set up in another column as an au-
thority to justify q nulliication Of State
law, il now dismissed as unworthy Of
credence because it asserts what the
| Picdvlne states to be untrue. Thus
the authority of this report, which was
supreme in one column, is nullifed by
the Picayme az unworthy credence in
| another. But if this report does not bind
Mr.. Te1ada or the Pjcoytne. why should
it bind Judge Hawkins? And if il bind
Judge Hawkins, why should it be sus-
pended at the breath of the Picoyu.e? !?
The Picoyu0e having therefore stripped
Mr.. Telada of the fragile protection af-
forded by the report, draws through its
terocious fingers its editorial ""cat o nine
tails, still reeking from the tiagellation Of
a Republican offender, and thus applies If
TO the shrinking epidermiS Of the un-
happy Fusionist. ''We ask him, then, if
he believes there is no State government
in Louisiana? If he does. why has be
been in the city for the last six weeks
Now we submit that any gentleman has
right to come TO New Orleans and remain
any number of weeks without a pass from
the Pic1yltne. The culprit Texada is not
allowed to quote from the columnS Of the
fagellator that ''the Kellogg government
was an usurpation without founda-
tior in law as an evidence that the
opinion of the committee was of au
tlority. The Pjcayue can use the
report in that sense. but poor VeXada can
not. ""HOw,"" asks the lictor, 'has he
dared assume the functions OF a member OF
the Legislature to which he now ac-
knewledges he has had no right whatever!
VIII he say he was elected a member but
has been stripped of his position by the
report of the committee"" 4 by-stander
might have thought the Senate committee
had the same right TO strip Mr.. Texada Of
his position as to turn out Judge Hawkins
from the bench. Leaving, however, Mr..
Te1ada shivering, metaphorically. IN his
shirt-tail, the Picayuoe turns to the crowd
and saws. again. we ask. where does the
committee where does Congress itself de-
rive the authority to pass upon his right
or question the validity OF his election:
OF course, none dared respond 10 one who
holds the law in one hand and the scourge
in the other, but the echo comes from the
columns in which the validity of the COM
m;ttee repor: is maintained, why do our
people. with these two iSenate) reports
before them, continue TO endure that
mons.roUs party creation, the District

rnuK VERSION or rnAr RENcoxrEl",,"TRUK VERSION OF THAT RENcoNTEE


The late duel in vhginia has revived interest
In the MasOn-McCarty duel Or ism, one party 70
which was an uncle Of Mr.. Page McCarty, who
killed his antagonist lately near Richmond. The
Lynchburg P'ryi'idn gives thefOliOwing account
of the oldtime duel:


'In the first place neither Mason nor McCarty
were in Congress at the time Ot the occurrence
the latter never was a member. Nor was Nc
Carty, who submitted the desperate proposition
TO jump oil the capitol with his adversary, or 70
at with him On a Geg Of powder, which, when ex-
ploded, would send them both into etonlty, the
challenger. Tho facts are briefly these; Gen. Ma
sou was the challenger, and pursued Col. McCarty
until he consented 10 meet him. They were
first cousins, and the quarrel was purely political
Mason being democrat and McCarty Of the then
opposition party


""The latter, though a man of reckless courage,
did not want TO fight his kinsman, but when con
vinced that nothing less than blood would ap-
pease the wrath of Mason, submitted such pro
positions as would, iG accepted, result fatally 10
both, and spare him the pain Of shedding ,kins-
mans blood. These propositions being spurned,
McCarty was at length induced to yield to the
wishes of Mason, and accepted the challenge to
meet him with hostile weapons lie chose mus
/ ketR aud demanded that The combatants should
stand but twelve feet apart, so that the muZzes OF
their weapons would almost meet In such a
desperate encounter both parties expected Of
course to fail. McCarty was saved as by mira
Gle, the bali from Mason's mnsket striking the
muZzle of his gun, glaneing along the barrel and
tearing oil portion Of the stock, which laceratei
his arm severely, but produced no ether injury -
Mason fell dead


lit il due 10 Col McCarty TO say that, though
he survived many years, he never vaunted the
fine quality of his valor,' nor behaved otherwise
than as gentleman who was deeply afflicted with
the memory of an act that he tried by every
means that he thought honorable TO avoid. He
was a man Of imposing appearance, and when
we saw him. many years after this occurrence,
he was neither a 'onearmed dTunkard' nor bTag
CART. Tho facts relative to this melancholy event
we have oflen heard rected by those conversant
with them, and have read an account of the duel
in SabIne's Notes on duels and dueling, although
that account is not accurate. As tins duel occur
red on the 9th of February, 1919 it is hardly pos
sible that longhaired plantation persons, With
heavy reyolVefs beneath their coattails, stood
transtixed with admiration at the conduct of Nc
Carly for revolvers were not known in those days;
they were invented long afterwards, and We are
indebted to q New England Yankee, Colonel Colt,
for that discovery, which has since been the pro-
li6c cause of so much unnecessary blOodshed,"

yesterday afternoon and two trotting races came
OF. The attendance was small, the weather being
rather too cold for this kind OF sport, and as the
horses want rest and recuperation the past having
been a severe season for most OF them.


The nrst trot called yesterday was for a sweep
stakes OF $500, between John Murphy's chestnut
mare Louise, w. +. Weeks sorrel selding Sorrel
Jake and NJ. McNamaras bay gelding Billy Lynch
Louise the favorite previous to the start, Dut
Sorrel Jake won the first heat easily that the
betting changed in his favor. aud he then had the
call over the field. Louise won the second heat by
a head and she was again the iavorite over the
field. The third was a dead heat, and the mare
still kept her place in the betting, but at increased
ODDS 10 to being current. She won the fifth
heat and the race very cleverly Billy Lynch being
second for the first time) SOrrel Jake third


The second trot was mile heats, best three IN
five, under the saddle, for match Of $780, between
John Murphys bay gelding Charley Green and w.
F. Weeks gray geiding Tanner Boy. Green was
the favorite when brought on the track, with John
Murphy on his back, at to 1. 1t was discovered,
alter scoring a lew times, that Charley Green was
no saddle horse, and he was then taken out and
put in harness. Many pools were sold on Tanner
Boy under the belief that he could beat Charley
Green under the saddle, and these people strenu-
ously protested against the change OF way OF
going, and they were right The horse should not
have been allowed to go IN harness. Sucn prece-
dents as these will lead TO additional frauds and
complications on the trotting turf, as match

box stuffed in his favor he could take his horse
out OF the wagon, put a saddle on him and
90 on and win the money. Tanner Boy beat Char
ley Green very easily the first heat, and this
seemed 10 appease his hackers. Tanner Boy won
the second heat easily as he did the first, and
this sent HIM up in the betting trile. but still
Charley Green had the call. This seemed strange
TO the unsophisticated until the horses were given
the word, when Tanner Boy was pulled TO break,
giving Charley Green lead lar enough to win.
Charley went on and led home 40 yards in front Of
Tanner Boy. The result OF this heat astonished
even the most braZen faced sharper on the track.
It was generally conceded that Tanner Boy had
won all the heats tnat he could on TINS occasion,
and the race had to be won by Charley Green. The
set in the trot had to be postponed until Monday
next at two O'Clock in the afternoon. The follow

DR.. Lynch, Bishop OF Charleston, ascended
the pulpit and. having read the Gospel OF the DAY,
said that he would not speak on the great mystery
which the Church commemorated-the mystery OF
the Holy Trinity-but lie would say a lew words in
relation to the Holy Father. The grafton was
pregnant with historic lore and vivid pictures OF
what was achieved by the Roman pcnti1s in by
gone times. He alluded in very feeling terms to
the present Pope and was dignifcdly severe on


Tue LAWS or GERMANY,


which deprive Catholics of religious liberty. To do
justice to the discourse IL would be necessary to
report IL in full. From age to age the faithful have
substantially manifested their unity by supporting
the Holy see but never before did theather OF the
faithful make SO powerful or so tenuer an appeal
to the charity OF his children than he did on this
OCCASION. He appealed to them under circum.
stances OF heartrending Affections, which forcibly
call TO mind the ierce struggles OF the Church in
its earliest existence. Long centuries ago the ma
tions We're plunged into the depths Of paganism,
and the world fun OF t0llies and disorders and
inlquities. Everything was in confusion and men
worshipped images or metal and stone. In the
midst OF this disqualification the supreme God sent
His beloved son to recall men from their evil ways
and to leave behind Him theeholy Church to be the
guide of man until the end of time. Then the king
doms and empires


ARRAYED THEMSELVES AGAINST


this Church; national pride combated her in her
onward march. We know the history Of the for
midabe struggles which she was compelled to un-
dergo during the first three centuries The man
who sal upon the imperial throne OF Rome lifted
his arm against her; and, long and fierce though
the struggle was, she never let fall the banner OF
the cross. Constantine himself became q Chris

could yield nothing to error, and her career
was one OF lncessant conquest. Amid all these
struggles against the powers OF darkness there
was one prominent individual who stood forth
the pastor OF the Universal Church. The very first
successor or Christ, after having Witnessed the
beheading OF Paul, was singled cut for destruction;
and, in sight OF the Seven Hills he was crucfed,
like his Master. In the sixth persecution, which
was the hitherto most bloody, the cruel Emperor

through the caves beneath the ground, to annihi-
late them, to destroy the Pont and to prevent the
election OF a successor. DeciuS would rather have
a
cessor 70 the fisherman. And for two long years
the clergy were unable to come together but they
at length bsfied the designs OF their enemies and
kept intact the line OF pontiffs. From that day to
the present how many pious popes have there not
been cast into prison or sent into exile for their
Jealous laborsl But, despite ali opposition, the
banner OF truth which was raised on tile day OF
Pcntecost has never yet gone down. In this our
own day the Supreme Pontlf has witnessed the
establishment OF new empire IN the promulga-
tion Of laws equal to those OF


JULIAN THE APosTATE.


And even Italy, the land which ought to be the
protector OF the pastor, has had hand in wrest-
ing from him his little dominion. That dominion
Was only a small portion Of Italy, and
Italy is but small part or Europe. Its
government was the most ancient in existence,

they were fed and warmed by captain Wilnamson,

WASHINGTON, Feb. 25.-The President sent the fol-
lowing message to Congress to-day:


To ue Senate and House Of Representatives.: Your at
tention is respectfully invited the condition OF affairs
in the State of Louisiana. Grave complications have
grown out Of the election there the 9th Of November
last chiefly attributable, it is believed TO organized
attempt on the part Of those controlling the election OIL
GERS and returns TO defeat in that election, the VIII OF
majority OF the electors of the state. Different persons
are claiming the executive Offices, two bodies claim
ing to be the legislative assembly of the State and the
confusion and uncertainty produced in this way
fan with paralyzng effect upon all its in
terests. Controversy arose as soon as the election
occurred its proceedings and results but declined
TO interfere until suit involving this controversy TO
some extent brought into the Circuit Court OF the
United States under and by virtue of the act Of May ST.
1870 entitled oenOrce the right OF citizens of the


limited States 10 vote in the several States Of the Union
and for other purposes. Finding that resistance
made TO the Judicial process III that suit without any
portunity and in my judgment without right TO
view the Judgment OF the Court upon the ursdctonal or
other questions arising the case, directed the United
States Marshal TO enforce such process and 70
use if necessary. troops for that purpose,
in accordance with the 18th section OF said
act which provides that IL shall be lawful for the Pres
dent of the United States employ such part OF the Land
or naval forces the United States of the militia
shall be necessary aid in the execution OF judicial pro
cess under this, act.


Two bodies Of persons claiming to be the Returning
Board for the State and the Circuit Court in that
decided that the TO which Lynch belonged, usually
designated by his name was the lawful Returning Board
and this decision has been repeatedly affirmed by the
District and the Supreme Courts Of the State. Having
no opportuny or power 10 the votes and the
exieencies of the demanding immediate deGisOn


conceye to be my duty "" recognize those persons as


elected who received and held their credentials 10 Office
from what then appeared 20 be- and has since been
decided by the Supreme Court Of the State to be- the
legal Returning Board.


Conformably TO the decisions Of this Board full set
of state officers has been installed aud legislative AS
e1nby Organized constituting, II not de jue at least


de fact0 government which since some time IN Dece
her last has had of the Offices and been exer
lngtbe usual powers Of government; but opposed to
this has been another government claiming to control
tbe affairs OF the State and which has TO some extent
been Dro forna organized Recent investigation OF the
said election has developed many frauds and for
eees s 10 make it doubtful what candidates received
majority of the votes actually cast and in view OF
these facts variety of action has been proposed.


Ihave no specfc recommendation to make upon the
subject but II there is any practical way df removing
these difficulties by legislation, then earnestly request
that such may be taken at the present session Oh
Congress 1t seems advisable that should state now
what shall feel bound TO pursue in reference to
the matter In the Of action by Congress al TINS

be made by the parties to the controversy which, OF all
things, Is the most desirable IL will be my duty 50 iar

planned of in former years by Fred.
Douglass and other prominent members
Of the race to which he belongs. BY
preference he has taken his meals at his

him with the same courtesy that was
extended to his white colleagues, and
the choice Of eating at the public table
or in private was extended to him Mr..
Lynch says that the utmost state of good

between the colored and white population,
and as on evidence Of the prevailing
sentiment, he states with pride that his

At especial term of court called at Fulton, Mo, August 27, Judge Burckbardt delivered very forcible charge to the grand jury in which he called theis st- tention to the action of the mob which hung Kessler, and in taking him from the officers of the law killed the sheriff and wounded two other men. The Judge declared the killing of Sheriff Law to be murder as much as the hanging of Kessler, though the former act was accidental, and the person who fired the shot might not have intended to kill, but he showed that Kessler was under the protec- ton of the law, that the sheriff, an innocent man, was in the discharge of his duty when he was killed. The Judge said that all must admit that e strict observance and faithful enforcement of law constitutes the only safe ty of any people, and the only protection for

 individuals or their property, and though in twelve months past over thirty horses and mules had been stolen in that county, and in no case had the thieves been punished tor their crimes, at the hands of tho law, yet, the hanging of hundred horse-thieves, by a mob, could not compensate for the death os fore, he urged the jury to indict the ring leaders of the mob and bring them to punish ment.. . -.

 T Every one who understands the argument of Judge Burckhardt, every well disposed citizen in any community, will assent to the correctness of bis statements, yet, once in @ while, in different sections of the country, uprsings of the people take place, and what they believe at the time to be justice Is sum- marily administered. These ebullitions oc-

 cur as we'll in the older States as in the Ter

 ritories, in Illinois and Missouri, as in Cali

 fornia or Arizona. There is no doubt that

 the effect of such public disregard of law re- acts banefully upon the people or community , that practices 1t. It is an example which smaller numbers and finally individuals profit , by, or shield themselves behind, to avepge themselves for real or fancied injuries until,

 finally, lawlessness reigns supreme. When once the people rise and trample the law un- der their feet, it is hard for them to again

 cheerfully acknowledge and submit to the , supremacy of the law. Yet, there must be good apparent cause why community breaks f open jaiis aud takes out criminals, or over powers officers and takes their prisoners and hangs them. That cause is generally found , in the fac, that the law, in that section, has not been enforced; that offenders have not been punished that assassins and murder [ CTS have, when arrested, not been brought to

 trial, or, when tried, have by chicanery or technicalities of the law escaped conviction, that criminals of every description have ar rived st the conclusion that it 1. easy to evade the penalties of the law, and, consequently, crime has at last become bold, and . patient, long-suffering community finally, on the com-

 mission of some horrible crime like murder ing men in their sleep, shooting citizen in

 the back or committing rape on child, enrsged at the deed allows the desire for re-

 venge to overcome the dictates of prudence and becomes . mob, and commits public mur- der. Such scene produced by such causes

 was enacted in Tucson, the capital of Arizo- na, on the Sth of August, when four murder . CTS were hung in the plaza. Similar germs bid fair to produce like fruit in other portions , of Arizona. Many men have been killed, brutally murdered, in this Territory since its organization; often the murderers have been [ arrested, and as often have crawled through the meshes of the law, until it had become

 generally understood that tbere could be nc

 We regret and deplore the recent perform

This much Mr.. Fowler published in his paper, as
above stated, over his own signature, and good
deal more but not particularly bearing upon
Colonel r. W. Hughes connection with the trans
action. Some subsequent correspondence took
place, which proves that hostile meeting was In
tended, and that Colonel Hughes was the bearer Of
challenge tending to that end. Colonel Clarkson,


through the columns Of the Lynchburg Republican,
gave the correspondence alluded to, and added
fbn fol inrf fo kTr EnvUIa w
he called ""Number Four:'-


In delivering Number Four Mr.. Blackley said the
friend whom Mr.. Fowler desired to go upon the
field with him was expected in the next mornings
train.


MIR. Fowler denied this, and correspondence


between his friend Mr.. Backley and Colonel Clark
sons friend pro tenn. ensued proving that Mr..
Fowler's friend had not made such remark. Mr..
Walthan had been sent for to take the place OF
Colonel Hughes, and remained with Clarkson until
Hughes could go to Abingdon and return, which
makes his connection with contemplated duel
undisputed. Mr. Walthall declined to take Colonel
Hughes place, but remained quasi friend and
witness. That Colonel Hughes conveyed the chal.
lenge is not Denied and the correspondence quoted
| proves it conclusively. The pamphlet OF Mr.. Fow-


ler was very attainable twelve months ago, but II

Another Nomination Expected by the


Administration Party.",,"


The following special correspondence to the
HERALD has just been received at this Bureau
nom the borders OF Tennessee


BRISTOL, Tenn, Oct. 10, 1878.
The present political campaign In Virginia is
virtually ended, that Is to say, as far as Colonel
Robert w. Hughes, the radical candidate for Gov
ernor, is concerned. The announcement from this
point may seem very strange 1t will be remem-
bered that at the time OF his nomination at Lynch
burg an attempt was made by his conservative op.
ponents to prove him disfranchsed by the
fact OF his having fought q duel In
North Carolina with william Cameron,
OF the Petersburg Inder, in which Cameron was
wounded and came near losing his life. After con-
siderable argument this question was dropped, as
it appeared that the duel occurred before the adop
tion OF the constitution which specifically prohib.
tied duelling. The fact OF this agitation seemed to
have squeched all mention Of a subsequent affair
or honor In which Colonel Hughes acted as a
second for the friend who had filed
similar position for him in the Cameron duel.
This fact was substantially known among the oppo-
nents OF Hughes early in the campaign, but for
various reasons the conservatives OF Virginia
failed to make them public. Your correspondent
left Washington for this point on Thursday night
and arrived here yesterday morning to procure all
the facts respecting Hughes ineligibility. The
town OF Bristol is partly in Virginia and partly in
Tennessee, and has often been the scene Of despe-
rate conflicts.


MR.. ELBERr FOWLER
is young man Of much prominence in Bristol, the
editor OF the Bristol Neaos. anewspaper OF sprignt
liness, and he is himself very bold in his declara-
tlons. From the correspondence which is here.
with sent, it can be readily seen how
he aroused the ire of Colonel Clarkson,
and how Colonel Robert w. Hughes was
involved as the conveyor Of challenge to
fight a duel. Colonel Clarkson Is a man well known
as duelst, or rather as a man in favor OF dueing
mode for settling difficulties, and he has been
engaged in several AFFAIRS OF honor, most promi-
nent among which may be mentioned the duel be-
tween Colonel Hughes and MIR. Cameron, in which
he acted as second. He has killed one man and
chastised several Others On my arrival in Bristol
l found Mr.. Fowler absent, and upon inquiry
learned Of the publication OF the full correspondence
bearing upon the subject by him. After some
trouble succeeded in obtaining copy OF the cor
respondence, which took place in 1870. The Bristol
Nears occupies the onlce OF an ordinary country
newspaper and when Its proprietor could not sbe
found l searched the town for the s'next best
man."" who represents Mr.. Fowler, and on making
known the purpose OF my visit to Bristol he won
dered that the loyal virginians had not discovered
Mr.. Hughes weak point long ago.


at is true, then,n asked, ""that Colonel Hughes
was really the bearer OF a bona tide challenge,
which, under the Virginia Stale constitution,
debars him from holding office in the event Of his
election as Governorf'


The answer which the rural gentleman made,
but who requested his name should not be men,
toned, as ne had nothing whatever to do with the
matter, was to this eject





Necs Of July %, 1870. which contains all the nfor.
nation you DESIRE""


In the paper OF the date mentioned found the
entire correspondence which was faithfully copied,
and the wonder is that the administration has
allowed itself to be SO badly imposed upon as to
permit an ineligible nominee to disanect the
republican party in Virginia. The nrst point to be
settled is was Colonel Hughes actually disfran-
chised9


THE STATE PROHIBITION.


The following is the article of the constitution
which Affects the case in point:-


SECTION 3-ARTIcLE s.-Electire Franchise and
citizen Of this states has, since the adj adoption OF
this constitution, fought q duel with q deadly
weapon, sent or accepted a challenge to fight q
the boundaries OF this State, or knowingly con-
veyed challenge, or aided or assisted In any man.
ner in fighting duel, shall be allowed to vote or
hold any office OF honor, pront or trust under this
constitution.


Pursuant to this provision OF the organic law the
General Assembly OF tue State OF Virginia, at its
session OF 1s69-7o, passed an act, which was ap-
proved providing as to the offence, in the words OF
the constitution, that any citizen Of Virginia who,
after the twenty-sixth day OF January, 1870, COM
mtted this offence, should be liable to all the pains
and penalties named by the constitution. on the
fifteenth day or July 1870 after the constitution
had been adopted and officially promulgated, the
following article appeared in the Bristol NeDs:-


THE INSULT.


Dr. PETER ]. HALE:


1t will be seen from the letter OF General jack
son, which appears elsewhere, that DR.. Peter J..
Hale alias Dr.. Peter s. Hale, is simply swindler.
He has been about Bristol great deal lately, and
brought to US letter OF introduction from Colonel
Thomas l. Flournoy, which, like those presented
to Others was forgery. He claims TO be nephew
OF General Jubal A. Early and halls from Frank
In County He IS said by those who know him to
easily expained when we learn that he is a rela-
tive OF Saltworks whiskey-ring Garrison.


On the publication OF this paragraph Colonel John
N Clarkson, who is the party alluded TO at the end
OF the article, got grievousy indignant. He is the
uncle OF DR.. Peter y Hale and could not permit
such an alluson to 60 unnoticed. Colonel Clark
son was o colonel in the confederate army during
the war, figured prominently in Western Virginia
as cavalry commander, and has always had the
reputation OF being nigh toned gentleman. ms
offended honor was aroused. Satisfaction must be
had and TO that end, under the code dneuo, he ad-
dressed the following letter TO Mr.. Fowler, which
is the beginning OF a correspondence which, as al
ready stated must end Colonel Hughes aspirations
for Gubernatorial honors in ""Old virginny:''-

unreliable witness. The jury acquitted Lynch.

Owing to the present stringency in monetary

This, however, is not believed, nor the rumOrs

 MURDERS TN PIocHE - Since the 9th of May last, not yet four months, five men have been killed in Pioche, viz: May 9, Sheldon D. Potter by Jefferson Howard; July G, John II. Lynch by James Harrington; July l3, Robert Ash by Owen Ferguson August l, Morgan Courtney by George W. Mckinney i; August 6, Wm. Kistell by D. W. Cherry. This is shocking exhibit for population not exceeding 5000. Yet, although it looks as if the people were relapsing into barbar ism, it ought to be remembered that all these parties whe have iinbrued their hands in the blood of their fellow w-men have been brought to a realization of their folly, if not their wickedness. In each case an indictment has been found by the grand jury. Three of the number have been convicted Howard for manslaughter, Harrington of murder in the second degree, and Ferguson of murder in the first degree. Yesterday the first case was finally disposed of by sentencing How ard to ten years imprisonment. While other | communities, owing to the laxity of judges and officers, have been compelled to take the law into their own hands, it is to the credit of Pioche that mob law has never been found necessary, and that the regularly constituted authorities are proving equal to the emer- gency. .--t Pioche Record.

The Ninth of April.


So busy people are we and so many grand
achievements have been crowded into the his
tory of the nation during the last twenty
years that comparatively few recall the ami
versaries of great events. Consequently very
few recall the fact that to-day is the eighth
anniversary of one of the most memorable of
tie great events that will ever be conspicu-
Gus in our history-the surrender of Gen.
Lee and the Army of Northern V rginia at Ap-
pomattox Court House, Sunday April 9th,
1865, the virtual close of the war for the in
tegrity of the Union. In that connection it
will not be improper to briefly recall the
circumstances of that memorable event.


The movement which resulted in the sur
render at Appomattox began March goth.
The army ofoperation consisted of the Army
of the Potomac, embracing the Cavalry Corps
under Gen. Sheridan and the I'd, 5th. 9th and
9th Corps VITA two divisions of the Army of
the James, the third holding the federal lines
north of the James river. The 9Th and 9th
corps and the divisions of the Army of the
James held the federal lines south of the Ap-
pomattox river while the I'd, 9th, and Cavalry
connecting with the extreme left of the forth
fed line were to operate against the South
Side and Danville Railroads. The movement
was surprise to Gen. Lee, and his forces in
front of the I'd and 9th CORPS were driven be-
hind their works after considerable resistance,
and the cavalry making wider detour
seized Dinwiddie Court House, the junction of
several roads connecting with the main
army and leading to Five Forks the kew to
the railroad. The night of the 10th, a heavy
rain storm began which continued through
the 30th and until the 31st, converting the
fiat country which was the theatre of opera
tions into a vast quagmre and rendering the
movement of trains impossible. On the Both
the two last named corps strengthened their
positions aud Gen. Lee fastened all his avail
able infantry force to confront them and, if
possible, parry the impending blow. On the
31st Gen. Lee attacked brigade of the 5th
Corps, making movement upon the White
Oak road leading to Five Forks, ,and striking it
in its flank drove it back upon the main force
causing considerable disorder and loss. The
attack was however effectually resisted and
Gen. Lee turned upon Gen. Sheridan who
was at that time advancing on Five Forks,
when there ensued the severest fight on the
part of the cavalry during the war; which re-
suited in no advantage 10 either party. April
1st. after severe fighting in the almost impeu-
etrabie jungles about Five Forks, Gen. Sheri-
dan captured that important position with the
9th corps and cavalry, taking 5000 prisoners
Three o'clock Sunday morning, April 2nd,
under the cover of terrific cannonade, the
infantry all along the lines south of the Ap-
pomattox river, assaulted and carried the
main lines of the enemy and by noon had
seized the South Side railroad and established
lines near the inner line of forifieations
about Petersburg. Sunday night, Gen. Lee
evacuated Petersburg and Richmond and
concentrated his army at Chesterville Court
House, sixteen miles northwest of Peters 4
burg. Early Monday morning the relentless
pursuit and retreat for life began, and from
that hour until the next Sunday morning
there was 70 rest for man or beast. Monday
Gen. Lee retreated along the north side of
the Appomattox to Amelia Court House.
where he expected to find supplies to feed
his hungry army, but by mistake, his rations
had been taken to Richmond, where they had
been burned. Obliged to wait there to for
age, Gen. Lee found his way disputed by
Gen. Sheridan and the 5th corps and hesi-
tating to contest it, the arrival of the End
9th corps rendered il necessary to change
his plan, which was to join Johnston in west
efn North Carolina, and make for Lynchburg,
Va, and the mountains April 9th there was
much severe fighting, in which parts of the
whole army participated, but in which the
9th corps lost heaviest, though the cavalry,
the End corps and a part of the 5th corps
were hotly engaged. During the day large
numbers of prisoners, many pieces OF artillery
and several hundred wagons were captured.


During the. 7th, there was considerable
fighting and Gen. Lee made stand at Farm
vile, seizing natural position of great
strength. At this juncture in the pursuit, a
large part of the cavalry with the 9Th corps
and army of the James started to out-run the
enemy by the way of Edwards Court House
and place Itself in Gen. Lees front. During
the night of the 7th the enemy quietly left
Farmville and continued the fight, though
his troops were nearly famished for want of
food, not having an apology for ration since
the Monday before. The federal army had
hardly half rations at any time and had literal
ly nothing on the morning of the 9th, besides
being worn out by marching and fighting day
and night.


During the Sth, there was comparatively
little fighting, the army following in pursuit
not pressing very hard in order that Gen.
sheridan might better get to the eneny's
ir'nt. Late the same evening, Sheridan's
cavalry appeared in front Of the enemy near
Appoma'to1 Court House and by severe all
nisn' March, the infantry came to his aid

Ter, with following largely made up of polit
lcal adventurers from the Southern States
who have nothing to loose, the bill for the in
crease of salaries was tackled to the Lepisl,
tive, Judicial and Executive appropriation
bill by the vote OF a majority of both Hous.
aad Senate yesterday morning. The provis
ions OF this bill are familiar, the only change
being that the salary of each Congressman i:
increased to $500 and travelling expenses
instead OF to $4,000. There may be many
good reasons for some increase of the salaries
OF our government officials, and our people
generally feel the propriety of having them
fixed at a sum consistent with the high sta
ton ofthe recipients and the dignity OF the
nation. But this bill contains feature
which will awaken universal reprobation and
about which the country will not be SLOW 10

increase of Congressional salaries is not only
for the future but is to be garen TO members
ofMe Forty-Second Congress, who will each
get an additional s., 500 per year for the past
two years. lThrs these modest gentlemen
have voted to themselves bonus of $1,000
each. The yeas and nays on this question

An analysis of the above vote shows thai
in the Senate % Republicans and IA Demo.
Gratis voted for the measure, and 21 Republi.
cans and Democrats against it. Of the
Senators voting for it, IL were from Northern
and 23 from Southern States. In the House.
""a Republicans and 40 Democrats and Liber-
ais voted for the increase, and 80 Republicans
and 35 Democrats and Liberals voted against
it. OF those voting for the scheme, 55 were
from the Southern States and 4S from the
Northern. while the number of Southern
members voting against it does not exceed a
dozen. Of the 243 Representatives, 1913 voted
on this question. The 45 dodgers are made
up of 25 Democrats and 20 Republicans. We
have been thus careful in stating the facts
connected with this miserable transaction as
a matter for future reference.


1t is matter of profound regret that Maine
furnished two of the four New England Re.
publicans who voted in favor of this measure
Our special dispatch that no Maine members
had voted for it was sent Immediately before
the final vote ON the conference report was
taken, and up to that time no Maine Repre-
sentative had SO voted, except Mr.. Peters in
one of the earliest stages of its progress.
Massachusetts furnishes the other two

LYNCH LAW IN THE LAND OF


LOYALTY.",,"LOYALTY.


A MURDERER HUNG BY A MASKED


MOB.


Within the last four years, at least
twelve persons have been hanged by
vigilants in Southern Indiana. Deloss
Heffren, who was lynched at Salem on
the 2Sth ult., being the latest victim.
Perhaps others have shared this fate of
whom no public mention has been
made. Six members of the notorious
Reno gang of express robbers were
hanged by a vigilance committee less
than four years ago. Two years stree
three negroes were lynched in Clerke
county for numbering the Park family,
and in October, 1870, two burglars,
named Pickett and Tougatt, were
seized by a mob in Orange county,
while on their way to Jail and sum-
marily executed. Speaking of these
numerous lynchings the Indianapolis
Journal says


""Of course, all good citizens must
deprecate and condemn mobs and vio-
lence under any circumstances, but
the cause of these outbreaks is Obvious
enough. The administration of law in
certain portions of southern Indiana
has become SO loose, not to say corrupt,
that men in sheer desperation have
taken the law iii their own hands,
Crime had become SO bold and ram
pant in that section, and the courts
seemed SO powerless or unwilling to
protect life and property, that men
were compelled in self-defense to or
ganize sort of vigilance committee
committee in the counties of Brown,
Jackson, Orange, Washington and
Clarke, which during the last few years,
has done some bloody work. Mob law
law is terrible thing, and the perpe-
traitors of this act should, if possible,
be ferreted out and punished. Yet
when bad men succeed by a system of
terrorism or corruption in preventing
the execution of the laws and defying
justice, it is hard to say that society
shall quietly submit to their depreda-
tions and make no efforts to defend
itself againsS scoundrels who snap
their fingers at the law. This very
man Heffren committed an atrocious
murder few years since, and was
| acquitted by local jury, in the face
of overwhelming evidence of his guilt.
The jury not only acquitted him, hut
at the close of the trial bore him on
their shoulders to the nearest drinking
saloon and drank to the health of the
escaped murderer. And it s well
known that not only juries but judges
have proved the fast friends of crimi-
nails in some of the counties above
named. Such things are hard to bear,
! and come as near furnishing iustifi-
| cation for mob violence as anything
possibly could. AS near, we say, fo1
after all there is no justification for @
violation of law""


| lFrom the Couricr-Journal, June SOL
The Vigilance Committee of South.
| ern Indiana perpetrated another ter
rible and bloody crime yesterday
morning. On the Goth of this montl
Delos Heffren, of Salem, Washington
county, Indiana, thirty-five miles from
New Albany. shot and killed John De
Halstead. The full particulars of the
tragedy were given in the Courier.
JQurnai of Friday. Since the murder
there has been much excitement il
Washington county, and those who
knew best the feeling out there pre-
dicted the bloody sequel.


Early yesterday morning a dispatcl
was received in New Albany stating
that Heffren had been taken from the
jail in Salem at = o'clock this morning
and hung by mob. This news ere
ated the widest excitement through
out the entire city, for Heffren is vel
known there, personally and by repu
tation, and his last murder has beel
the chief topic of conversation for the
past ten days


1t is stated that one night last weel
a party of thirty or forty horseme1
rode into thu town of Salem, and. aftel
viewing the surroundings of the Jail
silently took their departure. At the
preliminary examination of Heffren
last Thursday, the motion for a chang,
of venue, although made, was not in
sisted upon, and the result was that :
feeling prevailed in the county tha
if Het1ren was tried there, he woull
be acquitted, as he was on similar
charge before. Then it was. tha
public opinion became set that Heffrel
would be taken from the jail and hung
SO when the news reached New AL
bany yesterday morning that Heffre1
| had been liunC, though the peopl,
were startled at the horrible tragedy
they veFe not surprised.


Iilere was a circus in Salem Satur
day night, and large crowd of peo
pie from the surrounding country wa.
i'll attendance. After the oirons wa:
over Knots of men were to be seeI
standing on the street, talking in low
tones. Iii a short time they dispersed
and the town was left quiet, and bore
the usual deserted look, only a few
struggling citizens being out.


AT about half-past one o'clock Il body
of masked men rode quietly into the
town and Immediately threw out senti
nels and took into custody all persons
who were out on the streets. The
! captain of the gang was powerfully
! built man, dressed in common country
clothing. and issued his orders in :
. low but firm tome, distinctly heard by
the citizens who We're held prisoners.


After the invaders had made. them
selves safe from any outside interrupt
ton, they surrounded the Jail. Deputy
Sherif Craycraft was aroused and 9
| demand was made IpOn him for the
keys of the prison. He refused to give
up the keys, positively and determin-
edly, or to tell where he had secreted
them, and was Immediately seized and
confined Ill one of the rooms of the iail
residence. The vigilants then con.
nnenced close but rapid search for the
keys; but after hunting for about ten
minutes without success, they gave il
up, and set about other means to force
an entrance into the Jail


To accomplish a forcible entrance
they had brought with them large
sledge- hammer, with which they com
menced to hammer down the doors.
The work of demolishing the doors
consumed over an hour. The heavy
| blows of the ponderous sledge- ham
iaef, welded by the powerful arms of
the regulators. resounded through the
town, and doubtless each blow fell lis
If upon the heart of the doomed man,
who waited in his cell like a Gagged

ent of the Ereru EUening gives an account OF a
big disturbance which he says occurred at a
colored camp near Middletown last Sunday
afternoon. A fellow named Price, a very large
negro, appointed as one OF commltte to keep
order on the grounds, came up with a cOlOred
man hailiug from Odessa, who was the
possessor of a bottle of whisky, which coming
to the knowledge of Price, he requsted his
companion to FORK over"" request which
was not complied with, whereupon Price made
a furious onslaught on him, wrested the bottle
and contents from him, and beat him unmercl-
fully, leaving him inSensible upon the field


The correspondent says: The news Of the
attack soon spread, and in a short time the
| friends of the beaten man collected together to
the number of about one hundred and fifty,
and having armed themselves to the teeth with
guns, pistols, axes, knives and razors, made an
attack upon the camp, demanding the surren


der Of Price, who they fully determined upon
lynching on the spot. This threat so terrified


the campites that they dispersed like sheep
except about dozen of Prices friends, who


with him, took refuge i'll a tent where they were
held clOss prltOners for over an hour. Squire


Wilson, of Appoquinimink hundred, who had


with few other white men been uneasy


witnesses to the proceedings about the tent, in


company with Mr.. Vandyke now stepped
forward, and IN the name or the state com


man1ed peace, and ordered Price and his
i friends to come out and they should be prOtec


ted. This apparently added fuel to the flame,


and for few minutes, the lives of the two


gentlemen were in great danger, but by firm


nesss full explanation of the risk the mo-


was running in their actions, they finally gO
order, when Price came out aud was immedi


ately taken charge of by Wilson and Vankyke


and hurried out Of the woods to a place o


safety, followed at distance by the mob yelling


and shouting like so many devils The scene


as described by an eye witness was terrible


and had it not been for the cOolnesS and nerv,
of Messrs. Wilson and Vandyke, there is 10


the least doubt number on both sides wOul(


have been killed, az the mob was fully deter
mined t. take Price and hang him, an(
q expressed the determination to wait till nigh
. and then fire the tent for that purpose.


A number of women were participants il

EDITOR HERALD:-Previous to the
advent of the HERALD in Los Angeles,
the outside world seldom heard of Los
Nietos, which is the granary of Los
Angeles county. believe that more
than half the grain produced in the
county is raised in this section. When
other parts of the country are parched
and look bare, Los Nietos reminds one


""Those fields arrayed in living green


And rivers of delight""


Old Gabriel must be proud of his
rivers, and no doubt he will shed
tear when he will have to blow that
blast that will dry them up forever.
Their waters have made Los Nietos
the garden spot of the world. The
'happy valley"" described in john
sons Rasselas, where everything grew
with such Mxuriance, and where ripe
fruit fell from the trees every monthin
the year, is realized in Los Nietos.
Apple trees frequently bear three crops
a year, and semi-tropical fruits thrive,
With very little care vegetables can
be raised every month in the year.
One hundred tons of beets were raised
on a single acre OF Mr.. Tuttle's land in
one season near our new town at the ter
minus of the railroad, but as we have
no sugar factory yet, it will not pay to
raise beets.


1t might be asked why all the lands
watered by the San Gabriel rivers are
not planted in oranges, etc? My an
swer is that we are too poor to buy
the trees. Many of the settlers were
in destitute circumstances when they
met Governor Downey, five or six
years ago. He sold them homes at $40
per acre giving them ten years to pay
for them. A mistake was made in
buying more land than could be cul-
tivated. They did not known then
that five acres properly cultivated
would support large family. How
ever, they soon found that every acre
put in cultivation would pay for itself
in one year. The land is now selling
at 500 per acre.


Your correspondent ""Observer"" has
set the ""ball rolling"" towards our new
town. The BUSINESS men of Gallatin and
the business men of the college are
putting their houses on wheels and
rolling them into the new town,
while others are hauling timber from
Los Angeles and building new ones. :


Messrs. Griffith & Lynch will estab-
lish a lumber yard in our town in
few days.. If you have any idle car
penters send them out here.


Your correspondent ""Observer"" has
named our new town Nietos city, but
believe a majority of our people here
are in favor of calling it Downey city,
in honor of Governor Downey, the
first of the large land holders of Los
Angeles county, who divided up
his lands and furnished thousand
with homes. PROGRESS."

The London correspondent of The TRIBUNE.
in a letter published herewith, gives some Oh
the talk which the loss of the Atlantic aroused
in England We also reproduce the statement
of the Liverpool agents OF the White Star
line from which it appears that they are posi-
tive that there should have been no need of
the steamers putting into Halifax for Goals.
According to their figures, there were over
two hundred tons of coal more on the ship
than had ever been consumed on any average
voyage before. OF the quality of the Goals,
they make no exhibit. Capt. Williams claims
that his supply did run short; and he says
the fuel was so poor that it may have been
sooner consumed than usual.


Rather inopportunely, 1t seems to us, the
notorious Kiowa chiefs-Bg Tree and San
tanta-are to be let loose once more. These
sayages have been in duress in New Mexico
for long time. They have been repeatedly
guilty Of the most outrageous acts of treach-
cry. And their followers, asking for the
release of their chiefs, confess to having COM
mitted frequent violations of often-repeated
treaty obligations. They plead guilty to muir
dering innocent women and children and to
perpetrating other aggravated crimes. They
nonchalantly declare their intention to reform
If they can get their chiefs back. AS these
rascally chiefs have been in the fore front OF
all offending heretofore, we fail to see the
wisdom of turning them out again to lead
their warriors to new rapine and murder.


More bloody disorders are springing from
the revolutionary conflict in Louisiana. A
quarrel over local officers, in Grant Parish,
has resulted in a horrible slaughter, over one
hundred negroes being reported killed. The
trouble seems to have grown out of a contest for
possession of the County Courthouse. situated
at Colfax, Grant Parish. Mr.. Kellogg, claiming
to be Governor of Louisiana. has commissioned
certain men as parish officers, the Lynch Re-
turning Board having first set aside the popu-
lar election. KellOggs appointees are resisted
by some of those who opposed his party III
the late elections, the colored men being con-
spicuOus in the preliminary acts OF violence
These, fortifying themselves in the Court
house, have been attacked by the Kel-
logg party and driven out by firing the
building. No legal process seems to
have been attempted on either SIDE We
hope the tragical results Of this lawless con-
flict have been overdrawn. The present state
ment is an awful one, and gives us no idea
of which side has the rights of the case. 1t
is enough to know that the bloody occurrences
in Grant Parish are the legitimate fruit OF
usllrpation which United States Court per-
mitted, the President winked at, and Congress
did not have the courage to touch."

or desired to have Judge Hawkins


tried for perjury. they should have
attended to that before they SO con-


fdently proclaimed his turpitude. The
Picapne first set itself up as court-a
mock tribunal, it is true. but yet sort OF
self-constituted arbiter- proclaimed Judge
Hawkins guilty Of a crime OF which he
had not even been accused by anybody
else, and certainly not convicted by any
legal tribunal, and when called to account
for such a liberty with the unblemished
name of good citizen, wants to go into
lengthy trial of Hawkins instead Of de-
Tending itself for its own illegal publica-
ton. The attempt to arraign Judge Haw-
kins on this trial purports confession
of judgment, proclaims to the world
that the publication was without
authority. and the only hope Of saving
themselves lies in possible conviction
before Judge Lynch. This idea is not
very brilliant one, it is true; but it is the
best the defendants have. If Hawkins
had been a convicted perjurer at the time
this libel was published, why then he was
one, and any man had a right to say SO.
But as he had not been either convicted,
tried, nor even accused of such crime,
to publish him as guilty in public news
paper was a very grave offense, for which
the defendants are now on their trial. 1t
is the Picayune's trial, not Jude Hawkins.
The latter has very little interest in the
result. But the community has very
deep interest in knowing whether every
man who sets himself up as apublic re-
former may destroy private reputation to
promote his ideas Of the public good with
out giving adequate compensation for it.


1t will be seen that the question is not
a very broad one, nor at all complicated.
The Picayne either published the article
complained of or it did not. Counsel for
defense admit the publication. The arti-
Gle is either libelous or it is not. Upon
the face Of it it appears to be grossly libel
GUS. Defendants have failed to file the
decree of any court adjudging the COM
plainant guilty of perjury, perfidy. or any
other crime, and as he stands before the
community a perfectly innocent man, the
defendants fear that unless they can
blacken his character in some way or
another right soon, they will be amerced in
damages. The counsel. therefore. appear
to be anxious to put off the trial of their
case until they can get judicial decision
about something else. But Judge
Lynch infexibly keeps them to the
narrow channel of the law and rules Of
practice. OF course there is a good deal
of futtering and chirruping. as much as
we see and hear among flock Of turkeys
when driven through the streets about
Christmas time. The lawyers. like the
feathered bipeds. want to turn into every
little side alley and dark hole instead of
going straight ahead. About every five
minutes or so they take an exception""
thinking, perhaps. to overawe the judge
by this frequent reference to the higher
tribunal. But Judge Lynch is pro-
found and accomplished lawyer. and he
knows the judges of the Supreme Court
are so likewise. He furthermore knows
that not one in twenty of the exceptions
to his rulings will ever be presented to the
Supreme Court, and none Of those that
ore will he SI,efained"

theatre for the production of the popular
Credit Mobilier drama. Men who are selec-

The art of receiving and entertaining guests
has become so fashionable that the Washing
ton papers devote whole columns to reception
notices. These gatherings furnish pleas
ant pastime for the ''sweet-do-nothing' part
of the community; but stable-keepers and
florists reap the benefit. Mrs. Grant and her
daughter receive from three to five O'Clock
every Saturday afternoon which custom is
commendable one, giving as it does our peo-
pie pleasant opportunity to meet the unas-
suming ladies of the White House. Hon.
John Lynch entertains has Maine friends at
his home with lavish hospitality. Every one
speaks well of him. Gen. Dent in conversa-
ton with us said: ''He is very affable man,
and perfect devotee to the rights and inter-
ests of your State"" Our party consists of A
K. P. Lord Esq, wife and daughter of Bux-
ton, Charles McKenney Esq, and wife of Bar
Mills and myself. Mr., Lynch met us at the
Capitol and invited us to his home. We shall
not forget his kindness. Our visit to the Ex-
ecutive Mansion was a pleasant one as we
were accompanied by personal friends of
President Grant. We first met Gen. Dent
ID MS room over the east parlor. He is
very entertaining gentleman and his
conversation is as relishable as good food or
pleasant perfumes The President looked
pale and careworn to us. He was pleasant
and genial in his appearance and seem ed in
clined to make us feel easy in his presence.
In his conversation he referred to the dilapi-
dated condition of the White House-the
bad walls and faded furniture; said the sec
ond story was not suitable to open to the pub
lie; and we thought so, too, for the rooms
we passed through were far inferior to those
we occ upied at Wizards Hotel. He said he
hoped his successor would have better house
than he had, for the reputation of the coan-
try He gave me lis autograph with a smile
and shrug Of the shoulders, 'The only OBJ
lection have to complying with your desire
is that it obliges me to put on my glasses, and
they make me look so very old to the ladies'""
We left the Presidents room delighted with
our call and resumed conversation with Gen.
Dent, who invited us to attend the reception
to be given at the White House the next
evening Engagements in Baltimore would
prevent the gentlemen of our party from be-
ing present, which defrauded us ladies of
much antic pated pleasure. We of course
went to the Patent office and fingered with
great interest around the large glass case
which holds some of the most precious treas
ures of the Republic. Here are the clothes
that were worn by Gen. Washington when

which he elected TO the United States Senate two or
three persons not returned by the DeFerret Board :

THE TWO LEGIsIATUREs.


BY Mr. Tmmbull-The Legislature that met on the 9th
Of December called in extra session by Gov. War

the new members who did not assemble on that day had
been enoined dong by the United States Court
and by the United States Marshal and troops under him.

them TO enter There were two companies OF arllery
guard at the State House. Those who assembled on
the 9th Of December were only such as were permitted
TO assemble by United States Marshal acting under
orders OF the United States Court The members who
assembled IN the Fusion Legislature had primo
facie right their seats. HIS answer
10 Mr. Morton meant that as a
the of assembling; the Supreme Court bad not de
tba time that The De Ferret Board was the legal Board
and therefore the Fusion members had at the time they
first assembled prma iaCie Tlght 10 their seats th

VOTES OF THE STATE PROM 1868 TO 1872.


Gov. Warmoth questioned the witness at some length
concerning tho the state in 1885, 1862 1870 and
1872 respectively the object being to prove that the abo
ton of the disfranchising clause OF State Const
ton would more than for the large increase OF
the opposition In the latter year. The whites took
uch more general interest and part in the election
1872 than In any previous since the reconstruction
The vote for McEnery was, the witness thought less
an Nnfn nf hn
publican united in 1870 this was not the case In
1872 In 1871 there was division In the Republican ranks
which resulted in distinct and fully organized Re-
publican organizations one representing the state and
the other the Federal Administration. Thotwo orSanza-
tions fought each other determnedy than the Re
publican and Democratic parties had eyer done These
we're IN full existence during the canvass and election OF
1872. Believes that the falling OF OF 400 votes IN
the Republican party In 1872 Is IN part accounted Tor Dy
dissension never knew that Kellogg was popular
man among the Republicans OF the state.


BY Mr.. Ray-Thinks the organization or the Legisa-
ture 9th of December not IN accordance with

Green Recognized the Villain Who
Shot and Robbed Mr.. Nash at West
port, Conn.,, I'm March Last.","Boston, Sept. 80, 1873.","port, Conn.,, i'm March Last.


BOSTON, Sept. 80, 1873.


The confession OF John Green, alias John McDon-
ald now confined in the Massachusetts, State
Prison, that he accompanied Michael Lynch from
New York city to Little Neck, l.. L., in February
last and there murdered James Graham, q boot
maker, has furnished clew which connects these
villains with the highway robbery and attempted
murder of Mr.. +. Ii. Nash then editor OF the South
Norwalk Conn., Sentinel, at Westport on
the night OF March 10 last Green, In his
confession stated that after waiting in New York
till the excitement which attended the Graham
murder had blown over, he and Lynch started East,
and when about forty-fve miles east OF New York
robbed man OF his watch and sum OF money.
Mr.. Nash read Green's confession in the HERALD OF
saturday last and was led to the belief that these
were the same men who had attacked and ronb bed
him. and he immediately came on here to Identify
tnenl.


He visited the State Prison for that purpose to-
day, and the consequence was that Mr. Nash fully
recognized Green the man. Lynch. too he
thinks was aware Of the robbery, but both he and
Green deny all knowledge OF it, Mr.. Nash returned
to Conn ecticut this noon. He intends to cause
thorough search of Lynchs house in New York to
be made TO see II he cannot find his watch, which
he particularly desires TO obtain, neither Green
Lynch having 1t when arrested for the Srlng
ueld ROBBERY. 10r wnlCn tneY are now serving out
q term Of twenty years each. 1t is q question for
the lawyers to decide whether Lynch and Green
can be taken to New York before their present
sentence OF twenty years expires and be put trial
for the murder of James Graham, to which deed
Green coniesses he was accessory. II, however,
the Governor OF New York issues requIstion and
the Supreme Court grants a writ OF habeas corpus
Governor Wasnburn will, doubtless, permit Lynch
and Green to be taken to New York to be tried lor
the murder.


0fiicers are expected from New York with the
requisite documents this week. The prisoners
manifest no concern about their probable fate,
but go quietly about their work as usual. 1t Is
supposed that Green made his confession thinking
that, by turning states evidence against Lynch,
who, he claims, committed the Graham murder he
will save his own neck from the gallows: but even
his present term OF twenty years. will doubtless be
Sufficient to keep him behind prison bars Tor the
remainder OF his earthly existence."

the White Sulphur Springs.",,"1 : .E


We understand that the 'Southerl
Historical Society,"""" of which Rev Dr
Palmer, of New Orleans, is President
has appointed a convention to assem-
| Dle at the Montgomery White Sulphu
Springs ON the Nth of August next
for the purpose of adopting some gen
eral plan for collecting and preserving
the materials for history of the lat
4 war. and for having that history writ
ten from an impartial Southern stand
point.


This society was organized severa
years ago with DR.. Palmer as Presi
dent; and ""A Vice-President for eaci
one of the late Confederate States a
well as for Maryland. Gen. r. E. LIE,
was the Vice-President for Virginia
but after his death General J. A. Earl,
was appointed to succeed him.
| The plan of the convention is to have
number of delegates appointed fol
each State, by the Vice-P.esiden
| thereof. in order to secure proper
| representation, but it is also desired
that there shall be as large an attend
ance as practicable, of all those Con
| federates who feel sufficient interest
| i'll the object of the convention to in
duce them to take part in its further
| ance. We ale informed that number
of delegates from this State have been
appointed. and that General Early, by
request of the parent society, will de-
liver the opening address. The pres
ence of n number of distinguished
officers of the Confederate army is an.
ticipated, and among them Generals
Joseph F.. Johnston, Beauregard
Bragg, Hood. Hardee, Hampton and
others. The convention will doubtless
be one of great interest and attraction.

Mr. A. II. STEWART, is worth one
hundred millions of dollars. That hard
fact is settled, as newspaper publicity
and an inventory taken just before
his voyage to Europe can settle it,
We do not pretend to speak of the re-
sponsibility of such wealth, but to
many A. 7. Stewart is, strange to say,
too wealthy to envy. The RESPONSE
bility conceins himself alone-the
disposal of such vast accumulations
the general community. What 10 do with
it must be to him a most perplexing g
problem. He has no children; cares
little for his relations. and friendship
does not extend to bequeathing one
hundred millions even from Damon to
Pythias. Stewards wealth is probably
his master. 1t is Il manifest fact that
no one man can know what to do with
SO much money. 1t is said that he
himself WAS surprised when he saw the
total of that inventory; and well he
might be. He cannot use it, and it
has become such force of habit to ac-
cumllate. that his visit to Europe is
said to have one primary Object-tO
make some more money. He is deter
mined that th' foreign branches of the
house Olga. Il. Stewart 6 Co., shall
equal the New York establishments
And he is the man who once said that
his magnificent New York residence
and all his immense wealth only gave
him shelter and food.

To ae Hon. Mayor and Oily Council Of VII
miDgtOn:


GENTLEMEN THE Special Committee on City
Hospital would respectfully recommend TO your
Honorable body that, after examining all the

Mr. Quinn moved tho adoption of the report of
the commi tee, which being seconded, Mr. Feb-
ger opposed its adoption and thought the place
not adapted to the purpose OF city hospital
Those oonversant with hospitals knew that
wards were required 40 different rooms would
require 40 nurses, whereas ii shou ! be 30 ar
ranged that into wards that but few nurses
would be required. The building was too high
and the patients would have to be carried up

be avoided He thought the locality offered by
Bishop Lee, on Jefferson between Fourteonth
and Fifteenth streets, elevated fully as we'll and
better adapted for an hospital, The latter could
be purchased for 1000, whereas jackson
Bonds would cost $l7.5


Mr. Quinn replied and said it. would not re
quire 40 nurses for 40 patients, The building
con be arranged into wards. We have ths
building here already erected suitable for hos
pital, with every convenience BishoD Lees
contract price for lot was $4,000 without
building. or any hot and cold wather baths.
Mr.. Pickes thought the place recommend
cd the best we could get at the present time.
The property was cheap. Bishop Ices place was
certainly beautiful location nut it was not plea
SAINT to have hospital on the banks of the race
which furnishes our drinking water and it would
be equally unpleasant for patients to be placed
where they we're all the time in sight OF the Gem
eteTy and tombstones We want hospital
now and the one now proposed ready for
occupancy. The cholera was advancing and 1t l.
the part OF wisdom to prepare for it.
Mr. Hayes thought the property was cheap,
but was afraid it was not suitable for the pur-
pose recommended He thought we should 60
where we could get the most ground. The Io
feet adjoining at $50 per foot would cost $3, 900
more.


Mr. Baker thought we should have more OF
| the details; we ought to know who are to be sal
| Aried and how much and how and where the
money was to come from to support the Hospi-
tai.


Mr. Quinn stated that he understood one man
ufacturing firm would give sl500 per year and
| he had no doubt there were others who would
| be glad to contribute.


| Mr. Richardson said the Committee had been
authorized to get proposals for lot and not to
/ make details that was after consideration.
| MFR. Baker, moved to refer the question back
/ to the committee for specific details. Lost


motion by Mr.. Baker to postpone until the
/ next meeting of Council was also lost


Mr.. Quinn calling for the yeas aud nays on

| lows:

WASHINGTON, February",,"


The Senate committee on privileges
and elections reported to-day in part on
the Louisiana case, in which they say the
election Of the Greeley electors was Ger
titled to by the governor, but the official
returns of the election have not been
counted by the returning board created
bv the laws of Louisiana for that pur-
pose, and the persons who, in fact, made
the examination and count had no legal
authority to do 80 Tie election Of the
Grant electors is certified to by the Lynch
returning board but the board did not
have the official returns before them, and
their election is not certified to by the
governor of the state, as required by act
of Congress.


The oommit.c are Of the opinion that
neither the Senate nor both Houses joint
ly have the power under the Constitution
to canvass the returns Of an election and
count the votes to determine who have
been elected presidential electors, but
that the mode and manner of choosing
electors are left exclusively to States


AS TO the other questions upon which
the committee were instructed TO report,
touching the exis tence of a legal State
government in Louisiana, and the admis
sion Of the senator from that State, they
are not now prepared to report"

high like mountain cone Of snow. Bul
now at last be rises, and so near the wonder


ing jury that he might touch them with his
long, bony fingers. With his eyes still hall
shut, and standing rigid as pillar of iron
his thin lips curl, slightly part, and the voice
comes forth. AT first it is low and sweet
like the melody of an incantation, while the
speaker proceeds to tear in shreds the argu
ment of Ashley, that melts away as snow
before the sun. Every one looked surpris-
ed. Anon he came to the dazzling wit of
the poet-lawyer, Pike. Then the curl of his
liz grew sharper, his sallow face kindled up
and his eyes began to open, now dim and
dreamy no longer, but vivid as lightning
red as fire globes, ond glarng like twin me-
teors. The whole soul was in the eye, the
fall heart streamed out on the face. In five
minutes Pixies wit seemed the foam of folly.
and his finest satire horrible profanity W en-
contrastcd with the iimitable sales and ex-


erminating sarcasms of the stranger. Then,
without so much as bestowing an allusion to
Prentiss he turned short on the periured
Witnesses of Hopkins, tore their testimonv
into atoms, and hurled into their faces such
terrible invectives that all trembed as will
an ague, and two of them fed in terror from
the courtroom. The excitement of the
crowd was becoming tremendous; the lif.
and soul of the assembly seemed to hang on
the tongue of the speaker; he inspired them
with his own passions and saturated them
with the poison of his own malicious feeling
But his greatest triumph was to come.


His eyes began to glare frrtively at the
assassin Hopkins, and his lean, taper fingers
slowly assumed the same direction. He
hcmmed the wretch with a circumvallatiou
of strong evidence and impregnabe arsu-
ment, cutting off all hope of escape He
piled up huge bas,ions Of insurmountable
facts


He ding beneath the murlerercr and SIAN
aercrs feet di'chcs OF dilommis such ms no
sophislrv coul overlap and 10 stretch of
ingenuity evadc; and having thus, as one
might say impounded his victim, and hem
med him ike scorpion in fire, he stripped
himself TO the work Of massacre.


OH then, but it was vision most glor-
ous and dreadful to behold the orator. IIi-
actions, before graceful as the wave of ""a
golden willow in the breeze, grew impctuous
rs the motion of an oak in the hurricane.
His voice became ""A trumpet filed with the
wild whirIpools, deaiening the ears with
crashes Of power, and yet inlerminged all
the while with sweet under song OF
-oftest cadence. His face was as red as a
drunkard's, his countenancc looked haggard
rs that of a maniac; and ever and anon he
flung his long, bony arms on high, as il
grasping at tIunderbots. lie drew pic
ing coors that hell itself might be con
sidered beautiful. He painted the slanderer
so black that the sun seemed dark at noon
day when shining on such an accursed mon
ster; and then he so fixed both portraits on
the shrinking brow of Hopkins that he nailed
them there forever The agitation of the
audience nearly amounted to madness.


All at once the speaker descended from
his perlous height. His voice walled our
for ihc murdered dead, the beautiful Mary.
rore beautiful every moment, as her tears
hove faster, till men wept and lovely wo-
men sobbed like children.


He closed by a strong exhortaion to the
Jury, and through them to the bystanders.
He entreated the PANEL after they should
bring in their verdict for the plaintiff, not to
offer violence to the defendant, however
richly he m ight deserve it; in other words,
mot to lynch the villain Hopkins, but leave
his punishment to Cod"" This was the
rnost arrful trick of all, and the best calcu-
lated to insure vengeance.


The jury rendered verdict of $50, 600,
and the night afterwards Hopkins was taken
from his bed by lynchers and beaten almost
to DEATH

was heard, and the beautiful Mary Elliston
sprang forward and throwing her arms around

is, of course, to be considered in CONNECTION
with the dark story which comes from the
Long Island village of Huntington. There is
something very painful in every link Of the
chain of events, which reaches back from the
finding of the mutilated remains of the young
farmer, Charles G. Kelsey, in the Sound, to
the days when he was first smitten with the
charms of the village belle. 1t covers period
of seven or eight years. Love- passion
which has had its careful analyzers among
the finest minds from immemoriai
ages, is still puzzle. What Edmund Burke
says of taste may be said of love-it is too deli
cate to bear the chains of definition. There is
pure ideal love which we call divine, but in
man or woman love is alloyed with clay, and
its exhibition bears all the consequences Of the
mixture. From Petrarch, in hopeless agony
carving the name of Laura on the trees, to the
strange, wild creature, Heathcliffe which
Emily Bronte imagined, and whose moody pas
sion she painted in such sombre colors,
the phases Of unsatis6ed yearning are very
WIDE Sensual craving comes to mar the
poets dream, and between love and
lust men are confounded in attempt
ing to judge how this passion operates
in others-often how it operates in themselves.
However compounded may have been the
young farmers passion for the young lady in
the case, it was certainly intense Neither
ears nor refusals damped its ardor. Letters
were written to the young lady which seem the
work Of madman or hase wretch, and while
they were on the one side attributed to Kelsey,
on the other side they were attributed to
parties anxious to ruin him in the lady's eyes.
Last November the unfortunate Kelsey, when
returning from a political meeting, was set
upon by masked men, tarred and feathered.
He ran to his house and was heard to descend
from his room to the we'll for water to wash
off the evidences of the shame hat had BEEN
put upon him. From the nanelessly mutt
lated state in which the remains were found it
is evident that he was brutally murdered by
those who feared Identification il the lynch
ing affair. The inquest was opened yester-
day at Huntington, and it is to b' hoped, now
that it is certain murder was dne, that the
guilty parties will be discovered. In any case
the details Of o strange story will 20 divulged
which will challenge the record Of passion
and crime for its fellow."

jority, aud they will do it, provided an able,
honest, unexceptIonabe candidate-free from the

a candidate can be found, and such candidate

ing boldly, or IN the crouching, unfair and false
form of ""independent"" There can be no neutrals oil
independents in this fight. And in this encounter

These words are as apples Of gold set in PIC

hearts Of tho Virginia people We arc called
""vaIn"" by our enemies; but, II We are, have VT
not a right to be This question was once asked

shall be two parties in the apprOaChlng election,
aud they are termed the ""White Mans Party''
and the ""Black Mans Party"" and with these
significant names on the banners they are going
into the contest. Tue people of Virginia have
shown more faith in the negro aud given his race
more encouragement than any other State but
they have before their eyes the fate of Louisiana,
Florida, Mississippi, South CaFolina, Arkansas
and every other State where the negro and his
party has had power, and they fear to risk the
election even of white men by negro votes.--
Hence they have resolved to take the position
they have, hoping 10 escape the terrible debts and
grinding taxation which the triumph Of the nc.
gro's party in other States have brought upon the
people.


Mr. Hughes, the Radical candidate for Governor
has taken the stump and we find the following
utteranee quoted from his speech at Lynchburg,
reported in the Virginia papers uuder the head of
white meu and black men as a laboring class :""


""study the character OF the laboripg population
all over the world, and whore will laboring class
anywhere be found 80 exemplary in their conduct
or SO elevated IN their morale, all things consid-
ed as the negro population OF ViEginiaS When a
people OF such approved character flock in body
10 political party, is that an argument against
that party or for itP''


To this puff Of tas Virginia negroes the Rich
mond Enquirer very properly calls the attention
Of the white people, and asks that It be carefully
Considered and inwAtdy digested by the white
men OF The ""labOring class'' IN Virginia. 1t re-
minds US Of the story Of the intensely democratic
iEsividual who contended ""that one man was as
good as anOthsr and darhed sight better""


""TEe negro population Of Virginia. ""a ''A la
boring class may be in Radical eyes more ""exsm-
plary in their conduct"" and more elevated in
their mOrnis, ell things considered, than the Ia
boring class in Ireland, or England, or Germany, /
or France, or any other country; but no body but
the Radicals can see it in that light.

They will answer ON the 4th OF November"""

The charge Of encouraging litigation by Mr.

the contrary, no magistrate ever did 80 much to

write letter to parties who unknowingly

left his office and walked to distant parts Of the


city to settle disputes, and thus prevent the en-

mans conduct that comes before them, do not

| The Office Of Alderman was abolished because
/ the Democrats desired to get possession of all
power in the State. They turned out the City
| Council and changed the qualifications OF voting.
and to get majority in the City Council, divided
| one of the smaller wards because it had large
ma jofity of Democrats into two, thus giving two
men in it. about the same political power as five


men In the larger wards. II the Democrats could

power to the magistrates resident in the city.

whom the citizens had no part or lot in choos

ever committed Ia the State. But even then it


was only abolished through legislative fraud


DR.. Brown, the member who had the bill in

clause abolishing the Alderman's Office in it, but


that it was smsggled in the Senate, not returned


to the House, but engrossed, and signed, and Of


course b,cAme a law.


Again it is notorious the Alderman constantly


endeavored to rescue those who come under his


notice from life Of crime. Twice had he been


commended publicly for this in public from


the circumstances becoming accidently known to


ministers Mrs. McClees and others know the


many erring girls he saved and endeayored to

Vincent drew it for nothing, and it was 90 admir-

members know how nearly every week (night

them he has struggled 10 obtain lodgings for


unfortunate women, aud obtain position for


them who might otherwise have frozen to death


in our streets, and that he paid for this out OF

The Aldelman's whole life has been a great
| struggle against wrong When the cOored man


had no friends, and it was political death to aid
HIM, the Alderman was engaged in constant


struggle to do him justice. 1n proof of this /
will cite case well kno Sn to most Of our citi-

rs the former one, on account of the inclcmen

10 lack much of the independent, earnest spiri,
of the former meeting. The committee ap
pointed at the former meeting TO draft a cOnsti
tuition and bylaws had performed the duty as
signed them, and made their report, which was
adopted. But there the convention came to Il
pause The constitution thus adopted had
brought into being powerful piece of machin-
cry. One, two or more societies or oranges
stood organized in each town in the county,
and these had now knit themselves together in.
10 one body, consisting of delegates from each
local body, acting as central and controlling
power at the county seat. But having con.
structed the machine, what to do with it: Its
objects are declared 10 be to promote ""the NOR,
al, intellectual, social and petuniary wef:re of
tie farmers"" &c But how?


Mr. Andrew Lynch is man of clear, sound,
practical common eonse- The farmers come
together and declare the source of all their
grievances to be the railroad and other giant
monopolies brought into being and fostcrcd by
the state and national governments and to pro.
mote the welfare of the farmers, therefore, he
takes the sensible thing to be, to strike at the
monopolics TO this end he proposes to put
this fine piece of machinery to practical use in
securing such a position and influence for the
farmers in our government as will enable them
10 control their own destiny. The town or To-
cal oranges, he proposes, shall instruct their
delegates to the Central society as to their de-
>ircS in the way of candidates for Office; and
the central society shall, carrying out these in
structions, name the candidates for county of.
licers, and signify the will of the county to the
state society in regard to state officers In
short, Mr.. Lynch proposes that, as the gricv-
anccs OF the farmers result from Il want Of
enough men friendly to their interests in the
national and state governments, they shall use
their power thus organized, in putting the
right men into the right places.


He goes step further. AS no political or
ganizaion can hope to succeed unless based on
some clearly defined, ineligible principle, Mr..
Lynch lays down few propositions,
based on sound constitutional law and common
sense, and striking with startling directness
at the very foundation stones of the monopolies
against which the farmers are supposed to be
wagng warfare, and these he proposes shall be
adopted as the creed platform or basis of the
new party.


All this seems cmncntly Straightforward,
business like and practical. But unhappily,
while the farmers assembled seem earnest
enough in their purpose, and to see clearly
enough the way before them, and are unable
TO deny but that the course suggested by Mr.
Lynch is the only alternative short of square
back-down, the convention on Saturday was at
tended by Il half dozen of cunning local radi
cal politicians, who saw clearly enough that if
the practical ideas of Mr. Lynch were adopted,
1t would be all up with the radical party, not
only of this county, but it might he of the state
and indeed the entire west


The luminous Mr. Cullen, of the Ottawa Re
puJlican is therefore pushed forward. to dark
cn counsel by raising doubts and bubbles. He
was, of course, all eagerness to promote the in.
terests of the farmcrs-Of course. The farmers
were swindled by the railroads and other mo.
nopolics, and had sore gricvance-sore griev
ances-ah! But he had hoped that this grand
movement would be kept out of the muddy
pool politcs-thc muddy pool-a-ah! One
or two other radical politicians chimed in, and
the convention virtually stultficd itself. and
brought its deliberations to a sadly lame and i'm.
potent conclusion, by adjournng until the busy
season next May, without giving the splendid
machine they had constructed single function

Saturday, and moved their adopted as mean,


OF testing the sense of the convention. III,


advocated them in forcihle speech. The reso


lutiOns are as follows:


This association has no object in view which


contravene the principles embodied i'm the con


s,ltution of the United States, or the cOnst itu
ton OF the several states of the Union. On the
contrary, its objects are to remove from the
legislative, judicial and executive branches of
| the general and state governments the cOrrup-
tlon, venality and abuse of power which so
seriously rctard the welfare and prosperity of
| the people.


We recognize the power of congress to raise,
by tax or impost, sufficient revenue to meet the
eNlgencles OF the government. But we hold
| that congress has no constitutional power to
impose prOhlbitory or protective duties as such
duties do not operate to produce revenue for
the support Of the government but to create
and enrich mOnOpOlies. The imposition of
such duties is plainly class legislation, which
Is evidently unconstitutional. N
We recognize in state legislatures the power
to disregard vested rights when they stand in
the way of great public benefit. 1t was only
by the exercise Of this power that railroad cor
porations were enabled to condemn and take
the private property necessary for the ConStr,ic.
tlon OF their railroads. Hence, we hold that the
legislature, through which railroad corpora
tions acquired vested rights in consideration
OF public benefit has the power in like man.
ner to take away the vested rights acquired
through II, when the conduct of the railroad
corporation so vested becomes public griev-
ancc.


lhe people being sovereign, there is no pow
er to which they can appeal for redress of
grievances. The general and state governments
being composed of the servants of the people
the custom of petitioning those bodies for re-
dress of grievances has created the impression
that the people are the servants of the govern
mcnt. We therefore hold that when the people
have reason to complain OF unjust legislation
it is their duty to approach their governmen,
IN their sovereign capacity and DEMAND their
rights.


We hold that the Judiciary is made by the
constitution OF the United States. and the con-
stitutions OF the several states, the guardian of
the peoples rights, Ii, then, the rights of the
people are iniringed by congressional or state
legislation, the judiciary is directly response
bic; for the legislative branch of the govern
ernmen', unaided by the judiciary, is powerlcss
for evil


Whereas, the people nithclr political ca.
paclty are sovereign;


Aud whereas, thcgovernment of the United
States and OF the several states OF the union is
conducted by individuals who are the paid
servants Of the people


And whereas, it is fer reason Of the corrup.
ton, venality and abuse of the power of our
palo servants that our rights are compromised
and our welfare and prosperity retarded


And whereas. it Is through party politics
ana party machinery that venal, corrupt and
incompetent men are chosen To conduct the
affairs of Cur government: Therefore.


Resolved, that We do hereby pledge our.
selves one to another, that we will ignore par.
~ politics in the election of all our public of.
acers, and that We Will vote for no candidate
ior pubic office who Is put in nomination
by the old political machinery, viz caucuses
and conventions.


Mr.. Lynch, in substance, said: THE people
are suffering monstrous grievances How shall
these wrongs be redrcsscd: How, are these
grievances to be redresscd? Can we do il in
any other way than by declaring boldly our
principles: We must strike at the root of the
evil. Those now in power are either our enc.
mics, or in their interest We can do nothing
until we force those in power TO respect our
Just demands, or by choosing men to Office
who will represent us and our interests. We
must unite upon this, regardless of party, and
| have no doubt of our success when we shall
have united. The farmers alone are not all
who are interested in this movement. We find
the burdens imposed upon lis by high protec.
tive tariffs too great to bear. These burdens
we feel as much as you. 1t is true, that to-day
our legislatures, and even judicial bodies, are
against us. Having recently had occasion 70
examine many judicial decisions on railroad
matters, was surprised to find the great ma
jority of them all against us, and directly in
favor of the railroad monopolsts.


""As to tariffs for protection, it would seem to
be our duty TO abolish them as soon as possible.
They are the great source of most of our evils.
Congress has only power to levy a tariff for
revenue y tariff that is SO high as to Weld no
revenue, becomes tax upon consumers, and IA
dircct subsidy to some monopoly or ring. 1t
takes money, by millions, out of our pockcts,
Tor some great monopoly. by these laws, and

did not want politics in the thing. We Must
not bring in political questions We must

We have to have state police TO do it.


Mr.. Lynch again read the first resolution,
and asked if Cullen or any one else dare to re-
fuse TO endorse it,


Cullen said: True, this may not be obiec.
,ionable, but it may be followed by Others tina,

The Chair called Cullen's attention 10 the
fact that no other resolution but this WAS be

Cullen said he wasn't in favor of recognizing
courts when they 90 too much on old, mus,y
records, but we can't get the judges out in 2O
years. We don't want general principles
we want to unite on some special ones.


Lynch was disguised with Cullen's lodging
about and said sharply: l see, these resou.
tions are unpalatabe to politicians, who run
and will run this society.

Cullen announced that he had been a farmer

WASHINGTON.

",,"Additional About the WaWasset Disaster.


WASHINGTON. August 12.-Additional re-
ports from the scene of the Wawasset dis
aster now place the number OF persons lost
at seventy-twO.


The friends of Daniel Lynch. a tailor,
doing business in this city, are certain that
he was among the lost, Judging from the
description OF an unknown body found. as
published yesterday. Mr.. Lynch was en-.
gagged to be married to widow lady, who,
with her two children, was also among the
lost.


An Investigation to be Had.


The investigation into the cause Of the
disaster TO the Wawasset Will begin to-
morrow, and will assume the form OF a suit
against the owners of the Wawasset by the
supervising inspector Of steamboats, of the
Treasury Department. 1t appears that on
her last eventful trip the owners OF the
Wawasset failed to ask or receive special
permit to carry more passengers than her
certificate of inspection allowed.
If the owners had been granted such a
request, they would have been compelled


to have procured an additional outfit in the


matter of an extra license. The owners
having neglected to procure that necessary
paper have violated the law, the penalty Is
a tine Of SO per passenger, and to refund
| the passage money. 1t is stated the owners
| will be prosecuted for carrying excursion
| lists without d license.


Commodore Rose, inspector of hulls, who
| is stationed at Savannah, will conduct the
| investigation, and will be assisted by John
| Z. Edger, inspector Of boilers at Norfolk,
| both of whom are old and experienced in
| specto-s, and entirely dlsinterested in the
case.


In this connection the following order
| was issued to-day:


| TREASURY DEPARTMENT., August II, 1873.
SIR-In view of the fact that the local
| inspectors at Baltimore made the last in
| spectiOn of the i'll fated steamer Wawasset,
| and in order that the government may
! avail itself of their services as witnesses in
the investigation to bs made concerning the
| disaster to the steamer in question, 1t is
| deemed expedient that OHe of the other


local boards of your district be detailed to
| conduct such investigation. You will


please be governed accordingly.


W. A. RICHARDSON,
Secretary.
| To John Menshaw. Superv lsing Inspector, Balt
| more.


| The investigation will be held in the office


Of the supervising inspector general OF
| steamboats, in the Treasury Department,


and will continue several days.
| General Sheridan's Report on the Recent
| Indian Battle.
| The following telegram was received to-


day at the headquarters of the army:
| CHICAGO, August II. 1873.
| To General W. T. Sherman:


! There is now sufficient evidence to con
| firm the unofficial report of the fight be-


tween the Sioux and Pawnees on the Re
| publica an river, in the southwest corner OF
| Nebraska. The Pawnees we're utterly de-
| feated. Their loss is greater than at first
reported. The Sioux engaged were Ogal
| lios. Bcules and Red Clouds.

illustrated in Virginia, where the State
campaign is just about opening with the
Republican Convention which meets to-day
at Lynchburg. The success of the Adj
ministratiOn party in carrying the State lor
Grant at the last Presidential election has
given announcement to the leaders In that
organization to hope for the election OF the
regular Republican State ticket and an Adj
ministration triumph in the approaching con-
test. This hope has led to quite animated
struggle between the friends of rival candl-
dates for the Gubernatorial nomination to-day.
The most prominent candidates are District
Attorney Robert w. Hughes and Mayor Ed
ward Mcmahon, q prominent railway con-
tractor Of Richmond. The Admlnistra-
ton forces are united upon Col. Hughes,
who carries the Richmond delegation
and majority of the Northern and Western
districts. The chances up to last night seemed
TO favor his success. His opponent Major
McMahon, is supported by that portion of the
Republican State Committee which, if not de-
cidedly opposed to the National Administra-
tlon is not entirelyin in accord with it.


There was some talk while ago OF the
venerable Henry A. Wise as poss bic mde-
pendent candidate for Governor, and that erratc
statesman came out in consequence OF it with
letter of great length, giving his views OF
politics, which seemed to differ from those
Of everybody else: It. Is !A.ss:s now init,
mated that Gov. Wise will support
the Administration State ticket with the un-
derstanding that he shall be elected United
States Senator by that party in the event of Its
being successful. The Conservative State
Convention is called to meet at Richmond on
the 9th of August. The canvass does not
promise any very exciting features, and there
| is little doubt of the success of the Conserva-
| tive candidates."

not commensurate with the disappointment and

Mr.. II. NJ jenkins thought it was pity that

| RICHMOND, Oct 10, 1873
The immediate effect and excitement OF the
financial crash having cleared OF, there is more at.
tention given to and more discussion OF the pollti
cal situation, which, as the campaign advances,
becomes more spirited and full of interest But
while long visaged business men and anxious faces
no longer crowd around the bulletin boards in
fearful expectation OF crash announcements and
bank suspensions the subsequent and final effect
OF the great monetary convusion Is beginning TO
be felt by the bone and slnew OF the country-the
! mechanics aud the laborers. These now con-
| stitute the great voting population OF
| the nation, upon whom, besides q material
effect OF the panic notice also very serious and
| decided evidences OF political effect. The great
| Tredegar Iron Works, employing several hundred
workmen OF both races nave been obliged to
nearly suspend operations altogether. The tobacco


factories Of this city, where thousands of negroes
OF all ages and sexes earn their daily bread have
also partially suspended. The Gallego Flour Mills
the largest in the United States are likewise at a
standstlll and besides these great employers Of
mechanical industry and honest labor there
numerous others in this city which are now in q
state of partial paralysis, owing to the stringency
of the money market.


THE CANVASS.


But to return to politics. The wanderings and
peregrinations OF botn the gubernatorial asprants
are duly noted by their respective organs in this
city, but rarely their sayings Each has a cor
respondent with Kemper, both of whom send regu-
larry patent letter from each place he speaks at
describing great and enthusiastic meetings, cord
ial greetings of Kemper by ex-Confederates, and
promising rousing and larger majority for him
than the particular county from which they write
ever gave before. On the other hand the republi-
can organ works steadily and assiduously
for It's candidate editorially, occasionally
giving campaign letter, but never
report OF speech unless copied from
some conservative Journal. In addition to the two
fgureheads in the canvass there are q number OF
other notables on both sides. Among the con-
servatves besides Colonel Robert L. Withers, the
Raegh Daniel for Attorney Syea ana noticed
ex- United states Senator X. M. 7. Hunter. who

Ould, John s. Wise, son OF Ex-Governor WISE and
p RamsdeII republican candidate ' for Lieutenant
Governor, and Judge David Futz, for Attorney
General, speak daily ior their cause, assisted by
and a number of others. With such an intel
lectual and oratorical force arrayed either side,
one would think that the Mother of states would
be ablaze with excitement and enthusiasm; but
even at as late day as this the canvass drags its
weary way in a routine sort of manner, everybody
taking 1t as matter OF course, according to his
own individual popularity. Nevertheless, there is
deep-seated conviction among the conservatives
that

In 1urmoH-The Democrats Of Worcester
County are in hot water. A ticket wa'
nominated last week, but the rank and filt


OF the party will not support it. A cor


respondent of the Baltimore Sun says
This ticket gives little satisfaction to eithe
old Democrats or Conservatives. There will
be one independent Democratic ticket, .anC
most probably two. Personally there is no
much objection to some men on the ticket, bu


the opposition is because Of the mode Of effect
ing the nominations. So fearful are some o.


the evidences of defeat that the Shield"" o
this town, is already authorized to publish tn,
3 withdrawal of one candidate and there vii
e probably be two other Withdrawals published
5 on Saturday.
